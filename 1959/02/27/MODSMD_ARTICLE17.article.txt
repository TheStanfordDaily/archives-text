## Benefits of Brotherhood 
### 
Submitted by
Inter fraternity Council
The fraternity system, at other
universities as well as at Stan
ford, has recently received a good
share of criticism. Rather than
attack our opponents, we should
like to re-emphasize what we take
to be the benefits of brotherhood.
The advantages lie in three gen
eral areas: those accruing to the
individual, those to the immediate
environment of the University,
and, most important, those to the
society of which the fraternity
man will later become a part.
Fraternities are voluntary as
sociations of college men for the
seeking of values impossible to
t'iixl in large or heterogeneous
groups. These interests are not
incompatible with those of
American education today; rath
er, they serve to strengthen that
part of education which is called
"liberal."
The liberally * educated, well
rounded man has adequate experi
ence in all fields, but his educa
t i on is not entirely superficial.
The element of depth must be
added—a goal which we feel we
are, in large measure, attaining.
If we take that well-rounded
ness to include development of the
intellectual, spiritual, physical and
social man, the fraternity system
offers and encourages, as no other
organization on this campus can,
the especial development of the
latter two, although we realize
that our primary duty is to our
studies and we persist in main
taining them first.
What, then, are the specific
values of fraternity life? The
first is the sense of belonging to
a rather exclusive group. This
is not to certify social eminence
but to emphasize a personal
sense of involvement, the joy of
association with an institution
of long standing.
The sharing of special interests

of the group -which includes its
fraternal secrets —is part of this
belongingness. These values to
the individual cannot be denied.
Fraternities, in their autonomous
and best sense, offer rewarding
experience in self-discipline and in
the assumption of responsibilities
for the groups' affairs.
Personal relationships are most
easily developed in the fraternity
house, where a common ground of
interest is assumed in the bring
ing together of the group. A fra
ternity man is required to get
along with his fellows, and this
situation develops an ease in so
cial affairs which will be invalu
able in later personal relation
ships.
The range of fraternities' par
ticipation in campus life is the
j total extent of University en
deavors. How men dominate the
j athletic scene at Stanford and
strongly influence its student
intellectual and governmental
facets.
In positions of student admin
istration, in influential commit
tees and service groups, including
a large majority of the sponsors
at Wilbur Hall and such groups as
the Chappie staff. ST&T and Pre-
Reg (with the possible exception
of The Daily), fraternity men are
adding their "third dimension" to
; make this University a better one.
To go higher, we start higher.
1 To facilitate the achievement of
our goals, we look for those qual
ities in the initiate which will
make him a valuable member of
the group and a more positive
benefit to society.
We believe that fraternities at
Stanford, with their strength and
security and the wisdom of their
members, can adapt themselves to
the general aims of higher educa-
I ion and thus extend indefinitely
an already long career of service,
honor and support for the best
rather than the gaudiest standards
I of college life.
