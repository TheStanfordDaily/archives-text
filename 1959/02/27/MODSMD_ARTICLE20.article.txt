# Legislature Investigation
## Cardinals, Rally Com Report Suggests Need for Coordination 
### Barbara Hicks 
After almost three months of
deliberation, the Legislature com
mittee investigating the functions
of Rally Commission and Cardi
nals Board made its final report
last week.
The committee, composed of
seven members- Cindy Allen, Un
ion; Bob Burnett and Jerry Majer,
Wilbur; Dick Clotfelter, Men's
Row; Gail Greiner, Lagunita;
Joan Lambert, Roble; and this
writer —tossed the two organiza
tions around, throwing in "spirit"
and the Axe Society now and then
for added interest.
They finally came up with some
recommendations, including by
law changes, which, according to
ASSU president John Bohn, are
"consistent with ihe logic which
should be followed in all boards
and commissions."
Burnett, who has been the mov
ing force on the committee, last
Thursday night explained to the
Legislature that, under the con
stitution, the boards have a defi
nite scope of activities. He said a
board's activities are one segment
of the entire range of student life.
He indicated a circle in the air (he
called it a "nebulous blob") and
cut it into the different areas of
activities.
Because it is unreasonable, both
in view of time and interest, to
send Legislature representatives
to each board and commission,
representatives should be sent to
groups heading the areas.
Out of this reasoning came the
recommendation that Cardinals
"shall make decisions for the co
ordination. regulation, renovation,
and administration of activities in
volving the spirit of Stanford, sub
ject to the approval of the ASSU
Legislature." (Change to be made
in Section 3-A. powers and duties,
of the Cardinals bylaws.)
With this comes a change in the
Rally Com bylaws—Section 8-D,
duties, 1: "Rally Commission shall
have exclusive charge of all raj
lies, rooting sections, stunts, and
other activities involving Stanford
spirit carried on under the direc
tion of Cardinals Board." Atid E,
finance; "Rally Commission may
submit their budget only after ap
proval by Cardinals."
These three changes, the latter
two in particular, will place Rally
Commission under supervision of
Cardinals. The idea behind this
is that so many of.each organiza
tion's activities, if not overlap
ping, are adjacent to the other's,
and this will tighten the coordina
tion between the two.
Concern for the coordination
and communication arose last fall
during Homecoming and Big
Gam£ Week, when, at least to the

students in general, there seemed
to be some' confusion as to just
what was happening.
One example was the night rally
by Rally Com and the morning
rally by Cardinals for Homecom
ing. While these did not conflict
in time or purpose, many this
writer included wondered if they
did not conflict in stimulating in- j
torest. The committee hopes the
bylaw changes will keep both
groups on the same track.
So that Rally Com will not have
to sit meekly back and beg Cardi
nals' approval on their activities,
their chairman has been given a
vote on the board, in another by
law change; and. so that the Leg
islature will be represented in this
phase of student activity, a Legis
lature member will be appointed
to the board, with vote.
. As noted above, "spirit" and the
Axe Society were included in the
discussion.
"Spirit" was defined several
times by members of the commit
tee, but the easiest way to under
stand what they mean in this case
is to again look at the activities
assigned to Rally Com: rallies,
rooting sections, and stunts. Add
to this house decorations, special
programs and other activities, es
pecially those associated with the
football season, and the result is
something like the "spirit" meant
in the proposed bylaw changes.
The Axe Society entered the dis
cussion because of its participa
tion in football season activities.
However, the Axe Society is not
one of the official ASSU organiza
tions—that is, a board or a com
mission—but holds its position as
a Stanford student organization
approved by the ASSU.
There has been some discussion
about making the Axe Society a
commission similar in status to
Rally Com, with its primary ob
ject official ASSU liaison with the
alumni.
All these bylaw changes are in
the mill now—that is, in the by
laws committee —and will be voted
upon next week.
President Bohn called the com
mittee's report—Burnett's report,
chiefly—"a step toward defining
student government."
It would certainly be possible to
do more area grouping, with a re
definition of scope of activities.
For instance, why could not all
activities concerning foreign stu
dents and foreign peoples be com
bined under a general heading?

Or WRA and AWS? Or Concert
Series and Social Coordinating
Board?
Obviously, some of the groups
like the lIR could not easily take
on another group to oversee, be
cause their own activities are so
diverse; but a complete revamp
ing of the structure into the sort
of thing Burnett and Bohn are
thinking of could increase the ef
ficiency and effectiveness of stu
dent government.

Burnett, who has been the mov
ing force on the committee, last
Thursday night explained to the
Legislature that, under the con
stitution, the boards have a defi
nite scope of activities. He said a
board's activities are one segment
of the entire range of student life.
He indicated a circle in the air (he
called it a "nebulous blob") and
cut it into the different areas of
activities.
Because it is unreasonable, both
in view of time and interest, to
send Legislature representatives
to each board and commission,
representatives should be sent to
groups heading the areas.
Out of this reasoning came the
recommendation that Cardinals
"shall make decisions for the co
ordination. regulation, renovation,
and administration of activities in
volving the spirit of Stanford, sub
ject to the approval of the ASSU
Legislature." (Change to be made
in Section 3-A. powers and duties,
of the Cardinals bylaws.)
With this comes a change in the
Rally Com bylaws—Section 8-D,
duties, 1: "Rally Commission shall
have exclusive charge of all raj
lies, rooting sections, stunts, and
other activities involving Stanford
spirit carried on under the direc
tion of Cardinals Board." Atid E,
finance; "Rally Commission may
submit their budget only after ap
proval by Cardinals."
These three changes, the latter
two in particular, will place Rally
Commission under supervision of
Cardinals. The idea behind this
is that so many of.each organiza
tion's activities, if not overlap
ping, are adjacent to the other's,
and this will tighten the coordina
tion between the two.
Concern for the coordination
and communication arose last fall
during Homecoming and Big
Gam£ Week, when, at least to the

students in general, there seemed
to be some' confusion as to just
what was happening.
One example was the night rally
by Rally Com and the morning
rally by Cardinals for Homecom
ing. While these did not conflict
in time or purpose, many this
writer included wondered if they
did not conflict in stimulating in- j
torest. The committee hopes the
bylaw changes will keep both
groups on the same track.
So that Rally Com will not have
to sit meekly back and beg Cardi
nals' approval on their activities,
their chairman has been given a
vote on the board, in another by
law change; and. so that the Leg
islature will be represented in this
phase of student activity, a Legis
lature member will be appointed
to the board, with vote.
. As noted above, "spirit" and the
Axe Society were included in the
discussion.
"Spirit" was defined several
times by members of the commit
tee, but the easiest way to under
stand what they mean in this case
is to again look at the activities
assigned to Rally Com: rallies,
rooting sections, and stunts. Add
to this house decorations, special
programs and other activities, es
pecially those associated with the
football season, and the result is
something like the "spirit" meant
in the proposed bylaw changes.
The Axe Society entered the dis
cussion because of its participa
tion in football season activities.
However, the Axe Society is not
one of the official ASSU organiza
tions—that is, a board or a com
mission—but holds its position as
a Stanford student organization
approved by the ASSU.
There has been some discussion
about making the Axe Society a
commission similar in status to
Rally Com, with its primary ob
ject official ASSU liaison with the
alumni.
All these bylaw changes are in
the mill now—that is, in the by
laws committee —and will be voted
upon next week.
President Bohn called the com
mittee's report—Burnett's report,
chiefly—"a step toward defining
student government."
It would certainly be possible to
do more area grouping, with a re
definition of scope of activities.
For instance, why could not all
activities concerning foreign stu
dents and foreign peoples be com
bined under a general heading?

Or WRA and AWS? Or Concert
Series and Social Coordinating
Board?
Obviously, some of the groups
like the lIR could not easily take
on another group to oversee, be
cause their own activities are so
diverse; but a complete revamp
ing of the structure into the sort
of thing Burnett and Bohn are
thinking of could increase the ef
ficiency and effectiveness of stu
dent government.
After almost three months of
deliberation, the Legislature com
mittee investigating the functions
of Rally Commission and Cardi
nals Board made its final report
last week.
The committee, composed of
seven members- Cindy Allen, Un
ion; Bob Burnett and Jerry Majer,
Wilbur; Dick Clotfelter, Men's
Row; Gail Greiner, Lagunita;
Joan Lambert, Roble; and this
writer —tossed the two organiza
tions around, throwing in "spirit"
and the Axe Society now and then
for added interest.
They finally came up with some
recommendations, including by
law changes, which, according to
ASSU president John Bohn, are
"consistent with ihe logic which
should be followed in all boards

ject to the approval of the ASSU
Legislature." (Change to be made
in Section 3-A. powers and duties,
of the Cardinals bylaws.)
With this comes a change in the
Rally Com bylaws—Section 8-D,
duties, 1: "Rally Commission shall
have exclusive charge of all raj
lies, rooting sections, stunts, and
other activities involving Stanford
spirit carried on under the direc
tion of Cardinals Board." Atid E,
finance; "Rally Commission may
submit their budget only after ap
proval by Cardinals."
These three changes, the latter
two in particular, will place Rally
Commission under supervision of
Cardinals. The idea behind this
is that so many of.each organiza
tion's activities, if not overlap
ping, are adjacent to the other's,
and this will tighten the coordina
tion between the two.
Concern for the coordination
and communication arose last fall
during Homecoming and Big
Gam£ Week, when, at least to the

students in general, there seemed
to be some' confusion as to just
what was happening.
One example was the night rally
by Rally Com and the morning
rally by Cardinals for Homecom
ing. While these did not conflict
in time or purpose, many this
writer included wondered if they
did not conflict in stimulating in- j
torest. The committee hopes the
bylaw changes will keep both
groups on the same track.
So that Rally Com will not have
to sit meekly back and beg Cardi
nals' approval on their activities,
their chairman has been given a
vote on the board, in another by
law change; and. so that the Leg
islature will be represented in this
phase of student activity, a Legis
lature member will be appointed
to the board, with vote.
. As noted above, "spirit" and the
Axe Society were included in the
discussion.
"Spirit" was defined several
times by members of the commit
tee, but the easiest way to under
stand what they mean in this case
is to again look at the activities
assigned to Rally Com: rallies,
rooting sections, and stunts. Add
to this house decorations, special
programs and other activities, es
pecially those associated with the
football season, and the result is
something like the "spirit" meant
in the proposed bylaw changes.
The Axe Society entered the dis
cussion because of its participa
tion in football season activities.
However, the Axe Society is not
one of the official ASSU organiza
tions—that is, a board or a com
mission—but holds its position as
a Stanford student organization
approved by the ASSU.
There has been some discussion
about making the Axe Society a
commission similar in status to
Rally Com, with its primary ob
ject official ASSU liaison with the
alumni.
All these bylaw changes are in
the mill now—that is, in the by
laws committee —and will be voted
upon next week.
President Bohn called the com
mittee's report—Burnett's report,
chiefly—"a step toward defining
student government."
It would certainly be possible to
do more area grouping, with a re
definition of scope of activities.
For instance, why could not all
activities concerning foreign stu
dents and foreign peoples be com
bined under a general heading?

Or WRA and AWS? Or Concert
Series and Social Coordinating
Board?
Obviously, some of the groups
like the lIR could not easily take
on another group to oversee, be
cause their own activities are so
diverse; but a complete revamp
ing of the structure into the sort
of thing Burnett and Bohn are
thinking of could increase the ef
ficiency and effectiveness of stu
dent government.
After almost three months of
deliberation, the Legislature com
mittee investigating the functions
of Rally Commission and Cardi
nals Board made its final report
last week.
The committee, composed of
seven members- Cindy Allen, Un
ion; Bob Burnett and Jerry Majer,
Wilbur; Dick Clotfelter, Men's
Row; Gail Greiner, Lagunita;
Joan Lambert, Roble; and this
writer —tossed the two organiza
tions around, throwing in "spirit"
and the Axe Society now and then
for added interest.
They finally came up with some
recommendations, including by
law changes, which, according to
ASSU president John Bohn, are
"consistent with ihe logic which
should be followed in all boards
and commissions."
Burnett, who has been the mov
ing force on the committee, last
Thursday night explained to the
Legislature that, under the con
stitution, the boards have a defi
nite scope of activities. He said a
board's activities are one segment
of the entire range of student life.
He indicated a circle in the air (he
called it a "nebulous blob") and
cut it into the different areas of
activities.
Because it is unreasonable, both
in view of time and interest, to
send Legislature representatives
to each board and commission,
representatives should be sent to
groups heading the areas.
Out of this reasoning came the
recommendation that Cardinals
"shall make decisions for the co
ordination. regulation, renovation,
and administration of activities in
volving the spirit of Stanford, sub
ject to the approval of the ASSU
Legislature." (Change to be made
