Editor, The Daily:
We were amazed by the head
line on this morning's Daily story
concerning the Foreign Scholar
ship Commission for two reasons.
First, the headline (which read
"Investigation Report Says Fra
ternities Don't Consider Visiting
Students' Views") bears no rela
tion to anything reported in the
article.
The article states, "Communica
tion with the fraternities has caus
ed SOME difficulties for the For
eign Scholarship Commission in
the past, but this year's operation I
has r un smoothly, with RARE ex-1
ceptions leaps. mine|."
The article goes on to say that
it is always difficult to integrate
a scholar into university life, but
that in most cases "the fraterni- i
ties are cooperating well." Any
one who read the article could see
what it said, but unfortunately
many of The D a i 1 y's readers
merely glance at ihe headlines,
and this headline would give them
a mistaken impression.
Second, we feel that the frater
nities are most certainly to be
commended, not criticized, for
their hospitality to the scholars
this year and in the past. With j
(lie exception of one small group
in ONE fraternity, they went out
of their way to make the scholars
feel at home; they showed an in- j
terest in and consideration for the
affairs of the scholar and the
scholar's country.
This is the feature of the article
which should have been empha- ;
sized rather than the fact that
there are "rare exceptions" to this ;
rule.
There seems to be a tendency
in campus publications to empha
size the bad behavior of a small
group of fraternity members and
blame the entire system for this
behavior, while at. the same time
less mention is made of the good
things which fraternities have
done.
both the fraternHies and the
clubs have gone out of their way
to make the scholars feel at home.
We can see no reason to turn the

fact thai a small number of stu
dent s have been inconsider ate into
the generalization that "fraterni
ties don't consider visiting stu
dents' views."

(Editors' Note: The headline
correctly titled the story as it
was first written and set into
type. The writer reworded the
story after talking with the co
chairmen, and failed to change
the headline. We hear the re
j spousihility for not catching the
change oil our page proof.)
University's St.uul?
Editor, The Daily:
After reading the article [Daily,
i Feb. 201 concerning the loyalty
oath requirement of the National
Education Act, the editorial of
Feb. 12 and ihe article of Jan. 22
discussing the same topic, I can
not help but wonder at Stanford's
refusal to take a stand on this
issue.
Our University considers itself
(and is considered by many) to be
one of the foremost universities in
the United States (rumor has it:
| "Harvard of the West Coast").
However, most of the leading
schools are not afraid to stand up
for "conscience problems"; in fact,
such problems seem to be consid
! ered as equal in importance as
"items of the budget."
Although the majority of per
sons who will be forced to take
loyalty oaths will be students rath
er than administrators or profes
sor's, the latter two groups are
condoning, if not sanctioning, the
need for this oath and thereby
almost admitting a quality of un
trustworthiness in their students
by refusing to make a clear and
positive statement on this issue.
We, as students, are well pro
tected by the University on other,
somewhat trivial, moral quest ions.
Is this "conscience problem" too
insignificant to warrant at least
equivalent concern? <)i is this a
question unworthy of the cduc.it
ed man's consideration?
