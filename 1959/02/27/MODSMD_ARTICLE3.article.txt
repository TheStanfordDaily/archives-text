## Lake Lag To Open Tomorrow 
### Dick Barnes Associate Editor 
Lake Lagunita will open Satur
day for swimming and boating.
Legislature passed a resolution !
for the opening last night after
receiving reports that the lake
was now full enough to go into
operation for the remainder of
Ihe school year.
No specific hours will be estab
lished until Monday, but tempo
rary opening and closing times
for the weekend will be posted on
the boathouse.
Legislature will also look into
two questions related to the lake
opening: use of sailboats and pos
sible sale of food at the boathouse.
Business Manager Larry Kelley
noted that a barbecue is available !
at the nominal fee of $2 for use
of student groups.
Expense Limits
Introduced and sent to by-laws
committee for study was a pro
posal to raise expense limits in
student body elections. Recom
mendations presented by Elec
tions Commission chairman John
Richards call for a $r>o ceiling for
president, vice-president and head
yell leader candidates, and $20 for
all others running for office.
Richards explained that the
present $20 and $10 limits arc un
realistic and unenforceable. lie
said Elections Com must present
ly "turn its head" to violations.
Presidential candidates, he added,
normally spend more than the $20
before even starting campaigning.
Effective Step
Richards said he wasn't sure
that even the new limits would be
realistic, but he felt they would
at least be a step in the right di
rection. Willi the new limits,
Elections Com should be better
able to enforce the rules, he con
cluded.
Further discussion brought out
the problem of which expenses
are declarable and which arc not
-the major trouble spots being
such items as gasoline and tele
phone calls. ASSU President John
I John said he thought that if cv-1
orything is included, a $50 limit
is realistic, but that if only, mate
rial items such as posters are
counted, the new limit might be
too high.
In other action, Legislature ap
proved a by-law deletion to the
of feet that Foreign Scholarship
Commission members would no
longer be required to submit year
end reports to ASSU.
