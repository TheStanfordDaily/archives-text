# Golfers Face Peninsula Club
## 
### 
Stanford golfers open the 1959
season against a tough Peninsula
Coif Cluh today at 1 p.m. on the
Stanford course. Hon Preston,
Jim Kardas, Jack Latney and Bob
Shanahan will lead the varsity
linksters against the always pow
erful San Mateo club.
The golfing picture is good
again at the Farm this year lie
cause although Hill Seanor, who
was injured in a wreck this quar
ler, is missing, the remainder of
last year's team is hack and new
faces Ron Preston and Jack La
mey will add to Indian power.
