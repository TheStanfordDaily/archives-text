walk away with leam honors this
afternoon, but it is quite possible
that Terry Tognazzini and Jim
Small of Cal could steal the show
for individual events.
( u! Boasts Are •
In otder to give Tognazzini an
opportunity to exhibit his special
ty, both coaches have agreed to
add to this afternoon's program a

official 2:06.5 this year. Both boys
are expected t<> break Ihe present
national record of 2:07.5, held by

4:40 clocking) and Ihe 1500-meter.
The medley relay, which will
start this afternoon's meet, and
the free-style relay, which will
end it, are going to he loaded with
the best talent Stanford has to
offer.

"We wore disappointed against
ISC in tho medley and will run our
| top men to try to flash their rec
ord also in the freestyle relay,"
were Coach I laynic's words in re
lation to the Trojans' victory
