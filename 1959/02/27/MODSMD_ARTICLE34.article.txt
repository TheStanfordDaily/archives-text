# Out-of-the Race Indians Face Cougar, SC Fives
## 
### Rob Payne, Sports Editor Steve Baffrey 
With its chances of coming up
with a laurel leaf all gone, Stan
ford begins the "play it out" leg
of its 1959 Pacific Coast Confer
ence basketball schedule when it
meets the Washington Slate Cou
gars tonight and Southern Cali
fornia's off-again, on-again Tro
jans on Saturday.
Both games are set for S p.m.
starts in the Pavilion.
Tonight the Tribe will get its
first shot ;il the last place WSC
live since their season-opening 59-
'10 win in Pullman last month.
WSC, with a 2-11 mark, is in its
customary spot on the PCC's bot
tom.
l'ost Big Wins
But the Cougars have shown
they're dangerous this year as
attested by victories over such
clubs as Gon/aga, Montana Sfate,
IJCLA and USC. Coach Marv
llarshman, in his first year direct
ing the Crimson and Grey, has
built a balanced attack with sound
scoring out of six men.
Once again leading the Cougs
in almost everything is 6-6 junior
center John Maras, who has aver
aged 12 points and 10 rebounds
a game.
In the backconrt, WSC is paced
by one of the league's fastest
guards, 5-8 Jimmy Ross. Ross'
lias averaged tt.H points this sea
son and turned in some brilliant
clutch basketball such as his last
second shot that sunk USC two
weeks ago.
Teaming with Ross most of the
time is 5-10 Mert Kennedy, an
amazing jumper for his height,
and a good long-shooter.
Talent at Forward
Up front, llarshman has an ex
cedent one two three punch in
senior hick Axel,son, junior
I niane Ranniger and sophomore
Frank Reed. This trio has com
bined to average 2K points in
league play. Reed, from Covina,
Calif., has a 10.2 mark.
Southern Cal handed the In
dians tho first defeat of last week
end's double disaster in the Soulh
dand, 71-52.
Stanford couldn't warm up to
the tussle and went for close to
the first ten minutes of the game
before breaking field goal ice.
After that point, down by a 17-0
margin, the Cards couldn't come
back.
Junior forward Johnny Wcrhas
paced the Trojans in their vic
tory, piling up 23 counters. The
6-2 shooter boosted himself into
the fourth spot in PCC scoring
with 221 total points and a 17-
marker-per-game average.
White Looks Good
Werhas' teammate at the for
ward post is 6-3 junior Jim White.
He looked good against the In
dians \vith his 11-point barrage.
Center Bob Hampton was real
ly the sensation of the weekend.
The 6-5 junior, who had ousted
veteran Jim Hanna from the
starting nod, played an all around
top-notch game, pouring in 19
counters to go along with his
good defensive play.
Trojan coach Forrest Twogood
will send Bill Boom and Steve
Kemp into the game as his start
ing guards.
Bloom contributed 10 points to
the defeat of the Indians, and was
a pretty handy man on the back
boards. He's a 6-0 junior.
Kemp, although he didn't get
too high in scoring figures, turned
in a good showing on defense. But
this appears to be the Trojans'
weak spot and Jerry Pimm and
Phil Faist saw action at this spot.
