sured, Stanford's freshman bas
ketball team will close out its sea
son in the Pavilion this week end,
playing host to Marin Junior Col
lege tonight and San Jose Junior
College tomorrow. Both games are
set for 6 p.m. tip-offs.
The Papooses have won eight of
their 14 starts this season and can
finish with no worse than an X-8
season record. If they can take
both games this week end. how
ever, they will finish with a very
respectable 10-0 record.
If this week end runs true to
form, though, the chances that
the frosh will split seem like a
good percentage bet. They hava
won both games in a week end
only once this year, and that was
way back on Jan. 9 and 10 when
they cleaned up against Diablo
Valley College and Santa Cruz
High School.
More good news for Papoose
coach Bill Turner Phil Jacobs, a
speedy guard who has been out
with a badly sprained ankle, is
ready to join the squad again for
their last two games.

Looking especially good in the
lasl Jew games has been Bryan,
who has now solidly cemented
down his starting berth. Bryan's
accurate 30-foot jump shot keeps
the opposition's defense loosened.
