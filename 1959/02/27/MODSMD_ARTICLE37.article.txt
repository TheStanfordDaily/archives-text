# IN THE SOUTH
## Ruggers in Tough One Vs. Bruins 
### 
Stanford's rugby team travels
to Los Angeles to tangle with the
UCLA Bruins tomorrow. It will
be the first match this season
against a member of the almost
defunct FCC.
This match should prove to be
the toughest for the Indians this
sea-son. Last week end the Bruins
lost a muddy, wet /?o to C';il in
Berkeley. The Bruins have a
tough scrum and several outstand
ing individuals one a Si.uth Af
rican.
Coach Pete Kmetovic's ruggers
will be looking for their fifth win
of the season. The Card rugby
men split a two-game series with
the Olympic Club, heal the Penin
sula Ramblers twice and downed
the Olympic Club "A" squad to
gain a 4-1 record.
Kmetovic will 1:0 willi his usual
â€¢starting lineup, and, with no in
juries, the club will be at its full
strength. Left-footed kicker Kyrk
Reid will start at hooker, Cap Ing
ham and Don Peter al props, Tom
McDonald and Erie Protiva in the
second row, Bob Parks and John
Butler on the wings. Clary Van
Galder and Dick Takaki as break
aways and Phil Burklund at lock
in the scrum.
In the back field it will be little
Dave Sehol'/. at scrum half, Jack
Taylor and Sid Garber at five
eighths, Armand Jaques at center
three-fourths and Trev Grimm at
fullback.
