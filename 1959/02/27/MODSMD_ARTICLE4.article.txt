# Berlin Talks End in Chill;
## Dodd Urges Alert Over War Threat 
### 
WASHINGTON (/I 1 ) — Senator
Thomas J. Dodd (D-Conn.), warn
ing that the Soviets may trigger
a war over Berlin, urged Thurs
day an intensive 90-day program
to alert the nation for any even
tuality.
"I do not believe the country is
prepared—that the people are pre
pared—that they know we are on
the threshold possibly of grave
disaster," Dodd told the Senate.
On the other hand, three Repub
lican senators said after a talk
with President Eisenhower that
firm plans have been made to
meat any Soviet move to force the
Western Allies out of divided Ber
lin. No details were given.
Unpre pared ness
Dodd said he questions not so
much the adequacy of U.S. armed
forces as what he termed the un
preparedness of the people for
possible conflict.
"We should embark today," he
said, "upon a 90-day program of j
the utmost urgency that will pre
pare the American people, the
American economy and the Amer
ican defenses for whatever de
mands may be made upon them."
At the White House, press sec
retary James C. Hagerty declined
comment on Dodd's speech.
Call to Close Ranks
Dodd appealed for Democrats
and Republicans to close ranks
behind Eisenhower's refusal to
end four-power rule of Berlin and
convert the Western sector into a
demilitarized city as Soviet Pre
mier Nik i t a Khrushchev de
mands.
Chairman J. William Fulbright
(D-Ark.) of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee said he was
disturbed by reductions in the
Army and other signs that, in
stead of strengthening defenses,
"we are going in the opposite di
rection."
