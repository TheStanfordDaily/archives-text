# ‘UNCLE VANYA’
## New Stanford Players' Production Begins Run 
### A Review By Jerome Clinton 
The Stanford Players' produc
tion of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya"
i in Memorial Auditorium initiates
i their use of an arena stage. The
stage itself, unfortunately, pro
! vides the only disturbing note in
j an otherwise highly commendable
I production.
1 doubt that the play is actually
{improved by this type of perform-
I ance. I found the faces of other
members of the audience an occa
sional and unavoidable distraction,
and the dim - lit dumb - show of
•scene-shifting takes the audience

back stage so effectively thai
much of the dramatic illusion is
lost.
The action of Chekhov's work,
ironically subtitled "Scenes From
Country Life," proceeds from the
interruption of ihe natural order
of an industrious household by
the arrival of two people whose
1 advanced age or indolence pre
vents them from accepting their
share of the work, and whose van
ity chn be satisfied only by draw
ing Hie others from their tasks.
Deprived of their sustaining ac
tivity, Vanya and his friends try
to discover some other, some ab
solute, justification for their lives.
All find themselves lacking in
some essential detail. Their con
sequent desperation results in vio
lence which miraculously restores
the old order, leaving only the
heavy memories of its momentary
interruption.
Closely-Knit Drama
Chekhov has written a closely
knit drama whose characters are
richly drawn and vitally interest
ing. Under Dierlam's direction,
the play moves easily and surely
throughout.
Tdie only unconvincing moments
come when Chekhov, through
Vanya's niece Sonia, tries to add
a touch of Christian piety to his
philosophy of endurance through

activity by postulating a pleasant,
heavenly sleep for those who have
labofod through a life of unremit
ting pain. The suffering of his
characters is too real, too immedi
ate, to give such mild optimism
much meaning.
The cast is, without exception,
outstanding. Fred Levi captures
the profound humor and anguish
of Astrov —by far the noblest
character in the play with par
ticular excellence. And Jules Irv
ing is very good as Uncle Vanya,
the busy lit tie man who, because
he has so little character, loses it
all when he cannot work.
Mark Hammer and Celia How
ard give excellent performances
as Alexander and Elena Serebria
kov, respectively the aged egotis
tical brother-in-law and indolent
young second wife of Vanya.
Aids Ending
Mary Julia Curl is, as Sonia, ap
pears somewhat too continually
effusive in the first scenes, yet
amirably succeeds in making the
sentimental ending believable. Jo
seph Plummer and Julia Shrader
are superb in two small but essen
tial roles.
Both setting and costuming are
! well and exactly done, and the
lighting technician has a lm os t
overcome the handicap of the
arena stage.
This latest production of the
J Stanford Players is indeed very
much worth seeing. Performances
continue tonight and tomorrow
' evening and next week, Monday
through Saturday. Tickets are on
; sale weekday afternoons at Me
morial Box Office or Peninsula
I Box Office.

of Astrov —by far the noblest
character in the play with par
ticular excellence. And Jules Irv
ing is very good as Uncle Vanya,
the busy lit tie man who, because
he has so little character, loses it
all when he cannot work.
Mark Hammer and Celia How
ard give excellent performances
as Alexander and Elena Serebria
kov, respectively the aged egotis
tical brother-in-law and indolent
young second wife of Vanya.
Aids Ending
Mary Julia Curl is, as Sonia, ap
pears somewhat too continually
effusive in the first scenes, yet
amirably succeeds in making the
sentimental ending believable. Jo
seph Plummer and Julia Shrader
are superb in two small but essen
tial roles.
Both setting and costuming are
! well and exactly done, and the
lighting technician has a lm os t
overcome the handicap of the
arena stage.
This latest production of the
J Stanford Players is indeed very
much worth seeing. Performances
continue tonight and tomorrow
' evening and next week, Monday
through Saturday. Tickets are on
; sale weekday afternoons at Me
morial Box Office or Peninsula
I Box Office.

SCENE FROM "UNCLE YANYA"
Julia Shrader and Joe Hummer in Stanford Players' production
The Stanford Players' produc
tion of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya"
i in Memorial Auditorium initiates
i their use of an arena stage. The
stage itself, unfortunately, pro
! vides the only disturbing note in
j an otherwise highly commendable
I production.
1 doubt that the play is actually
{improved by this type of perform-
I ance. I found the faces of other
members of the audience an occa
sional and unavoidable distraction,
and the dim - lit dumb - show of
•scene-shifting takes the audience

back stage so effectively thai
much of the dramatic illusion is
lost.
The action of Chekhov's work,
ironically subtitled "Scenes From
Country Life," proceeds from the
interruption of ihe natural order
of an industrious household by
the arrival of two people whose
1 advanced age or indolence pre
vents them from accepting their
share of the work, and whose van
ity chn be satisfied only by draw
ing Hie others from their tasks.
Deprived of their sustaining ac
tivity, Vanya and his friends try
to discover some other, some ab
solute, justification for their lives.
All find themselves lacking in
some essential detail. Their con
sequent desperation results in vio
lence which miraculously restores
the old order, leaving only the
heavy memories of its momentary
interruption.
Closely-Knit Drama
Chekhov has written a closely
knit drama whose characters are
richly drawn and vitally interest
ing. Under Dierlam's direction,
the play moves easily and surely
throughout.
Tdie only unconvincing moments
come when Chekhov, through
Vanya's niece Sonia, tries to add
a touch of Christian piety to his
philosophy of endurance through

activity by postulating a pleasant,
heavenly sleep for those who have
labofod through a life of unremit
ting pain. The suffering of his
characters is too real, too immedi
ate, to give such mild optimism
much meaning.
The cast is, without exception,
outstanding. Fred Levi captures
the profound humor and anguish
of Astrov —by far the noblest
character in the play with par
ticular excellence. And Jules Irv
ing is very good as Uncle Vanya,
the busy lit tie man who, because
he has so little character, loses it
