### 
Craig Barnett and Buzzy Joseph pulled a swift
Kappa Sigma chariot and chariotcer Cathy Soehr
ons to a close victory over the Phi Delta Theta
entrant in the Greek Week Chariot Race finals
yesterday afternoon on Campus Drive before more
than 200 spectators.
But the finals were not the only high spot in
yesterday's Greek Week activities. Nearly 500 per
sons cheered on the participants in the spirited and
bizarre chariot preliminaries. The palm • laden
Delta Tau Delta chariot was a threat from I lie
start. "Roadblock" is what the Alpha Sigma Phi
house 1 called it.
Another surprise entrant was the Delta Kappa
ICpsilon "bathtub bomb." complete with bubble
bath and "Heavenly Helen" Hawthorne.
Another high spot adding to yesterday's Greek
carnival atmosphere was the old car racc, staged
as a teaser before the chariot contests.
Greek Week continues today with the Greek
Week Ball for the fraternities at the St. Francis
between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. Stan Kenton's band will
provide the music with intermission entertainment
by campus groups.
A highlight of the dance will be the introduction
of the 22 Greek Week candidates at around 11 p.m.
Today at 4:15 p.m. Dean Philip Rhinelandcr of
the School of Humanities will present an explana
tion and critical discussion of the Stanford frater
nity system in the Memorial Auditorium Little
Theater. His talk is open to the campus.
The last event of Interfraternity Council's Greek
Week will be the crowning of the Greek Week
Queen tomorrow afternoon at Jlossotti's. Games
and contests between the queen candidates and
entertainment by the "Red Garter" troupe will be

other (natures of the day.
Greek Week was an innovation this year by
1FC and began with "Big Brother Day" Wednes
day when the fraternities hosted more than 200
Redwood City elementary sehooi boys for a day
of campus activities which included a basketball
elimination, campus tours and dinner with the
fraternities.

Craig Barnett and Buzzy Joseph pulled a swift
Kappa Sigma chariot and chariotcer Cathy Soehr
ons to a close victory over the Phi Delta Theta
entrant in the Greek Week Chariot Race finals
yesterday afternoon on Campus Drive before more
than 200 spectators.
But the finals were not the only high spot in
yesterday's Greek Week activities. Nearly 500 per
sons cheered on the participants in the spirited and
bizarre chariot preliminaries. The palm • laden
Delta Tau Delta chariot was a threat from I lie
start. "Roadblock" is what the Alpha Sigma Phi
house 1 called it.
Another surprise entrant was the Delta Kappa
ICpsilon "bathtub bomb." complete with bubble
bath and "Heavenly Helen" Hawthorne.
Another high spot adding to yesterday's Greek
carnival atmosphere was the old car racc, staged
as a teaser before the chariot contests.
Greek Week continues today with the Greek
Week Ball for the fraternities at the St. Francis
between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. Stan Kenton's band will
provide the music with intermission entertainment
by campus groups.
A highlight of the dance will be the introduction
of the 22 Greek Week candidates at around 11 p.m.
Today at 4:15 p.m. Dean Philip Rhinelandcr of
the School of Humanities will present an explana
