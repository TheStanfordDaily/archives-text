# Two Flyers Escape Death In Campus Plane Crash
## 
### Cart Oliver Elna Rodenhouse 
Two Stanford seniors narrowly
escaped death when they crashed
the newest of the Stanford Fly
ing ('ltib's light planes into a cow
pasture near Sandhill Road Fri
day at a.m.
The two, Cecil M. Taylor and
David K. Williams, crawled from
the wreckage, walked 500 yards to
the road, and hitchhiked two
miles to the Health Center.
Injured
Taylor, dazed and suffering a
broken nose, face cuts, a possible
concussion and partial amnesia,
was rushed to Palo Alto Hospital
for examination. He was released
Sunday. Williams was treated at
the Health Center for minor cuts
and abrasions and released.
The impact of Ihe crash shat
tered I ho propeller, pushed the en
gine into the gas tank behind it,
collapsed the landing gear and
tore the left wing from the air
craft. There was no fire.
Low-Level Turns
Jack Nystrom, Palo Alto Air
port manager, said lie believed the
two had taken the Aeronca Cham
pion out to practice low-level
turns at about 800 feet. He sug
gested that they may have turned
too tightly to miss a tree, lost con
trol and hit the ground.
Asked about the cause of the
accident, Williams, an experienced
pilot, refused to comment. He had
been sitting in the front of the
two-seat, dual control craft.
No Comment
Williams had "no comment" to
make about who was at the con
trols of the craft when it hit.
On seeing a picture of the crum
pled left wing of the small light
plane, Williams said that the
wing had caught on a small knoll
in the field.
Taylor, in the back seat of the
craft, was apparently thrown into
a bent roof bracing.
Taylor said that his mind was
a blank on the crash and that he
didn't remember anything "from
the time I was shaving in the
morning until I arrived at the hos
pital."
"Retrograde Amnesia"
He said he was suffering from
what doctors called "retrograde
amnesia," and that he could not
remember anything that hap
pened a few hours before the ac
cident or the accident itself.
"I understand from Dave that
J was at the controls," he said.
"It was a light plane and we
would have taken precautions to
see we wouldn't be killed in case
of an acident. I'm sure we would
have left a margin of safety in
whatever we were doing."
After investigating the crash.
Tod A. Bolinger, general safety
inspector for the Federal Avia
tion Agency, said the airplane was
apparently sound.
The plane may have stalled at
too slow an air speed or the en
cine may have failed, he said. but.
this cannot he determined until
further investigation.
Parts Sinew n
The fact that parts were strewn
over only a small area. Bolinger
said, indicates that the plane was
flying low and slowly.
Allen Amsbaugh, vice-president,
of the club, estimated the damage
at about $1200. He said the plane
will he salvaged.

No one seriously hurt —$1200 damage to plane
Two Stanford seniors narrowly
escaped death when they crashed
the newest of the Stanford Fly
ing ('ltib's light planes into a cow
pasture near Sandhill Road Fri
day at a.m.
The two, Cecil M. Taylor and
David K. Williams, crawled from
the wreckage, walked 500 yards to
the road, and hitchhiked two
miles to the Health Center.
Injured
Taylor, dazed and suffering a
broken nose, face cuts, a possible
concussion and partial amnesia,
was rushed to Palo Alto Hospital
for examination. He was released
Sunday. Williams was treated at
the Health Center for minor cuts
and abrasions and released.
The impact of Ihe crash shat
tered I ho propeller, pushed the en
gine into the gas tank behind it,
collapsed the landing gear and
tore the left wing from the air
craft. There was no fire.
Low-Level Turns
Jack Nystrom, Palo Alto Air
port manager, said lie believed the
two had taken the Aeronca Cham
pion out to practice low-level
turns at about 800 feet. He sug
gested that they may have turned
too tightly to miss a tree, lost con
trol and hit the ground.
Asked about the cause of the
accident, Williams, an experienced
pilot, refused to comment. He had
been sitting in the front of the
two-seat, dual control craft.
No Comment
Williams had "no comment" to
make about who was at the con
trols of the craft when it hit.
On seeing a picture of the crum
pled left wing of the small light
plane, Williams said that the
wing had caught on a small knoll
in the field.
Taylor, in the back seat of the
craft, was apparently thrown into
a bent roof bracing.
Taylor said that his mind was
a blank on the crash and that he
didn't remember anything "from
the time I was shaving in the
morning until I arrived at the hos
pital."
"Retrograde Amnesia"
He said he was suffering from
what doctors called "retrograde
amnesia," and that he could not
remember anything that hap
pened a few hours before the ac
cident or the accident itself.
"I understand from Dave that
J was at the controls," he said.
"It was a light plane and we
would have taken precautions to
see we wouldn't be killed in case
of an acident. I'm sure we would
have left a margin of safety in
whatever we were doing."
