# Maturity, Layout Grace Sequoia, on Sale Today
## 
### Diana Smith Managing Editor 
The tenth appearance of Sequoia magazine on campus today is a
matured and even professional one. The merits of its content cn.jo>
the added grace of what is probably the best layout in which 11ic

magazine has yet been displayed.
Especially appealing is the use (
accompanied with drawings as
usual, but poems have happily
been left to themselves without
the strain of "illustration." Art
also has its own well â€¢ focused
place in a special section. And not
the least delightful of the art arc
the little drawings in out-of-the
way corners of the back pages.
Overbalanced
A magazine can only use the
best of the available material, but
this issue's contents, although
well written, seem a bit overbal
anced with sociology and politics.
"Prochazka's Day" is an excep
tionally well written story by Jon
Wilcox of a Czech instructor's
ironic loneliness at the Monterey
Army Language School.
Of the poems, Peter Everwine's
"Angel and Unicorn and Butter
fly" breathes a most lovely invo
cation upon a child's beginnings.
Ellen Kay's "The Sword in the
Stone" is finely wrought, and
Tom Fcrrell's imagery in "To one
who, by painting the front of her
apartment, defies the law of
Boston" is especially memorable.
Russian Visitors
Tn "We Visil the U.S.A." the ed
itor's encounter of a distorted

112 art work: stories and articles arc
Russian youth magazine account
of the then enthusiastically
viewed visit of five Russian stu
dent editors here last spring
evokes the hardheaded under
standing of a wiser optimism.
Jean Raf forty's cover design is
a pleasing one. rt is also one of
the few Sequoia covers that have
lonked better folded than opened
out flat.
Artists' Works
Outstanding among individual
artists' works are Oilda Mayer's
extremely human pencil sketches,
Nick Golosow's pungent block
prints and Claudia Andreason's
more plaintive one. and Robert
Ishikawa's brilliant precision with
pen and ink.
A recalled experience amidst
the well-contrived Moscow work
ers' demonstration "against."
Americans following the Leba
nese intervention last .summer
has made a vivid piece of journal
ism by .Toff Fadiman; if won the
magazine's recent article contest.
Also included is "The Proud
Convict," a story by David Dow.
John Lawrence's "Reisman and
Whyte Reconsidered" is the lead
article.
