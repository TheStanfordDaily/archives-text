# Dulles Replacement
## 
### 
The American people have to face the fact that our "one-man
foreign ofliee" Secretary of Stale John hosier Dulles, vv hom Pres
ident Eisenhower has called 'indispensable is seriously ill.
Dulles is presently undergoing radiation treatments lor ab
dominal cancer, and his chances lor recovery are good.
11 is illness. however, coming at nil era in world poli
tics which can ho described as one long series of crises,
lins spotlighted a serious weakness in U.S. governmental
structure: this one man IS virtually indispensable to the.
efficient conduct of United States foreign policy.
Dulles' courage, his brilliant abilities as a negotiator, his vast
energies and his detailed personal knowledge of each intricate
problem have enabled him to handle the dual roles ol Secretary
of State and presidential agent by himself.
Hut, although his personal capabilities mny be for
midable, he is as vulnerable to sickness, accident and
natural disaster as anyone. A nation such ns ours must
have a capable, experienced and informed candidate for
Secretary of State at limes such us these. We do not.
During Dulles* six years of service to his country, be has un
selfishly expended his time, energy and now his very health for
his country. But he has also dominated those who work with him,
with the direct result that some of the normal State Department
machinery has diminished iri importance. Envoys have become,
to put it bluntly, messenger boys for the man in the Homburg,
and the policy planning staff has slipped into shadowy obscurity.
The American people, no less than the President, sin
cere! v hope thut Dulles will recover (hopefully in lime
to represent the If est in the Berlin issue), but we might
well hope thut the secretary wonbl also begin "coaching"
possible successors for his strategic position on the Ameri
can team.
There is a limit to every man's endurance. At present, neither
of the two men most likely to step into Dulles' shoes, Christian
A. Herter and C. Douglas Dillon, have comparable knowledge of
the facta or good, solid experience in the conduct of American
policy abroad.
We appeal to the American people, and particularly to our
national representatives, to arrest and correct this development
toward "one-man indispensability"; to prepare a less personal
State Department machinery so as to allow the "continuing proc
esses of American diplomacy to carry on unchanged by personal
destinies."
