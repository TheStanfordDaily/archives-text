What Are Fraternity Values?
Editor, The Daily:
Just what are the values that
the fraternity man is seeking and
why is he unable to find these
valeus outside of his tightly arti
ficial environment ? This environ
ment serves three functions: it
provides prestige for the individ
ual, secondly the fraternity pro
vides for an assurance of mascu
linity for its members, and lastly
creates a highly shallow system
in which each individual member
can guiltlessly violate the canons
of society by dissolving self-re
sponsibility.
The TFC article would have us
believe that a person must either
belong to a small tightly-knit
group or a large heterogeneous
one. What ever happened to t he
mature individual who may be
long to any number of groups
both large and small without los
ing his autonomy and becoming
subservient to an external scale
of goals and values? . . .
Is belonging to an exclusive so
cial group good per se when the
underlying reason for belonging
is a need for security? This need
causes individuals, unable to find
security within themselves, to
identify with a superior heritage.
How does a person who is RE
QUIRED to get along with his
fellows develop social ease? All
that this REQUIRED friendship
could spawn is the two-faced hy
pocrisy that runs rampant on our
campus.
Row men dominate the intellec
tual, physical and governmental
aspects of our campus (save pos
sibly The Daily); is a power elite
representing a student minority

necessarily good? . . .
The foundations for fraternal
brotherhood at Stanford lie in ex-1
clusiveness, prestige, status, arti
ficial masculinity and an absurd
and arbitrary claim to elite mem
bership.

Editor, The Daily:
To the editorial board of the
new Scratch Sheet I express my
disappointment over an important
omission in the coverage of the
history department. The Scratch
Sheet evaluates History 130 and
IS3, courses which presume a
background in their respective
fields. Such a background usual
ly familiarizes students with the
department's courses and the
teaching abilities of the various
professors.
However, the Scratch Sheet ig
nored History 122 (America Since
1890), a penetrating and stimulat
ing survey course offered by Dr.
Pease. As History 122 is a survey
course, students are less likely to i
be familiar with the competence!
of its teacher and the depth of the
course.

What Are Fraternity Values?
Editor, The Daily:
Just what are the values that
the fraternity man is seeking and
why is he unable to find these
valeus outside of his tightly arti
ficial environment ? This environ
ment serves three functions: it
provides prestige for the individ
ual, secondly the fraternity pro
vides for an assurance of mascu
linity for its members, and lastly
creates a highly shallow system
in which each individual member
can guiltlessly violate the canons
of society by dissolving self-re
sponsibility.
The TFC article would have us
believe that a person must either
belong to a small tightly-knit
group or a large heterogeneous
one. What ever happened to t he
mature individual who may be
long to any number of groups
both large and small without los
ing his autonomy and becoming
subservient to an external scale
of goals and values? . . .
Is belonging to an exclusive so
cial group good per se when the
underlying reason for belonging
is a need for security? This need
causes individuals, unable to find
security within themselves, to
identify with a superior heritage.
How does a person who is RE
QUIRED to get along with his
fellows develop social ease? All
that this REQUIRED friendship
could spawn is the two-faced hy
pocrisy that runs rampant on our
campus.
Row men dominate the intellec
tual, physical and governmental
aspects of our campus (save pos
sibly The Daily); is a power elite
representing a student minority

necessarily good? . . .
The foundations for fraternal
brotherhood at Stanford lie in ex-1
clusiveness, prestige, status, arti
ficial masculinity and an absurd
and arbitrary claim to elite mem
bership.

Editor, The Daily:
To the editorial board of the
new Scratch Sheet I express my
disappointment over an important
omission in the coverage of the
history department. The Scratch
Sheet evaluates History 130 and
IS3, courses which presume a
background in their respective
fields. Such a background usual
ly familiarizes students with the
department's courses and the
teaching abilities of the various
professors.
However, the Scratch Sheet ig
nored History 122 (America Since
1890), a penetrating and stimulat
ing survey course offered by Dr.
Pease. As History 122 is a survey
course, students are less likely to i
be familiar with the competence!
of its teacher and the depth of the
course.
