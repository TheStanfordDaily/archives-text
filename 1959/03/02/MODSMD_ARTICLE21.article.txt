# Critic Has Advice for Writers: "Write and Get It Published"
## 
### Diana Smith Managing Editor 
"My advice to young writers is
to write as much as possible and
'o get it published. That is why
I like to see college literary mag
azines and 'little' magazines."
Malcolm Cowley, literary critic
visiting Stanford to teach in the
English department this quarter,
reflected in his office the other
afternoon on how young writers
can best serve their apprentice
ship.
He began a recollection of past
possibilities with the country
weeklies of the last century,
which, he said, helped develop
some of our best stylists. In the
nineties, he continued, young
writers went to work on city
newspapers, where they got a lot
of e x p e r ie n c e writing, mostly
facts. Many of these became nat
uralists, he added.
"Then came a marvelous period
in the 192(J's when a writer, if lie
was lucky, could live on publish
ers' advances."
The well-spoken of first novel
of the '30's often sent its author
to Hollywood, Cowley chuckled,
but if that novel was badly spoken
of he joined the Federal Writers'
Project.
"Now, all that has disap
peared." He observed that most
young writers now probably com
bine their craft with university
teaching. He had some doubt's
about that, musing it was probab
ly a worse apprenticeship for nov
elists than for poets and critics,
as the kind of experience readily
accessible in a university "is per
haps of too specialized a kind."
"Of course, today there are
more fellowships and prizes being
offered than ever before."
We suggested that the current
book market is far more receptive
to non-fiction than to fiction;
Cowley replied by wondering why
young fiction writers don't take
advantage of that and write more
non fiction.
We inquired about his own lit

erary apprenticeship. As a col
lege senior, he replied, he did
some book reviewing for the
"New Review. I'hat was very
funny later when I was working
for the magazine because 1 would
n't accept any college book re
views"— he paused for the expect
ed "Why not?" — "because they
weren't good enough!"
He went on to say that later he
did eopyreading and editing for
an architectural catalogue until
he felt he'd made enough connec
tions to try free lance.
He pursued the matter of criti
cal and creative writing: "I think
a writei' has to have his critical

and creative powers developed as
far as they will go." Noting that
the trouble only comes when a
writer gets too much of one, he
asserted that for nine-tenths of
young writers the trouble is apt
to be criticism. He clarified that:
"They lack a critical sense as ap
plied to their own work."
"The tenth has a critical sense
developed out of proportion to his
creative power's." He added that
these would do better to avoid
criticism of contemporary writers
—"If I were a collego writer I
would do my close analysis on
Shakespeare or Milton, not .1. D.
Salinger."
