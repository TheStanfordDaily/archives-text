1 rroneous Arguments
tt.lilor, The Daily:
The arguments Mr. Long pre
sents supporting loyalty oaths are
erroneous and/or irrelevant. Mr.
Long confuses "to have the right
to" with "right" and "wrong." I
have the light to destroy my pos
sessions, hut this does not make
it right to do so. A government
is not a person, and does not have
rights. A government should
serve the people, not vice versa.
Universities exist not to fill cer
tain strategic (even military) po
sitions, hut to enable people bet
ter to contribute to humanity. All
progress results from research so
basic that loyalty oaths or secu
rity clearances relating to it are
nonsense obvious even to the un
intelligent.
Narrow applications (as mili
tary) must always be secondary
to research, since they cannot ex
ist without it. Universities should
not support the implication of
loyalty oaths that narrow applica
tions and strategic military posi
tions are primary.
You cannot buy loyalty by loan
ing money. You cannot legislate
perfection. The government will
not collapse if a few "disloyal"
people are educated? If people are
educated, there is always the
chance they will not think exactly
alike. May I suggest this is great
ly to be desired?

tt.lilor, The Daily:
The arguments Mr. Long pre
sents supporting loyalty oaths are
erroneous and/or irrelevant. Mr.
Long confuses "to have the right
to" with "right" and "wrong." I
have the light to destroy my pos
sessions, hut this does not make
it right to do so. A government
is not a person, and does not have
rights. A government should
serve the people, not vice versa.
Universities exist not to fill cer
tain strategic (even military) po
sitions, hut to enable people bet
ter to contribute to humanity. All
progress results from research so
basic that loyalty oaths or secu
rity clearances relating to it are
nonsense obvious even to the un
intelligent.
Narrow applications (as mili
tary) must always be secondary
to research, since they cannot ex
ist without it. Universities should
not support the implication of
loyalty oaths that narrow applica
tions and strategic military posi
tions are primary.
You cannot buy loyalty by loan
ing money. You cannot legislate
perfection. The government will
not collapse if a few "disloyal"
people are educated? If people are
educated, there is always the
chance they will not think exactly
alike. May I suggest this is great
ly to be desired?
