# Neumann, Haga Brilliant As Cards Post Two Wins
## 
### Steve Baffrey Bob Payne 
Dick Haga smilingly stepped to
Ihe free throw line with no time
showing on the clock and pushed
in a single gift toss that gave
Stanford a 59-58 victory over last
place Washington State Friday in
the season's tightest basketball
thriller.
The senior Card center dropped
in the winner after time was out,
following a last-second foul by
YVSU's Duane Ranninger.
Arrillagu Misses
Stanford had worked the ball
for a last-second shot after foil
ing tho Cougars' attempt at the
same. John Arrillaga made the
attempt and missed, but Haga
was fouled in the rebound melee
by Kanniger, the Pacific Coast
Conference's top hatchet man.
But Ranniger could hardly be
called the goat. The 6-4 junior
pumped in 16 points to pace the
Cougar attack, hitting on seven
of eight tries from the field. Just
when the Cards .were showing
signs of pulling away in the sec
ond half, Ranniger went wild,
pouring in six straight field goals
to tighten things up again.
Cougars Start Fast
WSU Mhe school is now offi
cially Washington St ato Univer
sity) jumped off to a 12-2 lead in
the opening minutes on the shoot
ing of forward Dick Axelson and
hooking center John Maras.
The Cards battled back to make
it close and trailed by one, 2H-27,
at intermission.
Paul Neumann remedied that
situation before the second half
had barely started. The Indian
great potted two of his patented
jumpers before the Cougars had
found their basket and Stanford
maintained a slim lead through
out the half.
Ne u m a n n finished with 22
points, to 13 for Haga.

A week and a home court make
a lot of difference in basketball,
and Stanford's Indians will attest
to that fact after their 85-74 win
over Southern California's Tro
jans Saturday night in the Pavil
ion,
Just a week earlier in the
Southland Ihe Injuns couldn't get
going aiul dropped a 71-52 encoun
ter to the Trojans.
Guard Paul Neumann, who
piled up a pace-setting 26 points
in the tussle and never looked bet
ter all season, led the Red and
White victory train which hasn't
run smoother at any point in Ihe
earn paign.
II in a ltow
It was the Indians' 14th straight
victory over two seasons in the
Pavilion.
Dick Haga pushed the first
points of the game home in the
opening seconds when he tapped
in an attempt by Neumann which
had gone astray. From that point
on the Indians held the upper
hand.
Despite the efforts of three men
in double figures the Trojans
couldn't make the deficit. For
wards Jim White and Johnny
Werhas dropped in 16 and 15
points respectively, and guard
Bill Bloom matched White for
visitors' honors with 16.
Many Fouls
Fifty-four fouls were called in
the contest, which approached
rough-and-tumble proportions at
times. Card center Dick Haga
fouled out of the contest, as did
four of Ihe Trojans, White,
Bloom, guard Steve Kemp and
center Bob Hampton.
llaga grabbed off 12 points and
picked up help from Neumann,
Jerry Rose and Jerry Thuesen to
lead the Indians to their 37-33
half time spread. Haga added six
more in the second half to come
out with 18.
But it was Neumann's 18-point
second half which highlighted the
evening. The senior, who is now
just 24 points away from a 1000
total for his varsity career, hit
on every shot in the books to
climb to I he game high.
Three Misses
And even at that, the usual
dead eye from the gift toss line
flubbed three tries.
Percentages from thp floor
were 45 for Stanford, 37 for SC.
