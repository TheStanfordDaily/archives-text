# Reed Wins Net Crown
## 
### 
Whitney Reed, a tennis player
with an unusual but effective
style, captured the Northern Cali
fornia Intercollegiate singles ten
nis championship and led his San
Jose State net team to the North
ern California team title".
Reed thrilled a large gallery at
the Stanford tennis courts with a
variety of top-spin volley shots
and side-spin drop shots to push
his way through the semifinal
and final rounds of the tourna
ment on Friday and Saturday.
Friday, Reed disposed of Stan
ford's Dick Ogden 6-2, 6-4. Ogden
played a fine game but the husky
Reed kept the Stanford netter
running all over the court, and
finally wore Ogden down.
On Saturday, Reed defeated his
SJS teammate Jim Watson in
straight sets, 6-2, 10-8.
The San Jose Spartans captured
the team title from Stanford,
which had held the title the last
two years, by the margin of two
points. The clinchers for San Jose
came Friday when Jim Watson
defeated Dave Nelson in the sin
gles semifinals 6-4, 86, and the
San Jose doubles team of Reed
and Bob Hill whipped Stanford's
Lowell Carruth and Jim Jeffries
6-4, 6-4. .
Stanford, although beaten in
Ihe team competition, did gain
some solace when its top doubles
team of Dick Ogden and Dave
Nelson ripped through two San
Jose teams to gain the doubles
crown.
