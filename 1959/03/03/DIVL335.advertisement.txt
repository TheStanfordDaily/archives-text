A Stanford student said the other
day:
"Why should I consider buying
lifo c iinwp Why nnt
wjit until I'm out of college earn
ing some rrnl money? Besides,
why buy life insurance now to
'protect' a future wife and chil
dren? I'm single and my parents
don't need the protection. The
rates don't go up very rapidly at
my age anyhow. There's plenty
of time to insure myself a few
years from now when I'm cstcib- j
lished."
Wc believe fli.it Stanford student
overlooked a few facts:
Insurability is a precious quality.
You CANNOT count on passing
a physical examination for life in
surance "any old time." Ask any
doctor. Without insurability you
may face an "agonizing reap
praisal" of your financial future.
Will your future work carry a pre
mium bccausc of extra hazards?
As a student you may be able to i
buy insurance at minimum rates
now.
We realize that most students
have limited funds. Under our
personal arrangement this prob
lem may be solved. Send us a
note or telephone us to get the
details.
