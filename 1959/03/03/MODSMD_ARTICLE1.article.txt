## 
### 
MOSCOW (/!') The Soviet Union agreed Monday to a foreign min
isters' conference on West Berlin and a German peace treaty though
stressing that it would still prefer summit talks.
A friendly windup to British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's
mission to Moscow attended the dispatch of Soviet notes to the West-

ern Big Three and West .Germany
on these chief problems of the
cold war.
The Kremlin assented to West
ern proposals for a conference in
Vienna or Geneva and suggested
it start in April with a time limit
df two or three months for com
plot ion of its work.
Deadline Scrapped
Western diplomats said the pro
posal showed the Soviet Union
lias long since scrapped May 27
as an absolute deadline for settle
ment of the West Berlin question,
The suggestion for such a long
period of negotiation was de
scribed by one Western diplomat
as "the one encouraging section
of the note."
The notes proposed that the
government chiefs get together
on the ground that a summit
meeting has "the greatest chance
of achieving positive results."
But if the West is not yet ready
for that, the notes said, foreign
ministers of the Big Four powers,
plus Communist Poland and Cze
choslovakia, could be called at the
same time and place. Diplomats
expected there would be no West
ern objection to inclusion of Po
land and Czechoslovakia, allies of
the Russians in the Warsaw Pact.
East, West Invited
The Kremlin agreed with a
Western suggestion that repre
sentatives of West and East Ger
many should sit in.
Washington showed no enthusi
asm for Russia's insistence on a
later summit conference—unless
substantial progress is made by
the foreign ministers in settling
German problems.
The Stale Department withheld
all comment on Russia's new
note. Authoritative officials, how
ever, viewed it as moving the
Kremlin only a few inches toward
the Western position, because of
the conditions Moscow attached.
