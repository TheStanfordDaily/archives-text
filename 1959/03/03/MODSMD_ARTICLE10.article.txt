# Health Service Will Dispense Vaccine Today
## 
### 
The entire facilities of the
Health Service will be opened to
day between 9:3<) a.m. and 4:30
p.m. in an effort to see that the
entire c a m p us is vaccinated
against the Asian flu that is due
to strike during dead and finals
weeks.
"II is impossible to predict, with
any degree of accuracy, if and
when an epidemic of influenza
will strike the Stanford campus,"
said Dr. George 11. Houck, direc
tor, Student Health Service.
England Epidemic,
Pointing out that an influenza
epidemic is now prevalent in Eng
land, Dr. Ilouck stressed the im
portance of being prepared should
this epidemic spread to the United
Statc-s.
"Our problem here at Stanford
is one of preparedness," said Dr.
Houck, "since our average stu
dent has little or no immunity to
the disease. Many students have
n<>l been immunized for influenza
since the Asian flu epidemic in
1057. These students need 'booster
â€¢shots' as do those who were im
munized as recently as six months
ago."
Over 65 Per Cent in 1957
Over 65 per cent of the student
body was affected by (he Asian
flu in 1957 according to the Health
Service.
Students who have been immu
nized for influenza last fall will
need only one "booster shot" to
bring up I heir level of immunity.
Those who have not been immu
nized during 1957-58 will need two
inject ions.


CHECK THAT REACTION
It's from a flu shot
