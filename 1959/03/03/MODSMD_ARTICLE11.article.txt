# Cellar Conversion Plan Closer to Action Stage
## Dancing Area Will Replace Present Rear Dining Room 
### 
Approval of a Legislature committee proposal to convert the Cellar
reai - dining room to bo used for dancing has been given by the Santa
Clara County Fire Department.
The approval was made with tho condition that a second door be
added a change which should have been made long ago to meet slate

law. California fire regulations
state that any area of public as
semblage with an occupancy over
50 must have two exits, but for
some reason "the Cellar was nev
er inspected before," according to
County Fire Marshal Bruce Wig
gins.
This change was proposed re
cently in a report prepared by a
Legislature committee under
chairman Dave Bess. The "Cellar
Improvement Project" has been
submitted to the Union Board of
Directors, but as yet no action has
been taken.
Citing the Jack of adequate so
cial facilities on the campus, the
report stated the need should be
met now rather than wait for the
new Union.
Place for Fun
The committee requested "an
atmosphere conducive to relaxa
tion and fun; fountain facilities
for the refreshments and kitchen
facilities for light service such as
hamburgers and sandwiches; a
juke box and dancing area; and
service over the weekend."
The major proposal is the con
version of the dining room in the
rear of the Cellar - to be used for
dancing during the evening. The
center booths would be removed,
and perhaps a movable partition
would be installed to separate
this area from the main room.
This loom would only have a ca
pacity of about 25 couples, how
ever.
A second proposal is lo keep
the Cellar open Friday and Sat
urday evenings until midnight
and Sunday evenings until at
least 10:30. The University is on
a 40-hour week, and at present the
Cellar closes at 10:30 p.m. Mon
day through Thursday, 7 p.m. on
Friday, 5 p.m. on Saturday, and
is closed all day Sunday.
More Foods
Other suggestions arc the addi
tion of such foods as French fried
potatoes and better condiments
for sandwiches, and softer light
ing.
There are still several problems
to lie solved before approval can
be made, a pr imary one being em
ployment. Miss Christine Flicker,
dining hall director, pointed out
that the proposed hours would
add a total of approximately 110
man-hours, and that special diffi
cutties are involved irr getting
anyone to work late at night and
on Sunday.
Business Manager - Larry Kelley
said that one suggestion is to not
serve dinner and close for a pe
riod in the late afternoon, but
that other- suggestions are invited.
