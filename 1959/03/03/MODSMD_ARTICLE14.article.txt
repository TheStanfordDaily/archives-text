an active cultural exchange was
built up.
Under the advisership of Witold

committee lias maintained an ex
change of books and magazines
and has conducted discussions.

sions were Studznicki, the Ford
scholar at Stanford, and Boguslav
(Slawek) Blasezyczyczn, the pres
ent ASSU scholar from the depart
ment of economics at the Univer
sity of Warsaw.
The committee urged juniors
and seniors interested in a year's
study in Poland to take advantage
of this opportunity. Tuition, board
and room, and spending money
will be provided. Applicants
should preferably have a back
ground in Russian and Polish lan
guages, mathematics and especial
ly international relations.
Applications may be obtained at
a committee meeting to be held at
the"I" Center at 5 p.m. today, or
