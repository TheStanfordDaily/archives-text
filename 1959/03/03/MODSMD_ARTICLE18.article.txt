## Macmillan's Talks with Mr. K 
### 
VVe do not as yet know what
caused Mr. Khrushchev to inter
rupt his confidential talks with
Mr. Macmillan in order to make a
public speech. But if the report is
correct that what he said about
Germany and European security
had been written out in advance,
then his speech was a calculated
diplomatic move—presumably lo
let the world know that he is not
discussing with Mi-. Macmillan
any serious change in the Soviet
position.
The way Mr. Macmillan has
been treated in Moscow is not a
good sign. For it is extraordinary
that Mi 1 . Khrushchev did not wait
until lie had finished his talks
with Mr. Macmillan. Why hp did
not wait, he alone knows. It may
have been that, for one reason or
another, he did not dare to let the
impression grow that he was on
the way to a negotiated compro
mise.
Overweening Confidence
This might be due to opposition
within the Kremlin; it might be
due to opposition within the Com
munist orbit. Or Mr. Khrushchev's
calculated breach of the confiden
tial talks with Mr. Macmillan may
be due to an overweening confi
dence that he is dealing from a
position of superior strength. We
du not know. But Mr. Macmillan
is bound to do his best to find out
in the talks which are still to
come.
In the meantime, it is only pru
dent to assume that Mr. Khru
shchev believes he is in the su
perior position, and then to ask
ourselves if indeed he is, and, if
so, what, we can do about it.
My own view, for what it is
worth, is that there is in the So
viet attitude a mixture of anxiety
and confidence. The ruling oli
garchy are, 1 think, deeply anx
ious about the position in East
Germany and in eastern Europe,
once the West German army is
completed and armed with nu
clear weapons.
Magnetic Attraction
It is not because they think that
West Germany can or will attack
the Soviet Union. It is because
they fear, not without reason, that
an armed West Germany will
have a magnetic attraction for the
underlying rebellion and resist
ance in eastern Europe.
The Kremlin is, therefore, under
great pressure to arrive at some
kind ot modus vivendi in the two
Germanys within the two years
that remain before the West Ger
rnans are fully armed.
Along with this anxiety there is
at the same time great confidence
— perhaps overconfidence that
in dealing with the German ques
tion the Soviet Union now holds
the stronger cards.
The Soviets' hand is strong be
cause they have the diplomatic
initiative. They can create situa
tions where—il it came to force—
the onus of firing the first shot
would be on the West and the ac
tual occasion lor firing would not

be good enough to rally the West
for a world war.
Pressure on West
Because the Russians have this
initiative, they can exercise pres
sure on the West. Unless they
overplay their hand, deliver a real
ultimatum and use military force
to blockade Berlin, there is much
reason to believe that the West
will feel impelled to look further

for a more negotiable position on
the two Germanys, on the two
Berlins arid on security arrange
ments in central Europe.
The weakness of the West is
I hat it has clung too long to its
old formula for Germany, and be
cause of that it has lost the initia
tive. Every time Ihe West re
appraises and revises in some
measure ihe old formula, it seems
to be retreating as in fact it is
and to be making a concession to
the Soviets.
Thus, any new idea becomes ap
peasement, and if by any chance
the Soviets have first mentioned
the idea, it becomes surrender.
T'his will go on until the West it
self seizes the initiative.
Seize Initiative
To seize the initiative would be
to test the Soviet proposals, not
by rejecting them but by asking
the Soviets searching questions as
to how in practice they would
carry out their proposals.
Thus, for example, Mr. K. says
that German reunification is a
problem not for the four Allies
but for the two Germanys. Does
he in fact mean this? Is he will
ing to let the two Germanys deal
with each other, and is he willing
to abide by the results?
If Dr. Adenauer could become
willing to make a move of this
kind, it would in some measure
reverse the field and restore the
initiative to the West.
