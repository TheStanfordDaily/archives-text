A groat deaJ of confusion has
surrounded the Los Altos party.
Not being a fraternity member, 1
hope to offer an objective evalua
tion of the situation.
All the participants' letters to
The Daily described the parly
as a fairly normal one antl were
seemingly sincere and honest.
Mot trusting these students'
views, however, the Dean's Of
fice felt it necessary to override
the IFCs decision.
Does this indicatp that the Uni
versity will allow the students to
govern themselves only when
their rulings agree with the ideas
of the Administration? Or did spe
cial circumstances motivate this
act ion?
Perhaps the University is right
in overriding the 1FC and making
a harsher ruling. But, as long as
this peculiar uncertainty concern
ing the facts of the party persists,
1 feel justified in seeking an ex
planation elsewhere. There are
two alternatives.
Possibly the action of the Dean's
Office was an attempt to reassure
the general public that the Uni
versity does not allow immorality
to run rampant.
The most probable explana
tion must be that the Adminis
tration has taken advantage of
a situation in which the facts of
the event are so uncertain that
it can hand down extremely
tough punitive measures with
out too much fear of being suc
cessfully condemned.
But why does 1 lie University
want to inflict such heavy penal
ties on fraternities? Three years
ago, when the cluster-housing pro
gram was proposed, few people
would deny that there were as
pects of fraternity life at Stanford
which were detrimental to the in
tellectual and social aims of the
University.
Wishing to get rid of these neg
ative aspects, the Administration
decided to bring the fraternities
more directly under its influence
and observation by slowly incor
porating them into the cluster pro
gram.
Disappointed at (he resultant
slowness of its program, the Ad
ministration has taken advan
tage of a situation which hap
pened to single out some of the
houses it felt were most unde
sirable, and used this event to
seriously undermine their
strength.
What living alternatives does

the Administration offer to re
place the autonomous fraternity?
Recognizing the shortcomings of
a merely functional approach to
campus livitrg, and hoping to real
ize the fruits of a fully developed
house system, the Administration
is in the process of changing its
housing program.
The new Stern wings and the
forthcoming decision to establish
permanent groups in the women's
dorms are evidences of the steps
taken in this direction. However,
Dr. Storre's recent article in Se
quoia points up the glaring in
adequacy of the Administration's
plans.
Despite the fact that it lacks
a fully-conceived house system,
the University is attempting
through the cluster-housing pro*
gram to place fraternities under
its protective wing. That is, it
plans to sacrifice the beneficial
aspects of other modes of living
without offering an adequate
substitute.
There is no doubt in my mind
that the Administration has a
moral obligation to inform the
student body of the actual intent
of its various policies. I hope it
will take this opportunity to state
unequivocally the purposes of its
housing program.
Nonetheless, a greater ques
tion remains. In formulating a
housing policy, why hasn't the
Administration consulted with
the students? There are cogent
reasons arguing that a housing
system, especially the abortive
one now being enacted, would
further standardize an already
dangerously uniform student
body.
I suggest that, the manifold mis
takes in planning that have al
ready been made ai*e due to the
Administration's failure to draw
upon the creative ideas and spe
cial insights which the students
have to offer on the housing pro
gram.
