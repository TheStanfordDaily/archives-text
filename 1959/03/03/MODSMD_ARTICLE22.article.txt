# The 						President's Report
## 
### John Bonn 
As the quar ter draws rapidly to
a close, a progress summary of
Legislature's action is in order.
We are presently negotiating
with the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce in an effort to allevi
ate some of the problems which
exist and to work out a closer,
more co-operative relationship be
tween the merchants and Stan
ford students.
It is our hope that through such
methods as placing a number of
students on the Chamber as stu
dent consultants and holding an
area Stanford Day at the begin
ning of the school year with all
stores holding open houses and
perhaps running special sales, stu
dents new to the area will be able
to locate stores, services and shop
ping areas. The details remain to
be worked out, but the Chamber
is very interested in the project
and supports the idea fully.
In the realm of the miscellane
ous, you might be interested that
the Cellar project is in the final
stages of planning. Dave Bess
submitted an excellent and com
prehensive report, on students'
opinions and suggestions and we
hope tf) have definite results soon.
A resolution was passed, after
extensive investigation, recom
mending that charge accounts be
permitted in the new Bookstore.
It was favorably received by the
manager, who said she would
take it up with the Bookstore
board of directors as soon as some
administrative problems could be
worked out.
On the administrative level,
Public Relations Board, under the

capable leadership of Nina Elkind
and Terry lienor, has undergone
a thorough revamping. It has
been suggested that Pub Rel un
dertake to send to each living
group a weekly notification of all
events which are to take place
during the week. We hope that
such a project would aid in solv
ing the communication problem
that all student organizations at
Stanford face.
John Richards, Election Com
mission chairman, has submitted
a by â€¢ law change which would
raise the allowed election expen
ditures for candidates for ASSU
president, vice-president and head
cheer leader to $50, more than
double what it is now. He feels
that it is a more realistic figure
and one which can be enforced
more rigorously.
I would be very interested in
your comment on this proposal,
for it marks a rather significant
change in election procedure.
Political Union Board, under its
new president Mike Haas, has
also been revamped thoroughly
with an idea to ;j more realistic
and serviceable scope of oper.i
tion. They are undertaking to
sponsor several name speakers
and place greater emphasis on po
litical information for the cam
pus.
One of Ihe most important
steps which the Legislature has
taken was the establishment of
the permanent Academic Commit
tee under the chairmanship of
Gail Greiner. Gail, who is ex of
ficio member of the President's
Committee on Academic Affairs,

is able to lie in the two bodies and
co-ordinate their actions.
The committee is at present
considering the possibility of
keeping the library open until 11
p.m.
We are hoping to establish oth
er special permanent committees
of Legislature, similar to the Aea
demic Committee, which will
eventually cover all phases of stu
dent life. By so doing we could
provide the students with an ex
pert group to which they could
bring their suggestions and from
which they could get informative
answers.
Next quarter we hope to bring
to fruition many of the projects
which we have begun and on
which we have been working. We
have been rewarded with excel
lent co-operation and interest
from the student body. We hope
it will continue.
