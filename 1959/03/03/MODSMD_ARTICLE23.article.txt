Daily sportswriter Stan llnleM traveled to Phoenix, Arizona,
last week to have a preseason look at tin' San Francisco (wants.
Th<* Wonder Hoys
Tho Wonder Boys of (he San Francisco Giants ai'O at it again.
Down in the "l.antl of (lie Sim," Phoenix, Arizona, the baseballers
are working tho kinks out of the muscles in preparation for their
second season on the West Coast.
After surprising many of the "experts" last year, the question
is if they can go even farther and take the National League flag.
Put even though it is too early to toll yet just what they will do, it
is certain that they should give the fans the same hrand of exciting
baseball that they gave them in the '58 season.
The BIG QUESTION for the Giants this season will be whether
Andre Rodgers can fill the shortstop spot vacated by the now second
sacker, Daryl Spencer. Spencer was shifted to second in hopes that
he could fill tin' void at that spot. If this keystone combination works
oid, it may change the picture for the Giants this season.
To all indications the Giants have helped the pitching situation
out greatly with the addition of John Fitzgerald, Jack Sant'ord, Frank
Funk, Marshall Kent'roe, Hilly Mulfett and Horn Zanni. The club
hopes lhat these new chuekers will be a helpful addition to the weak
pitching staff.
Talking with Paul Giel, Minnesota All-American footballer and
now Giant hurler, I found that he is very impressed with the brand
of college baseball played on the Pacific Coast. He said that the
weather was very advantageous here, and this was a definite help
iu producing good baseball teams.
The chunky righthander also said that college ball was n good
preparation for professional ball . . . but any way you look at it, the
jump to the pros is very hig and very tough.
Tho Golfers
Stu Miller, the little righthander from Massachusetts, said he had
not watched too much college ball here on the Coast, but he said the
back nine on the Stanford golf course is really tough. Miller, hurler
Mike McCorinick and third-sacker Jim Davenport, the "Peninsula
Trio," spent the winter playing golf on the area's courses to keep
themselves in shape.
Ilank Saner, starling his 22nd year of pro ball, said that he didn't
do "nothin'" during the winter. The big outfielder said that the old
bones had to rest during the winter in order to keep up with the
young fellows. Sauer, who will be *40 in March, started his ball play
ing in 1937, with Butler, Pennsylvania, and has played every year
since then.
Salty Parker, pinch hilling for Bill "Wired Jaw" Rigney, was very
impressed with the first workout, lie said that the boys did every
thing real well. Sally said that the main emphasis early in the year
would be 011 bunting. He said that everybody would spend part of
the workout on bunting, using the new method that Manager Rigney
wants to use.
Last of ihe Holdouts
The Giants are left with two holdouts, and one is a key man in
the Giatns' hopes. Al Worthington, tall righthander from Birming
ham, Alabama, and Vice-President Charles Feeney are to all indica
tions far apart on the contract terms. The Giants are counting on
Al to he their number one reliefer and quite possibly a starter, if
he can improve over last year.
The other remaining holdout in the Giant organization is Ramon
Monzant, the fiery hurelr from Venezuela. The front office has been
unable even to contact Mon/.ant, so the club doesn't even know what
terms he wants.
The Giant baseballers all appear to be in very good spirits. Out
fielders Willie Mays, Willie Kirkland, Felipe Alou, l.eon Wagner and
shortstop Andre Rodgers put on a little comedy show for the fans
after practice on Wednesday.
Down on the Stanford Sunken Diamond Saturday, the Indians
started off their season with a bang. Led by the hitting of the little
sophomore backstop, Mike Ma gee, Coach Dutch Fehring's boys
jumped on Cal Poly to the tune of 18-7.
