## Strong Finishes Highlight Trials DAILY Sports SCENE 
### Dick Barnes 
Down-to-the-wire battles in the
880, mile and 220 highlighted Sat-j
urday's Stanford winter track and
field championships the first
clock and tape test for Payton
Jordan and Jim Terrill's spikers i
this year.
Freshman Evangelos Depastas I
held off fast-closing Dick Lassen
to win the half in 1:53.8. Lassen
was only two-tenths behind, and
showed perhaps his best-ever clos
ing kick.
Bertil Lundh, sophomore trans
fer from Norway, pulled ahead of
Keith Wallace on the final lap to
win a 4:14.9 mile. Wallace was
six tenths back, four-tenths ahead
of Ernie Cunliffe, who hung on
doggedly all the way.
Surprise Winner
Surprise winner of thie furlong
was freshman Larry Fischer, who
turned in an excellent 22.0. Soph
omore Bob Obear and senior Ben
Anixter were second and third,
also credited with 22.0 in the
blanket finish.
Most of the feared weak spots
showed themselves to be just
that, at least on a basis of Satur
day's returns. Jim Korth's 189-9
was the best javelin mark as Jim
Baekstrand, normally the top
man, fouled on six of seven
t brows.
Paid Gillespie and John Nourse
could negotiate only 6-0 in the
high jump as freshmen Rune En
gebretsen and Marlin Walling tied
at 0-2. The best that came of the
high hurdles was a 15.7 by Boh
Martin, with Nourse another
tenth back.
Dean Smith lost his experimen
tal 220 lows race to John Kelly by
a tenth in 2-1.5. Smith was also
upset in ihe 100, where Anixter
won by a nose in 10.0.
Monzingo Looks Good
Bob Monzingo had to set the
pace all the way in the two-mile,
but looked fairly good in a 9:37.0
effort. Bob Besse took the quar
ter in 49.8 after leader Norm
Lloyd dropped out at the 220 with
a muscle twinge.
Mike Franohetti and Dave Mer
chant tied at 13-0 in the pole vault.
Jerry Winters got off a 52-3 effort
in the shot-put, and freshman Don
Bell won the discus at 156-1 WÂ±.
Armand DeWeese and Harlin
Limmer were each only a bit
more than a foot back of Bell.
Kelly got off an early leap of
22-9% to win the broad jump. Out
of the competition for a variety

of reasons were Don Ghesarek,
Skip Pace, Brooks Townsend and
Doug Martin.
Jordan commented after the
meet that every man on the team
was in need of plenty of sprint
ing and sharpening work.
ltelay Action
Pesse turned in the best relay
leg of the flay, a 41).4, as he led
the team of Dick Parker, Besse,
Lassen and Cunliffe to a 3:21.2
win in the mile event.
Smith, Dick Fink, Obear and
Denny Valentine combined talents
in iho 'HO relay for a -l.'i.H victory.
They heat a team of Parker, Ghris
Hungerland, Jerry Kamansky and
Anixter by four-tenths.
In the feature weight men's
440 relay, Bell, Tom Lagerquist,
Korth and Bob Atkinson beat Do-
Weese, Backstrand, Dimmer and
Winters hy a second in 47. (>.
