Illustrating his last night's lec
ture with personal past experi
ences, visiting English Professor-
Malcolm Cowley stressed the im
portance of "little magazines" in
college writing.
Reminiscing on the "golden age
of undergraduate journalism" of
the '20's, Cowley related his expe
riences on the numerous and suc
cessful periodicals of the time.
Besides presenting the literary
works of the day, the Harvard
publications to which he contrib
uted were also fairly selective so
cial organizations, fulfilling a
missing social need for their all
male staffs.
Cowley played up the impor
tance of business staffs and alum
ni in gaining money for the publi
cations, and expressed his concern
in the lack of these tactics by
members of Stanford's "Sequoia"
staff.
While in Europe during the ear
ly years of his literary associa
tions, the "litllc magazines" wore
appearing in great numbers on
both continents. Publishing costs
were low and contributions nu
merous, but financial success un
certain.
Cheap hotel suites often proved
the most accommodating offices
for the ambitious staff members,
as they often published after a
single day's writing.
Reading and getting published
are the most necessary moves of
the college writer today, said
Cowley. Experience and a basic
knowledge of punctuation and
spelling make the college writer
of today the modern writer of to
morrow.
