# Juno II Blasts Off For Sun
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (/P)
A thundering Juno II rocket
fired aloft today carrying space
probe Pioneer IV toward the
moon and the sun. All four
stages of the vehicle ignited suc
cessfully.
The smooth performance of the
76 â€¢ foot launching rocket meant
that a 13-pound gold-plated probe
is free and soaring through space
alone.
The mission of Army scientists
was to hurl Pioneer IV past the
moon, 221,000 miles away, in 34
hours and finally into a solar
orbit a half - million miles from
earth.
Officials announced some 10
minutes after the spectacular
blast-off at 12:10.30 a.m. EST
(9:10.30 p.m. PSTi that all four
stages had ignited. Thus the
launching had been accomplished.
It was the second Army shot al
the moon and beyond, a feat the
Soviets claim they accomplished
with their 1 Va-ton Mechta probe
Jan. 4.
Pioneer IV is a conical-shaped
orb loaded with instrumentation
to measure two doughnut shaped
radiation fields that pose a threat
to manned space travel.
The first 1 minutes were criti
cal for the bullet-shaped Juno 11,
a modified Jupiter intermediate
range ballistic missile topped by
three stages of spinning Sergeant
rockets. The whole assembly as
it left the earth was 70 feet long
and weighed about GO tons with
its fuel.
