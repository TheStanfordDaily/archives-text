# Shakes Plague Campus Life
## 
### 
The Stan 112 or d campus was
plagued by two cases of "the
shakes" yesterday afternoon.
Workmen and their jaekham
mors caused three University fii-e
department engines and the fire
chief's car to answer an alarm at
Wilbur Hall at p.m.
While digging a ditch to extend
electricity to the married students'
housing area, the vibrations of the
.jackhammering tripped the alarm
box.
At. 3:27 p.m. Stanford felt a
strong earthquake centered about
80 miles north of campus.
Don Tocher, University of C;di
fornia seismologist, reported to
The Daily via telephone that the
rolling quake had a Richter mag
nitude of 5.5 on the university's
seismograph, as compared to the
190f) San Francisco 'quake's 8.25.
Yesterday's earthquake kepi the
seismograph needle quivering for
12 minutes.
