# COMMUNIST EXCHANGE STUDENT
## Pole Comments on Homeland 
### Stove Kanne 
Karl Schindzielorz, a former chairman <»112
the ZMP (Polish Communist Youth Group)
at Ihc University of Warsaw and presently
a Ford Foundation Scholar, moved into
Crothers Hall last week to complete a nine
month visit in this country before return
ing to his native country in June.
The Pole who fit 22 is a practicing jour
nalisl for- "Warsaw Lite," a non partisan
newspaper in his nation's capital, arrived
in New York in September, 1958, and spent
his first four months ;it Cornell University,
Ithaca, New York, before coming to Stan
ford.
"Since my arrival," he noled, "112 have had
a chance to visit a good part of your coun
try. I spent some lime in the coal mining
region near Scranton, Pennsylvania, and
also attended the International Students'
Seminar in Miami, Florida, during Christ
inas vacation.
Polish Activities
"Our nation is very athletic. Mu<*h of our
free time is spent outdoors. Kvery year the
workers take a two or three-week vacation
in the mountains or at the seaside spon
sored hy the labor unions.
"At first the people didn't like the idea
of doing anything sponsored hy the state,
but now they have grown to enjoy these
vacations.
"The state-owned operas and theaters are
also very popular. Tickets are controlled

by (he labor unions and I hey are usually
sold out to tho workers.
Commenting upon the degree of freedom
of expression which has existed in Poland
since I lie Poznan riots and Anti-Stalin Party
Congress of 19r>(i, the young writer noted
that there seemed to tie no great difference
between newspapers in America and those
in Poland.
"You see," he slated, "even iti my work
we are free to say what we like 'within Ihe
framework in which we operate.' I am al
liberty to criticize any bureaucratic or eco
nomic condition which I find undesirable.
Hut generally when I do so, I attempt to
offer a substitute suggestion in its place."
Tarty Membership
Karl is a Communist, but he is not a
party member. Though he admitted that,
for those who have political aspirations
party membership is advantageous, he also
pointed out that HO of the 110 governmental
representatives and several ministers were
not party members.
"Our brand of Communism differs from
that in Russia. There tho Communist Party
is the leader of the nation. It makes the
basic decisions in governing.
"But in Poland the people have influenced
the government's policies. Several years
ago travel abroad was restricted to a very
few. However, owing to pressures brought
to bear by the newspapers and |he public,
passport regulations were relaxed. Last
year over 230,000 Poles traveled abroad."

Karl had little to say about the Hungarian
Revolution or the imprisonment and brain
washing of Josef Cardinal Mindszcnty.
"We had reporters on ihe scene during
the Hungarian revolt, but the Mindszcnty
episode was of little interest to our read
ers. That was an internal affair of Hun
gary's."
Schindzielorz's parents are both Catholics,
but he, like most other Communists, is an
atheist, lie finds religion concerned with
what he considers to be a spiritual and un
realistic approach to life.
Stalin's Fall
In the course of his discussion it appeared
that the greatest conflict which Commu
nism has forced him to reconcile was the
sudden switch in the party line from wor
ship to abhorrence of Stalin.
"This was something we were laugh) to
believe," he said. "It was difficult for me
and the others to discover that what we had
accepted as the truth for so many years
was no longer the truth."
Karl said that Khrushchev's speech came
as such a shock to him that voluntarily he
and the other leaders of the Polish Commit
nist Youth group decided to disband the
organization.
Karl, who already has a master's degree
in journalism, will work toward a Ph.D.
while here al Stanford. Ho will eventually
receive this degree from the University ol
Warsaw.

Karl Schindzielorz, a former chairman <»112
the ZMP (Polish Communist Youth Group)
at Ihc University of Warsaw and presently
a Ford Foundation Scholar, moved into
Crothers Hall last week to complete a nine
month visit in this country before return
ing to his native country in June.
The Pole who fit 22 is a practicing jour
nalisl for- "Warsaw Lite," a non partisan
newspaper in his nation's capital, arrived
in New York in September, 1958, and spent
his first four months ;it Cornell University,
Ithaca, New York, before coming to Stan
ford.
"Since my arrival," he noled, "112 have had
a chance to visit a good part of your coun

"The state-owned operas and theaters are

Commenting upon the degree of freedom
of expression which has existed in Poland
since I lie Poznan riots and Anti-Stalin Party
Congress of 19r>(i, the young writer noted
that there seemed to tie no great difference
between newspapers in America and those
in Poland.
"You see," he slated, "even iti my work
we are free to say what we like 'within Ihe
framework in which we operate.' I am al
liberty to criticize any bureaucratic or eco
nomic condition which I find undesirable.

offer a substitute suggestion in its place."
Tarty Membership
Karl is a Communist, but he is not a
party member. Though he admitted that,
for those who have political aspirations
party membership is advantageous, he also
pointed out that HO of the 110 governmental
representatives and several ministers were
not party members.
"Our brand of Communism differs from
that in Russia. There tho Communist Party
is the leader of the nation. It makes the
basic decisions in governing.
"But in Poland the people have influenced
the government's policies. Several years
ago travel abroad was restricted to a very
few. However, owing to pressures brought
to bear by the newspapers and |he public,
passport regulations were relaxed. Last
year over 230,000 Poles traveled abroad."

Karl had little to say about the Hungarian
Revolution or the imprisonment and brain
washing of Josef Cardinal Mindszcnty.
"We had reporters on ihe scene during
the Hungarian revolt, but the Mindszcnty
episode was of little interest to our read
ers. That was an internal affair of Hun

Schindzielorz's parents are both Catholics,

atheist, lie finds religion concerned with
what he considers to be a spiritual and un
realistic approach to life.
Stalin's Fall
In the course of his discussion it appeared
that the greatest conflict which Commu

sudden switch in the party line from wor

that the greatest conflict which Commu
nism has forced him to reconcile was the
sudden switch in the party line from wor
ship to abhorrence of Stalin.
"This was something we were laugh) to
believe," he said. "It was difficult for me
and the others to discover that what we had
accepted as the truth for so many years
was no longer the truth."
Karl said that Khrushchev's speech came
as such a shock to him that voluntarily he
and the other leaders of the Polish Commit
nist Youth group decided to disband the
organization.
Karl, who already has a master's degree
in journalism, will work toward a Ph.D.
while here al Stanford. Ho will eventually
receive this degree from the University ol
Warsaw.
Karl Schindzielorz, a former chairman <»112
the ZMP (Polish Communist Youth Group)
at Ihc University of Warsaw and presently
a Ford Foundation Scholar, moved into
Crothers Hall last week to complete a nine
month visit in this country before return
ing to his native country in June.
The Pole who fit 22 is a practicing jour
nalisl for- "Warsaw Lite," a non partisan
newspaper in his nation's capital, arrived
in New York in September, 1958, and spent
his first four months ;it Cornell University,
Ithaca, New York, before coming to Stan
ford.
"Since my arrival," he noled, "112 have had
a chance to visit a good part of your coun
try. I spent some lime in the coal mining
region near Scranton, Pennsylvania, and
also attended the International Students'
Seminar in Miami, Florida, during Christ
inas vacation.
Polish Activities
"Our nation is very athletic. Mu<*h of our
free time is spent outdoors. Kvery year the
workers take a two or three-week vacation
in the mountains or at the seaside spon
sored hy the labor unions.
"At first the people didn't like the idea
of doing anything sponsored hy the state,
but now they have grown to enjoy these
vacations.
"The state-owned operas and theaters are
also very popular. Tickets are controlled

by (he labor unions and I hey are usually
sold out to tho workers.
Commenting upon the degree of freedom
of expression which has existed in Poland
since I lie Poznan riots and Anti-Stalin Party
Congress of 19r>(i, the young writer noted
that there seemed to tie no great difference
between newspapers in America and those
in Poland.
"You see," he slated, "even iti my work
we are free to say what we like 'within Ihe
framework in which we operate.' I am al
liberty to criticize any bureaucratic or eco
nomic condition which I find undesirable.
Hut generally when I do so, I attempt to
offer a substitute suggestion in its place."
Tarty Membership
Karl is a Communist, but he is not a
party member. Though he admitted that,
for those who have political aspirations
party membership is advantageous, he also
pointed out that HO of the 110 governmental
representatives and several ministers were
not party members.
"Our brand of Communism differs from
that in Russia. There tho Communist Party
is the leader of the nation. It makes the
basic decisions in governing.
"But in Poland the people have influenced
the government's policies. Several years
ago travel abroad was restricted to a very
few. However, owing to pressures brought
to bear by the newspapers and |he public,
passport regulations were relaxed. Last
year over 230,000 Poles traveled abroad."

Karl had little to say about the Hungarian
Revolution or the imprisonment and brain
washing of Josef Cardinal Mindszcnty.
"We had reporters on ihe scene during
the Hungarian revolt, but the Mindszcnty
episode was of little interest to our read
ers. That was an internal affair of Hun
gary's."
Schindzielorz's parents are both Catholics,
but he, like most other Communists, is an
atheist, lie finds religion concerned with
what he considers to be a spiritual and un
realistic approach to life.
