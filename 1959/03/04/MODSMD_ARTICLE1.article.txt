## Faculty Asking New Class Unit Concept 
### 
A new definition of the student credit unit was approved Monday
by the faculty of the School of Humanities and Sciences, and is now
awaiting University approval.
The resolution is as follows:
1. ''A unit of credit is to be regarded as representing three hours

of the student's time per week,
not necessarily including an hour
of class attendance.
2. "Four- and five-unit courses
are to be encouraged to meet only
three times a week and three-unit
classes twice a week, with an ap
propriate increase in emphasis on
work outside the classroom. It is
recognized that this plan may not
be suitable for all courses, e.g. in
troductory languages, mathemat
ics and laboratory courses.
3. "This change is to involve no
increase in the number of courses
taught by individual faculty mem
bers.
Amount of Work
4. "All faculty members in Hu
manities and Sciences should re
examine the amount of work ex
pected of students in the light of
the proposed definition of a unit
of credit."
This proposal was initiated by
the General Studies Committee
and recommended to the faculty
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences by the executive com
mittee of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences in an effort to
encourage fewer class hours and
allow more time for 1 outside work
by students.
Dean of School of Humanities
and Sciences Philip 11. Rhineland
er explained that section two of
the proposal, regarding the num
ber of hours per week of class
meetings, is a recommendation to
individual faculty members and
not a requirement of them. t
The meeting also approved the
following statement concerning
auditing, which is also now sub
ject to University approval:
Course Auditing
"Any full-time student in the
University has the privilege of
auditing any lecture course in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences provided only that seats are
available in the classroom. How
ever, students are not entitled to
audit discussion, laboratory or
performance courses in which
they are not regularly enrolled
except by express consent of the
instructor."
Rhinelander said that this pro
posal is an attempt to clarify
present practices of auditing.

the proposal, regarding the num
ber of hours per week of class
meetings, is a recommendation to
individual faculty members and
not a requirement of them. t
The meeting also approved the
following statement concerning
auditing, which is also now sub
ject to University approval:
Course Auditing
"Any full-time student in the
University has the privilege of
auditing any lecture course in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences provided only that seats are
available in the classroom. How
ever, students are not entitled to
audit discussion, laboratory or
performance courses in which
they are not regularly enrolled
except by express consent of the
instructor."
Rhinelander said that this pro
posal is an attempt to clarify
present practices of auditing.
A new definition of the student credit unit was approved Monday
by the faculty of the School of Humanities and Sciences, and is now
awaiting University approval.
The resolution is as follows:
1. ''A unit of credit is to be regarded as representing three hours

of the student's time per week,
not necessarily including an hour
of class attendance.
2. "Four- and five-unit courses
are to be encouraged to meet only
three times a week and three-unit
classes twice a week, with an ap
propriate increase in emphasis on
work outside the classroom. It is
recognized that this plan may not
be suitable for all courses, e.g. in
troductory languages, mathemat
ics and laboratory courses.
3. "This change is to involve no
increase in the number of courses
taught by individual faculty mem
bers.
Amount of Work
4. "All faculty members in Hu
manities and Sciences should re
examine the amount of work ex
pected of students in the light of
the proposed definition of a unit
of credit."
This proposal was initiated by
the General Studies Committee
and recommended to the faculty
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences by the executive com
mittee of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences in an effort to
encourage fewer class hours and
allow more time for 1 outside work
by students.
