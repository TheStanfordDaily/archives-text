# Fraternity Alumni Want Answers on Cluster Plan
## Group Hopes to Meet With Administration Next Quarter 
### Jack Winkler, Associate Editor 
Alumni and undergraduate representatives from 19 fraternities
met last night in Bowman Alumni House to air their feelings about,
the University's fraternity "cluster" plan and came up with a list of
questions they plan to ask University officials at another meeting
early next quarter.
Opinion was divided, however, with some houses apparently going

ahead full speed with plans for
j construction.
In a talk yesterday with Tori
GiJdred, Sigma Nu, who presided
over the meeting, Dean of Men
William G. Craig said four houses
have almost raised the necessary
money and he hoped plans would
be drawn up in the fall and the
first cornerstone laid in Decem
ber.
New Group
The gathering was the first
meeting of the Interfraternity
Council Alumni Association. The
main questions unanswered in the
minds of alumni were (1) a pos
sible loss of individuality in a
four-house quadrangle arrange
ment.
(2) Would any structural
changes be possible in the plans
drawn up by the University, such
as sleeping porches or individual
kitchens? (3) What does the fra
ternity receive as a guarantee for
its money? A lease? (4) Is there
a possibility that Stanford will
fill up depleted houses with non
members to keep up the rent re
quirements or eventually take
over the buildings as regular
men's residences?
(5) What payment will be made
for the old houses? (6) Will the
University interfere with the con
stitutional restrictions some fra
ternities have on membership?
Three Approve
Representatives from three
houses, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Phi
Delta Theta and Kappa Sigma, all
of whom have raised a sizeable
proportion of the $110,000 con
struction cost, expressed enthusi
astic approval of the University
plan.
Their contention was that there
j was definitely a need for new
housing, they believed in the Uni
versity's good faith, and recog
nized that fraternities were at
Stanford only by the conscnt of
the Administration.
The specifies of the house struc
ture (chapter rooms, sleeping
porches, other than two-man
rooms), the alumnus of Phi Delta
Theta said, could only be worked
out when four houses, definitely
committed to building, actually
sat down with the architect to
draw plans.
Disagreement
The other houses voiced vary
ing amounts of displeasure with
the arrangement and hoped at
least to exert some pressure on
the University to assure details
in conformity with their concep
tion of fraternity life.
Two new developments came
out of the meeting. With the aid
of low interest (2.7 per cent)
loans under the Federal Housing
Act, the University may be able to
amortize a greater percentage of
the total cost, thus cutting the fra
ternities' share down from $K3O,
000 to $110,000.
The Administration lias also
recognized the need for - T \ greater
amount of social area in the
houses and has agreed to an in
crease of GOO square feet,
