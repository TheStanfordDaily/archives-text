# McCord Tells Causes of Alcoholism
## 
### Lynn DeLargey 
According to sociologist Wil
liam M. McCord, there is little
hope that American society will
"replace punitive attitudes with
efforts at rehabilitation," the ma
jor change necessary to prevent
further increase in the high rates
of alcoholism and crime in this
country, which arc a "major
plague."
Speaking Tuesday night, Mc-
Cord reported results of a follow
up study of men who were first
studied at age nine, 20 years ago.
By correlating family back
ground and community environ
ment with later alcoholism and
crime, sociologists have discov
ered what causes boys to become
criminals or alcoholics.
High Crime Kate
McCord enumerated some rea
sons why the U.S. crime rate is
the highest in the Western world
and the alcoholism rate almost as
bad.
"The lack of traditional social
controls which restrain individual
behavior in European society, the
lack of close ties with an indi
vidual group, the values of vio
lence and monetary success" all
help account for the problem.
"Both drinking and violence are
encouraged in the average Ameri
can male," McCord said.
The alcoholic has a desire to be
mothered and to form a stable
relationship with someone, but in
American society he must put up
a facade of the masculine virtues.
Alcohol provides the comfort of
satisfied dependency which the al
coholic failed to get from his par
ents.
The adolescent gang criminal
receives no recognition in his
family and can find status only in
a gang, whose values are violence
and monetary success.
Treatment
As for treatment, McCord said
that prisons and jails "actually
probably increase crime; "80 per
cent of jail alumni continue in
crime while the spontaneous re
covery rate is 60 per cent."
For alcoholism McCord says
that the group therapy of Alco
holics Anonymous is the most
hopeful, but admonition to "pull
yourself up by your bootstraps"
is useless.

lence and monetary success" all
help account for the problem.
"Both drinking and violence are
encouraged in the average Ameri
can male," McCord said.
The alcoholic has a desire to be
mothered and to form a stable
relationship with someone, but in
American society he must put up
a facade of the masculine virtues.
Alcohol provides the comfort of
satisfied dependency which the al
coholic failed to get from his par
ents.
The adolescent gang criminal
receives no recognition in his
family and can find status only in
a gang, whose values are violence
and monetary success.
Treatment
As for treatment, McCord said
that prisons and jails "actually
probably increase crime; "80 per
cent of jail alumni continue in
crime while the spontaneous re
covery rate is 60 per cent."
For alcoholism McCord says
that the group therapy of Alco
holics Anonymous is the most
hopeful, but admonition to "pull
yourself up by your bootstraps"
is useless.
