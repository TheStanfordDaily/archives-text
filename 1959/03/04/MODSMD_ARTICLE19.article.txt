fust A Reminder
Editor, The Daily:
It is good at last to see an ar
ticle in The Daily that is devoid
of the left-wing tinge which I had
come to consider as the norm for
most Daily articles. But, then,
this one was apparently not writ
ten by a Daily staff member. At
any rate, contemplating vocifer
ous protests and great cries of
anguish from the campus liberals,
I would like to register my ap
proval of Dave Long's column in
Monday's Daily.
That the liberals should cry out
is normal, 1 guess. Generally
those who are hit make the most
noise. On examination, however 1 ,
the liberals should have little
about which to complain on the
matter of loyalty oaths: if they
are loyal, signing an oath should
prove no great mental strain, and
if they do advocate the violent
overthrow of the government,
they are most probably of the
moral type that would see nothing
wrong in committing a bit of per
jury.
For those who have not defi
nitely committed themselves on
the questionable and rather out
moded concept of loyalty to the
American government (and I per

ceive that the mass of them fall
into this category), the oath will,
as Dave Long pointed out, pos
sibly serve to remind them that
a government exists to which
most of the liberally unenlight
ened taxpayers do feel that loy
alty should be paid.

Alka-Seltzer Anyone?

Editor, The Daily:
Last year's Scratch Sheet was
saucy, entertaining, but irrespon
sible, and it is reassuring to note
the seriousness of purpose which
forms the organizing principle of
the present issue. There is a sin
cere determination not to offend
which fits well with the easy sen
timents of the preface.
The students are flattered, the
faculty are reassured, and we can
again relax together in the best
of all possible universities with
the best of all possible climates.
The Scratch Sheet this year is
bland and wholesome, but we
must face geographical facts:
here on the Peninsula progress
begins not with a bang, but with
a satisfied belch. Alka-Seltzer
anyone?
