Dangerous Institution
Editor, The Daily:
The editorial of the second issue
of the Scratch Sheet implies that
the University is, unfortunately,
being filled with research scholars
rather than "teachers." The
Scratch Sheet does not, however,
define what constitutes a teacher,
nor does it attempt a definition of
a good course.
From the context of the evalua
tions, one can only gather that a
good teacher is either interesting
or interested or, in the case of Mr.
Mazour, "a man very well versed
in his field."
The best definition of a course
to be found in the text is that it
be aimed at the lowest level of
the class. As the critic of Mr. Isen
berg's Philosophy 2 course ob
serve*, "The lectures are on an
advanced philosophical level, and
certain points, in the manner pre
sented, are beyond the comprehen
sion of some students." Not, we
observe, of the critic.
Supposing that there is some
basis for evaluation, we doubt that
undergraduates have the scope to
make such criticisms. Although
the critics are, supposedly, think
ing students who have taken the
courses in question (except in the
case of courses which have not
previously been given), the selec
tion of critics was not so careful
as one might gather, and resem
bled more precisely a man-on-the
street's opinion.
The implication, however, is
that it IS the men-on-the-streef's
opinions, and the criticisms are,
therefore, presented as more rep
resentative than they actually are.
Finally, since the Scratch Sheet
is now sanctioned by the Univer
sity and is in fairly wide circula
tion, we think it a potentially dan
gerous institution for two rea
sons: (1) freshmen, at whom the
publication is aimed, do not have
the experience to evaluate the
Scratch Sheet, and therefore take
il at face value; and (2) such wan
ton, and possibly powerful, criti
cism might have unfortunate de
partmental results for the profes
sors in question.

Article Cur
Editor, The Daily:
Considerable editorial space in
yesterday's Daily was given over
to an expression of my views. The
idea of allowing space for the stu
dents and faculty to express their
views is a good one, and I wish
to thank Leo Krulitz for helping
me to define my thoughts as well
as publishing them.
However, without consulting
me one-third of my argument was
cut. Although what appeared con
tained the basic substance of my
viewpoint, the presentation was
weakened and distorted and im
portant points omitted. Further
more, I had been guaranteed a
more appropriate publication date

and this, too, was changed with
out consulting me. This is poor
public relations and worse edito
rial practice. Apparently it is not
only the policy of the administra
tion that needs clarification and
setting aright.
Lee, Irish
(Editor's Note: While we can
clarify our policy, we're si i11
waiting along with Lee Irish
for the administration to clarify
theirs. We can never guarantee
when an article will run or that
it won't have to he cut simply
because we don't have control
over advertising or the flow of
the news.
(If I have misrepresented this
fact, perhaps this explanation
will clear it up. Many times a
I story doesn't need to be cut
j until it is going into the form,
I at which time it would Ik; im
j possible to contact the writer.
(Knowing the a m o u n t of
i work Lee put into his article
j made it difficult to cut because
i it was tightly written. We are
j glad we were able lo cut tin;
necessary amount and still rc
j tain the basic substance of his
| viewpoint.)
