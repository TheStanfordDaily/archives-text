Hypocrisy
Editor, The Daily:
In tho recent discussions of the
Fundamental Standard and Honor-
Code at Legislature, some of the
Legislature members expressed
concern and bewilderment at the
results of the poll of Wilbur men.
Specific concern arose ut the per
centage of residents who express
ed cynicism for the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code.
Though not a freshman, I was
a transfer student this year, and
I, too, am not immune to being
cynical. I think my reasons are
the same as those of a goodly
number of Wilbur men.
Before being admitted to Stan
ford, we sign a card saying that
we will abide by the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code. Dur
ing the orientation meetings tho
new students sit through a speech
telling how wonderful this system
is and that Stanford is one of the
few universities in the country
having it.
So with a sigh of rosy idealism,
we sit back and think, "How won
derful it is to be treated as an
adult, for a change!"
Then comes our first registra
tion day and the hectic misfor
tunes of standing for hours in all
the wrong lines. But first we sign
another card saying that we will
abide by the Honor Code. "Again!
How bad do they think-my mem
ory is? Oh. well." And we sign.
Our 112 i r s t Stanford mid-term
soon arrives. The blue books are
passed out, and we read, "HON
OR ABLE CONDUCT in academic
work is the spirit of conduct in
this University." And another
place to put one's signature say
ing that ho will abide by the
Honor Code.
So some of us begin wondering
about the idealism that was

preached to us when we first ar
rived al Stanford and the contin
ual reaffirmations of the faith.
Note the paradox of "HONORA
BLE CONDUCT in academic work
is the spirit of conduct in this Uni
v' e r si 1 y" and "SUGGESTIONS
FOR CONDUCT: 1. Occupy alter
nate seats where passible. . .
Some of us arrive at ihe conclu
sion: hypocrisy.

Editor, The Daily:
In tho recent discussions of the
Fundamental Standard and Honor-
Code at Legislature, some of the
Legislature members expressed
concern and bewilderment at the
results of the poll of Wilbur men.
Specific concern arose ut the per
centage of residents who express
ed cynicism for the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code.
Though not a freshman, I was
a transfer student this year, and
I, too, am not immune to being
cynical. I think my reasons are
the same as those of a goodly
number of Wilbur men.
Before being admitted to Stan
ford, we sign a card saying that
we will abide by the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code. Dur
ing the orientation meetings tho
new students sit through a speech
telling how wonderful this system
is and that Stanford is one of the
few universities in the country
having it.
So with a sigh of rosy idealism,
we sit back and think, "How won
derful it is to be treated as an
adult, for a change!"
Then comes our first registra
tion day and the hectic misfor
tunes of standing for hours in all
the wrong lines. But first we sign
another card saying that we will
abide by the Honor Code. "Again!
How bad do they think-my mem
ory is? Oh. well." And we sign.
Our 112 i r s t Stanford mid-term
soon arrives. The blue books are
passed out, and we read, "HON
OR ABLE CONDUCT in academic
work is the spirit of conduct in
this University." And another
place to put one's signature say
ing that ho will abide by the
Honor Code.
So some of us begin wondering
about the idealism that was

preached to us when we first ar
rived al Stanford and the contin
ual reaffirmations of the faith.
Note the paradox of "HONORA
BLE CONDUCT in academic work
is the spirit of conduct in this Uni
