# Harman-Paced Beavers Cards' Last Assignment
## DAILY Sports SCENE 
### 
Fresh after two straight wins, Stanford eagers are preparing for
Iheir Friday game with the invading Oregon State Beavers and the
last basketball of the season.
A victory will give the Cards 10 wins and 6 losses in league play
and a 14-9 overall record.
The Tribe extended its Pavilion winning streak to 14 last weekend

with triumphs over Washington
! State and Southern California.
(The Indians have not been beaten
at home since mid-season last
year.
Oregon State is currently in
| fifth place in PCC standings with
j a 7-7 record and is corning south
I to play the Cards Friday night
and Cal Saturday, to finish off
their season.
Trounced Tribe
Although the Beavers are in the
middle of tHe standings they can
!be considered no pushover, as
they trounced the Tribe in Cor
vallis, 68 to 56, earlier this year.
The orange and black Halloween
men would also like to win and
gain the first division of the
league by the season's finale.
Veteran guard Lee Harman is
the big gun in the Beaver attack.
The sharpshooter has had several
30-point games this season and
led the PCC individual scoring de
partment several weeks this year
only to fall behind due to a
sprained ankle which kept him
out of several games.
Sophomores Sparkle
In the Beaver-Indian game up
north, however, it was two sopho
more forwards that sank Indian
hopes. Menlo JC transfer Jim
Woodland led the Oregon Staters
with 26 big points. His sophomore
teammate Steve Flynn, a tall 6-5,
pushed through 10 points, all in
the Beavers' second half game
winning rally.
Besides Harman, Flynn and
I Woodland, Oregon State will
count on two centers, 6-8 Gary
Coble and 6 9 Karl Anderson, to
get the rebounds against the
shorter Stanford opponents.
Jim Anderson and Ted Miller,
both seniors, can be expected to
see a lot of action at the other
guard spot in Friday night's (Mi
counter. Both are lettermen.
Slats at Helm
The Beavers are coached by
| Amory T. "Slats" Gill, in his
i thirty-second year at the helm of
the Oregon State cagers.
Gill's type of play is character
ized by a slow, deliberate weave
by which the guards try to get
the ball in to the big men under-
I neath. However, with Harman
I hitting from outside and driving
for lay-ins, the Cards will have to
keep their tight defensive game |
to whip the visiting Beavers.
OSC tied Cal for the PCC's top !
spot last year. This year the Bea-1
vers had to go without the two
leading scorers of that five, Dave |
Gambee and Ken Nanson.
Gambee graduated as the Bea
vers' all-time top scorer, but his
PCC career mark was recently
broken by Doug Smart of Wash
ington.
