ADVENTURES IN SOCIAL SCIENCE: NO. 2
Today, with earnestness and sobriety, we make the second of
our forays into social science. \Yc take up the most basic of all
social sciences—sociology itself.
Sociology teaches us that man is a social animal, ft is not
instinct or heredity that determines his conduct; it is environ
ment. This fact is vividly borne out when you consider the ease
of Julio Sigafoos.
Julio, abandoned as an infant in a dark wood near Cleveland,
w.'is adopted by a pack of wild dogs and reared as one of their
own. When Julio was found by a hunter at the age of twelve,
the poor child was more canine than human. He ran on all
fours, barked and growled, ate raw meat, lapped water with his
tongue, and could neither speak nor understand one single word,
in short, he was a complete product of his environment.
Julio, incidentally, was more fortunate than most wild chil
dren. They never become truly humanized, but Julio was ex
ceptional. liit by bit, he began to talk and walk and cat and
drink as people do. His long-dormant mental processes, when
awakened at l;i-t, turned out to be fantastically acute, lie was
so bright that he learned to read and write in a month, £"t
through grammar school in three years, and high school in Ivin.
And last. June as thousands of spectators, knowing the odds
Julio had overcome, stood and raised cheer after cheer, lie was
graduated valedictorian from C'al lech with a degree in astro
physics!
Who can say to what towering heights this incredible boy
would have risen had he not been killed the day after commence
ment while chasing a car?

Hut I digress. To return In sociology, people lend to gather
in groups—a tendency that began, as we all know, with the
introduction of Marlboro Cigarettes. What an aid to sociability
I hey are! I low benignly one looks upon one's fellows after pull
ing on Marlboro's filter that really tilt cms, on Marlboro's flavor
that's really flavorful. How eager it, makes one to extend the
hand of friendship! How grateful we all are to Marlboro for
making possible this togetherness! How good not to live in the
bleak pre-Marlboro world with every man a stranger!
The groups that people live in today (thanks to Marlboro)
vary widely in their customs. W hat is perfectly acceptable in
one society may be quite outlandish in another. Take, for iu
sjtance, the case of I g Nan YVyek.
I'g, a Polynesian lad, grew up in an idyllic South Sea isle,
where the leading event of the year was the feast of Max, the
sun god. A quaint all-day ceremony was held, with tribal
dancing, war chants, fat-lady races, pie-eating contests, and, for
the grand finale, the sacrifice of two dozen maidens.
According to Ug's folkways, sacrificing maidens was entirely
acceptable, but when, in his eighteenth year, he was sent as an
exchange student to the University of Wisconsin, he soon
learned that Americans take a dim view of this practice in
Wisconsin, at any rate. The first fifteen or twenty maidens U?
sacrificed, lie was let off with a warning. When, however, he
persisted, drastic measures were taken: he was dcplcdged by
his fraternity. A broken man, I'g quit school and moved to
Milwaukee where today lie earns a meager living as a stein.

ADVENTURES IN SOCIAL SCIENCE: NO. 2
Today, with earnestness and sobriety, we make the second of
our forays into social science. \Yc take up the most basic of all
social sciences—sociology itself.
Sociology teaches us that man is a social animal, ft is not
instinct or heredity that determines his conduct; it is environ
ment. This fact is vividly borne out when you consider the ease
of Julio Sigafoos.
Julio, abandoned as an infant in a dark wood near Cleveland,
w.'is adopted by a pack of wild dogs and reared as one of their
own. When Julio was found by a hunter at the age of twelve,
the poor child was more canine than human. He ran on all
fours, barked and growled, ate raw meat, lapped water with his
tongue, and could neither speak nor understand one single word,
in short, he was a complete product of his environment.
Julio, incidentally, was more fortunate than most wild chil
dren. They never become truly humanized, but Julio was ex
ceptional. liit by bit, he began to talk and walk and cat and
drink as people do. His long-dormant mental processes, when
awakened at l;i-t, turned out to be fantastically acute, lie was
so bright that he learned to read and write in a month, £"t
through grammar school in three years, and high school in Ivin.
And last. June as thousands of spectators, knowing the odds
Julio had overcome, stood and raised cheer after cheer, lie was
graduated valedictorian from C'al lech with a degree in astro
physics!
Who can say to what towering heights this incredible boy
would have risen had he not been killed the day after commence
ment while chasing a car?

Hut I digress. To return In sociology, people lend to gather
in groups—a tendency that began, as we all know, with the
introduction of Marlboro Cigarettes. What an aid to sociability
I hey are! I low benignly one looks upon one's fellows after pull
ing on Marlboro's filter that really tilt cms, on Marlboro's flavor
that's really flavorful. How eager it, makes one to extend the
hand of friendship! How grateful we all are to Marlboro for
making possible this togetherness! How good not to live in the
bleak pre-Marlboro world with every man a stranger!
The groups that people live in today (thanks to Marlboro)
vary widely in their customs. W hat is perfectly acceptable in
one society may be quite outlandish in another. Take, for iu
sjtance, the case of I g Nan YVyek.
I'g, a Polynesian lad, grew up in an idyllic South Sea isle,
where the leading event of the year was the feast of Max, the
sun god. A quaint all-day ceremony was held, with tribal
dancing, war chants, fat-lady races, pie-eating contests, and, for
the grand finale, the sacrifice of two dozen maidens.
According to Ug's folkways, sacrificing maidens was entirely
acceptable, but when, in his eighteenth year, he was sent as an
exchange student to the University of Wisconsin, he soon
learned that Americans take a dim view of this practice in
