# Pioneer IV Nearing Moon
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) â€” A tiny
cone made America's farthest
penetration into space Tuesday as
it lunged closer to the moon and a
hoped-for orbit around the sun.
Riding in the nose of a 60-ton
Army rocket, the 13-pound pack
age of instruments roared aloft
from Cape Canaveral, Fla., at 10Yz
minutes past midnight, EST.
As of 3 p.m., the National Aero
nautics and Space Administration
calculated the 20-inch-long gold
plated cone, called Pioneer IV,
had reached 107,900 miles from
earth.
The moon is some 220,000 miles
away.
Slows Down
Pioneer IV was slowing down,
but that was according to plan.
At 1.1 hours after launching, its
speed had dropped from 24,890
miles an hour to 5673 miles an
hour.
All hough slightly off its in
tended course, Pioneer was ex
pected to pass the moon about 2
p.m. Wednesday at a distance of
about 25,000 miles. Then, scien
tists hope, it will flash on to a
solar orbit.
The .Russians launched a space
probe on .Fan. 2 and claim il went
into orbit around the sun, which
is nearly 93 million miles from
earth.
There was little early reaction
from Russia. The Soviet news
agency Tass put out a one-para
graph report on the American
space probe launching.
Fifth Effort
This was th*- fifth U.S. effort
to shoot an instrumented pay load
to the vicinity of the moon or past
it to orbit around the sun. Two of
three Air Force tries failed, while
a third went 71,300 miles before
falling hack to disintegrate in the
eartlt's at mosphere.
A previous Army bid on Dee. 6
to send a probe toward the sun
fell far short, reaching only 63,580
miles.
Using a big radio telescope, sci
entists at .todrell I tank in England
reported the probe appeared to be
on a course several degrees lower
than planned. This later was con
firmed by Dr. William H. Picker
ing, head of NASA's Jet Propul
sion Laboratory at Pasadena,
Calif.
