"Apartheid" is Afrikaans for
the policy of total racial segrega
tion now being supported by the
South African government. At
present, parts of the cities there
are being torn down and rebuilt
in order to redistrict them into
racial compartments, isolated by
empty buffer zones.
Not only do the laws of South
Africa keep the Negro completely
segregated and powerless; they
do not provide protection from
crime in the Negro districts of the
cities. As a result, the Negro
population is oppressed by both
police and criminal elements.
As counsel before the Supreme
Court of South Africa, Cowan
challenged the constitutionality of
laws depriving colored citizens of
the vote.
In 1939 Cowan was graduated
with distinction in arts and law
from the University of Capetown,
and joined the faculty in 1916. He
became dean in 19.~57. with a dis
tinguished legal carepr and a long
record of effort for liberal reform
behind him.

member of the Union of South Af
rican Law Revision Commission.
He was chairman of a conference
on academic freedom held by
South African universities.
