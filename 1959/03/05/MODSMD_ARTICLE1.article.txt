# 24-Hour Alert By Bombers Probable--Ike
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P> President Eisenhower said Wednesday a con
stant air alert by American bombers is a probability if conditions
keep developing along present lines.
The United States never has maintained such an around-the-clock
alert, although the Strategic Air Command would like to. SAC does

have some jet bombers aloft at
all times, but the Air Force says
they are on training missions.
Without spelling out the exact
conditions, Eisenhower told a
news conference the time probab
ly will come for a 24-hour air alert
"if this situation develops along
the linos that it appears to be go
ing." He may have been referring
to the tension over Berlin as well
as to the possibility of Soviet mis
sile attacks.
Ground Alert
At the moment, SAC forces tire
kept on a ground alert, ready to
hop off on 15-minute notice.
Furthermore, the chief execu
tive frowned on the idea of any
general mobilization of U.S. and
North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion military forces to show the
Soviet Union the West is deter
mined to maintain access to Ber
lin.
Eisenhower didn't answer di
rectly a question pegged to re
ports in British newspapers that
Western leadership in the cold
war has passed to Britain as a re
sult of the illness of Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles.
Dulles' Successor
But he seemed to hint that if
Dulles should resign because of
his health. Undersecretary Chris
tian A. Hcrter would succeed him.
As for British Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan's visit to Soviet
Premier Nikita Khrushchev, Ei
senhower said he thinks Macmil
lan had to make the trip and that
the British people feel better be
cause of it.
To a q ue s t ion whether he
thought the American people
would feel better if he met with
Khrushchev, Eisenhower replied:
"No well, I don't it wouldn't be
necessarily, the cases wouldn't be
the same."
He said he deplores "talking
about summit meetings when you
cannot see any posibility of a con
structive step coming out of it."
He said he is quite sure Con
gres isn't thinking of amending
the Constitution and handing over
to the President the right to de
clare war.
