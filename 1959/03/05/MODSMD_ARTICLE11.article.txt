## 'Way of Life Corrupted,' Says Lecturer Cowan 
### Cally Tanner 
A "melancholy" picture of the effects of apartheid in South Africa
was drawn by Dean Denis Victor Cowan of the University of Cape
town last night in.Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Briefly, apartheid is a word coined by the national government
after World War II for their policy of racial segregation, to meet "the

fear of black domination or the
disappearance of whites in a so
ciety of mixed blood."
"At the heart of any interpre
tation of apartheid is the firm-be
lief that if Western civilization is
to survive in South Africa, the
races must live and develop in
their separate cultures," Cowan
said.
"A whole way of life is being
corrupted in pursuit of this ideal,"
Cowan held. While the constitu
tional aspects alone have not caus
ed nor can correct—this situa
tion, they are of considerable im
portance in understanding it.
Cowan sketched the legal as
pects of apartheid in terms of con
stitutional law and,-more vividly,
j its effects on common law or in
dividual rights.
Following the example of Eng
land, common law in South Africa
is not beyond the reach of a par
i liamentary majority, and conse
quently "fundamental rights have
been emasculated." Personal free
i dom, presumption of innocence,
; and the freedoms of privacy, re
ligion, assembly, speech and press
have "gone by the boards," he
noted.
"Apartheid has destroyed the
majority's faith in any form of
constitution and has created con
ditions to poison 'white-white' re
lationships as well a« those with
the non-whites, leaving a great
nation torn with conflict and in
fertile soil for Communism.
"There may still be a way out
of this, but only through integra
tion," maintained Cowan. "As
long as the whites hold them
selves as -sovereign guardians, I
can see only one fate for South
Africa, and that is complete and
utter tragedy."

stitutional law and,-more vividly,
j its effects on common law or in
dividual rights.
Following the example of Eng
land, common law in South Africa
is not beyond the reach of a par
i liamentary majority, and conse
quently "fundamental rights have
been emasculated." Personal free
i dom, presumption of innocence,
; and the freedoms of privacy, re
ligion, assembly, speech and press
have "gone by the boards," he
noted.
"Apartheid has destroyed the
majority's faith in any form of
constitution and has created con
ditions to poison 'white-white' re
lationships as well a« those with
the non-whites, leaving a great
nation torn with conflict and in
fertile soil for Communism.
"There may still be a way out
of this, but only through integra
tion," maintained Cowan. "As
long as the whites hold them
selves as -sovereign guardians, I
can see only one fate for South
Africa, and that is complete and
utter tragedy."
