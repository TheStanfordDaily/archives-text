A .team of Stanford University
researchers has found that the
public has "an appalling igno
rance" about the objectives, moti
vations and procedures of the
daily newspapers they read.
This is one of many findings
disclosed in a paper-back book,
"The Newspaper and lis Public,''
which has been published jointly
bv Professor Chilton 11. Bush, di
rector of Stanford's Communica
tion and Journalism Department;
James E. Brinlon, associate pro
fessor of journalism; and Thomas
M. Newell, former assistant pro
fessor of journalism, now with >\
New York research firm.
The results were garnered from
a 56-quesiion test which took 10
years to develop.
Publishers in seven communi
ties in four slates Washington,
Oregon, California and Texas co
operated by having the surveys
made to gauge local public accept
ance of their products.
In general, the testers found
that readers did not feel strongly
either way about their newspa
per, except as to whether il was
"good" or "bad"; that they did
have opinions on whether they
thought their newspaper was bias
ed. whether its contents were ac
curate and adequate and whether
it tried to impose its own political
leanings.
"The responsibility for better
understanding rest -s with the
press itself, with the schools and
with every citizen," the report con
â€¢ludes.
