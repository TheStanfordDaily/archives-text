# Advisory System
## 
### 
As v\ k <.o TilKOi «;ii llie process of pre-registering a«zain, one tiling
is obviously apparent Stanford's advisory system is painfnll\
inadequate and out of killer wit Ik the direetion Stanford eduea
lion is taking.
The advisory system is inadequate in two ways, l irst, it hasn I
lieen brought into line with the concept ol continuity which the
Administration has been pursuing. While the eoneepl has been
associated with the field of student housing, we I eel it applies as
well to the student's educational program.
Secondly, the advisory system is presently inadequate in terms
of procedure, and fails to provide many students with the mini
mum assistance in many instances. We will deal with the first
problem today and the second problem, along with student re
sponsibility, tomorrow.
Continuity might he defined, with respect to education and
courses, this way: knowing where you're going and how you're
getting there.
There is a certain amount of continuity in a student's
educational program built in. so to speak, by (tenoral
Studies ami departmental requirements; but 100 often
the "elect ives" or the remaining required number of units
for graduation arc filled by courses that "don I conn• at
H:(H) a.m." "don't have finals on Friday " "don't require
papers, "don't come in the afternoon. etc.
These elect ives, in some instances, may amount to a (nil years
work or more.
It is here that the adviser system should he most useful
helping students to plan and use their elective units to comple
ment, broaden and strengthen their total program and the simple
signing of a class card without comment by an adviser doesn't
provide this needed help.
We feel that the ansicer to this part of the advisory
problem would be taken care of if students met formally
only once a year with their advisers, preferably in the
fall, and worked out the year's program at one time.
The program, of course, should he subject to change if a stu
dent changed his major or preferred to substitute for a course;
but the basic continuity would be achieved, and the student would
have a well-thought-out program as a foundation for a more mean
ingful year of education.
