Standards of Public Service

The news that Secretary McEl
roy may be resigning in a few
months raises a serious question
about the prevailing standards of
public service.
It appears that when the Presi
dent approached Mr. McElroy
about appointing him to what is
surely one of the most difficult
and most responsible offices in
the government, they came to an
understanding that Mr. McElroy
might serve for a very limited
period only.
The reason for this seems to
have been that Mr. McElroy could
take only so much leave of ab
sence from his business without
sacrificing certain financial bene
fits for which he is eligible.
When we remember that
what is at stake is the office of
Secretary of Defense, it is neces
sary to ask whether >Ir. McEl
roy should have laid down —or
that the President should have
agreed to —the conditions under
which his appointment was
made.
Complex Organization
The Defense Department is an
enormously complex organization,
and the great issues on which the
Secretary must pass are highly
technical ones in the field of strat
egy, tactics, engineering, produc
tion and research. Moreover, the
Secretary of Defense is the key
m,->n in the relations between the
armed services and the Congress.
Eighteen months are perhaps
enough for a reasonably good
introduction to the work of the
office. But, as Mr. McElroy's
recent, testimony before a con
gressional committee showed,
while he has learned many les
sons, yet he is far from having
mastered the job.
McElroy's Successor
Mr. McElroy expects to leave
the job just as he is about ready
to DO it. His successor, if ho
comes from the outside, may be
able to learn about the job just as
the time comes for him to leave
it. If Mr. McElroy's successor is
promoted from within the Depart
ment of Defense, he is more likely
than not to be a caretaker and not
much more.
All this adds up to the fact

that with so much at stake a
very serious office has not been
treated seriously enough. This
is against the national interest,
which requires a highly com
petent Secretary of Defense;
and it is a bad example of how
the public service should be
valued by our people.
Broadly speaking, there are two
kinds of opinion as to how the
highest offices of the government
shotild be recruited.
Private Business Successes
There are those who believe
that for the most part although
there are exceptions to all such
rules—the big offices can be fill
ed most successfully by men who
have made a success in private
business. The theory here is that
there is no great difference be
tween public and private life, and
that experience in business is not
really different from experience
in government.
With the conspicuous excep
tion of Secretary Dulles, who
has combined a lifetime of pub
lic service with a highly suc
cessful law practice, President
Eisenhower has shown a predi
lection for successful corporate
executives.
The other school of opinion
holds that the public service is in
itself a vocation and a profession
al career and that it cannot be
treated—like Sunday painting or
Sunday golf—as an interlude for
amateurs.
Fundamental Fallacy
Those who think this way re
gard it as a fundamental fallacy
to suppose that success in corpo
rate business is preparation for
success in the public business.
They believe that, on the whole,
it is better to fill the higher of
fices with men whose main work
in life has been in politics and the
public service.
Those ol us who take this latter
view believe that public service is
a profession and an art which
must be acquired by long experi
ence in public life. For the art of
governing men is a great art itself
perhaps the greatest, as it sure
ly is Uie most momentous, of all
the arts- and a lifetime is not too
long a time in which to learn it.
