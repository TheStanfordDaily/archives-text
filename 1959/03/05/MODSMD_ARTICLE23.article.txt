Because of the approaching
rushing season, and the conse-1
quent flux of ariicles by and about !
fraternities, it would seem fair to!
present here a few words on Ihei
eating club system.
1 will noi insult my reader with
duck-billed platitudes praising the i
sociological benefits of Wheaties ,
eating togetherness, because the I
purpose of the clubs is not to nur-1
ture a well-rounded mediocre who. !
armed with a club banner, will j
march confidently toward Accept
ed Goals, knowing that he Be- j
longs.
The function of the clubs is to
provide a selective organization in
which the individual is of primary

importance. Practically, it comes
to this: there are no fines for
missing parties or meetings; there
is no hazing of pledges; there are
no white-supremacy clauses in our
constitutions it has been our
privilege to have had members of
many races.
In short, we have tried to elim
inate the elements of immaturity
from selective group living, in the
attempt to form an active and
totally i-ivilL/ed social system.
It has been said that the club
sys'em is too idealistic by nature
to function efficiently; this is not
true. We find that our social func
tions from formals to weekly
beer blasts will be supported

without compulsory attendance if
they are well planned.
We find there is as much pleas
ure in contributing quietly or even
anonymously to various charities
as there is in turning generosity
into MGM productions. We find
that, in our wide variety of mem
bers, we have had leaders in every
aspect of University life.
Finally, we hope that the club
system, though now in its infancy,
eventually will become a national
institution, for we feel that most
students would thrive in our sys
tem of relaxed selective living.
