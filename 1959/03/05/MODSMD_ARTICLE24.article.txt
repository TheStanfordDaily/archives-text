In the Daily Trojan from USC,
; we find that Russian Deputy Pre
: mier Anastas Mikoyan spoke at ;i
I pit ss conference about his visit to j
the UCLA campus:
"I practically forgot I was in
tin* United States and not in the
Soviet I'nioli."
«• a •»
It seems that UCLA has discov-!
ered that we have ;i few errant I
fraternities. A headline in their |
paper ran: "Stanford Frats Meted >
Stiff Penalty for (hie) Beer Bust."
But, officer, this is just a (piiei j
fraternity gathering.

10von exchange editors merit an
occasional "letter to the editor," |
as was recently noticed. Someone
kindly sent a message to the Daily
editor that the plural of campus
is campi (with one "i"> and not
campii, as it had been seen over
I his column. Sorry.
Students at the University of
Oregon seem to he running out of I
room to study. No more will they j
he able to stretch their legs out
in Ironl of them as they ponder
the works of the great.
No longer will so many he able j
to fit into that college's equiva
lent of our RBR. No longer will ,
so many be able to enjoy the rela
tive pcace and quiet of study in
the library.
And the culprit? BOOKS.
'J'he annual addition to their li
brary of 35,000 volumes next year !
is going to mean that study seats'
are closer together and that there
are less of them.
Who belongs in the library, we
ask —hooks or sludiers?
I And it seems that hundreds of!

students from the University of
Texas flocked to the State Legis
lature on opening day ten of
them were House of .Representa
tives members.

Daily C'al reporters placed a
bright new penny on a sidewalk
and laid in wait for some unwary
passer-by to pick it up.
Finally, after some had looked
at it and passed by, or even slop
ped on the innocent coin, a stu
dent did pick it up.
"I'm broke," sighed the penny
pincher, "and, according to PCJ&E,
thi« will buy me about 10 watts
of electricity."
Just as he was leaving, he turn
ed to the reporters: "Say, fellas,
do I get t«> keep the penny?"
