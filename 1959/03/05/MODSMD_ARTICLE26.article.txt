# New Houses Preserve Hospitality
## 
### 
"Muir Mouse and B u rb a n k
House have become part of Ibis
now completed hall which pre
serves Ihe spirit of hospitality and
generosity that characterized one
of Stanford's most cherished
friends," Dean 11. Donald Winbig
ler said at the formal dedication
of units seven and eight of Stern
Hall yesterday.
After quoting from The Daily's
tribute to "Aunt Lucie" Stern on
her death 11 years ago, Winbigler
described her as a friend of three
generations of Stanford students.
Dr. Wilfred Stone, faculty resi
dent for the two houses, outlined
the ideas behind the new "house
system" to the guests, thanking
the benefactors "for making pos
sible a new educational experi
ment."
"A house is an extension of the
intellectual atmosphere of the
University," Stone said, "it is
here that the student should find
his main intellectual stimulus."
He added, "We are trying to
make living and learning the
same thing."
He described the physical char
acteristics that distinguish the
two houses from the rest, of Stern
Hall. He commented, "The
lounges have carpels, they have
paneled walls, they have dignity."
Stone also described the common
rooms on each floor which are be
ing redecorated, the new libraries
which are now supported by the
students financially, and the fac
ulty associate program.
"Formal teaching can't go on in
these spaces," Stone went on, "but
the faculty associate program is
a symbolic step toward a tutorial
system," which he described as
"very worth while.
Walter A. Haas, trustee of the
Stern estate, introduced by Dean
Winbigler as a "distinguished citi
zen of California," formally pre
sented the new houses to Stanford
in the memory of Lucie Stern.
David Packard, president of the
Board of Trustees, accepted the
gift on behalf of the University.

serves Ihe spirit of hospitality and
generosity that characterized one
of Stanford's most cherished
friends," Dean 11. Donald Winbig
ler said at the formal dedication
of units seven and eight of Stern
Hall yesterday.
After quoting from The Daily's
tribute to "Aunt Lucie" Stern on
her death 11 years ago, Winbigler
described her as a friend of three
generations of Stanford students.
Dr. Wilfred Stone, faculty resi
dent for the two houses, outlined
the ideas behind the new "house
system" to the guests, thanking
the benefactors "for making pos
sible a new educational experi
ment."
"A house is an extension of the
intellectual atmosphere of the
University," Stone said, "it is
here that the student should find
his main intellectual stimulus."
He added, "We are trying to
make living and learning the
same thing."
He described the physical char
acteristics that distinguish the
two houses from the rest, of Stern
Hall. He commented, "The
lounges have carpels, they have
paneled walls, they have dignity."
Stone also described the common
rooms on each floor which are be
ing redecorated, the new libraries
which are now supported by the
students financially, and the fac
ulty associate program.
"Formal teaching can't go on in
these spaces," Stone went on, "but
the faculty associate program is
a symbolic step toward a tutorial
system," which he described as
"very worth while.
Walter A. Haas, trustee of the
Stern estate, introduced by Dean
Winbigler as a "distinguished citi
zen of California," formally pre
sented the new houses to Stanford
in the memory of Lucie Stern.
David Packard, president of the
Board of Trustees, accepted the
gift on behalf of the University.
