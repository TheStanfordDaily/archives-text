# Brazil, U.S. Stay On Good Terms
## 
### Sarah Lawrence 
| The United States and Brazil
have been good friends and neigh
bors throughout history, and this
good will continues today. That
was the ojiyiion expressed here
Tuesday by Associate Professor
: Oswaldo Fadigas Fontes Torres,
of the Aeronautical Institute of
Technology in Brazil.
Torres has been visiting Stan
ford and other leading American
universities with Ernest Oscar
Altschul, assistant professor of
electronics, also ITA.
Learn Operations
The purpose of this visit lias
bepn to learn more about opera
tions research in industrial man
agement and product design and
about development of electric
magnetic devices, transformers,
magnetic amplifiers and magnetic
control systems.
Torres also mentioned the fact
that the U.S. and Brazil were good
allies during World War 11, and

that even today one of tlie missile
tracking ranges is on Brazilian
soil. The general sentiment of the
people toward the U.S. is friendly.
Economy Asset
In industry, said Torres, large
American corporations have ei
ther subsidiaries or joint compa
nies in Brazil. This is an asset to
the economy. Brazil exports cof
fee and rubber, of which items the
U.S. is a large customer, although
Brazil imports more U.S. goods
than it exports to this country.
"Brazil differs from the rest of
the Latin-American countries," he
added. "Brazilians speak Portu
guese, not Spanish. Wc have a
small Indian population, while it
is large in other South American
countries."
There are large numbers of Eu
ropeansâ€”Portuguese, Germans
and many Japanese. However,
racial relations in Brazil are very
good.
