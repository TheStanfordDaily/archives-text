## 
### 
Administration officials said on
Monday I hoy will not subsidize
(he operation of the Stanford Hos
pital in San Francisco after the
University's medical school moves
to campus next summer.
The University may decide to
maintain the hospital as a private
institution with a resident train
ing program. Officials hope to an
nounce their decision at the next
Board of Trustees meeting, March
19.
After the board's meeting on
Feb. 24, David Packard, president,
said:
"The University earnestly wish
es to encourage the continuation
of Stanford Hospital under a
workable and financially accept
able plan. This would enable many
eminent doctors to continue, as
in the past, to contribute to the
progress of medicine in associa
tion with Stanford. Such a plan
must assure that Ihe San Fran
c i s c o operation is self-support
ing."
