## 
### Rick Walker 
With iho goal of their 11th
straight PCC championship still
in sight, the Stanford swim team

j flies out of San Francisco Interna
tional Airport this morning foj
i UCLA and the PCC finals.
The meet will begin the sam<

afiernoon at 4:00 wiili the 1500-
meter free style, and continues
through Friday, with the last
event on Saturday atternoon.
Since this is the last PCC swim
meet of all lime, all records held
at the end of Saturday's swim
ming can he written in permanent

Judging from past performances,
Stanford should hold the majority
of the records come Saturday eve
ning.
The Indians' big goal will he to
keep the PCC crown from the
Trojans, who beat them, 56'* to
29!L>, earlier in the season.
The task is not as impossible as
it sounds, because, in PCC meets,
first place gets 7 points, second 5
points, third 4, fourth 3, fifth 2,
and sixth 1 point, whereas in dual
meets it runs 5-3-1. It's hoped
that Stanford's superior depth
will pull them out of the hole.
Stanford's strong event will
again be the breast stroke, as last
year's 100* and 200 • yard PCC
champion Tom Petersen is expect
ed to repeat his performance.
Behind him are James Cooper,
Cus Damon and Hill Fuller, all of
whom should place fifth or better.
The Indians' only competition will
conic from Mcduey of SC and
Schlobahm ol UCLA.
The Indians' other power stroke
should be the butterfly. George
Harrison, top butterflyer on the
Coast this year, is less than one
second off of the national 2(H)
mark of 2:04.2, set by Tony Tash*
nick of Michigan State last year.
Behind Harrison are Tim Tim
ken, excellent 200 man at 2:15,
and John Jurgensen one of the
best in the 100, at 56.

on the Pacific Coast under Stan
ford colors.
During his three-year reign as
Stanford's free-style king, he set

Right behind Moore this year
in the free-style area is sopho
! more Mike Zeller, who has swum
within two second*? of the PCC
record and within one second of
the 100 record.
Both Moore and Zeller should
give Aussie AAU 100-yard record
holder Jon Hendricks a run for
his money in both the 50 and 100
free.
A cinch first for the Stanford
i team should be the 200 individual
medley, in which Harrison set a
