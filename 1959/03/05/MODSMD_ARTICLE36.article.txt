# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
(food (irief —Its Here
Two quarters ol workouts and winter meets have gone in quick
fashion, and now all of a sudden Stanford trackmen find themselves
at the threshold of the 1959 season.
I'ayton -lonian's outfit looks awfully strong in some spots, pretty
weak in others. And with a schedule that just couldn't get much
tougher, the (lards are going to have to be at a season long peak to
chalk up much in the victory column.
San .lose Slale and the Santa Clara Youth Village provide the first
principal opposition Saturday at San Jose. For many Stanford teams,
a battle with San Jose is the breather point on the schedule.
But in track, especially litis year, the Spartans are anything but
a soft touch. With a good crop of individual performers and fair
balance all Hie way through, they show promise of being among the
four or five best teams in June's NCAA meet.
Sprints are supposed to be a Stanford strong point, bid as far as
Saturday is concerned, the Indians will be lucky to get two of the
18 points.
Kay Norton is the man for the Spartans. He was second in
both dashes at NCAA last year, and equaled the world record of 9.3
in mid-season. Last week, Norton ripped off a 14.8 for 160 yards in
time trials the equivalent of pretty close to a 20.0 furlong. And
20.0 is the world record.
To back him up, San Jose has Itob Poynter. lie was a hotshot at
Pasadena School in 1950, winning the stale 220 title and running
second in the 100. l'oynter has been inconsistent in JC the past two
years, but was supposedly ticketed for CSC. Seems he changed his
mind.
He's amazing to watch, running with a leaning-backward style
that really caught on with prep fans in '55 and '50. These same fans
will probably never forget his performance in the I!)f>6 Southern See
lion CIF championships. Trailing two teams by 1,5 yards on the final
leg of an 880 relay, he caught up with both of them after 160 yards.
But l'oynter forgot lo go around. Instead, he played fullback and
ran THROUGH the other' two anchor men, won the race to the tape
by 10 yai'ds, and got his learn disqualified for his efforts.
Three Other EVohahle Winners
Back on the subject of what San Jose has for Saturday: Lrrol
Williams, who at 0-8 wouldn't have any trouble winning the high
jump; Kent llcrkcnratli, fourth in NCAA lows at 23.2 and seemingly
a sure winner there; Dick Box, 22f)-(J in the javelin and better than
anything Stanford has.
Other top Spartans like Don Kelly, Stan Hopkins and .Mac Burton
will have a tougher job winning. Kelly, in fact, shouldn't. He's run
a 9:10.7 two-mile, but Keith Wallace has been under 9:10 and looks
to be among Ihe best two or three two-milers in the United States.
Hopkins, the national junior college record holder in ihe pole vault
and a 1 1-fooler, will lace another 1 1-footer in Mike Franehelti. Vault
ers are notoriously inconsistent in the early season, so there's no
telling what might happen here.
Bui-lon, a 21 -10« broad jump transfer from CCSF, will have to
argue with John Kelly before claiming any victories. Kelly was also
well over 21 last year, but it's doubtful that either will hit 21 on
Saturday.
Lest the S( YV be forgotten, they'll be on hand with good indi
viduals. but the usual lack of manpower and depth. Ilerin Wyatt and
Vern Wilson are always tough in the high jump, and then there's
Las/lo Tabori in the mile.
Although he wasn't too successful in the East, Tabori is none the
less in prely good shape after an indoor campaign. He'll probably
set a tough pace for the Indians' Krnie Cunlil'fc and Bertil I,ninth
in what shapes up as an excellent early-season international mile.
Ixesl of a Tough Slale
After San Jose and tire Youth Village, the Indians will take two
weeks out for' studies and finals, then return to action March 21
against the Youth Village and Olympic Club.
March 28- and that's an unfortunate date, falling as it does during
vacation the Tribe will host .Occidental College in a 1:30 meet at
Stanford Stadium. The following week, it's down to UCLA for the
Cards and a meet at Spanlding Field. On April 11, Fresno State,
whom Stanford beat by winning the relay here last year, returns for
another Stadium meet.
The big attraction of the local season comes April 18, when USC
and Oregon, two of .the best teams in the nation, come to Stanford.
Since UCLA and Cal are meeting at Berkeley that afternoon, Jordan
has decided to hold the meet at 10 a.m. in a co-operative attempt to
build up a Bay Area Track Day promotion.
The schedule's only other dual meet is May 2 at California. The
rest of the spring will he taken up with such attractions as Drake
Relays, Coliseum Relays, West Coast Relays and California Relays.
The NCAA and AAI championship meets will come in middle and
late June.
Conclusion it looks like a great spring.
