llaga has done a good job of
learning as he is currently in sec

Tough Job
Coach Dallmar related that the
Fair Oaks senior is faced with a
tough job every game guarding
a bigger man lo keep the ball
away from him and then trying
to get around him for the re

that he has done this job excep
tionally well.
Another varsity regular who is
playing in his last Tribe game is
guard Doug Warren. According
to Dallmar, Warren was a eager
that most people weren't count

that he couldn't be left out of that
starting lineup.
His improved defense and accu

by the cage mentor. Warren i.<

Two more guards are seeing

Crawford has seen spotty action

San Francisco, and Tom Craw
ford, senior from Pomona, will
be giving their last efforts for
Stanford victories.

has shown this ability by coming
through in clutch situations for
the Tribe in many games this sea

this season and has been rated as
a top reserve, not too far behind
Rose and Warren in ability but
lacking thier experience.

ketball efforts throughout the last
ihree years.
