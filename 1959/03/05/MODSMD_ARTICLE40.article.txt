## L.A. Rams Sign Redskin Brito 
### 
LOS ANGELES </l») The Los
Angeles Rams Wednesday ac
quired defensive end Gene Brito
from the Washington Redskins to
help fill the gap left by the lop
sided trade for Ollie Matson.
The Rams, who got the great
Matson from the Chicago Cardi
nals for eight players and a draft
choieed, picked up Brito in a
straight trade with the Redskins
for linebacker Larry Morris.
Ram General Manager Peje Ro
zellc said the swap is a good deal
for both clubs because:
Brito, who had announced his
retirement, probably would not
have played for Washington next
season anyway. He wants to con
tinue his teaching and coaching
career in the L°s Angeles area.
The Rams have it in spades in
linebackers, so Morris won't be
missed greatly.
"Sure, I'm 33," said Brito, "but
I'm certain I can contribute to
the Rams for the next two or
three years."
"The chance to play for the
Rams and at the same time begin
to establish myself in the Los An
gee Is area is a tremendous oppor
t unity."
