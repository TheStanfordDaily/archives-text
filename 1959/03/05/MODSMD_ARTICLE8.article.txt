shchev said Wednesday the Soviet
Union may sign a separate peace
treaty with East Germany—and i
certainly will give it control over |
Western routes to Berlin.
lie stood bareheaded in a rain
to reiterate the Kremlin's standi
on German issues before a mass I
rally staged to welcome him to
this city and its spring trade fair.;
He appeared here only 24 hours
after he wound up what a British- j
Soviet communique called useful
exchanges with British Prime
Minister Harold Macmillan in
Moscow.
The Soviet Union will sign a!
separate peace treaty with Pre-:
mier Otto Grotewohl's Commu-j
nist East German regime if the
West fails to come to terms on an
all-German settlement, he said.
Khrushchev called again for the
withdrawal of U.S., British and i
French garrisons from West Ber- i
lin. He accused the West of re- j
jeeting his proposals on Germany
without proposing any altcrna- ■
tives "that a normal human intel-1
ligence can agree to."
He said it will be futile for the
Western Allies to protest against j
the Soviet plan for converting
West Berlin into a demilitarized
free city.
He again accused France. Brit
ain and the United States of try
ing to use threats of force to
maintain access to West Berlin.
Khrushchev did not say when
the turnover might take place.
But Communist East Germany's
leaders have insisted that it will
