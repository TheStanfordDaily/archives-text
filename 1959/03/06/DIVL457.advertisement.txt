Scoring big with slick ideas
like the Electronic Secretary unit,

Your phone is always "tended" when an Electronic Secretary unit
is on your "line." For it answers calls in your absence and takes
messages as well!
Here's how it works. When your phone rings, a recorded voice informs
thr caller that you are out—and invites him to leave his name, number
nnd any information he wishes you to have.
When you rcturn-or when you phone in—all calls arc repeated to
you word for word. Result: no more "missed" messages, no more lost
business, no more worrying about leaving the phone unattended
any hour of the day or night.
This is just one of many ways Gen Tel is adding new dimensions to
Toiniraii telephone communication. We know that, in an America which is
expanding fast on all fronts, it is imperative to expand both telephone
V YST "v service and telephone versatility.
And we're meeting the challenge by developing new products and
fa?■■i- better methods for bringing more and more people together.
