# TALKS CONTINUE
## GE, Stanford Will Build Atom Reactor on Campus 
### Jack Clumeck 
Negotiations are nearing final stages between Stanford and the
General Eleetrie Company in a $175,000 contract which will bring a
ID-kilowatt, pool-type nuclear reactor to the University's Harris J.
Ryan Laboratory.
Insurance details have set back the signing date several times in

the past few weeks. Construction
will begin immediately upon the
consummation of negotiations.
Training Aid
Construction of the reactor will
begin as soon as the contract is
signed. "We expect that if will
be a training aid as well as a re
search tool." stated Professor
George Leppert. director of the
Nuclear Technology Laboratory,
who, with Professor Wayne S.
Brown, will be in charge of the
reactor. Leppert continued, "We
expect that it will be ready for
next September."
A $150,000 educational assist
ance grant from the Atomic En
ergy Commission will partially
finance the installation. An addi
tion;!! $25,000 has been given by
the C. F. Braun Trust of Alham
bra for housing the reactor and
its related facilities, lo include
a radiochemistry research labora
tory, a radioactivity e o un t e r
room, a reactor heat transfer re
search laboratory, and a machine
shop and faculty offices.
Space Appropriated
Stanford has appropriated $87,-
500 to provide 3200 square feet of
instructional, laboratory and lock
er space inside the Ryan Lab
building, and for painting and
landscaping to improve the exte
rior appearance.
"The lo kilowatt Pool Training
Reactor is an extremely versatile
research and educational tool, do
signed specifically for universi
ties and colleges," said David Ben
der of General Electric's Atomic
Power Equipment Department.
"It is an inherently safe reac
tor," added Professor Brown.
"The radioactive radiation will be
shielded well within the AEC tol
erance limits," he continued, "and
A EC representatives inspect reg
ularly in periodic checks of safety
procedures. In addition, all oper
ating personnel have to be li
censed by the AEC."
Graduate Labs
The reactor will be used in con
junction with laboratory courses
the graduate level. "It will en
able us to offer a lot more to
graduate students in our lab
courses, and to train more nuclear
engineers and train them better,"
Drown concluded.
Sandwich type fuel plates of
AEC-loaned uranium (U-235) and
aluminum will comprise the reac
tor's core. About the size of a
two-foot cube, the core will rest
near the bottom of a circular pool
of deminerali/.ed water, used for

j cooling and shielding purposes,
eight feet in diameter and 22 feet
deep.
Built entirely above the ground
on the floor of the laboratory
building, the reactor will stand
about 25 feet high. To provide ad
ditional radiation shielding* its
walls will be at least seven feet
thick at the base, tapering in step
fashion to about two feet at the
top. The pool's outside shape will
be octagonal, 22 feet across and
88 feet around its base.
Thermal Column
j Two "beam ports" and a "ther
mal column" will give direct ac
| cess to the core from outside the
base. These will be used o carry
a neutron beam in tlaboratory cx
; pcrimcnts, and as containers for
1 producing radio isotopes.
A steel bridge will extend
across the pool's open top where
operators can work safely, shield
ed from radiation by the deep
water. Reactor controls arc sus
! ponded from this bridge, which
in turn will connect to an existing
laboratory balcony where the re
actor's control board will be lo
cated.
Automatic Cut-off
1 The reactor is engineered to
j cut off automatically if its core
I gels too "hot," Professor Leppert
; said. However, even if all its au
tomatic safeguards were removed
and it ran uncontrolled, the reac
tor is so designed that no damage
could result except perhaps to the
interior of the reactor itself.
Upon its completion, the nu
clear power teaching facility
should rank among the best of its
j kind, concluded Professor Lcp-
I pert.
The Nuclear Technology Labo*
! ralory presently has a subcritieal
nuclear assembly powered by $80,*
()()() worth of AEC-loaned ura
nium.

who, with Professor Wayne S.
Brown, will be in charge of the
reactor. Leppert continued, "We
expect that it will be ready for
next September."
A $150,000 educational assist
ance grant from the Atomic En
ergy Commission will partially
finance the installation. An addi
tion;!! $25,000 has been given by
the C. F. Braun Trust of Alham
bra for housing the reactor and
its related facilities, lo include
a radiochemistry research labora
tory, a radioactivity e o un t e r
room, a reactor heat transfer re
search laboratory, and a machine
shop and faculty offices.
Space Appropriated
Stanford has appropriated $87,-
500 to provide 3200 square feet of
instructional, laboratory and lock
er space inside the Ryan Lab
building, and for painting and
landscaping to improve the exte
rior appearance.
"The lo kilowatt Pool Training
Reactor is an extremely versatile
research and educational tool, do
signed specifically for universi
ties and colleges," said David Ben
der of General Electric's Atomic
Power Equipment Department.
"It is an inherently safe reac
tor," added Professor Brown.
"The radioactive radiation will be
shielded well within the AEC tol
erance limits," he continued, "and
A EC representatives inspect reg
ularly in periodic checks of safety
procedures. In addition, all oper
ating personnel have to be li
censed by the AEC."
Graduate Labs
The reactor will be used in con
junction with laboratory courses
the graduate level. "It will en
able us to offer a lot more to
graduate students in our lab
courses, and to train more nuclear
engineers and train them better,"
Drown concluded.
Sandwich type fuel plates of
AEC-loaned uranium (U-235) and
aluminum will comprise the reac
tor's core. About the size of a
two-foot cube, the core will rest
near the bottom of a circular pool
of deminerali/.ed water, used for

j cooling and shielding purposes,
eight feet in diameter and 22 feet
deep.
Built entirely above the ground
on the floor of the laboratory
building, the reactor will stand
about 25 feet high. To provide ad
ditional radiation shielding* its
walls will be at least seven feet
thick at the base, tapering in step
fashion to about two feet at the
top. The pool's outside shape will
be octagonal, 22 feet across and
88 feet around its base.
Thermal Column
j Two "beam ports" and a "ther
mal column" will give direct ac
| cess to the core from outside the
base. These will be used o carry
a neutron beam in tlaboratory cx
; pcrimcnts, and as containers for
1 producing radio isotopes.
A steel bridge will extend
across the pool's open top where
operators can work safely, shield
ed from radiation by the deep
water. Reactor controls arc sus
! ponded from this bridge, which
in turn will connect to an existing
laboratory balcony where the re
actor's control board will be lo
cated.
Automatic Cut-off
1 The reactor is engineered to
j cut off automatically if its core
I gels too "hot," Professor Leppert
; said. However, even if all its au
tomatic safeguards were removed
and it ran uncontrolled, the reac
tor is so designed that no damage
could result except perhaps to the
interior of the reactor itself.
Upon its completion, the nu
clear power teaching facility
should rank among the best of its
j kind, concluded Professor Lcp-
I pert.
The Nuclear Technology Labo*
! ralory presently has a subcritieal
nuclear assembly powered by $80,*

nium.

Stanford has appropriated $87,-
500 to provide 3200 square feet of
instructional, laboratory and lock
er space inside the Ryan Lab
building, and for painting and
landscaping to improve the exte
rior appearance.
"The lo kilowatt Pool Training
Reactor is an extremely versatile
research and educational tool, do
signed specifically for universi
ties and colleges," said David Ben
der of General Electric's Atomic
Power Equipment Department.
"It is an inherently safe reac
tor," added Professor Brown.
"The radioactive radiation will be
shielded well within the AEC tol
erance limits," he continued, "and
A EC representatives inspect reg
ularly in periodic checks of safety
procedures. In addition, all oper
ating personnel have to be li
censed by the AEC."
Graduate Labs
The reactor will be used in con
junction with laboratory courses
the graduate level. "It will en
able us to offer a lot more to
graduate students in our lab
courses, and to train more nuclear
engineers and train them better,"
Drown concluded.
Sandwich type fuel plates of
AEC-loaned uranium (U-235) and
aluminum will comprise the reac
tor's core. About the size of a
two-foot cube, the core will rest
near the bottom of a circular pool
of deminerali/.ed water, used for

j cooling and shielding purposes,
eight feet in diameter and 22 feet
deep.
Built entirely above the ground
on the floor of the laboratory
building, the reactor will stand
about 25 feet high. To provide ad
ditional radiation shielding* its
walls will be at least seven feet
thick at the base, tapering in step
fashion to about two feet at the
top. The pool's outside shape will
be octagonal, 22 feet across and
88 feet around its base.
Thermal Column
j Two "beam ports" and a "ther
mal column" will give direct ac
| cess to the core from outside the
base. These will be used o carry
a neutron beam in tlaboratory cx
; pcrimcnts, and as containers for
1 producing radio isotopes.
A steel bridge will extend
across the pool's open top where
operators can work safely, shield
ed from radiation by the deep
water. Reactor controls arc sus
! ponded from this bridge, which
in turn will connect to an existing
laboratory balcony where the re
actor's control board will be lo
cated.
Automatic Cut-off
1 The reactor is engineered to
j cut off automatically if its core
I gels too "hot," Professor Leppert
; said. However, even if all its au
tomatic safeguards were removed
and it ran uncontrolled, the reac
tor is so designed that no damage
could result except perhaps to the
interior of the reactor itself.
Upon its completion, the nu
clear power teaching facility
should rank among the best of its
j kind, concluded Professor Lcp-
I pert.
The Nuclear Technology Labo*
! ralory presently has a subcritieal
nuclear assembly powered by $80,*
()()() worth of AEC-loaned ura
nium.

Soon to be purchased by Stanford
Negotiations are nearing final stages between Stanford and the
General Eleetrie Company in a $175,000 contract which will bring a
ID-kilowatt, pool-type nuclear reactor to the University's Harris J.
Ryan Laboratory.
Insurance details have set back the signing date several times in

the past few weeks. Construction
will begin immediately upon the
consummation of negotiations.
Training Aid
Construction of the reactor will
begin as soon as the contract is
signed. "We expect that if will
be a training aid as well as a re
search tool." stated Professor
George Leppert. director of the
Nuclear Technology Laboratory,
who, with Professor Wayne S.
Brown, will be in charge of the
reactor. Leppert continued, "We
expect that it will be ready for
next September."
A $150,000 educational assist
ance grant from the Atomic En
ergy Commission will partially
finance the installation. An addi
tion;!! $25,000 has been given by
the C. F. Braun Trust of Alham
bra for housing the reactor and
its related facilities, lo include
a radiochemistry research labora
tory, a radioactivity e o un t e r
room, a reactor heat transfer re
search laboratory, and a machine
shop and faculty offices.
