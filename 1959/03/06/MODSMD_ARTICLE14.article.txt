# Chappie Late?
## 
### 
The Chappie, scheduled to ap
pear next Wednesday, may be late
but it isn't the oid Boy's fault
this time.
All of the copy is ready for
printing, but the covers have not
arrived from a national advertis
ing agency in the East.
If the covers do not arrive be
fore the printing deadline, Chap
pie will not appear until the be
ginning of spring quarter.
