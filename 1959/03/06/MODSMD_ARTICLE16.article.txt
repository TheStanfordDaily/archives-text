## Improving the System 
### 
Tin. Stanford advisf.k svstf.m is extremely inefficient. Yesterday
we discussed how a system of continuity in a«1 vi>ii» «x could prove
more beneficial t<» the student from llie standpoint «»( providing
a more directed and integrated I niversily program.
Today ice will /mini out how this same system would
make advising more efficient from a strictly medianical
standpoint.
The program we advoeale is based on only one required meet
ing eaeh year between student and adviser. If this meeting came
during the latter part of spring quarter, tlie student would plan
his program for the entire following year, get his adviser's signa
ture on this, and not have to return again until a year later. For
freshmen and transfers, advising would he handled f;i 11 quarter
or at the start of their first quarter at Stanford.
To put stieh a program into effect icould require de
partments to plan further ahead in class scheduling. Some
depart merits already plan classes a year in advance, but
others frequently do not submit schedules until the final
deadline before lime Schedule [tririfing.
Since a rough draft of courses must even now he submitted in
spring for the Announcement of Courses, there seems no reason
why this draft could not be finali/ed for purposes of printing an
all-year Time Schedule.
}} ith the all-year 7 ime Schedule and consequent full
year course planning, advisers would be freed from hav
ing to go through the motions of glancing at and signing
scores of programs each quarter. And students iron hi
also save time.
During the remainder of the year, advisers would then have
more time to consult v>ith those students most in need of advice
the student who keeps changing his mind about what courses to
take, or can't choose a major, or is uncertain about possible future
careers.
As things now stand, so much of advisers' time is taken
up with mechanical details concerning programs of stu
dents who know what they want and don"t need the advice
that there's little time remaining for those really in need
of consultation.
We see, then, benefits of program continuity, efficiency , nd
more adviser time for students needing it if onee-a-year program
ing is initiated. \\ e see no insurmountable obstacles to such a
program. This adds up, we feel, to a strong recommendation for
once-a-year advising and year-long program planning.

once-a-year advising and year-long program planning.

Tin. Stanford advisf.k svstf.m is extremely inefficient. Yesterday
we discussed how a system of continuity in a«1 vi>ii» «x could prove
more beneficial t<» the student from llie standpoint «»( providing
a more directed and integrated I niversily program.
Today ice will /mini out how this same system would
make advising more efficient from a strictly medianical
standpoint.
The program we advoeale is based on only one required meet
ing eaeh year between student and adviser. If this meeting came
during the latter part of spring quarter, tlie student would plan
his program for the entire following year, get his adviser's signa
ture on this, and not have to return again until a year later. For
freshmen and transfers, advising would he handled f;i 11 quarter
or at the start of their first quarter at Stanford.
To put stieh a program into effect icould require de
partments to plan further ahead in class scheduling. Some
depart merits already plan classes a year in advance, but
others frequently do not submit schedules until the final
deadline before lime Schedule [tririfing.
Since a rough draft of courses must even now he submitted in
spring for the Announcement of Courses, there seems no reason
why this draft could not be finali/ed for purposes of printing an
all-year Time Schedule.
}} ith the all-year 7 ime Schedule and consequent full
year course planning, advisers would be freed from hav
ing to go through the motions of glancing at and signing
scores of programs each quarter. And students iron hi
also save time.
During the remainder of the year, advisers would then have
more time to consult v>ith those students most in need of advice
the student who keeps changing his mind about what courses to
take, or can't choose a major, or is uncertain about possible future
careers.
As things now stand, so much of advisers' time is taken
up with mechanical details concerning programs of stu
dents who know what they want and don"t need the advice
that there's little time remaining for those really in need
of consultation.
We see, then, benefits of program continuity, efficiency , nd
more adviser time for students needing it if onee-a-year program
ing is initiated. \\ e see no insurmountable obstacles to such a
program. This adds up, we feel, to a strong recommendation for
once-a-year advising and year-long program planning.
