AN APPEAL TO JESTING
PARLETT '
0 Brother Parlett, you do me
wrong
B And put me on a dreadful spot,
Lump me with Norman in your
song,
Remind me of brothers I'd for
got.
1 can feel like a brother to a billy
goat,

Rut how feel palsy to Billy Gra
ham?
And the words that surge from
Vincent's throat
Stir me to negative thoughts of
mayhefn.
I could be a brother to bloody
Nero,
But Peale's appeal rirjgs out so
phony
That, instead of making him my
hero,
I rail on Parlett to be my crony.
