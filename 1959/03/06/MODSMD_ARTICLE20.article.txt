"Sovereign People's" Voice
Editor, The Daily:
With regard to loyalty oaths,
Feb. 24, enter Mr. Dave Long. lie
evidently is a spokesman for the
"sovereign people'' otherwise
known as "the American people."
Through him we discover that the
only way to maintain freedom
and preserve democracy is to
make a dictatorship out of it. Dis
sent by a minority is wrong if the
overwhelming majority of the
people decide a question.
Mr. Long realizes thai higher
education is the path to strategic
positions in our society. He does
not seem to be aware that appli
cants for these positions must
swear to loyalty oaihs and pass
security clearances. Surely this is
a more fitting time for such meas
ures.
Would it not be possible that
association at a university with
right-thinking people like Mr.
Long would make these students
see the error o! their ways.
