## Personally Speaking Lectures—3 Days a Week 
### Leo Krulitz 
A very significant step was tak
en the other day when the faculty
ol the School of Humanities and
Sciences recommended to I>epart
rnenls and Professors that lec
lures b»* held only three times ;i
'I week for a five unit course.
Perhaps we should qualify this
i and say il I AN be a significant
; step if Departments anil Profes
sors A< < KPT the recommend
ation and institute the sugges
ted changes in their tall courses
next year.
This recommendation suggests
to us that the University is mov
ing in significant strides toward
a more informal, and if we might
add, more meaningful type of
I education.
Perhaps it is in order to suggest
| gest why an informal type of
[education might have more mean
ing.
Informal education leads away
from the assembly line, lecture
room process of cramming and
stuffing as much information
into 25 or 700 heads —it makes
j no difference — with .the hope
that the information will stay,
to a kind of e ilucati on that
places more of the emphasis
and responsibility on the indivi
dual student with whom the
thoughts slay because he has
sought them out himself.
Fewer lectures will mean that
! more individual work will be done
by the student reading and re
searching, and digging out for
himself information and ideas;
and because he has done il on his
own it will mean more to him.
But this individual work will
- become even more significant if
professors will use the time that
will accrue to them by not hav
■ ing to prepare and deliver the
■ extra lecture to meet with stu
' dents.
They might hold longer office
I hours, or preferably, Professors

might meet wllli sliult'nis in
formally tor coffee al 1 lit* (
lur, lor dinner at out* of lll**
houses, or any place, just for
Ihe purpose of talking—about
the ideas that Ihe student has
come across in tin* course read
ing, or in I lie lectures.
Or perhaps Ihe class, if it's
small enough, could meet option
ally during Ihe hour gained, for
discussions on I lie reading ma
terial and lectures, not in the class
room, hut in the house lounges,
the Amphitheater, or anywhere
that's convenient.
Why can informal education
he more valuable? Because it
brings the student and teacher
closer together, because lecturing
and teaching are often two differ
ent things, because asking'is often
as valuable as listening and an
swering, because it's good to "do"
in addition to "being done to,"
and because it's enjoyable to
learn. If education is something
that has to be taken in regular
hourly doses like a distasteful
medicine, then we'd suggest it is
praetically meaningless.
