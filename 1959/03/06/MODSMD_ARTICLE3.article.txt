# Tribe Hoop Slate Against OSC
## 
### Russ Allen 
Co-captain Paul Neumann will
lead Stanford cagors out against
the invading Oregon State Reav
ers tonight willi hopes of netting
a PCC third place and a 10-6 rec

Stanford scorers.
Neumann will get help from
co-captain and center Dick Haga.
who is also playing his last Card
game and who should provide the
necessary rebounding for the In

per game average. The 6-5 center

take up the slack in adding to
Card scoring.
At the other guard position, sen
