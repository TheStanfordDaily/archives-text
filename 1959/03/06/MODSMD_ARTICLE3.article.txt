# Tribe Hoop Slate Against OSC
## 
### Russ Allen 
Co-captain Paul Neumann will
lead Stanford cagors out against
the invading Oregon State Reav
ers tonight willi hopes of netting
a PCC third place and a 10-6 rec
ord. A win would give the Tribe
basketball squad their best season
since tho '."Sfi days of another Card
"Mighty-Mite" George Selleck.
Most of the Indian cagors are a
little glad to see the season come
to an end no more trips or work
outs under coach Howie Dallmar
but to floor captain Neumann
and four other seniors who are
suiting up for their last time, the
game has some special meaning.
Neumann, Stanford's hot-shot
guard, who is referred to by his
coach as the complete player and
has no weaknesses, will have an
other tough assignment in guard
ing the Beavers' Lee llarman.
This is a fitting finale to Neu
mann's work here on The Farm,
as the high-scoring guard has al
ways been given the top opposi
tion players — such as Washing
ton's Doug Smart and UCLA's
Walt Torrence —to guard, plus the
assignment of scoring in double
figures.
If Neumann can hold Harman
down tonight while scoring 24
points, the Cards should win and
Paul would finish up with 1,000
points and fifth place in all-time
Stanford scorers.
Neumann will get help from
co-captain and center Dick Haga.
who is also playing his last Card
game and who should provide the
necessary rebounding for the In
dian victory.
Haga has shown fine shooting
skill of late and is currently in
eighth place in the PCC individual
scoring race, with a fat 13.1 points
per game average. The 6-5 center
can certainly be counted upon to
take up the slack in adding to
Card scoring.
At the other guard position, sen
ior Doug Warren will be starting.
Warren, a hustling, hard worker
and team man, will also be out to
help beat the Beavers and make
his 1,1 I appearance a I tin* Pavilion
it memorable one.
Junior forwards .John Arrijlaga
and John Hendry round mil Hie
Tribe starting lineup. Arrillaga's
fine outside shooting and Hen
dry's good rebounding are defi
nile assets to lhe leam.
You can he sure thai seniors
Jerry Rose and Tom Ci'awford
will he seeing aelion al the guard
positions tonight. Jerr\ Thuesen
and (.'ln is luirford will also he
playing al the forward spots.
Slals (Jill's visiting orangeand
hlack Beavers fi om Corvallis will
throw their lop man Harman up
against the Indians. The scrappy
guard is currently in fifth place in

PCC snoring and was leading the
pack for a good part of the season.
Besides Iho high-scoring l iar
man, the Indians will have lo eon
lend wiili Jim Woodland, at Ihe
other guard post. Woodland was
instrumental in the Beaver vic
tory up north earlier this season
as he netted I'd hig points.
The two OSC forwards will
probably be Ted Miller, a convert
ed guard, and Steve Flynn, sopho
more from Mountain View. Sen
ior Gary Goble, at 0-8, or sopho
more Karl Anderson, a tall player
from Oakland, will start at center,
rounding out the Beaver lineup.
