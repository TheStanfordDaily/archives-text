# Track Season Opens Saturday
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Slightly shuffled, slightly injured and slightly favored Stanford
will open its 19r>9 track and field season in San Jose tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. against San Jose State and the Santa Clara County Youth Vil
lage.
Dual competition between the Indians and Spartans figures to go

down to the relay, since each
team is very strong in a few
events and pretty weak in others.
The Youth Village will furnish
several outstanding individuals,
but hasn't anywhere near enough
depth to be ;i factor in triangular
scoring.
The princip.ll shuffling involves
Dean Smith, last year's top sprint
er. He'll move to the 440 and low
hurdles tomorrow. Coach Payton
Jordan anticipates world record
holder Ray Norton and Boh Poyn
ter dominating the dashes for San
Jose, and figures Smith can gar
ner more te:im points by switch
ing.
Definitely out of the meet are
Norman Lloyd with a muscle pull,
Brooks Townsend with thigh
trouble, and Jerry Winters, ineli
gible until at least spring quarter.
Doubtl'uls are Norm Pease, Don
Chesarek and Doug Martin, with
ailments ranging from a cut foot
to muscle trouble to the flu.
The day's top race looks to he
the mile, which features an inter
national field. Stanford has Ernie
Cunliffe and Norwegian Berlil
Lundh, while the SCCYV has
Hungarians Las/lo Tabori and
Handor Kraus.
Lundh has 1500- meter times
which compare to a near-4:00
mile. Cunliffe clocked 1:150.2 for
an NSO, and is the first man ever
to beat Don Bowden a 1 the dis
tance. Tabori, a Hungarian exile,
is a sub-four-minute miler who's
fresh from an Eastern indoor
tour, while Kraus is Hungarian
junior champ.
Cunliffe will also run the 880,
and Lundh may join him there.
Cunliffe, who'll anchor the relay

team if Chesarek doesn't compete,
is one of four Indians who'll go in
three events.
The others ate Dick Lassen,
440, N.X(i and relay; Skip Face,
high jump, javelin and broad
jump; and John Nourse, highs,
lows and high jump.
An excellent two-mile is in store
pitting Stanford's Keith Wallace
against San Jose's Don Kelly and
the Youth Village's Wil King.
Wallace is American junior rec
ord-holder at the distance, while
King was one of the country's
most improved distance men last
yea r.
Among the best field event
duels will be the broad jumping
bath between John Kelly and the
Spartans' Mac Burton. Both were
well over 24 feet in 19;')8. With
Winters out, Bob Atkinson draws
top responsibility in the shot put.
Stanford's discus duo of Harlan
j Limrner and Armand DeWeese
will also get a baptism under
fire which may tell whether they
can quit fouling when the com
petition gets keen.
With Pease out and Smith
moved, Ben Anixter draws the un
enviable task ol trying to catch
Norton and Poynter. As has been
the case for the past two years,
Mike Franchetti represents the
best Stanford hopes in the pole
vault.
Admission to the meet, in San
Jose's South Seventh Street sta
dium, will be 60 cents for stu
dents. Seating facilities are lim
ited to 1200.
