# Chevy stops quickest... goes farthest on a gallon!
## 
### 
Chevy showed the best brakes of the
leading low-priced three in a test of
repeated stops at highway speeds con
ducted and certified by NASCAR*.
Chevy also won over the other two in
a NASCAR economy run—with the
highest gas mileage for f>'s and V8's at
cruising speeds of just over 55 miles
an hour.

Here's a car that knows how to get
the most out of a gallon. And it's the
only car in its field to bring you
hydraulic valve lifters in all popular
engines—6 and V8. This means
smoother, quieter performance for you.
There are many other advances just
as fundamental as the efficiency of
Chevrolet's engines and the depend-

ability of its new brakes (with more lin
ing area than any ot her low-priced car).
But why not stop by your dealer's and
let Chevy do its own sweet talking!
