as ho faces the Oregon State Bea
vers in the final game of his ca
reer.
History awaits Neumann to
night. Twenty-four points will
make him the fifth player in Stan
lord history to score 1000 or more
points rluring a career.
Or 17 [joints will make him < 1 j
the fifth all-time scorer, passing
Jim Ramsteart, and (2) the eighth
Card in history to score 400 points
in one season.
Or a big evening of 29 points
would push him past George SCl
leck as Stanford's No. 4 all-time
scorer.
A niche in the Stanford basket
ball Hall of Fame is no small
honor. Consider some of those al
ready here: Hank Luisetti, con
sidered by many as the game's
greatest player; Jim Pollard, for
many years the feared running
mate of George Mikan on the un

stoppable Minneapolis Lakers;
George Yardley, who last season
became the first professional in
history to score more than 2000
points in one season.
For "lesser" lights there have
been other little men like all-time
scoring leader Ron Tomsic, who
pumped home 1415 points in his
career 1 ; 5-8 George Selleck, the
fourth all-time scorer; or Jim
Walsh, star of the perennial AAU
champion Phillips 'GGers.
Nobody is denying Neumann's
right to step in with names like
these.
Neumann was named this week
j as Northern California's Player
; of the Year following here be
! hind such recent names as Kenny
I Sears and Bill Russell.
Paid has supplied Pavilionites

vviih a thousand thrills this year,
right l'rom his brilliant shooting
display that opened the season
against San Jose State hack in De

show that delight fully sank
Southern California last week.
The biggest thrill of all may bo

as ho faces the Oregon State Bea
vers in the final game of his ca
reer.
History awaits Neumann to
night. Twenty-four points will
make him the fifth player in Stan
lord history to score 1000 or more
points rluring a career.
Or 17 [joints will make him < 1 j
the fifth all-time scorer, passing
Jim Ramsteart, and (2) the eighth
Card in history to score 400 points
in one season.
Or a big evening of 29 points
would push him past George SCl
leck as Stanford's No. 4 all-time
scorer.
A niche in the Stanford basket
ball Hall of Fame is no small
honor. Consider some of those al
ready here: Hank Luisetti, con
sidered by many as the game's
greatest player; Jim Pollard, for
many years the feared running
mate of George Mikan on the un

stoppable Minneapolis Lakers;
George Yardley, who last season
became the first professional in
history to score more than 2000
points in one season.
For "lesser" lights there have
been other little men like all-time
scoring leader Ron Tomsic, who
pumped home 1415 points in his
career 1 ; 5-8 George Selleck, the
fourth all-time scorer; or Jim
Walsh, star of the perennial AAU
champion Phillips 'GGers.
Nobody is denying Neumann's
right to step in with names like
these.
Neumann was named this week
j as Northern California's Player
; of the Year following here be
! hind such recent names as Kenny
I Sears and Bill Russell.
Paid has supplied Pavilionites

vviih a thousand thrills this year,
right l'rom his brilliant shooting
display that opened the season
against San Jose State hack in De
cember to his brilliant 26 - point
show that delight fully sank
Southern California last week.
The biggest thrill of all may bo
on tap tonight.
