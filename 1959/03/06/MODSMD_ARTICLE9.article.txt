shift in emphasis of tho men's sponsoring program.

and Bill Tiederman.
Martin explained that over the
past four years the sponsor pro
pram in Wilbur has been attempt

ready exist, he said.
Martin said that the sponsor
program has sometimes overem
phasized the social adjustment of
freshmen, neglecting their intel

Counseling and Testing Service to

intelligent and sophisticated han
dling of freshman problems. Mar
tin and the present committee
want these services to be em
ployed more in the future.
The committee also hopes to
increase the role of sponsors in
promoting student - faculty rela
tionships. Martin explained that
this past year sponsors have been
trying to arrange frequent con
tact among frosh men and fac
ulty members, when genuine in
terest seems to indicate that some
communication might come with
proximity.
Sponsor Applications
He added that faculty residents
are extremely helpful in this re
spect, both in accustoming fresh
men to talking with faculty, and
in providing in their homes, which
adjoin the Wilbur houses, a set
ting conducive to rewarding dis
cussion.
Applications for men's sponsor

Develop Changes
This year's Men's Sponsor Se
lection Committee expressed an
interest in selecting sponsors who
will further develop some of the
recent changes in emphasis of the
men's sponsoring program.
The Men's Sponsor Selection
Committee is concerned with the
responsibilities of individual per
sonal and academic counseling
and friendship with freshmen,
Martin explained, as well as with
group leadership for floor activi
ties.
Advice Used
This year's sponsors have been
making use of the services of the
Counseling and Testing Service to
train and assist them in a more
intelligent and sophisticated han
dling of freshman problems. Mar
tin and the present committee
want these services to be em
ployed more in the future.
The committee also hopes to
increase the role of sponsors in
promoting student - faculty rela
tionships. Martin explained that
this past year sponsors have been
trying to arrange frequent con
tact among frosh men and fac
ulty members, when genuine in
terest seems to indicate that some
communication might come with
proximity.
Sponsor Applications
He added that faculty residents
are extremely helpful in this re
spect, both in accustoming fresh
men to talking with faculty, and
in providing in their homes, which
adjoin the Wilbur houses, a set
ting conducive to rewarding dis
cussion.
Applications for men's sponsor
ing for next year will be available
the first two weeks of spring
quarter, Martin said, and inter
viewing will tnke place about the
third week of the quarter.

selected his committee for spring quarter men's sponsor choosing,
ami begun with them the formulation of a program to continue the
shift in emphasis of tho men's sponsoring program.
Committee members arc Jerry Berg, George Boldt, John Hansen

and Bill Tiederman.
Martin explained that over the
past four years the sponsor pro
pram in Wilbur has been attempt
ing to accept more responsibility
for presenting a more balanced
picture of undergraduate oppor
tunities at Stanford. The begin
nings of a counseling program,
and an academic and cultural as
well as a social orientation, al
ready exist, he said.
Martin said that the sponsor
program has sometimes overem
phasized the social adjustment of
freshmen, neglecting their intel
lectual development. This unbal
anced approach has been partial
ly corrected in recent years, but
he emphasized that the needs of
new freshman classes arc chang
ing freshmen arc more academi
