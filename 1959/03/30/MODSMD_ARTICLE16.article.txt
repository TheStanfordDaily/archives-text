Shrinc QUARTER: I lie quarter «»f 111 ** lower curve ami ihe reason
ibu'l hard l«i find. One glance at the crowded social calendar gives
the biggest |»a ft of the explanation.
Such an overcrowded calendar of social ant! cultural
emits only adds to llic extraneous /treasures which stu
dents normally are subjected lit by too many unnecessary
midterms, repel it ions assignments, anil the plain busy
work that many /professors still impost'. And us impoi
taut, with so many calualde events com pet inn, /'" hauled
student lime, many must necessarily he by passeil.
Hushing will hardly lie over before three weeks oi campaign
ing for spring elections begins. I his will he followed by a week
long (lon Home Drive, the lIK foreign Policy Institute, Spring
Show, and Spring Sing. Mixed in on the week ends are the ASSI 1
hostels, not to mention numerous house formats, happy hours,
and an over-generous sprinkling of leas and talks.
I lie problem isn't one of climinulion but one of <hs-
Iribntiiui and cooriliualioti. II e call lo mind llie barren

The solution to the problem, we feel, is belter communication
between the ASS IJ and the University's Committee on Public Ex
ercises, and, probably more important, "year-ahead planning with
the though! in mind of balancing the social and cultural calendar
over all three quarters.
