By now members of Congress
must have a pretty good idea how
distivssed foreign service officers
are to see so many taking the
novel, "The Ugly American," as
the typical U. S. diplomat.
For weeks the newspapers have
been reporting the news of how
Congressmen are packing their
payrolls with relatives, paying
some children attending college
high salaries for work way be
yond their experience; how some
use government money to pay
henchmen back home to do poli
tical chores; how another Con
gressman paid himself rent for
the use of his front porch as an
alleged "office," and all the while
trying to cover it up with that
curtain of "classified" secrecy
which they criticize so virtuously
when the executive branch of the
government does the same thing.
it is well to have all this in
the open. It is the only way it
will he eoreoted. But just as the
"llgly American" is a portrait
of the exception among Amer
icans serving abroad, so the
"ugly Congressman "-who hires
his relatives in order to keep
his office-pay allowances in the
family and who is so proud of
it that he wants to keep it se
cret — Is the exception among
honest and honorable members
of Congress.
I,aw No Answer
I am not one v/ho believes that
the instant answer to any prob
lem is to pass another law. It is
not useful to lay down a blanket
rule that a Congressman must
never employ a relative on his
staff. 1 have known, Senators who
have drawn their wives from their
secretarial staffs and who have
employed their wives on theii
staffs to very good purpose.
It seems to me that the correc
tive l'or the abuse by Congress
men of the right to employ in
competent relatives to do useful
work and political henchmen to
do useless work is publicity. And

that's what many of the "ugly
Congressmen" have been getting.
This publicity will either bring
about some payroll changes, as it
has already, or at the very least
it will let the voters in the Con
gressmen's own districts know
what's going on so they can take
appropriate action at the next
election.
Payrolls Public
Kilt unlike the House of Rep
resentatives, which makes pub
lic the Washington payroll of
every member —whom he hires
and what he pays them —the
Senate is lighting off the cor
rective power of publicity as
though it were a plague.
This practice of covering up
the salaries ol the Senators' staffs
is relatively new. It was begun in
1948 when the Republicans were
in control of the Senate. The Sen
ators found this secrecy so much
to their liking that both parties
have perpetuated it ever since.
Some prominent Senators, like
Sens. Jacob Javits and Kenneth
Keating of New York, Sen. Paul
Douglas ol Illinois, Sen. Richard
Neuberger of Oregon, and others,
favor dropping this secrecy. But
Senate Republican Leader Everett
M. Dirksen of Illinois wants to
keep the secrecy. He is morally
indignant at the very thought ol
making Senate stafl salaries pub
lic.
Sense of Morale
"We have a high sense of
morale in the Senate," be said.
"We don't want girls gathering
al the water fountain and one
saying to the other, 'W«*ll, kid,
you get $ti() a month more than
I do.' "
It didn't seem to affect the mo
rale in the Senate before 1948. It
doesn't hurt the morale in the
House to reveal how Congressmen
use tlie money provided to them
In Washington. Senate commit
tees disclose their stall salaries
without any impairment of mo
i ale.
If the Senate is going to make
its voice heard in breaking down
secrecy elsewhere in the govern
ment, it* must show clean hands
by breaking down its own secrecy.
