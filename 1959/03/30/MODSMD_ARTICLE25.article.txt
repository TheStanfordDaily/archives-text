# Early Stanford Lead Erased By Speedy Tiger Trackmen
## DAILY Sports SCENE 
### Dick Barnes 
What started as a good day for Paylon Jordan's Stanford spikers
turned into a late-afternoon nightmare here Saturday as Occidental
College whipped the Indians for the sixth straight lime, 77-54.
A series of surprising early afternoon showings put the Cards in
contention much of the way, and left the score tied at 45-all after 10

events.
Hut earlier had news in the high
hurdles com I >i n< ■< I with severe re
verses in three of the last live
events lo give I he Timers a final
victory ih:11 was about as doped.
Captain Don Chesarek, Jim
Baekstraud, all the Indian rniiers
and both of the high jumpers
shone brightest in what was in
some respects a very encouraging
Tribe effort.
L'rnie Cunliffe, Bertil Lundh
and Hob Monzingo got the Indians
off fast vvilh a surprise sweep in
the mile, shut ling oul Oxy star
Tod While.
Close Finish
Hanging several yards off the
pace of While and Bobby Rye,
Cunliffe and Lundh look the lead
after Ihree laps. They pulled
away steadily in the final 440,
and crossed I he finish virtually

abreast. Cunliffe got the decision
in meet record time of 4:12.
White, showing no final kick at
all, fell victim in the final 40 yards
to Mon/.ingo's excellent last-lap
spurt. His 4:14.7 was a personal
all-time best.
Chesarek finally licked his hab
it of flopping against the Tigers
i as he won a 48.3 quarter-mile. He
came off the final turn very
strongly after trailing earlier.
Bob Besse also had good reserve,
and pulled up in his last stride to
get second.
Out •of • shape Norman Lloyd
was a distant last in 51.2.
Baekstrand, meanwhile, was un
i leashing an ear ly throw of 211-11
that easily stood up as the best in
the javelin. It was his best-ever in
competit ion.
Over in the high jump, Paul
Gillespie and John Nourse were
each negotiating 0-2. It was far
from any kind of record height,
but was good enough to get them
a tie for first and six of the nine
points.
Kven after Dean Smith could
take only a 10.1 third in the 100,
the Indians had a seven-event
point lead of 36-27.
Oxy Sweep
But then came the high hurdles
and an as-expected sweep for Oc
cidental.
Following the highs was prob
bably the key race and turning
point of the meet the half-mile.
The Cards, to stay in contention,
had to get eight points here. But
they had to depend on Cunliffe
and Lundh to come back from the
mile against a fresh Jim Cerveny.
The Stan 112 or d pair started
strong, led for Ihe quarter in 55.5,
and continued in front in the back
stretch. But Cerveny hung on
easily, marie his move on the final
curve, and capitalized on his rela
tive freshness to gain and keep
the lead with 50 yards to go.
Cerveny clocked in at 1:51.2
excellent for this time of year.
Cunliffe was only four-tenths
back, and Lundh had a creditable
1:53.2 as he finished eased-up.
Dick Lassen, who ran third and
fourth all of the way, closed well
to hit 1:53.4.
DeYVeese Helps
Armand DeWeese's 1 GO- Idis
cus effort picked up five points
for the Cards and gave them the
45 - all point tie. A pole vault
S sweep, however, gave Occidental
a lead it never again relinquished.
Another hurdle sweep in the lows,
a first and second in the two-mile,
and a first and third in the 220
! quickly put the meet on ice.
Clarence Treat in winning the
I lows at 23.3 set the day's only
\ other meet record.
Though the team issue was al
! ready decided, Stanford none the
less came up with a quartet of
j good quarter-mile times to win
j the relay in 3:15.7.
Besse, running the third leg,
j had a career- best of 48.4 and gave
Chesarek an anchor lap lead that
he had no trouble holding.

OXY'S JIM CERVENY
He helped turn the tide
What started as a good day for Paylon Jordan's Stanford spikers
turned into a late-afternoon nightmare here Saturday as Occidental
College whipped the Indians for the sixth straight lime, 77-54.
A series of surprising early afternoon showings put the Cards in
contention much of the way, and left the score tied at 45-all after 10

events.
Hut earlier had news in the high
hurdles com I >i n< ■< I with severe re
verses in three of the last live
events lo give I he Timers a final
victory ih:11 was about as doped.
Captain Don Chesarek, Jim
Baekstraud, all the Indian rniiers
and both of the high jumpers
shone brightest in what was in
some respects a very encouraging
Tribe effort.
L'rnie Cunliffe, Bertil Lundh
and Hob Monzingo got the Indians
off fast vvilh a surprise sweep in
the mile, shut ling oul Oxy star
Tod While.
Close Finish
Hanging several yards off the
pace of While and Bobby Rye,
Cunliffe and Lundh look the lead
after Ihree laps. They pulled
away steadily in the final 440,
and crossed I he finish virtually

abreast. Cunliffe got the decision
in meet record time of 4:12.
White, showing no final kick at
all, fell victim in the final 40 yards
to Mon/.ingo's excellent last-lap
spurt. His 4:14.7 was a personal
all-time best.
Chesarek finally licked his hab
it of flopping against the Tigers
i as he won a 48.3 quarter-mile. He
came off the final turn very
strongly after trailing earlier.
Bob Besse also had good reserve,
and pulled up in his last stride to
get second.
Out •of • shape Norman Lloyd
was a distant last in 51.2.
Baekstrand, meanwhile, was un
i leashing an ear ly throw of 211-11
that easily stood up as the best in
the javelin. It was his best-ever in
competit ion.
Over in the high jump, Paul
Gillespie and John Nourse were
each negotiating 0-2. It was far
from any kind of record height,
but was good enough to get them
a tie for first and six of the nine
points.
Kven after Dean Smith could
take only a 10.1 third in the 100,
the Indians had a seven-event
point lead of 36-27.
Oxy Sweep
But then came the high hurdles
and an as-expected sweep for Oc
cidental.
Following the highs was prob
bably the key race and turning
point of the meet the half-mile.
The Cards, to stay in contention,
had to get eight points here. But
they had to depend on Cunliffe
and Lundh to come back from the
mile against a fresh Jim Cerveny.
The Stan 112 or d pair started
strong, led for Ihe quarter in 55.5,
and continued in front in the back
stretch. But Cerveny hung on
easily, marie his move on the final
curve, and capitalized on his rela
tive freshness to gain and keep
the lead with 50 yards to go.
Cerveny clocked in at 1:51.2
excellent for this time of year.
Cunliffe was only four-tenths
back, and Lundh had a creditable
1:53.2 as he finished eased-up.
Dick Lassen, who ran third and
fourth all of the way, closed well
to hit 1:53.4.
DeYVeese Helps
Armand DeWeese's 1 GO- Idis
cus effort picked up five points
for the Cards and gave them the
45 - all point tie. A pole vault
S sweep, however, gave Occidental
a lead it never again relinquished.
Another hurdle sweep in the lows,
a first and second in the two-mile,
and a first and third in the 220
! quickly put the meet on ice.
Clarence Treat in winning the
I lows at 23.3 set the day's only
\ other meet record.
Though the team issue was al

I lows at 23.3 set the day's only
\ other meet record.
Though the team issue was al

less came up with a quartet of
j good quarter-mile times to win
j the relay in 3:15.7.
Besse, running the third leg,
j had a career- best of 48.4 and gave
Chesarek an anchor lap lead that
he had no trouble holding.


OXY'S JIM CERVENY
He helped turn the tide
What started as a good day for Paylon Jordan's Stanford spikers
turned into a late-afternoon nightmare here Saturday as Occidental
College whipped the Indians for the sixth straight lime, 77-54.
A series of surprising early afternoon showings put the Cards in
contention much of the way, and left the score tied at 45-all after 10

events.
Hut earlier had news in the high
hurdles com I >i n< ■< I with severe re
verses in three of the last live
events lo give I he Timers a final
victory ih:11 was about as doped.
Captain Don Chesarek, Jim
Baekstraud, all the Indian rniiers
and both of the high jumpers
shone brightest in what was in
some respects a very encouraging
Tribe effort.
L'rnie Cunliffe, Bertil Lundh
and Hob Monzingo got the Indians
off fast vvilh a surprise sweep in
the mile, shut ling oul Oxy star
Tod While.
Close Finish
Hanging several yards off the
pace of While and Bobby Rye,
Cunliffe and Lundh look the lead
after Ihree laps. They pulled
away steadily in the final 440,
and crossed I he finish virtually

abreast. Cunliffe got the decision
in meet record time of 4:12.
White, showing no final kick at
all, fell victim in the final 40 yards
to Mon/.ingo's excellent last-lap
spurt. His 4:14.7 was a personal
all-time best.
Chesarek finally licked his hab
it of flopping against the Tigers
i as he won a 48.3 quarter-mile. He
came off the final turn very
strongly after trailing earlier.
Bob Besse also had good reserve,
and pulled up in his last stride to
get second.
Out •of • shape Norman Lloyd
was a distant last in 51.2.
Baekstrand, meanwhile, was un
i leashing an ear ly throw of 211-11
that easily stood up as the best in
the javelin. It was his best-ever in
competit ion.
Over in the high jump, Paul
Gillespie and John Nourse were
each negotiating 0-2. It was far
from any kind of record height,
but was good enough to get them
a tie for first and six of the nine
points.
Kven after Dean Smith could
take only a 10.1 third in the 100,
the Indians had a seven-event
point lead of 36-27.
Oxy Sweep
But then came the high hurdles
and an as-expected sweep for Oc
cidental.
Following the highs was prob
bably the key race and turning
point of the meet the half-mile.
The Cards, to stay in contention,
had to get eight points here. But
they had to depend on Cunliffe
and Lundh to come back from the
mile against a fresh Jim Cerveny.
The Stan 112 or d pair started
strong, led for Ihe quarter in 55.5,
and continued in front in the back
stretch. But Cerveny hung on
easily, marie his move on the final
curve, and capitalized on his rela
tive freshness to gain and keep
the lead with 50 yards to go.
Cerveny clocked in at 1:51.2
excellent for this time of year.
Cunliffe was only four-tenths
back, and Lundh had a creditable
1:53.2 as he finished eased-up.
Dick Lassen, who ran third and
fourth all of the way, closed well
to hit 1:53.4.
DeYVeese Helps
Armand DeWeese's 1 GO- Idis
cus effort picked up five points
for the Cards and gave them the
45 - all point tie. A pole vault
S sweep, however, gave Occidental
a lead it never again relinquished.
Another hurdle sweep in the lows,
a first and second in the two-mile,
and a first and third in the 220
! quickly put the meet on ice.
Clarence Treat in winning the
I lows at 23.3 set the day's only
