# Indian Netters Take 2 of 3
## 
### 
After losing a tough season's
opening match to a veteran Olym
pic Club tennis team, Stanford's
net team rebounded to defeat two
college opponents in matches last
week.
The Olympic Club, which boasts
of such top veteran tennis play
ers as Bill Crosby, Tom Brown
and Harry Likas, nosed out the
Stanfordites on March 7, 5-4, with
the third doubles match and last
match of the day between Stan
ford's Gill Ranney and Dick Gould
and ihe "O" Club's George Goss
ler and Stan Smith being the de
cider.
Moving inlo college competition
the Stanfordites fared a little bet
ter, dumping Utah 8-1 and Red
lands 6-3 in dual matches.
Lowell Carruth, playing third
singles, was the standout per
former for Stanford in the three
match series. Carruth won all
three of his singles matches in
cluding a surprise victory over
highly ranked but lackadaisical
Tom Brown.
As well as impressing in sin
gles, Carruth had an unblemished
record in doubles as he and team
mate Jim Jeffries combined to
take all three of their second
doubles matches.
Stanford will play its next
match tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. on
the local courts against Portland
University.
