# "The biggest challenge a man has to face is himself"

"Men and businesses are alike in one respect," says
Gerald A. Parsons, 30-year-old marketing and per
sonnel development specialist. "Their success de
pends to a great extent on how well they respond to
challenge. And I've found that the biggest challenge
a man has to face on his job is not the competition of
others — but the far more important one of develop
ing himself to his fullest capabilities.
"During my four years with General Electric,
I've had plenty of opportunity for self-development.
Challenging training assignments at five different
locations within the company have given me a
broader understanding of my career area. In my
present job 1 have the benefit of working with ex
perts, both in establishing long-range goals and in
helping to achieve them. I've found that working
toward future potential is vital in the development
of snn <\ till businesses- and successful men."

Young men such as Gerry Parsons are important
to the future of companies like General Electric and
to the growth of America's dynamic, competitive
enterprise economy. Our nation's progress will de
pend more and more upon those forward-looking
individuals who continue to develop to their fullest
capabilities during their lifetime.
That is why General Electric provides a climate
for individual progress — with opportunity for in
creasing knowledge and skills — for all of its em
ployees, including 30,000 college graduates. For it
is only as individuals meet the challenge of self
development that there continues to be progress for
a business, an industry, or a nation.
