I lions are now holding up quite
I woll, the Corporation Yard re
ported yesterday. Seepage there,
especially on the west embank
ment, exceedingly great in for
i mer years, has been curtailed by
about 75 per cent.
The 18-inch drain tile around
Lagunita Court meant to collect
| wator from (he leaking embank
j men! is almost empty now. It
i used to be full whenever the lake
I began to fill.
The improvement is Ihe result
(if a strengthening of the founda
tions done by the Corporation
Yard during the summer and fall
of last year. They filled a 15 foot
wide, 15-foot deep trench around
i the north and west sides of the
llake with clay, making the em
| bankmenl impermeable.
Because Hie lake is still 1 feet
from being filled, there may lie
a little more seepage when there
is more rain, but on the whole the
foundations are holding well.
