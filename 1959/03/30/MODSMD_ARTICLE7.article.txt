# New Firstâ€” Chaparral On Reg Day
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
Spring is finally here, the Chap
pies are proudly announcing to
the campus. And their Spring Is
sue, on sale today <for the first
time in their history, a Reg Day),
wastes no time in making the ob
vious more so.
Comments of the Ancient One
and the decorations at the bottom
of some of the pages help create
the atmosphere of gay, spring
time frivolity.
The Party
Then there's the serious, or
semi-serious (depending on how
one takes it) side of the lampoons
one expects from the Chappie. As
if adequate coverage of the inci
dent by Peninsula, San Francisco
and other papers wasn't enough,
the little men from the shack
across the street have decided to
rehash the Los Altos party, in
the form ol "Stanfordbury Tales."
Stories, as tnld by the six char
acters a Knight, the Wife of
Bath, the Prioress, the Summon
er, the Clerk and the Pardoner -
adequately recall the sad tale of
Pi Phi's most recent party.
Many Rumors
Many versions of what hap
pened at the infamous party were
being spread via the wings of ru
mor soon after the party hap
pened. Perhaps the "Tales" are
just a summary of some of the
more prominent ones.
Anyway, said the Pardoner, "It
could only happen in a night
mare."
Two other prominent articles
bear mentioning a game called
Monogamy and a fable entitled
"Venda." Both are concerned, as
usual, with typical Chappie top
ics the fairer sex and money.
Draw your own conclusions.
'Tis rumored that the Chappie
will be on sale in front of the Pa
vilion today, so while paying mon
ey to the University, and if in a
generous mood, donate 35 cents
to the fund for mentally deficient
Chappies you'll even get a maga
zine in return.
