# Russia Agrees To Meet With West
## 
### 
MOSCOW (/P)—The Soviet Un
ion Monday formally agreed to
meet the West at a Big Four for
eign ministers' conference on
Germany and Berlin. But the So
viets reserved the right to bring
up the original demand that Com
munist Poland and Czechoslova
kia sit in on the talks, to be held
in Geneva.
The Kremlin's reply to the
West's proposal of March 26 came
as no surprise. Geneva was the
place and May 11 the time sug
gested by the West. Soviet Pre
mier Nikita Khrushchev had al
ready accepted the idea of such
a meeting at a Kremlin news con
ference March 19.

As usual, Khrushchev saw a
foreign ministers' meeting only as
a step toward a summit confer
ence. There was general agree
ment in Moscow that such a meet
ing would follow the ministers'
conference, probably in Geneva a
month or so later.
Three separate notes were

handed to the American, French
and British ambassadors by So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei Gro
myko at half-hour intervals.
U.S. Declines Comment
The State Department in Wash
ington declined immediate com
ment on the latest Moscow note
until it sees the text.
Each note carried a slightly
different emphasis, but all looked
beyond the foreign ministers'
meeting to the summit an idea
accepted with varying of
warmth 'oy President Eisenhower,
British Prime Minister Harold
Macmillan and French President
Charles de Gaulle.

ment would send its foreign min
ister to the meeting opening May
11 to discuss Germany, including
a peace treaty and the future
status of Berlin.
Door Left Open
This matched the language of
the U.S. note of March 26, which
also left the door open for discus
sion of any question the conferees
believe relevant to the subject.
The Kremlin agreed to the
Western suggestion that both
West Germany and Communist
East. Germany send observers to

fice through a heavy spring snow,
Moscow radio and t ho Soviet news
agency Tass began broadcasting
the contents of the notes.
Tass said the .Soviet govern
ment would send its foreign min

the U.S. note of March 26, which
also left the door open for discus
sion of any question the conferees
believe relevant to the subject.
The Kremlin agreed to the
Western suggestion that both
West Germany and Communist
East. Germany send observers to
the meeting.
MOSCOW (/P)—The Soviet Un
ion Monday formally agreed to
meet the West at a Big Four for
eign ministers' conference on
Germany and Berlin. But the So
viets reserved the right to bring
up the original demand that Com
munist Poland and Czechoslova
kia sit in on the talks, to be held
in Geneva.
The Kremlin's reply to the
West's proposal of March 26 came
as no surprise. Geneva was the
place and May 11 the time sug
gested by the West. Soviet Pre
mier Nikita Khrushchev had al
ready accepted the idea of such
a meeting at a Kremlin news con
ference March 19.

As usual, Khrushchev saw a
foreign ministers' meeting only as
a step toward a summit confer
ence. There was general agree
ment in Moscow that such a meet
ing would follow the ministers'
conference, probably in Geneva a
month or so later.
Three separate notes were

handed to the American, French
and British ambassadors by So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei Gro
myko at half-hour intervals.
