NEW DELHI, India (/P> —Prime
Minister Nehru declared India's
sympathy for Tibetan rebels Mon
day. lie spurned Red China's at
tempt to smothor Indian parlia
mentary discussion o£ the rebel
lion.

India promise to admit all Tibetan
refugees, as Austria did in the
1956 Hungarian revolt.
Different Situation
"There arc many vast differ
ences in this situation," Nehru

the Austrian example. "Obviously
I cannot say that if large crowds
come we will automatically admit
them all. I tell you we would not
admit them. No country could or
should say it will admit every
body that comcs."
Nehru faced a barrage of ques
tions as Parliament met for the
first time since the Red Chinese

volt in Lhasa, capital of the iso
lated mountain land, had thrown
out the government of the Bud
dhist god-king, the Dalai Lama,
and had elevated in his place his
rival, the Panchen Lama.

spread feeling in India because of
long-nurtured trade and religious
links with the Tibetans.
For the first time since 1951,
Indian demonstrators marched on
the Chinese Communist Embassy
at New Delhi, shouting "Chinese
bandits quit Tibet."
Thousands of Buddhists in La
dakh, a province of Kashmir,
adopted a resolution asking India
