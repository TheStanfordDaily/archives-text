# Three Ways of Living Available to Freshmen
## Independent Living Is Strengthened By Possibilities of House System 
### Craig W. Allen President, Burbank House 
For many past groups of fresh
men who have been faced with
the decision of whether to pledge
a fraternity or an eating club or
to remain independent, the rea
sons for selecting the latter alter
native have usually been of a neg
ative nature, the main one being
complete independence from any
obligation to a group.
There have been other reasons
offered, such as greater possibili
ties for academic achievement and
a wider diversity of types of social
contacts and experiences than is
available in the clubs or fraterni
ties.
Although these reasons often
contain an element of truth, they
are, in many cases, only rationali
zations for failure to receive a bid,
because they are so intangible and
vary so much in relevance from
individual to individual that they
can only be judged and evaluated
in the light of experience in the
various types of living groups.
Recently, however, the Admin
istration has taken various steps
to improve the independent men's
living facilities, and these actions
constitute a new, positive factor
w hi c h should be considered by
freshmen when making their
choice of a living group. These
actions of the Administration are
centered around the formation of
a "house system" in Stern.
The aims of the house system
are to provide the possibilities for
a more meaningful existence for
the independent man in terms of
the ultimate goals of his educa
tion. Steps in this direction which
have already been taken include
the establishment of house libra
ries in Muir and Burbank and for
mation of a group of faculty asso
ciates who eat frequently in the
dining halls and provide the op
portunity for informal contact be
tween faculty and students.
There are many other parts of
the system which are to go into
effect in the future, but the im
portant things for freshmen to
consider are that that there is a
change going on in Stern, that the
Administration is backing this
change with financial as well as
moral support, and that, in order
to make the system work, student
effort will be required.

Providing this student effort is
the responsibility of those who
feel that the house system will
benefit the Stanford undergradu
ate housing program and who
want to have a part in providing
what may bo the basis for a sys
tem which will allow students to
get the fullest benefits, intellectu
ally AND socially, from their col
lege ca leers.
But even with the many possi
bilities for constructive activity in
instituting the house system, the

real advantage of living in Stern
is that one doesn't have to take
advantage of these advantages,
lie can participate in whatever tie
chooses, to the extent that he
chooses, utilizing his time in the
way he sees fit.
The possibilities for participa
tion exist, and if a person chooses
to participate, the experience he
gets will be much more valuable
lor him, because what he has done
was done because he wanted to
not because he was told to.


Off-campus living is an option available to most
freshman men whether they pledge a fraternity,
eating club, or remain independent. Here, Parks

living.
