# Eating Clubs Emphasize Dignity of the Individual
## 
### John Nickerson Tovon-ICC Representative to Legislature 
One can scarcely hope to indi
cate the kind of alternative which
the Stanford eating clubs offer to
freshmen without first indicating
the ideals for which the clubs
stand. And for many years the
clubs have flourished on two cen
tral precepts: the importance of
individual choice and the dignity
of the individual person.
What of the importance of indi
vidual choice? The clubs believe
that the undergraduate is socially
and academically mature enough
to realize his own aims without
having them imposed upon him
by his associates. For this rea
son, the clubs have no required
study tables, and members are
not compelled to attend club par
ties.
Clubs make no effort to specify
where and how a man ought to
live, and club members are free
to take up residence off campus,
to move into Toyon llall or even,
if they so wish, to pitch a tent on
the Stanford golf course. In short,
the club man decides for himself.
What, then, is meant by the dig
nity of the individual person, it
is just this: that the singular
member of an eating club shall be
respected in and for himself, and
not simply by the way in which
he responds to the group.
With this ideal in inind, the
clubs have refused to engage in
initiation of a destructive or nega
tive sort. In the same way, they

havp consistently declined lo con
sure a member of 1 lie group for
his refusal to participate in any
part of the club program.
Despite the emphasis on indi
vidual choice, however, club men
recognize that any social group,
in order to be both active and
vital, must instill ;t consciousness
of mutual responsibility within
its members. In the club system,
this feeling of group loyalty
comes from active, voluntary par
ticipation in the club program and
a sharing of common interests
with other members of one's par
ticular club.
If this is some indication of
what the freshman should look
for in the club system, what,
then, are club men looking for in
the freshman? Since the system
demands maturity, intelligence
and social responsiveness, these
traits will naturally be sought.
But the rushing procedure of
the clubs differs from all others
in evaluating a man on the basis
of his individual excellence. Sel
dom heard around the Little Quad
is the question "Will he lit in?"
More often asked is the question,
"How good a man is he?" The
clubs, then, are looking for the
best individuals they can find.
In closing, the clubs suggest
that in the week to come the
freshman take advantage of Hie
opportunity to investigate all the
alternatives open to him, and then
return for a reappraisal of the
club system before making a de
cision which will be of major irn
portance to him throughout thp
remainder of his college days.
