# Fraternity Life Valuable Part of College Career
## 
### Dennis Farrar Past President, Phi Delta Theta 
In the course of the next several
days you, members of the class of
1902, will he exposed to that grand
old college institution known as
"fraternity life." To most of you.
rushing will be a very interesting
and somewhat perplexing experi
ence. It will be a time of open
houses and parties, of meeting
new people and making new
friends but when all this is over,
it will be a time of decision.
You must decide whether' or not
you choose to pledge a fraternity,
and then you must decide which
one you prefer. Your decision will
be one of serious deliberation, for
it will determine not merely
where you will eat and sleep for
the next three years, but whether
you will commence upon one way
of life as opposed to another.
With this in mind, 1 would like
to tell you why 1 think being a
member of a fraternity is an in
dispensable part of a successful
and satisfying college career-.
Despite the recent unpleasant
ness at Los Altos, fraternities at
Stanford are not mystic clubs
whose* activities are confined to
throwing wild parties, hazing
pledges and indulging in occasion
al parity raids. Stanford fraterni
ties are dedicated to the principle
that every member shall leave
the house a better man than when
tie entered. 11 fraternities did not
accomplish this objective, there
would be little reason for their ex
istence.
There are several features in
herent in our fraternity system
which make fraternity life a val
uable addition to a well-rounded
education. In the first place, one's
college days are often his only op
portunity to enjoy the advantages
of small group living.
In this world it is necessary
thai we acquire certain skills
which will enable us 1o get along
with other people. There is no

better proving ground on which
to exercise a person's social tal
ents than a fraternity house in
which 40 or 50 individuals of vary
ing personalities, interests and
backgrounds are placed under
single roof. The give anr! take and
compromise of fraternity living
are a real education in human re
lations.
It has always been Ihe inten
tion of Stanford fraternities 1o
provide their members with the
sense of belonging and unity
which comes from working to
gether with a common purpose,
without sacrificing their individ
uality in the process. The Stan
ford houses encourage the full
expression of each member's indi
vidual tastes and interests.
Believing that one of the func
tions of a fraternity is to provide
its members with a lot of good
times, the houses at Stanford
have full and well-rounded social
calendars. That ihey are becom
ing increasingly aware of their
role in providing a conducive in
tcllectual atmosphere is evidenced
by the fact that II of their num
ber ranked above the all men's
average fall quarter.
In conclusion, you must keep in
mind that while one or a few of
Stanford's fraternities may not
be better or worse than ihe oth
ers, they are all different. Each
has a distinct personality all its
own. While certain fraternities
appeal to certain individuals,
there will be at least one frater
nily which will appeal to you.
During rushing, it will be your
job to find that fraternity, and i'i
you do, both yourself and your
fraternity will be a little better
upon your graduation day.

accomplish this objective, there
would be little reason for their ex
istence.
There are several features in
herent in our fraternity system
which make fraternity life a val
uable addition to a well-rounded
education. In the first place, one's
college days are often his only op
portunity to enjoy the advantages
of small group living.
In this world it is necessary
thai we acquire certain skills
which will enable us 1o get along
with other people. There is no

better proving ground on which
to exercise a person's social tal
ents than a fraternity house in
which 40 or 50 individuals of vary
ing personalities, interests and
backgrounds are placed under
single roof. The give anr! take and
compromise of fraternity living
are a real education in human re
lations.
It has always been Ihe inten
tion of Stanford fraternities 1o
provide their members with the
sense of belonging and unity
which comes from working to
gether with a common purpose,
without sacrificing their individ
uality in the process. The Stan
ford houses encourage the full
expression of each member's indi
vidual tastes and interests.
Believing that one of the func
tions of a fraternity is to provide
its members with a lot of good
times, the houses at Stanford
have full and well-rounded social
calendars. That ihey are becom
ing increasingly aware of their
role in providing a conducive in
tcllectual atmosphere is evidenced
by the fact that II of their num
ber ranked above the all men's
average fall quarter.
In conclusion, you must keep in
mind that while one or a few of
Stanford's fraternities may not
be better or worse than ihe oth
ers, they are all different. Each
has a distinct personality all its
own. While certain fraternities
appeal to certain individuals,
there will be at least one frater
nily which will appeal to you.
During rushing, it will be your
job to find that fraternity, and i'i
you do, both yourself and your
fraternity will be a little better
upon your graduation day.
In the course of the next several
days you, members of the class of
1902, will he exposed to that grand
old college institution known as
"fraternity life." To most of you.
rushing will be a very interesting
and somewhat perplexing experi
ence. It will be a time of open
houses and parties, of meeting
new people and making new
friends but when all this is over,
it will be a time of decision.
You must decide whether' or not
you choose to pledge a fraternity,
and then you must decide which
one you prefer. Your decision will
be one of serious deliberation, for
it will determine not merely
where you will eat and sleep for
the next three years, but whether
you will commence upon one way
of life as opposed to another.
With this in mind, 1 would like
to tell you why 1 think being a
member of a fraternity is an in
dispensable part of a successful
and satisfying college career-.
Despite the recent unpleasant
ness at Los Altos, fraternities at
Stanford are not mystic clubs
whose* activities are confined to
throwing wild parties, hazing
pledges and indulging in occasion
al parity raids. Stanford fraterni
ties are dedicated to the principle
that every member shall leave
the house a better man than when
tie entered. 11 fraternities did not
accomplish this objective, there
would be little reason for their ex
istence.
