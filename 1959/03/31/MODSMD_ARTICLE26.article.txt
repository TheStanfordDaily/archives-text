talks during that time.)
Those Who Know Praise College Ball.
Time and lime again you read in (he papers about aspiring base
hall players being signed right out of high school. This leads many
people to wrongly feel thai college baseball is not a good preparation
for major league ball. According to managers and players who have
come out of college and who are in a better position to know, college
baseball is indeed an excellent prep for the big step into the majors.
Manager Bill Riffiiey of the San Francisco (.iants will tell you
that those fellows who have gone to college before signing are easier
to work with because they understand better. "Rig'" said he is defi
nitely against signing players right out of high school, but that some
times youngsters show no desire to go to college.
"Riff" said it is his belief that three years of college ball are worth
about one or maybe two years of minor league ball, the difference
heing the coaching. Of course the area where the ball is being played
is also an important factor. This is the one main advantage of college
ball on the West Coast, says Riffiiey the good weather making for
a longer season.
Hiffffins, manager oi the Boston Red Sox, says that unless
a high school player receives a very large bonus, he should go to col
lege. lie feels thai it is more up to the individual as to whether or
not he should play college ball. Mike says'that a good player coming
Irom college will usually start higher in the system than most high
school players.
Moth Riffiiey and Hiffffins feel that it is not good lo sign a college
player aftei two or three years of college, but if the individual is not
happy with college then ii would be perfectly right to sign him, for
he will just sign with someone else if he doesn't care about college.
With the exception ol I'rincctoii graduate Dave Sisler, now with
the Red Sox, all of the college graduates that I talked with were
very happy that they finished college rather than signing out of high
school.
(lollege Ball Mean I Plenty lo Lepeio
Twl Lepeio, who graduated from Seton Hall in 19:11, said he
thought his college ball was worth at least two or three years in the
minors. Ted is now in his eighth year with the Rod Sox, and at 29
is eligible for the pension now given major league veterans.
Thus, when lie retires, his college education will enable him to
pet a good job in the business world. And his earnings there will he
supplemented by the pension he will receive when he turns 50.
Ted feels it was his college ball that helped him start light out
in a triple A league and after two seasons move up to the Red Sox.
Lepeio firmly said that he would advise a ball player to stay in col
lege unless he gets offered the big bonus, usually considered to be
at least $40,000. It would be too much of a gamble for a player to
refuse this and take the chance of getting hurt and losing the chance
of that much money. Whereas if he is only offered say $10,0(10, then
the aspiring baseballer can afford to take the gamble.
Bill Retina, who attended Menlo College and graduated from Sarita
Clara, said his college ball helped him greatly. R<enna said that the
coaching he got made all the difference. The burly outfielder from
San Jose is now in his second season with the Red Sox and is show
ing the strong bat.
Dave Sisler, son of Baseball's Hall of Famer George Sisler, said
that he .did not think that college baseball, at least as it was played
in the East, was too good a preparation for major league ball, because
of the short schedule and the sometimes-mediocre quality of some
of the players. Sisler, a pitcher, said that in college you would usu
ally find only two or three good hitters to face on any team. He also
said that the season was too short to really get too much work.
Then Add Some Summer Ball
The addition to college ball which, in the opinion of many, helps
in preparing a player for immediate entry into the high minors or
even the majors is summer "industrial" baseball.
Such summer arrangements provide a ballplayer with a good
.paying summer job and give him a spot on a ball club that plays
three or four games a week. With plenty of good college players
taking advantage of such opportunities, the caliber of competition
is good. And. of course, if extends the otherwise-short college season
throughout the summer and combines to a 67-70-80-game season.
Though men like Riffiiey are highly in favor of these summer
leagues, the NCAA has become disturbed over them recently because
of reports of cases where players never actually work on the jobâ€”
they draw the pay, but spend the time playing ball. Comments of
some of the players who have held such jobs "seem to support the
charge that the pay is for ball-playing and not work.
Regardless of whether the work is done, however, there is no
denying that summer ball combined with a good collegiate program
lor three or four years can cut as many as two or three years off the
minor league preparation that will be needed by a player of major
league potential.
