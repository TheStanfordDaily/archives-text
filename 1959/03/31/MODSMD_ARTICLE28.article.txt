# Frosh Tackle Paly, Carlmont
## 
### 
Wasting no time got ting back
into action after the spring lay
off, Stanford's freshman track
team will take on Palo Alto High
and Carlmont High in a triangu
lar meet at 4 p.m. tomorrow in
Stanford Stadium.
The frosh had a meet March 20
before taking the quarter- break,
a triangular affair with Menlo JC
and Hartnell JC.
Palo Alto High's biggest claim
to track and field fame is in the
distance events. Here they are
almost unbeatable. To have on a
squad one or two men who can
run a mile in under four and a
half minutes is something for a
coach to boast about. Paly has no
less than four such distance
speedsters: Mike Chilton, George
Linn, Mike Lehner and Rick
Brady.
These four runners currently
hold the international high school
four-mile relay record.
Leading the Carlmont team into
the meet will be shot-putter Chris
Jensen and sprinter Bob Stevens.
In the meet with Menlo and
Hartnell the frosh took 11 firsts
out of the in events as they won
easily with a score of DO 1 -* to
Meiilo's 35 V-i and I lart nell's 32.
Stanford had three entries who
won two events. Larry Fischer
took the 100 and the 220 with
times of KJ.I and 22.4 respective
ly. Dan Moore took both hurdle
events with a time of 10.0 in the
120-yard highs and 24.8 in the
220-yard lows. Don Bell took the
discus with a 150-10 heave and
the shot put will) a toss of 44-2 Mi.
