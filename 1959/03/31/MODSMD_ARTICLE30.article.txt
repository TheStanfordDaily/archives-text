# Doctors Check Williams' Ills
## 
### 
BOSTON (/P) Ted Williams, a
Strained expression on his face,
entered New England Baptist
Hospital Monday for treatment of
what he called "a kink in my
neck."
The nonpareil Boston slugger
vowed, however, he'd open the
season patrolling left field for the
Red Sox.
There was no encouragement
from doctors.
Neither did the medicos say im
mediately that the 40-year-old bat
ting artist wouldn't be on hand
when the American League opens
its 59th season.
A medical bulletin said Wil
liams \\ipuld begin traction treat
ments to relieve the pain and that
orthopedic consultations would be
planned in a day or two.
Williams obviously was a dis
appointed man when he arrived
at Ihe hospital for the X-rays
which were the basis for the deci
sion that he be admitted as a pa
tient.
"I was just getting into shape,
too," he lamented.
