## Cards Split First Meets 
### 
Stanford will go into Saturday's
dual track and field meet with
UCLA carrying a 1-2 season rec
ord. In two meets before last Sat
urday's Occidental loss, the Cards
first lost to San Jose State, then
beat the Olympic Club and Santa
Clara Youth Village.
John Kelly turned in what was
probably the most impressive
mark of the two meets for Stan
ford when he broad-jumped 24-5
against the Spartans. He also
1 fouled on a leap of 24-B'•>.
Bertil Lundh staged a good (lis- j
; tance double against the two clubs
as be won the mile in 4:11.7 and
| the BHO in 1:52.4. Actually, fresh
! man Evangelos Depastas was top
man in the mile with a 4:11 (loc k
ing, but he is on the ineligible list. \
Dave Merchant continued his
'improving winter showings with
a 13-o'--j vault against the Spar- 1
tans, although he couldn't come
close lo matching that in the Oxy i
i meet. Dean Smith registered a 9.0 I
!in the San Jose b;illle and got
just a fourth place for his trou
i bles.
Don Chesarek, showing the
great form he had early in his
sophomore year, whipped off a
| 48.3 quarter in the club meet. He
I did the same against Oxy.
Indian opponents in both meets
turned in plenty of top perform
ances. The best was a new Stan
lord Stadium record in the shot
put hung up by Bill Neider, ex-
Kansan now with the Winged O.
I It 1 shoved the 10-pound hall 01-9,
besting Parry O'Brien's old mark
of 58-2 V-z.
Ray Norton ran a wind-aided 9.3
and returned with a legitimate
20.2 in the 220. His teammate Bob ,
Poynter had a 9.4 and 20.2.
