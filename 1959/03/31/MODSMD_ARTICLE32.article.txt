# Portland Netters To Test Indians
## 
### 
Portland University, led by
Chile's number two tennis player,
Omar Pabst, will invade the Stan
ford courts today to take on Stan
ford's netters in a dual match.
Pabst, a member of the Chilean
' Davis Cup team, will meet Stan
! ford's Dave Nelson in what should
| be the feature match of the day.
Along with Pabst, Portland also
has a scrappy competitor in Lou
Serville. Serville, playing second
man last year for Portland, de
feated Stanford's Brooks Rawlins
in a tough three-setter. This year
Serville will oppose Stanford
sophomore Dick Ogden.
Lack of Depth
Outside of Serville and Pabst,
Portland hasn't got much depth
J in its lineup and for this reason
I Stanford shouldn't he too seri
ously pressed in the match.
The Stanford lineup for today's
match will include besides Nelson
and Ogden, Lowell Carruth at
third singles and .lirn Jeffries at
fourth singles. The fifth and
I sixth spots are still questionable!
1 and should be filled from among
i five player s, Brooks Rawlins,
I Norm Karns, 1 >iÂ«*k Gould, Gil
Ranney or Dick Mosk.
New Additions
if Rawlins and Karris see action
it will be the Inst time this year j
either* has played for Stanford.
Rawlins, nu rn tic r three man
j throughout most of last year, will
be a tremendous addition to tin* |
Stanford squad il he is healthy:
and ready to play top notch ten
nis.
Karns could fill a weak spot in
the Stanford doubles picture, and
this could make a big difference
in Stanford's PCC title hopes.

As far as- doubles for today's
match are concerned it's almost
certain that Stanford's top com
bos of Nelson and Ogden and Jef
fries and Carruth will play one
and two. The third team prob
ably will include Gil Ranney and
Dick Gould .but it is possible that
Stanfo r d C o a c h Bob Renker
might choose to experiment with
Rawlins and Karns if the Indians
have a substantial lead.
The entire Stanford squad spent
last weekend in the Bay Counties
Tennis Tournament at the Olym
pic Club, a tourney which finishes
this weekend. All were eliminated
by the end of the quarterfinal
round except Dick Ogden who
pulled the tourney's big upset by
knocking off second-seeded and
highly touted Cliff Mayne.
