# Junior Tops Researchers With Tiny Tape Recorder
## 
### 
Keith Johnson, Stanford junior, has successfully built a tape re
corder that commercial electronics companies were not able to dc
velop in spite of many years of research.
Johnson, 22, created a miniature tape recorder the size of a kitchen
match box. 11 is powered by a nine-volt battery, records from four

heads simultaneously, and com
pares in performance with com
mercial tape recorders the size

of a suitcase that require plug
ging into an electric outlet and
record from only two heads.
Several features of the tiny re
corder are not yet commercially
available. One is a special tape
rewinding system providing a
half-hour's recording. Others are
a switching system to change
from recording to playback mere
ly by changing the setting of a

plug and a new use for a self
synchronizing motor to convert
power for the machine.
The tiny recorder, now on dis
play at the Chicago Museum of
Modern Industry, has won a cer
tificate of excellence for Johnson
from the National Miniaturiza
tion Association. It was present
ed to him at a banquet March 22
in New York's Waldorf - Astoria
Hotel.
The magnitude of his achieve
ment can be measured by the fact
that another certificate goes to
the entire research and develop
ment department of Martin Air
craft for a miniature atomic gen
erator.
Johnson built a three-channel
recorder for Dinkelspiel Audito
rium. It is used regularly to re
cord the performances of the Uni
versity's s y m p ho ny orchestra,
chorus and other musical groups.
