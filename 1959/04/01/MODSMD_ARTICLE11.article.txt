# Salk Visits Med School; Lauds Staff, Programs
## 
### 
Dr. Jonas Salk, discoverer of the Salk vaccine against poliomyelitis,
arrived at Stanford Monday to inspect tho >.ew $21 million Medical
School and to confer with a number of Stanford researchers. He
will leave for Pennsylvania tomorrow morning.
i Salk's visit is informal since, as he put it,"I just slopped by on

my way home from Southern Cal
ifornia to see just what is happen
ing at Stanford. There are many
interesting new things."
The new facilities at the Medi
cal School particularly interested
Salk since the University of Pitts
burgh, where he is Common
wealth Professor of Experimental
Medicine, is undertaking a largo
scale building program to provide
new teaching and research facili
ties.
Stanford "Impressive"
"Stanford's new physical plant
is quite impressive," he noted.
"They are the most pleasant I've
seen yet. It will almost be a
pleasure to be sick."
On the subject of the revamp
ing of Stanford's medical curricu
lum, Salk said, "This is a very
: healthy change. The pruning
i away of excess courses is abso
lutely essential to modern-day
medical schools. We must discard
I what was once essential and re
place it with new material."
Hp also commented favorably
on the co-operation between the
Medical School and the humani
ties: "This is a sound step in the
direction of better understanding
of each other's, problems."
I'raise for Staff
Salk had nothing but praise for
Stanford's scientific staffs and
programs: "The emphasis on men
of quality is very satisfying and
gratifying. The University is to
be complimented on the number
of outstanding people which they
have born able to attract. Build
ings are important, but the hu
man element is the primary fac
tor in education."
His famous case was Iho result
of years of experimentation but,
as is usually the case, he holds no
patents, no ownership rights, and
will never receive any royalties
from the discovery.
