# LASSU Takes a Stand: Loyalty. Oaths Next?

AT THE LAST MEETING of Legislature a resolution was passed urging
that cinch notices be sent to parents only on the recommendation
of a dormitory director or a resident assistant. The resolution also
"strongly" urged professors to send cinch notices to students re*
ceiving D's or F's in courses.
We commend Legislature for concerning itself with
something more than a myriad of bylaw changes.
While this recommendation differed from The Daily's position
on this matter, the fact remains that Legislature has recognized the
problem that exists in this area—namely, that all professors don't
send cinch notices, hence the notice is meaningless in that it doesn't
fully report a student's deficiencies.
We hope that by mid-quarter the Administration will have
corrected the deficiencies in the cinch notice system —either by
abolishing them as The Daily has asked, or by reporting all D
and F grades to the students as Legislature has recommended.
This recommendation, hopefully, could be the first of
many to come from Legislature. Problems that affect stu
dents, and their resolution, should be as much a part of
the sphere in which Legislature functions as are the in
tricacies of the Fremont House constitution and the ap- v
proval of the minutes of Rally Com meeting.
Tomorrow night Legislature will have before it a proposal to
make a recommendation to the Administration with regard to
loyalty oaths as they relate to federal student loan funds and
federal grants. This is a fine opportunity for LASSU to take strong,
positive action against such compulsory oaths —oaths that do noth
ing more than express an unfounded doubt in the loyalty of Ameri
can students. We hope it won't shrug the problem off with a "we
don't know enough about it."
