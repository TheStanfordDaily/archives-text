# Bike Lights Needed
## 
### 
STANFORD POLICE keep fairly busy ticketing careless campus car
drivers and illegal parkers. But they might also do the campus
a big service, and at the same time help its safety record, by
starting a drive against those bike riders who insist on riding
around at night with no lights or reflectors on their bikes.
The University has encouraged bike riding many times to help
alleviate the car traffic problem. But bikes only make the situ
ation worse —at least at night—if they can't be seen by pedestrians
and drivers. We're not for eliminating bikes—just for making
them safer.
