### 
WASHINGTON f/P)â€”The Unit
ed States cautioned the Soviet Un
ion Tuesday against interfering
with Allied flights to West Berlin.
It took this action as Western
foreign ministers met to draft
concrete proposals aimed at eas
ing international tensions over
Germany's future.
The foreign policy chiefs con
sidered a wide range of proposals
they hope to offer to the Soviets,
including a federation plan for
merging Western and Communist
Eastern Germany eventually into
a single democratic nation.
Disarmament Plans
The Allied pian would be linked
to step - by - step disarmament
measures aimed at meeting the
Soviet's contention that a united
Germany might attack its neigh
bors.
As the two-day conference got
under way, the State Department
strongly protested against the ac
tion of three Soviet fighters in
buzzing a U.S. Air Force supply
plane flying in thr air corridor to
West Berlin last Friday.
U.S.S.R. Protests
The Soviet fighters were re
ported to have maneuvered dan
gerously close to the American
plane, a turbojet Cl3O which was
flying at an altitude of nearly 25,-
000 feet.
The Soviets, in a protest lodged
in Berlin, contended the flight vi
olated an agreement not to fly
higher than 10,000 feet in the air
corridors.
The State Department rejected
the Soviet demand that future
flights be limited to a 10,000-foot
height.
