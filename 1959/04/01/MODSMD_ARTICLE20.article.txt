# Soviet Policy Equates Warsaw, Atlantic Pacts
## 
### J. M. ROBERTS Associated Press News Analyst 
The Soviet Union has been try
ing for a long time to get the
world, and especially the neutrals,
to equate the Warsaw Pact with
the North Atlantic Treaty and
East Germany with West Ger
many.
In a statement issued through
Tass, the official Kremlin news
agency, on the eve of acceptance
of plans for a Big Four foreign
ministers' meeting, this effort is
renewed. The suggestion for a
non-aggression pact between the
NATO and the Warsaw Pact
members is repeated.
There has been considerable un
happiness in the West through
the years because so much of its
foreign policy represents reaction
to Soviet pressures rather than
being positive on its own. Yet
this is only true by the nature of
the conflict, which is itself ini
tiated by the international Com
munists.
On the other hand, the Warsaw
Pact and the establishment of the
so-called People's Republic in the
East German occupation zone are
both direct reactions to Allied
policy.
The timing of the Tass state
ment makes it clear that the So
viets will still be trying at the
four-power conference to get the
West to recognize the East Euro
pean Soviet sphere as permanent,
along with Communist institu
tions in East Germany.
Indeed, this effort is one of the

reasons why the Soviet Union is
so anxious for the conference, and
for the summit meeting for which
the ministers are expected to pave
the way.
