# Tonight at the Symphony
## 
### Diana SmitH 
The grand Dame Myra Hess
comes tonight to the Opera House
and the San Francisco Symphony,
and to the restless mood and som
ber tones of Mozart's Concerto
for Piano and Orchestra in D
minor, K. 466.
Before the audience comes to
that, however, it will hear the
orchestra open (for Stanford stu
dents, spring quarter), with
Gluc-k's Overture to "Orfeo ed
Euridice." It is a proper spring
overture, for Gluck intended in
this opera in 1762 to open new
windows on the "concert in cos
tume" of Metastasio and the well
settled 18th century Italian tradi
tion. Gluck asked his orchestra
to participate in the drama of op
era, and turned from a collection
of spotlighted singers' songs to
focus upon the song of his whole
opera.
Not everyone was happy with
Gluck's turning.
Later, upon the leaving of the
presence and music of Dame
Myra, the orchestra will turn to
the Symphony of Anton von We
bern, student of Schonberg and
the 12-tone system.
And at the end is the Suite from
Kodaly's folk opera of 1926,
"Hary Janos." To Hungarians
Mr. Janos is a familiar figure of
Magyar bravado and conceit,
prime mover of a fabulous suc
cession of marvels. In this one,
Marie Louise, wife of the Em
peror of all the French, Napoleon,
returns the loving of the charmed
Hary Janos.
The Austrians and the French
are soon at war over it all, but
Janos is of course the single
handed accomplisher of Bona
parte's defeat, and equally logi
cally, he then returns to his boy
hood sweetheart at home.

Ivoclaly, who follows Bartok in
his belief in Hungary and her peo
ple, has woven Hungarian popu
lar music into the six movements
of the Suite. First, "The Tale
Begins," in which the orchestra
attempts a musical sneeze, for it
is said that a tale which produces
a sneeze must be a true one.
Properly authenticated, the tale
in the second movement gets on
with it: "The Viennese Musical
Clock," a timepiece in the impe
rial palace which figures in the
drama. "The Song," a viola la
ment of Janos' love of the boy
hood sweetheart (her name is
Orzse), is followed by great furor
in movement number four, "The
Battle and Defeat of Napoleon."
Things are resolved within the
circle of the Austrian ruler's grat
itude: "Entrance of the Emperor
and His Court."
