(By the Author of "Rally Round the Flag, Boys! "and,
"Barefoot Boy with Cheek")

You all know, of course, that every engineering senior is receiv
ing fabulous offers from dozens of corporations, but do you
know just how fabulous these offers are? Do you have any idea
how widely the corporations are competing? Let me cite for
you the true and typical case of Chatsworth Osceola, a true
and typical senior.
Chatsworth, walking across the M.I.T. campus one day last
week, was hailed by a man sitting in a yellow convertible
studded with precious gem stones. "Hello," said the man, "I am
Norwalk T. Sigafoos of the Sigafoos Bearing and Bushing Com
pany. Do you like this car?"
"Yeah, hey," said Chatsworth.
"It's yours," said Sigafoos.
"Thanks, hey," said Chatsworth.
"Do you like Philip Morris?" said Sigafoos.
"Of .corris," said Chatsworth.
"Here is a pack," said Sigafoos. "And a new pack will be
delivered to you at twelve-minute intervals every day as long,
as you shall live."
"Thanks, hey," said Chatsworth.
"Does your wife like Philip Morris?" said Sigafoos.
"She would," said Chatsworth, "but I'm not married."
"Do you want to be?" said Sigafoos.
"What American boy doesn't?" said Chatsworth.
Sigafoos pressed a button on the dashboard of his convertible
and the trunk opened up and out came a nubile maiden with
golden hair, flawless features, a perfect disposition, and the
appendix already removed. "This is Laurel Geduldig," said
Sigafoos. "Would you like to marry her?"

"Is her appendix out?" said Chatsworth.
"Yes," said Sigafoos.
"Okay, hey," said Chatsworth.
"Congratulations," said Sigafoos. "And for the happy bride,
a pack of Philip Morris every twelve minutes for the rest of
her life."
"Thanks, hey," said Laurel.
"Now then," said Sigafoos to Chatsworth, "let's get down
to business. My company will start you at $45,000 a year. You
will retire at full salary upon reaching the age of 26. When you
start work, we will give you a three-story house made of bullion,
complete with a French Provincial swimming pool. We will
provide sitter service for all your children until they are safely
through puberty. We will keep your teeth in good repair, and
also the teeth of your wife and children unto the third genera
tion. We will send your dentist a pack of Philip Morris every
twelve minutes as long as he shall live .. . Now, son, I want you
to think carefully about this offer. Meanwhile, here is ten
thousand dollars in small, unmarked bills, which places you
under 110 obligation whatsoever."
"It certainly seems like a fair offer," said Chatsworth. "But
there is something you should know. I am not an engineer. In
fact, I don't go to M.I.T. at all. I am a poetry major at Harvard.
I just came over here on a bird walk."
"Oh," said Sigafoos.
"I guess I don't get to keep the money and the convertible
and Laurel now, do I?" said Chatsworth.
"Of ,course you do," said Sigafoos. "And if you'd like the job,
my offer still stands." © 1959, Max sbuiman

Speaking of engineers, the Philip Morris company makes a
filter cigarette that's engineered to please the most discern
ing of filter smokers —Marlboro, the cigarette with better
"makin's." More flavor plus more filter equals more cigarette!
