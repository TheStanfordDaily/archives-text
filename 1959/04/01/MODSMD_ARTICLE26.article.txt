to give way to Paly's amazing
corps of distance men in the mile
and two-mile.

Chilton, second, recorded a time
of 1 :56.4, while Papoose Russ
Ray was third in 1:58.6.

George Linn and Mike Lehner
gave a brilliant demonstration of
the Paly power in the distances
as they ran to a dead heat in an
excellent time of 9:33.8. Stan
lord's John Northway, an ex-Vik
ing himself, was third in 9:45.8.

sophomore Cliff Brady outlasted
Papoose Kim Maxwell to win by
a hair in 4:30.5.

inches. Andy Lenz won the pole
