# Stanford Nixes Big Four And Joins National Seven
## 
### 
Stanford has joined a nation
wide athletic conference for com
petition in all major sports, it
was.announced today by the Uni
versity's Department of Athletics.
The historic move finds Stan
ford banding with Army, Navy,
Air Force, Notre Dame, Pitts
burgh and Penn State in a league
which will be known as the Na
tional Seven.
The fact that four of the
schools are in the East and a
fifth in the Midwest has present
ed scheduling difficulties which
will cause Stanford to inaugurate
a new program of education for
its athletes.
University 1 teams will be sent
to the East for up to four-week
periods, and will in lhat time hold
all scheduled "away" contests
with league foes. While in the
East, athletes will be quartered
at a soon-to-be purchased Stan
ford branch site.
Professors will be flown with
teams on all such trips, and will
instruct athletes in their regular
courses during the week at the
branch site. Patterned somewhat
after an already-established Uni
versity site in Germany, the new
branch will be known as "Stan
ford in Hoboken."
Assistant Athletic Director
Chuck Taylor, who made the
brief announcement, said no fur
ther details would be available
until next week. Other University
officials refused to comment until
the additional information was
released.

Taylor , however, said as he not
ed ihe date of today's initial an
nouncement, thai there might he
room in some quarters for douht
as to the truth ol' Ihe entire story.
