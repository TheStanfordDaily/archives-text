# Nats Draft Neumann
## 
### 
Stanford's "Mr. Everything" of
basketball, guard Paul Neumann,
was drafted by the Syracuse Na
tionals yesterday in the fourth
round of the National Basketball
Association player draft.
If Neumann can crack Ihe line
up of the Nats, currently battling
the Boston Celtics in a down-to
the-wire playoff battle for the
NBA's Eastern Division crown,
he would be one of two ex-Indians
in the fold. Pro great George
Yardley, another former Card,
has sparked the Nats' late-season
drive.
Big men, as usual, were the top
choices in the 81-player draft. Ex
Kansan Wilt (The Stilt) Cham
berlain went, as expected, to the
Philadelphia Warriors in the first
round. Six-eight Bob Boozer and
6-7 Bailey Howell of Mississippi
State went in the first round to
Cincinnati and Detroit, respec
tively. Kentucky's John Cox was
drafted on the fourth round by
New York.
Other PCC players: Bob Dal
ton, Cal, sixth round by Syracuse;
Walt Torrence,' UCLA, eighth
round by New York.
