# Netsters Smash Portland U., 6-1
## 
### 
Pulling nut two throe-set
matches, Dave Nelson and Dick
Ogden led Stanford's tennis team
to a G-l victory over an inter
nationally flavored team from
Portland University .
Nelson poured on the pressure
in the third set of his grueling
match with Chile's Omar Pabst
and won the first singles contest
7-.">, 2-6, 6-1.
While Nelson was turning back
Portland's lop man, Stanford's
second singles man Dick Ogden
came from two service breaks
down in the third set to top Port
land's Australian import Lou Sur
ville.
Ogden Stays Calm
Survillc, of the same Australian
age group that produced Lew
lload and Ken Kosewall, bothered
the Stanford sophomore with baf
fling top spin shots but Ogden
remained calm and finally won
out with some good net play.
The solid middle of the Stan
ford lineup, consisting of Lowell
Carruth and Jim Jeffries at third
and fourth singles respectively,
continued their winning ways by
taking straight set victories.
Carruth upped his undefeated
string in dual competition to four
by whipping Portland's Bob Kerr.

Jeffries had little trouble in
defeating a balding Tom Clark
in his match. Stanford's "Lud"
showed a good return of serve
and too much power for Clark.
Ituvvlins Shines
Shining bright in the Stanford
win was the successful return of
Brooks Rawlins. Rawlins, who
hadn't seen action this year be
fore yesterday, completely domi
nated his match with Danny Car
penter.
Stanford also got some good
action out of Norm Karris who
like Rawlins was playing for the
first time this year. Karris teamed
up with Dick Gould and although
they lost a tough three-setter both
played very well.
In the last match of Ihe day
Gil Ranney and Dick Mosk, Stan
ford's reserve doubles team,
showed good style as they ran
away with their match.
