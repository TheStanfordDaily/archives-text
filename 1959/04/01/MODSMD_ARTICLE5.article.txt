# FIRST DECADE
## Abba Eban Reviews Israel 
### 
Israeli Ambassador Al>!>a Khan
reviewed the first decade of the
growth of his country, in a speech
before students yesterday after
noon.
In 10 years, Eban said, I he Is
raelis have shown that the land
was not permanently desert and
desolate. Population tripled, from
650,000 to two million.
Nations of Asia and Africa,
though they admire ihe progress
of Russia and Red China, look to
Israel as an example of economic
dynamism combined with politi
cal freedom, both achieved in a
small and a young country.
While Israel is permanently
limited in the area and produe
tivit yof its land, and thus in po
litical importance, Eban believes
the country can still be a spiri
tual, cultural and scientific leader
of nations.
Mere survival is no longer a
problem in Israel, despite propa
ganda slogans of Arab nations
which question its right to exist,
Eban said. In its second decade
the country may find tensions de
creasing among nations of the
Middle East, with the co-opera
tion of separate nations rather
than union of basically different
countries.
Eban criticized Nasser's preoc
cupation with other nations of
the Middle East as a device to dis
tract attention from his only real
responsibilityâ€”Egypt. Syria, said
Eban, united with Egypt in the
same way as Jonah united with
the whale and appears to be as
indigestible as Jonah was.
