Stanford Medical School has
added tJS physicians to its "volun
tary" faculty and a dozen to its
full-time faculty in the past six
months, Dean Robert 11. Alway
reported recently.
The new appointments raise the
total of voluntary faculty to near
ly <>00, he said. These doctors,
who receive their income entirely
from private practice, give about
half a flay a week to teaching dur
ing six months of the year.
About one-third of the volun
tary appointees will come from
Santa Clara County, and another
third from San Mateo County.
This was to be expected, Dean
Alway said, since the Medical
School will move into its new cen
ter on the Palo Aito campus next
fall.
The full lime medical faculty
numbers about 100, Dean Alway
said. Full-time members devote
7."> per cent or more of their time
to teaching and research. They
generally have little or no private
medical practice.
