# Lagunita Court to Close; Temporary Housing Slated
## 
### 
Ground erosion, caused by water seepage from Lake Lagunita, has
seriously weakened the foundations under several casas of Lagunita
Court, army engineers from the Sixth Army, San Francisco, reported
yesterday. Santa Clara County building inspectors have ruled that
the buildings are unsafe for further occupancy and must be evacu-

ated within 10 days.
According to building inspector
William Rosenwalt of the Palo
Alto District Office, it will be nec
essary to repair or replace seg
ments of the foundations under
Olivo, Granada and Magnolia ca
sas and the dining hall, and minor
repairs must be made to the foun
dations under the other three
casas.
The Stanford Planning Office
estimated yesterday that the re
pairs would take several months
and cost "in the neighborhood of
$350,000."
Dates for moving the women
have not yet been arranged.
Emergency Housing
Emergency housing, w h i c h
must be provided for all Lagunita
women by April 11, has been ten
tatively outlined by the Housing
Office and Dean's Office as fol
lows :
• All Olivo women and 1A
women from Magnolia will take
up residence in the Phi Gamma
Delta house, vacated by the fra
ternity for the remainder of the
academic year.
• Thirty-eight Granada women
will move into the Zeta Psi house
as soon as the stairway to the
second floor is repaired.

• Adelpha and Eucalypto wom
en will move into the recently
completed east wing of Encina
Hall. Since repairs to their casas
are minor, according to the Cor
poration Yard, they may be able
to return to Lagunita in only a
few weeks.
• Eighteen women from Mag
nolia will fill vacancies in Union
Residence and seven other Mag
nolia women will move into va
cant rooms in Florence Moore
Hall.
Still Unsettled
Arrangements for 46 Naran.ja
women and 12 Granada women
have not been made yet, accord
ing to University officials, but
they will probably be accommo
dated by vacancies in other wom
en's residences and in faculty "and
staff homes.
All faculty and staff personnel
who can accommodate one or
more Lagunita women for a few
weeks to a quarter are requested
to contact the Housing Office, DA
3-1301.
Luggage Arrangements
Arrangements for moving lug
gage for the women have been
taken over by Alpha Phi Omega,
and the displaced Lagunita wom
en will be served by the Encina
dining hall temporarily.
The damage to the foundations
was noted by Corporation Yard
repairmen making minor repairs
Monday in the Lagunita kitchen.
The Corporation Yard reported
the damage to University offi
cials, who called in graduate civil
engineering students for consul
tation.
It was the students' findings
which will cause the closing of
the women's dorm also included
in the report were recommenda
tions for draining Lake Lagunita
and wishes for a happy April
Fool's Day.

sas and the dining hall, and minor
repairs must be made to the foun
dations under the other three
casas.
The Stanford Planning Office
estimated yesterday that the re
pairs would take several months
and cost "in the neighborhood of
$350,000."
Dates for moving the women
have not yet been arranged.
Emergency Housing
Emergency housing, w h i c h
must be provided for all Lagunita
women by April 11, has been ten
tatively outlined by the Housing
Office and Dean's Office as fol
lows :
• All Olivo women and 1A
women from Magnolia will take
up residence in the Phi Gamma
Delta house, vacated by the fra
ternity for the remainder of the
academic year.
• Thirty-eight Granada women
will move into the Zeta Psi house
as soon as the stairway to the
second floor is repaired.

• Adelpha and Eucalypto wom
en will move into the recently
completed east wing of Encina
Hall. Since repairs to their casas
are minor, according to the Cor
poration Yard, they may be able
to return to Lagunita in only a
few weeks.
• Eighteen women from Mag
nolia will fill vacancies in Union
Residence and seven other Mag
nolia women will move into va
cant rooms in Florence Moore
Hall.
Still Unsettled
Arrangements for 46 Naran.ja
women and 12 Granada women
have not been made yet, accord
ing to University officials, but
they will probably be accommo
dated by vacancies in other wom
en's residences and in faculty "and
staff homes.
All faculty and staff personnel
who can accommodate one or
more Lagunita women for a few
weeks to a quarter are requested
to contact the Housing Office, DA
3-1301.
Luggage Arrangements
Arrangements for moving lug
gage for the women have been
taken over by Alpha Phi Omega,
and the displaced Lagunita wom
en will be served by the Encina
dining hall temporarily.
The damage to the foundations
was noted by Corporation Yard
repairmen making minor repairs
Monday in the Lagunita kitchen.
The Corporation Yard reported
the damage to University offi
cials, who called in graduate civil
engineering students for consul
tation.
It was the students' findings
which will cause the closing of
the women's dorm also included
in the report were recommenda
tions for draining Lake Lagunita
and wishes for a happy April
Fool's Day.

Ruilding inspectors order dormitory closed until repairs completed
Ground erosion, caused by water seepage from Lake Lagunita, has
seriously weakened the foundations under several casas of Lagunita
Court, army engineers from the Sixth Army, San Francisco, reported
yesterday. Santa Clara County building inspectors have ruled that
the buildings are unsafe for further occupancy and must be evacu-

ated within 10 days.
According to building inspector
William Rosenwalt of the Palo
Alto District Office, it will be nec
essary to repair or replace seg
