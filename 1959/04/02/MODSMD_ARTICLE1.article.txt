# Hospital to Stay Self-supporting
## 
### 
The Trustees of Stanford University on March 1.1 gave the green
to plans for continued operation of San Francisco's Stanford
Hospital on a self-supporting basis.
The action came as the result of a recommendation made by the
Governing Board of the hospital supported by the medical staff,

which will remain in San Fran
cisco.
At its regular monthly meet
ing the Trustees approved a 19.19-
60 budget for operation and also
authorized the expenditure of
$120,000 to replace equipment
which will be moved to the new
medical school facility in Palo
Alto. Included in the budget is
authorization to continue the out
patient clinic through the next
year' at least.
100,000 Outpatients
The present outpatient clinic,
which provides medical care at
minimum expense for those who
cannot afford the full cost of pri
vate care, handles over 100,000
patients a year. "Its losses have
been a tremendous burden on the
University's educational funds,"
said Board President David Pack
ard.
Packard mentioned that vari
ous outside groups among them
the Presbyterians and the South
ern Baptists have shown consid
erable interest in the hospital, fie
indicated that the financial prob
lems might be solved or alleviated
by arrangements with one of
these groups at some future time.
Clinical
President Sterling said that tlie
hospital's medical staff will in
clude "clinical" members of the
Medical School faculty.
Clinical faculty earn their en
tire income in private medical
practice. They give about one
half day a week to teaching dur
ing six months of the year.
