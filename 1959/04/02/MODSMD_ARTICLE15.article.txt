a complex and significant one."
Complex Role
"It includes," she continued,
"introducing the freshman to the
variety of opportunities and ex

graduate years, being an upper
classwoman friend and thus a
link between the freshman class
and the rest of the University,
and providing a service to the
University for communication be
tween the administration and
freshmen."
A member of the committee,
with a present sponsor, will visit
each of the women's living areas

They will discuss some of the
opportunities and functions im

also answer questions and dis
