# USSR Warns US: Stop Berlin Flights
## 
### 
BERLIN (A y )—'The Soviet Union Wednesday warned the United
States to stop high-altitude flights to Berlin. The U.S. Air Force said
it will continue them as necessary.
Stepping up pressure elsewhere, the Soviet Union issued an
order in Moscow temporarily banning all travel by Western diplo-

mats outside the Soviet capital
and Leningrad—presumably be
•ause of spring military maneu
vers. Meeting this head-on,
Washington restricted travel of
Soviet diplomats to the Washing
ton New York area in the United
States.
Effective Immediately
Both bans were effective imme
diately. The State Department
saifl the U.S. ban will lie lifted
when the Soviets lift theirs, but
there was no immediate indica
tion how long they would last.
In the Balkans, the reported
transfer of 100 Bulgarian jet
planes from the Greek frontier
to bases near Romania find Yugo
slavia brought concern to Allied
military authorities in Athens. A
Greek military source speculated
that the move may be aimed at
intimidating Yugoslavia or be
part of a general plan connected
with the Berlin crisis.
Planes May Clash
The sharpening dispute over
the air corridor to Berlin raised
the danger of clashes between
American planes and Soviet MIG
fighters at a time when the West
ern foreign ministers are meeting
in Washington to lay the ground
work for spring meetings with
the Soviets.
Allied planes flying to isolated
West Berlin must use one of three
corridors in crossing Communist
East Germany.
Test ('ase
Responsible Allied informants
said the U.S. Air Force in West
Germany is awaiting a go-ahead
from Washington before dispatch
ing a turboprop Hercules trans
port that would provide a test
case.
The Soviets insist high-alitude
flights endanger Soviet planes
crossing the corridors.
When a Hercules made its first
roundtrip flight to West Berlin
Friday, cruising at over 20,000
feet, it was buzzed at wingtip by
Soviet fighters. The United States
promptly protested, and the So
viets countered with a protest
and warnings.
