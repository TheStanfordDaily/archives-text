Sponsor's Role

year to apply.
"The changing role of the spon
sor will be one of the things
stressed in the selection of next
year's sponsors," he commented.
"The shift toward sponsors who
arc more academically, intellec
tually and culturally oriented has
been occul ting over the past few
years as the demands of the fresh
men have changed," he added.
Martin went on, "Individuals
who are perceptive of and sensi
tive to the needs and problems of
others are needed to be successful
in the very demanding role of the
sponsor. This requires an indi

! with any person in a group as di
verse as a floor of 30 to 35 fresh
men."
Intense Interest

applicants, he said, "An intense
interest in working with fresh
men and freshman problems is a
prerequisite for success."

individual can make sponsoring a
learning experience in group
leadership and personal rela
tions."
