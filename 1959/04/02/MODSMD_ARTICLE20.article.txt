# Need Pointed Out By Sponsor Changes
## 
### 
Significant chances in the men's sponsor system have resulted
from a sincere and conscientious re-evaluation of tlie program l»y
the Men's Sponsor Oioosing Committee.
AI Martin, lieud sponsor, and the rest of I lie comniitlee are to
he commended for their fine work. Ihe changes they are insti
gating should provide future Stanford freshmen with a finer spon
sor system one that wilt meet the demands for greater intellectual
stimulation and guidance that are created by the ri.-ing standards
for entering freshmen.
The important point here is tlml these sponsors have
not hesitated to critically examine and re-evaluate a sys
tem of which they are a jmrt and to which they are at
tin lied hy all the common ties and loyalties that normally
develop between a person and a directed institution.
They have recognized the changes that are taking place in the
educational philosophy of the I diversity the slow but steady
movement toward an individualized kind of education, an educa
tion stressing quality and individual thought rather than quantity
and fact-cramming.
Having recognized these changes, I hey are attempting to bring
the sponsor system into this movement and to make it a contrib
uting factor toward iliii- new kind of education.
If other institutions on cam/his would folllow this ex
ample and re-evaluate their own program ami purposes
in terras of the University's education goals—if some pro
fessors would seriously reconsider the purposes of their
courses and the archaic methods of achieving them that
many still employ—indeed, if the individual student
would reconsider and rethink through the purpose for
which he is here in terms of meaningful education, then
perhaps this movement toward iniliviilualized education
would gain momentum.
If not, we'll have to move along slowly, chipping away at the
barriers that block our progress. Slowly the excessive testing and
strait-laced lectures will be removed, and perhaps we'll have the
kind of Stanford we d like when our children are ready for school.
Stanford men can contribute to this progress by working as
sponsors with freshmen, passing on to them a sincere enthusiasm
for learning. We hope the Sponsor Choosing Committee vvill have
many applicants from which to choose.
