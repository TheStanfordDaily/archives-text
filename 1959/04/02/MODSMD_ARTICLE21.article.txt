President Eisenhower has fre
quently warned of the harm that
would be done by allowing great
hopes to be built up for the suc
cess of a summit conference and
then seeing them crushed in fail
ure.
What the President is saying is
that if a summit isn't going to ac
complish anything, it will leave
things worse than before; if it
does nothing, it will have done
harm.
One way to avert this danger
is to refuse to go to the summit
unless the preliminary progress
of the foreign ministers justi
fies it. The Allies put a little
of this condition in their latest
note to Moscow, but the pres
sures for a summit meeting are
great and it is arguable that
Premier Khrushchev is the only
Soviet official who can make
top decisions and that it can
best be done in person.
The other way to avert a mas
sive let-down from a summit fail
ure is to make sure there is no
massive build-up.
Wishful Thinking
It is the consensus of those
whose duty it is to avoid wishful
thinking that the Soviet Union is
not ready to negotiate any settle
ment in Europe which would not
be to the overwhelming disadvan
tage of the West.
Obviously the Kremlin would be
delighted to be able to push us
out of West Berlin, keep Germany
from having modern weapons,
persuade us to dismantle NATO
and take U.S. forces out of west
ern Europe.
But Mr. Khrushchev knows he
can't get that all at once, so he is
proposing to take only the first
bite.
Why is it wise not to expect
much from a summit meeting?
Here is part of the evidence:

After Mr. Khrushchev proposed
to liberate West Berlin from the
West (like the Chinese are lib
erating Tibet from the Tibet
ans), we said no. He said. Well,
what do you propose? We pro
pose uniting the dismembered
Germany, after which Berlin
would be automatically a free
city.
Visitors Disillusioned
What did Premier Khrushchev
think of that?
He thought poorly of it, and the
two Germans to whom he reveal
ed his opposition most bluntly are
the two anti-Adenauer Germans
who have been most confident
that, if only they were in office,
they could negotiate something
real good with the Soviets.
They are Prof. Carlo Schmid,
deputy chairman of the Social
Democratic party (SPD), and
Frit/. Erler, deputy chairman of
its parliamentary section. They
traveled to East Berlin to see
Khrushchev and to show how Ad
enauer's "rigidity" was holding up
unification.
They'found out, all right. Dis
appointed and disillusioned, they
have reported candidly to their
colleagues in Bonn. What they
had to report was that Moscow
wasn't in the least interested in
German unification; that I here
was no concession which either
the West or West Germany
could make to bring it about —
except to accept the puppet gov
ernment in East Germany.
Majority Over Truth
As to elections leading to bases
for unification, Mr. Khrushchev
put it quite candidly:
"Since there are more than 50,-
000,000 West Germans (and only
17,000,000 East Germans), this
means that the majority, not
truth, would triumph."
What this all adds up to is that
Mr. Khrushchev wants to use a
summit conference to take Berlin
behind the Iron Curtain. At this
stage this doesn't make a summit
meeting look very productive.
