Don't Give Up llie Ship
One-quarter of the way through the 1959 track and field season,
Payton Jordan finds his Stanford Indians with still an excellent
chance to hang up national-class marks, records in any of several
categories, and perhaps even some team victories
Though somewhat smaller in number than either of Jordan's
teams during his first two years here, the 1959 squad appears to be
composed ol more determined athletes and fewer hangers-on or goof j
offs than either of the past two teams. While this is a good recom- j
mendation for the team members themselves, it's also a big mark in i
the credit column for Jordan (plus former frosh coach Floyd Strain
and present frosh coach Jim Ten-ill» and his work in breaking down
tlio lackadaisical and devil-may-care attitude that has surrounded
Stanford track and other sports for some time.
The 1959 team, while boasting several performers who are defi
nitely of national or world class, has been hurt badly in dual meets
by lack of balance. Failure to score in the hurdles, inconsistency in
the pole vault, less than-anticipated performances in the sprints, and
several injuries or illnesses have all proven costly in the point col
umn.
Keith Wallace, for example, has failed to come back to his fall
clockings in the two-mile. Shin splints, presumably from constant
pounding, have left him in less-than-perfect condition, hence his times
have shot up 2o or 30 seconds.
Norman l.loyd is another one who's had trouble. His training has
been retarded by several problems, and hence he hasn't been able yet
to round into shape for tough competition.
Loss of Jerry Winters via ineligibility hurt in Ihe shot-put for the |
first three meets. It's still touch-and-go whether he'll be able to com
pete this quarter, though an llth-hour ruling on a technicality may
make him eligible for I < I.A Saturday.
(>n the brighter side have been the performances of the middle
distance men and those of several assorted field eventers. Bertil
I.iiimIIi, the sophomore transfer from Norway, and Lrnie ('unlit'fe,
the dependable man in any meet, both look to be on the trail toward
numerous individual honors. With this pair on the 1320 and milt 1 legs
of a distance medley relay, Stanford could find itself within easy
shooting distance of a world best.
I>ick Lassen and Mon/.ingo, the second echelon in 1he 880 and
mile, haven't let the top two get very far ahead of them. Monzingo's
■1:1! 7 against Oxy was particularly good to see, and Lassen looks
nearly ready to crack into the 1:51's.
John Kelly, probably the most consistently good performer on 1he
team, is in his usual good form, lie's broad-jumped far enough to
win ;i!l three meets this year, and with his early season 215, should
be ready to improve on last spring's sixth place finish in the NCAA
ainl national AAU meets.

But while Jordan continues it) produce more and more outstand
ing individual performers, the Indians have still failed to reverse
what is becoming a fairly long string of losses to the other four
major dual meet powers of the West. Actually, this loss cycle should
n't make the Indians out to be as bad as ihe simple won-lost figures
might indicate.
Teams like SC and Oxy are often the best in the country, and
San Jose is even moving into that class. Were Stanford meeting
schools from other areas of the country instead of only the toughest
there arc, its won-lost record would be a far different story.
Still, the ( arils come closer all the time but each year, they're
killed by lack ol balance. Two years ago, there was a dearth of dis
tance runnel's; last year, the weightmen fell down; now, the hurdles
are the weakest point.
Iiut despite some of the gloomy sides of the picture, Jordan is
confident that come some meet in the not-so-distant future, his In
dians will put together enough come-through performances to regis
ter a nice fat upset. And when they do, the gate will open for more j
confidence to come in and more victories to come out.

An interesting bit of psychological warfare has been going on
recently in local publications, the central theme of it being a blast
at Stanford attitudes. The contention is that Stanford athletes don't
put out 100 per cent, and that most of the so-called fans don't really
give a hoot what happens.
Reaction to these charges has been sharply divided. One camp
has been highly disturbed, fearing that the athlete recruitment pro-1
gram will be hurt and that the University will get a "bad name." j
The other side says, "Well, (he criticism is for tin* most part true,
sti why try to hide it?" Significantly, there doesn't seem to be any
denying that attitude is indeed a big problem in Stanford athletics. I
I think anyone at all close to the athletic picture here can easily
sec that attitude and lack of a full effort is a problem. And I would
agree with those who see no point in trying to cover up or gloss over
a situation that is pretty evident to anyone interested.
I can see no reason for being hypocritical about the thing, play
ing ostrich toward it, or trying to keep the facts from other athletes !
who may want to come to Stanford. And then perhaps if the facts j
get out in the open, there will be an improvement in a not-too-nice
situation.

at Stanford attitudes. The contention is that Stanford athletes don't
put out 100 per cent, and that most of the so-called fans don't really
give a hoot what happens.
Reaction to these charges has been sharply divided. One camp
has been highly disturbed, fearing that the athlete recruitment pro-1
gram will be hurt and that the University will get a "bad name." j

sti why try to hide it?" Significantly, there doesn't seem to be any

I think anyone at all close to the athletic picture here can easily
sec that attitude and lack of a full effort is a problem. And I would
agree with those who see no point in trying to cover up or gloss over
a situation that is pretty evident to anyone interested.
I can see no reason for being hypocritical about the thing, play

One-quarter of the way through the 1959 track and field season,
Payton Jordan finds his Stanford Indians with still an excellent
chance to hang up national-class marks, records in any of several
categories, and perhaps even some team victories
Though somewhat smaller in number than either of Jordan's
teams during his first two years here, the 1959 squad appears to be
composed ol more determined athletes and fewer hangers-on or goof j
offs than either of the past two teams. While this is a good recom- j
mendation for the team members themselves, it's also a big mark in i
the credit column for Jordan (plus former frosh coach Floyd Strain
and present frosh coach Jim Ten-ill» and his work in breaking down
tlio lackadaisical and devil-may-care attitude that has surrounded
Stanford track and other sports for some time.
The 1959 team, while boasting several performers who are defi
nitely of national or world class, has been hurt badly in dual meets
by lack of balance. Failure to score in the hurdles, inconsistency in
the pole vault, less than-anticipated performances in the sprints, and
several injuries or illnesses have all proven costly in the point col
umn.
Keith Wallace, for example, has failed to come back to his fall
clockings in the two-mile. Shin splints, presumably from constant
pounding, have left him in less-than-perfect condition, hence his times
have shot up 2o or 30 seconds.
Norman l.loyd is another one who's had trouble. His training has
been retarded by several problems, and hence he hasn't been able yet
to round into shape for tough competition.
Loss of Jerry Winters via ineligibility hurt in Ihe shot-put for the |
first three meets. It's still touch-and-go whether he'll be able to com
pete this quarter, though an llth-hour ruling on a technicality may
make him eligible for I < I.A Saturday.
(>n the brighter side have been the performances of the middle
distance men and those of several assorted field eventers. Bertil
I.iiimIIi, the sophomore transfer from Norway, and Lrnie ('unlit'fe,
the dependable man in any meet, both look to be on the trail toward
numerous individual honors. With this pair on the 1320 and milt 1 legs
of a distance medley relay, Stanford could find itself within easy
shooting distance of a world best.
I>ick Lassen and Mon/.ingo, the second echelon in 1he 880 and
mile, haven't let the top two get very far ahead of them. Monzingo's
■1:1! 7 against Oxy was particularly good to see, and Lassen looks
nearly ready to crack into the 1:51's.
John Kelly, probably the most consistently good performer on 1he
team, is in his usual good form, lie's broad-jumped far enough to
win ;i!l three meets this year, and with his early season 215, should
be ready to improve on last spring's sixth place finish in the NCAA
ainl national AAU meets.

But while Jordan continues it) produce more and more outstand
ing individual performers, the Indians have still failed to reverse
what is becoming a fairly long string of losses to the other four
major dual meet powers of the West. Actually, this loss cycle should
n't make the Indians out to be as bad as ihe simple won-lost figures
might indicate.
Teams like SC and Oxy are often the best in the country, and
San Jose is even moving into that class. Were Stanford meeting
schools from other areas of the country instead of only the toughest
there arc, its won-lost record would be a far different story.
Still, the ( arils come closer all the time but each year, they're
killed by lack ol balance. Two years ago, there was a dearth of dis
tance runnel's; last year, the weightmen fell down; now, the hurdles
are the weakest point.
Iiut despite some of the gloomy sides of the picture, Jordan is
confident that come some meet in the not-so-distant future, his In
dians will put together enough come-through performances to regis
ter a nice fat upset. And when they do, the gate will open for more j
confidence to come in and more victories to come out.

An interesting bit of psychological warfare has been going on
recently in local publications, the central theme of it being a blast
at Stanford attitudes. The contention is that Stanford athletes don't
put out 100 per cent, and that most of the so-called fans don't really
give a hoot what happens.
Reaction to these charges has been sharply divided. One camp
has been highly disturbed, fearing that the athlete recruitment pro-1
gram will be hurt and that the University will get a "bad name." j
The other side says, "Well, (he criticism is for tin* most part true,
sti why try to hide it?" Significantly, there doesn't seem to be any
denying that attitude is indeed a big problem in Stanford athletics. I
I think anyone at all close to the athletic picture here can easily
sec that attitude and lack of a full effort is a problem. And I would
agree with those who see no point in trying to cover up or gloss over
a situation that is pretty evident to anyone interested.
I can see no reason for being hypocritical about the thing, play
ing ostrich toward it, or trying to keep the facts from other athletes !
who may want to come to Stanford. And then perhaps if the facts j
get out in the open, there will be an improvement in a not-too-nice

One-quarter of the way through the 1959 track and field season,
Payton Jordan finds his Stanford Indians with still an excellent
chance to hang up national-class marks, records in any of several
categories, and perhaps even some team victories
Though somewhat smaller in number than either of Jordan's
teams during his first two years here, the 1959 squad appears to be
composed ol more determined athletes and fewer hangers-on or goof j
offs than either of the past two teams. While this is a good recom- j
mendation for the team members themselves, it's also a big mark in i
the credit column for Jordan (plus former frosh coach Floyd Strain
and present frosh coach Jim Ten-ill» and his work in breaking down
tlio lackadaisical and devil-may-care attitude that has surrounded
Stanford track and other sports for some time.
The 1959 team, while boasting several performers who are defi
nitely of national or world class, has been hurt badly in dual meets
by lack of balance. Failure to score in the hurdles, inconsistency in
the pole vault, less than-anticipated performances in the sprints, and
several injuries or illnesses have all proven costly in the point col
umn.
Keith Wallace, for example, has failed to come back to his fall
clockings in the two-mile. Shin splints, presumably from constant
pounding, have left him in less-than-perfect condition, hence his times
have shot up 2o or 30 seconds.
Norman l.loyd is another one who's had trouble. His training has
been retarded by several problems, and hence he hasn't been able yet
to round into shape for tough competition.
Loss of Jerry Winters via ineligibility hurt in Ihe shot-put for the |
first three meets. It's still touch-and-go whether he'll be able to com
pete this quarter, though an llth-hour ruling on a technicality may
make him eligible for I < I.A Saturday.
(>n the brighter side have been the performances of the middle
distance men and those of several assorted field eventers. Bertil
I.iiimIIi, the sophomore transfer from Norway, and Lrnie ('unlit'fe,
the dependable man in any meet, both look to be on the trail toward
numerous individual honors. With this pair on the 1320 and milt 1 legs
of a distance medley relay, Stanford could find itself within easy
shooting distance of a world best.
I>ick Lassen and Mon/.ingo, the second echelon in 1he 880 and
mile, haven't let the top two get very far ahead of them. Monzingo's
■1:1! 7 against Oxy was particularly good to see, and Lassen looks
nearly ready to crack into the 1:51's.
John Kelly, probably the most consistently good performer on 1he
team, is in his usual good form, lie's broad-jumped far enough to
win ;i!l three meets this year, and with his early season 215, should
be ready to improve on last spring's sixth place finish in the NCAA
ainl national AAU meets.
