# FIRST PCC ACTION
## Tracksters Face Bruins in South 
### 
When Stanford travels to West wood to meet UCLA's track and
field forces Saturday, the Indians will find themselves in practically
ihe same situation as when they hosted Occidental last Saturday.
The situation: the Bruins are strong and weak in almost the same
spots as were the Tigers.
The problem: how to make up the 23-point deficit that came in

the Occidental meet if, indeed, the
Bruins are close to a carbon copy
of Oxy.
UCLA Tough in Sprints
Chuck Coker's boys were tough
in the sprints with Ed Bixler and
Rudy Alston UCLA has Rich
Johnson (9.7) and Steve Scott
(9.8 1, both of whom are also 21.5
furlong men. If Dean Smith and
Norman Pease don't show any
more than they did Saturday, the
Bruins can chalk up 1G points.
UCLA looks good for a pair of
sweeps in the hurdles. Ken
Thompson at 11.2 and 23.4 heads
the deep contingent of Bruin
stickmen.
Like Oxy, UCLA is tough in the
pole vault. George .Roubanis (14-
6Vs), Bill Logan (14-0) and Herb
Young (13-8) are all better than
anything the Indians have shown
this spring.
Clark Branson (55-4) and Du
anc Milleman (53-7) give the Bru
ins strength in the shot-put. Jer
ry Winters could make it a battle
for second, but he has to straight
en out his eligibility problems be
fore he can even take tomorrow's
plane south.
Hi;; Kffort Needed
Thus, in the six events where
Oxy scored 49 points, to Stan
ford's five, it appears likely that
the Bruins can make il an even
worse 51-3.
Things aren't nearly so bad for
the Cards in the other nine events
but Stanford would have to
come up with practically super
human efforts to win.
The best of the rest of Ihe Bru
ins in the track events look to be
Doug Julian, a 15.4 quarter-miler
who could well whip Don Chesa
rek, and Ken Riding, probably an
easy winner in the two-mile since
Keith Wallace won't be going
south.
In the field, Nagalingam Ethir
veerasingam can probably win
the high jump if he goes G-4 or
G-5. James Johnson and Bobby
Smith will probably get thr place
and show points in the broad
jump with their 22-foot jumps,
and Milleman, at IGI-4, has at
least an even chance to cop the
discus.
Only in the javelin, where eli
gibility woes have hit, do the
Bruins fail to have anyone who
looks fairly sure to score.
To capitalize on this weakness,
the Indians will have Jim Back
strand, who had a career best of
211-11 against: Oxy, Jim Korth
and Skip Face.
