# Promising Papoose Nine Opens Slate Tomorrow
## 
### 
Solid pitching — an attractive
prospect to Stanford baseball at
the present time may be the
strong point of the 1959 Papoose
baseballers, slated to open their
season tomorrow a 112 t e r no on
against Galileo High School of
San Francisco.
Coach Mickey Holzman points
to the seven top-flight hurlers on
this year's roster as the largest
number of frosh moundsmen in
years. Add to this several of the
top prep stars of the Coast and
the outlook seems bright for the
Papooses.
Good Infield
The frosh infield is "loaded."
Second baseman Skip Lawrence,
from Long Beach, may be the
squad's outstanding bats m a n .
Third sacker Rich Ferrazzano,
from Palo Alto, was one of the
area's top prepsters last year and
Sacramento High donates a stand
out shortstop, O. J. Solander.
At first base, Holzman has Pete
Verdurmen, of Portland's Lincoln
High School, American Legion
national runner-up two years ago.
Verdurmen's older brother Ed is
a former Card pitcher.
Catching, the Papooses have
one of the area's top prizes: Hob
Overman of Los Altos, named the
Peninsula's Outstanding Athlete
last year.
The first line outfield currently
lists Lauren Underwood, also of
Portland's Lincoln, in left; Jack

Dennett of Eugene, Ore., in cen
ter, and Millett Keller of Great
Falls, Mont., in light.
Miller Heads Staff
Heading the Papoose mound
staff are left-handers Mark Miller
and Roger Willett and right-hand
er Joe Schultz.
Miller comes with an excellent
high school reputation from Jef
ferson High School in Portland.
Schultz, from Vallejo, is one of
the pleasant surprises of the
squad and should give llolzman
good right-hand punch.
The frosh will play home-and
home series this year with the
San Jose State, Santa Clara and
California freshmen in addition
to 10 games with outstanding
high school teams of the area,
including one clash with Roose
velt Hich of Fresno.

ter, and Millett Keller of Great
Falls, Mont., in light.
Miller Heads Staff
Heading the Papoose mound
staff are left-handers Mark Miller
and Roger Willett and right-hand
er Joe Schultz.
Miller comes with an excellent
high school reputation from Jef
ferson High School in Portland.
Schultz, from Vallejo, is one of
the pleasant surprises of the
squad and should give llolzman
good right-hand punch.
The frosh will play home-and
home series this year with the
San Jose State, Santa Clara and
California freshmen in addition
to 10 games with outstanding
high school teams of the area,
including one clash with Roose
velt Hich of Fresno.
Solid pitching — an attractive
prospect to Stanford baseball at
the present time may be the
strong point of the 1959 Papoose
baseballers, slated to open their
season tomorrow a 112 t e r no on
against Galileo High School of
San Francisco.
Coach Mickey Holzman points
to the seven top-flight hurlers on
this year's roster as the largest
number of frosh moundsmen in
years. Add to this several of the
top prep stars of the Coast and
the outlook seems bright for the
Papooses.
Good Infield
The frosh infield is "loaded."
Second baseman Skip Lawrence,
from Long Beach, may be the
squad's outstanding bats m a n .
Third sacker Rich Ferrazzano,
from Palo Alto, was one of the
area's top prepsters last year and
Sacramento High donates a stand
out shortstop, O. J. Solander.
At first base, Holzman has Pete
Verdurmen, of Portland's Lincoln
High School, American Legion
national runner-up two years ago.
Verdurmen's older brother Ed is
a former Card pitcher.
Catching, the Papooses have
one of the area's top prizes: Hob
Overman of Los Altos, named the
Peninsula's Outstanding Athlete
last year.
The first line outfield currently
lists Lauren Underwood, also of
Portland's Lincoln, in left; Jack

Dennett of Eugene, Ore., in cen
ter, and Millett Keller of Great
Falls, Mont., in light.
