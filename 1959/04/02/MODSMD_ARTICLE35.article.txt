# Napa Cabin Available to Students
## 
### 
A cabin near Napa is available
to students who would like to get
off campus for some quiet relax
ation and conversation.
A place where people can come
with or without their books, the
cabin is a one-year experiment
which will lead, it is hoped, to the
beginning of an outdoor retreat
and recreation center for stu
dents on Stanford - owned land
nearer the campus.
The cabin at Napa will be used
for weekend ASSU hostels with
informal discussions, hiking,

swimming and cooking.
Students may sign up at the
ASSU office for detailed informa
tion. The cost is $2.50 per stu
dent for a day and a night. A
faculty couple will be hosts for
the hostels each weekend.
