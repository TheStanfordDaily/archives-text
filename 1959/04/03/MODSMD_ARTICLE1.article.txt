# LASSU Raps Federal Loan Loyalty Oaths
## 
### Barbara Hicks 
Legislature last night went on record as opposing the loyalty oath
and affidavit requirement attached to federal government loans to
students.
In a 12 to four vote, members supported the recommendation of
I lie Academic Affairs Committee headed by Gail Greiner, Lagunita

representative.
Miss Greiner, in giving the com
mittee report, argued that loyalty
oaths could be an undesirable
trend toward what she called the
"garrison state," and that they
open a person to future charges of
perjury, should his values change.
She questioned the two phrases
"true faith and allegiance" and
"enemies, foreign and domestic,"
asking who is to .judge whether
these standards are upheld.
"Are we so afraid of what may
happen to our Government that
we feel the need to protect it
through such means as loyalty
oaths?" she also asked.
Opposing the committee's rec
ommendation were Pete Erlin,
Men's Row; Charles Shuken,
Stern; Robert Soli, Graduate
School; and Dave Long, off-cam
pus substitute.
The four contended that loyalty
oaths served as a reminder to citi
zens of their 1 duties to the Govern
ment. which, in this case, is giving
financial aid.
Shuken argued that being liable
to a perjury charge through loy
alty oaths is no safeguard, be
cause it is often difficult to detect
traitors. Soli added he feared that
opposition to loyally oaths was
based on nonconformity for the
sake of nonconformity.
Larry Kelley, ASSU financial
manager, pointed out that the
monetary consideration is small
in this instance, because the
amount of money made available
by the Government to Stanford
for aid is a minute fraction of ihe
total funds available from the Uni
versity, and it is unlikely that a
â€¢student would fail to get aid from
Ihe University because he did not
sign a loyalty oath.
Legislature also passed a reso
lution expressing appreciation to
Dr. Wallace Sterling for his lead
ership as University president for
the past 10 years.
In other action, the Legislature
gave full backing to plans for the
"Sidewalk Cafe" at the I Center.
Sandra Bull, representing the cafe
planning committee, explained
that the project is designed to pro
vide a place where students can
get together for expresso coffee.
She emphasized they do not plan
to compete with the Union in sell
ing food.
Kelley said that a mandate by
the Union's board of governors
several years ago requires that all
profits from projects such as the
Sidewalk Cafe go to the Union,
but he sairl the present board re
ferred the question to the Legis
lature to canvass student support
for the venture.
Legislature empowered Kelley
to negotiate with the Union board

for the financing of the Sidewalk
Cafe. They also passed a resolu
tion commending Miss Bull and
others of the committee for their
work.
An appropriation of $90 was ap
prover! to purchase 10 air mat
tresses for the hostel site near
Napa.
Referred to the Academic Af
fairs Committee were several
questions regarding the final ex
aminations schedule.
Carolee Houser, ASSU vice pres
ident, who presided in the absence
of president John Bohn, who is in
Denver, announced that there will
be no meeting next week.
