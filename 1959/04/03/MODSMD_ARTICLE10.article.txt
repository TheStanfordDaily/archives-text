# DIVISION BECOMES DEPARTMENT
## Aeronautics Boom at Stanford 
### 
Stanford's Aeronautical Engineering Di
vision has been made a full-fledged depart
ment of the School of Engineering by the
University's Board of Trustees, Dean Jo
seph M. Pettit announced yesterday.
The action highlights a renewed boom in
aeronautics and space engineering at Stan
ford.
Since 19.17 the new department's gradu
ate students have increased from 21 to (51
and ils faculty from four to 12. Labora
tory and office space have been expanded
by more than 15,000 square feet.
Still more working area is being carved
out of its Guggenheim Aeronautical Labo
ratory by renovation of older space to ac
commodate the burgeoning research pro
gram.
Professor Nicholas J. Hoff, head of the
department sincc 1 D.~)7, gives major credit
for this metamorphosis to a group of alum
ni engineers and six large aircraft compa
nies.
Alumni Committer
The alumni are members of a committee
headed by John C. Buekwalter of Douglas,
and earlier by Philip A. Colman of Lock
heed. Organized primarily to enlist finan
cial aid for I he program, the committee's
efforts so far have brought in gifts and
pledges totaling $160,000 from the six com
paniesâ€”Convair, Douglas, Hughes, Lock

hood, North American find Northrop.
Those funds will bolster Stanford's aero
nautical engineering program ovor a five
year period. It is expected that other com
panies in the aircraft industry will also
participate in the program.
The present committee members, includ
ing Buckwalter as chairman, are Meyer
Fishboin of the Myra Corporation, Ed P.
French of Marquardt Aircraft, Phil M.
Klauber of Solar Aircraft, Milton A. Miner
of Huek Bolt Company, Howard E. Roberts
of Fairehild, and S. E. Weaver of North
rop's Kadioplane Division.
Advisory Council
The revitalized department is now in the
process of organizing an additional advi
sory council, composed principally of mem
bers from the aircraft industry. The coun
cil will advise the department's faculty on
technical trends and needs in aeronautics
and space engineering.
Research in the department already ex
ceeds a third of a million dollars per year.
It is being carrier! out by faculty who in
clude some of the nation's recognized top
experts in aircraft structures, transonic
aerodynamics, elasticity of materials and
hypersonic gas dynamics.
Investigations so far have taken three
major directions: airplane and missile
structures, high-temperature erosion prob

lems at supersonic speeds, and construction
of hypersonic wind tunnels for aerodynam
ic research.
Wind Tunnel
An arc-discharge wind tunnel now under
construction will generate an air speed over
12,000 m.p.h. at a temperature of 14,000 de
grees Fahrenheit and 30,000 pounds per
square inch pressure. Other equipment in
cludes a battery of quartz lamps that can
bring an aircraft structure's surface to the
melting point in seconds, simulating the
intense heat encountered by a satellite re
entering the earth's atmosphere.
Dean Pettit looks toward the depart
ment's future with high optimism.
"We have moved ahead faster than we ex
pected and have readjusted our goals up
ward," ho said. "With the help of our
friends in the aircraft industry, we again
will have one of the top aeronautical engi
neering programs in the country."
Stanford's aeronautical engineering pro
gram first won fame under the late Pro
fessor William F. Durand, one of aviation's
most revered pioneers, who died last year
at the aye of H9. In some of his most noted
research, Durand worked out the basic the
ories for the design of aircraft propellers.
A national scientific meeting at Stanford,
the Durand Centennial Conference, is be
ing planned for next Aug. 5-7 in his honor.
