## 
### 
J. E. W A I,LACK Stfkmn.g celebrates liis I Otli anniversary as Presi
dent of Stanford I niversity on April 5. The editorial hoard and
stall ol The Stanford Daily extend to hint our sincere congratu
lations.
Shin ford has grown under /'resident Sterling s ilirec
lion, and in a special hiiul of way. The number of stu
dents has remained nearly constant since 1048, hut the
physical plant has c.rpatided tremendously and, more
important, the University has grown academically, assum
ing dignity anil leaderslii p among the great uni versitics
of this country.
President Sterling's record of accomplishment has hcen more
than evident to the students now attending Stanford. Seniors will
remember initiating the new Wilbur Hall for freshmen in 1955;
Florence Moore Hall for women was first occupied hy present
Stanford students; and each fall students return to find a few
more Segments of the Quad remodeled.
These are examples of the efficiency and effectiveness of the
President. In total, during the past 10 years 1800 students have
been rehoused.
Teaching facilities hai e been enlarged under the Presi
dent'' s directum in the past 10 years. I lie Physics Lecture
Hall along with several laboratories have been constructed
as the beginnings of a Science Quad, and the 22 million
dollar Palo Alto Stanford Medical (.'enter has been fi
nanced and is now under construction.
Beginnings on the 10-nnit Student Activity Center have been
made, with Diukelspiel Music Building completed and the new
Bookstore and Post Office now under construction.
The financial imagination of President Sterling has resulted
in the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Industrial Park.
This land development program nets the University more than
$500,000 a year over and above what the funds invested in the
program Would Lave brought as part of our regular endowment.
But more important than this physical growth, Presi
dent Sterling hasn't hesitated to apply his energies to im
proving Stanford academically, innovating when neces
sary and establishing precedents that other nniversifies
are sure to follow.
A very careful consideration of the educational goals of the
I niversity bv the President has resulted in the (General Studies
Program, which was first put into effect in 1956. The purpose ol
this new program is '"'to make available to each new generation
of students, through a first-rate teaching program, the knowledge
\vhich man has gained about himself, his institutions, and the
physical world of which he is a part."
Stanford, under President Sterling, conceived of the idea of
opening a branch of the University in a foreign country as an edu
cational experiment. Stanford-in-Germany seems to have been a
complete success, and other universities are now adopting the idea.
II ith such academic leadership and the exceptionally
icell qualified faculty that President Sterling has been able
to attract, Stanford now ranks among the top universities
in the country.
We are fourth in the nation in the number of National Merit
Scholars and eighth nationally in the 1958-59 list of institutions
chosen by National Science Foundation Fellows. Stanford was first
choice of 43 Woodrow \\ ilson Fellows this year.
further attesting to the distinction of the faculty under Presi
dent Sterling are the various awards that have come to faculty
members in these last 10 years. Four faculty members have been
awarded Nobel Prizes, and eight members of the faculty have been
selected to the National Academy of Sciences since 1949, to men
tion only a few.
And. beyond this immense capacity for physical and
cultural accomplishments. President Sterling has achieved
something more—a special kind i>f personal relationship
with the Stanford students. With all of the burden of re
sponsibility that is invoiced in the office of the President,
l)r. Sterling still finds time to teach a course, chat infor
mally with this and that group of students, and give a
friendly word of advice to the student who tcatulers into
his office.
We congratulate President Sterling for 10 very significant years
—and look forward to the great ihings still to come.

ing dignity anil leaderslii p among the great uni versitics
of this country.
President Sterling's record of accomplishment has hcen more
than evident to the students now attending Stanford. Seniors will
remember initiating the new Wilbur Hall for freshmen in 1955;
Florence Moore Hall for women was first occupied hy present
Stanford students; and each fall students return to find a few
more Segments of the Quad remodeled.
These are examples of the efficiency and effectiveness of the
President. In total, during the past 10 years 1800 students have
been rehoused.
Teaching facilities hai e been enlarged under the Presi
dent'' s directum in the past 10 years. I lie Physics Lecture
Hall along with several laboratories have been constructed
as the beginnings of a Science Quad, and the 22 million
dollar Palo Alto Stanford Medical (.'enter has been fi
nanced and is now under construction.
Beginnings on the 10-nnit Student Activity Center have been
made, with Diukelspiel Music Building completed and the new
Bookstore and Post Office now under construction.
The financial imagination of President Sterling has resulted
in the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Industrial Park.
This land development program nets the University more than
$500,000 a year over and above what the funds invested in the
program Would Lave brought as part of our regular endowment.
But more important than this physical growth, Presi
dent Sterling hasn't hesitated to apply his energies to im
proving Stanford academically, innovating when neces
sary and establishing precedents that other nniversifies
are sure to follow.
A very careful consideration of the educational goals of the
I niversity bv the President has resulted in the (General Studies
Program, which was first put into effect in 1956. The purpose ol
this new program is '"'to make available to each new generation
of students, through a first-rate teaching program, the knowledge
\vhich man has gained about himself, his institutions, and the
physical world of which he is a part."
Stanford, under President Sterling, conceived of the idea of
opening a branch of the University in a foreign country as an edu
cational experiment. Stanford-in-Germany seems to have been a
complete success, and other universities are now adopting the idea.
II ith such academic leadership and the exceptionally
icell qualified faculty that President Sterling has been able
to attract, Stanford now ranks among the top universities
in the country.
We are fourth in the nation in the number of National Merit
Scholars and eighth nationally in the 1958-59 list of institutions
chosen by National Science Foundation Fellows. Stanford was first
choice of 43 Woodrow \\ ilson Fellows this year.
further attesting to the distinction of the faculty under Presi
dent Sterling are the various awards that have come to faculty
members in these last 10 years. Four faculty members have been
awarded Nobel Prizes, and eight members of the faculty have been
selected to the National Academy of Sciences since 1949, to men
tion only a few.
And. beyond this immense capacity for physical and
cultural accomplishments. President Sterling has achieved
something more—a special kind i>f personal relationship
with the Stanford students. With all of the burden of re
sponsibility that is invoiced in the office of the President,
l)r. Sterling still finds time to teach a course, chat infor
mally with this and that group of students, and give a
friendly word of advice to the student who tcatulers into
his office.
We congratulate President Sterling for 10 very significant years
—and look forward to the great ihings still to come.

been rehoused.
Teaching facilities hai e been enlarged under the Presi
dent'' s directum in the past 10 years. I lie Physics Lecture
Hall along with several laboratories have been constructed
as the beginnings of a Science Quad, and the 22 million
dollar Palo Alto Stanford Medical (.'enter has been fi
nanced and is now under construction.
Beginnings on the 10-nnit Student Activity Center have been
made, with Diukelspiel Music Building completed and the new
Bookstore and Post Office now under construction.
The financial imagination of President Sterling has resulted
in the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Industrial Park.
This land development program nets the University more than
$500,000 a year over and above what the funds invested in the
program Would Lave brought as part of our regular endowment.
But more important than this physical growth, Presi
dent Sterling hasn't hesitated to apply his energies to im
proving Stanford academically, innovating when neces
sary and establishing precedents that other nniversifies
are sure to follow.
A very careful consideration of the educational goals of the
I niversity bv the President has resulted in the (General Studies
Program, which was first put into effect in 1956. The purpose ol
this new program is '"'to make available to each new generation
of students, through a first-rate teaching program, the knowledge
\vhich man has gained about himself, his institutions, and the
physical world of which he is a part."
Stanford, under President Sterling, conceived of the idea of
opening a branch of the University in a foreign country as an edu
cational experiment. Stanford-in-Germany seems to have been a
complete success, and other universities are now adopting the idea.
II ith such academic leadership and the exceptionally
icell qualified faculty that President Sterling has been able
to attract, Stanford now ranks among the top universities
in the country.
We are fourth in the nation in the number of National Merit
Scholars and eighth nationally in the 1958-59 list of institutions
chosen by National Science Foundation Fellows. Stanford was first
choice of 43 Woodrow \\ ilson Fellows this year.
further attesting to the distinction of the faculty under Presi
dent Sterling are the various awards that have come to faculty
members in these last 10 years. Four faculty members have been
awarded Nobel Prizes, and eight members of the faculty have been
selected to the National Academy of Sciences since 1949, to men
tion only a few.
And. beyond this immense capacity for physical and
cultural accomplishments. President Sterling has achieved
something more—a special kind i>f personal relationship
with the Stanford students. With all of the burden of re
sponsibility that is invoiced in the office of the President,
l)r. Sterling still finds time to teach a course, chat infor
mally with this and that group of students, and give a
friendly word of advice to the student who tcatulers into
his office.
We congratulate President Sterling for 10 very significant years
—and look forward to the great ihings still to come.
