# California Abroad
## Whittier, Redlands Plan European Sites 
### 
(Editor's Note: Stanford is
not lln* only California school
to establish a branch abroad.
Whittier College also is setting
lip a European campus, and tin*
University of Kedlands may fol
low suit soon. The following
article, from the Los Angeles
Times of March 22, was written
by Dick Turpin, Times educa
tion editor.)
California's tree of higher edu
cation keeps branching out.
The newest limb, according to
an announcement last week by
Dr. Paul S. Smith, president of
Whittier College, will tie added by
his school at the University of
Copenhagen as a permanent over
seas campus.
With Stanford University's pio
neering branch established in
Stuttgart, Germany, last June,
and the University of Kedlands'
current survey aimed at founding
a unit in western Europe, the sym
bol of the redwood will become
more synonymous with California
than it must already be to Euro
peans.
First Contingent
Between 40 and 50 students will
make up the first contingent to
Denmark next September. As in
the Stanford concept, they will
have the advantages of study and
travel, with all Scandinavia and
the rest of Europe within easy
reach. None of the programs in
terferes with regular weekday in
struction.
Named to head the Copenhagen
branch of the Quaker school is a
sociologist at the college since
194G, Gerald Patton. He began his
foreign travels in 1932 as a YMCA

executive. Mrs. Patton will repre
sent the dean of women's office m
Whit lier College-in-Copenhagen.
Danish Professors
Six Danish professors will serve
with Patton on the faculty for the
"foreign" Americans, who will
meet in classrooms provided b\
the University for courses in
tory, sociology, political science
and art.
In addition to inevitable week
end ja un t s to the interesting
points of the Continent, the class
will take a three-week field trip
through the Scandinavian nations.
It is very conceivable that ;i
year from now Iledlands will have
its branch located (somewhere in
Ger many, France. Belgium, 11< >1
land or Austria), and that the first
contingent of Whittier students
will have returned to the home
campus to finish out their careers,
while the second class will tie in
the midst of its semester's work
abroad.
What we are wondering about,
after all this campus gadding, is:
Will some European school turn
about and :;et up a branch here?

executive. Mrs. Patton will repre
sent the dean of women's office m
Whit lier College-in-Copenhagen.
Danish Professors
Six Danish professors will serve
with Patton on the faculty for the
"foreign" Americans, who will
meet in classrooms provided b\
the University for courses in
tory, sociology, political science
and art.
In addition to inevitable week
end ja un t s to the interesting
points of the Continent, the class
will take a three-week field trip
through the Scandinavian nations.
It is very conceivable that ;i
year from now Iledlands will have
its branch located (somewhere in
Ger many, France. Belgium, 11< >1
land or Austria), and that the first
contingent of Whittier students
will have returned to the home
campus to finish out their careers,
while the second class will tie in
the midst of its semester's work
abroad.
What we are wondering about,
after all this campus gadding, is:
Will some European school turn
about and :;et up a branch here?
(Editor's Note: Stanford is
not lln* only California school
to establish a branch abroad.
Whittier College also is setting
lip a European campus, and tin*
University of Kedlands may fol
low suit soon. The following
article, from the Los Angeles
Times of March 22, was written
by Dick Turpin, Times educa
tion editor.)
California's tree of higher edu
cation keeps branching out.
The newest limb, according to
an announcement last week by
Dr. Paul S. Smith, president of
Whittier College, will tie added by
his school at the University of
Copenhagen as a permanent over
seas campus.
With Stanford University's pio
neering branch established in
Stuttgart, Germany, last June,
and the University of Kedlands'
current survey aimed at founding
a unit in western Europe, the sym
bol of the redwood will become
more synonymous with California
than it must already be to Euro
peans.
First Contingent
Between 40 and 50 students will
make up the first contingent to
Denmark next September. As in
the Stanford concept, they will
have the advantages of study and
travel, with all Scandinavia and
the rest of Europe within easy
reach. None of the programs in
terferes with regular weekday in
struction.

branch of the Quaker school is a
