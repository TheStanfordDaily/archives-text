# MED SCHOOL GRANT
## Program to Combine Medical, Social Science 
### 
Under a $255,000 grant from the Russell Sage Foundation, Stan
lord Medical School will establish a new teaching and research pro
gram that combines social sciences with medicine.
The departments of sociology, anthropology and psychology will
collaborate with the students and faculty of the medical school. The

unique program will begin next
fall when the medical school
moves into its new $20 million
center on the Stanford campus.
The Russell Sage grant: pro
vides basic support for the first
five years and will finance a be
ginning staff, student fellowships
and some research. Nurses, social
workers and other members of
the health team are expected to
be included in the program some
time in the future.
The plan was conceived under
an earlier grant from the Sage
Foundation. Planners who worked
on the program included Asso
ciate Dean Lyman N. Stowe of
the medical school, Professor

Rodney R. Beard of preventive
medicine, Professor Thomas A.
Gonda of psychiatry and Profes
sor Edmund H. Volkart of so
ciology.
Professor Volkart, who will di
rect the program during its first
year, says, "Similar programs
have been started at Harvard,
Yale and other universities, but
to our knowledge none is as com
prehensive as the Stanford pro
gram. We will emphasize inter
departmental teaching and re
search on a large scale."
"Our intent is not to make so
cial scientists out of medical stu
dents, or to convert social scien
tists into physicians. However,
sociologists familiar with family
and community structure should
be valuable partners in studying
child health, the problems of re
habilitation and ambulatory pa
tient care," Volkart continued.
"Psychologists and anthropolo
gists who have studied social and
cultural causes of stress can add
much to courses in clinical medi
cine, psychiatry or the basic med
ical sciences," he concluded.
