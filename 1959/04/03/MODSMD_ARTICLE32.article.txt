# Tribe Battles Odds In Southland Meet
## DAILY Sports Scene 
### Dick Barnes 
A track and field test fully as
strong as lust week's against Occi
dental awaits Stanford when it
.angies with UCLA tomorrow at
1:30 on Trotter Track in West
wood.
Seeking their second victory of
ihe season against two losses, Pay
lon Jordan's Indians find them
selves in the position of having to
■score more heavily than expected
in the flat races, discus and per
haps the shot-put to offset glaring
weaknesses in the hurdles and the
pole vault.
Sprinters Dean Smith and Nor
man Pease may well be the key to
Stanford fortunes. Based on re
cent showings, the Cards figure to
<et no better than a third in each
iash. But a return to previous
best marks by either or both of
the Indians could shift as many as
10 points to the Stanford side and
put a team victory within shooting
distance.
Tough 110 Ace
Captain Don Chesarek has his
work cut out for him in the 440,
where Doug Julian of the Bruins
has a of 48.4, just one-tenth
off what Chesarek has run in his
last two races.
Chesarek finished very strong
11 both the quarter and relay
against Oxy, but ii remains to be
whether or not he can hold
up neck-and-neck competition over
the final 30 yards.
Bob Bessie, who ran his best-ever
race against Oxy, should also &ive
.) u Ii a n trouble in the quarter.
Stanford's strongest running
points ligure to l>e the SKO and the
mile. Ernie Cunliffe and Bertil
Lundh shouldn't have too much
trouble dividing the firsts and sec
onds between them, since they're
each several -seconds ahead of the
best the Bruins have.
Dick Lassen in the half and Bob
Monzingo in the mile have each
come along very well this spring
and should make strong fights for
third.
Wallace Stays Home
With a bad case of shin splints
keeping Keith Wallace from per
fect shape, he won't be making the
trip. This leaves a two-mile vic
tory pretty much to Ken Riding of
UCLA.
Sweeps figures to be traded in
the pole vault and javelin. Mike
Franchetti will be the only Indian
vaulter since Dave Merchant came
up with a minor injury. And if

Franchetti doesn't improve over I
his early performances, he won't
come near even the 13-8 of UCLA's
No. 3 man, Herb Young.
Since Ron Ulrieh was lost via
ineligibility, the Bruins have been
left with virtually nothing in the
javelin. This leave# the field open
for Indians Jim Backstrand, Jim
Korth and Skip face and all
must score for the Tribe to have
a chance.
Torrence in lOasl
UCLA's Walt Torrence, in the
East on a basketball mission, will
bo out of the high jump. Nagaling
ham Ethirveerasingham should
pick off the five points, but Stan

lord's John Nourse and Paul Gil
lespie ought to get second and
third.
Stanford's ho pes for shot-put
points rest on an eligibility deci
sion. Jerry Winters if he be
comes eligible this morning
should score. But if he doesn't
make the I rip, it looks like another
Bruin sweep.
Luane Milleman and Armand
DeWeese rank about even in the
discus, another of the meet's most
decisive events. But in the broad
jump there doesn't seem to l>e too
much doubt that the Indians' John
Kelly will win his fourth meet of
the spring.

Dick Lassen in the half and Bob
Monzingo in the mile have each
come along very well this spring
and should make strong fights for

Wallace Stays Home
With a bad case of shin splints
keeping Keith Wallace from per
fect shape, he won't be making the
trip. This leaves a two-mile vic
tory pretty much to Ken Riding of
UCLA.
Sweeps figures to be traded in
the pole vault and javelin. Mike
Franchetti will be the only Indian
vaulter since Dave Merchant came
up with a minor injury. And if

Franchetti doesn't improve over I
his early performances, he won't
come near even the 13-8 of UCLA's
No. 3 man, Herb Young.
Since Ron Ulrieh was lost via
ineligibility, the Bruins have been
left with virtually nothing in the
javelin. This leave# the field open
for Indians Jim Backstrand, Jim
Korth and Skip face and all
must score for the Tribe to have
a chance.
Torrence in lOasl
UCLA's Walt Torrence, in the
East on a basketball mission, will
bo out of the high jump. Nagaling
ham Ethirveerasingham should
pick off the five points, but Stan

lord's John Nourse and Paul Gil
lespie ought to get second and
third.
Stanford's ho pes for shot-put
points rest on an eligibility deci
sion. Jerry Winters if he be
comes eligible this morning
should score. But if he doesn't
make the I rip, it looks like another
Bruin sweep.
Luane Milleman and Armand
DeWeese rank about even in the
discus, another of the meet's most
decisive events. But in the broad
jump there doesn't seem to l>e too
much doubt that the Indians' John
