# Patched-up Golf Team Meets COP
## 
### Stan Hulett 
Before Christmas vacation (he
golf picture at Stanford was ex
tremely bright but then three of
the top golfers were injured in
an automobile accident near Reno
and prospects dropped.
Bill Seanor, Bob Knelling and
Woodgie Reich were all injured
while oil a return trip to Stanford
from skiing. Reich and Snelling
are now playing, but it will be an
other eight months before Seanor
gets his leg out ol a cast.
Reich in Lineup
Snelling will not be in shape
for competition until just before
the PCC's and the Nationals.
Reich is currently playing num
ber live on the ladder. Had Sea
nor and Snelling both been able
to play, the Stanford golfers
would have been even up with
any top colege golf team in the
nation.
Still, the Card golfers have won
their first three matches, defeat
ing the Peninsula Golf and Coun
try Club, Fresno State and San
Francisco State.
Today the Cards meet College
of the Pacific and tomorrow the
Sunnyside Golf Club, both on the
Stanford course.
COP has not shown much pow
er this season and took sixth in
Northern California Intercolle
giate action last week. Today's
match starts at 1 p.m. and tomor
row's at noon.
Winton Helps
In the Northern California In
tercollegiates, Kent Winton, a
sophomore from Merced, missed
being the top medalist by one
stroke. Winton, according to
Coach Bud Finger, is steadily im
proving and could prove a tie
mendous help to the Stanford
team.
The Indian linksters have also
been helped out by the return of
senior Bernie Magnussen. Mag
nussen has twice qualified for the
National Open Golf Tournament
and is the top medal player on the
team. He plays well under pres
sure and will help the team's
chances immeasurably.
Ron Preston, a transfer from
Riverside, ended up number one
on the ladder matches. It is hoped
he will help fill the void on the
team left by Seanor.
Lamey Shows Promise
Jack Lamey, a sophomore from
Everett, Wash., is a fine natural
golfer. With a lot of hard work
he could become one of the finest
golfers ever at Stanford.
Mike Shanahan, a junior from
Altadena, represents an unknown
quality on the Card team. Shana
han did very well on the ladder
and has looked good in match
play. His medal play however is
not as sharp as his match play,
which is outstanding.
