Chances lor a few victories this spring in what has been otherwise
a rather b'eak athletic year? Not much better than anywhere else-
Actually, nobody should complain about basketball. The Injun

I Jut back to the Farm, the outlook:

that upset in dual meets. Watch the ;e guys in the relay meets, where
the great concentration of power

in the middle distances may mean

a serious blow in football or spring sports. But basketball may suffer.
The Bi« l our will have its little conference; the Northern outcasts
seem rcdy to form some sort of hoop league; there already is the
West Coast Athletic Conference all this would leave Stanford as an
independent in the mid-it of three conferences.
There is no doubt we could schedule 2G games with somebody, but
those conferences are going to want to reserve the good week-end
dates.
An Eastern independent can survive successfully because of the
many other independents in the area. Out West, Seattle, Portland

seem to be headed for the new northern hoop alignment.
Finally, it doe« look like the Big Four is beginning to think a little
about the other sports although it's still a case of football on the
brain. There was no disguising the disappointment of most of the
Pacific Coast Conference basketball coaches at the break-up of one

Stanford's last basketball game of the season won't be easily
forgot !en. Paul Neumann, about whom reams of copy have been
written in thi paper and every paper in California, ended a fabulous
college career arid received an unforgettable ovation as he left the
floor.
Tuesday, the Syracuse Nationals of the National Basketball Asso
ciation drafted Paul for possible duty next season. There seems little
doubt in our minds that Neumann has all of the equipment necessary
to be a top-flight pro guard. Few players today have his moves, his
shooting, his knack for come through play, his marvelous physical
equipment:
Hut it's a big jump to the pros. Each team carries but 10 men, and
there is no substitute for experience in that league. Neumann also is
reported to be in eye of .Jim Walsh, ex-Stanfordite who has just been
named coach of the National Industrial Basketball League's (AAU)
newest franchise.
Paul really showed his class in the National AAU tourney two
weeks ago with the Olympic Club of San Francisco. He was the OC's
No. 2 scorer (behind Stanford's Ron Tomsici, and his clutch shooting
was the principal factor in two victories.
lie almost pulled out the third game, a loss to powerful Wichita,
but his 1<) [joints weren't quite enough. Paul missed the last game of
the tournament, a consolation affair, because he had business else

All this brings to mind a comment by head cage coach Howie

Another So-So Outlook
Chances lor a few victories this spring in what has been otherwise
a rather b'eak athletic year? Not much better than anywhere else-
Actually, nobody should complain about basketball. The Injun
didn't lose al home took third in Ihe Conference behind NCAA cham
I>i'>ji ( alitoniia and Washington and also happened to be the las
11 •; 11 r; to beat Cul. That was Ihe 56-53 thriller in January.
( ii Sutnlonllike or not, it was pleasing to see the Hears eapturt
lhe national crown. To say the least, stock in West Coast basketbal
went up again. It was the third crown in five years for the defense
of the West. Am l last year about the only wide-open "offensive" tearr.
on the Coast, Seattle, came awfully close to taking home all of tin
marbles.
I Jut back to the Farm, the outlook:
I nbalaitcJ in track. I'ayton Jordan's boys are still gunning foi
that upset in dual meets. Watch the ;e guys in the relay meets, where
the great concentration of power

in the middle distances may mean
a bushel of new records.

Fven with the many disap
pointment' which seem to have
popped up already this season,
there are some real bright spot -.

ais aln i a !y have won one game
thej weren't suppo ;etl to: the 3-0
victory over defending NCAA
champ Southern < alifornia in the

Situ Bi» Murine tournament. A pair of sophomores, Karl Russell
;iii<l lerry l.indemun, have really bolstered Coach Dutch Fehrini;'s
pitching corps At the plate there isn't much wrong wilh this Tribe
li'.im Ai l miii Wronski, Ben Robinson, Mike IVlagee, Rich DeFahio
a lit I Joel NewUirk all hit consistently and for power.
Now. the only problem is to do something in the CIUA. SC is still
in ibis league, but SC is also ineligible for NCAA play. Cal is touted
as weaker than usual, and UCLA seems its usual so-so self. The
trouble here is Santa Clara, a not-too-touted club which hasn't lost a
name yet and has been playing like it doesn't intend to.
Hie Time Is Drawing Near
liut now Stanford is supposed to be preoccupied wilh that same
old Idig I our question again. The Big Four gets the Rose Bowl and
that is supposed to clinch Stanford's joining.
Ii looks more and more inevitable. Non-membership would not be
a serious blow in football or spring sports. But basketball may suffer.
The Bi« l our will have its little conference; the Northern outcasts
seem rcdy to form some sort of hoop league; there already is the
West Coast Athletic Conference all this would leave Stanford as an
independent in the mid-it of three conferences.
There is no doubt we could schedule 2G games with somebody, but
those conferences are going to want to reserve the good week-end
dates.
An Eastern independent can survive successfully because of the
many other independents in the area. Out West, Seattle, Portland
and (ion/aga have been about the only major independents, and they
seem to be headed for the new northern hoop alignment.
Finally, it doe« look like the Big Four is beginning to think a little
about the other sports although it's still a case of football on the
brain. There was no disguising the disappointment of most of the
Pacific Coast Conference basketball coaches at the break-up of one
ol the nation's best-balanced and best-operated conferences.
