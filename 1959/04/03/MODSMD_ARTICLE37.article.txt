Tribe Seeks Revenge
The Tribe will be seeking to
ivenge a 3-0 whitewashing at the
lands of State last month. In
hat one, Spartan hurler Dick
lolden set the Cards down with
nit one hit that one an infield
;inli 11 1 by opposing hurler John
jillis.
Stanford has become consider
djly tougher at the plate since
hen. The Cards bopped UCLA
wice last weekend in the South
and to take the early lead in CI
>A play. The Indians and the
Bruins arc the only conference
earns to have seen "counting"
action so far.
Next week, the Fchringmen
ake on College of the Pacific
Tuesday in more non-conference
day and Friday they return to
CJBA action against the red hot
Santa Clara Broncos.
Von Wronski Sparkles
Art Von Wronski in action af
er sitting out the campaign's
first few weeks because of appen
'icitis has been the big stick in
the Card attack. The senior
catcher belted UCLA pitching for
five hits last week and currently
boasts a . r>T 1 CI HA mark and a
.•171 average for all games.
Senior left-fielder Ben Robinson
hasn't been far behind in the bai
ling derby. In action in all 10
Card games, Robinson has col
lected 12 hits in 30 trips, includ
ing one double, one triple and one
home run.
(Catcher ) urned second baseman
Mike Magee has hit for a .294
mark in the early action. Along
with fellow sophomore Hal
Schutzman, Magee has gone a
long way toward solving the
Tribe's up - the - middle problems.
Below Far
Still yet to explode at the plate
are first baseman Joel Newkirk
and third-sacker Jim I3uik, two
of the lop Indian hitters last year,
and center fielder Harry .Rodda.
Sophomore John Hurlhut may
press for an outfield job. Hurlbut
has appeared in only one game
this year; got to bat only once —
and he tripled. This gives him a
1.000 batting average and a phe
nomenal 3.000 slugging percent
age.
Tomorrow's opponent, Sacra
mento State, is not the power in
baseball that it is in boxing but
nevertheless has been a rugged
opponent for Card nines in the
past.
