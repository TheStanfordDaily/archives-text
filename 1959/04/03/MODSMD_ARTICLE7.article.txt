# Ike Pledges US Support For NATO
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)- The Unit
ed States pledged Thursday to
use its full array of aircraft and
missile power - to defend its Atlan
tic Pact allies if it should become
necessary.
It made this pledge shortly af
ter President Eisenhower had
cautioned this country's North
Atlantic Pace allies against "sub
stituting illusions for reality" irr
seeking tension - reducing agree
ments with Russia.
Speaking on behalf of the U.S.
government, acting Secretary of
State Christian Herter also told
the 15-nation Atlantic Pact Coun
cil that the United States is now
making faster progress than Rus
sia in developing missiles.
Herter described American mil
itary might at a closed-door re
view of Soviet threats against
Berlin and Germany.
Despite the mounting tensions
over Berlin, Herter predicted the
crisis would be.settled without
shooting.
Herter spoke out a few hours
after Eisenhower addressed the
opening meeting of the pact coun
tries.
Ike Asks Courage
Recalling his days as a soldier.
Eisenhower appealed for free peo
ple to display courage, sacrifice
and perseverance while their gov
ernments search carefully for
just solutions to current East-
West deadlocks.
"We must be prepared, during
the years ahead," Eisenhower
said, "to live in a world in which
tension and bickering between
free nations and the Soviets will
be daily experiences."
Addressing the same closed
door meeting, Britain's Foreign
Secretary Selwyn Lloyd assured
the allied representatives that his
country stands as firmly as the
other allies in resisting Russian
pressure for one - sided agree
ments.
Lloyd put Britain on record as
viewing any plan for neutralizing
or demilitarizing Germany as the
worst possible solution of the
German problem.
Kritish Position
He also said Britain would not
advocate any troop and arms
freeze plan in Central Europe un
less it was linked with the goal
of German reunification.
Conference spokesmen sought
to picture the four Western Allies
as firmly united in their determi
nation to withstand Russian pres
sure for important concessions.
The main item of business was
a report by the U.S., British,
French and West Gorman govern
ments on a two-day conference
which ended here Wednesday
without agreement on what con
cessions to offer the Soviets.
