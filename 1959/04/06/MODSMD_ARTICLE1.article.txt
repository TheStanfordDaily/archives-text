## ASILOMAR CONFERENCE Students' Plan Gets Top Prize 
### 
Formulating new plans for U.S. foreign economic policy was the
job of 170 students who met at Asilomar last week for the 12th
annual conference of the Association of International Relations
Clubs, entitled "U.S. Investment in World Progress." George Ches
ter, a Stanford junior, was conference chairman.
Stanford's delegation, under the chairmanship of Edwin Warren,

received the first prize of $300 in
the anual program contest for the
most effective international rela
tions program. Second place went
to Hope College, Holland, Mich.
The conference gut under way
with delegates dividing into
groups to decide policy in four
areas: Guiding Principles of U.S.
Foreign Economic Policy; U.S.
Economic Policy and "Uncommit
ted'' Countries; U.S. Economic
Relations with Communist Coun
tries; and Reappraisal of Current
U.S. Foreign Economic Policy.
Reappraisal of Policy
In giving a reappraisal of cur
rent policy, the group suggested:
The U.S. give more aid to Af
rica and Latin America, while
maintaining aid to Asia; separate
military and economic parts of
the mutual security program;
long-term loans and appropria
tions for special projects, such as
the five-year plan in India; more
aid through regional agencies, in
stead of direct aid. Eventually, all
aid should be given through the
United Nations.
Simulating the roles of State
Department policy planners, the
delegates prepared a series of po
sition papers on specific phases
of U.S. economic policy. Copies
of these papers will be sent to Ihe
600 colleges represented in AIRC,
plus Hie Department of State and
the World Bank.
