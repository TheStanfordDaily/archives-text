tion Mexican trip. At a cost of
$47 each, 27 people, including nine
foreign students, traveled to En

deep-sea fishing, sight-seeing and
getting to know the Mexicans.
The group, accompanied hy Mr.
and Mrs. Ferdinand Christ man,

at a trailer court. Each day a
few people went into town to buy
food, which everyone helped cook.
In Ensenada the group had the
use of a pink Cadillac which could
