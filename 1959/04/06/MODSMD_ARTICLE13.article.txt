# Re-Affirm Role of Individual: Mills
## 
### Dave Quarles 
A reaffirmation of the individ
ual as a moral and responsible
center of decision capable of con
trolling his own fate is the task
of today's cultural workmen,
stated Columbia sociologist C.
Wright Mills in his address Fri

(lay evening in Memorial Audito
rium.
The author of "The Power
Elite" emphasized that the Ameri
can cultural workman or creative
thinker has lost his place in the
leftist tradition of criticism large
ly through bureaucratic control

of cultural production and distri
bution.
"This seizure of control in
cludes government - sponsored
teams of busy semi-intellectuals
participating in semi-official re
search cartels as well as the jour
nalistic lie of mass distraction,"
Mills said.
Re-define Reality
To combat the decline of left
ist criticism, a decline which aids
the bureaucratic thrust toward
World War 111, individuals must
re-define reality and in that light
submit imaginative solutions to
present national and internation
al problems.
"Individuals must put forward
radical critiques and audacious
programs," Mills declared. It is
impossible to leave political think
ing to our two national irrespon
sible parties who never have a
program or discuss the real is
sues.
Mills also blamed the "educated
illiteracy" of the younger genera
tion for throwing away their leg
acy of free criticism. "They are
rational but refuse to reason.
Vulgar Prosperity
"The glorious and vulgar pros
pect of prosperity leads them to
judge society and social justice
by their own personal success.
They cannot psychologically af
ford to confront their politically
subservient position and there
fore retreat into specialization,
relieving themselves of the duty
of political thought," said Mills.
Mills pointed out that the So
viet Union and the United States
have become quite similar since
the nationalization of Commu
nism and the impotency of the
American left.
"There has been no long-stand
ing cultural establishment in ei
ther country. But now the power
of technological development, a
social and cultural fetish, controls
life in both countries."
Education a Victim
In the two countries, claimed
Mills, education is a part of the
economic and military machines.
Students study to fill jobs which,
help ends they cannot control.
Scientism causes methodological
pretension to overshadow socio
logical inquiry.
Although scientists can still
decide what they will and will not
do, many of them have become
blind adherents to national crash
assembly lines and no longer be
long to a field of international ex
ploration, said Mills.
Mills warned that the bureau
cratization of culture and stifling
of ideas in this country may lead
to the conclusion that a cultural
life does not necessitate personal
freedom.

of technological development, a
social and cultural fetish, controls
life in both countries."
Education a Victim
In the two countries, claimed
Mills, education is a part of the
economic and military machines.
Students study to fill jobs which,
help ends they cannot control.
Scientism causes methodological
pretension to overshadow socio
logical inquiry.
Although scientists can still
decide what they will and will not
do, many of them have become
blind adherents to national crash
assembly lines and no longer be
long to a field of international ex
ploration, said Mills.
Mills warned that the bureau
cratization of culture and stifling
of ideas in this country may lead
to the conclusion that a cultural
life does not necessitate personal
freedom.
A reaffirmation of the individ
ual as a moral and responsible
center of decision capable of con
trolling his own fate is the task
of today's cultural workmen,
stated Columbia sociologist C.
Wright Mills in his address Fri

(lay evening in Memorial Audito
rium.
The author of "The Power
Elite" emphasized that the Ameri
can cultural workman or creative
thinker has lost his place in the
leftist tradition of criticism large
ly through bureaucratic control

of cultural production and distri
bution.
"This seizure of control in
cludes government - sponsored
teams of busy semi-intellectuals
participating in semi-official re
search cartels as well as the jour
nalistic lie of mass distraction,"
Mills said.
Re-define Reality
To combat the decline of left
ist criticism, a decline which aids
the bureaucratic thrust toward
World War 111, individuals must
re-define reality and in that light
submit imaginative solutions to
present national and internation
al problems.
"Individuals must put forward
radical critiques and audacious
programs," Mills declared. It is
impossible to leave political think
ing to our two national irrespon
sible parties who never have a
program or discuss the real is
sues.
Mills also blamed the "educated
illiteracy" of the younger genera
tion for throwing away their leg
acy of free criticism. "They are
rational but refuse to reason.
Vulgar Prosperity
"The glorious and vulgar pros
pect of prosperity leads them to
judge society and social justice
by their own personal success.
They cannot psychologically af
ford to confront their politically
subservient position and there
fore retreat into specialization,
relieving themselves of the duty
of political thought," said Mills.
Mills pointed out that the So
viet Union and the United States
have become quite similar since
the nationalization of Commu
nism and the impotency of the
American left.
"There has been no long-stand
ing cultural establishment in ei
ther country. But now the power
of technological development, a
social and cultural fetish, controls
life in both countries."
