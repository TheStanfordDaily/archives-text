# LASSU Commended For Stand on Oaths
## 
### 
Legislature is lo be commended. I hey debated llie problem of
loyalty oaths rationally, intelligently and with sincere concern.
When all arguments were heard and attitudes formulated, they
took their stand firmly, without compromising.
They voiced opposition to the affidavit part of the National
Defense Education Art, which reads: '*1 do solemnly swear that
I do not believe in, and am not a member of and do not support
any organization that believes in or teaches, the overthrow of the
United States Government by force or violence or by any illegal
or unconstitutional methods."
And Legislature went further, opposing the oath segment of
the ad a segment some people consider more tolerant. I his seg
ment reads: '"I do solemnly swear that I will bear true faith and
allegiance to the United States of America and will support and
defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America
against all its enemies, foreign ami domestic.'''
Legislature hesitated only once, with the thought that perhaps
lliey should register their disapproval only as individual students.
They realized this would he almost impossible and went on record
in their official capacity as representing the Stanford student body
against the oath and affidavit.
This matter was taken under consideration by Legislature with
the idea that it might be helpful lo the Administration if the stu
dent position was made known.
That position is now clear. We oppose these oaths. We hope
the Administration's position and course of action will be made
known to the students soon.
