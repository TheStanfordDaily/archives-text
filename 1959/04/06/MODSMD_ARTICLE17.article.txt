# President's Report
## International Stability 
### John Bohn 
"International stability and prog
ress" is perhaps not a subject
strictly appropriate to this col
umn. However, I have just re
turned from the Air Force Acad
emy's Assembly on International
Affairs, and you might be inter
ested in some of the current think
ing among students and adminis
trators across the nation.
The academy itself is a fantas
tic and awesome creation from
1981. There are terrazzo walk
ways wide enough for two squad
rons of men to pass without step
ping on the marble borders.
Each of the two dormitory build
ings has six floors and is one
quarter of a mile long. They are
connected by several shorter
wings so that the over-all struc
ture appears like many "H's"
placed together end over end. A
wide spiral marble staircase as
cends to the library, and the class
rooms have no windows, all the
light, heat and ventilation being
artificially controlled.
The rooms have all the latest
appointments, including walnut
paneling and hot and cold water 1 .
All the buildings have square, reg
ular corners, with huge glass
walls supported by stainless steel
and concrete, and garnished with
expanses of mosaic tile in yellow
and blue. Many other things might
be cited, but the above will give
you the idea.
Two six-hour periods were
spent in panel discussions with
students of widely varied —and,
I may add, of surprisingly good
—backgrounds in international
affairs. The assembly at once
recognized the new force in in
ternational politics —the desire
of underdeveloped countries for
economic growth at almost all
costs, with an inherently un
stable international political sit
uation resulting.
Talking within this framework,
the delegates dealt with many
more specific problems at length,
drawing on special information
made available to them by the
American assembly and the U.S.
Department of State. The respec
tive roles of military and economic

assistance, means of coordination
of such programs and the means
necessary for long-range planning
were among those topics dis
cussed.
Perhaps the most significant
factor manifest during the con
ference was the feeling of un
certainty among the delegates
as to whether the democratic
process was capable of dealing
with the complex problems of
foreign relations. The old ques
tion of efficiency versus respon
sibility cropped up again and
again during discussions of eco
nomic and personnel manage
ment.
This uncertainty was not re
solved, for no one knows the an
swer. But each delegate came
away with a strong desire to make
the democratic system work, even
with all its imperfections.
The banquet speaker, Dr. Henry
Wriston, president of the Ameri
can assembly and a man of vast
experience, charged each citizen
to become as aware as he can of
international affairs—not so much
with the idea of comprehending
the intricacies of administration,
but with an eye to intelligent
chance of responsible and repre
sentative leaders.
The world situation is tense
and explosive, but revolution
and unrest are inherent in new
ly self-conscious countries and
should not be a cause for panic
in U.S. foreign policy. We must
understand the dynamics of
self-determination and remem
ber our own birth as an inde
pendent nation. From knowl
edge, from inspiration and with
an imagination disciplined by
patience, the United States must
continue to support a program
of mutual security and play the
leading role in international |m>l
-
Space docs not permit a more
precise discussion of our deliber
ations. If you are interested in
the details of the report—which
goes from this assembly to the
White House as an expression of
student views on foreign affairs—
either Arden Shenker or I will be
happy to talk with you.
