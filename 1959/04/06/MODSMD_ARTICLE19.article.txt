(Editor's Note: This is the
first of two articles summariz
ing' and detailing the Tibetan
revolt. The second article, an
interview with Kobert North,
associate professor of political
science, w ill discuss Ihe revolt's
implications.

The most unknown and inacces
sible country in the world is today
the scene of a fierce rebellion di
rected against the most populous
modern power.
This conflict is raging in Tibet,
a land of mystery and intrigue,
whose 1,000,000 inhabitants are
striving to overthrow the rule of
Communist China, which for- nine
years has controlled the mountain
ous nation, about twice the size of
Texas.
Although information coming
from Tibet has been hazy and for
the most part unconfirmed due to
the difficulty of communications,
the events of the past three weeks
are now known to the rest of the
world.
The revolt started about March
13 when the Chinese representa
tive in Tibet, Gen. Chang Ching,
summoned the Dalai Lama, spirit
ual leader of the Tibetans, to his
headquarters, supposedly to put
him under arrest. Subsequent
riots by faithful followers of the
Lama, who regard him as the re
incarnation of Buddha, resulted in
his refusal to obey, and touched
off fighting in the streets of
Lhasa, the capital city.
The townspeople were quickly
joined by Khamba tribesmen,
fierce nomads who have been
staging guerrilla warfare against
the Communists for the past year
and who controlled a large area in
southern Tibet. Fighting is still
continuing at present, but the Chi
nese have retaken Lhasa and are
slowly pushing the Khambas back
by weight of numbers, massacring
villagers as they advance.
During the struggle the Dalai
Lama disappeared and was feared
to be harmed, but recent reports
indicate he is now safe in India,
seeking asylum along with many
other Tibetans who fled when the
Chinese countered massively.
The background for the rebel
lion goes back many centuries,
during which China has held a
suzerainty over Tibet —in other
words, a type of feudal relation
ship.
In 1950 the new Communist re
gime of China marched into Tibet

and by treaty established a gov
ernment recognizing the position
of the Dalai Lama and giving the
people a certain amount of au
tonomy. This last point, in the
eyes of the Tibetans, has not been
satisfactorily carried out.
Near the end of last year seri
ous fighting broke out between
the Khambas and the Chinese
trooph stationed in Tibet, and nu
merous incidents have occurred
since then. Reports show that
over 50,000 Chinese and 15,000 Ti
betans have been killed. This num
ber has increased greatly during
the present revolt, but it is impos
sible at this time to make an esti
mate of the casualties.
On March 25, Tibetan leaders

declared independence from China
and denounced the treaty of 1950
on the grounds that there had
been persistent violations by the
Communists. Rumors claim that
over 90 per cent of the country's
population is backing the decree
of independence and resisting the
Chinese efforts.
Although the summons to the
Dalai Lama was the immediate
cause of insurgence, there has
been m u c h discontent brewing
since the Communist invasion as
a result of certain "reforms" that
have been initiated.
There has been an attempt by
the Chinese to modernize this
backward country and break down
the tradition which dates back

hundreds of years. Building roads
and houses, cleaning up the cities
and organizing the work effort
have tended to help the people,
but have been resented because
they destroyed the old order.
Particularly, Chinese efforts to
minimize religion have been de
tested; and here lies, perhaps, the
main cause of dissension, as the
Tibetans are a very religious peo
ple, one - sixth of them be in g
priests.
Also disliked is the mass immi
gration of Chinese settlers, who
are slowly beginning to outnum
ber the native population. The
Communists, unable to pressure
the Tibetans into accepting re
forms, are trying to overcome re
sistance by pushing the natives
into the minority.
China cannot afford to sit by
idly and not crush the uprising.
There would be, of course, the un
favorable psychological and prop l
aganda defeat if Communism
were faced with a setback such as
this. A second disadvantage would
be the repercussions from Mos
cow, which would be fearful of
the effect on its own satellite
countries, where rumblings are
still audible.
The most interesting develop
ments resulting from the Tibetan
situation are those in India, which
borders Tibet and which is trying
to retain its role as a neutral na
tion.
Prime Minister Nehru has re
fused so far to give any condem-

I nation of China for its actions and
lins rejected the many pleas by
native Indians and Tibetans in
! India for his intervention, lie has
! grudgingly agreed to admit some
refugees if the numbers are not
large, but lie still maintains that
j China is the rightful master of
i Tibet and bus been recognized as
! such by the rest of the world,
ihereby making this an internal
affair.
It is interesting to note heit 1
•that the only information about
the rebellion is released from In
dia, whose consulate in Lhasa op
crates a radio transmitter.
Nehru's main worry is that of
antagonizing Red China, particu
larly since China has cast inter
ested, if not longing, looks at In
i dia and its 300 millions.
