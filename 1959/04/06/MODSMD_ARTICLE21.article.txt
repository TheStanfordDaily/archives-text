# Tribe Runners In Track Upset
## 
### 
The Southland drought in track and field ended for Stanford Sat
urday at UCLA amidst a downpour 1 of outstanding performances
and a 72-59 victory over the Bruins.
Prior to Saturday's break-through, Indian fans had to go hack to
a 1954 win over the Bruins to find a win over UCLA, Southern Cal

or Occidental perennially three
of the nation's outstanding spike
powers.
Jerry Winters, Dean Smith,
Bob Monzingo and Don Chesarek
all came through with unexpect
ed victories. Bertil Lundh, Ernie
Cunliffe, John Kelly and Jim
Backstrand all were at their an
ticipated best for the Indians. In
all, 19 of Payton Jordan's 20-man
squad broke into the scoring col
umn.
New Mark at 56-9 Va
Winters' showing was probably
the most surprising. Declared
eligible only hours before the
team flight left for Los Angeles,
Winters let loose with an effort
of 56-9 to crack a meet record
and beat the two favored Uclans.
Winters, who had been in the
54 - 55 - foot range during the
week's practice, sent five of his
seven official throws past the 54-
foot line. The old meet record of
56-5% had been set by Don Vick
of UCLA in 1956.
Not too-sharp performances in
recent meets and predicted third
places against UCLA didn't both
er Smith as he won the 100 in
10.2 and the 220 in 21.4.
Sudden Drive
In the century, run against a
gusty wind, Smith appeared out
of even a second-place finish at 90
yards. But he suddenly pulled up,
cut loose in his final three steps,
and lunged through ahead of Rich
Johnson and then Steve Scott.
The 220 didn't remain in doubt
nearly so long, as Smith broke
away from the field at the 160-
yard mark. Norm Pease drove
hard all the way through the fin
ish to get a hairline decision for
third.
Chesarek's 410 win was his
third straight of the campaign,
fie won driving, and wound up
with a five-yard margin and a
48.5 clocking over Doug Julian.
The Cards' Bob Bess e came
strong in the final yards, and
missed second by .just a yard.
Two for Berlil
Lundh was Stanford's other
double winner. He and Ernie
Cunliffe ran their customary near
dead-heat in the mile, Lundh get
ting the nod in 4:12.8. He re
turned with a 1:52.8 half-mile.
This time, it was Dick Lassen
who pulled down the place points.
A big upset came in the two
mile. where Stanford pulled down
its 66th and winning point. Mon
zingo, hanging on the heels of
UCLA's Ken Ptiding for seven
laps, cut past the favored Bruin
on the next-to-last turn, opened
up a quick eight-yard lead, and
won by an ever-widening margin.
His 9:18.1 knocked nearly ten
seconds off his previous best.

Mon z in go "broke" Riding so
much on the final lap that Doug
Martin came from way back and
just missed nipping the Bruin for
second.
24-9 '4 for Kelly
A new career best also came
for Kelly in the broad jump. He
went 24-9 adding more than
four inches to his previous tops,
and serving notice that he should
be past 25 feet before long.
Backstrand was Stanford's oth
er- individual winner, easily cop
ping the javelin with a throw of
202-6. Jim Korth was second, but
an anticipated Stanford sweep
was knocked out when Skip Face
twisted an ankle and couldn't
make the trip south.
Harlin Limmer also had a best
of-life with his second-place dis
cus effort of 158-1 Vu. A season
topper was turned in by the mile
relay team of Lassen, Norman
Lloyd, Besse and Chesarek when
they combined for a 3:14.2.
