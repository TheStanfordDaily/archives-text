## Indians vs. SJS In Net Showdown 
### 
It will he showdown time this
! afternoon at the Stanford tennis
courts as the recently crowned
I Northern California tennis cham
i pions from San Jose State College
travel to Palo Alto to take on the
lex-champs from Stanford at 2:30.
San Jose wrested the Northern
j California title from the Indians,
j who had held it for the last
three years, in the Northern Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Champion
ships last February and the Spar
tans will be hoping to further
prove their supremacy in today's
dual match.
Stanford, on the other hand,
plans to prove that the results of
February's tournament were
merely a fluke.
If the Indians are to do any
proving, however, they will have
to play their best tennis for the
Spartans boast of two of the top
net players in the Bay Area and a
team with very adequate depth.
Undefeated
The Spartans who are unde
feated in dual competition this
year have in Whitney Reed prob
ably the best player in college ten
nis today, and in Jim Watson
they have still another netter who
is capable of brilliant play. Both
Watson and Reed were finalists
in the recent Northern California
Intereollegiates and to gain their
spots each had to defeat two top
Stanford players. Reed defeated
Stanford's Lowell Carruth and
Dick Ogden and Watson trimmed
the Indians' Dave Nelson and Jim
Jeffries.
Indians Favored
Despite the many San Jose at
tributes Stanford will enter the
match a slight favorite. The main
reason for Stanford's favored
role is the return of both Brooks
Rawlins and Norm Karns to the
Stanford lineup. Neither of the
two played in the tourney that
saw San Jose capture the Indians'
title.
With Rawlins, an honorable
mention AU-American last year,
added to tht singles lineup Stan
ford has probably the best depth
of any college squad.
The Indians could afford to lose
the top two singles matches with
solid players like Lowell Carruth,
Jim Jeffries, Rawlins and Dick
Gould playing the third through
sixth spots.
Besides the depth factor Stan

ford also has greater strength in
doubles than does San Jose. Dave
Nelson and Dick Ogden, Stan
ford's top combo, whipped two of
the Spartans' best duos in Ihe
Northern California tourney. The
Indians vanquished both Watson
and Sharf and Reed and Hill.
Stanford's second doubles team
of Carruth and Jeffries has gone
undefeated in dual competition
this year and is right on the heels
of Nelson and Ogden.
Probable lineups:
Sail Jose: Singles—(l) Reed,
(2) Watson, (3) Sharf, (4)
Hill, (5) Sehaeffer, (6) Nam
ba.
Doubles — (1) Reed Hill, (2)

If the Indians are to do any
proving, however, they will have
to play their best tennis for the
Spartans boast of two of the top
net players in the Bay Area and a
team with very adequate depth.
Undefeated
The Spartans who are unde
feated in dual competition this
year have in Whitney Reed prob
ably the best player in college ten
nis today, and in Jim Watson
they have still another netter who
is capable of brilliant play. Both
Watson and Reed were finalists
in the recent Northern California
Intereollegiates and to gain their
spots each had to defeat two top
Stanford players. Reed defeated
Stanford's Lowell Carruth and
Dick Ogden and Watson trimmed
the Indians' Dave Nelson and Jim
Jeffries.
Indians Favored
Despite the many San Jose at
tributes Stanford will enter the
match a slight favorite. The main
reason for Stanford's favored
role is the return of both Brooks
Rawlins and Norm Karns to the
Stanford lineup. Neither of the
two played in the tourney that
saw San Jose capture the Indians'
title.
With Rawlins, an honorable
mention AU-American last year,
added to tht singles lineup Stan
ford has probably the best depth
of any college squad.
The Indians could afford to lose
the top two singles matches with
solid players like Lowell Carruth,
Jim Jeffries, Rawlins and Dick
Gould playing the third through
sixth spots.
Besides the depth factor Stan

ford also has greater strength in
doubles than does San Jose. Dave
Nelson and Dick Ogden, Stan
ford's top combo, whipped two of
the Spartans' best duos in Ihe
Northern California tourney. The
Indians vanquished both Watson
and Sharf and Reed and Hill.
Stanford's second doubles team
of Carruth and Jeffries has gone
undefeated in dual competition
this year and is right on the heels
of Nelson and Ogden.
Probable lineups:
Sail Jose: Singles—(l) Reed,
(2) Watson, (3) Sharf, (4)
