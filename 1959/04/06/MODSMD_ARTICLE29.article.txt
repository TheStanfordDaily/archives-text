# Card Nine Splits in Two Non-Conference Games
## 
### 
Fine pitching performances,
one by San Jose State's Bill Leach
and another by Stanford's Terry
Lindeman, dominated the Cards'
baseball weekend — and resulted
in one win and one loss for Coach
Dutch Fehring's Tribe.
Friday night in San Jose, the
Indians were set down, 4-0, by
Leach and the Spartans. Satur
day, they rebounded for a 5-1 tri
umph over Sacramento State at
the Sunken Diamond as Linde
man notched his fourth win with
a fine five-hitter.
C OP Next
This week the Cards meet Col
lege of the Pacific tomorrow in
another non-conference game and
Friday and Saturday take on un
defeated Sania Clara.
The rampaging Broncos and de
fending NCAA champion South
ern California moved into first
place in the CIBA with Stanford
by scoring double wins over the
weekend.
Leach Brilliant
In last week's action, San Jose's
Leach turned in the second
straight brilliant pitching show
against the Tribe by a Spartan
moundsman. Last month Dick
Holden had blanked the Indians
with a one-hitter.
Sophomore Earl Russell and
left-hander Marv Mecklenburg, a
spring quarter transfer from San
Jose City College, hurled good
ball for Stanford, but couldn't
match Leach.
Wild Seventh
Saturday, the Tribe wrapped
up the win with two second-in
ning runs—and added three more

for good measure in a wild sev
enth frame.
In the second, shortstop Hal
Sehut/mann started festivities by
reaching base on an error. Cen
terfielder Harry Rodda then
looped a double into short center
and catcher Jay Winter followed
willi a single to drive home both
runs.
