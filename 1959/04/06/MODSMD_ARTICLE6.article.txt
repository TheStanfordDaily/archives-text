The largest item to go was the
proposed s a n d stone v en e e r
around the bookstore's columns
costing $40,188.
The price breakdown now is
$325,628 for the store and $161,-
951 for the post office.
Not Ready for Fall
The contracted date for com
pletion of construction is Oct. 6.
The store will thus not be open
for the start of fall quarter.
Construction was held up last
quarter because officials found
that costs were going to be higher
than anticipated. New bids were
offered and the University accept
ed that of Howard White of Palo
Alto.
As soon as Ihe post office
agreed to the terms, construction
began.
The new store will have one
main floor and a second-story bal
cony. The departments will re
main the same in kind but will
be enlarged.
Self-Scrviee Policy
Two innovations will be a self
service policy and a large con
trolled parking area behind the
store.
The post office will be twice as
big as the present one.
The University will pay the cost
with endowment money and rent
the buildings to the Bookstore
Corporation and the Post Office
Department. These organizations
are expected to repay the cost to
the University in 25 to 30 years.
