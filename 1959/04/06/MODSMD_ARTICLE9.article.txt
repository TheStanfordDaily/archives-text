# HOOVER MEETING
## Nationalism Considered By Slavic Conference 
### 
Nationalism and Communism with its international manifestations
in Asian and Slavic countries was discussed in a Far Western Slavic
Conference Friday, Saturday and yesterday at the Hoover Institution.
This second annual conference included many professionally quali
fied speakers and participants and covered many topics during the

five sessions.
Friday a panel of reporters and
interpreters of events expressed
opinions on what the people need
to know about nationalism and
Communism. Jack Beck of CBS
News emphasized that there must
he "more cerebral and loss emo
tional reaction to Communism."
Nationalism Necessary
Saturday sessions concerned
j more specific topics. The morn
! ing session was on "Nationalism
j in Russia and Eastern Europe."
| The participants agreed that na
tionalism, whether good or bad,
is always necessary in certain
stages in the growth and develop
ment of counlries.
The afternoon session consisted
! of topics on nationalism and Com
munism in Communist state poli
cies. The general conclusions
were that national self-determina
tion underlies new Soviet foreign
policy and that the trend in post
war Eastern Europe is toward
homogeneity instead of the large
minority population.
A final point in this session was
that the Russification in culture
is not as great as one might ex
pect. There is an increase in
Westernization in all of the arts.
Ideology Varies
Communism and Eastern Euro
pean nationalisms was the topic
of the Saturday evening session.
Communism varies in ideology as
well as in practice: In the nation
al form of socialism, the nature
of ownership and the nature of
the party differ from other for ms.
There is a general dislike of
bourgeois nationalism.
The final session Sunday morn
ing concerned the tpoic "Commu
nism and Asian Nationalisms."
Several points were emphasized,
among them the potency of Com
munism as an ideology in India
and pan-Arab unity and social re
form stressing a common heri
tage and the subjection of the in
dividual to the group and social
solidarity.
