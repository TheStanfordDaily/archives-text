# THROUGH SUEZ
## Soviet Ship, Armed Kurds Bound for Iraq 
### 
Egyptian authorities in Port
Said reported a Soviet ship with
855 fully armed men of Kurdish
origin sailed through the Suez
Canal Monday night, bound for
turbulent Iraq. Such a landing
would raise a new and significant
Communist threat in the sensitive
oil-producing areas of the Middle
East.
The report passed through the
censorship of Egypt, now en
gaged in a violent propaganda
war with Iraq. The sketchy ac
count provided few details. But
if the report is true, it could fore
token a new cold war explosion
over the Middle East.
Kurdish Origin
Observers in Port Said de
scribed the armed men aboard the
Soviet ship Gruzia (Georgia) as
Soviet subjects of Kurdish origin.
There are many Kurds in the
southernmost regions of the So
viet. Union.
The same sources said they be
lieved the Kurds were being ship
ped to Basra, Iraq's main Persian
Gulf port, under a pretext of be
ing repatriated to their country
of origin. They would be given
Iraq nationality immediately
upon their arrival, possibly for
use as soldiers in the armed
forces of leftist Premier Abdel
Karim Kassem, the sources add
ed.
Iraq Foreign Legion
This report follows accounts in
Ihe press of the United Arab Re
public (Egypt and Syria) that
Iraq's Premier Kassc m had
formed foreign legion units to en
roll non-Iraqis for a fight against
pan-Arab nationalist followers of
the U.A.R.'s leader, President Ga
mal Abdel Nasser.
