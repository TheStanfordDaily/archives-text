# 'A USABLE PAST'
## Commager Traces Growth Of American Nationhood 
### Diana Smith, Managing Editor 
Henry Steel Commager talked to his Memorial Auditorium audi
ence yesterday afternoon of how Americans sought a usable common
past in the early years following the announcement of their nation
hood, a past such as generally supports a nationalism.
"There were, in fact, many courses open to them. With character-

istic energy, Americans took all
of them at once."
First, Commager cited faith in
the future—in Emerson's phrase,
"all has an onward and prospec
tive look"—but the American his
torian added that the race of sec
tional disintegration with nation
al consolidation was at times a
close one, despite the nation
builders' optimism.
Another of Americans' pros
pects in "The Search for a Usable
Past" was to borrow from the
whole heritage of Western civili
zation. Americans did this also—
and until recently, as Commager
described it, with a "new world
innocence, old world corruption"
attitude.
Speedily
But for the most pari Ameri
cans used for a past what they
had, Commager went on, speedily
providing heroes, memory, monu
ments, symbols, ballads, shrines
and the rest of the paraphernalia
of a "venerable fabric."
"It is still astounding that
Americans managed to fill their
historical canvass as elaborately
as they did, as artistically as they
did, and as rapidly as they did."
Commager discussed two of
the factors which were important
in the search for a usable past.
First, nature: it has been cher
ished and challenged. Americans,

Commager explained, view na
ture as an attribute of their past;
they take pride in the gift of it;
and in the conquest of it, but pre
fer it "plain," and do not, as Eu
ropeans do, look at nature in
terms of the history associated
with it.
Changing People
He commented next, upon the
need for continual "moderniza
tion" of the American past for the
use of an ever new and changing
people, observing that the in
instruction of newcomers in the
traditions of the nation has often
resulted in a "conspicuous patrio
tism."
The usable American past as
we know il. Commager felt, was
for the most part completed by
1863; only the settler vs. Indian
and the railroad and lumbering
episodes joined the saga later.
Usable Past
For the shaping of a usable
past, Commager gave consider
able credit to the 1815-40 literary
generation, whose dramatization
of the New England and New
York legends he called an impor
tant achievement. He asserted
that their themes were not sub
stantially added to until the com
ing of a literature of the West.

tional disintegration with nation
al consolidation was at times a
close one, despite the nation
builders' optimism.
Another of Americans' pros
pects in "The Search for a Usable
Past" was to borrow from the
whole heritage of Western civili
zation. Americans did this also—
and until recently, as Commager
described it, with a "new world
innocence, old world corruption"
attitude.
Speedily
But for the most pari Ameri
cans used for a past what they
had, Commager went on, speedily
providing heroes, memory, monu
ments, symbols, ballads, shrines
and the rest of the paraphernalia
of a "venerable fabric."
"It is still astounding that
Americans managed to fill their
historical canvass as elaborately
as they did, as artistically as they
did, and as rapidly as they did."
Commager discussed two of
the factors which were important
in the search for a usable past.
First, nature: it has been cher
ished and challenged. Americans,

Commager explained, view na
ture as an attribute of their past;
they take pride in the gift of it;
and in the conquest of it, but pre
fer it "plain," and do not, as Eu
ropeans do, look at nature in
terms of the history associated
with it.
Changing People
He commented next, upon the
need for continual "moderniza
tion" of the American past for the
use of an ever new and changing
people, observing that the in
instruction of newcomers in the
traditions of the nation has often
resulted in a "conspicuous patrio
tism."
The usable American past as
we know il. Commager felt, was
for the most part completed by
1863; only the settler vs. Indian
and the railroad and lumbering
episodes joined the saga later.
Usable Past
For the shaping of a usable
past, Commager gave consider
able credit to the 1815-40 literary
generation, whose dramatization
of the New England and New
York legends he called an impor
tant achievement. He asserted
that their themes were not sub
stantially added to until the com
ing of a literature of the West.

Henry Steel Commager talked to his Memorial Auditorium audi
ence yesterday afternoon of how Americans sought a usable common
past in the early years following the announcement of their nation
hood, a past such as generally supports a nationalism.
"There were, in fact, many courses open to them. With character-

istic energy, Americans took all
of them at once."
First, Commager cited faith in
the future—in Emerson's phrase,
"all has an onward and prospec
tive look"—but the American his
torian added that the race of sec
tional disintegration with nation
al consolidation was at times a
close one, despite the nation
builders' optimism.
