## Two Germanys and Berlin 
### 
(Editor's Note: Walter Lipp
mann has just returned from
Europe, where be took a first
band look at the Berlin crisis.
This is the first article of a
report on the situation.)
In a moment like this, when
momentous negotiations are about
to begin, the press must try to tell
the truth without disclosing legiti
mate secrets. How is it to do this
and keep faith both with officials
who have spoken plainly off the
record and with its readers who
have a right to know?
"What are "legitimate secrets?"
For a rough and ready answer to
this most important and compli
cated question, 1 would start with
a remark made to me by a man
who had quite lecently had a long
and free-swinging bout with Mr.
K. about the German question.
"You Americans do not always
understand," he said, "that the
game which is being played over
Berlin and Germany is not poker
but chess. In this game each play
er sees what pieces the other one
has, and there is no bluffing about
them. What is unknown is how
each side will play his pieces."
Beside the need for some se
crecy which is inherent in almost
all negotiations, there is another
element in the present situation
which makes ii difficult to re
port it.
This is the fact that Western
policy on the German question,

as officially proclaimed during'
the past 10 years, no longer rep
resents the real expectations
and practical hopes of the prin
cipal western European govern
ments.
They do not say it, but Ihey
have come to know that the two
Germanys cannot be "reunited in
freedom," that is to say by liqui
dating the Communist regime in
East Germany.
Very important from the point
of view of Western policy are
the coming West German elec
tions in 1961; for if it trans
pires that the reunification of
Germany lias been postponed in
definitely, and is for all prac
tical purposes no more than a
dim and distant ideal, there is a
fair chance that Dr. Adenauer
might be defeated by a coalition
made up of those who put Ger
man unity above all o the r
things.
This could lead to a profound
alteration of the whole west Eu
ropean position.
This, in any event, is the night
mare of the west European gov
ernments, and it is a compelling
reason why they shrink from any
open recognition of the fact that
there are now, and will long con
tinue to he, two Germanys. They
are afraid that Dr. Adenauer's po
sition in West Germany is not
strong enough to withstand the
shock of such a recognition.

Very important from the point
of view of Western policy are
the coming West German elec
tions in 1961; for if it trans
pires that the reunification of
Germany lias been postponed in
definitely, and is for all prac
tical purposes no more than a
dim and distant ideal, there is a
fair chance that Dr. Adenauer
might be defeated by a coalition
made up of those who put Ger
man unity above all o the r
things.
This could lead to a profound
alteration of the whole west Eu
ropean position.
This, in any event, is the night
mare of the west European gov
ernments, and it is a compelling
reason why they shrink from any
open recognition of the fact that
there are now, and will long con
tinue to he, two Germanys. They
are afraid that Dr. Adenauer's po
sition in West Germany is not
strong enough to withstand the
shock of such a recognition.

Europe, where be took a first
band look at the Berlin crisis.
This is the first article of a
report on the situation.)
In a moment like this, when
momentous negotiations are about
to begin, the press must try to tell
the truth without disclosing legiti
mate secrets. How is it to do this
and keep faith both with officials
who have spoken plainly off the
record and with its readers who
have a right to know?
"What are "legitimate secrets?"
For a rough and ready answer to
this most important and compli
cated question, 1 would start with
a remark made to me by a man
who had quite lecently had a long
and free-swinging bout with Mr.
K. about the German question.
"You Americans do not always
understand," he said, "that the
game which is being played over
Berlin and Germany is not poker
but chess. In this game each play
er sees what pieces the other one
has, and there is no bluffing about
them. What is unknown is how
each side will play his pieces."
Beside the need for some se
crecy which is inherent in almost
all negotiations, there is another
element in the present situation
which makes ii difficult to re
port it.
This is the fact that Western
policy on the German question,

as officially proclaimed during'
the past 10 years, no longer rep
resents the real expectations
and practical hopes of the prin
cipal western European govern
ments.
They do not say it, but Ihey
have come to know that the two
Germanys cannot be "reunited in
freedom," that is to say by liqui
dating the Communist regime in
East Germany.
