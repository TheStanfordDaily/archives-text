# This Point of View
## Further Comment on Oaths 
### Chuck Shuken Member, Legislature 
The Stanford student has re
turned to the University to be
greeted by lovely weather, sun
tanned coeds in spring cottons,
glistening beaches and thoughts
of summer plans.
Once again out of the gloom has
arisen an "important" controversy
as an additional harbinger of
spring. The federal government
has made available to institutions
of higher learning certain funds
to be used as loans to -students.
Eligibility for these loans requires
that the applicant sign a "loyalty"
oath and a "loyalty" affidavit.
This portion of the National De
fense Act of 1958 is considered by
some individuals to represent a
violation of the rights of the indi
vidual, a threat to freedom of edu
cation, an indirect accusation of
disloyalty and an unfair way to
set up citizens for future prosecu
tion for perjury.
Oath of Honor
Here at Stanford we have a sim
ilar procedure. We take a new
oath in writing to uphold the Stan
ford Honor Code each quarter as
we register or take an exam.
We reaffirm our intentions to
uphold the code whether we have
so vowed in the past or whether
we have no intentions of taking
such oath seriously; yet this has
not aroused any great, emotional
activity against the Honor Code
an established institution at Stan
ford.
Is there any doubt that "loyalty"
is an American institution? Peri
odic reminders of these things can
not produce any noticeable harm!
The Legislature of the Associ
ated Students pronounced an opin
ion in regard to these oaths. Dur
ing the discussion in the meeting
of April 2, I made several state
ments. The Daily has purported
to summarize, quote, or whatever
they do to what people «ay, these
comments and print them.
I admit there were several long
sentences that included dependent
clauses, words of three or more
syllables and other confusing de
vices. The Daily attributed to me
a statement that is obviously con
tradictory to my feelings on the
subject.
A casual reading of The Daily's
statement of my statement indi
cates that I am opposed to the

National Defense Act loyalty oath.
On the contrary, I do not feel re
pulsion to the efforts of our gov
ernment to secure a certain type
of individual as the recipient of
its loans.
The intent of the provisions of
the act that apply to us within the
seldom breached walls of an aca
demic institution is to aid in the
education of citizens who, through
that aid, shall be better citizens
and better able to contribute to
the unquestionably present prob
lem of national defense.
The National Defense Act of
1958, therefore, for student loans
requires loyalty clauses similar to
those that are encountered in ap
plying for a passport, obtaining a
job with the government or with
a private company that does de
fense work for the U.S. govern
ment, entering the armed services
and acquiring a commission in the
armed services.
It is difficult to comprehend
why the people who were most
vociferous in their demands for
federal aid to education are now
also the loudest critics of federal
aid to education.
Will these oaths disrupt the ed
ucational processes that we tradi
tionally call democratic in the
ways that the McCarthy "witch
hunts" violated our feelings of dig
nity of the individual and freedom
of thought? Of course not.
Prevent Advocacy
Were The Daily to publish the
oath in its entirety, the attentive
reader would realize that the oath
will prevent the advocacy of vio
lent overthrowal of the govern
ment but not the teaching and un
derstanding of assorted political
theories.
It may bo that The Daily care
fully misquoted opponents of the
resolution in anticipation of exten
sion and continuation of the dis
cussion. Anyway, this commenta
tor is sure that it will now drag
out several weeks or more, until
the authors of letters to the editor
shall have either exhausted them
selves in rhetoric or strangled in
venom.
Though I am now a party to one
of the periodic "campus contro
versies," I hope it i« no less enter
taining than those in the past, and
that it relieves the writing staff
of The Daily from overwork equal
ly as well as in the past.
