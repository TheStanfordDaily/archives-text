# Tibetan Revolt Will Effect Asia's Future

### Steve Freidberg 
According to Robert C. North,
associate professor of political
science at Stanford, the implica
tions of the rebellion for India
and other parts of Asia are very
great, even though not imme
diate.
"It is difficult for us in the
United States to realize how deep
ly hostile feelings against the
West are rooted in the former
Asian colonies," he said. "There
is a deep, traumatic hurt against
imperialism in Asia."
North indicated that actions by
(he West, interpreted in Asia as
imperialistic, are remembered
much longer than an action by
Russia or China. He used as an
example the McCarthy hearings
which were quite publicized in
India, but relatively little was said
about McCarthy's decline for a
long time.
"The West has been looked on
as imperialistic until now, and
Communism has been the eham
pion against it,"he commented.
"However, the Chinese actions in
Tibet are very close to imperial
istic behavior."
He doubted that all the Indians
see the Tibet situation as internal
in regard to China as does Nehru
and pointed out attacks in Indian
newspapers against Nehru's
stand. However, lie did stress
that the newspapers do not repre
sent a large percentage of the
population and that in many vil
lages the feeling for Communism
is quite strong.
Turning to the revolt itself,
North declined to make generali
zations since so little is known
and confirmed about the situa
tion. He did say he doubted that
I he Chinese Empire will crumble
because of the revolt and thought

that the result Is probably inevi
table, with the Chinese willing to
turn Tibet into a kind of Asian
Hungary if necessary.
"The West's action should be to
remain silent," he said. "It would
be a mistake for the West to say
anything. Let the protest come
from Asia. Above all, we should
refrain from an 'I told you so' at
titude.
"A protest from the West
would give the impression of in
terfering and might deflect Asian
criticism of China rather than
strengthen it."
