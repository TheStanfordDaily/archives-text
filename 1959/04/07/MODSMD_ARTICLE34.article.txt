# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
Now Ihe Test Begins
For oncc, if was a real pleasure to be wrong. I'm referring to a
dope sheet which ran in Friday's Daily, and which totaled up to an
expected 77-54 victory by I ( I,A over the Stanford runners, jumpers
and throwers Saturday in West wood. But, happily to report, by late
afternoon Saturday, 18 more points had shifted to to Indian column
and the Tribe had its first victory over a Southland track power since
1954.
Now, of course, the big question is whether the ice is broken for
good, or if i< is just a temporary thaw in the middle of a long winter.
Since coming to Stanford in the fall of 19r f j, Pay ton Jordan has
worked hard to lift the caliber of track and field here. By looking
at marks over the past two and one-half seasons and by noting the
many new school records or additions to the top ten which have gone
into the books, it's evident that he has enjoyed a good measure of
success.
But despite Ihe big boost in individual performances, there had
continued until Saturday a long string of team defeats at the hands
of 1(1 A, I!SC and Occidental, plus none-too-good showings against
C'al. In 1957 5S Stanford lost eight meets to these schools.
The Indians came close sometimes, and they were thoroughly
stomped other times. But no matter how close they came on some
occasions, the point or come-through performance that would turn
the tide never quite materialized.
As the individual performances got better and better and it
seemed to become only a problem of putting them together into one
meet, the notion grew that if and when the one big victory came, the
Indians would establish themselves. Jordan has maintained that one
tough upset would boost confidence and desire enough so that Stan
ford could take its place with the other outstanding track teams of
the nation.
Now that the first "big one" has come, the real test begins the
test of whether' JordaiiH' now-tight-knit group can retain the confi
dence and attitude to go along with its already-established natural
abilities.
Speaking from the inside angle, Jordan thinks his Indians will
slay up. "They've finally seen that track is worth the 100 per cent
effort," he says. Stanford's "so what?" attitude and the feeling that
once you're in the lineup, it doesn't really matter if the effort is
complete appear to have finally faded out of the track picture here.
Stanford supporters the real ones want to believe that a 100
per cent track team is here to stay. And I certainly hope and want
to believe it. too. But all the conjecture in the world isn't going 1o
answer the question.
The answer will come only from the stopwatch, tape measure and
meet summaries from now on in.
< >ii Broad Jumping
One Tribesman whose come-throughs are so routine that he some
times doesn't get the mention he deserves is John Kelly. His per
formance Saturday was typical.
After six jumps, Kelly led in the broad jump at just under 21
feet. With the lows coming up, Jordan figured it would be best for
his star to get a quick rub-down and by-pass his last jump. So what
happens but James Johnson goes 24-1 and snaps away the lead.
Panic? Not Kelly. He came off the rubbing table, went over to the
broad jump pit, and calmly made the best jump of his life—2l-9!i.
P.S. He also picked up his point in the lows.
Speaking of broad-jumping, it looks as if the final PCO meet of
all lime is going to feature some of the best. Kelly sounds tops at
2-1-9'4. but he's only third on a strict distance basis. G'ebron Ituss,
the highly-touted Cal soph, went 25-1 against San Jose and Darrell
Horn, an Oregon State soph, improved his last year's mark a foot
and one-half to 25-5% in winning at the Northern Division Relays.
Throw in Luther Hayes of USC, who should be in the high 2-I's by
meet time, and it begins to look as if Jackie Robinson's PCC mark
of 25 feet will at last be wiped off the books.
Other marks from north of the state line indicate that the four
California schools will have to hustle. For example: Steve Frye of
Washington State threw the shot: sfi-6?i, second in the conference
only to Jerry Winters' 56-9 U.
Another Cougar, Walt Arlt, has run 14.5 in the highs, not bad for
this stage of the game. Or there's Frank Wyatt's 9:18.7. The Idaho
Englishman could be tough with another month under his belt.
Terry Tobacco is back at Washington, too. He's only won the 410
title the past two years.

Looking ahead to April 18, the best triangular meet in the West
this year looks io be in the making when Stanford hosts USC and
Oregon on Ihe Stadium oval. This meet will be a morning affair j
(at 10) in order Ihat Bay Area track nuts will have time to whip up
to Berkeley for the Cal-UCLA battle. This same type of morning- ;
afternoon twin-bill was successfully carried off in L.A. last weekend,
when CSC and Oxy met prior to the Stanford-UCLA meet.
And don't forget this Saturday at 1 p.m.—the initial post big vie- ;
tory lest for the maybe-newly-found Jordan men against Fresno State.

to Berkeley for the Cal-UCLA battle. This same type of morning- ;
afternoon twin-bill was successfully carried off in L.A. last weekend,
when CSC and Oxy met prior to the Stanford-UCLA meet.
And don't forget this Saturday at 1 p.m.—the initial post big vie- ;
tory lest for the maybe-newly-found Jordan men against Fresno State.

Now Ihe Test Begins
For oncc, if was a real pleasure to be wrong. I'm referring to a
dope sheet which ran in Friday's Daily, and which totaled up to an
expected 77-54 victory by I ( I,A over the Stanford runners, jumpers
and throwers Saturday in West wood. But, happily to report, by late
afternoon Saturday, 18 more points had shifted to to Indian column
and the Tribe had its first victory over a Southland track power since
1954.
Now, of course, the big question is whether the ice is broken for
good, or if i< is just a temporary thaw in the middle of a long winter.
Since coming to Stanford in the fall of 19r f j, Pay ton Jordan has
worked hard to lift the caliber of track and field here. By looking
at marks over the past two and one-half seasons and by noting the
many new school records or additions to the top ten which have gone
into the books, it's evident that he has enjoyed a good measure of
success.
But despite Ihe big boost in individual performances, there had
continued until Saturday a long string of team defeats at the hands
of 1(1 A, I!SC and Occidental, plus none-too-good showings against
C'al. In 1957 5S Stanford lost eight meets to these schools.
The Indians came close sometimes, and they were thoroughly
stomped other times. But no matter how close they came on some
occasions, the point or come-through performance that would turn
the tide never quite materialized.
As the individual performances got better and better and it
seemed to become only a problem of putting them together into one
meet, the notion grew that if and when the one big victory came, the
Indians would establish themselves. Jordan has maintained that one
tough upset would boost confidence and desire enough so that Stan
ford could take its place with the other outstanding track teams of
the nation.
Now that the first "big one" has come, the real test begins the
test of whether' JordaiiH' now-tight-knit group can retain the confi
dence and attitude to go along with its already-established natural
abilities.
Speaking from the inside angle, Jordan thinks his Indians will
slay up. "They've finally seen that track is worth the 100 per cent
effort," he says. Stanford's "so what?" attitude and the feeling that
once you're in the lineup, it doesn't really matter if the effort is
complete appear to have finally faded out of the track picture here.
Stanford supporters the real ones want to believe that a 100
per cent track team is here to stay. And I certainly hope and want
to believe it. too. But all the conjecture in the world isn't going 1o
answer the question.
The answer will come only from the stopwatch, tape measure and
meet summaries from now on in.
< >ii Broad Jumping
One Tribesman whose come-throughs are so routine that he some
times doesn't get the mention he deserves is John Kelly. His per
formance Saturday was typical.
After six jumps, Kelly led in the broad jump at just under 21
feet. With the lows coming up, Jordan figured it would be best for
his star to get a quick rub-down and by-pass his last jump. So what
happens but James Johnson goes 24-1 and snaps away the lead.
Panic? Not Kelly. He came off the rubbing table, went over to the
broad jump pit, and calmly made the best jump of his life—2l-9!i.
P.S. He also picked up his point in the lows.
Speaking of broad-jumping, it looks as if the final PCO meet of
all lime is going to feature some of the best. Kelly sounds tops at
2-1-9'4. but he's only third on a strict distance basis. G'ebron Ituss,
the highly-touted Cal soph, went 25-1 against San Jose and Darrell
Horn, an Oregon State soph, improved his last year's mark a foot
and one-half to 25-5% in winning at the Northern Division Relays.
Throw in Luther Hayes of USC, who should be in the high 2-I's by
meet time, and it begins to look as if Jackie Robinson's PCC mark
of 25 feet will at last be wiped off the books.
Other marks from north of the state line indicate that the four
California schools will have to hustle. For example: Steve Frye of
Washington State threw the shot: sfi-6?i, second in the conference
only to Jerry Winters' 56-9 U.
Another Cougar, Walt Arlt, has run 14.5 in the highs, not bad for
this stage of the game. Or there's Frank Wyatt's 9:18.7. The Idaho
Englishman could be tough with another month under his belt.
Terry Tobacco is back at Washington, too. He's only won the 410
title the past two years.

Looking ahead to April 18, the best triangular meet in the West
this year looks io be in the making when Stanford hosts USC and
Oregon on Ihe Stadium oval. This meet will be a morning affair j
(at 10) in order Ihat Bay Area track nuts will have time to whip up
to Berkeley for the Cal-UCLA battle. This same type of morning- ;
afternoon twin-bill was successfully carried off in L.A. last weekend,
when CSC and Oxy met prior to the Stanford-UCLA meet.
And don't forget this Saturday at 1 p.m.—the initial post big vie- ;
tory lest for the maybe-newly-found Jordan men against Fresno State.

Now Ihe Test Begins
For oncc, if was a real pleasure to be wrong. I'm referring to a
dope sheet which ran in Friday's Daily, and which totaled up to an
expected 77-54 victory by I ( I,A over the Stanford runners, jumpers
and throwers Saturday in West wood. But, happily to report, by late
afternoon Saturday, 18 more points had shifted to to Indian column
and the Tribe had its first victory over a Southland track power since
1954.
Now, of course, the big question is whether the ice is broken for
good, or if i< is just a temporary thaw in the middle of a long winter.
Since coming to Stanford in the fall of 19r f j, Pay ton Jordan has
worked hard to lift the caliber of track and field here. By looking
at marks over the past two and one-half seasons and by noting the
many new school records or additions to the top ten which have gone
into the books, it's evident that he has enjoyed a good measure of
success.
But despite Ihe big boost in individual performances, there had
continued until Saturday a long string of team defeats at the hands
of 1(1 A, I!SC and Occidental, plus none-too-good showings against
C'al. In 1957 5S Stanford lost eight meets to these schools.
The Indians came close sometimes, and they were thoroughly
stomped other times. But no matter how close they came on some
occasions, the point or come-through performance that would turn
the tide never quite materialized.
As the individual performances got better and better and it
seemed to become only a problem of putting them together into one
meet, the notion grew that if and when the one big victory came, the
Indians would establish themselves. Jordan has maintained that one
tough upset would boost confidence and desire enough so that Stan
ford could take its place with the other outstanding track teams of
the nation.
Now that the first "big one" has come, the real test begins the
test of whether' JordaiiH' now-tight-knit group can retain the confi
dence and attitude to go along with its already-established natural
abilities.
Speaking from the inside angle, Jordan thinks his Indians will
slay up. "They've finally seen that track is worth the 100 per cent
effort," he says. Stanford's "so what?" attitude and the feeling that
once you're in the lineup, it doesn't really matter if the effort is
complete appear to have finally faded out of the track picture here.
Stanford supporters the real ones want to believe that a 100
per cent track team is here to stay. And I certainly hope and want
to believe it. too. But all the conjecture in the world isn't going 1o
answer the question.
The answer will come only from the stopwatch, tape measure and
meet summaries from now on in.
< >ii Broad Jumping
One Tribesman whose come-throughs are so routine that he some
times doesn't get the mention he deserves is John Kelly. His per
formance Saturday was typical.
After six jumps, Kelly led in the broad jump at just under 21
feet. With the lows coming up, Jordan figured it would be best for
his star to get a quick rub-down and by-pass his last jump. So what
happens but James Johnson goes 24-1 and snaps away the lead.
Panic? Not Kelly. He came off the rubbing table, went over to the
broad jump pit, and calmly made the best jump of his life—2l-9!i.
P.S. He also picked up his point in the lows.
Speaking of broad-jumping, it looks as if the final PCO meet of
all lime is going to feature some of the best. Kelly sounds tops at
2-1-9'4. but he's only third on a strict distance basis. G'ebron Ituss,
the highly-touted Cal soph, went 25-1 against San Jose and Darrell
Horn, an Oregon State soph, improved his last year's mark a foot
and one-half to 25-5% in winning at the Northern Division Relays.
Throw in Luther Hayes of USC, who should be in the high 2-I's by
meet time, and it begins to look as if Jackie Robinson's PCC mark
of 25 feet will at last be wiped off the books.
Other marks from north of the state line indicate that the four
California schools will have to hustle. For example: Steve Frye of
Washington State threw the shot: sfi-6?i, second in the conference
only to Jerry Winters' 56-9 U.
Another Cougar, Walt Arlt, has run 14.5 in the highs, not bad for
this stage of the game. Or there's Frank Wyatt's 9:18.7. The Idaho
Englishman could be tough with another month under his belt.
Terry Tobacco is back at Washington, too. He's only won the 410
