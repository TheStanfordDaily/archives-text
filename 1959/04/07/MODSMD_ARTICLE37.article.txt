### John Schwarz 
With the help of five singles
victories Stanford's varsity ten
nis team regained their hold on
Northern California tennis su
premacy by dumping San Jose
State 7-2 in a dual match.
The second through fifth sin
gles player's for Stanford, Dick
Ogden, Lowell Car ruth, Brooks
Rawlins, Jim Jeffries and Dick
Gould, respectively, all won their
matches to help unseat the Spar
tans from the top spot in North
ern California—a spot which they
won in the NorCal meet.
Straight Setters
All of Stanford's singles wins i
were in straight sets except Og
den's victory over Jim Watson.
This three-setter', however, proved
to be a key to the match. Stan
ford's Dave Nelson, although
playing his best tennis of the cur
rent campaign, had been dumped
by powerful Whitney Reed and
at the same time Lowell Carruth 1
of Stanford had tied the score by !
defeating San Jose's Nick Sharf. j
Ogden, down a set, suddenly
caught fire and rolled over Wat
son giving the Indians a load they ;
never relinquished.
In losing the first set Ogden <
looked off form but in the second j
set the Stanfordite began pouring |
on the steam with several great ,
placements and got continually
stronger as he went along.
Doubles Action
The doubles action produced
some encouraging notes when
Stanford's third doubles team of
Rawlins and Norm Karns, play
ing in the number two spot yes
terday, completely dominated
their match with San Jose's Nick j
Sharf and Jim Watson.
