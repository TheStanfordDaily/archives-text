HOW TO BE A
THUMPING BIG SUCCESS ON CAMPUS
While up in the attic last week hiding from tlie tax man, T came
across a letter, yellow with age, that dear old Dad had sent me
when I was a freshman. I reproduce it below in the hope that
it may light your way as it did mine.
"Dear Ron, (Dad always called me Son. This was short for
Sonnenberg, which used to be my first name. I traded it last
year with a man named Max. He threw in two outfielders and
a left-handed pitcher ... But I digress.) \
"Dear Son, (Dad wrote)
"I suppose you are finding college very big and bewildering,
and maybe a little frightening too. Well, it need not be that way
if you will follow a few simple rules.
"First of all, ft' you have any problems, take them to your
teachers. They want to help you. That's what the)- are there for.
Perhaps they seem a little aloof, but that is only because they
are so busy. You will find your teachers warm as toast and
friendly as pups if you will call on them at an hour when thoy
are not overly busy. Four a.m., for instance.
"Second, learn to budget your time. What with classes, activi
ties, studying, and social life all competing for your time, it is
easy to fall into sloppy habits. Set up a rigid schedule and -lick
to it. Remember, there are only 24 hours a day. Three of these
hours must be spent in class. For every hour in class you must,
of course, spend two hours studying. So there go six more
hours. Then, as we all know, for every hour studying, you must
spend two hours sleeping. This accounts for twelve more hours.
Then there are meals—three hours each for breakfast and lunch,
four hours for dinner. Never forget, Sonnenberg, you must
chew each mouthful twelve hundred times. You show me a
backward student, and I'll show you u man who bolts his food.

"But college is morp than just sleeping, eating, and studying.
There arc also many interesting activities which you must not
miss. You'll want to give at least three hours a day to the campus
newspaper, and, of course, another three hours each 1<> the
dramatic and music clubs. And let's say a total of eight hours
daily to the stamp club, the debating club, and the foreign
affairs club. Then, of course, nine or ten hours for fencing and
bird-walking, and another ten or twelve for ceramics and three
card monte.
"Finally we come to the most, important part of each day—
what I call 'The Quiet Time.' This is a period in which you
renew yourself—just relax and think great thoughts and -moke
Marlboro Cigarettes. Why Marlboro? Because they are the
natural complement to the active life. They have better 'makin's';
the filter filters; the flavor is rich and mellow and a treat to the
tired, a boon to the spent, a safe harbor to the storm-tossed.
That's why.
"Well, Sonnenberg, T guess that's about all. Your kindly old
mother sends her love. She has just finished putting up rather
a large batch of pickles—in fact, 3o(),0()0 jars. I told her that
with you away at school, we would not need so many, but
kindly old Mother is such a creature of habit that, though I hit
her quite hard several times, I could not dissuade her.
Keep 'em flying,
Dad."

"Well, Sonnenberg, T guess that's about all. Your kindly old
mother sends her love. She has just finished putting up rather
a large batch of pickles—in fact, 3o(),0()0 jars. I told her that
with you away at school, we would not need so many, but
kindly old Mother is such a creature of habit that, though I hit
her quite hard several times, I could not dissuade her.
Keep 'em flying,

Here's more advice to freshmen—and uppcrclassmen too.
// non-filler cigarettes are your pleasure, double your pleas
ure with I'hilip Morris, made Inj the makers of Marlboro.


HOW TO BE A
THUMPING BIG SUCCESS ON CAMPUS
While up in the attic last week hiding from tlie tax man, T came
across a letter, yellow with age, that dear old Dad had sent me
when I was a freshman. I reproduce it below in the hope that
it may light your way as it did mine.
"Dear Ron, (Dad always called me Son. This was short for
Sonnenberg, which used to be my first name. I traded it last
year with a man named Max. He threw in two outfielders and
a left-handed pitcher ... But I digress.) \
"Dear Son, (Dad wrote)
"I suppose you are finding college very big and bewildering,
and maybe a little frightening too. Well, it need not be that way
if you will follow a few simple rules.
"First of all, ft' you have any problems, take them to your
teachers. They want to help you. That's what the)- are there for.
Perhaps they seem a little aloof, but that is only because they
are so busy. You will find your teachers warm as toast and
friendly as pups if you will call on them at an hour when thoy
are not overly busy. Four a.m., for instance.
"Second, learn to budget your time. What with classes, activi
ties, studying, and social life all competing for your time, it is
easy to fall into sloppy habits. Set up a rigid schedule and -lick
to it. Remember, there are only 24 hours a day. Three of these
hours must be spent in class. For every hour in class you must,
of course, spend two hours studying. So there go six more
hours. Then, as we all know, for every hour studying, you must
spend two hours sleeping. This accounts for twelve more hours.
Then there are meals—three hours each for breakfast and lunch,
four hours for dinner. Never forget, Sonnenberg, you must
chew each mouthful twelve hundred times. You show me a
backward student, and I'll show you u man who bolts his food.

"But college is morp than just sleeping, eating, and studying.
There arc also many interesting activities which you must not
miss. You'll want to give at least three hours a day to the campus
newspaper, and, of course, another three hours each 1<> the
dramatic and music clubs. And let's say a total of eight hours
daily to the stamp club, the debating club, and the foreign
affairs club. Then, of course, nine or ten hours for fencing and
bird-walking, and another ten or twelve for ceramics and three
card monte.
"Finally we come to the most, important part of each day—
what I call 'The Quiet Time.' This is a period in which you
renew yourself—just relax and think great thoughts and -moke
Marlboro Cigarettes. Why Marlboro? Because they are the
natural complement to the active life. They have better 'makin's';
the filter filters; the flavor is rich and mellow and a treat to the
tired, a boon to the spent, a safe harbor to the storm-tossed.
That's why.
