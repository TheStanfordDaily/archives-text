# Winters Will Read Poetry
## 
### 
Yvor Winters, professor of Eng
lish at Stanford and a distin
guished America poet and critic,
will give the first Bay Area read
ing of some of his own poetry
Monday at 8:30 p.m. at the Palo
Alto Community Center Theater.
Winters has read his poetry
only three times before: once at
the University of California at
Santa Barbara, at the San Fran
cisco Poetry Center last year, and
at the gathering of eminent
American poets last autumn at
the Johns Hopkins University
Festival of Poets.
His reading will be a benefit for
the NAACP, of which Winters is
a life member. Tickets are avail
able at $1 plus tax at Kepler's
bookstore, and will be sold on
campus at Engineering Corner
beginning today. Tickets will
also be available at the door.
