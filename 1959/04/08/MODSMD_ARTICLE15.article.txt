# Visitor Tells Of Changes
## 
### 
Morocco is rapidly developing
as a strong country in economic
and social standards. This was
the main opinion of Mrs. Zina
Guessous, assistant librarian, US
IS, Casablanca, Morocco, who
visited campus yesterday.
Within three years the status
of women in Morocco has
changed greatly, Mrs. Guessous
said. From 10 per cent of unveiled
women, the percentage has risen
to 73. These are mostly young
women. Women are working, too,
in many kinds of jobsâ€”salesgirls,
government workers, nurses and
midwives, although there aren't
many doctors as yet.
She continued that the primary
goal in Morocco is to establish a
large, strong middle class and to
lessen the numbers of the very
rich and the very poor. The mid
dle class today is very small, but
growing. The problem is finding
work for everyone.
However, Mrs. Guessous added,
women don't necessarily put men
out of jobs. Women's jobs are
usually light tasks. Uneducated
girls can find work as servants,
while about 25 per cent of college
students are women. Most girls
marry young.
Mrs. Guessous is in large meas
ure responsible for the day-to-day
operation of the USIS library.
