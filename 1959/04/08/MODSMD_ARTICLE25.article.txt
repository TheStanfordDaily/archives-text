# Life Is Like That

Bit of This and Thar

Welcome to "Life Is Like
That."
Week by week in this little
niche you will find a bit of this
and a bit of that. Something
light, something serious for re
lief and something sad perhaps.
Can't guarantee what because . . .
life is like that.
Ah, yes, the quarter is on its
way. One day of classes and one
is so far behind that there is no
hope of catching up and so . . .
it is off to the Lake or sun deck
for the afternoon.
Of course there are some clas
sic high points. Take the first
chorus rehearsal after they had
sung th£ Bach B minor Mass wilh
the S.F. Symphony three times
over vacation. They finished a
Handel number and HCS (direc
tor- Schmidt, that is) tried to
counteract their "oh it's so-so" re
action with—
"Well, anything would seem
dull after the towering giant we
left in San Francisco last week"
. . . to which some enterprising
male answered
"You mean, Jorda?" Sigh.
By the way, glad to get back
into Holladay, Eric? (Hanson).
Not that the Band House was
drafty, dreary or that it was hard
to get any rest with Korten Inkor
porated working on stands and
music till sunrise and returning
after 10 a.m. breakfast.
And then there was the nighl
the patrolman stopped, ready to
arrest juvenile delinquents break
ing into the place, only to be met
by hasty idents . . . "I'm Harvey
Hundt, assistarrt band manager,
I'm Emy Anderson, I'm David
Korten, band manager, and we
. . and of course "I'm Eric Han
son and . . (and besides I live
here)? »
Surprises were in order upon
return . . . take those who got
married over the week. Rita Rob

ison and Tom Neal for instance.
And after telling me on Thurs
day they were getting married in
June when everything was really
set for the next week, too.
Just a few wisdom words to
you new husbands might not
hurt you old ones either "a
smart husband is one who does
n't get so busy bringing home the
bacon that he forgets the apple
sauce."
Surprise of ihe day belongs to
Earl Cilley however. How would
you feel upon returning home at
4 a.m. fresh off a flight from
spending a sousingly good week
in Venezuela to find your red
Ford station wagon transformed
into a black Chev cot vet?
That's how he felt too. Normal
cy (ex sr. col. 172 members
please note this word) returned
later when friend Camille de
Campos returned his and claimed
her vehicle.
And speaking of vehicles . . .
its rattle may startle you, the
clatter may rattle you, but you
will get out of its way. It is the
only one like it on campus. Now
really. It is Curt Russell's green
bike, what else.
No people, the p a s senger s
(won't vouch for the drivers) in
the car cavalcade Thursday nite
weren't dru . . . inebriated that
is. Just second floor Cardenal
kidnaping third floor. Object
treating them, after wild ride
(blindfolded), to ice cream cones
and song fest (accompanied by
Judy Vollmer on guitar ) in Carde
nal lounge.
Just one question, Barry
Mundt. Where did you ever learn
about some of those roads you
led us over ?
You*know that old saying, "A
fool and his money are soon
parted"? What keeps bothering
me is how they got together in
the first place. Oh, well . . .
Life is like that.

Just one question, Barry
Mundt. Where did you ever learn
