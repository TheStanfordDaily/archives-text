Rational Arguments?
Editor, The I)uily:
He loyally oaths: Rational ar
guments against the oath were
.sadly lacking at the LASSU meet
ing. The main arguments against
the oath were emotional. Is this
an issue that should be decided
by emotion?
As Dave Long pointed out, the
constitution is a social contract
type document. Does the repre
sentative (Sandra Bull) who said
she felt it was an insult to her
dignity as a human being to be
asked to sign such an oath place
her personal feelings above the
constitution? I wonder if she and
Gail Greiner (whom you men
tioned in Friday's story on LAS
SU i also consider the military
draft evidence of a trend toward
the "garrison state"? Believe me,
army draftees have their "human

dignity" insulted in much more
concrete fashion than by signing
a loyalty oath. Should be then
do away with involuntary servi
tude in the armed forces?
As for the person who signs
an oath and then changes his
mind: 11 he wants to change
openly all he need do to withdraw
his oath and/or affidavit is no
tify the agency concerned in writ
ing. If he wants to hide his new
beliefs one can only assume that
he intends some politically sub
versive activity. This is precisely
one of the types of people whom
the oath is designed to protect us
against. The oath proviles a
means of prosecuting these peo
ple before they actually harm the
United States. We would think
our Air Force sadly lacking if it
allowed an enemy bomber to fly
to within three miles of ihe Unit
ed States before attempting to in
tercept it. Isn't our internal se

curity deserving of as much can
as our external security?
