Tibetan Brigade
C?
lOditor, The Daily:
From reading your first of iwo
articles summarizing the Tibetan
revolt, one wonders why some
thing is not being done to save the
Tibetans from utter destruction.
One of the American democratic
beliefs is the right to the pursuit
of happiness. Under ihis is guar
anteed the ability of an individual
to choose his form of government.
But in Tibet this right is being
eliminated. One might say that
this right cannot be applied to the
Tibetans. Since when have Amer
icans considered themselves the
chosen race? . . .
Something is being done in this
country to help the Tibetans. An
organization, called the Tibetan
Brigade, has been organized to
come to the aid of the Tibetans.
Here is a brief summary of the
Tibetan Brigade. 'The Tibetan
Brigade was formed to answer
the unanswered call for help from
Tibet. It was formed on the ideas

of men who do not want another
Hungary, who have decided to do
something about it. These men
have good reasons for their ideas.
They are men who have seen the
women and children of Hungary,
Indochina, Korea, Cuba and many
other countries die before their
eyes. . . . They are sick of the
dictators, puppets, rulers, police,
hate, etc., that Communism
breeds, and so they have decided
Ito do something about it. . . .
They know that by helping now
| when it is needed they may that
much sooner rid the world of the
i menace of Communism."
The brigade to date is composed
of 75 men.
