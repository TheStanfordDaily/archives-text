# Warren G. Files for Insurance
## 
### Dallas Young 
Warren G. Wonka has led a hec
tic and eventful life since his cre
ation in 1948 by the. Chaparral.
He has been involved in instances
in half of the world—from Stan
ford to Germany.
He first appeared as a smiling
bra salesman on the pages of the
Chaparral. His popularity was in
stantaneous, and it was only a
short time until he branched into
many new fields and was on his
way to international fame.
Wonka has enjoyed his adven
tures dur ing the last 11 years, but
he is concerned about the constant
dangers he has been exposed to.
Insurance Now
According to E. Thomas Grimes,
manager of the brokerage service
department of the Continent al-Na
tional Group Life Insurance Co.,
the company has received and ap
proved Wonka's application for
student's insurance as of April 2
of this year.
However, Warren's policy will
not begin until the company can
Itftate him to collect $24 for his
first premium.
Grimes' letter to Wonka was re
ceived at Hoover Library, where
someone readdressed it "Misad
dressed Member of Stanford
Daily Staff." We received said
letter yesterday.
Not only students but even the
Administration has become fond
of Wonka.
The Registrar's Office chose
him as the typical lower-division

student whon outlining .study
plans in 1951. Strangely enough,
poor Warren never got out of the
lower division. Dr. Harvey Hall,
Registrar, reports that Wonka
would never he admit tod to Stan
ford loday with the qualifications
that admitted him in 1950.
Almost Graduated
Many students realize the possi
bility of using Warren G. in their
practical jokes. Wonka was regis
tered for the draft in 1918. And if
it hadn't been for a sharp proof
reader working on the 1950 com
mencement program, Warren
would have graduated with that
class.
A member of the Chappie staff
filed a blue card, took the midterm
and final exams and received a
B minus in Western Civ—all in
Wonka's name.
Black Footprints
One of the most sensational an
tics on campus was the appear
ance one morning of huge black
footsteps up a side of the Hoover
Tower. Although this was done'in
1948, il is still vividly remembered,

and the mystery still remains of
just how students were able to
paint the footsteps.
Speculations were made that the
enterprising persons who thought
up this idea somehow hung from
the Tower and used a giant sten
cil. The question remains how the
students and their bulky equip
ment ever got to the top of the
Tower and back down. This story
was added to the Wonka legend
of exploits.
Another story about Wonka was
reported to Stanford from Kirch-
Goens, Germany, by a Stanford
alumnus in 1957. The story 'start
ed before World War I when Kai
ser Wilhelm ordered a car for his
son. However, the war started and
the car was never picked up.
Couldn't Pass
The car had many owners, and
to each it brought bad luck; hence
it was considered a jinxed ear.

Finally it fell into the hands of
Pfc. Warren G. Wonka, Hdq. Co.
Due to its ancient state, the car
could not pass inspection and it
disappeared again when Woirka
was sent back to the U.S.
Campaign Donation
U.S. Sen. Estes Kefauver, in his
1952 presidential primary cam
paign in California, received a do
nation in the name of Warren G.
Wonka. It was a small donation,
naturally, because Warren was a
hard-working Stanford student. A
thank-you letter addressed to War
ren G. Wonka Jr.. Toyon Hall, ex
pressed Kefauver's gratitude for
the contribution.
For more than a year Time
magazine has been unsuccessfully
trying to collect a subscription
seril to Warren G. Wonka, P.O.
Cox 3014, Stanford. (By some odd

coincidence, The Daily is receiving
a copy of Time every week.)
The Associated Press reported
on Oct. 2G, 1951, that Warren G.
Wonka "narrowly escaped serious
injury" in a car accident involving
six Stanford Band members trav
eling to a game at the University
of Washington. The car had gone
off an embankment near Klamath
Falls, Ore., and the uninjured stu
dent had used the name Wonka
because he did not want to worry
his parents.

pressed Kefauver's gratitude for
the contribution.
For more than a year Time
magazine has been unsuccessfully
trying to collect a subscription
seril to Warren G. Wonka, P.O.
Cox 3014, Stanford. (By some odd

coincidence, The Daily is receiving
a copy of Time every week.)
The Associated Press reported
on Oct. 2G, 1951, that Warren G.
Wonka "narrowly escaped serious
injury" in a car accident involving
six Stanford Band members trav
eling to a game at the University
of Washington. The car had gone
off an embankment near Klamath
Falls, Ore., and the uninjured stu
dent had used the name Wonka
because he did not want to worry
his parents.
Warren G. Wonka has led a hec
tic and eventful life since his cre
ation in 1948 by the. Chaparral.
He has been involved in instances
in half of the world—from Stan
ford to Germany.
He first appeared as a smiling
bra salesman on the pages of the
Chaparral. His popularity was in
stantaneous, and it was only a
short time until he branched into
many new fields and was on his
way to international fame.
Wonka has enjoyed his adven
tures dur ing the last 11 years, but
he is concerned about the constant
dangers he has been exposed to.
Insurance Now
According to E. Thomas Grimes,
manager of the brokerage service
department of the Continent al-Na
tional Group Life Insurance Co.,
the company has received and ap
proved Wonka's application for
student's insurance as of April 2
of this year.
However, Warren's policy will
not begin until the company can
Itftate him to collect $24 for his
first premium.
Grimes' letter to Wonka was re
ceived at Hoover Library, where
someone readdressed it "Misad
dressed Member of Stanford
Daily Staff." We received said
letter yesterday.
Not only students but even the
Administration has become fond
of Wonka.
The Registrar's Office chose
him as the typical lower-division

student whon outlining .study
plans in 1951. Strangely enough,
poor Warren never got out of the
lower division. Dr. Harvey Hall,
Registrar, reports that Wonka
would never he admit tod to Stan
ford loday with the qualifications
that admitted him in 1950.
Almost Graduated
Many students realize the possi
bility of using Warren G. in their
practical jokes. Wonka was regis
tered for the draft in 1918. And if
it hadn't been for a sharp proof
reader working on the 1950 com
mencement program, Warren
would have graduated with that
class.
A member of the Chappie staff
filed a blue card, took the midterm
and final exams and received a
B minus in Western Civ—all in
Wonka's name.
Black Footprints
One of the most sensational an
tics on campus was the appear
ance one morning of huge black
footsteps up a side of the Hoover
Tower. Although this was done'in
1948, il is still vividly remembered,

and the mystery still remains of
just how students were able to
paint the footsteps.
Speculations were made that the
enterprising persons who thought
up this idea somehow hung from
the Tower and used a giant sten
cil. The question remains how the
students and their bulky equip
ment ever got to the top of the
Tower and back down. This story
was added to the Wonka legend
of exploits.
Another story about Wonka was
reported to Stanford from Kirch-
Goens, Germany, by a Stanford
alumnus in 1957. The story 'start
ed before World War I when Kai
ser Wilhelm ordered a car for his
son. However, the war started and
the car was never picked up.
Couldn't Pass
The car had many owners, and
to each it brought bad luck; hence
it was considered a jinxed ear.

Finally it fell into the hands of
Pfc. Warren G. Wonka, Hdq. Co.
Due to its ancient state, the car
could not pass inspection and it
disappeared again when Woirka
was sent back to the U.S.
Campaign Donation
U.S. Sen. Estes Kefauver, in his
1952 presidential primary cam
paign in California, received a do
nation in the name of Warren G.
Wonka. It was a small donation,
naturally, because Warren was a
hard-working Stanford student. A

the car was never picked up.
Couldn't Pass
The car had many owners, and
to each it brought bad luck; hence
it was considered a jinxed ear.

Finally it fell into the hands of
Pfc. Warren G. Wonka, Hdq. Co.
Due to its ancient state, the car
could not pass inspection and it
disappeared again when Woirka
was sent back to the U.S.
Campaign Donation
U.S. Sen. Estes Kefauver, in his
1952 presidential primary cam
paign in California, received a do
nation in the name of Warren G.
Wonka. It was a small donation,
naturally, because Warren was a
hard-working Stanford student. A
thank-you letter addressed to War
ren G. Wonka Jr.. Toyon Hall, ex
pressed Kefauver's gratitude for
the contribution.
For more than a year Time
magazine has been unsuccessfully
trying to collect a subscription
seril to Warren G. Wonka, P.O.
Cox 3014, Stanford. (By some odd

coincidence, The Daily is receiving
a copy of Time every week.)
The Associated Press reported
on Oct. 2G, 1951, that Warren G.
Wonka "narrowly escaped serious
injury" in a car accident involving
six Stanford Band members trav
eling to a game at the University
of Washington. The car had gone
off an embankment near Klamath
Falls, Ore., and the uninjured stu
dent had used the name Wonka
because he did not want to worry
his parents.
Warren G. Wonka has led a hec
tic and eventful life since his cre
ation in 1948 by the. Chaparral.
He has been involved in instances
in half of the world—from Stan
ford to Germany.
He first appeared as a smiling
bra salesman on the pages of the
Chaparral. His popularity was in
stantaneous, and it was only a
short time until he branched into
many new fields and was on his
way to international fame.
Wonka has enjoyed his adven
tures dur ing the last 11 years, but
he is concerned about the constant
dangers he has been exposed to.
Insurance Now
According to E. Thomas Grimes,
manager of the brokerage service
department of the Continent al-Na
tional Group Life Insurance Co.,
the company has received and ap
proved Wonka's application for
student's insurance as of April 2
of this year.
However, Warren's policy will
not begin until the company can
Itftate him to collect $24 for his
first premium.
Grimes' letter to Wonka was re
ceived at Hoover Library, where
someone readdressed it "Misad
dressed Member of Stanford
Daily Staff." We received said
letter yesterday.
Not only students but even the
Administration has become fond
of Wonka.
The Registrar's Office chose
him as the typical lower-division

student whon outlining .study
plans in 1951. Strangely enough,
poor Warren never got out of the
lower division. Dr. Harvey Hall,
Registrar, reports that Wonka
would never he admit tod to Stan
ford loday with the qualifications
that admitted him in 1950.
Almost Graduated
Many students realize the possi
bility of using Warren G. in their
practical jokes. Wonka was regis
tered for the draft in 1918. And if
it hadn't been for a sharp proof
reader working on the 1950 com
mencement program, Warren
would have graduated with that
class.
A member of the Chappie staff
filed a blue card, took the midterm
and final exams and received a
B minus in Western Civ—all in
Wonka's name.
Black Footprints
One of the most sensational an
tics on campus was the appear
ance one morning of huge black
footsteps up a side of the Hoover
Tower. Although this was done'in
1948, il is still vividly remembered,

and the mystery still remains of
just how students were able to
paint the footsteps.
Speculations were made that the
enterprising persons who thought
up this idea somehow hung from
the Tower and used a giant sten
cil. The question remains how the
students and their bulky equip
ment ever got to the top of the
Tower and back down. This story
was added to the Wonka legend
of exploits.
Another story about Wonka was
reported to Stanford from Kirch-
Goens, Germany, by a Stanford
alumnus in 1957. The story 'start
ed before World War I when Kai
ser Wilhelm ordered a car for his
son. However, the war started and
the car was never picked up.
