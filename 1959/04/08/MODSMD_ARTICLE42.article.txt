# Cards Host Fresno State In 'Checker Game' Meet
## DAILY Sports SCENE 
### 
Payton Jordan will play a bit of
checkers with his Stanford track
j team Saturday when it entertains
| Fresno Stale College in the Sta
dium at 1:30 p.m.
After being forced to go with
j his strongest men in the past two
meets, frequently doubling them,
I Jordan is taking advantage of
! what shouldn't be too close a team
battle to take a different look at
his squad.
He's putting Ernie Cunliffe in
only t he NBO and relay in order to
give his junior star a chance to
cut loose in the two-lapper. Cun
liffe has already run 1:51.6 on the
heels of a mile and should lower
that some with the benefit of
extra freshness.
Bertil Lundh, who's been dou
bling in the 880 and mile with Cun
liffe, will move up to the two-mile.

He'll jo in Keith Wallace, back
afler a bout with the shin splints.
Meanwhile, Bob Monzingo, who
came through with by far the best
two-mile of his life in winning
t 7gainst UCLA, will step down to
the half. If he showvs up well here
it will considerably boost Stanford
prospects for two-mile relays later
in the season.
Lone Indian in the mile will be
Doug Martin. He was impressive
against UCLA after a bout with
influenza, and will be taking his
first shot at the four-lap event.
flordan is giving his second
liners a chance to get in the

[sprints and quarter. Final en
| trants are to be determined after
! time trials and a general look at
| the week's work by the runners.
A near-full complement of field
events men will be back in action.
Only a skeleton crew- the sure or
! almost • sure point-winners went
to UCLA last week end.
Mike Franchetti. Dave Merchant
and Dick Hughes could give Stan
ford a sweep in the pole vault,
since Fresno State's best man has
done only 11-6.
Craig Barrett will be back to
join John Nourse and Paul Gil
lespie in the high jump and John
Kelly in the broad jump.
Jerry Winters and Bob Atkin
son will be in the shot-put. At
kinson, the coaching staff feels,
may be ready to snap up to the
53-foot range, while Winters is
looking to improve his s(j-9'4 of
last Saturday the PCC's best var
sity effort.

to UCLA last week end.
Mike Franchetti. Dave Merchant
and Dick Hughes could give Stan
ford a sweep in the pole vault,
since Fresno State's best man has
done only 11-6.
Craig Barrett will be back to
join John Nourse and Paul Gil
lespie in the high jump and John
Kelly in the broad jump.
Jerry Winters and Bob Atkin
son will be in the shot-put. At
kinson, the coaching staff feels,
may be ready to snap up to the
53-foot range, while Winters is
looking to improve his s(j-9'4 of
last Saturday the PCC's best var
sity effort.
Payton Jordan will play a bit of
checkers with his Stanford track
j team Saturday when it entertains
| Fresno Stale College in the Sta
dium at 1:30 p.m.
After being forced to go with
j his strongest men in the past two
meets, frequently doubling them,
I Jordan is taking advantage of
! what shouldn't be too close a team
battle to take a different look at
his squad.
He's putting Ernie Cunliffe in
only t he NBO and relay in order to
give his junior star a chance to
cut loose in the two-lapper. Cun
liffe has already run 1:51.6 on the
heels of a mile and should lower
that some with the benefit of
extra freshness.
Bertil Lundh, who's been dou
bling in the 880 and mile with Cun
liffe, will move up to the two-mile.

He'll jo in Keith Wallace, back
afler a bout with the shin splints.
Meanwhile, Bob Monzingo, who
came through with by far the best
two-mile of his life in winning
t 7gainst UCLA, will step down to
the half. If he showvs up well here
it will considerably boost Stanford
prospects for two-mile relays later
in the season.
Lone Indian in the mile will be
Doug Martin. He was impressive
against UCLA after a bout with
influenza, and will be taking his
first shot at the four-lap event.
flordan is giving his second
liners a chance to get in the

[sprints and quarter. Final en
