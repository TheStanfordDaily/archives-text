# Rocket Set to Go In Playoff Action
## 
### 
MONTREAL (/P) â€” Maurice
(Rocket) Richard is ready to play
if the Montreal Canadiens "can
find a hole for mo in the lineup."
The flashy right-winger was
put out of action Jan. 18 when he
fractured his ankle. The Rocket
said his ankle still tires more
quickly than usual, but he really
hustled around the Forum ice at
a practice session Tuesday. The
Canadiens are waiting to meet the
winner of the Boston Bruins To
ronto Maple Leafs series in the
Stanley Cup finals.
