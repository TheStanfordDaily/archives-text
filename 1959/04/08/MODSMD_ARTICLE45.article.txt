### JOHN SCHWARZ 
Sixteen-Year Dronglit

Sixteen years have come and gone, and in all that time Stanford
I lias tailed to lake a tennis match from the UCLA Bruin netters. The
[last Stanford team to defeat UCLA was the 1942 NCAA champion
ship aggregation led by Stanford's top tennis figure of all time, Ted
Seliroeder. This clltb shut the Kriiins out twice, 9-0 and 8-0, bul the
best a Card club has been able to do since is a 3(5 loss.
About this time last year the Indians went south with what was
supposed to be their best team since the 1942 squad. But unfortu
nately the Bruin tennis machine wasn't informed, and the Indians
found themselves on the short end

of a 9-0 swamping.
Just to prove their point a little
further, the Bruins came north
later in the season and laid an 8-1
defeat on the Indians, with only
-lack Douglas able to produce a
Stanford win.
This Saturday at Los Angeles
the Cards will have their 33rd at
tempt (the teams play two match
es a year) to break the UCLA hex.
In the past few years one of
the key factor;-; to UCLA's su
premacy in the tennis world, and
especially in I heir matches with
Stanford, was merely a strong
self-confidence. Tennis, like other
individual sports such as track or
golf, involves a great many psy
chological factors, and UCLA has
'ained by always being at the top
n the confidence department.
Last year's Stanford team, a',
east on paper, had the capabilities
of giving the Bruins a tough strug
gle. However, when the Indians

got on the court they just fell
apart. At one time there was doubt whether a couple of the Stanford
players were going to be able to complete the match—they were
i shaking so much.
I'm 11< jt trying to suggest that Stanford, by merely taking a few
psychiatric treatments, could have whipped down to Los Angeles and
j completely dominated a match with such great players as Mike
Franks, John Cranston, Mikt* Green and John Lesch, the nucleus of
last year's UCLA squad. But with a little will to win and confidence
in their own abilities they could have been in the match a little longer
than the time it took the first two players to walk onto the court.
Improved?
This year Stanford roach Bob Renker (who says hall his job is
teaching his players how to play and the other half convincing them
that they can play) feels that his team will be more prepared for the
Los Angeles trip than they have ever been in the past, and that Ihi-s
might be the year that all Los Angeles jinxes (.the track team's recent
L.A. win was the first in five years) might go down the drain.
Seniors Brooks Rawlins and Dave Nelson were two green kids
trying to play UCLA's men last year, but'since that time several
good wins by both players have added a great deal to their game.
Nelson finished last year very strong and had a very close three
set match with Alex Olmedo in the PCC Championships, which Ol
medo eventually won.
Before the championships Nelson had turned back two of Olmedo's
top teammates in dual matches—Jim Buck and second team All-
American (.only Davis.
The Most Improvement
The same type of added experience has helped all of last year's
returnees. Lowell Carruth has probably shown the best improvement
of the lot. The rangy senior netter has gone undefeated in dual com
petition this year, and his wins include a victory over Tom Brown,
one of the nation's more highly ranked players.
Jim Jeffries, who is probably the top No. 5 player in the nation,
has seen a good deal of action over the last 12 months and could be
a key man in the Los Angeles attack.
The newcomers to the tennis team Dick Qgden, Norm Karns and
Dick Gould - came complete with built-in experience. Ogden was a
top junior player and has played many of the Eastern tourneys. Just
recently he upset Cliff Mayne, one of the nation's top 20 players.
This year, PERHAPS, the Stanford tennis team will be at least
psychologically ready for 1 UCLA coach J. D. Morgan and his new Big
Four of Norm Terry, Roger Werksman, Allan Fox and Dale Rohland.
But if they aren't, one can expect a 17th year to go by with another
UCLA tennis run-away. One thing is sure—UCLA will not hand any
one a victory through lack of confidence.
