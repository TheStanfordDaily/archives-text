### 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (/P)
The lineup the Los Angeles Dodg
ers will use on opening day in
Chicago still is undecided.
It's partly because of Don Zim
mer's uncertain condition. It Zim
mer is ready to go, he'll probably
open at shortstop. Charlie Neal
will be at second base and Junior
Gilliam at third. If Zimmer can't
make it, Neal is likely to be at
short, Gilliam at second and .Jim
Laces at third.
Carl Furillo, who hasn't missed
a season opener 1 in a .decade or
so, probably will sit out the first
game at Chicago. Like Zimmer,
he has a bum leg.
.Rookie Ron Fairly is expeded
to take over for Carl in right
field. Duke Snider will be in cen
ter and VVally Moon in left. John
ny Roseboro will do the catching
and Gil Hodges will be on first.
Don Drysdale is the starting
pitcher.
