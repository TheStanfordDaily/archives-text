# Celtics Near NBA Title
## 
### 
ST. PAUL, Minn. </P)~ Boston's
hurricane oll'ense blew down the
Minneapolis Lakers Tuesday
night, 123110, and swept the Cel
tics into a lori£ 3-0 lead in pro
basket hall's championship play
offs.
The high ■ velocity Celts need
only one more victory to regain
the National Basketball Associa
tion title they surrendered a year
ago to St. Louis. If they whip
the Lakers in Minneapolis Thurs
day night they become the first
team in the NBA to score a four
game sweep of the title series.

With playmaking genius Bub
Cousy engineering the last break
and Bill Russell forming a human
Gibraltar on defense, the Celts
tore open a close game late in the
first quarter and never were in
real jeopardy after that.
But Boston once moiv had to
call on the deluxe troubleshooter,
Frank Ramsey, to discourage a
fourth • quarter Laker comeback
which pushed Minneapolis to
within 10 points of the Celtics
with 3V- minutes left. Two bas
kets by Ramsey got Boston roll
ing again.
