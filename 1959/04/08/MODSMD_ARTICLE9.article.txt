# Adenauer's Decision to Seek German Presidency Stuns Western Diplomats
## 
### 
BONN, Germany (>P)—Konrad Adenauer's decision Tuesday lo sur
render his West German chancellorship for the less important presi
dency stunned German politicians and world diplomats alike.
Ludwig Erhard, 62-year-old economics minister and architect of
Germany's postwar business recovery, was expected to take over

next September the leadership
laid down .by the 83-year-old Ade
nauer.
The choice of a chancellor will
be up to Adenauer's ruling Chris
tion Democratic party if Ade
nauer is elected president, and
there was littlet doubt of Ade
nauer's election.
Main Executive
The chancellor is the main ex
ecueive in Germany. Under the
Bonn constitution he "determines
the policy and hears the responsi
bility for it." The presidency is
largely ceremonial, having pow
ers about equivalent to those of
Queen Elizabeth 11 in Britain.
The decision of Adenauer,
crusty and uncompromising lead
er of West Germany throughout
its entire 10-year history, means
he will be giving up active poli
tics.
But Adenauer will still be at
the holm when crucial East-West
meetings take place this spring
and summer.
Profound Effects
In Washington, it was believed
that Adenauer's less active role
might have profound effects on
policies of the Western powers,
facing critical decisions in their
relations with the Soviet Union.
British officials greeted the
prospective change with satisfac
tion though with no public com
ment. In recent weeks has
been a rift in the personal rela
tionship between Adenauer and
British Prime Minister Harold
Macmillan, who believes the West
must take a more flexible attitude
in negotiations with Moscow.
