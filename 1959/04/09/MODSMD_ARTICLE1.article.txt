figurehead president.
The 83-year-old leader spoke to a nationwide audience on his deci-

sion to drop out as chancellor and
campaign for the less powerful
post of president. Then he left
for a month's vacation in Italy.
He shed Jit tie on the rea
sons for his decision Tuesday. Rut.

nauer was shifting to the presi
dency caused a loud buzz, around
the world that West German pol
icy was going to take on a new
look.
Tough Stand
In his speech, Adenauer hewed
to the tough line.
"No German government can
renounce the rights of the re
pressed portion of the German
nation to decide their political
fate freely through self-determi
nation.
"No German government can
accept a confederation plan 'of
the two German states' which
aims not only at isolating the Fed
eral Republic of West Germany
from without and the destruction
of its free society internally, but
also removes any chances for the
re-establishment of German unity
in freedom."
Certain Election
Adenauer's election as presi
dent in July Is considered almost
certain. He made no comment on
his successor as chancellor. Vice-
Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, 62,
the economics minister, is men
tioned as the most likely choice.

that West Germany's unbending policy toward negotiations with the
Soviet Union will not be changed "one iota" after he retires as chan
cellor. He made it clear that he lias.no intention of becoming a
figurehead president.
The 83-year-old leader spoke to a nationwide audience on his deci-

sion to drop out as chancellor and
campaign for the less powerful
post of president. Then he left
for a month's vacation in Italy.
He shed Jit tie on the rea
sons for his decision Tuesday. Rut.
he declared "with fullest empha
sis" that the powers of president
"are far greater than is generally
believed." He explained that his
decision "was designed to secure
the continuity of our policies for
years to come."
Then he declared that West

Germany's foreign policies will
not be changed during the forth
coming East-West conferences on
Berlin and Germany this spring
and summer, nor after the new
chancellor takes over.
The powers of the West Ger
man president are limited by the
constitution, and the office has
been largely one of prestige and
ceremony. The news that Ade
nauer was shifting to the presi
dency caused a loud buzz, around
the world that West German pol
icy was going to take on a new
look.
Tough Stand
In his speech, Adenauer hewed
to the tough line.
"No German government can
renounce the rights of the re
pressed portion of the German
nation to decide their political
fate freely through self-determi
nation.
"No German government can
accept a confederation plan 'of
the two German states' which
aims not only at isolating the Fed
eral Republic of West Germany
from without and the destruction
of its free society internally, but
also removes any chances for the
re-establishment of German unity
in freedom."
Certain Election
Adenauer's election as presi
dent in July Is considered almost
certain. He made no comment on
his successor as chancellor. Vice-
Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, 62,
the economics minister, is men
tioned as the most likely choice.
