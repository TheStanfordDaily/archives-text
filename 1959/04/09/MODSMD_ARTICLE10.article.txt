WASHINGTON (/P) â€”Moscow's
famed Bolshoi Ballet may dance
in San Francisco, after all.
The State Department so ruled
Wednesday. It also called off a
week-old embargo on travel by
Soviet diplomats in the United
States. It noted that the Soviets
have lifted their temporary
clamp-down against tours by U.S.
officials in the U.S.S.R.
