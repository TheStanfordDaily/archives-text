# McCord, Kendall In Loyalty Debate
## 
### 
Dr. William McCord, associate professor of .sociology, and Dr. Willmoorc Kendall, visiting professor
of political science, square off tonight at 7:15 in the Physics Lecture Hall (phlOO) in a debate on aca
demic freedom and loyalty oaths.
The general topic for the debate will bo "Does the idea of a university exclude commitment to any
political, social or religious orthodoxy?" Sponsors for the event arc the Speech Association, the Po-

litical Union. It was arranged by
Stanford's You n g Republicans
and Young Democrats.
The participants have chosen
two specific points to be debated:
• Was it desirable in the past
for American universities to re
quire membership in the Chris
tian religion as a condition of ap
pointment to staff or faculty po
sitions?
• Does the idea of a university
involve autonomy vis-a-vis the
surrounding social and political
community (e.g., whether a legis
lature should have the power to
require all college and university
professors to swear that they do
not believe in overthrow of the
government by force or violence
and that they are not members
of any group listed by the Attor
ney General as subversive)?
Kendall first entered the local
debate scene when ho met with
chemistry professor Richard Ogg
on humanitarian and atomic wel
fare views of Albert Schweitzer.
That discussion took place be
fore a packed house in Toyon, and
an equally interested and sizeable
attendance has been predicted for
tonight.
Kendall has also scheduled a
debate for next week with reli
gion professor Alexander Miller
on Christianity in higher educa
tion. Later in the quarter, he will
meet Assistant Professor of Po
litical Science John Bunzel on a
topic yet to be announced.
McCord came to Stanford as as
sistant dean of humanities and
sciences in 1957. He has become
best known to Stanford students
through his sociology 1 class and
for talks he has made on various
current sociological topics.
The moderator of tonight's de
bate will he Dr. Wilford Stone, as
sociate professor of English.
