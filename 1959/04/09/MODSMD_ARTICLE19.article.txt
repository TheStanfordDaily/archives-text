# New Daily Policy For Spring Elections
## 
### 
This nprix; ASSI elections will he covered in a different manner
by The Daily.
Instead of continuously li.-ting candidates, we will attempt In
cover the elections as we would any other campaign: candidates
speeches will he covered and their statements will he reported in
news fashion.
H e liare noI decided yd uhither or not we 11 ill en
thirst- individual candidates editorially. I liis will depend
11/ ton the cam pai fins themselves.
The reasons I'or covering spring elections in this manner should
he quite evident. Basically, we hope that such coverage will give
the campus a more interesting campaign. And we do this not
simply to stimulate interest for the sake of stimulating interest
in student government, hut because we feel that the issues at slake
merit such attention.
We realize that throughout the course of the cam
paign the t liarffe will undoubtedly come up that Ihe
Daily ffires more space, to one candidate than another.
I his i< ill be true for the simple reason that all candi
dates won't conduct similar campai fins. Some candidates
won't comment on all the issues, and, when they do, all
of what they say won't he netcs-worlhy.
The candidates''statements and speeches will he weighed care
fully for news value, and reported accordingly. In our news col
umns all candidates are on an equal footing, ami we will remain
as objective as is possible. Their actions and statements will dif
ferentiate them here.
We feel that reporting the elections interestingly is worth
risking the criticism that might result.
