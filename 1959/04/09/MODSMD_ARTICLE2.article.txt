VATICAN CITY (/P)â€”'The com
mander of the Swiss Guard, the
Pope's personal military corps,
was shot and wounded by a dis
gruntled former guardsman Wed
nesday in a struggle just outside
I he papal palace. Vatican officials
were so shocked that al first they
refused to discuss the shooting.
Colonel Robert N'unlist, 48,
guard commander, was wounded
twice but not seriously. One bul
let grazed his neck. The other
struck him in the back.
The former guardsman, Adolf
Ruckcr, 31, was wounded slightly
in the face. It was not clear
whether he deliberately shot him
self or his gun went off acciden
tally in his fight with the colonel.
Such an incident never oc
curred before in the 4 a-century
history of the colorful guards.
A Vatican communique said
"an ex Swiss Guard fired two pis
tol shots at the commander of the
corps, wounding him but not se
riously."
An investigation of the shoot
