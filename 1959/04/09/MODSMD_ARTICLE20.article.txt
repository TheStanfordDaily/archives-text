## Russ Policy Two Germanys 
### 
(Editor's Note: Walter Lipp
111:11111 has just returned from
Europe, where he has taken a
first-hand look at the Berlin cri
sis. This Is the second article
of a report on the situation.)
In the last article I said that the
present German crisis centers
upon the fact that the reunifica
tion of the two Germanys is now
recognized as impossible within
the foreseeable future. This is
the hub from which, like the
spokes on a wheel, radiate all the
current German problems, includ
ing the future of Berlin. For rea
sons which I shall sketch in this
article an understanding of this
momentous historical fact is es
sential to the formation of a
workable Allied policy.
I 13til last November, when
the Soviet Union precipitated
I he present crisis, it was the
official assumption on both
sides of the Iron Curtain that
Germany would eventually be
reunited with Berlin as its capi
tal. As late as the summit
meeting at Geneva in 15)55 the
Russians were still endorsing 1
the idea of German reunifica
tion. It is only since November
of last year that Russia has
openly and explicitly an
nounced that its policy is to
have two German states.
We would underestimate the
weight and impact of the Russian
action if we treated it as a mere
example of Mr. Khrushchev's im
pulsiveness or as a case of bluff.
Rising Standard
East Berlin is primarily a work
ing class district and the stand
ard of living has always been no
tably more drab than in West Ber
lin, which has always had a large
middle class and many rich peo
ple. Moreover, the Russians, hav
ing drained East Germany for
reparations in the years immedi
ately after the war, fairly recent
ly have reversed the process and
are making big investments es
timated by our economists as hav
ing reached a total of $400,0UU,0()0.
The rate of industrial growth
in East Germany is believed
now to be about 1(1 per cent per
annum, and there are compe
tent American observers who
say that the standard of life of
working men and farmers is no
longer radically far apart in the
two Germanys.
Nor should we regard Ihe flow
of refugees as a major element

in the Soviet initiative last No
vember. Traffic between the two
parts of the city of Berlin is quite
free. If the Soviets thought it
important, they could certainly
reduce, even if they could not
wholly stop, the migration from
Communist Germany to demo
cratic Germany.
Nuisance Value
I ain dwelling on this because 1
am persuaded that if we overem
phasi/.e the nuisance value of
West Berlin, we shall miss the
chief significance of the Soviet
policy. By seizing the initiative
and making the indefinite perpet
uation of a divided Germany the
basis of their policy, Ihe Russians
have a chance to accomplish two
large objectives. One is to stabi
lize the East German state and
the satellite orbit by extinguish
ing the hope of adherents to the
West. The other is to confound
and confuse Dr. Adenauer's West
German state by a spectacular
demonstration thai his policy is
at a dead end, and that it has led
to the partition of the German
Reich.
The two - Germanys policy
which the Russians have adopt
ed rests finally, of course, upon
their military power. They can
not be t'on-ed out of East Ger
many at any calculable mili
tary price. But. we would be
deceiving ourselves if we
thought that the division of
Germany rests only on naked
force thwarting the will of Eu
rope and of the Western world.
Wide Support
The truth, I believe, is that for
a variety of reasons the pro
longed division of Germany has
very wide support all over Eu
rope, both East and West, and
also within Germany itself. II is
not merely lhat Hitler's war is
still a living memory in Europe,
and that the fear of a rearmed
and reunited Germany exists in
London and in Paris and even in
Bonn as well as in Warsaw and in
Moscow.
What we have to take account
of is the fact that in the 14 years
which have elapsed since Ihe Al
lies occupied Berlin and abolished
the Nazi government of Germany,
the two Germanys have grown
apart. The Soviet Union on its
side, the Western Allies on their
side, have developed powerful, in
deed compelling interests in main
taining the division of Germany,
