## Campi Reviews Beatniks 
### Elna Rodenhouse 
On the serious side, the Univer
sity of San Francisco's English
teacher poet Harry Stiehl recently
said that the Beat Generation is
not a literary movement, but an
assemblage of "Whitmanian ro
manticism" propelled into quasi
respectability by "Madison Ave
nue tactics."
"li is difficult and never quite
accurate to speak of Beatnik lit
erature as such," he said, "for
(here are many fringe writers
who are often wrongly considered
Beatniks.
"Real 'beat' writers really don't
write. They frequent North
Beach, and let it go at that re
sembling Bohemianism anywhere
in the world."

The poel feels that the Beat
Generation will have no lasting
influence, not even in the Bay
Area. "The making of the Beat
Generation came through Madi
son Avenue exploitation of the
almost simultaneous publication
in 1956 of Allan Ginsberg's 'Howl'
and Jack Kerouac's second novel,
'On the Road,' " he said.
"Kerouas never contributed
anything that wasn't done better
or at least as well by Thomas
Wolfe or- Henry Miller, and Gins
berg's apparent debt to Whitman
and William Carlos Williams is so
great that his work fails to be
solid enough to anchor down a
literary renaissance," he said.
Ginsberg at Harvard
Beatnik writers Allen Ginsberg
and Gregory Corso visited at Har
vard and read some of their po
i etry to a capacity crowd. During
i die question period which fol
lowed the reading, Ginsberg and
Corso entertained the audience
with some amusing observations
on the "beat generation."
Ginsberg said that "being a
beatnik is a real drag: I'm a
poet." He also called spontaneity
the foundation of his work:
"Writing poetry is like going to
the bathroom."

The Village Voice, mouthpiece
of New York's intellectual Green
wich Village, recently carried a
comment on the upper bracket
of the "beat generation."
Reasons for Rejection
W rite r David Mcßeynolds
found three reasons for their
withdrawal from society and re
jection of political concerns:
1. Today's youth are thrust inlo
a world in which there may be no
"personal tomorrow" and, more
important, "no tomorrow for the
human race."
2. In a technological age to
which the human race has not be
gun to adjust, the "beat" finds a
bigness obliterating the sense of
community and human involve
ment.
3. A cynicism is born of the loss
of a sustaining sense of moral
values in an unstable social
framework and the realization
that "both the U.S. and Soviet
Russia are led by power groups
which are patently dishonest."

Ginsberg at Harvard
Beatnik writers Allen Ginsberg
and Gregory Corso visited at Har
vard and read some of their po
i etry to a capacity crowd. During
i die question period which fol
lowed the reading, Ginsberg and
Corso entertained the audience
with some amusing observations
on the "beat generation."
Ginsberg said that "being a
beatnik is a real drag: I'm a
poet." He also called spontaneity
the foundation of his work:
"Writing poetry is like going to
the bathroom."

The Village Voice, mouthpiece
of New York's intellectual Green
wich Village, recently carried a
comment on the upper bracket
of the "beat generation."
Reasons for Rejection
W rite r David Mcßeynolds
found three reasons for their
withdrawal from society and re
jection of political concerns:
1. Today's youth are thrust inlo
a world in which there may be no
"personal tomorrow" and, more
important, "no tomorrow for the
human race."
2. In a technological age to
which the human race has not be
gun to adjust, the "beat" finds a
bigness obliterating the sense of
community and human involve
ment.
3. A cynicism is born of the loss
of a sustaining sense of moral
values in an unstable social
framework and the realization
that "both the U.S. and Soviet
Russia are led by power groups
which are patently dishonest."
On the serious side, the Univer
sity of San Francisco's English
teacher poet Harry Stiehl recently
said that the Beat Generation is
not a literary movement, but an
assemblage of "Whitmanian ro
manticism" propelled into quasi
respectability by "Madison Ave
nue tactics."
"li is difficult and never quite
accurate to speak of Beatnik lit
erature as such," he said, "for
(here are many fringe writers
who are often wrongly considered
Beatniks.
"Real 'beat' writers really don't
write. They frequent North
Beach, and let it go at that re
sembling Bohemianism anywhere
in the world."
Not Influential
The poel feels that the Beat
Generation will have no lasting
influence, not even in the Bay
Area. "The making of the Beat
Generation came through Madi
son Avenue exploitation of the
almost simultaneous publication
in 1956 of Allan Ginsberg's 'Howl'
and Jack Kerouac's second novel,
'On the Road,' " he said.
"Kerouas never contributed
anything that wasn't done better
or at least as well by Thomas
Wolfe or- Henry Miller, and Gins
berg's apparent debt to Whitman
and William Carlos Williams is so
great that his work fails to be
solid enough to anchor down a
literary renaissance," he said.
