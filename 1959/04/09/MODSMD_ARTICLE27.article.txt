# Fresno Spikers Led by Messer
## DAILY Sports SCENE 
### 
Fresno Slate's weakest track team in four years nonetheless boasts
a lew top performers who could make for an interesting afternoon
here Saturday against Stanford.
Sprinter-hurdler-jumper Dale Messer will furnish the top Bulldog
threat in live of the 15 events. He's run the sprints in 10.(J and 22.4

this year, I ho hurdles in 1-1.9 and
23.4, and has broad jumped 22
4'/«.
Against Cal several weeks ago,
Messer was second only to Willie
While in the dashes, took a sec
ond in the hijjhs, and won the
lows. In a meet with -Oregon,
Messer scored Hi points wilh wins
in the broad jump and lows, and
seconds in the 100 and highs.
15 Points a Meet
Last Saturday, in the Bulldogs'
second win of the year, he won
the broad jump and both hurdles,
and was second in the 100. In
lour meets he has scored a total
of (il points.
Hut after Messer, the Fresno
State talent falls off a notch, at
least as indicated by a 9'1 1 a-39Vk
loss to Oregon and an even worse
92%-38V:; pasting at the hands of
Cal. The Bulldog victories have
been against less powerful Cal
Poly and S a < r a rn e n I o Slate
teams.
Gene Hofer, who's equally at
home in the MO, 8X0 or mile,
could cause trouble in whatever
two of the three races he runs.

llis season bests are 19.1, 1:54.3
and 4:22.0,
Three field cvenlers could all
come home with victories against
the Tribe. Tom Gilerest, at 6-s"a
in the high jump, should in fact
have little trouble winning.
Javelin Duel Looms
Bob Spielman, a 213-1 1 javelin
thrower, is a little more than a
foot ahead of Jim Backstrand's
best, so has to rate as a very nar
row favorite.
In the discus, Frank Filer or
Dom DeDomenico could both
cause trouble for Armand De-
Weese and Harlan Limmer. Flier
has thrown 156-4 : 'i to DeDomeni
co's 155-1 1 j. DeWeese hit just
156-3' L' against UCLA, although
he has a season topper of 164-2
Limmer's best is 15S-1 1 -.
