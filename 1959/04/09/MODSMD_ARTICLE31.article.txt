# SPRING PRACTICE TIME
## Grid Drills Open Monday 
### Bob Payne Sports Editor 
Some mighty welcome old faces
anrl real promising new ones
will be on hand Monday when
Stanford's varsity football team
opens the 1959 spring practice
sessions.
The training will continue until
May 1(5, when it is climaxed by
the first annual varsity - alumni
football game. Under NCAA
rules, a school has 36 days in
which to hold 20 days of practice.
Currently, Card mentor Jack Cur
lice plans for Monday, Wednes
day, Friday and Saturday drills.
Although the Tribe managed
only a 2-8 record last season in
Curtice's first year, late-season
developments already give the
promise of an end to the one-year
drought.
Passing Combination
Heading the Indian returnees
are a quarterback and an end that
could combine to be one of Stan
ford's must memorable of a long
line of passer - catcher combina
tions.
Senior Chris Burford, unani
mous All-Pacific Coast Confer
ence end who hauled in 45 passes
last season, is the catcher; junior
Dick Norman, who closed the sea
son with two brilliant perform
ances againsi Qregon State and
California, is the pitcher.

Add to this names like Dick
Bowers, Skip Face, John Bond
and Gil Dowd all steady front
line backs last season; Rick Me-
Millen, a rampaging halfback
who ripped off 185 yards against
Washington last season before be
ing sidelined for most of the rest
of the way with injuries; Sid Gar-

her, the tricky running quarter
back who may find himself a slot
back this season; and sparkling
sophomores such as quarterback
Jim Smith, Stan Lindskog and
Gary Craig and the Tribe has
the makings of one of the Coast's
deepest and most potent back
fields.
Face, currently a versatile
trackman for Coach Payton Jor
dan, will bypass most of the
spring drills along with freshman
high jumper Marlin Walling, a

crack end prospect, and varsity
baseballer lien Robinson, two
year vet at end.
The line is expected to bo bol
stered by one of the PCCs top
linebackers, center Doug Pursed,
who was brilliant enough last sea
son to beat out Norman for
"Sophomore of the Year" honors.
Heavy losses at the guard spots
may be well filled by Larry Lacey
and Hon Fernandes, two shilling
lights in Big Game.
Hi}; Tackles Bark
Dean Ilinshaw and Gary Pike
are among top tackle returnees.
The Papooses donate promising
linemen in Chris Cottle, .7iin Moe,
Dave Nolan and Tom Walsh.
Only one new face is found on
the coaching staff that of Dan
Stavely, the former Washintgon
State aide who comes to Stanford
after one year at Colorado. Stave
ly replaces Colorado-bound Bob
Ghilotti and is expected to take
a big hand in the recruiting de
partment with freshman coach
Horner Smith.

Only one new face is found on
the coaching staff that of Dan
Stavely, the former Washintgon
State aide who comes to Stanford
after one year at Colorado. Stave
ly replaces Colorado-bound Bob
Ghilotti and is expected to take
a big hand in the recruiting de

Horner Smith.
Some mighty welcome old faces
anrl real promising new ones
will be on hand Monday when
Stanford's varsity football team
opens the 1959 spring practice
sessions.
The training will continue until
May 1(5, when it is climaxed by
the first annual varsity - alumni
football game. Under NCAA
rules, a school has 36 days in
which to hold 20 days of practice.
Currently, Card mentor Jack Cur
lice plans for Monday, Wednes
day, Friday and Saturday drills.
Although the Tribe managed
only a 2-8 record last season in
Curtice's first year, late-season
developments already give the
promise of an end to the one-year
drought.
Passing Combination
Heading the Indian returnees
are a quarterback and an end that
could combine to be one of Stan
ford's must memorable of a long
line of passer - catcher combina
tions.
Senior Chris Burford, unani
mous All-Pacific Coast Confer
ence end who hauled in 45 passes
last season, is the catcher; junior
Dick Norman, who closed the sea
son with two brilliant perform
ances againsi Qregon State and
California, is the pitcher.

Add to this names like Dick
Bowers, Skip Face, John Bond
and Gil Dowd all steady front
line backs last season; Rick Me-
Millen, a rampaging halfback
who ripped off 185 yards against
Washington last season before be
ing sidelined for most of the rest
of the way with injuries; Sid Gar-

her, the tricky running quarter
back who may find himself a slot
back this season; and sparkling
sophomores such as quarterback
Jim Smith, Stan Lindskog and
Gary Craig and the Tribe has
the makings of one of the Coast's
deepest and most potent back
fields.
Face, currently a versatile
trackman for Coach Payton Jor
dan, will bypass most of the
spring drills along with freshman
high jumper Marlin Walling, a

crack end prospect, and varsity
baseballer lien Robinson, two
year vet at end.
The line is expected to bo bol
stered by one of the PCCs top
linebackers, center Doug Pursed,
who was brilliant enough last sea
son to beat out Norman for
"Sophomore of the Year" honors.
Heavy losses at the guard spots
may be well filled by Larry Lacey
and Hon Fernandes, two shilling
lights in Big Game.
