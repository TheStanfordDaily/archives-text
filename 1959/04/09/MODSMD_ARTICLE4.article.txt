# Giraud Tells Of Sartre
## 
### Bob Frank 
Professor Raymond I). Giraud
of the Department of Modern Lu
ropean Languages yesterday gave
an informed description of the po
litical views of Jean-Paul Sartre
before a Political Union meeting
in Bowman.
Giraud first attempted to clear
up a difficulty of many people in
understanding the basis for an
atheist system of ethics, lie said
the individual must feel an even
greater responsibility for his ac
tions (anguish) when he is with
out God (according to Sartre).
Later, Giraud recognized a con
nection with Nietzsche's belief
that a man must create his own
morality (or immorality).
Another controversial topic is
the supposed connection between
Sartre and Communism.
Giraud was able to give many
examples from his own reading of
Sartre's magazine to show thai
(I) Sartre is not a Marxist (e.g.,
he could never be considered a de
terminist), (2) Sartre is not pro-
Russia (e.g., his attitude on Hun
gary) and (3) he recognizes a
chasm between Ihe worker-Com
munist (the Communist who is
such because of his class) and the
intellectual sympathizer with
Communists who may be bour
geois.
On the other hand, Sartre has
been extremely active in trying to
win over the border-line Commu
nists in France and has often thus
appeared pro-Communist. Me has
often expressed his hopes for rev
olution and certainly hopes for a
leveling of classes.
Giraud said that Sartre's criti
cisms of America were perceptive
and could be enlightening to
Americans, but they were largely
critical.
