"TO HAVF AND KAVt NOT"
The privileged and fheunder
privileged, the rich and the
poor—most of us have a tend
ency to divide mankind into
two classes. The man who
showed us how to do it was
Cervantes. In "Don Quixote",
he wrote:
"There cire only /wo fam
ilies in the world, the HavtS
and the Have No Is."

"JACK SPRAT"
No, "Anon" didn't coin the
famous quatrain concerning
the thin man and his peculiar
eating habits. Instead, it was
a certain John Clark in some
thing called, "Paraemio
logiu", written in 1639:
"Jack Spral will eat no fat,
And Jill doth love no lean,
Yet betwixt them both
They lick the dishes clean."
