# Profs Differ On University Role
## 
### Bob Frank 
Dr. William McCord, associate
professor of sociology, and Dr.
Willmoore Kendall, visiting pro
fessor of political science, both ex
pressed 1 heir own thoughts on ac
ademic freedom clearly and con
vincingly, as professors should, in
a debate in the physics audito
rium last night.
The debate's moderator, Dr.
Wilfred Stone of the English de
partment, introduced the speakers
and recognized questions from the
audience after each speaker had
stated his own position.
Role of University
Dr. McCord attempted to dis
tinguish two concepts of the role
of the university. The first is the
concept of the university as the
"servant of orthodoxy," and the
second as a "servant of truth as
yet undiscovered."
It was McCord's contention that
"the teacher is responsible to no
one else" for what he teaches. The
only yardstick the teacher is to
use is that of the agreement of
thought with reality."
"With Suspicion"
In reply, Dr. Kendall suggested
that we view McCord's doctrine
"with suspicion" because <1) he is
pleading not just for freedom but
for having truth considered "what
is going on in his head"; (2) he
makes an exception to his rule in
defending it, assuming that no
other side is really worth looking
into; and (3) he thought that "the
more freedom you get, the better."
Kendall then attempted to draw
the problem of academic freedom
as one of a conflict of claims or
liberties between (1) the univer
sity and society and (2) the uni
versity and the professor.
Individual and Society
Where McCord had attempted
to distinguish the state, the church
and the university as institutions
with separate and distinct func
tions, Kendall tried to show that
freedom of university professors
could threaten a free society and
the free individual.
In conclusion, Kendall said "the
university has many responsibili
ties, not a single responsibility,"

and that one responsibility was
the recognition that it will influ
ence the outlook of students.
A long question period followed,
with both professors clarifying
their views. Kendall said that ho
recognized the claims for "free
dom of expression," but thought
that the limits to he set ought to
he determined by negotiation rath
er than setting up the university
as a law unto itself.
McCord 1) rough t. the issue
sharply into focus by saying that
he, as an individual, might â€¢strong
ly oppose a view with which he
did not agree, but that the univer
sity ought never to oppose a view
with which it did not agree.
