# Four File for ASSU Offices; Nominations Close Tuesday
## 31 Posts Open In Spring Voting 
### 
I have had the pleasant experi
ence of working with many tal
ented and able people in my three
years at Stanford. My purpose in
seeking the office of president is
to have the opportunity of draw
ing upon the abilities of these
fellow - students in creating a
strong, streamlined student gov
ernment.
I hope to introduce enough ef
ficiency and speed into the proc
esses of the Legislature and the
commissions so that the functions
of these bodies will be more in
teresting to their members and
their results will lie more tan
gible. If the ASSU organization
can be made more visibly effec
tive, I feel that many capable peo
ple will find an interest in par
ticipating.
After there is some progress in
making the ASSU more effective
in its present functions, then I
look forward to its becoming
more potent in such programs as
fund-raising to maintain the high
caliber of this institution as it
competes financially with state
supported schools. I can summa
rize my interest by stating that an
effective organization will obtain
capable people who will be able
to do some real work while they
enjoy doing it, and that I hope to
help build such an organization.
I hope to have the Legislature
accomplish the following things
next year:
• A revision of the organiza
tion and responsibilities of the
commissions;
• The assignment of a few
concrete functions to the ASSU
Cabinet, so that it will have a job
and interest of its own;
• A positive decision as to the
value of the Fundamcntal'Stand
a rd;
• The creation of a strong stu
dent-run machine which will ob
tain and deliver funds to the Uni
versity for projects like the pro
posed new Union.
Howie Anawalt
Candidate for ASSU
President

My purpose? in running for the
office of AS.SU vice-president is
to strengthen the office as il
stands. I understand the limita
tions of student government, but
also feel that more can be done
within its present realm.
The vice-president's role can be
more than just to co-ordinate ac
tivities; it can be a vital element
in the total concept of Stanford
student government. I feel that
the "busy work" and paper details
should be kept to an absolute
minimum. A de fin i t e effort
should be made to shrink the gap
between administration and stu
dents, and students and students
—keeping in mind at all times
specific interest groups of all
kinds.
I would also like to see one or
two big all-campus functions on
next year's calendar.
Julie Hirsch
Candidate for ASSU
Vice-President

As the Daily editorial slated
Wednesday, positive leadership
and actions are needed in our
student government. J would like
to assume tiiis responsibility by
hearing and representing I he
opinions of the student body,
keeping the student body well in
formed on ASSU and Administra
tive policies and actions, and en
deavoring to bring about greater
co-ordination between the stu
dnts and the Administration and
faculty.
Student government, of course,
should not be forced upon any
one. However, it is still the duty
of student government to act
within all spheres of student life
—academic, social and housing—
and on behalf of all the students
of Stanford. In serving the stu
dent body, the ASSU president
and Legislature should keep in
mind certain purposes and re
sponsibilities that are necessary,
I believe, for an efficient and suc
cessful government.
In this campaign, I will empha
size the following points:
The need for co-ordination and
closer unity between—
• The various student groups
on campus through improved
communications and a stronger
Cabinet;
• The students and University
Administration through a com
mittee similar to the President's
Student Advisory Committee on
Academic Affairs which would be
concerned with student policy;
and
• The students and faculty
through an arousal of student in
terest to take further advantage
of the opportunities that our fac
ulty offers us.
Also, p r a c t i c a 1 legislation,
which will concern and aid the
students, such as further develop
ment of the new student union,
extended library hours and hous
ing, will be another goal of mine.

Candidate for ASSU
Vice-President

As the Daily editorial slated
Wednesday, positive leadership
and actions are needed in our
student government. J would like
to assume tiiis responsibility by
hearing and representing I he
opinions of the student body,
keeping the student body well in
formed on ASSU and Administra
tive policies and actions, and en
deavoring to bring about greater
co-ordination between the stu
dnts and the Administration and
faculty.
Student government, of course,
should not be forced upon any
one. However, it is still the duty
of student government to act
within all spheres of student life
—academic, social and housing—
and on behalf of all the students
of Stanford. In serving the stu
dent body, the ASSU president
and Legislature should keep in
mind certain purposes and re
sponsibilities that are necessary,
I believe, for an efficient and suc
cessful government.
In this campaign, I will empha
size the following points:
The need for co-ordination and
closer unity between—
• The various student groups
on campus through improved
communications and a stronger
Cabinet;
• The students and University
Administration through a com
mittee similar to the President's
Student Advisory Committee on
Academic Affairs which would be
concerned with student policy;
and
• The students and faculty
through an arousal of student in
terest to take further advantage
of the opportunities that our fac
ulty offers us.
Also, p r a c t i c a 1 legislation,
which will concern and aid the
students, such as further develop
ment of the new student union,
extended library hours and hous
ing, will be another goal of mine.

I have had the pleasant experi
ence of working with many tal
ented and able people in my three
years at Stanford. My purpose in
seeking the office of president is
to have the opportunity of draw
ing upon the abilities of these
fellow - students in creating a
strong, streamlined student gov
ernment.
I hope to introduce enough ef
ficiency and speed into the proc
esses of the Legislature and the
commissions so that the functions
of these bodies will be more in
teresting to their members and
their results will lie more tan
gible. If the ASSU organization
can be made more visibly effec
tive, I feel that many capable peo
ple will find an interest in par
ticipating.
After there is some progress in
making the ASSU more effective
in its present functions, then I
look forward to its becoming
more potent in such programs as
fund-raising to maintain the high
caliber of this institution as it
competes financially with state
supported schools. I can summa
rize my interest by stating that an
effective organization will obtain
capable people who will be able
to do some real work while they
enjoy doing it, and that I hope to
help build such an organization.
I hope to have the Legislature
accomplish the following things
next year:
• A revision of the organiza
tion and responsibilities of the
commissions;
• The assignment of a few
concrete functions to the ASSU
Cabinet, so that it will have a job
and interest of its own;
• A positive decision as to the
value of the Fundamcntal'Stand
a rd;
• The creation of a strong stu
dent-run machine which will ob
tain and deliver funds to the Uni
versity for projects like the pro
posed new Union.

The vice-president's role can be
more than just to co-ordinate ac

the "busy work" and paper details
should be kept to an absolute

I have had the pleasant experi
ence of working with many tal
ented and able people in my three
years at Stanford. My purpose in
seeking the office of president is
to have the opportunity of draw
ing upon the abilities of these
fellow - students in creating a
strong, streamlined student gov
ernment.
I hope to introduce enough ef
ficiency and speed into the proc
esses of the Legislature and the
commissions so that the functions
of these bodies will be more in
teresting to their members and
their results will lie more tan
gible. If the ASSU organization
can be made more visibly effec
tive, I feel that many capable peo
ple will find an interest in par
ticipating.
After there is some progress in
making the ASSU more effective
in its present functions, then I
look forward to its becoming
more potent in such programs as
fund-raising to maintain the high
caliber of this institution as it
competes financially with state
supported schools. I can summa
rize my interest by stating that an
effective organization will obtain
capable people who will be able
to do some real work while they
enjoy doing it, and that I hope to
help build such an organization.
I hope to have the Legislature
accomplish the following things
next year:
• A revision of the organiza
tion and responsibilities of the
commissions;
• The assignment of a few
concrete functions to the ASSU
Cabinet, so that it will have a job
and interest of its own;
• A positive decision as to the
value of the Fundamcntal'Stand
a rd;
• The creation of a strong stu
dent-run machine which will ob
tain and deliver funds to the Uni
versity for projects like the pro
posed new Union.
Howie Anawalt
Candidate for ASSU
President

My purpose? in running for the
office of AS.SU vice-president is
to strengthen the office as il
stands. I understand the limita
tions of student government, but
also feel that more can be done
within its present realm.
The vice-president's role can be
more than just to co-ordinate ac
tivities; it can be a vital element
in the total concept of Stanford
student government. I feel that
the "busy work" and paper details
should be kept to an absolute
minimum. A de fin i t e effort
should be made to shrink the gap
between administration and stu
dents, and students and students
—keeping in mind at all times
specific interest groups of all
kinds.
I would also like to see one or
two big all-campus functions on
next year's calendar.
Julie Hirsch
Candidate for ASSU
Vice-President

As the Daily editorial slated
Wednesday, positive leadership
and actions are needed in our
student government. J would like
to assume tiiis responsibility by
hearing and representing I he
opinions of the student body,
keeping the student body well in
formed on ASSU and Administra
tive policies and actions, and en
deavoring to bring about greater
co-ordination between the stu
dnts and the Administration and
faculty.
Student government, of course,
should not be forced upon any
one. However, it is still the duty
of student government to act
within all spheres of student life
—academic, social and housing—
and on behalf of all the students
of Stanford. In serving the stu
dent body, the ASSU president
and Legislature should keep in
mind certain purposes and re
sponsibilities that are necessary,
I believe, for an efficient and suc
cessful government.
In this campaign, I will empha
size the following points:
The need for co-ordination and
closer unity between—
• The various student groups
on campus through improved
communications and a stronger
Cabinet;
• The students and University
Administration through a com
mittee similar to the President's
Student Advisory Committee on
Academic Affairs which would be
concerned with student policy;
and
• The students and faculty
through an arousal of student in
terest to take further advantage
of the opportunities that our fac
ulty offers us.
Also, p r a c t i c a 1 legislation,
which will concern and aid the
students, such as further develop
ment of the new student union,
extended library hours and hous
ing, will be another goal of mine.

more than just to co-ordinate ac
tivities; it can be a vital element
in the total concept of Stanford
student government. I feel that
the "busy work" and paper details
should be kept to an absolute
minimum. A de fin i t e effort
should be made to shrink the gap
between administration and stu
dents, and students and students
—keeping in mind at all times
specific interest groups of all
kinds.
I would also like to see one or
two big all-campus functions on
next year's calendar.
Julie Hirsch
Candidate for ASSU
Vice-President

As the Daily editorial slated
Wednesday, positive leadership
and actions are needed in our
student government. J would like
to assume tiiis responsibility by
hearing and representing I he
opinions of the student body,
keeping the student body well in
formed on ASSU and Administra
tive policies and actions, and en
deavoring to bring about greater
co-ordination between the stu
dnts and the Administration and
faculty.
Student government, of course,
should not be forced upon any
one. However, it is still the duty
of student government to act
within all spheres of student life
—academic, social and housing—
and on behalf of all the students
of Stanford. In serving the stu
dent body, the ASSU president
and Legislature should keep in
mind certain purposes and re
sponsibilities that are necessary,
I believe, for an efficient and suc
cessful government.
In this campaign, I will empha
size the following points:
The need for co-ordination and
closer unity between—
• The various student groups
on campus through improved
communications and a stronger
Cabinet;
• The students and University
Administration through a com
mittee similar to the President's
Student Advisory Committee on
Academic Affairs which would be
concerned with student policy;
and
• The students and faculty
through an arousal of student in
terest to take further advantage
of the opportunities that our fac
ulty offers us.
Also, p r a c t i c a 1 legislation,
which will concern and aid the
students, such as further develop
ment of the new student union,
extended library hours and hous
ing, will be another goal of mine.
