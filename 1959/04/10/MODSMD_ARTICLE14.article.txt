# Communists Threaten Arab Bloc Security
## 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (/P) Shocked
by the threat of a Communist
take-over in Iraq, Arabs may be
moved to form their own home
made anti * Communist bloc. It
could succeed where a Western
attempt to stem Communism in
the Arab East failed.
The Baghdad Pact, formed in
1955, linked an Arab country. Iraq,
to Britain, Turkey and Pakistan
in a northern wall against Com
munism. But Arab nationalists re
jected it. They associated the West
with imperialism and colonialism,
suspected its motives.
Only the Iraqi monarchy, domi
nated by the late Premier Nuri
Said, went along with the alliance,
giving the pact its name.
Arab Union
Arab union remains largely a
myth. But a common threat could,
at least, bring the rulers of the
Arab countries together in a com
mon front to hold off further So
viet penetration.
The lack of Arab unity was
clear at the Arab League meeting
of foreign ministers here this
week. For reasons of their own,
some leaders hesitated to join
United Arab Republic president
(iamal Abdel Nasser's vigorous
anti-Communist campaign.
Communist Danger
There is a parallel between what
is taking place in the Middle East
now and what happened in Eu
rope a decade ago.
As one eastern European coun
try after another fell into the
Communist net, western European
countries rallied to the concept of
NATO. Even then the defense al
liance lacked teeth until the shock
of the Korean war.
