# Sidewalk Cafe Seen As Good Addition
## 
### 
IF all GOF.S WKLL, Stanford will become the .site of a unique side
walk cafe, complete with garden area and umbrella-co\ ered tables.
1 i\e kinds of Espresso, at 25 cents per cup, would be ser\ed from
3 to 5 and 7 to 9 p.m., Monday through Friday.
The idea was suggested last spring by Onno van Teulem from
the Netherlands, a graduate student in the Food Research Insti
tute. and has been enthusiastically supported by the IIR hoard,
foreign student adviser Werner Warmbrunn, ASSI officers and
other sources. Now —for the record, at least —we add The l)ail\
to the list of supporters.
Such a cafe icouUl add much lo the Stanford ctnnmu
nity. It would provide I) a unique, gathering place with
a cosmopolitan atmosphere where tin- students and their
guests could sit, relax and talk in peace; 2) a quality
menu of fine coffees; '!) an excellent opportunity for for
eign and American students to work together on a proj
ect; and I) a means of introducing more Stanford sln
dents to the I (enter.
I'lans for the sidewalk cal'c have been carefully formulated by
a committee of interested persons: Sandra Hull, Ittan (.aushie,
ASSI : business manager Larry Kelley and Dr. Warmbrunii.
Lite proposed site is the North Garden of the International
Center, The garden can be reached directly from the front walk
without going through the Center itsell, and hence would not
interfere with the Center s 112 unction as a home and a social gath
ering place for students.
The area would accommodate eight tables and have a sealing
capacity of 28 people. White garden tables with large umbrellas
and folding chairs would be purchased t<> furnish the rale. As
planned, the operation would he self-supporting. The cafe would
be serviced bv volunteer student waiters and waitresses, both for
eign and native.
A small, pantry-like area lo house, the two I spresso
machines and other necessary utilities mould he con
structed at the rear of the garden. C.onstruction luhor
would he furnished hy interested students.
It is the hope of the committee that the Associated Students
will eventually assume full responsibility for the operation, fi
nances and management of the cafe after a trial period. During
this trial period it would be checked daily hy a member of the
ASSU staff to see that high cleanliness standards prevailed and
that its appearance is a credit to the University.
Possible financial arrangements to make the establishment of
the cafe possible are now being discussed by the'committee, the
Union board of governors and ASSU officials. We hope that they
soon decide on a feasible plan so that this worthwhile new addi
tion to the campus may be realized.
