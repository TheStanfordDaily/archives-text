## Personally Speaking Fraternity 'Blackballing' Problem 
### Leo Krulitz 
"Dinging." or blackballing, is a
feature of the fraternity system
that is criticized, often vehement
ly and too often rather flippantly.
It is too easy to say that it is
undemocratic for one member of
a house to be able to block the
admission of a person, or that all
the people must like all the
pledges in order to preserve house
unity.
These arguments don't take
into account the complexities of
the matter or the real issues in
volved. 1 propose to discuss the
rationalization of blackballing,
not for the purpose of justify
ing it or suggesting that it be
abandoned, but hopefully to call
attention to the real issues on
which this problem touches.
Perhaps we should start with a
brief clarification of what black
balling is and to what extent it
exists at Stanford. It is the sys
tem whereby one member of a
fraternity, even an outgoing sen
ior, by his vote can exclude any
person he likes from pledging to
join that particular house.
Blackballing exists here at Stan
foul, but it is not universal among
all the houses. We are informed
that in some houses the rushing
committees have the authority to
pledge a person. There may be
other alternatives in existence,
but this is immaterial to our pur
pose here.
In attempting to rationalize
this system, we start with the
very basic premise that it is,
and ought to be, an individual's
right to choose the person or
people with whom be wants to
live. This, of course, is tin* basis
of the fraternity system and
also the underlying premise of
independent living.
Once this premise is accepted,

the question arises whether or not
the manner of selection should be
entirely up to the individual. This,
I would suggest, is a truism. It
the individual has the absolute
right to choose, by definition thi*
can't be circumvented by having
the means of selection dictated.
Granted the individual's right to
choose in any manner the people
with whom he is to live: what
happens when this is applied to a
group of individuals?
It follows tiiat if an individual
has this complete right, then the
means by which he chooses to
select his living companions can
certainly be a selection process
in association with other indi
viduals.
But can we take the final step
and say that, on the basis of our
argument thus far. a group may
use any method it desires to sele. i
living companion::? Even the
method of blackballing?
I would suggest thai this step
can't be taken because ii violates
our basic premise.
We have based our entire argu i
merit on the fact that the indi
vidual has (he right to choose his!
living companion; in a house ol
40 men blackballing gives the i
power to one person to deny 1 his 1
right to 39 others. In effect, we
are trying to justify a selection J
process that violates the principle j
on which it rests.
We have an "end," which is to
allow individuals to select the
people they will live with, and a
"means" — blackballing, in this
case — supposedly justified by
that end, but in reality not con
sistent with it. The means have
be come the end, because it is
the blackballing system that is
presently in effect, to the exclu- !
sion of the individual's right of
selection.

which this problem touches.
Perhaps we should start with a
brief clarification of what black
balling is and to what extent it
exists at Stanford. It is the sys
tem whereby one member of a
fraternity, even an outgoing sen
ior, by his vote can exclude any
person he likes from pledging to
join that particular house.
Blackballing exists here at Stan
foul, but it is not universal among
all the houses. We are informed
that in some houses the rushing
committees have the authority to
pledge a person. There may be
other alternatives in existence,
but this is immaterial to our pur
pose here.
In attempting to rationalize
this system, we start with the
very basic premise that it is,
and ought to be, an individual's
right to choose the person or
people with whom be wants to
live. This, of course, is tin* basis
of the fraternity system and
also the underlying premise of
independent living.
Once this premise is accepted,

the question arises whether or not
the manner of selection should be
entirely up to the individual. This,
I would suggest, is a truism. It
the individual has the absolute
right to choose, by definition thi*
can't be circumvented by having
the means of selection dictated.
Granted the individual's right to
choose in any manner the people
with whom he is to live: what
happens when this is applied to a
group of individuals?
It follows tiiat if an individual
has this complete right, then the
means by which he chooses to
select his living companions can
certainly be a selection process
in association with other indi
viduals.
But can we take the final step
and say that, on the basis of our
argument thus far. a group may
use any method it desires to sele. i
living companion::? Even the
method of blackballing?
I would suggest thai this step
can't be taken because ii violates
our basic premise.
We have based our entire argu i
merit on the fact that the indi
vidual has (he right to choose his!
living companion; in a house ol
40 men blackballing gives the i
power to one person to deny 1 his 1
right to 39 others. In effect, we
are trying to justify a selection J
process that violates the principle j
on which it rests.
We have an "end," which is to
allow individuals to select the
people they will live with, and a
"means" — blackballing, in this
case — supposedly justified by
that end, but in reality not con
sistent with it. The means have
be come the end, because it is
the blackballing system that is
presently in effect, to the exclu- !
sion of the individual's right of
selection.
"Dinging." or blackballing, is a
feature of the fraternity system
that is criticized, often vehement
ly and too often rather flippantly.
It is too easy to say that it is
undemocratic for one member of
a house to be able to block the
admission of a person, or that all
the people must like all the
pledges in order to preserve house
unity.
These arguments don't take
into account the complexities of
the matter or the real issues in
volved. 1 propose to discuss the
rationalization of blackballing,
not for the purpose of justify
ing it or suggesting that it be
abandoned, but hopefully to call
attention to the real issues on
which this problem touches.
