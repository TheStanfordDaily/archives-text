Editor, The Daily;

the current question of loyalty-by

THE ABC OF SECURITY
Said Mr. A to Mr. B,
"I doubt the loyalty of C."
Said Mr. B to Mr. A,
"I'm shocked and stunned by what
you say;
We'd better check on him today.
And since you've brought up
Mr. C,
I feel that 1 must mention 1).
I rather doubt HIS loyally."
Said Mr. F to Mr. (;,
"G. have you ever noticed B?
What do you make of his loy
alty?"
Said Mr. G to Mr. F,
"Lower' your voice fjeople aren't
deaf!
1 wouldn't want you quoting me,
But, sure, I've always noticed B."
Said Mr. C to Mr. A,
"I saw a funny thing today;
At least, it seemed quote odd to
ME.
I saw F whispering with G,
Ami I just caught the name of B."
"No, really?" answered A to C.
"Well, anyway I don't know B.
I guess it's just .as well for me."
Â«
And so Ihe subtle poison spread
Until then* rose a Mr. Zed.
The lightning played around his
head.
"My fellow countrymen," he said,
"The past, as you'll observe, is
dead,
The alphabet's discredited;
You can't trust teachers now to
teach,
You can't trust ministers to
preach,

And il has been my special labor
To prove thai none can trust hi*
neighbor.
In fact, it's amply clear to see
There's no one you can tru-.it but
me.
And by a happy turn of Fate
I've come to purify the State.
My methods will be swift and
strong
Against the crime of thinking
wrong.
I know the cure for heresy,
And you can leave il all to me.
Leave everything to me!" he said.
"Hurrah!" they cried. "Hurrah for
Zed!"
