# Depth Favors Tribe Runners
## DAILY Sports SCENE 
### Dick Barnes 
Overwhelming depth is expected
to power Stanford to a track and
Held victory ov< i Fresno.State to
morrow at 1:30 in Stanford Sta
dium. The meet should provide
the Indians with a good prep for
next Saturday's triangular with
Oregon and (JSC a good prep if
the Bulldogs don't put together a
basketful ol surprises and walk
off with a victory.
Stanford is at its highest peak
since Payton Jordan came here
two seasons ago. After a strong
showing against Occidental for
two-thirds of the meet, the Cards
put all their tricks together for a
72-. r >9 upset ol UCLA last Satur
day.
if all goes well for the Jordan
men tomorrow, they should be in
tiptop mental and physical shape
for the Duck-Troy encounter next
week.
Ilig (inns (Â»one
Fresno, though down a notch in
class since, last spring's gradua
tion of hurdler Ancel Robinson
and splinter Mike Agostini, could
still cause trouble if the Cards
underrate it too much.
To give his men a chance to
shoot lor lop marks in a single
event, or to see how they can do
in something else, .Jordan has
made a few switches in his entry
list.
Chief among Ihcse are letting
Ernie Cunlil'fe go in just the half
instead of half and mile, and'mov
ing Bertil Lundh to the two-mile.
Dean Smith will also lay out of
the 220 in favor of the low hur
dles, and Bob Monzingo will take
a shot at the half instead of the
mile and the two-mile. Two-miler
Doug Marl in moves down to the
mile.
Four Top Events
Probably the closest struggles
will come in the sprints, discus
and javelin.
Dale Messer, the Bulldogs' high
scorer and a probable entrant in
five events, will have strong com
petition from Smith, Norm Pease
and Ben Anixter in the 100 and
from Pease and Anixter in the 220.
Though his bests are just 10.0
and 22.1, Messer has placed well
in all his meets this year and is a
distinct threat to beat men whq
have slightly better clockings.
With almost-sure victories in
both hurdles, and excellent scor
ing chances in the dashes and the
broad jump, Messer appears 1o be
a certain pick as high-point man
for the meet at somewhere be
tween 15 and 19.
Sprint Hopes
Smith snapped back into the
groove with twin victorie-s against
UCLA last Saturday. Pease is al
ways a moderate threat, and Anix
ter snapped off a 9.9 early in the
week.
The discus finds Stanford's Ar
mand DeWee.se and Harlan Lim
mer and Fresno's Frank Filer and
Dom DeDomenico all with bests
within a 10-foot range. Bob Spiel
man and the Indians' Jim Back
strand have javelin marks little
more than a foot apart, so should
stage an interesting competition.
Returning to action for Stanford
after a shin splint lay-off will be
two-miler Keith Wallace.
