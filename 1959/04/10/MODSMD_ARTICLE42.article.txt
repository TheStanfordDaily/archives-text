# Broncos, Indians Vie for Top Spot
## 
### Dave Dow 
The Santa Clara Broncos, their
12-game unbeaten streak halted,
provide the weekend competition
lor Stanford's S-fS Indians.
Both teams wi 11 pack a 2-0 tec
ord in CI HA play inio t(jday's
game at Santa Clara's Washing
ton Park. The two teams will
meet a<„>ain tomorrow at 3:15 in
1 lie Sunken I Jiamond.
The Broncos, who have never
won a Calil'ornia Intercollegiate
Baseball Association title, definite
ly appear to be in contention this
year. AI least an improvement
ovci last year's 5-11 last-place tie
seems in the offing. Stanford won
3 til 1 games from Santa Clara in
l!)5<S play.
SJS tlie ( ulprit
The San Jose State Spartans,
who won 2 of 3 pre-conference
games from Stanford' this year,
stopped Santa Clara's winning
skein with a 7-2 victory Tuesday
night.
The Indians, on the other hand,
handed College of the Pacific a
10 inning 2 I defeat in their most
recent outing, but collected only
Iwn hits in the process. The locals'
bats are just not speaking as a
.223 team batting average will at
test to.
MecUlenherg to Start
Stanford will have to rely on
the pitching of Marv Meeklenberg
<0-0, 3.G0), Terry Lindcman <3-1,
2.Hi) and Earl Russell (3-3, 2.971 ;
to stop the red-hot Broncos. Meek- i
lenberg will get the call in today's
encounter, and either Lindeman or
Russell will pitch tomorrow*. Meek-:
lenberg earned a starting call with j
a four-strikeout, three-inning stint '
against COP.
Santa Clara's Bill Leonard has
riot named his starting pitchers
yet, but is equally willing to give
Steve Sehott, Frank Sobrero, Dick
Creighton, George Gardiner, Lar-1
ry Higgins. Dick Williams or Jim i
Gill a shot at the Indians.
O'ltourke Stars
Outfielder Jim O'Rourke, All-!
Conference in '58, is back to riddle j
CIBA pitchers with his big bat. |
He has already collected four
home runs this year. The Bron
cos' leading hitter to date, how
ever, has been shortstop Bob Chin
ehiolo, who will bring a .437 av
erage into the Stanford games.
Probable lineups for the two j
teams follow:
