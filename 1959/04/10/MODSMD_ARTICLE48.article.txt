# betters Face SC, UCLA In Two Already-Crucials
## 
### John Schwarz 
The PCC tennis season gets un
der way this weekend and there
are strong possibilities that the
first weekend's action might just
decide the whole title race.
The conference favorite UCLA
Bruins take on the second-choice
net team from Stanford at Los
Angeles on Saturday and this
match might turn out to be the
contest that decides this year's
championship.
Diluted Trojans
Stanford's traveling netters will
face a very diluted NCAA chain
pionship team when I hey take on
LJSC a I the Los Angeles Tennis
Club.
The great Alex Olmedo has
used up his eligibility as have
Gordy Davis and Jim Buck while
Ed Atkinson, due to an injury,
lias decided to lay out this year.
The remaining two starters on
last year's USC squad are also
out of action; Ed Guzm&n re
turned to Mexico and Ernie Eol
lico graduated.
SC will have, however, a lew

last year's powerhouse. Grog j
(Irani, a USC netter two years
ago, is hack to take over the top
spot with Alan Tong, a fine JC
transfer, and Dick Leach, a good;

sophomore, right behind Grant.
The Stanford traveling squad
of seven men will include Dave
Nelson at the top singles spot,
with Dick Ogden, Lowell Carruth,
Brooks Rawlins, Jim Jeffries and
Dick Gould rounding ou the sin
gles lineup in that order.
The doubles combos consist of
Ogden and Nelson at one, Carruth
and Jeffries at two, and llawlins
and Norm Karns at three.
Depth Is Hope
The Indians are relying on their
depth again, as they have quite
often this year, to help I hern con
quer the favored Bruins. UCLA
is strong in the top three spots
with Norm Perry, Allan I'ox and
Roger VVerksman probably play
ing in that order. All three are
highly ranked players both on the
There is a tremendous fall,
however, between UCLA's third
and fourth men. Dale Rohland,
the only senior on the Bruin team
and the number four player, is an
adequate netter but he is no

The PCC tennis season gets un

are strong possibilities that the
first weekend's action might just

The conference favorite UCLA
Bruins take on the second-choice

often this year, to help I hern con
quer the favored Bruins. UCLA
is strong in the top three spots

Roger VVerksman probably play
