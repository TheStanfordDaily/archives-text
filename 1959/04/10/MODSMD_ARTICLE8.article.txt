### 
WASHINGTON (/P)—Three Air
Force jet pilots, three Navy men
and a Marine have been picked by
t he government as the Americans
best equipped to attempt space
flight. Their names were an
nounced yesterday.
One of them, two years from
now, may orbit the earth at an
altitude of 100 to 150 miles in the
first satellite flight. The others
probably will take similar space
rides in the months following.
Flight Safe
An Air Force surgeon assured
senators Thursday that man can
safely fly into space and return
under projects planned by this
country.
Charles W. Mathews, chief of
flight operations for the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration, testified that the first ac
tual test flights into space will be
made by animals. He said space
flight by man may come next
year.
Travelers Calm
The space travelers-to-be were
put on view yesterday — seven
calm, steel-nerved married men
in their 30's, all of moderate
height and slight build. They say
they're sure they'll come back
safe from the most terrifyingly
dangerous voyage yet conceived
for a human being.
Nobody knows yet which one
will get the first historic ride.
Each of the seven says it's some
thing of. which he has long
dreamed.
Wives Say Okay
Each also said at a news con
ference yesterday that it's okay
with the wife and children for
him to make the first satellite
flight.
These seven were selected after
possibly the most rigid physical
and mental tests ever given hu
man beings.
