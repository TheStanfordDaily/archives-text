Preparing the Palo Alio Little

In dedicating yesterday to
working at the ballpark, the chap

a nationwide program of Phi Del
ta The.ta fraternity. All 120 na
tional chapters devote their
massed man hours to this kind of
civic service work on one spring
day of each year.
Last year the Stanford Phi I ,p lt
chapter worked a' a Cirl Seoul
camp in the Santa Cruz moun
tains. .lon Rachiord of the frater
nity chapter was the work master
for yesterday's session when 4.1
members of the chapter tackled
the .job.
Phi Delta Theta's "Community
Service Day" was instituted as an
annual feature of this fraternity's
calendar on an international basis
in 1950, and has won praise from
city, college and legislative offi
cials for the good that has been
accomplished in the past.
