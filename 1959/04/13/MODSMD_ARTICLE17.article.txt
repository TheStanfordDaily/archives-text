"To Win the Minds of Men," by
Peter Grotbe, is Mia study and
evaluation ot the content and
method ot Communist propagan
da in East Germany, (lit a pas
sioriate denunciation ol Commit
nisrn and ail its works by a young
American who has gut it through
his head—really got it through
his head, 1 say that the Commu
rusts might win in ttie current
struggle fOl world power, and i.'ii
a recommendation as to how "we"
can win in the propaganda phase
ot that struggle.
As for (l), Grot he made more
than 100 excursions to the major
cities ol East Germany, inter
viewed everyone he could button
hole, kept his eyes open, took
good notes, reinforced the notes
with wide reading in the relevant
documents.
lie gives a convincing picture
of how the East German propa
ganda machine functions, and
proves right up to the hilt, proves
to me anyhow, that (a) the East
German regime works away at its
propaganda mission, which is to
turn tfie East Germans into con
vinced Communists, with viin and
vigor, (b) that the men who dom
inate the machine are unscrupu
lous, tell whoppers about the
United States, and appeal to slo
gans about which, demonstrably,
they are insincere, and (c), espe
rially (ei, that living under t lie
East German regime is like living
in a madhouse.
One might quarrel a little with
Grothe's standards of evidence;
one might wonder, at times,
whether a more impartial treat
ment of the data would have pro
duced a clearer picture; but most
ot the book's leaders, who 1 hope

will be many, will come away
from it vastly better informed
about why East Germans escape
from East Germany when they
get a chance to.
(And the point about the im
partial treatment, of course, is
that a more impartial young man
would not have taken the trouble
to research and write this book
Which Grotbe, who could presum
ably have taken on some less
thankless task, did.)
As for (2), (ho Ihe loathes the
Communists and, as I have hit)
mated, takes them seriously; he
belongs, therefore, to a priceless
maybe one-tenth ot one per cent
of his generation; may his tribe
increase, since it is proof that the
writers and teachers ol the gen
erations preceding his who have
sought and told the truth about
Communism have not done so en
tirely in vain (one can, lor exam
pie, actually imagine Grotbe be
ing willing to fight In a war per
isll the thought, but yes, in a Wai
against ('ommunism).
Suffice it to say that the next
step he must take in his via cru
els is to learn to dwell less on the
wickedness of Communism, about
which it is possible to convince
even a Liberal, and more on its
brilliant use of strategy and force.
As for (3), Grot he and I here
part company: he really believes,
one gathers, that it is a matter of
spending more money on US!A,
and letting it tell the"truth"
about America. Like most people
who believe that, however, and
like the people who staff lISIA
year in-year-out, he clearly wants
America to be made over (in his
image, of course) so that the
"truth" won't be quite 1 so unpal
atable to the keepers of our con
science abroad, quite so easy for
the Communists to "exploit."
He seems, in a word, to have
been propagandized a little him
self somewhere along the way
by some of "we."

lie gives a convincing picture
of how the East German propa
ganda machine functions, and
proves right up to the hilt, proves
to me anyhow, that (a) the East
German regime works away at its
propaganda mission, which is to
turn tfie East Germans into con
vinced Communists, with viin and
vigor, (b) that the men who dom
inate the machine are unscrupu
lous, tell whoppers about the
United States, and appeal to slo
gans about which, demonstrably,
they are insincere, and (c), espe
rially (ei, that living under t lie
East German regime is like living
in a madhouse.
One might quarrel a little with
Grothe's standards of evidence;
one might wonder, at times,
whether a more impartial treat
ment of the data would have pro
duced a clearer picture; but most
ot the book's leaders, who 1 hope

will be many, will come away
from it vastly better informed
about why East Germans escape
from East Germany when they
get a chance to.
(And the point about the im
partial treatment, of course, is
that a more impartial young man
would not have taken the trouble
to research and write this book
Which Grotbe, who could presum
ably have taken on some less
thankless task, did.)
As for (2), (ho Ihe loathes the
Communists and, as I have hit)
mated, takes them seriously; he
belongs, therefore, to a priceless
maybe one-tenth ot one per cent
of his generation; may his tribe
increase, since it is proof that the
writers and teachers ol the gen
erations preceding his who have
sought and told the truth about
Communism have not done so en
tirely in vain (one can, lor exam
pie, actually imagine Grotbe be
ing willing to fight In a war per
isll the thought, but yes, in a Wai
against ('ommunism).
Suffice it to say that the next
step he must take in his via cru
els is to learn to dwell less on the
wickedness of Communism, about
which it is possible to convince
even a Liberal, and more on its
brilliant use of strategy and force.
As for (3), Grot he and I here
part company: he really believes,
one gathers, that it is a matter of
spending more money on US!A,
and letting it tell the"truth"
about America. Like most people
who believe that, however, and
like the people who staff lISIA
year in-year-out, he clearly wants
America to be made over (in his
image, of course) so that the
"truth" won't be quite 1 so unpal
atable to the keepers of our con
science abroad, quite so easy for
the Communists to "exploit."
He seems, in a word, to have
been propagandized a little him
self somewhere along the way
by some of "we."
