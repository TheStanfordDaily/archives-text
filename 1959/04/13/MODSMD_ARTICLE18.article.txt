Kurds K.erum
hditor, The Daily:
The sensational report which
appeared on the front page of
The Daily of April 7, 1959, con
cerning the 855 Kurds returning
to Iraq needs a corrective com
ment .
These Kurds to begin with are
Iraqis returning home from the
IJ.S.S.R. where they have been in
exile since 1945. They are by no
means Russians imported in Iraq
by Premier Kassem to be includ
ed in the foreign legion which ex
ists oidy in the imagination of
the reporter who invented such a
thing.
The story of these Kurds goes
back to 1945 w hen they were com
pelled to carry arms against the
corrupted regime of the old Iraqi
monarchy demanding some badly
needed reforms.
The Iraqi armed forces backed
Ly the British R.A.F. carried out
a savage raid against these poor
mountainous people.
These Kurds, who belong to the
tnbe ol Barzan, had to reheat to
Iran where their treatment by the
Iranian armed forces compelled
them to ask the IJ.S.S.R. for po
litical asylum which was refused
at the beginning but which has
been later granted.
When the July Revolution sue
ceeded in Iraq, the new govern
ment, rightly, allowed all those
Iraqis who were in exile for any
reason, Including those Kurds, to
come back to their homeland and
resume their lives.
The Kurds, who make about
one-fifth of the liaqi population,
have been considered together
with the Arabs as "partners in
this nation and their national
lights within the unity of Iraq
aie recognized" by the interim
constitution according to its third
article.
11 less than a thousand Iraqis
come back to their own home
make an explosive contribution
to the cold war, the chances for

lasting in the whole world, there
fore, I think, are very bright.
Abbas Alnasrawi
Lippmann's Posil ion
Kditor, The Daily:
Thp arguments presenter] by
Waller Lippmann to substantiate
a Russian two - Germany policy
seem equally capable of support
ing an opposing point of view.
Typical Communist attitudes can
be adduced, for example, from the
flow of capita] back into Last
Germany. Anywhere the Commu
nists have directed economic or
ganization must always lie a spot
less showpiece. This kind of
dressing-up before the entrance
of the public or before there
lease of censored institutions of
speech is pari of a propaganda
system.
The once rigorously patrolled
boundary between Last and West
Berlin lias apparently assumed
minimum importance. An indif
ference to the movement of traf
fic could be indicative of a prepa
ration for reunification.
Other preparatory processes on
which Lippmann gives us no in
formation might also add prool
of this hypothesis for instance,
the movement ol political prison
ers and "deviationists." Their re
patriation would certainly remove
a source ot tree East German
clamor and demand which could
put Russia once again on the de
tensive against world opinion.
The fact thai we are no longei
being pushed to negotiate with
the Last German government,
that Last German sovereignty
has been completely dropped in
favor of a direct summit meet
ing, should show I hat the Berlin
crisis was only the Soviet's way
ol illustrating their readiness to
settle the German question.
I do not think lhat Lippmann
has concluded his case. JVor is my
own opinion necessarily very real
istic; but I do feel thai Lippmann
has not yet produced sufficient
prool foi his position.

The sensational report which
appeared on the front page of
The Daily of April 7, 1959, con
cerning the 855 Kurds returning
to Iraq needs a corrective com
ment .
These Kurds to begin with are
Iraqis returning home from the
IJ.S.S.R. where they have been in
exile since 1945. They are by no
means Russians imported in Iraq
by Premier Kassem to be includ
ed in the foreign legion which ex
ists oidy in the imagination of
the reporter who invented such a
thing.
The story of these Kurds goes
back to 1945 w hen they were com
pelled to carry arms against the
corrupted regime of the old Iraqi
monarchy demanding some badly
needed reforms.
The Iraqi armed forces backed
Ly the British R.A.F. carried out
a savage raid against these poor
mountainous people.
These Kurds, who belong to the
tnbe ol Barzan, had to reheat to
Iran where their treatment by the
Iranian armed forces compelled
them to ask the IJ.S.S.R. for po
litical asylum which was refused
at the beginning but which has
been later granted.
When the July Revolution sue
ceeded in Iraq, the new govern
ment, rightly, allowed all those
Iraqis who were in exile for any
reason, Including those Kurds, to
come back to their homeland and
resume their lives.
The Kurds, who make about
one-fifth of the liaqi population,
have been considered together
with the Arabs as "partners in
this nation and their national
lights within the unity of Iraq
aie recognized" by the interim
constitution according to its third
article.
11 less than a thousand Iraqis
come back to their own home
make an explosive contribution
to the cold war, the chances for

lasting in the whole world, there
