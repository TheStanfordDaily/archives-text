# Merriman Sparkles Despite Slow Start
## 
### Jacqueline Pattison 
Nan Merriman, mezzo-soprano,
| opened her Saturday night con
i cert with four old Spanish airs
i arranged by Joaquin Nin. While
the legato simplicity was charm-
I ing, it gave the concert a slow be
I ginning.
II was a pleasure to see pro
yrammed second the seldom-per
formed "Songs of a Wayfarer" by
tJuslav Mahler.
Unfortunately, during these
songs, Miss Merriman glanced
down a number of times at a slip
of paper apparently containing
the words. When she did so, the
i continuity of her phrasing was
often lost, the rests undramali
cally punctuating the phrases like
periods instead of commas,
Tiie slightly restless audience
wondered why such a good artist
had to refresh her memory dur
ing performance. Later, they for
' gol her faults, remembering in
| stead her magnificent, dark tones
land the stirring music itself.
In the "('h'io mi scordi di le"
' from "Marriage of Figaro," her
I technique and artistry unfolded
but her voice was still not quite
1 warmed up enough for several
| high staccato notes. In her encore
i before intermission, "E amore un
(.'adroncello" from "Co,si fan ltd
te," she masterfully combined
technical and interpretative skill,
completely winning her audience.
In the second half of the pro
grain, Miss Merriman handled the
Debussy with fine nuances. The
Havel "Vocalise" with its wide
range of techniques, including
fast passages and high and low
trills, proved her virtuosity, while
the Havel "Kaddisch" allowed her

to use her dramalic, luxuriant
tones.
Miss Merriman graciously sang
four encores.
The programming of all late
nineteenth and twentieth century
numbers and no classical or oper
alic alias except the one Mo/.uri
was unusual but not unpleasing.
After tlie weak beginning of
the concert, through the Mahler,
she threw herself into the num
bers and did each witli superb ex
cellence, leaving her captivated
audience with a line impression.
