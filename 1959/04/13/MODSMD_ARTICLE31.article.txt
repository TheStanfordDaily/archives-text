# Frosh Ballers Nip Two Foes
## 
### 
The Papoose baseball team in
creased its win string to four the
past week end as the frosh down
ed I-larry Ells High of Richmond,
5-3, and Jefferson High of Daly
City, 18-0.
The frosh had little of their
characteristic success with the bat
in the first game, but superb pitch
ing on the part of Toby 1 locker
and Roger Willett swung the bal
ance.
The Papooses were plagued by
fielding mistakes which almost
took them out of the win column.
The second game saw the frosh
strong in all departments. Stan
ford connected for 24 hits against
three pitchers, to give them IN
runs.
Papoose catcher Bob Overman
hit four times for five trips to the
plate, and shortstop O. J. Solander
helped the cause with a triple and
a home run.
