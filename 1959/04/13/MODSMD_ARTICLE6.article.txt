"Caring" was the answer given
by Dr. D. Elton Trueblood in his
sermon entitled "The Best Thing
One Person Can Do for Another"
at Memorial Church yesterday.
"Belief in another is one of the
most power I u 1 forces in the
world. All of us have more in us
than we see or anyone else sees;
we only need someone to open the
door of this potential."
Words Open the Door
Words rather than "things" are
the key to this door, stated the
former Stanford chaplain. Pri
mary to an individual is the
knowledge that someone has faith
in him. and expectancy usually
produces that which is expected.
"The four-minute mile contains
a parable that may apply to any
other phase of your life," said
Dr. Truebolod. "It was thought
that no one could ever run a four
minute mile; then about four
years ago it was achieved and
since has been run more than 40
times. It was caused by a change
in conviction; the milers did it
because they believed they could."
Sympathy
Sympathy is another phase of
caring, said the theologian, citing
an inscription on a bench placcd
by President Andrew White of
Cornell, adviser to Leland Stan
ford, stating, "For those who sit
here sorrowing, sympathy and
grief; so have wc done in our
time."
Dr. Trueblood, now professor
of philosophy at. Earlham College,
Richmond, Ind., was on the cam
pus yesterday while on his annual
trip to the Pacific Coast. He has
just completed a lecture series at
the College of the Pacific, and is
now at a Yokefellows retreat at
Asilomar. He also spoke last
night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
on "Christianity and Its Rivals"
in a talk sponsored by the Coun
cil on Religious Affairs."
Chaplain at Stanford from 1937
to 1945, Dr. Trueblood was ap
pointed the first chief of religious
policy for the U.S. Information
Agency by President Eisenhower
in 1954, a position he held for two
years.
