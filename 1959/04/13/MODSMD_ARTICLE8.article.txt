# Judy Wants Progressive Government
## 
### 
"Rome was not built in a day,"
and neither was Stanford, and
with respect to student, govern
ment, its foundations have barely
been laid. Student government
has, in the 1 past, enjoyed a medi
ocre effectiveness.
There are two basic reasons
why I feel this unfortunate situ
ation has persisted: student gov
ernment has lacked a progressive
outlook and it has lacked the uni
ty necessary in giving it a signifi
cantly powerful voice in Univer
sity policy.
Student government has lacked
the scope and planning necessary
for- it to keep pace with our rapid
ly changing University. The Stu
dent - Faculty Commission is a
good start toward alleviating this
problem, but its incorporation
with ST&T would, in effect, con
vert both organizations into a stu
dent-faculty long-range planning
commission and, as a result, give
a greater voice in the
direction in which Stanford will
travel.
We hope building will begin
soon on our new Student Union.
Student planning should be very
important in this endeavor'. A
student - faculty co - directorship
would better serve the needs of
the student body.
Student government is too de
centralized. The result has been
that the student voice in Univer
sity policies has lacked the unity
and strength to make it bear the
weight it justly deserves. The
president and the Cabinet should
serve as a central communicative
axis upon which the spokes of
student government revolve.
