Nominees were Anne Robinson and Sue Palmer for Women's
Council, Smith Ketchum for Class of '60 business manager, Stephen
Farrand for Class of '61 business manager, and Robert Burnett for

Class of '62 president.
As of yesterday, nobody had
filed for any of the LASSU repre
sentatives from Men's Row, Toy
on, Stern or off campus; for AWS
president, executive vice-president
or secretary; for one position on
Women's Council and two posi
tions on Men's Council; for Class
of '61 vice-president; for Class of
'62 vice - president or business
manager; or for WRA president,
vice - president, recording secre
tary, corresponding secretary or
treasurer.
Write-in Decides
If nobody files for these posi
tions before the 5 p.m. deadline
today, the positions will be decid
ed by a write-in vote.
Head yell leader candidate Sam
Reis, in response to questions
about his campaign, said yester
day, "I'm running because I think
the yell leading system has its
faults. One way of correcting
these faults is through entertain
ment. As an example, look at the
SC fiasco. The mass evacuation
could have been prevented by
changing the focus of interest to
the yell leading squad, through
witty comments (such as SC was
making) from the yell leaders
and audi en c c participation
through yells.
"Women Neglected"
"The women, as of now, are al
most neglected. "I'd suggest put
ting two of the yell leaders in
front of their section, so that they
would have the opportunity for
more participation.
"The lack of contact between
the student body and head yell
leader is another point. I'd like to
see a suggestion box for yells or
criticism put somewhere in the
ASSU, where students could sub
mit catchy yells, such as 'Bottle
Cap,' used, finally, at the Cal
game."
Another yell leader candidate,
Alan Creason, remarked, "Our
cheer leader must be cognizant of
desires of the student body who
will elect him the ability and de
sire to fulfill Hie obligation to his
electorate is his fundamental.
Apathy
"II you are one of the apathetic
who are irritated by ridiculous
yells at inopportune times, then
I represent you. I am your apa
thy candidate. I prefer to think
those who are accused of apathy
are merely indulging in ratiocina
tion."

Still another yell leader candi
date, George Tsongas, said, "I be
lieve that a yell leader should
strive toward the following goals:
• "Development of a unifying
school spirit and enthusiasm.
• "Recognizing the fact thai a
yell leader is a representative of
the student body, he must inquire
as to their wishes and carry them
out.
• "Development of increased
enthusiasm and leadership in all
the yell leaders.
Action, "Umph"
"A yell leader is picked for his
actions as well as his words.
There should be increased activ
ity on the field, on campus, and at
rallies as far as game entrances,
si lints, acrobatics and shorter
yells with more 'umph' are con
cerned.
"In order to verify my belief
that actions speak louder than
words, 1 will, if elected, push a
peanut around Quad with my
nose one foot for every vote I
get."
All candidates are requested to
file two pictures of themselves
with Elections Commission as
soon as possible, according to
chairman John Richards.
Due to a misunderstanding that
arose yesterday, Richards also
announced that all campaign post
ers, if they are to conform to
Election Commission and Pub Rel
regulations, must be no larger
than 11x11 inches.
