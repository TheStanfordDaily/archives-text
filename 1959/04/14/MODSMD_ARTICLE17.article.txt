## Access to Berlin 
### 
Editor's Note: Walter Lipp
maun has .just; returned from
Europe, where !»♦* has taken a
first-hand look at the Berlin
crisis. This is the third of a se
ries on the situation.
The preceding articles have
made the point that for the in
definite future the two German
slates cannot he reunited in one
German state with its capital in
Berlin. There will be the German
Federal Republic ol the West with
its capital at Bonn. And there will
be the German Democratic He
public of the East with its capital
at Pankow, which is a part of
East Beilirr. These two German
states now deal with one another
in many economic and technical
matters. Thus, for example, for
some considerable time West Ger
man traffic to West Berlin has
been controlled by the East Ger
man government. With the as
sent of Bonn it exercises the right
not only to stamp the identifica
tion papers but actually to inspect
the cargos.
There is every reason to sup
pose that there will b«' an in
creasing- intercourse and com
munication between the two
German states. But they do not
recognize each other as legal
ami legitimate sovereign stall's.
We must, therefore, accept the
fact that for years to come—it
might be for a generation or more
—these two German states will
have to live side by side with a
frontier on the line fixed by the
armistice which ended World War
11. From the frontier of East Ger
many to the city of Berlin is a
distance of 110 miles. The basic
problem is how to protect the
future of the West Berlin com
munity, which consists of two
and a half million people. They
must expect to live for an indef
inite future, perhaps for the rest
of their lives, in the heart of a
Communist state.
West B«*rlit»
In my view, the future of Wo«t
Berlin cannot be secured adequa
tely by a determination to stand
firm on a policy of standing pat.
No doubt, we can prevent the
Soviet Union and the East Ger
man government from blockading
West Berlin. We can threaten to
go to war if they do. But that is
riot good enough; West Berlin lies
in a strategic trap, and its secur
ity cannot be protected adequately
by military measures alone. It
can be secured against blockade
and outright aggression. But it
cannot be made secure against
harrassment and a perpetual war
of nerves and the feeling that
there is no hope.
West Berlin is a highly com
plicated economic arid political
community. It enjoys the in
stitution of private property.

There is free enterprise in in
vestment and in banking- and
in the management of capital.
ll' the division of Germany is
to last lor the indefinite future,
we must find ways to provide
the West Berlin community,
with a dependable order of
things. We cannot expect the
West Berliners to depend for
their whole security upon what
over the course of a generation
or more we may he able and
willing to do with our Strategic
Air Force.
The West Berliners cannot go
on for years wailing to hear what
the Pentagon will say about going
to war whenever an East German
official harasses them. There has

already been some considerable
flight of capital since the Khrush
chev note of last November, and
the economy of West Berlin will
wither if, whenever there is a
sign of trouble, the best wo can
do for il is to threaten World
War- 111.
New Status
My conviction is thai the future
ol West Berlin must be protected
not by standing pat but our in
sisting that West Berlin needs
and is entitled to have a new sta
tus. When Mr. K. tells us that
the present status of Berlin is
obsolete, it is a mistake for the
West to act as if any departure
from the status quo would be a
defeat and surrender. II might be
an improvement. At present the
status quo is from our point of
view extremely unsatisfactory.
The right answer- to Mr. K. is to
propose that we negotiate a new
charter or- statute in which West
Berlin is guaranteed an ordered
future by the presence of West
ern troops acting under interna
tional auspices.
