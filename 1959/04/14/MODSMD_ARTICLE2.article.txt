# West Seeks Gradual End of Atomic Tests
## 
### 
GENEVA (A 3 ) â€”The United States and Britain Monday proposed a prompt termination of atmospheric
and underwater nuclear tests but the initial Soviet reaction to the proposal was cool.
The new move was designed to tackle test suspension on a step-by-step basis and thus salvage
something from the three-power nuclear ban conference here. The Western powers hope agreement
can be reached on the easiest part of the problem first, with attempts in later negotiations to widen

the ban so as to include outer
space and underground blasts.
U.S. Ambassador James J.
Wadsworth and British Minister
of State Davifl . Ormsby - Gore
made it clear their governments
preferred a complete cessation of
all types of atomic and hydrogen
weapons tests.
Limited Agreement
But in view of the deadlocked
state of this conference, the West
ern powers proposed reaching
limited agreement first, with the
three powers binding themselves
to cease underwater testing and
testing weapons from the earth's
surface to an altitude of 30 miles.
These are the easiest types of
explosions to detect, and also the
sort which could present a great
er health hazard to the world's
population since they produce ra
dioactive fallout. Fallout is not
such a serious problem with un
derground and outer space blasts.
Rejection
If the Soviets finally reject the
Western initiative the conference,
which has been struggling with
the tost suspension problem since
Oct. 31. probably will break down,
high Western informants said.
The talks resumed Monday after
being in recess since March 1!).
After the 70 -minute meeting
Wadsworth told reporters: "We
believe that we have made a con
structive suggestion which gives
new hopes for these negotiations,
and we look forward to the Soviet
reaction with great interest."
But Soviet delegate Semyon
Tsarapkin came out of the closed
session wilh this comment: "It is
not acceptable. We have got to
stop everything."
