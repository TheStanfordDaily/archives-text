## Aid to Latin America: May Help Both Sides 
### Lester O'Shea 
Despite much progress, Latin
America is to a large extent eco
nomically backward today, many
of its people's lives not differing
substantially from those of their
ancestors of Spanish colonial or
even pre-Columbian times.
Those who are aware of the
20th century and what it offers
(and this as a rule includes those
who govern) generally seek na
lional progress and higher* stand
ards of living through economic
progress. This, as everyone
knows, requires capital, since one
must produce more in order to
have more and usually requires i
better tools to so produce.
Further Links
What economic progress in
Latin America can mean is that
that area, so long bound to the
United States by economic ties
and common background (in
terms of origin) and ideals, will
be further so linked: with devel
opment, it can sell more to the
United States, and consequonty
buy more from it; in the process,
American capital can find fields
for profitable investment.
On both sides, thus, there can
be great benefit, with an increase
iir inlereultural understanding j
and the closer binding of Latin:
American states to the United j
Slates through sharing its sys
tem of entrepreneurial capitalism
instead of operating on a pre-capi
talist basis. Latin America will
become economically developed;
and, from an American point of
view, it is all to the good if in the
process profits are made and the
area is linked more closely to the
United States.
Threats Exist
Certain threats to the orderly
flow of mutual benefit and prog
ress exist. Involved in the first
place is the imposition of restric
tions upon the importation of
Latin American products (such
as Venezuelan oil). Such tariffs
or' quotas undoubtedly may bene
fit particular industries in the
United States; but they are harm
ful to both the foreign nation in
volved and Americans as a whole
(as consumers). In addition to
these economic effects, political
repercussions are likely: as a case

in point one may look at the Ve
nezuelan attacks on Vice-Presi
dent Nixon.
industrial development itself
car ries with ii certain hindrances
to progress and harmony. Neces
sarily, it involves the development
of an urban working class (the
Marxian proletariat), cut off
11<it11 old cultural ties and author
ities and presented with what
may be rather unpleasant factory
work under an employer with
whom there is no personal con
tact or t ela! ionship.
backbone of Movements
It is this usually well-organized
class which forms the backbone
of radical movements in Latin
America; radical movements
which often involve dislike for
both capitalism and the Uniled
States, as well as a tendency to
kill the golden egg laying goose.
For it is by no means rare for
such movements to lead to action
against foreign- capital: hence
such things as the expropriation,
a few years ago, of the Bolivian
tin mines. Obviously, such action
necessarily discourages the in
vestment of capital in Iho coun
try and thus both deprives foreign
capital of profits and hamper's the
country's economic; growth and
ihe development of higher stand
ards of living: in this case, what
is good for foreign capital is gen
erally also good for the country
involved.
In sum, then, economic develop
ment and advancement in Latin
America can be more efficiently
or less efficiently accomplished;
it can be more beneficial or less
beneficial to the United Stales. It
would seem desirable, all around,
that the United States employ a
liberal trade policy toward Latin
America and act as effectively as
it can to induce countries in that
area to permit capital foreign
and domestic to operate unmo
lested.
