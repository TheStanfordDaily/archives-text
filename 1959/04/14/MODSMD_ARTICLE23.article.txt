# Century Even in Saturday Meet
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Stanford hosts Oregon and Southern California Saturday at 10
a.in. in what stacks np as perhaps tin* best dual-triangular track
and field competition ever held in Stanford Stadium. In a three
part series, the meet will he examined event-by-event, entry-hy
entry. Today: Hie straightaway raees.

In so far as team balance is concerned, the most even competition
in Saturday morning's Stanford-Oregon-USC meet may well come
in I he 100-yard dash.
Each team boasts an outstanding sprinter and each has strong
1 cental line strength, making the 100 difficult to predict.
(JSC's Angelo Coia, Oregon's Hoscoe Cook and Stanford's Dean
Smith look like Ihe hest bets for the top three spots. Coia, alter in
action caused by an injury, returned last Saturday and promptly
upset California's Willie White in the 100.
Coia won both sprints against Cal with times of 9.9 and 21.7
not world-healing, but indicative that he's ready for faster compe
tition after his layoff.
Cook has the best 1959 time of the field, 9.7. Even as a high
schooler two years ago he ran 9.4w. Cook is a short runner who
puffs like a locomotive.
After a slow start, Smith has responded with 100 and 220 victories
at UCLA a week ago, and with 100 and low hurdle wins against
Fresno Stale Saturday. He'll confine his dash efforts to the 100 this
week, where he clocked 9.9 last time out.
A group of 9.9ers will round out the 100 field. For USC, it's Hill
Jackson, better known as a 24-foot-plus broad-jumper, for Stanford
it's Norm I'ease and for Oregon it's Steve Anderson and Dave Gray
sod. Of this group, Anderson probably bears the most watching.
Coia, Cook and Pease will all be in the 220 as well, but will prob

ably have to take a back seat to Troy's Bobby Staten. Staten, a <17.0
quarter-miler, has a blistering 20.9 to his credit this year against
Occidental.
Staten and Cook were teammates at San Diego JC last year, both
running on record-shattering sprint relay teams.
Coia and Cook have each run 21.7 this year, while Pease and
Jim Norval of Oregon have posted 21. C's. Any of the four could place
as high as second.
The high hurdles should furnish a close two-man fight between
Charlie Dumas of the Trojans and Dave Edstrom ot Oregon. Each,
oddly enough, is better known for some other event Dumas in the
high jump and Edstrom in the decathlon.
Dumas, however, has already gotten down to 11.2 and Edstrom
has clocked 11.4. No one from Stanford should threaten these two,
nor does anyone from either of the other two teams look capable
of winning.
Stanford's best point hope is sophomore Bob Martin. In his first
outing Saturday, he ran 15.;"), but would have gotten borne in about
15.0 had he not smacked the tenth hurdle badly. Most anything
could happen from third place on back, however.
Anderson and Smith from the 100 field, ami Staten, Dumas or
both, appear to be the best of the 220 low hurdles contingent.
Anderson, sixth in the 1958 NCAA meet, has a seasonal best of
23.5, the same as Staten. Smith ran 23.9 against Fresno State, but
is new to the event and has shown marked improvement every time
(jut. Dumas hasn't yet run the lows this spring, but will probably
show up at the starting line.
The principal strike against Staten's appearing in the lows is that
he would be unable to then anchor the relay. With him on anchor,
Troy would probably win easily without him, it would be neck
and-neck with the Indians.

I)KAN SMITH
He'll run in both the 10(1 and

Stanford hosts Oregon and Southern California Saturday at 10
a.in. in what stacks np as perhaps tin* best dual-triangular track
and field competition ever held in Stanford Stadium. In a three
part series, the meet will he examined event-by-event, entry-hy
entry. Today: Hie straightaway raees.

In so far as team balance is concerned, the most even competition
in Saturday morning's Stanford-Oregon-USC meet may well come
in I he 100-yard dash.
Each team boasts an outstanding sprinter and each has strong
1 cental line strength, making the 100 difficult to predict.
(JSC's Angelo Coia, Oregon's Hoscoe Cook and Stanford's Dean
Smith look like Ihe hest bets for the top three spots. Coia, alter in
action caused by an injury, returned last Saturday and promptly
upset California's Willie White in the 100.
Coia won both sprints against Cal with times of 9.9 and 21.7
not world-healing, but indicative that he's ready for faster compe
tition after his layoff.
Cook has the best 1959 time of the field, 9.7. Even as a high
schooler two years ago he ran 9.4w. Cook is a short runner who
puffs like a locomotive.
After a slow start, Smith has responded with 100 and 220 victories
at UCLA a week ago, and with 100 and low hurdle wins against
Fresno Stale Saturday. He'll confine his dash efforts to the 100 this
week, where he clocked 9.9 last time out.
A group of 9.9ers will round out the 100 field. For USC, it's Hill
Jackson, better known as a 24-foot-plus broad-jumper, for Stanford
it's Norm I'ease and for Oregon it's Steve Anderson and Dave Gray
sod. Of this group, Anderson probably bears the most watching.
Coia, Cook and Pease will all be in the 220 as well, but will prob

ably have to take a back seat to Troy's Bobby Staten. Staten, a <17.0
quarter-miler, has a blistering 20.9 to his credit this year against
Occidental.
Staten and Cook were teammates at San Diego JC last year, both
running on record-shattering sprint relay teams.
Coia and Cook have each run 21.7 this year, while Pease and
Jim Norval of Oregon have posted 21. C's. Any of the four could place
as high as second.
The high hurdles should furnish a close two-man fight between
Charlie Dumas of the Trojans and Dave Edstrom ot Oregon. Each,
oddly enough, is better known for some other event Dumas in the
high jump and Edstrom in the decathlon.
Dumas, however, has already gotten down to 11.2 and Edstrom
has clocked 11.4. No one from Stanford should threaten these two,
nor does anyone from either of the other two teams look capable
of winning.
Stanford's best point hope is sophomore Bob Martin. In his first
outing Saturday, he ran 15.;"), but would have gotten borne in about
15.0 had he not smacked the tenth hurdle badly. Most anything
could happen from third place on back, however.
Anderson and Smith from the 100 field, ami Staten, Dumas or
both, appear to be the best of the 220 low hurdles contingent.
Anderson, sixth in the 1958 NCAA meet, has a seasonal best of
23.5, the same as Staten. Smith ran 23.9 against Fresno State, but
is new to the event and has shown marked improvement every time
(jut. Dumas hasn't yet run the lows this spring, but will probably
show up at the starting line.
The principal strike against Staten's appearing in the lows is that
he would be unable to then anchor the relay. With him on anchor,
Troy would probably win easily without him, it would be neck

he would be unable to then anchor the relay. With him on anchor,
Troy would probably win easily without him, it would be neck
and-neck with the Indians.

He'll run in both the 10(1 and
lows on Saturday
Stanford hosts Oregon and Southern California Saturday at 10
a.in. in what stacks np as perhaps tin* best dual-triangular track
and field competition ever held in Stanford Stadium. In a three
part series, the meet will he examined event-by-event, entry-hy
entry. Today: Hie straightaway raees.

In so far as team balance is concerned, the most even competition
in Saturday morning's Stanford-Oregon-USC meet may well come
in I he 100-yard dash.
Each team boasts an outstanding sprinter and each has strong
1 cental line strength, making the 100 difficult to predict.
(JSC's Angelo Coia, Oregon's Hoscoe Cook and Stanford's Dean
Smith look like Ihe hest bets for the top three spots. Coia, alter in
action caused by an injury, returned last Saturday and promptly
upset California's Willie White in the 100.
Coia won both sprints against Cal with times of 9.9 and 21.7
not world-healing, but indicative that he's ready for faster compe
tition after his layoff.
Cook has the best 1959 time of the field, 9.7. Even as a high
schooler two years ago he ran 9.4w. Cook is a short runner who
puffs like a locomotive.
After a slow start, Smith has responded with 100 and 220 victories
at UCLA a week ago, and with 100 and low hurdle wins against
Fresno Stale Saturday. He'll confine his dash efforts to the 100 this
week, where he clocked 9.9 last time out.
A group of 9.9ers will round out the 100 field. For USC, it's Hill
Jackson, better known as a 24-foot-plus broad-jumper, for Stanford
it's Norm I'ease and for Oregon it's Steve Anderson and Dave Gray
sod. Of this group, Anderson probably bears the most watching.
Coia, Cook and Pease will all be in the 220 as well, but will prob

ably have to take a back seat to Troy's Bobby Staten. Staten, a <17.0
quarter-miler, has a blistering 20.9 to his credit this year against
Occidental.
Staten and Cook were teammates at San Diego JC last year, both
running on record-shattering sprint relay teams.
Coia and Cook have each run 21.7 this year, while Pease and
Jim Norval of Oregon have posted 21. C's. Any of the four could place
as high as second.
The high hurdles should furnish a close two-man fight between
Charlie Dumas of the Trojans and Dave Edstrom ot Oregon. Each,
oddly enough, is better known for some other event Dumas in the
high jump and Edstrom in the decathlon.
Dumas, however, has already gotten down to 11.2 and Edstrom
has clocked 11.4. No one from Stanford should threaten these two,
nor does anyone from either of the other two teams look capable
of winning.
Stanford's best point hope is sophomore Bob Martin. In his first
outing Saturday, he ran 15.;"), but would have gotten borne in about
15.0 had he not smacked the tenth hurdle badly. Most anything
could happen from third place on back, however.
Anderson and Smith from the 100 field, ami Staten, Dumas or
both, appear to be the best of the 220 low hurdles contingent.
Anderson, sixth in the 1958 NCAA meet, has a seasonal best of
23.5, the same as Staten. Smith ran 23.9 against Fresno State, but
is new to the event and has shown marked improvement every time
(jut. Dumas hasn't yet run the lows this spring, but will probably
show up at the starting line.
The principal strike against Staten's appearing in the lows is that
he would be unable to then anchor the relay. With him on anchor,
Troy would probably win easily without him, it would be neck
and-neck with the Indians.
