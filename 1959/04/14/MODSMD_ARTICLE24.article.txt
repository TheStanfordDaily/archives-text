led the Stanford shell before the

fore losing to the locals by one
length. Both SC and Long Beach
led the Stanford shell before the
Indians caught up by understrok
ing their rivals 29 to 32. At the
end of the half-mile mark, SC
lipped their count to 34, but Stan
ford matched the stroke and went
on to win. Long Beach finished
two lengths behind the winnei-s
with Orange Coast six lengths be
hind Long Beach.
The head wind thai hampered
the varsity was not as strong
during the frosh race, and it blew
toward the bow quarter rather
i than directly into the bow of the
j boats. Even so, the freshmen's
! winning time of 0:5-1 was cons id
erably slower than their 6:07
mark at Redwood City the week
! end before.
All crews will have a break
from active competition until
Stanford travels to Corvallis for
a dual race with Oregon Stale on
I Saturday, April 25.
