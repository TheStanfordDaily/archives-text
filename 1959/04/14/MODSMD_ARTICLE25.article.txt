# Meet the Cards
## 
### 
Magee, a sophomore, is prob
ably Hie most versatile player
on the learn. Started the season
us a catcher but has been
shifted to second base where he
has played quite adequately.
Can also play the outfield. A
good clutch hitter, Magee had
several scouts after him on his
graduation from high school.
Major: Education.

Newkirk. now a senior, is the
most experienced of this year's
players. Won first base job two
years ago and has held it since.
Hit a strong .321 last year with
three home runs out of the
S u nken Diamond. A great
glovcman, Newkirk has yet to
begin hitting at his best this
year but is always dangerous.
Major: Economics.
