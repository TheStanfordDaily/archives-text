THE CARE AND FEEDING OF ROOM-MATES
Room-mates are not only heaps of fun, but lliey are also very
educational, for the proper study of mankind is man, and there
is no better way to learn the dreams and drives of another man
than to share a room with him.
This being the case, it is wise not to keep the same room
male. too long, because the more room-mates you have, the
more you will know about (lie dreams and drives of your
fellow man. So try to change room-mates as often as you can.
A recent study made by Sigafoos of Princeton shows that the
best interval for changing room-mates is every four hours.
How do you choose a room-mate? Most counselors agree
that the most important thing to look for in room-mates is that
they be people of regular habits. This, I say, i* arrant nonsense.
What if one of their regular habits happens to be beating a
Chinese gong from midnight to dawn? Or growing cultures in
your tooth glass? Or reciting the Articles of War?

Regular habits, my fool! The must, important quality in a,
room-in,tie is (hat he should he exactly your size. Otherwise
you will have to have his clothes altered to fit you, which can
be a considerable nuisance. In fact, it is sometimes flatly im
possible. I recollect one time I roomed with a man named
()>age Tremblatt who was just under seven feet tall and weighed
nearly four hundred pounds. There wasn't a, blessed thing I
could use in his entire wardrobe —until one night when I was
invited (o ;i masquerade party. I cut one leg off a pair of Trein
blatt's trousers, jumped into it, sewed up both ends, and went
(o (lie party as a bolster. I took second prize. First prize went
to a girl named Antenna Radnitz who poured molasses over
her head and went as a candied apple.
But I digress, bet us turn back to the qualities that make
desirable room-mates. Not the least of these is the cigarettes
they smoke. When we bum cigarettes, do we want them to be
shoddy and nondescript? Certainly not! We want them to be
distinguished, gently reared, zestful and zingy. And what ciga
rette is distinguished, gently reared, zestful and zingy? Why,
Philip Morris, of corris! Any further questions?
To go on. In selecting a room-mate, find someone who will
wear well, whom you'd like to keep as a permanent friend.
Many of history's great friendships first started in college. Are
you aware, for example, of the remarkable fact that Johnson
and Boswell were room-mates at Oxford in 1712? What makes
(bis fact so remarkable is that in 1712 Johnson was only three
years old and Boswell had not yet been born. But, of course,
children matured earlier in those days. Take Mozart, who
wrote his first symphony at four. Or Titian, who painted his
first masterpiece at five. Or Hanso Felbgung, who was in many
ways the most remarkable of all; he was appointed chief of the
Copenhagen police department at the age of six!
It must be admitted, however, that he did badly. Criminals
roamed the city, robbing and looting at will. They knew little
llanso would never pursue them —he was not allowed to cross
the street.
