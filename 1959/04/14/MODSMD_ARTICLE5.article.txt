# SC Group Decides Man Is a Cube
## 
### 
Man really isn't a square he's
more of a three-dimensional cube.
His intellectual width, length
and depth have been measured by
a psychology research group at
| the University of Southern Cali
fornia, which h;is concluded that
the 50-year Pavlovian stimulus
response method of vocational
and educational testing must be
modernized.
This was revealed last night by
Dr. .1. P. Guilford, (JSC professor,
at the annual Walter V. Bingham
Memorial Lecture.
Dr. Guilford, a widely • recog
nized American psychologist, re
vealed how he and his researchers
developed a model three-dimen
sional cube called a "structure of
intellect," with each dimension
representing a way in which
man's intellectual abilities differ.
Analysis of parallel intellectual
factors, he said, "shows that as
sessment of man's intellectual re
sources should be in the form «f
multiple scores and profiles of
scores, instead of the one or two
scores that have been custom
ary."
"We have been attempting to
measure in one dimension that
which is actually multi-dimension
al," he said.
Guilford also said lhat "empha
sis should be placed on varieties
of information and the ways in
which the human organization
deals with information, rather
than upon the behavioristic, stim
ulus-response model that has pre
vailed in psychology for half a
century,"
Adoption of the new testing
method should result in better
preparation of college students to
face today's problems "by achiev
ing in education a better balance
between creative thinking and
'parrot' thinking on the one hand,
and creative thinking and critical
thinking on the other," he con
cluded.
