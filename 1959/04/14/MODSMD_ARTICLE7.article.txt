# U.S. Air Force Launches 'Discoverer' into Orbit

VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASIC, Calif. (/P) America's sccond
Discoverer satellite roared southward into polar orbit yesterday, set
ting the stage for ;■ gigantic game of aerial catch in which planes
may try to snatch its parachuting nose cone from the air.
Two hours after the launching an Advanced Research Projects

Agency spokesman said tracking
stations in Alaska, Hawaii and at
this West Coast missile base had
established that Discoverer II is
in orbit.
Minute Orbit
The 1600 • pound satellite is
whirling around the earth in a
nearly north-south orbit every 94
minutes. At its high point it is
Mo miles from earth, its clos
est 158.
Within 12 hours, William H.
Godel, director of planning for
4R1 J A, said, they will be able to
determine if the orbit meets re
quirements for an attempt to re
cover the satellite's instrumented
nose cone.
Catch Nose ('one
If all goes well, the nose cone
will be ejected, Tuesday or later,
over the Pacific near Hawaii.
There CI 19 Flying Boxcars, trail
ing trapeze-like devices, hope to
snag the capsule's parachute in
the air.
Before the launching one ex
pert guessed the chance of recov
ery at 1 in 10(30.
Such capsules, in future shots
of the Discoverer satellite series,
will contain mice and monkeys.
They will be used to determine
the effects of such perils as radi
ation, heat and gravity stress so
that man may follow them into
space.
Launching Delayed
Fog delayed the launching for
three hours and 38 minutes.
There was patchy fog as the 78-
foot rocket roared skyward, but
upper altitudes were clear. The
engine of the first-stage rocket, a
Thor, apparently functioned per
fectly for' its 2 V->-minute life.
After a period of coasting, the
second-stage Bell-Hustler engine
took over 1 for another 2\» min
utes.
In the nose cone of the second
stage was a 160-pound capsule
shaped like an ice cream cone
with its tip cut off —17 inches
long and 33 inches in diameter at
the widest point.
Planes Train
After its eviction, the eight Ha
waii-based CI I9's, which report
er! ly have been training for
weeks, will play their aerial game
of catch with the capsule.
Each plane is equipped with
two telescoping 15 - foot poles,
which trail down from each side
of the fuselage. The pole tips are
30 feet apart and between them
is a nylon harness designed to
snag the capsule's parachute as
the plane flies over it. Once
snagged, the capsule can be reeled
in.
10 Minutes
The planes will have about 10
minutes to make their passes. If
they fail, destroyers will try to
fish the buoyant capsule from the
sea.
The recovery capsule contained
equipment 1o supply oxygen, reg
ulate pressure and control tem
perature. It also contained vari
ous film packs to record cosmic
radiation in <Httcr space. This in
formation will not be radioed
back, so the capsule must lie re
covered to obtain it.
