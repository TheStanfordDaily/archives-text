# Ike Delays Decision On Dulles
## 
### 
WASHINGTON </P) President
Eisenhower delayed a decision
Monday on John Foster Dulles'
future as Secretary of State.
Doctors will make an effort to
check Dulles' cancer by new mcdi
ca treatment.
Most administration leaders
were gloomy about the prospects
Dulles could win his fight. They
expected he would resign shortly,
perhaps within a comparatively
few days.
Dulles' condition aroused imme
diate concern in Congress about
who will represent the United
States at the foreign ministers'
meeting in Geneva May 11.
"lie Would Resign"
Senator George Aiken (R-Vt.)
said that unless Dulles is able
to resume full-time work by that
date, "I would expect he would
resign."
"I don't think the country can
go on and on without an active
head of the State Department,"
Aiken said.
Aiken was saying in effect that
an acting secretary could not
stand on an equal footing at Ge
neva with the ministers of the
Soviet Union and the Western al
lies of the United States.
Ike Worried
Eisenhower, who is reported
very worried about Dulles, gave
no clue to the future after a 45*
minute visit with Dulles at Wal
ter Reed Army Hospital.
Dulles, 71, worn and haggard,
returned to the hospital Sunday
after cutting short a rest stay in
Florida.
During his Florida visit, Dulles
apparently failed to regain the
strength he had when he was a
full-time architect and champion
of administration foreign policy,
a post he has filled for six years.
