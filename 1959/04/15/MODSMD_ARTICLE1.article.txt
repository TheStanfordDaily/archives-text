## Noel-Baker Advocates Arms Cuts 
### Lynn DeLargey 
Speaking with feeling of the
death by incendiary bombs of 140,-
000 inhabitants of Japan in 1945,
Philip Noel-Baker said last night
that "it is time these sacrifices
ended and it is our task now to
try."
A former British emissary to
both II"' League of Nations and
the United Nations, Noel-Baker
said in his Tuesday Series lecture
(»ii "Disarmament" that "the West
ern governments ought to take
new initiative for making bold
proposals for arms reduction," or
even for total disarmament.
Arms Inspection
Tie suggested that Western na
tions write out in treaty form de
tailed specifications for reduction
of manpower and conventional
weapons as well as for complete
abolition of nuclear weapons and
stockpiles. These nations should
develop plans for arms inspection
and control and then "ask other
nations to propose whatever
amendments they chose."
He said that in 1955 Soviet Pre
mier Nikita Khrushchev found ac
ceptable such disarmament pro
posals, as Noel-Baker sketched
them for him, including abolition
of nuclear weapons and stockpiles,
providing adequate controls were
arranged.
Noel-Baker thinks Western na
tions should still try to negotiate
such a total disarmament, includ
ing cuts in manpower to one mil
lion men each for the U.S., the
U.S.S.R. and China and drastic
cuts in military budgets.
Markets Enough
After talking with industrial
leaders such as the head of the
Rolls-Royce company in England,
Noel-Baker feels sure that indus
try can find enough markets with
out relying on government spend
ing for weapons.
One hope for disarmament is
apparent: people in South Amer
ica. in the Bandung Conference
countries and in Russia and Po
land now speak first of their con
cern for arms reduction. "Govern
ments have begun to see that they
must help their people get real
peace." Noel - Baker concluded
from his recent travels.

abolition of nuclear weapons and
stockpiles. These nations should
develop plans for arms inspection
and control and then "ask other
nations to propose whatever
amendments they chose."
He said that in 1955 Soviet Pre
mier Nikita Khrushchev found ac
ceptable such disarmament pro
posals, as Noel-Baker sketched
them for him, including abolition
of nuclear weapons and stockpiles,
providing adequate controls were
arranged.
Noel-Baker thinks Western na
tions should still try to negotiate
such a total disarmament, includ
ing cuts in manpower to one mil
lion men each for the U.S., the
U.S.S.R. and China and drastic
cuts in military budgets.
Markets Enough
After talking with industrial
leaders such as the head of the
Rolls-Royce company in England,
Noel-Baker feels sure that indus
try can find enough markets with
out relying on government spend
ing for weapons.
One hope for disarmament is
apparent: people in South Amer
ica. in the Bandung Conference
countries and in Russia and Po
land now speak first of their con
cern for arms reduction. "Govern
ments have begun to see that they
must help their people get real
peace." Noel - Baker concluded
from his recent travels.
