## Satellite Troubles Multiply

WASHINGTON (/b Frustrat
ing mechanical bugs Tuesday
wreckcd an attempt to fire an At
las intercontinental missile and
upset hopes for a spectacular ae
| rial catch of a capsule from the
satellite Discoverer 11.
Another trouble, overcast skies,
forced postponement of an at
tempt to launch a Thor interme
diate range ballistic missile with
an all-British crew from Vanden
berg Air Force Base, Calif. The
1500 - mile • range missile will be
fired when weather permits, pos
sibly today.
Jolt Blamed
Failure of Monday night's ef
fort to launch a new type Van
guard was blamed on a severe .jolt
that sent the rocket off course,
although t lie exact cause was not
known. The two instrumented
satellites it carried popped out
prematurely at an altitude of 200
miles and t he shattered Vanguard
plunged into the sea off Cape
Canaveral, Fla.
Air Force scientists said that a
faulty timing device prevented
them from going ahead with an
attempt to catch the capsule from
Discoverer 11. which was
launched Monday from Vanden
berg Air Force Basc„ Until the
bug was discovered it had ap
peared that the first fully success
ful polar orbiting satellite was
whizzing along without any hitch.
Long Shot
The scientists had called the re
i covery try a 1000-1 shot anyway.
Because of the faulty timing de
vice, they said, the capsuc would
fall north of the area where Ha
waii-based planes were poised to
try to grab it as the capsule para
chuted down.
However, the experts planned
to eject the capsule anyway, as a
test of its equipment. Tracking
stations in Alaska will try to mon
itor the sequence of these events.
The second stage of the Discov
erer, minus the capsule, will con
tinue in orbit around the South
• and North Poles.
