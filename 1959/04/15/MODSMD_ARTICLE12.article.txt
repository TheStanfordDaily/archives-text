University Position
In a previous statement the
University clarified its participa
tion in the student loan program
with this statement from Assist
ant. to the President Frederick
Glover: "It was the University's
initial conclusion that to refuse
to participate in the program was
to deny aid to students whose
needs could not be met by other
University resources."
The University has made no
comment on other parts of the
Ad which include funds for the
establishment of a language train
ing program and a guidance train
ing program, among other things.
It is known that they have applied
for these grants. They are still
negotiating with the government
to determine (he implementation
of these programs and whether or
not faculty people would be re
quired to sign the oaths to partici
pate in ihc projects, Glover told
The Daily yesterday.
