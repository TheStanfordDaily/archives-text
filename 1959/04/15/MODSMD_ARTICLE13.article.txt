Yell Leader
Walt Jue, candidate for head
yell leader, submitted a statement
to The Daily yesterday in which
he said. "As an assistant a year
ago, I found yell leading a very
enjoyable and rewarding experi
ence. I'd like to have this oppor
tunity again, only this time as
head yell leader.
"To me, yell leading is a game
you play with the rooting section,
using the yell leaders, the teams
and the opposing rooting section
as the elements. As for the yell
leaders, they should entertain the
section by good yells and clever
entrances, and, most of all, be en
thusiastic themselves.
Keep Ahead
"Interesting episodes could be
obtained from the team through
closer contact with them. As far
as the opposing rooting section is
concerned, a head yell leader tries
to keep one step ahead of them.
"I believe these three objectives
could be obtained by careful se
lection of yell leaders who have
the time and the enthusiasm for
this little game.' I have the abil
ity to work with and entertain the
rooting section, and most of all to
lead yells —the right yells— at the
right time."
