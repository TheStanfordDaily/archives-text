# Pre-Sophomore Year Rushing Suggested

Du.vvi I) Hi stltv; makes Stanford's rush system better than most

lacing (lit 1 added problems of rusli hut this system is lar I rum
perfect and leaves much In he desired.
To correct these serious im perfeclitms, ire urge that
rushing be liehl a week heft>re the sophomtwe yeui urnl
that lhe no-contact rule, hr ctnn pletely tliscartletl.
Basically, rushing has two functions lo perform: first, to give
freshmen an accurate picture of alliliated living and a good view
of the individual fraternities and chilis I rom which they may
chouse; and, second, lo give the fraternities and clulis the oppor
tunity to secure new members.
The present series of open houses and parties doesn I satisfac
torily achieve these two purposes.
Under this system there simply isn I enough time during the
open houses iri the evenings for freshmen to visit all of the houses
and elubs, let alone meet enough of the men lo form anything hut
a nebulous impression. Time also restricts the number of parties
that a freshman can attend, and as a result he can only become
partially familiar with two or three houses at the most.
Irishmen don't get an accurate picture of the houses
and tluhs, because they tlon'l see thorn in their natural
condition.
IN or is the situation much better for the fraternities and clubs
themselves. Assuming there has been no contact with the fresh
men before rushing starts with the possible exception of a mem
ber having known the prospective pledge in high school it is
difficult to see how a "good* pledge class could he selected. How
is a valid choice possible by the fraternities when anywhere from
50 to 150 freshmen file through a house in a couple of hours each
night?
The benefits t>f an iritensire rush period that doesn t
conflict with anything else, u ice eh- bt fore autumn quarter,
should be readily apparent. Hush activities could he tar
ried on through the daw in addition rt> evenings. I his
would provide more time for rushees to visit houses ami
clubs, a nil more time for freshmen to gel to know the
fraternity and club men better. Consequently, the choice
of affiliation would be based on something more than a
fleeting glance and a "what'.s your major?'"' uiteri iew.
Houses and clubs, of course, would also have a chance to he
come better acquainted with the rushees.
An open-house period for eating clubs like first few days of
autumn quarter might be included, in addition to their regular
rush activities during the rush week. This would allow students
who are interested onlv in eating clubs to have the chance to join
them without going through the entire rush procedure.
I lie elimination of the no-contact rule n tmltl facilitate
« student's deciding iclu tlier t>r ru>t to come back for the
rush period, as he icttuld hare litul a brief, informal look
at clubs antl fraternities during his freshman year.
Legislature has established an investigatory committee to study
this entire problem. We hope the committee will consider this
proposal and that Legislature will take firm, positive action on
the problems of the present rush system. 11 is badly in need of
revamping.
