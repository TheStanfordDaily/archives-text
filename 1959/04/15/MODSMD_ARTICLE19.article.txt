# Tonight at the Symphony
## Rubinstein to Play Brahms 
### Diana Smith 
Artur Rubinstein, a worldly
and human pianist who is above
all remarkable musically and
personallyâ€”joins the San Fran
cisco Symphony tonight for the
Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2 in
B flat major. Truly a giants'
meeting: Rubinstein's technical
and interpretive resources are
staggering, and the li flat major
Concerto is an immensely propor
tioned work of Brahms' stylistic

and creative maturity.
Rubinstein has recorded this
concerto with Charles Munch and
the Boston Symphony.
Gaining its first West Coast
hearing is Edmund Haines' Con
certino lor Seven Solo Instru
ments and Orchestra, which was
initially performed only this Jan
uary. It was written for the

American Music Center Commis- i
sioning Series under a Ford j
Foundation grant.
Haines was awarded a Pulitzer
Prize for his first symphony in
1941, and has been head of t lie ;
teaching of composition at the j
University of Michigan's music j
department.
Beethoven's Overture to his he- j
roil* and allegorical ballet "Pro- j
metheus." Op. 13. is listed first on ,
this week's program. One of his |
earliest overtures, it has gener- j
ally attracted less attention than, j
for example, Ihe "Leonore"
group.
The Haines' Concertino comes
second, and following it the Intro- I
duction and March from Rimsky- ,
Korsakoff's "Le Coq d'Or." "The
Golden Cockerel" is a bird sup-1
posed to warn one King Dodon of
approaching danger with the flap
ping of its wings; the creature is
the king's eventual undoing. Rim
sky-Korsiikofl has told the story,
of which tonight's audience will j
hear the beginning, in a charac- j
teristic combination of Russian
tradition and personal fantasia.
