# New "post-grad" program helps engineers move ahead at Western Electric
## 
### 
Careers get off to a fast start — and keep on
crowing — at Western Electric.
One big help is our new Graduate Engineer
ing Training Program. This unique full-time,
ofT-the-job study program starts soon after you
join Western Electric ... continues throughout
your career. Students are offered courses in vari
ous fields including semiconductors, computers,
feedback control systems, and problem solving
techniques. What's more, they study methods
for improving skills in communicating technical
information and the art of getting ideas across.
You'll find the work at Western Electric
stimulating, too. As manufacturing and supply
unit of the Bell System, we pioneered in the pro
duction of (he transistor, repeatered submarine
cable, and the provision of microwave telephone
and television facilities spanning the country.
I ngineering skills can't help developing—careers
can't help prospering — in the lively, exciting
technical climate at Western Electric.
Western Electric technical fields include mechanical, elec
trical, chemical, civil and industrial engineering, plus the
physical sciences. For more information pick up a copy
of "Consider a Career at Western Electric" from your
Placement Officer. Or write College Relations, Room
200E, Western Electric Company, 195 Broadway, New
York 7, N. Y. And sign up for a W. E. interview when
the Bell System Interviewing Team visits your campus.
