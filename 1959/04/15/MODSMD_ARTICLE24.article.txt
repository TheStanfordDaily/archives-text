SAN FRANCISCO (JP) Chica
go's shortstop Ernie Banks, the
National League home run cham

1959 Tuesday, knocking in four
runs as the Cubs ruined San
Francisco's home opener 5-2.
Banks, who hit 47 home runs
in 1958 and was voted the league's
Most Valuable Player, hit a 375-
foot drive in the fourth, and in
the eighth he crashed a Jack San
ford fast ball 410 feet over the
fence in left center.
