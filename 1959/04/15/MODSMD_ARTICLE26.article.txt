### Dick Barnes 
(This is the second of throe
articles presenting an event-by
event and entrant • hy • entrant
rundown ol' Saturday morning's
SC track and
field meet. Today: the lap
races.)

Though virtually every event
I Saturday morning has appeal he
! cause of the ealiher f competi
\ lion, the mile and 880 have that
; little extra "something" which
looks to make thorn the highlights
<>1 the Stanford-Oregon-USC meet.
The mile, first running event
on the program and scheduled for
10:30, is expected to ho a three
man battle among Bertil Lundh of
Stanford, Jim (hollo of Oregon
and Boh Shankland of USC.
Lundh, a sophomore from Nor
way in his first season at Stan
ford, has a top mark of 4:11.7.
But since ho has boon doubling
most of iho year, Lundh has al
ways finished eased up.
Saturday, his efforts will he
confined to the mile, hence ho can
afford an all-out performance.
Nation's Second Best
i (hello was the United States'
number two miler of 1958, had a
I top mark of 4:01.7n, and was a
member of the U.S. team —•
I coached by Payton Jordan which
I defeated Russia last summer.
I Grelle's best in 1959 is 4:09.9, but
he has not boon pressed as much
as ho will be Saturday.
Shankland is one of the most
unsung milers in the West, yot at
the present time, he is the Coast
leader with a 4:08.6, registered
last week against California.
C'linlil'O a Favorite
Stanford's Ernie Cunliffo is a
narrow favorite in the 880, based
on his 1:50.0 of last week a Sta
dium record and the fastest time
to date in 1 ho country.
(hollo will run the half for the
first time this year. But in view
of the doubling he will have to do,
Cunliffe's biggest opposition will
probably come from Trojans Tom
Anderson, 1:51. In, and Wayne
Lemons, l:54.8n.
Bobby Staten of the Trojans
■shouldn't have any trouble salt
| ing away the 440. Stat en chalked
! up a 17.0 in boating Jack Yorman
j last week, and features an amaz
j ing finishing kick that should dis
; pose of Saturday's competition.
Twin Hopes
Don Chesarek, 48.3, and Bob
Besse, 47.4r, are Iho Indians' twin
point hopes. Oregon features Otis
Davis, who ran 48.5 this year in
the first 440 of his life. Troy
also has Dean Balzarett, 48.7n,
and Ted Smith, 49.5 this season
I hut 40.8 in 1958.

Oregon is tough in tho two-mile
wilh Dick Miller at 9:08.8 and
Mark Robbins, 9:20. Rene Rogers
of USC, 9:19.6, and Boh Mon/ingo
of the Indians, 9:18.1, should bo
neek-and neck with Rohhins, hut
will have 1 rouble challenging Mil
ler.
Stanford's Doug Martin is a
shade below the trio lighting for
second, hut fould bo p-ulled along
enough to outfight someone for
show or fourth. Out of the race
for a variety of reasons is Stan
ford's Keith Wallace.
Relay to SC.'
The relay appears to be a clear
cut case of USC first, Stanford
second, and Oregon third. Troy
has a 3:12.8 to Stanford's 3:11.2.
But with Staten on anchor, the
Indians would have to build lip a
sizeable lead before the final lap
and this will be tough against
USC's crop of strong quarter- and
half rnilers.
