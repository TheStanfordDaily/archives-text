# Card Nine Wins In Tuneup; 4-2

### 
The Stanford baseball team
I warmed up for a big three game
CIBA weekend yesterday with a
! 12 victory over the San Francisco
State Caters.
The Indians will get their first
1959 shot ;ii California Friday on
the Rears' diamond, and will fin
[ ish off their seasonal series with
UCLA in a double-header Satur
! day on Sunken Diamond.
In yesterday's contest it was a
case of too much Stanford pitch
ing and too little potency in the
i visitors' bats. Terry Lindeman,
Warren Nelson, and Marv Meek
lenberg each worked three in
nings and limited the Caters to
i seven hits.
Three of the hits came in the
! ninth inning when San Francisco
' finally cracked the scoring col
! umn for its two runs. After set
ting down seven Caters in order,
Mecklenberg dished out singles to
third baseman George Dunphy
j and right fielder Don Oldham.
Bryant Lyttle tapped to the
mound advancing Dunphy and
1 Oldham, but catcher Gene Craft
collected his first hit of the day,

a bounce shot single to left to
score both runners.
Stanford greeted starter George
Kashiwagi for two quick runs in
ilie first inning. Mike Ma gee was
hit by a pitched ball. Ail von
Wronski and Ben Robinson |>til
singles back to back for one run.
Joel Newkirk, playing in right
field instead of his usual first
base, advanced von Wronski to
j third on a fielder's choice; and
I first baseman Lee Moench scored
von Wronski on a sharp single t<*
center.
Nelson collected the pitching
win for himself when he drove
across Stanford's third run wiih
a line single to right in the fourth
inning, scoring Moench.
The Cardinals' final run came
in the sixth inning when Moench
singled, moved up when Mai
Shut/man was hit and Harry Rod
da bounced into a double play,
and scored on a wild pitch.

The Stanford baseball team
I warmed up for a big three game
CIBA weekend yesterday with a
! 12 victory over the San Francisco
State Caters.
The Indians will get their first
1959 shot ;ii California Friday on
the Rears' diamond, and will fin
[ ish off their seasonal series with
UCLA in a double-header Satur
! day on Sunken Diamond.
In yesterday's contest it was a
case of too much Stanford pitch
ing and too little potency in the
i visitors' bats. Terry Lindeman,
Warren Nelson, and Marv Meek
lenberg each worked three in
nings and limited the Caters to
i seven hits.
Three of the hits came in the
! ninth inning when San Francisco
' finally cracked the scoring col
! umn for its two runs. After set
ting down seven Caters in order,
Mecklenberg dished out singles to
third baseman George Dunphy
j and right fielder Don Oldham.
Bryant Lyttle tapped to the
mound advancing Dunphy and
1 Oldham, but catcher Gene Craft
collected his first hit of the day,

a bounce shot single to left to
score both runners.
Stanford greeted starter George
Kashiwagi for two quick runs in
ilie first inning. Mike Ma gee was
hit by a pitched ball. Ail von
Wronski and Ben Robinson |>til
singles back to back for one run.
Joel Newkirk, playing in right
field instead of his usual first
base, advanced von Wronski to
j third on a fielder's choice; and
I first baseman Lee Moench scored
von Wronski on a sharp single t<*
center.
Nelson collected the pitching
win for himself when he drove
across Stanford's third run wiih
a line single to right in the fourth
inning, scoring Moench.
The Cardinals' final run came
in the sixth inning when Moench
singled, moved up when Mai
Shut/man was hit and Harry Rod
