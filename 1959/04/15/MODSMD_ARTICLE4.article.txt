# Kendall, Miller Meet In Cubberley Debate
## 
### 
The relationship between religion and higher education will be
discussed today by Dr. Alexander Miller, religion, and Dr. Willmoore
Kendall, visiting associate professor of political science, in a debate
entitled "Should the Christians Run the Universities?" at 4:15 p.m.
in Cubberley Auditorium.
The debate, under the auspices of the Council on Religious Affairs, i

stems from a "Y" noon religious
discussion at which Kendall was
the speaker. Miller, attending the
luncheon, did not agree with Ken
dall's views and rather than reply
the following week, preferred to
debate formally the issues con
cerned.
Miller's Stand
Miller, who believes the posi
tion of religion in higher educa
tion is "good and getting better,"
will present the negative stand.
He thinks that no group, not even
the Christians, can be trusted to
main t. ai n an open university
where all points of view can be
taught.
Kendall, believing that reli
gion's place is "bad and getting
worse" concerning higher educa
tion. will argue that there is more
freedom of thought in a Christian
university than in a secular one
which has a strong bias against
the kind of thought represented
by Christian theology and seeks
to eliminate its expression.
Moderator of the debate will be
Tom Derr, assistant chaplain.
Kendall's Second
This is the second debate in a
week for Kendall, who is visiting
from Yale this year. Last Thurs
day he met with Dr. William Me-
Cord, sociology, to discuss aca
demic freedom and loyalty oaths
before an overflow crowd in the
Physics Lecture llall.
Miller, former pastor of Pres
byterian churches in New Zea
land and Britain, has been at
Stanford for eight years.
