## 
### Bob Montgomery 
A 17 year old dream uill come true sometime (his month when the
first stage of the new Palo Alto Stanford Medical Center is turned
over to the l/niveisity hy the contractors, Wagner & Martinez..
The University Trustees had considered moving the Medical School
to the Stanford c;ini|)us ever since Cooper Medical College became

Stanford School of Medicine in
1912. The nearly completed fa
cility was officially begun in Sep
tember. 1 950.
Completion in August
The four-part Center will reach
total completion sometime aftei
Aug. 1. The Rehabilitation Muild
ing, a $1,100,1)01) structure, will be
completed later this month.
"It is our understanding from
the managers of the construction
that the contractors will turn
over the Hospital to the owners
about July 1," said Dr. Roberi 11.
Alvvay, Medical School Dean.
First Patients
"We estimate it will lake a
month to activate the building
and therefore would expect the
first patients to enler the Hospi
tal sometime after Aug. I," he
added.
The moving schedule now be
ing prepared will be based upon
estimated turn-over dat.es, sched
uled equipment delivery, and the
status of teaching and research
programs, he continued. These
factors make it difficult to give a
single, firm date for the opening
of the Medical Center.
Dedication Date
The actual dedication date will
be announced within the next few
days after a joint Palo Alto Stan
ford committee is selected. In ac
cordance with the present pro
posed schedule, teaching for some
250 medical students will begin
the fourth week in September.
Financing for the $21,950,000
is being done through alumni and
foundation gift s , government
grants and business contribu
tions. In ibis way the Medical
School building costs do not have
to be borne by the rest of the
University.
Finance Report
Associate Dean Lyle I'". Cook of
the School of Medicine reports,
"Three-fourths of the financing is
complete. We are very encour
aged by recent developments,
which should result in additional
grants to the Medical School."
Future plans for the newly
transplanted Medical School in
clude enlarged preclinical teach
ing facilities and laboratories;
residential - accommodations for
medical students, nurses, in
terns, residents and other gradu
ate students; and expansion of
the Lane Medical Library. These
improvements along with a pro
posed endowment fund of $10,-
250,0(K) comprise the second stage
of developments which are plan
ned for the future.
