# Pros Outweigh Cons For Pre-Soph Rush
## 
### 
There are many arguments for and against pre-sophomore year
rushing; when they are all considered, we I'eel the benefits far
outweigh the disadvantages of such a system and we urge the
program's adoption.
A chief difficulty with such a program would he the housing
of students who go through the rush period but don't pledge.
'I heir number would have to be estimated and sufficient space held
for them in the independent men's houses. Experience with this
rushing system should make estimating relatively easy.
Ihe shortening <,| ihe length of time a person would he affili

such a rush program. While this is true, it might be pointed out
that the length of lime a man would live in the house would be
the same as it is under the present system.
Presently, any effective freshman program ends uhen
freshmen pledge a house or club. 11 is argued thai if a

The basic benefits of prersophomore year rushing are
numerous and extremely important.
• First, of course, without a no-contact rule and with a week
of intensive rushing, freshmen would get a belter picture of indi
vidual houses and clubs.
o Second, a student would be able to make a meaningful de
cision as to whether or not he would rush. Presently, rushing is a
nebulous thing which some students "sort of do and sort ol don I
Under this system a decision to remain independent would mean
something.
• Third, rushing wouldn't conflict with other items on the
social calendar and, more important, with classes and studying.
• Fourth, the freshman program would be continued for the
entire year . With the no-contact rule removed, the program could
be expanded and strengthened.
• Fifth, the removal of the no-contact rule would facilitate
bringing the freshmen into the rest of the University.
We feel that these benefits far outweigh the objections to the
change, and urge that pre-sophomore rustling be instigated.
