## Phone Booth Stuffing Spreads 
### Elna Rodenhouse 
With colleges all over the na
tion trying to break the record
â€”for phone-booth stuffing, it is
time that a history of the ancient
sport be told.
It all began last month In Dur
ban, South Africa, when 25 stu
dents crammed themselves into a
regulation size phone booth. The
news spread to England, where
students at Manchester Univer
sity tried for the record but could
only squeeze in 16.
North Staffordshire University
in Keele set a British Isles record
with 17, and soon had it taken
away by London's University Col
lege as 18 crammed into a phone
booth. A few days later the Isles
record was raised to 19 by Hat
tield Technical College.
Soon after, American colleges
got wind oi tiie craze and MIT
students got it) into an Ameri
can booth (which Is smaller
than a Uritish phone booth) and
also made a phone call to satis
fy British rules.
The University of British Co
lumbia heard of the craze and, on
March 17, stuffed 20 into a booth.
Harvard tried too, but failed,
getting only a "small group and
a shoeshine boy" into a booth.
Ori March 31, UCLA tried for
a world record, but after two at
tempts could only get in 19. Re
porters from Life were on hand
to record the event.
The University of Connecticut
also tried for the record on April
2, but could only get in 16.
Sometime last month, St. Ma
ry's College set the American l
ord, wedging 22 students into a
booth.
Last week, students at San
Francisco State tried to upset
the record, but before a eount
could lx> taken broke the booth.
The record, however, still
stands at 34, and was set by both
Modesto Junior College and Aca

cia fraternity at Northwestern.
The Ac-acians did theirs strategi
cally: 31 were crammed into the
booth and then three more drop
ped in from the top to tie the rec
ord previously set by Modesto.
New twists have been added,
though. Two weeks ago, 19 Wash
burn University coeds stuffed
themselves into a four-passenger
Volkswagen sedan and issued a
challenge to any American college
to beat their record.
Members and pledges of Tau
Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Long
Beach State took up the cause and
packed 38 into a Volkswagen.
Tau Delta Phi of the University
of Pennsylvania boasted, on April
1, that the had fitted 22 men into
a Hillman - Minx without using
trunk or hood.
San Francisco Slate issued
a challenge last week to break
their records: 61 straws in a
milk shake container, each with
a girl at the end of it, and 'i'l
people in a balhtnh.

Harvard students have found a
way to combine recreation and
esthetic beauty. Robert M. Scher,
a student, dreamed up a game
where two players, Beauty and
Ugly, sit facing in the same direc
tion, placing dimes and toothpicks
in a design on a board.
While Beauty attempts to fabri
cate an esthetic-ally satisfying de
sign, Ugly endeavors to thwart
his enemy by placing his quota of
pieces in awkward spots, and to
destroy Beauty's harmony.

In the Daily Northwestern a
while ago we found a story about
a lecture on honesty and dishon
esty which began: "Surveying his
audience of 15 last night, the Rev.
Scott N. Jones' first words were,
'I have competition.' "
Agreed, agreed.
