## New Berlin Statute Suggested 
### 
(Editor's Note: Waller Lipp
nmnn has just returned from
Europe, where he look a first*
hand look al the Berlin crisis.
This is (lie fourth of a series on
the situation. In his last article
he proposed that we negotiate
a new statute in which West
Berlin is guaranteed an ordered
future by the presence of West
ern troops acting under inter
national auspices.)
In negotiating a new statute we
should begin by establishing the
principles under which we have a
right to be present in Wesl Berlin
and to participate in determining
its future.
For* some extraordinary reason,
we have chosen to argue that our
rights in Berlin rest upon the
right of conquest. That is, if I
may say so, a poor reason for Hie
defenders of civilization to invoke.
If we choose to sfand on Ihe right
of conquest, we shall live to re
gret it. II will boomerang.
For, where would we be if I lie
Soviet Union, which is also a con
queror of Germany, chose to in
voke for it-self Ihe light of con
quest? Tile whole of Germany
was surrendered to Ihe conquer
ors, and if there is a right of con
quest it is not limited to West
Berlin.
Kiglit of Conquest
There is no need for us to resort
to so pr imitive and brutal and re
pellent a principle as the right of
conquest. We have good and suf
ficient civilized reasons for being
in Berlin and for remaining there.
We are in Berlin because it i« the
capital of Germany. We are en
titled to stay there until it is once
again the seat of a united German
government.
During our stay in Berlin we
have, in the course of time, ac
quired a special moral obligation
to the 2'L' million inhabitants of
West Berlin. This obligation we
intend to honor, and we could well
say to Mr. Khrushchev that he
would despise us as we would our
selves if we did not. honor it.
For us, negotiation must start
from these two fundamentals:
the need for a long future of
steadfastness and stability, and
the need for a change which re
flects the new realities. This
can best be done if a new stat
ute is negotiated in which the
future of Berlin is put in trust
with the United Nations.
The new charter or statute
should begin with an explicit dec
laration that the United Nations
trust would last until the two Ger
man states agreed to restore Ber
lin as the capital of a reunited
Germany.
Then in the new statute the
light of access, the conditions of
coexistence, the relations between
the two Berlins and the two Ger
manys, the presence of Allied and
UN token military forces should
be spelled out .
Though it is a complicated thing
to do, it is not an impossible thing
lo establish a city within a city
and within a foreign state. The
most striking example, which
could well be used as a suggestive
model, is Ihe treaty signed in 1929
between the Holy See and the

Kingdom of Italy. This was the
Lateran Treaty, which established
Vatican City.
Example of Vatican
Vatican state is a quite separate
sovereign juridical entity, al
though it is in fact entirely sur
rounded by the city of Rome. The
treaty regulates the whole prob
lem of access across Italian terri
tory, and it does so with a pre
cision which anyone must envy
who knows something of the fuz
ziness of our position in Berlin.
I think I have reason to say
that a solution of this sort would
lie acceptable in West Berlin.
Whether the Russians would ac
cept it there is no way of know
ing until we try to negotiate it
in concrete terms. Hut the signs
are not altogether unfavorable.
Mr. K. has mentioned the (IN in
connection with Berlin; lie has
acknowledged that the West lias
rights and obligations in Ber
lin; and he has not rejected the
idea of a Western military pres
ence.
Both sides have much to gain
from such a settlement. For us it
would mean that the West Berlin
community was guaranteed physi
cal security under a new and
much more authoritative statute
than exists today. It would mean
also that the future was not fore
closed, and that the prospect of
Berlin becoming again the capital
of Germany would be reaffirmed
with the sanction of the world
society.
The West Berliners would have
a reason for carrying on. For they
would have hope-r which, in af
fairs of this sort, is as important
as hydrogen bombs.
Good Deal
The Russians, for their part,
would get a good deal too. They
would get, as we would get, the
relief that comes from straighten
ing out a dangerous muddle. They
would get a provisional but dura
ble acceptance of the fact that
there are two Germanys.
Since a UN statute would have
to be agreed to both by the Soviet
Union and the Pankow govern
ment, they would get a de facto
recognition of the East German
state by the UN. This might mean
much to them, in that it would
help to stabilize their situation in
eastern Europe.
Neither 1 side would "win." But
neither would "lose." Each side
would hold within its sphere of
influence what it now holds, and
neither - would surrender to ihe
other any territory or any people.
But we would get a new legal, po
litical and moral foundation and
framework which takes account
of the hard facts of life- that
there will long be two Germanys,
and that Berlin must be protected
in a special way while Germany
remains divided.

Both sides have much to gain

Berlin becoming again the capital

(Editor's Note: Waller Lipp
nmnn has just returned from
Europe, where he look a first*
hand look al the Berlin crisis.
This is (lie fourth of a series on
the situation. In his last article
he proposed that we negotiate
a new statute in which West
Berlin is guaranteed an ordered
future by the presence of West
ern troops acting under inter
national auspices.)
In negotiating a new statute we
should begin by establishing the
principles under which we have a
right to be present in Wesl Berlin
and to participate in determining
its future.
For* some extraordinary reason,
we have chosen to argue that our
rights in Berlin rest upon the
right of conquest. That is, if I
may say so, a poor reason for Hie
defenders of civilization to invoke.
If we choose to sfand on Ihe right
of conquest, we shall live to re
gret it. II will boomerang.
For, where would we be if I lie
Soviet Union, which is also a con
queror of Germany, chose to in
voke for it-self Ihe light of con
quest? Tile whole of Germany
was surrendered to Ihe conquer
ors, and if there is a right of con
quest it is not limited to West
Berlin.
Kiglit of Conquest
There is no need for us to resort
to so pr imitive and brutal and re
pellent a principle as the right of
conquest. We have good and suf
ficient civilized reasons for being
in Berlin and for remaining there.
We are in Berlin because it i« the
capital of Germany. We are en
titled to stay there until it is once
again the seat of a united German
government.
During our stay in Berlin we
have, in the course of time, ac
quired a special moral obligation
to the 2'L' million inhabitants of
West Berlin. This obligation we
intend to honor, and we could well
say to Mr. Khrushchev that he
would despise us as we would our
selves if we did not. honor it.
For us, negotiation must start
from these two fundamentals:
the need for a long future of
steadfastness and stability, and
the need for a change which re
flects the new realities. This
can best be done if a new stat
ute is negotiated in which the
future of Berlin is put in trust
with the United Nations.
The new charter or statute
should begin with an explicit dec
laration that the United Nations
trust would last until the two Ger
man states agreed to restore Ber
lin as the capital of a reunited
Germany.
Then in the new statute the
light of access, the conditions of
coexistence, the relations between
the two Berlins and the two Ger
manys, the presence of Allied and
UN token military forces should
be spelled out .
Though it is a complicated thing
to do, it is not an impossible thing
lo establish a city within a city
and within a foreign state. The
most striking example, which
could well be used as a suggestive
model, is Ihe treaty signed in 1929
between the Holy See and the

Kingdom of Italy. This was the
Lateran Treaty, which established
Vatican City.
Example of Vatican
Vatican state is a quite separate
sovereign juridical entity, al
though it is in fact entirely sur
rounded by the city of Rome. The
treaty regulates the whole prob
lem of access across Italian terri
tory, and it does so with a pre
cision which anyone must envy
who knows something of the fuz
ziness of our position in Berlin.
I think I have reason to say
that a solution of this sort would
lie acceptable in West Berlin.

have, in the course of time, ac
quired a special moral obligation
to the 2'L' million inhabitants of
West Berlin. This obligation we
intend to honor, and we could well
say to Mr. Khrushchev that he
would despise us as we would our
selves if we did not. honor it.
For us, negotiation must start
from these two fundamentals:
the need for a long future of
steadfastness and stability, and
the need for a change which re
flects the new realities. This
can best be done if a new stat
ute is negotiated in which the
future of Berlin is put in trust
with the United Nations.
The new charter or statute
should begin with an explicit dec
laration that the United Nations
trust would last until the two Ger
man states agreed to restore Ber
lin as the capital of a reunited
Germany.
Then in the new statute the
light of access, the conditions of
coexistence, the relations between
the two Berlins and the two Ger
manys, the presence of Allied and
UN token military forces should
be spelled out .
Though it is a complicated thing
to do, it is not an impossible thing
lo establish a city within a city
and within a foreign state. The
most striking example, which
could well be used as a suggestive
model, is Ihe treaty signed in 1929
between the Holy See and the

Kingdom of Italy. This was the
Lateran Treaty, which established
Vatican City.
Example of Vatican
Vatican state is a quite separate
sovereign juridical entity, al
though it is in fact entirely sur
rounded by the city of Rome. The
treaty regulates the whole prob
lem of access across Italian terri
tory, and it does so with a pre
cision which anyone must envy
who knows something of the fuz
ziness of our position in Berlin.
I think I have reason to say
that a solution of this sort would
lie acceptable in West Berlin.
Whether the Russians would ac
cept it there is no way of know
ing until we try to negotiate it
in concrete terms. Hut the signs
are not altogether unfavorable.
Mr. K. has mentioned the (IN in
connection with Berlin; lie has
acknowledged that the West lias
rights and obligations in Ber
lin; and he has not rejected the
idea of a Western military pres
ence.
Both sides have much to gain
from such a settlement. For us it
would mean that the West Berlin
community was guaranteed physi
cal security under a new and
much more authoritative statute
than exists today. It would mean
also that the future was not fore
closed, and that the prospect of
Berlin becoming again the capital
of Germany would be reaffirmed
with the sanction of the world
society.
The West Berliners would have
a reason for carrying on. For they
would have hope-r which, in af
fairs of this sort, is as important
as hydrogen bombs.
Good Deal
The Russians, for their part,
would get a good deal too. They
would get, as we would get, the
relief that comes from straighten
ing out a dangerous muddle. They
would get a provisional but dura
ble acceptance of the fact that
there are two Germanys.
Since a UN statute would have
to be agreed to both by the Soviet
Union and the Pankow govern
ment, they would get a de facto
recognition of the East German
state by the UN. This might mean
much to them, in that it would
help to stabilize their situation in
eastern Europe.
Neither 1 side would "win." But
neither would "lose." Each side
would hold within its sphere of
influence what it now holds, and
neither - would surrender to ihe
other any territory or any people.
But we would get a new legal, po
litical and moral foundation and
framework which takes account
of the hard facts of life- that
there will long be two Germanys,
and that Berlin must be protected
in a special way while Germany
remains divided.

There is no need for us to resort
