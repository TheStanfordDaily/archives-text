# "The Rope Dancers' Not Recommended
## 
### Jerome W. Clinton 
"The Rope Dancers," a play by
Morton Wishengrad opened re
cently at the lnterplayers in San
Francisco. )l is not, unfortunate
ly, a very good play, nor does the
production given it by the lnter
players in any way overcome its
defects.
The action of the play takes
place entirely in I he two-room
tenement flat of Margaret lly
land and her young daughter, Liz
zle. Margaret is, we discover, an
extremely clean woman, who not
only dislikes dirt hut is intolerant
of it. Lizzie is precocious, and
kept clean hy her mother-, hut
would rather play downstairs in
the horse trough with the dirty
but happy children of the sloven

ly Mrs. Farrow from the third
floor.
This conflict between mother'
and daughter is no sooner delin
eated than in pops James Hyland,
Margaret's lovable, learned, but
irresponsibly weak husband, lie
hail previously been forced out
of the house by his domineering
wife, but he has, through love for
his daughter-, returned for more
punishment.
During the next two acts, the
plot moves by erratic hyperbole
to the inevitable reconciliation of
Margaret and James over the
leathbed of Lizzie, who was, iron
Ically enough, one ol the causes
>1' their separation.
Coming as it does after a
series of violently improbable

events, embarrassing self-revela
tions and pointlessly disgusting
scenes the first act ends with
Lizzie writhing on the floor in
a spastic fit this reconciliation
seems utterly pointless. What
ever' Wishengrad's message is, it
is lost in his violent attempts to
express it. Indeed, his best lines
seem to have no bearing on Ihe
action of the play.
The actors seemed either whol
ly baffled by the characters they
were meant to portray, or simply
by the business of acting. Leon
Forbes' direction did little to
overcome their confusion.

his daughter-, returned for more
punishment.
During the next two acts, the
plot moves by erratic hyperbole
to the inevitable reconciliation of
Margaret and James over the
leathbed of Lizzie, who was, iron
Ically enough, one ol the causes
>1' their separation.
Coming as it does after a
series of violently improbable

events, embarrassing self-revela
tions and pointlessly disgusting
scenes the first act ends with
Lizzie writhing on the floor in
a spastic fit this reconciliation
seems utterly pointless. What
ever' Wishengrad's message is, it
is lost in his violent attempts to
express it. Indeed, his best lines
seem to have no bearing on Ihe
action of the play.
The actors seemed either whol
ly baffled by the characters they
were meant to portray, or simply
by the business of acting. Leon
Forbes' direction did little to
overcome their confusion.
