# Indian 9 Faces CIBA Crucials
## 
### 
Tliroo erueials are on lap for
the Card diamondeers this week
mkI as I he Stanford nine journeys
to C'al to play the tough Bears
Friday and rot urns home for a
double-header against the claw
less UCLA Hruins Saturday.
Although Card mentor Dutch
Fehring always calls every game
a crucial, the Tribe should have
a battle on its hands at Berkeley
tomorrow.
Hears Second
The Bears, who last year fin
ished second to NCAA champ
(JSC and copped that national li
lie in llH/7, suffer only in the
pilrhing department as their in
field returns almost intact and
jayvee.s and I ransfers should hack
up second baseman Roger Cregg
in the hitting end of the game.
All <'II',A Bear chucker Dave
I>raheim is out temporarily but
hurler Kiin Klliott, who recently
shut oul Bepperdine, returns af
ter a successful 1 !)~>7 year to
plague the Tribe.
Indian southpaw Terry Linde
man will start in tomorrow's 3:15
game and hopes to improve his
.''.I record. Coach Fehring an
nounced that Saturday's starters
against the Bruins will he Karl
Russell, | 3, and Marv Mecklen
berg, fl-1.
Victory Is Needed
The Indians, with their 3-1 rec
ord in CIBA play, need to whip
Cal and the Bruins on Saturday
to stay in the race for the title.
IJSC seems again to be the team
to beat, but the Trojans are ineli
gible for NCAA tourney play so
the race for second is important.
The improving Bruins cannot
be underrated as they almost
whipped the tough Trojans last
weekend and have wins over the
powerful Fresno State and Uni

versity of Arizona nines.
A new face will again be seen
in right field as Art von Wronski
will replace the injured Rich De-
Fabio in that posilion. DeFabio
is out with a busied jaw and al
though he has returned to classes,
his jaw is wired shut and he will
probably be out for another week.
