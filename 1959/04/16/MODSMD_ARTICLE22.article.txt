# Meet the Cards
## 
### 
Munich, off some brilliant
billing wilh the Braves, has at
least for Ihe time heing worked
his way into the starling lineup,
sending regular first baseman
Joel Newkirk to vacated right
field. A sharp fielder, the Bur
lingame sophomore hit .21.1
with last year's Papooses. Left
handed all the way. Major: Me
chanical Engineering.

This sophomore right-hander
from Sacramento is rapidly de
veloping into the ace of the cur
rent Card mound staff. With a
'1-3 record, he holds decisions
over three CIBA teams in three
outings, including USC. Big and
strong, he was the workhorse
of last year's freshmen and tops
Â« this staff in innings. Major:
Civil Engineering.
