(This is (In* third and con
cluding' article presenting; an
event - by - event, ent rant-by-en
trant rundown of Saturday
morning's Stanford-Oregon-lISC'
track meet. Today: the field
events.)

Five 24-foot broad-jumpers, five
pole van Iters who have gone over
14 1, an Olympic champion high
jumper and a 243-foot javelinist
all provide ample evidence thai
field events won't have to take a
back seat to races Saturday morn
ing in the Stanfotd-Oregon-USC
triangular meet here.
The broad jump, pole vault and
discus are about as wide open as
three events could be. Stanford's
John Kelly is the ranking broad
jumper with a leap of 21-9.
Kelly in Danger
But IJSC has Bill Jackson at
24-6 and Luther Hayes at 24-114,
and Oregon isn't far back with
24-1 ■;« Steve Anderson and deeath
lonist Dave Edstrom, who was
over 24 feet in 1958. All will be
trying to hand Kelly his first loss
of t ho lf). r )9 season.

Stanford is conspicuous by its
absence from the vaulting field.
Oregon sophomore Phil Paquin
heads the group with a season
best of 14-6 1 . His teammate Jack
Burg, and Trojans Jim Brewer—
the prep record holder and Er
nie Bullard have all cleared 14-4.
SC's third man and the NCAA co
champion last year. Gene Freu
denthal, has done 14-I't.
Five men in the discus have
thrown within a 10-foot range of
each other. Stanford's Armand
DeWeese has thrown 165-0'- for
the best mark in the PCC. But
USC's Bob Sbordone is close be
hind at 163-8. The rest of the best
are Troy's Mike McKeever, 159
3'i, Stanford's Harlan Limmer,
15S-land Oregon's Red Kstes,
155-10.
I>< YY cose Favored
DeWeese has been on a steady
improvement trail this season,
and must stand as a very slight
favorite.
The Olympic champ in Satur
day's competition is Charlie Du
mas. He's climbed to 6-9'.i so far

in 1959, slightly more than three
inches under his all-time best.
This looks to ho Troy's strongest
and surest event, since Bobby
Avant, 6-6, and Dumas give them
an almost-cinch 1-2.
Freudenthal, who's gone 6 2!£,
will bo right in the thick of the
fight for third along with the
Ducks' Ken Grant, 6-3 <6-7 last
year), and Dave Edstrom, (!-2, and
the Indians' Paul Gillespie, 6-2%,
and John Nourse, (5-2.
Mills Good Bet
A fairly sure winner in the
javelin is I"). C. Mills of Oregon.
I lis 243-10 is 20 feet better than
anyone else in the event. USC
looks able to pull down second
and third, however, with Mike
| Page and Sbordone, each of whom
i has thrown 223-5.
Another Duck, Paul Burnick,
I has tossed 215-2'i-. This leaves
Stanford's Jim Backstrand, 211-
11, with only an outside chance to
even hit the scoring column after
| winning meets with UCLA, Occi
| dental and Fresno State.
The shot-put will probably turn
into a two-man battle between
Jerry Winters of Stanford and
Marlin McKeever of the Trojans.
Winters has done 56-9'.4 to 56-4
for McKeever. Carl Self, 53-5 vU,
and Mike McKeever, 53 3\ ( 4, give
USC srong depth in the event,
i Will Reeve, at 52 feet, is the only
I Oregon entrant.

heads the group with a season
best of 14-6 1 . His teammate Jack
Burg, and Trojans Jim Brewer—
the prep record holder and Er
nie Bullard have all cleared 14-4.
SC's third man and the NCAA co
champion last year. Gene Freu
denthal, has done 14-I't.
Five men in the discus have
thrown within a 10-foot range of
each other. Stanford's Armand
DeWeese has thrown 165-0'- for
the best mark in the PCC. But
USC's Bob Sbordone is close be
hind at 163-8. The rest of the best
are Troy's Mike McKeever, 159
3'i, Stanford's Harlan Limmer,
15S-land Oregon's Red Kstes,
155-10.
I>< YY cose Favored
DeWeese has been on a steady
improvement trail this season,
and must stand as a very slight
favorite.
The Olympic champ in Satur
day's competition is Charlie Du
mas. He's climbed to 6-9'.i so far

in 1959, slightly more than three
inches under his all-time best.
This looks to ho Troy's strongest
and surest event, since Bobby
Avant, 6-6, and Dumas give them
an almost-cinch 1-2.
Freudenthal, who's gone 6 2!£,
will bo right in the thick of the
fight for third along with the
Ducks' Ken Grant, 6-3 <6-7 last
year), and Dave Edstrom, (!-2, and
the Indians' Paul Gillespie, 6-2%,
and John Nourse, (5-2.
Mills Good Bet
A fairly sure winner in the
javelin is I"). C. Mills of Oregon.
I lis 243-10 is 20 feet better than
anyone else in the event. USC
looks able to pull down second
and third, however, with Mike
| Page and Sbordone, each of whom
i has thrown 223-5.
Another Duck, Paul Burnick,
I has tossed 215-2'i-. This leaves
Stanford's Jim Backstrand, 211-
11, with only an outside chance to
even hit the scoring column after
| winning meets with UCLA, Occi
| dental and Fresno State.
The shot-put will probably turn
into a two-man battle between
Jerry Winters of Stanford and
Marlin McKeever of the Trojans.
Winters has done 56-9'.4 to 56-4
for McKeever. Carl Self, 53-5 vU,
and Mike McKeever, 53 3\ ( 4, give
USC srong depth in the event,
i Will Reeve, at 52 feet, is the only
I Oregon entrant.

track meet. Today: the field
events.)

Five 24-foot broad-jumpers, five
pole van Iters who have gone over
14 1, an Olympic champion high
jumper and a 243-foot javelinist
all provide ample evidence thai
field events won't have to take a
back seat to races Saturday morn
ing in the Stanfotd-Oregon-USC

The broad jump, pole vault and
discus are about as wide open as
three events could be. Stanford's
John Kelly is the ranking broad
jumper with a leap of 21-9.

24-6 and Luther Hayes at 24-114,
