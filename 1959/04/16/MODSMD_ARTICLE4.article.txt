### Marilyn Moore 
The best method for greatest
university freedom was discussed
yesterday in a "conversation" be
I ween I>r. Alexander Miller ol re
ligion and Dr. Willmoore Kendall
of political science held at Cub
berley Auditorium. The discus
sion was under the auspices of
the Council on Religious Affairs
and was moderated by Tom Derr.
To the question, "Should the
Christians run the universities?"
Kendall replied yes, stating that
the university present policy of
free inquiry presently "gives
freedom to its faculty to deny in
quiry itself.'' Miller answered no,
basing his position on the rela
tionship of the church to the
academy in the fifth century
"not responsible to each other but
to Cod."
In opening, Kendall presented
six points on which he felt the
views of the two professors would
coincide, including the merits of
Christianity as the true religion,
the "American university" being
a slate rather than a private insti
tution, and the change in â–  the
"open forum" attitudes of univer
sities within the last century, a
change developing within the uni
versity, not imposed from outside.
"Possible Disagreement"
The point on which he and Mil
ler "might disagree." stated Ken
dall, was the best way of further
ing free inquiry.
"If the Christi ins ran the uni
versities the chances of inquiry
"so free that it ceases to be in
quiry" would be restricted, Ken
dall asserted. "Free inquiry
would be wider than if assumed
that man does not live under
(Jod
Miller, emphasizing that any
disagreement between the two
professors was not one between
two religions, described I lie
change in the early Christian at
tilude that culture was subordi
nate to the church. Power, wis
dom (learning), and the church
were separated, and no two of
them could be joined.
"Thoroughfare for Discussion"
Stressing the university's duty
to transmit the whole heritage,
not only the Christian heritage,
Miller stated, "The university
must provide a thoroughfare for
discussion, wit Ii clash and conflict
acting as an abrasive of each oth
or, rubbing off prejudice."
Kendall pointed out thai free
dom of inquiry in the fifth cen
tury differed from that of the
present, as "all the inquirers were
Christian and schools were not
used for the destruction of Chris
lianity." This concept changed,
however, with tin* introduction of
skept icisin.
Additional Point
An additional point of eonlro
versy was the issue <>112 atheist in
st motors in universities today, a
condition Miller upheld.
"A community of scholars can
serve Cod even when Cod's name
is denied," ho stated, a statement
opposed by Kendall, who also
questioned the use of the word
"serve" in such a situation.
"The trend of American culture
is to transcend Christianity,"
Kendall declared. "The Chris
tians are being 'squeezed out' in
the universities today."
