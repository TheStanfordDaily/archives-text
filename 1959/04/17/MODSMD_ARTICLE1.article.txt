# Card Thinclads Host SC, Ducks
## 
### Dick Bares 
America's finest dual-triangular track and field competition of the
season will unfold tomorrow at 10 a.m. in Stanford Stadium.
Stanford, Oregon and Southern California are the combatants in a
meet which will see one and perhaps two of the longest collegiate
winning streaks in the country come to an end.

At stake is the Trojans' string
of 82 consecutive meets without
defeat the lone blemish a 1949
tie with Michigan State. USC has
n't lost since May 12, 1945. Ore
gon's winning streak stands at 30
- much shorter than USC's, but
nonetheless impressive.
In the neighborhood of 15,000
fans are expected to attend. This
would better the Stanford Stadi
um mark of 12,000 set at Big Meet
last year and the nation's biggest
dual meet crowd in 1958.
Record Confusion
For Stanford and USC the meet
will be either the 57th or 54th in
an ancient series, depending on
whose records one examines. Stan
ford figures have the Trojans
leading the series, 27-26, while
USC files show the series dead
locked at 28-all.
It will be the first time the Ore
gon Ducks have met either the
Indians or the Trojans in dual
competition. Scoring will be on
both triangular and triple-dual
bases.
Eight Stanford-SC meet marks
will bo endangered by the excel
lent field. New standards could
come in the 220. 440, 880, mile,
mile relay, high jump, broad jump
and -shot-put. The Stanford Sta
dium record in the 880 should fall,
and marks in the 220, mile, high
jump and mile relay are within
long-shot range.
880, Mile Stand Out
Although every event features
one or more entrants of outstand
ing ability, the mile and the 880
stand out as the best races of the
day.
Each has in its field the No. 1
ranking collegiate varsity runner
—Stanford's Ernie Cunliffe in the
880 and USC's Bob Shankland in
(he mile.
Shankland will face extremely
tough competition from Jim
Grellc and Bertil Lundh in the
opening race of the program.
Grellc is Oregon's two-time NCAA
runner-up in the mile and won the
1500-meter race in the U.S.-vs.-
U. 5.5.11. dual meet last summer.
Dark Horse
Lundh, a Stanford sophomore
from Norway, has yet to run an
all-out mile in 1959 and is the dark
horse among the three top run
ners.
Cunliffe tangles with two out
standing Trojans -Tom Anderson
and Wayne Lemons—his own
teammate Dick Lassen and Grelle
in the halt. Any of the quintet
