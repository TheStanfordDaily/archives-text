# Card Thinclads Host SC, Ducks
## 
### Dick Bares 
America's finest dual-triangular track and field competition of the
season will unfold tomorrow at 10 a.m. in Stanford Stadium.
Stanford, Oregon and Southern California are the combatants in a
meet which will see one and perhaps two of the longest collegiate
winning streaks in the country come to an end.

At stake is the Trojans' string
of 82 consecutive meets without
defeat the lone blemish a 1949
tie with Michigan State. USC has
n't lost since May 12, 1945. Ore
gon's winning streak stands at 30
- much shorter than USC's, but
nonetheless impressive.
In the neighborhood of 15,000
fans are expected to attend. This
would better the Stanford Stadi
um mark of 12,000 set at Big Meet
last year and the nation's biggest
dual meet crowd in 1958.
Record Confusion
For Stanford and USC the meet
will be either the 57th or 54th in
an ancient series, depending on
whose records one examines. Stan
ford figures have the Trojans
leading the series, 27-26, while
USC files show the series dead
locked at 28-all.
It will be the first time the Ore
gon Ducks have met either the
Indians or the Trojans in dual
competition. Scoring will be on
both triangular and triple-dual
bases.
Eight Stanford-SC meet marks
will bo endangered by the excel
lent field. New standards could
come in the 220. 440, 880, mile,
mile relay, high jump, broad jump
and -shot-put. The Stanford Sta
dium record in the 880 should fall,
and marks in the 220, mile, high
jump and mile relay are within
long-shot range.
880, Mile Stand Out
Although every event features
one or more entrants of outstand
ing ability, the mile and the 880
stand out as the best races of the
day.
Each has in its field the No. 1
ranking collegiate varsity runner
—Stanford's Ernie Cunliffe in the
880 and USC's Bob Shankland in
(he mile.
Shankland will face extremely
tough competition from Jim
Grellc and Bertil Lundh in the
opening race of the program.
Grellc is Oregon's two-time NCAA
runner-up in the mile and won the
1500-meter race in the U.S.-vs.-
U. 5.5.11. dual meet last summer.
Dark Horse
Lundh, a Stanford sophomore
from Norway, has yet to run an
all-out mile in 1959 and is the dark
horse among the three top run
ners.
Cunliffe tangles with two out
standing Trojans -Tom Anderson
and Wayne Lemons—his own
teammate Dick Lassen and Grelle
in the halt. Any of the quintet
could win, but Cunliffe goes into
the race favored.
Unless iho field bogs down in a
tactical race and this isn't likely
since Cunliffe likes to set a strong
pace his own week-old Stadium
record of 1:50 appears to be
doomed.
Looks Solid
The day's surest double winner
three wins if the relay is count
ed looks to be USC's Bobby Stat
en. A newcomer to Troy via San
Diego JC, Staten is noted for his
tremendous finishing kick in both
the 220 and 140.
Outstanding in the field events
are names like Charley Dumas,
D. C. Mills. Jim Brewer and Jerry
Winters. Dumas, the first man to
high-jump seven feet, should win
easily for his Trojans.
Mills is the nation's second-rank
ing collegiate .javelin thrower this
year, trailing only Bill Alley of
Kansas, the new American record
holder. Brewer is noted as the
only 15-foot pole vaultcr in prep
history, while Winters is on the
threshold of being Stanford's best
ever shot-putter and currently
ranks third among U.S. varsity
collegians.
I'S(' Should Win
Teamwise, it looks like USC,
Oregon and Stanford in that or
der lad with enough toss-up
points so that this order could be
reversed almost a.-Easily as not.
Of Indian chances, coach Pay
ton Jordan says his club's condi
tion is as good as it has been all
year. He's concentrating his men
in single events instead of dou
bling, thus enhancing iho winning
chances of men like Cunliffe and
I Aindh.
The unique .starting time of 10
a.m. has been set to avoid conflict
with the Cal-UCLA meet or the
<iiants-Cardinals game.
Good ICarly Action
With the new starting time,
however, fans will have to be on
hand early to avoid missing either
the mile or the shot-put a field
evenl which may he over by 10:30
or 10:15.

of the Stanford Band, will also be

will handle public-address color,
with Kd McC'auley on results. The
Cinder Stompers, spring version
of the Stanford Band, will also be
on hand.

America's finest dual-triangular track and field competition of the
season will unfold tomorrow at 10 a.m. in Stanford Stadium.
Stanford, Oregon and Southern California are the combatants in a
meet which will see one and perhaps two of the longest collegiate
winning streaks in the country come to an end.

At stake is the Trojans' string
of 82 consecutive meets without
defeat the lone blemish a 1949
tie with Michigan State. USC has
n't lost since May 12, 1945. Ore
gon's winning streak stands at 30
- much shorter than USC's, but
nonetheless impressive.
In the neighborhood of 15,000
fans are expected to attend. This
would better the Stanford Stadi
um mark of 12,000 set at Big Meet
last year and the nation's biggest
dual meet crowd in 1958.
Record Confusion
For Stanford and USC the meet
will be either the 57th or 54th in
an ancient series, depending on
whose records one examines. Stan
ford figures have the Trojans
leading the series, 27-26, while
USC files show the series dead
locked at 28-all.
It will be the first time the Ore
gon Ducks have met either the
Indians or the Trojans in dual
competition. Scoring will be on
both triangular and triple-dual
bases.
Eight Stanford-SC meet marks
will bo endangered by the excel
lent field. New standards could
come in the 220. 440, 880, mile,
mile relay, high jump, broad jump
and -shot-put. The Stanford Sta
dium record in the 880 should fall,
and marks in the 220, mile, high
jump and mile relay are within
long-shot range.
880, Mile Stand Out
Although every event features
one or more entrants of outstand
ing ability, the mile and the 880
stand out as the best races of the
day.
Each has in its field the No. 1
ranking collegiate varsity runner
—Stanford's Ernie Cunliffe in the
880 and USC's Bob Shankland in
(he mile.
Shankland will face extremely
tough competition from Jim
Grellc and Bertil Lundh in the
opening race of the program.
Grellc is Oregon's two-time NCAA
runner-up in the mile and won the
1500-meter race in the U.S.-vs.-
U. 5.5.11. dual meet last summer.
Dark Horse
Lundh, a Stanford sophomore
from Norway, has yet to run an
all-out mile in 1959 and is the dark
horse among the three top run
ners.
Cunliffe tangles with two out
standing Trojans -Tom Anderson
and Wayne Lemons—his own
teammate Dick Lassen and Grelle
in the halt. Any of the quintet
could win, but Cunliffe goes into
the race favored.
Unless iho field bogs down in a
tactical race and this isn't likely
since Cunliffe likes to set a strong
pace his own week-old Stadium
record of 1:50 appears to be
doomed.
Looks Solid
The day's surest double winner
three wins if the relay is count
ed looks to be USC's Bobby Stat
en. A newcomer to Troy via San
Diego JC, Staten is noted for his
tremendous finishing kick in both
the 220 and 140.
Outstanding in the field events
are names like Charley Dumas,
D. C. Mills. Jim Brewer and Jerry
Winters. Dumas, the first man to
high-jump seven feet, should win
easily for his Trojans.
Mills is the nation's second-rank
ing collegiate .javelin thrower this
year, trailing only Bill Alley of
Kansas, the new American record
holder. Brewer is noted as the
only 15-foot pole vaultcr in prep
history, while Winters is on the
threshold of being Stanford's best
ever shot-putter and currently
ranks third among U.S. varsity
collegians.
I'S(' Should Win
Teamwise, it looks like USC,
Oregon and Stanford in that or
der lad with enough toss-up
points so that this order could be
reversed almost a.-Easily as not.
Of Indian chances, coach Pay
ton Jordan says his club's condi
tion is as good as it has been all
year. He's concentrating his men
in single events instead of dou
bling, thus enhancing iho winning
chances of men like Cunliffe and
I Aindh.
The unique .starting time of 10
a.m. has been set to avoid conflict
with the Cal-UCLA meet or the
<iiants-Cardinals game.
Good ICarly Action
With the new starting time,
however, fans will have to be on
hand early to avoid missing either
the mile or the shot-put a field

or 10:15.

or 10:15.

11. 1). Thoreau, acclaimed as the
country's best track announcer,
will handle public-address color,
with Kd McC'auley on results. The
Cinder Stompers, spring version
of the Stanford Band, will also be
on hand.

America's finest dual-triangular track and field competition of the
season will unfold tomorrow at 10 a.m. in Stanford Stadium.
Stanford, Oregon and Southern California are the combatants in a
meet which will see one and perhaps two of the longest collegiate
winning streaks in the country come to an end.

At stake is the Trojans' string
of 82 consecutive meets without
defeat the lone blemish a 1949
tie with Michigan State. USC has
n't lost since May 12, 1945. Ore
gon's winning streak stands at 30
- much shorter than USC's, but
nonetheless impressive.
In the neighborhood of 15,000
fans are expected to attend. This
would better the Stanford Stadi
um mark of 12,000 set at Big Meet
last year and the nation's biggest
dual meet crowd in 1958.
Record Confusion
For Stanford and USC the meet
will be either the 57th or 54th in
an ancient series, depending on
whose records one examines. Stan
ford figures have the Trojans
leading the series, 27-26, while
USC files show the series dead
locked at 28-all.
It will be the first time the Ore
gon Ducks have met either the
Indians or the Trojans in dual
competition. Scoring will be on
both triangular and triple-dual
bases.
Eight Stanford-SC meet marks
will bo endangered by the excel
lent field. New standards could
come in the 220. 440, 880, mile,
mile relay, high jump, broad jump
and -shot-put. The Stanford Sta
dium record in the 880 should fall,
and marks in the 220, mile, high
jump and mile relay are within
long-shot range.
880, Mile Stand Out
Although every event features
one or more entrants of outstand
ing ability, the mile and the 880
stand out as the best races of the
day.
Each has in its field the No. 1
ranking collegiate varsity runner
—Stanford's Ernie Cunliffe in the
880 and USC's Bob Shankland in
(he mile.
Shankland will face extremely
tough competition from Jim
Grellc and Bertil Lundh in the
opening race of the program.
Grellc is Oregon's two-time NCAA
runner-up in the mile and won the
1500-meter race in the U.S.-vs.-
U. 5.5.11. dual meet last summer.
Dark Horse
Lundh, a Stanford sophomore
from Norway, has yet to run an
all-out mile in 1959 and is the dark
horse among the three top run
ners.
Cunliffe tangles with two out
standing Trojans -Tom Anderson
and Wayne Lemons—his own
teammate Dick Lassen and Grelle
in the halt. Any of the quintet
could win, but Cunliffe goes into
the race favored.
Unless iho field bogs down in a
tactical race and this isn't likely
since Cunliffe likes to set a strong
pace his own week-old Stadium
record of 1:50 appears to be
doomed.
Looks Solid
The day's surest double winner
three wins if the relay is count
ed looks to be USC's Bobby Stat
en. A newcomer to Troy via San
Diego JC, Staten is noted for his
tremendous finishing kick in both
the 220 and 140.
Outstanding in the field events
are names like Charley Dumas,
D. C. Mills. Jim Brewer and Jerry
Winters. Dumas, the first man to
high-jump seven feet, should win
easily for his Trojans.
Mills is the nation's second-rank
ing collegiate .javelin thrower this
year, trailing only Bill Alley of
Kansas, the new American record
holder. Brewer is noted as the
only 15-foot pole vaultcr in prep
history, while Winters is on the
threshold of being Stanford's best
ever shot-putter and currently
ranks third among U.S. varsity
collegians.
I'S(' Should Win
Teamwise, it looks like USC,
Oregon and Stanford in that or
der lad with enough toss-up
points so that this order could be
reversed almost a.-Easily as not.
Of Indian chances, coach Pay
ton Jordan says his club's condi
tion is as good as it has been all
year. He's concentrating his men
in single events instead of dou
bling, thus enhancing iho winning
chances of men like Cunliffe and
I Aindh.
The unique .starting time of 10
a.m. has been set to avoid conflict
with the Cal-UCLA meet or the
<iiants-Cardinals game.
Good ICarly Action
With the new starting time,
however, fans will have to be on
hand early to avoid missing either
the mile or the shot-put a field
evenl which may he over by 10:30
or 10:15.
