# Loan Granted For IIR Cafe
## 
### 
Legislature activities last night
varied from a proposal to abolish
the Social Co-ordinating Board to
discussion of providing linen serv
ice in women's residences.
One of the main points on the
agenda was the announcement of
Bob Best as Student Financial
Manager for 1959-60. Best, who
will succeed Larry Kclley, is a
sophomore from Stockton.
Social Coordinating Board
Carole Franklin, Moore repre
sentative, presented the commit
tee report recommending the
abolishment of the Social Soordi
nating Board. She said the com
mittee had been able to find no
valuable function of the Board.
The report pointed out that the
Board apparently served to give
blanket approval to the actions of
the vice-president.
The committee recommended
that the Cabinet advise the vice
president in the scheduling of
events. It was further proposed
that the vice-president levy any
necessary fines and that appeal be
made to a meeting of living group
social chairmen. Final appeal
rests with the Legislature.
A meeting of all social chair
men at the beginning of each
quarter was recommended, and
finally, the committee proposed
that three or four aides be select
ed, each one well versed on some
aspect of planning social func
tions.
Legislature also authorized Kel
ley to make a $2250 loan at 4 per
cent to the lIR to finance the
Sidewalk Cafe. The loan will be
repaid from profits from the
Sidewalk Cafe and when repaid,
the profits will go into a special
fund controlled by the Union
Board. The Legislature recom
mended to the Board that the
fund be used for the benefit of
foreign students.
Hostels Separated
Dick Coffing, chairman of Hos
tels, presented a by-laws change
which would separate Hostels
from Cardinals Board. As an al
ternative, he proposed that Hos
tels become a direct concern of
the Board, instead of a subcom
mittee of Cardinals.
Miss Franklin, who has been
discussing the possibility of linen
service for women with the Ad
ministration officers, said a final
report will be ready next week.
Leo Krulitz, Daily editor, was
directed to formulate a constitu
tional changc providing for the
fall instead of spring election of
yell leader, and ASSU President
John Bohn urged the Legislature
to consider this plan, the present
system and a third alternative, se
lection of the yell leader by a
board.
