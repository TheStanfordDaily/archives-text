# Head Yell Leader Selection Criticized
## 
### 
Stanford's METHOD of selecting a head yell leader has long been
criticized. The principal complaint is thai election depends ton
much on stunts or hoopla and too little on abilitv. A a result
yrll loaders have been circled who <*<>111 <lit I control a crowd, or
who didn't know anything aitout the mechanics ol veil leading.
Most criticism of the process calls for a change ol procedure
to one wherehv selection ol a yell leader is done hy some sort ol
hoard. A variety ol hoards has hern proposed, running I nun
( irdinals or Hally ( inn to joint student-laoully.
We now propose a change in the process which wr think v\ 111
make lor hettrr selection while at the same time preserving lor
the students the right to choose their own yell leader.
! he bltsie frill ii / r of this phlii Would he lo hare tin 1
yell leader elected in fall elections, with liis term In rim
from tin' starl of basket hall season through the end of the
follou ing foot Imll season.
I his change in term would enable the new yell leader l<> polish
his techniques during a time ol year when pressurr on him was
not as great as in football season. I'oothall season, then, would
come as an appropriate climax to his \car and at a time when he
was far more experienced in his job.
I his woidd also furnish fans with a more interested s< !l leader
lot* sports other than football, since he would be nrwei in his job
and try ing to build a 112 ollowing. Now, as soon as I'oothall has ended,
yell leaders lose much of their interest and enthusiasm lor the
remainder of the sports program. The past basketball season is
an excellent example ol this.
A further advantage of full election would he the op
portunity lo hold n sort of try-out for candidates. A pre
sume or hidf-iime portion of an early-season game could
he set aside for candidates lo gel a chance lo h ad a yell
or two in front of an actual crowd.
This real-situation try-out woidd not only reveal mechanical
yell-leading ability of candidates, but would also to some degree
show how the\ could control a crowd. It is lo he exprrled that
the stands would give them a rough time and this tot would
show who could keep his poise ami who couldii I.
H e think this change would be superior lo a selection
hy a hoard, because we feel no hoard would he enough of
an authority in selection to overcome the natural antag
onism a yell leader would face from a student body which
hadn*t had the opportunity to choose him.
These proposals w ill not be a cure-all for the \ell-leading situ
ation here. INo matter what the selection method, it still takes
good candidates; and after the selection il takes a cooperative
student body to produce good yell leading.
We think, however, that what is now a poor system can be
improved by a change in election time, a shift in l< rm, and real
situation trv-outs.

hadn*t had the opportunity to choose him.
These proposals w ill not be a cure-all for the \ell-leading situ

good candidates; and after the selection il takes a cooperative

Stanford's METHOD of selecting a head yell leader has long been
criticized. The principal complaint is thai election depends ton
much on stunts or hoopla and too little on abilitv. A a result
yrll loaders have been circled who <*<>111 <lit I control a crowd, or
who didn't know anything aitout the mechanics ol veil leading.
Most criticism of the process calls for a change ol procedure
to one wherehv selection ol a yell leader is done hy some sort ol
