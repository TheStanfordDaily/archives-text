# Faubus Dominates Passage Of Blood Labeling by Race
## 
### J. R. Bennett Teaching Assistant, English Department 
Under the domination of Gover
nor Faubus, who is possibly the
most popular man in the history
of the state, the members of the j
62nd Arkansas Assembly passed i
a series of extremely restrictive
and repressive laws. The Assem
bly, following Louisiana, made i
compulsory the labeling by race
of all blood taken for use in trans
fusions. And it is now unlawful I
in Arkansas for any member of
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
to be employed by any state,
county or city unit of govern
ment, or any school district.
Reactionary Tendencies
But my purpose is not to add
further evidence of the already
widely and loudly publicized re '
actionary tendencies in the South.
1 believe, in fact, that the cer
tainly justified indignation by
non-Southerners against the re
pressive and illiberal tendencies
of the majority of Southerners
has had I lie unfortunate effect of
obscuring I he fact that there is
a significant liberal minority in
the South. It is time, I suggest,
to turn more attention and sup
port to the many individuals,
newspapers and institutions 1 hut
are fighting daily within the
South for extension of civil liber
ties and increase of toleration
among people of different race.
Governor Faubus received
through the legislature most of
the measures he asked for in his
third - term inaugural address.
Consequently, perhaps it seems I
to many people that all resistance
has ceased or has become ineffec-'

tive. But it is highly significant
that many other repressive bills
did not reach the status of law,
and that an important minor ity of
Arkansans stood against the pres
sure of segregation sentiment.
Two instances will illustrate the
growing opposition to Faubus in
the Assembly. House Bill 529, to
make il unlawful to disturb tin*
peace by advocating disobedience
of slate laws or nonconformity
with "the established customs and
traditions" of the state, died in
the House. Nine senators voted
against the blood-labeling bill, and
one Senator, Sam Levine of Pine
Bluff, condemned it on the floor
of the Senate.
These are only a few examples
of courage and clarily in the
South by Arkansans, but people
like Senator Levine can be found
in every deep-South state. And
all over the South people are
ready and eager to contribute
more actively to increasing civil
liberties and racial toleration, but
are prevented from doing so by
the enormous difficulties involved
in standing against majority opin
ion.
Seek Support
Many of these individuals
would be more aciively engaged
were they encouraged and sup
ported by people who share their
convictions. These people will be
the ones to bear the daily light
fpr more democratic forms in the
South. It is time, therefore, for
us here within the security of
Stanford's walls at least to begin
to end the appalling lack of
awareness about those individuals
who are doing the actual fighting
for liberty and toleration. We
should begin to seek them out and
to support them personally.

tive. But it is highly significant
that many other repressive bills
did not reach the status of law,
and that an important minor ity of
Arkansans stood against the pres
sure of segregation sentiment.
Two instances will illustrate the
growing opposition to Faubus in
the Assembly. House Bill 529, to
make il unlawful to disturb tin*
peace by advocating disobedience
of slate laws or nonconformity
with "the established customs and
traditions" of the state, died in
the House. Nine senators voted
against the blood-labeling bill, and
one Senator, Sam Levine of Pine
Bluff, condemned it on the floor
of the Senate.
These are only a few examples
of courage and clarily in the
South by Arkansans, but people
like Senator Levine can be found
in every deep-South state. And
all over the South people are
ready and eager to contribute
more actively to increasing civil
liberties and racial toleration, but
are prevented from doing so by
the enormous difficulties involved
in standing against majority opin
ion.
Seek Support
Many of these individuals
would be more aciively engaged
were they encouraged and sup
ported by people who share their
convictions. These people will be
the ones to bear the daily light
fpr more democratic forms in the
South. It is time, therefore, for
us here within the security of
Stanford's walls at least to begin
to end the appalling lack of
awareness about those individuals
who are doing the actual fighting
for liberty and toleration. We
should begin to seek them out and
to support them personally.
Under the domination of Gover
nor Faubus, who is possibly the
most popular man in the history
of the state, the members of the j
62nd Arkansas Assembly passed i
a series of extremely restrictive
and repressive laws. The Assem
bly, following Louisiana, made i
compulsory the labeling by race
of all blood taken for use in trans
fusions. And it is now unlawful I
in Arkansas for any member of
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
to be employed by any state,
county or city unit of govern
ment, or any school district.
Reactionary Tendencies
But my purpose is not to add
further evidence of the already
widely and loudly publicized re '
actionary tendencies in the South.
1 believe, in fact, that the cer
tainly justified indignation by
non-Southerners against the re
pressive and illiberal tendencies
of the majority of Southerners
has had I lie unfortunate effect of
obscuring I he fact that there is
a significant liberal minority in
the South. It is time, I suggest,
to turn more attention and sup
port to the many individuals,
newspapers and institutions 1 hut
are fighting daily within the
South for extension of civil liber
ties and increase of toleration
among people of different race.
Governor Faubus received
through the legislature most of
the measures he asked for in his
third - term inaugural address.
Consequently, perhaps it seems I
