Communism in lr;ii|?
(Alitor, The Daily:
I During the recent weeks, the
i hit-tune of the American press
has been "Communism in Iraq."
II is understandable to claim that
the July Revolution was charae
, terized wilh a wave of anti-West
ernism, but il is pathetically naive
lo recklessly jump to the conclu
sion that any anti-Western move
ment is Communist .The chronic
| disease of the American press,
and policymakers for that mat
ter, is their mechanical, irrele
i vant and unrealistic categoriza
tion of events in terms of pros
! and ant is.
True, there is an emergent
Communist group in Iraq; bui
I the sheer emergence of this
igroup, even when coupled with
j the resumption of diplomatic and
trade relations with Kast Euro
pean countries, does not justify

ilie* current jargon of "Iraq is
ing Communist." licing an Iraqi
myself, I challenge anyone to fur
nish one single proof of any Com
munist influence in the policy o|
the Iraqi government.
Withdrawal from the liaghdad
Fact, trying members of the pre
vious regime, formation of the
People's Resistance groups, and
other issues which are usually ta
ken as indications of Communist
influence, all have been urgent
iemands of popular unanimity
ever since the Revolution and
even before In the UAR, where
he anti-Communisl drive is a) its
peak, these demands are the
same,
So, why is one thing considered
"nationalistic" in one place and
"Communistic" in another?
How is one expected to believe
the American claim that Iraq is,
or is going, Communist, when,
only nine months ago, the same
people used to label Iraq as the
bastion of' pro Westernism"?
