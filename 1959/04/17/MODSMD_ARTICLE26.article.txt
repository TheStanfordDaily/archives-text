(Editor's Note: This is an ar
ticle written by the chairmen
of Men's and Women's Coun
cils to provide a little back
ground on the councils in view
of the primary elections next
week.)

One of the most important, yet
least publicized, offices to be
filled in next week's ASSU elec
tion is tlie Judicial Council, com
posed of five women and five
men. The role of the Council and
the duties of its members have
becu a kind of mystery to Stan
ford students, wrapped up within
the machinery of the Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard.
The Men's Women's and Judi- j
cial Councils have been estab
lished by student decision in the
ASSU bylaws and their decisions
are designed to be constructive
and educative for the student be
fore them. They have not been
designed for a purely punitive
role. The decisions reached by
those groups are a recommenda
tion to the Dean based on a con
fidential meeting.
The cases brought before the
Councils entail violations of ei
ther the Fundamental Standard i
or Honor Code. Before any Coun
cil action, the defendant is noti- j
lied of the charges, informed of
his rights and the procedures, and
then has the privilege of bringing
to the meeting any witnesses or
evidence he wishes for defense.
Any subsequent decision reached
by the Council is not recorded on
the student's permanent record.
The Councils operate for the
benefit of the entire Stanford stu
dent body. The operation of the
Councils and the integrity of its
members are of the utmost impor
tance for the continued good faith J
in the present honor system. In j
the coming primary and final stu- j
dent elections three positions will |
be filled on Men's and Women's j
Councils; the burden of assuring |
the continued integrity of the j
Councils will be on the student
body.
