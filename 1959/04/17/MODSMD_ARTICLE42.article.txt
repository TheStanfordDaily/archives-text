# Stanford Tennismen Favored Over Much-Beaten Cal Varsity Net Squad
## 
### 
The University of California,
with one of its weakest varsity
i tennis teams of all times and one
| of its strongest freshman teams,
will he the opponents of Stan-
I ford's varsity and freshman net
teams tomorrow at Berkeley.
The varsity match which gels
j under way at I p.m. eould produce
j one of I lie most lopsided Cal Stan
j ford tennis contests ever. The
i (iolden Hears recently were whip
pod by their southern cousins
from UCLA, !)-(), with Cal only
be ing able to salvage nine games
in nine two-set matches the clos
est match being a 1 li, c> loss in
the third doubles.
Stanford, which was also
dumped by UCLA, will be trying
to build up I heir confidence again
lin preparation for meeting the
Bruins for a second lime at O.jai
j next weekend.
If the Indian netters are to

score a rout they will have to do
it without the services of captain
and top man Dave Nelson. Nel
son, a senior, will be wrapped up
in a law school entrance exam and
will be forced to miss the match.
Taking Nelson's place at the
top singles spot and meeting C.d's
Warren Sisson will be Dick Og
den, the sophomore net tor who
has played number Ivvo in pre
vious mulches.
The only players given a chance
for Cal are Sisson and Ai l Kono,
the two top players. However,
neither of these two is really the
quality ol Stanford's ()gden and
Lowell Carruth.
The freshman mulch may turn
out to be the exact reversal of the
varsity fray. Cal's freshman team
is loaded with top men while Stan
ford's yearlings leave a little to
be desired. Bill I loogs and Mike
Fanell, the top Cal freshmen, are
probably better than anything the
Bears have on the varsity.

Stanford's Lawry Chiekerinjj
and (Scorer Corfino will have no
easy lime with Parrell.
