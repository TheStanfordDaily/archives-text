Whether Stanford's baseball team can continue their winning ways
and eventually fly a CIBA pennant from the Sunken Diamond flag
pole will in large part be decided during Ihe next two weekends.

to do their winning against California, UCLA. Santa Clara and USC

I without the leadership of captain
and rightlielder Rich DeFabio.

game in more than two seasons
last Saturday. The reason he

playing for at least three weeks.

Ito a slow start this season. His
i usual healthy batting average had
flipped low into the ,200's, and he
