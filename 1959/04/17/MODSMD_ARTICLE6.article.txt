# Ike May Nominate Herter as Secretary
## 
### 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (/P)—President Eisenhower reportedly has decided
to name Christian A. Ilertcr Secretary of State- if Ilerter's health is
up to it.
That picture of the situation developed further Thursday as Eisen
hower and John Foster Dulles conferred for a second time on selec-

tion of a successor to Dulles.
Dulles, 71, resigned Wednesday
because of cancer.
Herter, 64, is undersecretary
and hats been acting chief of the
State Department since Dulles
was stricken anew early in Feb
ruary. Herter suffers from ar
thritis of the hips.
The President's vacation head
quarters disclosed that Eisenhow
er and Dulles first talked by tele
phone Wednesday night regard
ing a successor. They had a sec
ond conference on the same sub
ject Thursday morning, with Dul
les talking again from Walter
Reed Army Hospital in Washing
ton.
The word afterward was that
the two men are agreed on selec
tion of Herter—provided there is
medical assurance the job would
not be too crushing a physical
burden for him.
Medical Checkup
In Washington, it was learned
that Herter has undergone a spe
cial medical checkup at White
House suggestion.
The doctor's verdict was not
known. Herter quietly slipped
away from the State Department
Wednesday for examination by
an arthritis specialist. Such a
checkup is not unusual in the case
of men being considered for top
government jobs.
The administration's concern
apparently was aroused a few
days ago when some members of
Congress reportedly suggested to
the White House that Herter's ar
thritis might make the load too
much.
Eisenhower, who picked Herter
to be undersecretary on Dulles'
recommendation, wants to make
sure on that point.
Arthritis
Herter has served as a member
of the House of Representatives
and is a former governor of Mas
sachusetts. His arthritis first do
velopecl 10 or 15 years ago, his
own doctor said, adding ihat it
has "progressed very little" in the
last eight years.
Herter relies on lightweight
metal crutches to ease the discom
fort he experiencese when stand
ing.
