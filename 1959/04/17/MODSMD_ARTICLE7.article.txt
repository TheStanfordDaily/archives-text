### Barbara Hicks Associate Editor 
ASSU President John Bohn last
night presented to the Legislature
a reorganization of Legislature
which would widen the horizons
of the group, as well as bo an
effective tie between The Legisla
ture and other campus organiza
tions.
Bohn suggested that the Legis
lature have six standing commit
tees concerned with student ac
tivities. The first, the Academic
Committee, would function as the
present Academic Affairs Com
mittee does, that is to discuss is
sues such as honors programs.
The Buildings and Grounds Com
mittee would concern itself with
areas such as the Bookstore,
study rooms and the student un
ion.
Other committees would deal
with (1) Public International Af
fairs—llß, Political Union, etc.;
(2) Traditions and Service—Rally
Commission. Cardinals, Pre-Reg,
etc.; (3) Public Relations -Ram's
Head, Publications Board, etc.;
(4) Student Interest—AWS, ath
letics, etc.
Under Bohn's proposal a mem
ber of Legislature would sit on
each of the boards and commis
sions and these representatives
would compose the special com
mittees.
The investigations of the Legis
lature this year have shown, in
many cases, a weakness in the
liaison between organizations and
the Legislature. Bohn explained
that this plan would make the
liaison more effective, and keep
the Legislature better informed
as to the various activities and
projects.
