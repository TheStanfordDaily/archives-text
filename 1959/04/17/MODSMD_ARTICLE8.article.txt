## Dr. Patterson Will Lecture 
### 
A leading authority on interna
tional economics, Dr. Gardner
Patterson, will be the featured
speaker at the second annual AS
SU-lIR Foreign Policy Institute
to be held at Stanford on May 13
and 14. Dr. Patterson is presently
professor of economics and direc
tor of the Woodrow Wilson
School of Public and Internation
al Affairs at Princeton Univer
sity.
Patterson was approved to be
Institute speaker by Legislature
last night.
The Foreign Policy Institute
was begun last year to expose the
Stanford student body and staff
and the surrounding world com
munity to stimulating lectures on
the United States in the world
scene. Toward this end Dr. Pat
terson will deliver two co-ordinat
ed keynote lectures on successive
days, attend a number of related
seminars led by leading members
of the Stanford faculty and espe
cially organized for this Institute,
and participate in informal dis
cussions with staff and student
body members.
Basic Ideas
As this year's speaker, Dr. Pat
terson will be invited to formu
late basic foreign policy ideas for
this Institute and to buttress
these thoughts with analysis of
timely issues of consequence. The
Stanford University Press has ex
pressed a willingness to publish
copies of the lectures of the Insti
tute.
James P». Reston, foreign policy
analyst of the New York Times,
delivered last year's lectures to an
appreciative and responsive audi
ence of several thousand. Fol
lowing his talks, the Stanford
campus was, to quote the Insti
tute of International Relations,
"alive with the fundamental ques
tions of foreign policy."
Paramount Questions
In the view of the lIR, "It
would seem that the following
questions are paramount in the
minds of a thoughtful world com
munity: united Europe or divided
West; exploding Asia or an ex
panding East; all-powerful Rus
sia or a yielding America; rising
Africa or a decaying continent;
seething Latins or a weakening
hemisphere."
"To assert the necessity of solv
ing these problems is not diffi
cult. This is most urgent, how
ever, to the observer of the mush
room cloud, to the frustrated and
balked negotiator, and to Ihe stu
dent whose endless inquiries lead
ultimately to an intensified des
pair and a re-emphasized confu
sion."

Africa or a decaying continent;
seething Latins or a weakening
hemisphere."
"To assert the necessity of solv
ing these problems is not diffi
cult. This is most urgent, how
ever, to the observer of the mush
room cloud, to the frustrated and
balked negotiator, and to Ihe stu
dent whose endless inquiries lead
ultimately to an intensified des
pair and a re-emphasized confu
sion."
A leading authority on interna
tional economics, Dr. Gardner
Patterson, will be the featured
speaker at the second annual AS
SU-lIR Foreign Policy Institute
to be held at Stanford on May 13
and 14. Dr. Patterson is presently
professor of economics and direc
tor of the Woodrow Wilson
School of Public and Internation
al Affairs at Princeton Univer
sity.
Patterson was approved to be
Institute speaker by Legislature
last night.
The Foreign Policy Institute
was begun last year to expose the
Stanford student body and staff
and the surrounding world com
munity to stimulating lectures on
the United States in the world
scene. Toward this end Dr. Pat
terson will deliver two co-ordinat
ed keynote lectures on successive
days, attend a number of related
seminars led by leading members
of the Stanford faculty and espe
cially organized for this Institute,
and participate in informal dis
cussions with staff and student
body members.
Basic Ideas
As this year's speaker, Dr. Pat
terson will be invited to formu
late basic foreign policy ideas for
this Institute and to buttress
these thoughts with analysis of
timely issues of consequence. The
Stanford University Press has ex
pressed a willingness to publish
copies of the lectures of the Insti
tute.
James P». Reston, foreign policy
analyst of the New York Times,
delivered last year's lectures to an
appreciative and responsive audi
ence of several thousand. Fol
lowing his talks, the Stanford
campus was, to quote the Insti
tute of International Relations,
"alive with the fundamental ques
tions of foreign policy."
Paramount Questions
In the view of the lIR, "It
would seem that the following
questions are paramount in the
minds of a thoughtful world com
munity: united Europe or divided
West; exploding Asia or an ex
panding East; all-powerful Rus
sia or a yielding America; rising
Africa or a decaying continent;
seething Latins or a weakening
hemisphere."
