## TRACK MEET Loss of Relay Foils Upset Bid 
### Dick Barnes 
Lack of ;i top-flight mile relay
team cost Oregon the chance of a
lifetime Saturday in Stanford
Stadium as the Ducks were nip
ped by USC in an outstanding
triangular track and field attrac
tion.
The Trojans, coming through
when I lie chips were down as they
have done since their last dual
loss 1 1 years ago, finished with
1)2 points to 55Ms for Oregon and
-I 11/jI l /j for Stanford. SC in dual
competition beat Stanford 75-56
and Oregon 71 1 .-,-(>oOregon got
a dual split on the day by whip
ping the Cards, 71 (if).
Streak lit Slake
USC, with an 82-dual meet vic
tory skein on the line, and Ore
gon, with a 30-victory string at
stake, were seldom more than
five or six points apart in both
their dual and triangular strug
gles.
Though the issue came down to
the relay, Oregon could field only
a pick-up team which turned in
an atrocious 3:55-5 effort. Had
the Ducks been able to put to
gether a winning quartet, they
would have won the triangular by
a half point and the dual meet by
one-third of a point.
Outstanding performances
came in almost every event in this
first meet among the three
teams. But top honors must go
to Ernie Cunliffe for his double
record-breaking victory in the 880.
Mark Lasted a Week
Leading from wire to wire,
Cunliffe ran 1:49.9 to shatter his
week-old Stadium record by one

tenth and his year-old Stanford
SC meet mark by 1.1 seconds.
USC's Olympic champion Char
ley Dumas set the other new
moot mark when ho high-jumped

out Krnie Sheltons' former stand

In addition, Oregon's liosooe

The featured mile run was an
odd race us I lie field of five start
ed very slowly, thou ran each lap
with ever increasing speed, (hello,
however, host used the pace to
his advantage and won iu 1:07.2
with a terrific kick over the final
220 yards.
Bob Shankland led the tightly
hunched quintet through a 65.7
first lap amidst grumbling from
the stands about the slow pace.
But I lie pace quickened as the
half mile was passed in 2:0H.5 and
the 1320 in 3: 10.5.

Then with 220 to go, CJrelle
turned on the gas from fourth
place, shot quickly into a 10-yard
lead, and finished with a final
quarter time of .">(>.o. Shankland
held on gamely for second, while
Stanford's liertil Lundh was an
unthreatonod third.
Bobby Staton of the Trojans
was the only double winner ot the
meet, though there were several
men who had a first and second
or seconds to their credit. Staten
put on his usual strong finishing
kick to win a -18.0 quarter and a |
21.1 220, then shared in another
win as ho held off Don Chesarek
on the anchor log of the relay.
Cook, besides his 100 win. was
second in the furlong. Steve An
derson of the Ducks won the lows
and k r ot seconds in the 100 and
broad jump, while Dumas added
a second in the highs to his jump
ing victory.
Come-through for Kelly
John Kelly and Armand Do-
VVeeso wore Stanford's other vic
tors in addition to Cunliffe. Kelly,
in typical fashion, came through
with a 24-4'i leap in the sixth
round of the broad jump to nose
out Anderson. DeWeose was up

to par with a 162-10 effort in the
discus as teammate Ilarlan Lim
mer threw 1 56-3 1 •_» to got a sur
prising second.
In the field, Paul Cilelspie and
Jim Backstrand both came up
with all-time bests and unexpect
ed points for Stanford.
6-4 for (iillespie
Gillespie cleared 6-1 in the high
jump to better his personal mark
by 1 :! .x inches and deadlocked for
second place. Backstrand threw
the javelin 212-BU, close to two
feet better than he's ever done.
It was good for third in an event
where he figured to place fifth.
On the track, Bob Monzingo,
Doug Martin and Boh Oesse hung
up new career records. Monzingo
ran a strong two-mile, finishing
second in 9:12.4. Martin, who
stuck right with Monzingo most
of the way, took third in 9:16.5,
more than 13 seconds under his
old topper.

Besse turned into the pace-set
ter in the 440, and had the lead
half-way around the final turn.
Though he couldn't match some
of the finishing kicks and had to
be satisfied with fifth, his 15,7
was three-tenths better than he
has ever done at Stanford.
No Lingering Doubts
The shot-put was settled earlier
than any other event when the
first contestant, Marlin McKee
ver, put his first throw out to the
36-8 mark. Stanford's Jerry Win
ters closed on him every couple
of throws, but couldn't better 55-
6 1 .
The biggest winning upset in
the meet of formful winners was
turned in by Edstrom when he
beat Dumas in the highs. Edstrom
led early when Dumas hit a hur
dle, then held on as Dumas closed
quickly over the last three sticks.
The holding of a morning meet
was well received by the crowd
of 10,000, as was the idea of spic
ing the competition with a third
school. But what will be done in
the future along these lines is not
;is yet known.

by 1 :! .x inches and deadlocked for
second place. Backstrand threw
the javelin 212-BU, close to two
feet better than he's ever done.
It was good for third in an event
where he figured to place fifth.
On the track, Bob Monzingo,
Doug Martin and Boh Oesse hung
up new career records. Monzingo
ran a strong two-mile, finishing
second in 9:12.4. Martin, who
stuck right with Monzingo most
of the way, took third in 9:16.5,
more than 13 seconds under his
old topper.

Besse turned into the pace-set
ter in the 440, and had the lead
half-way around the final turn.
Though he couldn't match some
of the finishing kicks and had to
be satisfied with fifth, his 15,7
was three-tenths better than he
has ever done at Stanford.
No Lingering Doubts
The shot-put was settled earlier
than any other event when the
first contestant, Marlin McKee
ver, put his first throw out to the
36-8 mark. Stanford's Jerry Win
ters closed on him every couple
of throws, but couldn't better 55-
6 1 .
The biggest winning upset in
the meet of formful winners was
turned in by Edstrom when he
beat Dumas in the highs. Edstrom
led early when Dumas hit a hur
dle, then held on as Dumas closed
quickly over the last three sticks.
The holding of a morning meet
was well received by the crowd
of 10,000, as was the idea of spic

school. But what will be done in
the future along these lines is not
;is yet known.

and k r ot seconds in the 100 and
broad jump, while Dumas added
a second in the highs to his jump
ing victory.
Come-through for Kelly
John Kelly and Armand Do-
VVeeso wore Stanford's other vic
tors in addition to Cunliffe. Kelly,
in typical fashion, came through
with a 24-4'i leap in the sixth
round of the broad jump to nose
out Anderson. DeWeose was up

to par with a 162-10 effort in the
discus as teammate Ilarlan Lim
mer threw 1 56-3 1 •_» to got a sur
prising second.
In the field, Paul Cilelspie and
Jim Backstrand both came up
with all-time bests and unexpect
ed points for Stanford.
6-4 for (iillespie
Gillespie cleared 6-1 in the high
jump to better his personal mark
by 1 :! .x inches and deadlocked for
second place. Backstrand threw
the javelin 212-BU, close to two
feet better than he's ever done.
It was good for third in an event
where he figured to place fifth.
On the track, Bob Monzingo,
Doug Martin and Boh Oesse hung
up new career records. Monzingo
ran a strong two-mile, finishing
second in 9:12.4. Martin, who
stuck right with Monzingo most
of the way, took third in 9:16.5,
more than 13 seconds under his
old topper.

Besse turned into the pace-set
ter in the 440, and had the lead
half-way around the final turn.
Though he couldn't match some
of the finishing kicks and had to
be satisfied with fifth, his 15,7
was three-tenths better than he
has ever done at Stanford.
No Lingering Doubts
The shot-put was settled earlier
than any other event when the
first contestant, Marlin McKee
ver, put his first throw out to the
36-8 mark. Stanford's Jerry Win
ters closed on him every couple
of throws, but couldn't better 55-
6 1 .
The biggest winning upset in
the meet of formful winners was
turned in by Edstrom when he
beat Dumas in the highs. Edstrom
led early when Dumas hit a hur
dle, then held on as Dumas closed
quickly over the last three sticks.
The holding of a morning meet
was well received by the crowd
of 10,000, as was the idea of spic
ing the competition with a third
school. But what will be done in
the future along these lines is not
;is yet known.

USC, with an 82-dual meet vic

stake, were seldom more than
five or six points apart in both
their dual and triangular strug
gles.
Though the issue came down to
the relay, Oregon could field only
a pick-up team which turned in
an atrocious 3:55-5 effort. Had
the Ducks been able to put to
gether a winning quartet, they
would have won the triangular by
a half point and the dual meet by
one-third of a point.
Outstanding performances
came in almost every event in this
first meet among the three
teams. But top honors must go
to Ernie Cunliffe for his double
record-breaking victory in the 880.

Cunliffe ran 1:49.9 to shatter his
