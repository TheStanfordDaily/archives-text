## TRACK MEET Loss of Relay Foils Upset Bid 
### Dick Barnes 
Lack of ;i top-flight mile relay
team cost Oregon the chance of a
lifetime Saturday in Stanford
Stadium as the Ducks were nip
ped by USC in an outstanding
triangular track and field attrac
tion.
The Trojans, coming through
when I lie chips were down as they
have done since their last dual
loss 1 1 years ago, finished with
1)2 points to 55Ms for Oregon and
-I 11/jI l /j for Stanford. SC in dual
competition beat Stanford 75-56
and Oregon 71 1 .-,-(>oOregon got
a dual split on the day by whip
ping the Cards, 71 (if).
Streak lit Slake
USC, with an 82-dual meet vic
tory skein on the line, and Ore
gon, with a 30-victory string at
stake, were seldom more than
five or six points apart in both
their dual and triangular strug

Though the issue came down to
the relay, Oregon could field only
a pick-up team which turned in
an atrocious 3:55-5 effort. Had
the Ducks been able to put to
gether a winning quartet, they
would have won the triangular by
a half point and the dual meet by
one-third of a point.
Outstanding performances
came in almost every event in this
first meet among the three
teams. But top honors must go
to Ernie Cunliffe for his double
record-breaking victory in the 880.

Cunliffe ran 1:49.9 to shatter his
week-old Stadium record by one

tenth and his year-old Stanford
SC meet mark by 1.1 seconds.
