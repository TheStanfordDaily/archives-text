# Negro Student Lack: Solution Needed

Staxiokd Univeksh y lias u conspicuous lack, ol Negro students.
I'oreign Negro scholars abound; but if there are more lltaa two
or three non-foreign Negro students here, they keep themselves
well hidden.
The Office of Admissions claims the reason lor this lack is thai
very few Negroes apply, ami I hose who do have 100 many problems
lo become members of the Stanford student body.
Because of segregated schools and other disadvantages in their
Infill school education, the Negro students (.ollege Hoard scores
are usually low.
Hut finances constitute the major problem. Most Negro fami
lies are simply not in a position to send their sons and daughters
to a university that costs■ $2.J00 a year.
I he lew who do qualify receive scholarship offers from many
schools: and when they are given their choice of the best colleges
and universities iu the country, many top Negro students decide
to go East.
Another important reason for their not choosing Stanford is
that there are so few Negroes here.

The I Diversity is affiliated with the National Scholarship Serv
ice for Negro Students, an organization whose sole purpose is to
help Negroes through college. The Service gives an admitted stu
dent a $400 scholarship if the college provides the rest of what he
needs. Hence Stanford actually spends less in scholarships lor
Negro students than for any others.
The Service also sends a list of top Negro students and asks
that they be sent scholarship forms and information. In all other
cases the Office of Admissions does not send applications except
when they have been personally requested.
There is a certain legeml associated with Stanford Uni
i ersity that it is an "exclusive" school ami that the students
who attend it are, to pat it bluntly, snobs. This may be a
reason for (air lach of Negro students.
The "superiority complex" does not come from the price we
pay for our education—-College of the I'aeific and the University
of Southern California costs arc just as high as Stanford s.
Nor does it arise from the University's high academic standards;
Heed and Pomona are not noted for their "better than thou"
attitude.
The Stanford smugness shows itself in many small nays.
When Yvor Winters read his poetry last Monday night in
Palo Alto, a number of Stanford students who would otherwise
have «one refused to because it was a benefit for the NAACP.
The I niversity grounds are hopelessly littered because the
students do not care how the school looks. These small things are
beneath us.
Stanford students have an utter disregard for other people
whenever they are in public places. The surrounding community's
opinion of Stanford has been growing gradually worse for a great
many years. This has been built over a long period of time, and
it has spread until it is shared by many people, Negro students
included.
The only way it can be changed is by a conscious effort on the
part ol the students. And this will also take a great deal ol tune.
It will he slow, but it can he done.
It's something verv worth changing. We have lo live in the
world after we leave Stanford, and a general lack of concern for
anything outside ourselves will certainly not he a great help to
the world today.
A i /anight fa I reappraisal of who we are and what ice
want, of past actions ami subconscious attitudes, ivill be
of great value to Stanford ami to ourselves.
It may not he the only way to add Negroes to our student popu
