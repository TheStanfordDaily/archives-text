# Poli Sci Profs Kendall, Sibley To Debate on War and Force
## 
### 
Stanford STUDKNTS boast about the University's high academic
standards, about the high caliber of the student body mind.
College Board scores and I.Q.'s seem to bear ibis out.
A chance to show and use these minds is rapidly approaching:
the Kendall-Sibley debate on war and force. May 2.
I be debate between these two should be the intellectual event
of the year. These men represent extremes ol" political thought.
Koth are colorful characters and fine minds; each has provoked
a great deal of interest wherever be has been.
I he cost is a paltry 2."> cents; it is on a Saturday night, which
leaves time for students to attend. And if money is left after ex
penses have been paid, it will go to the Sibley Memorial Hook
Fund. All of these reasons are in favor of attendance.
I bis is an event which no student on campus should miss. II
there is any standing room left in Memorial Auditorium on lhat
night, something is drastically wrong with us as college students.
An intelligent student body .should take advantage of the won
derful opportunity which this debate is offering. Let's see thai it
is grabbed.
