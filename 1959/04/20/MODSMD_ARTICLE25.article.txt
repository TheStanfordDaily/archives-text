# Freshman Evaluates Rushing Program
## 
### Maynard Parker 
Editor's Note: Daily reporter
Parker is a freshman who went
through this year's rush pro
gram and pledged. This is his
opinion of the present rustling
system.

Weeks afterward a freshman is
apt to look back on his experi
ences as a rushee in an attempt
to evaluate the Stanford rush pro
gram.
Here the freshman starts rush
with some ideas, but no set opin
ions about campus fraternities.
So-called dirty rushing has ljfcen
kept to a minimum by the no
contact rule, yet it has not im
paired the freshman from meet
ing upperclassmen in any of his
classes or campus activities.

These fraternity men whom the
freshman meets during the school
year face close scrutiny by the
future rushee. He looks for quali
ties in them which reflect the type
of house he wants.
In dorm bull sessions, before
the open houses, the freshmen
will compare notes on their upper
classman friends in order to get
some picture of different houses.
During the first night of open
houses the freshman will usually
visit the houses lie knows he
wants to visit either because of j
opinions formed during bull ses j
sions tor from his fraternity fa i
ther's wanting him to visit ceriain
houses.
Some will argue thai meeting I
upperclasmen is a violation of the

no-eonlaef rule. But who can ar
gue the fact I hat if a freshman
participates in activities with
upperclassmen he will evaluate
(hem just as he does all of the
other people he meets?
One fault is apparent in the
Stanford system. The student is
not given enough time to make
the decision which will affect his
next three years at the Univer
sity.
More time should he available
to the many rushees who cannot
I decide between two houses or be
tween two types of living groups.
Fraternity members, too, would
J like to see rushing spread out
i over a longer period, so that they
I likewise could get a longer, deep
er look at the rushees.
A practicable solution to the
! problem would be to have open
houses during winter quarter,
1 perhaps the three weekend nights
before dead week begins. This
! would give both the parties in
| volved three weeks to think about
j the decisions which would be
made spring quarter.
lnterfraternity Council could
help in this decision making by
publishing its fraternity orienta
tion booklets well in advance of
the open house dates. Parents,
too, would be interested in learn
ing about Stanford fraternities.
During the first week of spring
quarter the fraternities could cut
down the number of open house
nights to two and could devote
the remainder of the nights to for
mal rushing parties. The rushee
would then get a closer look at
more fraternities.
When the IKC reviews this
year's rushing program, it would
be well for them to review the
benefits of the winter rush pro
gram, for it offers many benefits
and no drawbacks. And in the
end, both rushee and rusher
would profit.

Editor's Note: Daily reporter
Parker is a freshman who went
through this year's rush pro
gram and pledged. This is his
opinion of the present rustling
system.

Weeks afterward a freshman is
apt to look back on his experi
ences as a rushee in an attempt
to evaluate the Stanford rush pro
gram.
Here the freshman starts rush
with some ideas, but no set opin
ions about campus fraternities.
So-called dirty rushing has ljfcen
kept to a minimum by the no
contact rule, yet it has not im
paired the freshman from meet
ing upperclassmen in any of his
classes or campus activities.

These fraternity men whom the
freshman meets during the school
year face close scrutiny by the
future rushee. He looks for quali
ties in them which reflect the type
of house he wants.
In dorm bull sessions, before
the open houses, the freshmen
will compare notes on their upper
classman friends in order to get
some picture of different houses.
During the first night of open
houses the freshman will usually
visit the houses lie knows he
wants to visit either because of j
opinions formed during bull ses j
sions tor from his fraternity fa i
ther's wanting him to visit ceriain
houses.
Some will argue thai meeting I
upperclasmen is a violation of the

no-eonlaef rule. But who can ar
