# ASSU Hostel Interesting But Needs More Planning
## 
### Cally Tanner 
The Soviet Union and Red
China didn't really get into (he
picture at the ASSU - sponsored
student hostel last weekend. It
was a "pleasant" â€¢ weekend at
Napa Valley for Pr ofesso r s
Claude Buss and Anatole Maozur
and for the 12 students who par
ticipated. Discussions to u eh e d
briefly on Dulles, Berlin and Ti
bet. This was interesting, but as
far as the Soviet Union and Red
China were concerned, it was nei
their informative nor was it
thought provoking.
We submit that when sludents
and professors are willing to
spend the time and the money to
attend hostels, they should leave
feeling that it was more than a
pleasant weekend with interest
ing personal contacts. Enjoyable
as this may be, it is not an end in
itself. An understanding of the
subject scheduled for discussion
is the main goal; this was not met
or even approached last weekend.
It is true, as Ma/our comment

ed, that the success of such a pro
gram depends largely on the at
titudes of the students. But suc
cess takes more than enthusiasm;
it takes organization. In ihc first
place the professors should be
asked to plan a discussion of the
subject, thereby provoking ques
tions that are relevant. Throwing
meetings open to questions at the
outset is simply asking for a
smattering of facts and opinions
that are not directly related to
each other or to the subject.
In the second place, if the hos
tels set out to tackle a subject
like the "Soviet Union and Red
China," the organizers should
realize that this cannot be done in
one day, to any degree of satisfac
tion. Either they are biting off
too big a chunk, or they aren't
allowing themselves time to di
gest it.
Student hostels have all the pos
sibilities of being both fun and
worth while. It is the duty of
the ASSIJ Hostel Committee to
see that both of these are aecom
plished.
