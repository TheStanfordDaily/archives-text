Rhodes Scholarships wore es
tablished in lS9i* by the will of
Cecil Rhodes, a British statesman.
In providing the special oppor

possibilities of international edu

co-operation between the British
Commonwealth and Ihe United
Stales was necessary for the
world to enjoy peace.
At Oxford young men of these
nations would not only enjoy I lie
academic benelils of one of the [
