Tim other day as I was walking down the street picking up
tinfoil, (Marlboro, incidentally, has tlie best tinfoil, which is
not surprising when you consider that they have the best ciga
rettes, which is not surprising when you consider that I hey take
the best filters and put them together with the best tobaccos
and rush them to your tobacco counter, fresh and firm and
loaded with smoking pleasure). The other day, f say, as I was
walking down the street picking up tinfoil, (1 have, incidentally,
I In; second largest ball of tinfoil in our family. My brother
Eleanor's is bigger—more than four miles in diameter—but, of
course, he is taller than I). The other day, as f was saying, while
walking down the street picking up tinfoil, f passed a campus
and ritfht beside it, a movie theatre which specialized in show
ing foreign films. Most campuses have foreign movie liiealre
close by, because foreign movies are full of culture, art, and
esoterica, and where is culture more rife, art more rampant,
and esoterica more endemic than ou a campus?
Nowhere; that's where.

I hope you have all been taking advantage of your local foreign
film theatre. Here you will find no .simple-minded Hollywood
products, marked by treacly sentimentality and machine-made
bravura. Here you will find life itself—in all Us grimness, itrf
poverty, its naked, raw passion!
Have you, for instance, seen the recent French import, h
Crayon dc Mon Onclc ("The Kneecap"), a savage and uncom
promising story of a man named Claude, whose consuming
ambition is to get a job as a meter reader with the l'aris water
department? J'>ut he is unable, alas, to afford the flashlight
one needs for this position. His wife, Bon-Bon, sells her hair
to a wiginaker and buys him a flashlight. Then, alas, Claude
discovers that one also requires a leatherette bow tie. This time
his two young daughters, Caramel and Nougat, nell their hair
to a wiginaker. So now Claude has his leatherette bow lie,
but now, alas, his flashlight battery is burned out and the
whole family, alas, is bald.
Or have you seen the latest Italian masterpiece, ha Dnntut H
Mobile (I Ache All Over), a heart-shattering tale of a bo.v and
bis dog? Malvolio, a Venetian lad of nine, love hi.- little dor,
with every fibre of his being, lie has one great dream; to enter

When Yamoto recovers, he seeks out Ethel's fiance, Bed

I In; second largest ball of tinfoil in our family. My brother
Eleanor's is bigger—more than four miles in diameter—but, of
course, he is taller than I). The other day, as f was saying, while
walking down the street picking up tinfoil, f passed a campus
and ritfht beside it, a movie theatre which specialized in show
ing foreign films. Most campuses have foreign movie liiealre
close by, because foreign movies are full of culture, art, and
esoterica, and where is culture more rife, art more rampant,
and esoterica more endemic than ou a campus?
Nowhere; that's where.

I hope you have all been taking advantage of your local foreign
film theatre. Here you will find no .simple-minded Hollywood
products, marked by treacly sentimentality and machine-made
bravura. Here you will find life itself—in all Us grimness, itrf
poverty, its naked, raw passion!
