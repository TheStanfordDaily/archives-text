Committee on Academic Affair*

With elections coming up in the
next few days, more interest than
usual is being directed toward
student government and its ad
ministration. It might be well,
therefore, to point up one of the
matters which one should consid
er in electing new class and stu
dent body officers.
One would do well, I think, to
take a long look at President
Sterling's Advisory Committee
on Academic Affairs. The exist
ence of such a committee mani
fests clearly, 1 think, a desire on
the part ol President Sterling to
acquaint himself with student in
terests and opinions on various
subjects which affect student life
here at Stanford. But the consti
tution of the committee is such
that perhaps the views presented
are not really representative ot
general student feeling.
The committee is made up of
students selected by the Presi
dent upon two considerations:
The first is that they have proven
themselves able students and
"campus leaders" and as such are
presumed to be aware of general
student views. The second con
sideration is that they come from
widely separated areas of inter
est so that they can communicate
to their "constituents" the pro
ceedings ol the committee and in
turn receive student ideas and
comments.
Unfortunately, in my opinion,
both considerations often do not
warrant the assumptions which
are drawn from them and these
students are olten adrift with re
gard to general student opinion.
Most of the committee's member
ship is not widely known to the
student body and many of the
leading members of the group
speak for highly specialized inter
ests.
As a consequence of the close
association with President Ster
ling, this committee wields a dis
proportionate influence in advis
ing him what student opinion
really is. It is not that the stu
dent members of the committee
are not able far from it. Within
the group one finds a tremendous
amount of ability in almost all
fields. What 1 do suggest is that
ihese students generally are not
in a position to know and under
stand student opinion and conse

quently their advice distorts the
true picture considerably. If the
purpose of the committee is to
allow the students to express
their views to the President and
reciprocally to allow tlie Presi
dent access to representative stu
dent opinion, then, I submit, the
committee might be constituted
so that it is more directly associ
ated with general student views.
The ASSU Legislature has re
cently established a permanent
academic subcommittee to handle
questions which arise in the aca
demic sphere on the student level.
Perhaps this committee could
meet with the President to dis
cuss academic affairs and to pre
sent student opinion. Such an ar
rangement would provide a closer
and more effective tie between
the students and the administra
tion.
in its dealing with academic
problems in the course ot its Leg
islature work, the subcommittee
would be in a far better position
to be spokesman for the student
body. Interested students could
easily find their representatives
on the subcommittee through
Legislature, and the students
would then have some control
over what is being "palmed off"
as student opinion. In addition,
students with a sincere interest
in the academic process would be
drawn into running for respon
sible office and student govern
ment would thereby be strength
ened and made considerably more
effective.
If such a program as outlined
above were to be instituted, 1
would impress upon those mem
bers of future Legislatures that
they would bear a very great re
sponsibility for accurately and
honestly reflecting student opin
ion and not their own personal
bias. They would be in a singular
position to influence the course
of academic life at Stanford. Stu
dents would bring to the commit
tee their ideas for transmission to
the President and it would carry
the discussions and policy ques
tions back from the President to
the students. In my opinion, this
innovation in student government
would be a very great step for
ward in achieving the goal of a
"better education" toward which
both administration and students
strive.

Committee on Academic Affair*

With elections coming up in the
next few days, more interest than
usual is being directed toward
student government and its ad
ministration. It might be well,
therefore, to point up one of the
matters which one should consid
er in electing new class and stu
dent body officers.
One would do well, I think, to
take a long look at President
Sterling's Advisory Committee
on Academic Affairs. The exist
ence of such a committee mani
fests clearly, 1 think, a desire on
the part ol President Sterling to
acquaint himself with student in
terests and opinions on various
subjects which affect student life
here at Stanford. But the consti
tution of the committee is such
that perhaps the views presented
are not really representative ot
general student feeling.
The committee is made up of
students selected by the Presi
dent upon two considerations:
The first is that they have proven
themselves able students and
"campus leaders" and as such are
presumed to be aware of general
student views. The second con
sideration is that they come from
widely separated areas of inter
est so that they can communicate
to their "constituents" the pro
ceedings ol the committee and in
turn receive student ideas and
comments.
Unfortunately, in my opinion,
both considerations often do not
warrant the assumptions which
are drawn from them and these
students are olten adrift with re
gard to general student opinion.
Most of the committee's member
ship is not widely known to the
student body and many of the
leading members of the group
speak for highly specialized inter
ests.
As a consequence of the close
association with President Ster
ling, this committee wields a dis
proportionate influence in advis
ing him what student opinion
really is. It is not that the stu
dent members of the committee
are not able far from it. Within
the group one finds a tremendous
amount of ability in almost all
fields. What 1 do suggest is that
ihese students generally are not
in a position to know and under
stand student opinion and conse

quently their advice distorts the
true picture considerably. If the
purpose of the committee is to
allow the students to express
their views to the President and
reciprocally to allow tlie Presi
dent access to representative stu
dent opinion, then, I submit, the
committee might be constituted
so that it is more directly associ
ated with general student views.
The ASSU Legislature has re
cently established a permanent
academic subcommittee to handle
questions which arise in the aca
demic sphere on the student level.
Perhaps this committee could
meet with the President to dis
cuss academic affairs and to pre
sent student opinion. Such an ar
rangement would provide a closer
and more effective tie between
the students and the administra
tion.
in its dealing with academic
problems in the course ot its Leg
islature work, the subcommittee
would be in a far better position
to be spokesman for the student
body. Interested students could
easily find their representatives
on the subcommittee through
Legislature, and the students
would then have some control
over what is being "palmed off"
as student opinion. In addition,
students with a sincere interest
in the academic process would be
drawn into running for respon
sible office and student govern
ment would thereby be strength
ened and made considerably more
effective.
If such a program as outlined
above were to be instituted, 1
would impress upon those mem
bers of future Legislatures that
they would bear a very great re

honestly reflecting student opin
ion and not their own personal
bias. They would be in a singular

body. Interested students could
easily find their representatives
on the subcommittee through
Legislature, and the students
would then have some control
over what is being "palmed off"
as student opinion. In addition,
students with a sincere interest
in the academic process would be
drawn into running for respon
sible office and student govern
ment would thereby be strength
ened and made considerably more
effective.
If such a program as outlined
above were to be instituted, 1
would impress upon those mem
bers of future Legislatures that
they would bear a very great re
sponsibility for accurately and
honestly reflecting student opin
ion and not their own personal
bias. They would be in a singular
position to influence the course
of academic life at Stanford. Stu
dents would bring to the commit
tee their ideas for transmission to
the President and it would carry
the discussions and policy ques
tions back from the President to
the students. In my opinion, this
innovation in student government
would be a very great step for
ward in achieving the goal of a
"better education" toward which
both administration and students
strive.

Committee on Academic Affair*

With elections coming up in the
next few days, more interest than
usual is being directed toward
student government and its ad
ministration. It might be well,
therefore, to point up one of the
matters which one should consid
er in electing new class and stu
dent body officers.
One would do well, I think, to
take a long look at President
Sterling's Advisory Committee
on Academic Affairs. The exist
ence of such a committee mani
fests clearly, 1 think, a desire on
the part ol President Sterling to
acquaint himself with student in
terests and opinions on various
subjects which affect student life
here at Stanford. But the consti
tution of the committee is such
that perhaps the views presented
are not really representative ot
general student feeling.
The committee is made up of
students selected by the Presi
dent upon two considerations:
The first is that they have proven
themselves able students and
"campus leaders" and as such are
presumed to be aware of general
student views. The second con
sideration is that they come from
widely separated areas of inter
est so that they can communicate
to their "constituents" the pro
ceedings ol the committee and in
turn receive student ideas and
comments.
Unfortunately, in my opinion,
both considerations often do not
warrant the assumptions which
are drawn from them and these
students are olten adrift with re
gard to general student opinion.
Most of the committee's member
ship is not widely known to the
student body and many of the
leading members of the group
speak for highly specialized inter
ests.
As a consequence of the close
association with President Ster
ling, this committee wields a dis
proportionate influence in advis
ing him what student opinion
really is. It is not that the stu
dent members of the committee
are not able far from it. Within
the group one finds a tremendous
amount of ability in almost all
fields. What 1 do suggest is that
ihese students generally are not
in a position to know and under
stand student opinion and conse

quently their advice distorts the
true picture considerably. If the
purpose of the committee is to
allow the students to express
their views to the President and
reciprocally to allow tlie Presi
dent access to representative stu
dent opinion, then, I submit, the
committee might be constituted
so that it is more directly associ
ated with general student views.
The ASSU Legislature has re
cently established a permanent
academic subcommittee to handle
questions which arise in the aca
demic sphere on the student level.
Perhaps this committee could
meet with the President to dis
cuss academic affairs and to pre
sent student opinion. Such an ar
rangement would provide a closer
and more effective tie between
the students and the administra
tion.
in its dealing with academic
problems in the course ot its Leg
islature work, the subcommittee
would be in a far better position
to be spokesman for the student
body. Interested students could
easily find their representatives
on the subcommittee through
Legislature, and the students
would then have some control
over what is being "palmed off"
as student opinion. In addition,
students with a sincere interest
in the academic process would be
drawn into running for respon
sible office and student govern
ment would thereby be strength
ened and made considerably more
effective.
If such a program as outlined
above were to be instituted, 1
would impress upon those mem
bers of future Legislatures that
they would bear a very great re
sponsibility for accurately and
honestly reflecting student opin
ion and not their own personal
bias. They would be in a singular
position to influence the course
of academic life at Stanford. Stu
dents would bring to the commit
tee their ideas for transmission to
the President and it would carry
the discussions and policy ques
tions back from the President to
the students. In my opinion, this
innovation in student government
would be a very great step for
ward in achieving the goal of a
"better education" toward which
both administration and students
strive.
