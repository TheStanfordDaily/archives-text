## Play Approximates Beatniks 
### Herb Harwick 
"The Entertainer," an Actor's i
Workshop production currently |
at the Marines Memorial in San
Francisco, is a play by England's
John Osborne.
The theme of I he play is very [
similar to that of our own Beat j
Generation ("We're something '
people make jokes about because |
we're so unlike . . . and all we're
trying to do is to call their atten
tion to our problems"), yet in the
process Osborne manages to
bring in both the decline of the
music hall comedians and of the
British empire (the play's topical
background is the Suez crisis,
1956), and despite his lack of sub
tlety, tie them together into a
very powerful parcel. This par
cel, call it social urgency if you
wish, is in the form of a Cheko

vian drama presented through
the numbers of a music hall.
The acerbic, self-contemptuous
stage wit of Archie Rice, the
main character, is matched only
by his irrepressibly indecent be
havior at home. He realizes his
position ("Old Archie, dead be
hind the eyes, is sitting on his
hands"), but his enthuiasm has
gone sour; he cannot do anylhirig
about it.
The performance, as with near
ly all Actor's Workshop produc
tions, is excellent; Robert Sy
monds is superb in the title role,
and Robert Haswell is equally
good as his father- Ihe only suc
cess in the family. Libby Glenn
and Shirley Jac Wagner also turn
in creditable characterizations.
"The Entertainer" plays on Fri
day and Saturday nights.
