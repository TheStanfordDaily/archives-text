# SUNDEEN SAYS:
## 'Administration-Student Coordination Is Lacking' 
### Leo Krulitz, Editor 
"Associated Women Students' housing proposals and the Los Altos
fraternity party are indicative of a lack of co-ordination between
the administration and students," Rich Sundeen, candidate for ASSU
president, told a Roble campaign rally last night.
"Reciprocal lclations must be developed whereby the administra-

tion can present views and poli
cies to the students and whereby
the students' views can be pre
sented to the administration."
Sundeen told the gathering that I
Legislature could be the sound
ing board to accomplish this pur
pose. He went on to outline spe-!
cific ways in which this might be
done by LASSU holding more j
meetings with President Sterling
and by expanding representation 1
on the President's Advisory Com- j
mittee on Academic Affairs.
Howie Anawalt, presidential i
candidate, said that our first need j
is for a Student Union. He urged
construction of the first of two)
units with the money now avail
able.
Persuasive Power
Commenting on student-admin
istration relations, Anawalt said,
"Students have as much persua
sive power as they have good
planning." He commented that
student government must be
made efficient so that it will at
tract good students into it.
In an interview with The Daily
following tiie rally, Anawalt,
commenting on Ihe sphere of
Legislature, said he felt rushing
was a legitimate concern of LAS
SU..
John Judy, another presidential
candidate, urged closer faculty-1
student relations. He emphasized
the need for getting more infor
mation to the students as to what
the ASSU is doing.
Public Relations
N'oting that the president is ;i
reflection of the student body,
Judy said he would emphasize
the public relations aspect of the
office he seeks.
A write-in candidate for every
office was introduced by Master
of Ceremonies Dick Stanford.
William Kartozian, speaking with
the presidential candidates, prom
ised to "reduce the waste high
er up."
