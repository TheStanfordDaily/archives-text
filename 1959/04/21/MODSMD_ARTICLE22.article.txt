Chancellor Konrad Adenauer
has made it plain that while he
may he retiring from active poli
tics, he has no intention of retir
ing from Hie affairs of West Ger
many.
lie speaks of the presidency
which he expects to assume as a
position containing full possibili
ties for continued influence. He
also speaks with certainty of the
continuation of his foreign poli
cies by his successor as chancel
lor.
Hoim Convention
When the Allies sponsored a
constitutional convention in Bonn
with a view to establishing an au
tonomous West German govern
ment, Adenauer was just one of a
group of seedy-looking old men.
They were expected to act pri
marily as caretakers until new
and younger democratic forces
could be mobilized for the pur
poses of government.
Vigorous Delegate
Max Reimann, West German
Red leader whose gray plaid suit

contrasted with 1 lie somber black
of most of the older men, ap
peared to be the only truly vigor
ous delegate at the convention.
But Adenauer took over, lie
fought Reimann tooth and nail,
and tlie influence of Communism
in West Germany was soon killed.
Marie Peace
The old man then proceeded,
over the years, to make peace be
tween Germany and France. He
won the Saar, and in return gave
the hand of German cooperation
to the rest of Western Europe.
He l'drced reluctant Germans to
accept rearmament and a full
place in the defense of the whole
community which I hey had so
often attacked.
Economic (o-operntinn
He joined with Jean Monnet
and Paul-Henri Spaak and all the
others who dreamed of a united
Europe, to make the first and
subsequent steps in economic co
operat ion.
And he stood like a rock
against all the blandishments of
appeasement through which Ger
many might have been reunited,

but on terms favorable to the So
vid Union.
