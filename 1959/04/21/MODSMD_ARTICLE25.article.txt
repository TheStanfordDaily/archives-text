The Two Germanys and Berlin

(Editor's Note: Walter Lipp
mann has just returned from
Knrope, where be lias taken a
first-band look at the Berlin
crisis. This is the fifth of a se
ries on the situation.)
AI the end, the question for us
is how we should deal with a situ
ation which neither we nor the
Russians can change. We cannot
change the fact that there exist
two Merman states and that West j
Berlin is a special problem.
The Soviet Union will not allow i
East (icrmany to be absorbed into i
the Western military and political !
community; if it did so, it would'
sacrifice the strategic control oil
Eastern Europe. The Western
allies will not allow West Met- |
man to unite with East Mermany
in some sort of neutralized con
federation. Eor thai would de
stroy the fundamental basis of
NAT*) which now rests on the
strategic position of Western'
Mermany and the reinforcements'
which are coming from the West
Merman army.
An international agreement
to reunite Mermany is at pres
ent impossible unless either the
Soviet ( nioii or the Western
allies abandon what tbey re- i
Kard us their vital interests.
Since neither side will abandon
its vital interests, all of us
must live with the tad that
there are j *Vo Mermanys and
Berlin.
Speaking for myself. I do not
like this situation. I belong to,
the minority who have long ar
gued that Merman national feel
ing will not accept the partition I
of Mermany, thai some day and
somehow the West Mermans will
come to terms with Eastern Mer
many and the Soviet Union in
order to reunite their country.

The case for a politically neu
tral Germany and for the (lis
engagement of noil ■ Merman
troops lias been inspired by ail
attempt to find an orderly set
tlement of the problem of (icr
man reunification —to avert a
disorderly deal brought about
by an explosion of frustrated
national Ornmn patriotism.
Bui the attempt to negotiate a
general settlement to reunify
Germany has tailed. Thai is the
meaning of the present Merman
crisis. Hut I» sides are against an
agreed reunification and they
must now live with the conse
quences. These consequences in
elude the grave risk that the Mer
man people will not accept the
part ition of their count ry.

AI the end, the question for us
is how we should deal with a situ
ation which neither we nor the
Russians can change. We cannot
change the fact that there exist
two Merman states and that West j
Berlin is a special problem.
The Soviet Union will not allow i
East (icrmany to be absorbed into i
the Western military and political !
community; if it did so, it would'
sacrifice the strategic control oil
Eastern Europe. The Western
allies will not allow West Met- |
man to unite with East Mermany
in some sort of neutralized con
federation. Eor thai would de
stroy the fundamental basis of
NAT*) which now rests on the
strategic position of Western'
Mermany and the reinforcements'
which are coming from the West
Merman army.
An international agreement
to reunite Mermany is at pres
ent impossible unless either the
Soviet ( nioii or the Western
allies abandon what tbey re- i

Since neither side will abandon
its vital interests, all of us
must live with the tad that
there are j *Vo Mermanys and
Berlin.
Speaking for myself. I do not
like this situation. I belong to,
the minority who have long ar
gued that Merman national feel
ing will not accept the partition I
of Mermany, thai some day and
somehow the West Mermans will
come to terms with Eastern Mer
many and the Soviet Union in
