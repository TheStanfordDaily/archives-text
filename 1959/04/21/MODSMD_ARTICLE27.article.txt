Another Jor<l;in Trnck Spectacle
About the closest thing (here could be to a preview of next month's
final Pacific Coast Conference track meet took place on this campus
Saturday much to the delight of the 10,000 morning track enthusiasts
who witnessed the titanic triangular that pitted Stanford, Southern
California and Oregon.
Among other things were four national collegiate bests for the
season i Krnie Cunliffe's 1:19.9 880, Jim (irelle's 4:07.2 mile, Dick Mil
ler's 9:07 two-mile and Charlie Dumas' 6-9% high jump), two Stadium
records, countless come-through clutch performances for all three
sides . . . and about 9,000 fans pulling for Oregon to bring to an end
IISC's fabulous string of dual meet victories.
It was just as well the Ducks fell short. If they had done the
impossible and won the relay, the VVebfoots would have nipped the
Trojans by one-third of a point. This would have brought nothing
but noise from the southland, for

the beloved Trojans were held
from a goodly number of points
by the absence of star sprinter
Angelo Coia (who pulled up in
Saturday's 100) and 25-foot broad
jumper Kill Jackson.
SC wasn't without its come
through performances, however.
For instance, IVlarlin McKeever's
one-shot fj(s-8 effort in the shot-put.
lie never got close to il after that
put, but it was enough to top Stan
ford's favored Jerry Winters by a
fool. Or the brilliant -second relay
leg by little Dean Balxarelf, who
sped past a fading Norm Lloyd of
Stanford in the stretch. I.loyd was
limed in 18.3, which can hardly be
called a failure.
Versatile Steve Anderson of Or
egon had himself a day: winning
in a last low-hurdles field, missing
first in the broad jump by two
inches, arid taking second to team
mate Koscoe Cook in a Stadium
record-equaling 100-yard dash.

Tlie fine crowd and I lie great meet constitute another feather in
the cap of Card coach I'ayton Jordan, who has done more than any
one in two years to make track a spectator sport. An exhibition shot
put duel between Dallas Long, Parry O'Brien and Hill Nieder would
have been all that was needed to most likely add another 1,000 or so
lo the crowd. Jordan reportedly tried to arrange the meeting, but all
three boys had previous commitments.
With such a fine track crowd, it's a shame there was such a poor
as usual crowd at the double-header baseball game that afternoon.
Not only is the sport continually deserving of better attendance, but
staya wavers Saturday missed two beautiful games between Stan
lord and UCLA.
That pitching problem the Tribe was supposed to have this year
sere didn't show itself Saturday. Karl Knssell pitched a good first
&ame (allowing two runs). but was removed in the eighth for a pinch
hitler. The second game, of course, saw transfer Marv Mecklenburg
fire a dandy one hitter at the last-place Brnins.
Mecklenburg, from San Jose City College, is a left hander with a
big motion and a big curve that could develop into one of the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Baseball Conference's toughest moundsmen.
Along with sophomores Terry Lindeman and Russell, he has made
the Card pitching staff suddenly look like the strong point—not the
weak spot of this Card club.
It's the hitting, especially for distance, that has been the big miss
ing factor with Dutch FVhring's charges. The Tribe has played 11
games in the Sunken Diamond and has yet to hit one out—and very
few have even been close. Granted that this is one of the nation's
toughest home-run parks, yet 10 were belted out last season.
You're Missing Good Ball
There is no point in trying to "sell" a baseball team in the columns
of a sports page, but there must be some sort of remedy for this
falling attendance. College baseball is a poor drawer almost all across
the country but not this poor.
The caliber of the sport has risen considerably in recent years.
Much of the alarm over the decline of the minor professional leagues
i abated bv the fact that many of the ball players who formerly
made up the low-minor teams are now staying in college.
II is becoming hard to convince the casual observer that this is
not a "down" year for Stanford baseball. A few All-Americans were
lost, certainly, but the team's performance to date has been nothing
to laugh at.
Most likely, if the roof is going to fall in, it will come crashing
down this week end, when the Tribe meets Santa Clara in a single
game Friday and then the Mighty Trojans in two Saturday games.
I'»ut this team has been surprising all season and it did beat CSC in
;■ preseason noncounter.
While just about every pitcher on the staff has been a "surprise,"
there have been others too ihe most prominent of which at the
moment is sophomore Lee Moench. First-baseman and outfielder Lee
started the season seeing most of his action with the Braves. Some
11 ernendous hitting on that team promoted him to the varsity in tlx 1
absence of right-fielder IJich DeFabio. Last week end Moench crashed
out live hits iri three games, including two triples, and his single in
Saturday's nightcap gave Mecklenburg his 1-0 Victory.
