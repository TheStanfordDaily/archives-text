# Kartozian Enters Race
## 
### 
With my experience as a stu
dent. I feel that 1 am well quali
fied in becoming a government..
The situation is critical enough
to warrant apathy. Nevertheless,
1 am confident. As Con Home
Queen. 1 became broader in scope
and narrower in hallways; but
justice supersedes fruition, so
perplexities become complexities.
With these truths self-evident, all
men are created.
I am running for president as
well as all student body offices.
This has been my ambition ever
since 1 had my first cavity. I
propose to abolish all furtem
blatts in government. There's no
room for such things here. Fur
thermore, large steps must be
taken. My revolutionary, three
point, fuzzy plan calls for:
• Natural childbirth as a pre
requisite for office;
• Student government to be a
dictatorship of the Dreepspeels;
• And lastly, morning showers
only. I have a way of enforcing
these things, and I can do it even
if I'm not elected.
I am a write-in candidate. Re
member: "Kartozian is more
than a person; he is an ideal."
