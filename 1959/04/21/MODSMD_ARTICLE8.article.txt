# KZSU Will Return to Air On Carrier Current Only
## Committee Approves FM 'In Principle' 
### 
KZSU will resume broadcast
ing on a limited schedule this
quarter, preparatory to resuming
full time operations this fall
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler announced yesterday.
John P. Witherspoon, instruc
tor in speech and drama, was
named station director.
The station was shut down last
summer by University authori
ties after an FCC complaint that
it was exceeding its transmission
power and interfering with regu
lar broadcast stations.
Only carrier current operations
will be resumed, Winbigler said.
Plans for an FM station were ap
proved in principle, but Univer*
sit authorities pointed out that
the initial cost plus annual sala
ries and maintenance were so
large that gift funds will have to
be sought.
Committee's Role
Decision to permit KZSU's re
turn was made by Dean Winbig
ler and Dean Philip H. Rhinelan
der of the School of Humanities
and Sciences with consultation of
the faculty Iladio and Television
Committee.
The two deans acted on a pro
posal by a five-man student com
mittee composed of the three re
sidual student officers of KZSU
plus two elected by the staff, and
Professor Witherspoon.
The group proposed that KZSU
transmit both on carrier current
and FM with a Federal Commu
nications Commission license.
Carrier Current, FM
KZSU's carrier current system
transmits the signal along regu
lar electrical power lines. An or
dinary AM radio set at 880 kilo
cycles can receive the programs
in campus dormitories.
An FM station would broadcast
high-fidelity programs to listen
ers in nearby Peninsula commu
nities. Before such a station went
on the air substantial remodeling
of present KZSU equipment
would have to be carried out. A
new transmitter would also have
to be purchased.
Student Officers
Michael J. McCaskey, a senior,
will be student manager.
KZSU staff members must
have a 2.0 grade point average or
better, be registered students, and
prove to the satisfaction of the
station manager that they can
satisfactorily operate the major
units of technical equipment.
