# STANFORD AAUP
## Loyalty Affidavits Opposed 
### Lynn DeLargey 
The Stanford Chapter of the
American Association of Univer
sity Professors made the follow
ing resolution in a meeting Tues
day afternoon:
"Resolved: That the Stanford
Chapter of the American Associ
ation of University Professors
strongly disapproves of the dis
claimer affidavit provision of the
National Defense Education Act
and of any action by members of
the academic community that in
dicates approval or acceptance
of this provision. The Chapter
urges the Congress to repeal this
provision."
According to the terms of the
act. the affidavit is required of
those who receive aid under pro
visions of the act. The affidavit
reads: "I do solemnly swear that
I do not believe in, and am not a
member of and do not support
any organization that believes in
or teaches, the overthrow of the
U.S. Government by force or vio
lence or by any illegal or uncon
stitutional methods."
Oaths for Faculty?
Professor Arthur Wright,
chairman of the meeting, said
that he had been told the federal
administrative interpretation of
the provision, which was that fac
ulty would not have to sign the
affidavit. Faculty members may
be receiving federal funds under
two programs of the education
measure.
Wright said this interpretation
is "presumably subject to Con
gressional or other challenge."
Several faculty members said
they wanted to avoid the incon
sistency which would result if
the group opposed the affidavits
for students and others but not
for professors.
The faculties of the division of
Humanities and Sciences re
solved, in March, that if opposed
the affidavit provision.
The position of the office of the
president has been that it would
be unfair to deny financial aid to
students by refusing to accept the
afidavit.
University Position
The present position of Stan
ford University, according to
Wright, is that the administration
has issued "a mild and qualifier!
protest" against 11k; affidavit, has
accepted student loan and fellow
ship allotments, and is negotiat
ing for further grants, proceed
ing under the interpretation that
faculty need not sign affidavits.
The AAUr meeting considered
protesting loyalty affidavits con
nected with other government
grants, such as the National Sci
ence Foundation grants, but de
cided to confine its protest to the
Education Act.
Of the 30 members at the meet
ing, none voted against the reso
lution, copies of which will be
sent to President Wallace Ster
ling, the National Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare,
and California Congressmen.

ford University, according to
Wright, is that the administration
has issued "a mild and qualifier!
protest" against 11k; affidavit, has
accepted student loan and fellow
ship allotments, and is negotiat
ing for further grants, proceed
ing under the interpretation that
faculty need not sign affidavits.
The AAUr meeting considered
protesting loyalty affidavits con
nected with other government
grants, such as the National Sci
ence Foundation grants, but de
cided to confine its protest to the
Education Act.
Of the 30 members at the meet
ing, none voted against the reso
lution, copies of which will be
sent to President Wallace Ster
ling, the National Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare,
and California Congressmen.
The Stanford Chapter of the
American Association of Univer
sity Professors made the follow
ing resolution in a meeting Tues
day afternoon:
"Resolved: That the Stanford
Chapter of the American Associ
ation of University Professors
strongly disapproves of the dis
claimer affidavit provision of the
National Defense Education Act
and of any action by members of
the academic community that in
dicates approval or acceptance
of this provision. The Chapter
urges the Congress to repeal this
provision."
According to the terms of the
act. the affidavit is required of
those who receive aid under pro
visions of the act. The affidavit
reads: "I do solemnly swear that
I do not believe in, and am not a
member of and do not support
any organization that believes in
or teaches, the overthrow of the
U.S. Government by force or vio
lence or by any illegal or uncon
stitutional methods."
Oaths for Faculty?
Professor Arthur Wright,
chairman of the meeting, said
that he had been told the federal
administrative interpretation of
the provision, which was that fac
ulty would not have to sign the
affidavit. Faculty members may
be receiving federal funds under
two programs of the education
measure.
Wright said this interpretation
is "presumably subject to Con
gressional or other challenge."
Several faculty members said
they wanted to avoid the incon
sistency which would result if
the group opposed the affidavits
for students and others but not
for professors.
The faculties of the division of
Humanities and Sciences re
solved, in March, that if opposed
the affidavit provision.
The position of the office of the
president has been that it would
be unfair to deny financial aid to
students by refusing to accept the
afidavit.
