Thinking people on this cam
pus are inclined to wonder, espe
dally a( ejection time, how much
power the ASSU has, if any. We
can agree immediately that the
student government does not
have the power and sanction of a
Sovereign state.
Obviously the students don't
possess this kind of power, but
we can have a different sort of
power in our dealings with the
school administration and in the
development of student initiative.
We may enjoy power to per
suade with intelligent plans.
(When student groups develop
and el t'ectively pres en t well
Jounded ideas they are in a strong
position to gain acceptance of
what they want.) We can't com
pel the administration, but we
can agitate with great effect
when we present sound policies.
The ASSU should deal with is
sues which are of primary con
cern to various segments of the
student body. It should be a bit
to form effective policies which
will help the various groups to
get what they want.
The student government should
help the freshman men to get a
more convenient lushing proce
dure if they want it. It should
help student social groups to ob
tain a greater degree of self-disci
pline it they so desire.
My point is that ihe ASSU
should be visibly active in the so
lution of problems that students
are actively involved in. Since I
came to Stanford, I have never
been satisfied that the student
government has supplied positive
leadership in such fields.
11 the ASSU will thoroughly ex
amine the type of issue 1 am
suggesting and deliver effective
solutions for problems that exist,
then the students may develop a
real interest and exert a real pres
sure on the administration.
112 would attempt to bring the
many student groups into co-op
eration with the ASSU so we may
deal effectively with their - intei
ests and needs, li there is a prob
lem, we won't just discuss it we
will solve it.

The editorial column of last
week's Daily presented a new
plan for 1 the selection of head yell
leader. This plan certainly de
set evs seri ou s attention, but
whether or not The Daily's pro
posal ever goes into effect, a gen
eral revamping of the yell lead
ing organization is needed.
By using the talenls of the en
tire squad of y^*ll leaders we
should he able to provide the
much-needed variety in the style
and presentation of yells.
Increasing the participation of
the assistant yell leaders would
give us an excellent training
ground for future candidates for
head yell leader . Those persons
who are inter ested in yell leading
but are not on the squad would
be invited to attend the weekly
workouts so that they might
learn the basic fundamentals ot
yell leading.
Variety, entertainment and en
thusiasm are the things we need
next year-. The way to achieve
these goals is through proper se
lection arid participation of Ihe
yell squad. This full participa
tion would include co-ordination
of the band, pompon girls, card
stunts and Rally Corn.
I believe that this can be ac
complished, and this is my goal.

During the past two weeks, I
I have expressed to you through
personal appearances and articles

sentiments concerning the role of
' the ASSIJ President. Now you
must make a decision as to whom
you will select to carry out his
proposals in the capacity of your
I representative and leader.
In making this decision I would
like lo remind you of the points
l wish you to consider:
• Positive action toward im
proving student faculty and stu
dent administration relations.
• Student influence in plan
nirig and initiating the new Stu
dent Union.
• An extension upon the foun
dation laid by the present ASSU
administration in the areas above
and also in achieving unity and
strength of student government
as a whole.
In addition to being the axis
upon which student government
revolves, the ASSIJ President is
your personification of Stanford.
For many people their only con
tact with Stanford is through this
man. This constitutes their one
and lasting impression of our
University.
1 make this appeal to you to
give me the chance to become
this representative.

My stand on cheer leading,
which would seem to be unique,
| is the result of a realistic evalua
tion of student motivation. Pur
suant to football games, it is ob
vious that most of us go to be
entertained.
Our loyalty to Stanford does
not drive us to the games if we
dislike football. Instead, our loy
alty gives us a preferred object
upon which we may focus our
football interest.
With this in mind, 1 require no
cheer leading activity to detract
'from the entertainment on the
j field. I won't annoy you with
yells when you are trying to
j watch the game.
If you go to athletic contests
I only out of loyalty, then permit
; me to recommend one of the oth
er- condidates. i seek the support
lof those who wish to be enter
tained.
Recently it has been suggested
that cheer leaders be selected
rathe) than elected. Another sitg
gestion is that the election take
place in the tall altej football sea
j son.
I am against both of these sug
gestions. A term ol ottlce run
. ning winter spring autumn quar
ters will restrict the candidates to
sophomores and juniors with the
possible exception of those sen
iors who know they will be grad
uate students at Stanford.
Selection rather than election
will take most of the colorful
campaigning out of tin 1 spring
elections. This might, of course,
be a good idea it would reduce
the load of Elections Commission
nobody would vote and per
haps another committee could be
eliminated.

In the two and a half years that
I've been at Stanford, I've no
ticed a definite lack of student en
tertainments at the games, such
as not enough good enough en
trances provided for by the yell
leaders or half-time stunts.
At the present time, we have
an excellent band, but it is in
tended more for the public rather
than for the students, and the
same goes for the card stunts, for
most of us are performing them.
So what have we had that is en
tertaining for the rooting sec
tion?
Relatively little; most things
have been done in a serious man
ner-. I feel this lack has a definite
effect upon the spirit in and out
of the games, the spirit of want
ing to come to the*games, besides
to see the games, to see what en
tertainment is provided for this
week and how good il is corn
pared to ihe previous week.
Then upon satisfaction of the
entertainment, the spirit of want
ing to respond to the request of
the yell leaders is greater than if
there were no entertainments at
all. My intention is to promote
the improvement of this lacking
by providing good entrances and
student entertainments through
the help of the assistant yell lead
ers, the Rally Corn and other in
lerested students,
('on ce r n ing the proposed
changed by The Daily in electing
the Head Yell Leader in the fall,
I fully agree. I believe such a
method would provide the stu
dent body an opportunity to see
the candidates under actual con
dition. This way, the student
body will gel to see what they
are getting into.

The purpose of student govern
ment is to represent the students
in all spheres of student life. The
student government must play an
integral part in each of these
fields by either enacting practical
legislation which will he mean
ingful to the students or by as
sertively representing s t u den t
opinions to the administration
arid faculty.
Examples of practical legisla
tion that I would like to bring
about are extended library hours,
investigation of rushing methods,
a Fundamental Standard reeval
uating and, of course, lire devel
opment of active student inter
est in Ihe new Union in order to
hasten its construction.
Besides such legislation as the
above that is clearly the responsi
bility of the student government,
there exists a definite need for
more coordination and closer
unity between (1) the various
student groups on campus, (2i
the students and the faculty, and
(H l the students and Ihe adminis-
I ration.
Better communication between
the various student groups on
campus may be obtained through
a strengthened ASSU Cabinet,
the use of student opinion polls
and more frequent articles in The
Daily.
There is a definite gap of un
derstanding between the students
and the administration. To lessen
this gap is my most important
goal. I would like to create bet
ter reciprocal relations through
greater representation -of student
views to the University adminis-
I ration on student policy.
This plan is realistic in the
sense that we are putting our ef
forts in the direction in which
they are most needed and can
most likely succeed. I would like
the opportunity to take the lead
ership in developing these goals
and making them real.

Student government at Stan
ford has a good basic strut-lure
with recognized limitations. I pro
pose, as a candidate for ASSIJ
Vice-President, to strengthen the
office as ii stands.
The Vice - President's paper
work can easily be done by as
sistants, giving her time to attend
to the public relations and public
understanding duties of her of
fire.
One or two good all - campus
functions should be added to our
social calendar such as a Friday
night Pig Game dance after the
Bonfire Rally. Quarterly meet
ings of all campus social chair
men would give them a good
chance to get to know each other
and to brush up on new ideas.
1 am sineei'ely interested in the
job. I would like to see Stanford's
reputation of the miracuolus bal
ance between rigid pursuit of aca
demic interests and avid pursuit
of fun continue.

Hill Karlozian
I have formulated a simple ax
iom which I call Kartozian's Law
of Winning Athletic Contests
through a Microphone, otherwise
known as Shifa/.zing.
I have always felt that the
cheer leaders get more fun and
enjoyment out of the stunts they
do than the rooting section.
However I feel that if a pom
pon boy were effectively inte
grated with the other student
body offices, like president and
vice-president, the situation would
be manifolded.
My reasons for saying this are
the following:
1. It would help him get n job
when he graduated.
2. It would bolster his ego.

Tony Diii^nian
The policy for Head Yell Lead
er - in recent years has been to
come into office with a fixed set
of standards and ideals. The can
didate often binds himself to
these pre - stated ideals Jo the
point of antagonizing the .Stan
lord student body.
A successful Head Yell Leader
must be ready to adapt to any
change in the disposition of the
student body or to the fortunes of
the team.
An election campaign on the
Stanford campus has for the
most part been of a "snow the
voter" nature. While it must be
admitted that the cleverness and
effectiveness of a campaign can
bo a criterion for selection of a
candidate, it is often forgotten
what the actual candidate is like
personality-wise and elections are
won and lost on stunts alone. A
campaign can be very valuable to
a prospective office holder in that
it can be a tremendous source of
ideas.
It is my contention that the MC
or toast master type Head Yell
Leader, who effectively employs
stunts, properly integrates his as
sistants into the program and
who is generally alert and humor
ous, will be the person the Stan
lord student body wants for Head
Yell Leader.

In the two and a half years that
I've been at Stanford, I've no
ticed a definite lack of student en
tertainments at the games, such
as not enough good enough en
trances provided for by the yell
leaders or half-time stunts.
At the present time, we have
an excellent band, but it is in
tended more for the public rather
than for the students, and the
same goes for the card stunts, for
most of us are performing them.
So what have we had that is en
tertaining for the rooting sec
tion?
Relatively little; most things
have been done in a serious man
ner-. I feel this lack has a definite
effect upon the spirit in and out
of the games, the spirit of want
ing to come to the*games, besides
to see the games, to see what en
tertainment is provided for this
week and how good il is corn
pared to ihe previous week.
Then upon satisfaction of the
entertainment, the spirit of want
ing to respond to the request of
the yell leaders is greater than if
there were no entertainments at
all. My intention is to promote
the improvement of this lacking
by providing good entrances and
student entertainments through
the help of the assistant yell lead
ers, the Rally Corn and other in
lerested students,
('on ce r n ing the proposed
changed by The Daily in electing

method would provide the stu

The purpose of student govern
ment is to represent the students
in all spheres of student life. The
student government must play an
integral part in each of these
fields by either enacting practical
legislation which will he mean
ingful to the students or by as
sertively representing s t u den t
opinions to the administration
arid faculty.
Examples of practical legisla
tion that I would like to bring
about are extended library hours,
investigation of rushing methods,
a Fundamental Standard reeval
uating and, of course, lire devel
opment of active student inter
est in Ihe new Union in order to
hasten its construction.
Besides such legislation as the
above that is clearly the responsi
bility of the student government,
there exists a definite need for
more coordination and closer
unity between (1) the various
student groups on campus, (2i
the students and the faculty, and
(H l the students and Ihe adminis-

Better communication between
the various student groups on
campus may be obtained through
a strengthened ASSU Cabinet,
the use of student opinion polls
and more frequent articles in The
Daily.
There is a definite gap of un
derstanding between the students
and the administration. To lessen
this gap is my most important
goal. I would like to create bet

greater representation -of student
views to the University adminis-

This plan is realistic in the

The policy for Head Yell Lead
er - in recent years has been to
come into office with a fixed set
of standards and ideals. The can
didate often binds himself to
these pre - stated ideals Jo the
point of antagonizing the .Stan
lord student body.
A successful Head Yell Leader
must be ready to adapt to any
change in the disposition of the
student body or to the fortunes of
the team.
An election campaign on the
Stanford campus has for the
most part been of a "snow the
voter" nature. While it must be
admitted that the cleverness and
effectiveness of a campaign can
bo a criterion for selection of a
candidate, it is often forgotten
what the actual candidate is like
personality-wise and elections are
won and lost on stunts alone. A
campaign can be very valuable to
a prospective office holder in that
it can be a tremendous source of
ideas.
It is my contention that the MC
or toast master type Head Yell
Leader, who effectively employs
stunts, properly integrates his as
sistants into the program and
who is generally alert and humor
ous, will be the person the Stan
lord student body wants for Head

Thinking people on this cam
pus are inclined to wonder, espe
dally a( ejection time, how much
power the ASSU has, if any. We
can agree immediately that the
student government does not
have the power and sanction of a
Sovereign state.
Obviously the students don't
possess this kind of power, but
we can have a different sort of
power in our dealings with the
school administration and in the
development of student initiative.
We may enjoy power to per
suade with intelligent plans.
(When student groups develop
and el t'ectively pres en t well
Jounded ideas they are in a strong
position to gain acceptance of
what they want.) We can't com
pel the administration, but we
can agitate with great effect
when we present sound policies.
The ASSU should deal with is
sues which are of primary con
cern to various segments of the
student body. It should be a bit
to form effective policies which
will help the various groups to
get what they want.
The student government should
help the freshman men to get a
more convenient lushing proce
dure if they want it. It should
help student social groups to ob
tain a greater degree of self-disci
pline it they so desire.
My point is that ihe ASSU
should be visibly active in the so
lution of problems that students
are actively involved in. Since I
came to Stanford, I have never
been satisfied that the student
government has supplied positive
leadership in such fields.
11 the ASSU will thoroughly ex
amine the type of issue 1 am
suggesting and deliver effective
solutions for problems that exist,
then the students may develop a
real interest and exert a real pres
sure on the administration.

The editorial column of last
week's Daily presented a new
plan for 1 the selection of head yell
leader. This plan certainly de
set evs seri ou s attention, but
whether or not The Daily's pro
posal ever goes into effect, a gen
eral revamping of the yell lead
ing organization is needed.
By using the talenls of the en
tire squad of y^*ll leaders we
should he able to provide the
much-needed variety in the style
and presentation of yells.
Increasing the participation of
the assistant yell leaders would
give us an excellent training
ground for future candidates for
head yell leader . Those persons
who are inter ested in yell leading
but are not on the squad would
be invited to attend the weekly
workouts so that they might
learn the basic fundamentals ot
yell leading.
Variety, entertainment and en
thusiasm are the things we need
next year-. The way to achieve
these goals is through proper se
lection arid participation of Ihe

tion would include co-ordination
of the band, pompon girls, card
stunts and Rally Corn.
I believe that this can be ac

My stand on cheer leading,

I have formulated a simple ax
iom which I call Kartozian's Law
of Winning Athletic Contests
through a Microphone, otherwise
known as Shifa/.zing.
I have always felt that the
cheer leaders get more fun and
enjoyment out of the stunts they
do than the rooting section.
However I feel that if a pom
pon boy were effectively inte
grated with the other student
body offices, like president and
vice-president, the situation would
be manifolded.
My reasons for saying this are
the following:
1. It would help him get n job
when he graduated.
2. It would bolster his ego.

The policy for Head Yell Lead
er - in recent years has been to
come into office with a fixed set
of standards and ideals. The can
didate often binds himself to
these pre - stated ideals Jo the
point of antagonizing the .Stan
lord student body.
A successful Head Yell Leader
must be ready to adapt to any
change in the disposition of the
student body or to the fortunes of
the team.
An election campaign on the
Stanford campus has for the
most part been of a "snow the
voter" nature. While it must be
admitted that the cleverness and
effectiveness of a campaign can
bo a criterion for selection of a
candidate, it is often forgotten
what the actual candidate is like
personality-wise and elections are
won and lost on stunts alone. A
campaign can be very valuable to
a prospective office holder in that
it can be a tremendous source of
ideas.
It is my contention that the MC
or toast master type Head Yell
Leader, who effectively employs
stunts, properly integrates his as
sistants into the program and
who is generally alert and humor
ous, will be the person the Stan
lord student body wants for Head
Yell Leader.

Thinking people on this cam
pus are inclined to wonder, espe
dally a( ejection time, how much
power the ASSU has, if any. We
can agree immediately that the
student government does not
have the power and sanction of a
Sovereign state.
Obviously the students don't
possess this kind of power, but
we can have a different sort of
power in our dealings with the
school administration and in the
development of student initiative.
We may enjoy power to per
suade with intelligent plans.
(When student groups develop
and el t'ectively pres en t well
Jounded ideas they are in a strong
position to gain acceptance of
what they want.) We can't com
pel the administration, but we
can agitate with great effect
when we present sound policies.
The ASSU should deal with is
sues which are of primary con
cern to various segments of the
student body. It should be a bit
to form effective policies which
will help the various groups to
get what they want.
The student government should
help the freshman men to get a
more convenient lushing proce
dure if they want it. It should
help student social groups to ob
tain a greater degree of self-disci
pline it they so desire.
My point is that ihe ASSU
should be visibly active in the so
lution of problems that students
are actively involved in. Since I
came to Stanford, I have never
been satisfied that the student
government has supplied positive
leadership in such fields.
11 the ASSU will thoroughly ex
amine the type of issue 1 am
suggesting and deliver effective
solutions for problems that exist,
then the students may develop a
real interest and exert a real pres
sure on the administration.

many student groups into co-op

The editorial column of last
week's Daily presented a new
plan for 1 the selection of head yell
leader. This plan certainly de
set evs seri ou s attention, but
whether or not The Daily's pro
posal ever goes into effect, a gen
eral revamping of the yell lead
ing organization is needed.
By using the talenls of the en
tire squad of y^*ll leaders we
should he able to provide the
much-needed variety in the style
and presentation of yells.
Increasing the participation of
the assistant yell leaders would
give us an excellent training
ground for future candidates for
head yell leader . Those persons
who are inter ested in yell leading
but are not on the squad would
be invited to attend the weekly
workouts so that they might
learn the basic fundamentals ot
yell leading.
Variety, entertainment and en
thusiasm are the things we need
next year-. The way to achieve
these goals is through proper se
lection arid participation of Ihe
yell squad. This full participa
tion would include co-ordination
of the band, pompon girls, card
stunts and Rally Corn.
I believe that this can be ac
complished, and this is my goal.

• Student influence in plan

• An extension upon the foun

strength of student government

In addition to being the axis

My stand on cheer leading,
which would seem to be unique,
| is the result of a realistic evalua
tion of student motivation. Pur
suant to football games, it is ob
vious that most of us go to be
entertained.
Our loyalty to Stanford does
not drive us to the games if we
dislike football. Instead, our loy
alty gives us a preferred object
upon which we may focus our
football interest.
With this in mind, 1 require no
cheer leading activity to detract
'from the entertainment on the
j field. I won't annoy you with
yells when you are trying to
j watch the game.
If you go to athletic contests
I only out of loyalty, then permit
; me to recommend one of the oth
er- condidates. i seek the support
lof those who wish to be enter
tained.
Recently it has been suggested
that cheer leaders be selected
rathe) than elected. Another sitg
gestion is that the election take
place in the tall altej football sea
j son.
I am against both of these sug
gestions. A term ol ottlce run
. ning winter spring autumn quar
ters will restrict the candidates to
sophomores and juniors with the
possible exception of those sen
iors who know they will be grad
uate students at Stanford.
Selection rather than election
will take most of the colorful
campaigning out of tin 1 spring
elections. This might, of course,
be a good idea it would reduce
the load of Elections Commission
nobody would vote and per
haps another committee could be
eliminated.

In the two and a half years that
I've been at Stanford, I've no
ticed a definite lack of student en
tertainments at the games, such
as not enough good enough en
trances provided for by the yell
leaders or half-time stunts.
At the present time, we have
an excellent band, but it is in
tended more for the public rather
than for the students, and the
same goes for the card stunts, for
most of us are performing them.
So what have we had that is en
tertaining for the rooting sec
tion?
Relatively little; most things
have been done in a serious man
ner-. I feel this lack has a definite
effect upon the spirit in and out
of the games, the spirit of want
ing to come to the*games, besides
to see the games, to see what en
tertainment is provided for this
week and how good il is corn
pared to ihe previous week.
Then upon satisfaction of the
entertainment, the spirit of want
ing to respond to the request of
the yell leaders is greater than if
there were no entertainments at
all. My intention is to promote
the improvement of this lacking
by providing good entrances and
student entertainments through
the help of the assistant yell lead
ers, the Rally Corn and other in
lerested students,
('on ce r n ing the proposed
changed by The Daily in electing
the Head Yell Leader in the fall,
I fully agree. I believe such a
method would provide the stu

The purpose of student govern
ment is to represent the students
in all spheres of student life. The
student government must play an
integral part in each of these
fields by either enacting practical
legislation which will he mean
ingful to the students or by as
sertively representing s t u den t
opinions to the administration
arid faculty.
Examples of practical legisla
tion that I would like to bring
about are extended library hours,
investigation of rushing methods,
a Fundamental Standard reeval
uating and, of course, lire devel
opment of active student inter
est in Ihe new Union in order to
hasten its construction.
Besides such legislation as the
above that is clearly the responsi
bility of the student government,
there exists a definite need for
more coordination and closer
unity between (1) the various
student groups on campus, (2i
the students and the faculty, and
(H l the students and Ihe adminis-
I ration.
Better communication between
the various student groups on
campus may be obtained through
a strengthened ASSU Cabinet,
the use of student opinion polls
and more frequent articles in The
Daily.
There is a definite gap of un
derstanding between the students
and the administration. To lessen
this gap is my most important
goal. I would like to create bet
ter reciprocal relations through
greater representation -of student
views to the University adminis-
I ration on student policy.
This plan is realistic in the
sense that we are putting our ef
forts in the direction in which
they are most needed and can
most likely succeed. I would like

• An extension upon the foun

My stand on cheer leading,
which would seem to be unique,
| is the result of a realistic evalua
tion of student motivation. Pur
suant to football games, it is ob
vious that most of us go to be
entertained.
Our loyalty to Stanford does
not drive us to the games if we
dislike football. Instead, our loy
alty gives us a preferred object
upon which we may focus our
football interest.
With this in mind, 1 require no
cheer leading activity to detract
'from the entertainment on the
j field. I won't annoy you with
yells when you are trying to
j watch the game.
If you go to athletic contests
I only out of loyalty, then permit
; me to recommend one of the oth
er- condidates. i seek the support
lof those who wish to be enter
tained.
Recently it has been suggested
that cheer leaders be selected
rathe) than elected. Another sitg
gestion is that the election take
place in the tall altej football sea
j son.
I am against both of these sug
gestions. A term ol ottlce run
. ning winter spring autumn quar
ters will restrict the candidates to
sophomores and juniors with the
possible exception of those sen
iors who know they will be grad
uate students at Stanford.
Selection rather than election
will take most of the colorful
campaigning out of tin 1 spring

be a good idea it would reduce
the load of Elections Commission
nobody would vote and per

In the two and a half years that
I've been at Stanford, I've no
ticed a definite lack of student en
tertainments at the games, such
as not enough good enough en
trances provided for by the yell
leaders or half-time stunts.
At the present time, we have
an excellent band, but it is in
tended more for the public rather
than for the students, and the
same goes for the card stunts, for
most of us are performing them.
So what have we had that is en
tertaining for the rooting sec
tion?
Relatively little; most things
have been done in a serious man
ner-. I feel this lack has a definite
effect upon the spirit in and out
of the games, the spirit of want
ing to come to the*games, besides
to see the games, to see what en
tertainment is provided for this
week and how good il is corn
pared to ihe previous week.
Then upon satisfaction of the
entertainment, the spirit of want
ing to respond to the request of
the yell leaders is greater than if
there were no entertainments at
all. My intention is to promote
the improvement of this lacking
by providing good entrances and
student entertainments through
the help of the assistant yell lead

lerested students,
('on ce r n ing the proposed
changed by The Daily in electing

The purpose of student govern
ment is to represent the students
in all spheres of student life. The
student government must play an
integral part in each of these
fields by either enacting practical
legislation which will he mean
ingful to the students or by as
sertively representing s t u den t
opinions to the administration
arid faculty.
Examples of practical legisla
tion that I would like to bring
about are extended library hours,
investigation of rushing methods,
a Fundamental Standard reeval
uating and, of course, lire devel
opment of active student inter
est in Ihe new Union in order to
hasten its construction.
Besides such legislation as the
above that is clearly the responsi
bility of the student government,
there exists a definite need for
more coordination and closer
unity between (1) the various
student groups on campus, (2i
the students and the faculty, and
(H l the students and Ihe adminis-
I ration.
Better communication between
the various student groups on
campus may be obtained through
a strengthened ASSU Cabinet,
the use of student opinion polls
and more frequent articles in The
Daily.
There is a definite gap of un
derstanding between the students
and the administration. To lessen
this gap is my most important
goal. I would like to create bet
ter reciprocal relations through
greater representation -of student
views to the University adminis-
I ration on student policy.
This plan is realistic in the
sense that we are putting our ef
forts in the direction in which
they are most needed and can
most likely succeed. I would like
the opportunity to take the lead
ership in developing these goals
and making them real.

The policy for Head Yell Lead
er - in recent years has been to
come into office with a fixed set
of standards and ideals. The can
didate often binds himself to
these pre - stated ideals Jo the
point of antagonizing the .Stan
lord student body.
A successful Head Yell Leader
must be ready to adapt to any
change in the disposition of the
student body or to the fortunes of
the team.
An election campaign on the
Stanford campus has for the
most part been of a "snow the
voter" nature. While it must be
admitted that the cleverness and
effectiveness of a campaign can
bo a criterion for selection of a
candidate, it is often forgotten
what the actual candidate is like
personality-wise and elections are
won and lost on stunts alone. A
campaign can be very valuable to
a prospective office holder in that
it can be a tremendous source of
ideas.
It is my contention that the MC
or toast master type Head Yell
Leader, who effectively employs
stunts, properly integrates his as
sistants into the program and
who is generally alert and humor
ous, will be the person the Stan
lord student body wants for Head

Thinking people on this cam
pus are inclined to wonder, espe
dally a( ejection time, how much
power the ASSU has, if any. We
can agree immediately that the
student government does not
have the power and sanction of a
Sovereign state.
Obviously the students don't
possess this kind of power, but
we can have a different sort of
power in our dealings with the
school administration and in the
development of student initiative.
We may enjoy power to per
suade with intelligent plans.
(When student groups develop
and el t'ectively pres en t well
Jounded ideas they are in a strong
position to gain acceptance of
what they want.) We can't com
pel the administration, but we
can agitate with great effect
when we present sound policies.
The ASSU should deal with is
sues which are of primary con
cern to various segments of the
student body. It should be a bit
to form effective policies which
will help the various groups to
get what they want.
The student government should
help the freshman men to get a
more convenient lushing proce
dure if they want it. It should
help student social groups to ob
tain a greater degree of self-disci
pline it they so desire.
My point is that ihe ASSU
should be visibly active in the so
lution of problems that students
are actively involved in. Since I
came to Stanford, I have never
been satisfied that the student
government has supplied positive
leadership in such fields.
11 the ASSU will thoroughly ex
amine the type of issue 1 am
suggesting and deliver effective
solutions for problems that exist,
then the students may develop a
real interest and exert a real pres
sure on the administration.

many student groups into co-op

The purpose of student govern
ment is to represent the students
in all spheres of student life. The
student government must play an
integral part in each of these
fields by either enacting practical
legislation which will he mean
ingful to the students or by as
sertively representing s t u den t
opinions to the administration
arid faculty.
Examples of practical legisla
tion that I would like to bring
about are extended library hours,
investigation of rushing methods,
a Fundamental Standard reeval
uating and, of course, lire devel
opment of active student inter
est in Ihe new Union in order to
hasten its construction.
Besides such legislation as the
above that is clearly the responsi
bility of the student government,
there exists a definite need for
more coordination and closer
unity between (1) the various
student groups on campus, (2i
the students and the faculty, and
(H l the students and Ihe adminis-
I ration.
Better communication between
the various student groups on
campus may be obtained through
a strengthened ASSU Cabinet,
the use of student opinion polls
and more frequent articles in The
Daily.
There is a definite gap of un
derstanding between the students
and the administration. To lessen
this gap is my most important
goal. I would like to create bet
ter reciprocal relations through
greater representation -of student
views to the University adminis-
I ration on student policy.
This plan is realistic in the
sense that we are putting our ef
forts in the direction in which
they are most needed and can
most likely succeed. I would like
the opportunity to take the lead
ership in developing these goals
and making them real.

The policy for Head Yell Lead
er - in recent years has been to
come into office with a fixed set
of standards and ideals. The can
didate often binds himself to
these pre - stated ideals Jo the
point of antagonizing the .Stan
lord student body.
A successful Head Yell Leader
must be ready to adapt to any
change in the disposition of the
student body or to the fortunes of
the team.
An election campaign on the
Stanford campus has for the
most part been of a "snow the
voter" nature. While it must be
admitted that the cleverness and
effectiveness of a campaign can
bo a criterion for selection of a
candidate, it is often forgotten
what the actual candidate is like
personality-wise and elections are
won and lost on stunts alone. A
campaign can be very valuable to
a prospective office holder in that
it can be a tremendous source of
ideas.
It is my contention that the MC
or toast master type Head Yell
Leader, who effectively employs
stunts, properly integrates his as
sistants into the program and
who is generally alert and humor

Thinking people on this cam
pus are inclined to wonder, espe
dally a( ejection time, how much
power the ASSU has, if any. We
can agree immediately that the
student government does not
have the power and sanction of a
Sovereign state.
Obviously the students don't
possess this kind of power, but
we can have a different sort of
power in our dealings with the
school administration and in the
development of student initiative.
We may enjoy power to per
suade with intelligent plans.
(When student groups develop
and el t'ectively pres en t well
Jounded ideas they are in a strong
position to gain acceptance of
what they want.) We can't com
pel the administration, but we
can agitate with great effect
when we present sound policies.
The ASSU should deal with is
sues which are of primary con
cern to various segments of the
student body. It should be a bit
to form effective policies which
will help the various groups to
get what they want.
The student government should
help the freshman men to get a
more convenient lushing proce
dure if they want it. It should
help student social groups to ob
tain a greater degree of self-disci
pline it they so desire.
My point is that ihe ASSU
should be visibly active in the so
lution of problems that students
are actively involved in. Since I
came to Stanford, I have never
been satisfied that the student
government has supplied positive
leadership in such fields.
11 the ASSU will thoroughly ex
amine the type of issue 1 am
suggesting and deliver effective
solutions for problems that exist,
then the students may develop a
real interest and exert a real pres
sure on the administration.

many student groups into co-op

deal effectively with their - intei

The editorial column of last
week's Daily presented a new
plan for 1 the selection of head yell
leader. This plan certainly de
set evs seri ou s attention, but
whether or not The Daily's pro
posal ever goes into effect, a gen
eral revamping of the yell lead
ing organization is needed.
By using the talenls of the en
tire squad of y^*ll leaders we
should he able to provide the
much-needed variety in the style
and presentation of yells.
Increasing the participation of
the assistant yell leaders would
give us an excellent training
ground for future candidates for
head yell leader . Those persons
who are inter ested in yell leading
but are not on the squad would
be invited to attend the weekly
workouts so that they might
learn the basic fundamentals ot
yell leading.
Variety, entertainment and en
thusiasm are the things we need
next year-. The way to achieve
these goals is through proper se
lection arid participation of Ihe
yell squad. This full participa
tion would include co-ordination
of the band, pompon girls, card
stunts and Rally Corn.
I believe that this can be ac
complished, and this is my goal.

• An extension upon the foun

My stand on cheer leading,
which would seem to be unique,
| is the result of a realistic evalua
tion of student motivation. Pur
suant to football games, it is ob
vious that most of us go to be
entertained.
Our loyalty to Stanford does
not drive us to the games if we
dislike football. Instead, our loy
alty gives us a preferred object
upon which we may focus our
football interest.
With this in mind, 1 require no
cheer leading activity to detract
'from the entertainment on the
j field. I won't annoy you with
yells when you are trying to
j watch the game.
If you go to athletic contests
I only out of loyalty, then permit
; me to recommend one of the oth
er- condidates. i seek the support
lof those who wish to be enter
tained.
Recently it has been suggested
that cheer leaders be selected
rathe) than elected. Another sitg
gestion is that the election take
place in the tall altej football sea
j son.
I am against both of these sug
gestions. A term ol ottlce run
. ning winter spring autumn quar
ters will restrict the candidates to
sophomores and juniors with the
possible exception of those sen
iors who know they will be grad
uate students at Stanford.
Selection rather than election
will take most of the colorful
campaigning out of tin 1 spring
elections. This might, of course,
be a good idea it would reduce
the load of Elections Commission
nobody would vote and per

In the two and a half years that
I've been at Stanford, I've no
ticed a definite lack of student en
tertainments at the games, such
as not enough good enough en
trances provided for by the yell
leaders or half-time stunts.
At the present time, we have
an excellent band, but it is in
tended more for the public rather
than for the students, and the
same goes for the card stunts, for
most of us are performing them.
So what have we had that is en
tertaining for the rooting sec
tion?
Relatively little; most things
have been done in a serious man
ner-. I feel this lack has a definite
effect upon the spirit in and out
of the games, the spirit of want
ing to come to the*games, besides
to see the games, to see what en
tertainment is provided for this
week and how good il is corn
pared to ihe previous week.
Then upon satisfaction of the
entertainment, the spirit of want
ing to respond to the request of
the yell leaders is greater than if
there were no entertainments at

Thinking people on this cam
pus are inclined to wonder, espe
dally a( ejection time, how much
power the ASSU has, if any. We
can agree immediately that the
student government does not
have the power and sanction of a
Sovereign state.
Obviously the students don't
possess this kind of power, but
we can have a different sort of
power in our dealings with the
school administration and in the
development of student initiative.
We may enjoy power to per
suade with intelligent plans.
(When student groups develop
and el t'ectively pres en t well
Jounded ideas they are in a strong
position to gain acceptance of
what they want.) We can't com
pel the administration, but we
can agitate with great effect
when we present sound policies.
The ASSU should deal with is
sues which are of primary con
cern to various segments of the
student body. It should be a bit
to form effective policies which
will help the various groups to
get what they want.
The student government should
help the freshman men to get a
more convenient lushing proce
dure if they want it. It should
help student social groups to ob
tain a greater degree of self-disci
pline it they so desire.
My point is that ihe ASSU
should be visibly active in the so
lution of problems that students
are actively involved in. Since I
came to Stanford, I have never
been satisfied that the student
government has supplied positive
leadership in such fields.
11 the ASSU will thoroughly ex
amine the type of issue 1 am
suggesting and deliver effective
solutions for problems that exist,
then the students may develop a
real interest and exert a real pres
sure on the administration.
112 would attempt to bring the
many student groups into co-op
eration with the ASSU so we may
deal effectively with their - intei
ests and needs, li there is a prob
lem, we won't just discuss it we
will solve it.

The editorial column of last
week's Daily presented a new
plan for 1 the selection of head yell
leader. This plan certainly de
set evs seri ou s attention, but
whether or not The Daily's pro
posal ever goes into effect, a gen
eral revamping of the yell lead
ing organization is needed.
By using the talenls of the en
tire squad of y^*ll leaders we
should he able to provide the
much-needed variety in the style
and presentation of yells.
Increasing the participation of
the assistant yell leaders would
give us an excellent training
ground for future candidates for
head yell leader . Those persons
who are inter ested in yell leading
but are not on the squad would
be invited to attend the weekly
workouts so that they might
learn the basic fundamentals ot
yell leading.
Variety, entertainment and en
thusiasm are the things we need
next year-. The way to achieve
these goals is through proper se
lection arid participation of Ihe
yell squad. This full participa
tion would include co-ordination
of the band, pompon girls, card
stunts and Rally Corn.
I believe that this can be ac
complished, and this is my goal.

• Student influence in plan

• An extension upon the foun

My stand on cheer leading,
which would seem to be unique,
| is the result of a realistic evalua
tion of student motivation. Pur
suant to football games, it is ob
vious that most of us go to be
entertained.
Our loyalty to Stanford does
not drive us to the games if we
dislike football. Instead, our loy
alty gives us a preferred object
upon which we may focus our
football interest.
With this in mind, 1 require no
cheer leading activity to detract
'from the entertainment on the
j field. I won't annoy you with
yells when you are trying to
j watch the game.
If you go to athletic contests
I only out of loyalty, then permit
; me to recommend one of the oth
er- condidates. i seek the support
lof those who wish to be enter
tained.
Recently it has been suggested
that cheer leaders be selected
rathe) than elected. Another sitg
gestion is that the election take
place in the tall altej football sea
j son.
I am against both of these sug
gestions. A term ol ottlce run
. ning winter spring autumn quar
ters will restrict the candidates to
sophomores and juniors with the
possible exception of those sen
iors who know they will be grad
uate students at Stanford.
Selection rather than election
will take most of the colorful
campaigning out of tin 1 spring
elections. This might, of course,
be a good idea it would reduce
the load of Elections Commission
nobody would vote and per
haps another committee could be
eliminated.

In the two and a half years that
I've been at Stanford, I've no
ticed a definite lack of student en
tertainments at the games, such
as not enough good enough en
trances provided for by the yell
leaders or half-time stunts.
At the present time, we have
an excellent band, but it is in
tended more for the public rather
than for the students, and the
same goes for the card stunts, for
most of us are performing them.
So what have we had that is en
tertaining for the rooting sec
tion?
Relatively little; most things
have been done in a serious man
ner-. I feel this lack has a definite
effect upon the spirit in and out
of the games, the spirit of want
ing to come to the*games, besides
to see the games, to see what en
tertainment is provided for this
week and how good il is corn
pared to ihe previous week.
Then upon satisfaction of the
entertainment, the spirit of want
ing to respond to the request of
the yell leaders is greater than if
there were no entertainments at
all. My intention is to promote
the improvement of this lacking
by providing good entrances and
student entertainments through
the help of the assistant yell lead
ers, the Rally Corn and other in
lerested students,
('on ce r n ing the proposed
changed by The Daily in electing
the Head Yell Leader in the fall,
I fully agree. I believe such a
method would provide the stu
dent body an opportunity to see
the candidates under actual con
dition. This way, the student
body will gel to see what they
are getting into.

The purpose of student govern
ment is to represent the students
in all spheres of student life. The
student government must play an
integral part in each of these
fields by either enacting practical
legislation which will he mean
ingful to the students or by as
sertively representing s t u den t
opinions to the administration
arid faculty.
Examples of practical legisla
tion that I would like to bring
about are extended library hours,
investigation of rushing methods,
a Fundamental Standard reeval
uating and, of course, lire devel
opment of active student inter
est in Ihe new Union in order to
hasten its construction.
Besides such legislation as the
above that is clearly the responsi
bility of the student government,
there exists a definite need for
more coordination and closer
unity between (1) the various
student groups on campus, (2i
the students and the faculty, and
(H l the students and Ihe adminis-
I ration.
Better communication between
the various student groups on
campus may be obtained through
a strengthened ASSU Cabinet,
the use of student opinion polls
and more frequent articles in The
Daily.
There is a definite gap of un
derstanding between the students
and the administration. To lessen
this gap is my most important
goal. I would like to create bet
ter reciprocal relations through
greater representation -of student
views to the University adminis-
I ration on student policy.
This plan is realistic in the
sense that we are putting our ef
forts in the direction in which
they are most needed and can
most likely succeed. I would like
the opportunity to take the lead
ership in developing these goals
and making them real.

The Vice - President's paper
work can easily be done by as

One or two good all - campus
functions should be added to our

I have always felt that the

However I feel that if a pom

The policy for Head Yell Lead
er - in recent years has been to
come into office with a fixed set
of standards and ideals. The can
didate often binds himself to
these pre - stated ideals Jo the
point of antagonizing the .Stan
lord student body.
A successful Head Yell Leader
must be ready to adapt to any
change in the disposition of the
student body or to the fortunes of
the team.
An election campaign on the
Stanford campus has for the
most part been of a "snow the
voter" nature. While it must be
admitted that the cleverness and
effectiveness of a campaign can
bo a criterion for selection of a
candidate, it is often forgotten
what the actual candidate is like
personality-wise and elections are
won and lost on stunts alone. A
campaign can be very valuable to
a prospective office holder in that
it can be a tremendous source of
ideas.
It is my contention that the MC
or toast master type Head Yell
Leader, who effectively employs
stunts, properly integrates his as
sistants into the program and
who is generally alert and humor
ous, will be the person the Stan
lord student body wants for Head

In the two and a half years that
I've been at Stanford, I've no
ticed a definite lack of student en
tertainments at the games, such
as not enough good enough en
trances provided for by the yell
leaders or half-time stunts.
At the present time, we have
an excellent band, but it is in
tended more for the public rather
than for the students, and the
same goes for the card stunts, for
most of us are performing them.
So what have we had that is en
tertaining for the rooting sec
tion?
Relatively little; most things
have been done in a serious man
ner-. I feel this lack has a definite
effect upon the spirit in and out
of the games, the spirit of want
ing to come to the*games, besides
to see the games, to see what en
tertainment is provided for this
week and how good il is corn
pared to ihe previous week.
Then upon satisfaction of the
entertainment, the spirit of want
ing to respond to the request of
the yell leaders is greater than if
there were no entertainments at
all. My intention is to promote
the improvement of this lacking
by providing good entrances and
student entertainments through
the help of the assistant yell lead
ers, the Rally Corn and other in
lerested students,
('on ce r n ing the proposed
changed by The Daily in electing

method would provide the stu

The purpose of student govern
ment is to represent the students
in all spheres of student life. The
student government must play an
integral part in each of these
fields by either enacting practical
legislation which will he mean
ingful to the students or by as
sertively representing s t u den t
opinions to the administration
arid faculty.
Examples of practical legisla
tion that I would like to bring
about are extended library hours,
investigation of rushing methods,
a Fundamental Standard reeval
uating and, of course, lire devel
opment of active student inter
est in Ihe new Union in order to
hasten its construction.
Besides such legislation as the
above that is clearly the responsi
bility of the student government,
there exists a definite need for
more coordination and closer
unity between (1) the various
student groups on campus, (2i
the students and the faculty, and
(H l the students and Ihe adminis-

Better communication between
the various student groups on
campus may be obtained through
a strengthened ASSU Cabinet,
the use of student opinion polls
and more frequent articles in The
Daily.
There is a definite gap of un
derstanding between the students
and the administration. To lessen
this gap is my most important
goal. I would like to create bet

greater representation -of student
views to the University adminis-

This plan is realistic in the

The policy for Head Yell Lead
er - in recent years has been to
come into office with a fixed set
of standards and ideals. The can
didate often binds himself to
these pre - stated ideals Jo the
point of antagonizing the .Stan
lord student body.
A successful Head Yell Leader
must be ready to adapt to any
change in the disposition of the
student body or to the fortunes of
the team.
An election campaign on the
Stanford campus has for the
most part been of a "snow the
voter" nature. While it must be
admitted that the cleverness and
effectiveness of a campaign can
bo a criterion for selection of a
candidate, it is often forgotten
what the actual candidate is like
personality-wise and elections are
won and lost on stunts alone. A
campaign can be very valuable to
a prospective office holder in that
it can be a tremendous source of
ideas.
It is my contention that the MC
or toast master type Head Yell
Leader, who effectively employs
stunts, properly integrates his as
sistants into the program and
who is generally alert and humor
ous, will be the person the Stan
lord student body wants for Head

Thinking people on this cam
pus are inclined to wonder, espe
dally a( ejection time, how much
power the ASSU has, if any. We
can agree immediately that the
student government does not
have the power and sanction of a
Sovereign state.
Obviously the students don't
possess this kind of power, but
we can have a different sort of
power in our dealings with the
school administration and in the
development of student initiative.
We may enjoy power to per
suade with intelligent plans.
(When student groups develop
and el t'ectively pres en t well
Jounded ideas they are in a strong
position to gain acceptance of
what they want.) We can't com
pel the administration, but we
can agitate with great effect
when we present sound policies.
The ASSU should deal with is
sues which are of primary con
cern to various segments of the
student body. It should be a bit
to form effective policies which
will help the various groups to
get what they want.
The student government should
help the freshman men to get a
more convenient lushing proce
dure if they want it. It should
help student social groups to ob
tain a greater degree of self-disci
pline it they so desire.
My point is that ihe ASSU
should be visibly active in the so
lution of problems that students
are actively involved in. Since I
came to Stanford, I have never
been satisfied that the student
government has supplied positive
leadership in such fields.
11 the ASSU will thoroughly ex
amine the type of issue 1 am
suggesting and deliver effective
solutions for problems that exist,
then the students may develop a
real interest and exert a real pres
sure on the administration.

The editorial column of last
week's Daily presented a new
plan for 1 the selection of head yell
leader. This plan certainly de
set evs seri ou s attention, but
whether or not The Daily's pro
posal ever goes into effect, a gen
eral revamping of the yell lead
ing organization is needed.
By using the talenls of the en
tire squad of y^*ll leaders we
should he able to provide the
much-needed variety in the style
and presentation of yells.
Increasing the participation of
the assistant yell leaders would
give us an excellent training
ground for future candidates for
head yell leader . Those persons
who are inter ested in yell leading
but are not on the squad would
be invited to attend the weekly
workouts so that they might
learn the basic fundamentals ot
yell leading.
Variety, entertainment and en
thusiasm are the things we need
next year-. The way to achieve
these goals is through proper se
lection arid participation of Ihe

tion would include co-ordination
of the band, pompon girls, card
stunts and Rally Corn.
I believe that this can be ac

My stand on cheer leading,

functions should be added to our
social calendar such as a Friday
night Pig Game dance after the
Bonfire Rally. Quarterly meet
ings of all campus social chair
men would give them a good
chance to get to know each other
and to brush up on new ideas.
1 am sineei'ely interested in the
job. I would like to see Stanford's
reputation of the miracuolus bal
ance between rigid pursuit of aca
demic interests and avid pursuit
of fun continue.

Hill Karlozian
I have formulated a simple ax
iom which I call Kartozian's Law
of Winning Athletic Contests
through a Microphone, otherwise
known as Shifa/.zing.
I have always felt that the
cheer leaders get more fun and
enjoyment out of the stunts they
do than the rooting section.
However I feel that if a pom
pon boy were effectively inte
grated with the other student
body offices, like president and
vice-president, the situation would
be manifolded.
My reasons for saying this are
the following:
1. It would help him get n job
when he graduated.
2. It would bolster his ego.

The policy for Head Yell Lead
er - in recent years has been to
come into office with a fixed set
of standards and ideals. The can
didate often binds himself to
these pre - stated ideals Jo the
point of antagonizing the .Stan
lord student body.
A successful Head Yell Leader
must be ready to adapt to any
change in the disposition of the
student body or to the fortunes of
the team.
An election campaign on the
Stanford campus has for the
most part been of a "snow the
voter" nature. While it must be
admitted that the cleverness and
effectiveness of a campaign can
bo a criterion for selection of a
candidate, it is often forgotten
what the actual candidate is like
personality-wise and elections are
won and lost on stunts alone. A
campaign can be very valuable to
a prospective office holder in that
it can be a tremendous source of
ideas.
It is my contention that the MC
or toast master type Head Yell
Leader, who effectively employs
stunts, properly integrates his as
sistants into the program and
who is generally alert and humor
ous, will be the person the Stan
lord student body wants for Head
Yell Leader.
