# Tonight at the Symphony
## Cellist Rose to Open Season 
### Diana Smith 
The overture to "Benvenuto Cel
lini," Berlioz's opera of the career
of the Italian Renaissance artist
and goldsmith, will open the 15th
program of the season's San Fran
eisco Symphony concerts tonight,
wiih the French composer's gran
diose orchestrations and rhythms.
At the opera's first performance
in Paris in lX.'iX the overture was
received with an enthusiasm not
sustained by the audience during
the work itself, and the overture
has come down to us in greater
repute than its opera.
Ralph Vaughan-Williams' Sym
phony No. X follows the work of
a composer well rooted in, though
not limited by, his English tradi
tion.
Vaughan-Williams has said:
"Every composer cannot expect to
have a world-wide message, hut he
may reasonably expect to have a
specific message for his own peo
ple, and many young composers
make the mistake of imagining
they can be universal without at
first having been local. . . . The
composer must not shut himself
up and think about art; he must
live with his fellows and make his
art an expression of the whole
life of the community. If we seek
for art we shall not find it."
The evening's climax in the per
formance by the orchestra and
Leonard Rose one of the three
or four outstanding cellists of our
day of Dvorak's Concerto for
Cello and Orchestra in 13 minor,
Op. 104, will round out the pro

gram with a mood rather different
from the Berlioz opening.
Not a grandiose, but an unso
phisticated and beautifully easy,
outpouring is the Dvorak Cello
Concerto, completed in IX!).> upon
the composer's return to Europe
after his st.ay'in the United Stales.

I am very much in favor of
having a fall election for Head
Yell Leader. I also feel I hat an
early-season game tryout would
be quite advantageous. Thereby,
a candidate could be judged for
his ideas, ability and enthusiasm
rather than his campaign stunts
although these do reflect ideas
and enthusiasm.
I seriously believe thai most
students feel the need lor more
enthusiasm in a I lead Yell Lead
er. The whole yell leading system
definitely has its faults. To rem
edy this, a yell leader must keep
the following goals in rriind:
• Development of sincere en
thusiasm for the job and in
creased leadership.
• Development of entirely new
ideas and schemes in yell leading
shorter, more timely yells,
stunts and acrobatics, and origi
nal entrances.
• Satisfying the wishes of the
student body in order to develop
more enthusiasm in the roofing
section, and leading the rooting
section in such a manner that ev
eryone will want to yell and sim
ply "have a blast!"

I am very much in favor of
having a fall election for Head
Yell Leader. I also feel I hat an
early-season game tryout would
be quite advantageous. Thereby,
a candidate could be judged for
his ideas, ability and enthusiasm
rather than his campaign stunts
although these do reflect ideas
and enthusiasm.
I seriously believe thai most
students feel the need lor more
enthusiasm in a I lead Yell Lead
er. The whole yell leading system
definitely has its faults. To rem
edy this, a yell leader must keep
the following goals in rriind:
• Development of sincere en
thusiasm for the job and in
creased leadership.
• Development of entirely new
ideas and schemes in yell leading
shorter, more timely yells,
stunts and acrobatics, and origi
nal entrances.
• Satisfying the wishes of the
student body in order to develop
more enthusiasm in the roofing
section, and leading the rooting
section in such a manner that ev
eryone will want to yell and sim
