This week end's O.jai Tournament, an annual affair for West Con I
iMinis fans, will probably give a good indication of how Stanford's
tennis fortunes will shape up for hoth the last half of the l'< '< title
rare and the post season NCAA championships.
Stanford has one more dual match left with UCLA that coming
up May la at Stanford and if the Indians want even a share ol; this
year's title they will have to reverse the defeat that the iSruins pinned
on tliein in Los Angeles.
Hotli the Indians and the Itrnins will have a six-man team repre
senting their schools at O.jai. with the Bruins strong favorites to vuin
the tourney. II Stanford, however, were ta upset the applecart at Ojai

I hint's would look much brighter
lor I Ik* Indians in all directions.
Al the beginning of (his tenuis
season there appeared to he only
three schools in the country that
could give the Indians any sort of
scrap for the collegiate title. One
of the schools was UCLA, anothci
was Tulanc and the third was San
•lose Slate.
Since the season has started,
Stanford whipped San Jose in a
dual match, 7-2, hut lost to the
Itriiins, X-l. Stanford's first look
at Tulane and the (»reen Wave's
two stars, < rawford llenry «'xnd
Iton llolmhcri;, will come in the
NCAA championship*; in June.
lIC'I.A, which is still working off
a NCAA penally, won't he eligible
for collegiate championships until
August; so they are out, so far as
this year's NCAA picture goes.
That leaves Tulane and San -lose.
Unfortunately, the lopsided win
by Stanford over San Jose is not

an accurate basis lor predicting the NCAA a Hair. The reason for
this is the difference in number and arrangement of players used in
dual matches and in tlie NCAA championships.
In dual matches the teams use six singles players and three doubles
teams, and the players are matched up with the No. 1's against each
other and so on down the line. This makes depth the most important
feature of a good dual team, since the last three singles or last doubles
count the same in the point column as the higher positions.
In NCAA play the championships are run off in tournament style,
with points being awarded to the quarter-finalists, semi-finalists, final
ists and winner.
Last year both Stanford and USC were blessed with top individuals;
the Trojans had Chief Alex Olmerio and Stanford had footballer and
tennis player .lack Douglas leading its team. The tournament came
down to a final match between Olmerio and Douglas, with the Chief
taking a four-set win and giving I JSC first place and Stanford second.
Successor?
This year both Olmerio and Douglas are gone. USC has nothing,
while the Indians will be relying on either Dave Nelson or Dick Ogrien
to carry the load that Douglas bore.
This will be no easy task, because there are many top players
around in college tennis this year, the most prominent being Whitney
Keeri of San .lose State. Iieeri gives San Jose a great chance to cop the
< rown. even though they have very little past the second man.
O.jai is important in all of this because it is a tournament similar
in style to the NCAA event. If Stanford, whose players have yet to
defeat any big-namers in the tennis wor ld with any consistency, could
ciack LJCLA's hold on I'CC tennis by beating one or two of the Bruins'
highly talented trio of Norm Ferry, Al Fox and Roger Werksman, it
would be a definite indication that Stanford would be a team to reckon
with, come June and the NCAA tourney at Chicago.
