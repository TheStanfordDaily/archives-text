Last night at a large campaign
rally in Branner, Howie Anawalt,

policies and issues.

"1 would like to strengthen AS
SU and organizations such as
IFC so that their policies won't
he overruled by the Administra
tion," he commented.
lie stressed the point that it
was impossible to say what the
president could do with the job
until he has been in it a while.
Anawalt commented that "il
wouldn't be an asset to elect one
person to all the offices."
"Academic ('ommunity"
Emphasizing a need for co-op
eration between faculty, adminis
tration and students, presidential
candidate Rich Sundeen said,
"While there are many secondary
objectives, the majority of us
that are here are here for aca
demic reasons. We arc in an aca
demic community and we don't
take full advantage of our faculty
and what it has to offer."
John Judy, another presidential
candidate, in an interview with
The Daily said that a recommen
dation by Legislature to the ad
ministration on a specific prob
lem such as rushing should be
considered by the Administration
as representing the students'
view, even if this recommenda
tion was opposed by other inter
ested campus organizations such
M S IFC.
Cabinet Investigations
Jle also suggested that the ini
tial investigations of this nature
should be done by Cabinet who
could report to Legislature.
Sundeen suggested several
ways to improve student-faculty
relations: publishing a biographi
cal brochure on the faculty, in
stigating more st'udent-faculty so
cial functions, and investigating
the possibility of holding hostels
for students in professors' classes
on the subject matter of the
course.
Judy recommended to flic lira li
ner rally that a committee be set
up to work with the new student
union director, who is yet. to be
appointed, to determine the
things students would like includ
ed in the proposed new union.

week for ASSU and class offices.
Last night at a large campaign
rally in Branner, Howie Anawalt,
candidate for president, told the
group he didn't want the ASSU
oficers or Legislature to dodge
policies and issues.
"Strengthen ASSU"
"1 would like to strengthen AS
SU and organizations such as
IFC so that their policies won't
he overruled by the Administra
tion," he commented.
lie stressed the point that it
was impossible to say what the
president could do with the job
until he has been in it a while.
Anawalt commented that "il
wouldn't be an asset to elect one
person to all the offices."
"Academic ('ommunity"
Emphasizing a need for co-op
eration between faculty, adminis
tration and students, presidential
candidate Rich Sundeen said,
"While there are many secondary
objectives, the majority of us
that are here are here for aca
demic reasons. We arc in an aca
demic community and we don't
take full advantage of our faculty
and what it has to offer."
John Judy, another presidential
candidate, in an interview with
The Daily said that a recommen
dation by Legislature to the ad
ministration on a specific prob
lem such as rushing should be
considered by the Administration
as representing the students'
view, even if this recommenda
tion was opposed by other inter
ested campus organizations such
M S IFC.
Cabinet Investigations
Jle also suggested that the ini
tial investigations of this nature
should be done by Cabinet who
could report to Legislature.
Sundeen suggested several
ways to improve student-faculty
relations: publishing a biographi
cal brochure on the faculty, in
stigating more st'udent-faculty so
cial functions, and investigating
the possibility of holding hostels
for students in professors' classes
on the subject matter of the
course.
Judy recommended to flic lira li
ner rally that a committee be set
up to work with the new student
union director, who is yet. to be
appointed, to determine the
things students would like includ
ed in the proposed new union.
