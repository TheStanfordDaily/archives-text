SUFFERERS FROM
OVERACT! VE
CONSCIENCE
At last you can ease those
guilf- pangs caused by under
indulgencc in letters to the
family with a super colossal
gift for MOM on May
10th. Can you think of any
thing that would quicken her
forgiveness or cure your con
science more painlessly than
a gi ft of music from her ever
lovin' you? Cogitate a min
ute :
Q. Why does she want
your letters?
A. Because she misses
you.
Q. Why does she miss
you?
A. Because it's so quiet
around the house with
out your thundering
hoof beats overhead,
your rousing basso <or
mezzo ) from the
shower.
Q. How can you alleviate
the situation?
A. Eliminate the silence
with the lilting strains
of her favorite fan
dango.
To wit, give her a:
Couple of booming stereo records.
Choose from the major labels, pre
senting every type of music, top ar
tists . . . from $3.98.
or a
Norelco AM-FM radio. These superb
instruments will project her favorite
FM as well as AM programs through
out the house to eliminate the void
caused by your quest for higher
education. With the works of Kha
chaturian and Shostakovich, Copland
and Wagner encompassing her, she'll
never realize you're not around! No
relco AM-FM radios are priced con
veniently from 569.95 to $109.95.
or an
Extension speaker. Connect it up
yourself, or solicit Dad's assistance,
so M-O-M may enjoy her hi-fi while
she's in the kitchen or gardening.
Extension speakers, complete with
volume controls, begin at $22, a
modest cost for such limitless pleas
ure.
As you can see, once you start con
sidering the possibilities of replacing
yourself with music, you'll discover
they're infinite. And to further
lessen your anxiety and brighten
M-O-T-H-E-R's life, with every
purchase of $20 to $50, we'll (gen
tly) throw in a 1-lb. box of Mac-
Farlane's chocolates, or a 2-lb. box
with purchases of more than $50.
Cift wraps and ribbons arc on hand
for your convenience, and we'll be
happy to help get you back in good
graccs any way wc can!
STOP BY FOR OUR
PAINLESS CURE
SOON!!
After May 10th we'll be
powerless to remedy your ills
