# Withdrawal Discussed By German Ambassador
## Informally Visited Here Yesterday 
### Sarah Lawrence 
The crucial problem in Germa
ny is "equivalency of withdrawal,"
Dr. Wilhelm Grewc, ambasador
from West Germany to the United
States, said yesterday at Stanford
in an informal discussion period.
He explained that, in event of a
withdrawal agreement, U.S. forces
would have to leave the Conti
nent, while the Soviet forces would
be behind the Russian border a
close distance from the center of
western Europe.
Other pertinent points were
brought up by the questions of
students and guests.
Dr. Grewe said recognition of
East Germany is one of the Soviet
aims, but it is not the entire pic
ture. The Russians also want the
elimination of West Berlin as a
free city and are annoyed at "sub
versive activities" and the fact
that Berlin acts as an "escape
hatch," he continued.
Powerful President
When asked about Chancellor
Adenauer becoming a powerful
president, Grewe said there is no
prospect of change in the German
constitution, which limits the ex
tent of the presidency.
The powers of the office may
vary, however, with the tempera
ment and personality of the man
and with the circumstances. The
president nominates the new chan
cellor, who must then be approved
by the Bundestag, or lower house
of the legislature; and Adenauer
will use his power to have the
candidate of his choosing accept
ed, Grewe continued.
The big question in many peo
ple's minds is whether the East
Germans are growing accustomed
to Red rule. In answer to this,
he mentioned that in the economic
field there have been improve
ments, but from the political view
point nothing has changed, or, if
anything, the situation has wors
ened.
No Revolt
"There are no hopes that the
Soviets will withdraw t heir
troops, or, if they do, there is no
way to assure that they won't re
turn as happened in Hungary. I
doubt that the East Germans will
revolt. But they certainly haven't,
become accustomed to Red rule."
In conclusion, Grewe said the
Russians aren't eager to start a
major war over Berlin, although
they might risk a small war with
conventional weapons. But they
have to take into account their
weakness in such places as Poland
and Czechoslovakia.
"If Western powers stand firm,
it will lessen the chance of Red
aggression." he said. "The Berlin
problem can be solved only by
solving the problem of Germany
as a whole."
