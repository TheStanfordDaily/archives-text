# UNIFORMS TOO RED
## Cultural Paternalism Draws the Curtain 
### Dave Quarles 
Tuesday's veto by the State De
partment of a Red Army chorus
and dance ensemble tour of the
United States has serious impli
cations lor Soviet American cul
tural exchange.
Ideologically recognized as a
major part ol the U.S. foreign pol
icy, official and unofficial cultural
exchange between Russia and the
United States has experienced
both great frustration and com
mendable success.
Range of Results
Results have ranged from the
complete lack of understanding
exhibited by the Russian students
who visited Stanford last spring,
as reported in the March issue of
Sequoia, to the encouraging rap
port established between Van Cli
burn and the Russian people last
year.
Perhaps the greatest success
that can he claimed by the State
Department is t lie recent eulogy
of U.S. drama, music and art
given last December by Igor
Moiseyev after an American
tour by his dancers.
Moiseyev, in an address to 600
artists at Moscow's House of Ac
tors, went so far as to say that
his trip convinced him that Soviet
citizens had been misinformed
about the state of culture and life
in the United States.
Boishoi Ballet
Perhaps encouraged by this
progress, the State Department
moved forward recently with a
ruling—after several days of hazy
indecision to allow San Francis
co to see the Boishoi Ballet.
Yet there remains a dreary rec
ord of State Department stum
bling blocks to Soviet and Eastern
bloc entrance and travel in the
United States. Last February a
group of East German skiers were
refused permission to enter this
country for Olympic ski practice.
The latest refusal was given
on the sole grounds that "Red
Army u ii if or in s might be
enough to disturb people." Cer

tainly litis statement should be
enough to disturb people.
The Red A rm y ensemble is
known throughout the world for
its contribution to Russian cultur
al tradition. Attempts to bring it
as well as the Boishoi Ballet to
this country have been made for
several years.
"< ompiete Freedom"
Ostensibly the U.S. policy in na
tional and international cultural
matters has been one of complete
freedom. Only upon this basis
could the United States sustain its
protest against Russian suppres
sion of "Dr. Zhivago." Yet some
Americans appear to place the
Red Army singers, instrumental
ists and dancers in another cat
egory.
Such cultural interference on
the part of the State Department
reflects its tendency to judge cul
tural contributions rather than
facilitate their exchange which
was the original purpose of State
Department intervention.
But, beyond uncalled-for med
dling, the decision indicates an
arbitrary approach w It i c h is
quite dangerous in any matter
—national or international.
Hasty decisions without reason
able explanation which are often
later rescinded cannot help mak
ing an unfavorable impression
upon thoughtful people all over
the world. It is hardly necessary
to point out 1 hat such decisions
are perfect propaganda material.
Reduce Tension
We are admittedly lighting a
cold war in every sphere and in
none less than in world cultural
contribution. Yet most Americans
hope that cultural exchange be
tween nations will also serve to
reduce tension through under
standing.
The State Department might do
well to remember that most Amer
icans would rather meet, a Red
Army uniform on the stage than
on the baltlefield. In this light,
perhaps a revision should be made
in the Department's bumbling be
nevolent cultural paternalism.

who visited Stanford last spring,

Perhaps the greatest success
that can he claimed by the State
Department is t lie recent eulogy
of U.S. drama, music and art
given last December by Igor
Moiseyev after an American
tour by his dancers.
Moiseyev, in an address to 600
artists at Moscow's House of Ac
tors, went so far as to say that
his trip convinced him that Soviet
citizens had been misinformed
about the state of culture and life
in the United States.
Boishoi Ballet
Perhaps encouraged by this
progress, the State Department
moved forward recently with a
ruling—after several days of hazy
indecision to allow San Francis
co to see the Boishoi Ballet.
Yet there remains a dreary rec
ord of State Department stum
bling blocks to Soviet and Eastern
bloc entrance and travel in the
United States. Last February a
group of East German skiers were
refused permission to enter this
country for Olympic ski practice.
The latest refusal was given
on the sole grounds that "Red
Army u ii if or in s might be
enough to disturb people." Cer

tainly litis statement should be
enough to disturb people.
The Red A rm y ensemble is
known throughout the world for
its contribution to Russian cultur
al tradition. Attempts to bring it
as well as the Boishoi Ballet to
this country have been made for
several years.
"< ompiete Freedom"
Ostensibly the U.S. policy in na
tional and international cultural
matters has been one of complete
freedom. Only upon this basis
could the United States sustain its
protest against Russian suppres
sion of "Dr. Zhivago." Yet some
Americans appear to place the
Red Army singers, instrumental
ists and dancers in another cat
egory.
Such cultural interference on
the part of the State Department
reflects its tendency to judge cul
tural contributions rather than
facilitate their exchange which
was the original purpose of State
Department intervention.
But, beyond uncalled-for med
dling, the decision indicates an
arbitrary approach w It i c h is
quite dangerous in any matter
—national or international.
Hasty decisions without reason
able explanation which are often
later rescinded cannot help mak
ing an unfavorable impression
upon thoughtful people all over
the world. It is hardly necessary
to point out 1 hat such decisions
are perfect propaganda material.
Reduce Tension
We are admittedly lighting a
cold war in every sphere and in
none less than in world cultural
contribution. Yet most Americans
hope that cultural exchange be
tween nations will also serve to
reduce tension through under
standing.
The State Department might do
well to remember that most Amer
icans would rather meet, a Red
Army uniform on the stage than
on the baltlefield. In this light,
perhaps a revision should be made
in the Department's bumbling be
nevolent cultural paternalism.
Tuesday's veto by the State De
partment of a Red Army chorus
and dance ensemble tour of the
United States has serious impli

tural exchange.
Ideologically recognized as a
major part ol the U.S. foreign pol

exchange between Russia and the
United States has experienced
both great frustration and com
