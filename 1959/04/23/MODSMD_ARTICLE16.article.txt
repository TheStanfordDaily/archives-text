Editor, The Daily:
This University community has,
in iho past tew weeks, heard a
great deal about "complete and
uninhibited" academic freedom,
the "open forum" concept of the
University, etc. What may have
escaped notice is the fact that cer
tain members of ttie University
community i.e., the faculty of
the Political Science Department
are just now faced with a
unique opportunity to put these
maxims into practice.
There is at present a vacant
professorship of political theory
in the Political Science Depart
ment, and the responsible parties
are looking for a qualified man to
fill the post.
What they may have overlooked
is that there is at present a rr.-.i
performing the DUTIES of the
position, as visiting associate pro
fessor, who is eminently qualified
for the permanent post.
Professor Kendall's worth as a
wide-ranging and deeply penetrat
ing scholar and as a fine teacher,
in the Socratic sense of that word,
is beyond question for those who
know him or have investigated.
So here is the situation: (1) a
vacant post badly in need of fill
ing, (2) a man eminently qualified
to fill it, and (3) a fine opportu
nity to extend the discussion proc
ess in this University to include
an important point of view not
previously represented and not
likely to be in the near future half
so intelligently or half so elo
quently.
The question thinly, if at all.

disguised in these lines is: Why
not hire Kendall? What this ques
tion must not be taken to repre
sent is a presumption, on the part
of the questioners, to wisdom re
garding the hiring policies of the
Political Science Department.
What it may validly be taken to
represent is an expression of an
opinion on their- part and the hope
that that opinion may be of value
to those responsible for the deci
sion. The opinion: thai Dr. Ken
dall's name deserves serious con
sideration.

Kditor, The Daily:
I seek enlightenment:. What,
pray tell, was the moral of your
editorial of April 20 attempting
(in vain, I might add) to connect
the presence of Stanford snobbery
with the absence of a sizeable
Negro population?
I gathered the general drift was
that we (you and I and other kin
dred souls) should rush out and
embrace the good folk of Mada
gascar. Unfortunately, there are
none around. On your-own show
ing, some of the Negroes aren't
bright enough to be admitted, and
the rest are too bright, i.e., they
don't WANT to come to Stanford.
Perhaps you could make out a
better case against the Adminis
tration for discriminating against
the white race via lowering admis
sion standards for Negroes that
is, making skin color, not scho
lastic performance, a criteria for
admission.

Kditor, The Daily:
I seek enlightenment:. What,
pray tell, was the moral of your
editorial of April 20 attempting
(in vain, I might add) to connect
the presence of Stanford snobbery
with the absence of a sizeable
Negro population?
I gathered the general drift was
that we (you and I and other kin
dred souls) should rush out and
embrace the good folk of Mada
gascar. Unfortunately, there are
none around. On your-own show
ing, some of the Negroes aren't
bright enough to be admitted, and
the rest are too bright, i.e., they
don't WANT to come to Stanford.
Perhaps you could make out a
better case against the Adminis
tration for discriminating against
the white race via lowering admis
sion standards for Negroes that
is, making skin color, not scho
lastic performance, a criteria for
admission.

This University community has,
in iho past tew weeks, heard a
great deal about "complete and
uninhibited" academic freedom,
the "open forum" concept of the
University, etc. What may have
escaped notice is the fact that cer
tain members of ttie University
community i.e., the faculty of
the Political Science Department
are just now faced with a
unique opportunity to put these
maxims into practice.
There is at present a vacant
professorship of political theory
in the Political Science Depart
ment, and the responsible parties
are looking for a qualified man to
fill the post.
What they may have overlooked
is that there is at present a rr.-.i
performing the DUTIES of the
position, as visiting associate pro
fessor, who is eminently qualified
for the permanent post.
Professor Kendall's worth as a
wide-ranging and deeply penetrat
ing scholar and as a fine teacher,
in the Socratic sense of that word,
is beyond question for those who
know him or have investigated.
So here is the situation: (1) a
vacant post badly in need of fill
ing, (2) a man eminently qualified
to fill it, and (3) a fine opportu
nity to extend the discussion proc
ess in this University to include
an important point of view not
previously represented and not
likely to be in the near future half
so intelligently or half so elo
quently.
The question thinly, if at all.

disguised in these lines is: Why
not hire Kendall? What this ques
tion must not be taken to repre
sent is a presumption, on the part
of the questioners, to wisdom re
garding the hiring policies of the
Political Science Department.
What it may validly be taken to
represent is an expression of an
opinion on their- part and the hope
that that opinion may be of value
to those responsible for the deci
sion. The opinion: thai Dr. Ken
dall's name deserves serious con
sideration.
