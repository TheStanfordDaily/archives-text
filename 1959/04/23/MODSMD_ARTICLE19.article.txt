# Advisory Changes Suggested
## 
### Barbara Hicks, Associate Editor 
ASSU President John Bohn has pointed lo an
area of activity which deserves attention Presi
dent Sterling's Student Advisory Commit lee. With
more and more student concern directed a 1 aca
demics outside the individual's classroom work
the question of liaison with the administrative of
liters and faculty becomes more important.
Bohn, as a member of the committee and the
head of the student government, proposed that
the students on the committee he those of the Leg
islature's Academic Affairs Committee.
As another member of the committee, I would
like to propose an alternative which, I think, would
more effectively accomplish the goals Bohn pro
poses and which I agree are to be sought.
First, we must remember that the committee
serves as an ADVISORY group to President Ster
ling. It is up lo President Sterling, therefore, to
decide whether the advice he receives from the
committee is valuable enough to warrant the con
tinuance of the committee. Although the commit
tee was formed after students requested it, its pi i
mary concern is, as it now stands, communication
of student ideas 'I () the administration and fac
ulty, and then lo tell the students what administra
tive policy is.
At the last meeting President Sterling indicated
that the group does help him keep in touch with
the currents of student thought. Ilence, until we
hear otherwise from him, we shall assume that he
desires the continuance ol the committee.
Therefore, as Bohn pointed out, we must find
means of making the advice ol the committee even
more substantial and more representative.
Bohn would have the students on the committee
all be members of Legislature. I disagree. This
would not solve one of the problems which I see
lo be a major hindrance to the functioning of the
committee. As Bohn says, committee members are
mostly student leaders Bohn, ASSIJ Vice Presi
dent Clee I looser, 111! President Arden Schenker,
etc. who are in touch with various segments of
the student body, hut they are also deeply involved
in their activities, so much so that they can spend
little time working on committee problems.
Many of the questions which come before the
committee deserve extra study. It is a burden to
the students leading the different activities to
spend the time to prepare adequately for the meet
ings; hence, in most cases, they do not. Oranted
that the administration and faculty representa

tives tm the committee also lead busy lives, hut
ihoy are heller 1 versed on iho problems and gener
ally have to do less preparation.
This leads us to the first recommendation: that
the members of the committee be selected with an
eye to interest, rather than because they represent
areas of the student body. I suggest that this be
done in two ways: <11 applications be made to the
President's Office or to whomever the President
might choose, perhaps a subcommittee of the coin
mil Ice itself; and <2> that the present members of
the committee recommend students they know are
interested and could make a contribution.
However, I agree that a closer tie with the
elected representatives is desirable. This brings
me to my second proposal: thai the students on
the President's Committee form an executive com
miPee of the Legislature, under the chairmanship
of a Legislature member, and act as an advisory
group to the Legislature as well as to President
Sterling.
Although the average Legislature member is
becoming more concerned with academic affairs,
I contend he is still activity conscious. A group of
students who are deeply interested in the problems
raised before the President's Committee honors
programs, for instance balanced by a tie with the
Legislature so thai lliey do not ignore the other
aspects of student life, could be helpful to both
groups.
The third proposal is Iha I of the !. r > or so student
members of the committee, three to live be juniors,
to be on the committee two years. At present em
phasis is on seclcling seniors for the committee.
At the last meeting President Sterling pointed
out that the older members were concerned with
long-range programs; students who are here four
or so years have difficulty grasping these long
range ideas. 1 suggest that those who are on the
committee their junior and senior years would be
more appreciative of these ideas, hut would still
be conscious, if fulfilling their responsibility, of
current thought.
Ai the moment the committee sometimes acts
as an echo chamber for its own ideas, but we umsl
remember that this is only the second year for the
committee and that the students this year have
no real idea of what happened last year. Juniors
who would carry over for a second year would be
able to formulate an idea of which direction the
committee should go and could help aim it in
I hat direction.

First, we must remember that the committee
serves as an ADVISORY group to President Ster
ling. It is up lo President Sterling, therefore, to
decide whether the advice he receives from the
committee is valuable enough to warrant the con
tinuance of the committee. Although the commit
tee was formed after students requested it, its pi i
mary concern is, as it now stands, communication
of student ideas 'I () the administration and fac
ulty, and then lo tell the students what administra
tive policy is.
At the last meeting President Sterling indicated
that the group does help him keep in touch with
the currents of student thought. Ilence, until we
hear otherwise from him, we shall assume that he
desires the continuance ol the committee.
Therefore, as Bohn pointed out, we must find
means of making the advice ol the committee even
more substantial and more representative.
Bohn would have the students on the committee
all be members of Legislature. I disagree. This
would not solve one of the problems which I see
lo be a major hindrance to the functioning of the
committee. As Bohn says, committee members are
mostly student leaders Bohn, ASSIJ Vice Presi
dent Clee I looser, 111! President Arden Schenker,
etc. who are in touch with various segments of
the student body, hut they are also deeply involved
in their activities, so much so that they can spend
little time working on committee problems.
Many of the questions which come before the
committee deserve extra study. It is a burden to
the students leading the different activities to
spend the time to prepare adequately for the meet
ings; hence, in most cases, they do not. Oranted
that the administration and faculty representa

tives tm the committee also lead busy lives, hut
ihoy are heller 1 versed on iho problems and gener
ally have to do less preparation.
This leads us to the first recommendation: that
the members of the committee be selected with an
eye to interest, rather than because they represent
areas of the student body. I suggest that this be
done in two ways: <11 applications be made to the
President's Office or to whomever the President
might choose, perhaps a subcommittee of the coin
mil Ice itself; and <2> that the present members of
the committee recommend students they know are
interested and could make a contribution.
However, I agree that a closer tie with the
elected representatives is desirable. This brings
me to my second proposal: thai the students on
the President's Committee form an executive com
miPee of the Legislature, under the chairmanship
of a Legislature member, and act as an advisory
group to the Legislature as well as to President
Sterling.
Although the average Legislature member is
becoming more concerned with academic affairs,
I contend he is still activity conscious. A group of
students who are deeply interested in the problems
raised before the President's Committee honors
programs, for instance balanced by a tie with the
Legislature so thai lliey do not ignore the other
aspects of student life, could be helpful to both
groups.
The third proposal is Iha I of the !. r > or so student
members of the committee, three to live be juniors,
to be on the committee two years. At present em
phasis is on seclcling seniors for the committee.
At the last meeting President Sterling pointed
out that the older members were concerned with
long-range programs; students who are here four
or so years have difficulty grasping these long
range ideas. 1 suggest that those who are on the
committee their junior and senior years would be
more appreciative of these ideas, hut would still
be conscious, if fulfilling their responsibility, of
current thought.
Ai the moment the committee sometimes acts
as an echo chamber for its own ideas, but we umsl
remember that this is only the second year for the
committee and that the students this year have
no real idea of what happened last year. Juniors
who would carry over for a second year would be
able to formulate an idea of which direction the
committee should go and could help aim it in
I hat direction.
ASSU President John Bohn has pointed lo an
area of activity which deserves attention Presi

more and more student concern directed a 1 aca

desires the continuance ol the committee.
Therefore, as Bohn pointed out, we must find
means of making the advice ol the committee even
more substantial and more representative.
Bohn would have the students on the committee
all be members of Legislature. I disagree. This
would not solve one of the problems which I see
lo be a major hindrance to the functioning of the
committee. As Bohn says, committee members are
mostly student leaders Bohn, ASSIJ Vice Presi
dent Clee I looser, 111! President Arden Schenker,
etc. who are in touch with various segments of
the student body, hut they are also deeply involved
in their activities, so much so that they can spend
little time working on committee problems.
Many of the questions which come before the
committee deserve extra study. It is a burden to
the students leading the different activities to
spend the time to prepare adequately for the meet
ings; hence, in most cases, they do not. Oranted
that the administration and faculty representa

tives tm the committee also lead busy lives, hut
ihoy are heller 1 versed on iho problems and gener
ally have to do less preparation.
This leads us to the first recommendation: that
the members of the committee be selected with an
eye to interest, rather than because they represent
areas of the student body. I suggest that this be
done in two ways: <11 applications be made to the
President's Office or to whomever the President
might choose, perhaps a subcommittee of the coin
mil Ice itself; and <2> that the present members of
the committee recommend students they know are
interested and could make a contribution.
However, I agree that a closer tie with the
elected representatives is desirable. This brings
me to my second proposal: thai the students on
the President's Committee form an executive com
miPee of the Legislature, under the chairmanship
of a Legislature member, and act as an advisory
group to the Legislature as well as to President
Sterling.
Although the average Legislature member is
becoming more concerned with academic affairs,
I contend he is still activity conscious. A group of
students who are deeply interested in the problems
raised before the President's Committee honors
programs, for instance balanced by a tie with the
Legislature so thai lliey do not ignore the other
aspects of student life, could be helpful to both
groups.
The third proposal is Iha I of the !. r > or so student
members of the committee, three to live be juniors,
to be on the committee two years. At present em
phasis is on seclcling seniors for the committee.
At the last meeting President Sterling pointed
out that the older members were concerned with
long-range programs; students who are here four
or so years have difficulty grasping these long
range ideas. 1 suggest that those who are on the
committee their junior and senior years would be
more appreciative of these ideas, hut would still
be conscious, if fulfilling their responsibility, of
current thought.
Ai the moment the committee sometimes acts
as an echo chamber for its own ideas, but we umsl
remember that this is only the second year for the
committee and that the students this year have
no real idea of what happened last year. Juniors
who would carry over for a second year would be
able to formulate an idea of which direction the
committee should go and could help aim it in
I hat direction.
ASSU President John Bohn has pointed lo an
area of activity which deserves attention Presi
dent Sterling's Student Advisory Commit lee. With
more and more student concern directed a 1 aca
demics outside the individual's classroom work
the question of liaison with the administrative of
liters and faculty becomes more important.
Bohn, as a member of the committee and the
head of the student government, proposed that
the students on the committee he those of the Leg
islature's Academic Affairs Committee.
As another member of the committee, I would
like to propose an alternative which, I think, would
more effectively accomplish the goals Bohn pro
poses and which I agree are to be sought.
First, we must remember that the committee
serves as an ADVISORY group to President Ster
ling. It is up lo President Sterling, therefore, to
decide whether the advice he receives from the
committee is valuable enough to warrant the con
tinuance of the committee. Although the commit
tee was formed after students requested it, its pi i
mary concern is, as it now stands, communication
of student ideas 'I () the administration and fac
ulty, and then lo tell the students what administra
tive policy is.
At the last meeting President Sterling indicated
that the group does help him keep in touch with
the currents of student thought. Ilence, until we
hear otherwise from him, we shall assume that he
desires the continuance ol the committee.
