# THE

### Dick Barnes 
A Swileli in Competition Level
The dual meet routine of the track season takes a week end off!
before Big Meet, and in the interval Stanford expects to establish!
it-self as among the nation's best distance medley relay teams.
I'uylon Jordan is taking a six-man delegation to the Drake Relays!
in I>es Moines, lowa, on Friday and Saturday, but it's the four men'
on the relay team who are drawing most of the attention.
The medley relay 440, 880, 1320 and mile is an event seen only
in the relay meets. Hut it has developed into a popular favorite
with fans, particularly alter the West Coast Relays medley race in
1 957.
A lime projection based on seasonal marks indicates that the
Stanford quartet of Don ( hesarek, Dick Lassen, Kcrtil Liiimlli and
Lrnie ( oolitic should run in the low to middle 9:so's.
('hesarek and Lassen are obvious choices for the 440 and 880 legs,
and ihey can do the job. ( hesarek, the only one of the four who has
to go from a standing start, can be counted on for at least a 48.5
lead-off lap unless it's raining at Drake, which il often does.
Lassen has liil 1 :53 and 1:53.1 in his last two starts. This makes
a 1:53 estimate for him a conservative one, since the running start
•: hould knock off several tenths.
Deciding where to put Cnnliffe and Lnndli posed more of a prob-1
Iftn for 'lonian, hut the running style of ilk> two finally decided the
issue, Cnnliffe can easily set a pace for himself, but Lnnilh prefers}
to follow ;i pace. Though both run nearly identical miles, Cnnliffe
has the stronger finish of the two.
Hence it will be Liiimlli running the 1320 earlier in the medley,
when competition is apt to be closer and Cnnliffe on the mile, with {
his finish available al the end of the medley.
Based on his limes Ibis year, Cnnliffe should have no trouble hil
ling 1:12 for anchor stint. Lrnie says he could have hit 1:09 in al 1
le;isl one of those races had he not been saving for the X.XO, indicating j
that something in the 1:10 neighborhood isn't an impossibility for
Sal unlay.
Jordan says Liiimlli should be able Io go the Ihree-quarters in three
minutes flat. This might sound optimistic for a 1:11.7 miler, but
then consider his race Saturday against USC and Oregon. In that
one, Lnmlli ran his final three laps in about 3:06 and thai was on
top of a lead-off 66-seeond quarter.
(living Cnnliffe the 4:12 and Ltindh his 3:00, il adds up to a 9:53.5
for the Indians. Consider that the best collegiate medley time in the
nation last year was 9:50.8 by Oklahoma, and it's obvious that thci
Stanford quartet is a good one.
The Cards will bo far from running by themselves Saturday.
Oklahoma will be back again with (iail Hodgson, their outstanding
miler from South Africa, who last year ran 4:04.5.
I'robablv out of reach of the field, al least at this stage of the year,
is the all-time collegiate best of 9:42.3, run by California in the 1957
West Coast Belays showdown.
In that race, three teams bettered Ihe then American record of
9:50.1, the Southern California stridors finally winning in 9:42, thanks
to ;i 4:00.8 anchor mile by Jerome Walters. California's splits on that
race were 48.3, 1:52.9, 2:59.6 and 4:01.5 an indication of what Stan- !
lord would need to near the collegiate record.
More Three-Ways, A.M/s on Way
Turning from next Saturday to last, indications are thai Stanford '
will have more triangular and morning meets in the future. Fans
apparently like the idea of morning competition and were really en
ihusiastic about adding a third team to the field.
Jordan is currently working on plans to bring Washington south
foi a three-way meet next spring, probably with UCLA as ihe third
team or perhaps San Jose State. And plans are also in the mill for
Stanford and California to go north to Oregon for a meet next year.
The morning idea will get another test June 6, when the Pacific
Association AAU Championships are staged in Stanford Stadium.
Wiih all collegiate and open-class athletes from the Greater Bay Area
eligible to compete, Ihe meet should produce excellent marks.
Nothing was odder about Saturday's meet than the way Otis Davis
started. When the Oregon flash ran from a standing instead of blocks
start in the quarter, there were a few raised eyebrows. But when he
siood up to start in the 220, the fans and the experts were amazed.
Funny thing he got a pretty good start in the 220.
