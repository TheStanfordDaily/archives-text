## Three Diamond Crucials On Weekend Schedule 
### 
II is beginning to look like one "crucial" right aflcr another for
Stanford's baseball team this season and this weekend brings Ihc
most croo-shul yet a single game tomorrow willi Santa Clara and
a big Saturday doubleheader with Southern California at the Sunken
' Diamond.
Already Coach Dutch Feb ring's Tribe is playing on what some

critics might call borrowed time.
Right now the Tribe stands in
the league's second place with
five wins and two losses. Four of
the wins have been over last-place
UCLA, and the other over a then
red-hot Santa Clara nine.
Stanford Likely in NCAA
Stanford's main objective now
is California. With USC ineli
gible for NCAA play, Cal and
Stanford look to be the most like
ly candidates to represent the
Pacific Coast Conference's South
ern Division in the first round of
playoffs that eventually lead to
the nationals.
Saturday's tests may tell the
story of the Card chances. Last
season, Stanford lost, 10-5, 13-4,
19-13 and 9-2 to a Trojan team
that was on its way to the NCAA
championship.
The teams have met once this
season â€” in the spring vacation
San Diego Marine Tournament.
In that one, the Tribe pulled a
6-3 upset over Troy. This can
hardly be called a definite indica
tion of a Stanford victory this

lime, but al least much of the
psychological barrier toward the
"invincible Trojans" may have
been overcome.
Seven Trojans were in the CT
\
BA's leading hitters last season
and four catcher Bill Heath,
shortstop Fred Scott, outfielder
John Werhas and first baseman
captain Ken Guffey are back this
time.
New Stars
In addition, Coach Ron De
deaux has come up with two fine
stars in outfielder Len Gabrielson
and second baseman Don Buford,
both among the league's top slug
gers this year.
For pitching, Dedeaux has
righthander Bill Thorn, the Most
Valuable Player In last year's NC
AA tournament, and southpaw
Bruce Gardner, 5-1 last season.
