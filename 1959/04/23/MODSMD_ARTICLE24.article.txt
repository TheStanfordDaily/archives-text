# Card Netmen Seek Upset in Ojai Tourney
## 
### John Schwarz 
With Ihe opening of the Ojai
tennis tournament today Stan
ford's tennis team will get its sec
ond opportunity to challenge UC
LA for PCC tennis supremacy.
The Ojai event, which has sep
arate tourneys for almost all di
visions imaginable, includes a 24-
man draw from the PCC schools.
Each member of the southern di
vision of the PCC has entered a
six-man team.
Stanford's l.in<Mip
Stanford's aggregation will be
looking to revenge an H-I dump
ing received at the hands of UC
LA in a dual match two weeks
ago. U is made up of Dave Nel
son. Dick Ogden, Lowell Carruth,
Brooks Rawlins, .Jim Jeffries and
Dick Gould.
UCLA has captured the tourna
ment crown the last three years
and with such top men as Roger
Werksman, Allen Fox and Norm
Perry, the Bruins will be favor
ites to make ii four limes in a
row.
Stanford will be Ihe only school
rated any chance of stopping the
Bruins' bid for this year's title.
There is a strong possibility that
neither Southern California nor
California will be able to gain
more than two points, Ihe mini
mum, in the tourney.
I'erry Favored
Norm Perry, who whipped
Stanford's ace netler Dave Nel
son in straight sets two weeks
will be the top seed in this
year's draw. The singles play
should produce a battle between
Perry, Nelson and Perry's two
teammates, Fox and Werksman.
Greg Grant of USC is given an
outside chance to break into win
ners' circle as is Stanford's Dick
Ogden.
