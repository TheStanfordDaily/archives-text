The Stanford School of Edu
cation has begun a search for
high school teacher interns under
a recently received $900,000 Ford
Foundation grant. The program,
which begins its first 15-month

two summer quarters of academ
ic work at Stanford and an aca
demic year of actual paid teach
ing at public high schools nearby.
Recruits are wanted from stu
dents at Stanford and other col
leges and universities who are
about to receive their bachelor's
degrees, but had not considered
teaching as a career, and from
older college graduates who hold
a degree in subjects taught in
high school and who might like
lo turn to teaching.
Trainees during the coming
summer will take a full-time Uni
versity course in addition to ob
serving and assisting profession
al high school teachers in action.
I luring the regular school year,
they will be paid from $2500 lo
$3001) by the school districts as
intern teachers, meanwhile keep
ing up with university work in
a weekly professional seminar.
