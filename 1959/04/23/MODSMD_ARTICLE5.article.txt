# MANDEL:
## 'Russ Have Much Free Comment' 
### Julie Hirsch 
Practical after-aspects of top
level decisions in Russia are dis
cussed with remarkable freedom,
author and authority on Russia
William Mandel told a group in a
question and answer period at
Bowman House yesterday.
Mandel gave as an example (he
turnover of the machine-tractor
stations to the collective farms.
The decision came from Iho top,
but the practical problems of who
was If) pay, how much, and for
which equipment wore decided
among a great variety of the pop
ulace.
Much the same thing was ap
parent in a pre school meeting of
teachers, Communist Party offi
cials and government representa
tives on education. All spoke free
ly with little regard for the differ
ence in their stations.
Freer Speech
Mandel, a KPFA commentator,
also pointed out that few or no
political arrests have been made
in the last few years. The Rus
sian people speak more freely
than 15 years ago, "but memory
of what happened in the past un
doubtedly keeps them from being
as free as they might."
Letters to the editor remain
the most popular mode of expres
sion. The letters are printed with
no consideration of length or
space—"the editors reserve the
right to edit and cut the material,
but the articles are judged on
their merit."
"When a criticism of Khru
shchev's new seven-year plan can
appear in Russia's version of the
Saturday Evening Review, we
must say that a change has cer
tainly come about."
Peace Wanted
The support of Russia's foreign
policy is perhaps greater than
any other aspect of the Soviet
government. The people want
peace above all else. For some
reason, "foreign policy is never
discussed at all in the press."
Commenting on the assimila
tion of nationalities in .Russia,
Mandel felt that a great attempt
had been made to equalize the
status of each- economically and
politically. The highest paid of
Russian farmers arc the cotton
farmers whose position is very
similar to the JN'egro in America.
And on the Russian Central Com
mittee, a definite attempt has
been made to represent all nation
alities.
In closing the question and an
swer period, Mandel emphasized
considering and understanding
the historical concept of Russia
as an answer to our misunder
standings.
"We have coexisted for a con
siderable time, and since I see no
suicidal tendencies in the leaders
of either the U.S.A. or Russia, I
think we will continue to coexist
for many years to come."

"When a criticism of Khru
shchev's new seven-year plan can
appear in Russia's version of the
Saturday Evening Review, we
must say that a change has cer

Peace Wanted
The support of Russia's foreign
policy is perhaps greater than
any other aspect of the Soviet
government. The people want
peace above all else. For some
reason, "foreign policy is never
discussed at all in the press."
Commenting on the assimila
tion of nationalities in .Russia,
Mandel felt that a great attempt
had been made to equalize the
status of each- economically and
politically. The highest paid of
Russian farmers arc the cotton
farmers whose position is very
similar to the JN'egro in America.
And on the Russian Central Com
mittee, a definite attempt has
been made to represent all nation
alities.
In closing the question and an
swer period, Mandel emphasized
considering and understanding
the historical concept of Russia
as an answer to our misunder
standings.
"We have coexisted for a con
siderable time, and since I see no
suicidal tendencies in the leaders
of either the U.S.A. or Russia, I
think we will continue to coexist
for many years to come."
Practical after-aspects of top
level decisions in Russia are dis
cussed with remarkable freedom,
author and authority on Russia
William Mandel told a group in a
question and answer period at
Bowman House yesterday.
Mandel gave as an example (he
turnover of the machine-tractor
stations to the collective farms.
The decision came from Iho top,
but the practical problems of who
was If) pay, how much, and for
which equipment wore decided
among a great variety of the pop
ulace.
Much the same thing was ap
parent in a pre school meeting of
teachers, Communist Party offi
cials and government representa
tives on education. All spoke free
ly with little regard for the differ
ence in their stations.
Freer Speech
Mandel, a KPFA commentator,
also pointed out that few or no
political arrests have been made
in the last few years. The Rus
sian people speak more freely
than 15 years ago, "but memory
of what happened in the past un
doubtedly keeps them from being
as free as they might."
Letters to the editor remain
the most popular mode of expres
sion. The letters are printed with
no consideration of length or
space—"the editors reserve the
right to edit and cut the material,
but the articles are judged on
their merit."
