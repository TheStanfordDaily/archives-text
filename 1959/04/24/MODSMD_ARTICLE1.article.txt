and Stern offices because of the
closeness of the vole. A Legisla
ture committee was delegated to
assist on the recount and to make
the decision as lo the candidates
for Ihe final elections.
Bill Karto/.ian, who was a
write-in candidate for several of
fices, was immediately disquali
fieri from WRA positions because
he was not a member, lie told
The Daily after the meeting that
he had receiver! a bouquet of red
roses from WRA with a note indi
eating a desire to have him in the
offices.
Karto/.ian requested that the
Legislature indicate whether they
would permit him to run for more
than one office, when it appeared
that Ik? was among the top two
candidates for head yell leader
and for Men's Council.
John Bohn, ASSU president, af
ter receiving assurance from Kar
lozian I hat he would perform the
duties of office seriously, broke
a 5-5 tie to permit the double en
try. There were seven abstcn-
I ions.
The Legislature had recessed
for 50 minutes waiting for the
election returns. .Richards said
that every office had a number of
write-in candidates which slowed
the counting considerably.

the request of Vice President Clee
Honscr. SJie asked for more lime
lo discuss Ihe change and lo re
view Ihe present requirements
for social aetivitnes.
I'y a vole of 1(5 for - , one against
and one abstaining, Legislature
approved a constitutional change
for the election of head yell leafi
er. The change, which will be
presented to the student body and
must be approved by two-thirds
! of the students, reads as follows:
"The Head Clieftr Leader
shall he elected at the regular
Autumn Quarter election by
the Association at large. He
shall take office at the begin
ning of Winter Quarter and
hold office until the beginning
of the following Winter Quar
ter. This Amendment shall be
j come effective Autumn Quar
ter 1959.'"
Hostels Committee of Cardinals
became a board of the ASSU in
other action taken by the Legis
; lature. The first proposal was to
make Hostels a commission, but
I Larry Kellcy, financial manager,
suggested giving Hostels the sta
tus of a board, thus giving it a
place on the Cabinet.
Hostels was separated from
Cardinals because, Kelley pointed
out, it has outgrown the parent
organization.
A constitution for the Stanford
Company, Association of the
United States Army, to replace
the Scabbard and Blade honorary
society was sent to By-laws.
An appropriation of '$131.7(5
was approved to purchase more
late leaves, Kelley reported.
While waiting for the election
results, Legislature heard from
John Nickerson, Toyon-ICC rep
resentative, that proposals on the
rushing procedure will be ready
next week.
Kelley noted that sessions on
the budget will begin next week.
Thorough review of the budget
will take two weeks.
