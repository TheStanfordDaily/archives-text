# Graduate Program Needs Reappraisal

'I in-; FRi-si<nt Stanford student generation has seen impressive
growth, \v illl vigor and imagiualinn, in its undergraduate educa
tion. 11 is not all we'd like we hope, lor wliat it indicates ol
umlergraduati V values, that tlieir educational opportunities and
llie use to which tliey put them will never he all they'd like—hut
we see much to appreciate.

Staiiford s graduate student community is not tlic most
dynamic conceivable. Ii leaves much to be desired; il
ei en leaies ninth to he expected, justly, of ii university
of Stanford's potential.
I he situation varies in dillerent departments and schools. And
there a re, happily, outstanding individuals in even those depart
ments and schools ol less vitality whose graduate programs would
he a credit to any institution. Nevertheless, we feel there is enough
accuracy in our generalization to make its statement worthwhile.
For example, graduate student organizations in the several
fields, which bring their members together socially and to share
topics in their specialties, are iu main cases not the vehicles ol
stimulating association they might he.
Money available for graduate assistantships ami /<•/-
lon ships 10 attract the nation's top candidates for ad
vanced degrees is far too unevenly distributeil among
schools and departments.
Some of the graduate schools 1 prestige ami, more important,
their actual offerings are at present, substantial. And the moving
of the medical school to campus, with a greatly expanded and
progressive program, w r ill initiate a nationally significant center
of medical and allied teaching ami research from which the entire
graduate community will benefit—in attitude and example as well
as in substance. e are already feeling the lirst effects of this in
such events as the basic steroids conference of last March.
In saying that an enormous challenge lies before Stanford's
graduate schools and departments, we do not mean to imply that
the Administration, the Office of the Dean of Graduate Students
and the faculty are unaware of the task and its problems. 'Ihey
have evidenced considerable awareness of many aspects of the
challenge.
I\or are we trying to suggest handy remedies for what is, in
fact, a complex and encompassing problem.
tf'e are trying simply to point out to undergraduates
the EXISTENCE of i ast unrealized potentialities in Stan
ford's graduate education. Most Stan foul undergraduates
don't tliinh too much about their University's graduate
programs. Such things don't, as a rule, Immediately con•
cern them.
Perhaps they could profitably become more concerned. T heir
own student lives can benefit, socially and intellectually, propor
tionately to the degree to which this University, with its under
graduates" support, accepts the challenge, of its graduate future.
