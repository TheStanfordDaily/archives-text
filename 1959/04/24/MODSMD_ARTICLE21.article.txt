Editor, I'll* 1 l>uily:
I cannot say that 1 share Iho
same feeling of distress and guilt
that our editor does in recogniz
ing the "conspicuous lack of Ne
gro students" here at Stanford.
The plea of Ihe editorial
seemed to be that Stanford stands
the chance of being branded anli
Negro, unless the s t ude nt s
change their attitudes. It is in
ferred that by adding more Ne
groes to our student population,
something will he better. Just
what the something is, is nut
stated.
Never in history has one race
tried with such intensity of effort
to rise above their lot. Through
much publicity, even as our edi
tor's column, the NAAt'p has sue
ceeded in creating a connotation
of sa< redness in their cause, and
that anyone standing in theii
path is wrong by definition. . . .
In short, as I lie issue is stated
by our editor, there is tint one
course of action enroll more Ne
groes, I lie more the better tÂ«>
prove to the world that we at
Stanford are fair, just and right.
However, a more rational a|>
proach to this question would re
veal that there is not such a proh
lem at Stanford.

II is simply that an accusation
of a social and moral nature has
been made alleging thai certain
attitudes and actions (it the stu
dents are wrong. In order to an
swer the charge, it we must at
all, we must necessarily act as the
accuse)' directs in order to prove
that we do not. possess these
wrong attitudes and actions. . . .
I am for the Negro in that he
wants to rise but 1 will not be
cowed into an attitude of fear

and submission so thai he may
more easily obtain his end. . . .
May I he the first to shake (lie
hand ol the victor who has fought
clean and hard. But it is folly io
bestow the same laurels on one
who would ask that his path be
made more easy.
