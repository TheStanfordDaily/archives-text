llosul Unique
hlilor, The Daily:
In reply to Cully Tanner's ar
tide in The Daily Monday con
cerning the Red China Russia
Hostel willi Buss and Mazour, ii
is I rue lliai as a group we did not
limit our conversation to the pre
scribed topic.
At first I shared Tally's disap
pointment, hut then I began to
wonder upon what criteria a hos
tel should he evaluated. Although
a little more organization might
have insured a certain amount of
discussion on the topic, too much
planning, I fear, might have dis
couraged the wonderful sponta
neity and freedom of expression I
believe we all felt.
Drs. Buss and Mazour shared
with us their fascinating personal
adventures in the Philippines din
ing the occupation and in Russia
• hiring the Revolution, respective
ly. We were confronted with his
tory made real by the people who
lived it, an approach thai books

and even the most interesting lec
tures cannot fully duplicate.
The hostels can serve as the
much-needed link between Stan
ford students and their profes
sors. This casual, friendly rela
tionship is what makes the hos
tels unique, and it they succeed
in no other way, they are very
important, informative and en
joyable.
