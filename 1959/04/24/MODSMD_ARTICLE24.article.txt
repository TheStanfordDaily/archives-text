deman on the hill lor I lie Cards
and Karl Russell and Marv Meek
lenberg will throw for the Tribe
in tomorrow's double header
against I lie powerful USC Tro
jans.
Although Ihe Trojans aren't
l he same powerful team of a few
years back, first baseman Ken
Guffey, the Trojan captain, short
slop l-Ted Scott, outfielder John
VVerhas and catcher Mill Heath,
another man from Troy sought
alter by the major leagues, were
leading CI MA hitters last year
and are back hilling again this

Although the Santa Clara Bron
cos aren't perhaps the same lough
opponents as league play got un

ting attack. Shortstop Mob Chin
