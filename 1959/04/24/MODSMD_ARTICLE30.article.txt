# Stanford Netters Find Going Tough at Ojai
## 
### 
O.JAI. Calif. Dick Gould pro
vided the only Card net thrills in
the Ojai tourney yesterday, as
he pressed UCLA's No. 1 seeded
Norm Perry to three sets before
losing.
Gould broke the Tallin star's
service three times in the final
set hut faulty net play cost him
the match.
In the other Card first round
net match Lowell Carnith lost to
Terry's powerful Bruin team
mate, Roger Werksman, 0-1, 0-1.
The Cards' play, under Ojai's
sunny skies, was probably at its
lowest all season as only one In
dian survived the second-round
singles matches. Brooks Rawlins
jumped off to an early one-set
lead, faltered, but came back
sti'ong to whip USC's Martin
Schiller.
However, Stanford's two meet
favorites, Dave Nelson and Dick
Ogden, just didn't have it yester
day. Nelson extended Bruin Dale
Rohland to three sets but was de
feated in second-round play.

Stanford's number two man.
Dick Ogden, met similar fate as
he was UCLA's Worksman's sec
ond Card victim of the afternoon.
Ogden lost in straight sets to the
Bruin who now should be rated
as the tourney favorite.
The Card netters fared slightly
better in the doubles as Nelson
and Ogden came back strong to
advance into the semi finals with
a win over llohland and Works
man of IK'LA.
