## Iran Consul Explains UN Small Nation Policy 
### 
Dr. Majid Rahnema's talk yes
terday on "Iranian Policy Toward
Dependent. Countries at the UN"
well explained small nation poli
cies in regard to larger territory
holding world powers.
The UN committee primarily

concerned with handling the prob
lems of the "dependent" or trus
teeship countries and their sov
ereigns is a unit generally re
ferred to as the Fourth Commit
tee, or sometimes called "anti-co
lonial committee." Many other
small nations are not considered
legally dependents, as their supe
rior powers assume them to be
only a part of their entire nation.
The basic purpose of the com
mittec is to assert the "right of
self-determination" for some of
these dependent countries, work
ing out developmental programs
and independence timetables with
their ruling nations.
Colonialism has been rejected
by the men that really run the
UN, the men of the smaller na
tions. According to Rahnema,
this right of self-determination
will gradually assert itself. Rot
these 11 e w I y a rising nations
should be met on foundations of
equality and mutual respect for
the programs to succeed.
The trusteeships are working
out. smoothly, as in many in
stances the countries are being
granted their independence years
before the assigned release sched
ules.
