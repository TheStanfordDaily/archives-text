### 
"I'oPI.ARVii.LK, Miss. Hooded night raiders draped a screaming
Negro charged with raping a wliile woman from his jail eell Sat
urday. Mom officials believe the victim is already dead."
This tragedy, like all tin' other Negro lynchings and
racial i lino s in the Southern past, h ares one speechless
n iih anger and disgust.
l>isgust because such men e\ist and are c alled civili/ed, because
such bigoted and repulsive men are viewed as American, and dis
gusted most ol all because a Southern society views such mailers
lightly.
I his is made apparent hy Mississippi's Governor < loleman wilh
his eonimenl that he hopes they "won't he punished by civil rights
legislation" because of the incident.
We only blink at segregated schools; become only slightly in
dignant when schools are bombed or c losed, when blood is labeled
by race, and when Negroes are denied the right to vote. All are
blessed in terms of states' rights and "compromise politics."
How do we respond when such personal acts of violence are
< ommitted ? \\ hat is your reaction, Senator Johnson— who barred
elimination of the filibuster a* you read this news item? And
your reaction, Senator (Jiureh who compromised human rights
for Hell's (ianyon Dam? What do you say, Democratic presiden
tial aspirants or might your thoughts alienate a Southern bloc
of votes?
Are ire content to chalk lip another Negro victim of
Southern prejudice and hate in I. A. Hai/ey's "American
Pageant" and note confidently that the number of Negro
lynchings is decliningY
And what's your reaction, Stanford students? Is this just an
other news story —and one that has no place.in a college paper,
at that? Is academia that far away from human reality?
Perhaps we're just too busy—"learning more and more about
less and less," as (!. Wright Mills might put it.
We hope this incident will be enough to jar our Congress into
passing some real civil rights legislation. If it is not, then there
is probably nothing that will.
