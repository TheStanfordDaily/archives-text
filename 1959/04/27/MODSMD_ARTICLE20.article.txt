# This Point of View
## Radical Opinion to be Expressed 
### Michael Freeman 
For some time now people have
bemoaned the depth of the politi
cal apathy which afflicts the Stan
ford campus. For some time now
people have regretted the lack of
articulate, organized radical opin
ion in the United States. For a
long time now few people have
done anything but moan and re
gret.
Stanford is now being offered
an opportunity—an opportunity to
show that it CAN think; that it
can think and articulately express
its thought; that it is NOT, con
trary to a widely held belief,
afraid of opinions that are "dan
gerously radical" or "a bit too lib
eral for me."
Experiment
The campus is about to witness
an experiment; one whose failure
will be Stanford's shame. The ex
periment is called Stanford Left,
and hopes to provide a forum for
that vast area of opinion which at
present has no organized repre
sentation at Stanford.
Stanford Left has no platform;
ii has no views ot its own; it has
no political motives; it advocates
the overthrow of nothing but prej
udice and ignorance.
Forum
It is a forum where no view is
excluded however unpopular,
however unconventional it sin
eerely held and intelligently ar
gued. Stanford Left seeks to con
vert no one (although those who
participate in its discussions may
do sot; it seeks to convince no one
ot any particular theory.
It is the aim of this experiment
to educate and to enlighten, to pro
vide an outlet for opinions which
may provoke anger, hostility and

controversy; for without such
provocation thought necessarily
stagnates.
This experiment has been
launched hopefully in the firm be
lief that "the best of truth is the
power of the thought to get it sell
accepted in the competition of the
market."
Principles
Stanford Left will commit itself
to the following declaration of
principles:
"Believing that freedom of
speech is sell-evidently the invio
lable right of a free man in a free
society;
"Believing that freedom of
speech means little if it does not
mean freedom to express views
unwelcome, distasteful or repug
nant to the conventional opinions
of the majority;
"Believing also that a radical
and articulate dissent is essential
to the continuing vitality of any
society;
"STANFORD LEFT has been
formed with the following objec
tives:
"• To serve as a forum in which
there may be a free exchange of
ideas and beliefs; where Left can
meet Right, where Action can
I meet Reaction; so that none shall
remain content to bask in his own
ignorance.
"• To organize debates, semi
nars, panels and other meetings,
and by any o th e r appropriate
means, to provide a channel for
vigorous, well-informed and unin
hibited discussion of all matters of
contemporary concern.
"• To encourage all who would
speak; to provoke all who would
think; to enlighten all whom il
should concern."
