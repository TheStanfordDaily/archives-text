# 'Major Barbara' Generally Poor
## 
### Jerome Clinton 
One of Die most difficult of
Shaw's plays to produce, the
Stanford Players' production of
Major Barbara opened its three
day run Thursday evening.
It is more than usually ham
pered by inadequate characteriza
tion, insubstantial plot, and
Shaw's general proclivity for lec
turing his audience, in several
voices, on the evils of the existing
social order and of mankind in
general. And often it lacks the
saving grace of his ironic humor.
It demands experienced actors
who can speak engagingly, with
conviction and at considerable
length. Despite all these difficul
ties, however, any university
company should be able to give it
at least a clean reading.
Under Sen,sen bach's generally
colorless arid ill timed direction,
characters were misconceived,
good lines were slurred over, the
plot became almost opaque and
the whole performance degener
ated into a tedious harangue.
The all - important part of Ma
jor Barbara demands a forthright
and vigorous young woman who

can, in the absence of good lines,
take full command of the audi
ence's attention by the sheer vi
tality of her presence.
Miss Pence, a gentle creature,
was unfortunately cast in this
role and had neither the voice nor
maturity to play it. The other
principals, Henry Peyroux as
Adolphus Cusiris and Jack Gia
nino as Undershaft, performed
with some conviction, but seemed
thwarted by the absence of a com
petent Barbara, and exhausted by
the physical exertion of shouting

so many lines into the ravelike
acoustics of Memorial Audito
rium.
Doris Viola, as Lady Britomart,
gave u good and consistent Amer
ican parody of English nobility,
which was out of keeping with
the play and in marked contrast
to the deportment of her correct-
Ily British son, well played by
! Doug Johnson.
The only wholly satisfactory
performance was given by Tom
Bissinger as the genially witless
Charley Lomax.
