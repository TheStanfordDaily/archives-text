Appeal to [ moi ion
ICditor, The Daily:
The letter of Messrs. Long and
Smith in Thursday's Daily is, and
must he regarded as, an ingen
ious appeal to emotion on a sub
ject that demands clear thinking.
We must not allow our zeal for
freedom of speech to blind us to
the fact that what freedom de
mands is a completely tolerant
attitude regarding the continuing
and undiminished debating situa
lion in our universities.
In particular the important
thing to note is that it is just
such people as Kendall who still
continue to instill Tory prejudice
and metaphysical superstition in
the minds of our future leaders
of society.
It must always be remembered
that the lingering anachronistic
traces of such outmoded dogma
tism are just the things that
stand in the way of the speedier
unfolding of that continuing
progress of humanity which is so
vital to us all.
In the light of these eonsidera
lions I urge that the Political Sei
eriee Department not allow itself
to be blinded by delusive consider
ations of toleration; and, rather,
resolutely refuse even to consider
the admission of so dangerous a
man as Kendall to its ranks.
And if Voltaire does not. like it,
he can lump it,

Wish to Protest
I'alitnr, The Daily:
We wish to protest the article
in Monday's Daily on the "Rus
sia and Red China" hostel by
clarifying some of the statements
presented in the article.
That hostels need "more plan
ning" is hardly a valid statement
as the purpose of a hostel is in
formal discussion in which the
students, as well as the profes
sors, participate. No such infor
mality can he achieved when u

liscusslon is planned by the lat
ter.
If an organized point by-point
presentation is desired, a student
may easily find such in classes
ju campus and should baldly
spend his time on a hostel. If,
however, one wishes to avail him
self of an opportunity to ask
questions of experienced men in
in atmosphere conducive to open
discussion, he may find it here.
Chanted that the listed subject
was not thoroughly covered on
the hostel in question, related
matters were discussed in a man
ner most thought • provoking to
me who can realize the relation
ship between past and present ac
tions of Russia and Red China.
The entire subject could hardly
be covered in a quarter, much less
in a day. A hostel is simply a
time for individual participation
in delving into a few thought
provoking aspects of the matter.
As to Ihe time and money
spent, $3 is quite a nominal
charge for lodging and three ex
eel lent meals. The time spent was
far too inadequate.
Finally we would like lo thank
Dr. Buss and Dr. Ma/our for
making the hostel a profitable
and en joyable experience, one not
found in the ordinary routine of
campus classes.
