# Stanford Falls to Troy; Russell Blanks Broncs
## 
### Dave Dow 
Not the IJSC team that won the
: 1958 NCAA championships but
| it was a very good facsimile that
handed Dutch Fehring's Indians
a double dose of "seven - run"
losses on Sunken Diamond Satur
day.
The Trojans were not missing
center fielder .Ron Fairly or sec
ond sacker Mike Castanon (hath
departed to the pro ranks) as
they got a seven hit shutout from
lefthander Bruce Gardner and six
sharp hits from third baseman
John Wei has to post 7-0, 7-3 vic
tories over the Indians.
Stanford clung to second place
in CIBA standings, however, by
virtue of Earl Russell's .six-hit,
1-0 victory over Santa Clara Fri
day. And that, after all, is the im-

portant slot as far as the Indians
are concerned.
By winning second Stanford
can earn a berth to the NCAA
playoff competition this year
since the Trojans are ineligible.
Their overhead was adjudged too
high last fall.
But USC, in the meantime, con
tinued on its way to another Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Baseball
championship by feeding its un
beaten conference record (7-0
now> with three victories over
northern teams this weekend.
The Trojans also beat California
Friday 14-2.
Newkirk Singles
Until Joel Newkirk scored Art
von Wronski with a sixth-inning
single in the second game Satur
day, it looked like a double white
wash job for the Troyboys. Off
and onner Jim Barudoni was
having much the same success as
his predecessor with a breaking
fastball and a well-spaced curve.

The Indians kept right on hit
ting him in the seventh until they
had scored two more runs and
SC's Bob Blakeslee had relieved
Barudoni to put out the fire.
Rich DeFabio. starting his first
games since breaking his jaw
three weeks ago, led off the sev
enth with a walk. Another walk
to pinchhitter Jeff Bertleson and
a line-kissing single to left by
Jim Burk scored DeFabio. Min
utes later von Wronski's second
hit of the game scored Dave Car
ter, running for Bertleson.
String landed
Other than that the scoring was
all Southern California's. Their
first-inning tally in the first game
ended a 22 scoreless inning streak
by Stanford pitchers which had
been put together over a week's
play.
The Trojans waited until the
second inning to grab their com
manding lead. Starter John Gil
lis was relieved by Warren Nel
son after walking Len Gabrielson,
Ron Stillwell and Bill Heath to
start the inning.
In the second game, ihe Smog

jnns collected two runs in the
first and fifth (thai quick lead
againt and enjoyed another three
run inning in the seventh.
Itarudoni Singles
Barudoni singled to center, ex
scat back Don Bulord was safe
when pitcher Terry Lindeman
misplayed his hunt and Fred
Scott forced Barudoni at third
on an altempted sacrifice.
Then the dangerous Mr. VVer
has, who could do no wrong,
smashed Lirideman's second serv
ing to right center for a double
and his sixth hit in what should
have been a knock-down situation
for Stanford's pitcher.
A wild pitch and fielder's choice
later YVerhas was across the plate
with SC's final run.
Only One Needed
Stanford needed only an un
earned run in the fourth inning to
post Friday's 1-0 victory over
Santa Clara. Ben Robinson and
Newkirk singled. Winter bounced
to the mound and pitcher Frank
Sobrero threw the ball away at
third trying to get Robinson.
Other than that the ball game
was all Russell's, as the sopho
more righthander fanned four,
walked two and chalked up his
seventh victory of the year.
Friday's game:
Stanford 000 100 000—I 7 0

play.
The Trojans waited until the
second inning to grab their com
manding lead. Starter John Gil
lis was relieved by Warren Nel
son after walking Len Gabrielson,
Ron Stillwell and Bill Heath to
start the inning.
In the second game, ihe Smog

jnns collected two runs in the
first and fifth (thai quick lead
againt and enjoyed another three
run inning in the seventh.
Itarudoni Singles
Barudoni singled to center, ex
scat back Don Bulord was safe
when pitcher Terry Lindeman
misplayed his hunt and Fred
Scott forced Barudoni at third
on an altempted sacrifice.
Then the dangerous Mr. VVer
has, who could do no wrong,
smashed Lirideman's second serv
ing to right center for a double
and his sixth hit in what should
have been a knock-down situation
for Stanford's pitcher.
A wild pitch and fielder's choice
later YVerhas was across the plate
with SC's final run.
Only One Needed
Stanford needed only an un
earned run in the fourth inning to
post Friday's 1-0 victory over
Santa Clara. Ben Robinson and
Newkirk singled. Winter bounced
to the mound and pitcher Frank
Sobrero threw the ball away at
third trying to get Robinson.
Other than that the ball game
was all Russell's, as the sopho
more righthander fanned four,
walked two and chalked up his
seventh victory of the year.

Four for six against Trojans


EARL RUSSELL
Shuts out Santa Clara
Not the IJSC team that won the
: 1958 NCAA championships but
| it was a very good facsimile that
handed Dutch Fehring's Indians
a double dose of "seven - run"
losses on Sunken Diamond Satur
day.
The Trojans were not missing
center fielder .Ron Fairly or sec
ond sacker Mike Castanon (hath
departed to the pro ranks) as
they got a seven hit shutout from
lefthander Bruce Gardner and six
sharp hits from third baseman
John Wei has to post 7-0, 7-3 vic
tories over the Indians.
Stanford clung to second place
in CIBA standings, however, by
virtue of Earl Russell's .six-hit,
1-0 victory over Santa Clara Fri
day. And that, after all, is the im-

portant slot as far as the Indians
are concerned.
By winning second Stanford
can earn a berth to the NCAA
playoff competition this year
since the Trojans are ineligible.
Their overhead was adjudged too
high last fall.
But USC, in the meantime, con
tinued on its way to another Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Baseball
championship by feeding its un
beaten conference record (7-0
now> with three victories over
northern teams this weekend.
The Trojans also beat California
Friday 14-2.
Newkirk Singles
Until Joel Newkirk scored Art
von Wronski with a sixth-inning
single in the second game Satur
day, it looked like a double white
wash job for the Troyboys. Off
and onner Jim Barudoni was
having much the same success as
his predecessor with a breaking
fastball and a well-spaced curve.

The Indians kept right on hit
ting him in the seventh until they
had scored two more runs and
SC's Bob Blakeslee had relieved
Barudoni to put out the fire.
Rich DeFabio. starting his first
games since breaking his jaw
three weeks ago, led off the sev
enth with a walk. Another walk
to pinchhitter Jeff Bertleson and
a line-kissing single to left by
Jim Burk scored DeFabio. Min
utes later von Wronski's second
hit of the game scored Dave Car
ter, running for Bertleson.
String landed
Other than that the scoring was
all Southern California's. Their
first-inning tally in the first game
ended a 22 scoreless inning streak
by Stanford pitchers which had
been put together over a week's
play.

Shuts out Santa Clara
Not the IJSC team that won the
: 1958 NCAA championships but
| it was a very good facsimile that
handed Dutch Fehring's Indians
a double dose of "seven - run"
losses on Sunken Diamond Satur
day.
The Trojans were not missing
center fielder .Ron Fairly or sec
ond sacker Mike Castanon (hath
departed to the pro ranks) as
they got a seven hit shutout from
lefthander Bruce Gardner and six
sharp hits from third baseman
John Wei has to post 7-0, 7-3 vic
tories over the Indians.
Stanford clung to second place
in CIBA standings, however, by
virtue of Earl Russell's .six-hit,
1-0 victory over Santa Clara Fri
day. And that, after all, is the im-

portant slot as far as the Indians
are concerned.
By winning second Stanford
can earn a berth to the NCAA
playoff competition this year
since the Trojans are ineligible.
Their overhead was adjudged too
high last fall.
But USC, in the meantime, con
tinued on its way to another Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Baseball
championship by feeding its un
beaten conference record (7-0
now> with three victories over
northern teams this weekend.
The Trojans also beat California
Friday 14-2.
Newkirk Singles
Until Joel Newkirk scored Art
von Wronski with a sixth-inning
single in the second game Satur
day, it looked like a double white
wash job for the Troyboys. Off
and onner Jim Barudoni was
having much the same success as
his predecessor with a breaking
fastball and a well-spaced curve.

The Indians kept right on hit
ting him in the seventh until they
had scored two more runs and
SC's Bob Blakeslee had relieved
Barudoni to put out the fire.
Rich DeFabio. starting his first
games since breaking his jaw
three weeks ago, led off the sev
enth with a walk. Another walk
to pinchhitter Jeff Bertleson and
a line-kissing single to left by
Jim Burk scored DeFabio. Min
utes later von Wronski's second
hit of the game scored Dave Car
ter, running for Bertleson.
String landed
Other than that the scoring was
all Southern California's. Their
first-inning tally in the first game
ended a 22 scoreless inning streak
by Stanford pitchers which had
been put together over a week's
play.
The Trojans waited until the
second inning to grab their com
manding lead. Starter John Gil
lis was relieved by Warren Nel
son after walking Len Gabrielson,
Ron Stillwell and Bill Heath to
start the inning.
In the second game, ihe Smog

jnns collected two runs in the
first and fifth (thai quick lead
againt and enjoyed another three
run inning in the seventh.
Itarudoni Singles
Barudoni singled to center, ex
scat back Don Bulord was safe
when pitcher Terry Lindeman
misplayed his hunt and Fred
Scott forced Barudoni at third
on an altempted sacrifice.
Then the dangerous Mr. VVer
has, who could do no wrong,
smashed Lirideman's second serv
ing to right center for a double
and his sixth hit in what should
have been a knock-down situation
for Stanford's pitcher.
A wild pitch and fielder's choice
later YVerhas was across the plate
with SC's final run.
Only One Needed
Stanford needed only an un
earned run in the fourth inning to
post Friday's 1-0 victory over
Santa Clara. Ben Robinson and
Newkirk singled. Winter bounced
to the mound and pitcher Frank
Sobrero threw the ball away at
third trying to get Robinson.
Other than that the ball game
was all Russell's, as the sopho
more righthander fanned four,
walked two and chalked up his
seventh victory of the year.
Friday's game:
Stanford 000 100 000—I 7 0
Santa Clara 000 000 000—0 0 1
Russell and Winter; Sobrero
and Brown.
