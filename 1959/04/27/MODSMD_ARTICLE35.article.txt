# Applications Now Accepted For Psych Honors Program
## 
### 
Applications are now being ac
cepted for Ihe psychology honors
program. Six or seven outstand
ing and interested psychology
majors are selected at the begin
ning of their junior year for this
program by the Department of
Psychology.
Each quarter these students
participate in a three-unit honors
seminar which includes an exten
sive reading list covering five
areas of psychology.
The purpose of this seminar
system is to encourage individual
e d u eat ion instead of formal
classes. The meetings are under
t lie direction of a carefully se
lected advanced graduate student.
Mis role is to encourage and fa
cilitate discussion, not to impose
a specific direction on their study
or to force compliance with a spe
cific interpretation of the mate
rial.
The official staff of the depart
ment does not interfere in any
direct way with this part of the
program.
The other half of the program
is devoted to research training.
The theme underlying this re
search training is that the honors
.student should have the same ap
prenticeship relationship to the
staff member as does the gradu
ate student who has been hired as
a research assistant.
It is expected that by I lie be
ginning of his senior year eacli

student will be able to undertake
an independent piece of research
of the same scope as a master's
candidate or even in some in
stances of the doctoral candidate,
the program only after formal
A student may be admitted to
consideration of his application
by the Honors Committee. An
application blank may be ob
tained from the department secre
tary.
