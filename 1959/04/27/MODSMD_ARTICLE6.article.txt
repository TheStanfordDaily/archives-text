# Anawalt, Sundeen: On Rushing
## 
### Leo Krulitz, Editor 
Both candidates for ASSU pres
ident, Rich Sundeen and Howie
Anawalt, agreed yesterday that
rushing this spring left some
thing to be desired. They differed
as to the extent and solutions of
the problem.
Anawalt told The Daily in an
interview that rushing was adc
qute in many ways but that rush
ees were more frustrated this
year and that a lot of "pro-rush
ing" had gone on. He commented,
"The no-contact rule isn't serving
the purpose it was meant for."
lie suggested these solutions to
the rushing problem: Have tlie
no-contact rule rigidly enforced
during autumn quarter, and get
rid of it and maintain only a few
"small" rules during winter quar
ter.
"Normal Atmosphere"
This, he commented, would
"create a normal atmosphere that
would flow right into rush."
Sundeen told The Daily he
thought Legislature had a defi
nite place in investigating rush.
He went on to say, "I don't think
there should be a rigid no-contact
rule; we need to mingle during
winter- quarter." He added that
he wouldn't have freshmen going
into the houses, however, because
"it would be giving some houses
a head start."
Sundeen said, "The no contact
rule is contrary to the purposes
of a university."
Would Keep Rule
When asked how the two could
be reconciled or which should
dominate, Sundeen replied, "The
purposes of the University are
paramount, but I still wouldn't
do away with the no-contact rule.
Until a better solution is found
for the sake of the fraternities
and the freshmen the no-contact
rule is necessary to rushing."
He went on, "Pre - sophomore
year rushing is a solution, but as
of now 1 think the disadvantages
outweigh the benefits, but 1
would like to take it to the frater
nities and let them analyze it."
After citing what he consid
ered disadvantages of pre-sopho
more year rushing, Anawalt said,
"I can't condemn the idea total
ly."

no-contact rule rigidly enforced
during autumn quarter, and get
rid of it and maintain only a few
"small" rules during winter quar
ter.
"Normal Atmosphere"
This, he commented, would
"create a normal atmosphere that
would flow right into rush."
Sundeen told The Daily he
thought Legislature had a defi
nite place in investigating rush.
He went on to say, "I don't think
there should be a rigid no-contact
rule; we need to mingle during
winter- quarter." He added that
he wouldn't have freshmen going
into the houses, however, because
"it would be giving some houses
a head start."
Sundeen said, "The no contact
rule is contrary to the purposes
of a university."
Would Keep Rule
When asked how the two could
be reconciled or which should
dominate, Sundeen replied, "The
purposes of the University are
paramount, but I still wouldn't
do away with the no-contact rule.
Until a better solution is found
for the sake of the fraternities
and the freshmen the no-contact
rule is necessary to rushing."
He went on, "Pre - sophomore
year rushing is a solution, but as
of now 1 think the disadvantages
outweigh the benefits, but 1
would like to take it to the frater
nities and let them analyze it."
After citing what he consid
ered disadvantages of pre-sopho
more year rushing, Anawalt said,
"I can't condemn the idea total
ly."
Both candidates for ASSU pres
ident, Rich Sundeen and Howie
Anawalt, agreed yesterday that
rushing this spring left some
thing to be desired. They differed
as to the extent and solutions of
the problem.
Anawalt told The Daily in an
interview that rushing was adc
qute in many ways but that rush
ees were more frustrated this
year and that a lot of "pro-rush
ing" had gone on. He commented,
"The no-contact rule isn't serving
the purpose it was meant for."
lie suggested these solutions to
the rushing problem: Have tlie
no-contact rule rigidly enforced
during autumn quarter, and get
rid of it and maintain only a few
"small" rules during winter quar
ter.
