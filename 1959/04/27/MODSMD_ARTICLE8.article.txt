# Constitution Snafu Affects Council Election-No Final
## Richards Calls for Alterations 
### 
Eleclion Chairman John Rich
ards has declared Sue Palmer,
Carla Soracco and Carlin Kvans
elected to Women's Council as a
result of last week's primary
elections. As there were only
three seats to fill, no run-off will
be necessary in general elections
this week.
Richards told The Daily, "The
constitution provides, 'If a ma
jority of the voters vote for a can
didate in the primary election, the
candidate shall be declared elect
ed.' We have no alternative but.
to rule these three girls elected."
The total number of voters vot
ing for Women's Council was
848. Miss Palmer had 644 votes,
Miss Soracco received 497 votes
and Miss Evans had 437 ballots
cast for her.
"Could Go Wrong"
"We can see where this provi
sion could go wrong," Richards
said. "It would be possible to
have elected four or five girls to
these three offices. Under the cir
cumstances, however, we feel we
must comply with the by-laws. I
sincerely hope that Legislature
will see fit to make the necessary
changes before next year's elec
tions."
Richards, emphasizing that
write-in votes are not allowed in
the final elections and that a
write-in would void the entire bal
lot, said, "A lot of the confusion
and hard feelings could have been
avoided if the candidates and vot
ers had taken the election more
seriously.
