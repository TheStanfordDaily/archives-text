Editorial

l',i,K\ i\ i> vvs \<,o I lie I>ail\ presented for consideration an elec
tion plan designed to improve the quality of yell-leading at Stan
lord. l itis constitutional change, which would have the head yell
leader he elected during fall quarter and serve from the start of
basketball season through the end of football season, met with
Legislature's approval and has been placed on this week s general
election hallol for student hods approval.
We urge a '"Yes" vote on this proposal.
Kcasons iu favor of the change were presented in detail in the
earlier editorial. In brief, we think that by this change:
• Yell leaders will be more experienced during football sea
son the most difficult portion of their term,
• Yell leaders will be far more interested iu working during
the winter and spring sports seasons, sime these will not be anti
cli mact ic to I onl ha 11.
• Ibis method would he superior to selection bv some soil
of board, which has also been proposed al various times.
• I' all elections would permit a real-situation try-out for can
did.tics, allowing students to observe their \ ell-leading capabilities
as well as their abilitv to stage a showy campaign.
Support for ibis measure is bv no means confined to The Daily.
It was approved b\ Legislature with oiilv one dissentinj: vole; Llee
lions (iommission chairman John liichards endorses it: it was
favored bv a majority of this year's bead yell leader candidates;
and present veil leader Dick Stanford, a man most familiar with
the problems of the office, has wholeheartedlv endorsed the plan.
In the interests of an improved veil-leading situation not per
fect, certainlv, but improved we ask you to vote "Yes 1 on this
constitutional amendment when you vote \\ eduesday or Thursdav.

Amendment

Students will vote tomorrow
and Thursday on tho following
amendment to the ASSU constitu
tion:
"The Head Cheer Leader shall
he elected at the regular Autumn
Quarter election by the Associa
tion at large. He shall take of
fice at the beginning of Winter
Quarter and hold office until the
beginning of the following Win
ter Quarter. This Amendment
shall become effective Autumn
Quarter 1959."
The Legislature is considering
a bylaw which would provide for
candidates to try out for Head
Veil Leader at the last home
football game of each season, be
fore the Autumn Quarter elee
lion. The bylaw, in contrast, to
the amendment, may be passed
by the Legislature without being
voted on by the student body as
a whole.
It two-thirds of the students ap
prove the constitutional amend
ment, to be voted on in the gen
eral election, the amendment will
replace the following provision:
"The Head Cheer Leader shall
be elected at the regular Spring
Quarter election by the Associa
tion at large. Me shall take office
after Ihe close of the following
Summer Quarter and hold office
until the end of the next Spring
Quarter."

Campus Comments

Several people whom The Daily
asked lo eomment on the pro
posed amendment had this to
say:
"I'm very enthusiastic about
the change," said Howie Ana
wall, candidate for ASSU presi
dent.
Rich Sundeen, also ASSU presi
dential candidate, said, "I think
we should give it a try,"
Walt .Jue, candidate lor head
yell leader: "I believe such a
method would provide the stu
dent body an opportunity t.o sop
the candidates under actual con
ditions."
The other candidate for head
yell leader, Bill Kartozian, stated,
"The amendment would do much
to improve the condition of yell
leading."
Mary Lou MrKinley, candidate
for WRA president, said, "I think
it would be very advantageous
to have the election in the fall.
Taking over at a game would lie
a more reliable way of determin
ing if he has the necessary qual
ifications."
"It would seem to me to be
merely a matter of convenience
and 1 see no reason to become
emotionally involved," said Steve
Berry, El Cuadro president.
"I don't care," said Roxane
Heater, president of Union Resi
dence.

Editor, The Daily:
Last Thursday, Legislature proposed a consti
tutional amendment in regards to the election of
the head cheerleader. Such an amendment would,
essentially, change the head cheerleader election
from spring quarter to autumn quarter, but would
not, of course, affect the present head cheerleader
election. This proposed amendment will be sub
mitted to the members of the student body for
their approval in this week's general election. To
be adopted, the amendment must receive two
thirds of the votes cast.
It has become quite apparent that the present
system is an inadequate means of selecting head
cheerleaders. The head cheerleader selected by
the process now used enters football season, his
most trying period, without any experience in
front of a crowd. This is rough on football fans
and head cheerleaders alike. Such an experience
leaves a head cheerleader and assistants pretty
well burned out and unenthusiastic by the time
basketball season comes around.
Under the proposed change, the head cheerlead
er would start his term of office at the beginning
of winter quarter, and, thus, would have unex
hausted enthusiasm and energy to apply to the bas
ketball season. This would be to the advantage of
both spectators and the head cheerleader, for that
new head cheerleader would be testing new ideas
and being trained under small crowd conditions,
both at the same time. Thus, it would be an expe
rienced head cheerleader that would start the next
football season.
In this new system, the head cheerleader would
have spring quarter to perfect his good points and
cure his ills, as brought out by basketball season.
Also, during that winter and spring quarter period,
the new head cheerleader and his crew would have
the advantage of the knowledge and experience of
his predecessor who would still be in school. This
would give Stanford University an autumn quar
ter head cheerleader possessing a combination of

new ideas, enthusiasm, knowledge and experience
which would he hard to beat.
Also embodied in this constitutional change
would be a by-laws change saying that the head
cheerleader candidates would appear before the
rooting section during the first football game prior
to autumn primary election. This would bo the
first time at Stanford that almost the entire stu
dent body would have the opportunity to see their
head cheerleader candidates, under semi-actual
conditions, before voting on these candidates. This
would mean an election of a head cheerleader
based on head cheerleader qualities, instead of the
usual spring quarter popularity contest.
Also, the change separates the head cheerleader
election from the more serious ASSU presidential
and vice-presidential elections. Such a change
would be a healthy one as it would accentuate
the importance of issues brought out in the presi
dential and vice-presidential campaigns issues
that are now drowned out by the necessarily
showy, stunt-type election associated with head
cheerleader candidates.
The only possible drawbacks to this change are:
< 1> that tho campaign for a new head cheerleader
will be during the paramount season of Ihe exist
ing head cheerleader's term, and <2i difficulties
arising during basketball season might tend to
carry over into the next football season. But, it;
can be readily seen that these drawbacks are self
correcting and also of much less consequence
than the advantages of the proposed change.
From a cheerleading, elections' and spectators'
point of view, we feel this change is one that
should be enacted now. It will mean nothing but
improvement of the existing system. We strongly
urge a yotc in favor of the constitutional amend
ment.
