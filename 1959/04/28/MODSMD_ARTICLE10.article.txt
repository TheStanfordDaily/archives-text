## Anawalt Favors Substitute For Cluster System Proposal 
### Leo Krulitz, Editor 
An election eve rally will give students a lust chance to hear candi
dates speak tonight at 8:30 in Cubberley Auditorium. Presidential
candidates Rich Sundeen and Howie Anawalt will speak, Walt Jue
and Bill Karto/.ian wi IJ be heard in a panel discussion on yell loading
and tin' proposed constitutional amendment, and Dick Stanford and

John Bohn will serve as modera
tors.
Anawalt, commenting on areas
of ASSU concern, told The Daily:
: "I think that Stanford fraternities
'should be aided by the ASSU in
finding a more agreeable substi
tute for the proposed cluster sys
tem.
"Only by assuming leadership
in fields such as these can the
ASSU ever command the interest i
and respect of tho students."
Sundeen, answering the charge
that there isn't really anything for
student government to do, said
that "things which will affect stu
dents—like housing, for example
hit within Legislature's con
cern."
He suggested areas in which
student government could have
been more interested in the past,
such as the General Studies Pro
gram and the four-year integrat
ed housing experiment in the in
dependent men's houses and in
women's residences.
Kuiidceu Suggests
Sundeen suggested that better
lines of communication between
the Administration and students
would have helped prevent the
problems which arose over the
AYVS housing policies and the Los
I Altos party.
"1 think the Administration is
(willing to listen to our views so
long as we present them in a well
thought-out way," Anawalt com
mented. "This is exemplified by
the Bookstore charge accounts.
Legislature had the facts and pre
sented them.
"Student government can have
a real powerful say and hand in
administration; it can obtain
many of the things students de l
sire if it presents persuasive argu-j
ments." lie suggested that stu
dents have to "arm themselves|
with facts" and use a tactful aj> |

Three Proposals
Sundeen outlined three propos
als to strengthen relations be
tween the Administration and the
at udents:
(It Make Legislature a sound
ing board to the Administration
by having a member of the presi
dent's staff meet with them often:
; (2> reorganize the president's Ad
visor.v Committee on Academic
I Affairs, "widening representation
I on il and broadening its scope";
! and (3> use more forums in which
students and administrators could
discuss policy issues.

gested, "obt:iinin{? study rooms
ind longer Library hours is alsr;
i pari of the realm of student
government."
Wall J lie, candidate for head
yell leader, told The Daily yester
day:
"It has been brought to my at
tent ion thai then? was some mis
understanding over my statement
'I'm not an ideal; my one goal is
to carve out a foothold for all ori
entals at Stanford,' which appeal j
cd in The Daily last Friday, 2\<
April. I meant for it to be humor- j
ous, but I can see how il could
easily be taken in the wrong way.:
"More important, however, re '
gardless of what connotations one
receives from the statement, is
that I'm a Stanford man, and my
main interest in this campaign is
yell-leading and an opportunity to
express my ideas and enthusiasm
as the head yell leader."
Kartozian issued I lie following
comments yesterday:
"As is probably now apparent
to all who have followed the re
sults of the election, my cam
paign for everything has been]
narrowed down so that every
thing will now be devoted to my <
election as head pompon hoy.

The Kartozian Ideal will continue,
however.
"It will include a slight modifi
cation, though. It is now Kar
tozian for Everyone.
"My imagination will continue
rampant in the creation of enter
taining episodes for the enjoy
ment of the student body. Re

Wall J lie, candidate for head
yell leader, told The Daily yester
day:
"It has been brought to my at
tent ion thai then? was some mis
understanding over my statement
'I'm not an ideal; my one goal is
to carve out a foothold for all ori
entals at Stanford,' which appeal j
cd in The Daily last Friday, 2\<
April. I meant for it to be humor- j
ous, but I can see how il could
easily be taken in the wrong way.:
"More important, however, re '
gardless of what connotations one
receives from the statement, is
that I'm a Stanford man, and my
main interest in this campaign is
yell-leading and an opportunity to
express my ideas and enthusiasm
as the head yell leader."
Kartozian issued I lie following
comments yesterday:
"As is probably now apparent
to all who have followed the re
sults of the election, my cam
paign for everything has been]
narrowed down so that every
thing will now be devoted to my <
election as head pompon hoy.

The Kartozian Ideal will continue,
however.
"It will include a slight modifi
cation, though. It is now Kar
tozian for Everyone.
"My imagination will continue
rampant in the creation of enter
taining episodes for the enjoy
ment of the student body. Re
member, Kartozian is more than
a man, he is an Ideal Yell Lead
er."
An election eve rally will give students a lust chance to hear candi
dates speak tonight at 8:30 in Cubberley Auditorium. Presidential
candidates Rich Sundeen and Howie Anawalt will speak, Walt Jue
and Bill Karto/.ian wi IJ be heard in a panel discussion on yell loading
and tin' proposed constitutional amendment, and Dick Stanford and

John Bohn will serve as modera
tors.
Anawalt, commenting on areas
of ASSU concern, told The Daily:
: "I think that Stanford fraternities
'should be aided by the ASSU in
finding a more agreeable substi
tute for the proposed cluster sys
tem.
"Only by assuming leadership
in fields such as these can the
ASSU ever command the interest i
and respect of tho students."
Sundeen, answering the charge
that there isn't really anything for
student government to do, said
that "things which will affect stu
dents—like housing, for example
hit within Legislature's con
cern."
He suggested areas in which
student government could have
been more interested in the past,
such as the General Studies Pro
gram and the four-year integrat
ed housing experiment in the in
dependent men's houses and in
women's residences.
Kuiidceu Suggests
Sundeen suggested that better
lines of communication between
the Administration and students
would have helped prevent the
problems which arose over the
AYVS housing policies and the Los
I Altos party.
"1 think the Administration is
(willing to listen to our views so
long as we present them in a well
thought-out way," Anawalt com
mented. "This is exemplified by
the Bookstore charge accounts.
