# This Point of View
## Writer 'Failed to Get the Point' 
### Gregory H. Davis 
A letter to the editor, written
by j. B. Karrh and published in
last Friday's Daily, criticized a
recent Daily editorial which ex
pressed concern about the lack ol
Negro students at Stanford. The
writer imputes to the editorial the
aim of securing the enrollment ol
more Negroes at Stanford to
"prove to the world that we at
Stanford are fair, just and light."
This imputation indicates that
Mr. Karrh not only failed to get
the point of the editorial regard
ing Negroes at Stanford, but does
not understand the purpose of
having Negroes at universities at
all (which, in turn, betrays a
complete misunderstanding of
the whole Negro problem in this
country).
I am certain that Mr. Karrh
will not quarrel with the fact that
Negroes are both a troubled and
sometimes troublesome minority
in this nation. They need leaders
of their own race badly, and pre
sumably educated Negroes are
more able to provide responsible
leadership than uneducated ones.
The purpose of Stanford hav
ing more Negro students is not
to ensure more dark faces on the
Quad for the purposes of con
spicuous liberal consumption, but
to participate in the training of
these leaders.
Presumably Stanford is one of
the better universities in the
country; it does not seem prac
tical that a reputable university
should ignore this group in se
lecting its students.
At another point in this letter,
Mr. Karrh has written this gem:
"May 1 be the first tu shake the
hand of the victor who has
fought clean and hard. But it is

lolly to bestow the same laurels
on one who would ask that his
patli be made more easy."
This statement evidently refers
to thie fact that Stanford might
have to adjust entrance require
ments downward in Ihe case of
Negroes, also providing in many
cases extensive financial aid. For
a number ol reasons Negro appli
cants are not as well equipped to
enter college as while students.
it seems that the only way that
the Negro will ever be able to
break the vicious circle which
keeps him in this retarded state
of development is to "make his
path more easy," at least in the
beginning. It is better, one would
think, to grant him an education
on this basis, rather than to deny
him one altogether.
The position Mr. Karrh has
adopted toward the problem ol
Negroes at Stanford seems lo be
just another incidence of the
manifestation ot a fashionable
point ol view (at this time) on
this campus, which has also been
expressed concerning loyalty
oaths, free thought and discus
sion and the like.
I wonder it Mr. Karrh is yel
another member of this minority
of students (1 hope it is a minor
ity), which has engaged in a type
ol "derivative intellectual bask
ing."
It is possible to deal with this
matter and other problems of a
similar nature on a superficial in
tellectual level perhaps il is
even "fun" for some students to
express opinions of this nature.
But il is far 1 better to consider
these problems in the light of the
real implications of what we are
saying, and the real human fac
tors involved.

aim of securing the enrollment ol
more Negroes at Stanford to
"prove to the world that we at
Stanford are fair, just and light."
This imputation indicates that
Mr. Karrh not only failed to get
the point of the editorial regard
ing Negroes at Stanford, but does
not understand the purpose of
having Negroes at universities at
all (which, in turn, betrays a
complete misunderstanding of
the whole Negro problem in this
country).
I am certain that Mr. Karrh
will not quarrel with the fact that
Negroes are both a troubled and
sometimes troublesome minority
in this nation. They need leaders
of their own race badly, and pre
sumably educated Negroes are
more able to provide responsible
leadership than uneducated ones.
The purpose of Stanford hav
ing more Negro students is not
to ensure more dark faces on the
Quad for the purposes of con
spicuous liberal consumption, but
to participate in the training of
these leaders.
Presumably Stanford is one of
the better universities in the
country; it does not seem prac
tical that a reputable university
should ignore this group in se
lecting its students.
At another point in this letter,
Mr. Karrh has written this gem:
"May 1 be the first tu shake the
hand of the victor who has
fought clean and hard. But it is

lolly to bestow the same laurels
on one who would ask that his
patli be made more easy."
This statement evidently refers
to thie fact that Stanford might
have to adjust entrance require
ments downward in Ihe case of
Negroes, also providing in many
cases extensive financial aid. For
a number ol reasons Negro appli
cants are not as well equipped to
enter college as while students.
it seems that the only way that
the Negro will ever be able to
break the vicious circle which
keeps him in this retarded state
of development is to "make his
path more easy," at least in the
beginning. It is better, one would
think, to grant him an education
on this basis, rather than to deny
him one altogether.
The position Mr. Karrh has
adopted toward the problem ol
Negroes at Stanford seems lo be
just another incidence of the
manifestation ot a fashionable
point ol view (at this time) on
this campus, which has also been
expressed concerning loyalty
oaths, free thought and discus
sion and the like.
I wonder it Mr. Karrh is yel
another member of this minority
of students (1 hope it is a minor
ity), which has engaged in a type
ol "derivative intellectual bask
ing."
It is possible to deal with this
matter and other problems of a
similar nature on a superficial in
tellectual level perhaps il is
even "fun" for some students to
express opinions of this nature.
But il is far 1 better to consider
these problems in the light of the
real implications of what we are
saying, and the real human fac
tors involved.
A letter to the editor, written
by j. B. Karrh and published in
last Friday's Daily, criticized a
recent Daily editorial which ex
pressed concern about the lack ol
Negro students at Stanford. The
writer imputes to the editorial the
