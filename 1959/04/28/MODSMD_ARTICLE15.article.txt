To Recognize or Nor Recognize

(Editor's Nole: Waller Lipp
irian lias just returned from Eu
rope, where lie has taken a
first.haml look al the Berlin cri
sis. This is the sixth of a se
ries on (lie situation.)
The best we can expert from
the coming negotiations is not a
settlement but a modus vivendi.
The big question, as 1 see it, is
whether to recognize and regulate
the situation that we cannot now
change, or to accept the facts as
they are but to refuse to recog
nize them on the theory that
some day and somehow the facts
will change for the better.
Conflicts of Opinion
In so far as there are conflicts
of opinion among the Western
allies, they arise primarily over
this question, is Dr. Ade
nauer's view, which has the for
mal support of General de Gaulle,
that while there are in fact two
Germanys, nothing must be said
or done by the Allies which recog
nizes the existence of the other
Germany.
Thus Dr. Adenauer's subordi
nate officials negotiate traffic
and other agreements with the
Communist officials. They ar
gue that if we did tlie same, we
would destroy the fiction that
the East German state does not
really exist as a fact in the in
ternational world.
As against this there is the
British view which is based on
the practical and prosaic idea that
since the East German state does

in fact exist, we shall all have to
live with it.
Before we meet the Russians
in the coming conferences, this
country will have to make up its
mind about where it stands in the
argument between the Germans
and the British. It is a hard
choice to make. For though the
issue is posed in a theoretical fo
rum, there are grave substantial
risks which may follow either
choice.
The essential argument for
Dr. Adenauer's doctrine of non
recognition does not come from
any passionate interest of his
in reunification of Germany.
Dr. Adenauer knows that reuni
fication is not practical politics
and it is no secret that as an
old Khinelander his heart does
not bleed for a close political
union with the Prussians and
the Saxons of the East.
His doctrine of not recognizing
the East German state is a de
fense against German national
ism which, if it goes on a ram
page for German unity, may up
set the whole applecart窶年ATO,
the Common Market, the entente
with France, and the alignment
of Western Germany with the
Western society against the bar
barians of the East.
In the last analysis, we are
asked to follow Dr. Adenauer's
doctrine of the fact of the two
Germany's in order lo avoid
the defeat of his party in the
German elections of 1961.

ries on (lie situation.)
The best we can expert from
the coming negotiations is not a
settlement but a modus vivendi.
The big question, as 1 see it, is
whether to recognize and regulate
the situation that we cannot now
change, or to accept the facts as
they are but to refuse to recog
nize them on the theory that
some day and somehow the facts
will change for the better.
Conflicts of Opinion
In so far as there are conflicts
of opinion among the Western
allies, they arise primarily over
this question, is Dr. Ade
nauer's view, which has the for
mal support of General de Gaulle,
that while there are in fact two
Germanys, nothing must be said
or done by the Allies which recog
nizes the existence of the other
Germany.
Thus Dr. Adenauer's subordi
nate officials negotiate traffic
and other agreements with the
Communist officials. They ar
gue that if we did tlie same, we
would destroy the fiction that
the East German state does not
really exist as a fact in the in
ternational world.
As against this there is the
British view which is based on
the practical and prosaic idea that
since the East German state does

in fact exist, we shall all have to
live with it.
Before we meet the Russians
in the coming conferences, this
country will have to make up its
mind about where it stands in the
argument between the Germans
and the British. It is a hard
choice to make. For though the
issue is posed in a theoretical fo
rum, there are grave substantial
risks which may follow either
choice.
The essential argument for
Dr. Adenauer's doctrine of non
recognition does not come from
any passionate interest of his
in reunification of Germany.
Dr. Adenauer knows that reuni
fication is not practical politics
and it is no secret that as an
old Khinelander his heart does
not bleed for a close political
union with the Prussians and
the Saxons of the East.
His doctrine of not recognizing
the East German state is a de
fense against German national
ism which, if it goes on a ram
page for German unity, may up
set the whole applecart窶年ATO,
the Common Market, the entente
with France, and the alignment
of Western Germany with the
Western society against the bar
barians of the East.
In the last analysis, we are
asked to follow Dr. Adenauer's
doctrine of the fact of the two
Germany's in order lo avoid
the defeat of his party in the
German elections of 1961.
