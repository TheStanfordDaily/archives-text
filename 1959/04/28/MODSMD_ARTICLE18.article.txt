# IIR POLITICAL ANALYSIS
## Iraq Appears to be Coming Under Moscow's Control 
### Michael Haas 
Under cover of the heavily pub
lici/.ed Berlin crisis, the hammer
and sickle, however surreptitious
ly, have probably gone up over-
Iraq for good.
indeed, Red party control is so
complete that no power center
inside the oil-rich country dares
oppose Moscow.
Sliawaf Uprising:
Paradoxically, it was last
month's abortive Shawaf upris
ing that supplied the high cards
to the Reds. For, just as Premier
Kassim might have had a chance
to build up (.'enters of resistance
to the Communists, the Shammar
and Jabhour tribes threatened his
security; and, commanding only
fractionalized remnants of the
former Royal Iraqi Army, he had
to watch Red - trained Kurdish
tribesmen put down the revolt.
Itching for Battle
As a result, the Shammars, par
ticularly angered by the March 10
execution of 300 of their kinsmen
by a People's Court in Mosul, are
itching for a battle, and the Syr
ian army, recently purged of pro-
Soviet elements, may be willing
to contribute their 12 brigades
and GO jets to the Shammars.
In economics, the March 1(5 eco
nomic and technical co-operation
pact with Moscow promised Kas-

weeks later he canceled a previous
British contract for a steel plant,
as well as the French contracts
for yarn-spinning and natural gas
Second Purge
On the 2!>th anniversary of the |
I Iraqi Communist Party April 1
Salam Adel, party secretary, in |
: a display of his power, demanded j
| the arming of the Popular Rc
; sistance Forces, and called for a
second purge of the army and j
the bureaucracy.
Four days later, Kassim began j
the purge. The next week Mili
tary Governor General el-Abdi j
announced that the PRF had been 1
armed.
Future Target
A future target of the Reds is I
out of the Baghdad Pact as a con- j
dition for canceling a pre World
War Two treaty which gives the
USSR ihe right to intervene in
Iran.
Loyalty Doubtful
The loyalty of the Shah's
troops is in considerable doubt,
particularly since Iraqi propagan
da has been attracting Iranian
Kurds with prospects of an inde
pendent Kurdistan.
Kassim, meanwhile, appears
more and more a Naguib-style
I lront-man, entirely at the dispos-
I al of subordinates.

In lake over Kuwait, if their un
successful efforts there on April
1 are any clue. A British protec
torate, Kuwait is absolutely indis
pensable to Western Kurope- 55
million tons of oil anually
whereas Iraq (32 million tons an
nually) is not.
Next would come Iran, which
was bullied around by the Soviet
government last month to pull
