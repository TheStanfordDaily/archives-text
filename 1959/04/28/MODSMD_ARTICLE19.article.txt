# Big Weekend Coming; All Roads Lead to Cal
## 
### 
It's Big Game, Big Meet or Big
Match at almost every turn this
week as Stanford's spring sports
learns prepare to take on their
University of California rivals in
two days called, oddly enough,
Big Weekend.
The lineup calls for lour base
ball games, lwo track meets, two
golf matches and two tennis
matches. Only the Stanford crew
still "orphans" as far as a con
nection with the Athletic Depart
ment is concerned does not meet
Cal. The rowers have a week off.
Truck Is Close
The weekend is biggest, as usu
al, for the baseball and track
teams. It's always a major track
meet this year's could be one of
the closest ever and the stakes
are especially high as the two
baseball teams meet.
Coach Dutch Fehring's Card
nine hosts the Bears Friday at
the Sunken Diamond and the
clubs meet Saturday in Berkeley.
The Tribe stands in second place
in the California Intercollegiate
Baseball race with a C>-i record.
Cal is keeping pace with a 4-4
mark and second place is the big
goal for each club because it
means a shot at the top playoff
prizes as way-out-in-front South
ern California is ineligible for
post-season play.
Stanford and Cal have met once
on the diamond this year with the
Bears coming out 7 ;> victors in a
Berkeley till. »
Trojans Kooiped
Neither club fared oVerly well
against the power laden Trojans
ol the South last weekend. Cal
lost a single game, I 1-2, while the
Cards were dropping both ends
of a doubleheader, 7-0 and 7-3.
Karl Russell, unbeaten in CIBA
play and who throttled heavy
hitting Santa Clara on six hits
last week, looks like the Tribe's
big hope to turn back the Bears.
Left-handers Marv Mecklenburg
or Terry Lindeman, who have met
with varying success this season,
undoubtedly will be Fehring's oth
er choice. Or there could always
he right • hander Warren Nelson,
outstanding hk relief all season.
The Stanford Papoose baseball

ers, who haven't lost yet and have
done their winning by strato
spheric scores, get a shot at the
Cubs Saturday morning at Bush
rod Park And the Braves, who
nipped Cal's JV's three weeks ago
behind a beautiful 13 - inning
mound job by Jim Cowart, get a
chance to make it two in a row
Saturday at Cal.
Two Meets in One
Two track meets at once is the
big attraction of the Saturday af_
ternoon across the bay. The var
sity and frosh teams of each
school get together in two meets
that should be close ones.
A moderate "come - through"

| (lay by Stanford "athletes will
wrap up Payton Jordan's first
nig Meet victory.
Stanford frosh records are in
jeopardy in several events as the
Papooses will he favored over a
spotty Bearcub team. Don Bell,
who last week cracked Boh Ma
thias' old discus mark, will try
to add a few inches to his own
new record. Dan Moore, who in
two jumps came within an inch
and one • half of Brooks Town
send's one-year-old broad .jump
record, gets a big chance for that
mark. Rich Klier, who has al
ready tied the HSI) tries for
the 1::">3 range and another rec
ord.
Action on Farm
Tennis and golf action centers
lal Stanford this year. In tennis,
J Ihe Card varsity will be after its
second straight 9-0 whitewashing
j while the Papooses will be seek
ing to avert such a fate. Chances
i look good for at least 8-1 repeats.
And while the Bears may be
catching up in tennis, they don't
appear ready to do the same in
I golf. The frosh teams tee off at
| 10 a.m. and the varsities at 1 p.m.
Saturday on the Stanford links.
