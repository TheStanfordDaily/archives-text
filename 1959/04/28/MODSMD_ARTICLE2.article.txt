"We are very grateful for' tho sincerity and hospitality shown by
Americans, hut \vc always have been disturbed over the fact that
the German government of Bonn has never offered any material
satisfaction for the misery we endured." These were the comments
of Joanna Szydolwska, head of the group of Ravcnsbrueck "lapins"

visiting campus yesterday.
She worked in Poland for sev
eral months getting documents in
an unsuccessful atte m pi to

in the Polish underground army
when they were captured by the
German army. Fifty-three sur
vived, all of them bearing the evi
dence of the knives or drugs that
had been used on them.
Alter the war they returned lo
Poland and set about restoring
I their lives. They got jobs if they
could, some returned to their
families and a few got married.
They waited for Germany to
make some gesture of amends
and for (Ik* rest of the world to
become aware of what had hap
pened at Ravcnsbrueck.
Post-war Poland
Life was difficult for everyone
in post-war Poland, and even

shima Maidens project; Jeanne
Benenson, director and organizer;
Erica Anderson, photographer;
and Norman Cousins, editor of

tration camp in Germany during
| World War 11.
Women ('aptured
At the time many of them were
in their early twenties, and as a
group they were well educated in
medicine, science, education or
the arts. The 71 women had been
in the Polish underground army
when they were captured by the
German army. Fifty-three sur
vived, all of them bearing the evi
dence of the knives or drugs that
had been used on them.
Alter the war they returned lo
Poland and set about restoring
I their lives. They got jobs if they
could, some returned to their
families and a few got married.
They waited for Germany to
make some gesture of amends
and for (Ik* rest of the world to
become aware of what had hap
pened at Ravcnsbrueck.
Post-war Poland
Life was difficult for everyone
in post-war Poland, and even
more so for these women, many
lof whom needed expert medical
attention. A team of four people
: finally found them and organized
them: F)r. William M. Hit/.ig of
New York, who had served as
medical consultant to the Hiro
shima Maidens project; Jeanne
Benenson, director and organizer;
Erica Anderson, photographer;
and Norman Cousins, editor of
the Saturday Review, who head
ed the whole plan.
