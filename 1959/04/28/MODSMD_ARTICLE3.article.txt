Pis time, man, we're really gil
tin to dc heart of de matter.
We're gonna see a reel Man's
magazine.
Well, we'll see a parody of one,
that is.
It's this way: Hie little men of
the Chappie have decided that
they don't like being little men
any more, so, to assert their de
batable masculinity (wait till you
see the mag!) they will attempt
to sell a parody of True tomor
row for <10 cents.
Of interest, at least to some
body, will be the book-length tea
lure "Rebel Without a Cause."
"The Grand Prix fie la Farm,"
"The New Mental Finess Test"
and a sad tale about "The Mata
dor and the Bull."
We always thought they bad
nothing to say but a lot of bull.
