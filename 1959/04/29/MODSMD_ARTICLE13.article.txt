# Chappie Parodys 'True'; Calls for Males to Rise
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
Down wid togedderness! Up wid de real MFN 1 ! And such goes the
cry of this month's Chappie, a parody of True magazine. The parody,
entitled Tube, goes on sale today at the inflationary price of 40 cents.
The basic theme behind the parody seems to be a howl in the dark
that men should he really MEN and not the pansies that people, and

in particular women, seem to
think thoy arc.
The two best articles in Iho
parody are "The New Mental Fit
ness Test" and "Scandal in Our
Army." The first is an obviously
overworked but nonetheless amus
ing take-off on certain psychologi
cal tests, and the second is a par
ody on the lack of reasoning found
in many MEN's articles on physi
cal fitness.
The Ad
The funniest thing in Ihe whole
magazine, however, is to be found
on the inside front cover. A sup
posed ad, it alone is worth the
! exorbitant price the Chappies are
charging this month. You see, it's
about the limp-handed erowrl that
(frequent the Palo Alto Southern
| Pacific station and . . .
While what (here is of "The
Grand Prix de la Farm" is of fair
| interest, the illustrations- all too
i obviously cut-outs pasted »>n pic
i tures of Quad lend a debatable
| quality to the article.
Quality?
But then, one might question
1 1he quality of the original article
and the quality of the subject of
the entire parody.
Supposedly what printers call a
"jump" (a portion of an article
that began on another page), one
finds verbatim quotes from Win-
I nie the Pooh, The Odyssey, West
| orn Civilizations Mth ed.i, Wal
den, The Little Tailor, Dostoyev
sky's Brothers Karamazov, Gulli
ver's Travels and the never-failing
j Heart of Darkness.
All ami All . . .
All in all, the parody this month
j isn't so good. This, as was pointed
| out before, is possibly due to the
I quality of the original magazine
j in which ease the parody is su
perb. This, however, seems du
bious.

cal tests, and the second is a par
ody on the lack of reasoning found
in many MEN's articles on physi
cal fitness.
The Ad
The funniest thing in Ihe whole
magazine, however, is to be found
on the inside front cover. A sup
posed ad, it alone is worth the
! exorbitant price the Chappies are
charging this month. You see, it's
about the limp-handed erowrl that
(frequent the Palo Alto Southern

While what (here is of "The
Grand Prix de la Farm" is of fair
| interest, the illustrations- all too
i obviously cut-outs pasted »>n pic
i tures of Quad lend a debatable
| quality to the article.
Quality?
But then, one might question
1 1he quality of the original article
and the quality of the subject of
the entire parody.
Supposedly what printers call a
"jump" (a portion of an article
that began on another page), one
finds verbatim quotes from Win-
I nie the Pooh, The Odyssey, West
| orn Civilizations Mth ed.i, Wal
den, The Little Tailor, Dostoyev
sky's Brothers Karamazov, Gulli
ver's Travels and the never-failing
j Heart of Darkness.
All ami All . . .
All in all, the parody this month
j isn't so good. This, as was pointed
| out before, is possibly due to the
I quality of the original magazine
j in which ease the parody is su
perb. This, however, seems du
bious.
Down wid togedderness! Up wid de real MFN 1 ! And such goes the
cry of this month's Chappie, a parody of True magazine. The parody,
entitled Tube, goes on sale today at the inflationary price of 40 cents.
The basic theme behind the parody seems to be a howl in the dark
that men should he really MEN and not the pansies that people, and

in particular women, seem to
think thoy arc.
The two best articles in Iho
parody are "The New Mental Fit
ness Test" and "Scandal in Our
Army." The first is an obviously
overworked but nonetheless amus
ing take-off on certain psychologi
cal tests, and the second is a par
ody on the lack of reasoning found
in many MEN's articles on physi
cal fitness.
