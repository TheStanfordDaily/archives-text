# Issues Not Developed
## 
### 
Elections this spring have been extremely uninteresting —despite
the efforts of The Daily ami other interested people. It was our
hope that these elections would provide a forum for a discus
sion of many of the pertinent problems facing the campus—and
not problems as The Daily defined them, but problems as the
candidates saw them. We have tried to give the candidates ample
opportunity to raise issues themselves.
Our efforts haven't produced results, and we would like to
speculate why.
We don't think the answer is that there simply aren't any
problems facing us.
Bill Kartozian, commenting after his name had been
written in hundreds of times throughout the primary bal
lot, said, "Tlw vote indicates a lack of confidence in cer
tain areas of student government." Maybe the. issue should
have been whether or not to even keep student govern
ment, but at least a pertinent issue, is how we can correct
the uncertain state in which student government finds
itself. Neither candidate has convinced us that he tan
remedy the situation.
Probably the real problem with this election is that the two
candidates for president are too much alike—their positions co
incide on most of the things that we, at least, consider issues.
There has been no candidate who is willing to step on toes and
take a controversial stand.
There has been no candidate to ask for pre-sophomore-year
rushing so that the problem might be debated among the students.
There has been no candidate to say that the. ASSU
has NO power to censor discussion on topics—a matter
which has been made pertinent by cancellation of a Stan
ford Left debate on technicalities and by other actions.
There has been no candidate to say whether the Fundamental
Standard means anything or whether it should be abolished.
There has been no candidate to say that the University presi
dent's Advisory Committee on Academic Affairs need not repre
sent student opinion.
There has been no candidate to favor the cluster system.
There hasn't even been a candidate to say he thinks the women
should have bed sheet service.
In short, the candidates have either held the same positions
on these matters or haven't taken a stand on them.
There are a host of other things. IVe've had no bold
ideas on how to make Judicial Councils effective —only
comments that it needs to be done. We have had com
ments that student-Administration relations need improv
ing from both candidates, but no real hint as to what is
supposed to flow back and forth in these improved chan
nels. This is an untouched area in itself.
We don't mean to say the candidates aren't qualified; our po
sition as to qualifications for offices has already been stated. These
are two fine people; both are capable of handling the job well.
We had sincerely hoped to support a single candidate in this
election; we find we cannot, because we don't see a candidate who
will do much more with the office than has been done in the past.
\\ ith these thoughts, it is a little hard to urge Stanford students
to vote, so we won't —except for the constitutional amendment,
which we think will, at least, attempt to remedy an unfortunate
i: nation which has existed too long.
