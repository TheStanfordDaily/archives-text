Epigram: On the Statements of
Presidential Candidates in The
Stanford Daily, April 27, 19i>!>
O pity the poor fraternity men:
bereft,
Alone, forbidden to rush, stag
nant and left
To talk to themselves both fall
and winter. O,
And look, there be the lonely
freshmen who.
All eyes and longing, tongues
drooping, stand

In line, two quarters, waiting for
the hand
Of some brushed smile to wel
come (crush) their own.
The rushing rules—say some—be
poor, have sown
Illegal pocket pledging. Shame
fast stand,
Who made good rules: you make
our MEN a band
Of sneaking Greeks. Despair not;
succor is at hand: I mean
Achilles—Anawalt, and Agamem
non—Rich Sundeen.
Del C. Wilcox
