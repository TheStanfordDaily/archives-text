# Adenauer's Presidency Move Provokes German Speculation
## 
### Steve Freidberg 
Konrad Adenauer, the grand
old man of Germany, surprised
even the closest onlookers three
weeks ago with the announce
ment that he would give up his
present Chancellorship and run
for the largely honorific office of
President of the German Repub
lie in July.
Since his decision there has
been much speculation in the
Western world as to his reasons
for the move, his successor and
particularly any changes which
may result in German policy at
this critical time.
Der A He
Der Alto, as he is affectionately
called, has held the position of
Chancellor, the highest office in
Germany, since the initiation of
the West German Republic in
1949 and has been personally re
sponsible for a large part of the
independence and leadership Ger
many now wields. He has held
firm rein on the policies of both
his country and his party, the
C hr is t i a n Democrats, by his
strong and often domineering per
sonality.
As of two months ago Ade
nauer had publicly made known
that he intended to run for his
fourth term as Chancellor in 19G1
and even went so far as to at
tempt unsuccessfully to persuade
Dr. Ludwig Erhard, Vice-Chancel
lor and Economics Minister, to
run for the Presidency which will
be vacated this fall. Present of
fice holder is Theodor Heuss, who
cannot be a candidate himself
having served the constitution
ally allowable two terms.
Possible Reasons
Efforts to unravel the mystery
around Adenauer's step have un
covered numerous possible rea
sons for the move.
According to Dr. Gordon
Wright, professor of history at
Stanford, probably the main ex
planation is that Adenauer was
"motivated by the feeling he was
losing control over the party ma
chinery - of the Christian Demo
crats. There has been restlessness
evident in his control for some
time."
Opposition Indicated
Certain conflicts with close
party members indicate an oppo
sition to der Alte's decisions
which seemingly have not been
questioned until now. The most
recent example of this was Er
hard's refusal to be a candidate
for the President's job.
A second reason, Wright said,
is the impact of the De Gaulle ex
periment in France whereby the
President became a key figure.
Adenauer undoubtedly feels that
he can make the position more
than that of a figurehead.
Reversal
"This is ironical because ten
years ago he told Heuss that the
President had little power, and
now he referses himself."
"Of course," Wright comment
ed, "even the weakest office can
become more powerful with a
strong man. However, he is de
luding himself by thinking that
he can have as much influence as
De Gaulle."
One major power of the Presi
dent is to nominate a candidate
for Chancellor who must then be
approved by the Bundestag or
lower house of the German legis
lature.
Poor Health
Other causes of his resignation
may include a poor state of health
and old age, Adenauer being 83
now. In fact, just recently he
has said something about finding
a successor for him when he dies,
a subject that has been strictly
avoided by him up to the present.
Speculation also has it that
Adenauer was convinced by the
CDU that the party would have
a better chance of electing the

Chancellor in 19G1 if they ran
someone who had been in office
two years. This, of course, as
sumes that Adenauer had been
persuaded not to count on run
ning in 1961 himself. But what
ever it was that instigated his
move to give up the Chancellor's
office, it had apparently not influ
enced him until recently.
Amendment
The German Constitution does
not grant the President many
powers other than those of an
advisory and representative na
ture. To get around that would
require a constitutional amend
ment, a great difficulty in view of
a strong opposition party, the So
cial Democrats.
In the event Adenauer defeats
Social Democrat Carlo Schmid
for the Presidency, an occurrence
which Wright feels is inevitable,
the Chancellor would have to be
a Protestant. There exists an un
written rule in German govern
ment. that the two top officials
must not be of the same faith,
and Adenauer is a Catholic.
Erhard
With this in mind, the top can
didate seems to be Erhard who
has been in the cabinet since 1949
and who is a quite popular and
colorful figure. However, he will
probably be challenged by Franz
Etzel, Federal Minister of Fi

nance, a comparative newcomer
to the political field.
"Adenauer may nominate Etzel
if he thinks he can get away with
it," Wright said. "Etzel has been
closer than Erhard to Adenauei
in many ways, particularly in re
gard tu the six-nation European
federation."
Other Fur tors
Other factors enter in, how
ever, some of these being thai
Et/el is not well known in poli
tics, dimming his chances for win
nirig in the 1961 elections, and he
lias been unwell for some time
Also, Erhard would possibly re
sent the blow to his prestige, and
the party might lose him as a
leading participant.
There are no other candidates
who are even considered as hav
ing a good opportunity to be
nominated.
Effect on Germany
One major question which has
ari s en since Adenauer's an
nouncement has been its effect on
Germany and the possibility of
any changes.
Wright felt that there will be
little major revision of Ger
many's stand on foreign and do
mestic affairs, although he said
there will he a loosening of em
phasis on the six-nation federa
tion if Erhard is elected. Erhard
is in favor of little government
participation regulation in com
merce and industry and would
therefore greatly disapprove of
any plan involving the govern
ment more.
Gradual Softening
There may also be a gradual
softening of German policy to
ward Russia, according Wright;
for Adenauer has remained ada
mant in his demands and refus
als. A third change will probably
be the development of more fac
tionalism in the CDU in view of
the lack of a strong leader. How
ever, Adenauer may remain head
of the party for a while.
Wright indicated that there is a
good possibility for a change of
the party in power. The Social
Democrats, who up to this time
have been in the minority, might
be able to take advantage of the
change in the CDU to obtain
more support and win a national
election in the foreseeable future.

Effect on Germany
One major question which has
ari s en since Adenauer's an

Germany and the possibility of
any changes.
Wright felt that there will be
little major revision of Ger
many's stand on foreign and do
mestic affairs, although he said
there will he a loosening of em
phasis on the six-nation federa
tion if Erhard is elected. Erhard
is in favor of little government
participation regulation in com
merce and industry and would
therefore greatly disapprove of
any plan involving the govern
ment more.
Gradual Softening
There may also be a gradual
softening of German policy to
ward Russia, according Wright;
for Adenauer has remained ada
mant in his demands and refus
als. A third change will probably
be the development of more fac
tionalism in the CDU in view of
the lack of a strong leader. How
ever, Adenauer may remain head
of the party for a while.
Wright indicated that there is a
good possibility for a change of
the party in power. The Social
Democrats, who up to this time
have been in the minority, might
be able to take advantage of the
change in the CDU to obtain
more support and win a national
election in the foreseeable future.


KONHAD ADENAUER
Konrad Adenauer, the grand
old man of Germany, surprised
even the closest onlookers three
weeks ago with the announce
ment that he would give up his
present Chancellorship and run
for the largely honorific office of
President of the German Repub
lie in July.
Since his decision there has
been much speculation in the
Western world as to his reasons
for the move, his successor and
particularly any changes which
may result in German policy at
this critical time.
Der A He
Der Alto, as he is affectionately
called, has held the position of
Chancellor, the highest office in
Germany, since the initiation of
the West German Republic in
1949 and has been personally re
sponsible for a large part of the
independence and leadership Ger
many now wields. He has held
firm rein on the policies of both
his country and his party, the
C hr is t i a n Democrats, by his
strong and often domineering per
sonality.
As of two months ago Ade
nauer had publicly made known
that he intended to run for his
fourth term as Chancellor in 19G1
and even went so far as to at
tempt unsuccessfully to persuade
Dr. Ludwig Erhard, Vice-Chancel
lor and Economics Minister, to
run for the Presidency which will
be vacated this fall. Present of
fice holder is Theodor Heuss, who
cannot be a candidate himself
having served the constitution
ally allowable two terms.
Possible Reasons
Efforts to unravel the mystery
around Adenauer's step have un
covered numerous possible rea
sons for the move.
According to Dr. Gordon
Wright, professor of history at
Stanford, probably the main ex
planation is that Adenauer was
"motivated by the feeling he was
losing control over the party ma
chinery - of the Christian Demo
crats. There has been restlessness
evident in his control for some
time."
Opposition Indicated
Certain conflicts with close
party members indicate an oppo
sition to der Alte's decisions
which seemingly have not been
questioned until now. The most
recent example of this was Er
hard's refusal to be a candidate
for the President's job.
A second reason, Wright said,
is the impact of the De Gaulle ex
periment in France whereby the
President became a key figure.
Adenauer undoubtedly feels that
he can make the position more
than that of a figurehead.
Reversal
"This is ironical because ten
years ago he told Heuss that the
President had little power, and
now he referses himself."
"Of course," Wright comment
ed, "even the weakest office can
become more powerful with a
strong man. However, he is de
luding himself by thinking that
he can have as much influence as
De Gaulle."
One major power of the Presi
dent is to nominate a candidate
for Chancellor who must then be
approved by the Bundestag or
lower house of the German legis
lature.
Poor Health
Other causes of his resignation
may include a poor state of health
and old age, Adenauer being 83
now. In fact, just recently he
has said something about finding
a successor for him when he dies,
a subject that has been strictly
avoided by him up to the present.
Speculation also has it that
Adenauer was convinced by the
CDU that the party would have
a better chance of electing the

Chancellor in 19G1 if they ran
someone who had been in office
two years. This, of course, as
sumes that Adenauer had been
persuaded not to count on run
ning in 1961 himself. But what
ever it was that instigated his
move to give up the Chancellor's
office, it had apparently not influ
enced him until recently.
Amendment
The German Constitution does
not grant the President many
powers other than those of an
advisory and representative na
ture. To get around that would
require a constitutional amend
ment, a great difficulty in view of
a strong opposition party, the So
cial Democrats.
In the event Adenauer defeats
Social Democrat Carlo Schmid
for the Presidency, an occurrence
which Wright feels is inevitable,
the Chancellor would have to be
a Protestant. There exists an un
written rule in German govern
ment. that the two top officials
must not be of the same faith,
and Adenauer is a Catholic.
Erhard
With this in mind, the top can
didate seems to be Erhard who
has been in the cabinet since 1949
and who is a quite popular and
colorful figure. However, he will
probably be challenged by Franz
Etzel, Federal Minister of Fi

nance, a comparative newcomer
to the political field.
"Adenauer may nominate Etzel
if he thinks he can get away with
it," Wright said. "Etzel has been
closer than Erhard to Adenauei
in many ways, particularly in re
gard tu the six-nation European
federation."
Other Fur tors
Other factors enter in, how

Et/el is not well known in poli

Chancellor in 19G1 if they ran
someone who had been in office
two years. This, of course, as
sumes that Adenauer had been
persuaded not to count on run
ning in 1961 himself. But what
ever it was that instigated his
move to give up the Chancellor's
office, it had apparently not influ
enced him until recently.
Amendment
The German Constitution does
not grant the President many
powers other than those of an
advisory and representative na
ture. To get around that would
require a constitutional amend
ment, a great difficulty in view of
a strong opposition party, the So
cial Democrats.
In the event Adenauer defeats
Social Democrat Carlo Schmid
for the Presidency, an occurrence
which Wright feels is inevitable,
the Chancellor would have to be
a Protestant. There exists an un
written rule in German govern
ment. that the two top officials
must not be of the same faith,
and Adenauer is a Catholic.
Erhard
With this in mind, the top can
didate seems to be Erhard who
has been in the cabinet since 1949
and who is a quite popular and
colorful figure. However, he will
probably be challenged by Franz
Etzel, Federal Minister of Fi

nance, a comparative newcomer
to the political field.
"Adenauer may nominate Etzel
if he thinks he can get away with
it," Wright said. "Etzel has been
closer than Erhard to Adenauei
in many ways, particularly in re
gard tu the six-nation European
federation."
Other Fur tors
Other factors enter in, how
ever, some of these being thai
Et/el is not well known in poli
tics, dimming his chances for win
nirig in the 1961 elections, and he
lias been unwell for some time
Also, Erhard would possibly re
sent the blow to his prestige, and
the party might lose him as a
leading participant.
There are no other candidates
who are even considered as hav
ing a good opportunity to be
nominated.
Effect on Germany
One major question which has
ari s en since Adenauer's an
nouncement has been its effect on
Germany and the possibility of
any changes.
Wright felt that there will be
little major revision of Ger
many's stand on foreign and do
mestic affairs, although he said
there will he a loosening of em
phasis on the six-nation federa
tion if Erhard is elected. Erhard
is in favor of little government
participation regulation in com
merce and industry and would
therefore greatly disapprove of
any plan involving the govern
ment more.
Gradual Softening
There may also be a gradual
softening of German policy to
ward Russia, according Wright;
for Adenauer has remained ada
mant in his demands and refus
als. A third change will probably
be the development of more fac
tionalism in the CDU in view of
the lack of a strong leader. How
ever, Adenauer may remain head
of the party for a while.
Wright indicated that there is a
good possibility for a change of
the party in power. The Social
Democrats, who up to this time
have been in the minority, might
be able to take advantage of the
change in the CDU to obtain
more support and win a national
election in the foreseeable future.


KONHAD ADENAUER
Konrad Adenauer, the grand
old man of Germany, surprised
even the closest onlookers three
weeks ago with the announce
ment that he would give up his
present Chancellorship and run
for the largely honorific office of
President of the German Repub
lie in July.
Since his decision there has
been much speculation in the
Western world as to his reasons
for the move, his successor and
particularly any changes which
may result in German policy at
this critical time.
Der A He
Der Alto, as he is affectionately
called, has held the position of
Chancellor, the highest office in
Germany, since the initiation of
the West German Republic in
1949 and has been personally re
sponsible for a large part of the
independence and leadership Ger
many now wields. He has held
firm rein on the policies of both
his country and his party, the
C hr is t i a n Democrats, by his
strong and often domineering per
sonality.
As of two months ago Ade
nauer had publicly made known
that he intended to run for his
fourth term as Chancellor in 19G1
and even went so far as to at
tempt unsuccessfully to persuade
Dr. Ludwig Erhard, Vice-Chancel
lor and Economics Minister, to
run for the Presidency which will
be vacated this fall. Present of
fice holder is Theodor Heuss, who
cannot be a candidate himself
having served the constitution
ally allowable two terms.
Possible Reasons
Efforts to unravel the mystery
around Adenauer's step have un
covered numerous possible rea
sons for the move.
According to Dr. Gordon
Wright, professor of history at
Stanford, probably the main ex
planation is that Adenauer was
"motivated by the feeling he was
losing control over the party ma
chinery - of the Christian Demo
crats. There has been restlessness
evident in his control for some
time."
Opposition Indicated
Certain conflicts with close
party members indicate an oppo
sition to der Alte's decisions
which seemingly have not been
questioned until now. The most
recent example of this was Er
hard's refusal to be a candidate
for the President's job.
A second reason, Wright said,
is the impact of the De Gaulle ex
periment in France whereby the
President became a key figure.
Adenauer undoubtedly feels that
he can make the position more
than that of a figurehead.
Reversal
"This is ironical because ten
years ago he told Heuss that the
President had little power, and
now he referses himself."
"Of course," Wright comment
ed, "even the weakest office can
become more powerful with a
strong man. However, he is de
luding himself by thinking that
he can have as much influence as
De Gaulle."
One major power of the Presi
dent is to nominate a candidate
for Chancellor who must then be
approved by the Bundestag or
lower house of the German legis
lature.
Poor Health
Other causes of his resignation
may include a poor state of health
and old age, Adenauer being 83
now. In fact, just recently he
has said something about finding
a successor for him when he dies,
a subject that has been strictly
avoided by him up to the present.
Speculation also has it that
Adenauer was convinced by the
CDU that the party would have
a better chance of electing the

Chancellor in 19G1 if they ran
someone who had been in office
two years. This, of course, as
sumes that Adenauer had been

losing control over the party ma
chinery - of the Christian Demo
crats. There has been restlessness
evident in his control for some
time."
Opposition Indicated
Certain conflicts with close
party members indicate an oppo
sition to der Alte's decisions
which seemingly have not been
questioned until now. The most
recent example of this was Er
hard's refusal to be a candidate
for the President's job.
A second reason, Wright said,
is the impact of the De Gaulle ex
periment in France whereby the
President became a key figure.
Adenauer undoubtedly feels that
he can make the position more
than that of a figurehead.
Reversal
"This is ironical because ten
years ago he told Heuss that the
President had little power, and
now he referses himself."
"Of course," Wright comment
ed, "even the weakest office can
become more powerful with a
strong man. However, he is de
luding himself by thinking that
he can have as much influence as
De Gaulle."
One major power of the Presi
dent is to nominate a candidate
for Chancellor who must then be
approved by the Bundestag or
lower house of the German legis
lature.
Poor Health
Other causes of his resignation
may include a poor state of health
and old age, Adenauer being 83
now. In fact, just recently he
has said something about finding
a successor for him when he dies,
a subject that has been strictly
avoided by him up to the present.
Speculation also has it that
Adenauer was convinced by the
CDU that the party would have
a better chance of electing the

Chancellor in 19G1 if they ran
someone who had been in office
two years. This, of course, as
sumes that Adenauer had been
persuaded not to count on run
ning in 1961 himself. But what
ever it was that instigated his
move to give up the Chancellor's
office, it had apparently not influ
enced him until recently.
Amendment
The German Constitution does
not grant the President many
powers other than those of an
advisory and representative na
ture. To get around that would
require a constitutional amend
ment, a great difficulty in view of
a strong opposition party, the So
cial Democrats.
In the event Adenauer defeats
Social Democrat Carlo Schmid
for the Presidency, an occurrence
which Wright feels is inevitable,
the Chancellor would have to be
a Protestant. There exists an un
written rule in German govern
ment. that the two top officials
must not be of the same faith,
and Adenauer is a Catholic.
Erhard
With this in mind, the top can
didate seems to be Erhard who
has been in the cabinet since 1949
and who is a quite popular and
colorful figure. However, he will
probably be challenged by Franz
Etzel, Federal Minister of Fi

nance, a comparative newcomer
to the political field.
"Adenauer may nominate Etzel
if he thinks he can get away with
it," Wright said. "Etzel has been
closer than Erhard to Adenauei
in many ways, particularly in re
gard tu the six-nation European
federation."
Other Fur tors
Other factors enter in, how
ever, some of these being thai
Et/el is not well known in poli
tics, dimming his chances for win
nirig in the 1961 elections, and he
lias been unwell for some time
Also, Erhard would possibly re
sent the blow to his prestige, and
the party might lose him as a
leading participant.
There are no other candidates
who are even considered as hav
ing a good opportunity to be
nominated.
Effect on Germany
One major question which has
ari s en since Adenauer's an
nouncement has been its effect on
Germany and the possibility of
any changes.
Wright felt that there will be
little major revision of Ger
many's stand on foreign and do
mestic affairs, although he said
there will he a loosening of em
phasis on the six-nation federa
tion if Erhard is elected. Erhard
is in favor of little government
participation regulation in com
merce and industry and would
therefore greatly disapprove of
any plan involving the govern
ment more.
Gradual Softening
There may also be a gradual
softening of German policy to
ward Russia, according Wright;
for Adenauer has remained ada
mant in his demands and refus
als. A third change will probably
be the development of more fac
tionalism in the CDU in view of
the lack of a strong leader. How
ever, Adenauer may remain head
of the party for a while.
Wright indicated that there is a
good possibility for a change of
the party in power. The Social
Democrats, who up to this time
have been in the minority, might
be able to take advantage of the
change in the CDU to obtain
more support and win a national
election in the foreseeable future.


KONHAD ADENAUER
Konrad Adenauer, the grand
old man of Germany, surprised
even the closest onlookers three
weeks ago with the announce
ment that he would give up his
present Chancellorship and run
for the largely honorific office of
President of the German Repub
lie in July.
Since his decision there has
been much speculation in the
Western world as to his reasons
for the move, his successor and
particularly any changes which
may result in German policy at
this critical time.
Der A He
Der Alto, as he is affectionately
called, has held the position of
Chancellor, the highest office in
Germany, since the initiation of
the West German Republic in
1949 and has been personally re
sponsible for a large part of the
independence and leadership Ger
many now wields. He has held
firm rein on the policies of both
his country and his party, the
C hr is t i a n Democrats, by his
strong and often domineering per
sonality.
As of two months ago Ade
nauer had publicly made known
that he intended to run for his
fourth term as Chancellor in 19G1
and even went so far as to at
tempt unsuccessfully to persuade
Dr. Ludwig Erhard, Vice-Chancel
lor and Economics Minister, to
run for the Presidency which will
be vacated this fall. Present of
fice holder is Theodor Heuss, who
cannot be a candidate himself
having served the constitution
ally allowable two terms.
Possible Reasons
Efforts to unravel the mystery
around Adenauer's step have un
covered numerous possible rea
sons for the move.
According to Dr. Gordon
Wright, professor of history at
Stanford, probably the main ex
planation is that Adenauer was
"motivated by the feeling he was
losing control over the party ma
chinery - of the Christian Demo
crats. There has been restlessness
