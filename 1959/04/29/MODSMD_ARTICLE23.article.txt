# THE 						Finish Line

The llonietowiiers Were Amazed
When a team ventures into strange territory, it often gets its
ears pinned back. But sometimes it manages to pull off a nice big
surprise like Stanford did at the Drake Relays last week.
As track coach Payton Jordan tells it, when he and the small
fmlian delegation arrived in Des Moines last Thursday, all the talk
among the coaches and in the press was about the great distance
medley race scheduled for Saturday.
Oklahoma Michigan Sate Kantsas — Oklahoma State these
Midwest teams were really tough and were really after each other.
Apparently some names and times of people like Bertil Lundh and
Ernie I'unlit'fe hadn't filtered back to lowa, because all Jordan heard
were friendly warnings about how the distance medley would be a
good race to stay out of. "Boy, you don't want to get in with these
medley teams —they're tough!"
Jordan allowed as how he'd "sure be looking forward to seeing
that race," and he merely listened to all the enthusiastic Midwestern
ers had to say about all their stars who'd be running in the medley.
By the time the race rolled around, Stanford had a good book on
everybody else in the race.
Dick Lassen led off with his 880 leg, and ran a fine 1:53.0, leaving
him second, six yards back of Oklahoma. Don Chesarek then
knocked off his best 440 of the season, swiftly made up ground on
the leading Sooner, and whizzed past him as the pair came home for
the pass to the 1320 men.
At this moment, says Jordan, the crowd sensed a gallant bid by
an upstart crew from the West, and immediately began to yell for
the Indians.
Lundh played il cool and acording to strategy on his three-lap
stint. He let the Oklahoma man run just off his shoulder for more
than a lap, then out anticipated him. While the Sooner was thinking
about making a move to take the lead, Lundh suddenly spurted and
opened up an eight-yard lead before his opponent could react.
Lundh held on to his margin the rest of the way, finally giving
Cunliffe a 10-yard lead at the start of the anchor mile. And this is
where the master strategy began.
Mister Cunliffe raced his first lap in 55 seconds.
Gail Was a Trace Uncertain
Gail Hodgson, the 4:04 man from Oklahoma who was supposed
to mop up on the anchor stint, hardly knew what to do. But being
a not-too-good judge of pace and probably not thinking that Cunliffe
was going THAT fast, Hodgson ripped out, too.
By the end of the first quarter, Cunliffe had a fat lead. lie then
shifted into coasting gear for the second lap. Hodgson, however, kept
right on going. Speeding up even a bit, the Oklahoman started to
narrow the gap and was almost ready to catch Cunliffe halfway
through the race.
So at this moment, as per instructions, Cunliffe tore out again.
"And you could see Hodgson's legs all of a sudden just begin to
wobble," says Jordan. He fell farther and farther back, and Cunliffe
came all the way home just as nice as you please.
By the final lap. Hodgson was so far gone that Michigan State,
which had been fairly far back, came whipping on past to get the
second place 15 yards behind the Indians. Cunliffe, despite running
the race with the most difficult pace imaginable, clocked a season's
best of 4:113.
And Hodgson, the 4:04 wonder who was supposed to clean up,
came trailing home with a 4:18 mile.
Regretting somewhat that he had to ask Cunliffe to run the race
as he did, Jordan said "after coming all that way, we wanted to go
lor a win rather than time. And after hearing all the talk, that
looked like the best way to win."
John Kelly was another one who upset the Drake applecart. From
Canada by way of the University of Housotn comes Jack Smyth, who
hadn't lost in the past three years in relay meet hop-step-jump com
petition.
Per form. Smyth led at 48-10 *■», and Kelly had only one jump left.
Kelly and Jordan figured it would take a 31-foot hop-step to set up
a good effort. So Kelly lined up the 31 feet and approaches with tele
phone poles and lines on the field, had the runway manicured to
gain a little resting and settling time, and then calmly won the event
with a leap of 49-1. Smyth still had one effort left but it didn't do
him any good.
By way of note, it was the third major competition this year that
Kelly had won on his final effort.
Ifs Nothing Impossible
Although Cal is a justified favorite in Saturday's Big Meet, Ihc
affair isn't so open-and-shut that a dope sheet can't be worked out
in Stanford's favor. Though my "most logical" picks, to appear Fri
day, will probably have the Bears on top by six or eight points, here's
how things might go to send Indian fans home happy.
KM) Pease and Smith 2-3 behind White of Cal. 220—At least a
second between White and Yerman. 440—Chesarek and Besse 2-3
behind Yerman. H.SO Cunliffe and Lassen 1-3 around Siebert. Mile
Cunliffe and Lundh over Siebert for- eight points. Two-mile Mon
y.ingo over Gaylord with Martin third.
High hurdles Hope for the point behind Russ and Karlsrud of
Cal. Lows Anftther struggle for one point, this time behind White
and Russ.
Shot Winters and Atkinson 1-3, Crow second for Cal. Javelin—
Backstrand a second, at least, and Korth for third. Discus—Crow
second again, this time between DeWeese and Liminer. High jump-
Two points for Gillespie in a tie for second. Broad jump Kelly over-
Runs in the best field event fight of the meet. Pole vault Franclietti
and Merchant to scrap for the four points behind Kelley of Cal.
Relay Since we've only dredged up 62 points so far, it looks like
a relay victory is a "must," So Stanford wins it for five points, a
total of 67, and Payton Jordan's first Big Meet victory.
