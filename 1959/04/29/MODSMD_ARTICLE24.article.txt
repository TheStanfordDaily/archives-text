# Cunliffe-Siebert Key to Big Meet
## 
### 
Last year ii was Bowden vs.
Lloyd; this year it's Cunliffe vs.
Siebert in ihe pair of races that
look to be thf> highlights of the
64th Big Meet Saturday in Ber
keley.
It coaches Brutus Hamilton of
California and Pay ton Jordan of
Stanford go through with plans
announced Monday, Cunliffe and
Siebert will tangle first in the
mile and then again in the 880.
Both are at their best in the
shorter race, but on the other
hand, neither has had an all-out
test in the mile as yet this year.
Cunliffe boasts the fastest col
legiate time in the nation, 1:49.9,
while Siebert has run 1:151.0. In
the mile, the Cal ace's best is
4:14.2. Cunliffe ran a 4:11.3 an
chor lap on Stanford's distance
medley team last weekend for his
top effort.
Though for the sake of time, it
might be best if Cunliffe and Sie
bert confined their efforts to the
880, point strategy in both camps
almost assuredly dictates their
also meeting in the mile.
Siebert Only Cal Miler
iSebert is Cal's only really good
miler, and the Bears need him in
there to try to break up a 1-2
Stanford finish. But Jordan has
to put Cunliffe in the four-lapper
to keep Siebert from stealing too
many points for the Bears.
In the mile, of course, the duel
will not be theirs alone. Bertil
Lundh, the Indians' soph from
Norway, will be in the field and
has as good a chance as the other
two of taking it all.
How the mile goes will natural
ly determine what kind of an 880
shapes up. Should the four-lap
per develop into a real blazer,
both men might be left fairly
tired and vulnerable to a loss at
the hands of Stanford's Dick Las
sen or even Jack Yerman of the
Bears, should he be thrown into
the race.
Siebert Won PCC Title
Cunliffe and Siebert met in two
principal races last year—Big
Meet and PCC championships.
The score stands 1-1, since Cun
liffe won the dual race and Sie
bert captured the conference title.
Cunliffe's victory over Don
Bowden in Big Meet marked the
first time Bowden had ever lost
an 880. Siebert was third in the
race. In PCC, Cunliffe faded to a
1:52.1, nearly two seconds off his
best, while Siebert kicked in for
a strong 1:51.0.
The outlook is for Cunliffe to
set the pace in both the mile and
880, since Siebert likes to hang
back a bit and rely on his strong
finishing drive. This is Cunliffe's
normal strategy, and worked to
perfection against Bowden last
year as he opened up a 12-yard
lead at the 660 and then held on
gamely.
Both from Small Schools
Both principals have similar
high school backgrounds — each
came from a small California
school and starred in the
880 during his senior year.
Cunliffe, from Claremont High,
hung up his best prep mark of
1:54.7 in winning the 1955 South
ern Section OF title. Bad luck
stalked him in the state meet that
year, however. Leading with only
a couple of strides to go, Cunliffe
fell, barely shy of the finish line,
and went unplaced.
Siebert was a virtual unknown
until the state meet of 1956. Run
ning for Willits High, which did
n't even have a regulation track,

Siebert upset a great field I<j win
the state title in 1:53.5.
Since Cunliffe laid out the 1957
season with an injury, both men
are only juniors in eligibility and
will bo back at each other's neck
in 1960.

Both from Small Schools
Both principals have similar
high school backgrounds — each
came from a small California
school and starred in the
880 during his senior year.
Cunliffe, from Claremont High,
hung up his best prep mark of
1:54.7 in winning the 1955 South
ern Section OF title. Bad luck
stalked him in the state meet that
year, however. Leading with only
a couple of strides to go, Cunliffe
fell, barely shy of the finish line,
and went unplaced.
Siebert was a virtual unknown
until the state meet of 1956. Run

n't even have a regulation track,

Siebert upset a great field I<j win
the state title in 1:53.5.
Since Cunliffe laid out the 1957
season with an injury, both men
are only juniors in eligibility and
will bo back at each other's neck
in 1960.

Ho holds Cal hopes in iiijj
Last year ii was Bowden vs.
Lloyd; this year it's Cunliffe vs.
Siebert in ihe pair of races that
look to be thf> highlights of the
64th Big Meet Saturday in Ber
keley.
It coaches Brutus Hamilton of
California and Pay ton Jordan of
Stanford go through with plans
announced Monday, Cunliffe and
Siebert will tangle first in the
mile and then again in the 880.
Both are at their best in the
shorter race, but on the other
hand, neither has had an all-out
test in the mile as yet this year.
Cunliffe boasts the fastest col
legiate time in the nation, 1:49.9,
while Siebert has run 1:151.0. In
the mile, the Cal ace's best is
4:14.2. Cunliffe ran a 4:11.3 an
chor lap on Stanford's distance
medley team last weekend for his
top effort.
Though for the sake of time, it
might be best if Cunliffe and Sie
bert confined their efforts to the
880, point strategy in both camps
almost assuredly dictates their
also meeting in the mile.
Siebert Only Cal Miler
iSebert is Cal's only really good
miler, and the Bears need him in
there to try to break up a 1-2
Stanford finish. But Jordan has
to put Cunliffe in the four-lapper
to keep Siebert from stealing too
many points for the Bears.
In the mile, of course, the duel
will not be theirs alone. Bertil
Lundh, the Indians' soph from
Norway, will be in the field and
has as good a chance as the other
two of taking it all.
How the mile goes will natural
ly determine what kind of an 880
shapes up. Should the four-lap
per develop into a real blazer,
both men might be left fairly
tired and vulnerable to a loss at
the hands of Stanford's Dick Las
sen or even Jack Yerman of the
Bears, should he be thrown into
the race.
Siebert Won PCC Title
Cunliffe and Siebert met in two
principal races last year—Big
Meet and PCC championships.
The score stands 1-1, since Cun
liffe won the dual race and Sie
bert captured the conference title.
Cunliffe's victory over Don
Bowden in Big Meet marked the
first time Bowden had ever lost
an 880. Siebert was third in the
race. In PCC, Cunliffe faded to a
1:52.1, nearly two seconds off his
best, while Siebert kicked in for
a strong 1:51.0.
The outlook is for Cunliffe to
set the pace in both the mile and
880, since Siebert likes to hang
back a bit and rely on his strong
finishing drive. This is Cunliffe's
normal strategy, and worked to
perfection against Bowden last
year as he opened up a 12-yard
lead at the 660 and then held on

How the mile goes will natural
ly determine what kind of an 880
shapes up. Should the four-lap
per develop into a real blazer,
both men might be left fairly
tired and vulnerable to a loss at
the hands of Stanford's Dick Las
sen or even Jack Yerman of the
Bears, should he be thrown into
the race.
Siebert Won PCC Title
Cunliffe and Siebert met in two
principal races last year—Big
Meet and PCC championships.
The score stands 1-1, since Cun
liffe won the dual race and Sie
bert captured the conference title.
Cunliffe's victory over Don
Bowden in Big Meet marked the
first time Bowden had ever lost
an 880. Siebert was third in the
race. In PCC, Cunliffe faded to a
1:52.1, nearly two seconds off his
best, while Siebert kicked in for
a strong 1:51.0.
The outlook is for Cunliffe to
set the pace in both the mile and
880, since Siebert likes to hang
back a bit and rely on his strong
finishing drive. This is Cunliffe's
normal strategy, and worked to
perfection against Bowden last
year as he opened up a 12-yard
lead at the 660 and then held on
gamely.
Both from Small Schools
Both principals have similar
high school backgrounds — each
came from a small California
school and starred in the
880 during his senior year.
Cunliffe, from Claremont High,
hung up his best prep mark of
1:54.7 in winning the 1955 South
ern Section OF title. Bad luck
stalked him in the state meet that
year, however. Leading with only
a couple of strides to go, Cunliffe
fell, barely shy of the finish line,
and went unplaced.
Siebert was a virtual unknown
until the state meet of 1956. Run
ning for Willits High, which did
n't even have a regulation track,

Siebert upset a great field I<j win
the state title in 1:53.5.
Since Cunliffe laid out the 1957
season with an injury, both men
are only juniors in eligibility and
will bo back at each other's neck
in 1960.

Ho holds Cal hopes in iiijj
Last year ii was Bowden vs.
Lloyd; this year it's Cunliffe vs.
Siebert in ihe pair of races that
look to be thf> highlights of the
64th Big Meet Saturday in Ber
keley.
It coaches Brutus Hamilton of
California and Pay ton Jordan of
Stanford go through with plans
announced Monday, Cunliffe and
Siebert will tangle first in the
mile and then again in the 880.
Both are at their best in the
shorter race, but on the other
hand, neither has had an all-out
test in the mile as yet this year.
Cunliffe boasts the fastest col
legiate time in the nation, 1:49.9,
while Siebert has run 1:151.0. In
the mile, the Cal ace's best is
4:14.2. Cunliffe ran a 4:11.3 an
chor lap on Stanford's distance
medley team last weekend for his
top effort.
Though for the sake of time, it
might be best if Cunliffe and Sie
bert confined their efforts to the
880, point strategy in both camps
almost assuredly dictates their
also meeting in the mile.
Siebert Only Cal Miler
iSebert is Cal's only really good
miler, and the Bears need him in
there to try to break up a 1-2
Stanford finish. But Jordan has
to put Cunliffe in the four-lapper
to keep Siebert from stealing too
many points for the Bears.
In the mile, of course, the duel
will not be theirs alone. Bertil
Lundh, the Indians' soph from
Norway, will be in the field and
has as good a chance as the other
two of taking it all.
How the mile goes will natural
ly determine what kind of an 880
shapes up. Should the four-lap
per develop into a real blazer,
both men might be left fairly
tired and vulnerable to a loss at
the hands of Stanford's Dick Las
sen or even Jack Yerman of the
Bears, should he be thrown into
the race.
