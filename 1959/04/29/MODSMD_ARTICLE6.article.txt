# Spinal Elections Open Today; Rally Draws Small Attendance
## 
### 
In attempt to give students a last-minute look at the candidates in
today's and tomorrow's election, Howie Anawalt, Rich Sundeed, Walt
Juc and Rill Kartozian were presented to an audience of 250 last
night in Cubebrley Auditorium.
Sundeen, in his last campaign sxiooch, suggested better communi-

cation between student groups on
campus, i.e., a revitalization of
the ASSU Cabinet and more pr es
idential articles in The Daily. He
also suggested that student gov
ernment should concern itself
with the issues which interest
students, such as rushing, the
Fundamental Standard and the
new Union.
Told Audience
Anawalt told his audience that
student government can never
persuade the Administration to
act "at the point of a gun," but

that it can persuade and agitate.
Student government, he said,
should develop a responsible pro.
gram that deals with specific
problems, present it effectively to
the Administration, then act in
the students' behalf.
Dick Stanford, in introducing
the yell leader candidates, asked
what his audience, the spectators,
wanted in a yell leader: the side
show, polished entertainer type
of yell leader, or the play it.
straight type, patterned after the
"Vow Boys" era in Stanford
sports.
lie also indicated that it was a
shame that a good election "in
volving two hard-fighting candi
dates had to degenerate into an
election of form only. It is also a
•shame that the policies are now
overshadowed by personalities."
Yell C andidates
Walt Juc in his campaign speech
said he felt yell leading is half
serious and half-humorous—a per
son attends to watch the teams,
but also to be entertained by the
game and the yell leaders.
Bill Kartozian said he felt that
it isn't necessary for a yell leader
to be a marionette—waving his
arms in a complete circle, or jump
ing 13 feet, off the ground on one
foot. "I believe a yell leader should
lead the light yells at the right
time," he said.
Council Probe
Anawalt, in a statement issued
to The Daily yesterday, said:
"In order to activate student
discipline by students and streng
then the position of the Judicial
Councils, I recommend a complete
investigation of these councils by
a -special committee of Legisla
ture. Many judicial decisions now
made in the Dean's Office can be
brought back to the student level
if the Judicial Councils will de
velop strong stands where they
arc at present weak."
Fun Stan Topic
Sundeen made two proposals
yesterday to strengthen the Fun
damental Standard. He said:
"The Fundamental Standard, in
its present structure, has many
weaknesses. A lack of knowledge
of what constitutes a violation of
it results from its broadness of
meaning. Also, it concerns per
sonal ethics and values whose in
terpretation many limes depends
upon the specific beliefs of the in
dividual.
"One finds this lack of uniform
interpretation among lhe various
Judicial Councils. May I make two
suggestions:
Sundoen's Views
"First, make public the decisions
of the violations without disclos
ing the identity of those involved,
in order to give students exam
ples of violations and their pen
alties.
"Also, I would like to work to
ward a coordination between the
various Judicial Councils to ob
tain more of a uniformity of their
interpretations."
Referring to the ASSU Cabinet,
Anawalt said: "At present, Ihe
Cabinet lias no issues which jus
tify its meeting every week, or
even periodically at any interval.
Instead of the scheduled meetings
that it now has, I would call the
Cabinet into session only at the
start of the year and when busi
ness warranted it thereafter."
