# Married Unit Drawing Slated
## 
### 
Married students will draw for furnished apartments in the new
Escondido Village on June 3.
University officials said yesterday that drawing ceremonies will
take place at 7:30 in Memorial Hall. First of the initial 250 units will
he available Aug. 1, with the remainder becoming available later in |

August.
Applicants m u s1 be married
students who are regularly en
rolled at Stanford. In addition, a
man expecting to be married
prior to taking up residency in
the development may draw on
condition that the marriage oc
curs before the date of occupancy.
Seven Plans
Seven basic types of apart
ments will be; available two
styles each in one and three-bed
room designs, and three styles of
two-bedroom units.
Monthly rental rates will be $85
for one-bedroom, $95 for two-bed
room and $105 for three-bedroom.
These rates include furniture and
utilities. Si/.e of the apartment
allocated will be determined by
the number of children in the
student's family. Pregnancies be
yond six months will count as
one child in determining the num
ber of bedrooms.
Electric ranges and refrigera
tors will be provided in all apart
ments. Space will be available in
the two- and three-bedroom units
for washers and dryers, and oc
cupants of one • bedroom apart
ments will have use of a self-serv
ice laundry within the Village.
No Marriage Increase
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler commented that "We
don't expect that the new hous
ing will increase student mar
riages." Though more grad stu
dents here are married since pre
war days, Stanford still has a
rather small married student
population compared with other
universities, he added.
At present, nearly 20 per cent,
or approximately 1600 students,
are married. One survey indi
cates this figure may go as high
as 35 per cent in the next decade.
Though some thought was giv
en to giving priority to certain
groups, he said, this idea was
abandoned as impractical.
Drawing Alternatives
Students will be able to draw
for themselves, authorize the Uni
versity to make a proxy draw, or
arrange for a friend to draw on
June 3.
Detailed plans of the units, a
map of the Escondido Village
area, and rules of drawing and
occupancy have been mailed to
all married students. Enclosed
was a preliminary application
which must be returned to the
housing office by June 1 by stu
dents who plan to draw.
During the past few years, as
many as 750 or 1000 additional
units may be constructed.

Married students will draw for furnished apartments in the new
Escondido Village on June 3.
University officials said yesterday that drawing ceremonies will
take place at 7:30 in Memorial Hall. First of the initial 250 units will
he available Aug. 1, with the remainder becoming available later in |

August.
Applicants m u s1 be married
students who are regularly en
rolled at Stanford. In addition, a
man expecting to be married
prior to taking up residency in
the development may draw on
condition that the marriage oc
curs before the date of occupancy.
Seven Plans
Seven basic types of apart
ments will be; available two
styles each in one and three-bed
room designs, and three styles of
two-bedroom units.
Monthly rental rates will be $85
for one-bedroom, $95 for two-bed
room and $105 for three-bedroom.
These rates include furniture and
utilities. Si/.e of the apartment
allocated will be determined by
the number of children in the
student's family. Pregnancies be
yond six months will count as
one child in determining the num
ber of bedrooms.
Electric ranges and refrigera
tors will be provided in all apart
ments. Space will be available in
the two- and three-bedroom units
for washers and dryers, and oc
cupants of one • bedroom apart
ments will have use of a self-serv
ice laundry within the Village.
No Marriage Increase
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler commented that "We
don't expect that the new hous
ing will increase student mar
riages." Though more grad stu
dents here are married since pre
war days, Stanford still has a
rather small married student
population compared with other
universities, he added.
At present, nearly 20 per cent,
or approximately 1600 students,
are married. One survey indi
cates this figure may go as high
as 35 per cent in the next decade.
Though some thought was giv
en to giving priority to certain
groups, he said, this idea was
abandoned as impractical.
Drawing Alternatives
Students will be able to draw
for themselves, authorize the Uni
versity to make a proxy draw, or
arrange for a friend to draw on
June 3.
Detailed plans of the units, a
map of the Escondido Village
area, and rules of drawing and
occupancy have been mailed to
all married students. Enclosed
was a preliminary application
which must be returned to the
housing office by June 1 by stu
dents who plan to draw.
During the past few years, as
many as 750 or 1000 additional
units may be constructed.
