# Foreign Ministers' Talk Goes Well
## 
### 
PARIS (/I')- Western foreign
ministers were reported to have
hit a minor snag on military se
curity but reached large areas of
agreement Wednesday in the
opening sessions of a meeting to
unify their positions for Geneva
talks with the Soviet Union.
"We covered more ground than
we expected," said a spokesman
for U.S. Secretary of State Chris
tian A. Hcrter. "Everything went
smoothly. No major difference
developed."
Foreign ministers of the United
States, Britain, France and West
Germany are taking part in the
consultations in the French For
eign Ministry preparatory to the
East-West foreign ministers' con
ference opening at Genva May 11.
Secrecy Tag
The ministers hung a secrecy
tag on the opening sessions. But
official spokesmen and talkative
participants let out a few things
to newsmen.
The American spokesman said
the ministers had agreed to re
call the group of experts who had
drafted proposals for the Geneva
conference.
These experts, he said, will
"draw up some new language for
some sections of their over-all re
port."
He wouldn't identify the sec
tions involved, but West German
sources said they dealt largely
with the touchy issue of how
much to offer the Soviets on mili
tary security in Europe.
By and large, all four delega
tions represented themselves as
pleased with the way things went.
Nixon May Sit In
In Washington, President Ei
senhower left the way open Wed
nesday for Vice-President Rich
ard M. Nixon to sit in part time
at the prospective big power sum
mit conference.
Eisenhower said he has sug
gested the possibility that he
might require a substitute while
he comes home on business for a
few days at a time. But he said
no plans for this have been made.
Such a show of confidence in
the Vice-President, should it take
place, certainly would do nothing
to impair Nixon's prestige or his
chances of capturing the Repub
-lic a n Presidential nomination
next year.
Eisenhower didn't go into the

political implications. Ho put the
whole matter on an "iffy" basis at
his first Washington news confer
ence in five weeks.
The chief executive wasn't
ready lo discuss a site for the
summit session. To a reporter
pressing him about San Fran
cisco, the city where he received

his second-term Presidential nom
ination, Eisenhower came up with
a subdued: "Well. I always like
to go to San Francisco."
Geneva is regarded as a more
likely spot. Nixon probably would
ho required in a fill-in capacity
only if the meeting were held
abroad.

hit a minor snag on military se
curity but reached large areas of
agreement Wednesday in the
opening sessions of a meeting to
unify their positions for Geneva
talks with the Soviet Union.
"We covered more ground than
we expected," said a spokesman
for U.S. Secretary of State Chris
tian A. Hcrter. "Everything went
smoothly. No major difference
developed."
Foreign ministers of the United
States, Britain, France and West
Germany are taking part in the
consultations in the French For
eign Ministry preparatory to the
East-West foreign ministers' con
ference opening at Genva May 11.
Secrecy Tag
The ministers hung a secrecy
tag on the opening sessions. But
official spokesmen and talkative
participants let out a few things
to newsmen.
The American spokesman said
the ministers had agreed to re
call the group of experts who had
drafted proposals for the Geneva
conference.
These experts, he said, will
"draw up some new language for
some sections of their over-all re
port."
He wouldn't identify the sec
tions involved, but West German
sources said they dealt largely
with the touchy issue of how
much to offer the Soviets on mili
tary security in Europe.
By and large, all four delega
tions represented themselves as
pleased with the way things went.
Nixon May Sit In
In Washington, President Ei
senhower left the way open Wed
nesday for Vice-President Rich
ard M. Nixon to sit in part time
at the prospective big power sum
mit conference.
Eisenhower said he has sug
gested the possibility that he
might require a substitute while
he comes home on business for a
few days at a time. But he said
no plans for this have been made.
Such a show of confidence in
the Vice-President, should it take
place, certainly would do nothing
to impair Nixon's prestige or his
chances of capturing the Repub
-lic a n Presidential nomination
next year.
Eisenhower didn't go into the

political implications. Ho put the
whole matter on an "iffy" basis at
his first Washington news confer
ence in five weeks.
The chief executive wasn't
ready lo discuss a site for the
summit session. To a reporter
pressing him about San Fran
cisco, the city where he received

his second-term Presidential nom
ination, Eisenhower came up with
a subdued: "Well. I always like
to go to San Francisco."
Geneva is regarded as a more
likely spot. Nixon probably would
ho required in a fill-in capacity
only if the meeting were held
abroad.
