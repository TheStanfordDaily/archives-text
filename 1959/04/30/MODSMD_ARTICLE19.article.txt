## Macmillan Policy Less Risky 
### 
Although I do not agree with it,
the Adenauer poilcy has, I admit,
an impressive case. But the risks
of it are greater ihan those of
ihe Macmillan policy. For the
British are, 1 believe, essentially
right in wishing to recognize the
facts of life as they are, and to
regulate them Ijy a negotiated
agreement.
Orderly Evolution
The case for recognizing thai
there are two Germanys and that
there is, therefore, a special situ
ation in Berlin is this: It is our
best chance to arrange for an or
derly evolution in Germany.
II we could gel an interna
tional charter for Berlin, we
could greatly reduce the risks of
dangerous incidents caused by
misunderstanding, by the reck
lessness or carelessness of sub
ordinate officers and officials,
or by mischievous provocation.
If we could bring 1 lie two Ger
man states into a legal relation
ship with each other, there would
be a chance that the movement
toward German unity, which is
certain to grow, would be open
and visible rather than clandes
tine and conspiratorial.
Not Choosing
In weighing the two views—
which we have called roughly the
German and the British — we
must bear in mind that we are not
chousing between a divided Ger

many and a reunited Germany.
Macmillan and Adenauer and de
Gaulle and Khrushchev are
agreed in realizing that the two
Germanys are not going to be re
united. The question is whether
to recognize this situation or to
drift along without recognizing
it.
If we drift along, accepting the
fact of the partition but refusing
to recognize it, hoping to stand
pat against the evolution ol
things, we can probably manage
for a while.
When the Soviet Union or the
East German government grunts,
we can growl, and since neither
of us wants war or dares to have
a war, we may be able to keep
things as they are for a little
time to come- perhaps until all of
us have had our elections.
Temporary Standstill
But we need not try to be proud
of ourselves if this is what we do.
For what we shall have done is to
buy a temporary standstill for
ourselves at the risk that at some
later date there will be an explo
sion of the pent-up popular feel
ings which we have managed to
frustrate.
We shall be better off and we
shall feel better about it all if
we grasp the realities and do not
evade them. Then we can say to
ourselves, "Out of this nettle, dan
ger, we pluck the flower, safely."

II we could gel an interna
tional charter for Berlin, we
could greatly reduce the risks of
dangerous incidents caused by
misunderstanding, by the reck
lessness or carelessness of sub
ordinate officers and officials,
or by mischievous provocation.
If we could bring 1 lie two Ger
man states into a legal relation
ship with each other, there would
be a chance that the movement
toward German unity, which is
certain to grow, would be open
and visible rather than clandes
tine and conspiratorial.
Not Choosing
In weighing the two views—
which we have called roughly the
German and the British — we
must bear in mind that we are not
chousing between a divided Ger

many and a reunited Germany.
Macmillan and Adenauer and de
Gaulle and Khrushchev are
agreed in realizing that the two
Germanys are not going to be re
united. The question is whether
to recognize this situation or to
drift along without recognizing
it.
If we drift along, accepting the
fact of the partition but refusing
to recognize it, hoping to stand
pat against the evolution ol
things, we can probably manage
for a while.
When the Soviet Union or the
East German government grunts,
we can growl, and since neither
of us wants war or dares to have
a war, we may be able to keep
things as they are for a little
time to come- perhaps until all of
us have had our elections.
Temporary Standstill
But we need not try to be proud
of ourselves if this is what we do.
For what we shall have done is to
buy a temporary standstill for
ourselves at the risk that at some
later date there will be an explo
sion of the pent-up popular feel
ings which we have managed to
frustrate.
We shall be better off and we
shall feel better about it all if
we grasp the realities and do not
evade them. Then we can say to
ourselves, "Out of this nettle, dan
ger, we pluck the flower, safely."

Although I do not agree with it,
the Adenauer poilcy has, I admit,
an impressive case. But the risks
of it are greater ihan those of
ihe Macmillan policy. For the
British are, 1 believe, essentially
right in wishing to recognize the
facts of life as they are, and to
regulate them Ijy a negotiated
agreement.
Orderly Evolution
The case for recognizing thai
there are two Germanys and that
there is, therefore, a special situ
ation in Berlin is this: It is our
best chance to arrange for an or
derly evolution in Germany.
