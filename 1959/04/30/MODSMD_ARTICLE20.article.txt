Dogmatic Advocacy
Editor, The Daily:
I must admit that I was some
what disturbed by Mr. David
Long's letter which appeared in
The Daily regarding Dr. Will
rnoore Kendall. Having attended
several of his lectures and public
performances, 1 have consistently
been appalled by his dogmatic
(some might say bigoted) advo
cacy ul conservative political the
ory and orthodox Christianity.
While the personal holding of
somewhat outmoded views is the
light of any individual, their ad
vocacy by a scholar in our society
appears unfortunate.
Therefore, I can hardly concur
with Mr. Long in urging Ken
dall's retention by the Depart
ment of Political Science. As a
small department, it doubtless
cannot afford to retain men with
minority viewpoints, but can bet
ter serve us by presenting theo
ries which have gained accept
ance in the political science fra
ternity.
Also, the retention of one
whose views (sometimes quasi
fascist) oppose the great tradi
tion of liberty with its ideals of
freedom of thought and speech
would be a disservice to the Uni
versity community. Thus, I must
support the department's position
in the matter.

fnteilectual Concern
Kditor, The Daily:
Preliminarily, 1 dismiss the
technicalities offered as an ex
cuse for the cancellation of the
debate on private property as
trivial.
The debate on private property
would have been the first student
debate on a major issue at Stan
ford this year. The ASSU and the

lIR should have done all that was
possible to encourage it.
Occasionally our official lead
ers express official concern over
intellectual apathy. Has it oc
curred to them that intellectual
concern implies facing significant
intellectual issues? Has it oc
curred to them that socialism is
probably the significant intellec
tual issue of our time? Such
rig h 11 hi n k myopia pr ecludes
Stanford from being a university,
much less a great university.
The lIR has 57 committees and
184 subcommittees (unofficial
count) to promote international
understanding. A good part of
this formidable bureaucracy is
devoted to showing the foreign
students among us that America
is a good nation.
Presumably they sometimes
1 eli our foreign guests that there
were once Americans who died
for such ideals as freedom of
speech and thought.
I refuse to believe that our of
ficial leaders in the ASSU and
the lIR have seriously considered
the action they have taken. I
have hope that when they real
ize the tremendous importance of
the matters they are dealing with,
they will clarify their position in
a way that will announce a policy
of active support for student de
bates on significant intellectual
issues.
By way ol pruning implications
1 wish to add that I do not sup
port the outburst tacked ~p
around campus under the name
Radical Left No. 3.
Perhaps naively, I do not at
tribute the action of the ASSU
and the lIR to a plot to thwart
freedom of speech, but rather to
a blind and foolish inertia that
prevented them from cutting a
few strands of red tape for the
sake of freedom of speech.
