# SRI Begins Research in Rocket Propulsion
## 
### 
E. Finley Cartel', director of
Stanford Research Institute, an
nounced that SFJ has expanded
its research program into the
field of rocket propulsion.
"We are taking this action in
response to the growing needs
for new and improved propellants
and propulsion devices in both
space exploration and missile de

velopment programs," Car t e r
stated.
In addilion to the existing pro
pulsion systems research pro
gram in the Physical Sciences
Division, a new propulsion group
has been created within SRl's
Poulter Laboratories. This new
> group will perform basic research
in the propulsion field and will

contribute to the development of
improved rocket l'uels.
