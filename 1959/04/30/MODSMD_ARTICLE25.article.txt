## A
						Pig Grows in Berkeley 
### Elna Rodenbouse 
Because Cal's well known hu
mor magazine, the Pelican, came
under fire from the administra
tion in Berkeley recently, a few
students took upon themselves
the task of setting up a new hu
mor publication the Pickled Pig.
The Pelly had boon attacked by
the administration because it did
not conform to administration
standards. Vice-Chancellor Alex
Sherriffs commented on the fact
that all humor magazines have
their ups and downs and admitted
that the line of decency is a hard
one to draw.
"We agree with the vice-chan
cellor that 'the line of decency
is a hard one to draw,' " com
mented co-editors of the rig
Hob Kechlel and llenry Park.
"And we congratulate the Uni
versity administration on being
able to draw it."
The Pig represents, according
to the editor, a part of the general
conflict on campus between stu
dent initiative and the "constipat
ed policy of certain administra
live officials."
The Pig, in contrast to the Poli
can, is published off campus, and
is not necessarily a "student pub
lieation." The Pig went on sale
April (>, and the Pelican came out
iwo days later. Editors of the
Pitf feel free to satirize the uni
versity administration, while they
also feel that the Pelican is not
free to do so.
Student interest in whether the
administration should or should
not censor a humor magazine
rose to an all-time high, says the
Daily Californian.
Nobody, but nobody, would
want to censor the works of our
ever lovin' Chappies, would
they?
Proms arc getting passe, it ap
pears from the reactions the big
dances are getting in some of the
Middle West colleges. Northwest
ern recently canceled its big, ex
pensive junior prom, mainly be
cause nobody seems to like big,
expensive parties any more.
Said one coed: "We prefer lit
tle intimate gatherings. Ones
where we can wear either a cock
tail dress or Bermuda shorts."

A! the University of Wisconsin,
the girl who headed the IfKiU jun
ior prom recommended that next
year's class toilet ahout it. "We
lost .$1124 on the dance," she ox
plained.
The University of Illinois called
off its spring prom last year, for
much tlie same reason.
And the University of Indiana
still has a spring prom hut, ac
cording Ho a university official,
"It's still too impersonal, too ex
pensive. We have much more dif
ficulty selling tickets than we did
10 years an<»."

Then there's the University of
Washington Daily, which runs Its
entertainment column every Fri
day under the heading: TGIF.
