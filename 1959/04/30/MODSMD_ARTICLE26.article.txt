# Sweeps Not Probable In Saturday's Big Meet
## 
### 
California isn't the deepest or
best-balanced track team around,
but the Hears do have enough all
around strength to probably pre
vent Stanford from scoring any
sweeps against them Saturday in
the 1 iiMeet ;ii Berkeley.
But on lll*' oilier hand, il does
n't look like Cal controls any
(•vent to the extent of scoring a
sweep itself. And oddly enough,
the Bears may run into some of
their worst trouble in the 880 and
mile, where they have iti Jerry
Siehert one of their top four per
formers.
White ( onlil lie Tough
Willie White will probably do
more total point damage to Stan
lord than anyone else. White be
came the second Cal man to win
a Big Meet triple when he swept
the 100, 220 and low hurdles last
year. Ilc'll be back for a repeat
effort in the same events Satur
day. Though White hasn't been
really outstanding this year, his
marks of !).(>, 21.3 and 23.3 look
good enough to best the field
once again.
Cebron Buss, though nol in the
national class of While, Siehert
or Jack Yerman, could also score
heavily in three events. Buss,
however, has been laid out for
two days with tonsillitis, so may
not be up to par in the hurdles
and broad jump.
He's easily the best high stick
man in the meet, despite lacking
good build for a hurdler. In the
lows, he'll he chasing White home
and in the broad jump tangles
with John Kelly. Buss, at 25-1,
and Kelly, at 21-914, rank near
the top of PCC rankings and are
both known to be excellent com
petitors when the last jump or
two rolls around.
Yt-rman to Triple
Yerman is expected to run the
•110, 220, relay triple. He should
n't have too much trouble in the
quarter, but will be a key figure
in the place points battle in the
furlong. His relay task will prob
ably be lo catch Don Chesarek
on the anchor leg.
Yerman set what his coach Bru
tus Hamilton termed a "new Cal
record" last week when he was
disqualified in two events. He
has a season topper of 47.0 in the
quarter.
Alan Caylord and Bob Mon/in
go hook up in what could he a
meetdeciding two mile, fjaylord's
!t:ir>.r> is nearly five seconds slow
deciding two - mile. Gaylord's
!t:ir>.. r > is nearly five seconds slow
er than Monxingo's best, but
when not doubling, Caylord has
yet to he pushed in an eight-lap
per.
Wayne Crow is Cal's principal
two-even I field event threat. In
the shot, he'll probably have to
fight to hold onto a second ahead

of Cob Atkinson. But in the dis
cus, Crow is a very definite con
lender for the first place that
Armand DeVVeese is favored to
win. Crow's bests of the year arc
52-11 ''i and 161-7. •
Vi c Johnson's performance
might turn on I to bo the key to
the meet. He threw the javelin
227-1 % early in the year, hut has
regressed every week to the point
where he didn't even beat 200
feet last timeout. Stanford coun
ters with 205 21 (( footer Jim Back
strand, and I he question is wheth
er or not Johnson can solve his
approach problem sufficiently to
beat out the fairly consistent
Baekst rand.
Dailey Top High •lumper
Dick Dailey is Ihe most con
sistent of a high jump threesome
that has cleared 6-4 this year,
and should probably heal team
mate Kureal Bell and Stanford's
Paul Gillespie. Terry Kelley, a
left-handed pole - vaulter, looks
secure for five points.
And then there's the 3:14.3 Cal
relay team. With Slu Gould,
Hot I. Sieberl or Dave Epstein and
Yerman, the Bears will be very
tough for Stanford to handle. One
thing appears sure if the In
dians are going to win the relay,
they'll have to win it on the first
three legs.
