### 
II Stanford's baseball loam has
any visions of capturing I he Cali
foniia Intercollegiate Baseball
Association's second place and a
shol al NCAA playoff action, the
time lo "move in" has arrived.
This weekend the Cards have a
pair of tills with the friendly Cali
fornia Golden Hears, a hall cluh
with exactly the same dreams as
the Trihe. Tomorrow the clubs
clash in a 3:15 p.in. game at the
Sunken Diamond and Saturday
they meet at the same hour on
Cal's Edwards Field just about
when the Big Meet is ending,
liven in Losses
Although the Hears stand even
with the Cards in the important
loss column, four to four, three
of those losses have heen at the
hands of Southern California
which has been playing this sea
son as if with no intentions of
losing a game. Cal has won only
four games, hut has yet to play
dead - last UCLA, a team that
Stanford beat four times.
Cal nipped the Tribe, 7-5, Iwo
weeks ago in Berkeley to take
the early lead in the teams' sea
son sqries.
Card sophomore right • bander
Earl Russell, unbeaten in league
play and a pre season victor over
USC, is certain to get the starting
call for one of this week's games
from Coach Dutch Fehring. Pats
sell has a 3-0 CIBA mark, to
match SC's Bill Thorn and Bruce
Gardner for the loop leadership.
Solid Attack
Cal has a solid attack paced by
second baseman Roger Gregg,
All-CIBA two seasons ago. Gregg
is hitting the ball at a .400 clip
this season, second on the club to
first baseman John Balaam, who
sports a .467 mark. Coach George
Wolfman is especially wealthy at
the gateway with ex-Menlo star
Noel Barnes also available.

Barnes was one of the lop Bear
stickmen until sidelined for sev
eral weeks alter being hit in the
face with a pitched ball.
Stanford has its answer to
Barnes in captain Rich DeFabio.
The veteran right • fielder was
felled hy a Frank Sohrero pilch
against Santa Clara three weeks
ago and is now back in the line-up
with a wired-up jaw.

Sophomore second baseman
Mike Magee continues to pace the
Card order in extra base hits and
runs batted in. Magee has deliv
ered five doubles, two triples and
one home run with 14 RBI, while
staying close to the .300 circle in
average.
Jay Winter, wno looked like
the "third" catcher ;if the sea
son's start, has been the hottest
Stanford hitter of late. After
opening the season at a dismal
1-for i6 pace, Winter has been
hitting at nearly a .500 rate since
then and his .438 average tops
the Indians in conference play.
