### Bob Frank 
"I have no regrets," former Senator William F. Knowland told the
Stanford Area Young Republicans last night, "for the Republican
campaign last November."
Speaking informally following a buffet dinner at Rickey's, Know
land said he thought he had laid out the basic issues to be decided in

California "and the people de
cided."
The challenge of 'f>o appeared
lo ho agreement within ihc Re
publican party cn "what we stand
for." "Before we decide whom
we stand for, we must decide
what we will stand for."
Knowland outlined his posi
tionâ€”"solvency" on all levels of
government, restoration of ihe
two-thirds cloture on Senate de
hate, more "states' rights," less
federal aid to education because
"once money goes in, control will
inevitably follow it."
The former Senator said he did
not plan to run for public office
again, although he is not retiring
from politics.
Knowland said that, in spite of
campaign charges that he was
stuborn, he had changed his mind
when he felt that circumstances
warranted. He felt that it would
be good "both for Republicans
and Democrats" to abolish cross
filing in this state, and encour
age the parties to be responsible
and "stand on a set of issues."
Knowland said he generally
agreed with foreign policy at the
present, but that we should recog
nize the possibility that the Berlin
crisis is meant as a distraction
while the Soviets move into For
mosa, Korea, Iran or Iraq.
