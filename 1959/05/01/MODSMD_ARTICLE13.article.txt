# Freshman Advising Program Suggested
## 
### 
RECENTLY we ran across an entering-freshman advising program
used \\ illl appreciable success lor the past 20 years by Pennsyl
vania Slate I niversily.
Might alter admission prospective freshmen and their parents
go In one of the university's counseling centers, situated through
(int llit' -lale, lor a dav of testing and interviews. The student takes
some interest and personality IPsls, which are then discussed
with his previous aptitude and achievement scores in an inter
view of his parents with a university counselor. Ihe primary con
cerns are the student's career plans and liovv he may he expected
lo perform academically in comparison with oilier entering stu
dents. I lie parents discuss the results ol this session with the stu
dent, v\ho then has a similar separate interview with the counselor.
If I hero is a discrepancy in parents" and student's out
look likely lo make the first college year nunc difficult
than necessary, additional conferences are held with both
parents anil student. The freshman has follow-up con
ferences with the counselor throughout his first year.
Such a program is not as necessary for a university like Stan
ford as il is for state universities, willi higher attrition rates. !\or
is it as practical for freshmen and their parents lo attend such a
pre-entrance session at a private institution which draws its stu
dents from all over the country.
However, we feel this program contains the germ of some use
ful ideas, because it confronts the biggest adjustment of any fresh
manâ€”the redefinition of his educational relationship to his parents
when the university suddenly becomes the focal point of his edu
cational experience.
The jnost intelligent atul understanding of parents must
face, some bewilderment at this transition, different in
kind but not in intensity from our own as students. During
our freshman year their perspective is, of necessity, some
what different from our own, because of their physical
distance, because some things have, changed since they
uere in school atul because our acadennc performance
may well undergo a change over high school performance
in relative standing in the student body.
T he program also confronts the two most critical specific areas
of this mutual adjustment: plans for a future career, and expected
academic performance in college (insofar as that can be predicted.)
Such a program is not necessarily a mollycoddling of the uni
versity's freshmen. While the problems of college adjustment can
be (and frequently are) exaggerated, it is not showing any more
maturity to ignore procedures which can be of some help.
We are not suggesting that Stanford adopt this kind
of program wholesale. It would be an expensive one. It
would not be possible for many entering freshmen and
their parents to come to dalifornia for such a session. Nor
do Stanford freshmen probably need this kind of a pro
gram as much as students entering many other universi
ties: Stanford admission policies demand a relatively high
level of maturity. Never!heless, many of the difficulties
of our freshman year might be avoided or minimized by
something of this sort.
I he University makes counseling and testing available to any
student who wishes it. The University might consider, in addition,
setting up a program meeting this specific freshman need and might
explain and strongly recommend it to entering freshmen. Even if
only those prospective students already living in California were
able to take advantage of il, that would include a large percentage
of any entering class.
We suspect the primary obstacle is monetary, but the idea is
worth considering in some form, (lost would be reduced consid
erably if the program were conducted only here and in Los Angeles
instead of at a number of centers throughout the slate, and even
more so if it were conducted onlv here.
