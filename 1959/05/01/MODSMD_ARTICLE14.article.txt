Editor, The Daily:
Feeling that the Stanford coed
is becoming lax in discharging
her financial obligations, I would
like to re-inform her of the long

established tradition of going
Dutch treal on overnights, i.e.,
Big Game overnights and spring
overnights. In comparison with
the Stanford man's social ex
penses, this is asking very little.
