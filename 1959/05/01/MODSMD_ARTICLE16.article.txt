Argentina's need for American
â€¢apital investment is emphasized
by I)i'. Rogelop Frigerio, chief ec
onomic advisor to President Fron
dizi.
Frigerio spoke to (he Hispanic
American Society yesterday on the
need to develop basic industries
in oil, steel, coal and cellulose,
which Argentina is now import
ing.
Frigerio outlined his economic
policy. He then answered ques
tions on guarantees to foreign
businesses, policy of land expro
priations and the austerity pro
gram causing strikes for the past
three months.
The Delegation
The delegation with Frigerio in
cluded Cesar Barros llurtado, Ar
gentine ambassador to the United
States, and Arturo Sabato, presi
dent ot the Argentine government
oil monopoly, YPF.
The group met with the edito
rial staff of the Hispanic Ameri
can Report in ihe morning.
A tour of the campus and a
luncheon at the Union were fol
lowed by a meeting with the His
panic American Society and a
group of business executives from
the Bay Area. Professor Ronald
Hilton, director of Hispanic Amer
ican studies, hosted the afternoon
session at his campus home.
Must Catch Up
Latin America is underdevelop
ed, Frigerio said, and must, try to
catch up with the United States.
To do this, basic industries must
be developed. Because local busi
nesses don't have sufficient capi
tal, foreign investors are being en
couraged by the Frondizi govern
ment.
The unstable economy results

from the unfavorable balance of
trade. Argentina has been im
porting oil, steel and coal, spend
ing dollars needed lo buy equip
ment to exploit these resources.
The government has promised
American investors that they can
bring in capital goods tax-free.
These include essentia] equipment
to be used in the basic industries,
but not automobiles. There would
be no favoritism shown to Argen
tine investors, Frigerio said, and
no businesses would be slopped
from sending back earnings to
their country.
President Frondizi's austerity
program put rigid controls on
wages and removed pr ice controls.
The workers' purchasing power 1
fell and strikes resulted, but this
was necessary to help ihe ex
change situation.
The consumer suffered at first,

though less than was exported.
However, us prices found their
level with the demand, the stand
ard of living rose, and the workers
got a heller share of the national
economy.
With the purchasing power ol
wage labor down temporarily, a
surplus i)l exports will be built up.
This should level the balance ol
trade, Frigerio said.
The government is discouraging
the provinces (states) from ex
propriating land. Money would be
taken from the national budget to
pay for I his land, which should be
used in industry development.
< ompliments sici
Frigerio complimented the Uni
versity and Stanford Research In
stitute on working in economic
theory with efficient practice. A
contract was awarded yesterday to
SRI to prepare a study of the Ar
gentine economy. A report, to be
gin in May. will be sent to that
government.
President Frondizi's government
has inherited ex-dictator Peron's
problems and is following many
of his basic policies. However,
Peron didn't carry out the steel
industry plan efficiently, Frigerio
said.
Argentina is now at the point
where economic policy can be
planned with technical knowledge
rather than emotionalism.
