Vagueness |
Ktlitor, The Daily:
" 'Ma jor Barbara' Cenerally
Poor" unfortunately this is 1 ho
kind ol title to ho expected l'rom
a Stanford Daily review of al
most any event in the art world.
Pathetically endeavoring to as
sume some preconceived idea of
the modern, blase drama critic,
Clinton continues the careless use
of self protecting vagueness in
troduced in the title.
By attacking the "Insubstantial
plot" and by decrying Shaw's
"general proclivity for lecturing
his audience," the writer illus
(rates the attitude referred to by
Shaw when he remarked: . .
from liie stalls and in the Press
hi atmosphere of hypocrisy
arises . .
(Criticism of drama amounts |
to a paraphrase of the following
idea:) "1 cannot associate pleas
ure with any sort of intellectual
activity." If Clinton had been fa
milial- enough with the Shavian
concept of socio • philosophical
drama he might have understood
the purpose of the play.
The fact that he did not under- !
stand is emphasized when he i
.•omplains of the playwright's;
"inadequate characterization," i
Characterization is doubtlessly
one of the outstanding virtues of

the play, for it pvidenees Shaw's
keen perception of human types.
