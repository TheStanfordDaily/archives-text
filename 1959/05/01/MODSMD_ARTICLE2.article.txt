# No Word on New Atom Smasher
## Ike Endorses Stanford Plan 
### Jack Clumeck 
A University spokesman stated
yesterday that neither official
nor unofficial notification had
come from Washington regard
ing President Eisenhower's an
nounced decision of government
support for Stanford's proposed
two-mile-long linear accelerator.
The President told a press con
ference that his advisers had rec
ommended the two-year-old pro
posal to construct the world's
most powerful atom smasher
through the campus foothills.
Eisenhower said that the $110.-
000,000 "Project M" linear accel
erator will he"the most extraor
dinary thing of its kind yet at
tempted. When put into opera
lion about five .years from now it
will place the United States far
ahead of Russia in this tech
nique."
Proposed Site
The proposed site for the ac
celerator is 410 acres of land
running in an east to west direc
tion for two miles from the Stan
ford golf course and under Page
Mill Road.
In a report of plans for Proj
ect M. nicknamed "The Monster,"
Dr. L. I. Schiff, executive head
of Stanford's physics department,
told the Stanford Alumni Confer
ence in April of last year that the
accelerator will be rated at 45 bil
lion electron volts (45 BEV).
The new electron accelerator is
a greatly enlarged version of the
present 220-foot-long Mark 111 ac
celerator currently in campus op
eration at a maximum rate of
700,000,000 electron volts (700
MEV). Dr. Schiff explained, "In
essence, Project M would be 50
Mark 111 accelerators placed end
to ewi."
"(Complete (Confidence"
He continued, "There is noth
ing essentially new from an en
gineering point of view, and so
we have complete confidence that
it will work." Anticipated annual
cost (if the project is $15 million.
The accelerator itself will con
sist of a metal tube about four
inches in diameter with metal
discs spaced an inch apart with a
one-inch hole in the center. In
side the tube, an electromagnetic
fielrl is arranged to accelerate the
electrons continually in one direc
tion. They increase in speed and
energy until they are traveling
with almost the speed of light
(186,281 miles per second).
For Detailed Study
The purpose of the increased
energy was explained by Dr.!
Schiff as expecting "to sec finer
details of the structure of matter
than ever before." lie continued,
"We hope to conclude new varie
ties of |sub-atomic| particles and
study their behavior."
Because the speeding electrons
must be shielded for radiation
protection, the accelerator is
planned to be housed in a tunnel
35 feet underground, 10 feet wide
and 13 feet high. The 1000 Klys
tron tubes, which generate the
electromagnetic field, would be
placed in an adjacent and parallel
tunnel 21 feet wide and 22 feet
high. For safety purposes, the
two tunnels would be separated â– 
by 35 feet of earth, and would
be connected by cross - tunnels I
from the klystrons to the accel-j
erator tube.
