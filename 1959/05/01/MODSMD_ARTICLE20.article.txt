# Beware Bears: Big Weekend Is Here
## Bears the Narrow Favorite In Close, Close Big Meet DAILY Sports SCENE 
### Dick Barnes 
Big Mod fcvor roaches a climax at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow when Stan
ford and California tangle for the 64th time.
The Edwards Stadium encounter finds the Bears slightly favored,
hut by no means out of reach of Payton Jordan's Indians. Jordan
has yd to win a Big Moot since asuming the Stanford reins two

I years ago. But the Cards have
| won 32 of the clashes since the
j series began in 1893, and have
gained ties in two others.
Virtually every event can be
considered a key to determining
the final team winner. Each squad
has perhaps 50 fairly sure points
I going into the meet but it takes
66 to win.
880, Mile Are Keys
The most exciting races of the
j day are the mile and the 880. The
; principals are Ernie Cunliffe and
Jerry Siebert in both races, Bertil
Lundh in the mile and Dick Las
sen in the half.
At least Cunliffe and Siebert
I are SUPPOSED to go in both. But
j with Jordan and Brutus Hamilton
i scrambling for every possible frac
tion of a point, there's little telling
what entry changes might take
place at the last second.
Assuming all goes well, how
ever, Cunliffe, America's leading
collegiate half-miler, will face an
outstanding foe in Siebert, the de
fending PCC 880 champ. Each has
also gone up to the mile this sea
son, but neither has been pressed
really hard in a four-lapper.
White Seeks Triple
Be si de s the Cunliffe-Siebert
duels, the meet will feature Willie
White's bid for a second straight
Big Meet triple and the outstand
ing broad-jumping of John Kelly
and Cebron Russ.
While won the 100, Ihe 200 and
the low hurdles last year, and he
should repeat. Kelly and Russ
rank as two of the three top jump
ers in ihe conference, and each
has a habit of winning on his last
leap.
If Stanford is to win, il would
need to break up Cal domination
of the sprints. For this the In
dians will rely on Norm Pease and
Dean Smith. The Bears, to win,
i will need top performances by Vie
John-son in the javelin. Wayne
Crow in the shot and the discus,
and Alan Gaylord in his two mile
fight with Bob Mon/ingo plus a
good flay by Siebert.
Chesarek Vs. Yernian?
Should the meet come down to
ihe relay, the latter itself would
j come down to an anchor leg strug-
I gle between Don Chesarek and
Jack Yerman. Chesarek would
need a substantial lead to hold off
the faster Cal junior, and Stan-
I ford would be handicapped from
a pace standpoint by having to
j lead through most of the race if it
t is to win.
Four meet records are in spe
i cial danger. Cunliffe and Siebert
I should better the 1:50 mark in the
! half, and Yerman should improve
1 his own standard in the 440. Three
j men are under the 9:18.1 two-mile
! mark, and Jerry Winters has been
more than a foot past the shot-put
j record of 55-B'2.
Objectively, the meet looks this
way:
Mile Lundh S. Cunliffe S, Sie
' bert C. 440 Yerman C, Chesarek
