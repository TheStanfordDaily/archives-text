# Lindeman, Russell Get Calls To Face Second-Place Rival
## 
### 
Sophomores Terry Lindeman and Karl Russell are the pitching
•hoices as the Stanford baseball team goes into two Big (in more
ways than one) Games with the cross-bay boys from the University
of California. Today, the teams clash at the Sunken Diamond; to
morrow, in Berkeley. Both games are set for 3:15 p.m.

The Indians and Bears go into
the games with eyes on the
prized second place of the Califor
nia Intercollegiate Baseball Asso
ciation. A double victory for
Stanford would give the Tribe an
8-4 record with only four league
games left.
Russell Unbeaten
Left-hander Lindeman, today's
mound choice of Coach Dutch
Fehring, lost to the Bears two
weeks ago at Cal, 7-5. Russell, a
right-hander, has yet to lose in
CIBA play.
In an effort to stock the lineup
with left-handed punch, Fehring
has inserted sophomore Lee
Moench into the lineup along
with captain Rich DeFabio,
Moench will start in right field
with DeFabio in center and lead
ing hitter Art von Wronski in
left.
Moench has been one of the
Tribe's hottest hitlers of late. He
sat out most of last week's three
game action because the Indians
saw nothing but left-handers. Cal,
on the other hand, has nothing
but eighties.
Veterans Ted Settle and Kirn
F3ll ioll will be on the hill for the
Bears.
Barnes Returns
Noel Barnes, former Palo Alio
prep and Menlo JC star, has re
turned at first base to add power
to the Cal hitting attack. Barnes
was sidelined for several weeks
after suffering a broken nose
and crushed cheek bone when hit
by a pitch. His return complete
with face mask will move John
Balaam to the outfield. Baalam
has stalled league play with a
bang, as his .167 batting average
lops the Bears and is second in
the league.
Spark of Ihe Bear nine for Ihe
past three seasons has been sec
ond baseman Roger Gregg. Also
off to a good start in CIBA play,
he is hitting at a .400 clip.

Sophomores Terry Lindeman and Karl Russell are the pitching
•hoices as the Stanford baseball team goes into two Big (in more
ways than one) Games with the cross-bay boys from the University
of California. Today, the teams clash at the Sunken Diamond; to
morrow, in Berkeley. Both games are set for 3:15 p.m.

The Indians and Bears go into
the games with eyes on the
prized second place of the Califor
nia Intercollegiate Baseball Asso
ciation. A double victory for
Stanford would give the Tribe an
8-4 record with only four league
games left.
Russell Unbeaten
Left-hander Lindeman, today's
mound choice of Coach Dutch
Fehring, lost to the Bears two
weeks ago at Cal, 7-5. Russell, a
right-hander, has yet to lose in
CIBA play.
In an effort to stock the lineup
with left-handed punch, Fehring
has inserted sophomore Lee
Moench into the lineup along
with captain Rich DeFabio,
Moench will start in right field
with DeFabio in center and lead
ing hitter Art von Wronski in
left.
Moench has been one of the
Tribe's hottest hitlers of late. He
sat out most of last week's three
game action because the Indians
saw nothing but left-handers. Cal,
on the other hand, has nothing
but eighties.
Veterans Ted Settle and Kirn
F3ll ioll will be on the hill for the
Bears.
Barnes Returns
Noel Barnes, former Palo Alio
prep and Menlo JC star, has re
turned at first base to add power
to the Cal hitting attack. Barnes
was sidelined for several weeks
after suffering a broken nose
and crushed cheek bone when hit
by a pitch. His return complete
with face mask will move John
Balaam to the outfield. Baalam
has stalled league play with a
bang, as his .167 batting average
lops the Bears and is second in
the league.
Spark of Ihe Bear nine for Ihe
past three seasons has been sec
ond baseman Roger Gregg. Also
off to a good start in CIBA play,
he is hitting at a .400 clip.
