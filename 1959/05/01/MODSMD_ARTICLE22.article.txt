# Card Frosh End Season On Cal Track
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman track
squad will close out its season I
4 |
tomorrow at Cal's Edwards Field
against the Bear frosh. The meet,
to he held in conjunction with
the varsity meet, will begin at 1
p.m.
The top man on the Cal squad j
is miler Woody Covington. Cov-;
ington has turned in a top time
of '1:20 and should give the Stan
ford entries, John Northway and
Kim Maxwell, a rugged race.
In the field events it looks as
though Ihe Papooses' contestants
may have to provide their own
competition. For instance a 5-10
leap may easily win the high
jump.
Papoose record - breaking dis
cus thrower Don Bell, who broke
Bob Mai bias' frosh discus record
last week with a heave of 157-s'!â€¢,
shouldn't lie pushed by anyone
on the Cal squad, as a 140-foot
loss has been sufficient to win
every Cal frosh meet to date.
Dan Moore will be out for a
final try at Brooks Townsend's
frosh broad jump record and here
100 he will be all alone. Moore
was 16 short of Townsend's 23-
10 1 u record last week, whereas
Cal's jumpers have been under 21
feel all year.
Rich Klior, si ill out lo break
the 1:54.5 SBO record he tied car
liei this season, may have to do
il all himself, 100. Covington, at
2:01 .8, led ('nit half-miters last I
week.
