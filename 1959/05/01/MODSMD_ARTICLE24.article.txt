# Card Netters Host Cal Seeking Second Shutout
## 
### 
May 1956 was the last time that
a California tennis team defeated
Coach Bob Honker's Stanford
netters, and it looks likely that
Stanford's dominance over the
Bear tennismen will continue
when the two teams meet at the
Card courts tomorrow at 1 p.m.
Since 1956 the Indians have
racked up five successive tri
umphs over California and Ihe 9-0

win Ihe Cards recorded two
weeks ago was the biggest vic
tory in the string.
Nelson Buck
The April 18 Card victory came
when the Cards were minus their
captain and ace Dave Nelson.
The Indians, who have won six
of seven college dual matches
this year, will line up with Nelson
I playing at first singles, sopho
i more Dick Ogdon at number two,
I Lowell Carruth at three, Brooks
Rawlins at four, Jim Jeffries at
five and Dick Gould at six.
Cal's lineup will probably con
sist of Art Kono on top. Warren
Sisson second, Bob Jones third,
Norman Slornann fourth, Jim
Holstrom fifth and Paul Cohen
sixth.
The only California possibility
in the match seems to be their
second doubles team of Kent
Newmark and Henry Kuechler.
The two were the only Bears to
win a set in the first Cal-Stan
ford match.
Frosli Teams Meet
At 10 a.m. the Cal Cubs and
Stanford Papooses will meet for
their second match of Ihe season.
Earlier this year the Cubs took a
9-0 win.
Bill Hoogs and Mike Farrell,
the top Cal freshman tennis play
ers, seem untouchable as far as
Stanford is concerned. Last time
Hoogs and Farrell faced Ihe Pa
pooses both won easy straight
set triumphs over Lorie Chicker
ing and George Corfino.
Chickering and Corfino will
again be first and second for
Stanford wilh Tim Arnstoin,
! Geoff White, Walt Prime, Chuck
Goodwin, Yell Newhall, Bill Mid
kiff. Jim Goldstein and Pete Win-
I stead all figuring in the lineup.

of seven college dual matches
this year, will line up with Nelson
I playing at first singles, sopho
i more Dick Ogdon at number two,
I Lowell Carruth at three, Brooks
Rawlins at four, Jim Jeffries at
five and Dick Gould at six.
Cal's lineup will probably con
sist of Art Kono on top. Warren
Sisson second, Bob Jones third,
Norman Slornann fourth, Jim
Holstrom fifth and Paul Cohen
sixth.
The only California possibility
in the match seems to be their
second doubles team of Kent
Newmark and Henry Kuechler.
The two were the only Bears to
win a set in the first Cal-Stan
ford match.
Frosli Teams Meet
At 10 a.m. the Cal Cubs and
Stanford Papooses will meet for
their second match of Ihe season.
Earlier this year the Cubs took a
9-0 win.
Bill Hoogs and Mike Farrell,
the top Cal freshman tennis play
ers, seem untouchable as far as
Stanford is concerned. Last time
Hoogs and Farrell faced Ihe Pa
pooses both won easy straight
set triumphs over Lorie Chicker
ing and George Corfino.
Chickering and Corfino will
again be first and second for
Stanford wilh Tim Arnstoin,
! Geoff White, Walt Prime, Chuck
Goodwin, Yell Newhall, Bill Mid
kiff. Jim Goldstein and Pete Win-
I stead all figuring in the lineup.
May 1956 was the last time that
a California tennis team defeated
Coach Bob Honker's Stanford
netters, and it looks likely that
Stanford's dominance over the
Bear tennismen will continue
when the two teams meet at the
Card courts tomorrow at 1 p.m.
Since 1956 the Indians have
racked up five successive tri
umphs over California and Ihe 9-0

win Ihe Cards recorded two
weeks ago was the biggest vic
tory in the string.
Nelson Buck
The April 18 Card victory came
when the Cards were minus their
captain and ace Dave Nelson.
The Indians, who have won six
of seven college dual matches
this year, will line up with Nelson
I playing at first singles, sopho
i more Dick Ogdon at number two,
I Lowell Carruth at three, Brooks
Rawlins at four, Jim Jeffries at
five and Dick Gould at six.
