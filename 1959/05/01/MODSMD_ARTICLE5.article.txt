# It's Big Weekend, Too
## 
### 
Big Weekend is here.
Granted, it's not exactly like Big Game (football Big Game),
but if you like sports and like to see Stanford play California, then
it's a Big Weekend. And Stanford usually wins the spring sports
Big Weekends.
The agenda: at Stanford, varsity baseball today, varsity and
freshman golf and tennis tomorrow. At Berkeley, varsity and
freshman track, and varsity, junior varsity and freshman baseball
tomorrow.
For track and baseball, this is a big weekend in more ways than
one. The traekstcrs will be seeking their first win over Cal since
1956 in what promises to be one of the closest-ever Big Meets. For
baseball, two victories might mean a shot at the NCAA playoffs.
See sports for details.
