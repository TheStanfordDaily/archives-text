## Legislature Supports Bohn Action 
### Barbara Hicks Associate Editor 
ASSU President John Bohn's
action in canceling the Stanford
Loft sponsored debate Monday
night was given unanimous ap
proval by the Legislature last
night at Bowman Alumni House.
"I" Club President George Guy
told the Legislature he ques
tioned the authority of the ASSU
president to take such action, but
ho agreed that arrangements for
the debate had not completely
complied with the ASSU Consti
tution. He agreed that use of
"Stanford," unless authorized by
the Legislature, was against the
Constitution, but he asked for a
clarification of the powers of the
office of president.
Guy said the group has asked
Men's Council to rule on the case,
adding that they expect to pre
sent a constitution to the Legis
lature in compliance with the
regulations.
Out of Focus
Saying that, the issue had
blown out of perspective and
that the group did not comply
with the rules which govern 200
organizations on campus, Larry
Kelley, ASSU Financial Manager,
said the issue had nothing to do
with freedom of speech. Guy re
plied that freedom of speech was
affected, regardless of the mo
tives.
Bob Soli, graduate representa
tive, held that the Constitution
must be complied with and
moved that the Legislature ap
prove Bohn's action.
Arden Shenker, lIR president,
apologized for any organ of the
lIR which "has rendered a dis
courtesy to the ASSU president."
Shenker added that it was ap
parently a misunderstanding of
the English language which
caused the difficulty. Guy had
earlier said that he was confused
by Bohn's saying the debate
"would be canceled" instead of
it. "was canceled."

In other discussion John Nick
erson, ICC-Toyon representative,
presented the report of the rush
ing procedure investigating com
mittee. Nickerson said the Legis
lature, by the Constitution, had
authority to deal with the prob
lem but he termed the proposals
resulting from the report as "in
effectual."
The Legislature also heard a
report from Leo Krulitz, Daily
editor, that the Scratch Sheet be
established under one of the ex
isting publications, with a sepa
rate but related staff. The report,
co-authored by Mrs. Margaret
Clark, Education School, suggest
ed either Sequoia or The Daily as
the foster parents for the Scratch
Sheet. Discussion was postponed.
The Social Coordinating Board
ceased to exist when the Legisla
ture approved by-laws changes
deleting the section on the board,
delegating duties to the vice-pres
ident and revising the wording
in the present regulation.
