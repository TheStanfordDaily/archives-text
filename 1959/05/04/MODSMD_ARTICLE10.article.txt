# Ram's Head's 'Joey' Opens Wednesday
## 
### 
Featuring a cast of 40 members
plus a complete orchestra, "Pal
Joey" will open its four-night run
this Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium.
The Rodgers and Hart musical
play is based on a book by John
O'Hara and became the longest
running revived play in Broadway
history when it was produced in
1952, after having flopped some
years before.
The Ram's Head production has
a $5,000-plus budget, which in
cludes a $3,500 chandelier used in
"Gone With the Wind," a func
tional fountain and a pair of gold
lame stage curtains borrowed
from the Dunes night club in Las
Vegas.
The lyrics, which include the
familiar "Bewitched, Bothered and
Bewildered," have been augment
ed with two tunes not in the origi
nal show â€”"The Lady Is a Tramp"
and "You Took Advantage of Me."
Seven lavish night-club perform
ance numbers will highlight the
production, featuring a dancing
chorus of 12 girls who have six
different cost u m c changes to
make.
Dick Lamb, a junior from Ash
land, Ore., directs the show and
plays Joey, a night-club hoofer,
around whom the story revolves.
Ticket sales for the show con
tinue this week on Quad and at
Memorial Auditorium box office.
