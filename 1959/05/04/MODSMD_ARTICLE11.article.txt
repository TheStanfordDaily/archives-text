# Indian Nine Whips Cal Twice
## Edges Toward NCAA Playoffs 
### Dave Dow 
Not an earthquake, hut—a good*
sized "explosion" rocked the Bay
Area the past week end as Stan
ford bats detonated for 28 base
hits and a pair of baseball vic
tories over the University of Cali
fornia. 10-3 and 15-6.
And cmll of the rubble a hard
fighting btuvh of Indians walked
away, apparently destined for the
NCAA play-offs. Dutch FehHng's
crew needs three more victories to
cinch coveted second place in the
CIBA standings, and two more to
be assured of a tie. That's assum
ing either Cal or Santa Clara
currently tied for third with 4-6
marks wins all of its remaining
games. Nobody worries much
about USC, who appears to be
riding for an undefeated season.
The Trojans are ineligible for
playoff competition.

ANOTHKK STANFORD TALLY AGAIXST CAL '
Mayee squeezes home DeFabio with a peri'eet bunt
umph to Ihe wall. Toss in some
sharp relief pitching by Warren
Nelson and Roy Lawson, and
you've got the story.
Nelson was credited with Ihe
wins in both games as he relieved
Marv Mecklenburg in the seventh
inning of Saturday's game, throt
tled a Bear uprising and rode
home on Stanford's biggest inning
of the year an eight-run eruption
in the eiglilh inning.
The Cardinals sent 14 men lo
the plate in that inning. Eight
ba'se hits were registered, includ-1
ing two each by second baseman
Mike Magee and third - baseman j
Jim Burk.
Awakening of Potential
To name stand-outs in the week- 1
end action is a long job. Let's just
say it was Stanford's awakening
awakening of a lot of potential
that hadn't fully materialized this
season.
However, Magee definitely
looms ;is a stand-out on the basis J
of his play around second base, j
Magee, a catcher until this year, is
handling the bag better every
game. He teamed up with Burk

and Newkirk for four rally-stifling
double plays in Friday's game. On
Saturday he banged out four hits.
Stanford draws a bye in CIBA
play this week before meeting
Santa Clara a week from Tuesday.
