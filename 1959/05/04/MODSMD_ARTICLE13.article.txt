# Prom Enjoyed
## 
### 
Although the primary goal of attendance at a university in con
cerned with academic pursuits, and although The Daily usually
directs its attention to this area, there comes a time when "just
plain fun*' deserves comment and commendation.
The junior class knew what it was about when it arranged
last Friday's Junior Prom. A general atmosphere of enjoyment
prevailed at the St. Francis Hotel when almost 500 couples gath
ered for the music of Hilly May's hand and the intermission
entertainment of Stan Wilson.
We have observed in the past that there are not enough all
campus social functions, hut it is doubtful that any quantity could
meet tlie quality of this year's prom.
To Mike Immell, as president of the junior class, we give our
thanks for making possible a thoroughly enjoyable evening.
