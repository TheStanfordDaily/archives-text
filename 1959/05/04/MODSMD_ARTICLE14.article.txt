## President's Role In a University 
### Diana Smith Managing Editor 
We pass along for your consid
eration some remarks by Harold
Taylor, president of Sarah Law
rence College, made in an April
12 ' New York Times Magazine"
article:
The college president of pre
vious generations was an edu
cator, a scholar, often a clergy
man, a teacher â€”a man who
symbolized as well as adminis
tered a community of scholars.
He read a great deal, he spoke
often to his students and fac
ulty, at chapel, at daily or
weekly college assemblies, on
questions of moral and intellec
tual substance. He expressed
in his person and in his daily
work the results of learning
and the experience of serious
thought. At his best he was
both a man of thought and a
man of action, one who devoted
himself to making real the life
of the mind.
The college president of the
second half of the century is
not this. He is called upon to
administer an organization that
directs, among other things, a
real estate development, a pub
lic relations program, a fund
raising and financial appara
tus, and a community ranging
from 500 to 40,000 in size
lodged in a chain of small ho
tels. He is more like the fnayor
of a small town than an intel
lectual leader, more like the ex
ecutive of a business corpora
tion than an educator.
Most university and college
presidents are themselves
alarmed by these developments.
Taylor goes on to explain that
the situation has come about with
an enormously expanding educa
tional task, compounded by lack
of funds for such expansion. The
results, he says, are an emphasis
on the structure of our higher
education rather than its substan
tive quality, and an unhappy and
widening gulf between the presi
dent (and the whole administra
tive staff) and the faculty and
students.
Way Suggested
We have heard this before. But
President Taylor goes on to sug
gest a way in which financial
pressures, at least, might be lift
ed from the college president:
making the Board of Trustees re
sponsible for the financial and

fund-raising needs of the univer
sity. Trustees of course have
personal and professional com
mitments as well as their univer
sity duties (few of us as Stanford
undergraduates are sufficiently
aware of our trustees' invaluable
and frequently thankless serv
ice).
Taylor thus suggests that the
presidency of a university board
of trustees ought to be a full
time job: it requires at least the
time and ability of a chairman
of the board of a corporation.
President Not a Liaison
Within the university, Taylor
suggests that the liaison with the
board of trustees and its presi
dent on financial affairs be the
provost or university president's
assistants, instead of making the
university president himself the
financial and everyother-kind-of
liaison, and forcing him because
of the more pressing immediacy
of financial problems to delegate
many educational matters to
deans and assistants.
Once the most urgent financial
cares were lifted from the univer
sity president (most urgent in
that it takes money to accomplish
most educational growth) he
would be freer to think about
how to become less an adminis
trator and more an educator.
Stanford Subject
Stanford is not as subject to
the ills Taylor describes as many
other colleges and universities,
we are happy to note. It is also
aware of them. Nevertheless, the
problem exists here.
We realize that the isolation of
the modern university president
from his university, and the di
version of some of his attention
from the substance of education
to its administration and financ
ing, is to some extent inevitable
with the expansion of university
education we are experiencing.
But we are not willing to yield
to these pressures at the expense
of learning, any more than is ab
solutely necessary.
Perhaps there are more flaws
in President Taylor's argument
than our initial critical examina
tion has perceived. Nevertheless
we present it as an example of
the kind of hardheaded and im
aginative thinking that can grap
ple effectively with this prob
lem, and for whatever merit it
may have for Stanford's own sit
uation.
