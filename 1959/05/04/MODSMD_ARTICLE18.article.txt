Barbarian Attitude
Editor, The Daily:
As long as you, Northerners
and Westerners, refuse to have
any Negro family live next door,
you cannot expect your Congress
to pass any REAL civil rights leg
islation. The majority of Con
gress represents a majority of
discriminating Americans.
Keeping your own neighbor
hood white and lynching a (pos
sibly innocent) young Negro are
both symptoms of a basically
identical, barbarian attitude. The
difference is one of degree, not
of essence.
Stanford's students may wash
their hands in Pilate's fashion
and forget or disregard a Mack
Parker "incident" — people out
side "Cod's own country" [sic]
will remember.
The world at large can only be
suspicious of our type of democ
racy, our professed great free
doms, and the apparent readiness
and willingness to fight for them.
Tomorrow the vulgar Ameri
can press will find another head
line, preferably a more comfor
table one; American diplomats
and vacationists (white) will go
on wondering why they are not
better liked abroad despite their
tourist dollars and billions of for
eign aid.

Hammer and Sickle
Editor, The Daily:
It is very unfortunate to see
that Mr. Haas in his article in
the April 28 Daily had marched
one step forward in his race with
the Time magazine in saying that
the hammer and sic kle have prob
ably gone up over Iraq for good.
If we exclude the title and the
two points which 1 am going to
discuss below, it is very fair then

to say that the lIR political anal
ysis is really not analysis but
mere reproduction of an article
written by the military editor of
the New York Times on April 21,
1959. The Daily 1 think could
have done much better in publish
ing the original article.
However Mr. Haas said that
the People's Court in Mosul exe
cuted 300 men from the Sham
mer tribe. This is not true be
cause the only People's Court is
in Baghdad and it did not pass
any sentence like that. Those
who were killed were engaged in
actual fighting at the side of
Shawaf against the government
forces.
Moreover Mr. Haas thinks that
the action by the government to
arm the PRF has been taken in
response to a demand by the sec
retary of the Iraqi CP. Nothing
can be farther from the truth
than this conclusion, an A I think
if the 11R took the pains to pro
vide Mr. Haas with the Iraqi
newspapers he could have avoid
ed such a naive interpretation.
Arming the PRF was a persistent
demand by the people long before
the Shawaf mutiny took place on
March 9, 1959.
It is, I think, extremely unfair
to write about any country and
pass value judgments in such a
respectable institution as Stan
ford without at least bothering
oneself to read what the people
of that country write about their
own country.

It is very unfortunate to see
that Mr. Haas in his article in
the April 28 Daily had marched
one step forward in his race with
the Time magazine in saying that
the hammer and sic kle have prob
ably gone up over Iraq for good.
If we exclude the title and the
two points which 1 am going to
discuss below, it is very fair then

to say that the lIR political anal
ysis is really not analysis but
mere reproduction of an article
written by the military editor of
the New York Times on April 21,
1959. The Daily 1 think could
have done much better in publish
ing the original article.
However Mr. Haas said that
the People's Court in Mosul exe
cuted 300 men from the Sham
mer tribe. This is not true be
cause the only People's Court is
in Baghdad and it did not pass
any sentence like that. Those
who were killed were engaged in
actual fighting at the side of
Shawaf against the government
forces.
Moreover Mr. Haas thinks that
the action by the government to
arm the PRF has been taken in
response to a demand by the sec
retary of the Iraqi CP. Nothing
can be farther from the truth
than this conclusion, an A I think
if the 11R took the pains to pro
vide Mr. Haas with the Iraqi
newspapers he could have avoid
ed such a naive interpretation.
Arming the PRF was a persistent
demand by the people long before
the Shawaf mutiny took place on
March 9, 1959.
It is, I think, extremely unfair
to write about any country and
pass value judgments in such a
respectable institution as Stan
ford without at least bothering
oneself to read what the people
of that country write about their
own country.

As long as you, Northerners
and Westerners, refuse to have
any Negro family live next door,
you cannot expect your Congress
to pass any REAL civil rights leg
islation. The majority of Con
gress represents a majority of
discriminating Americans.
Keeping your own neighbor
hood white and lynching a (pos
sibly innocent) young Negro are
both symptoms of a basically
identical, barbarian attitude. The
difference is one of degree, not
of essence.
Stanford's students may wash
their hands in Pilate's fashion
and forget or disregard a Mack
Parker "incident" — people out
side "Cod's own country" [sic]
will remember.
The world at large can only be
suspicious of our type of democ
racy, our professed great free
doms, and the apparent readiness
and willingness to fight for them.
Tomorrow the vulgar Ameri
can press will find another head
line, preferably a more comfor
table one; American diplomats
and vacationists (white) will go
on wondering why they are not
better liked abroad despite their
tourist dollars and billions of for
