# Cards Win 8 of 10 'Big' Ones
## Cal Beats Tribe Spikers With Big Closing Flurry 
### Dick Barnes 
Stanford looked like a Big Meet winner for 10 events, led Cal for
11, and then collapsed with a grand thud that left the Indians on
the unpleasant end of a 78-53 score Saturday at Berkeley.
What was expected to be among the closest of the 64 Big Meets
was precisely that until the 11-event point, when the Cards led, 50-49.

Bui Ernie Cunliffe's loss in the
880 was apparently a portent ol'
tilings to come, because Stanford
went from bad to worse and man
aged only three thirds in the clos
ing four events of the day.
Early come-throughs by John
Kelly, Dave Merchant, Bob Mar
tin and A in i a rid DeWeese had
(nit the Indians in good shape
for :ui upset but the late losses
wiped out early gains and far
more as Cal won its 301 h in the
series and third in a row over
Paylon Jordan.
The race of the day, Cunliffe
vs. Jerry Siebert in the 880, fol
lowed unexpected channels. Bru
tus Hamilton held Siebert out of
the mile, and it looked as though
Jordan would keep Cunliffe out
as well. But Stanford went for
the sweep in the lour-lapper and
got il as Cunliffe loafed home in
4:21.0.
His extra race may have cost
Cunliffe the extra edge he needed
against as talented a foe as Sie
bert, however. In the half, the
Stanford junior took his usual
early lead, but passed Ihe 440 in
only f)(> instead of his normal 52
seconds.
Cunliffe held on around the
final turn of the three-turn race,
hut Siebert was pulling closer all
the time, and finally inched past
with 85 yards to run. Cunliffe
held on doggedly, but Siebert con
tinued tu widen the margin to
three yards as he hit the tape in
1:50.7.
Kelly was his usual last-jump
self in the broad jump. After
grabbing the early lead at slight
ly under 24 feet, Kelly saw Ce
bron Russ move ahead on a leap
of 24 feet even. Kelly jumped
24-3, so Russ replied with a 24-4U
effort.
But came the final jump of the
competition and it was Kelly
landing out at the 24-914 mark
for the victory that Stanford felt
sure would come, but that left
Cal supporters shaking heads at
the "upset."
Merchant pulled home an extra
point in the pole vault when his
13 0 tied for first. And DeWeese,
like Kelly, had to unleash a win

ling effort on his last chance in
he discus. Seeing Wayne Crow
in the lead with a best-of-life of
101 feet, DeWeese returned with
his own personal topper of 107-K.
Martin pulled home two sur
prise points when he outsprinted
Bob Karlsrud for second in the
highs. His 14.9 was six-tenths
better than he had ever done, and
came despite the fact that Martin
knocked over the last three hur
dles.
After Cunliffe's loss, the In
dians' downfall hit high gear in
the 220, two-mile, lows and relay.
Norm Pease ran a best-ever 21.0
in the furlong, but got only third
as Willie White captured one of
his three victories of the day.
Pease was overtaken by Jack
Yerman at the ISO-yard mark as
Yerman came back from his 47.0
440 win.
The two-mile finished things
off. Bob Mon/.ingo, co-favored
with Alan Cay lord of the Bears,
set the pace for seven laps and
then was left in the dust of a
final lap kick by Oaylord and his
teammate Roger Price.

Bui Ernie Cunliffe's loss in the
880 was apparently a portent ol'

went from bad to worse and man
aged only three thirds in the clos

Early come-throughs by John
Kelly, Dave Merchant, Bob Mar
tin and A in i a rid DeWeese had

The race of the day, Cunliffe
vs. Jerry Siebert in the 880, fol
lowed unexpected channels. Bru

the mile, and it looked as though
Jordan would keep Cunliffe out
as well. But Stanford went for
the sweep in the lour-lapper and
got il as Cunliffe loafed home in
4:21.0.
His extra race may have cost
Cunliffe the extra edge he needed
against as talented a foe as Sie
bert, however. In the half, the
Stanford junior took his usual
early lead, but passed Ihe 440 in
only f)(> instead of his normal 52
seconds.
Cunliffe held on around the
final turn of the three-turn race,
hut Siebert was pulling closer all
the time, and finally inched past
with 85 yards to run. Cunliffe
held on doggedly, but Siebert con
tinued tu widen the margin to
three yards as he hit the tape in
1:50.7.
Kelly was his usual last-jump
self in the broad jump. After
grabbing the early lead at slight
ly under 24 feet, Kelly saw Ce
bron Russ move ahead on a leap
of 24 feet even. Kelly jumped
24-3, so Russ replied with a 24-4U
effort.
But came the final jump of the
competition and it was Kelly
landing out at the 24-914 mark
for the victory that Stanford felt
sure would come, but that left
Cal supporters shaking heads at
the "upset."
Merchant pulled home an extra
point in the pole vault when his
13 0 tied for first. And DeWeese,
like Kelly, had to unleash a win

ling effort on his last chance in
he discus. Seeing Wayne Crow
in the lead with a best-of-life of
101 feet, DeWeese returned with
his own personal topper of 107-K.
Martin pulled home two sur
prise points when he outsprinted
Bob Karlsrud for second in the
highs. His 14.9 was six-tenths
better than he had ever done, and
came despite the fact that Martin
knocked over the last three hur
dles.
After Cunliffe's loss, the In

the 220, two-mile, lows and relay.
Norm Pease ran a best-ever 21.0

as Willie White captured one of
his three victories of the day.
Pease was overtaken by Jack
Yerman at the ISO-yard mark as
Yerman came back from his 47.0
440 win.
The two-mile finished things
off. Bob Mon/.ingo, co-favored
with Alan Cay lord of the Bears,
set the pace for seven laps and
then was left in the dust of a
final lap kick by Oaylord and his
teammate Roger Price.
Stanford looked like a Big Meet winner for 10 events, led Cal for

for :ui upset but the late losses
wiped out early gains and far
more as Cal won its 301 h in the
series and third in a row over
Paylon Jordan.
The race of the day, Cunliffe
vs. Jerry Siebert in the 880, fol
lowed unexpected channels. Bru
tus Hamilton held Siebert out of
the mile, and it looked as though
Jordan would keep Cunliffe out
as well. But Stanford went for
the sweep in the lour-lapper and
got il as Cunliffe loafed home in
4:21.0.
His extra race may have cost
Cunliffe the extra edge he needed
against as talented a foe as Sie
bert, however. In the half, the
Stanford junior took his usual
early lead, but passed Ihe 440 in
only f)(> instead of his normal 52
seconds.
Cunliffe held on around the
final turn of the three-turn race,
hut Siebert was pulling closer all
the time, and finally inched past
with 85 yards to run. Cunliffe
held on doggedly, but Siebert con
tinued tu widen the margin to
three yards as he hit the tape in
1:50.7.
Kelly was his usual last-jump
self in the broad jump. After
grabbing the early lead at slight
ly under 24 feet, Kelly saw Ce
bron Russ move ahead on a leap
of 24 feet even. Kelly jumped
24-3, so Russ replied with a 24-4U
effort.
But came the final jump of the
competition and it was Kelly
landing out at the 24-914 mark
for the victory that Stanford felt
sure would come, but that left
Cal supporters shaking heads at
the "upset."
Merchant pulled home an extra
point in the pole vault when his
13 0 tied for first. And DeWeese,
like Kelly, had to unleash a win

ling effort on his last chance in
he discus. Seeing Wayne Crow
in the lead with a best-of-life of
101 feet, DeWeese returned with
his own personal topper of 107-K.
Martin pulled home two sur
prise points when he outsprinted
Bob Karlsrud for second in the
highs. His 14.9 was six-tenths
better than he had ever done, and
came despite the fact that Martin
knocked over the last three hur
dles.
After Cunliffe's loss, the In
dians' downfall hit high gear in
the 220, two-mile, lows and relay.
Norm Pease ran a best-ever 21.0
in the furlong, but got only third
as Willie White captured one of
his three victories of the day.
Pease was overtaken by Jack
Yerman at the ISO-yard mark as
Yerman came back from his 47.0
440 win.
The two-mile finished things
off. Bob Mon/.ingo, co-favored
with Alan Cay lord of the Bears,
set the pace for seven laps and
then was left in the dust of a
final lap kick by Oaylord and his
teammate Roger Price.
