# Bill Proposes SU Tax Cut
## 
### 
Santa Clara County Assembly
men Bruce Allen and Clark Brad
ley introduced a bill last Friday
in the State Legislature which,
if passed, would save the Univer
sity $32,000 in property taxes.
The bill proposes to increase
the University's property tax ex
emption to cover all land used
exclusively for educational pur
poses.
"We wish to bring our exemp
tion in line with present-day con
ditions so that we may devote all
of our resources to purposes di
rectly linked to education," Pres
ident J. E. Wallace Sterling com
mented.
Taxes on lands used for indus
trial areas, including the Indus
trial Park, are expected to make
up for the reduction in the Brad
ley-Allen bill, he said.
