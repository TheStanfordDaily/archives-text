Also planned for the two-day

be conducted by leading Stanford
l faculty members. These groups
will meet once daily to discuss
topics that Patterson brings out.
Enrollment is limited to 15 stu

which have been almost filled by
j International Relations majors
and by members of the lIR. who
received advance notice. Jack
| Nessel, Institute director, has urg
ed all interested students to sign
j up in the ASSU office as soon as
j possible in order to get in the
; seminar of I heir choice.
At Clubhouse
Patterson will also be present at
the Women's Clubhouse the eve
ning of May 14 for an informal
; question and answer session.
According to Nessel, the objec
tives of the Foreign Policy Insti
tute are "Mi to present a guest
lecturer whose experience, stature
and insight recommend him as an
| authority on international matters
and I2> to provide high-level dis
cussion seminars wherein the par
j lieipants may explore extensively
the problems suggested by the
principal lectures.
"The ultimate objective includes
a perspicuous study of all aspects
of tlnited Stales policy toward the
j world's troubled areas," he said,
j "It is expected that participants
in the Foreign Policy Institute
will, by dint of thoughtful attend
ance. increase their understanding
of international problems and,
simultaneously, gain practice in
the vital process of decision mak
ing," he added.

The Institute was initiated last
year, with James Reston, head of
the New York Times Washington
bureau, as keynote speaker, and
as a result of the enthusiastic re
sponse lIR has decided to make it
an annual event.
President J. E. Wallace Sterling
has called the Institute "an exam
ple of student initiative contribut
ing to the educational program of
the University. Now in its second
year, the Foreign Policy Institute
provides a focus and a forum for
informed comment and intelligent
discussion of important issues."
