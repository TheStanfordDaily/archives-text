# Capacity Crowd Attends Kendall-Sibley Debate
## Kendall Defines Force As Basis for Society 
### Judy Sklar 
Professor Willmoore Kendall, Burkoan conservative, met Profes
sor Mulforrl Q. Sibley, pacifist, last night in a discussion of "The Use
of Force: Moral or Immoral, Christian or Unchristian" before a ca
pacity audience of 171!) in Memorial Auditorium. Professor Leland
Chapin was moderator.
Kendall based his affirmation of the use of force entirely on Ed-

j mund Burke's criticism of the
French Revolution.
Sibley held that war (killing)
and Christian love are incompat
ible because the act and the con
sequences of war are inseparable.
The use of force, Kendall be
lieves, is a premise on which
Western civilization rests; it is
| "the frame of civilization and it
is of inestimable value. We will
not alter the frame or the civili
zation." "We" is the overwhelm
ing majority of people of West
ern civilization, past, present and
future.
Western civilization is some

thing which exists, something de
finable. It changes luil still re
mains recognizable. It has an or
thodoxy of belief, commitment
and ideas of good and evil, and is
identifiable by those traditions
which have survived for the long
est period of time.
One VN'lio Demands
A pacifist, one who demands
the principle rejection for force
and condemns the violent use of
arms by legally constituted
states, is alien to the tradition
of both Western civilization and
Christianity. His beliefs are a ne
gation of "Christian love" and
"an irresponsible, callous indif
ference to the wants, needs and
rights of his fellow man."
He is a barbarian, for he wishes
to live off but not within the civ
ilization. lie is a threat to society
because he derives his strength
from what he rejects and there
fore weakens the society. He is
thus a parasite, completing the
"trinity of pacifism."
( liristianity
Roth the New Testament and
historical Christianity support
the use of force.
The state as a natural institu
tion has the right to the means
(war) to preserve itself and its
proper functioning. No state
wills its own dissolution, its own
nothingness. Not having war
condemns the state to extinction;
it can protect the lives and liberty
of its citizens only with force.
A war is just and legitimate
when the state is fighting for its
preservation, its honor, to pre
serve human dignity, for order in
the future or to teach a nation a
"lesson in morals."
St. Thomas said that the only
man who has the right 1o turn
the other cheek is the man on
whom no higher responsibility
falls.
"Heretics"
Sibley, addressing the audience
as "orthodox, heretic s an d
friends," stated that war cannot
protect the world.
Principles must depend on
values but the guides for conduct
in each case are unique. The act
cannot be separated from its con
sequences.
Force can be divided into two
kinds: non - violent and violent.
Non violent includes the force of
right and reason — any force
which is capable of being used
without the loss of human life.
Violent, or non-legitimate force,
includes capital punishment and
war.
War is the deliberate and in
discriminate killing of human be-
ings. It decreases sensitivity, in
flames passions, results in unde
sirable alliances, contradicts
freedom and sets up tyranny. It
reduces people to things, instru
merits of death.
Disarmament
Sibley urges unilateral disarm
ament and central reliance on ed
ucation and co-operative econom
ic action. Socrates said, "it is bet
ter to suffer injustice than to
commit."
A constructive change in the
temper of world politics, a unity
of nature and power, means and
ends is necessary.
Loyally to the state as the em
bodiment of order is justified,
but the state in war is the embod
iment of disorder and entirely un
justified.
This does not mean non-resist
ance, but non-violent resistance.
Lthicnl Responsibilities
Undermining willingness of en
emy troops to obey and agitating
the young to resist their fathers
can be done peacefully.
The spiritual implications of
the Bible cannot be reconciled
with the act of war. Historically
Christians are incompatible with
soldiers.
Ethically we have a responsi
bility to principle, utility, moral
ity and expediency.
Kendall, when asked how he
would proceed to save democracy
after Russia had dropped a bomb
on Palo Alto, said that he would
retaliate in kind. Sibley felt that
after that it would be too late to
Surrender
Sibley was asked what he
would do if the Soviet Union de
livered an ultimatum to the Unit
ed States to either surrender or
fight a war. Sibley answered that
with U.S. policy as it is now he
would surrender, because the
likely results of such a war would
be the destruction of a great par t
of the human race.
But with the policy Sibley ad
vocates he would ask Russia to
send her troops over- and then or
ganize a non-violent resistance
movement.

One VN'lio Demands
A pacifist, one who demands
the principle rejection for force
and condemns the violent use of
arms by legally constituted
states, is alien to the tradition
of both Western civilization and
Christianity. His beliefs are a ne
gation of "Christian love" and
"an irresponsible, callous indif
ference to the wants, needs and
rights of his fellow man."
He is a barbarian, for he wishes
to live off but not within the civ
ilization. lie is a threat to society
because he derives his strength
from what he rejects and there
fore weakens the society. He is
thus a parasite, completing the
"trinity of pacifism."
( liristianity
Roth the New Testament and
historical Christianity support
the use of force.
The state as a natural institu
tion has the right to the means
(war) to preserve itself and its
proper functioning. No state
wills its own dissolution, its own
nothingness. Not having war
condemns the state to extinction;
it can protect the lives and liberty
of its citizens only with force.
A war is just and legitimate
when the state is fighting for its
preservation, its honor, to pre
serve human dignity, for order in
the future or to teach a nation a
"lesson in morals."
St. Thomas said that the only
man who has the right 1o turn
the other cheek is the man on
whom no higher responsibility
falls.
"Heretics"
Sibley, addressing the audience
as "orthodox, heretic s an d
friends," stated that war cannot
protect the world.
Principles must depend on
values but the guides for conduct
in each case are unique. The act
cannot be separated from its con
sequences.
Force can be divided into two
kinds: non - violent and violent.
Non violent includes the force of
right and reason — any force
which is capable of being used
without the loss of human life.
Violent, or non-legitimate force,
includes capital punishment and
war.
War is the deliberate and in
discriminate killing of human be-
ings. It decreases sensitivity, in
flames passions, results in unde
sirable alliances, contradicts
freedom and sets up tyranny. It
reduces people to things, instru
merits of death.
Disarmament
Sibley urges unilateral disarm
ament and central reliance on ed
ucation and co-operative econom
ic action. Socrates said, "it is bet
ter to suffer injustice than to
commit."
A constructive change in the
temper of world politics, a unity
of nature and power, means and
ends is necessary.
Loyally to the state as the em
bodiment of order is justified,
but the state in war is the embod
iment of disorder and entirely un
justified.
This does not mean non-resist
ance, but non-violent resistance.
Lthicnl Responsibilities
Undermining willingness of en
emy troops to obey and agitating
the young to resist their fathers
can be done peacefully.
The spiritual implications of
the Bible cannot be reconciled
with the act of war. Historically
Christians are incompatible with
soldiers.
Ethically we have a responsi
bility to principle, utility, moral
ity and expediency.
Kendall, when asked how he
would proceed to save democracy
after Russia had dropped a bomb
on Palo Alto, said that he would
retaliate in kind. Sibley felt that
after that it would be too late to
Surrender
Sibley was asked what he
would do if the Soviet Union de
livered an ultimatum to the Unit
ed States to either surrender or
fight a war. Sibley answered that
with U.S. policy as it is now he
would surrender, because the
likely results of such a war would
be the destruction of a great par t
of the human race.
But with the policy Sibley ad
vocates he would ask Russia to
send her troops over- and then or
ganize a non-violent resistance
movement.
Professor Willmoore Kendall, Burkoan conservative, met Profes
sor Mulforrl Q. Sibley, pacifist, last night in a discussion of "The Use
of Force: Moral or Immoral, Christian or Unchristian" before a ca
pacity audience of 171!) in Memorial Auditorium. Professor Leland
Chapin was moderator.
Kendall based his affirmation of the use of force entirely on Ed-

j mund Burke's criticism of the
French Revolution.
Sibley held that war (killing)
and Christian love are incompat
ible because the act and the con
sequences of war are inseparable.
The use of force, Kendall be
lieves, is a premise on which
Western civilization rests; it is
| "the frame of civilization and it
is of inestimable value. We will
not alter the frame or the civili
zation." "We" is the overwhelm

preservation, its honor, to pre
serve human dignity, for order in
the future or to teach a nation a
"lesson in morals."
St. Thomas said that the only
man who has the right 1o turn
the other cheek is the man on
whom no higher responsibility
falls.
"Heretics"
Sibley, addressing the audience
as "orthodox, heretic s an d
friends," stated that war cannot
protect the world.
Principles must depend on
values but the guides for conduct
in each case are unique. The act
cannot be separated from its con
sequences.
Force can be divided into two
kinds: non - violent and violent.
Non violent includes the force of
right and reason — any force
which is capable of being used
without the loss of human life.
Violent, or non-legitimate force,
includes capital punishment and
war.
War is the deliberate and in
discriminate killing of human be-
ings. It decreases sensitivity, in
flames passions, results in unde
sirable alliances, contradicts
freedom and sets up tyranny. It
reduces people to things, instru
merits of death.
Disarmament
Sibley urges unilateral disarm
ament and central reliance on ed
ucation and co-operative econom
ic action. Socrates said, "it is bet
ter to suffer injustice than to
commit."
A constructive change in the
temper of world politics, a unity
of nature and power, means and
ends is necessary.
Loyally to the state as the em
bodiment of order is justified,
but the state in war is the embod
iment of disorder and entirely un
justified.
This does not mean non-resist
ance, but non-violent resistance.
Lthicnl Responsibilities
Undermining willingness of en
emy troops to obey and agitating
the young to resist their fathers
can be done peacefully.
The spiritual implications of
the Bible cannot be reconciled
with the act of war. Historically
Christians are incompatible with
soldiers.
Ethically we have a responsi
bility to principle, utility, moral
ity and expediency.
Kendall, when asked how he
would proceed to save democracy
after Russia had dropped a bomb
on Palo Alto, said that he would
retaliate in kind. Sibley felt that
after that it would be too late to
Surrender
Sibley was asked what he
would do if the Soviet Union de
livered an ultimatum to the Unit
ed States to either surrender or
fight a war. Sibley answered that
with U.S. policy as it is now he
would surrender, because the
likely results of such a war would
be the destruction of a great par t
of the human race.
But with the policy Sibley ad
vocates he would ask Russia to
send her troops over- and then or
ganize a non-violent resistance
movement.
Professor Willmoore Kendall, Burkoan conservative, met Profes
sor Mulforrl Q. Sibley, pacifist, last night in a discussion of "The Use
of Force: Moral or Immoral, Christian or Unchristian" before a ca
pacity audience of 171!) in Memorial Auditorium. Professor Leland
Chapin was moderator.
Kendall based his affirmation of the use of force entirely on Ed-

j mund Burke's criticism of the
French Revolution.
Sibley held that war (killing)
and Christian love are incompat
ible because the act and the con
sequences of war are inseparable.
The use of force, Kendall be
lieves, is a premise on which
Western civilization rests; it is
| "the frame of civilization and it
is of inestimable value. We will
not alter the frame or the civili
zation." "We" is the overwhelm
ing majority of people of West
ern civilization, past, present and
future.
Western civilization is some

thing which exists, something de
finable. It changes luil still re
mains recognizable. It has an or
thodoxy of belief, commitment
and ideas of good and evil, and is
identifiable by those traditions
which have survived for the long
est period of time.
One VN'lio Demands
A pacifist, one who demands
the principle rejection for force
and condemns the violent use of
arms by legally constituted
states, is alien to the tradition
of both Western civilization and
Christianity. His beliefs are a ne
gation of "Christian love" and
"an irresponsible, callous indif
ference to the wants, needs and
rights of his fellow man."
He is a barbarian, for he wishes
to live off but not within the civ
ilization. lie is a threat to society
because he derives his strength
from what he rejects and there
fore weakens the society. He is
thus a parasite, completing the
"trinity of pacifism."

Roth the New Testament and

The state as a natural institu
tion has the right to the means
(war) to preserve itself and its
proper functioning. No state
wills its own dissolution, its own
nothingness. Not having war
condemns the state to extinction;
it can protect the lives and liberty
of its citizens only with force.
