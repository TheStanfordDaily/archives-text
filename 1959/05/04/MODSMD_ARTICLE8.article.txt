the School of Business, worked
for the U.S. State Department in
Paris for two years, and has at
tended the London School of Eco
nomics.
The purposes of the commis
sion include facilitating cultural
exchange with other countries
and, more specifically, introduc
ing foreign students to American
life and academic life at Stanford.
According to Young, students
who work on the commission will
get "an opportunity to meet those
with different viewpoints and ex
periences, to practice foreign lan
guages, and gain an insight into
foreign cultures which is useful
if you intend to study or travel
abroad."
The commission selects 1.0 or 11
foreign scholars each year from
over 2000 students who inquire
about the grants. Committee
members meet with newly-ar
rived students in a one-week hos
tel in September to help them
plan registration and also trips
and social events throughout the
year.
The scholars visit local courts,
political functions and branches
of local and state government.
Parties, picnics and hostels arc
also planned. The committee
helps scholars plan their speak
ing engagements with campus
and community groups.
