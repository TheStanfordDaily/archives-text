A British physician who ranks ;is the
outstanding exponent of a new "unlocked
floor" type of psychiatric care will assist
in setting up a psychiatric treatment unit
at Stanford's new Medical Center now
reaching completion on campus.
Professor Maxwell S. Jones, director of
the Social Rehabilitation Unit at Belmont
Hospital in Surrey, Kngland, will serve as
visiting professor of psychiatry for the
year beginning July 1.
His appointment was announced by Dr.
Thomas A. CJonda, acting head of flu* Psy
chiatry Department, during an open-house
press visit to a similar psychiatric unit at
Stanford University Hospital in San Fran
cisco. In observance of National Mental
Health Week (April 27 May 3), reporters
and photographers were allowed to talk
with the patients and photograph activities
of the ward in an unprecedented kind of
medical press conference.
The new type of psychiatric care, called

the "therapeutic community" technique,
was developed in Fngland by Dr. Jones
and others. It allows p;itients wide free
dom on their own responsibility as a group.
Kxpcrience shows that patients conform
voluntarily to the group's standards and
abide by group decisions.
"By giving the patient as much respon
sibility as he is ready to accept," says Dr.
Anthony J. Hrriehetti, Jr., who is in charge
of the ward at Stanford Hospital, "we are
focusing attention on the healthy aspects
of his personality, rather than the un
healthy ones."
"Before we adopted this type of care, the
ward was like any standard, locked psy
chiatry ward," he added. "Most patients
were tense, withdrawn. The difference is
unmistakable. Now the atmosphere is re
laxed. and the patients respond according
ly."
In the Stanford ward there is no easy
way for the casual observer to tell the pa
tient from the doctor, nurse or social work
er. All wear street clothes and participate

in group discussions. The ward resembles
a dormitory wing rather than a hospital
wing.
A number of therapeutic community
units are operating successfully at public
hospitals in the United States, but it is be
lieved (hat Stanford's is the only private
general hospital unit of its kind.
II is expected that a unit will be contin
ued at San Francisco after the Medical
School moves to tin- campus next summer,
but another, larger unit of from 2."> to 30
beds will be activated at the new medical
center. This will be a combined undertak
ing by practicing psychiatrists of the Palo
Alto area working with the Stanford De
partment of Psychiatry.
Dr. Jones, who will assist in this task,
holds the M,D. degree from the University
of Edinburgh, where he was also a lecturer.
He has taught mental health at the London
School of Economics, and social psychiatry
at the University of London. In 1950-51 he
served as consultant in mental health to
the World Health Organization at Geneva.
