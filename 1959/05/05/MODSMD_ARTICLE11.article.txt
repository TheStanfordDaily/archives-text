# Mboya: Foreign Policy Of U.S. Inconsistent'
## 
### Bob Frank 
Torn Mboya, Kenya nationalist leader, yesterday explained to a.
Political Union meeting in Cubberley why he thinks there is an "in
consistency in American foreign policy."
The United States, ho said, is weakening its "moral stand" as
â€¢spokesman for democracy by operating on a principle of expediency

in refusing to support the move
ment for the independence of 130
million Africans.
The position that Africans are j
not yet ready for independence j
cannot be supported, said Mboya.
"Africa has always been and al
ways will be ready for independ
ence."
Freedom Needed
The African states which have
won their independence have
proven, Mboya said, that freedom
is all the Africans need to prove
their worth. The difficulties the
new states have met were all
caused by the "old regime."
In Ghana, for example, 83 per
cent of school-age children now
attend school, where before inde
pendence no more than 23 per
cent did. It is not a question,
Mboya said, of making a supply
of technologists, doctors and sci
entists a prerequisite to inde
pendence education will follow
independence.
Military Alliances
The West, said Mboya, places
too much emphasis on military
alliances, too little on economic
aid and development. Yet in Af
rica, people who have little to eat
and no decent houses to live in
will not be moved by pleas to sup
port the United States in fighting
Communism.
The leaders of Africa's nation
alists face this same problem:
they must "deliver the goods"i
and win help from other coun
tries in their fight for independ
ence, capital investment, techni
cal aid, health and higher stand
ards of living.
