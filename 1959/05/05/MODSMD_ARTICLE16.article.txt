THE MANY LOVES
OF THORWALD DOCKSTADER
When Thorwald Dockstader—sophomore, epicure, and sports
man—first took up smoking, he did not simply choose the first
brand of cigarettes that came to hand. He did what any sopho
more, epicure, and sportsman would do: he sampled several
brands and then picked the mildest, tastiest, pleasingest of all
— Philip Morris, of corris!
Similarly, when Thorwald took up girls, he did not simply
select the first one who came along. Ile sampled. First he took
out an English literature major named Elizabeth Barrett (Irisht,
a wisp of a girl with luminous eyes and a soul that shimmered
with a pale, unearthly beauty. Trippingly, trippingly, she
walked with Thorwald upon the beach and sat with him behind
a windward dune and listened to a sea shell and sighed sweetly
and took out a little gold pencil and a little morocco notebook
and wrote a little poem:
1 will lie upon the shore,
1 will be a dreamer.
1 will feel the Hen once more
Pounding on my femur.
Thorwald's second date was with a physical education major
named Peaches CUendower, a broth of a girl with a ready smile
and a size IS neck. She took Thorwald down to the cinder t rack
where they jogged around 50 times to open the pores. Then they
played four games of squash, six sets of tennis, 30 holes of golf,
nine innings of one old cat, six chukkers of lacrosse, and a mile
and a quarter of leap frog. Then they went ten rounds with eight
ounce gloves and then they had heaping bowls of bran and whey
anil exchanged a manly handshake and went home to their
respective whirlpool baths. 4

Thorwald's final date was with a golden-haired, creamy
browed, green-eyed, red-lipped, full-calved girl named Totsi
Sigafoos. Totsi was not majoring in anything. As she often said,
"Gee whillikers, what's college for anyhow—to fill your head
full of icky old facts, or to discover the shining essence that is
YOU?"
Totsi started the evening with Thorwald at a luxurious
restaurant where she consumed her own weight in Cornish rock
hen. From there they went to a de luxe movie palace where
Totsi had popcorn with butter. Then she had a bag of chocolate
covered raisins—also with butter. Then they went to a costly
ballroom and cha-cha'd till dawn, tipping the band every eight
bars. Then they went to a Chinese restaurant where Totsi, un
able to decipher the large and baffling menu, found a simple
way out of her dilemma: she ordered one of everything. Then
Thorwald took her to the women's dorm, boosted her in the
window, and went downtown to wait for the employment office
to open.
While waiting, Thorwald thought over all of his girls and
came to a sensible decision. "I think," lie said to himself, "that
I will stick with Philip Morris. I am not rich enough for girls."

Anybody is rich enouqh for Philip Morris—and for Philip
Morris's brother cigarette, titter-tip Marlboro, the cif/arette
with better "makin's". The flavor's fine, the filter filters,
the price is right.

window, and went downtown to wait for the employment office
to open.
While waiting, Thorwald thought over all of his girls and
came to a sensible decision. "I think," lie said to himself, "that
I will stick with Philip Morris. I am not rich enough for girls."

Anybody is rich enouqh for Philip Morris—and for Philip
Morris's brother cigarette, titter-tip Marlboro, the cif/arette
with better "makin's". The flavor's fine, the filter filters,
the price is right.


THE MANY LOVES
OF THORWALD DOCKSTADER
When Thorwald Dockstader—sophomore, epicure, and sports
man—first took up smoking, he did not simply choose the first
brand of cigarettes that came to hand. He did what any sopho
more, epicure, and sportsman would do: he sampled several
brands and then picked the mildest, tastiest, pleasingest of all
— Philip Morris, of corris!
Similarly, when Thorwald took up girls, he did not simply
select the first one who came along. Ile sampled. First he took
out an English literature major named Elizabeth Barrett (Irisht,
a wisp of a girl with luminous eyes and a soul that shimmered
with a pale, unearthly beauty. Trippingly, trippingly, she
walked with Thorwald upon the beach and sat with him behind
a windward dune and listened to a sea shell and sighed sweetly
and took out a little gold pencil and a little morocco notebook
and wrote a little poem:
1 will lie upon the shore,
1 will be a dreamer.
1 will feel the Hen once more
Pounding on my femur.
Thorwald's second date was with a physical education major
named Peaches CUendower, a broth of a girl with a ready smile
and a size IS neck. She took Thorwald down to the cinder t rack
where they jogged around 50 times to open the pores. Then they
played four games of squash, six sets of tennis, 30 holes of golf,
nine innings of one old cat, six chukkers of lacrosse, and a mile
and a quarter of leap frog. Then they went ten rounds with eight
ounce gloves and then they had heaping bowls of bran and whey
anil exchanged a manly handshake and went home to their
respective whirlpool baths. 4

Thorwald's final date was with a golden-haired, creamy
browed, green-eyed, red-lipped, full-calved girl named Totsi
Sigafoos. Totsi was not majoring in anything. As she often said,
"Gee whillikers, what's college for anyhow—to fill your head
full of icky old facts, or to discover the shining essence that is
YOU?"
Totsi started the evening with Thorwald at a luxurious
restaurant where she consumed her own weight in Cornish rock
hen. From there they went to a de luxe movie palace where
Totsi had popcorn with butter. Then she had a bag of chocolate
covered raisins—also with butter. Then they went to a costly
ballroom and cha-cha'd till dawn, tipping the band every eight
bars. Then they went to a Chinese restaurant where Totsi, un
able to decipher the large and baffling menu, found a simple
way out of her dilemma: she ordered one of everything. Then
Thorwald took her to the women's dorm, boosted her in the
window, and went downtown to wait for the employment office
to open.
While waiting, Thorwald thought over all of his girls and
