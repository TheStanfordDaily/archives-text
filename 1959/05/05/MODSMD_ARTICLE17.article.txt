It was 1919* the beginning of
an era remembered by such "re
urns to normalcy" as the Charles
lon and the flapper.
In June of that year a big step
was made in improving the wel
fare of children, for Ihe old Stan
ford family mansion took on a
new role and became ihe Conva
lescent Home.
That was not the first lime,
however, that the mansion and
ihe Stanford name were to be as
sociated with kindness to the very
young.
Stanford Hospitality
Back in the 1880's and '90's
many children were enjoying the
hospitality of the home as guests
of Mrs. Leland Stanford.
For the most part, these chil
dren were members of the Stan
ford Free Kindergarten, which
had branches in Menlo Park and
Mayfield, now South Palo Alto.
At least one person remembers
the days when the kindergarten
children went to the Stanford
home, with its spacious garden in
which the plantings spelled out
the word "welcome."
He is Col. Howard Nichols, 72,
now of Bakersfield. In 1890 Nich
ols was a four-year-old member
of Mrs. Stanford's kindergarten
in Mayfield. He recalls one of the
functions at what is now the Con
Home:
Lawn Party
"Mrs. Stanford invited t he class
—10 to 15 members 1o a lawn
party at her- home one afternoon.
I was impressed by the beauty of
her home and at how graciously
she entertained us.
"She warned us to be careful
when we bit into our cup cakes
because one of them had a gold
ring in it," Nichols continued.
"1 was the lucky pupil, but 1
lost the ring a few days later by
dropping it through a crack in
the railroad station platform. It
was a plain gold band a trifle
large for me."
The mansion was erected in
1864—95 years ago by a wealthy

Englishman, George Gordon,
who desired to spend his sum
mers away from San Francisco
on his country estate.
In 1876 Leland Stanford bought
the estate, which he named Palo
Alto Farm. He remodeled and
enlarged the mansion.
The kindergarten had its in
ception in 1879 when a group of
public • spirited San Franciscans,
including Mis. Stanford, decided
to provide free preschool train
ing of the Barbary Coast (now
the International Settlement).
School Visits
Soon many kindergartens dot
ted the city. Leland Jr. enjoyed
visiting these schools with his
mother. As a result, just after
his death i/i 1884, Mrs. Stanford
gave $5000 to the San Francisco
kindergarten association.
The members surprised the
Stanfords and used the money to
establish the first Leland Stan
ford Jr. Memorial Free Kinder
garten. Mrs. Stanford soon es
tablished four more in San Fran
cisco and the ones in Menlo and
Mayfield.

The mansion was erected in
1864—95 years ago by a wealthy

Englishman, George Gordon,
who desired to spend his sum

In 1876 Leland Stanford bought
the estate, which he named Palo

enlarged the mansion.

the International Settlement).
School Visits
Soon many kindergartens dot
ted the city. Leland Jr. enjoyed
visiting these schools with his
mother. As a result, just after
his death i/i 1884, Mrs. Stanford
gave $5000 to the San Francisco
kindergarten association.
The members surprised the
Stanfords and used the money to
establish the first Leland Stan

STANFORD STUDENTS TOUR "CON HOME"
The old Stanford home still plays a big part
It was 1919* the beginning of
an era remembered by such "re
urns to normalcy" as the Charles
lon and the flapper.
In June of that year a big step
was made in improving the wel
fare of children, for Ihe old Stan
ford family mansion took on a
new role and became ihe Conva
lescent Home.
That was not the first lime,
however, that the mansion and
ihe Stanford name were to be as
sociated with kindness to the very
young.
Stanford Hospitality
Back in the 1880's and '90's
many children were enjoying the
hospitality of the home as guests
of Mrs. Leland Stanford.
For the most part, these chil
dren were members of the Stan
ford Free Kindergarten, which
had branches in Menlo Park and
Mayfield, now South Palo Alto.
At least one person remembers
the days when the kindergarten
children went to the Stanford
home, with its spacious garden in
which the plantings spelled out
the word "welcome."
He is Col. Howard Nichols, 72,
now of Bakersfield. In 1890 Nich
ols was a four-year-old member
of Mrs. Stanford's kindergarten
in Mayfield. He recalls one of the
functions at what is now the Con
Home:
