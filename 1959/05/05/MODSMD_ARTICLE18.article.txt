# Con Home Has Special School
## 
### 
Absence from school is one of
the biggest problems faced by
the convalescing child.
The Con Home has a special
school prog ra m which helps
many of the children keep up
with their regular school classes.
Some type of school program
has been offered since 1924, when
classes were held on the glassed
in porch of the old Stanford
home.
Since that time, the school has
grown until it now has three
rooms, five teachers and a prin
cipal.
Divided into primary, interme
diate, and junior and high school
groups, most of the children have
four hours of school work per
day. In cases where the child
cannot leave bed to attend class,
the teacher goes to him.
Each classroom contains a bed,
and special equipment which
might be needed. In addition, au
diovisual aid equipment is fur
nished by the Palo Alto School
District, which sponsors the pro
gram at the Home.
Curriculum here is a very indi
vidual thing, lilted to each par
ticular case. Here a child who
can do ninth grade English, but
is slow at math at that level, can
take a lower-level math course.
School classes are conducted
here in a manner very similar to
public schools, except that each
child has a particular problem
in his physical disability. Since
fewer students are found in the
older age group, it is also diffi
cult to satisfy the varied needs
of high school requirements.
