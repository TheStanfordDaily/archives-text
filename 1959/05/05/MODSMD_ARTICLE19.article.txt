"Con Home Week" iho week when Stanford University honors
the Stanford Convalescent Home, the only institution of its kind on
any campus in the United States. Con Home Week's purpose?
It is a student-sponsored drive to raise money for the rehabilitation
of some (i.l children at the "Con Home."
The "Con Home" got its start in 1917 when convalescent children
from San Francisco were moved down to Stanford for the summer.
In 1919, the "Con Home" was moved to the house and grounds of
Senator and Mrs. Stanford and acquired its present name. The Home
still occupies this site, for which ii pays a nominal yearly rent of
one dollar.

The Con Home specializes in
the care of children convalescing
from such non-communicable
diseases as rheumatic fever, polio
and malnutrition. Its goal is to
rehabilitate a child, previously
handicapped to such an extent
that he was unable to function
successfully in normal life. When
discharged, most patients are
able to resume a normal place in
their family circles.
Since 1919, the Home has treat
ed more than 5900 children. The
average stay for a child is 200
days. Original age limits of l to
12 years have been extended to
include 2 through teen-age.
Medical Care Donated
Medical care is donated to the
children by a staff of Palo Alto
pediatricians. There are 90 full
time staff members plus a num
ber of part-time staff. Each child
receives as much individual care
and attention as he needs. Fees
are based on the family's ability
to pay.
In technical terms, the Home is
a non - profit, non • sectarian li
censed, acute and chronic hospital
and rehabilitation center. There
are six buildings on a large site
west of the Stanford Shopping
Center.
Old Home Used
The original Stanford home is
used as a physical and occupa
tional therapy center. There is a
well-equipped clinical and bacte
riological laboratory and facili
ties for electrocardiography and
pulmonary function studies.
The Home is thus staffed and
equipped to care for noi only chil
dren with chronic illnesses and
disabilities, but also to care for
acute problems or emergencies
which might occur during a
child's hospitalization.
Support ("ontributed
Support comes entirely from
endowment, trust funds, private
gifts, drives sponsored by .junior
auxiliaries and the Stanford stu
dent body through Con Home
Week." Each year, some 20,000
people, both on and off campus,
are solicited for contributions.
Con Home Week's contribution
will usually support the Home
for about one week.
This year's goal is $10,000.

discharged, most patients are
able to resume a normal place in
their family circles.
Since 1919, the Home has treat
ed more than 5900 children. The
average stay for a child is 200
days. Original age limits of l to
12 years have been extended to
include 2 through teen-age.
