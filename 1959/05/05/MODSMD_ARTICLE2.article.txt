## Liquor Bill Passes in Assembly 
### 
A bill If) protect liquor licensees
located within 1 1 j miles of Eseon
dido Village, the new married
students housing development,
has jiassed the State Assembly
and moved on to the Senate.
Assemblyman Clark Bradley of
San Jose told The Daily the Sen
ate Committee on Governmental
Efficiency will open hearings on
the measure May 13.
State law prohibits sale of liq
uor within 1 1 - miles of Stanford's
"working campus." Erection of
Ihe new housing has extended the
campus boundary, bringing nine
Palo Alto liquor establishments
within the 1 'I'-mile limit.
Nine Could Stay
Bradley's bill would allow the
nine to remain in business, but
would prohibit new licenses with
in the limit. The nine would be
allowed to sell their licenses, but
a license could not be moved to
another establishment within the
area.
In hearings by the Assembly
Committee on Government Or
ganization, the hill was opposed
by certain WCTU and church
groups, but was passed unani
mously from committee. The As
sembly approved the bill with no
floor opposition.
Bradley said he anticipates no
trouble in its passing the Senate.
No date has yet been set for
hearings on a bill which will in
crease Stanford's real property
tax exemption. The measure, in
troduced by Bradley and Assem
blyman Bruce Allen, has been
sent to the Assembly Committee
on Revenue and Taxation.
IM4MI Acres lOxeinpt
The bill would make it possible
for Stanford to claim exemption
on 1300 acres used for exclusively
educational purposes instead of
ihe 100 acres now allowed under
a 1900 constitutional amendment.
Stanford would save about $32,-
000 in payments to Santa Clara
County, but increases in tax pay
ments on land in industrial park,
shopping center and profession
al-administrative areas are ex
pected to more than make up for
the reduction.
Here, too, Bradley sees little
trouble ahead in getting the bill
passed by the Legislature.
