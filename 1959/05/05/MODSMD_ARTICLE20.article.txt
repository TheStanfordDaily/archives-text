# CON HOME
## Admission Free From Restriction 
### 
No area, racial or religious re
strictions arc imposed on the
children who apply for admission
|to the Convalescent Home. Ad
mission. however, is based par
| tially on a referral from a doctor
â–  or a hospital and partially on the
! facilities available to the children
, at the Con Home.
Because of the limited facili
ties of the Home, the staff feels
that no child should be admitted
unless the facilities of the Home
can actually help the child in
j some way. Whether this is
through physical therapy, occu
pational therapy or general nurs
ing care that the Home provides,
: depends entirely on the child's
illness.
Talk with Parents
Before a child is admitted to
the Con Home, Miss Adele Mo
loney, admissions adviser, talks
with the parents of the child, ex
plaining the facilities of the 4
Home, the social work and con
ferences that will he necessary
and the financial troubles that
might arise.
Care of a few of the children
is paid for entirely by national
organizations, such as the Na
tional Foundation for Infantile
, Paralysis.
I'art-Payment
Care of the majority of the chil
dren, however, is on a part-pay
l merit basis. The parents of the
children determine how much of
ihe child's fee they can pay, and
the Con Home makes up the rest
of the payment through insur
ance, private service organiza
tions and donations from the six
service guilds on Hie Peninsula
and Stanford's Con Home Drive.
When the preliminary finan
cial questions have been settled,
Miss Moronev visits the child to
be admitted, taking along a scrap
book of pictures of the Con Home
and its activities.
