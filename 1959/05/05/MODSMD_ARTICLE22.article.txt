# Invalid Children Aided By Occupational Therapy
## 
### Sallyanne Durr 
A valuable portion of the Convalescent Homo's program for the
rehabilitation of invalid children is occupational therapy.
The occupational therapy department includes three full-time ther
apists, plus student interns from San Jose State, Mills College, the
University of Southern California and Stanford.

Concerned with helping chil
dren adjust their handicaps to
their environment, this depart
ment works with use of the
hands and arms in developing
daily living habits. Learning use
ful crafts is also a result of this
type of therapy.
Special Room
A special room, "the Daily Ac
tion Living Room," is used in the
old Stanford home for occupa
tional therapy treatment. Here
one finds a small table complete
with place setting where the
youngster learns to handle silver
ware and control his eating hab
its.
Another article in the room is
a bod. which the youngsters learn
to make. Here, too, they learn to
dress themselves.
Equipped with a one-way win
dow, the room allows parents to
observe the actions and develop
ment of their children. Thus, the
worried mother can see for her
self that Johnny is capable of
dressing himself.
< raits Rooms
In another building of the
Home, the visitor finds two rooms
filled with crafts materials. Com
plete with a work table, tools,
sewing machines and a kiln, this
portion of the occupational ther
apy department aids the children
to develop skills with their
hands.
Here activities arc both func
tional and recreational. The chil
dren can do things which are fun
and creative to them, yet are

treatment at the same time.
Materials used in crafts are
purchased with the "Fun Fund,"
established for the little extras
in the Home.
