# Therapy Helps Rehabilitation
## 
### Elna Rodenhouse 
As an integral part of the (Jon
Home's rehabilitation program,
the physical therapy program
tries not to achieve perfection in
its patients, but tries instead to
help them learn to lead as nearly
normal a 'life as possible.
At present, the physical ther
apy unit is treating 30 patients,
who arc suffering from a variety
of diseases, ranging from polio
to kidney malfunctions to asth
matic disorders.
Physical therapy apparatus is
located in the central house,
which used to be the Stanfords'
home. The apparatus includes
the conventional gym equipment,
such as bar bells and weighted
wheels to help develop arm and
shoulder muscles, stairs and
walkways to help strengthen leg
muscles, bicycles to help learn co
ordination, and other types of
exercise equipment.
Also included in the physical
therapy apparatus is an electro
therapy machine which is occa
sionally employed to help the pa
tient remember which muscles
to contract to perform a given
action.
