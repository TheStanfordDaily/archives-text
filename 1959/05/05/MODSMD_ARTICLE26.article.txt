# 'Left' Problem Far Out of Proportion
## 
### 
An IMI'OIITAINT point made by financial manager Larry Kelley at
I hursduy's Legislature <lini'iissioit «112 the Stanford Left problem
is that the situation has been blown up far out of proportion.
The issue, in brief, has been whether President John Bohn's
cancellation of a debate last week was legal under the constitu
tion. The debate was arranged under sponsorship of the MR, but
all publicity matter said sponsorship was by the Stanford Left,
with no mention of 118. The Left was a recently-formed organi
zation which had not as yet gone before Legislature lor approval
to operate on campus.
Where the. situation appears to be out of proportion
is in tin 7 introiluction of freedom of speech charges and
totalitarian charges by supporters of the Stanford Left
into art issue whii'h i.v in reality only of a procedural
nature.
George Guy, 1-Glub president and spokesman for the Left at
Legislature, admitted the publicity error, and said the Left had
no desire to abridge established rules of ASSIJ.
But while admitting the error, the Left made no logical move
to operate within the rules. The group has bad two courses of
act ion open to il:
• Present a constitution for approval, which would make it
possible for the group to sponsor public meetings on campus.
• Present to legislature proposals to change rules for spon
soring such meetings if it is felt that present rules are unworkable
or not good.
Neither of these actions has been taken by the Left.
Instead, it has chosen to attack Bolm and legislature through
its mimeographed publication. The most recent charges, pre
sented in a satirical article, intimate that all freedom of speech
has been cut off for this group and that totalitarianism reigns.
All this, when all Bolm <1 i <l was enforce existing rules of the
Association.
Making the situation more difficult was a semantic problem
between Bohn and Guy. \\ hen Bohn informed Guy that the
debate "will be canceled," Guy did not accept this is a final
verdict and instead maintained that until Bohn contacted him to
say the debate '"has been canceled," it was, as far as Guy was
concerned, still scheduled.
'I he fall incident of a folk music group being denied
use of the nitery until it submitted a constitution to leg
islature is example enough to show that more than 200
other cam/his groups must abide by the rules—so tchy
can't Ihe Stan ford Left without dragging irrelevant issues
into the situation '.''
The literature circulated by this group has given some people
the unfortunate impression that the group was formed with the
thought in mind that their club wouldn't be
because of leftist views which might be expressed.
Bolm has said quite positively that he would like to see the
Left become a campus organization. But such a group should
realize that it will be procedurally treated no worse, but also no
better, than a Stanford Bight, a Stanford l)ead-(lenter, or a folk
music club.
There is a place for a forum of leftist thought at Stanford.
It is hoped that the Stanford Left will direct its efforts toward
presenting that forum rather than wasting its time trying to prove
that everyone is against it.

The issue, in brief, has been whether President John Bohn's
cancellation of a debate last week was legal under the constitu
tion. The debate was arranged under sponsorship of the MR, but
all publicity matter said sponsorship was by the Stanford Left,
with no mention of 118. The Left was a recently-formed organi

to operate on campus.

is in tin 7 introiluction of freedom of speech charges and
totalitarian charges by supporters of the Stanford Left

nature.
George Guy, 1-Glub president and spokesman for the Left at

no desire to abridge established rules of ASSIJ.

to operate within the rules. The group has bad two courses of

• Present a constitution for approval, which would make it
possible for the group to sponsor public meetings on campus.
• Present to legislature proposals to change rules for spon
soring such meetings if it is felt that present rules are unworkable
