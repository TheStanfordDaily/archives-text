'Difficulties'
Jul it or, The Daily:
The recent appearance of Stan
ford Left, encouraged mo in Ihe
belief that Stanford had come of
age and that its students were
capable of independent thought.
Since the founding of the or
ganization, however, certain "ad
ministrative difficulties" have sev
eral times prevented the group
from holding its first meeting. . . .
There will he plenty <>1 time for
all of us in later life to kowtow tu
the "safe," acceptable ideas of Ihe
majority. Yet the ASSIJ, by dis
couraging Stanford Left, seems to
be attempting to hasten the happy
day when we can all stop thinking
for ourselves and start conform
ing.
If this University has any pre
tentions as a liberal institution, il
has the duty to accord to Stanford

| Left Ihe use of suitable facili
! i ies. . . .

Editor, I fie Daily:
I have been following the recent
; exchange of letters on Dr. Ken
dall with great interest. I am not
I an exponent of either side but 1
[am convinced that there is a real
issue here. The first person 1 talk
ed to about Dr. Kendall last fall
1 called him a fascist. This is a seri
ous charge and T don't think any
reasonable person would believe
it without proof.
If il is true, I see no value in
retaining such a man. If it is not,
perhaps he will fill a gap in our
Political Science Department, even
if the rest of the staff do not agree
with him.
Although student opinion will
not, of course, influence the Uni

versity, I feel thai forming a fair
and accurate judgment by each
student, in this controversy which
has such obvious importance in its
implications about academic free
dom is incumbent on those who
maintain that a university should
have absolute academic freedom.
