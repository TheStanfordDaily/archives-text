## The 						Annual Headache 
### 
The Foreign Aid Bill, which
calls for money to be spent in
foreign countries, is an annual
spring headache for the United
States Congress. This year it is
more of a headache than ever,
what with Hie deficit which puts
the President in the position of
wanting to save at home in order
to be able to spend abroad.
Poor Cause
This difficulty is compounded
by the fact that the bill, as it
comes from the Administration,
inspires no enthusiasm and little
confidence. For the men who have
to lead the fight for foreign aid,
it is a very poor cause in which to ,
enlist their effort. This Adminis-;
(ration bill, which was shaped not
by the Department of State but by
the Bureau of the Budget, is an
inefficient bill.
The way it provides for for
eign aid in annual installments
prevents a constructive use of
the foreign aid, which requires
I lie long-term planning of in
vestment.
It is necessary, therefore, to
amend the President's hill in order j
to have a measure behind which
the believers in foreign aid, who
are a multitude, can, with a good
conscience, rally. This is the pur
pose of the Fulbright amend
ments, which were introduced a
while ago.
Draper Committee
T think it is fair to say that
these amendments take account, i
which the Administration bill does I
not, of the findings of the Draper !
Committee which the President
himself appointed. They reflect
also the views of Secretary I lei -
tor and of Under Secretary Dillon, i

Tin* Fulhrlght amendments
follow two main principles. One
is to provide lor a period of live
years enough funds lo permit
development loans al the annual
rate ol IS I.f) billions.
The other principle of the Fill
bright amendments is to de-em
phasi/e without abolishing the
military pari of foreign aid.
