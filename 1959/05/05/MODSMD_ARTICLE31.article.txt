# Papooses Capture Little Big Meet
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
Stanford's freshman track
learn salvaged some glory in an
n< h*»r«dse bleak spike day at
Berkeley .Saturday, as the Pa
pooses ran away from the Cal
yearling spikers. Strangely
enough, the frosh won by the
same score by which the varsity
Io.M,
Big man for the Papooses was
Don Bell, who won iho shot put
with a winning heave of 17-2 :! 4
and bettered his own week-old
record in the discus.
Bell —New Kecord
A week ago Bell broke Bob Ma
thias' old Stanford frosh discus
record and at Cal broke his own
mark with a toss of 158-5. This
throw also set a new Cal meet
record, eclipsing Ihe record of
152-10% set by Mathias in 1950.
For good measure, Bell took a
second in the 220-yard low hur
dles, behind Papoose Ernie Fox.
Fox was Stanford's only other
double winner, taking both the
high and low hurdles with marks
of 15.6 and 21.5, respectively.
Rich Klier, the Papooses' great
half-miler who earlier in the year
had equaled Ihe frosh record,
missed by one-tenlh of a second
doing il again. In a completely I
impressed SSO, Klier ripped off a I
winning time of 1:54.(1, finishing
far ahead of second-place team i
mate Kim Maxwell. Maxwell also
ran second in the mile, this time|
to Cal star Woody Covington.
Wills Wins Two
The only double winner for Cal j
was sprinter Bob Wills. The for- j
mer Michigan prep star, who is
also a prime Bear- football pros
pect, reeled off times of 10 flat
and 21.5 in winning the 100- and
220-yard dashes.
Stanford's Cibhie Lenz turned
in a best-ever effort of 13-2 in
easily winning the pole vault. Pa
poose Mike Shirley was far back
in second and Cal's best vaulter
managed only 10-6.
Moore Missed
The only sweep of the after
noon came for* the Cubs in the
broad jump. Stan for d ' s Dan
Moore, who leaped 23-9 last week,
was out of action with a groin
injury and Cal's jumpers took
all three places with the winning
leap only 21-1. Moore's absence
also meant fewer hurdle points
for the Papooses.
Ait Batchelder came through,
as expected, with a javelin vic
tory, hurling the spear IJSX feet
7 inches. The high jump saw a
slight reversal of form. Favored
Marlin Walling, who has gone (5-5
this year, was second at 5-10
while teammate Rune Engebret-!
sen won the event with a leap of
0-2.

winning time of 1:54.(1, finishing
far ahead of second-place team i
mate Kim Maxwell. Maxwell also
ran second in the mile, this time|
to Cal star Woody Covington.
Wills Wins Two
The only double winner for Cal j
was sprinter Bob Wills. The for- j
mer Michigan prep star, who is
also a prime Bear- football pros
pect, reeled off times of 10 flat
and 21.5 in winning the 100- and
220-yard dashes.
Stanford's Cibhie Lenz turned
in a best-ever effort of 13-2 in
easily winning the pole vault. Pa
poose Mike Shirley was far back
in second and Cal's best vaulter
managed only 10-6.
Moore Missed
The only sweep of the after
noon came for* the Cubs in the
broad jump. Stan for d ' s Dan
Moore, who leaped 23-9 last week,
was out of action with a groin
injury and Cal's jumpers took
all three places with the winning
leap only 21-1. Moore's absence
also meant fewer hurdle points
for the Papooses.
Ait Batchelder came through,
as expected, with a javelin vic
tory, hurling the spear IJSX feet
7 inches. The high jump saw a
slight reversal of form. Favored
Marlin Walling, who has gone (5-5
this year, was second at 5-10
while teammate Rune Engebret-!
