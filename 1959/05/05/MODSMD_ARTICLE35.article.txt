# 'Whit,' Spartan Netters Face Tribe Here Today
## 
### 
The third and final meeting of
the season between the Stanford
tennis team and the Whitney
Reed led netters from San Jose
State College will take place this
afternoon at 2:30 at San Jose.
This season the Spartans have
nudged out the Indians in the
Northern California Intercolle
giate Championships by two
points, but the Stanfordites came
back to whip San Jose in an early
April dual match 7-2.
The two teams will be playing
another dual match today. The
Indian netters have lost only one
dual match against collegiate op
position this year, that to UCLA,
while they have won seven. San
Jose has lost both to the Indians
and UCLA.
Stanford's lineup of Dave Nel
son, Dick Ogden, Lowell Carruth.
Brooks Rawlins, Jim Jeffries and
Dick Gould in the one through
six spots will remain the same
for today's match.
San Jose will be their usual
strong at number one and two
with Whitney Reed, who recent
ly was just nosed out in three
sets by the world's number one
amateur, Alex Olmedo, playing
one, and steady Jim Watson at
two.
Depth, however, should be the

key factor as it was in the earlier
San Jose Stanford match and in
this department Stanford is much
more heavily endowed with tal
ent.
