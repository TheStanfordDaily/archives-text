### Stan Hulett 
Spring fool hall's days arc num
j bored. Two weeks from Saturday
lite footballers will lake the field
to do battle with the Stanford
Alumni, a team boasting such fa
mous names as John Brodie, Hob
by Garrett, Paul Wiggin and Bob
j Mathias.
Thus far the emphasis in spring
practice has been on getting a look
at the new talent and watching
Hie improvement shown by the
old laces from last year.
< nit ice Pleased
Coach Jack Curtice has been
pleased w i I h the showing, and
feels that he is getting the most
possible out of spring football.
Curtice said that the boys have
been working very hard and .how
a very definite improvement over'
last year.
Last Saturday the gridders
bumped heads in the first scrim
mage of the spring. All of the
squad saw action in a 3 1 i hour
1 affair.
Hitisiiaw Greally Improved
Tackle I>ean liinshaw, a (>(> 235
pounder from Willows, has shown
tremendous improvement at the
tackle spot. liinshaw. according
to Curtice, could be one of the top
j tackles in Stanford history. He
has all the requisites for this
j si/e, good movements and most of
all, desire. This has been the ma
jor factor in his favor. Curtice
says liinshaw is a hard worker
; and has the desire that is needed
to be a top notch player.
Although the Indians will em
| ploy the same basic formation
that was used last year, the per
sonnel has been changed some
what. Sid Gat her has moved from
[the crowded quarterback spot to
I fullback, and Trev Grimm and
j Gary Pike have made the big
i move to tackle.
Team Has Toughened Up
Everybody has improved since
j last season, according to Curtice,
and now that spring practice has
■ really moved into full swing, the
; boys are starling lo get "liard-
I nosed."

Other linemen who have lookee
good thus far are Larry Lacey
Phil Burkland, Tom Walsh am
Doiq; Pursell. The big emphasi
in the haekfield has been on llu
quarterbacks, with two very lin«

jassers vying lor the lead spot.
