The"I" Center's sidewalk cafe wasn't complete enough to open
last weekend but is expected to open shortly. Corporation Yard
employees finished the construction of the kitchenette (back
ground) and volunteers have almost finished laying the brick
patio. The cafe will serve espresso coffee and Danish pastry after
noons and evenings on weekdays, and afternoons on Saturday and
Sunday.
