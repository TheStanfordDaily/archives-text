In defining Saturday evening's
meeting as a discussion rather
than a debate, Mr. Kendall sug
gested that debate is the sign of
modern decadence, of minds un
sure ol themselves. Mr. Kendall
seems to think the purpose of dis
cussion is to discover how far
ti'om The Right his adversary is.
Mr. Kendall knows a closed is
sue when he sees one. In this
way he places himself in the tra
dition of the great orthodox
Church - the Council of Con
.stance did not bother to debate
with John Huss, but they did al
low him to bellow his views into
the flames that burned him.
11 Mr. Kendall refused to de
bate because the issues were
closed, Stanford students seem to
avoid debate for other reasons.
Confusing an open mind with an
empty mind, these students like
to "discuss" issues, hut refrain
from drawing conclusions which
lead to action.
They prefer to think of these
practical issues as purely theo
retical, and thus "understand the
problem away" in a Panglossian
manner.
When a practical issue arises,
the traditional way prevails. Mr.
Kendall decides lo do things tra
ditionally; Stanford students just

do things traditionally. But is it
a sign of decadence for a man to
debate by his own basic premises
and yet be guided by them till he
discovers better ones?

Editor, The Daily:
I would question I he wisdom of
having Tom Mboya address an
audience with little knowledge of
African affairs, without allowing
any opportunity for questions.
Mr. Mboya's account of the con
temporary African scene was less
than honest, as a result of his
many serious omissions. The
"Mau Mau" reign of terror, Gha
na's dubious methods of "demo
cratic" government, British plans
for Nigeria's independence and
the Central African Federation
are several of the many pertinent
points upon which Mr. Mboya
could have enlightened us. If he
had to leave so soon, Mr. Mboya
should have shortened his talk or
started an hour earlier.
That we British are "wicked co
lonialists" has, apparently, been
proved beyond doubt, but there is
more than one side to even this
question.

bate because the issues were
closed, Stanford students seem to
avoid debate for other reasons.
Confusing an open mind with an
empty mind, these students like
to "discuss" issues, hut refrain
from drawing conclusions which
lead to action.
They prefer to think of these
practical issues as purely theo
retical, and thus "understand the
problem away" in a Panglossian
manner.
When a practical issue arises,
the traditional way prevails. Mr.
Kendall decides lo do things tra

do things traditionally. But is it

debate by his own basic premises
and yet be guided by them till he
discovers better ones?

I would question I he wisdom of
having Tom Mboya address an
audience with little knowledge of
African affairs, without allowing
any opportunity for questions.
Mr. Mboya's account of the con
temporary African scene was less
than honest, as a result of his
many serious omissions. The
"Mau Mau" reign of terror, Gha
na's dubious methods of "demo
cratic" government, British plans
for Nigeria's independence and
the Central African Federation
are several of the many pertinent
points upon which Mr. Mboya
could have enlightened us. If he
had to leave so soon, Mr. Mboya
should have shortened his talk or
started an hour earlier.
That we British are "wicked co
lonialists" has, apparently, been
proved beyond doubt, but there is
more than one side to even this
question.

In defining Saturday evening's
meeting as a discussion rather
than a debate, Mr. Kendall sug
gested that debate is the sign of
modern decadence, of minds un
sure ol themselves. Mr. Kendall
seems to think the purpose of dis
cussion is to discover how far
ti'om The Right his adversary is.
Mr. Kendall knows a closed is
sue when he sees one. In this
way he places himself in the tra
dition of the great orthodox
Church - the Council of Con

with John Huss, but they did al
low him to bellow his views into
the flames that burned him.
