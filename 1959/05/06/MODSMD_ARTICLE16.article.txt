# Legislature to Begin Discussion Of Rushing Recommendations
## 
### John Nickerson Chairman, LASSU Rushing Committee 
When Student Body Vice-President Carolee
Houser raps the gavel next Thursday evening, the
Legislature will hegin discussions on whai may
well prove to he a very controversial problem.
The issue: how lo improve Ihe existing rushing
program.
Discussion hy Legislature has grown out of an
investigating body which two weeks ago consid
ered the effectiveness of the present program and
the changes thai were necessary to improve it.
Among I hose on the commit te were Neal Schei
del, IPC president; Jim Ukropina, IPC Judicial
Council chairman; A 1 Martin, Wilbur head spon
sor, and Clyde Wyanl, ICC president. Legislative
members serving were Dick Clot feller and Pele
Erlin, Men's Row representatives; Leo Krulitz,
Stanford Daily editor, and Jerry Majer, Wilbur
represent alive.
Seven Proposals
The findings of the committee are embodied in
seven basic proposals for next year. The first,
and easily the most holly disputed of these, is the
question of sophomore year rushing. Briefly
stated, the advantages of such a plan are as fol
lows:
• Pre-sophomore year rushing would serve to
improve the Wilbur program considerably. The
social cohesiveness of the houses in Wilbur suffers
tremendously under a spring quarter rushing pro
gram. Furthermore, many freshmen would find
it to their advantage to have a full year rather
than two quarters in which to adjust to campus
life.before rushing begins.
• Spring quarter is already burdened with in
numerable social activities. For this reason, a
spring quarter filled with open houses and pledge
activities only serves to underemphasize further
.the importance of academic studies. The only so
lution is to place rushing outside of the academic
year.
• If pre-sophomore year rushing were coupled

wiih an open contact system, the freshman woul<
have a considerably longer period of time dining
which to look over a fraternity or club befon
making bis decision.
• By moving rushing into sophomore year am
abolishing the no-contact rule, the psychology ol
rushing would be changed. Fraternities and clubs
understanding rushing as a sophomore year propo
sit ion, would tend to become more and more low
pressured in I heir rushing techniques.
Six-Two Decision
Finding thai the disadvantages of sophomore
year rushing outweigh the advantages, the com
mittee voted six-tolwo against the plan. The rea
sons:
• There are a number of housing problems
Those men who are undecided as to whether or
not they wish to rush will have to declare an in
lention to remain independent during their fresh
man year in order to obtain space in Stern Hall.
All those who rush and are not invited lo join ;i
fraternity or club will he forced to move off cam
pus unless some provision is made for them ahead
of time by the housing office.
• Because rushing will occupy the short space
of one week before the beginning of autumn quar
ter, the sophomore will be pressured to join a
group quickly.
• Pre-sophomore year rushing would work to
disrupt the present work-week schedule of the
fraternities, which is usually held the week before
autumn quarter and is conducted by sophomore
pledges.
• National house clauses require that: a new
member must remain ;i pledge for a certain pe
riod of lime before becoming active. Pre-sopho
more year rushing would mean that a man would
be living in a house as a pledge for ;i probable
minimum of six months.
• Under a sophomore year rushing program,
rijshees would lose the opportunity of obtaining
advice from sponsors. While doubtless many fresh
men do not need this advice, some would find it
invaluable in making a decision.

members serving were Dick Clot feller and Pele
Erlin, Men's Row representatives; Leo Krulitz,
Stanford Daily editor, and Jerry Majer, Wilbur
represent alive.
Seven Proposals
The findings of the committee are embodied in
seven basic proposals for next year. The first,
and easily the most holly disputed of these, is the
question of sophomore year rushing. Briefly
stated, the advantages of such a plan are as fol
lows:
• Pre-sophomore year rushing would serve to
improve the Wilbur program considerably. The
social cohesiveness of the houses in Wilbur suffers
tremendously under a spring quarter rushing pro
gram. Furthermore, many freshmen would find
it to their advantage to have a full year rather
than two quarters in which to adjust to campus
life.before rushing begins.
• Spring quarter is already burdened with in
numerable social activities. For this reason, a
spring quarter filled with open houses and pledge
activities only serves to underemphasize further
.the importance of academic studies. The only so
lution is to place rushing outside of the academic
year.
• If pre-sophomore year rushing were coupled

wiih an open contact system, the freshman woul<
have a considerably longer period of time dining
which to look over a fraternity or club befon
making bis decision.
• By moving rushing into sophomore year am
abolishing the no-contact rule, the psychology ol
rushing would be changed. Fraternities and clubs
understanding rushing as a sophomore year propo
sit ion, would tend to become more and more low
pressured in I heir rushing techniques.
Six-Two Decision
Finding thai the disadvantages of sophomore
year rushing outweigh the advantages, the com
mittee voted six-tolwo against the plan. The rea
sons:
• There are a number of housing problems
Those men who are undecided as to whether or
not they wish to rush will have to declare an in
lention to remain independent during their fresh
man year in order to obtain space in Stern Hall.
All those who rush and are not invited lo join ;i
fraternity or club will he forced to move off cam
pus unless some provision is made for them ahead
of time by the housing office.
• Because rushing will occupy the short space
of one week before the beginning of autumn quar
ter, the sophomore will be pressured to join a
group quickly.
• Pre-sophomore year rushing would work to
disrupt the present work-week schedule of the
fraternities, which is usually held the week before
autumn quarter and is conducted by sophomore
pledges.
• National house clauses require that: a new
member must remain ;i pledge for a certain pe
riod of lime before becoming active. Pre-sopho
more year rushing would mean that a man would
be living in a house as a pledge for ;i probable
minimum of six months.
• Under a sophomore year rushing program,
rijshees would lose the opportunity of obtaining
advice from sponsors. While doubtless many fresh
men do not need this advice, some would find it
invaluable in making a decision.
When Student Body Vice-President Carolee
Houser raps the gavel next Thursday evening, the
Legislature will hegin discussions on whai may
well prove to he a very controversial problem.
The issue: how lo improve Ihe existing rushing
program.
Discussion hy Legislature has grown out of an
investigating body which two weeks ago consid
ered the effectiveness of the present program and
the changes thai were necessary to improve it.
