# VIEWPOINT
## Wage Bill Postponed 
### Howard Richards 
Consideration of Governor
Brown's bill to establish a 90 cent
an hour minimum wage for farm
workers has been postponed by
the California State Senate on the
grounds that "the legislature has
never made an official study of
the measure."
Assemblyman Gus Hawkins (D-
L.A.) commented on the supposed
grounds for the postponement by
saying "I've been studying the
measure since 1935."
Problems faced by California
farm laborers fall roughly into
three areas:
WAGES: Most work is done by
the piece, often at rates amount
ing to as lit lie as 40 cents an hour.
The lucky lew rise from piece
work to work by the hour; hourly
rates range from 70 cents to $1.25
an hour. The average is less than
$1 an hour.
HOURS: It is customary lo hold
workers in the fields all day while
employing them only intermit
tently. Working by the piece, they
are. of course, paid only for the
work they do, not for their hours
of wailing. When there is work,
a ten hour day is a minimum. My
brother and I spent four days
working with the farm laborers
last summer and were once asked
to report for work at 5 in the
morning and not. released until
9:30 thai nigh!. Al many reasons
of the year, however, there is no
work at all. Thirty-two weeks of
work a year is typical.
RIGHTS: The farm laborers are
uneducated and unorganized; they
find it very difficult to enforce
promises made to Ihem by their
employers.
Others aspects of Ihe problem
follow from these conditions of
employment — children who will
noi be educated because they must
follow the crops, poor nutrition,
breakdown in sex mores, inade
quate housing.
The 90 cent minimum wage bill
will be considered again in 11)61.
A loud protest over this year's
failure will help by showing that
the people of California are not
insensitive to the needs of an un
fortunate and virtually powerless
minority.
It is barely possible that Gover
nor Brown will call a special ses
sion sometime before 1961 to deal
with the minimum wage measure.
I urge all Stanford students to
write to their slate senator to pro
test and to Governor Brown to en
courage him lo keep trying.

employing them only intermit
tently. Working by the piece, they
are. of course, paid only for the
work they do, not for their hours
of wailing. When there is work,
a ten hour day is a minimum. My
brother and I spent four days
working with the farm laborers
last summer and were once asked
to report for work at 5 in the
morning and not. released until
9:30 thai nigh!. Al many reasons
of the year, however, there is no
work at all. Thirty-two weeks of
work a year is typical.
RIGHTS: The farm laborers are
uneducated and unorganized; they
find it very difficult to enforce
promises made to Ihem by their
employers.
Others aspects of Ihe problem
follow from these conditions of
employment — children who will
noi be educated because they must
follow the crops, poor nutrition,
breakdown in sex mores, inade
quate housing.
The 90 cent minimum wage bill
will be considered again in 11)61.
A loud protest over this year's
failure will help by showing that
the people of California are not
insensitive to the needs of an un
fortunate and virtually powerless
minority.
It is barely possible that Gover
nor Brown will call a special ses
sion sometime before 1961 to deal
with the minimum wage measure.
I urge all Stanford students to
write to their slate senator to pro
test and to Governor Brown to en
courage him lo keep trying.

Consideration of Governor
Brown's bill to establish a 90 cent
an hour minimum wage for farm
workers has been postponed by
the California State Senate on the
grounds that "the legislature has
never made an official study of
the measure."
Assemblyman Gus Hawkins (D-
L.A.) commented on the supposed
grounds for the postponement by
saying "I've been studying the
measure since 1935."
Problems faced by California
farm laborers fall roughly into
three areas:
WAGES: Most work is done by
the piece, often at rates amount
ing to as lit lie as 40 cents an hour.
The lucky lew rise from piece
work to work by the hour; hourly
rates range from 70 cents to $1.25
an hour. The average is less than
$1 an hour.
HOURS: It is customary lo hold
workers in the fields all day while
employing them only intermit
tently. Working by the piece, they
are. of course, paid only for the
work they do, not for their hours
of wailing. When there is work,
