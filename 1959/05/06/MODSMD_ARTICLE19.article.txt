. . . There are good reasons
for not asking Professor Kendal)
o come hack. At last Saturday's
debate, for example, it seemed to
ne and a lot ol other people that
he snide innuendos and plain in 1
;ulls he directed at Mr. Sibley
A/ere definitely below the stand
ird of plain decency and main
city that a University ought to i
iemand ol its professors, regard- 1
ess of their point ol view.
He started his talk by decrying;
he way The I)aily had advertised
the debate like a gladiatorial con
est; he deplored the fact that too'
nany people these days spend
heir time in bickering debates
ind have lost the art of free and
open discussion.
Then without blinking an eye
he launched into some of the dir-!
liest debate tactics I have ever I
seen: he called Sibley a heretic, j
a barbarian, a parasite, and even
strongly implied that he was a
simpleton, by concluding in dis- 1
gustingly chummy confidence to!
the audience that Sibley's trouble'
was that he just couldn't grasp
the issues.
I am not a pacifist, but I would
hale to have to admit that what
Professor Kendall offered is the:
only alternative. . . .
