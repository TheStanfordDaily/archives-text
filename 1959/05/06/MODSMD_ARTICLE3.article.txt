# Stanford Debaters Reclaim Medaille Joffre From Cal
## 
### Gary Wright 
Stanford's Lester O'Shea topped five other Stanford-Cal speakers
by placing first in last night's sixty-fifth annual 'Medaille Joffre"
debate.
Placing second in the .judging was Stanford's Daniel Kremer, with
teammate Jack Rolls tied for third place with Cal's Arnc Werchick.

With the general topic being'
"The Future of France," the
speakers were informed of the
exact subject only some three and
a half hours previous to the ac
tual debate. O'Shea took a nega
tive stand on the specific subject
chosen, "Resolved: Thai France
in her own best interest should
grant Algeria a degree of auton
omy similar to that of Tunisia."
O'Shea's approach to the reso
lution illustrated the danger of
leaving Algeria in Ihe hands of a ;
rebel - inspired government, and I
pointed out the military bases
and oil lands that France would
be renouncing if she released Al-;
gcria.
In O'Shea's rebuttal of all pri
mary presentations, he pointed
out that the question of the eve-1
ning was related only to the fu
ture and interests of France her
self, not to the question of Alge- j
rian readiness for independence.
Krcmer spoke for the affirma
tive, stressing the necessity of
separate "friendly" nations in
stead of semi - hostile mother
country territory relations. He
saw a degree of autonomy as a
necessity to prevent the wealth of j
France from being poured into
an unproductive effort. A friend
ly settlement instead of an open j
revolt was the only solution.
"France lies bleeding" in the
vjew of third-place Rolls, prima
rily due to the tremendous capi
tal being wasted on expensive
French military forces in Alge
ria. He saw the French-Algerian j
situation as France's most detri
mental political maneuver, and
I referred often to the effects of i
J France's "political black eye." j

Held as part of the Tuesday
Evening Series this year, the an
nual debate proved to be Stan
ford's first win in the intercol
legiate debate since 1954.
Presenting the medal to O'Shca
was Didier de Mossey, Consul of
France.

DEBATER'S EYE VIEW
Joffre debate drew small crowd ,
Stanford's Lester O'Shea topped five other Stanford-Cal speakers
by placing first in last night's sixty-fifth annual 'Medaille Joffre"
debate.
Placing second in the .judging was Stanford's Daniel Kremer, with
teammate Jack Rolls tied for third place with Cal's Arnc Werchick.

With the general topic being'
"The Future of France," the
speakers were informed of the
exact subject only some three and
a half hours previous to the ac
tual debate. O'Shea took a nega
tive stand on the specific subject
chosen, "Resolved: Thai France
in her own best interest should
grant Algeria a degree of auton
omy similar to that of Tunisia."
O'Shea's approach to the reso
lution illustrated the danger of
leaving Algeria in Ihe hands of a ;
rebel - inspired government, and I
pointed out the military bases
and oil lands that France would
be renouncing if she released Al-;
gcria.
In O'Shea's rebuttal of all pri
mary presentations, he pointed
out that the question of the eve-1
ning was related only to the fu
ture and interests of France her
self, not to the question of Alge- j
rian readiness for independence.
Krcmer spoke for the affirma
tive, stressing the necessity of
separate "friendly" nations in
stead of semi - hostile mother
country territory relations. He
saw a degree of autonomy as a
necessity to prevent the wealth of j
France from being poured into
an unproductive effort. A friend
ly settlement instead of an open j
revolt was the only solution.
"France lies bleeding" in the
vjew of third-place Rolls, prima
rily due to the tremendous capi
tal being wasted on expensive
French military forces in Alge
ria. He saw the French-Algerian j
situation as France's most detri
mental political maneuver, and
I referred often to the effects of i
J France's "political black eye." j
