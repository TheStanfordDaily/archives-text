# Psych Club Started
## 
### 
A Psychology Club has been
organized on campus. It was
started last quarter in an effort
to extend to undergraduate psy
chology majors the benefits that
graduate majors receive from
their seminars.
The main efforts of the club
are directed four ways: to bring
psychology majors together, to
get noted speakers in the field of
psychology to give talks here, to
improve relations between stu
dents and department faculty
members and to organize field
trips to places of interest.
Activities in the offing for the
rest of this quarter are faculty

open houses and at the next
meeting, May 21, Dr. Edmund
Bolkart, head of the Sociology
Department, will speak. Field
trips will begin next quarter.
Officers for this quarter are:
President, John Gilles; vice-presi
dent, Serena Auster; secretary,
Marion Prentiss; treasurer, Lin
da Hansen; assistant to the presi
dent, Browning Hoffman. Dr.
Ernest Hilgard is faculty adviser.
The Psych Club meets twice a
month. Membership is primarily
for psychology majors. The pub
lic is welcome at lectures and
talks.
