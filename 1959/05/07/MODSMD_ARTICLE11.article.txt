# Joey's 'Pals' Make Show Big Success
## 
### 
liy Mary Lou Mckinley
Moving along through a pano
rama of lavish sets and costumes,
ja/./.y orchestration and good
dance routines, Joey's pals car
ried the show last night in Memo
rial Auditorium when the curtain
came up al 8:30 on Ram's Head's
"Pal Joey."
The production's big show-stop
per came in the second act with
the snappy "Zip," sung by Jaque
Wood as Melba, the newspaper
reporter. Miss Wood's one ap
pearance? was clever and polished
and showed that spark which

should have characterized the
whole show.
Vera, the society woman who
gives Joey his own night club,
was characterized well by Dolo
res Bernhard, whose full voice
and capable talent, however, were
hampered by inadequate direc
tion. Because of this, "Bewitched,
Bothered and Bewildered," which
should have been her big number,
fell short of expectations.
Refreshing Lift
The ingenue, Linda English,
was played by Carol McKanna
whose delightful voice and natu

ral spark Rave a refreshing lift
to the show whenever she ap
peared.
Several of the minor character
izations were very well done and
came through polished and clear.
Rusty D'Anna was especially
good in his portrayal of Mike,
Joey's former boss, and Doug
Johnson was excellent in the part
of a stuffy tailor.
Also in minor roles, two dogs
nearly succeeded in stealing the
show in the"I Could Write a
Book" number, their well-done
yips coming through clearly
above the music and orchestra.
The orchestra was one of the
best a Ham's Head show has ever
had. Under the capable direction
of John Miller, the music was ap
propriately snappy and well
played, with most vocal numbers
holding their own above the or
chestra.
Good Tech Work
Also outstanding in the show
was the technical coordination.
Scenes were shifted smoothly and
quickly in either blackout pauses
or behind the effective, big-city
backdrop, giving a continuity to
the show which has been lacking
in previous Ram's Head produc
tions.
The biggest technical fault was
the lack of adequate spot lights
and travel lights as many of the
characters in supposed big num
bers seemed lost against the
stage sets.
The showy costumes and sets
were to Noel Turner's credit,
with the "Chez Joey" scene ful
filling all expectations. The cho
rus girls' six costume changes
were colorful and splashy, just
what the burlesque-type routines
demanded.
Leanne Boccardo as choreogra
pher did a good job with the six
night-club-,performance numbers.
The dance steps were well put to
gether and appropriately moti
vated, and, although the motiva
tion dwarfed the steps in places,
the chorus line looked good and
performed more than adequately.
Lynnc Chatterton was perfect
as the floozy, head chorus girl
Gladys Bumps.
Weak Characterization
Unfortunately, Dick Lamb ei
ther should have directed the
show or starred in it not both,
as his performances in both ca
pacities suffered from the combi
nation. An excellent dancer and a
not-bad singer, Lamb seemed to
have all the necessary qualifica
tions for a good "Joey," but iu
most of the show his characteri
zation just didn't come through.
Fortunately for the show, how
ever, Joey's "pals" (the other
characters mentioned above) and
the over-all lavishness of the pro
duction were enough to support
the show over the rough spots.
Tickets, still on sale at Memo
rial Auditorium box office and on
Quad, are well worth the prices,
$1 .7."), $1.50 and $1.25. It's a big
package of entertainment any
way you look at it.

was characterized well by Dolo
res Bernhard, whose full voice
and capable talent, however, were
hampered by inadequate direc

Bothered and Bewildered," which
should have been her big number,
fell short of expectations.
Refreshing Lift
The ingenue, Linda English,
was played by Carol McKanna
whose delightful voice and natu

ral spark Rave a refreshing lift
to the show whenever she ap
peared.
Several of the minor character
izations were very well done and
came through polished and clear.
Rusty D'Anna was especially
good in his portrayal of Mike,
Joey's former boss, and Doug
Johnson was excellent in the part
of a stuffy tailor.
Also in minor roles, two dogs
nearly succeeded in stealing the
show in the"I Could Write a
Book" number, their well-done
yips coming through clearly
above the music and orchestra.
The orchestra was one of the
best a Ham's Head show has ever
had. Under the capable direction
of John Miller, the music was ap
propriately snappy and well
played, with most vocal numbers
holding their own above the or
chestra.
Good Tech Work
Also outstanding in the show
was the technical coordination.
Scenes were shifted smoothly and
quickly in either blackout pauses
or behind the effective, big-city
backdrop, giving a continuity to
the show which has been lacking
in previous Ram's Head produc
tions.
The biggest technical fault was
the lack of adequate spot lights
and travel lights as many of the
characters in supposed big num
bers seemed lost against the
stage sets.
The showy costumes and sets
were to Noel Turner's credit,
with the "Chez Joey" scene ful
filling all expectations. The cho
rus girls' six costume changes
were colorful and splashy, just
what the burlesque-type routines
demanded.
Leanne Boccardo as choreogra
pher did a good job with the six
night-club-,performance numbers.
The dance steps were well put to
gether and appropriately moti
vated, and, although the motiva
tion dwarfed the steps in places,
the chorus line looked good and
performed more than adequately.
Lynnc Chatterton was perfect
as the floozy, head chorus girl
Gladys Bumps.
Weak Characterization
Unfortunately, Dick Lamb ei
ther should have directed the
show or starred in it not both,
as his performances in both ca
pacities suffered from the combi
nation. An excellent dancer and a
not-bad singer, Lamb seemed to
have all the necessary qualifica
tions for a good "Joey," but iu
most of the show his characteri
zation just didn't come through.
Fortunately for the show, how
ever, Joey's "pals" (the other
characters mentioned above) and
the over-all lavishness of the pro
duction were enough to support
the show over the rough spots.
Tickets, still on sale at Memo
rial Auditorium box office and on
Quad, are well worth the prices,
$1 .7."), $1.50 and $1.25. It's a big
package of entertainment any
way you look at it.

nearly succeeded in stealing the
show in the"I Could Write a
Book" number, their well-done
yips coming through clearly
above the music and orchestra.
The orchestra was one of the
best a Ham's Head show has ever
had. Under the capable direction
of John Miller, the music was ap
propriately snappy and well
played, with most vocal numbers
holding their own above the or
chestra.
Good Tech Work
Also outstanding in the show
was the technical coordination.
Scenes were shifted smoothly and
quickly in either blackout pauses
or behind the effective, big-city
backdrop, giving a continuity to
the show which has been lacking
in previous Ram's Head produc
tions.
The biggest technical fault was
the lack of adequate spot lights
and travel lights as many of the
characters in supposed big num
bers seemed lost against the
stage sets.
The showy costumes and sets
were to Noel Turner's credit,
with the "Chez Joey" scene ful
filling all expectations. The cho
rus girls' six costume changes
were colorful and splashy, just
what the burlesque-type routines
demanded.
Leanne Boccardo as choreogra
pher did a good job with the six
night-club-,performance numbers.
The dance steps were well put to
gether and appropriately moti
vated, and, although the motiva
tion dwarfed the steps in places,
the chorus line looked good and
performed more than adequately.
Lynnc Chatterton was perfect
as the floozy, head chorus girl
Gladys Bumps.
Weak Characterization
Unfortunately, Dick Lamb ei
ther should have directed the
show or starred in it not both,
as his performances in both ca
pacities suffered from the combi
nation. An excellent dancer and a
not-bad singer, Lamb seemed to
have all the necessary qualifica
tions for a good "Joey," but iu
most of the show his characteri
zation just didn't come through.
Fortunately for the show, how
ever, Joey's "pals" (the other
characters mentioned above) and
the over-all lavishness of the pro
duction were enough to support
the show over the rough spots.
Tickets, still on sale at Memo
rial Auditorium box office and on
Quad, are well worth the prices,
$1 .7."), $1.50 and $1.25. It's a big
package of entertainment any
way you look at it.
