# This Point of View
## 'Radical Forum' Replies 
### Michael Freeman George Guy 
There have been a number of
misunderstandings of tlie intent
of the persons who are trying to
organize the Radical Forum, once
known as "Stanford Left," and
these misunderstandings are re
flected in the adverse comments
in Tuesday's Daily editorial.
The editorial states: "Where
the situation appears to be out of
proportion is in the introduction
of freedom of speech charges and
totalitarian charges by support
ers of the Stanford Left into an
issue which is in reality only of a
procedural nature."
Minor Rule
The position of the Left is that
freedom of speech is so important
that a debate on important and
controversial issues should not
be canceled because of an infrac
tion of a minor ASSU rule. We
agree that the situation is out of
proportionâ€”it is out of propor
tion because serious debates are
canceled for trivial reasons.
The editorial also states:
"George Guy, I-Club president
and spokesman for the Left at
Legislature, admitted the pub
licity error, and said the Left had
no desire to abridge established
rules of the ASSU."
"Stanford"
The "publicity error" consisted
of using the name "Stanford."
It would have been very simple
to drop the name "Stanford," and
in fact the Radical Forum indicat
ed its complete willingness to
drop the name prior to the can
cellation and even crossed out the
name on materials already print
ed.
But instead of forbidding the
use of the holy word, the ASSU
president canceled the debate. We
do not feel that his action is justi
fied by the letter of the rule; it
is justified only by a spirit of de
votion to petty bureaucracy.
Attempt to Comply
Next the editorial states: "Rut
while admitting the error, the
Left made no logical move to op
erate within the rules."
Here the Daily editor failed to
inform himself of the facts before
writing. The principal activity of
the Radical Forum has been at
tempting to comply with ASSU
rules; hours and hours that
should have gone into preparing
an important debate went into
obtaining clearance from no less
than five agencies.
When it became clear that the
Legislature would stand firm be
hind the president's action, the
Radical Forum immediately took
other steps to gain the light of
day.
New Tactics
Through the friendly guidance
of the officers of the Political
Union, the Radical Forum has de
vised a new way of arranging for
two people to have a debate with
each other.

First, a member of the Inde
pendent Caucus of the FU will
resign from that caucus and join
with one of our members, who
happens to be in the PU, to form
a Radical Left Caucus. (To form
a caucus one must have 10 per
cent of the membership of the
PU; there are 14 members, so two
are 10 per cent).
Caucus Meetings
Once the caucus is formed it
will rapidly have three meetings;
by attending the three caucus
meetings, our members- under
official ASSU rules will qualify
as members of the PU. Our mem
ber "borrowed" from the Inde
pendent Caucus will then be free
to resign and rejoin his own cau
cus.
By means of this holy ritual,
we hope 1o cleanse ourselves of
the sin "failing to abide by the
rules that govern 200 other cam
pus groups."
Suggestions
The editorial goes on to sug
gest that we (1) present a consti
tution, (2) suggest changes in the
ASSU rules, and implies that we
are guilty of obstinate rabble
rousing by not doing so.
On the contrary, the Radical
Forum planned to write a consti
tution as soon as possible. This
fact was communicated to the
president before he can
celed the debate. We asked only
for one public meeting in order
to attract members, and we ar
ranged for temporary sponsor
ship through the International
Club. The International Club ex
ecutive committee "adopted" us.
"Bill of Rights"
With regard to (2), we are
working on a "Student Bill of
Rights" for presentation in the
fall. We are seeking to have pres
ent. rules clarified by asking the
Judicial Council to rule on the
extent of the president's powers
to cancel student events.
The Radical Forum is accused
in the editorial of bringing in an
irrelevant issue by stressing the
importance of freedom of speech.
Yet we realized from our experi
ence with other organizations
that it is customary to overlook
the fine points of ASSU rules.
We cannot avoid suspecting
that if we had not chosen to de
bate "Resolved: that the institu
tion of private property" is im
! moral," but rather "Resolved:
; that Bacon is Shakespeare," we
would not have had the book
I thrown at us.
Healthy Effects
Nor can we avoid suspecting
j that our introduction of the issue
of freedom of speech has had two
healthy effects: (1) It has helped
to insure that the ASSU will not
1 censor student debates in the fu
ture. (2) It has pointed out that
j freedom of speech can be smoth
j ered quite as effectively by bu-
I reaucratic intransigence as by an
I outright ban.
