How would you like to get a
theme, term paper or blue book
back with a big orange sticker on
the front of it reading:
"THE ENGLISH IN THIS
PAPER IS NOT ACCEPT
ABLE"?
This is what professors at
George Washington University
are doing to let the students
know that other departments in
the university are concerned
about the quality of English used.
Other warnings in the sticker
may be checked off by depart
ment professors who think the
English used is not adequate.
These other warnings range from
"Your writing is careless" to
"The writing is so poor that it
has lowered your grade; take this
paper to the College Office," and
finally "Take this paper to the
English department and return it
to me with a note suggesting ac
tion within one week."
As if the course material

English Warnings Issued

weren't difficult enough, tliey
have to worry about English
too!

Of course, you must remember
that the Mama Bears at Berkeley
did win the NCAA basketball
championship a while back. Bed
lam broke loose in the little town
when students heard the news of
their win.
Students flocked to the Greek
Theater and Channing Circle for
impromptu rallies. A bonfire
rally and songfest was staged at
the Greek Theater.
A microphone was set up and
the principal speaker strolled up
to say a few words: "Well, I
guess the Big 'O' fell on his Big
•A.'"
Both rallies were well conduct
ed, and even the Berkeley police
were on the job. They couldn't
help but join in on the singing—
the gaiiic was carried over police
car radios at intermittent periods.
