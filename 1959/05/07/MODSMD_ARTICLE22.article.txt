# RUSHING
## LASSU to Discuss Six More Proposals 
### John Nickerson Chairman 
LASSU Hushing C.ommilloo
In addition to a consideration
of the advantages and disadvan
tages of pre - sophomore year
rushing, the Legislature will, in
Ihe nexl two weeks, be discussing
six other proposals delivered to
it by the subcommittee investi
gating rushing.
The first of these recommends
that a system of open houses be
established during winter quarter
each year in order to increase the
contact between fraternities and
freshmen.
The open house period would,
under this proposal, exist for five
consecutive days at the beginning
of winter quarter with no more
than three open houses allotted
to fraternities and no more than
three open houses allotted to
clubs. The vote of the committee
was 7 to 1 favoring this proposal.
Time Spent
The second proposal deals with
the amount of time to be devoted
to rushing during spring quarter.
The committee has recommended
that an eight-day rushing weeir
would be sufficient, if five open
houses were held during winter
quarter.
The proposal passed in com
mittee meeting by a vote of six
to-two. Those persons opposed to
it felt that eight days was not
quite enough time for an effec
tive rushing program.
Definitions
The third and fourth proposals
are for Legislature's endorsement
of the IFC'S and the ICC'S defini
tions of limited and open contact
respectively.
The IFC's definition of limited
contact reads as follows:
"Normal campus - wide social
and scholastic communications
are permissible between frater
nity personnel and freshmen, but
freshmen may not participate in
social activities sponsored by fra
ternities or groups of members

thereof. Freshmen may not enter :
into fraternity houses, and frater
nity personnel may not enter into
Wilbur Hall or freshman rooms
in Stern for any reason. A group
of three constitutes a house."
Open Contact
The ICC's definition of open
contact, meanwhile, states that
"Normal social and scholastic
contact is permissible at all
times."
Finally, the fifth and sixth pro
posals concern the application of
these definitions. Under the com
mittee's recommendations, limit
ed contact would be in effect for
the IPC from the opening of fall
quarter to the termination of win
ter quarter, including Christmas
vacation but excluding spring va-1
cation and with the exception of
the period set aside for open
houses during winter quarter.
Limited Contact
This proposal passed in com
mittee by a vote of five-to-one
with two abstentions. Two rea
sons were given for the limited
contact rule in the rushing situa
tion:
• II allows freshmen to be
come introduced to the entire
University environment gradual
ly-
• It prevents cut throat com
petition among fraternities.
Prevent Appreciation
On the other side, however, the
thought was advanced that a lim
ited contact system would pre
vent the freshmen from appre
ciating the social and cultural ad
vantages of the entire campus i
until very nearly the end of their
first year.
Meanwhile, the committee rec
ommended that ICC be allowed
to eixst under an open contact |
system at all times. In effect, |
this would mean that freshmen j
could visit eating clubs through
out the entire school year.
Rushing Differs
The seven committee members
who favored this proposal felt
that, because the eating club
rushing system differs markedly
from the fraternity program, the
clubs should be allowed to oper
ate within their own system as
they see fit.
Opposition to the plan was
raised in the belief that two sepa- j
rate rules of communications
would only tend to confuse the
freshmen and would in some
sense force them to decide be
tween clubs and fraternities be
fore the beginning of the rush- j
ing period.

Limited Contact
This proposal passed in com
mittee by a vote of five-to-one
with two abstentions. Two rea
sons were given for the limited
contact rule in the rushing situa
tion:
• II allows freshmen to be
come introduced to the entire
University environment gradual
ly-
• It prevents cut throat com
petition among fraternities.
Prevent Appreciation
On the other side, however, the
thought was advanced that a lim
ited contact system would pre
vent the freshmen from appre
ciating the social and cultural ad
vantages of the entire campus i
until very nearly the end of their
first year.
Meanwhile, the committee rec
ommended that ICC be allowed
to eixst under an open contact |
system at all times. In effect, |
this would mean that freshmen j
could visit eating clubs through
out the entire school year.
Rushing Differs
The seven committee members
who favored this proposal felt
that, because the eating club
rushing system differs markedly
from the fraternity program, the
clubs should be allowed to oper
ate within their own system as
they see fit.
Opposition to the plan was
raised in the belief that two sepa- j
rate rules of communications
would only tend to confuse the
freshmen and would in some
sense force them to decide be
tween clubs and fraternities be
fore the beginning of the rush- j
ing period.

In addition to a consideration
of the advantages and disadvan
tages of pre - sophomore year
rushing, the Legislature will, in
Ihe nexl two weeks, be discussing
six other proposals delivered to
it by the subcommittee investi
gating rushing.
The first of these recommends
that a system of open houses be
established during winter quarter
each year in order to increase the
contact between fraternities and
freshmen.
The open house period would,
under this proposal, exist for five
consecutive days at the beginning
of winter quarter with no more
than three open houses allotted
to fraternities and no more than
three open houses allotted to
clubs. The vote of the committee
was 7 to 1 favoring this proposal.
Time Spent
The second proposal deals with
the amount of time to be devoted
to rushing during spring quarter.
The committee has recommended
that an eight-day rushing weeir
would be sufficient, if five open
houses were held during winter
quarter.
The proposal passed in com
mittee meeting by a vote of six
to-two. Those persons opposed to
it felt that eight days was not
quite enough time for an effec
tive rushing program.
Definitions
The third and fourth proposals
are for Legislature's endorsement
of the IFC'S and the ICC'S defini
tions of limited and open contact
respectively.
The IFC's definition of limited
contact reads as follows:
"Normal campus - wide social
and scholastic communications
are permissible between frater
nity personnel and freshmen, but
freshmen may not participate in
social activities sponsored by fra
ternities or groups of members

thereof. Freshmen may not enter :
into fraternity houses, and frater
