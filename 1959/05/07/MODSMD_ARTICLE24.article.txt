(Fditor's Note: This: is the
first of a series of interviews
on I lie Peace Movement. In
connection with these ideas, a
panel of various speakers oil ;
the subject will be held next
Tuesday in Union Court. Stu
dents will also he polled to de
termine their views on the
means to achieve peace.)

The people of the United States
are not ready now to carry out a

p a s si v e resistance movement,
says Dr. Harry Rathbun, profes
sor of law. Unilateral disarma
ment is not immediately feasible.

However, we must continually
move toward it.
Dr. Rathbun was interviewed
in connection with the Peace
Movement which is being held at
Stanford during the next week.
The ob ject of this movement is to
encourage responsible thought
and discussion of the following
question: Can lasting world peace
and the containment of the Com
munist threat be achieved by pre
dominantly military power?
A society goes through several
stages in its development, con
tinued Dr. Rathbun. The stages
are anarchy, the vigilance com
mittee, law, mercy and finally
love. The United States is now
in that stage he designates "law."
lie added that some of our of
ficials act as if we were still in
the "vigilance" stage. They take
the law into their own hands and
make the crucial judgments and
decisions. The Atomic Energy
Commission has often actcd in
such a fashion.
The stage we are aiming at is
that of love. This step in the evo
lutionary process will not come
naturally. It will be achieved
only as the result of a conscious
choice and acting upon that
choice. Whether or not we move
in this direction depends to a
great extent upon education.
Dr. Rathbun's conviction in this
regard has led him into the educa
tion field. The university is one
of the best places to carry out the
type of education that is re
quired. Students must be contin
ually encouraged to question
themselves as to their own be
liefs and values. They must come

to love themselves before they
can love other people.
To know what one believes and
then io act upon those beliefs re
quires a disciplined search. Most
important, though, we need feel
ings to match our reasons.
I feel that Dr. Rathbun's con
cern is similar to that of Adlai
Stevenson, in speaking on educa
tion, Stevenson contended that to
day for the first time in history
it is no longer a question of
means but rather of ends.
We in the United States have
all the resources both human and
material to achieve any end. The
problem is that we are uncertain
about our ends; we are not even
sure that education is a primary
value.
