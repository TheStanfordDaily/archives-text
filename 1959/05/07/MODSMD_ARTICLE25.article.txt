This Is a Miserable Year?
Biggest headlines of the spring popped up last weekend when it
appeared that the Stanford baseball team was very close to represent
ing the CIBA in the first rounds of NCAA playoffs.
This is the team that was supposed to have a miserable year. And
suddenly il finds itself only three games (three Stanford wins or
California losses) away from playoffs.
It wasn't too long ago that Coach Dutch l<Vliring was sizing up
his prospects and. saying, "We have lots of good catchers . . . and
you may see one of them in that infield sooner or later. . .

So we have. Mike Magee, a
sophomore who played a year at
hong Beach City College and has
a fine prep and JC record as a
catcher, has been at second base
since early in March. And junior
•lay Winter has hit so well that he
seems to have wrapped up the
catching job, allowing two-year
veteran Art von Wronski to go
to the out field.
Magee has been "quarterback
ing" this Indian team from his
second base spot and it is prinei
ally because of him that the Tribe
has come up with an unexpected
ly brilliant double play combina
tion. Friday against Cal, Magee
was in the middle of four third
to second-to 1 irst twin killings.
At the plate, little Mike leads
the Cards in about every depart
ment, especially the important
extra base hit's and runs batted
in columns. At Cal Saturday, he
was four-for-five. N'o second base
troubles on this team.

This learn is in good shape, so to speak. Fehring suddenly is
confronted with one of those pleasant outfield, "problems." Von
Wronski, Ben Robinson, Rich DcFabio and sophomore Lee Moench
all have been hitting the ball with authority. And the speedster,
llarry Rodda, showed every indication of breaking out of his batting
slump when he tripled against IJSF last Tuesday and then drove
another one off the bank in Friday's Cal game.
Btirk is hitting better than ever; shortstop llal Schulzmann rap
ped his longest hits of the season at Berkeley Saturday.
Tough, consistent pitching is all the team needs if it has any
aspirations of going places after getting into the playoffs. Karl Rus
sell, IVlarv M«*cklenberg, Terry Lindeman arid Warren Nelson all have
had their moments this season but a reliable "stopper" is necessary
to go very far.
Southern C'al, which won Ihe national title last year, had Bill
Thorn, and C'al, which went all the way two years ago, had Doug
Weiss. The Cards could use the same kind of tough veteran.
PrHlv Fust Company for Milford
Rut there are oilier interesting things crossing, the sports desk
these days.
IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'KM JOIN 'EM DEPARTMENT? College
press agents sometimes go a bit overboard. UCLA did it last week
in a rather subtle way. In sizing up the Bruin-SC freshman track
meet: "Two frosh greats—Trobabe Dallas Long and Bruhabe Milford
Dahl —may steal the show."
Due respect to Milford Dahl, who runs everything from the 880
1o the two-mile in good not great—times. But Milford is hardly of
ihe caliber to rate in the same breath as a "great" along with Long,
who may be the greatest in the world.
As Maxwell Stiles wrote in the Los Angeles Mirror-News: ". . .
Dahl has run tin* mile in 4:14.5 and the two-mile in 9:19.2, the BXO
in 1:55.3. These times are okay by American standards, but Aus
tralia's Percy Cerntty | Herb Elliott's coach| would snort at them."
And if you think UCLA has come up with the ultimate in their
Ceylonese high jumper. Nagalingam Ethiveerasingam, you may be
interested in knowing that there is another Nagalingam wandering
around Westwood. He's Nagalingam Pararajasingam, a frosh quar
ter -miler and high jumper. But his 51.3 and 5-8 aren't so impressive.
INDIANS MAKE GOOD, FAST: Second baseman A 1 Shaw and
All-American catcher Ralph Holding, Stanford's top baseballers last
year, are already up to Class AA in the pro ranks. Both are now
with the Chicago Cubs' San Antonio Missions farm, in the Texas
League.
Former frosh hurler Steve Watson, an off-season student here,
is with Savannah of the Class A Sally League.
