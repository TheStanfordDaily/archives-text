# AT 5 EVERY MORNING
## ‘Amateur’ Crew Faces Big Tests DAILY Sports SCENE 
### John Osmundson 
"We get up at five every morn
ing and by six o'clock the boats
are on the water. The crews row
as hard as they can until seven,
then we go back for classes" so
said Kent Mitchell, one of iho cox
swains on (he Stanford varsity
crew, describing a daily morning
practice.
Crew retains its amateur spirit,
even when more and more colle
giate sports are falling into the
patterns of big business. Pub
licity agents, athletic directors
and high - paid coaches lure the
paying thousands and make ma
jor sports a financial success, Inn
crew still relies on volunteer sup
port.
Harbach, Huskies, Cal
Now the Stanford crew is fac
ing its three big ones: the Mar
bach Cup Saturday in Los Ange
les against UCLA and Southern
California; Washington, .next
week here, and Cal in two weeks
at the Oakland Estuary. Good
performances in these races may
mean a shot al Ihe IHi regatta at
Syracuse in June.
An oarsman who gives up val
liable study time to practice for
a season that totals little over
half an hour of racing must have
some definite answers to the
question of the casual observer:
why make the effort?
The answer c or t a in I y isn't
glamour. Clamour is usually left
to the football stars, basketball,
baseball and other major sport
participants. Crew, based al Red
wood City Yacht Harbor, remains
remarkably well hidden from the
public eye.
No Aid for Crew
Nor can crewmen claim any of
the standard athletic aid granted
to many college athletes. Stan
ford crew members usually pay
their own traveling expenses and
drive their own cars to away
races. The BAC contributes some
money to the crew association's

funds, but not nearly enough to
cover equipment costs, upkeep,
meet expenses or athletic aid.
After two and a half quarters
of practice the final varsity line
up has begun to take shape. Sen
iors Chuck Brothers, Dick Diae
ger and Rolf Peterson along with
sophomores Gary Reid, Dick
Lyon, Ted I-lulbert, Jon Loreen
and Dennis Keith are the current
selections for the varsity boat.
But any of thorn could be dis
placed by someone lower on the
list.

Harbach, Huskies, Cal
Now the Stanford crew is fac
ing its three big ones: the Mar
bach Cup Saturday in Los Ange
les against UCLA and Southern
California; Washington, .next
week here, and Cal in two weeks
at the Oakland Estuary. Good
performances in these races may
mean a shot al Ihe IHi regatta at
Syracuse in June.
An oarsman who gives up val
liable study time to practice for
a season that totals little over
half an hour of racing must have
some definite answers to the
question of the casual observer:
why make the effort?
The answer c or t a in I y isn't
glamour. Clamour is usually left
to the football stars, basketball,
baseball and other major sport
participants. Crew, based al Red
wood City Yacht Harbor, remains
remarkably well hidden from the
public eye.
No Aid for Crew
Nor can crewmen claim any of
the standard athletic aid granted
to many college athletes. Stan
ford crew members usually pay
their own traveling expenses and
drive their own cars to away
races. The BAC contributes some
money to the crew association's

funds, but not nearly enough to
cover equipment costs, upkeep,
meet expenses or athletic aid.
After two and a half quarters
of practice the final varsity line
up has begun to take shape. Sen
iors Chuck Brothers, Dick Diae
ger and Rolf Peterson along with
sophomores Gary Reid, Dick
Lyon, Ted I-lulbert, Jon Loreen
and Dennis Keith are the current
selections for the varsity boat.
But any of thorn could be dis
placed by someone lower on the
list.
"We get up at five every morn

are on the water. The crews row
as hard as they can until seven,
then we go back for classes" so
said Kent Mitchell, one of iho cox
swains on (he Stanford varsity
crew, describing a daily morning
practice.
