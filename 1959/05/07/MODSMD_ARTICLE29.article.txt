# Card-SC Duel Expected
## 
### 
Southern California and Stan
ford are expected to set the pace
in a two-mile relay Saturday at
Fresno which could see both
teams within a few seconds of the
world's record.
Cal set the present standard of
7:20.9 in last year's Coliseum
Relays. Both the Indians and Tro
jans look capable of finishing
well below 7:30, but Cal should
n't he close to the mark this year
since half their team graduated.
USC can field a team of Bob

| Shankland, Tom Anderson, Tod
Smith and Wayne Lemons. The
i Indians will #o with Dick Lassen,
Don Chesarok, Bertil Lundh and
Ernie Cunliffe.
The Trojan runners are all
pretty equal in ability, while
Stanford has a wider spread from
Cunliffe to Chesarok. The race
would thus appear to he one
where the Cards would trail early
in the going, pick up as the race
progressed, and leave it up to
Cunliffe to close the gap.
