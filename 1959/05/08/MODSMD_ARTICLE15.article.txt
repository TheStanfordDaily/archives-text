# Legislature Backs IFC Rush Plan
## Defeats Pre-Soph Pledge Activities 
### Barbara Hicks Associate Editor 
After' nearly two hours of dis
cussion Legislature last night en
dorsed the recommendation of
Inter-fraternity Council to hold
rushing the first eight days of
spring quarter, with five days of
open houses during winter quar
ter'.
The win I or - quartc r open
houses are in addition to the pres
ent rushing procedure in spring
quarter.
Also included in the motion,
which was made by Dick Clot fil
ter, Men's Row representative,
as a provision for limited contact
fall and winter - quarter, except
during open houses. "Limited
contact," as defined by tho Legis
lature subcommittee investigat
ing rushing procedure, permits
"normal campus-wide social and
scholastic communications . . . be
tween fraternity personnel and
freshmen," in essence the present
arrangement.
Undue Strain
In discussing the pre-sopho
more rush proposal, opponents
argued that it would place undue
strain upon all concerned because
of the mechanical problems, i.e.,
freshmen would have to decide
in the spring whether to rush and
the University would have to
work out some way of housing
those who didn't pledge.
Tied in closely with the pre
sophomore rush was the elimina
tion of the no-contact rule. Fra
ternity representatives fear e d
that this would play havoc with
the freshman living and destroy
the sense of cohesion which the
freshman program attempts to
create.
There was general agreement
that the program as it was con
ducted this year was unsatisfac
tory, and fraternity members
claimed this was because rush
as too short, and did not. allow
enough time for the frosh to be
come acquainted with the houses.
Bublie Meetings Adequate
Legislature backed the propos
al by a 13-2 vote after- unanimous
ly opposing pre-sophomore rush
ing and voting 13-2 against spring
vacation rushing.
The Legislature also supported
the present system for holding
public meetings as adequate. The
Academic Affairs Committee of
fered an alternative proposal
which would make it possible for
students to hold a public meeting
after getting the signatures of 1
"interested" students and check
ing with the ASSU vice-president;
and the Public Exercises Com
mittee. Legislature members felt
this involved more red tape than
at present and was unnecessary.
Sent to By-laws Committee was
a change.to elect all the Legisla
ture representatives except grad
uate students and freshmen in
the spring, and referred to sub
committee was a suggestion to
eliminate Drives Commission and
place its activities under the ju
risdiction of lIR, YWCA, A Phi O
and Cardinals.
