### 
Tin RKPI.Y of Messrs Freeman ami (iuy to Tuesday's editorial
concerning the Stanford I .eft irnlieut.es that the group is now on
the road toward .serious work, both from the standpoint of pre
senting a forum of leftist thought and in everting its rightful
pressure to work for change in what it regards as "trivia!" ASSU
rules.
This work is encouraging, and we hope the Left will eonlinue
il in a serious and positive vein.
Hut the statement ilml "(fV cannot avoid suspecting
thai if jre had not chosen lo debate "Resolved: Ilial the
institution of private property is immoralhat rather
"Resolved: that Racon is Shakespeare,"' ice would not
have had the book thrown at its,'' serves quite well to
substantiale a suspicion lo which ice id hub <1 on Tuesday.
Namely: that members of the l.efl have heen convinced from
the beginning that they would be discriminated against, and that
they have, perhaps uneonseiously, sought to create this discrimi
nation in order that they might charge Stanford students as a
whole with being opposed to expression of ideas wilh which they
do not agree.
Again, however, it is encouraging to see some serious and posi
tive action being taken by the Left.
