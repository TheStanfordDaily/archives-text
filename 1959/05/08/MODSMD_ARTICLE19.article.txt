## Success and Failure 
### 
In commenting on the approach
es to Geneva and to the summit
there is a temptation to which all
of us are subject. It is to apply
too soon and too often the test of
success or failure. The negotia
tions which have now begun will
last for a long time. They could
last for a generation. In the course
of that long time there will be
many changes which cannot now
be foreseen clearly. For what is
being begun now by the states
men of the older generation will
probably not be concluded until
there is a new generation.
There is no present prospect
that the negotiations will "suc
ceed," if by that is meant that
they will produce a final settle
ment of the German problem.
On the other hand, there is 110
prospect, it seems to me, that
they will "fail," if by that is
meant that there will be no
more negotiations and that this
wiil be followed by some sort of
mobilization for war.
We must rid ourselves of the
rubber stamp notions of success
and failure. The German problem
is at present insoluble. No theo
retical solution of it would be
worth a great war to either side,
and both sides know that t'he ques
tion could not be settled by a war.
The world has to live with the
German question, producing as
best it can and from time to time
a modus vivendi without any seri
ous expectation of a settlement.
The German question lies in the
fact that the German Reich, as
founded by Bismark in 1871. has
been partitioned as a result of the
defeat of Hitler. Berlin, which was
the capital of the old G e r rn a n
Reich, has itself been partitioned.
The partition of Germany is the
consequence of the second World
War, and it could become the
cause of the third World War.
We ask ourselves, could the
partition of Germany have been
avoided? No one knows the an
swer. For this is just about the
iffiest question in world affairs.
What we can say is that the par
tition of Germany arises from
the fact that the Red Army com
ing from the East, the Allied
army coming from the West,
met in the middle of Germany.
They would not have met if Hit
ler had not attacked Russia and
brought her into the war. They
would not have met if the Allies,

including the United States, had
been strong enough to occupy the
whole of Germany before the Rus
sians got there. The fact is, how
ever, that they did get. there and
that the West got there and that
that was how Hitler's Reich was
conquered.
Was partition the necessary and
the inevitable result? Mere again
all is iffiness. Was it from the be
ginning the Soviet intention to dis
member Germany? Or would the
Soviet Union once upon a time
have settled for a neutralized and
lightly armed united Germany,
hoping, of course, that the Ger
man Communists would infiltrate
the German socialists, and eventu
ally rule the whole of Germany?
On the other hand, were the
Western Allies wise in thinking
I hat this risk was so great that,
instead of working for an evac
uation by the Ited Army, they
insisted upon the rearmament
of West Germany in alliance
with their own forces?
Questions such as these are no
longer real questions. Europe has
outlived them and what we are
now facing is the historic fact that
there are two Germanys and two
Berlins. The German crisis of
today is the crisis of the adjust
ment of the great powers to the
partition of Germany.
The adjustment will be a very
complicated experience. For the
partition of Germany is as great
an historic event as was the uni
fication of Germany under Bis
mark. The adjustment to this his
toric fact involves on both sides
of the Iron Curtain some kind of
recognition of most unpalatable
facts.
On the Western side it in
volves a recognition that there
are two German states. On the
Russian side it involves a recog
nition that there are two Ber
lins, and that West Berlin must
remain a part of the Western
community.
The acceptance of these unpal
'itable facts, and their recognition
in legal instruments which are
enforceable, will be the core of
he coming negotiations. The ob
ject of the negotiations will be a
modus vivendi which, while it rec
ognizes that there is in fact a par
tition of Germany, keeps alive the
light and the hope of an eventual
reunion.

there is a temptation to which all
of us are subject. It is to apply
too soon and too often the test of
success or failure. The negotia
tions which have now begun will
last for a long time. They could
last for a generation. In the course
of that long time there will be
many changes which cannot now
be foreseen clearly. For what is
being begun now by the states
men of the older generation will
probably not be concluded until
there is a new generation.
There is no present prospect
that the negotiations will "suc
ceed," if by that is meant that
they will produce a final settle
ment of the German problem.
On the other hand, there is 110
prospect, it seems to me, that
they will "fail," if by that is
meant that there will be no
more negotiations and that this
wiil be followed by some sort of
mobilization for war.
We must rid ourselves of the
rubber stamp notions of success
and failure. The German problem
is at present insoluble. No theo
retical solution of it would be
worth a great war to either side,
and both sides know that t'he ques
tion could not be settled by a war.
The world has to live with the
German question, producing as
best it can and from time to time
a modus vivendi without any seri
ous expectation of a settlement.
The German question lies in the
fact that the German Reich, as
founded by Bismark in 1871. has
been partitioned as a result of the
defeat of Hitler. Berlin, which was
the capital of the old G e r rn a n
Reich, has itself been partitioned.
The partition of Germany is the
consequence of the second World
War, and it could become the
cause of the third World War.
We ask ourselves, could the
partition of Germany have been
avoided? No one knows the an
swer. For this is just about the
iffiest question in world affairs.
What we can say is that the par
tition of Germany arises from
the fact that the Red Army com
ing from the East, the Allied
army coming from the West,
met in the middle of Germany.
They would not have met if Hit
ler had not attacked Russia and
brought her into the war. They
would not have met if the Allies,

including the United States, had
been strong enough to occupy the
whole of Germany before the Rus
sians got there. The fact is, how
ever, that they did get. there and
that the West got there and that
that was how Hitler's Reich was
conquered.
Was partition the necessary and
the inevitable result? Mere again
all is iffiness. Was it from the be
ginning the Soviet intention to dis
member Germany? Or would the
Soviet Union once upon a time
have settled for a neutralized and
lightly armed united Germany,
hoping, of course, that the Ger
man Communists would infiltrate
the German socialists, and eventu
ally rule the whole of Germany?
On the other hand, were the
Western Allies wise in thinking
I hat this risk was so great that,
instead of working for an evac
uation by the Ited Army, they
insisted upon the rearmament
of West Germany in alliance
with their own forces?
Questions such as these are no
longer real questions. Europe has
outlived them and what we are
now facing is the historic fact that
there are two Germanys and two
Berlins. The German crisis of
today is the crisis of the adjust
ment of the great powers to the
partition of Germany.
The adjustment will be a very
complicated experience. For the
partition of Germany is as great
an historic event as was the uni
fication of Germany under Bis
mark. The adjustment to this his
toric fact involves on both sides
of the Iron Curtain some kind of
recognition of most unpalatable
facts.
On the Western side it in
volves a recognition that there
are two German states. On the
Russian side it involves a recog
nition that there are two Ber
lins, and that West Berlin must
remain a part of the Western
community.
The acceptance of these unpal
'itable facts, and their recognition
in legal instruments which are
enforceable, will be the core of
he coming negotiations. The ob
ject of the negotiations will be a
modus vivendi which, while it rec
ognizes that there is in fact a par
tition of Germany, keeps alive the
light and the hope of an eventual
reunion.

of us are subject. It is to apply
too soon and too often the test of
success or failure. The negotia
tions which have now begun will
last for a long time. They could
last for a generation. In the course
of that long time there will be
many changes which cannot now
be foreseen clearly. For what is
being begun now by the states
men of the older generation will
probably not be concluded until
there is a new generation.
There is no present prospect
that the negotiations will "suc
ceed," if by that is meant that
they will produce a final settle
ment of the German problem.
On the other hand, there is 110
prospect, it seems to me, that
they will "fail," if by that is
meant that there will be no
more negotiations and that this
wiil be followed by some sort of
mobilization for war.
We must rid ourselves of the
rubber stamp notions of success
and failure. The German problem
is at present insoluble. No theo
retical solution of it would be
worth a great war to either side,
and both sides know that t'he ques
tion could not be settled by a war.
The world has to live with the
German question, producing as
best it can and from time to time
a modus vivendi without any seri
ous expectation of a settlement.
The German question lies in the
fact that the German Reich, as
founded by Bismark in 1871. has
been partitioned as a result of the
defeat of Hitler. Berlin, which was
the capital of the old G e r rn a n
Reich, has itself been partitioned.
The partition of Germany is the
consequence of the second World
War, and it could become the
cause of the third World War.
We ask ourselves, could the
partition of Germany have been
avoided? No one knows the an
swer. For this is just about the
iffiest question in world affairs.
What we can say is that the par
tition of Germany arises from
the fact that the Red Army com
ing from the East, the Allied
army coming from the West,
met in the middle of Germany.
They would not have met if Hit
ler had not attacked Russia and
brought her into the war. They
would not have met if the Allies,

including the United States, had
been strong enough to occupy the
whole of Germany before the Rus
sians got there. The fact is, how
ever, that they did get. there and
that the West got there and that
that was how Hitler's Reich was
conquered.
Was partition the necessary and
the inevitable result? Mere again
all is iffiness. Was it from the be
ginning the Soviet intention to dis
member Germany? Or would the
Soviet Union once upon a time
have settled for a neutralized and
lightly armed united Germany,
hoping, of course, that the Ger
man Communists would infiltrate
the German socialists, and eventu
ally rule the whole of Germany?
On the other hand, were the
Western Allies wise in thinking
I hat this risk was so great that,
instead of working for an evac
uation by the Ited Army, they
insisted upon the rearmament
of West Germany in alliance
with their own forces?
Questions such as these are no
longer real questions. Europe has
outlived them and what we are
now facing is the historic fact that
there are two Germanys and two
Berlins. The German crisis of
today is the crisis of the adjust
ment of the great powers to the
partition of Germany.
The adjustment will be a very
complicated experience. For the
partition of Germany is as great
an historic event as was the uni
fication of Germany under Bis
mark. The adjustment to this his
toric fact involves on both sides
of the Iron Curtain some kind of
recognition of most unpalatable
facts.
On the Western side it in
volves a recognition that there
are two German states. On the
Russian side it involves a recog
nition that there are two Ber
lins, and that West Berlin must
remain a part of the Western
community.
The acceptance of these unpal
'itable facts, and their recognition
in legal instruments which are
enforceable, will be the core of
he coming negotiations. The ob
ject of the negotiations will be a
modus vivendi which, while it rec
ognizes that there is in fact a par
tition of Germany, keeps alive the
light and the hope of an eventual
reunion.
