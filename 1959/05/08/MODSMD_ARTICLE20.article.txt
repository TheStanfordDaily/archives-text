Thank You
Editor, The Daily;
May I take this opportunity to
thank Stanford students for their
hospitality on the occasion of the
"Kendall-Sibley Debate"? I appre
ciate your kindness and encour
agement and only regret that a
very tight schedule did not permit
me to greet all the friends who

attended the "debate" and the re
ception.
1 hope that the large attend
ance reflects a general growth ol
political consciousness. Without
such a development, we can have
neither a free society nor a genu
inely peaceful world.
