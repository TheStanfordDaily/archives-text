# Problem: Student Interaction
## 
### 
In the recent National Confer
ence of Foreign Student Advisers,
Dr. Werner Warmbrunn reports,
"It came out clearly that the de
gree of interaction of American
and foreign students is a prob
lem all over the country and is
solved only partially."
Dr. Warmbrunn, who is adviser
to over 400 foreign students at
Stanford, attended the conference
in New York city April 2(i to 29,
and acted as chairman of the
panel on Foreign Student Atti
t tides and Characteristics. • The
general topic of the conference
was the role of the foreign stu
dent adviser in promoting inter
national understanding.
Graduates
The problems discussed at the
conference were mostly ones that
Dr. Warmbrunn has already come
up against at Stanford. For exam
pie, 70 per cent of the foreign stu
dents are doing graduate work,
and their average age is 2(i.
Their interests are often much
different from those of the under
graduates, and it is sometimes dif
ficult to arrange for "contact with
people of their own age. maturity
and academic achievement."
Know More
Another difficulty in relations
between foreign and U.S.-educat
ed s-tudents is that foreign stu
dents seem to know so much
more, especially in languages and
history, that feel in
ferior.
Dr. Warmbrunn remarked that
Americans also have much to of
fer; "in few other places in the
world do young people achieve
such social maturity and aware
ness of relationships as in thus
country."
Residence Programs
Students and University staff
members are working on ways to
increase foreign-American inter
action. "'One of the most effec
tive ways is through living ar
rangements and good residence
programs," Dr. Warmbrunn said.
"The key problem" is interest
ing American students in work
ing with foreign students. Inter
national centers, YMCA and YW

CA activities and groups such as
the IIH give American students a
chance to meet those from other
countries.
"There lias been a feeling at
recent conferences that there will
he more and more contact as more
and more ■students go abroad,"
Warmbrunn noted.
Specific plans for foreign-Amer
ican student activities for next
year include more informal meet

ings; "the more informal the situ
at ion in which they meet, the hel
ler the interaction," Dr. Warm
brunn said.
In the fall orientation program
for foreign students, a new at
tempt will be made to keep dis
cussions and lectures on a good
intellectual plane and to have
"first-rate" people to help foreign
students get the most from their
stay at Stanford.

Specific plans for foreign-Amer
ican student activities for next
year include more informal meet

ings; "the more informal the situ
at ion in which they meet, the hel
ler the interaction," Dr. Warm
brunn said.
In the fall orientation program
for foreign students, a new at
tempt will be made to keep dis
cussions and lectures on a good
intellectual plane and to have
"first-rate" people to help foreign
students get the most from their
stay at Stanford.
In the recent National Confer
ence of Foreign Student Advisers,
Dr. Werner Warmbrunn reports,
"It came out clearly that the de
gree of interaction of American
and foreign students is a prob
lem all over the country and is
solved only partially."
Dr. Warmbrunn, who is adviser
to over 400 foreign students at
Stanford, attended the conference
in New York city April 2(i to 29,
and acted as chairman of the
panel on Foreign Student Atti
t tides and Characteristics. • The
general topic of the conference
was the role of the foreign stu
dent adviser in promoting inter
national understanding.
Graduates
The problems discussed at the
conference were mostly ones that
Dr. Warmbrunn has already come
up against at Stanford. For exam
pie, 70 per cent of the foreign stu
dents are doing graduate work,
and their average age is 2(i.
Their interests are often much
different from those of the under
graduates, and it is sometimes dif
ficult to arrange for "contact with
people of their own age. maturity
and academic achievement."
Know More
Another difficulty in relations
between foreign and U.S.-educat
ed s-tudents is that foreign stu
dents seem to know so much
more, especially in languages and
history, that feel in
ferior.
Dr. Warmbrunn remarked that
Americans also have much to of
fer; "in few other places in the
world do young people achieve
such social maturity and aware
ness of relationships as in thus
country."
Residence Programs
Students and University staff
members are working on ways to
increase foreign-American inter
action. "'One of the most effec
tive ways is through living ar
rangements and good residence
programs," Dr. Warmbrunn said.
"The key problem" is interest
ing American students in work
ing with foreign students. Inter
national centers, YMCA and YW

CA activities and groups such as
the IIH give American students a
chance to meet those from other
countries.
"There lias been a feeling at
recent conferences that there will
he more and more contact as more
and more ■students go abroad,"
Warmbrunn noted.
