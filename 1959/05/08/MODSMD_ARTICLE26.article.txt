# CP's Golden Spike Missed Date
## 
### Doug Willis 
Today would have been the 90th
anniversary of Senator Stanford's
driving the gold spike that linked
the first transcontinental railroad
but the real anniversary won't
be until Sunday.
The original gold spike, now on
display in the Stanford Museum,
is inscribed, "The Central Pacific
Railroad. Ground broken January
S, 1863 Completed May 8,
But 90 years ago today was a
day of mishaps for the transcon
tinental railroads:
• The East Coast was waiting
for an announcement on the post
poned linkage ceremonies.
• In San Francisco, Sacramento
and other West Coast cities giant
celebrations were being held.
• Officials of the Central Pa
cific Railroad were waiting out a
rainstorm in Senator Stanford's
private car on a siding at Monu
ment Point, 32 miles from Pro
montory Point, Utah, when. 1 the
ceremonies were to be held.
• Officials of the Union Pacific
Railroad were being held as host
ages in Nebraska l>y Union Pacific
workmen who had been unpaid
since mid-January and were de
manding $80,000 in back wages be
fore the> would release the offi
cial car.
• Union Pacific workers were
still busy building a bridge at
Devil's Gate and repairing main
line track washed out by recent
rains.
3lay (Vivmoiiics
Finally, on May 10, Leland Stan
ford. president of the Central Pa
cific Railroad and eventual foun
der of Stanford University, pre
sided at ceremonies that connect
ed the transcontinental railroad.
He raised a hammer made of
silver from the Territory of Ari
zona, it has been reported, slipped
in the mud and missed the spike.
Vice-President C. P. Durant of the
Union Pacific completed driving
in the spike.
The site for driving the final
spike was a compromise point be
tween the two railroads. Promon
tory Point. 804 miles east of San
Francisco, was agreed upon after
a bitter race to lay mileage of
track. The Central Pacific laid
530 miles of track in the 293 days
before May 10.
Accounts tell that a general
storm throughout the Rockies had
caused washouts on the lines and
that Promontory Point was only
| a "little village drenched and for
lorn in a driving rain, its street
| an extensive mudhole."
It had been planned thai two
special trains would arrive at the

same moment, one from the east
and the other from the west, as
an impressive prelude to the join
ing ceremony. Instead battered
construction trains rolled in from
both directions, loaded with grad
ers, track-layers and teamsters, all
there to see the show.
It was late in the day before
the official car of the Union Pa
cific arrived.
When the event finally got un
der way ceremonial spikes, ties
and the final rail were brought
forth by a squad of Chinese work
men. Several spikes were pre
sented.
Many Metals
One was of Comestock silver;
another of an alloy of gold, iron
and silver, symbolic of Arizona
Territory's varied mineral re
sources; there were gold and sil
ver spikes from Idaho and Mon
tana; then two spikes of gold
from California. The ceremonies
lasted nearly an hour.
A telegraph wire was attached
to the silver hammer used by
Stanford and anolher was attach
ed to the spike. The arrangement
was intended to relay the record
of the blow instantly by direct
wires to Washington, New Or
leans, New York, Boston and San
Francisco.
When Stanford missed the spike
a telegraph operator simulated
the blow with his key.
Spike Withdrawn
After the celebration the final
golden spike was withdrawn and
presented to David Ilcwes. San
Francisco and Sacramento finan
cier who originated the idea, by
Senator Stanford. Hewes present
ed t he spike to the Stanford Mu
seum in 1592.
In 1927 the spike was trans
ferred to the Wells Fargo Bank
in San Francisco for safe keeping
and better public display. In 1954

the spike was returned to the
Stanford Museum, where it is now
on display in a room with the
"Governor Stanford," the first lo
comotive used in California.
Several replica spikes have been
made, but the one on display in
the Museum is the original spike

Today would have been the 90th
anniversary of Senator Stanford's
driving the gold spike that linked
the first transcontinental railroad
but the real anniversary won't
be until Sunday.
The original gold spike, now on
display in the Stanford Museum,
is inscribed, "The Central Pacific
Railroad. Ground broken January
S, 1863 Completed May 8,
But 90 years ago today was a
day of mishaps for the transcon
tinental railroads:
• The East Coast was waiting
for an announcement on the post
poned linkage ceremonies.
• In San Francisco, Sacramento
and other West Coast cities giant
celebrations were being held.
• Officials of the Central Pa

line track washed out by recent
rains.

Finally, on May 10, Leland Stan
ford. president of the Central Pa

He raised a hammer made of
silver from the Territory of Ari
zona, it has been reported, slipped
in the mud and missed the spike.
Vice-President C. P. Durant of the
Union Pacific completed driving
in the spike.
The site for driving the final
spike was a compromise point be

tory Point. 804 miles east of San
Francisco, was agreed upon after
a bitter race to lay mileage of
track. The Central Pacific laid
530 miles of track in the 293 days
before May 10.
Accounts tell that a general
storm throughout the Rockies had
caused washouts on the lines and
that Promontory Point was only

special trains would arrive at the

and the other from the west, as

Finally, on May 10, Leland Stan
ford. president of the Central Pa
cific Railroad and eventual foun
der of Stanford University, pre
sided at ceremonies that connect
ed the transcontinental railroad.
He raised a hammer made of
silver from the Territory of Ari
zona, it has been reported, slipped
in the mud and missed the spike.
Vice-President C. P. Durant of the
Union Pacific completed driving
in the spike.
The site for driving the final
spike was a compromise point be
tween the two railroads. Promon
tory Point. 804 miles east of San
Francisco, was agreed upon after
a bitter race to lay mileage of
track. The Central Pacific laid
530 miles of track in the 293 days
before May 10.
Accounts tell that a general
storm throughout the Rockies had
caused washouts on the lines and
that Promontory Point was only
| a "little village drenched and for
lorn in a driving rain, its street
| an extensive mudhole."
It had been planned thai two
special trains would arrive at the

same moment, one from the east
and the other from the west, as
an impressive prelude to the join
ing ceremony. Instead battered
construction trains rolled in from
both directions, loaded with grad
ers, track-layers and teamsters, all
there to see the show.
It was late in the day before
the official car of the Union Pa
cific arrived.
When the event finally got un
der way ceremonial spikes, ties
and the final rail were brought
forth by a squad of Chinese work
men. Several spikes were pre
sented.
Many Metals
One was of Comestock silver;
another of an alloy of gold, iron
and silver, symbolic of Arizona
Territory's varied mineral re
sources; there were gold and sil
ver spikes from Idaho and Mon
tana; then two spikes of gold
from California. The ceremonies
lasted nearly an hour.
A telegraph wire was attached
to the silver hammer used by
Stanford and anolher was attach
ed to the spike. The arrangement
was intended to relay the record
of the blow instantly by direct
wires to Washington, New Or
leans, New York, Boston and San
Francisco.
When Stanford missed the spike
a telegraph operator simulated
the blow with his key.
Spike Withdrawn
After the celebration the final
golden spike was withdrawn and
presented to David Ilcwes. San
Francisco and Sacramento finan
cier who originated the idea, by
Senator Stanford. Hewes present
ed t he spike to the Stanford Mu
seum in 1592.
In 1927 the spike was trans
ferred to the Wells Fargo Bank
in San Francisco for safe keeping
and better public display. In 1954

the spike was returned to the
Stanford Museum, where it is now
on display in a room with the
"Governor Stanford," the first lo
comotive used in California.
Several replica spikes have been
made, but the one on display in
the Museum is the original spike

I made from about .$lOO worth (»l

driving the gold spike that linked
the first transcontinental railroad
but the real anniversary won't
be until Sunday.
The original gold spike, now on
display in the Stanford Museum,
is inscribed, "The Central Pacific
Railroad. Ground broken January

But 90 years ago today was a
day of mishaps for the transcon
tinental railroads:
• The East Coast was waiting
for an announcement on the post
poned linkage ceremonies.
• In San Francisco, Sacramento
and other West Coast cities giant
celebrations were being held.
• Officials of the Central Pa

rainstorm in Senator Stanford's
private car on a siding at Monu
