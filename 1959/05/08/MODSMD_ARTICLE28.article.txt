## Gridders Ready Battle Plans for Alumni Game 
### 
Spring football's next-to-last
week will be wrapped up tomor
row with the second scrimmage
game of the season.
All efforts are being concen
trated on fielding a sharp, well
seasoned team for next Satur
day's first annual Alumni Game
against a team studded with
All - American and All - Coast
players.
The Indian gridders have been
working as five teams, with vet
eran Dick Norman, Rod Sears
and sophomore Jim Smith quar

terbacking the top three outfits.
Working with Norman and the
"Red" team in Wednesday's drills
was a backfield of Dick Bowers,
Mac Wylie and "new" fullback
Sid Garher. Sears directed John
Bessey, sophomore Hal Steuber
and veteran fullback Kick MeMil
len; Smith worked with sopho
more Stan Lindskog, Roger Crist
and John Bond.
Ends .Missing
Only at the ends, where two of
the top veterans injured All-
Coaster Chris Burford and base
ball player Ben Robinson are
not out for practice at the present
lime, is the team less than five
deep at every position.
Irv Nikolai, one of the Coast's
top pass receivers last year, and
converted center Rich Hearney
worked at the flanks with Nor
man's outfit Wednesday; Dale
Ostrander and Tom McDonald
were right behind them.
The tackle-to-tackle line, where
the Indians were supposed to lie
hurting this year, has been out
standing in spring drills. At
tackles, Cap Ingham and Dean
Hinshaw were with the "Reds"
on Wednesday, but are being
pressed hard by Phil Burkland,
Gary Pike and converted - end
Trev Grimm.
Guards Promising
Ron Kernandes and Larry La
cey, who closed last season in top
form, were the "Red" guards,
with Gary Leahy and Errol Scott,
two sophs who sat out last sea
son, and new sophomore Tom
Walsh very much in the battle.
Center looks especially strong
with "Sophomore of the Year"
Doug Pursell backed up by top
frosh lineman Chris Cottle, and
Stan Carmichael.
Plans are being completed for
the staging of next week's big
alumni clash. The game, set for
I p.m., will be open at no admis

working as five teams, with vet
eran Dick Norman, Rod Sears
and sophomore Jim Smith quar

terbacking the top three outfits.
Working with Norman and the
"Red" team in Wednesday's drills
was a backfield of Dick Bowers,
Mac Wylie and "new" fullback
Sid Garher. Sears directed John
Bessey, sophomore Hal Steuber
and veteran fullback Kick MeMil
len; Smith worked with sopho
more Stan Lindskog, Roger Crist
and John Bond.
Ends .Missing
Only at the ends, where two of
the top veterans injured All-
Coaster Chris Burford and base
ball player Ben Robinson are
not out for practice at the present
lime, is the team less than five
deep at every position.
Irv Nikolai, one of the Coast's
top pass receivers last year, and
converted center Rich Hearney
worked at the flanks with Nor
man's outfit Wednesday; Dale
Ostrander and Tom McDonald
were right behind them.
The tackle-to-tackle line, where
the Indians were supposed to lie
hurting this year, has been out
standing in spring drills. At
tackles, Cap Ingham and Dean
Hinshaw were with the "Reds"
on Wednesday, but are being
pressed hard by Phil Burkland,
Gary Pike and converted - end
Trev Grimm.
Guards Promising
Ron Kernandes and Larry La
cey, who closed last season in top
form, were the "Red" guards,
with Gary Leahy and Errol Scott,
two sophs who sat out last sea
son, and new sophomore Tom
Walsh very much in the battle.
Center looks especially strong
with "Sophomore of the Year"
