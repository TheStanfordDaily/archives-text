# Tribe Nine Hosts Visiting Pepperdine Team today
## 
### 
Sitting tight and hoping for a
couple of California losses this
weekend, the Stanford baseball
team takes on George Pepperdine
College in a pair of non-league
games at the Sunken Diamond--
3:15 p.m. today and 2:30 tomor
row.
Meanwhile, California hosts un
beaten Southern California today
and UCLA in a double-header to
morrow. Santa Clara, plays the
same foes, UCLA in a single to
day and SC in two tomorrow.
"Three" is the magic number
as far as Stanford is concerned.
Any Bear or Bronco losses this
weekend would just reduce the
number a little less as the Tribe
seeks to wrap up the Southern
Division playoff berth.
Considering that Santa Clara
must face SC twice this week,
Stanford could all but eliminate
the Broncs from any sort of con
dition next Tuesday, in a Sunken
Diamond clash.
Next weekend, the Cards face
SC in two Los Angeles games
and in two weeks close the regu
lar season by hosting California.

Pepperdine, usually one of Iho
Coast's leading independent pow
ers, has been having its troubles
this season.

Coach John Scolinos has seen
his Waves lose one after another
this year due to a porous defense.
Pepperdine has solid pitching and
good hilling hut the opposition
has been getting too many un
earned tallies.
Waves' Poor Defense
The Waves dropped 12 of their
first 15 games I his year, mainly
because of the poor defense and
occasional pitching lapses. Kxam
ples: In dropping an 8-3 decision
to Southern Cal, the Waves yield
ed seven unearned runs to the
heavy-hitting Trojans. And, three
Pepeprdine hurlers allowed seven
straighl walks after one man was
out in the ninth innging to open
the door for a <>.> defeat at the
hands of Sun Diego Stale.
Pacing the Wave attack is
catcher Clark (Bragan) Hex,
who is being boomed by South
landers as one of the top receiv
ers in eollegiale baseball. A ;> 10,
180-pound junior, Hex has picked
up 40 hits in 97 at bats for a .112
average, and has produced 10
doubles and 28 runs batted in.
In addition to his fine hitting,
Hex has thrown out l'J runners
attempting to steal.
Top 1 J ep pert line h u r 1 e r has
been sophomore left bander Hen
Burnell.
Starters I iieertuin
Stanford coach Dutch Fehring
is u n c e r 1 a i n on his pitching
choices for the weekend, although
unbeaten C1BA hurler Earl Hus
se|l may get one of the calls.
Lefties Terry Lindeman, Marv
Mecklenberg and John Gillis, and
right - bander Warren Nelson â€”
who gol two wins in relief
against Cal last week may get
the other call.
Fehring will be hoping lo see
some more lusty hitting from the
Indians, who boomed oui 28 hits
against ("al last week. Third
baseman Jim Burk and second
baseman J\1 i k e M a g e e each
banged out five hits in the Cal
series.
Veteran Burk, a steady .28G
hitter last year as a sophomore,
continued his great hitting Tues
day when he drove two triples
long off the left field bank
against San Diego Marines.
