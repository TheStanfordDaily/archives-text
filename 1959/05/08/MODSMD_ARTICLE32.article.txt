## 
### Dick Barnes 
Promise of the world's shot-put record and outstanding perform
ances in almost every other event will lure a capacity crowd to
Fresno's Ratcliffe Stadium for ilie West Coast Relays tomorrow
afternoon and evening.

Feature of the running event j.
Jy Norton rematch in the 100-
yard dash and the winner may
have to go 9.3 or even 0.2.
Stanford will send a 22 • man
team to the colorful meet, headed
by its two-mile relay quartet and
hop-step-jump artist John Kelly.
Dick Lassen, Don Chesarek,
.licitil Lundh and Frnie Cunliffe
will make up the two-mile team
th;u Coach Payton Jordan hopes
can heat USC and come within
several "seconds of the world rec
ord of 7:20.8.
Won Two Weeks Ago
This is the same Stanford team
that won the distance medley at
Drake Relays two weeks ago, up
set ling highly-touted units from
Oklahoma and Michigan State.
Kelly also was a winner at
Drake, shocking Houston's Jack
Smyth, who hadn't lost a relay
title in three years. Kelly's tough
est opposition this time will come
from no less than former world
record holder Adhemar DaSilva
of Brazil.
DaSilva, on an extended U.S.
tour, had trouble at the Mt. San
Antonio Relays two weeks ago,
and will be out to prove he hasn't
lost his touch. In that meet, the
asphalt runway fould him up so
much that he didn't even qualify
for the finals.
Meld Mark a( 54 4 ' ,
In his prime, DaSilva held the
world record at 1 -1 1 «. lie also
won Olympic titles in 1952 and
1956.
Kelly got his start in the hop
step jump at West Coast Relays
two years ago. As a freshman, he
took part in semi-official compe
tition after the broad jump, and
jumped an amazing IST the first
time he tried the event.
Since that lime, Kelly lias
ten in as many hop step - jump
compeliiions as possible, al
though their number is limited.
Last year in the National AAIJ
Meet, he placed fourth. This sea
son, in an attempt to develop out
standing entrants for the 1900
Olympics, the event will be held
at the NCAA championships.
Kelly will also go in the broad
.jump.
Long tlie Favorite
In the featured shol-pul. Dallas
Long is expected to be the man
of the hour but might have to
take a bad; seat to Hill Neider
or Parry O'Brien if O'Brien's
hand injury will let him compete.
In last year's principal Norton-
Morrow duels, the San Jose run
net won at Coliseum Relays and
Morrow won at National AAl'
and California Relays. Norton.

nogram will ho a Bobby Morrow
•ndowed with bla/.ing speed, has
had a tendency to blow the big
ones in previous years despite
tying the world standard of 9.3.
Figjit in !)..'! (iroup
Morrow has already beaten
Dave Sime this year and doesn't
ippear to be slowing down any.
The 1956 Olympic triple fold
medal winner is another of the
1.3 group, which gained its
.'ighth member when Abilene
Christian's Hill Woodhouse stop
ped the watches there earlier this
week.
All of the major California uni
versity and club track powers

a good collection of out-of-staters
among the more than 1600 en-
I (rants.
Four Stanford frosh will join
the 18-man varsity contingent.
! Dan Moore will go in the broad
, jump and new frosh record hold
er Don Bell will be in the discus.
Moore will be out to better the
frosh mark of 23-10 1 -.*, of which
he has been only 1 1 inches short.
Walling in High .lump
Marlin Walling, the epitome of
high jump inconsistency, will try
to uncork another of his 0-5 leaps,
provided lie can get by the open
i ing height of 6-0 .which he's had
t robule doing in several meets.
He'll be joined by the fast-improv
ing Rune Engebretson.
Attempting to recover from his
disappointing two-mile at Cal will
be Bob Mon/ingo. who'll po
Doug Martin in the 5000 meters.
Jerry Winters, second among
coast collegians though far be
i .hind the "big three," will be in
the shot-put. He'll attempt to hel

dians have entered discus throw
ers Armand DeWoese and Harlan
Dimmer, pole vaullers Mike Fran
