# LA 						Edges Giants
## 
### 
It was a case of not enough hits
yesterday as the Los Angeles
Dodgers nipped the Giants, 2-1, in
Seals Stadium. Fastballer Stan
Williams gained his first victory
over the Giants in his major
league career, with Jack San ford
getting the loss.
The Dodgers outhit the San
Francisco crew, 11-6.
In the seventh inning the Gi
ants had a rally going. With one
out, Felipe Alou smashed a
double to left center sending Jim
Davenport to third. Then the

Dodgers tried to put Willie Mays
on with an intentional pass. But
Mays had other ideas. With the
count three and none, Mays tried
to blast a pitch that Williams let
get a little too close, but the ball
was too high and Mays popped
up to the catcher. Then Willie
Kirkland grounded out to the
pitcher to end the inning, and the
Giants' hopes.
