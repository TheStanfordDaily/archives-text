## Police Chief Calls Arrests No New Policy 
### 
Detention of two Stanford
freshmen in Palo Alto City Jail
does not represent a "get-tough"
policy by Palo Alto police toward
| students, said Chief William A.
, Hydie yesterday.
The two Wilbur residents were
1 held Monday night, after being
| arrested on a charge of being in
toxicated in a public place. Palo
Alto police picked them up at
: 11:23 near Wellesley and Stan
| ford in College Terrace, where
| they were reportedly causing a
j disturbance.
Stanford officials had the two
i released on $23 bail each the fol
| lowing morning, but the pair
must appear May 11 in Palo Alto
j Mountain View Municipal Court
to answer the intoxication charge.
Hydie questioned the existence
j of any "policy" of turning over
student law violators to Stanford
j for disciplinary purposes. He said
I this has been done often in the
past, but that each case has been
i considered separately.
j Hydie noted that in this case, to
release the students would have
i made them immediately guilty of
again being intoxicated in a pub
| lie place.
"Cases which have been turned
over to Stanford have been han
dled satisfactorily in the past,"
; Hydie said, "so we have no reason
to change our general attitude."
Dean of Men William Craig,
somewhat concerned at the inci
| dent, noted, however, that the po
lice "still have the right to make
j the decision whether to turn vio
; lators over to the University or
i not."
