# Con Home Collections Break 41-year Record
## 
### 
Contributions for the Convalescent Home are still coming in, with $6500 thus fur collected fron
last week's Con Home Drive, according to Sallyanne Durr, publicity chairman.
More money was raised on campus than ever before in the 41-year history of the annual drive.
Over $1000 was raised in the penny-a-vote King and Queen Contest alone.
The royal couple was crowned last Friday at the Carnival. Dr. J. E. Wallace Sterling's pet pure

bred golden Labrador retriever,
Heidi, was crowned queen of
Con Home Week at Mama's by
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler.
Heidi's registered name is Hei
di of Hoover House. Permission
for the naming was obtained
from former President Herbert
Hoover.
Sam, the custodian of Stern
Hall, was coronated king. Over
30,000 pennies were cast for his
highness.
Also at the Carnival was a
19."31 Nash, donated to the Drive
by Allinger Motors, which was
auctioned. A bid of $63 took the
car.
Magician Dick Zimmerman, a
senior in Los Arcos eating club,
revealed the headline prediction
for Friday's Chronicle. Zimmer
man's prediction was one word
short of being exact.
The faculty took top honors at
yesterday's Hydrofollies on Lake
Lag by beating students in the
inner-tube relay race.
It was estimated that over 250
spectators lined the banks and
boat house to watch the water
carnival. An additional, though
unexpected, feature of the after
noon was the appearance, and
sinking, of Aquawazoo 11, a Phi
Sigma Kappa water vehicle.
Mim Wallace, co-chairman of
the Drive, said of the week's ac
tivities, "We'd like to thank each
person who aided this Con Home
Committee in making the annual
Drive for the Home a. success.
Each person who participated,
either by serving on a committee
or by at lending events, helped to
make it successful."
