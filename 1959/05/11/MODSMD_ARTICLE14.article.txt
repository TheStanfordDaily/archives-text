# Rushing Changes Won't Solve All
## 
### 
1 ,FCISt.ATL RF. last Thursday passed recommendations to improve
Stanford's rushing system. These changes essentially winter quar
ter open houses and a new definition of "limited contact will
probably help some hut still fall far short ol solving the total
problem that is created by the conflict between rushing and Stan
ford "s freshmen program.
These. proposals still leave freshmen isolateil by re
stricting contact ami the open houses still tvon't pioeide
adequate information to th e fr* 'shrnen about tln u future
living possibilities, i
\\ 11ile this limited action by Legislature is disappointing there
are several things here that are encouraging:
112 irst, it is good to see Legislature concerned ahonl as impor
tant a problem as this is, and while their action wasn t startling,
we hope a precedent has been established and that future Legis
latures will tackle this problem again and problems like il.
Second, tin* cooperation of lnterfraleriiily Council with Legis
lature in this matter is certainly to he applauded. The solutions
recommended were arrived at by joint discussion and such co
operation between these two organizations can only work for the
betterment of both.
I liirtL ami probably most important, the sincere con
cern e\ pressed by Jn terfratern il y C.ouncil both to tin• In
vestigating (.ommittee and to Legislature last Thursday
about the weaknesses of their rushing program is a very
In'althy sign. It is this hind of honest introspect ion that
will maie for a stronger, finer fraternity system at Stan
ford.
( hie thing disturbs us, however. Twice during the debate before
Legislature this comment was made by Dixon Arnett and I'ete
lledegard of IFC, and the quote is accurate: "Fraternities aren't
mature or responsible enough to live under art open system."
