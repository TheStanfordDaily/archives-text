1 ibetan Brigade
Editor, The Daily:
There has been some publicity
and more than a little discussion
on the Tibetan Brigade, a group
being formed to help fight Chi
nese Communists in Tibet.
Militarily, no one can deny the
ridiculousness of such a venture
and there is little doubt that the
Chinese could readily crush Tibet
in a single campaign; yet at the
same time T feel that to snicker
at so bold an undertaking is out
ut order.
The hope of these potential
freedom fighters is that by their
initial efforts they will promote
a snowballing of volunteers and
that these volunteers, well
trained in mountaineering, sabo
tage and harassment, will at
least prolong Communist victory.
Further, they believe that such
a venture will give testimony to
the world that freedom loving
peoples are sympathetic enough
to fight willingly for a just
cause. Needless to say, this would
enhance the prestige of the world
democracies.
My only concern is whether
the Tibetan Brigade is comprised
of irresponsible adventurers and
shiftless soldiers of fortune or
whether these men are dedicated
idealists with democratic prin
ciples.
Only as dedicated idealists can
they hope to achieve anything
really concrete. However, if this
be the case and they are still will
ing to aid depraved Tibet, all the
more power to them.

Editor, The Daily:
To be is to be the value of a
variable.
Whatever can have tempted us
to talk of Stanford Left? Cer
tainly, Student President Bohn
has been shocked by the insensi
tivity of certain parties to the
proper use of our Farm lan
guage. The mistake was to have
used tlie word STANFORD to
gether with the word LEFT.
Mr. Bohn, sensing that this
projected usage must involve cer
tain metaphysical difficulties, ap
pears to have consulted the AS
SIJ lexicon and finding no pre
vious examples of such usage as
STANFORD LEFT, tÂ» have
thrown out this misnomer.

Though Wittgenstein (basic
reading for ASSIJ presidents) ap
pears to have moved away from
the position in the Tract at us Lo
gico-Philosophicus that language
provides a basic clue to ontology
still we might keep this in mind
even when following his advice
to consult lhe variety of uses
which a word has in order to dis
cover its meaning.
Those who will consult the
telephone directory (respectable
philosophic empiricism) will be
embarrassed lo find anything
like a real definition of Stanford
- that it is really a university.
Consider the following:
Stanford Glass Blowing Co.
Stanford Paint and Body Shop
Stanford Sitter Service Agency
Stanford Union Oil Service
St an foi d Fish Co.
Stanford Drug ('o.
Stanford Really
Stanford View Barbeque Pit
it would be difficult to discov
er- among these a single meaning
of the Stanford sign. But certain
ly there does seem to be some
thing like a family resemblance
among them -something like an
ontologicaJ basis in the maximi
/ation of profit.
Now, clearly, there seems to be
no usage for ihe sign STAN
FORD LEFT no family resem
blance wiili previous respectable
usage. President Bohn must be
congratulated upon his therapeu
tic linguistic abortion performed
in a secluded corner of The Daily
for Monday, April 27, 1959.

No ]ustificai ion
I'.riitor, The Daily:
One may be, in a spirit of gen
erosity, inclined to give Ihe bene
fit of Ihe doubt lo an organiza
tion whose actions, at first
glance, make its worth dubious;
but, as more and more specimens
of semi-incoherent ranting, prod
ucts of the "Stanford Left," pie
sent themselves to view, the con
clusion is inevitable that this
this group has nothing of value
lo offer Stanford and no justifi
cation for existence as a campus
organization.
Stanford and The Daily have
bent over backward to avoid giv
ing these people Ie g i Ii m a I e
grounds for complaint; there is
no longer any point to taking
them seriously or wasting lime
or newsprint on I hem.
