# This Point of View
## U.S.—Middle East Principles 
### Abbas Alnasrawi 
No one can ol' ionise deny lhal
' I lie re are some basic principles by
which ihe Stale Department plan
; ners are guided in I heir formula
lion ol this Nation's foreign policy
I despite these planners' partisan
j loyalty .
In this note I am going to dis
: cuss two ol these principles in
their relevance to the Middle Kast.
< ontaiuiiient
The first ol these principles is
what is known to he the contain
infill ol communism. Hy that is
meant to keep the communist
countries out of these parts of the
world where they did not have
relations with alter the last war
and rolling back their power in
Kurope and the Far Kast.
Regional military groupings as
well as bilateral military arrange
ments were considered as the
most effective means to achieve
this end. NATO, SKATO and the
Baghdad Pact are examples.
Opportunity
This is, however, not Hie case
with the newly independent na
tions in Asia and Africa which
just liberated themselves lroin the
Western domination. Dealing with
a big power like the Soviet Union
is an opportunity rather than a
menace, hence they thought neu
trality would serve their own
best interests and would ease the
pressure of the cold war.
But neutrality means equal
treatment with both camps. This
treatment with Ihe Soviet Union
however will undermine the
American self pledged contain
ment principle. Consequently one
should not be surprised to read
that this or that country has been
lost to the West, once it decides
to be neutral. Iraq is a case in
point.
Moreover one should not fail to
note that the Asian and African
governments which decided to en
ter in these military arrangements
are only those reactionary govern
ments which their people are al
ways trying to overthrow. Once
this has been achieved, it is very
natural for the new regime to re
store the people's freedoms and
take the country out. of those mili
tary arrangements, this last, ac
tion is considered a victory to the
other camp. Iraq is again a case
in point.
The second element in the pic
ture is ttie oil interests of the
West, including U.S., in the Mid
dle East.
No one could exclude the im
portance of tin* astronomical

amount of profits derived from
lhat area in shaping the foreign
policy of Ihe nations concerned.
Consider tlial two thirds of the
world oil reserves are in Ihe Mid
dle has I and it lakes only one year
to pay off an oil investment in the
:>IK, while it takes !i. I years in Ili«-
U.S., and it costs only '/i eent to
find a barrel of oil iri the while
it cost $1.20 to find the same bar
rel in the U.S., ami it eosts ><-25
cents to produce a barrel of oil in
the MK while i< costs $1 lo pro
dure llie same barrel in the U.S.,
and if we consider that the net in
come of the U.S. oil industry from
the MK makes one half of this in
dustry's $1,229 millions net income
derived from operations outside
IJ.S. in 1957.
If we take all these facts in our
consideration, we have to believe
iri the sincerity of the editor of
the Wall Street Journal when he
said ori July lti, 1958 two days
after the Iraqi Revolution and one
flay after the American landing
in Lebanon—that "we are fight
ing for the oilfields in the Middle
East."

I despite these planners' partisan
j loyalty .
In this note I am going to dis
: cuss two ol these principles in
their relevance to the Middle Kast.
< ontaiuiiient
The first ol these principles is
what is known to he the contain
infill ol communism. Hy that is
meant to keep the communist
countries out of these parts of the
world where they did not have
relations with alter the last war
and rolling back their power in
Kurope and the Far Kast.
Regional military groupings as
well as bilateral military arrange
ments were considered as the
most effective means to achieve
this end. NATO, SKATO and the
Baghdad Pact are examples.
Opportunity
This is, however, not Hie case
with the newly independent na
tions in Asia and Africa which
just liberated themselves lroin the
Western domination. Dealing with
a big power like the Soviet Union
is an opportunity rather than a
menace, hence they thought neu
trality would serve their own
best interests and would ease the
pressure of the cold war.
But neutrality means equal
treatment with both camps. This
treatment with Ihe Soviet Union
however will undermine the
American self pledged contain
ment principle. Consequently one
should not be surprised to read
that this or that country has been
lost to the West, once it decides
to be neutral. Iraq is a case in
point.
Moreover one should not fail to
note that the Asian and African
governments which decided to en
ter in these military arrangements
are only those reactionary govern
ments which their people are al
ways trying to overthrow. Once
this has been achieved, it is very
natural for the new regime to re
store the people's freedoms and
take the country out. of those mili
tary arrangements, this last, ac
tion is considered a victory to the
other camp. Iraq is again a case
in point.
The second element in the pic
ture is ttie oil interests of the
West, including U.S., in the Mid
dle East.
No one could exclude the im
portance of tin* astronomical

amount of profits derived from
lhat area in shaping the foreign
policy of Ihe nations concerned.
Consider tlial two thirds of the
world oil reserves are in Ihe Mid
dle has I and it lakes only one year
to pay off an oil investment in the
:>IK, while it takes !i. I years in Ili«-

come of the U.S. oil industry from
the MK makes one half of this in
dustry's $1,229 millions net income
derived from operations outside
IJ.S. in 1957.
If we take all these facts in our
consideration, we have to believe
iri the sincerity of the editor of
the Wall Street Journal when he
said ori July lti, 1958 two days
