In reply to Mr. Turner's leller
of May ti, it is regretted that a
tight time schedule prevented
Mi. Tom Mboya from entertain
ing questions which would have
covered all of the topics, listed as
serious omissions: Ghana's de
mocracy, ritish plans for Nige
ria's independence and Mau Mau.
Mr. Mboya's intention was to
tell Americans that Africans are
distressed by European colonial
ism, by the treatment of Negroes
in the United Stales, and by the
failure of the United States t<>
support democratic principles in
stead of the colonialism of its al
lies.
Mr. Mboya is not Ghana's am
bassador and could not speak on
Ghana's democracy. But Mr. Tur
ner's insinuation that Ghana is
not democratic is unjustified.
Mr. Turner should be reminded
ol the recent undemocratic action
of the British government in
Hast Africa in suppressing the
protests of the native Africans to
the oppression of the majority
by Ihe white minority.
Independence for Nigeria does
not make up for French barbar
ism in Algeria, nor for the apart
heid in South Africa.
The Mau Mau was a regret
table means to end domination
by the white minority in Kenya.
I think that whenever an over
whelming majority is subjected
to inhumanities, it is frivolous
on its part to be scrupulous of
the propriety of the means it
uses to secure freedom.
Repression will hardly pay; its
result can never be white domi
nation in Africa. Give independ
ence to the African colonies and
let the white settlers live in co
operation and partnership wilh
the Africans.
