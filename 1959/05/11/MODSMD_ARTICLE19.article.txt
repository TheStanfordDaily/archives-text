# Military Force: Can be Made Means for Attaining Peace

Military force can be made a
legitimate means for attaining
peace, concluded I listory Profes
sor Otis Pease in answering Hit*
discussion question: "Can lasting
world peace and the containment
of the Communist I h rea t he
achieved by predominantly mili
tary power?"
"Whether we like it or not,"
said Pease, "our search for peace
must be carried on at the same
time we are playing an interna
tional chess game to prevent So
viet interference in the affairs <j|
independent nations."
Unrealistic
"The problem is lo properly ad
jtrst our use of force lo the peace
ful ends we seek," said Pease.
"This being the case, our present
commitment to all-out nuclear
war is unrealistic."
Pease believes thai a non-nu
clear, mobile military striking
power is the only legitimate use
of force in our foreign policy.
Once developed, such a military
force should be kept on United
States soil, but could be used
swiftly and intelligently at par
ticular focal points around the
world without resulting in an in

| iPiTiational holocaust through
miscalculat ion.
Disengagement
"Because force and destruction
arc not our ends, we must make
an all out attempt at disengage
ment on total nuclear strategy,
even to llie risk of imbalance on
total n u c Ie a r weapons," said
Pease.
Pease pointed out that only the
President has ihe power lo follow
1 a program of nuelear-disengage
j men!, for only he can balance llie
pel ly pressures of Ihe armed
| forces. Bui following such a pro
gram requires great political in
telligence and aggressiveness.
"Few times in ihe 20th Century
have we licen so deficient and
woefully unimaginative in presi
dential leadership which is neces
sary for this policy change,"
Pease emphasized.
Non-Nuclear Power
Pease thinks that reliance on
non-nuclear deterrent power will
facilitate the present tendency of
rivalry between the US and Rus
sia to shift into the world eco
nomic sphere. And it is in this
field where the US must make its
bid for peace.
"The results of the internation

al chess gamp depend upon who
t-an support the local national as
pirations of colonial peoples
aroimd the world," Pease said.
.Material Development
Although colonial peoples have
intellectual and spiritual aspira
lions, Pease believes their imme
diale desires are the material de
velopment of their own nations.
"Our economic system*is just as
capable of providing for the wants
of colonial people as the Russian
system. However, the ultimate su
periority of state controlled capi
talism over Communism is that it
can achieve more closely a class
less society, which is also very
important to colonial peoples,"
Pease concluded.
