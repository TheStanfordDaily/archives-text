# Two-Mile Relay Quartet Sensational at Fresno
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Four Stanford half-milers ran 19f>9's fastest two-mile relay in the
world Saturday at tho West Coast Relay's in Fresno a meet high
lighted by a 9.3 hundred-yard dash and a seven-foot high jump.
Dick Lassen, Don Chesarek, Bertil Lundh and Ernie Cunliffo
ground Southern California into the dust as they ran 7:25.4 4.6

seconds over California's world
record, but 45 seconds better
than Occidental's old meet mark.
Ohesarek was the surprise man
of Hie race, lie hadn't run an SNO
this year, but responded with a
brilliant 1:51.2 • second leg. Only
Cunliffe's anchor stint of 1:49.4
exceeded him.
Kurly Lead
Lassen, leading off with a
three-turn half-mile out of the
chute, led for nearly 800 yards.
Though USC's Wayne Lemons
passed him in the final stretch,
Lassen finished with a 1:52.3,
fastest race of the year for him.
Chesarek ran very close to
Ted Smith of the Trojans
through most of the second leg,
and went into the lead down the
final stretch.
Initial Speed
Lunrth started his half with a
53 second first quarter, lie slip
ped to a 5!).5 final 440, however,
finishing in 1:52.5 but only a
yard or so behind Tom Anderson
of the Trojans.
The Lundh - to • Cunliffe baton
pass was perfect, and Cunliffe
quickly splinted to a 20-yard lead
ovei Hob Shankland by the time
the pair had run 220 yards.
The Indian anchor-man ripped
his quarter in 52.5, completely
taking the starch out of Shank
land. Never pressed, Cunliffe
breezed home with his 1:49.4 and
7:25 I for I he quartet.
Rematch
The victory set up another ex
cellent race lor next Saturday at
the Los Angeles Coliseum Re
lays, Stanford and IJSC will
again match strides, this time
wilh I'enn Slate and 4:01 miler
lid Moran added to the field.
Itay Norton's breezing 9.3 cen
tury was the big talk of the
meet. Loafing through the final
15 yards of his heat obviously
eased up, Norton apparently

missed a tremendous opportunity
to become the first man to run a
legitimate 9.2.
USC's Charley Dumas cleared
seven feet for the first time since
the 195(5 Olympic Trials to pro
vide the field event sparkler.
Dallas Long shoved the shot 62-
sv'i5 v 'i on his final effort to nose out
Bill Neider by 2'- inches.
Bell's Surprise
Don Dell shocked virtually ev
eryone when he caught hold of a
162-4% discus effort, good for
second place behind only Rink
Babka.
John Kelly was in form in the
broad jump with a 24-7% second
place leap. Joel Wiley won at
25-4 '1-,
Kelly hop-step-jumped 48-2%.
This got him fourth place, more
than a foot and a half out of
third. In the shot-put. Jerry Win
ter's came through with a 55-3lL
effort on his final throw to gain
second in the collegiate division.
Jim Hackstrand ran into more
technical problems in the jave
lin as a marker- mix-up apparent
ly cost him a throw of 220 feet,
lie was credited with a best of
212.

sen, Cunliffe, Hob Hesse and Che
sarek grabbed off a fourth in
3:16.7.
