NCAA ]) I a y off s , and such,
which looked so much within
reach for Stanford's baseball
team last weekend now are be
ing made hard to get by the Pa
cific Coast Conference.
Friday, the PCC announced
that if Southern California wins
the Southern Division title, it
will be eligible to represent the
South in the final playoff against
the Northern champ despite the
fact that the Trojans are NCAA
ineligibles. I ISC lias cinched a
tie for the Southern Division
crown with a D-1 record. Stan
ford, in second, is 5-3.
The PCC's plan is fine, except:
if SC wins the Southern Division
and then the conference playoff,
who is the PCC's representative
to the NCAA?
