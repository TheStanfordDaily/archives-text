# Errors Help Out As Cards Win 2

### Dave Dow 
An unwarring bunch of In
dians jockeyed with an ever err
ing Peppeidine hall club for nine
innings of two weekend bull
games and finally walked in with
a pair of late-inning victor ies, 5-1
and !)-!S. Neither was a CI HA ball
game.
The Waves tilled Stanford's
Sunken Diamond Willi 12 errors
in the two games and literally
handed the Indians Saturday's
!)S triumph with eight infield
bobbles and seven unearned runs.
tCrrors Help
Stanford entered the ninth on
the short end of an S(» score. Hut
the Waves conveniently tossed in
three more errors to toss the win
in Stanford's direction.
Second baseman Mike Ma gee
walked. Wave shortstop Norm
(Jreenbaum gum mod up Art von
Wronski's double play ball, and
lien Robinson walked to load the
sacks. Mike Felice, batting for
winning pitcher Roy Lawson,
lapped to third, and third base
man Ray Wrenn threw wide to
the plate, his fourth error of the
game, to score Magce.
Five .Miseries
Then Wrenn made it an even
five by throwing Joel Newkirk's
slow roller far over first base
man Cliff Warren's outstretched
glove to score Harry Rodda, run
ning for von Wronski. and Robin
son with the winning run.
Pepperdine put themselves in
the ball game in the third inning
when Warren tagged starter
Warren Nelson for a 375 - foot
home run with bases loaded.
Warren's belt was the 51st home
run hit out of Sunken Diamond
in the park's 28-year history. The
Wave slugger added three more
hits during the afternoon.

The Waves milled two more ill
