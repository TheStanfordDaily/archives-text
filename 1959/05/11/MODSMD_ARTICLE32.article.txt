# Quack Law Insufficient
## 
### 
A revision of all laws relating
to the problem of quackery in
California is recommended in the
current issue of the Stanford
Law Review on the results of a
survey made by its editorial staff.
California's medical anti
quackery laws just don't do the
job, the survey found, because of
being too narrow, poorly drafted,
and often unenforced.
The Review, published by sec
ond- and third-year students,
made this disclosure after exten
sive interviews with administra
tive and judicial officers and ex
amination of the records of the
Assembly interim committee's
hearings in San Francisco and
Los Angeles.
Inapplicable
"With the possible exception of
the provisions prohibiting the
practice of medicine without a
license, existing law is largely
inapplicable or else unenforced
against the unlicensed," the lie
view said.
Testimony is difficult to ob
tain from the quack's patients,
the Review said, and existing
penalties don't deter the quack
sters who feel that the possibility
of a large profit is worth the
chance of conviction.
Of 59 convictions since 1948,
the survey found, 30 sentences
imposed a line of only $200 or
less.
Lack of Co-operation
Lack of co-operation among
various state law enforcement
agencies and lack of interest in
California arid to the inefficiency
of present state regulations, the
Review pointed out.
The Review suggested reme
dies which included a special en
forcement office established
within the State Attorney Gen
eral's office and a full-time ad
viser with authority to initiate
prosecution in any county in the
state.
