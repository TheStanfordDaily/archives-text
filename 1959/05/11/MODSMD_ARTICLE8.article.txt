# West Refuses Seat For East Germans
## Russ Thought To Acquiesce 
### 
GENEVA (/P) —The Big Four
foreign ministers' conference hit
a snag Sunday — before it even
got started- when the Soviet Un
ion demanded that Communist
East Germany be brought in as
a full participant.
The Western powers rejected
the demand.
The dispute created some un
certainty about the actual open
ing of the conference, set for 2:30
p.m. today. The issue will be ta
ken up again before the sched
uled first session.
Spokesmen said the Western
powers regarded the effort by
Moscow to put the East Germans
in the center of the conference
stage as a matter of substance
rather than a mere procedural
wrangle. They said it involved a
form of recognition of the Red
East German regime.
Although the Soviet move
brought a crisis atmosphere,
there was a growing expectation
in the Western camp that the So
viet side—in the final analysis—
would not push the seating argu
ment to a breaking point.
Behind the scenes moves were
under way Sunday night to settle
the dispute and informants said
the first session probably will be
convened as scheduled with the
four powers at the table. After
hearing a welcoming speech
from UN Secretary Geenral Dag
Hammarskjold, they said the
ministers can get down to debat
ing the Russian demand.
Sources close to the French
delegation said that if Soviet For
eign Minister Andrei A. Gromyk?>
insisted on seating the East Ger
mans at the conference table
with the name "German Demo-

The first dispute of the eon
ferenee arose when delegates
couldn't decide if a round or
square table should be used at
the meetings.
Herter, and presumably
Lloyd and Couve de Murville,
took the position that he did
not care about the shape of the
table as long as the Last Ger
mans were not at it as full par
ticipants.
At last report, the confer
ence will meet today at a round
table.

cratic Republic" placed with that
of the Big Four powers, it would
be a signal for the Western na

The French sources did not ex
plain how this might come about.
But apparently they meant that
the Western delegations would
maintain their refusal to accept
the Communist East Germans as
a full-fledged delegation even if
this meant breaking up the talks.
Assistant. Secretary of State
Andrew H. Berding told report
ers the Soviet government ear
lier had agreed in an exchange
of diplomatic notes to accept the
Western position that represen
tatives of Fast and West Ger
many should have only advisory
status at the conference.
Berding said the U.S. govern
metit would not want to see the
conference break up on a proce
dural matter but he added: "This
is more than a procedural mat
tor. It is a matter of consider
able substantive importance."

East Germany be brought in as
a full participant.
The Western powers rejected
the demand.
The dispute created some un
certainty about the actual open
ing of the conference, set for 2:30
p.m. today. The issue will be ta
ken up again before the sched

Spokesmen said the Western
powers regarded the effort by
Moscow to put the East Germans
in the center of the conference
stage as a matter of substance
rather than a mere procedural
wrangle. They said it involved a
form of recognition of the Red
East German regime.
Although the Soviet move
brought a crisis atmosphere,
there was a growing expectation
in the Western camp that the So
viet side—in the final analysis—
would not push the seating argu

Behind the scenes moves were
under way Sunday night to settle
the dispute and informants said
the first session probably will be
convened as scheduled with the
four powers at the table. After
hearing a welcoming speech
from UN Secretary Geenral Dag
Hammarskjold, they said the
ministers can get down to debat
