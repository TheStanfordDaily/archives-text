More than 50 fraternity officers and administration officials
turned out last Thursday evening to honor Interfraternity Auditor
Dean Turner who is retiring after 26 years of University service.
IFC President Kapp Ingham presented him with a barometer bear
ing the inscription: "In appreciation for 25 years of devoted service

to the fraternities of Stanford."
Turner graduated from Stan
ford in 1921 and started his job
as auditor in J933 which he has
held up to the present time.
Recalling the depression year

in which Turner was hired, Dean
of Men William Craig said, "The
fraternity system was having fi
nancial problems too, but evi
dently some of the house mana
gers weren't. Some of (hem were
buying new convertibles."
Craig continued that a group
of the fraternity business mana
gers hired him as an auditor, and
later the IFC voted to have an
auditor for the entire system and
appointed him to that position.
"He's been a tremendous help
â€”not only in knowing him per
sonally but in helping us over the
rough spots," Craig said.
Dean David Larimer,'who will
take over Turner's duties, praise
take over Turner's duties,
praised him for his "sincere con
fidence and belief in the Stanford
fraternity system.
