Most Stanford students will purchase
personal life insurance sometime in
the future. Many will apply for life
insurance as soon as they have their
first jobs. Some will apply when ihey
marry, have their first child, an in
crease in income and new responsi
bilities. Up to very recently the pur
chasers of personal life insurance
faced the possibility of being de
clined or forced to pay higher pay
ments for life insurance because of
changes of health and occupations.
There is now a new concept of life
insurance buying! Under New York
Life's G.1.0., once he qualifies, a
y*ung man's right to buy more in
surance later is guaranteed. Issued
from birth to age 37, this provision
can be included with most new poli
cies of $5,000 or more. This option
guarantees the right to buy another
policy at any or all of seven option
ages, beginning at 22 and every
three years thereafter to 40. These
additional policies will be issued at
regular rates and without physical
examination or evidence of insura
bility. Take this step to guarantee j
that you won't be uninsurable. Look
into it right now.
