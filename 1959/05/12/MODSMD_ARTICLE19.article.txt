# Grad Students Differ On Peace Proposals
## 
### Isabel Shaskan 
Immediate unilateral disarma
ment is called for, urges Phil
Temko. To Bill McCraw, the ini
tiation of such a program would
be a flagrant dismissal of reality.
In the opinion of George Zanino
vieh, what we do or do not do in
regards to armaments should be
predicated upon what Russia does.
These are the opinions of three
graduate students. Each one was
interviewed with respect to the
following question: Can lasting
world peace and the containment
of the Communist threat be
achieved by predominantly mili
tary power?
Military Aggression
Phil Temko, a graduate student
in Philosophy, formulated his re
ply on the assumption that the
word 'threat' refers to possible
military aggression by the Soviet
Union rather than to the Commu
nist and other revolutions that
are occurring in the world.
He questions the assumption
that the continued build up of
armaments is a solution to world
problems. Such a program, he
believes, must lead sooner or later
to an outbreak of war somewhere
in the world. "In an atmosphere
of military preparedness, interna
tional 'incidents' are too easy to
come by. One irresponsible per
son or group could trip the mech
anism."
'Probabilities'
Temko's position is grounded
upon his assessments of 'proba
bilities.' "In the event of unilat
eral disarmament there is only a
certain degree of probability that
the Soviet Union would make a
move against the United States.
"If the Soviets did actually
move in and seize control of the
country, there is only a certain
degree of probability that condi
tions would be intolerable—i.e.,
worse than mass death by nu
clear warfare.
Dangerous Amounts
"On the other hand, from the
latest reports it appears not mere
ly probable but an accomplished
fact that right now, everywhere,
strontium 90 in dangerous
amounts is entering the bones of
those most susceptible—namely,
children.
"I would gladly trade the cer
tainties of nuclear fallout," he
concludes, "for the uncertainties
of predicting what life would be
like in a world dominated by the
Russians, an outcome which is it
self uncertain."
'Containment'
Besides, he adds, "it is not in
conceivable that we might 'con

tain' the Soviet threat by remov
ing the very consider able and long
standing US military threat to the
Soviet Union."
Bill McCraw, a teaching assist
ant in Political Science, believes
that it is impossible to contain
the Communist threat without
military power, if "we do not wish
that threat to become a reality."
McCraw supports his position
with these arguments:
• We are committed to provid
ing the other free nations of the
world with military defenses.
Therefore, we cannot do anything
as rash as disarm.
• Second, "strategically, there
is no reason why we should be
bound by limitations I hat are not
binding on the other side." How
ever, he observed, there are moral
reasons.
Peace, Justice
What we know trorn history
and what we have observed of
Communism shows us that ihe
leaders of the Soviet Union will
not be influenced by moral per
suasions. "We must work for
peace," he concludes; "above that,
however, we must work tor .jus
tice."
George Zaninovich, also a teach
ing assistant in the Political Sci
ence department, rejects the pro
posal of passive resistance. Such
a program is impractical, he main
tains; the difficulties both in or
ganizing the movement and in ap
plying sanctions whi c h would
make people comply with its aims
are too great.
Waiting
"Waiting the situation out" is
how he capsulates his position.
"We should not be pressured by
the 'fear' in the immediate situa
tion into either unilateral disarm
ament or the initiation of a pre
ventative war." While we wait,
we must continually attempt to
negotiate.
We wait in the hope that the
dynamics of world politics will de
velop in such a way as to make
the situation conducive to the
achieving of satisfactory agree
ments. We wait with the hope
that the possibility of the "insti
tutionalizing of international con
flict" will materialize. Finally, we
wait with the hope that the na
tures of both the Russian and the
American people will change.
"In the meantime," he con
cludes, "we must keep pace with
the Russians in the armaments
race. The function of maintain
ing a moving equilibrium of ten
sions is to deter overt and imme
diate actions which may prove
disastrous to modern civilization."

wait with the hope that the na
tures of both the Russian and the
American people will change.
"In the meantime," he con
cludes, "we must keep pace with
the Russians in the armaments
race. The function of maintain
ing a moving equilibrium of ten
sions is to deter overt and imme
diate actions which may prove
disastrous to modern civilization."
Immediate unilateral disarma
ment is called for, urges Phil
Temko. To Bill McCraw, the ini
tiation of such a program would
be a flagrant dismissal of reality.
In the opinion of George Zanino
vieh, what we do or do not do in
regards to armaments should be
predicated upon what Russia does.
These are the opinions of three
graduate students. Each one was
interviewed with respect to the
following question: Can lasting
world peace and the containment
of the Communist threat be
achieved by predominantly mili
tary power?
Military Aggression
Phil Temko, a graduate student
in Philosophy, formulated his re
ply on the assumption that the
word 'threat' refers to possible
military aggression by the Soviet
Union rather than to the Commu
nist and other revolutions that
are occurring in the world.
He questions the assumption
that the continued build up of
armaments is a solution to world
problems. Such a program, he
believes, must lead sooner or later
to an outbreak of war somewhere
in the world. "In an atmosphere
of military preparedness, interna
tional 'incidents' are too easy to
come by. One irresponsible per
son or group could trip the mech
anism."
'Probabilities'
Temko's position is grounded
upon his assessments of 'proba
bilities.' "In the event of unilat
eral disarmament there is only a
certain degree of probability that
the Soviet Union would make a
move against the United States.
"If the Soviets did actually
move in and seize control of the
country, there is only a certain
degree of probability that condi
tions would be intolerable—i.e.,
worse than mass death by nu
clear warfare.
Dangerous Amounts
"On the other hand, from the
latest reports it appears not mere
ly probable but an accomplished
fact that right now, everywhere,
strontium 90 in dangerous
amounts is entering the bones of
those most susceptible—namely,
children.
"I would gladly trade the cer
tainties of nuclear fallout," he
concludes, "for the uncertainties
of predicting what life would be
like in a world dominated by the
Russians, an outcome which is it
self uncertain."
'Containment'
Besides, he adds, "it is not in
conceivable that we might 'con

tain' the Soviet threat by remov
ing the very consider able and long
standing US military threat to the
Soviet Union."
Bill McCraw, a teaching assist
ant in Political Science, believes
that it is impossible to contain
the Communist threat without
military power, if "we do not wish
that threat to become a reality."
McCraw supports his position
with these arguments:
• We are committed to provid
ing the other free nations of the
world with military defenses.
Therefore, we cannot do anything
as rash as disarm.
• Second, "strategically, there
is no reason why we should be
bound by limitations I hat are not
binding on the other side." How
ever, he observed, there are moral
reasons.
Peace, Justice
What we know trorn history
and what we have observed of
Communism shows us that ihe
leaders of the Soviet Union will
not be influenced by moral per
suasions. "We must work for
peace," he concludes; "above that,
however, we must work tor .jus
tice."
George Zaninovich, also a teach
ing assistant in the Political Sci
ence department, rejects the pro
posal of passive resistance. Such
a program is impractical, he main
tains; the difficulties both in or
ganizing the movement and in ap
plying sanctions whi c h would
make people comply with its aims
are too great.
Waiting
"Waiting the situation out" is
how he capsulates his position.
"We should not be pressured by
the 'fear' in the immediate situa
tion into either unilateral disarm
ament or the initiation of a pre
ventative war." While we wait,
we must continually attempt to
negotiate.
We wait in the hope that the
dynamics of world politics will de
velop in such a way as to make
the situation conducive to the
achieving of satisfactory agree
ments. We wait with the hope
that the possibility of the "insti
tutionalizing of international con
flict" will materialize. Finally, we
wait with the hope that the na
tures of both the Russian and the
American people will change.

ament or the initiation of a pre
ventative war." While we wait,
we must continually attempt to
negotiate.
We wait in the hope that the
dynamics of world politics will de
velop in such a way as to make
the situation conducive to the
achieving of satisfactory agree
ments. We wait with the hope
that the possibility of the "insti
tutionalizing of international con
flict" will materialize. Finally, we
wait with the hope that the na
tures of both the Russian and the
American people will change.
"In the meantime," he con
cludes, "we must keep pace with
the Russians in the armaments
race. The function of maintain
ing a moving equilibrium of ten
sions is to deter overt and imme
diate actions which may prove
disastrous to modern civilization."
Immediate unilateral disarma
ment is called for, urges Phil
Temko. To Bill McCraw, the ini
tiation of such a program would
be a flagrant dismissal of reality.
In the opinion of George Zanino
vieh, what we do or do not do in
regards to armaments should be
predicated upon what Russia does.
These are the opinions of three
graduate students. Each one was
interviewed with respect to the
following question: Can lasting
world peace and the containment
of the Communist threat be
achieved by predominantly mili
tary power?
Military Aggression
Phil Temko, a graduate student
in Philosophy, formulated his re
ply on the assumption that the
word 'threat' refers to possible
military aggression by the Soviet
Union rather than to the Commu
nist and other revolutions that
are occurring in the world.
He questions the assumption
that the continued build up of
armaments is a solution to world
problems. Such a program, he
believes, must lead sooner or later
to an outbreak of war somewhere
in the world. "In an atmosphere
of military preparedness, interna
tional 'incidents' are too easy to
come by. One irresponsible per
son or group could trip the mech
anism."
'Probabilities'
Temko's position is grounded
upon his assessments of 'proba
bilities.' "In the event of unilat
eral disarmament there is only a
certain degree of probability that
the Soviet Union would make a
move against the United States.
"If the Soviets did actually
move in and seize control of the
country, there is only a certain
degree of probability that condi
tions would be intolerable—i.e.,
worse than mass death by nu
clear warfare.
Dangerous Amounts
"On the other hand, from the
latest reports it appears not mere
ly probable but an accomplished
fact that right now, everywhere,
strontium 90 in dangerous
amounts is entering the bones of
those most susceptible—namely,
children.
"I would gladly trade the cer
tainties of nuclear fallout," he
concludes, "for the uncertainties
of predicting what life would be
like in a world dominated by the
Russians, an outcome which is it
self uncertain."
'Containment'
Besides, he adds, "it is not in
conceivable that we might 'con

tain' the Soviet threat by remov
ing the very consider able and long
standing US military threat to the
Soviet Union."
Bill McCraw, a teaching assist
ant in Political Science, believes
that it is impossible to contain
the Communist threat without
military power, if "we do not wish
that threat to become a reality."
McCraw supports his position
with these arguments:
• We are committed to provid
ing the other free nations of the
world with military defenses.
Therefore, we cannot do anything
as rash as disarm.
• Second, "strategically, there
is no reason why we should be
bound by limitations I hat are not
binding on the other side." How
ever, he observed, there are moral
reasons.
Peace, Justice
What we know trorn history
and what we have observed of
Communism shows us that ihe
leaders of the Soviet Union will
not be influenced by moral per
suasions. "We must work for
peace," he concludes; "above that,
however, we must work tor .jus
tice."
George Zaninovich, also a teach
ing assistant in the Political Sci
ence department, rejects the pro
posal of passive resistance. Such
a program is impractical, he main
tains; the difficulties both in or
ganizing the movement and in ap
plying sanctions whi c h would
make people comply with its aims
are too great.
Waiting
"Waiting the situation out" is
how he capsulates his position.
"We should not be pressured by
the 'fear' in the immediate situa
tion into either unilateral disarm
ament or the initiation of a pre
ventative war." While we wait,
we must continually attempt to
negotiate.
We wait in the hope that the
