Middle East Policy

Although there are many who
think so, it seems to me mislead
ing to suppose that the Russians
have staged the Berlin affair as
a distraction—in order to divert
attention from their ambitions in
Iraq and in the Middle East. The
•stakes in Germany are much big
ger for them and for us than in
Iraq.
In Germany the Soviet Union
and the Western alliance, each
armed with nuclear weapons,
confront one another directly.
Neither can or will surrender
its vital interests to the other,
and if they cannot find an hon
orable and acceptable modus vi
vendl, there may be no alterna
tive to a great war.
As compared with this, the cold
war about Iraq and Iran, though
important and dramatic, is never
theless secondary. The oil of Iraq
must find its market in the West.
The Soviet Union has no need of
it, in fact no use for it. The So
viet Union will, therefore, not go
to war to seize Iraq as it would
most probably go to war to hold
eastern Europe.
The West, for its pari, will
not go to war about Iraq be
cause, when the chips are down,
Iraq wit h its oil fields, like
Egypt with the Suez Canal,
must have a trading arrange
ment with the West.

The practical conclusion to be
drawn from this is that however
bad things may look in Baghdad,
the one thing above all that we
must not do is to write off Iraq,
and then treat it as a Communist
satellite in the same class with
North Korea and North Vietnam.
Even though the Iraqi Commu
nists may dominate the govern
ment, which they have not yet
done, we should not regard the
situation as final and irrepar able.
Egypt has taught us that as
between Arab nationalism and
Soviet Communism there is
much flirtation, there may even
be a heavy affair, but there has
not yet been any Indissoluble
marriage.
The main reason for this, so I
venture to think, is that there is
no common frontier between any
Arab state and the Soviet Union.
With the exception of Albania,
which is not much of an excep
tion, the genuine Soviet satellites
are all countries into which the
Red Army has marcher!, and could
march again.
For this reason, Iraq, which
does not touch the Soviet Union,
is not likely to become a satellite.
For the same reason, Iran, which
does have a comornn frontier with
the Soviet Union, is a great risk
if ever there is a break-up of the
Shah's regime.

not go to war about Iraq be
cause, when the chips are down,
Iraq wit h its oil fields, like
Egypt with the Suez Canal,
must have a trading arrange
ment with the West.

The practical conclusion to be
drawn from this is that however
bad things may look in Baghdad,
the one thing above all that we
must not do is to write off Iraq,
and then treat it as a Communist
satellite in the same class with
North Korea and North Vietnam.
Even though the Iraqi Commu
nists may dominate the govern
ment, which they have not yet
done, we should not regard the
situation as final and irrepar able.
Egypt has taught us that as
between Arab nationalism and
Soviet Communism there is
much flirtation, there may even
be a heavy affair, but there has
not yet been any Indissoluble
marriage.
The main reason for this, so I
venture to think, is that there is
no common frontier between any
Arab state and the Soviet Union.
With the exception of Albania,
which is not much of an excep
tion, the genuine Soviet satellites
are all countries into which the
Red Army has marcher!, and could
march again.
For this reason, Iraq, which
does not touch the Soviet Union,
is not likely to become a satellite.
For the same reason, Iran, which
does have a comornn frontier with
the Soviet Union, is a great risk
if ever there is a break-up of the
Shah's regime.

Middle East Policy

Although there are many who
think so, it seems to me mislead
ing to suppose that the Russians
have staged the Berlin affair as
a distraction—in order to divert
attention from their ambitions in
Iraq and in the Middle East. The
•stakes in Germany are much big
ger for them and for us than in
Iraq.
In Germany the Soviet Union
and the Western alliance, each
armed with nuclear weapons,
confront one another directly.
Neither can or will surrender
its vital interests to the other,
and if they cannot find an hon
orable and acceptable modus vi
vendl, there may be no alterna
tive to a great war.
As compared with this, the cold
war about Iraq and Iran, though
important and dramatic, is never
theless secondary. The oil of Iraq
must find its market in the West.
The Soviet Union has no need of
it, in fact no use for it. The So
viet Union will, therefore, not go
to war to seize Iraq as it would
most probably go to war to hold
eastern Europe.
The West, for its pari, will
not go to war about Iraq be
cause, when the chips are down,
