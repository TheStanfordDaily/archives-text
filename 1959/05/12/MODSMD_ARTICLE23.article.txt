# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Our of Context
Editor, The Daily:
In response to your editorial,
"Rushing Changes Won't Solve
All," in the May 11 Daily, I
should like to express apprecia
tion for your kind words about
IFC.
However, I would like to direct
yours and the interested public's
attention to a quote, used as the
finale to the editorial, which, I
feel, was taken slightly out of
context.
If open contact were allowed
throughout tlie entire freshman
year, as was suggested, the rush
ee would suffer more than he
would gain. While the IFC ap
preciates the advice and varying
opinions of other campus inter
est groups, we are singularly
able to realize the vast competi
tive spirit that pervades the Row
during rushing.
To open freshman residences
to free contact throughout the
year would create such strong de
sire among the fraternities to
carry on a rush program
throughout that time that not
only would freshmen become ex
hausted with the procedure, but
fraternity pocket books would be
hit hard to keep up the pace.
In spite of the deterrent forces
that financial burden and aca
demic conflict would naturally
have against such an extended
period of rush, it is our feeling
that the competition and pres

sure to "get to work early"
would create mayhem in the
freshman residences and cause
greater distraction than benefit
to the rushee.
It is in this light that Pete
Hedegard arid I made our state
ment doubting the fraternity sys
tem's responsibility in carrying
on a year-long rush program.
We are not condemning our

own system, as the editorial
scorns to suggest, but merely
protecting it. In fact, we are
w o r king actively to improve
upon the rush program, as you
have seen. On this point I sin
cerely hope that you and your
readers will no longer he "dis
turbed."
