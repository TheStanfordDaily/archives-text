## Underdeveloped Nations Require Economic Aid 
### Woody Moyle ASSU-IIR Political Analyst 
We are all aware of the impor
tance of the underdeveloped coun-|
tries of the world to the security j
of the West. Their millions of
people and vital resources are nec
essary to the maintenance of our
society, as we know it, over lime.
The biggest problem facing
those areas is not our defense,
however, but their own economic
development. That development I
must then become a primary in
-1 crest of the United States.
The development of the econ
omies of the low income areas ol
the globe requires an accumula
tion of capital. In most cases the
people of underdeveloped nations
do not have the ability to amass
the capital necessary from inter
nal sources.
Present capital formation can
be brought about only through
denial of present consumption, an
unhealthy denial from the view
point of the West. Economic ex
pansion through internal capital!
formation has been successful 1
only twice in Communist Rus
sia and Imperialist Japan.
II is nalural for an underdevel
oped country which is unable to
formulate sufficient capital in
vestment through its own efforts'
to look for outside help. Help
which, at the present lime, is
coming primarily from foreign in
vestment and American economic
aid. The abilities of private in
vestment are limited, so economic
aid becomes necessary especial
ly when we consider the fact that
if that aid does not come from us
it will come from the Soviet
Union.
At the present time economic
aid is given only under certain

renditions thai are politically in
spired. We are using economic aid
as an immediate political tool.
There are certain drawbacks as
sociated with our present pro
gram. One is that we cannot guar
antee l»y treaty the actions of
other nations in emergency situa
tions. A nation forced into an
agreement will not necessarily
keep thai agreement, and in emer
gency situations we woidd not
have adequate means of enforce
ment.
Another drawback is the resent
ment created hy the immediate
polii ieal goals of our economic aid
program.
Is immediate gain necessary for
our economic aid program? The
answer is no, if we feel that West
ern ideology is superior to that of
the Communist block. If that is
the case all we need do is give the
underdeveloped nations the eco
nomic tools with which they may
build themselves, and they will
side with the Western cause of
their own volition.
We would then give our eco
nomic aid on the basis of econom
ic need and economic consump
tion capacity only. The expense
of a program so designed would
be only slightly greater than that
of our present politically oriented
system.
Our relations with underdevel
oped areas are of vital interest to
our security, and economic rela
tions play a large part:.

aid becomes necessary especial
ly when we consider the fact that
if that aid does not come from us
it will come from the Soviet
Union.
At the present time economic
aid is given only under certain

renditions thai are politically in
spired. We are using economic aid
as an immediate political tool.
There are certain drawbacks as
sociated with our present pro
gram. One is that we cannot guar
antee l»y treaty the actions of
other nations in emergency situa
tions. A nation forced into an
agreement will not necessarily
keep thai agreement, and in emer
gency situations we woidd not
have adequate means of enforce
ment.
Another drawback is the resent
ment created hy the immediate
polii ieal goals of our economic aid
program.
Is immediate gain necessary for
our economic aid program? The
answer is no, if we feel that West
ern ideology is superior to that of
the Communist block. If that is
the case all we need do is give the
underdeveloped nations the eco
nomic tools with which they may
build themselves, and they will
side with the Western cause of
their own volition.
We would then give our eco
nomic aid on the basis of econom
ic need and economic consump
tion capacity only. The expense
of a program so designed would
be only slightly greater than that
of our present politically oriented
system.
Our relations with underdevel
oped areas are of vital interest to
our security, and economic rela
tions play a large part:.
We are all aware of the impor
tance of the underdeveloped coun-|
tries of the world to the security j
of the West. Their millions of
people and vital resources are nec
essary to the maintenance of our
society, as we know it, over lime.
The biggest problem facing
those areas is not our defense,
however, but their own economic
development. That development I
must then become a primary in
-1 crest of the United States.
The development of the econ
omies of the low income areas ol
the globe requires an accumula
tion of capital. In most cases the
people of underdeveloped nations
do not have the ability to amass
the capital necessary from inter
nal sources.
Present capital formation can
be brought about only through
denial of present consumption, an
unhealthy denial from the view
point of the West. Economic ex
pansion through internal capital!
formation has been successful 1
only twice in Communist Rus
sia and Imperialist Japan.
II is nalural for an underdevel
oped country which is unable to
formulate sufficient capital in
vestment through its own efforts'
to look for outside help. Help
which, at the present lime, is
coming primarily from foreign in
vestment and American economic
aid. The abilities of private in
vestment are limited, so economic
aid becomes necessary especial
ly when we consider the fact that
if that aid does not come from us
it will come from the Soviet
