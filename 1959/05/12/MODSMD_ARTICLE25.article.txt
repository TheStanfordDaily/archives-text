A Little Hit of Confusion
Thorp is a moss. It's on thp intercollegiate baseball scene, and
ii concerns just who is going to represent thp Pacific Coast ('outer
cncc in the NC A A playoffs. If anybody.
Ol course, there are several simple solutions. One of them woul<
lie for Stanford to win all the rest of its PCX' games (three in mun
her) and lie Southern California for the title almost assuring lh<
eligible Indians of a playoff spot.
( a , it SC wins the Southern Division but loses the PCC playofi
to the Northern champion, things would be settled. This could be
unlikely. And il the Trojans win (he Southern Division (they'vi
cinched .1 tiel, and then the PCC, who will represent the conference
in the first NC A A rounds? Southern Cal, you see, is ineligible to
I lie NCAA.
A week ago, most everyone seemed certain thai Stanford, being
the top ranking "eligible," would get the playoff hid automatically
And il might be thai way if the NCAA was concerned with the ac
tion. But the PCC is the first step and it has ruled that if CSC wins
the Southern Division, il is eligible to play in the North-South play
off. And, traditionally, the winner of the N'orth-South playofi has
played the winner of an at-large series for the right to get into th<
College Baseball World Series at

()maha.
The nalional newspaper, Colle
giate wrote last week,
under a headline "Stanford Ap
pears Scl for I'layoffs": ". . . and
since the I niversity of Southern
California is ineligible for NCAA
compel it ton, the Indians should
be the pick to represent the CI
HA." Th e newspaper misfired
there, because the CIBA means
nothing, NCAA-wise, doing on,
the article says,"The CIBA run
ner-up would comprise a logical
playoli choice for the district
eight title, which the NCAA un
fortunately reiterated that South
ern C'al could not defend."
Card coach Dutch Fehring sees
no answer for at least a week or •
so, or until the regular PCC sea
son is over for Stanford, May 23.
An "at large" berth is only a re- |
mote possibility, if the Tribe
loses out in Southern Division
play.

There is one "at large" possi
bility. As it stands now, there would he no precedent for picking the
PCT second place team as an at large team. San Diego State was
the lirsl choice for the spot last year but declined to go into the
NAIA, which it eventually won. Should Sail Diego (or the CCAA
champion) do that again this year, the field would be open. Up
north, the top at large possibility is Seattle University, which is
ineligible for NCAA under basketball penalties. There is no close
second to Seattle among the independents, so why not an at large
playoff between the Northern runner-up and the Southern runner-up.
It's a thought. But the simplest thing would be for the Tribe to
hang a couple on USC this weekend.
Trojans Waul Relay Revenue
Stanford vs. SC doesn't end with baseball. Friday evening, there
should be quite a rematch in the Coliseum Relays between the Indian
and Trojan two-mile relay teams.
They met Saturday at Fresno, with the Cards breezing home on
Ilt*t)i«* CunliiTe's I :•!{). 1 anchor 880. But these Trojans have warned
;i few ol the Tribesmen that they'll be ready Friday at the Coliseum
rematch.
I S( may better its 7:28.8 time, but look for Stanford to better
its 7:2.") I lime and win just as convincingly.
A real big goal for the Cards is the 7:20.0 world mark set last
year bv Don liowden-led California. It may be out of reach this
week. hut anything could happen at the California Relays in Modesto
in three weeks. The splits on Saturday's victory: Dick Lassen,
1:52.3; Don Chesarek, 1:51.2; Bertil Lundh, 1:52.5, and Cunliffe's
1:19.4.
Lundli holds the key. The little Norwegian could knock off at
least two, and maybe three seconds, with a top performance. Re
member, he had a 1:17 in Europe last summer. Lassen, who ran
his best of the year at Fresno but insists he could knock about a
second mom off of that (lie was bumped and knocked off stride in
the home stretch where he tightened a little). Chesarek ran his
lirsl half mile of the year, turning in a strong first lap and not slow
ing down on the second for a great 1:51.2. He might really get down
nexl week. And Cuuliffc, with the nation's top half-mile time, still
says he can do better.
Look for < hesarek to be in the half al the PCC meet in Seattle
next week. As Coach Paylon Jordan has been claiming for three
years, the XXO may be Cliesarek's race, but as ( lies has been the
Tribe's lop quarter miler for three years and with guys like < unllfie,
l.asscn and Norm Lloyd around, who needs half-milers? Bui Chesa
rck may close his PCC career as an 880 man.
