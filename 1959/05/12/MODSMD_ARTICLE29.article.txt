'CC's Southern Division.
Friday and Saturday, Stanford
s in the Southland meeting USC

meeting of the season between
Ihe Indians and Broncs with
Stanford currently holding a 2 1
?dge in the season series.
Santa Clara won the first
neeting last month on its home
icld, 7-1, but the Tribe came back
he next day with a 7.1 victory at
he Sunken Diamond. Then, three
.vceks ago, Stanford's Karl Rus
»ell whitewashed the Bronocs, 1-0.
Jim O'Rourke, Bronco center
Welder who bashed a mighty
homer in his only other Sunken
Diamond appearance, crashed
three more in three games last
weekend.
In fact, last weekend was quite
eventful for Santa Clara. It start
ed off with a pretty-much expect
ed win over UCLA Friday (the
Bruins' lone CIBA win is over
the Broncos). O'Rourke's three
run blast was the key in the 6-f>
victory over the Uclans. Then.
Saturday, USC came to town and
Santa Clara cut down the mighty
Trojans, 3-2, behind a fine pitch
ing job by Dick Creighton and
thanks to O'Rourke's seventh-in
ning home run.

Saturday's second game saw a
little bit of hand-slapping. Fair
ly disgusted with their northern
reception, the Trojans showed
their displeasure by clobbering
the Broncos, 17-2. A basey-empty
shot by O'Rourke was Ihe only
exciting thing that happened for

Simla Clara in that game.
Croighton, who halt led SO,
may he coach Bill Leonard's
mound choice against Iho Tribe
although another good bet is big
Lct'ty Frank Sobrero, who has
already laced Stanford twice this
year.
