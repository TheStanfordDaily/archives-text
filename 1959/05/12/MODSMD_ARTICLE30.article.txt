along well in UCLA meet and
ran excellent race at Mt. SAC.
Played key role in Stanford's
, Big Meet mile sweep, taking
j second and holding slow pace
i most of way. Has been ham

i ting him off in the midst of
goorl string of performances,
j Season's best time is 9:21.6.

lias become Stanford's load
ing two-miler since injuries
sidelined Keith Wallace for the
year. Ran almost 4:20.0 at San
Diego Hoover High, but did not
enjoy especially distinguished
frosh or soph years here. Came
into his own in UCLA meet
with excellent 9:18.1 victory,
then ran 9:10.7 at Mt. SAC Re
lays. Ran poorly under pres
sure of pace in Big Meet. Could
threaten in PCC meet, and
