"The boys are giving it their
nil."
Those are the words Hint roach
Jack Curtice used to describe
spring football, moving into its
final week. Practice will end
with .Stanford's first-ever alumni
game on May Hi.
It looks as if Stanford can look
forward to a much sounder fool
ball team than last year after the
showing the team has made in
spring practice. The players' re
actions are good, they have
learned ;i great deal during the
spring and the coaching staff is
well pleased with the showing.
The Indians enga g e d in a
three-hour scrimmage last Satur
day in the stadium with all get
ting a chance to show their abil
ity. And many did just that. The
quarterbacks, Dick Norman and
Rod Sears, have had oidy one
pass intercepted in the two
scrimmages in the spring prac
tice. But passing was not the
whole story. The teams mixed
the passing and running attacks
well, with John Bond and Hick
McMillen looking very good for
tlie rushing forces.
The line did all that was ex
pected of them with Gary Pike,
Dean Hinshaw, Cap Ingham,
Trev Grimm, Doug Pursell and
Chris Cottle showing up well for
the 'Reds" and "Greens." Rich
Hearney shows great promise at
the end position, after moving
from center.
The high point of the scrim
mage was when the "Reds" held
the "Greens" on the one-yard line
and then drove 99 yards for the
score.
