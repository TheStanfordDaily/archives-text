ADVENTURES IN SOCIAL SCIENCE: NO. 3
Today, ranging again into the fascinating world of sociid science,
lot ns take up the subject of anthropology—the study of man
and his origins.
The origin of man was indeed a puzzle until the Frenchman,
Jean-Louis Sigafoos, discovered the skull and shinhone of
Pithecanthropus Ereetus in Java in 1891. VYhut Sigafoos \v:is
doing in Java is, incidentally, quite an odd little story. Sigafoos
was a Parisian born and bred. By day one could always find
him at a sidewalk cafe, sipping barley water and ogling the
girls; each night he went to a fashionable casino where he
gambled heavily at roulette and go-fish; in between times he
worked on his stamp collection, which was one of the large-!
in Paris.

Well sir, one summer Sigafoos lost his entire fortune gambling
at the casino, lie was seriously contemplating suicide when,
<111it<* unexpectedly, a letter arrived from one l-otus Petal
McCinnis, a Javanese girl and an avid stamp collector, with
whom Sigafoos had been corresponding from time to time
through the international stamp collectors journal. I ntil now
the nature of their correspondence, though friendly, had been
strictly philatelic, but in this new letter Lotus Petal declared
that although she had never laid eyes on Sigafoos, she loved
him and wanted to marry him. She said she was eighteen years
old, beautiful and docile, and her father, the richest man in the
tribe, had agreed to give half his fortune to the husband of her
choice. Sigafoos, penniless and desperate, immediately booked
passage for .lava.
The first sight of his prospective bride failed to delight Siga
foos. She was, as she said, beautiful —but only by local stand
ards. Sigafoos had serious doubts that her pointed scarlet teeth
and the chicken bones hanging from her ears would be con
sidered chic along the Champs Klys<Vs.
lint sobering as was the sight of Lotus Petal, Sigafoos had
an even greater disappointment coming when he met her father.
The old gentleman was, as Lotus Petal claimed, the richest man
in the tribe, but, unfortunately, the medium of exchange in Lis
tribe was prune pits.
Sigafoos took one look at the mound of prune pits which was
his dowry, gnashed his teeth, and stomped off into the jungle,
swearing vilely and kicking at whatever lay in his path. Stomp
ing thus, swearing thus, kicking thus, Sigafoos kicked over .*»
heap of old bones which —what do you know!—turned out to
be Pithecanthropus Erectus!
Hut 1 disgress. From the brutish Pithecanthropus, man
evolved slowly upward in intellect. P»y the Middle Paleolithic
period man had invented the leash, which was a remarkable
technical achievement, but frankly not particularly useful until
the Mesolithie period when man invented the dog.
In the Neolithic period came the most important discovery
in the history of man —the discovery of agriculture. Whv this
so important? Because, good friends, without agriculture there
would be no tobacco, and without tobacco there would be no
Marlboro, and without Marlboro you would be without the
finest filter cigarette that money can buy, and I would be with
out a job.

<111it<* unexpectedly, a letter arrived from one l-otus Petal
McCinnis, a Javanese girl and an avid stamp collector, with
whom Sigafoos had been corresponding from time to time
through the international stamp collectors journal. I ntil now
the nature of their correspondence, though friendly, had been
strictly philatelic, but in this new letter Lotus Petal declared
that although she had never laid eyes on Sigafoos, she loved
him and wanted to marry him. She said she was eighteen years
old, beautiful and docile, and her father, the richest man in the
tribe, had agreed to give half his fortune to the husband of her
choice. Sigafoos, penniless and desperate, immediately booked
passage for .lava.
The first sight of his prospective bride failed to delight Siga
foos. She was, as she said, beautiful —but only by local stand
ards. Sigafoos had serious doubts that her pointed scarlet teeth
and the chicken bones hanging from her ears would be con
sidered chic along the Champs Klys<Vs.
lint sobering as was the sight of Lotus Petal, Sigafoos had
an even greater disappointment coming when he met her father.
The old gentleman was, as Lotus Petal claimed, the richest man
in the tribe, but, unfortunately, the medium of exchange in Lis
tribe was prune pits.
Sigafoos took one look at the mound of prune pits which was
his dowry, gnashed his teeth, and stomped off into the jungle,
swearing vilely and kicking at whatever lay in his path. Stomp
ing thus, swearing thus, kicking thus, Sigafoos kicked over .*»
heap of old bones which —what do you know!—turned out to
be Pithecanthropus Erectus!
Hut 1 disgress. From the brutish Pithecanthropus, man
evolved slowly upward in intellect. P»y the Middle Paleolithic
period man had invented the leash, which was a remarkable
technical achievement, but frankly not particularly useful until
the Mesolithie period when man invented the dog.
In the Neolithic period came the most important discovery
in the history of man —the discovery of agriculture. Whv this
so important? Because, good friends, without agriculture there
would be no tobacco, and without tobacco there would be no
Marlboro, and without Marlboro you would be without the
finest filter cigarette that money can buy, and I would be with

Today, ranging again into the fascinating world of sociid science,
lot ns take up the subject of anthropology—the study of man
and his origins.
The origin of man was indeed a puzzle until the Frenchman,
Jean-Louis Sigafoos, discovered the skull and shinhone of
Pithecanthropus Ereetus in Java in 1891. VYhut Sigafoos \v:is
doing in Java is, incidentally, quite an odd little story. Sigafoos
was a Parisian born and bred. By day one could always find
him at a sidewalk cafe, sipping barley water and ogling the
girls; each night he went to a fashionable casino where he
gambled heavily at roulette and go-fish; in between times he
worked on his stamp collection, which was one of the large-!
in Paris.
