## 
### Dave Quarles 
Notes of urgency echoed in Un
ion Court yesterday between 11
a.m. and 1:30 p.m. as students
and faculty discussed arms and
world peace.
Giving their own thoughts on
the question, "Can lasting world
peace and the containment of
the Communist Ihreat be
achieved by a predominantly mil
itary power?" .six Stanford fac
ulty members and six students
addressed a changing audience
of about 150.
Nearly all of the 10- to 15-min
ute speeches contained critical
views of the present cold war sit
uation while emphasizing the
need for individual thought on
world problems.
Elemental Thinking
"This is a time for elemental
thinking," said Jeffery Smith,
the fir.st faculty member to speak
on the program. "World peace
will not be achieved by people
who see life as a game.
"Civilization surrounds us as a
smog. We must judge what it
worth preserving and then work
for it with a constructive power
equally as strong as the destruc
tive power of the atom bomb,"
said Smith.
Professor Harry R a th b un
placed emphasis on the value of
law in solving the present world
crisis. "Although self-control is
the ifleal, law is effective because
it is a compromise recognizing
reality without losing sight of
the ideal," said Rathbun.
War and Responsibility
Robert North of the Political
Sc ie n e e Department barraged
the audience with a series of
questions on war, international
development and personal re
sponsibility.
Student speakers emphasized
the deficiency of present at
tempts at peace. English ex
change scholar Dick Thomas rec
ommended that disengagement
be given more serious considera
tion as the first step to construc
tive international order.
Berating today's military ap
proach to the cold war, Steve
Breyer pointed out that the short
term military view opposes flexi
bility as well as rejects the neu
tralist world, thereby conceding
a large part of the battleground
to the opponent.
Keio scholar Yoshi Tsumuri
emphasized that 14 uncommitted
Asian nations upon which the
United Stales must depend are
demanding suspension of nuclear
testing.
The program was co-sponsored
by the Fellowship of Reconcilia
tion and the YWCA.
