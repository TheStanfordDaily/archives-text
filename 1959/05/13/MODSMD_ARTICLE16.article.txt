# Art Show Enjoyable
## 
### 
The other day we spent a pleasant hour looking at paintings,
furniture, textiles, renderings, and other things, at the annual
spring show of student art work now at the Art Gallery.
Some very fine pieees of work are included. And not the least
pleasant feature of the show is the tasteful arrangement of thÂ»*
exhibits.
The exhibit will be there through the end of this week. We
urge students who may not already have done so to treat them
selves to a worthwhile and enjoyable bit of looking.
