# Evaluation Needed Of Con Home Drive
## 
### Dave Quarles 
Although tabulation of Con
Home Week contributions is still
incomplete, the figures indicate
that the $12,000 goal will soon be
reached. It is already apparent
that a 43-year record of collections
on campus has been broken.
In the midst of overwhelming
success and self - congratulation
Stanford students might do well
to pause for an evaluation of Con
Home Week and its part in cam
pus life.
The Stanford Convalescent
Home is not only located on cam
pus but is housed in the old Stan
ford mansion. These two facts
make Con Home an integral part
of the local Stanford community.
And certainly any charity can log
ically expect some support from
its immediate community.
An expansion program, and the
maintenance of a special school
program as well as the normal
medical facilities necessarily
make Con Home's budget high.
The total operating expenses for
one day alone come to $1,450.
Eight Days
Over half of the tremendous
amount of funds necessary for
Con Home's operational expenses
comes from national and county
health and welfare organizations,
while 16 per cent of the total is
raised by local auxiliaries. Stan
ford students contribute only 2Va
per cent of the yearly expenses.
In other words, student contribu
tions run Con Home for only eight
and a fraction days each year.
At first glance it would seem a
paltry 2Vs per cent is the least
Stanford students can do for Con
Home. Yet figures alone are mis
leading.
The fact is that only a certain
amount of money is given by our
students each year for public use.
And of the three major fund rais
ing campaigns on campus, World
University Service, Winter Drive,
and Con Home, the latter claims
74 per cent of the total collected.
Even this figure is low when one
remembers that part of Winter
Drive's funds go to the YWCA,
which in turn supports Con Home.
Nearly every charity and public
service is worthwhile. Since all
fund raising campaigns cannot be
supported, the question arises as
to which organizations will use
the contributor's money in a way
suitable to his social outlook: a
student would contribute to the
World University Service, where
as a coal miner would be more
likely to give money to an unem
ployment relief fund.
Range of Interests
As a large and well-known uni
versity, Stanford has a wide range
of interests. Although located in
Santa Clara County, California,
Stanford occupies an important
position in the national and inter

national academic world. More
over, we as students from a num
ber of different states and nations
share in the University's broad
range of interests.
Consider Position
We therefore must ask our
selves if, considering our position
in the academic world as well as
our nine month residence in Santa
Clara County, the services of Con
Home merit 74 per cent of our
total yearly public contributions.
Certainly there are a great
number of projects which could
draw our attention. Besides the
World University Service there
are the opportunities of student
organized foreign scholarship ex
changes, which are of benefit to
our students, foreign students,
and to both countries. One case
in point is the projected Warsaw
student-exchange, which faces an
uncertain future because of our
lack of $1,500.
The point is not specifically the
Warsaw exchange or the World
University Service, but it is that
we be aware of the imaginative,
creative, and appropriate uses
constantly available for the lim
ited amount of money we as stu
dent? contribute each year.
Concentration
Con Home Week is a charitable
tradition at a university which
prides itself on the lack of narrow
tradition. Its emotional power is
enhanced by the fact that students
can see their money at work. This
does not diminish Con Home's
worthwhile activities nor deny its
place in the Stanford community.
But the fact that Con Home char
ity can be seen in action does tend
to concentrate Stanford students'
yearly allotment of charitable ar
dor into one week of Spring Quar
ter.
The simple fact that Con Home
Week has become a carnival is
also important in attracting stu
dents' attention and money. It is
obviously easier and more fun to
bet on Heidi as Con Home Queen
than it is to imagine the value of
the World University Service.
Lopsided
Although student organizers
may take rightful pride in the suc
cess of this year's Con Home
Week, we as contributors should
recognize the basic fact that our
yearly donations to charity are
lopsided.
The ideal solution would be to
contribute more money so that
Stanford can continue to support
its 2Vz per cent shai'e in Con
Home as well as undertake other
imaginative programs suitable to
a large university.
But until a substantial increase
in student income and charitable
spirit arises, each student will
have to appraise his own position
before submerging himself in tlie
hoopla of strawberries and whip
ped cream in Union Court.

the contributor's money in a way
suitable to his social outlook: a
student would contribute to the
World University Service, where
as a coal miner would be more
likely to give money to an unem
ployment relief fund.
Range of Interests
As a large and well-known uni
versity, Stanford has a wide range
of interests. Although located in
Santa Clara County, California,
Stanford occupies an important
position in the national and inter

national academic world. More
over, we as students from a num
ber of different states and nations
share in the University's broad
range of interests.
Consider Position
We therefore must ask our
selves if, considering our position
in the academic world as well as
our nine month residence in Santa
Clara County, the services of Con
Home merit 74 per cent of our
total yearly public contributions.
Certainly there are a great
number of projects which could
draw our attention. Besides the
World University Service there
are the opportunities of student
organized foreign scholarship ex
changes, which are of benefit to
our students, foreign students,
and to both countries. One case
in point is the projected Warsaw
student-exchange, which faces an
uncertain future because of our
lack of $1,500.
The point is not specifically the
Warsaw exchange or the World
University Service, but it is that
we be aware of the imaginative,
creative, and appropriate uses
constantly available for the lim
ited amount of money we as stu
dent? contribute each year.
Concentration
Con Home Week is a charitable
tradition at a university which
prides itself on the lack of narrow
tradition. Its emotional power is
enhanced by the fact that students
can see their money at work. This
does not diminish Con Home's
worthwhile activities nor deny its
place in the Stanford community.
But the fact that Con Home char
ity can be seen in action does tend
to concentrate Stanford students'
yearly allotment of charitable ar
dor into one week of Spring Quar
ter.
The simple fact that Con Home
Week has become a carnival is
also important in attracting stu
dents' attention and money. It is
obviously easier and more fun to
bet on Heidi as Con Home Queen
than it is to imagine the value of
the World University Service.
Lopsided
Although student organizers
may take rightful pride in the suc
cess of this year's Con Home
Week, we as contributors should
recognize the basic fact that our
yearly donations to charity are
lopsided.
The ideal solution would be to
contribute more money so that
Stanford can continue to support
its 2Vz per cent shai'e in Con
Home as well as undertake other
imaginative programs suitable to
a large university.
But until a substantial increase
in student income and charitable
spirit arises, each student will
have to appraise his own position
before submerging himself in tlie
hoopla of strawberries and whip
ped cream in Union Court.
Although tabulation of Con
Home Week contributions is still
incomplete, the figures indicate
that the $12,000 goal will soon be
reached. It is already apparent
that a 43-year record of collections
on campus has been broken.
In the midst of overwhelming
success and self - congratulation
Stanford students might do well
to pause for an evaluation of Con
Home Week and its part in cam
pus life.
The Stanford Convalescent
Home is not only located on cam
pus but is housed in the old Stan
ford mansion. These two facts
make Con Home an integral part
of the local Stanford community.
And certainly any charity can log
ically expect some support from
its immediate community.
An expansion program, and the
maintenance of a special school
program as well as the normal
medical facilities necessarily
make Con Home's budget high.
The total operating expenses for
one day alone come to $1,450.
Eight Days
Over half of the tremendous
amount of funds necessary for
Con Home's operational expenses
comes from national and county
health and welfare organizations,
while 16 per cent of the total is
raised by local auxiliaries. Stan
ford students contribute only 2Va
per cent of the yearly expenses.
In other words, student contribu
tions run Con Home for only eight
and a fraction days each year.
At first glance it would seem a
paltry 2Vs per cent is the least
Stanford students can do for Con
Home. Yet figures alone are mis
leading.
The fact is that only a certain
amount of money is given by our
students each year for public use.
And of the three major fund rais
ing campaigns on campus, World
University Service, Winter Drive,
and Con Home, the latter claims
74 per cent of the total collected.
Even this figure is low when one
remembers that part of Winter
Drive's funds go to the YWCA,
which in turn supports Con Home.
Nearly every charity and public
service is worthwhile. Since all
fund raising campaigns cannot be
supported, the question arises as
to which organizations will use
the contributor's money in a way
suitable to his social outlook: a
student would contribute to the
World University Service, where
as a coal miner would be more

obviously easier and more fun to
bet on Heidi as Con Home Queen
than it is to imagine the value of
the World University Service.
Lopsided
Although student organizers
may take rightful pride in the suc
cess of this year's Con Home
Week, we as contributors should
recognize the basic fact that our
yearly donations to charity are
lopsided.
The ideal solution would be to
contribute more money so that
Stanford can continue to support
its 2Vz per cent shai'e in Con
Home as well as undertake other
imaginative programs suitable to
a large university.
But until a substantial increase
in student income and charitable
spirit arises, each student will
have to appraise his own position
before submerging himself in tlie
hoopla of strawberries and whip
ped cream in Union Court.
Although tabulation of Con
Home Week contributions is still
incomplete, the figures indicate
that the $12,000 goal will soon be
reached. It is already apparent
that a 43-year record of collections
on campus has been broken.
In the midst of overwhelming
success and self - congratulation
Stanford students might do well
to pause for an evaluation of Con
Home Week and its part in cam
pus life.
The Stanford Convalescent
Home is not only located on cam
pus but is housed in the old Stan
ford mansion. These two facts
make Con Home an integral part
of the local Stanford community.
And certainly any charity can log
ically expect some support from
its immediate community.
An expansion program, and the
maintenance of a special school
program as well as the normal
medical facilities necessarily
make Con Home's budget high.
The total operating expenses for
one day alone come to $1,450.
Eight Days
Over half of the tremendous
amount of funds necessary for
Con Home's operational expenses
comes from national and county
health and welfare organizations,
while 16 per cent of the total is
raised by local auxiliaries. Stan
ford students contribute only 2Va
per cent of the yearly expenses.
In other words, student contribu
tions run Con Home for only eight
and a fraction days each year.
At first glance it would seem a
paltry 2Vs per cent is the least
Stanford students can do for Con
Home. Yet figures alone are mis
leading.
The fact is that only a certain
amount of money is given by our
students each year for public use.
And of the three major fund rais
ing campaigns on campus, World
University Service, Winter Drive,
and Con Home, the latter claims
74 per cent of the total collected.
Even this figure is low when one
remembers that part of Winter
Drive's funds go to the YWCA,
which in turn supports Con Home.
Nearly every charity and public
service is worthwhile. Since all
fund raising campaigns cannot be
supported, the question arises as
to which organizations will use
the contributor's money in a way
suitable to his social outlook: a
student would contribute to the
World University Service, where
as a coal miner would be more
likely to give money to an unem
ployment relief fund.
Range of Interests
As a large and well-known uni
versity, Stanford has a wide range
of interests. Although located in
Santa Clara County, California,
Stanford occupies an important
position in the national and inter

national academic world. More
over, we as students from a num
ber of different states and nations
share in the University's broad
range of interests.
Consider Position
We therefore must ask our
selves if, considering our position
in the academic world as well as
our nine month residence in Santa
Clara County, the services of Con
Home merit 74 per cent of our
total yearly public contributions.
Certainly there are a great
number of projects which could
draw our attention. Besides the
World University Service there
are the opportunities of student
organized foreign scholarship ex
changes, which are of benefit to
our students, foreign students,
and to both countries. One case
in point is the projected Warsaw
student-exchange, which faces an
uncertain future because of our
lack of $1,500.
The point is not specifically the
Warsaw exchange or the World
University Service, but it is that
we be aware of the imaginative,
creative, and appropriate uses
constantly available for the lim
ited amount of money we as stu
dent? contribute each year.
Concentration
Con Home Week is a charitable
tradition at a university which
prides itself on the lack of narrow
tradition. Its emotional power is
enhanced by the fact that students
can see their money at work. This
does not diminish Con Home's
worthwhile activities nor deny its
place in the Stanford community.
But the fact that Con Home char
ity can be seen in action does tend
to concentrate Stanford students'
yearly allotment of charitable ar
dor into one week of Spring Quar
ter.
The simple fact that Con Home
Week has become a carnival is
also important in attracting stu
dents' attention and money. It is
obviously easier and more fun to
bet on Heidi as Con Home Queen
than it is to imagine the value of
the World University Service.
