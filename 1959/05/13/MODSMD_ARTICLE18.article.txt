Dreadful!
Editor, The Daily:
We really think it is just dread
ful the way they persist in plant
ing new bushes and trees on this
'■ampus! Doesn't the administra
' realize that it is jeopardizing
■)UT T woman's reputation and
ler Conduct Becoming a Stan
fir 1 Woman?
These trees and bushes are
lasted in such strategic areas
\s 'o make an evening stroll
through Quad a temptation to
forbidden thoughts. Girls are al
ways told by their housemothers
to walk in pairs through Quad
because of the possibility of
strange men lurking in the bush
es— what about one's date? —
there seems to be a certain inex
plicable fascination for those
bushes.

Also, what about a more effec
tive lighting system in the
stacks? It does get awfully dark
in there when one's date neglects
f o turn on the lights, especially
dark in the more remote corners.
.Ve really hate to have study
lates at the Libe because of these
"actors.
In addition to the above men
ioned, if one's date is fortunate
enough 1o have a car, the walk
way between the Libe and Cub
)orley is also in urgent need of
lighting — for one must usually
pass through this walkway on
one's way to the car.
Yours sincerely in the hope
'hat action will not be delayed
in regard to these matters.
