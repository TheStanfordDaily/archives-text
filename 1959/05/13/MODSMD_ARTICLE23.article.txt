# Tonight at the Symphony
## Program to be All Orchestral 
### Diana Smith 
Tradition stalks the ends of
things as faithfully as their be
ginnings: this is the last week of
the San Francisco Symphony
season, and so it follows, tradi
tionally, that the program will
be an all-orchestral one.
(The opening week's concerts
are, traditionally, all • orchestral
too, the difference being that
opening week the National An
them is also played.)
To open closing week the or
chestra will play the Overture to
Mozart's comic opera, "The Ab
duction from the Seraglio." It is
one of only two of his operas hav
ing German and not Italian
texts; this one was inspired by
the German Singspiel, a kind of
musical variety show popular in
the Germany and Austria of Mo
zart's time. Its spoken dialogue
and its burlesque comic tendency
Mozart adopted for his opera.
Second is the splendid tone
poem by Richard Strauss, "Kin
Heldenleben." The tale of "A
Hero's Life" is spun out in six
uninterrupted sections.
In the first, the violins and
horns unravel the various strains
of the hero's theme; the second
introduces his adversaries and
the hero's initial encounter with
them, and the third is the music
of the hero and his beloved.
After a victoriously battled
fourth section, the hero moves
to his peacetime achievements.
Strauss restates in this firth sec
tion themes from others of his
tone poems. And the final sec
tion solemnly tell of the hero's
mortal departure.
Concluding the program is the

Schubert Symphony No. 7 in C
major, l! was written after the
Symphony No. S, the "Unfin
ished," and so is actually No. 9,
but it was published before the
"Unfinished," which is how it got

to bo No. 7. Anyway, il is called
the "(heal" Symphony after its
impressive orchestral dimensions.
Schubert wrote the C major
Symphony the year before his
death in 1828, and it remained
unknown until Schumann un
earthed it on a visit, lo Vienna
a decade later, had il published,
and interested Mendelssohn in
conducting its premiere perform
ance in 1839.

them is also played.)
To open closing week the or
chestra will play the Overture to
Mozart's comic opera, "The Ab
duction from the Seraglio." It is
one of only two of his operas hav
ing German and not Italian
texts; this one was inspired by
the German Singspiel, a kind of
musical variety show popular in
the Germany and Austria of Mo
zart's time. Its spoken dialogue
and its burlesque comic tendency
Mozart adopted for his opera.
Second is the splendid tone
poem by Richard Strauss, "Kin
Heldenleben." The tale of "A
Hero's Life" is spun out in six
uninterrupted sections.
In the first, the violins and
horns unravel the various strains
of the hero's theme; the second
introduces his adversaries and
the hero's initial encounter with
them, and the third is the music
of the hero and his beloved.
After a victoriously battled
fourth section, the hero moves
to his peacetime achievements.
Strauss restates in this firth sec
tion themes from others of his
tone poems. And the final sec
tion solemnly tell of the hero's
mortal departure.
Concluding the program is the

Schubert Symphony No. 7 in C
major, l! was written after the
Symphony No. S, the "Unfin
ished," and so is actually No. 9,
but it was published before the
"Unfinished," which is how it got

to bo No. 7. Anyway, il is called
the "(heal" Symphony after its
impressive orchestral dimensions.
Schubert wrote the C major
Symphony the year before his
death in 1828, and it remained
unknown until Schumann un
earthed it on a visit, lo Vienna
a decade later, had il published,
and interested Mendelssohn in
conducting its premiere perform
ance in 1839.
