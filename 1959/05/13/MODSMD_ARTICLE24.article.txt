Ul>ly Girls
Editor, The Daily:
After four years at Stanford 1
feel obliged to express my views ;
on a subject close to my heart. I
feel that the admissions policy at
this University is all wrong. Too
many ugly girls are admitted.
There is no doubt but that com
parison with other universities
will show that Stanford girls,
even though they have a little
charm, are not good looking, j
Their ideas are trite; they are in- 1
terested in almost nothing, and
they do not even possess the j
necessary physical attributes to
make up for this appalling lack
of personality. 1 hope the admis
sions office will correct this situ
ation.
Also, T agree with Lester
O'Shea that all girls' grade point
averages should be printed in the

bawloul so that we can see which
ones are worth while taking out.
