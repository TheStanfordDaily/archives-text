The IT I \ Bruins make their annual trip to the Stanford tennis
courts this Friday afternoon and they bring with them one of the
best college teams, if not the best, in the country today.
The :im;!/ing thing about this U( f.A squad is that all but one o!
the m m te;im are sophomores. Only raptain and fourth man Dale
Icoliluikl i not o sophomore he will graduate this June.
The top three players on the Bruin squad, Allan Fox, Roger
Werksnutu, and Norm Terry all have two years more alter this one
and l ." fifth lid ixth men, Forrest Stewart and Mike Boiuk are
also ophv This sophomore studded team has only dropped one
match this .-•eason t hat being to the Southern California All-Stars,
who inckidi in their lineup such top netters as Mike Green, Alex
Olmedo, Mike Franks, and John Leseh.
The closest any college team has come to heating the Bruins is;
cross-town rival Southern Cal, which lost "only" 7-2. If this sopho
more team can win so easily now imagine how they'll be in two years.
Just to make things a little tougher for UCLA Coach -I. I). Morgan
he has two of the nation's best young tennis players on his current
freshman squad. Both Larry Nagler and Ld Sledge will probably
move up from the freshman squad to at least one of the top five spots
next year. Nagler recently went three sets with Alex Olmedo in a
best two out of three set match. Olmedo won 10 8 in the third.
H seems as though Mike Bouck, undefeated I his year at six, will
be moved nut ol the lineup next year.
Others Are Toii"h Too
n
UCLA, however, isn't the only West Coast team that should bo .
great in the next Knee years. Stanford, tJSC, and Cal all have the
nucleu : for promising futures.
Stanford loses three of its players at the end of this year: Dave
Nelson, Brooks Rawlins, and Lowell Carrutli. But: the Indians still
could have an excellent chance to upend UCLA next year. Chris
Crawford, with some of the most devastating ground strokes in tennis
today, is currently attending Menlo ,!.C. with his aims on Stanford.
Crawford, member of the U.S. Davis Cup team, if he were to make it
into Stanford (and that would bo for next season) would give Iho
Italians the classiest net tor in collegiate tennis.
Looking even a little further ahead, Stanford has a very strong
chance <»;' having both Dennis Ralston and Bill Bond, the number one
and two high school players in the nation, here at the Farm. Bond I
who is reputed to have the best serve in junior tenni-s and one of the
best ever known in that class is currently a junior in high school at
I,a Jolla and interested in Stanford. Ralston, a Bakersfield boy, is
thinking of either USC, UCLA, or Stanford. He also is a junior.

Cs< which has had troubles keeping its players healthy and eli
gible :his year could be very-strong next year. Fd Atkinson, an All-
Ameriean player last year, was out this season with a head injury
but will be back next year. Bob Delgado, one of Los Angeles' best
young tennis players has been in and out of USC but hopes to be back
and eligible next year. A third USC prospect is Rafael Asuno, a Mexi
can import who is the talk of the L.A. Tennis Club. Asuno, according
to many who have seen him, might be another Olmedo. He is quick
and has every move to be great. Asuno will be eligible as a sopho
more next year. Throw in Dick Greg Grant, and Al Tong from
this year's squad and you have a top team.
Cal, the weak link in California tennis for the past few years, is
making a comeback. The Bears have two top freshmen in Bill Hongs
and Mike Farrell and an undefeated freshman squad. On top of this
the Bears are counting on Torn Kdlel'son, northern California's top
young player, to enter the school next year.
All this fine young talent certainly makes it look as if California
college tennis will continue to dominate the nation's collegiate scene,
and it also promises top tennis for Stanford fans for many years to
come.

Cal, the weak link in California tennis for the past few years, is

lICLA Again
The IT I \ Bruins make their annual trip to the Stanford tennis
courts this Friday afternoon and they bring with them one of the
best college teams, if not the best, in the country today.
The :im;!/ing thing about this U( f.A squad is that all but one o!
the m m te;im are sophomores. Only raptain and fourth man Dale
Icoliluikl i not o sophomore he will graduate this June.
The top three players on the Bruin squad, Allan Fox, Roger
Werksnutu, and Norm Terry all have two years more alter this one
and l ." fifth lid ixth men, Forrest Stewart and Mike Boiuk are
also ophv This sophomore studded team has only dropped one
match this .-•eason t hat being to the Southern California All-Stars,
who inckidi in their lineup such top netters as Mike Green, Alex
Olmedo, Mike Franks, and John Leseh.
The closest any college team has come to heating the Bruins is;
cross-town rival Southern Cal, which lost "only" 7-2. If this sopho
more team can win so easily now imagine how they'll be in two years.
Just to make things a little tougher for UCLA Coach -I. I). Morgan
he has two of the nation's best young tennis players on his current
freshman squad. Both Larry Nagler and Ld Sledge will probably
move up from the freshman squad to at least one of the top five spots
next year. Nagler recently went three sets with Alex Olmedo in a
best two out of three set match. Olmedo won 10 8 in the third.
H seems as though Mike Bouck, undefeated I his year at six, will
be moved nut ol the lineup next year.
