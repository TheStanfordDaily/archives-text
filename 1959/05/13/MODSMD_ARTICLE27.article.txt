ROBINSON BFATS ONE OUT
Safe on fielder's choice in three-run seventh
.Stanford celebrated its return
to conference baseball action yes
terday by rolling to a 7-2 victory
over Santa Clara in a windy
game on the Sunken Diamond.
Karl Russell went the route for
the Indians in rolling to his
fourth California Intercollegiate
Baseball victory without defeat.
It was his second straight tri
umph over the Broncos, coupled
with last month's 1-0 whitewash
job at Santa Clara.
Cards Get Lead
Stanford jumped to the lead
early in yesterday's action when
Jim Burk opened the first inning
with a double and then scored on
a single to right by Mike Magee.
The Tribe added another in the
second when Joel Newkirk and
Hal Sehutzmann singled, Russell
was safe on a sacrifice bunt and
Rich DeFabio lashed a sacrifice
fly to right to score N'ewkirk.
Sehott Helps Out
Bronco pitcher Steve Sehott
committed two throwing errors
on sacrifice bunts to open the
gate for 1 the Cards' clinchers in
the bottom of the third.
Stanford added three more in
the seventh on another Brono
error, a walk, and singles by Art
von Wronski and Newkirk.
Once again double plays played
a big role for Stanford — the
Tribe had four this time. Biggest

was in the second inning when,
with the bases loaded and one
out, Santa Clara's Dennis Mc-
Grath bounced one back at Rus
sell to start a pitchei-to-home-to
first twin-killing.

ROBINSON BFATS ONE OUT
Safe on fielder's choice in three-run seventh
.Stanford celebrated its return
to conference baseball action yes
terday by rolling to a 7-2 victory
over Santa Clara in a windy
game on the Sunken Diamond.
Karl Russell went the route for
the Indians in rolling to his
fourth California Intercollegiate
Baseball victory without defeat.
It was his second straight tri
umph over the Broncos, coupled
with last month's 1-0 whitewash
job at Santa Clara.
Cards Get Lead
Stanford jumped to the lead
early in yesterday's action when
Jim Burk opened the first inning
with a double and then scored on
a single to right by Mike Magee.
The Tribe added another in the
second when Joel Newkirk and
Hal Sehutzmann singled, Russell
was safe on a sacrifice bunt and
Rich DeFabio lashed a sacrifice
fly to right to score N'ewkirk.
Sehott Helps Out
Bronco pitcher Steve Sehott
committed two throwing errors
on sacrifice bunts to open the
gate for 1 the Cards' clinchers in
the bottom of the third.
Stanford added three more in
the seventh on another Brono
error, a walk, and singles by Art
von Wronski and Newkirk.
Once again double plays played
a big role for Stanford — the
Tribe had four this time. Biggest

was in the second inning when,
with the bases loaded and one
out, Santa Clara's Dennis Mc-
Grath bounced one back at Rus
sell to start a pitchei-to-home-to
first twin-killing.
