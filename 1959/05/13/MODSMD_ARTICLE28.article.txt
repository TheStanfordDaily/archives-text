## 2-Mile Relay Team, Kelly To Coliseum 
### 
Stanford will contribute its
share 1o brilliant fields in tlie
two-mile relay and hop-step-jump
Friday night in the Los Angeles
Coliseum Relays.
The Indian two-mile quartet of
Dick Lassen, Bertil Lundh, Don
Chesarek and Ernie Cuniiffe will
join teams from Penn State, Oc
cidental, UCLA' and USC in a
race thut could come close to the
world record of 7:20.8.
Stanford, winner of the event
at Fresno's West Coast .Relays
last Saturday, currently holds
the fastest time in the world this
year, 7:25.4. USC gave the clos
est competition of the three
Southland schools last week in
a race the Trojans claim was
only a prep for the Coliseum re
match.
Payton Jordan will take John
Kelly to L.A. for both the triple
jump and broad jump.
The hop-step field, probably
better than even that of the 195(5
Olympic Trials, includes two
time Olympic champion Adhe
mar da Silva, U.S. Olympian Ira
Davis and Canadian champion
Jack Smyth of Houston.
Smyth hadn't lost a major re
lay meet crown for three years
until Kelly upset him at Drake
Relays last month.
