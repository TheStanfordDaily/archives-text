# Workshop Successful

### 
"This is an age of conferences,"
said C. Easton Rothwell, director
of the Hoover Institute, to the
group of 1G students who gath
ered at his home last January,
and so began the first Conference
Planning Workshop. This work
shop had been conceived by Roth
well and Arden Shenker, presi
dent of the lIR, as a means of in
forming interested students about
the methods of conducting a con
ference. Here was to be an op
portunity to gain the experience
of conference planning from ex
perienced men in the University.
After the initial meeting at
Roth well's in which the students
became acquainted with the enor
mity of the subject, alternating
Tuesday nights were set for
meetings at the homes of other
experienced University personnel.
In the succeeding weeks the
group heard from W. D. Craig,
Dean of Men; Dr. Yarborough,
director of residences; Hobart
Young, research associate of Hoo
ver Institution; Carl II Spaeth,
Dean of the Law School; Freder
ick O. Glover, assistant to the
president, and Peter Allen, direc
tor <»l news and publications, on
the suhjeels of purpose and scope
<>l a conference, housing, budget
and finances, agenda and work
ing papers, personnel, protocol,
publicity and public relations. A
fairly thorough knowledge of Hie
broad and detailed aspects of a
conference was the result.
At the last meeting, again at
Dr. Rothwell's home, it was
agreed by the group that the
workshop was extremely worth
while and should be repeated next
year. Stew Brand was elected as
the next chairman. The possibil
ity of giving academic credit for
participation in the workshop
was decided against, for fear of
making the experience seem like
work instead of the fun it had
been.
The majority of the partici
pants come from organizations
such as the lIR, Political Union
and ASSU, which are invited to
send representatives. Non-affili
ated persons who are interested
in taking part next winter quar
ter will be interviewed by Brand
in the fall.

fairly thorough knowledge of Hie
broad and detailed aspects of a
conference was the result.
At the last meeting, again at
Dr. Rothwell's home, it was
agreed by the group that the
workshop was extremely worth
while and should be repeated next
year. Stew Brand was elected as
the next chairman. The possibil

participation in the workshop
was decided against, for fear of
making the experience seem like
work instead of the fun it had
been.
The majority of the partici

such as the lIR, Political Union
and ASSU, which are invited to
send representatives. Non-affili
ated persons who are interested
in taking part next winter quar

"This is an age of conferences,"
said C. Easton Rothwell, director
of the Hoover Institute, to the
group of 1G students who gath
ered at his home last January,
and so began the first Conference
Planning Workshop. This work
shop had been conceived by Roth
well and Arden Shenker, presi
dent of the lIR, as a means of in
forming interested students about
the methods of conducting a con
ference. Here was to be an op
portunity to gain the experience
of conference planning from ex
perienced men in the University.
