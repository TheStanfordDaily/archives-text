# CRIMINAL LAW
## Debaters Disagree On Purpose 
### Lynn DeLargey 
A disagreement on the basic
motive of the criminal law sys
tem was at the base of the Tues
day Evening Series debate on
capital punishment.
Melvin Hawley, deputy direc
tor of the Slate Department of
Justice, said, "I think the slate
of California believes that the
system of penitentiaries and jails
is designed for rehabilitation."
Only a "small minority" take the
position thai criminal penalties
are for the purpose of retribu
tion, and capital punishment is
inconsistent with the aims and
assumptions people have about
criminal law.
Opposite Position
Roy Gustafson, who as district
attorney of Ventura County suc
cessfully prosecuted Elizabeth
Duncan for first degree murder,
held to a dictionary definition of
punishment as "retributive suf
fering." "As 1 understand our
law, that's what we have pun
ishment, in the sense of retribu
tion."
According to Gustafson, polls
and the defeat of bills which
would do away with capital pun
ishment in California show that
most people want lo keep the
death penalty.
"Retribution is something we
have to recognize in human na
ture. . . . The whole law system
is based on what the majority of
the people want," he said.
Proper Measure
He concluded that capital pun
ishment, besides being consistent
with public feeling and the basic
theory of criminal law, "is the
proper measure of punishment
for the crimes for which it is
prescribed."
The two men further disagreed
on matters of fact; they cited
some of the same statistics and
reports to show that there is, and
is not, a trend to do away with
the death penalty.
Hawley, a graduate of the
Stanford law school, said that
there is a trend among civilized
nations (e.g., Britain, Sweden
and seven U.S. states) to stop
capital punishment. This fact in
itself, he felt, is the best argu
ment against capital punishment.
"The death penalty is a brutal
izing force in our society. In the
U.S., where only 82 criminals
were executed last, year, "each
state finds a variety of reasons
for not imposing the death pen
alty."
Fair and Efficient
Hawley denied, as Gustafson
affirmed, that capital punish
ment is fair and efficient. The
two agreed that arguments about
economy of killing criminals or
about deterring others from cap
ital ci imes were not supportable
by factual evidence.
Gustafson said, "The time is
not now to switch to rehabilita
tion until prisons do better on
rehabilitation. When we adopt
this system, we should do it for
all crimes, not just capital
crimes."

A disagreement on the basic
motive of the criminal law sys
tem was at the base of the Tues
day Evening Series debate on
capital punishment.
Melvin Hawley, deputy direc
tor of the Slate Department of
Justice, said, "I think the slate
of California believes that the
system of penitentiaries and jails
is designed for rehabilitation."
Only a "small minority" take the
position thai criminal penalties
are for the purpose of retribu
tion, and capital punishment is
inconsistent with the aims and
assumptions people have about
criminal law.
Opposite Position
Roy Gustafson, who as district
attorney of Ventura County suc
cessfully prosecuted Elizabeth
Duncan for first degree murder,
held to a dictionary definition of
punishment as "retributive suf
fering." "As 1 understand our
law, that's what we have pun
ishment, in the sense of retribu
tion."
According to Gustafson, polls
and the defeat of bills which
would do away with capital pun
ishment in California show that
most people want lo keep the
death penalty.
"Retribution is something we
have to recognize in human na
ture. . . . The whole law system
is based on what the majority of
the people want," he said.
Proper Measure
He concluded that capital pun
ishment, besides being consistent
with public feeling and the basic
theory of criminal law, "is the
proper measure of punishment
for the crimes for which it is
prescribed."
The two men further disagreed
on matters of fact; they cited
some of the same statistics and
reports to show that there is, and
is not, a trend to do away with
the death penalty.
Hawley, a graduate of the
Stanford law school, said that
there is a trend among civilized
nations (e.g., Britain, Sweden
and seven U.S. states) to stop
capital punishment. This fact in
itself, he felt, is the best argu
ment against capital punishment.
"The death penalty is a brutal
izing force in our society. In the
U.S., where only 82 criminals
were executed last, year, "each
state finds a variety of reasons
for not imposing the death pen
alty."
Fair and Efficient
Hawley denied, as Gustafson
affirmed, that capital punish
ment is fair and efficient. The
two agreed that arguments about
economy of killing criminals or
about deterring others from cap
ital ci imes were not supportable
by factual evidence.
Gustafson said, "The time is
not now to switch to rehabilita
tion until prisons do better on
rehabilitation. When we adopt
this system, we should do it for
all crimes, not just capital
crimes."
