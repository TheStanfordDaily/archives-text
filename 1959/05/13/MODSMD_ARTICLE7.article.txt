## 'Recognition of East Germany Not Necessary' 
### Jack Clumeck 
"I am convinced that we will reach, in one way or another, at least
a technical understanding that will keep the way to Berlin open,
without entering into an understanding of the recognition of East
Germany."
This was the conclusion reached by Dr. Ernst Fraenkel of the

I Free University of Berlin in a
I talk sponsored by the Berlin Af
| filiation Committee of the IIR
yesterday afternoon.
Presently a visiting professor
:a1 the University of California,
j Dr. Fraenkel centered his discus
sion around "Berlin in the Light
of International and Constitu
tional Law."
Unique Situation
Professor Fraenkel outlined
Berlin's sit u a t ion as being
"unique and unprecedented . . .
a special status." He explained
that "the government of West
Germany still insists on the An
glo-American-French theory Ihat
this is a territory that has not
been incorporated into the Bun
desrepublik |West German gov
ernment! in order to safeguard
against 'monkey business' by the
Russians."
The perpetuation of the cur
rent status of Berlin as a military
occupation lerritory "is indispen
sable in 'order to have routes
from West Germany to Berlin,"
Fraenkel continued.

The undesirability of dealing
with the Fast German govern
ment was explained by Fraenkel
as the "recognition in the Inter
national Community of the exist
ence of two German states. The
division of Germany would thus
j become valid from the point of
I view of international law."
