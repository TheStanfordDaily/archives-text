## 
### 
GENEVA (/P) Secretary of State Christian A. Herter challenegd
the Soviet Union Wednesday to enter serious negotiations for con
crete, self-enforcing agreements for European peace, but drew no
encouragement from Andrei Gromyko.
The Soviet foreign minister rejected in advance the West's pack-

ago plan for solution of the Ber
lin, German unity and European
security issues.
Gromyko called the package
plan, clue to he presented in the
Big Four foreign ministers' con
ference Thursday, an attempt "to
muddle together various political
problems into one tangle." He de
clared such an approach would
completely block the work of the
conference.
Gromyko Balks
Herter got the conference down
to business as chairman of the
third day of a session previously
snar 1 e d by Soviet procedural
moves.
All four ministers finally pre
sented their opening speeches, de
layed by a dispute over Gromyko's
efforts to seat Communist Poland
and Czechoslovakia as full nego
tiators in the confcrenee.
Herter said the American posi
tion on Poland and Czechoslovakia
remains unchanged. France and
Britain held to the same view.
Gromyko has won limited

■speaking rights for'the Commu
nist East Germans at the confer
ence. The same rights also apply
to the West Germans. That was
decided Monday.
Package Plan
Western spokesmen announced
after the 2-hour, 45-minute meet
ing in (lie Palace of Nations that
the Western powers will present
their package plan Thursday.
This plan, ironed out at a West
ern con fere n c e in Paris last
month, links a solution of Ihe
Berlin crisis to German unifica
tion and a European security
agreement. It is understood to
provide for uniting Germany by a
series of steps under Big Four
auspices and with tlie help of an
all-German committee over a pe
riod of two or 111 roe years.
Herter and his Western col
leagues stressed that the West
will not be steamrollered by So
viet diplomatic pressure.

GENEVA (/P) Secretary of State Christian A. Herter challenegd
the Soviet Union Wednesday to enter serious negotiations for con
crete, self-enforcing agreements for European peace, but drew no
encouragement from Andrei Gromyko.
The Soviet foreign minister rejected in advance the West's pack-

ago plan for solution of the Ber
lin, German unity and European
security issues.
Gromyko called the package
plan, clue to he presented in the
Big Four foreign ministers' con
ference Thursday, an attempt "to
muddle together various political
problems into one tangle." He de
clared such an approach would
completely block the work of the
conference.

third day of a session previously
snar 1 e d by Soviet procedural
moves.
All four ministers finally pre
sented their opening speeches, de
layed by a dispute over Gromyko's
efforts to seat Communist Poland
and Czechoslovakia as full nego
tiators in the confcrenee.

tion on Poland and Czechoslovakia
remains unchanged. France and
