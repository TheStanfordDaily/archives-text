# Patterson Outlines Russian Challenge
## 
### Steve Freidberg 
Russia's challenge to Ihe United States' leadership in the world and the consequent competition
in the field of economic aid to underdeveloped countries for their support formed the basis <>112 Dr.
Gardner Patterson's talk last night in Memorial Auditorium.
Keynoting the Second Annual Foreign Policy Institute sponsored by the lilt, he said, "Russia is
competing with us for world leadership, and if we want it, we have to fight for it."

He stressed the deterioration
in the last ten years of the U.S.
position as world leader, attrib
uting this fail u re to certain
changes in the international en
vironment and this country's hes
itance to meet the changes.
Foreign Aid
He related this decline to a
lack of adjustment to a realistic
attitude, particularly in the field
<»1 foreign aid and the Russian
tendency to capitalize on this
weakness.
He stated by figures that the
Soviet commitment in foreign aid
is one-half that of the United
States, and in many countries
they have promised more finan
cial help than has the U.S. They,
however, are probably unsure, as
we are, exactly what this aid will
accomplish although they do have
certain goals in this program.
"While their overall aim is po
litical, the imports received from
these underdeveloped countries
they aid may be economically
helpful," Patterson commented.
Thus, they would be serving two
purposes.
Large Appeal
Turning to the topic of why
.Russian aid has such a large ap
peal, he listed six reasons for its
allure.
The first of these is its novelty,
that is, the fact that il has no
background limiting its potential
ities in the eyes of poorer coun
tries. Secondly, the totalitarian
system in Russia results in such
advantages as a quick response
with aid and technicians and the
flexibility to make long-term
commitments.
A third point he gave was the
attraction of the Russian symbol
free from while supremacy and
capitalistic imperialism and the
impact of Soviet economic
growth. Fourthly, Russia offers
attractive terms of aid. prefer
ring to give credit instead of
grants or gifts as often does the
U.S. Also, Russia charges low
interest rates which rcflect on
the higher chares of the U.S.
Reforms
Patterson offered possibilities
for reform in U.S. policy which
will foster a more realistic and
popular program of foreign aid.
He included the reorganization
of foreign aid machinery tending
toward small range, short - term
projects with a statement of long
term commitments. Also the U.S.

PATTERSON SPEAKS TODAY ON "AID AM) TRADE"
Question-and-unswcr session at tonight's reception
should refrain from asking for
detailed justifications for aid and
lengthy accounts of its use after
money is given; in other words,
more "blank checks." Our pres
ent policy stifles a country's ini
tiative and creates resentment
against the U.S.
Patterson will speak again to
day at 4:30 p.m. in Memorial Au
ditorium on "Aid and Trade:
American Problems and Oppor
tunities" in which he will elabo
rate further on thie challenge
America faces and ways in which
it may be met.
Seminar Groups
After his speech last night,
seminar groups under the lead
ership of Stanford faculty mem
hers discussed tlie topics of Pat
terson's talk. These groups will
meet today at 2:30 to delve fur
ther into the problems he pre
sented.
At 7:30 this evening Patterson
will be honored by a reception at
the Women's Clubhouse where a
question and answer session is
planned. All interested people
have been invited.
