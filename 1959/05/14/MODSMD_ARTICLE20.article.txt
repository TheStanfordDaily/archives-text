Open letter to Alan Kane:
Dear ]\lr. Kane,
After your scintillating letter of
May 13, we all made a dash to the
"Quad" to find your picture. Ob
viously the person who wrote
such an intelligent and charming
letter must be equally charming
and intelligent.
We would like to extend an invi
tation for dinner on Tuesday,
May 19.
We are eagerly looking forward
to meeting you, in person, and
promise faithfully that we each
will wear our grade point aver
ages around our necks.

Editor, The Daily:
Horrors! We behold, in today's
Daily, a letter by Alan "Schopen
hauer" Kane concerning the mer
its of Stanford Women; a letter
definitely at variance with the
chivalric tradition.
Nay more; Mr. Kane informs us
that he "agrees with Lester O'-
Shea that all girls' grade point
averages should be printed in the
bawlout so that we can see which
ones are worth while taking out
[sic],"

This is inexcusable; Mr. Kane
does not agree with me for the
simple reason that I do not agree
with him. Just you wait, Kane;
you won't have a chance in a libel
suit before a woman .judge.
I .ester O'Shea
Help!
Editor, The Daily:
A man who at Oxford will be.
Has been mighty unkind to me;
By causing my grief
He seeks only relief
From his own daling dearth, don't
you see?
Lagunita, Moore, Row Unite!
For that letter I did NOT write.
With patience near spent
1 declare, "Innocent!"
Please! My social life's now in a
plight.
Alan Kane
(Editor's Note: Needless to
say, in the future student body
cards will be required for iden
tification <»ii letters brought to
the Shack and telephone num
bers must be included with let
ters mailed to The Daily. We
had hoped to make it through
a volume without the necessity
of sucli a stipulation.)

Editor, The Daily:
A man who at Oxford will be.
Has been mighty unkind to me;
By causing my grief
He seeks only relief
From his own daling dearth, don't
you see?
Lagunita, Moore, Row Unite!
For that letter I did NOT write.
With patience near spent
1 declare, "Innocent!"
Please! My social life's now in a
plight.

Open letter to Alan Kane:
Dear ]\lr. Kane,
After your scintillating letter of
May 13, we all made a dash to the
"Quad" to find your picture. Ob
viously the person who wrote
such an intelligent and charming
letter must be equally charming
and intelligent.
We would like to extend an invi
tation for dinner on Tuesday,
May 19.
We are eagerly looking forward
to meeting you, in person, and
promise faithfully that we each
will wear our grade point aver
ages around our necks.

Editor, The Daily:
Horrors! We behold, in today's
Daily, a letter by Alan "Schopen
hauer" Kane concerning the mer
its of Stanford Women; a letter
definitely at variance with the
chivalric tradition.
Nay more; Mr. Kane informs us
that he "agrees with Lester O'-
Shea that all girls' grade point
averages should be printed in the
bawlout so that we can see which
ones are worth while taking out
[sic],"

This is inexcusable; Mr. Kane
does not agree with me for the
simple reason that I do not agree
with him. Just you wait, Kane;
you won't have a chance in a libel
suit before a woman .judge.
