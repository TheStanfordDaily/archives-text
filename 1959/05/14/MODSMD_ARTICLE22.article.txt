# Foreign Scholar Drives Face Annual Fund Shortage Crisis
## 
### Dave Quarles 
Forty dollars have been collect
ed by the Berlin Affiliation Com
mittee during the past week's sale
of Brandenburg Gate pins. This
money will help support one of
Stanford's two foreign student
cultural exchanges.
Operating on a $3,000 annual
budget, the Affiliations Commit
tee of the Institute of Internation
al Relations carries on an ex
change of students, information,
books, and periodicals with Keio
University in Tokyo and Free Uni
versity in Berlin.
Year's Scholarship
The $3000 is used to cover ex
penses of a year's scholarship for
one student from each of the two
universities. In exchange Keio ac
cepts one student and Berlin pays
the costs <jf two Stanford stu
dents.
Fulbright travel grants as well
as personal funds cover students'
transportation expenses. The
United States Information Service
contributes an annual $1000 for
cultural exchanges between Stan
ford and Berlin, and may increase
its support to Keio.
I'art Guaranteed
Although Berlin and Keio have
guaranteed their part of the ex
changes, Stanford's participation
is annually threatened by finati
cial difficulties.
About half of the $3000 is raised
by an annual benefit concert. How
ever, this source of income is un
certain, and last year's appear
ance of I mga rd Seefried lost
money.

Wanting to avoid suspension of
the Berlin and Keio contacts,
ASSIJ agreed to underwrite the
deficit of the Seefried concert and
to give aid in the event of future
crises. Nevertheless, the two ex
changes remain in a chronic state
of financial crisis, which not only
hampers present connections be
tween the universities, hut also
discourages further development.
Lost Opportunities
There have been recent oppor
tunities of establishing exchanges
with the University of Warsaw
and the Philippines. Warsaw has
actually agreed to accept four
Stanford students and the United
States Information Service has
expressed interest in the Philip
pine exchange. The Affiliations
committee has thus far been forc
ed to decline these opportunities.
The contribution of foreign stu

donls to Stanford life is fell in
numerous ways, not the least of
which is the active role of the In
ternational Center in campus ac
tivities.
Added Advantages
Berlin and Keio exchanges not
only provide for foreign students
on campus but contain the added
advantages of cultural exchange
and travel and study opportuni
ties for Stanford students.
The money difficulties might he
ascribed to a lack of imagination
in fund raising techniques. How
ever, the problem is more likely
a lack of general student interest
reflected in contributions and ;i
shortage of personnel.
Of the numerous activities and
campaigns on campus, the less vo
ciferous are often forgotten. The
merits of the Berlin Affiliation's
present campaign should not be
judged by the noise it has made.

al Relations carries on an ex
change of students, information,
books, and periodicals with Keio
University in Tokyo and Free Uni
versity in Berlin.
Year's Scholarship
The $3000 is used to cover ex
penses of a year's scholarship for
one student from each of the two
universities. In exchange Keio ac
cepts one student and Berlin pays
the costs <jf two Stanford stu
dents.
Fulbright travel grants as well
as personal funds cover students'
transportation expenses. The
United States Information Service
contributes an annual $1000 for
cultural exchanges between Stan
ford and Berlin, and may increase
its support to Keio.
I'art Guaranteed
Although Berlin and Keio have
guaranteed their part of the ex
changes, Stanford's participation
is annually threatened by finati
cial difficulties.
About half of the $3000 is raised
by an annual benefit concert. How
ever, this source of income is un
certain, and last year's appear
ance of I mga rd Seefried lost
money.

Wanting to avoid suspension of
the Berlin and Keio contacts,
ASSIJ agreed to underwrite the
deficit of the Seefried concert and
to give aid in the event of future
crises. Nevertheless, the two ex
changes remain in a chronic state
of financial crisis, which not only
hampers present connections be
tween the universities, hut also
discourages further development.
Lost Opportunities
There have been recent oppor
tunities of establishing exchanges
with the University of Warsaw
and the Philippines. Warsaw has
actually agreed to accept four
Stanford students and the United
States Information Service has
expressed interest in the Philip
pine exchange. The Affiliations
committee has thus far been forc
ed to decline these opportunities.
The contribution of foreign stu

donls to Stanford life is fell in
numerous ways, not the least of
which is the active role of the In
ternational Center in campus ac
tivities.
Added Advantages
Berlin and Keio exchanges not
only provide for foreign students
on campus but contain the added
advantages of cultural exchange
and travel and study opportuni
ties for Stanford students.
The money difficulties might he
ascribed to a lack of imagination
in fund raising techniques. How
ever, the problem is more likely
a lack of general student interest
reflected in contributions and ;i
shortage of personnel.
Of the numerous activities and
campaigns on campus, the less vo
ciferous are often forgotten. The
merits of the Berlin Affiliation's
present campaign should not be
judged by the noise it has made.
Forty dollars have been collect
ed by the Berlin Affiliation Com
mittee during the past week's sale
of Brandenburg Gate pins. This
money will help support one of
Stanford's two foreign student
cultural exchanges.
