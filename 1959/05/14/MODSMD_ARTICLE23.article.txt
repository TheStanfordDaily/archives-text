## Jump Do Froggies or Race?

This is the question that has de
veloped into a national crisis, ac
cording to students at Ohio's To
ledo University.
It seems thai every year, croak
ers from all over the continent
match their skills in a jumping
contest held in a tiny village called
Angels Camp. Quite a tradition
has developed about the bouncing
event.
Two weeks ago, however, To
ledo students dt*cidt'd to upset tra
dition and hold, not a jumping
contest, liiil a race. Thai's where
llw tun began.
The "Calaveras County Fail*
arid Jumping Frog Jubilee Com-

mittee" pot; wind of (he Toledo
plan and croaked out a protest.
Pi Kappa Alpha members at To
ledo bellowed that theirs was the
only l'rog "race" in the country
and even got Ohio's Governor Mi
chael DiSalle to support them:
"Certainly frogs can race, and it
is ridiculous to say they cannot."
So despite angered outcries
from many parts of the country,
including Angels Camp, the frog
gies "laced" for a trophy. And
the contest will still be held at
Angels Camp the entries may
hop, they may skip, or they may
This is the question that has de
jump. But there will be no racing.
