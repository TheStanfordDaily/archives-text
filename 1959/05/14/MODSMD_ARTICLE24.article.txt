## The 						Shape of the Table 
### 
The question of whether to con
fer at a round table, as the Soviets
wanted, or at a square table, as
we preferred, was not in itself im
portant. But it is very interesting.
For it is an early sample of the
kind of negotiations which are
now beginning, negotiations which
opened at Geneva and will go on
to the summit, perhaps in San
Francisco. It will be a negotiation
not so much about what shall be
done as about how it shall be done.
Thus, in Komi and in Paris,
no less than in London, Wash
ington, and Moscow, it is ac
cepted as a fact that the two
(Herman states cannot be united
during these negotiations. The
real controversies as between
West and lOast will turn on how
to (leal legally with a continuing
partition of Germany.
Equally, it is surely well under
stood in Moscow, as il is in Wash
ington and Ihe West, that West
Berlin will no) be abandoned, and
that the Allied token forces will
remain as a witness to I his deci
sion, and that a blockade of the
access rouls to Berlin would be
an act of war.
The real problem about Ber
lin will be how to deal legally,
politically and psychologically
with the fact that West I'eilin
will remain within the Western
community while it is located
within the Eastern community.
These are not insoluble prob
lems in that at bottom both sides
will accept in substance the status
quo. The problems, though not
insoluble, are, however, complex
and subtle. For ihe juridical form
in which the status quo is accept
ed will have far reaching political
and psychological consequences in
both Germanys, in West Berlin il
self, and indeed in all of Europe.

If, for example, the partition of
Germany were reeogni'/.ed public
ly and definitively, the political
(•onsequences in West Germany
(would almost surely he very seri
ous. It would mark the total de
feat of Adenauer and of his party,
and no one could foresee what
they could mean in the coming
German Elections of 1961.
It, on the other hand, there is
no recognition of the fact tliut
there are two German states,
and if tlx' Soviet Union openly
abandoned East Germany as a
state, treating it as mere occu
pied territory, there would be a
! strong incentive and much prov
ocation for an Kast German re
volt.
When West Germany is rearm
ed, perhaps with nuclear weapons,
i an East German revolt would be
la very great danger to the peace
| of the world.
The problem within the alliance
i does not lie in any fundamental
i and substantial conflict of pur
poses, or even in any important
clifference of estimate as to what
is the reality of the existing situ
ation.
The problem within the alli
| ance is how to enable West Ger
many to accommodate itself po
litically and psychologically to
tin* reality that there will be
two Germanys for the indefinite
; future.
This will be a hard experience
I for the Germans. Historians may
well say that in this experience
the role France has chosen for it
self is not to say yes-yes to Ade
nauer, but to promote in West
Germany the alternative to Ger*
man reunification which is Fran
co-Germany unity in a Western
European community.

The question of whether to con

wanted, or at a square table, as
we preferred, was not in itself im

For it is an early sample of the
kind of negotiations which are

opened at Geneva and will go on

not so much about what shall be

Thus, in Komi and in Paris,
no less than in London, Wash
