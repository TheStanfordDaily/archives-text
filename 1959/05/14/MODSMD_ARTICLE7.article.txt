# Limit Going for State Schools?
## 
### 
A bill to drop the
liquor-free radius around state
colleges and universities was ap
proved yesterday by the State
Senate Governmental Efficiency
Committee.
Senator J. Eugene McAteer of
San Francisco, author of the bill,
said campus growth is threaten
ing investments of nearby liquor
outlets, hotels, restaurants and
amusement places.
Nine Palo Alto liquor estab
lishments have been threatened
by just such growth of the Stan
ford campus. A bill now pending
in the State Senate, already ap
proved by the Assembly, would
provide special relief for the
nine, but would prohibit new li
censes in the area.
