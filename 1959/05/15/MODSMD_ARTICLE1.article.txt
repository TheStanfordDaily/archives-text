## Speaker Wants Trade Reform 
### Doug Willis 
That regular foreign trade is the most iinpoll;«nl single area for
i ciforni of our foreign policy was tho main thesis of Dr. Gardner
rat I Orson's concluding speech before tho 111 l Foreign Policy Insti
tute yesterday at Memorial Auditorium.
Pat torsoii, director of l lie Woodrow Wilson School of Public and

j International Affairs at Prince
ton, explained tha.t the United
States has done the least well in
the trade phase of foreign policy
and I hat wo have the most lever
age and flexibility there.
"Our major economic contact
with foreign nations is our an
nual $20 billion of foreign trade," j
| said Patterson. The United States
lis the world's largest trader, but
foreign trade accounts for only
! about five per cent of our nation-1
I a I income.
Our foreign trade is vital to j
jollier nations, continued Patter
son, but because it is a relatively |
small part of our economic life
we have not paid too much atten-1
tion to it.
Therefore we arc complacent
about our foreign trade relations,
Patterson said, and the kindest
thing that can be said about it
; is that it has stayed on dead cen
' tor, marking time during a pe-
I riod of change.
"The last truly liberal trade
act passed by Congress was in
1015," he explained.
For Liberal Policy
Arguments for a more liberal
trade policy, according to Patter
son, are that it would aid nation
al security by strengthening our'
allies, it would counter the new
Russian "economic warfare" and j
the United States .is becoming [
more dependent upon imports of
scarce materials for national do
-Ifense .
"The United States is entering
: a new phase," said Patterson,
j "and we must create a better im
age of ourselves before the free
j nations of the world so that we j
! may inspire their confidence in
| our leadership."
But this has not caused neces
sary changes in our foreign
trade, said Patterson, because the
persons hurt by liberal foreign
i trade have more exact ideas and
arguments of what they want.;
Reasons for a liberal trade policy
J arc more vague.
blocking Trade
A combination of public indif j
feience and active protectionist
: arguments block liberal foreign
trade measures.
Another explanation for the
jconlinuaiico of strict trade regu-j
Mat ions, said Patterson, is the I
! geographical decentralization of
American industry, so that there
are no purely anti-tariff regions
j of the country left to fight regu
j lalions.
The Administration must bring
foreign trade up to a par with
our military and political foreign
| policies, said Patterson. "Wo
must frankly recognize that
: greater imports will seriously in-
J jure some persons, but instead of
j protecting these interests we
should help them to change."
Patterson also discussed mili-'
tary aid to foreign countries.
Questions Relief
Patterson also questioned the
common belief that economic aid
brings political stability to under
developed nat ions.
"Quite the opposite," he said.
Feonomie aid will usually lead to
inflation, international economic
problems, a rapid population
growth and a breakdown of reli-1
gious and family restraints in the
I society.
Patterson was introduced by j
Dean of Students 11. Donald Win
big lor.

blocking Trade
A combination of public indif j
feience and active protectionist

trade measures.
Another explanation for the

Mat ions, said Patterson, is the I
! geographical decentralization of
American industry, so that there
are no purely anti-tariff regions
j of the country left to fight regu
j lalions.
The Administration must bring
foreign trade up to a par with
our military and political foreign
| policies, said Patterson. "Wo
must frankly recognize that
: greater imports will seriously in-
J jure some persons, but instead of
j protecting these interests we
should help them to change."
Patterson also discussed mili-'
tary aid to foreign countries.
Questions Relief
Patterson also questioned the
common belief that economic aid
brings political stability to under
developed nat ions.
"Quite the opposite," he said.
Feonomie aid will usually lead to
inflation, international economic
problems, a rapid population
growth and a breakdown of reli-1
gious and family restraints in the
I society.

That regular foreign trade is the most iinpoll;«nl single area for
i ciforni of our foreign policy was tho main thesis of Dr. Gardner
rat I Orson's concluding speech before tho 111 l Foreign Policy Insti
tute yesterday at Memorial Auditorium.
Pat torsoii, director of l lie Woodrow Wilson School of Public and

j International Affairs at Prince
ton, explained tha.t the United
States has done the least well in
the trade phase of foreign policy
and I hat wo have the most lever
age and flexibility there.
"Our major economic contact
with foreign nations is our an
nual $20 billion of foreign trade," j
| said Patterson. The United States
lis the world's largest trader, but
foreign trade accounts for only
! about five per cent of our nation-1
I a I income.
Our foreign trade is vital to j
jollier nations, continued Patter
son, but because it is a relatively |
small part of our economic life
we have not paid too much atten-1
tion to it.
Therefore we arc complacent
about our foreign trade relations,
Patterson said, and the kindest
thing that can be said about it
; is that it has stayed on dead cen
' tor, marking time during a pe-
I riod of change.
"The last truly liberal trade
act passed by Congress was in
1015," he explained.
For Liberal Policy
Arguments for a more liberal
trade policy, according to Patter
son, are that it would aid nation
al security by strengthening our'
allies, it would counter the new
Russian "economic warfare" and j
