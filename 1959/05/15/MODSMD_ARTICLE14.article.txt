Baseball;
The Big Tough Trojans of
Soul horn California, only not so
tough any more, arc the objec
tive of a liopeful Stanford base
ball team today and tomorrow in
Los Angeles as the Indians make
their hiil lo walk peacefully into
some sort of playoff spoi.
USC was unbeaten in league
play until last week when both
C a Ii for n i a and Santa Clara
knocked off the Trojans. To'that
point, Coach Rod Dedeaux' de
fending NCAA champions had
rolled to nine straight victories
two of the mildest of which were
7-0 and 7-M decisions over Stan
ford here in April.
Either left-hander Terry Lin
deman or JVlarv Mecklenberg,
wtio suffered the losses in the
April meetings, will slarl today's
Bovard field gel - together for
Stanford. Larl Russell, who beat
the Trojans in pie-league action
and boasts a 1-0 CIBA record, is
set lo do the hurling tomorrow.
I ISC boasts six of Ihe lop l. r >
CIBA hitters, including leader
John Werhas. The six have com
bined Io drive in 08 runs.
Stanford has four representa
tives in the hitting leaders, paced
by Mike Magee's ..'l4O. These four
little Indians, on the other hand,
are credited with 27 runs batted
in Magee has nine, Art von
Wronski eight, Jim Burk seven
an if Joel Newkirk Jhree.

Track:
Hopes for a world record will
ride on the shoulders of four
Stanford half-milers tonight in
the Coliseum Relays at Los An
geles.
Dick Lassen, Bertil Lundh,
Don Chesarek and Ernie Cunliffe
are the four Indians who will
combine in an attempt to wipe
out the standard of 7:20.X set
last year by California.
But before they can worry
about records, the Cards must
beat outstanding teams from
IJSC and Henn Stale, in addition
to Occidental and UCLA.
Stanford whipped IJSC ai YVesi
Coast Relays in 7:25. 1 last week.
Penn State is the unknown quan
tity of the race, though they have
a 4:01 milcr, Ed Moran, on an
chor. UCLA and Oxy are a shade
back of the other three teams.
If Stanford is to get the mark,
it will need a particularly im
proved performance from Lundh,
who is live seconds slower than
last year. Another Indian, John
Kelly, will compete at the Coli
seum in the hop-step-jump and
broad jump, meeting outstand
ing fields in both events.
Saturday at San Jose Stale,
most of the rest of the Card
I'rosh and varsity will compete
unattached in tin all - comers'
meet. Many will be making their
last crack at establishing a mark
good enough to qualify them for
PCC championships or the Cali
fornia Relays.
