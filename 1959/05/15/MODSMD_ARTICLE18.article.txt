## Housing Priorities Hinge On Financial Questions

liy Mary I.oii Mckinley
Although addil ional residences
for un (I c tg 1 ;t cl n a t c men and
women have first priority at pres- j
ent in future University housing
projects, the "when?" and "what j
first?'" cjuestions will continue to
hinge on the even-bigger cpies
tion <>l Innds.
I his was pointed '»nt l>y Ken
uetli M. (iut hbcrison, Assistant!
to the President, and Dean W'il
li;iiii (•. (iraig in recent intei !
views.
In 01 <lei lor a new lesidenee to
he built, hetween 50 and 75 pet
cent ol the money needed must
he assured beforehand from Kills.
This is necessary lor all housing
pioje<ts e\< ept that lot inatiied
students u lik h is expected to pay
lot itself.
Within the next five years un
dergraduate housing facilities are
being planned lot yr,o women
and |oo men—"<onservative esti
mates" according to (iulhbert
son. Graduate housing also is
being planned lot 100 women
;iin! |oti men, and 500 apart-!
incuts may be added to the mar
ried students huilities il demand
re(|tiii es.
Shin ford Village.
This need will iu< rease when
the lease on the Village expires
iu about live years.
These projects along with im
proving existing facilities are
considered "reasonable objec
lives" by the University lot a
live-year pel iod.
I he present pi ioril ies loi
men's housing are for (1) Ira
teruities. and (y) oil-campus men
that would like to move on
(anipus.
liy next I)ecetnbei the lust I ra
tei nity unit should be in* the
building stage and ready lot use
by fall i<|(><>. A committee has
been lormed ol two members ol
the Hoard ol I rustees, two Irom
the alumni organization, two
stall members and Dean (iraig to
determine the values ol present
fraternity property.
Ac (otding to this determined
value, the houses either will be
pulled dov\ 11 01 converted into
offices, laboratories, graduate
housing or put to other alternate
uses.

Although there is no immedi-i
ale need for further men's hous-i
ing, (iraig said, all future under
graduate residences will be built
011 the order of the fraternity
(lusters.
The present balance between
fraternities, c lubs, independents,
and oil-campus men is desirable,
| he said, but added that as living j
units improve, more students!
| will waul to li\e in them.
"Kac il it ies that c omplcuicnt
j academic client will continue to
be emphasized," (iraig said.
I'rosea I Priorities
Present improvement priori

ones) lot mens housing include]

hoi women, the present hous
ing priorities are (1-) getting lid
I ol the present overcrowding ol
j residences (such as Lagunita),
and (a) releasing less attractive
: undergraduate women's housing
to giaclualc siudents.
"An ellort is being made lo
I achieve a more residential rather;
| that institutional feeling," (iuth-l
bet 1 son said. In the I 11 I u 1 e,;
i dorms will be built lor smaller;
groups ol about 50 students rath-!
| er than like the present larger |
facilities such as Moore and
1 Stern.
Smaller (iron ping
This smaller groupijig lac ili

ly members and of financ ing. due j
I to loss ol occupancy, ((looking
and caring for several smaller
dorms is more expensive than lor
I a I a ree dorm with its mass-cHi-1
c 1 eiicy opera! ions.)
Ventura probably will be used
lor a nurses' residence next year,
j and in the (mure, Union may be |
I used as a campus inn 01 lot hous I

ing graduate women.
Residences for graduate stu
dents have almost as high prior
ity as those for undergraduates.
The graduate Business School
wants a residence (lor which il
would raise its own funds, how
ever), and a residence for both
men and women in any graduate
lield may be planned.
"Although modest reseives air
built up from year to year, room
and board may have to be raised
soonei than we had expected il
changes in existing housing con
tinue to become necessary,"
(iuihbertson said. Ihe problem
is not providing housing for ad
ditional students, but one of re
housing and improving present
lac i I it ies.
"Since it is difliculi to get gilt
money for improvement projec is,
it is important to move carelully
and do the things that count the
most," (iulhbet tson said. And
