Assuming that Stanford is a residence campus, what
inigl/1 our residence system need in the way of additions or
changes to make it more < ompletely an asset to the ii'liole
university experiencef And also, to what extent is a resi
dence campus in general desirable/
We would add two other comments on this special edition.
First, we note considerable conccrn here with the relation ol
physical facilities to an effective resilience program.
In complaining—justly, from a present point ol view—ol
those errors ol design ahead) constructed, we might realistically
remember how rarely we get the chance to start alresh in any
thing. Much ol the time we are in the position ol adapting the
now inadequate structures ol other, former drcumstanccs to
present needs. We can.sol course, be wiser (from our point ol
view) in our own designing.
Secondly, we note that the writers of this supplement have
asked more questions than they have answered, have come up
with more things that need revision than with practicable reso
lutions. Nevertheless we leel that there is considerable merit
in just asking some ol the questions.
II these writers conclude that housing al Stanford leaves
i much to be desired at present, we submit that their probing
indicates a genuine anil healthy concern, not merely an attitude
j of negative criticism.
