All-Americans, such as Bill Me-
Coll, ihe nation's finest end in
1!)50 and '51; Sam Morley, great
pass receiver of '53; Paul VViggin,
great tackle of the '55 and '56
teams — and the passers, John

the hopeful new Indians complet
ing live weeks of spring practicc.
Albert to Coach
Another fair qb of a few years
back, Frankie Albert, coaches
the alums, along with veteran
mentor Clark Shauhnessy.
There is no admission charge
to the game for Stanford stu
dents. For adults, it is $1.50 and
for children, 50 cents.
Students will take up their
usual football stronghold on the
"sunny" side of the Stadium,
with alums across the field.
As for the game, alumn start
ing quarterback John Brodic,
now a star for the San Francisco
'liters, has already claimed "We'll
score 1') points."
Plenty of
I'.rodie and follow signal callers
Garrett, Bob Nicole) and Gary
Kcrkorian won't be hurting for
receivers to catch (ho passes, for
the lineup is loaded with ends.
McColl, Chicago Boar slot back,
and '57 All-Coaster Gary Van
Galdor will start at ends with
Sam Morley, a 15 reception man
in 1053, as the slot back.
Tho alums will he two-platoon,
as opposed to the "60 • minute"
pla\ ot the varsity. But, after all,
these guys aren't supposed to be
in shape. In shape or not, the
line of the old timers could swing
the balance.
It is anchored, for instance, by
the Cleveland Browns' Paul Wig
gin, a two time All American at
Stanford. And there are a host
of others—mostly big, and not
too pudgy.
Offensively, the varsity an
swers with a great passer of its
own in Dick Norman, now a jun
ior.
Riek McMillen, the hard-run
ning back who was sidelined by

an injury last season right when
he was hitting his peak, will open
at fullback for the varsity. An- |
other hard charger, Mac YVylie, I
is at one halfback with Dick Bow 1
ers back in his flanker spot.
Converted center Rich Hear- :
ney will open at one end position j
for the varsity, with veteran Irv
Nikolai at the other.
And, from tackle to tackle:
Cap Ingham, Ron Fernandas,
Dou Pursell, Don Peter and Dean
Hinshaw—possibly the key to
this game and the entire next ;
season.
