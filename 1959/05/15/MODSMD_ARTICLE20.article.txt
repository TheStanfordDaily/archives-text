# FACULTY ASSOCIATES
## Students Term Plan 'Worthwhile' 
### Marilyn Moore 
From I lie wide range <>l opin
ion concerning the faculty rrsi
j dent and associalc program, two
generalizations may I »t- made
j vvll ic li include die majoiity ol
views: Family—"Suet essful, I »i1 1
! too new lo be evaluated," and
students — "Worthwhile, but
| needs to be carried lurther."
The need for a closer student
| faculty relationship ai Stanford
has long been seen, particularly!
j upon comparison with the at
mosphere ;ii Fastei n and Cana
dian universities, actordiug to
Dean of Men William (iraig.
I The ideal, he: s;iid, would be a
program such ;is Harvard's,
where a lull professor, associate]
i professors, and tutors live in each
| dormitory.

The first step toward this goal
was taken here with the building
of Wilbui Hall in 11)55 and in
clusion of adjoining housing fa
cilities lor eight (acuity members
and their families.
At Stern Hall the program is
somewhat nearer than Wilbur's
to completion. Last hill two lac
ulty residents moved in, and
plans for homes on corners by
Do nner, Fremont and Lassen
have been completed, although
la< k ol luiids is delaying ton
sil in t ion. Dr. Wilfred Stone, res
ident for Muir and liurbank, has
expanded the program by adding
lat uliy associates to these houses.
There are now lour professors in
each house on this more infor
mal basis. A tentative proposal

for graduate student lesident ad
visers to act as tutois and con
dint seminars, possibly giving
academic credit, is now under
consideration according to Dr.
William McCord, one of the as
sociates.
'I lie idea ol faculty associates
originated about. 10 years ago
but no concrete plans were made.
A year ago the present Student
faculty Commission presented
to the deans a proposal which,
according to Dean <>l "Women
Elva Brown, would "stimulate
greater academic interest" in the
women's residences and "give the
women the opportunity to really
know some members of the fac
nily." As a supplement to al
lowing individual women to in
\ ite lac ull \ members for meals at
till' univei sii\ s e \ pen s e. the
(oinniission asked il certain lae
-1111 \ e onld be plat ed on a more
( out inual and less lot ma I rela
tionship with a women's living
group.
laguuiia was chosen as the ex
pel iuieiiLal reside in e lor the as
so< iate program, since it was lelt
that an all-sophomore dormitory
especially needed additional per
spective. On the basis <>112 reconi
inendations Irotn students and
ad m iuisti a I ion, Ihe deans sent
in\ itaiions to selei ted lae ully
membei s in eai li I niv ersity s
schools ice picst ing their pariici

I 'went y lac 1111 \ meinbei s ac

lour. \i the one meeting ol as
sociaies ihe purpose ol academic
siimulation was emphasi/ed but
no specific plans were made or
pattern lornied. Similarly, no
suggestions for a program were
given the students — they were
given the names oi theii associ

.Perhaps the c hiel dillic ullies
are a slight shyness on the part
ol both fatuity and students —

describes it as "life in a fishbowl

"The fellows are frequently

Do Wilbur residents leel the
purposes ol the program are be

"Yes, that's the one thing the
light residents agree on," Den
sa id.

I he great tin novel ol resi

jinary cause being the si/c ol
hollies provided. I he four-room
residences—liv ing 100111, kitc hen,
bedroom, and stuck—are suitable
for a bachelor or childless coll
ide, but not for families ed more
j than three. I,asi year live resi
dents moved out, this year four

beginning next fall, attending
I to (Iraig, it is hoped that the
lac ullv associate program at W'il

I academic advisor system, bath
advisoi would have about 1 r f ad

1 he Itesluncn men are cngiueci

decrease lime and increase ease
ol counseling in program plan
ning.
The (acuity associate program
I as it exists in women's residences

is an admitted second best lo the
j resident program. 1 he serious
deficiency, according to Dr. Mc-
C lore I, is lack ed a central figure
| around which the program may
be built, i.e., a lac ultv member
in a position comparable to Dr.
Stone at IJtubank and Muir,
preferably leat lung 011 a hall

said Dr. Mi (lord, but would

I ailiei than a housemother.
II I'll Unci 1 nl
In general, the six-inoiilli-old
associate program appeals well
received a 1 Laguuiia and Moore.
Some (acuity inembet s have been
made a "pal I ol the group" bv

functions and group activities,
and in turn have given lorinal

I The ideal, he: s;iid, would be a

The first step toward this goal
was taken here with the building
of Wilbui Hall in 11)55 and in

At Stern Hall the program is
somewhat nearer than Wilbur's
to completion. Last hill two lac

plans for homes on corners by
Do nner, Fremont and Lassen
have been completed, although
la< k ol luiids is delaying ton

expanded the program by adding
lat uliy associates to these houses.
There are now lour professors in

for graduate student lesident ad

academic credit, is now under

The first step toward this goal
was taken here with the building
of Wilbui Hall in 11)55 and in

At Stern Hall the program is
somewhat nearer than Wilbur's

have been completed, although
la< k ol luiids is delaying ton

expanded the program by adding
lat uliy associates to these houses.
There are now lour professors in

for graduate student lesident ad

I The ideal, he: s;iid, would be a

The first step toward this goal
was taken here with the building
of Wilbui Hall in 11)55 and in

At Stern Hall the program is
somewhat nearer than Wilbur's
to completion. Last hill two lac

plans for homes on corners by
Do nner, Fremont and Lassen
have been completed, although
la< k ol luiids is delaying ton

expanded the program by adding
lat uliy associates to these houses.
There are now lour professors in

for graduate student lesident ad

I The ideal, he: s;iid, would be a

The first step toward this goal
was taken here with the building
of Wilbui Hall in 11)55 and in

At Stern Hall the program is
somewhat nearer than Wilbur's
to completion. Last hill two lac

plans for homes on corners by
Do nner, Fremont and Lassen
have been completed, although
la< k ol luiids is delaying ton

expanded the program by adding
lat uliy associates to these houses.
There are now lour professors in
each house on this more infor

for graduate student lesident ad

academic credit, is now under
consideration according to Dr.
William McCord, one of the as

A year ago the present Student
