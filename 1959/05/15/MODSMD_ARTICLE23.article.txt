# Campus Isolation Creates Problems

A residei ire campus with sonic

the advantages of ;i rarefied coui
'inunity of similai interests and

lint mi< h isolations can also
| deaden the A ery vitality which,
used carefully, the) invigorate.
Some ol Stanlord's isolation
can't he helped. Its undergradu
ate prestige reigns unchallenged
by other large coeducational pri
vate universities on the West
Coast. 1 he undergraduates thus
drawn from the whole western
pai i ol t lie (ountry s h ;i r e an
elite's mutual incentive and ex
citement.
Hut the pinnacled position
makes it difficult, to keep per
spective on the rest ol the world,

even the rest of the educational
world.
It is a difficulty compounded
hy the relative sameness ol the
student body, for this is a sec tioti
I ol the (ountry where great phys
ical distances do not imply great;
cult u ra 1 diversities. And, al
though students come here from
all over the country, a large ma
jority of them are from this state.

Stanlord's admission standards
being selective, its prestige high
and its attendance expensive, all
combine to narrow even further
the background and attitudes of
its students.
Some ol Stanford's isolation is
not so inevitable. Any university
can benefit from the stimulus of
other, different undergraduate
communities. II the E a•s t, or
Reed, or Pomona, are too far
away or too unlike in si/e and
outlook, there is certainly Berke
ley, whose social and intellectual
resources most Stanford under
graduates scarcely scratch.
And, although Stanford stu
dents and Palo Alto residents aie
not generally hostile, neither —
separated by their El Camino
moat—are they especially close.
Chances Ignored
Very few ol students' favorite
gathering places are in Palo Alto.
; Most of their shopping they do
at Town & Country Village or
Stanford Shopping Center—both
on the fringes ol Palo Alto—and
' their eating-out at restaurants up
and down El ( '.amino Real. This
I is quite apart, frotn the matter of
j alcoholic dryness.
And San Francisco: intentions
toward the city greatly exceed
what students generally get
around to doing there. Nor are
many of the wonders of San
Francisco's world very widely
known. Someone (maybe Ihe

here a guide to the Kay Area,
from koala bears to 11 isii coffee.
Stanford is luriher set apart
simply by being a resident cam
pus—a phenomenon designed to
enrich substantially the Univer-
J sity experience.
Isolation Justified
I he apartness that comes of
all these Stanford c ire tunstam es
would seem to be justifiable only
so far as, in the balanc ing, their
depth compensates lor some cor
responding loss of breadth.
Considering education broad
ly, how people live is as impor
tant to their university years as
the academic program they lake.
Thus it becomes of < l itical, con
tinuous import that Stanlord's
residences be, in fact, an out
standing asset to the University
I and its students.
But even given optimum resi
dence (onditions, the question ol
to what lengths it is healthy—lor
