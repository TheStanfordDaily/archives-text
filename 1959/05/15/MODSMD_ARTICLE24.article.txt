# Women's Housing Problem: Undesirable Residences Myth
## 
### Rita Neal 
Ihe success—or failure—of (lie
new undergraduate women's
housing plan depends largely on
the women's themselves overcom
ing the myth of "undesirable res
iliences."
Various aspects ut any resi
dence can be "undt-siiable" to
be sure. Location, antiquated
plumbing and heating systems,
cold, sterile architecture, fines for
missing a meal without notifica
tion, conjure up gloomy visions
of Lagunita, Union, Moore and
the Row. But as no residence is
pet feet, neither is any completely
imperfect. To argue that an un
desirable aspect of a residence
puts in into the "undesirable"
category is mythomania—a pro
pensity for exaggerating.

I Mythomania is very muc li with
us in ihe case of women's resi
liences, bin it lias antidotes in
formation and personal prefei
! enc e.
Top Scapegoat
Lagunita lias been pet haps the
(favorite scapegoat of inytiiouia-!
iliacs. Women have positively!
stated that tfiey "would if
they had to live in Lag. Less j
passionate protests against the |
scarcity of telephones, the "mess
hall" dining facilities, and lack
of ail adult key system* among
others, can be assuaged by the
knowledge that a special coin
mitiee ol faculty and Planning
! Office representatives are present
ly investigating the possibilities
I of effecting general improve

men ts ol i li is s<>rt wliic li the
women submitted with their
housing plan in February.
Insofar as time and money will
permit, these improvements will
be made, not only in Lag but in
the otliei women's residences as
well.
I I ie < >i I in part ol l lie a n I idole, j
personal preference, is only hu-j
man. One woman may preferi
newer, modern living arcommo |
dations, lik,e Florence Moore; an-1
( >l he) may pi efei t Ik* c enl ra I lo
c at ion and privacy ol I Inion;
>-iill anoiher may pi el e r the
happy activities of Row houses.
And there are many women who
don't particularly care where
■ • i •
tliey live as long as iliey are with
t heii c losesl 11 iends.
(,ompromise Seen
I here is an element of c om
promise in housing also. Al
though the physical aspects ol
Union may leave much lo be de
sired, conditions for studying
are, for some, sufficient eonipcn
sation. Lag may be isolated from
the fraternities and from Ouacl,
but men do frequent the prem
ises, and there are many girls
near to know well. Lag's court
yard and the lake nearby have
their appeal also.
Physical improvements will be
made; psychological improve
ments are up to each one of us.
Each women's residence has its
good points, and each has a po
tential lot being a "desirable"
house for its women.
Personal Concern
II is, lo a great degree* a mat
ter- ol active personal concern
and involvement: "Desirable
living experiences clo not hap
pen, as a mattei ol course, to the |
passive dweller who considers
them her Stanford right ol en
joyment.
The "desirable" living group'
is more apt to come of people
who enjoy living with each other
than from any circumstances of

a resilience selling', or even ol a
tradition. I Ins is probably 11 ic
ihiil grounds on which the new
| women's housing' plan will stand
or fall.
Natural Profrrenre
I he existence ol a majority
| preference lot our kind ol resi-
I deuce "pelsonalitv" over another
is natural, to the extent that a
I majority student body "personal
i ity'' evidences ilsell. Sin 11 a per-
I sonality probably exists, but iu a
lu//y and malleable state.
As changing admissions poli
cies and student interests < hange
the student body majority, pre
ferred residence notions will fol
low. And the majority personal
ity ol Stanford women, at any
time, is only just so accurate or
significant. Plenty ol other per
sonalities live here.
