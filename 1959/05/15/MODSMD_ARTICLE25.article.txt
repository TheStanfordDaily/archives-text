central academic objectives ••if i ie Univer

President and functions in an advisory re
lation to him: I > 111 that defines only it s
formal status, and sa\s little about the
range ol its interest.
litre** doneertis
In a preliminary way, we noticed that
discussion ol housing lias to attend to
three concer us:
i. Shelter and food.
'j. Cultivation ol good standards ol
/social and individual conduct.
The University's educational ob
jectives, and the degree to which
housing patterns may help or hin
der at this < rut ial level.
Several things were clear:
1. That responsibilities for* these vari
ous purposes was lodged with different ad

ministrative units and were not fully to
on! ina led.
U. I hat the (bird concern—(he academ
ic—whereas ii ought lo be primary, tended
to be lost in the shuffle.
That there was no committee hold
ing responsibility for all these concerns,
and for keeping them in proportion.
The present committee is representative
of the Planning Offite, the Business ()flicc,
the Dean of Students-but it is weighted
with faculty representation, and iliis in
itsell is intended to secure that the schol
arly purpose ol all we tit) at Stanford will
have priority. We try also to keep the
closest possible contact with the present
student generation, and have had valuable
discussions already with A\VS in connec
tion will) Women's I lousing, and with the
President's Student Advisory Committee
on Academic Affairs concerning our witlci
plans.

()lher Discussions
We are at work also on the fnos and
cons ol lour-year integration and "coed"
housing, i.e. the allotment ol separate
wings of certain residences to men and
women students, with common use ol
dining and lounge areas.
We hope to provide opportunities lor
everyone with ideas on the matter to get
