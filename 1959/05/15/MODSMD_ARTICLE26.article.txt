# Freshman Year: Unique Conditions
## Experience Intertwined Closely With Housing 
### Anne Humpherys 
I lit' freshman year at Stanford
is a unique experience. No other
year is like it in either emotional
makeup or Jiving conditions.
T he housing ol lreslnnen and
the l i es hinen experience are
more closely intertwined than at
any other time.
In fact, it is neithei far-feu lied
nor overly dramatic to say that
the freshman year is the ilormi
tory experience.
The first year freshmen see lit
tle that happens to them outside
the perspective ol their living
groups. 1 here is ;■ < <>1 le< live sim
ilarity in academic work that re
sulis in mutual midnight sullcr
ing over English themes. In the
social area, the dormitory, corri
dor anil Moot social luin t ions ar
ranged by the sponsors are usu
ally the lust anil for many, the
only social events during their
lirst months at Stanford. In cx
tracurricular a< t ivit ies, too, many
lreslnnen get their start in the
numerous dormitory committees.
1 he information and oriental ion
are fed out clli< ienlly and i|iiii k
]y ;d corridor meetings through
out the year. I hese meetings are
in many ways the only contact
some Ireshmen have with the ma
chinery, workings, and functions
of the university as a whole.
Freshmen corridors and lloors
are clannish and a man's or
woman's circle ol Iriends is gen

erally determined by where his
room is located.
Because the living group is in
lluential in the first year, it is
important to look closely at the
Ireshmen housing arrangements
as they are now, anil to ask how
Ireshmen housing is adding to
and fulfilling both the goals ol
ihc university and the needs of
the students.
Obviously the present fresh
men housing system is ihe most,
effective way to transfer infor
mation from the administration
lo the freshmen and from Iresh
men to freshmen. Ii is also the
most effective means lor orient
ing the freshmen to the intrica
cies ol Stanford everyday life,
| from paying tuition to locating
| the biology test file. In this ca
pacity the sponsor is an invaiua
] I»le middle man.
Impersonal Hull
In providing extrai urric ular
activities that Inst year, the pres
ent system is also suecesslul. The
many dorm committees and ac
: tivities furnish the means where
by freshmen can exert themselves
against the impersonal wall that
the university tends to be that
fi rst year.
Academics and the freshmen's
social life are centered in the
dormitory, although not so di
rectly influenced by it. Ii is un
j fortunate that it is hard to study

in a lreslnnen dorm because ol
the noise. But to make up lor
that limitation the dormitory oi
lers opportunity for the exchange
ol ideas, problems, and Western

Civili/aiion midterms, with a
minimmn <>l cllort. And how
ever much shouting is done over
the organized social lile ol the
Ireshnicn, ii remains an individ

ual matter that the housing sys
tem augments, but cannot lone.
However, the freshmen hous
ing situation imposes one serious
limitation on the Ireslmian. 1 hat
first year they remain lreslnnen.
and it is not until they are re
moved from the freshmen living
areas that they become Stanford
students.
Deep Experience
S t a n I or cl has unsoundablc
depths of experience. There are
a vast number ol possible ways
of life and thought to be found
on the* ( a ill pus. Kducation means
many things and is worked into
life in many dilfcrcnt ways. Be
coming a studeut-ai-largc rather
than a lreslnnen is to begin to
understand the significance ol
the limitless opportunities at
Stanford, and it is possible only
when a student experiences Stan
ford and is not si in p I y told
about it.
No one sponsor, no matter
how dynamic a person he is, can
"represent" an attitude, a way ol
living, or even an area ol campus
life to a freshman. Whatever
value there is in diversity ol op
portunities and thought at Stan
ford, it must come from experi
encing the whole and watching
the interaction ol its parts. No
one uppcrc lassman can be all
things to all freshmen. No spon
sor system—no matter how care
fully the sponsors are screened—
can hope to do more than anti
septicallv expose the freshmen
to a wide but flat portrayal ol
what it means to be a Stanford
! student.
Because ol this, the present

housing set up places the empha
sis on the "freshman - ness" ol
each incoming class. Postponing
to the second year the awareness
and sensitivity to the university
experience as an integrated
whole has two practical ellccts
that Inst year. In the Insi place,
freshmen problems get all out ol
perspective by intensification
within the living area. The lresh
nian year is a year ol adjustment
to freedom, to activity, and to
the battering ranis ol ideas and
forceful and domineering indi- j
viduals. Most lieslnnen "piob-j
Iciiis" have different faces, but

I lit' freshman year at Stanford
is a unique experience. No other
year is like it in either emotional
makeup or Jiving conditions.
T he housing ol lreslnnen and
the l i es hinen experience are
more closely intertwined than at
any other time.
In fact, it is neithei far-feu lied
nor overly dramatic to say that
the freshman year is the ilormi

The first year freshmen see lit

in many ways the only contact
some Ireshmen have with the ma

of the university as a whole.
Freshmen corridors and lloors
are clannish and a man's or

many dorm committees and ac

Academics and the freshmen's
