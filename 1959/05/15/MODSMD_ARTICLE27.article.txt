# Little Intellectual Incentive Exists Within Barren Confines of Wilbur
## 
### John Thomas Hansen 
Lying ;ii llie nadir of' dormi
tory Jiving ;ii Stanford is the
Freshman men's Ray Lyman
Wilbur Hull, a quadrangle ol
eight identical "houses'' which
bear a striking resemblance to
"Monopoly" hotels.
Most removed ol the men's
dormitories in distance from the
academic centers ol the univer
sity, Wilbur is also the most re
moved in spirit. Little incentive
toward intellectual pursuit exists
within the barren confines ol
\\' i I bin's < einent slab walls, other
than a desk and a bookcase per
ea< h resident. Rather than being
a place where a student can find
his academic needs filled, it is
one from which many students
find themselves lorced to escape
when "the pressure is on."
Why is it that Wilbur is mere
ly the bedroom and (lining room
lor the Freshmen Men? No real
feeling exists at Wilbur that ex
periences there comprisp an in
tegral part of the student's edu

cation. I lie Irosli are physical!)
isolated from the rest ol the peo
ple on campus, the physical sii in -
turc lails to piovide h>i ac adcmic
pursuits, and the. 112 reshman pro
gram itsell is weak in stimulat
ing the men in the intellectual
realm.
Obviously Isolated
I he fact that Wilbur is so ob
viously isolated from the rest ol
! the campus physically, with its
| wide moat of lawns, tends to ag
gravate other aspects ol Irosli iso
lation. Contact with upper-class
men is generally limited to spon
sors. Although the "no-contact'
rule applies only to fraternity
men, it manages to < reate an illu
sion that all uppei classmen aie
! not wanted around Wilbur, and
I that Freshmen are not wanted in
I other residences on campus.
Contact with the faculty is pel
I haps one ol Wilbur's strongest
points; ii was at Wilbur that the
faculty Resident program was
initiated. Knougli good cannot

I be said ol the values of this pro
grain, although it does need some
I refinements. Augmenting the
j present program with a faculty
associate system would provide
! the men with c ont.act in more
fields of the: university and oiler
some rcliel to the already ovci
burdened faculty Residents. Im
proved liv ing facilities might en
courage more scnioi members ol
the lac 1111y to live at Wilbur and
also draw those who would be
willing to make it a permanent
residence. The constant turn
over among the present faculty
residents (There have been 17 in
the Inst lour years ol Wilbur,)
flinders the development ol a
i pei maiient progi am.
