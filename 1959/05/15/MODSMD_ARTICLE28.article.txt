"And now a word from the Pres

'FORE!!'"
FASHIONS: With the rapid
change in clothing styles for
men, the news in shoes has been
somewhat neglected. The new
fashions afoot have given clod
hoppers of yore the boot. While
men's suits are busy adopting
conservative continental styling,
shoes have remained intrinsical
ly American. For the campus

sportsman, the ideal shoe is a
moccasin-type slip-on of shrunk
prain leather with a stitched
seam and trim leather soles.
Newest colors are various shades
of tan and brown. For cavorting
in the woods, the comfortable,
casual chukka-type boot with

flexible leather soles, a squared
off toe and finished in neutral
leather tones, is great. It affords
rugged wear, masculine styling,
while ajso suggesting dressy
sportswear . . . For those black,
tie evening affairs, either the
four-eyelet, black oxford shoe
of textured and smoothed-grain
calf, or a good pair of plain
black cordovans should do th«
trick,
NEW TO THE MARKET:
Men, do you have a beard like
iron ? Do you shave twice a day
and sometimes at knight? Relax.
The first completely adjustable
electric shaver, developed by the
Remington Rand Electric Shav
er Company, has revolutionized
shaving . . . The "Roll-A-Matic"
features a "roller control panel"
which can be adjusted to shave
from the toughest of beards to
the tenderest of skins . . . The
unlimited settings of this re
markable Remington make for a
real close shave without sign of
skin irritation.
WHAT SOPIIO M 0 R E S
SHOULD KNOW: The Teen-
Ager Lipstick Corp. has recent
ly crime out with a new Elvis
Presley Lipstick. Endorsed by
the gyrating idol, thr shade h
hound-dog orange . . . Keep your
knitted ties rolled up in your
drawer — banging will stretch
them . . . Here's some "off the
collar" advice. You can remove
powder and make-up from a
shirt by rubbing the spot lightly
with toilet water ... As for lip
stick, try sponging the spot with
carbon tetrachloride.
I CAN SEE JT NOW: Situ
ated on a lovely corner lot, the
local psychiatrist's house, with
a sign on the lawn reading:
"Please, walk on the grass."

FASHIONS: With the rapid
change in clothing styles for
men, the news in shoes has been
somewhat neglected. The new
fashions afoot have given clod
hoppers of yore the boot. While
men's suits are busy adopting
conservative continental styling,
shoes have remained intrinsical
ly American. For the campus

sportsman, the ideal shoe is a
moccasin-type slip-on of shrunk
prain leather with a stitched
seam and trim leather soles.
Newest colors are various shades
of tan and brown. For cavorting
in the woods, the comfortable,
casual chukka-type boot with

flexible leather soles, a squared
off toe and finished in neutral
leather tones, is great. It affords
rugged wear, masculine styling,
while ajso suggesting dressy
sportswear . . . For those black,

four-eyelet, black oxford shoe
of textured and smoothed-grain
calf, or a good pair of plain
black cordovans should do th«
trick,

real close shave without sign of
skin irritation.

Presley Lipstick. Endorsed by
the gyrating idol, thr shade h
hound-dog orange . . . Keep your
knitted ties rolled up in your
drawer — banging will stretch
them . . . Here's some "off the
collar" advice. You can remove
powder and make-up from a
shirt by rubbing the spot lightly

carbon tetrachloride.
