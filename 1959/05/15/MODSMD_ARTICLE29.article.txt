I liis |>rci 1 \ well e\plains 11ic j
house system's present prcclica
ineni the idea was accepted
alter the physical facility was
constructed.
Stanford's new concept ol stu
dent living is hased (roughly)
on the philosophy that college
education should he a continu
ous process, that residence liv
ing should contribute as much I
to 11 ic individual as classroom j
work.
A linos/tliere
I he house system attempts to j
inculcate this philosophy by giv
ing the individual man a small
living group to associate and
identify with in an atmosphere !
conducive to serious thought
and cultural advancement — all
this, plus pleasurable rclaxa '
t ion.
Now see the problem: you
want to create eight such sepa-1
rate and distinct houses, and
you have r,oo independent men i
and Stern Mali—eight dormito 1
1 ics, and I mean dormitories, all
connected together—with which
to work.
Muir House and Burhank j
House are the first attempts,
and these a t t e m p t s haven't !
proved completely successful.
There is, however, one signifi- [
cant success that the new house |
system has had: it has indicated
to the rest ol the campus that
there is something different go-1
ini: on in Siern Hall. Almost)
tiny change in the character ol
this living area is good. In the J
past Stern Hall in the eyes of j
the campus has had anything I
but desirable connotations. The
ncgativeness of this living area
even poses a threat to freshmen I
going through rush, and for
good reasons; it was and is true
that you can go a quarter, an
entire year for that matter,
without knowing all the people!
on your lloor—or even your next
door neighbor.
Not Easy to Do
Informing the campus of the
changes that are taking place
lias been the easiest part — a
"llridgeathon," a good "Bur

bank'' basketball team and ifs
done. It is easy to outline the
"utopian" ideal ol the system,
it is easy to create the illusion
that you have approximated it,
bui it lias not been so easy to
do it in lac t.
No one is so naive as to think
that the system could be c reated
in a single year—by definition a
house needs a tradition to sup
port it, generations ol men to
prove it, and recognized status
to make il sticcesslul all tilings
that lake lime.
but alter one year these
houses haven't even generated
enough loyally so that their
men are eniluis'iasiic about re
turning to live there; Muir and
Burhank have vacancies just
like the rest of Stern I (all.
An administrator once re
marked that you can have a
house system in a barn. This is
pi obba ly 1 rue a ha in you can
work with, you can change il
and mold it into an indi\ idual
structure, you can give it an
identity, you can make it < 0111-
loi table. ( one rete walls are
hard to move; lounge-append
ages aren't living rooms, wuh
or without rugs; divided eating
areas aren't dining rooms.
How can you develop an in
dividual dignity when men are
regimented into identical cubi
cles and lined up side by side?
How can you foster individual
ism when the individual can't
even decorate his c übicle to suit
his own tastes? In short, how
can you make a house out of a
dormitory?
Men ".s /\ elationsli i i>s
Yet this is what we must do,
until money is available for re
modeling. The writer is of the
opinion that it can be done—
because it is the relationships
between the men that are im
portant here, more so than the
relationship between men and
the structure.
In Burbank and Muir after
the lit si year a house "spirit"
has been engendered, but in
reality this "spirit" is largely
superficial. It arises from the
new concept of the "house," in
stead ol from what the "house"
really is; it arises from the few
structural differences that mark
these two houses apart—the wal
nut-paneled lounges, the libra
lies—instead of from any cultu
ral advantages that other wings
of Stern don't have. In short,
this house spirit lacks a unity to
maintain it and give il sub
stance.

II the house and its men are
going to develop cultural bonds
—and if this relationship is to
be meaningful and valuable
then a c loseness must be devel
oped among the men, which
will add meaning to the sym
phony they attended as a group,
to the speech they heard and
discussed afterward over coffee,
to the discussion with faculty
associates or among themselves.
A man's thoughts gain added
value when they've been ques
tioned or approved by a c lose
group of respected peers, but
lliis kind ol closeness, this unity,
hasn't developed among the
men of Burhank or Muir. We
will try to discover why — be
cause without this, no matter
what the structure, the home
svstem can't be successful.
I his fail i 11 g is probably
caused by two things: the kind
of men that live there and the
way they've been shnfiled to
gether.
Ideal llouso System
first, the ideal house system is
aimed at the student who is
consciously aware ol the value
of education, the student who
finds excitement and pleasure
in knowledge, the student, in
short, who has discovered that
learning is so 111 e t h in g more
than classes and assignments.

M u i r I louse and f> u r h a n k
House are not entirely com
posed of such men—in fact, such
men probably form a very small
proportion of the total. It is
unrealistic to think that all <>1
the men living there nwiit or are
capable of being attached to a
house by "cultural bonds."
Second, those men of this na
ture who live there now have
no reason to stay and others
won't he attracted for the sim
ple reason that it is this kind of
man who will make the most of
his educational years whether in
a "house," in a fraternity or oil
campus.
L ivirig Kxperien ee
Third, while this student
would desire a living experi
ence that the ideal house sys
tem should offer, to take time
from his educational pursuits
to help develop this system
means a sacrifice. This, as prece
dents of sponsoring, for exam
ple, have indicated, doesn't
mean he wouldn't.
Fourth, as men are distrib
uted now in these two houses,
there is no natural grouping ac
complished; hence you have a
very wide range of interests, so
diverse that no real unity has
been possible. Diversity to an

leals the basic purpose.
Ihe solution to t hese prob
lems is no ciii< It.
Ii must be realized that the
needs ol independent under
graduate men diller—the ideal
house system isn't suited to all.
I betc lore each house should
he oriented to meet the needs
of a dilJcrent segment ol sui
dents. Ihe basic purpose ol
combining living and learning
must he there, but the intensity
should diller.
Need Recognized
While the need for houses
variously oriented is generally
recognized, a schematic method
must be devised to bring stu
dents ol like interests together.
If we sit around and wail foi
ea( h house to develop a "char
acter" we'll be waiting a long
while and generations ol stu
dents will have passed through
untouched and uninspired.
The purpose of the system is
defeated il people are slutflled
about and chopped indiscrimi
nately into this house or that.
While the basic premise that
the student should select the
house, instead of the house se
lect the student, is line— present
ly there is no discernible reason
why a student should select one
house over another.
\locing Encouraged
Moving from one house to
another should be encouraged;
the moving ol larger groups ol
students is particularly desir
able.
In short, it will lake an active
group ol men to take over a
house and mold its character. If
this is hindered and discouraged
by the administration, and il
