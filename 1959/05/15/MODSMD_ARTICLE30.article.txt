Hut oil-campus living is allow
ed here, and it appeals to many
men. Obviously there is some
thing to it.
Many advantages ol oH-< ainpus

ol these are not considered <|uiic

i ol us will wish, at one time or

we too were "11 ce."
Many Reasons
The reasons that many stu
dents are oil campus go deepei
than this, however. There arc
those who want loot Is they like
at times they can speedy. Or
there arc those who want kittens.
()r those who want quiet.
There are students who want
a large room to themselves, or
their own swimming pool, or
their own phone. There are, it
seems likely, ant i social—or, lei's
say, individualistic—students who
just want to get away from
others. And then there are the
advantages everyone can name,
hut which are less ohvious and
even more peisonal.

Realizing, then, that each oll
campus student is there lor rea
sons which are varied and com
plex, it could well he asked—and
indeed may soon he asked —
"Shouldn't oil-campus students
he required to live on campus?"
Stanford is a resident university,
after all.
(iiven the situation now—that
there isn't room for all under
graduate students to live on cam
pus, and /or that the present
house system leaves much to he
desired—it is easy to rest on the
status quo and answer, "No."
Hut suppose it wc J re felt that
the house system was more effec
tive, and that there was room on
campus for all students. Sl\ould
on - campus living he required
then?
Answer Trivial
In a sense, it is silly to consider
such a question. The answer
seems trivial and fixed in ad
vance. To the extent that we all
realize the values of a "good"
house system, we should encour
age (i.e., require?) all students

to participate in sue h a program.
And besides, there seems lo he
room lor doubt about the influ
encc ol student thought on Uni
versity policy. University policy,
too, would probably assert that
the 1 values ol the house system
require its support by all under
graduates.
I'reset! t Ire fern! tie
This is not as good a policy as
the present one which encour
ages, but does not require, par
ticipation in campus living.
1 here is no incontrovertible evi
dence to support this statement;
it is only the opinion ol one oil
campus student. Uut it is not
without reason.
There are values to be found
in oil campus living which the
house system cannot, by its very
nature, duplicate. These have
already been suggested; there
very likelv are more. Alter one's
fnsl year, it seems quite possible
that these values and the bene
fits deriving 11 < tin the social situ
