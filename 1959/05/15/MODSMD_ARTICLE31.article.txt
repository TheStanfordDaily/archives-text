# HOUSE 1000 MEN
## Fraternities Weak, hut Will Continue to Exist 
### Jack Winkter 
Fraternities will continue to
exist ai Stanford, 110 mailer how
strong the rumors become that
the Administration wants to
get rid ol the in, no matter how j
many more wings are built tin
I .tit ie Slet li s I fall. I lie\ will
t onl inue lo exist, il lor no til lici
reason, because iliev provide
housing lor almost 1000 men—
1000 men for whom Sianlord
does not have dormitories and
lot whom Palt) Alto does not
have enough apartments. Il cost
S| million lo build Wilbur
llall, holding Koo freshmen—it
would probably cost Sli million
to close down the fraternities
anil put up allot liei lan ie Stern
Hall.
II rait System
Hut ft>l all this prospective
longevity, il is as obvious as a
beer can 011 Inner Ouad that
the fraternity svsteni at Stanford
is a weak fraternity system.
Weak, ai least as far as the fra
ternities are concerned. Weak,
first ol all, because the Univer
sity owns the land on which all
the houses are built.
Weak, secondly, because only
one out ol every three under
graduate men is allilialed wilh
a fraternity. I here are many al
ternatives to fraternity living
eating < 1111> allilialion, dormi
tory living 011 campus, olf-cam
pus apartment living, each with
iis respective degree ol social
prestige. However great the
positive value ol belonging it) a
house, there is certainly no so
cial stigma to not belonging It)
a fraternity a majoi ity ol men
do not.
Different (.titetia
Nonetheless, many people
complain that Iraiernities are
st) in e li o w "iintleinoc rat it " in
their sclei 1 ivily, that rushing
puts an mil.lll pressure on Iresli
men and hi nt e 1 lie whole sy s
tent should be abolished. I
disagree, t i/ih i niltes me no

ext'i 1 selectivity just as Sianlord
does in 1 hoosiug its freshman
< lass ilieie are simply different
t ritet ia lor inembei ship. I lie
University 1 booses on an inicl
let dial basis, Iraterniiies on a
social one. C.racles for one and
amiability loi the other. And in
au age of public relations and
increasing growth of service or
ganizations, when the demand
is "lo get along," perhaps the
sot ial judgments are just as im
porlatit as the intellectual ones.
In fait, the ratio ol applicants
to those actepted is much better
for fraternities than it ever has
been or ever will be for Stan
foul as a University.
What a house offcis its mem

Ixt once inside is something no
oilier living group here cm. lit
is in ;i large group, closely
linked at eating its meals, a!
work, ai play. ['1 1less he chooses
to divorce himself entirely, he is
in a group in which all have
c(|iial rights as members, wilh
ii<» loving hi mi !\ io proleci him,
and I l oin whit h he cannot re
i real. I hough there uiav be no
lorrnal pressure for .participa
iion. just by the fact thai the
Iralcrnily s activities ami facili
ties are open io all members
equally, people will be continu
ally drawing him into the group
—asking il he is going to the
next part\, wants lo double,
wants to play ping-pong, wants
it) sii in on the poker game, 01
am ol a variety ol oilier soti.il
activities, lie cannot withdraw
is he can in a dormiiorv. I ti
lths he fights it obslinalely, the
iraternity member will join a
certain camaraderie, a certain
pride in his house il only be
cause iis reputation reflects on
him, pleasure ami enthusiasm
tempered by the recognition
that others have just as ninth
say as he does and thai lit: mtisi
get along with them.
After Joining
All ibis comes aftn one is in
a fraternity: il is the spirit ol
a Iralcrnily, lo be appreciated
only by one who joins in it. lie
lore though, and ihese are the
iliings In which the houses are
judged, there are many othei
reasons for joining a fraternity.
Perhaps the mosi important is
ihe assumption of elite status,
real or imagined. Membership
in a fraternity classifies one as

one of the voting aristocracy- in I
some minds.
The challenge to "make a Ira- |
ternily" as a sign ol social accep
labililv is a < hallenge whit h
ma ny t a nnol resist, whether
iliey think fraternities are a
good thing or not.
Stteial fragrant
Perhaps the strongest induce
ment for joining a Iralcrnily —
and one whit h reflects badly on j
the student govcrnnieni—is 1 he* I
desire for an activated social |
program. With the "no-alcoiiol j
1 uk" in force, Stanford never i
has been anil never will be a
"pari v st hool." I his may be 1
well and good lor an academic !
institution, but when combined '
wilh the minimum ol all-cam- j
! )iis social planning b\ the AS
U -|- t lass organizations, it
means an utter dearth ol organ
ized social activity for freshman
men and leads many to the so
cialh orienletl Iraiernii ies. II
student body officials are liretl
ol banging around in 1 heir tea
pot abo 11 t * communication"
and "responsibility" they mighi
attack a problem thev can really
(to something about—selling up 1
an all-campus program for the
benefit of those who do not have
a group to th) it for them. For
a monthly social due ol about
Sj the Iratcrniiy member gels
from one to two to as many as
live parlies a month, plus infor
mal gatherings, serenades and
exchanges. This is a bargain in!
any language, particularly after
a year at Wilbur.
