Lit/nor Silmilitm
It is perhaps unnccessatv to mention the soc ia I titinai uraluess
created by Stanford's liijuoi situation.
As in all dormitories, the tensions and rapid pace ol college lile
are transferred into 11 it* living area, Creating an atmosphere that is
not conducive to relaxed 01 informal discussion ol things more
significant than the dail\ (online. I'oyon has no ana iu wliiili

is u.sed almost exclusively loi studs.
I(.(. has plans to alleviate this piohlem, bv making the main
lounge into a social area and establishing study rooms and small
binaries at citlici end ol the Mali. Such changes would make an
iniportant academic as well ;is social dillerence to (llubnien.
Excellence of Suites

I lowever, I ovmi sullers Iroin certain weaknesses inherent in
all Stanford dorinitories. ()ll campus residences generally make a
greatei contribution to (ilubincn, and iluis to the (.lub svstcin.
Ii is indeed loi innate that ( tubmen haw alwavs had two living
choices: loyoi i or oil campus.
I 'mil living an as on the Stanford campus can be made more
attractive to students, ii would be a grave crroi for the Univcrsit\
to insist on an all resident campus. (ilubmeii are generally as nine h
opposed to be "dorinitori/ed" as they are to being "c lustered."
