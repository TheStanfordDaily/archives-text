Srnlt' of I lux
I I ins. we in i g h ( state the j
hroad residence objec tive simply I
as having a large proportion ol
otu students living on campus in
a mannei which will enrii h their
university experience. Within
this general policy, we have an
"official word" w h i < h is very
mill h in a state ol lhi\. As in
other elements ol the university,
there is some healthy ferment in
the thinking on residence pro
grams. I'.oth faculty and students
are more seriously concerned
with student residences than thev
apparently have been for many
years. What has been considered
a ver\ satisfacton program in the
past is currently getting a criti
(al look.
Historically, at Stanford as
well as at most universities (at
least for the past few decades),
the primary function of student
residences has been provision ol
lood and lodging lor students at
economical rales and under cul
turally acceptable conditions.
I his latter phrase has tended to
imply a concern mainly for so

j rial development and education
in good . citizenship. Measured
against stub usual goals (which
manv of us now consider too lim
ited), Sianlord's residence pro
grain must be iated high in com
i parison with lop-llight universe
tics a (Toss the countrv and per
jltaps the best among universities'
west ol the Mississippi. With
tin>st ol our siudeiiis living on
} (am pus. we have considered our
selves a residence univeisitv.

IS vie Standard
But now we are addressing out
selves to a new standard ol e\
celletue in student residences,
and t lie historit a I sepa rat ion ol
j residence life Irotn acatlemic lile
can't meet the test. We must ((in
sider a new definition lor a resi
dence I 'niversity one which in
sists that "t ill t in aIIv acceptable
conditions" i in p I v a scholai ly
! community, where acatlemit en
! deavor and 'concern are as actepi
able in the resitlence and stu
[ dent union as thev are in the li
I biary or < lassiooms. We now see
I the following ideas finding ex
! pression in a Dean ol Students'
j memorandum concerning Stan
(lord's residence obje( lives: "An
| intellectnal and Irieudly atinos
pliere coiulut ive lo high s( holas-
I lie interest achievement";
j "st imulat ion ol intei est in < n I -
tural activities stall as theater,
art and literature"; "opportunity
for membeis ol die faculty to
have (loser, informal association
with students.'
I he kev lac toi in < a using a re
evaluation ol residence stand
aids is fa( ii ll v interest. I'at 11 v due
to a review ol our entire under
graduate program and the estab
lishment ol the (.cneraJ Studies
Committee and part 1 v due to out
experiments with' faculty resi
deuces at Wilbur and Stern, lac
uliv interest in the residence pro
gram has shar pcncd.
Faculty Intvrvst
I he Dean ol Students and his
stall, who have a big voice in ics
itlence plans, in recent years have
| been 'reflecting this facultv in
terest. But in theearlv planning
stages on our next undergradu
ate residences, including the fra
ternity units, direct fatuity par
ticipation has been encouraged
through the Dean ol the School
ol Humanities and Sciences and
II he (iliairnian of the (.enera I
Studies Committee.
The recent re-evaluation, al

though still in progress, already
has solidified three reh/tivelv new
(to Stanford) ideas in our pro
gramming loi new undergradu
ate residences. The current "offi
cial word," in iiiv opinion, recog
nizes the desirability of: (i) rela
tively senior faculty residents on
a i alio ol about i per imm> stu
d en t s, (2) residence libraries
vvliii Ii reallv coinribute to ilie
academic and culiural tlevclop
iiient ol the student, and (j{) two
man two-room suites or some
scull ai i angemeni ol s t u tl en t
tooins to encourage serious and
indiv iclual ac ademic pursuit in
the residen< es. We have incorpo
rated these features in prelimi
nary plans for new undergradu
ate men's resiliences, the lirst of
which probably will be construct
ed to house I'oiti fraternities with
in the next year or so. 1 hey
would he included in a similar
program for undergraduate
woinen. Also, we are studying
the feasibility ol incorporating
anv ol these features in certain ol
our existing residenees.
I'esiik'iil l*rograin
I lie lac iiltv resident program
at Muirand Butbank Houses of
Stern llall represents the latest
thinking on this feature. In com
bination with a "faculty associ
ate" program calling for regular
and Irecjiient visits by non-resi
dent faculty, this latest experi
ment has provided a healthy in
volvement ol faculty and stu
dents in this particular residence
community. The goal is not
alone to give scholarly tone to
the student residence but to en
courage a natural link between
stude nts and lat ulty in all phases
ol university life. Since a faculty
resident can only succeed il In
puts both time and effective en
thusiasm into the program, we
have to recognize two major
problems in the further develop
ment of this idea.
112 irst, time means costs; the res
idence program must be able to
pay for its share of faculty serv
ices. A professor's services in the
residence must be at least as val
uable as his services in the class
room or sillily, and the addition
al cost to the University must be
measured against the many ever
present alternative opportunities
to expend funds in the clfort to
achieve and maintain an excel
lent ac ademic program. For ex
ample. the extension til this fac
ultv resident program through
out Stern Hall would cost about
.">40,000 per year. If met from
rates charged to Stern students,
it would mean an increase of S<>s
per year. If met by a gift to
endow the program, il would be
a 51,000,000 gift!
Tico-ll ay Procvss
Second, effective enthusiasm
means people who can and will
generate it; from the faculty must
come professors who can work
successfully with students in a
residence situation—and who are
willing to make such work a part
ol their professional careers.
I liese two problems are not in
surmountable bv any means, but
they mean that we are unlikely
to spread the faculty "residence
program throughout all student
t evidences overnight.
I he extension of residence li
brarics will depend on current
experience also at Muirand Bur
bank I louses in Stern Hall. Cost

is again ;i lactor, and relative
cosis and advantages of varia
lions in library programs arc
un d c r ( onsidcra I i< >n. I < >r in

I )onltle I loon is
I he two man 1 wo room suite
idea to be incorporated in new
undergraduate housing is a ma
jor departure from past residence
design standards. I he emphasis
in new const 1 in tion, ovei the last
several years, on the standard
two-student room was no acci
dent. Alter a review ol student
housing throughout ihecouiilrv,
University olliccrs considered it
the best solution to a< hieving ac
ceptable privacv and study ton
dit ions at a reasonable cost,
\V It e u Slanloi d was painfully
short ol student residences (in
the past 10 vcars we have con
structed space lor almost a, 100
students — more than doubling
lormei capacity), the two-student
room combined with residence
lounges and dining rooms looked
like a inightv good standard.
But a new and critical look,
based in part on our own expeli
cncc and a re evaluation ol ob
jectives, has suggested the need
lor improving the design ol stir
dent rooms at least for anv new
const 1 u( lion. I lie dcsirahilitN ol
a place where the student can be
"by hi nisei I with a book and yet
where he < an eiitei tain a lew
Iriends lor discussion or recrea
tion has led to the two-man two
room suite conception. Other
variations, such as several indi
vidual rooms oil a small lounge,
are possible and ma\ Ixe consid
ered as new plans are developed.
Any conversion ol exisiing dou
ble room residences to a suite
arrangement requires thorough
study and would involve serious
cost implications.
Flexibility
In addition to new concepts in
student residences several old
ones continue to be a part of the
"official word." But little is cer
tain except that changes will be
sought—and certainly should be
considered. The notion that our
students should have some va
riety in types of residence avail
able to them has persisted. To
be sure, our receptivity to < hange
has provided us with a varietv,
in part onlv reflecting changing
ideas over the vears. And some

now (jiicstii hi 1 lie desirability of
variety in undergraduate resi
denc is. 1 >u( I would assess llic
( ui reul "line as ;k i ept ing it.

In eating tinf), fraternity, inde
pendent on-campus and inde
pendent olf-campus life seems to
provide a healthy atmosphere in
a # university community. Among
women's residences, an unfortu
nate series of < hanges in t ules for
drawing over the past few vears
lias prevented mtuh ol an obser
\ation—except that a eomlotta
ble old house lodged between a
t on pie of fraternities can be
made to seem attractive to most
undergraduate women! One can
sense, however, a healthy respect
among many women for the va
riety ol residences as represented
by Moore Hall, the Row, I'nion
and a Lagunita reduced to a
lower oc< upancy.
Another persisting concept is
that dining should be a part ol
each undergraduate residence
program. Many colleges and uni
versities have moved toward mass
dining facilities separated from
student rooms and lounges and
unrelated to particular groups ol
students. Although this has econ
omy to support, it and although
it may theoretically allow a wide
scope ol acquaintance with other
students, we have felt that there
were greater advantages to in

eluding dining as a part of tlie I
residence .group living. I bis was;
a key point in the planning for
Florence Moore llall and tliej
proposed new undergraduate I
housing. A refinement of this
idea has led to proposals thaf
dining rooms at Lagunita, Ruble.
Hranner and Wilbur be furthei 1
separated according tocasa, wing
or house.
Small (/roups
A more recently developed,
but a continuing, conviction in
our residence policy is that most
(but not necessarily all) ol oui
undergraduates will bene lit from
a living situation which allows
identification wit It a group of up
to r,o students. Such a group is
small enough to encourage ac
ceptaiK e of responsibility and yet
large enough to provide a range

<>l interest, personality and age
within the student population.
We expect that add it ional under
graduate residences for both men
and women will incorporate a
strong recognition ol this "up to
50" grouping.
