# Libraries Bring Learning to Houses
## 
### Etna Rodenhouse 
"Devotion to the undergradu
ate, book-centered lilc should be
pre-eminent in the Jile ol a col
lege student," said timer M.
Crieiler, associate director ol li
braries, ol the functions ol a resi
elcnce library. "We'd like to
make the intellectual interests
the central interests on this cam
pus. This is education as we con
ceive it."
I he program ol residence li-

braries is helping to further this
concept of bringing education
into the dormitory and doing
away with the division between
the living area and the studying
area.
At present, a library is a place
where one goes to study or to get
books. It has become, in recent
years, more and more ol a study
hall, rather than a place where
one reads and docs research. The
dormitory room, by contrast, has
become the place to talk to

li ieiuls, change clothes and sleep.
The program ol residence li
braries is designed to restore the
idea ol pursuing intellectual in
terests in, or close to, the living
area. The two new libraries in
iYluir and Burbank houses are,
symbolically, "gentlemen's libra
ries," in that they bring into easy
access a number ol books which
are considered additions to intel
lectual enjoyment.
A "gentlemen's library," or in
this case, the residence library,
oilers a number of general books
for perusal and, perhaps, some
after dinner reading.
When the atmosphere in
Stern's other six houses led the
Administration to initiate the
concept of a 'house system' in
plans for Muir and Burbank,
their plans included a room oil
the new lounges for such a li
brary.
Hooks on Reserve
A committee from Stern met
willi faculty and Administration
committees, and it was eventual
ly dccidcd thai the books needed
most were titles on highly re
st ricJed reserve at the Main Li
brary.

! So< ia I S( ieiu es librarian
Thompson M. Little submitted
to the student <0111111 it tec a long
list ol books in great demand in
Undergraduate study, reference
books, and books ol general in
| Iciest. 11 is list was enthusiasti-'
I cally received by Muir ami llur-1
bank.

I .Synod from the dormitory reserve j
j lor each house s initial collec
tion; additional books are now
j purchased with a <|uaricrl\ allo
cation ol Si 00 voted by Muir and
| Burbank residents. With these
funds (io to 75 titles will be add
ed annually lo the original 400
volumes.
Quarterly additions are prima
rily general reading titles. They!
are selected partially from a list
compiled by Wilfred Stone, fac
ulty resident, at the beginning ol
this year, and partly from stu
dent suggestions—such as Paster
i nak's "Dr. Zhivago."
Students Hun Libraries
Running of the house libraries
is left to students, under Little's
guidance; the Main Library of
fers only its ordering and cata
loguing services.
Students decided upon a closed
library to keep books from dis
appearing, and two salaried grad
uate students, paid from the Stu
dent Aid Fund, to serve as libra
rians when the libraries are open.
Hooks may be checked out for a
1 specified period at any time ilur-l

ing the 40 hours a week the li
braries are open. Members ol
each house's library committee
assume the responsibility when a
library is kept open beyond these
hours.
The Muir and Burbank libra
ries are in small, walnut paneled
rooms oil their lounges, w i th
rugs, and large study tables with
blue upholstered armchairs in
the center. There are also a lew
easy chairs and davenports, and
adjustable lights, which ollereel
a marked contrast to the sterile
atmosphere of the Reserve Book
Room.
Elaborate Facilities
Other residence libraries don'l
have M uir's and Bui bank's elab
orate facilities..
Typical ol fraternity house li
braries are the Sigma Chi's and
Delta Upsilon's: the Sigma Chi's
have a large colleciion ol books
on open shelves in llieir den, and
1 lie: DU's have l licit col lee I ion ol
books and periodicals on several
open shelves in llieii cliaplei
room and a loom adjoining il.
In none ol these rooms is there
any spec ial siudy space.
A colleciion ol donated books
and loans I mm the Main Library
on open shelves on a large stair
well landing, plus a lew t ha ii s
and tables, compiises Biannei's
bin a ry.
Out-oj-l se Te \ Is
Roblc' s is in a separate room
with davenports and t oniloi table
chairs, and a study table and
benches, but i 1 s book selection is
limited lo a few Western (a'v
books and generally oul-ol use
texts.
Lagunita has about i ;oo books
distributed t luoughoul a lew

small libraries adjoining casa so
cial rooms. These are provided
with a study table and (hairs, but
in most cases the furniture takes
most of the space in the room.
Last year Lagunita students
became interested in accumulat
ing a belter selection of books.
An encyclopedia was purchased
from the house fund, and a com
mittee compiled a list ol general
books from the adv ice ol various
departments. The dormitory
spent S-'oo for books from this
list, and some til the professors
visited were so impressed with
the girls' enthusiasm that they
j donated books themselves.
Interest in the new libraries,;
especially in Muir and Burbank,
is very high. Student interest in
new libraries remains high wher
ever they have been made rc
j sponsible lor them.
Remodeling ol existing libra
lies is so expensive I hat llie Ad - j
ministration feels it is imprae li
| cal unless si uelenls ol a pari it 11-
i la 1 living area sin>w a definite
i inteiesl.
Expansion of System
Ac c en ding lo (irieclci and Lit!
lie, expansion <>I the system ol
resit lent e lib) ai ies will depend
011 llie a va liable lac il i I ies, I lie j
money available, and student in I
leiesl. "We elon'l belicve that
! every dormitory should have a
j Ii h 1 a 1 y (like Muir s 01 I',lll
j bank s) because ol the < osl and
duplication involved,'' Little ex
plained recently.
Individual libraries are pro-j
posed for eat h 11 a lei 11 ity; I hey
would double as a place ol study
! and a "sort o| formal living
100111." ac c 01 ding to Dean ol
Men William (>. Craig, lie also

lias indicated that larger libra
ries lor a on| > ol fraternity
units are under investigation.
Stone has pointed out the du-1
plication and expense ol build
ing many libraries in Stern, and I
has suggested that one akerna-j
live might be to double up on
the lounges ol corner wings, mak
ing one lounge a library and the
other an area lor social lunc-i
lions. While the idea ol a house
system is to break up the masses j
so that people can find their
identity, unfortunately il a unit i
becomes 100 small it becomes in
ellic ienl.
