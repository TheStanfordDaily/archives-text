I 'resident Fisenlnnver asked Congress to appropriate >100 mil

eeleralor, lasl night at a banquet of 111«> nation s top scientists.
i his atomic research unit would he "hy far the largest <>( itk kind
ever huill," Fisenlmwer said.
At a special press conference in San Francisco vesterdav, Dr. Fd-

ward Gin/ton, a Stanford profes
sor of applied physics, comment
ed that everybody assumes the
chances for Congressional pas
sage of the appropriation are
"very good."
Once constructed the accelera
tor would require TOO people to
operate it and maintain it. A
yearly government grant to Stan
ford of $1.3 million almost three
fourths of Stanford's total annual
budget of $22 million would be
required to finance Ihe research.
Sterling's < eminent
President Wallace Sterling told
the Daily lasl night. "This is the
result of a lot of interest by our
physics department. We are very
gratified that the distinction of
the faculty merits such consider
ation by our federal govern
ment."
A to m i c Energy Commission
Chairman John A. McCone said
yesterday,"The proposed 13 bil
lion electron volt, accelerator,
which eventually is planned to
operate at 4 ."5 billion electron
volts (BEVi, will be a major ad
vance in the machines available
to science for investigating the
mysteries of matter and energy."
The atom-smashing accelerator
will allow scientists to probe into
the minute structure of the
atomic nucleus.
McCone said. "Each previous
advance in the energy of particle
accelerators has led to important
I discoveries. There is no question
that the proposed Stanford ma
chine will make major contribu
tions to our understanding of the
physical universe."
Separate Unit
Dr. Wolfgang Paimfsky, pro
fessor of physics at Stanford, ex
plainer! that Project "M" would
not be incorporated into the Phys
ics Department, but would be run
as a separate unit. He said the
project, would certainly "add to
the prestige of physics research
at Stanford."
Nor would use of the accelera
tor be confined to Stanford pro
fessors, Gin/ton said. The new
tool would attract scientists from
all over I he world.
An Atomic Energy Commis
sion release stated, "The Stan
ford project would tie established
as a national facility for re.
search, to be used by scientists
from other institutions as well as
those at Stanford. A procedure
would be established for screen
ing proposed experiments and
scheduling the use of the ma
• •bine."
The accelerator, often referred

to as "The Monster," can be used
by 1M senior scientists—two or
three who would be permanent
to Stanford's staff and 40 junior
scientists, Ginzton explained. The
junior scientists would include
mostly g r a d u a t e students in
physics the bulk of whom
would be from Stanford.
Second Proposal
A project similar to Stanford's
Project "M" had been proposed
by Hie Midwestern Universities
Res c a rc li Association, which
would have operated as a circu
lar machine, as opposed to the
linear accelerator. At the San
Francisco press conference, Pa
nofsky explained Stanford's proj
ect was accepted by the Atomic
Energy Commission because it
was a "conservative" machine.
It is an extension of estab
lished principles which Stanford
has used in constructing much
smaller linear accelerators the
Mark IV is 220 feet in length.
He explained that the Midwest
ern ideas were so new that such
an expensive undertaking wasn't
considered feasible.
In response to a question Pa
nofsky said, "There has been no
opposition or criticism of any
kind" with regard to Project "M,"
because it is a conservative ma
chine."
Physical Plant
The accelerator will be en
closed in two parallel tunnels
each nearly two miles long be.
neath the foothills behind cam
pus. The tunnels will be covered
by 3f> feel or more of earth,
which, Gin/ton told reporters, is
sufficient protection against ra
diation. The accelerator tunnel
would be about 15 feet and diam
eter, and the second tunnel, for
klystron tubes, would be 2.") feet,
in diameter. The shops, laborato
ries and office buildings will cov
er 400,0'K) square feet.
Once the appropriation is made
by Congress, contracts must be
negotiated with Stanford for the
project.
G i n/.t on suggested that it
would be possible to start the
project this year. Once started,
the accelerator will take six
years to construct.

tool would attract scientists from
all over I he world.
An Atomic Energy Commis
sion release stated, "The Stan
ford project would tie established
as a national facility for re.
search, to be used by scientists
from other institutions as well as
those at Stanford. A procedure
would be established for screen
ing proposed experiments and
scheduling the use of the ma
• •bine."
The accelerator, often referred

to as "The Monster," can be used
by 1M senior scientists—two or
three who would be permanent
to Stanford's staff and 40 junior
scientists, Ginzton explained. The
junior scientists would include
mostly g r a d u a t e students in
physics the bulk of whom
would be from Stanford.
Second Proposal
A project similar to Stanford's
Project "M" had been proposed
by Hie Midwestern Universities
Res c a rc li Association, which
would have operated as a circu
lar machine, as opposed to the
linear accelerator. At the San
Francisco press conference, Pa
nofsky explained Stanford's proj
ect was accepted by the Atomic
Energy Commission because it
was a "conservative" machine.
It is an extension of estab
lished principles which Stanford
has used in constructing much
smaller linear accelerators the
Mark IV is 220 feet in length.
He explained that the Midwest
ern ideas were so new that such
an expensive undertaking wasn't
considered feasible.
In response to a question Pa
nofsky said, "There has been no
opposition or criticism of any
kind" with regard to Project "M,"
because it is a conservative ma
chine."
Physical Plant
The accelerator will be en
closed in two parallel tunnels
each nearly two miles long be.
neath the foothills behind cam
pus. The tunnels will be covered
by 3f> feel or more of earth,
which, Gin/ton told reporters, is
sufficient protection against ra
diation. The accelerator tunnel
would be about 15 feet and diam
eter, and the second tunnel, for
klystron tubes, would be 2.") feet,
in diameter. The shops, laborato
ries and office buildings will cov
er 400,0'K) square feet.
Once the appropriation is made
by Congress, contracts must be
negotiated with Stanford for the
project.
G i n/.t on suggested that it
would be possible to start the
project this year. Once started,
the accelerator will take six
years to construct.

Once constructed the accelera

ford of $1.3 million almost three
fourths of Stanford's total annual
budget of $22 million would be
required to finance Ihe research.
Sterling's < eminent
President Wallace Sterling told
the Daily lasl night. "This is the
result of a lot of interest by our
physics department. We are very
gratified that the distinction of
the faculty merits such consider
ation by our federal govern
ment."
A to m i c Energy Commission
Chairman John A. McCone said
yesterday,"The proposed 13 bil
lion electron volt, accelerator,
which eventually is planned to
operate at 4 ."5 billion electron
volts (BEVi, will be a major ad
vance in the machines available
to science for investigating the
mysteries of matter and energy."
The atom-smashing accelerator
will allow scientists to probe into
the minute structure of the
atomic nucleus.
McCone said. "Each previous
advance in the energy of particle
accelerators has led to important
I discoveries. There is no question
that the proposed Stanford ma
chine will make major contribu
tions to our understanding of the
physical universe."
Separate Unit
Dr. Wolfgang Paimfsky, pro
fessor of physics at Stanford, ex
plainer! that Project "M" would
not be incorporated into the Phys
ics Department, but would be run
as a separate unit. He said the
project, would certainly "add to
the prestige of physics research
at Stanford."
Nor would use of the accelera
tor be confined to Stanford pro
fessors, Gin/ton said. The new
tool would attract scientists from
all over I he world.
An Atomic Energy Commis
sion release stated, "The Stan
ford project would tie established
as a national facility for re.
search, to be used by scientists
from other institutions as well as
those at Stanford. A procedure
would be established for screen
ing proposed experiments and
scheduling the use of the ma
• •bine."
The accelerator, often referred

to as "The Monster," can be used
by 1M senior scientists—two or
three who would be permanent
to Stanford's staff and 40 junior
scientists, Ginzton explained. The
junior scientists would include
mostly g r a d u a t e students in
physics the bulk of whom
would be from Stanford.
Second Proposal
A project similar to Stanford's
Project "M" had been proposed
by Hie Midwestern Universities
Res c a rc li Association, which
would have operated as a circu
lar machine, as opposed to the
linear accelerator. At the San
Francisco press conference, Pa
nofsky explained Stanford's proj
ect was accepted by the Atomic
Energy Commission because it
was a "conservative" machine.
It is an extension of estab
lished principles which Stanford
has used in constructing much
smaller linear accelerators the
Mark IV is 220 feet in length.
He explained that the Midwest
ern ideas were so new that such
an expensive undertaking wasn't
considered feasible.
In response to a question Pa
nofsky said, "There has been no
opposition or criticism of any
kind" with regard to Project "M,"
because it is a conservative ma
chine."
Physical Plant
The accelerator will be en
closed in two parallel tunnels
each nearly two miles long be.
neath the foothills behind cam
pus. The tunnels will be covered
by 3f> feel or more of earth,
which, Gin/ton told reporters, is
sufficient protection against ra
diation. The accelerator tunnel
would be about 15 feet and diam
eter, and the second tunnel, for
klystron tubes, would be 2.") feet,
in diameter. The shops, laborato
ries and office buildings will cov
er 400,0'K) square feet.
Once the appropriation is made
by Congress, contracts must be
negotiated with Stanford for the
project.
