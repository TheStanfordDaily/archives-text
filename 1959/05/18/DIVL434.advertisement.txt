soft! What taste from
yonder [ FILTER BLEND|... .
ITS WHATS UP FRONT THAT COUNTS
This filter, be it e'er so pure and white
Must needs give flavor too, full clear and bright
Else would the trusting smoker, filled with hope
Again be dashed, dejccted be . . . and mope.
And thus we come to Winston's obvious truth
It's what's up front that counts —and 'tis, forcoo'.h
In that the fine tobaccos, in the end
Are by exclusive process—- Filter-Blend —
Become the tastiest taste that e'er hath played
Across your dancing taste-buds, man or maid!
Ho ye not slow, therefore, to test the wit
Of what wc say: that Winston, friend, is it;
For that with ev'ry smoke ye do delay
Ye arc not gath'ring rosebuds while yc may!
" Wc arc advertised by our loving friends..."
