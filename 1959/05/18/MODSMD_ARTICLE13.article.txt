# ‘Need of Excellence,’ Says Sterling
## 
### Camille Peterson, Staff Editor 
"The country is in critical need of ex
cellence," asserted President Wallace
Sterling, aiul it is therefore the fluty of
higher educational institutions such as
Stanford to stimulate society to pursue
and demand excellence. •
Sterling spoke on the goals of Stanford
in the modern age at the luncheon ses
sion of the 271h annual alumni campus
conference Saturday.
Sterling said that much of what is
called higher education in this country is
;i "travesty" on the term. Many of the
largest institutions have admission poli
cies which arc unseleclivc and standards
which are low.
Because of this, a degree's worth can
only be judged upon the basis of the uni
versity which gives it . . . and this can be
| done only by looking at the university's
curriculum.
It will be this way until society de
mands a change, and it won't do so until
it is pointed out to them. Pursuit of ex
cellence for the individual and nation as
a whole may be the most valuable contri
bution Stanford can make to the country,
J Sterling said.

In giving I lie goals of Stanford he listed
excellence concerning faculty, students
and administration which when necessa
rily viewed as a whole meant excellence
in education, "the price resource of any
count ry."
Speaking of the faculty goals. Sterling
staled thai "the strength of a university
is based on the strength of its faculty" in
both teaching and research. "Trying to
secure tins high quality of teachers is
highly competitive."
He cited the need for the faculty lo bo
interested in the curriculum, which ne
cessitates Ihe adjustment of the lime
schedule and the revising of much-worn
professorial lecture notes.
As illustrations of the Stanford fac
ulty's interest in these matters, Sterling
mentioned the general studies committee
established several years ago following a
review of the curriculum. Under this
group Stanford • in - Germany was estab
lished. Hr> also mentioned studies carried
on in the business, law, educational and
medical schools.
Sterling expressed concern over the
possibility of the University becoming un-

balanced because of (he increasing impor
tance of science and technology.
. In quoting Dean Philip Rhinelander,
Sterling said, "1 ho total knowledge is in
creasing at such a great rate that no mat
ior how industrious or conscientious the
student is, his relative ignorance is al
ways increasing."
The second goal of the TTni versify is a
quality student body. Despite the rapidly
rising number of college-aged students,
the total enrollment at Stanford will not
be increased within the next four or five
years, Sterling said.
In securing a highly selective student
body of strongly motivated and talented
youth, we must keep in mind that we are
not trying to make Ph.D.'s out of all of
them . . . hut to prepare them to fulfill
their duties of citizenship in the manner
in which Lloyd Dinkclspicl did.
In speaking of the administration. Ster
ling said thai the University must be
staffed with "those who <'an see bifocally,
no mat lei* how dimly" t heir responsibili
ties a $35 million fiscal operation, serv
ice to a community of about 10,000 aca
demic enterprises.
