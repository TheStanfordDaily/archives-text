# Separate German Settlement Hinted
## 
### 
GENEVA (A') -Western diplomats said last night they may have to negotiate a separate stop-gap
settlement with the Soviet Union after full debate of rival East-West German peace plans.
Word of the new Western position came after an American delegation spokesman called lor thor
oughgoing discussion in the Big Four foreign ministers' meeting of the West's package plan. This
envisages a phased program toward settlement of the future of Berlin and Germany and the buildup

of a European security system.
U.S. Secretary of Stale Andrew
H. Berding told newsmen: "We
are going into the next few days
of the conference with tlie hope
and expectation of getting into
detailed discussion of the West
ern proposal.
"We also take it for granted
that the Russians want us to do
the same thing with their draft
peace treaty."
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko offered Friday a five
month-old Soviet draft peace pact
as the basis of his country's pol
icy for a German settlement. So
viet Premier Nikita Khrushchev
has snubbed the package ap
proach, but said some parts—not
specified — of the package are
worth talking about.
Interim Status
As things stand now the West
has allowed for an interim status
to be negotiated for Berlin—but
only as part of a general package
settlement of the overall German
and European security problems.
But American and British dip
lomats reported privately Sun
day that the Western foreign
ministers see no chance at all of
any early definite settlement of
the German problem on the basis
either of the Western or Soviet
proposals.
It is assumed by Western au
thorities their proposal for unit
ing Germany through free elec
tions stands little hope of Soviet
acceptance. Equally, the Soviet
plan for a demilitarized, free eity
in West Berlin is foredoomed to
rejection.
Stopgap Negotiations
Nevertheless, the West would
be ready to negotiate some sort
of arrangement that would get.
both East and West out of a
powderkpg situation that could
lead to shooting. Such a stopgap
could become the first definite
step toward insuring a summit
meeting, where a longer-term so
lution could be examined.
Some sticky procedural points,
bearing important political over
tones, remained likbly to snarl
the work of the Big Four minis
ters here. Gromyko intends press
ing anew for Polish and Czech
participation in these and in any
subsequent negotiations on Ger
many's future and the shape of a
! European security system.
