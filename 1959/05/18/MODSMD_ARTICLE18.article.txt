Calendar More Crowded

As we near the end of spring
quarter the calendar of events be
comes more and more crowded.
Here are a few more items for
your consideration. The first item
is summer quarter ASSU govern
ment.
During the summer period there
are about 2200 students enrolled
at Stanford, a good percentage of
which are graduates. Primarily
summer q u arte r government
gives one a chance to gain admin
istrative and eoordinative experi
ence. It is also an excellent oppor
tunity to exercise one's faculties
in some creative social planning,
for the composition of the sum
mer student body is extremely
heterogeneous.
Openings
There are openings for summer
quarter ASSU President, Vice
President, Business Manager, two
women's representatives and two
men's representatives. Interviews
will be hold on Tuesday, 1-3 p.m.
in my office.
In addition, Rich Sundeen will

Athletic Board representatives,
Student - F a c u 11 y Employment
Committee representatives, Hos

other ASSU offices for the com
ing year. Announcements as to
time and place will appear in The
Daily.

miscellaneous. The 1959-f>9 Legis
lature of the ASSU has only two
more meetings, so any of you who
might be interested in submitting
constitutions to be ratified or by
law changes must get them in by

Here are a few more items for
your consideration. The first item
is summer quarter ASSU govern

During the summer period there
are about 2200 students enrolled
at Stanford, a good percentage of
which are graduates. Primarily
summer q u arte r government

heterogeneous.
