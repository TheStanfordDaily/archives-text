Upwards of 2000 Stanford stu
' dents missed this year's signal
opportunity to achieve ;t clearer
! understanding of I lie world scene
|and the role of the United Stall's
i in it. Dr. Gardner Patterson, guest
lecturer for the Second Annual
Foreign Policy Institute, twice de
livered thoughtful and perceptive
I addresses. Members of the Stan
j ford faculty twice led discussion
groups on issues raised by the
keynote lecture.
Quality of Participants
Participation was at a high
level, reflecting both the quality
of the participants and the calibre
of their attainments.
The University Administration,
in cooperation with many inter
ested students had bent every ef
fort to make the opportunities to

| the student body most ea si I y
j available and of greatest reward
Unfortunately, the student body
responded as Dr. Patterson had
j pessimistically expected. It seems
I odd and a hit disheartening thai
even with Con Home Week, de
bates and the symphony, not even
125 percent of the Stanford coin
munity had the interest to bend
J their efforts for 20 hours from
] 7:30 p.m. May 13 to 11:30 p.m. May
I 1 toward an intensive concen
j (ration on the affairs of I he world
Some lew did avail themselves
lof this opportunity. Some few
I grapplped with and came to some
understanding of the questions:
"What can we reasonably expect
our foreign policy to accomplish?
What tools does Ibis policy have?
What tools should it have? What
| is the nature, breadth, and depth
I of the international challenge of
J today? What should be our re
' sponse?
Questions I nunswered
Most students have not yet an
swered these questions for them
selves, and those who will not
: take the time present to seek an
i understanding of the dangers that
lurk before and around eventual
accomplishments will eertainlv
not have the wisdom to know
where they succeed or fail.
One cannot be too displeased at
the absence of Stanford students
at this year's Foreign Policy In
stitute. At the absence of those
citizens of the world community
who happen to be at Stanford, the
many students who pride them
selves on honest intellectualism
and intelligent curiosity, however,
one can be quite embarrassed and
not a little discouraged.
