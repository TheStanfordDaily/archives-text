Questionnaire 1 1 nf.iir
Kditor, The Daily:
. . . The questionnaire (distrib
uted during the non â€¢ military
means for peace discussion Tues
day in Union Court | definitely
emphasized one point of view:
militarism is wrong. The word
ing of each question was de
signed to arouse an emotional re
sponse rather than a true opinion.
The overbalance of these ques
tions to peaceful means questions
was poor and the entire question
naire seemed to me just the kind
of thing we want to get away
from: an emotional opinion with
out facts.
What wo need most, in my
mind, is a positive look at other
international policy possibilities,
always remembering that these
may have to be used in addition
to and not instead of military pro
tection. Most of all, we should put
the emphasis on learning as many
facts as possible before we make
any judgments of general policies.
