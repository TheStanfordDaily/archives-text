(Editor's Nole: This letter is a reprint of one printed April 15
in the Brown Daily Herald, and is a letter to a student at Brown
University. We print it because it raises some interesting ques
tions.)
My dear Son:
I am appalled, even horrified, that you have adopted Classics as
a major. As a matter of fact, I almost puked on the way home today.
I suppose that I am old-fashioned enough to believe that the purpose
of an education is to enable one to develop a community ot interest
with his fellow men, to learn to know them, and to learn how to get
along with them, in order to do this, of course, ho must learn what
motivates them, and how to impel them to be pleased with his objec
tives and desires.
I am a practical man, and for the life of me I cannot possibly
understand why you should wish to speak Greek. With whom will
you communicate in Greek? I have read, in recent years, the delibera
tions of Plato and Aristotle, and was interested to learn that, the old
bastards had minds which worked very similarly to the way our minds
work today. I was amazed that they had so much time for delibera
tion and thinking, and was interested in the kind of civilization that
would permit such useless deliberation. Then 1 got to thinking that it
wasn't so amazing after all, they thought like we did, because my
Hereford cows today are very similar to those ten or twenty genera
tions ago.
I am amazed that you would adopt Plato and Aristotle as a vocation
for several months when it might make pleasant and enjoyable read
ing to you in your leisure time as relaxation at a later date. For the
life of me, 1 cannot understand why you should be vitally interested in
informing yourself about the influence of the Classics on English liter
ature. It is not necessary for you to know how to make a gun in
order to know how to use it. II would seem to me that it would be
enough to learn English literature without going into what influence
this or that ancient mythology might have upon it.
As for Greek literature, the history of Roman and Greek churches,
and the art of those eras, il would seem to me Hint you would be much
bettter off by learning something about contemporary literature and
writings, and things that might have some meaning to you with the
people with whom you are to associate.
These subjects might give you a community of interest with an
isolated few impractical dreamers, and a select group of college
professors. God forbid!
It would -seem to me that what you wish to do is to establish a
community of interest with as many people as you possibly can: with
people who are moving, who are doing things, and who have an inter
esting, not a decadent outlook.
I suppose everybody has to be a snob of.some sort, and I suppose
you will feel that you are distinguishing yourself from the herd by
becoming a Classical snob. I can see you drifting into a bar, belting
down a few, turning around to the guy on the stool next to you—a
contemporary billboard baron from Podunk, lowa, and saying, "Well,
what do you think about old Leonidas?" Your friend, the bill board
baron, will turn to you and say, "Leonidas who?" You will turn to
him and say, "Why Leonidas, the prominent Greek of the twelfth
century." He will, in turn, say to you, "Well, who in (he hell was he?"
You will say, "Oh, you don't know about Leonidas?" and dismiss
him, and not discuss anything else with him the rest of the evening.
He will feel that you are a stupid snob and a flob; and you will feel
that he is a clodhopper from Podunk, lowa. I suppose this will make
you both happy, and as a result of it, you will wind up buying his
billboard plant.
There is no question but this type of useless information will dis
tinguish you, set you apart from the doers of the world. If 1 leave
you enough money, you can retire to an ivory tower, and contemplate
for the rest of your days the influence that the hieroglyphics of pre
historic man had upon the writings of William Faulkner. Inciden
tally, he was a contemporary of mine in Mississippi. We speak the
same language—whores, sluts, strong words and strong deeds.
It isn't really important what I think. It's important what you
wish to do with your life. I just wish I could feel that, the influence
of those oddball professors and the ivory lowers were developing you
into the kind of a man we can both l>o proud of. I am quite sure that
we both will be pleased and delighted when I introduce you to some
friend of mine and say, "This is my son. He speaks Greek."
I had dinner during the Christmas holidays with an efficiency ex
pert, an economic adviser to the nation of India, on the Board of
Directors of Regents at Harvard University, who owns some eighty
thousand acres of valuable timber lands down here, among his other
assets. He introduced me to his son, and then apologetically said,
"He is a theoretical mathematician. I don't even know what he
is talking about. He lives in a different world." After a little while
I got to talking to his son. and the only thing he would talk to me
about was his work. I didn't know what he was talking about either,
so I left early.
If you are going to stay on at Brown, and be a professor of Clas
sics, the courses you have adopted will suit you for a lifetime associa
tion with Gale Noyes. Perhaps he will even teach you to make jelly.
In my opinion, it won't do much to help you learn to get along with
people in this world. I think you are rapidly becoming a jackass, and
the sooner you get out of that filthy atmosphere, the better it will
suit me.
Oh, I know that everybody says that a college education is a must.
Well, I console myself by saying that everybody said the world was
square, except Columbus. You go ahead and go with the world, and
I'll go it alone . . .
I hope I am right. You ate in the hands of the Philistines, and
dammit, I sent you there. I am sorry.
Devotedly,
Dad
