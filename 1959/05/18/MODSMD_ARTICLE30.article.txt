Need Sororities
Editor, Tilt' Daily:
During the course of the year,'
The Daily has concerned itself i
with many vital issues of campus j
life. The sweeping survey of the
residence* policies represents the
culmination of The Daily's dis
cerning in q u i r y into student |
problems.
Yet we are aghast that one
rather obvious solution has seem ;
ingly been ignored. The search j
for integration and continuity j
can logically he satisfied by only
one residence system SORORI-1
TIES! This has been too long j
neglected. Most of our mothers ;
were sorority girls, most of our
fathers married sorority women j
— is it fair for Stanford to deny
us our legacy?
Think of the benefits which,
not only the women, but Stan
ford as a whole, would derive
from the adoption of this propos- j
No longer would fraternities
be "weak, but allowed to contin- j
ue"—they would be ennobled by i
thee x is t en c e of their sister
Greek-letter organizations.
The "ugly girl" problem would '

be obliterated: sororities would
provide a functional means for
the selection and concentration
of the most desirable campus
women.
After freshman year? . . . SO
RORITIES.
