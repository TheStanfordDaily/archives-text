# Cards Lose Two Crucials To Trojans in Southland
## 
### 
Stanford's baseballors lost Iwo
(TiH-ials this week end in the
Southland, as USC smaslu'd the
Cards 10-3 on Friday and lln*n
came hack and blasted tin* Indians !
14-1, Saturday.
In the Friday g a in e, Trojan
Bruce Gardner held the Indians !
tu seven hits while his team was
pounding throe Stanford pitchers
lor 10 runs and twelve hits. II
was the tilth consecutive Victory
for Gardner.
Marv Mocklenherg started for
I he Cards and was charged with
the loss, lie was relieved in the
eighth liy Warren Nelson who
pitched -.•! of an inning and had '
to he relieved by Terry Linderrian.
The Trojans scored six runs in
the eighth to ice the game for
(Jardner.
Jim Burk was the big man at
the plate for the Cards as he
slammed out three hits in five
trips to the plate. Two id' Burk's
three hits were for extra liases,
one being a home run.
Saturday was practically the
same story, only worse. The Tro
jans pounded six Stanford pitch
ers for 12 hits and 1-1 runs, in the

Saturday affair. The six Card
hurlers also gave up 11#walks in
the game that 'sewed up the CIBA
championship for USC.
The only Card score was a solo
homer by Burk, his second in two
days. The winning pitcher was
Bill Thorn, who pitched six in
nings of no-hit, no-run ball. The
losing pitcher was Karl Russell,
his first of the CIBA campaign.
With things looking as they do
right now, it is possible that the
game hero next Saturday with
Cal could decide who will repre
ent I lie Southern Division in the
I'CC play-offs. The Bears are now
just one game behind the Indians,
as I hey split with lowly UCLA
last week end.
Coach Dutch Fehring said that
Stanford is a long way from be
ing a shoo-in for the NCAA play
offs if they finish a strong sec
ond behind the USC Trojans.
Just because USC is ineligible as
far as the NCAA is concerned,
this rloes not mean that fhey can
not compete with the Northern
Division PCC winner for the PCC
championship and the right to
represent the PCC in the division
playoffs.

playoffs.
An NCAA commit 100 will
choose lho representative to rep
resent the West in the regional

Stanford's baseballors lost Iwo
(TiH-ials this week end in the
Southland, as USC smaslu'd the
Cards 10-3 on Friday and lln*n
came hack and blasted tin* Indians !
14-1, Saturday.
In the Friday g a in e, Trojan
Bruce Gardner held the Indians !
tu seven hits while his team was
pounding throe Stanford pitchers
lor 10 runs and twelve hits. II
was the tilth consecutive Victory
for Gardner.
Marv Mocklenherg started for
I he Cards and was charged with
the loss, lie was relieved in the
eighth liy Warren Nelson who
pitched -.•! of an inning and had '
to he relieved by Terry Linderrian.
The Trojans scored six runs in
the eighth to ice the game for
(Jardner.
Jim Burk was the big man at
the plate for the Cards as he
slammed out three hits in five
trips to the plate. Two id' Burk's
three hits were for extra liases,
one being a home run.
Saturday was practically the
same story, only worse. The Tro
jans pounded six Stanford pitch
ers for 12 hits and 1-1 runs, in the

Saturday affair. The six Card
hurlers also gave up 11#walks in
the game that 'sewed up the CIBA
championship for USC.
The only Card score was a solo
homer by Burk, his second in two
days. The winning pitcher was
Bill Thorn, who pitched six in
nings of no-hit, no-run ball. The
losing pitcher was Karl Russell,
his first of the CIBA campaign.
With things looking as they do
right now, it is possible that the
game hero next Saturday with
Cal could decide who will repre
ent I lie Southern Division in the
I'CC play-offs. The Bears are now
just one game behind the Indians,
as I hey split with lowly UCLA
last week end.
Coach Dutch Fehring said that
Stanford is a long way from be
ing a shoo-in for the NCAA play
offs if they finish a strong sec
ond behind the USC Trojans.
Just because USC is ineligible as
far as the NCAA is concerned,
this rloes not mean that fhey can
not compete with the Northern
Division PCC winner for the PCC
championship and the right to
represent the PCC in the division
playoffs.

Stanford's baseballors lost Iwo
(TiH-ials this week end in the
Southland, as USC smaslu'd the
Cards 10-3 on Friday and lln*n
came hack and blasted tin* Indians !
14-1, Saturday.
In the Friday g a in e, Trojan
Bruce Gardner held the Indians !
tu seven hits while his team was
pounding throe Stanford pitchers
lor 10 runs and twelve hits. II
was the tilth consecutive Victory
for Gardner.
Marv Mocklenherg started for
I he Cards and was charged with
the loss, lie was relieved in the
eighth liy Warren Nelson who
pitched -.•! of an inning and had '
to he relieved by Terry Linderrian.
The Trojans scored six runs in
the eighth to ice the game for
(Jardner.
Jim Burk was the big man at
the plate for the Cards as he
slammed out three hits in five
trips to the plate. Two id' Burk's
three hits were for extra liases,
one being a home run.
Saturday was practically the
same story, only worse. The Tro
jans pounded six Stanford pitch
ers for 12 hits and 1-1 runs, in the

Saturday affair. The six Card
hurlers also gave up 11#walks in
the game that 'sewed up the CIBA
championship for USC.
The only Card score was a solo
homer by Burk, his second in two
days. The winning pitcher was
Bill Thorn, who pitched six in
nings of no-hit, no-run ball. The
losing pitcher was Karl Russell,
his first of the CIBA campaign.
With things looking as they do
right now, it is possible that the
game hero next Saturday with
Cal could decide who will repre
ent I lie Southern Division in the
I'CC play-offs. The Bears are now
just one game behind the Indians,
as I hey split with lowly UCLA
last week end.
Coach Dutch Fehring said that
Stanford is a long way from be
ing a shoo-in for the NCAA play
offs if they finish a strong sec
ond behind the USC Trojans.
Just because USC is ineligible as
far as the NCAA is concerned,
this rloes not mean that fhey can
not compete with the Northern
Division PCC winner for the PCC
championship and the right to
represent the PCC in the division
playoffs.
