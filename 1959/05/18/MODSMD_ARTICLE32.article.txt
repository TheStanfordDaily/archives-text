Team Captain Lawrence has
I been the spark plug of this year's
I team with teammate Farrazzano
providing much of the humor
j which helped to make this team a
I success. These two players have
led the batting and have provided
a formidable double play combi
nation on Ihe infield. Lawrence
and Ferrazzano both have balled
61 times and both have .3(50 aver
ages while O. J. Solander with
.364 and Lope/, with .3(51) are ahead
but have batted only 55 and 46
times respectively.
Both Lawrence and Ferrazzano
are figured to be a a great help
to the varsity lineup next season
in the infield. Also Miller is ex
pected to greatly, help out the
Indian mound crew.
