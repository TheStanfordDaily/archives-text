of West Coast collegiate rowing.
All hough everyone from Stan
ford varsity coach Conn Findlay
to managers Jim Anderson and
Lowell Klaisner was working for
a win, the Huskies, showing the
same form as the Washington
crew thai rowed in England's
1958 Henley Regatta and then
beat Trud Rowing Club at Mos
cow later in the summer, added
their eleventh victory to the In
dians' three since competition be
tween the two schools began in
1905.
The loss means that Stanford's
chances for an IRA 1 rip will be
decided only after the Cal race
next week. Last week Washing
