# S.F. Prepares For Braves
## 
### 
After winning two of three
games from the Cincinnati Reds,
the Giants now find themselves
faced with the prospect of a three
game series with the Champion
Milwaukee Braves. The Giants
will meet the Braves in day games
Monday and Wednesday and in a
night affair Tuesday.
Manager Bill Rigney was quite
happy with the win yesterday as
it gave his three hlg starters,
Jones, Sanford, and Antonelli an
extra day's rest before the big
series. ,
In all probability Rigney will
send Sad Sam Jones to the mound
against the Braves on Monday.
In his last appearance, the Tooth
pick Man held the Philadelphia
Phillies to two hits in a very
sharp .job.
With Orlando Cepeda back in
the lineup after a three day
"rest," the Giants will have the
big punch that is needed against
those Braves. Cepeda has hit at
an even live hundred since his
return to the lineup on Saturday,
three of his four hits being for
extra bases.
This is the series that could tell
for the Giants, they could be he
roes or bums, one never knows.
There is no in between for San
Francisco fans â€” either win or you
get booed.
