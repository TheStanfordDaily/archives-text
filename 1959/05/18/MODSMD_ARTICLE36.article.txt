# Alums Nip Cards McColl Too Much
## 
### Bob Payne, Sports Editor 
There is a doctor from Chicago named McColl. and along with a i
professional golfer named Brodie and an off-season Stanford student
named Wiggin and about 61 other West Coast businessmen and j
teachers they gave the Stanford varsity football team a lesson or!
two in the sport Saturday at the Stadium as the old-timers won the j

first alumni fooball game, 23-14.
Nevertheless, the varisity put
on a commendable show, display
ing about twice as much running
power as it showed last year and
some brilliant receiving by little
wing hack Dick Bowers.
Indeed, the Indians did better
than their California counter
parts, who Inst by 23-8 to an
alumni team that might very
well have been run off the field
by Stanford's old-timers.
Brodie to McColl
The end result for - the Cards,
however, was just too much John
Brodie passing to Bill McColl
and too much of a defensive tack
le named Paul Wiggin who just
couldn't he handled by any of the
Tribe forwards.
This is not a disgrace. Wiggin
is a star defensive end for the
powerful Cleveland Browns; Mc-
Coll. the rampaging slot-back of
the explosive Chicago Bears, and
Brodie a passing wizard for the
San Francisco '40ers.
The other quarterbacks Gary
Kerkorian, Bob Nicolet and Bob
Garrett, looked sharp also; as
well as running backs Bill Tan
and Gordy Young, ends Gary Van
Galder and Sam Mot ley, and line
men Chris Marshall, Troy Bar
bee, Wes Wedge, Norm Manoo
gian, Vic Lindskog (of the 1940
team > among others.
All things considered, the var
sity's pet formance wasn't half
bad.
Alumni Struck Early
The clums struck for a Brodie
sneak touchdown and a Dick
Horn field goal in the first quar
ter, and another TD (Nicolet to
Horn i in the second for* a 17-0
lead. And the varsity came
struggling back.
Next year's Indians went 74
yards in 13 plays, with Hod Sears
firing four yards to Bowers for
the touchdown.
Then, in the last period, after
the old-timers had jumped to a
23-6 advantage (Brodie to Joel
Kiies), a revived varsity took
just six plays to go 02 yards for
its second score with John Bond
skirting end for the final four
yards.
Bond and converted quarter- \
back Sid Garber were real shin
ing lights for the. varsity in the
ball-carrying department. Bond
carried 11 times for 6."> yards and |
the shifty little Garber—one of I
the conference's trickiest run- '
ning quarterbacks last season
picked up 39 yards.
Another, sophomore Hal Steu
ber, showed real speed and abil
ity iir picking up 19 yards in his
two carries.
Sears —fi for 11
Big Dick Norman had a rocky
start in the passing department ;
but settled down to complete six I
for 58 yards. Rod Sears, up from

the red-shirtS, however, had six j
iof 11 for G-l yards and one touch- t
I down.
In the line, tackles Dean Ilin

the dandy task of looking into
Wiggin's eye across the line), j

There is a doctor from Chicago named McColl. and along with a i
professional golfer named Brodie and an off-season Stanford student
named Wiggin and about 61 other West Coast businessmen and j
teachers they gave the Stanford varsity football team a lesson or!
two in the sport Saturday at the Stadium as the old-timers won the j

first alumni fooball game, 23-14.
Nevertheless, the varisity put
on a commendable show, display
ing about twice as much running
power as it showed last year and
some brilliant receiving by little
wing hack Dick Bowers.
Indeed, the Indians did better
than their California counter
parts, who Inst by 23-8 to an
alumni team that might very
well have been run off the field
by Stanford's old-timers.
Brodie to McColl
The end result for - the Cards,
however, was just too much John
Brodie passing to Bill McColl
and too much of a defensive tack
le named Paul Wiggin who just
couldn't he handled by any of the
Tribe forwards.
This is not a disgrace. Wiggin
is a star defensive end for the
powerful Cleveland Browns; Mc-
Coll. the rampaging slot-back of
the explosive Chicago Bears, and
Brodie a passing wizard for the
San Francisco '40ers.
The other quarterbacks Gary
Kerkorian, Bob Nicolet and Bob
Garrett, looked sharp also; as
well as running backs Bill Tan
and Gordy Young, ends Gary Van
Galder and Sam Mot ley, and line
men Chris Marshall, Troy Bar
bee, Wes Wedge, Norm Manoo
gian, Vic Lindskog (of the 1940
team > among others.
All things considered, the var
sity's pet formance wasn't half
bad.
Alumni Struck Early
The clums struck for a Brodie
sneak touchdown and a Dick
Horn field goal in the first quar
ter, and another TD (Nicolet to
Horn i in the second for* a 17-0
lead. And the varsity came
struggling back.
Next year's Indians went 74
yards in 13 plays, with Hod Sears
firing four yards to Bowers for
the touchdown.
Then, in the last period, after
the old-timers had jumped to a
23-6 advantage (Brodie to Joel
Kiies), a revived varsity took
just six plays to go 02 yards for
its second score with John Bond
skirting end for the final four
yards.
