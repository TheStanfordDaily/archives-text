Stanford's lino two-mile relay
team raptured their event at the
Los Angeles Coliseum Relays last
Friday night and John Kelly took
thint place in the jump.
In the two-mile event, IJS(' led

ford and IVnn State taking turns
al second. Penn Stale took over
tho lead about 100 yards before
their second man, Bill Schwab,
passed the baton to Dick Fugle
brick.
Clicsurck Caught Up
Englebrink and Stanford Cap
lain Don Chesarek engaged in a
-hort neck and neck duel until
Clu'saiok set t led back a few
! rides behind Englebrink. Then
the Stanford Captain pulled up
tight and went ahead by a stride
at tin exchange.
From there on it was a battle
for the anchor men, with Stan
ford's Ernie Cunliffe coming out
the victor. Penn State's Charles
King led the Card half-milor until
the final 220 yards of the grueling
race, when Cunliffe turned on the
steam and beat King by better
than five yards.
The Indians' time for the race
was a slow 7:27.3, with Penn State
taking the second spot at 7:27.9.
The slow times were attributed to
the grass track which is present
in the Coliseum, because of the
Dodgers using it as a ball park.

Card splits for the event were:
Cunliffe 1:50.2. Lundh 1:50.9, Che
sarek 1:50.9 and Lassen 1:55.4.
Kelly took the third spot in the
broad jump with a leap of 2-1-3,
just two inches short of the sec
ond place and nine and one-half
inches short of the leader Joel
Wiley of Los Angeles State.
Next weekend the Stanford
track team will be represented in
the Pacific Coast Conference
championships in Seattle, Wash.
The Tribe will in all probability
be in a multi-way battle for third
place behind USC and Oregon.
