## 
### 
Stanford's golfers played their
I steadiest goll ol the 19.>9 season
a, they upset the USC Trojans
Ki'a-lO'l', Saturday on the Stan
! ford course.
The Indians ran their unbeaten
string to l.'J straight and broke
the Trojans' unbeaten match play
string at 51. Ii was the first win
over Troy by the Cards since 1954.
Medalist for the matches with
a blistering 71, was Trojan AI tlei
! berger. (Jeiherger downed Stan
ford's liernie Magnussen, who
i shot a 7 1.
Magnussen, Jack Lamcy. and
Woodgie Keich shot 71's for the
! Indian.v, with lion Preston, Kent
W into n and Dob Snelling all
| shoot ing 7.75.
Made the Difference
This is what made the differ -
j ence in the match. While the In-
I dians were all shooting about the
j same, two of the Trojans let their
scores slip to the low XO's.
USC was expected to be the
'oughest competition the Indians
faced this season. And they were
just that. The Trojans were slat
led to win the national collegiate
I title, but now the whole race is in
| an uproar.
Next week end will tell, as the
I Indians travel to Eugene, Oregon
for the Pacific Coast Conference
championships. Should the Cards
| take the PCC title from the fa
vored Trojans, they could win the
national title.
Things Look Brighter
At the first of the 19159 season
things looked dark for the Indian
| link.sters. When Bill Seanor, one
of the top collegiate golfers in the
nation was lost for the year in an
automobile accident. But several
i m pr o v e d golfers have come
through for the Cards. Fellows
like Reich, Preston, Lamey and
! Winton have all come through
well for the Indians, and this has

made the difference.
Put the above together with vet
erans like Magnussen and Snell
ing, and you have the story of
Coach Bud Finger's undefeated
19:7.) goll team.
Coach Bud Finger feels that
the Indians should finish no low
er than .second in the PCC cham
pionships. With a little luck he
feels the Cards could go all the
way and take the title and go on
to the nationals.
Stanford could be the big spoil
er of the Conference in the finals.
They have shown all season that
they could come up with good
scores when needed, as attested
to by their unbeaten record. The
Cards have the ability and appar
ently the desire to win the Con
ference championships, and the
only thing to hold them back now
is bad luck on the tough and un
familiar course in Oregon.
