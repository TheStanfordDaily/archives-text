Bands CompHc
Serious moments completed
those assembled split into twr
groups for the game, the return
ing alumni and seniors forming
the band for the alumni side of
the stadium.
For some reason the student
band didn't think the alumn
band was playing very loud . .
now whether this was because
the wind was blowing in th<
wrong direction, the old senior. 1
and alums didn't have as much
wind to blow with as the "young
sters" in the student band group
or the alumni band was smallei
in numbers isn't really known.
But to remedy the situatioi
senior Curt Russell headed ;
"committee" which came up with

a microphone to help the group J
along. Eric Hanson and Russell
were even succesful in enticing
â€¢he pompon girls to come to the
alumni's side for a couple of
numbers. They were welcomed
by the musicians with "Welcome
Pompon Dollies."
