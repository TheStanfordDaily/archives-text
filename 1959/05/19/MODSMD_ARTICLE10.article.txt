The Chappies obviously have
been on areheological expeditions
lately, as they have been digging
into thoir- files for cartoons and
information to print in tomor
row's publication a history, in
cartoon form, of the past 60
years of the Chaparral.
Included are some jokes which,
one must bo warned, one may not
easily understand. The Old Roy
laughs this off as the fact. that,
wo do not understand what, was
funny to people a few years ago.
Sure thing!
But about the most heartening
thing in Hie whole issue is a line
to be found under one of the
jokes. Even the Chappies finally
feel that "Who was that lady I
saw you with last night?" has
boon so overworked that they
promise: "This is positively the
last version of this joke that this
magazine will print." Sounds like
music, doesn't it?
