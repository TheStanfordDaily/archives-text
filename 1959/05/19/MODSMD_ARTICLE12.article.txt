# HERTER, GROMYKO CLASH ON GERMAN REUNIFICATION
## ‘Germany Still An Entity,' West Says 
### 
(/P)--East and West
rejected each other's rival pro
posals for a German settlement
at the Big Four foreign minis
ters' conference Monday.
U.S. Secretary of State Chris
tian A. Herter charged the Soviet
plan for separate peace treaties
with East and West Germany
carried "the seeds of future dis
j cord and conflict." He accused
he Soviet Union of blocking a
German settlement.
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
A. Gromyko snapped back that
he United States, Britain and
France were trying to promote a
state of half-war, half-peace in
Germany. He said German uni-
I fication could not be discused at
this or any other conference.
Occupation Regime
Gromyko claimed the Western
powers were trying to extend
their "occupation regime in West
Berlin" to encompass East Ber
lin, capital of the East German
regime.
He turned down the broad
Western package approach for
gradual Ger m a n reunification
and described Western proposals
for uniting East and West Berlin
—the first phase of the package
—as "utterly unacceptable."
In his hour-long speech Gro
myko said German reunification
was possible only through direct
action by the East and West Ger
man states.
Avenues Left Open
Gromyko left open some ave
nues of negotiation, however, by
expressing a willingness to dis
cuss some aspccts of the West
ern package.
He mentioned specifically dis
armament, a nonaggression dec
laration, creation of a mixed
committee of East and West Ger
mans and an arms limitation
zone in Central Europe.
Herter took the firmest pos
sible line on German unification.
The tall American diplomat said
| a final peace treaty can only be
made with an "all-German gov-
I ernment, freely chosen by the
German people."
As far as the United States is
concerned, Herter said, Germany
still exists as an entity under in
ternational law despite the fact,
that the country has been split,
since the conclusion of World
War 11.

cuss some aspccts of the West
ern package.

sible line on German unification.
The tall American diplomat said
| a final peace treaty can only be
made with an "all-German gov-
I ernment, freely chosen by the

rejected each other's rival pro
posals for a German settlement
at the Big Four foreign minis
ters' conference Monday.
