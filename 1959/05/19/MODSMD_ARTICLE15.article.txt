# This Point of View
## Curve System: Fair to All? 
### Elna Rodenhouse 
The quarter and tlie year are
almost over and we have, depend
ing on how well we spent our
time, only one concrete thing to
show lor ii: grades. These are
going to be important to us later
on, in view of graduate school,
competition for jobs, etc., so per
haps an analysis of how we re
ceived them is worth commenting
upon.
Grades are here to stay; there
is nothing, short of a revolution,
that can change this situation.
Grades, under any system, are an
attempt to reflect what the stu
dent learned in a course. The
problem confronting the student
is whether grades under a "curve"
system reflect accurately what he
learned in a course.
S< t, Hut Equal
At this point, Stanford is on the
"curve" system, with specified,
but equal, amounts of students
getting A's and D's, and larger,
but also equal, portions of stu
dents getting B's and C's. What
does this mean? Just that, in
earning your A in a course, you
succeeded in giving somebody else
a D.
The curve system, in my opin
ion, promotes, on the face, equal
grade distribution. Underneath its
face, one finds tooth and nail com
petition between the students for
the higher grades. This leads not
so much to real learning and un
derstanding of the subject, but to
memorization of more facts than
the next person In the hope that
you'll get the A instead of him.
Not Adequate
Because the curve allows only
a measure of a student's knowl
edge of a subject in relation to
other students, and not in relation
to the course material itself, it
seems that the curve does not
offer an adequate standard by
which a student can measure this
knowledge.
Considering a test as a 'judg
ment of the student's grasp of a
subject, the student can only
cram as many facts into his brain
as he can remember, and go into
the test with the hope that he has
more facts at his disposal than
anyone else taking the same test.
'Average'
Also, the curve idea is based on
the assumption that every class is
average â€” there will be some
bright students and roughly the
same amount of students who de
serve low grades, with the bulk of
students doing average work.
Unfortunately, classes are not
usually 'average' in their distri
bution of bi ight and lazy students.
This means, according to the
curve, that some students may
get higher or lower grades than
they deserve.
To be considered, too, is the fact

that Stanford students were in ap
proximately the top five percent
ul their graduating class in high
school. Mere, students who could
easily get A's oy B's at a stale uni
versity are forced to be satisfied,
under the curve, with C's and D's.
How can this problem be re
solved?
Absolute Scale?
The obvious solution, at first, is
to resort to a system of an abso
lute scale. There are, however, ad
vantage's and disadvantages to
this system.
Among Ihe advantages to the
absolute scale is the idea thai a
student has a better scale by
which he can measure his knowl
edge.
Assuming thai the professor of
a class is the person who can best
judge how well a student knows
lhe subject, the professor should
have the opportunity to let his
students know how their knowl
edge of the subject will be meas
ured. The professor should not be
handicapped by having to distrib
ute his grades according to set
percentages.
Better Understanding
An absolute system would also,
in most cases, lead to a better un
derstanding of the subject, rather
j than random memorization of
I footnotes and other trivial details,
which, in most cases, presently
i lead to higher grades under the
curve system.
As a few professors are doing
now in veering away from the
strict curve, the professor, under
the absolute system, would be al
lowed to make up tests that would
reveal his s t uden t s' general
knowledge of the subject, rather
than having to insert trivial de
tails that would stump enough of
them to make his grade distribu
tion look good.
Variation in Quality
The absolute system would do
away with the fallacy that every
class is 'average' and would allow
for quarter to quarter variation
in class quality. This would mean,
of course, that students could no
longer depend on quarterly cam
pus moods to determine where in
a class an individual would stand.
The curve system makes a pret
ty picture at the Registrar's of
fice; it also looks good when used
in general statistics. Outwardly,
it gives the Stanford faculty the
appearance of being fair in their
judgment of students' grasp of
subjects. But is it really fair to
the students or to the faculty?
Would it not be better to draw
away from the strict curve, espe
cially as applied to smaller class
es, and allow not only for quarter
to quarter variation but also al
low for students to be judged as
individuals rather than as parts
of a percentage?
