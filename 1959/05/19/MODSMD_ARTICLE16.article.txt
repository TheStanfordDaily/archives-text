Letter or Column?
Editor, The Daily:
The May 6 issue of The Daily
published to letters to the editor
regarding the Kendall-Sibley de
bate. Both contained rather in
sulting attacks on Dr. Kendall,
one more or less open and the
other insinuating a great deal
more than it said.
Furthermore this second letter
contained some political agita
tion of a kind 1 consider very in
teresting and well worth closer
analysis and, 11 possible, further
explanation.
Wishing to brace these individ
uals on their loose talk, correct
any misconceptions Ihey might
have created, and explicate, to
the best of my ability, some por
tions of Dr. Kendall's argument
that might be subject to misun
derstanding, 1 wrote an article
for publication in The Daily
touching on these points. As it
exceeds in length the word limit
for letters to the editor it would
have to appear in the"From This
Point of View" column which has
been s.o.p.
I think it a matter of great in
terest that, for various obscure
reasons, The Daily has flatly re
fused to publish this article, and
I, as an interested member of the
student body, demand an expla
nation beyond the mere state
ment that The Daily does not
have to publish all the material

it receives. The firsl appearance
of this refusal is that The Daily
takes an editorial stand behind
the writers of the letters.

(Editor's Note: Mr. Long;
doesn't seem to understand the
purpose or function of the
"From This Point of View" col
umn. It is not meant to "ac
commodate" letters to tlie edi
tor which exceed the 250-word
limit; the purpose of the col
umn is to give students and
faculty' a place where they
might express written opinion
or comment on topics in which
we feel the student body lias
an interest.
(Such articles must he pre
arranged with the editor he
fore they are submitted for
publication.
(Further, the column is for
articles, not answers to previ
ously published letters. Mr.
Long's contribution was an an
swer to two lett< rs, and we felt
that the comments weren't of
sufficient interest to our reda
ers, hence we ruled the contri
bution unacceptable.)

Letter or Column?
Editor, The Daily:
The May 6 issue of The Daily
published to letters to the editor
regarding the Kendall-Sibley de
bate. Both contained rather in
sulting attacks on Dr. Kendall,
one more or less open and the
other insinuating a great deal
more than it said.
Furthermore this second letter
contained some political agita
tion of a kind 1 consider very in
teresting and well worth closer
analysis and, 11 possible, further
explanation.
Wishing to brace these individ
uals on their loose talk, correct
any misconceptions Ihey might
have created, and explicate, to
the best of my ability, some por
tions of Dr. Kendall's argument
that might be subject to misun
derstanding, 1 wrote an article
for publication in The Daily
touching on these points. As it
exceeds in length the word limit
for letters to the editor it would
have to appear in the"From This
Point of View" column which has
been s.o.p.
I think it a matter of great in
terest that, for various obscure
reasons, The Daily has flatly re
fused to publish this article, and
I, as an interested member of the
student body, demand an expla
nation beyond the mere state
ment that The Daily does not
have to publish all the material

it receives. The firsl appearance
of this refusal is that The Daily
takes an editorial stand behind
the writers of the letters.
