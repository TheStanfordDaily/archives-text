Loaded Questions
Editor, The Daily:
Many of the people who filled
in the opinion questionnaire cir
culated at the foreign policy con
ference last Tuesday complained
that some of the questions were
loaded. They're right, of course,
and we're grateful for the long
and thoughtful comments that
were added on some of the ques
tionnaires.
One of the questions we asked
was, "Do you believe that nuclear
warfare is a feasible method with
which to defend democracy?"
This question may be loaded, but
so is our present foreign policy:
it assumes that we CAN defend

an ideal by the threat and even
tual use of nuclear weapons, if
necessary.
Contrary to Ihe impression that
some people seemed tu get from
the conference theme, "Can Arms
Win Peace?", we were not trying
to convince anyone of a pacifist
position. We merely wanted to
challenge the assumption current
with so many people that military
force is enough in itself to achieve
world peace and contain Commu
nist expansion.
The arms build-up is supposed
to deter war, but too few people
are willing to face the literally
crucial questiort: Will a spiraling
balance of power BE a deterrent,
in the long run? If not, the U.S.

should drastically increase its al
ternative programs and seriously
consider other methods of pursu
ing world peace.

C"lass Unity
Kditor, The Daily:
Our main function as social be
ings is to learn to live in and eon
tribute to our society. This func
tion should be the ultimate goal
of a university education. Theo
retically, college life provides ari
atmosphere which enables us to
come nearer to achieving this
goal. How? At Stanford we live
in a community where we have a
meeting ground for unity . . .
We should employ this common
ground as a starting point for a
rich interchange. Around us are
people who think differently; Ihey
have different ideas, different
standards, different qualities.
Though interchange or apprecia
tion of these diversities, we grow
as individuals.
As the prefix "inter" implies, a
relationship must exist "between"
two parties; each must offer his
individual self and learn to meet
others halfway. As freshmen, we
are aware of a disunity in our
class; this is because many of Ihe
members of our class are not will
[ ing to give of themselves suffi-
I ciently. Is this selfishness or in
! security?
We are not getting the entire
benefit from college because we
do nol have the full opportunity
to develop ourselves through this
; rich interchange of individualities.
If the 1,246 members of the Class
of '62 cannot achieve unity, how
â–  can we expect to achieve interna
tional harmony or world prog
i ro.ss?

So Right !
Editor, The Daily:
I believe that I have now heard
the final, true and just description
of Stanford University. In the ar
ticle by your Managing Editor,
"Campus Isolation Creates Prob
lems," I find the following sen
tence: "Its undergraduate pres
tige reigns unchallenged by other
large coeducational private uni
versities on the West Coast."
You're so right.
