## The 						Uneasy Question 
### 
It is still touch and go whether
the President will get from this
Congress exactly the budget he
has asked for. liui on the broad
principles which lie has adopted,
he seems now to be assured of
support.
These principles are thai the
next budget shall be balanced
approximately and that this shall
be done not by raising taxes but
by holding down military and ci
vilian expenditures. for the
time being the battle the Presi
dent is waging against inflation
is going reasonably well, in that
the price level is on the whole
standing still.
Utile Support
Nevertheless, the news from
the money markets gives little
support to the idea that the bat
tle against inflation is being won.
The Treasury is having to pay
very high rates for very short
term money. The long-term bond
market is depressed while stocks
and real estate are booming.
These are the classic signs of
inflation, that is to say, of a
lack of confidence that money
will conserve its purchasing
power. When there is this lark
of confidence, people prefer to
own tangible goods, as they do
when they buy equity shares,
to having what are promises to
pay dollars in the future.
The behavior of the markets
reflects the judgments of the
great investing institutions with
their expert advisers. These
markets are, therefore ,a kind of
running Gallup Poll in which
those who are questioned back
their opinions with their money.
Continuing Inflation
They are saying that they ex
pect a c on t in u in g inflation,
whether or not the President
wins his fight in this Congress
about this particular budget.
When we ask ourselves what
is the basis of this pessimism,
we must begin by remember
ing that there is no precise an
swer to this question. We are
dealing with a situation where
a preponderant majority of in
vestigators not only in this
country but also abroad have
come to the same practical
conclusion, though not neces
sarily for the same reasons.
The same conclusion they have
come to is quite evidently that in
the battle against inflation the
President has not produced a
policy that is good for more than
the next budget, lie has no pol
icy which is good for a much
longer future.
It may be that Ihe 1900 budget
can be made to balance, though
even this takes a certain amount

of finesse in the bookkeeping.
Bui if this particular budget is
balanced, it will be done not by
reducing expenditures but by
postponing them.
If we look at our national
commitments, it is unfortunately
all too probable that our position
as a whole is going to be out of
balance for years to come. Our
national commitments are for de
fense, for internal development,
for welfare and public facilities.
Lined lip against these com
mitments we also have commit
ments to the farmers and to
the veterans and to the taxpay
ers, who are expecting a tax re
duction.
Substantial Increase
In the field of civilian expendi
tures, there must be a substan
tial increase over the present
level unless by some unlikely
miracle the huge agricultural
subsidies can be done away with
or at least drastically reduced.
It is virtually certain that the
public money spent for public
facilities will rise steeply in the
years to come.
Moreover, owing to the World
War and the Korean War there
is a big backlog of necessary pub
lic expenditures for schools, hos
pitals and many kinds of proj
ects to conserve and develop our
natural resources.
Modernize Facilities
If a third world war is averted,
as probably it can be, we can
count it for certain that Ihe dec
ade of the sixties will see a move
ment, comparable with the New
Deal of the thirties, to modernize
the public facilities of this coun
try.
Is there a remedy? Certainly
there is no simple and easy one.
What must come first, however,
is to stop pretending that, the
19(i0 budget is a genuine and ade
quate answer to the problem of
inflation.
Then we have to begin de
fining and posing the real ques
tions which will confront us.
They arrive from the fact that
in order to balance the budget
against the rising expenditures
which are inevitable, we must
brace ourselves to the grim,
the politically untouchable and
unspeakable truth that we shall
have to raise more taxes,

of confidence, people prefer to

Continuing Inflation
They are saying that they ex

whether or not the President
wins his fight in this Congress
about this particular budget.
When we ask ourselves what
is the basis of this pessimism,
we must begin by remember
ing that there is no precise an
swer to this question. We are
dealing with a situation where
a preponderant majority of in
vestigators not only in this
country but also abroad have
come to the same practical
conclusion, though not neces
sarily for the same reasons.
The same conclusion they have
come to is quite evidently that in
the battle against inflation the
President has not produced a
policy that is good for more than
the next budget, lie has no pol
icy which is good for a much
longer future.
It may be that Ihe 1900 budget
can be made to balance, though
even this takes a certain amount

of finesse in the bookkeeping.
Bui if this particular budget is
balanced, it will be done not by
reducing expenditures but by
postponing them.
If we look at our national
commitments, it is unfortunately
all too probable that our position
as a whole is going to be out of
balance for years to come. Our
national commitments are for de
fense, for internal development,
for welfare and public facilities.
Lined lip against these com
mitments we also have commit
ments to the farmers and to
the veterans and to the taxpay
ers, who are expecting a tax re
duction.
Substantial Increase
In the field of civilian expendi
tures, there must be a substan
tial increase over the present
level unless by some unlikely
miracle the huge agricultural
subsidies can be done away with
or at least drastically reduced.
It is virtually certain that the
public money spent for public
facilities will rise steeply in the
years to come.
Moreover, owing to the World
War and the Korean War there
is a big backlog of necessary pub
lic expenditures for schools, hos
pitals and many kinds of proj
ects to conserve and develop our
natural resources.
Modernize Facilities
If a third world war is averted,
as probably it can be, we can
count it for certain that Ihe dec
ade of the sixties will see a move
ment, comparable with the New
Deal of the thirties, to modernize
the public facilities of this coun
try.
Is there a remedy? Certainly
there is no simple and easy one.
What must come first, however,
is to stop pretending that, the
19(i0 budget is a genuine and ade
quate answer to the problem of
inflation.
Then we have to begin de
fining and posing the real ques

They arrive from the fact that
in order to balance the budget
against the rising expenditures
which are inevitable, we must
brace ourselves to the grim,
the politically untouchable and
unspeakable truth that we shall

It is still touch and go whether
the President will get from this
Congress exactly the budget he
has asked for. liui on the broad
principles which lie has adopted,
he seems now to be assured of
support.
These principles are thai the
next budget shall be balanced
approximately and that this shall
be done not by raising taxes but
by holding down military and ci
vilian expenditures. for the
time being the battle the Presi
dent is waging against inflation
is going reasonably well, in that
the price level is on the whole

Nevertheless, the news from

very high rates for very short

policy that is good for more than
the next budget, lie has no pol
icy which is good for a much
longer future.
It may be that Ihe 1900 budget
can be made to balance, though
even this takes a certain amount

of finesse in the bookkeeping.
Bui if this particular budget is
balanced, it will be done not by
reducing expenditures but by
postponing them.
If we look at our national
commitments, it is unfortunately
all too probable that our position
as a whole is going to be out of
balance for years to come. Our
national commitments are for de
fense, for internal development,
for welfare and public facilities.
Lined lip against these com
mitments we also have commit
ments to the farmers and to
the veterans and to the taxpay
ers, who are expecting a tax re
duction.
Substantial Increase
In the field of civilian expendi
tures, there must be a substan
tial increase over the present
level unless by some unlikely
miracle the huge agricultural
subsidies can be done away with
or at least drastically reduced.
It is virtually certain that the
public money spent for public
facilities will rise steeply in the
years to come.
Moreover, owing to the World
War and the Korean War there
is a big backlog of necessary pub
lic expenditures for schools, hos
pitals and many kinds of proj
ects to conserve and develop our
natural resources.
Modernize Facilities
If a third world war is averted,
as probably it can be, we can
count it for certain that Ihe dec
ade of the sixties will see a move
ment, comparable with the New
Deal of the thirties, to modernize
the public facilities of this coun
try.
Is there a remedy? Certainly
there is no simple and easy one.
What must come first, however,
is to stop pretending that, the
19(i0 budget is a genuine and ade
quate answer to the problem of
inflation.
Then we have to begin de
fining and posing the real ques
tions which will confront us.
They arrive from the fact that
in order to balance the budget
against the rising expenditures
which are inevitable, we must
brace ourselves to the grim,
the politically untouchable and
unspeakable truth that we shall
have to raise more taxes,
(c) 19f>!) New York Herald Tribune

It is still touch and go whether
the President will get from this
Congress exactly the budget he
has asked for. liui on the broad
principles which lie has adopted,
he seems now to be assured of
support.
These principles are thai the
next budget shall be balanced
approximately and that this shall
be done not by raising taxes but
by holding down military and ci
vilian expenditures. for the
time being the battle the Presi
dent is waging against inflation
is going reasonably well, in that
the price level is on the whole
standing still.
Utile Support
Nevertheless, the news from
the money markets gives little
support to the idea that the bat
tle against inflation is being won.
The Treasury is having to pay
very high rates for very short
term money. The long-term bond
market is depressed while stocks
and real estate are booming.
These are the classic signs of
inflation, that is to say, of a
lack of confidence that money
will conserve its purchasing
power. When there is this lark
of confidence, people prefer to
own tangible goods, as they do
when they buy equity shares,
to having what are promises to
pay dollars in the future.
The behavior of the markets
reflects the judgments of the
great investing institutions with
their expert advisers. These
markets are, therefore ,a kind of
running Gallup Poll in which
those who are questioned back
their opinions with their money.
Continuing Inflation
They are saying that they ex
pect a c on t in u in g inflation,
whether or not the President
wins his fight in this Congress
about this particular budget.
When we ask ourselves what
is the basis of this pessimism,
we must begin by remember
ing that there is no precise an
swer to this question. We are
dealing with a situation where
a preponderant majority of in
vestigators not only in this
country but also abroad have
come to the same practical
conclusion, though not neces
sarily for the same reasons.
The same conclusion they have
come to is quite evidently that in
the battle against inflation the
President has not produced a
policy that is good for more than
the next budget, lie has no pol
icy which is good for a much
longer future.
