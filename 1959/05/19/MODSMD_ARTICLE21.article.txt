# It's the Last-- PCC Spike Fest
## DAILY Sports SCENE 
### Dick Barney 
News is often the story of
"firsis." But for the Pacific
('oast ('onfeience, ] 1)58 59 has
been a year of stories about
"lasts " And now as the athletic
year draws to an end, the news
scene shifts to one of the "last
of the lasts" the PCC track and
field championships.
Teamwise, there's not much
dout who's going to win this final
meeting ol track teams under the
ll;tk r ol the PCC. Southern Cali
fornia is the top-heavy choice to
win its l.Xth crown in the past If)
years, although Oregon could
challenge in the meet scheduled
for Friday and Saturday in Se
attle.
Ducks in Second
Oregon should, at any rate,
have little trouble in nailing
down the number two spot,
Third place could go to any of
four other schools Stanford,
California, Washington or UC
LA.
The Indians and Bears would
appear to hold a slight edge, but
in a meet where the scoring goes
five deep, dual meet scores often
mean lit Ile.
Champions in seven 1058
events are still in action this
year, and have chances ranging
from very good to very poor to
retain their crowns.
Charlie Dumas, currently the
best high jumper in the country,
looks to have the top chance to
repeat. He won last year at a
mediocre (for him) 07, but has
already soared seven feet this
spring.
White Faces Trouble
Willie White, the defending ti
tlist in both sprints, won't have
a very easy time winning gold
medals again. White hasn't had
a good year; consequently, Ros
cue Cook (it Oregon looks tough
est in the 100, with Trojan Bobby
Staten the top man in the 220.
Terry Tobacco, who's won the
lio for two years, will face
trouble from Staten in the quar
ter. Unless a home-track advan
tage works wonders for Tobacco,
Staten should stop the skein at
t wo.
In fact, a fourth is conceivable
for Tobacco. Cal's Jack Yerman
is just a shade behind Staten and
Oregon's Otis Davis has tri
umphed over the Husky twice
this season, including a 47.8 vic
tory in last week's Northern Di
vision meet.
Jerry Siebert of Cal will meet
a strong BXO test in Ernie Cun
liffe of Stanford. Siebert took
Cunlifle's measure in Big Meet
but had the advantage of rest
while Cunliffe had run the mile.
Cunliffe, at ,1:49.9, has the bel
ter seasonal time of Ihe pair.
A I'M Keturns
Walt Aril of WSC won the
lows in a movie decision last
year. He's run well in the highs
this year, but doesn't look good
enough in the lows lo outspeed
White.
Jim Grelle of Oregon, two-time
NCAA runner-up, is back in the
mile and stands as the favorite.
He'll get trouble from Bob
Shankland of Southern Califor
nia, Bertil Lundh of Stanford and
Jack Larson of Washington.
UCLA polo vaulter George
Roubanis has been woefully in
consistent this spring, and could
surrender to any of a half-dozen
oilier vaulters.

a very easy time winning gold
medals again. White hasn't had
a good year; consequently, Ros

Terry Tobacco, who's won the

trouble from Staten in the quar

Staten should stop the skein at

In fact, a fourth is conceivable
for Tobacco. Cal's Jack Yerman
is just a shade behind Staten and
Oregon's Otis Davis has tri
umphed over the Husky twice
this season, including a 47.8 vic

Jerry Siebert of Cal will meet
a strong BXO test in Ernie Cun

Cunlifle's measure in Big Meet

while Cunliffe had run the mile.
Cunliffe, at ,1:49.9, has the bel
