# THE 						LAST WEEK
## Card Nine Preps for Cal Crucial 
### 
Southern California resumed
its aura of invincibility last
weekend and clinched both the
Southern Division and CIBA
championships and left Stan
ford's baseball team with little
more than lots of hope.
Saturday's upcoming battle
with Cal now looms as the big
key for the Indians and the Bears
as a victory means the second
spot in both conferences and to
the second place goes what hopes
there are of picking lip an NCAA
playoff invitation.
Curds vs. Service
Stanford warms up today and
tomorrow in non â€¢ conference
clashes against a pair of service
teams. Today the Tribe hosts the
Camp Pendleton Marines at the
Sunken Diamond and tomorrow
the San Francisco Presidio. Both
clashes are set for 3:15 p.m.
The "magic number" of three
that was going to get Stanford
into the CIBA second spot two
weeks ago has now been reduced
to one. Stanford whipped Santa
Clara and Cal lost one game to
UCLA to get the "number" now
not as important as it looked at
first down to one. But it is a
matter of all or nothing now as
both the Indians and Bears have
only the Saturday game remain
ing on their regular schedules.
Tribe Leads, 21
Cal topped the Tribe, 7-5, in
the season's first meeting but
Stanford wiped that out last
month with 10-5 and 15-0 romp
ings on successive days.
Junior third - baseman Jimmy
Burk crashed out two homers in
the two IJSC games last week
and raised his average to .303,
now second on the Indians to Lee
Moench's .35(5. Mike Magee is at
.301 and Ben Robinson raised his
mark to an eyen .300 with four
Bovard Field base hits last week.
Magee still leads the run pro
ducers with 20 i hi, followed by
Robinson's 10.
