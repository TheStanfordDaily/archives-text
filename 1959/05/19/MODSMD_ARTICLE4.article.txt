# NEW MEASURE
## Liquor Limits May Be Under ABC Control 
### Dick Barnes Associate Editor 
A new slate legislative meas
ure to eliminate the 1-to-l'a-milo
liquor limit from around colleges
and universities in California will
not result in saturation of adja
cent - to â€¢ campus land with bars
and liquor stores.
A spokesman for State Sena
tor James McAteer of San Fran
cisco, author of the measure, told
The Daily the hill turns over
complete authority in the field
of liquor licenses to I lie Alcoholic
Beverage Control office.
Applies to Stanford
He also said the measure will
apply to all colleges and univer
sities in the state, clarifying an
original report on the bill which
could have been interpreted as
applying il only to state-support
ed institutions.
State law now provides thai no
liquor establishment can exist
within a certain distance of col
leges or universities. This limit
varies from school to school, but
is in general I to 1'- miles.
The present bill, which has al
ready passed the Senate and now
moves to the Assembly, was in
troduced in face of a mounting
time of special-exemption bills,
designed to provide relief for li
cense holders who would other
wise be forced from business by
campus expansions all over the
state.
One of these bills would allow
nine Palo Alto establishments to
continue in business despite ex
pansion of Stanford boundaries
caused by new married student
housing units.
Similar Positions
The turning over of complete
control to the ABC will place col
leges and universities in the
same position as primary and
secondary schools, churches and
other institutions of a similar na
ture.
Their proximity to proposed
liquor establishments is at pres
ent taken into consideration by
the ABC, rather than being pro
vided for directly in slate law.
If the bill is passed over objec
tions of certain temperance and
church groups, its effect is ex
pected to be measured in terms
of legislative efficiency rather
than influx of liquor businesses
to near-campus sites.
