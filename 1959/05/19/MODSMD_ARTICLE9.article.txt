Grab your firehats and jump
into your boots and don't forget j
to read the whole story 'cause j
the best part's at the end.
Stanford Fire Department had ;
a busy day yesterday. Before j
breakfast, 5:01 a.m. to be exact, I
it was called to Hie Sigma Chi j
house to extinguish five smoke
bombs. No damage. No invita
tion to breakfast.
A bit later, 7:38 a.m., the Lagu-1
nita kitchen invited Kngine 96 1
over to put out a grease fire. No
damage. Still no invitation to
breakfast.
After lunch, 2:27 p.m., an auto-'
matie sprinkler in a trash chute
between Rineonada and Otero at i
Wilbur was set off by a fire |
which may have boon started by ;
a cigarette. The entire fire do-1
partmcnt dropped over to look j
at the scene. No damage. No j
invitation to dinner.
Four twenty seven p.m. found
the department at a rubbish fire
on the Gallentine Ranch at Aras-!
tradero Road and Foothill Boule-1
vard. No damage. No invitation !
to dinner.
Then, at 6:26 p.m., the Daily j
staffers smelled smoke. The fire
was located in a tightly covered
wastecan of inflammables.
Two daring staffers hauled the
can outside and emptied a fire i
extinguisher into it.
With a rather red face, the re
porter on the fire department
beat carried the empty extin
guisher to the department and j
reported the blaze.
No damage. And the firemen j
were already eating dinner.
