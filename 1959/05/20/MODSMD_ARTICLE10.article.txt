# NIELSEN:
## U.S. Must Alter Aid Programs 
### Gary Wright 
The United Stated will eventu
ally have to radically change her
present foreign aid policy tactics,
according to Waldejnar Nielsen,
director of tho Ford (Foundation's
international affairs! program.
Speaking at last night's Tues
| day Evening Series on the Com
j munist economic offensive, Niel
) sen explained how the upswing
of Russian economic expansion
since the death of Stalin has been
I the major movement in Soviet
j foreign relations.
Financial Aid
| With 1958 being the top year of
| the Soviet "ruble war," nearly
$1 billion in low-interest credit
I has recently been divided among
such nations as Yugoslavia, the
United Arab Republic, India, Ar
gentina and Iraq.
Once terms of agreements are
set up, each step of the proceed
ings becomes a widely publicized
Soviet-slanted propaganda pitch.
However, even in the midst of
ceremonial gifts and much Red
' fanfare, the opportunistic Soviets
j have miserably failed, stated
I Nielsen. Although they have
I gained the desired prestige, ma
! nipulated their political instru
| ment and gained their much
sought experience,■ they destroy
! many of their economic gains by
other counteracting political
moves.
Program Failures
The nations receiving the bulk
of the economic assistance con
stantly rebuke their benefactor.
After being cut from Russian aid
programs, Yugoslavia might
even be said to be a "pro-Ameri
can" Communist nation.
Such startling growth from a
once - dominant nation can only
be explained by her production
techniques. Where Russia pro
duces what her nation needs, the
U.S. is still concerned with pro
duction for the individual. This
is where our problem lies.
All hough the conflict between
the West and Russia has been
summed up as the conflict be
tween stagnation and dynamism,
the West is eventually going to
be forced into economic unity to
defend her idealistic aims, he
said.
