# Stanford Players to Give 'Cocktail Party' Tonight
## Emphasis on Words, Acting 
### Mary Lou McKinley 
A serious study on the ap
proach to living will bo drama
tized by the Stanford Players
this evening in T. S. Eliot's "The
Cocktail Party" which opens in
the Littlo Theatre in Memorial
Auditorium at 8:1.3 for the first
night of two three - night runs,
May 20 23 and 27-30.
To emphasize the ideas and
meaning of the play, Lawrence
Wismer, director, has attempted
to keep away from "spectacle"
and to avoid strong, distractive
elements which would compete
with the acting and words.
Suggests Symbolism
"We have tried to suggest Ihe
play's symbolism rather than pic
ture it to its fullest possible ex
tent," Wismer said. "The empha
sis has been placed on the ensem
ble rather than on individual ef
fects," he added.
Visual elements have, likewise,
been simplified so that they may
be quickly and easily compre
hended. The costuming, by Irene
Griffin, should suggest, rather
than display, the level of upper
class English society.
Set designer Paul Landry has
Iried to achieve a concentration
upon the play and action itself
through simplicity. To direct this
concentration and give a "sense
of space," a plain black backdrop
will be used.
Starring in the three-act com
edy will be Tim Haggerty in the
role of Sir Henry Hareourt-Reil
ly, the part created by Alec
Guinness when the play was first,
presented at the Edinburgh Fes
tival in 1949.
Celia Coplestone will be played
by Julia Curtis, Edward Cham
berlayne by Phil Schultz, and La
vinia Chamberlayne by Celia
Howard.

and Jack Gianino will appear as
Alexander Gibbs. The nurse-sec
retary will be played by Mary
Lou Clark and the caterer's men

den.
