## West Rejects Russian Separate Treaties Plan 
### 
GENEVA (A J ) The West accused the Soviet Union Tuesday of
| trying to impose on Germany a peace treaty on the harsh lines of
j the World War I settlement at Versailles.
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko proposed that the Unit*
I ed States, Britain and France drop their drive to reunite Germany

and acccpt a Soviet blueprint for
a peace treaty with each of the
German states, East and West.
French Foreign Minister Couve
de Murville and British Foreign
Secretary Selwyn Lloyd led ihe
Western attack against the So
viet project.
Lloyd's Comment
Lloyd declared that the Com
munist draft "would have to be
imposed" if it were to cover the
72 million Germans now divided
by the Iron Curtain.
"What the Soviri government
is doing in effect is to show that
they wish to impose terms on
Germany as was done at Ver
sailles," Lloyd siad.
Couve de Murville delivered a
30-minute condemnation of the
Soviet plan in hard - hitting
French.
Division of Germany
"Such a treaty would do noth
ing to solve the problem facing
us," he said. "It would do one
thing only: set the four powers'
seai on the division of Germany."
Gromyko retorted coldly that
the Western peace plan for a
phased reunification of Germany
would permit unlimited German
rearmament.
Wilhelrrf Grewe, heading the
West German delegation in Ihe
ministerial .sessions, declared:
"Only a peace treaty freely nego
tiated by a government author
ized by the entire German people
will have the morally binding
power to create stable conditions
for a long time to come."
