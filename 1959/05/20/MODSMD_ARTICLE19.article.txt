# Complete, Accurate: Too Much to Expect?

### 
Is rr rf.ally too MUCH to expect all departments and the admin
istration to give us a complete and accurate "Bulletin of Courses
and Degrees" for the coming \ear in time for pre-registration
du.'ing spring quarter?
Or is it really "not possible at the date this announcement goes
to press to schedule courses accurately lor the year," as the note
above the Economies Department's very incomplete listing of
course information in the new directory tells usV
The need for an accurate listing of courses for the
coming year—complete with the time they nil I In- offered
and the instructor—should be apparent.
• First, if a student is going to be able to plan a total, cohesive
program for the year, instead of indiscriminately picking this
course or that for obscure reasons each pre-reg week, In* has to have
a complete and accurate listing in advance.
• Second, too often a student counts on the times given iti
"Courses and Degrees" when planning ahead, and finds these times
changed when the Time Schedule conies out. The conflicts that
develop are upsetting, and often desirable courses have to he by
passed by the student.
I his particular "Courses and Degreescontain a num
ber of "to be given in 1960-61" comments. The advice
comes a little late for the student gradualing in "60 who
hasn't been warned until now that the course is only being
given alternate years.
YThile the new stay-open binding is a fine improvement, the
departments and the University would be doing the students a
real service if they would give us a complete and accurate listing
of courses for the year. Some departments manage to do this now;
we suspect all that is needed in the others is a little more concern
about the matter —and more careful planning.
