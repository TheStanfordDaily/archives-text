Relevant Details
Editor, The Daily:
May I call your attention to
the lack of relevant details in re
views of certain activities, such
as lectures, on the campus? As
examples, I cite the following re
ports which appeared in The
Daily last week.
The first of these is the ac
count of the Gardner Patterson
lecture on foreign trade, report
ed in The Daily last Friday. The
whole discussion on military aid
was concluded in one sentence:
"Patterson also discussed the mil
itary aid to foreign countries."
Is this subject so self evident
that The Daily felt no need to
quote Patterson's views and anal
ysis of the problem?

The second example is the re
view of the debate on capital pun
ishment. The review completely
failed to bring out the significant
points of the debate. Interested
readers should compare with the
review of the Palo Alto Times,
Wednesday, May 13.
In the debate, Mr. Hawley stat
ed few reasons commonly used
to support the death penalty and
questioned the propriety of these
reasons; however, The Daily
chose to omit this part complete
ly-
... In view of the fact that
about one page of each Daily is
devoted to spoils, I believe re
views of the above activities de
serve more space and attention.
