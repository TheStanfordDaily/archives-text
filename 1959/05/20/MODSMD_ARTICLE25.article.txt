# VIEWPOINT
## Censorship of Literary Review Raises Questions on Standards 
### Randolph Hudson English Dept 
After administrators of the
[ University of Chicago decided
that the proposed contents of
their student edited Chicago Re
i view were objectionable, the edi
tor, 1 r vi n g Rosenthal, quit,
founded his own quarterly review
t i Big Table), and published the
\ suspect material in his first
I issue.
Despite its star spangled, red,
! white and blue cover, the new
j quarterly was deemed unfit for
transportation by our mails, and
I presumably no more copies will
join the rapidly diminishing pile
at Kepler's Book Store.
"Naked Lunch"
Without doubt, it was William
Burroughs' story, "Naked
I Lunch," a "mosaic seen alter
nately through the dead, under
sea eyes of junk, and the peeled
nerves and sense of junk sick
ness," which chiefly offended the
various authorities.
The language is pretty strong,
but speaking as an ex-soldier,
camp counselor and baseball um
pire, I can report that Burroughs'
speech is more varied but not
much bolder than language used

by a majority of American males
from Little-League age on up.
Whether or not artists may he
allowed to follow Wordsworth's
advice and employ "a selection ol'
language really used by men" is
a problem that remains unde
cided.
More important is Burroughs'
vulgarity, some of it gratuitous,
but much of it consistently
worked into a distressingly con
vincing vision of the lite ol a
drug-addicted homosexual.
Possible Lltccts
But it is difficult to justify cen
sorship here in terms of possible
evil effects of the story on read
ers, for the honesty of the presen
tation repels a reader from such
an alternatingly painful and bor
ing existence.
Indeed, "Naked Lunch" prob
ably provides the best available
description of this dreadful way
of life; surely it conveys more to
a non-addict than Burroughs' ear
lier article in the British Journal
of Addiction.
What to Do?
What are we to do with "Na
ked Lunch"? Berate the various
authorities who have branded
this obviously obscene story oh

scone? Road it ourselves, but de
ckle that others should no) soo
it? Agree with tho authorities
that wo had hotter not road it?
Ignore the whole matter?
Probably we now have the host
possible system. By and largo,
only the obviously unacceptable
material gets censored, and even
then censorship is properly hesi
tant. In practice, the uneasy bal
ance between freedom and re
straint is maintained with re
markable success.
< bildren's I-anu llage
Any formulation of principles
might lead to a more rigid and
less mature system. If one had
to formulate rules, however, one
might as well be allowed to use
the language which our society
now permits most children to em
ploy.
One could also suggest that dis
cussions of sex, even homosex
uality (varieties of love), are
probably less evil than discus
sions of violence (varieties of
hate). One might also suggest
that writers able to present self
consistent and honest visions of
places of reality be allowed cer
tain liberties denied to the vast
army of writers who shock only
to sell.
