# Golfers in Loop Match
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity golf team
leaves today for Eugene, Ore.,
and the Pacific Coast Conference
golf championships. Coach Bud
Finger's golfers have achieved an
unbeaten season match play rec
ord.
The main competition for the
Indian linksters will be the USC
Trojans. The Cards defeated the
Trojans last weekend by a score
of lG'ii-lO 1 !;. This defeat ended
a Troy match play consecutive
win streak at 51.
Although the USC team had
two men with lower scores than
any of the Cards, the superior
six-man play of the Indians gave
them the win. In the PCC cham
pionship matches, it is scored on
the best four out of six scores
for each team, rather than all
six, as in match play.
This could be a definite boon
for the Indians who have shown
great depth this season. Even
though the two Trojans do have
the lower score, the other two
men can cause the team score to
skyrocket.
The one disadvantage that the
Indians will have is playing on
the tough and unfamiliar Eugene
course. But they have shown
that they can play on unfamiliar
courses all season, and play well.
