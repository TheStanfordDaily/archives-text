# Spikers to Seattle for PCC Meet
## 
### 
A 13-man Stanford delegation
that could grow as large as 1G
will leave tomorrow for the Pa
cific Coast Conference track
championships Friday and Satur
day in Seattle.
Included in the group are two
men who will be favored in their
events and two others who stand
reasonably good chances to win
in wide-open competition.
In the favorites' roles will be
hop-step-jumper John Kelly and
half-miler Ernie Cunlil'fe. Kelly
stands atop West Coast collegiate
rankings in the triple-jump, and
is among the host in the country.
He'll also be going in the broad
jump, but will have a more diffi
cult time beating men like Dar
rell Horn of Oregon State and
Cebron Russ of Cal.
Blg-gest Challenger
Cal's Jerry Siebert will be Cun
liffe's biggest challenger in the
880. Siebert holds one victory
over the Stanford junior, but the
conditions of that race and a
comparison of other seasonal
marks stamp Cunliffe as the
slight choice.
A pair of weight men, Armand
DeWeese and Jerry Winters, are
in the midst of a group of fairly
equal performers. Don Anaker
of Washington, Duane Milleman
of UCLA and Wayne Crow of
Cal, are all in the low to middle
160's in the discus along with De-
Weese.
Winters, Marlin McKeever of
the Trojans and Steve Frye of
Washington State are within
inches of each other in the shot
put, just shy of the 57-foot mark.
< hesarek in 880
Don Chesarek, who's been a
4 10 man for three years on the
varsity, will move up to the BSO
this week. He's been running ex
cellent legs on Ihe Tribe's two
mile relay team, and figures to
place higher in the half than he
would in the shorter race.
With Chesarek and Dick Las
sen backing up Cunliffe, the 880
is by far the Indians' strongest
event.
Bertil Lundh, Bob Monzingo
and Doug Martin comprise the
rest of ihe distance crew for
Stanford. Lundh will go in the
mile, where he'll be in the thick
of the second-place tangle behind
Jim C.relle of Oregon.
M on /. in go and Martin will
chase Dick Miller of Oregon in
the two-mile, along with a quar
tet of other strong challengers.
Three Sprinters
Three field eventers and
sprinter Norm Pease will com
prise the rest of the contingent.
Harlan Limmer will throw the
discus, Paul Gillespie and high
jump and Jim Backstrand will
throw the javelin.
The three questionables are
quarter-miler Bob Besse, sprinter
Dean Smith and hurdler Bob
Martin. All three failed to post
qualifying marks at San Jose
Saturday, since they didn't show
up to compete. They'll run in
time trials this week, and will
make the trip if performances
warrant.
Lasen, Lundh, Cunliffe and
Chesarek will combine in the
mile relay unless Besse goes, in
which case he'll replace Lundh.

will leave tomorrow for the Pa
cific Coast Conference track
championships Friday and Satur
day in Seattle.
Included in the group are two
men who will be favored in their
events and two others who stand
reasonably good chances to win
in wide-open competition.
In the favorites' roles will be
hop-step-jumper John Kelly and
half-miler Ernie Cunlil'fe. Kelly
stands atop West Coast collegiate
rankings in the triple-jump, and
is among the host in the country.
He'll also be going in the broad
jump, but will have a more diffi
cult time beating men like Dar
rell Horn of Oregon State and
Cebron Russ of Cal.
Blg-gest Challenger
Cal's Jerry Siebert will be Cun
liffe's biggest challenger in the
880. Siebert holds one victory
over the Stanford junior, but the
conditions of that race and a
comparison of other seasonal
marks stamp Cunliffe as the
slight choice.
A pair of weight men, Armand
DeWeese and Jerry Winters, are
in the midst of a group of fairly
equal performers. Don Anaker
of Washington, Duane Milleman
of UCLA and Wayne Crow of
Cal, are all in the low to middle
160's in the discus along with De-
Weese.
Winters, Marlin McKeever of
the Trojans and Steve Frye of
Washington State are within
inches of each other in the shot
put, just shy of the 57-foot mark.
< hesarek in 880
Don Chesarek, who's been a
4 10 man for three years on the
varsity, will move up to the BSO
this week. He's been running ex
cellent legs on Ihe Tribe's two
mile relay team, and figures to
place higher in the half than he
would in the shorter race.
With Chesarek and Dick Las
sen backing up Cunliffe, the 880
is by far the Indians' strongest
event.
Bertil Lundh, Bob Monzingo
and Doug Martin comprise the
rest of ihe distance crew for
Stanford. Lundh will go in the
mile, where he'll be in the thick
of the second-place tangle behind
Jim C.relle of Oregon.
M on /. in go and Martin will
chase Dick Miller of Oregon in
the two-mile, along with a quar
tet of other strong challengers.
Three Sprinters
Three field eventers and
sprinter Norm Pease will com
prise the rest of the contingent.
Harlan Limmer will throw the
discus, Paul Gillespie and high
jump and Jim Backstrand will
throw the javelin.
The three questionables are
quarter-miler Bob Besse, sprinter
Dean Smith and hurdler Bob
Martin. All three failed to post
qualifying marks at San Jose
Saturday, since they didn't show
up to compete. They'll run in
time trials this week, and will
make the trip if performances
warrant.
Lasen, Lundh, Cunliffe and
Chesarek will combine in the
mile relay unless Besse goes, in
which case he'll replace Lundh.
A 13-man Stanford delegation
that could grow as large as 1G
will leave tomorrow for the Pa
