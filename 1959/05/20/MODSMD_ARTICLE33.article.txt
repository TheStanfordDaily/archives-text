The CIBA batting lille is still
very much up for grabs as
league play goes into its final
segment this weekend.
Currently leading the league's
hitters is Lou Leonard, Santa
Clara catcher, who has 18 hits in
39 trips to the plate for a .46;2
average.
The only players with a chance
to catch Leonard are John Wer
has and Len Gabrielson, both of
Southern California. Werhas has
21 hits in 18 at-bats for a .438
mark and Gabrielson has 16 out
of 40 for an even .400.
All three players will be able
to keep a close eye on each other
this weekend as Santa Clara and
SC close out their league action
against each other. The Broncos
are making the trip south this
weekend for games on Friday
and Saturday against the Tro
jans.
Top Indian hitter in the league
is Jim Burk, who is fifth in the
loop with a .350 batting aver
age.
Other top Tribe batsmen are
Joel Newkirk with a .320 mark,
Mike Magee at .311 and Art von
Wronski at .302.
The men of Troy dominate
nearly every other phase of the
statistics. Gabrielson and Wer
has pace the league in rbi's with
19 and 18 respectively.
SC pitchers Bill Thom and
Bruce Gardner have identical 5-0
records to pace the league's hurl
ers.
