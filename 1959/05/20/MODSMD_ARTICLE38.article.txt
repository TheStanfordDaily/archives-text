## 
### Marilyn Moon 
Few persons have seen more
than 6000 women move in and
out of Lagunita Court, but Miss
Elizabeth Crandall, retiring direc
tor of Lagunita, can make this
claim. In her 21 years as direc
tor she has seen the dormitory
hold between 201) and 391 women
each year.
Miss Crandall came to Stan
ford the year Lagunita opened,
1934, to do graduate work in per
sonnel administration, and was I
resident assistant in Magnolia j
Casa. Originally from Cambridge i
Springs, Pa., she received the
A.R. degree from Western He
serve University, Ohio, and had i
worked with the Sir Wilfred
Crmfell Medical Mission in Lab !
rador.
After receiving the M.A. de- j
gree, Miss Crandall taught at ,
Ventura Junior College for one j
year and served as dean ol i
women at the southern branch of j
the University of Idaho for two |
years, returning to Stanford as
director of Lagunita Court in
1938.
llol)l)i('s —JLagunita and Navy
"My current hobbies are the
students of Lagunita and the
Navy," said Miss Crandall.
This latter interest originated
in 1942, when, on a four-year
leave of absence from Stanford,
she was officer in charge of mid
shipmen at the U.S. Navy train
ing school held at Smith College,
and was district director in New
York.
In New York Miss Crandall be
came known for the slogan, "La
dies, use your own good judg
ment!"
"None of us knew much about
the Navy then," she smiled. "The
first day I was directing the
women marching before the cu
rious crowds and I realized 1 was
leading them along the street
straight toward a parked car! I I
didn't know what to say, so 1
just told the leaders, 'Ladies, use ;
your own good judgment!' And
they missed the car!"
Highest Rank
Miss Crandall has held the
rank of commander, highest rank
given to women, since 1946 and
attends weekly reserve meetings
—meetings she calls her "occu
pational therapy," as she is the
only woman present.
Recalling the "hello" tradition

and numerous all-campus social
events of the '30's, Miss Crandall
noted that women didn't date as
much then, and the late leave pol
icy was based on grade poiirt av
erages.
Memories of the '40's are of
blackouts, ration books "each
girl had to bring hers to the
dorm" and Pearl Harbor, "just
before Lagunita Christmas din
