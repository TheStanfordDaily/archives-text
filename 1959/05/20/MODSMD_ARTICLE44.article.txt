# 'Come Join the Band'
## 
### 
The Stanford Band is inviting
all persons interested in playing
with the band next fall to come
to the Band House before pre
registering so that they may see
how the band operates, according
to Harvey Ilundt, 1959 6U band
manager.
Hundt will be at the Band
House today and tomorrow from
3 to 5:30 p.m. The Band House is
located across Arguello Street
from the men's swimming pool.
Band is a one - unit course
which may be taken either for
academic credit or to fulfill the
activity requirement. In the fall,
it is an all-male organization that

plays for all home football games
and travels to Los Angeles to
support the team there at the
Coliseum.
Marching band practices Tues
day and Thursday nights for
about two hours.
Women are eligible to play in
both Symphonic and Concert
Bands during winter and spring
quarters. During autumn quar
ter they help with office and so
cial work for the marching band.
