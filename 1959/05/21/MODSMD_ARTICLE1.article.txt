## 'Strike is Good Idea,'--Bridges 
### Leo Krulitz, Editor 
Harry Bridges, head of the International Longshoremen and
Warehousemen's Union, sharply criticized labor reform legislation
yesterday and said lie personally thought James Hoffa s suggestion
of a national strike if the Kennedy labor bill passes would be a good
idea.
Speaking before a Stanford political science class, Bridges pre-

sented several reasons why he
felt such "reform" legislation
was unnecessary and harmful:
• "It is sponsored by politi
cians and others who claim their
first concern is for the welfare of
the workers." Bridges said he
couldn't accept this, and suggest
ed that "workers iri unions know
what is best for them."
• He said the aim of the legis
lation was to make people honest
and told the large gathering of
students that "this is impossible
to do by law."
• He criticized such legislation
as class legislation and said,
"These laws are now aimed at
punishing the group—not the in
dividual."
• Enough laws are already on
the books to deal with these
things, he said. "If there is a
wrong doing in the labor union
there is a law already against it."
• The real purpose of these la
bor reform bills, he suggested, is
to "undermine the bargaining
power, unity and strength of un
ions."
Appear as Fools
"We've been accused of being
Communistic," Bridges said.
"People have argued that the
government must prevent work
ers from becoming victims of
Communism. This makes the
workers appear as fools."
"The usual procedure is to in
stigate a court case against us,"
he went on. "I've had five trials
and five court decisions in my
favor. I expect more."
Bridges told the class that he
didn't know of a union that was
any more democratic than his
own. He outlined the provisions
in their constitution that safe
guard this - secret ballot elec
tions liberal recall procedures
and high quorums, among others.
Not Much Hope
To questions he commented
that labor wasn't strong enough
in the United States; that he per
sonally favored a labor party but
didn't see much hope of one de
veloping; that "people change -
Hoffa is doing a good job for his
union."
Another questioner asked him
to compare the American work
er to the worker in Russia.
Bridges replied that while he had
visited Russia, lie really hadn't
had enough time to be able to
learn enough to make an accu
rate comparison if such a thing
could be done at all.
No Unemployment
He did say, however, that in
Russia unemployment has been
abolished by law. He said Rus
sian labor leaders told him that
when the next seven-year plan is
completed the Russians will have
the highest living standard in the
world. Workers will only be
working a 30-hour week with a
maximum of 33, wages will have
increased 40 per cent and in some
cases farming, for example
they will have doubled, everyone
will have complete medical care
and a complete, free education.
Bridges said his only comment
was "we'll wait and see." He told
his audience, however, that the
working conditions in Russia had
surpassed those in Europe and
Great Britain with its unemploy
ment, poor housing and long
hours.

Hoffa is doing a good job for his
union."
Another questioner asked him
to compare the American work
er to the worker in Russia.
Bridges replied that while he had
visited Russia, lie really hadn't
had enough time to be able to
learn enough to make an accu
rate comparison if such a thing
could be done at all.
No Unemployment
He did say, however, that in
Russia unemployment has been
abolished by law. He said Rus
sian labor leaders told him that
when the next seven-year plan is
completed the Russians will have
the highest living standard in the
world. Workers will only be
working a 30-hour week with a
maximum of 33, wages will have
increased 40 per cent and in some
cases farming, for example
they will have doubled, everyone
will have complete medical care
and a complete, free education.
Bridges said his only comment
was "we'll wait and see." He told
his audience, however, that the
working conditions in Russia had
surpassed those in Europe and
Great Britain with its unemploy
ment, poor housing and long
hours.
Harry Bridges, head of the International Longshoremen and
Warehousemen's Union, sharply criticized labor reform legislation
yesterday and said lie personally thought James Hoffa s suggestion
of a national strike if the Kennedy labor bill passes would be a good
idea.
Speaking before a Stanford political science class, Bridges pre-

sented several reasons why he
felt such "reform" legislation
was unnecessary and harmful:
• "It is sponsored by politi
cians and others who claim their
first concern is for the welfare of
the workers." Bridges said he
couldn't accept this, and suggest
ed that "workers iri unions know
what is best for them."
• He said the aim of the legis
lation was to make people honest
and told the large gathering of
students that "this is impossible
to do by law."
• He criticized such legislation
as class legislation and said,
"These laws are now aimed at
punishing the group—not the in
dividual."
• Enough laws are already on
the books to deal with these
things, he said. "If there is a
wrong doing in the labor union
there is a law already against it."
• The real purpose of these la
bor reform bills, he suggested, is
to "undermine the bargaining
power, unity and strength of un
ions."
Appear as Fools
"We've been accused of being
Communistic," Bridges said.
"People have argued that the
government must prevent work
ers from becoming victims of
Communism. This makes the
workers appear as fools."
"The usual procedure is to in
stigate a court case against us,"
he went on. "I've had five trials
and five court decisions in my
favor. I expect more."
Bridges told the class that he
didn't know of a union that was
any more democratic than his
own. He outlined the provisions
in their constitution that safe
guard this - secret ballot elec
tions liberal recall procedures
and high quorums, among others.
Not Much Hope
To questions he commented
that labor wasn't strong enough
in the United States; that he per
sonally favored a labor party but
didn't see much hope of one de
veloping; that "people change -
Hoffa is doing a good job for his
union."
