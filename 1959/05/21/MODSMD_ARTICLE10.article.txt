# Project 'M' To Enhance Stanford
## 
### Jack Clumeck 
"What will the Project 'M' lin
ear accelerator do for the Stan
ford community?" This was the
question asked of Dr. Edward L.
Ginzton, who will be intimately
associated with the newly ap
proved project.
Ginzton, head of the Stanford
Microwave Laboratory, said:
"The recent decision to build a
large linear electron accelerator
at Stanford University will great
ly enhance Stanford's position as
a center of nuclear physics re
search.
"When completed, the machine
and its associated laboratories
will be a national facility which
will serve to attract some of the
world's foremost scientists to
Stanford to pursue their research
projects in nuclear physics.
Six Years to Complete
Pending Congressional approv
al, Project "M" will take some
six years to complete. It will be
operated by Stanford under a
contract from the Atomic Energy
Commission. A staff of 750 will
work on tho "Monster," and a $15
million annual budget will be
used to operate the $100 million
machine.
The purpose of Ihc two-mile
j long accelerator will be to bom
bard targets of matter with high
speed electrons, tiny bundles of
negative electricity, which will
race down the accelerator with
nearly the speed of light (186,000
miles per second).
When the electrons are acceler
ated to this extent, they gain in
mass, in accord with Einstein's
theory of relativity. At the tar
get end of the "Monster," tho
mass of each electron will be in
creased 40,000 times, making
projectiles of extremely high en
ergy.
Electrons Will Probe
When the massive and speed
ing electrons hit the target of
matter, they will probe into it
and will "shatter" it, producing
vast quantities of little - under
stood sub-nuclear particles that
have been discovered only recent
ly through the use of smaller
atom - smashers. These short
lived particles exist only for mil
lionths or even billionths of a
second.
This, then, is the purpose of
the multi-million-dollar project to
be bored through the hills in back
of the Stanford campus. To ex
plore the little-known world of
the atom, to produce hitherto
unknown and unimagincd sub
atomic particles, to try to discov
er tho basic "stuff" of which mat<
ter is made.

six years to complete. It will be
operated by Stanford under a
contract from the Atomic Energy
Commission. A staff of 750 will
work on tho "Monster," and a $15
million annual budget will be
used to operate the $100 million
machine.
The purpose of Ihc two-mile
j long accelerator will be to bom
bard targets of matter with high
speed electrons, tiny bundles of
negative electricity, which will
race down the accelerator with
nearly the speed of light (186,000
miles per second).
When the electrons are acceler
ated to this extent, they gain in
mass, in accord with Einstein's
theory of relativity. At the tar
get end of the "Monster," tho
mass of each electron will be in
creased 40,000 times, making
projectiles of extremely high en
ergy.
Electrons Will Probe
When the massive and speed
ing electrons hit the target of
matter, they will probe into it
and will "shatter" it, producing
vast quantities of little - under
stood sub-nuclear particles that
have been discovered only recent
ly through the use of smaller
atom - smashers. These short
lived particles exist only for mil
lionths or even billionths of a
second.
This, then, is the purpose of
the multi-million-dollar project to
be bored through the hills in back
of the Stanford campus. To ex
plore the little-known world of
the atom, to produce hitherto
unknown and unimagincd sub
atomic particles, to try to discov
er tho basic "stuff" of which mat<
ter is made.
"What will the Project 'M' lin
ear accelerator do for the Stan
ford community?" This was the
question asked of Dr. Edward L.
Ginzton, who will be intimately
associated with the newly ap
proved project.
Ginzton, head of the Stanford
Microwave Laboratory, said:
"The recent decision to build a
large linear electron accelerator
at Stanford University will great
ly enhance Stanford's position as
a center of nuclear physics re
search.
"When completed, the machine
and its associated laboratories
will be a national facility which
will serve to attract some of the
world's foremost scientists to
Stanford to pursue their research
projects in nuclear physics.
Six Years to Complete
Pending Congressional approv
al, Project "M" will take some
six years to complete. It will be
operated by Stanford under a
