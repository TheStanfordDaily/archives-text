Shock Treatment

There is building up in this
country a resistance to the for
eign aid appropriations which
must be taken very seriously by
the friends of foreign aid. The
resistance has become especially
formidable in recent times.
This is not only because it is
unpopular to provide money
for foreigners at a time when
at home it is necessary to re
trench on all sorts of desirable
projects. The great new fact is
that the supporters of foreign
aid are so disenchanted with
the existing program that they
cannot advocate il wholeheart
edly.
Senator Mansfield, like Sena
tor Fulbright before him, has
read the signs of the times. He
sees that it foreign aid is to re
main part of our foreign policy,
the program will have to be re
formed.
Bring About Reform
The question is how to bring
about the reform, given the fact
that the mutual aid programs are
involved in a vast military and
civilian bureaucracy, and that
this bureaucracy has acquired a
vested interest which causes it
to oppose serious reforms.
Experience shows that Con
gress has thus far been unable
to overcome the inertia of the
bureaucracy, and in its frustra
tion it is becoming increasingly
exasperated with the whole
business.
It is to this state of affairs that
Senator Mansfield addressed him
self last week. He came forward
with what seemed to me an es
sentially moderate but, neverthe
less, a searching and effective
proposal.
Reexamination
Its object is to compel a thor
oughgoing re-examinaticn in the
Administration of that part of
the foreign aid program which
causes the greatest doubt and dis
content. This is the part provid
ing grants and gifts as distin
guished from loans.
It amounts to about 75 per
cent of the total appropriation.
Here are subsidies to enable
weak countries to maintain
larger military establishments
than their economic life, and
their capacity to raise revenue,
would justify.
Senator Mansfield's proposal
is that an amendment should be
attached to the current foreign
aid bill which "will require, in
the case of nations receiving
grants of defense support or eco
nomic assistance, that the Execu
tive Branch work out in detail
with the recipient nation, and
submit in connection with next
year's aid bill, a detailed plan for
the progressive reduction of
these grants" so as to terminate
them within three years.
The amendment does not say

that direct military aid is to be
terminated in three years. What
it says is that by next year there
must be plans for each country
for reducing the economic aid
which enables it to maintain an
over-sized military establishment.
The plan would show how
the armaments can be reduced
to a size which the country can
digest. We can still supply
arms beyond those which the
country can pay for. We can
still supply arms hut only in
the amount which the country
can take without inflation and
disorder.
The amendment does not say
that all military aid must termi
nate in three years, it says that
the Administration must provide
a plan for terminating it.
Not "Always Done It"
It is implied, and should prob
ably be made clear in the amend
ment, that if no plan to termi
nate it in three years can be
worked out without sacrificing
the national interest, then the
burden of proving tbat this is the
case will be on the Administra
tion. It will not. be able to take
the line that we must go on do
ing what we have always done
Just because we have always
done it.
In atl probability, we shall
find that in certain countries it
is necessary to continue, not
to reduce or to terminate, the
grants or gifts.
But in other countries we may
expect to find that there are over
sized military establishments
which, far from being a defense
against Communism, serve only
to arouse popular discontent, and
that far from being defenses of
liberty are the support of des
pots.
The Mansfield proposal, I
should add, does not touch the
Point Four Program or the De
velopment Loan Fund. These,
we may confidently believe, are
destined to play an even bigger
part in the future than they have
in the past.
Buys Guns
It can be argued that there are
many in Congress who will vote
for foreign aid only if they are
persuaded that it buys guns
aimed directly at Russia or
China. They do not think that
the development of backward
countries is any interest of ours.
Presumably then, this isola
tionist opposition will be less
willing to vote for foreign aid
which emphasizes civilian de
velopment.
As against them, however,
there will be, so I believe, an
ardor and enthusiasm for a new
foreign aid program which is
sadly lacking today for the old
one.

the amount which the country
can take without inflation and
disorder.
The amendment does not say
that all military aid must termi
nate in three years, it says that
the Administration must provide
a plan for terminating it.
Not "Always Done It"
It is implied, and should prob
ably be made clear in the amend
ment, that if no plan to termi
nate it in three years can be
worked out without sacrificing
the national interest, then the
burden of proving tbat this is the
case will be on the Administra
tion. It will not. be able to take
the line that we must go on do
ing what we have always done
Just because we have always
done it.
In atl probability, we shall
find that in certain countries it
is necessary to continue, not
to reduce or to terminate, the
grants or gifts.
But in other countries we may
expect to find that there are over
sized military establishments
which, far from being a defense
against Communism, serve only
to arouse popular discontent, and
that far from being defenses of
liberty are the support of des
pots.
The Mansfield proposal, I
should add, does not touch the
Point Four Program or the De
velopment Loan Fund. These,
we may confidently believe, are
destined to play an even bigger
part in the future than they have
in the past.
Buys Guns
It can be argued that there are
many in Congress who will vote
for foreign aid only if they are
persuaded that it buys guns
aimed directly at Russia or
China. They do not think that
the development of backward
countries is any interest of ours.
Presumably then, this isola
tionist opposition will be less
willing to vote for foreign aid
which emphasizes civilian de
velopment.
As against them, however,
there will be, so I believe, an
ardor and enthusiasm for a new
foreign aid program which is
sadly lacking today for the old
one.

Shock Treatment

There is building up in this
country a resistance to the for
eign aid appropriations which
must be taken very seriously by
the friends of foreign aid. The
resistance has become especially
formidable in recent times.
This is not only because it is
unpopular to provide money
for foreigners at a time when
at home it is necessary to re
trench on all sorts of desirable
projects. The great new fact is
that the supporters of foreign
aid are so disenchanted with
the existing program that they
cannot advocate il wholeheart
edly.
Senator Mansfield, like Sena
tor Fulbright before him, has
read the signs of the times. He
sees that it foreign aid is to re
main part of our foreign policy,
the program will have to be re
formed.
Bring About Reform
The question is how to bring
about the reform, given the fact
that the mutual aid programs are
involved in a vast military and
civilian bureaucracy, and that
this bureaucracy has acquired a
vested interest which causes it
to oppose serious reforms.
Experience shows that Con
gress has thus far been unable
to overcome the inertia of the
bureaucracy, and in its frustra
tion it is becoming increasingly
exasperated with the whole
business.
It is to this state of affairs that
Senator Mansfield addressed him
self last week. He came forward
with what seemed to me an es
sentially moderate but, neverthe
less, a searching and effective
proposal.
Reexamination
Its object is to compel a thor
oughgoing re-examinaticn in the
Administration of that part of
the foreign aid program which
causes the greatest doubt and dis
content. This is the part provid
ing grants and gifts as distin
guished from loans.
It amounts to about 75 per
cent of the total appropriation.
Here are subsidies to enable
weak countries to maintain
larger military establishments
than their economic life, and
their capacity to raise revenue,
would justify.
Senator Mansfield's proposal
is that an amendment should be
attached to the current foreign
aid bill which "will require, in
the case of nations receiving
grants of defense support or eco
nomic assistance, that the Execu
tive Branch work out in detail
with the recipient nation, and
submit in connection with next
year's aid bill, a detailed plan for
the progressive reduction of
these grants" so as to terminate
them within three years.
The amendment does not say

that direct military aid is to be
terminated in three years. What
it says is that by next year there
must be plans for each country
for reducing the economic aid
which enables it to maintain an
over-sized military establishment.
The plan would show how
the armaments can be reduced
to a size which the country can
digest. We can still supply
arms beyond those which the
country can pay for. We can
still supply arms hut only in
the amount which the country
can take without inflation and
disorder.

about the reform, given the fact
that the mutual aid programs are
involved in a vast military and
civilian bureaucracy, and that
this bureaucracy has acquired a
vested interest which causes it
to oppose serious reforms.
Experience shows that Con
gress has thus far been unable
to overcome the inertia of the
bureaucracy, and in its frustra
tion it is becoming increasingly
exasperated with the whole
business.
It is to this state of affairs that
Senator Mansfield addressed him
self last week. He came forward
with what seemed to me an es
sentially moderate but, neverthe
less, a searching and effective
proposal.
Reexamination
Its object is to compel a thor
oughgoing re-examinaticn in the
Administration of that part of
the foreign aid program which
causes the greatest doubt and dis
content. This is the part provid
ing grants and gifts as distin
guished from loans.
It amounts to about 75 per
cent of the total appropriation.
Here are subsidies to enable
weak countries to maintain
larger military establishments
than their economic life, and
their capacity to raise revenue,
would justify.
Senator Mansfield's proposal
is that an amendment should be
attached to the current foreign
aid bill which "will require, in
the case of nations receiving
grants of defense support or eco
nomic assistance, that the Execu
tive Branch work out in detail
with the recipient nation, and
submit in connection with next
year's aid bill, a detailed plan for
the progressive reduction of
these grants" so as to terminate
them within three years.
The amendment does not say

that direct military aid is to be
terminated in three years. What
it says is that by next year there
must be plans for each country
for reducing the economic aid
which enables it to maintain an
over-sized military establishment.
The plan would show how
the armaments can be reduced
to a size which the country can
digest. We can still supply
arms beyond those which the
country can pay for. We can
still supply arms hut only in
the amount which the country
can take without inflation and
disorder.
The amendment does not say
that all military aid must termi
nate in three years, it says that
the Administration must provide
a plan for terminating it.
Not "Always Done It"
It is implied, and should prob
ably be made clear in the amend
ment, that if no plan to termi
nate it in three years can be
worked out without sacrificing
the national interest, then the
burden of proving tbat this is the
case will be on the Administra
tion. It will not. be able to take
the line that we must go on do
ing what we have always done
Just because we have always
done it.
In atl probability, we shall
find that in certain countries it
is necessary to continue, not
to reduce or to terminate, the
grants or gifts.
But in other countries we may
expect to find that there are over
sized military establishments
which, far from being a defense
against Communism, serve only
to arouse popular discontent, and
that far from being defenses of
liberty are the support of des
pots.
The Mansfield proposal, I
should add, does not touch the
Point Four Program or the De
velopment Loan Fund. These,
we may confidently believe, are
destined to play an even bigger
part in the future than they have
in the past.
Buys Guns
It can be argued that there are
many in Congress who will vote
for foreign aid only if they are
persuaded that it buys guns
aimed directly at Russia or
China. They do not think that
the development of backward
countries is any interest of ours.
Presumably then, this isola
tionist opposition will be less
willing to vote for foreign aid
which emphasizes civilian de
velopment.
As against them, however,
there will be, so I believe, an
ardor and enthusiasm for a new
foreign aid program which is
sadly lacking today for the old
one.

Shock Treatment

There is building up in this
country a resistance to the for
eign aid appropriations which
must be taken very seriously by
the friends of foreign aid. The
resistance has become especially
formidable in recent times.
This is not only because it is
unpopular to provide money
for foreigners at a time when
at home it is necessary to re
trench on all sorts of desirable
projects. The great new fact is
that the supporters of foreign
aid are so disenchanted with
the existing program that they
cannot advocate il wholeheart
edly.
Senator Mansfield, like Sena
tor Fulbright before him, has
read the signs of the times. He
sees that it foreign aid is to re
main part of our foreign policy,
the program will have to be re
formed.
