No Finals—Says Wayne State

Wayne State University will
drop Its traditional ten-day final
examination period next fall,
leaving individual teachers the
option of assigning final exams.
Assistant Vice-President of the
University .Robert McCormlck
explained the change as the re
sult of many faculty members
not giving their exams as sched
uled. It would also free students
and faculty members "from the
standardized way of doing
things," he explained.
Ami with our version of
those much-hated exams com
ing up soon, where is the per
soti who isn't jealous of Wayne
University's program?

As of last Friday, students at
the newly remodeled Foothills
Junior College were still mysti
fied as to the whereabouts of their
mascot, a concrete owl nicknamed
"Footsie."

The nickname appeared last De
cember when, during the remodel
ing of the campus, a professor
gave the huge bird. Seeing an op
portunity, a San Jose Mercury-
News reporter dubbed the bird
"Footsie."
Students didn't react to the new
name very well, and two weeks
ago the bird was kidnapped. The
student council has received two
notes from the abductors, the first
requesting that a name for the
owl be decided in the general elec
tion this month.
Student body officers agreed to
hold the election, but demanded
the return of the bird before elec
tion time. The abductors replied
that the bird would be returned
only after it was named.
Luckily, Prince Light foot can't
be so easily abducted, but couldn't
you just hear somebody saying,
"111 there, Prince Lightfootsie!"?
