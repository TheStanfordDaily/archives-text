# Reasons for Joining 'Big Four': Geographic, Better Scheduling

### Dick Barnes Associate Editor 
(Editor's Note: The Pacific
Coast Conference passes from
existence June 30, 1959. What
a th let i c affiliation, if any,
Stanford will make at that
time is a question which has
been drawing considerable in
terest. At present, Stanford's
choice appears to lie principal
ly between joining or not join
ing - the Big Pom —Southern
California, UCLA, California
and Washington. This is the
first of two articles on the
problem; today's outlines rea
sons in favor of joining the Big
Pour; tomorrow's will outline
reasons against joining.)

Reasons for Stanford to join in
athletic alliance with the newly
formed Big Four are easy to find.
Summarized, they say Stanford
should join because it is easier
to carry on an athletic program
within the framework of a league
and because the Big Four is the
best league available.
Taking the second point first,
it is quite apparent that the Big
Four is the best league available.
Geographically, the Big Four is
far advantageous to any group
ing of solely Northwest schools.
Within California, there is no
other league with members of

both comparable si/.e and scho
lastic level to that of Stanford.
But in these areas, the Big Four
—or at least some of them —fill
the bill.
Also present is the advantage
of Stanford's already maintain
ing regular schedules with mem
bers of the Big Four. Joining this
league rather than some other
would permit continuation of
much of tlie present scheduling
and continuation of traditional ri
valries.
The principal advantage in be
ing a member of a league rather
than an independent is ease and
continuity of scheduling. Though
the small size of the Big Four
would still leave more open dates
to fill than is now the case in the
PCC, most sports would still ben
efit from an alliance.
Schedule-wise, basketball most
needs league status. Not only is
it possible to set up a better
schedule, but interest is far
greater with a title at stake than
if each game is an independent
contest.
Sports like track, swimming,
tennis and cross-country gain be
cause of the holding of all-league
championship meet's or tourna
ments.
Stanford, if it joins Ihp Big
Four, can help in retaining at
least one league in the country

which does not abide by Ihp free
ride. The University is commit
ted to a non-free ride policy, and
the Big Four has been estab
lished on such a basis.
Odd as it appears, it is the Big
Four which has kept to the non
free ride and the Northwest
which has gone over to the free
ride. Other schools all over the
nation are looking to Stanford to
see how it will move its support
of the Big Four would erect a
stronger support for non-free
ride than would independence.
To put it another way, by join
ing the Big Four, Stanford would
better be able to exert its influ
ence to retain an organization of
non-free ride schools and attempt
to reintroduce this philosophy
throughout the country.
Other smaller reasons to join
also exist but the principal ones
can be said to be scheduling, ge
ography and support for the non
free ride.

nation are looking to Stanford to
see how it will move its support
of the Big Four would erect a
stronger support for non-free
ride than would independence.
To put it another way, by join
ing the Big Four, Stanford would
better be able to exert its influ
ence to retain an organization of
non-free ride schools and attempt
to reintroduce this philosophy
throughout the country.
Other smaller reasons to join
also exist but the principal ones
can be said to be scheduling, ge
ography and support for the non
free ride.

Coast Conference passes from

Reasons for Stanford to join in
athletic alliance with the newly
formed Big Four are easy to find.
Summarized, they say Stanford
should join because it is easier
to carry on an athletic program
within the framework of a league
and because the Big Four is the
best league available.
Taking the second point first,
it is quite apparent that the Big
Four is the best league available.
Geographically, the Big Four is
far advantageous to any group
ing of solely Northwest schools.
Within California, there is no
other league with members of

both comparable si/.e and scho
lastic level to that of Stanford.
But in these areas, the Big Four
—or at least some of them —fill
the bill.
Also present is the advantage
of Stanford's already maintain
ing regular schedules with mem
bers of the Big Four. Joining this
league rather than some other
would permit continuation of
much of tlie present scheduling
and continuation of traditional ri
valries.
The principal advantage in be
ing a member of a league rather
than an independent is ease and
continuity of scheduling. Though
the small size of the Big Four
would still leave more open dates
to fill than is now the case in the
PCC, most sports would still ben
efit from an alliance.
Schedule-wise, basketball most
needs league status. Not only is
it possible to set up a better
schedule, but interest is far
greater with a title at stake than
if each game is an independent
contest.
Sports like track, swimming,
tennis and cross-country gain be
cause of the holding of all-league
championship meet's or tourna
ments.
Stanford, if it joins Ihp Big
Four, can help in retaining at
least one league in the country

which does not abide by Ihp free
ride. The University is commit
ted to a non-free ride policy, and
the Big Four has been estab
lished on such a basis.
Odd as it appears, it is the Big
Four which has kept to the non
free ride and the Northwest
which has gone over to the free
ride. Other schools all over the
nation are looking to Stanford to
see how it will move its support
of the Big Four would erect a
stronger support for non-free
ride than would independence.
