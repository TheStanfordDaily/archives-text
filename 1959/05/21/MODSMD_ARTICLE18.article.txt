Comprehensive
Editor, The Daily:
Because cf the commonly nc
oepted concept that the best man
tier of discovering Truth is
through questioning College Stu
dents by the use of objective
questionnaires, which, by their
very comprehensive nature, al
low all those who answer to ex
press their exact philosophies, I
have developed a questionnaire
which I believe to be even better!
than the excellent and mature I
one recently published in your
paper.
Since my results are almost
Ibe same as those published in
Wednesday's Daily, J hope that
you may be interested in this, my
contribution to the Truth.
My survey has been thorough,
in that my two roommates, Sid
ney Yakowitz and Darrell Hyder,
are of different interests. Yako
witz is an engineer, whose inter-I
ests, besides creative writing and
contemporary philosophy, are fi- j
uancial. Ilyder is a gentle and
contemplative history major,
whose harmless pursuits include
printing and beer drinking. Yet,
in spite of the vast diversity here
represented, I present unanimous I
answers to all questions.
!. Do you believe that good is
better than evil?
Yes: 2.
No: 0.
si. Do you believe that war is j
unpleasant ?
Yes: 2.
No: 0.
3. Do you believe I hat peace
would be nice?
Yes: 2.
No: 0.
Sir, 1 submit that with more of
these soul - searching question
naires, we will soon have arrived
at the Truth.
