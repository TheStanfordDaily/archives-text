The Curtain Falls
PCC track has its last carnival this weekend and il seems too
bad that such an annually good meet has to come to an end. I Jut at
least il can be said that the PCC championships are ringing down the
curtain with an outstanding show.
There's no doubt, of course, that USC will, walk off with the team
title, But as far as individual events go, ft's almost sheer folly to
try and pick much more than Charlie Dumas in the high jump and
•lim Civile in the mile.
Regardless id' folly, however, here goes on an event-by-event
rough dope sheet of how the running, jumping and throwing stack
up. Selections are necessarily rough because of uncertainty of en
tries and weather conditions.
In the 100, we'll go with Koscoe Cook over Willie White, Steve
Anderson third. Norm Pease fourth and perhaps Don .Maw of WSC
fifth. Cook had a 9.5 here, probably won't get that low at Seattle,
but should beat While, who hasn't had such a hot year.
Hobby Staten should take the 220 with White again second. Look
for Pease to move up to third, with Cook dropping to fourth and
.Maw again fifth. Staten has a tremendous finishing kick in both tin 4
22(» and quarter, and will probably catch White at about 200 yards.
That Staten kick should sew up the quarter over Jack Yermaii.
Terry Tohacco will he third after winning for two straight years,
with Otis Davis fourth and Doug Julian of UCLA or Hon Kott of Cal
in for the fifth.
We have to go along with Ernie Cunliffe over Jerry Siebert in
the half, but the race should be tremendous. Surprising Don Chesa
rek is a hunch pick for third ahead of Tom Anderson, and Dick Las
sen can make it nine points for the Tribe with a fifth.
(•relic's easy in the mile, but behind him things are rougher.
Slicking with Bob Sbankland's win over Bertil Lundli here, we'll
pick them 2.'! and lei the Larsons have 4-5 Jack of Washington and
(•eorge of Oregon, that is.
The three-mile is hard to dope, since the boys have gone in the
two-mile all year. Set figuring they'll move up at about the same
relative standings, we'll take Dirk Miller of Oregon, Alan (iaylord,
Frank Wyatt of Idaho, Bob Monzingo and .Mark Bobbins of ihe
Ducks.
Hurdlewise, Walt Arlt is the slim choice in both races. He should
11 ill Ken Thompson, Dave Ldstrom, Charlie Dumas and James John
son and we'll say in that order.
In Ihe lows, it's Arlt over Steve Anderson with White third.
Cehron liuss and Ken Thompson will fight for the fourth, and we'll
say Thompson.
(»cl i hil V our I lals
Most of the field events might just as well have the names drawn
out of a hal. So doing a veritable drawing, Ihe discus will come out
Duune Milleman of I ( I.A, Armand DeWeese, Wayne Crow of Cal,
Don Anaker ot Washington and Bob Sbordoiie of IJSC.
The high jump isn't quite so impossible, with Dumas an almost
sure winner. Behind him, it looks like N'agalingam Ethirveerasing
ham and Wayne Moss tied for second, Walt Torrence fourth, and
Dick Dailey and Paul (Jillespic tied for fifth.
We can't help but string along with John Kelly in the broad jump
over Cehron Knss and inconsistent Darrell Horn. Steve Anderson is
picked for fourth, but could win. Bill Jackson of CSC looks like a
Marlin McKeever of CSC seems to be the steadiest shot-putter,
so he gets Ihe riod. Steve Frye will beat Jerry Winters for second
unless the latter snaps out of his slump. Bert Bender of WSC should
nip Clark Branson of UCLA for fourth.
I). ( . Mills didn't compete in the Northern Division meet last
week, but figuring he'll be back, he should win the javelin over Mike
I'age of the Trojans. Dick Kubenser of WSC, Shordonc, and John
Douglas of Washington should go 3-4-5 on a basis of previous marks.
And then there's the pole vault, where nine men are between
1 M0 1 - and 1 1-2'and there's not a consistent one in the lot. Clutch
ing at straws, it looks like (ieorge Hon ban is and Phil Paquin tied
foi first, with Bill Logan, Frnie Bollard, Jim Brewer and Jack Burg
in a third-place deadlock.
In the relav, we'll say USC, Cal, Stanford, Washington and lICLA.
