frame and coasted home the win
ner in an 110 rout over the San
Francisco Presidio.

Roy Lawson started for Stan
ford. giving up two hits and no
runs in a neat three-inning stint.
Terry Lindeman took over for
the stocky right -bander in the
fourth and held tho Presidio nine
hit less for three innings. Warren
Nelson finished up the game
twirling one-hit b;ill over the fi
nal three frames.
Big Lee Moench, sometimes
first baseman and sometimes out
fielder, was the hitting star for

the Indians along with full-time
first baseman Joel Newkirk and
catcher-outfielder Art von YVron
ski.
Moench pounded out three hits
in three official trips to the plate
and knocked home one of Stan
ford's early runs. N'ewkirk
knocked in two runs with two
singles in three trips and Von
Wronski's second hit of the day,
an eighth-inning single, sent two
runs across the plate.
Stanford captain Rich DeFabio
barely missed an inside the park
home run when he was thrown
out at the plate trying to score
on liis line drive triple to left cen
ter in the eighth. DeFabio's blast
climaxed the four-run inning.
