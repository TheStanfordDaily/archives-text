# New Marks at Seattle?
## DAILY Sports SCENE 
### 
Eight moot records will be in
varying degrees id' clangor tomor
row and Saluiday when athletes
from nine schools gather tor the
last Pacific Coast Conference
track and field championships of
all time al Seattle.
The list of PCC meet marks is
imposing and there are several
which won't come near being
I hreatened.
Standards in Iho high jump
and broad jump have the besl
chance to fall. Charley Dumas,
of course, is the only man with a
shot at Ernie Shell oil's four
year-old record of (MO. Dumas
jumped seven feet at Fresno two
weeks ago, and should be able to
add at least a fraction to the (>-10
mark.
If the broad jump record falls,
it will be the result of fierce
competition among a group of

outstanding 1 capers. The prese
ont standard is an even 25 feel,
and is among Ihe most durable
of PCC marks.
Jackie Robinson, I hen at UCLA
and later with Ihe Brooklyn
Dodgers, made Ihe jump in 1910.
Darrell Horn of Oregon Slate,
a surprising sophomore who has
clone 25-5'4, rates as a slight fa
vorite over John Kelly of Stan
lord and Cehron Russ of Cal.
Russ has gone 25-1, more than
three inches better than Kelly,

I but has lost to Ihe Stanford star
in their three meetings.
There's an outside chance that
Rafer Johnson's year old javelin
mark of 21.'M(i'- might lie wiped
j from Ihe books. I>. C. Mills of
Oregon has thrown 243 10, arid
Mike Page of USC 212 3.
Bobby Stalen of USC has a
shot at Ihe 21.0 220 record sel
; 32 years ago he has a 20.9 best
on the season. Willie White and
.lack Yerman of Cal and Norm
Pease of Stanford, all with 21,0's
in Big Meet, could gel the record
as well.
Walt Aril of WSC and Steve
Anderson each have 23.1's to
their credit in the lows the
same as Dick Aitlesey ran in
1950.
USC, with a 3:12.S lo its cred-
I it, could easily knock live-tenths
I off to get at Washington State's

.1:12 3 meel mark, ret 22 year o
afto.
The records sure to bo estab
lished arc in tho hop-slop jump
and three-mile mainly because
the events have never heen held
before in this meet. The three
mile replaces the two-mile.
Thissiiine, Hie JVC has fol
lowed NCAA practice of building
up interest and competition in
Olympic events, so added them
to the program. Kelly looks like
the class of the hop-step field
with his 1!)- 1 1, and Oregon's Dick
Miller is favored in the 12-lapper.
The other records:
.Mile, 4:03.7, Bowden, Pal, 1958.
440, 40. I, Klemmer, ("a 1, 1!) 11.
100, 9.5, Graffio, USC, 1954.
