# Medieval Setting Tonight For 'Count Ory' Opening
## Stanford Opera Theater To Hold West Coast Premiere 
### Mary Lou Mckinley 
Unique stage settings and lighting effects, flamboyant costumes,
and a cast of experienced singers promise to transform Dinkclspiel
Auditorium into a medieval countryside this evening when the Stan
ford Opera Theater presents the first performance of "Count Ory"
for its West Coast premiere.
The Rossini comic opera will run for six performances in two

three-night runs, May 21 23 and '
28 30.
"The Count Ory," originally
written for the Paris Opera
House in 1828, has seldom been ;
presented in modern times, com
ing back into modern repertory
two years ago at the Glynde
bourne Music Festival in Eng
land.
The story takes place around
the Castle of Formoutier, near
Turrena, at the time of the Cru
sades, and concerns a philander
ing ne'er-do-well, Count Ory, who
escapes his watchful father and
runs off to the countryside to
enjoy life and love disguised as
a cure-all hermit.
The Countess Adole takes the
hermit's advice to "fall in love,
then fall in love all over again,"
and becomes attracted to Isolier,
a page, to the consternation of
Ory.
Complications
Tho appearance of gray-clad
pilgrims and returning crusaders
further complicates the situation,
and the opera continues on its
hilarious way.
Frederic Cohen, who is oper
atic stage director of the Juil
liard School of Music in New
York, is directing the production,
with his wife as theatrical coach.
Starring in the title role will
be Howard Sutherland, who has
appeared in many Bay Area op
eras and is tenor soloist at the
Palo Alto First Baptist Church.
His background experience also
includes choir directing, concert
appearances and recordings.
Television Performer
In the role of the Countess
Adele is Marni Nixon, who, along
with considerable light opera ex-1
perience, has appeared as an ac
tress and singer on national tele
vision shows, "dubs" movie
sound tracks and is a featured
singer for several leading record
companies.
Raimbaud, Count Ory's friend,
will be played by Winther Ander
son; Isolier, by Margot Blum;
the c o u nt e s s ' companion Ra
gonde, by Stanford graduate Jan
is Wilcox; and the tutor hunting
for the errant son, by Edwin Dun
ning.
A chorus of peasants, crusad
ers and pilgrims will be com
posed of Stanford students who
have been directed by Professor
Harold C. Schmidt. The augment
ed Stanford Symphony Orches
tra will be conducted by Profes
sor Sandor Salgo.
Because Dinkelspiel's 56-feet
widc, '10-feet deep stage is engi
neered with the proscenium, the
usual framing wall, all scenery
must be portable from the sides.
The castle architecture, there
fore, is contrived on big-wheeled
platforms which arc easily mov
able into the wings for the sec
ond act's courtyard scene.
Multi-visibility
Frederick Rider of Carmel has
designed both the sets and light
ing for the production. Both
have had to be conceived with
multi-visibility in mind, the au
dience being able to see every
thing behind the curtain on the
Dinkelspiel stage.
The opera offers opportunities
for many different kitvls of light-1
ing with a day scene, a night j
scene, a storm scene and a dawn
scene.
Scenery for "The Count Ory" j
has ben kepi neutral in color to
provide a complementary back i
ground for the bright-hued cos
tumes, loaned for (he production
by the Juilliard School of Music. ,
Tickets continue on sale this I
week and next at the Dinkelspiel '
Auditorium box office weekday !
afternoons. Center seats are
priced at $2.75, side seats for the
public at $2.23 and for students,

"COUNT ORY" OPENS AT DINKELSPIEL TONIGHT
Marni Nixon and Janis Wilcox sing comic opera at rehearsal
Unique stage settings and lighting effects, flamboyant costumes,
and a cast of experienced singers promise to transform Dinkclspiel
Auditorium into a medieval countryside this evening when the Stan
ford Opera Theater presents the first performance of "Count Ory"
for its West Coast premiere.
The Rossini comic opera will run for six performances in two

three-night runs, May 21 23 and '
28 30.
"The Count Ory," originally
written for the Paris Opera
House in 1828, has seldom been ;
presented in modern times, com
ing back into modern repertory
two years ago at the Glynde
bourne Music Festival in Eng
land.
The story takes place around
the Castle of Formoutier, near
Turrena, at the time of the Cru
sades, and concerns a philander
ing ne'er-do-well, Count Ory, who
escapes his watchful father and
runs off to the countryside to
enjoy life and love disguised as
a cure-all hermit.
The Countess Adole takes the
hermit's advice to "fall in love,
then fall in love all over again,"
and becomes attracted to Isolier,
a page, to the consternation of
Ory.
Complications
Tho appearance of gray-clad
pilgrims and returning crusaders
further complicates the situation,
and the opera continues on its
hilarious way.
Frederic Cohen, who is oper
atic stage director of the Juil
liard School of Music in New
York, is directing the production,
with his wife as theatrical coach.
Starring in the title role will
be Howard Sutherland, who has
appeared in many Bay Area op
eras and is tenor soloist at the
Palo Alto First Baptist Church.
His background experience also
includes choir directing, concert
appearances and recordings.
Television Performer
In the role of the Countess
Adele is Marni Nixon, who, along
with considerable light opera ex-1
perience, has appeared as an ac
tress and singer on national tele
vision shows, "dubs" movie
sound tracks and is a featured
singer for several leading record
companies.
Raimbaud, Count Ory's friend,
will be played by Winther Ander
son; Isolier, by Margot Blum;
the c o u nt e s s ' companion Ra
gonde, by Stanford graduate Jan
is Wilcox; and the tutor hunting
for the errant son, by Edwin Dun
ning.
A chorus of peasants, crusad
ers and pilgrims will be com
posed of Stanford students who
have been directed by Professor
Harold C. Schmidt. The augment
ed Stanford Symphony Orches
tra will be conducted by Profes
sor Sandor Salgo.
Because Dinkelspiel's 56-feet
widc, '10-feet deep stage is engi
neered with the proscenium, the
usual framing wall, all scenery
must be portable from the sides.
The castle architecture, there
fore, is contrived on big-wheeled
platforms which arc easily mov
able into the wings for the sec
ond act's courtyard scene.
Multi-visibility
Frederick Rider of Carmel has
designed both the sets and light
ing for the production. Both
have had to be conceived with
multi-visibility in mind, the au
dience being able to see every
thing behind the curtain on the
Dinkelspiel stage.
The opera offers opportunities
for many different kitvls of light-1

"COUNT ORY" OPENS AT DINKELSPIEL TONIGHT
Marni Nixon and Janis Wilcox sing comic opera at rehearsal
Unique stage settings and lighting effects, flamboyant costumes,
and a cast of experienced singers promise to transform Dinkclspiel
Auditorium into a medieval countryside this evening when the Stan
ford Opera Theater presents the first performance of "Count Ory"
for its West Coast premiere.
The Rossini comic opera will run for six performances in two

three-night runs, May 21 23 and '
28 30.
"The Count Ory," originally
written for the Paris Opera
House in 1828, has seldom been ;
presented in modern times, com
ing back into modern repertory
two years ago at the Glynde
bourne Music Festival in Eng
land.
The story takes place around
the Castle of Formoutier, near
Turrena, at the time of the Cru
sades, and concerns a philander
ing ne'er-do-well, Count Ory, who
escapes his watchful father and
runs off to the countryside to
enjoy life and love disguised as
a cure-all hermit.
The Countess Adole takes the
hermit's advice to "fall in love,
then fall in love all over again,"
and becomes attracted to Isolier,
a page, to the consternation of
Ory.
Complications
Tho appearance of gray-clad
pilgrims and returning crusaders
further complicates the situation,
and the opera continues on its
hilarious way.
Frederic Cohen, who is oper
atic stage director of the Juil
liard School of Music in New
York, is directing the production,
with his wife as theatrical coach.
Starring in the title role will
be Howard Sutherland, who has
appeared in many Bay Area op
eras and is tenor soloist at the
Palo Alto First Baptist Church.
His background experience also
includes choir directing, concert
appearances and recordings.
Television Performer
In the role of the Countess
Adele is Marni Nixon, who, along
with considerable light opera ex-1
perience, has appeared as an ac
tress and singer on national tele
vision shows, "dubs" movie
sound tracks and is a featured
singer for several leading record
companies.
Raimbaud, Count Ory's friend,
will be played by Winther Ander
son; Isolier, by Margot Blum;
the c o u nt e s s ' companion Ra
gonde, by Stanford graduate Jan
is Wilcox; and the tutor hunting
for the errant son, by Edwin Dun
ning.
A chorus of peasants, crusad
ers and pilgrims will be com
posed of Stanford students who
have been directed by Professor
Harold C. Schmidt. The augment
ed Stanford Symphony Orches
tra will be conducted by Profes
sor Sandor Salgo.
Because Dinkelspiel's 56-feet
widc, '10-feet deep stage is engi
