### 
GFJNFJVA (/P)—ln a crisp two
minute speech U.S. Secretary of
Stale Christian A. lierter admon
ished the Soviet Union Thursday
to slop accusing Ihe West of pre
paring for an aggressive war.
He warned Soviet Foreign Min
ister Andrei Gromyko that such
accusations can lead to serious
tensions in the Big Four foreign
ministers' conference.
Soviet allegations of aggres
sive aims by the North Atlantic
Alliance and the West German
government simply are not true,
Herter declared.
"Prudent Precaution"
Facing Gromyko across the
table, Herter said all the steps
taken by the Western powers in
the last 10 years were dictated by
"prudent precaution."
The Secretary of State was ob
viously annoyed at the charges
bandied about, in the conference
by both Gromyko and East Ger
man Foreign Minister Lothar
Bolz.
Herter's intervention highlight
ed the ninth conference session,
which was largely given over to
arguments by East and West in
favor of their conflicting plans
for Germany.
Preparing for Aggression
Gromyko, as in several recent
sessions, made accusations that
the North Atlantic Alliance is
preparing for aggression and
that West Germany is militarily
aggressive and is rearming for
purposes of revenge.
An American spokesman said
Herter decided lie could not let
these charges go unanswered
any longer.
A short time later he was host
to Gromyko at a dinner party
also attended bv Selwyn Lloyd
and Maurice Couve de Murville,
the British and French foreign
ministers.
From these exchanges careful
proddings could develop on such
specific: problems as the status of
Berlin and the Western terms for
going to the summit.
Also, from such exchanges the
conference might hope to break
out of the pattern of sterile de
bates with and West argu
ing in favor of their packagc
plans for Germany.

arguments by East and West in
favor of their conflicting plans
for Germany.
Preparing for Aggression
Gromyko, as in several recent
sessions, made accusations that
the North Atlantic Alliance is
preparing for aggression and
that West Germany is militarily
aggressive and is rearming for
purposes of revenge.
An American spokesman said
Herter decided lie could not let
these charges go unanswered
any longer.
A short time later he was host
to Gromyko at a dinner party
also attended bv Selwyn Lloyd
and Maurice Couve de Murville,
the British and French foreign
ministers.
From these exchanges careful
proddings could develop on such
specific: problems as the status of
Berlin and the Western terms for
going to the summit.
Also, from such exchanges the
conference might hope to break
out of the pattern of sterile de
bates with and West argu
ing in favor of their packagc
plans for Germany.
