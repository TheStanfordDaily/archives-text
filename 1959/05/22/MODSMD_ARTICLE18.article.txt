# Russian House— A Prized Experiment
## 
### 
An iMPOHTAivr km-krivji NT in the learning of foreign language*
will he conducted at Stanford this summer in the lorm ol the
co-educational Russian House.
For ten weeks, interested students will literally eat, speak and
breath Russian, three hours, five days a week will he spent in
the classroom. In the Russian House, where all those taking the
intensive Russian course will live, mostly Russian will he spoken.
Everything will he labeled with its Russian name; a Russian
cook, Mrs. M. Solovskoy, will prepare her native cuisine; and there
also will he two other native Russians in the house, a student and
the directoress, Mrs. Anne Schuller.
Olio, of the most important objectives of the program
trill be to give the students a background in conversation
of modern Russian usage. Regularly conducted laifguagi'
coursfs here do not < 01110 close to providing an adeipiale
conversational background. Iho Russian House set up
may correct this deficiency. .
The program is to supplement the regular University course
and make it more meaningful.
Rv living and working together a more motivated and stimu
lating atmosphere may be created which will help the students
obtain the most possible from the course.
The program was student originated and supported. Ihe ail
ministration deserves much credit for the support and help it has
provided for the project. The Russian House will be the first such
bouse in this part of the country to the knowledge of originators
Jim Morrison and Jerry Hirscb. Such houses exist in the Mid West
but are predominantly for teachers.
Commendations are in order to students and admin
istrators who have worked to make the house possible.
There is no reason why Stanford should not become the
language center of the. West Coast. It is located ad van•
tageously; has the qualified faculty; and ilte prestige to
do so.
Since the University is becoming more and more of a national
science center and will continue to proceed in this direction with
the commencement of Project M and the new Medical School, it
must be careful not to neglect other fields and see that they develop
at an equal rate so that the University will remain in academic
balance.
President Wallace Sterling has indicated an awareness of this
problem in his speech at the alumni conference last week. It is
projects such as the Russian House and Foreign Branches of the
University which may aid in securing—in a small way, at least, a
future balance. Vie hope projects such as these might be ex
panded and we will be watching with great interest the develop
ments ami results of this summer's Russian House experiment.

panded and we will be watching with great interest the develop
ments ami results of this summer's Russian House experiment.
An iMPOHTAivr km-krivji NT in the learning of foreign language*
will he conducted at Stanford this summer in the lorm ol the
co-educational Russian House.
For ten weeks, interested students will literally eat, speak and
breath Russian, three hours, five days a week will he spent in
the classroom. In the Russian House, where all those taking the
intensive Russian course will live, mostly Russian will he spoken.
Everything will he labeled with its Russian name; a Russian
cook, Mrs. M. Solovskoy, will prepare her native cuisine; and there
also will he two other native Russians in the house, a student and
the directoress, Mrs. Anne Schuller.
Olio, of the most important objectives of the program
trill be to give the students a background in conversation
of modern Russian usage. Regularly conducted laifguagi'
coursfs here do not < 01110 close to providing an adeipiale
conversational background. Iho Russian House set up
may correct this deficiency. .
The program is to supplement the regular University course
and make it more meaningful.
Rv living and working together a more motivated and stimu
lating atmosphere may be created which will help the students
obtain the most possible from the course.
The program was student originated and supported. Ihe ail
ministration deserves much credit for the support and help it has
provided for the project. The Russian House will be the first such
bouse in this part of the country to the knowledge of originators
Jim Morrison and Jerry Hirscb. Such houses exist in the Mid West
but are predominantly for teachers.
Commendations are in order to students and admin
istrators who have worked to make the house possible.
There is no reason why Stanford should not become the
language center of the. West Coast. It is located ad van•
tageously; has the qualified faculty; and ilte prestige to
do so.
Since the University is becoming more and more of a national
science center and will continue to proceed in this direction with
the commencement of Project M and the new Medical School, it
must be careful not to neglect other fields and see that they develop
at an equal rate so that the University will remain in academic
balance.
President Wallace Sterling has indicated an awareness of this
problem in his speech at the alumni conference last week. It is
projects such as the Russian House and Foreign Branches of the
University which may aid in securing—in a small way, at least, a
future balance. Vie hope projects such as these might be ex
panded and we will be watching with great interest the develop
ments ami results of this summer's Russian House experiment.
