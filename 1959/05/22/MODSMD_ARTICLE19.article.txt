# THE
						COCKTAIL PARTY'
## Players Bring Out 'Dramatic Potential' 
### Jerome W. Clinton 
T. S. Eliot's "The Cocktail Par
ty" is a drama of a man's search
for spiritual salvation. But as
such it is more a situation com
edy than a tragedy, for the play
derives its unity from Eliot's at
tempt to place all men in some
universal perspective, not simply
to trace the struggle on a single
hero's search for understanding.
In Eliot's terms, the world is a
cocktail party, a moral vacuum
in which both man and saint are
trapped, and in which they ap
peal* ludicrous, isolated and
vaguely sinful.
The Search
When forced by chance circum
stance to recognize their condi
tion, it becomes, itself; the stim
ulus for a search for some way
out. They are assisted in this
search by supernatural "Guard
ians" who appear to them in the
guise of men.
The solution for man is to
learn to choose his trap, making
the best of a bad situation, while
the saint may seek something
more, the way of faith.
Annoying
In many respects it is a very
annoying play. Much of the sym
bolism is well and obviously em
ployed, as the cocktail party it
self. Yet elsewhere the symbol
ism appears to be mere trickery,
no more honest than a medium's
table rapping.
The role of the Guardians is
never made clear. They are su
perhuman in their understand
ing. yet subject to human fallibil
ity in their actions. It is never
clear just where Eliot's ortho
doxy is intended seriously, and
where ironically.

And the second act, the most ;
straightforward of the three, is!
also the least convincing. Yet it |
is a thoroughly compelling dra- j
ma, brilliantly written for all the ;
seeming inconsistencies of Eliot's :
philosophy.
Very Successful
The production given it by the
Stanford Players could hardly be ;
more successful in bringing out,
this dramatic potential. The set
ting, by being neither wholly
realistic nor entirely suggestive,
is perfectly designed to empha
size the interrelation of both the ,
allegorical and human functions j
of the characters.
Wismer's brisk but naturally
paced direction lends the play an
added degree of unity, and so
clarity.
Professional Competence
The acting is all of unquest
ionably professional competence.
Philip Schulz is particularly im-;
pressive as the weak, altogether j
too human Edward Chamber-;
layne. And Celia Howard does a j
convincing job as his wile and .
feminine counterpart.
Julia Vurtis, as the saint, acts i
with a simplicity and childlike di
rectness that appears truly Chris
tian. Kathleen Duffy, Jack Gia
nino and Timothy Haggerty play
the varied and teasingly ambigu
ous roles of Guardians with suf
ficient insight that they almost
appear clear, and Joseph Plum
mer makes a fine earnest young
Peter Quilpe.
An added, and by no means in- j
considerable, attraction to this
otherwise excellent performance !
is that it was given in the Little
Theater, where one could see and
hear with ease.
