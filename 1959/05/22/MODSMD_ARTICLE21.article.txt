Tribute to Code
Editor, The Daily:
The original ropy of the on
closed letter was posted this
morning on the bulletin board of
the Business School.
"Yes, it's true that there are
several universities and colleges
listed in this dictionary, but still
I choose Stanford. It's because 1
like Stanford.
"Our professor once said that
what he observed among your
students is that their being hon
est."
Her English may not be per
fect; neither is the working of
our Code. But what a tribute this
letter is to the Code, and what
a justification to light for the
Code as long as there is a Stan
ford.
One of our instructors in the
Business School, Mr. Charles An
derson, is a member of t he busi
ness community. He comes to
the campus twice a week to teach
a course called "Business Pol
icy."
The last time the class met, Mr.
Anderson said that "most of you
who leave ihe campus have just
one thing to sell, really. Your in
tegrity."
If most people feel as he does
—in any walk of life for which
we students are preparing—then
it would seem that you and 1
picked the right place to go to
school where an Honor Code is
seldom preached, but practiced
very well.

'I Like Stanford'
Editor, The Daily:
With the help of my dictionary,
I was able to get the address of
your school. Yes, it's true that
there are several universities and
colleges listed in this dictionary,
but still I choose Stanford. It's
because I like Stanford.

Our professor once said that
what he observed among youi
students is that their being hon
est. lie studied there for a yeai
1 think, and took up manage
ment courses. His name is Mr.
Metodio Ganuelas. He's back and
at present teaching ar the Uni
versity of the Philippines.
Needless to say sir, my main
purpose in writing this letter is
io respectfully request you for
pen-pals. How I loved very much
to have many acquaintances. I'm
a girl of 21, studying at the Uni
versity of the Philippines some
times called the State U; fourth
year college of Business Adminis
tration.
I'll be doubly grateful if you
could please post my letter in one
t>f your bulletin boards there. 1
WELCOME EVERYBODY.
Young or old, rich or poor. I
promise to answer all their let
ters.

Blacklisted
Editor, The Daily:
A letter submitted by my room
mate yesterday quoted me as
agreeing with the statement,
"Good is belter than evil." On
later reflection, I have decided to
nullify this assertion. I fear that
my name may be blacklisted by
the AEC security agencies, thus
endangering my earning poten
tial. Sidney Yakowitz
