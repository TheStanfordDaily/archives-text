# Equivalent Athletic Philosophy Not Assured by Conference
## 
### Dick Barnes Associate Editor 
(Killtor's Note: This is the
second of two articles discuss
ing Stanford and the Bit; Four
athletic conference. Yesterday,
reasons for joining' were out
lined; today, reasons for not
joining are presented.)

Tho principal reason to be of
fered against Stanford's joining
the Big Four of UCLA, Southern
California, California and Wash
ington is simply that there is no
assurance of an eye-to-eye ath
letic philosophy.
It is true that the Big Four is
committed to a policy of non-free
ride, but this leaves many open
doors in such areas as recruiting
and aid to athletes.
Not ('aim
Events since the formation of
the Big Four indicate that all is
not well either at the schools or
among them. USC was handed
more penalties by the NCAA; a
IJCLA coach broke into the of
fice of a Cal coach, charging ille
gal recruiting. The sea, in short,

does not appear calm.
Then, too, there is the reason
that from present indications,
Stanford is going to be able to
derive most of the benefits of
membership in the Big Font
without ever having to join.
It appears that competition in
most sports will continue among
Stanford and the other California
schools, at least. It would not lie
economically feasible to sever re
lations, especially in football,
where big income is a necessity
to carrying on a normal athletic
program.
Continue Scheduling
In other sports, too, various ar
rangements are being made
among some or all schools of the
PCC to continue scheduling of
events.
It has been said that Stanford

must join the nig Four simply
because of ltose Bowl revenue in
volved. This is not the case.
If Stanford should remain in
dependent, it would have a yearly
chance to send teams to any of
several other bowls if teams are
good enough and would get a
full share instead of a one-fifth
share of revenue.
Observe Direction
By remaining free of Big Pour
and other league- ties, Stan
ford would be able to best ob
serve the direction in which the
Big Four moves.
II tiiis direction is favorable to
Stanford, then it could eventually
join. If not favorable, then there
are no entangling alliances and a
break in relations will not result
in the destruction of yet another
conference.
