Thorn will bo pressure a-plenty
in the air at Stanford's Sunken
Diamond tomorrow when the sec
ond-place Indians close their reg
ular season against the one-game
bohind third placers from Cali
fornia at 2:30 p.m.
The outcome of the season's
fourth and last "Big" baseball
tilt will have a direct effect on
the final standings of the CIBA
league race. Currently Stanford
is in second place with a nine
and six record, one game ahead
of the third - place Californians
who have rolled up an eight-and
soven record on the year.
Undisputed Second Place
If the Indians defeat the Bears,
as they have done in two of the
first three meetings between the
teams, then they will take undis
puted hold on second place for
the 1959 season. If Cal wins, how
ever, the two teams will finish
in a dead heat for second and the
possibility of playoff will exist.
Originally, there was to be an
other game played Saturday if
the Bears won the regular game
but that idea has been aban
doned.
Southern California with its
12-and-two record has already
taken the league title and ap
pears to be the southern repre
sentative to the PCC playoffs on
May 29 and .'-51). Since IJSC is in
eligible for NCAA play there has
as yet been no definite procedure
announced for deciding the con
ference representative to the Na
tional Championships. For this
reason .second place in the South
em Division still may prove an
important spot.
ItnssHl to Pitch
Stanford's pitching assignment
for this Big (Jaime has gone to
sophomore Karl Russell. The hip
right-hander has been the most
consistent of Stanford Coach
Dutch Fehring's starters. Bus
sell has compiled a I 1 record on
the year in CIBA play.

Russell will be hacked up in |
I lie bullpen by Warren Nelson
who already (his year' has picked
up two wins over California, hav
ing relieved in both of Stanford's
earlier victories over the Rears,
and ace southpaws Terry Linde
man and Marv Mecklenherg.
California figures to counter!
