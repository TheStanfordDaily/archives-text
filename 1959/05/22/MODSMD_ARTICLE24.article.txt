# Linksmen Vie In PCC Match
## 
### 
S t a n f o j- d ' s undefeated golf
team will he out to snare this
year's PCC championship when
all the conference teams meet at
Fugone, Ore., for the season's
final golf tourney this weekend.
The pro-tourney favorites are
the Indians and the USC Tro
jans. Stanford's six-man team of
Ron Preston, Woodgie Reich, Bob
Snelling, Kent Winton, Bernie
Magnussen and Jack Lamey has
probably the best depth in the
conference.
USC, led by the conference's
number one golfer A1 Geiberger,
will lie attempting to defend the
crown it won last year as the
league's golf masters.
Oregon, with the home course
advantage and led by Keith Gu
brud, runner-up in the Oregon
Amateur, will also be tough.
The scores of each team's top
four men are counted toward the
title decision and this system
gives Stanford with its superior
depth a slight edge.
