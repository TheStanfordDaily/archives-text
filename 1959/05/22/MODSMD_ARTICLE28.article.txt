on Pacific Coast C o ri 1 c r e nc e
track and field today and tomor
row. The occasion tho league's
291 hand last championship meet,
this year in Seattle.
USC, the team that didn't win
a meet until 1936, hut has since
won 17. is Ihe odds on favorite to
walk off with the team title. But
behind the Trojans, a hat tie royal
is anticipated.
Oregon, short on depth but
long on outstanding individuals,
rates the edge for second place.
Rut Stanford, Cal, Washington,
UCLA and Washington State all
are threats lo the Ducks and lo
each other.
Sure Winners Few
Only two men can be classed
in the "almost-sure'\ winner cate
gory: Charlie Dumas and Jim
Grelle.
Dumas. USC's seven-foot high
jumper, is four or five inches
better than the rest of the field.
Oregon's Grelle was on the U.S.
national team last summer, has
run close to four minutes in his
career, and handily beat his two
principal challengers, Bertil
Lundh and llob Shankland, ear
lier in dual-meet competition.
Tough in ilalf
Stanford strength lies princi
pally in the 880 the event where
Pay ton Jordan's group musl
score heavily i! i! is to have a
chance for the place position in
point standings.
Ernie Cunliffe, best man in the
race off his 1:49.9, and Jerry Sie
bert of Cal will re-run their Big
Meet battle. Don Chesarek, a
converted quarter • miler, and
Dick Lassen are Stanford's other
scoring hopes in ihe race.

Indian surprise hopes are pin
ncd on sprinter Norm Pease. Jor

at any time this year, and "could
he the surprise of the meet." Re
taxation and confidence appear
to be the keys to Pease's spurt.
John Kelly is the other Tribe
favorite he's the hop • step
jump choice and is also a prime
broad jump threat . Armand De-
Weese and Jerry Winters are the
In d i a n s ' chief weight • event

predictable events.
