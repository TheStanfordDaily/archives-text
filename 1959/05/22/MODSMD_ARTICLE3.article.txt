"I very firmly believe there will be no war over Berlin now," Ilorst
Blomeyer, Gorman consul in San Francisco, said yesterday at the
1IR Consular Talk.
Speaking about the Berlin crisis, Blomeyer explained that West
Germany prefers not to be officially seated at the Geneva conference

to recognizing East Germany as
an equal and full-fledged state.
He commented upon the exist
ing differences between the two
main political parties on the sub
ject of German reunification. The
majority party, the Christian So
cialist t Party, is willing to give
no eoneesions to the U.S.S.R.
without compensations. It is not
in favor of withdrawal from NA
TO under any circumstances.
The Democratic Socialists, who
have about 40 per cent of the
vote, are willing to make the first
move in bargaining with Russia.
He feels that the Democratic So
cialists would be willing to with
draw from NATO in order to
gain reunification.
Blomeyer thought withdrawal
would please the Soviet Union be
cause it Germany reunified at
the cost of NATO withdrawal,
Germany would be isolated. Rus
sia could then attempt to drive
Germany toward the East. Also,
he pointed out, Russia fears Ger
many in NATO and would like to
break Germany's power by forc
ing it to withdraw.
