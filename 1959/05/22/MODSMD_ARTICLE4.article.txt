# Hofstadter Scientist Of Year
## 
### 
Nuclear physicist Robert Hof
stadter, professor of physics, has i
been named California Scientist |
of the Year.
He received the award for de
termining, for the first time, tlie i
size and shape of the proton and j
neutron the two basic building!
block's of all nuclei.
His findings have, as a result,!
provided the first precise in for-1
mation on the internal arrange-'
merits of the electric charge and
magnetic moment of these .small
est of nuclear particles. '
Cash Award
The honor and a $.1000 cash
award were given to Hofstadter
at the second annual Science and
Industry Awards banquet in Los
Angeles last night before a sell
out audience of 1000 persons rep
resenting business, industry, ed
ucation and science throughout
California.
The Awards program is spon
sored'by the California Museum
of science and industry, Los An
geles.
Purpose of the awards is to be
stow recognition for "profound
accomplishment in the fields of
