# World Saddened by Death of Dulles
## Arlington Burial Planned; Geneva Meeting Recessed 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 21 (/t*> Former Secretary of Stale John
Foster Dulles, ill with cancer, died in his sleep at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center in Washington at 7:49 a.m. EDT Sunday. The former
Secretary of State was 71.
President Eisenhower shortened a weekend at his Gettysburg, I'a.,

farm by several hours and hur
ried back to Washington by auto
mobile. Back at t ho White House,
he signed a proclamation calling
Dulles a champion of righteous
ness "whose eyes were fixed on
the highest goals which men are
given to see."
The proclamation formally di
rected thai the American flag be
flown at half staff on all govern
ment buildings at home and
abroad until Dulles is buried.
Military Honors
Eisenhower ordered an official
funeral.
With the full military honors
accorded heroes and distin
guished men, Dulles will be bur
ied Wednesday on a wooded hill
side at Arlington National Ceme
tery, across the Potomac from
Washington.
The President and Mrs. Eisen
hower will attend.
The rites at Arlington will be
preceded by services at Washing
ton National Cathedral, an unfin
ished mass of stone on the high
est spot in the capital. Dulles
was a leader of the Presbyterian
Church, and Presbyterian clergy
men will officiate.
Honor Guard
For 21 hours, Dulles' body will
lie in repose at the cathedral
chapel, with an honor guard of
uniformed servicemen keeping
the vigil beside it.
Dulles is being honored with
an official rather than a state
funeral. In a state funeral, ordi
narily reserved for men of even
higher rank, the body lies in state
at the U.S. Capitol.
President and Mrs. Eisenhower
paid a 20-minute call at Dulles'
home in northwest Washington
late in the afternoon.
Ike Was Somber
The President seemed in a
somber mood as he stepped out
of his limousine in front of the
Dulles' house and escorted his
wife If) the front door. He ap
peared equally downcast when he
emerged for the ride back to the
executive mansion.
In Geneva, the Big Four for
eign ministers agreed to recess
their talks Wednesday and
Thursday to allow statesmen to
attend Dulles' funeral.
Secretary of State Christian A.
Hot ter decided to fly to Washing
ton Tuesday night from Geneva.
So did British Foreign Secretary
Selwyn Lloyd and French For
eign Minister Maurice Couve de
Murville.
Gromyko Too?
Although Dulles, to his un
doubted satisfaction, never was
admired by I he Soviet high com
mand, an American spokesman
at Geneva said Soviet Foreign
Minister Gromyko had expressed
"deep condolences" to Herter and
also might fly to Washington.
From over much of the rest of
the world, however, came expres
sions of sympathy and tribute.
