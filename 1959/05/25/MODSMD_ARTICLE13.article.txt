"The plan is lo open in the full

ert A. Walker, program director
I and administrator of foreign
campuses. "We will take 60 stu
dents. bringing our overseus ca
pacity to 129 students at one
| time," he continued.
Mostly Sophomores
"This means an opportunity
for a sizeable percentage of any
j one class to go," Walker said.
I The groups will tie composed
| "primarily, but not exclusively,
of sophomores," he concluded.
At Florence, s t u d ents will
maintain regular class schedules
Monday through Thursday. Long
weekends will allow time for in
dividual or group tours of Flor
ence and environs, Dr. Walker
said.
The course schedule will be "on
the same basis as Stuttgart," Dr.
Walker continued. "Courses in
the humanities and social sci
ences will be selected that profit
by being taught overseas and in
the arc;). Florence is particularly
rich in art and architecture."
Language Requirement.
Students will be required to
have had a year's course in Latin
or a Romance language befo.re
going to Florence. Intensive Ital
ian will be taught at the study
center.
"We have been greatly encour
aged by the success of our first
campus in Germany," Dr. Ster

neering enterprise which has en
riched the experience of the par
ticipating students."
The six-month instruction pe
riods at Florence will be autumn
and winter quarters and spring
and summer quarters. This is in
contrast, to the summer-fall, win
tor-spring arrangement at Stutt
gart. As with the Stuttgart cam
pus, tuition and board will be the
same as on the home campus.
Florence will follow the Gor
man model, with a resident di
rector and a two- to three-man
faculty.

The site of the Florence study
center was located by Professor
Walker and Frederic O. Glover,
assistant to Dr. Sterling, last
summer. They were touring Eu
rope for Ihe purpose of looking
for a second overseas study cen
ter site.
The city of Florence has an ad
ditional meaning for Stanford
ites: in another hotel not far
from the contemplated "study cen
ter, Leland Stanford, Jr., died on
March 13, I8N1, from the effects
of a fever contracted while he
; was on a world tour with his par

"The plan is lo open in the full

ert A. Walker, program director
I and administrator of foreign
campuses. "We will take 60 stu
dents. bringing our overseus ca
pacity to 129 students at one
| time," he continued.
Mostly Sophomores
"This means an opportunity
for a sizeable percentage of any
j one class to go," Walker said.
I The groups will tie composed
| "primarily, but not exclusively,
of sophomores," he concluded.
At Florence, s t u d ents will
maintain regular class schedules
Monday through Thursday. Long
weekends will allow time for in
dividual or group tours of Flor
ence and environs, Dr. Walker
said.
The course schedule will be "on
the same basis as Stuttgart," Dr.
Walker continued. "Courses in
the humanities and social sci
ences will be selected that profit
by being taught overseas and in
the arc;). Florence is particularly
rich in art and architecture."
Language Requirement.
Students will be required to
have had a year's course in Latin
or a Romance language befo.re
going to Florence. Intensive Ital
ian will be taught at the study
center.
"We have been greatly encour
aged by the success of our first
campus in Germany," Dr. Ster
ling said. "This has been a pio
neering enterprise which has en
riched the experience of the par
ticipating students."
The six-month instruction pe
riods at Florence will be autumn
and winter quarters and spring
and summer quarters. This is in
contrast, to the summer-fall, win
tor-spring arrangement at Stutt
gart. As with the Stuttgart cam
pus, tuition and board will be the
same as on the home campus.
Florence will follow the Gor
man model, with a resident di
rector and a two- to three-man
faculty.
Site Decided On
The site of the Florence study
center was located by Professor
Walker and Frederic O. Glover,
assistant to Dr. Sterling, last
summer. They were touring Eu
rope for Ihe purpose of looking
for a second overseas study cen
ter site.
The city of Florence has an ad
ditional meaning for Stanford
ites: in another hotel not far
from the contemplated "study cen
ter, Leland Stanford, Jr., died on
March 13, I8N1, from the effects
of a fever contracted while he
; was on a world tour with his par
| ents.
The following year Senator
and Mrs. Stanford founded the
