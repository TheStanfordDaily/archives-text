# Quad Comes Out Today, 'Well Done'
## 
### 
Good photography, a particu
larly good copy lay-out, and some
well-chosen, meaningful words
have been combined to make this
year's Quad an excellent repre
sentation' of Stanford's 1938-39
academic and social year.
Distribution is scheduled to be
gin today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
at the Quad office, and will con
tinue through Wednesday. Stu
dent body cards will be re
quested.
Theme ot this year's Quad is
the '39 senior plaque as it takes
1 its place with plaques of previous
| years. The design is carried out.
effectively throughout the entire
book, from the eye-catching cov
er to the final page.
Color Pictures
As in last year's Quad, grad
uates' pictures are in full color,
with this year's pictures a de
cided improvement over the pre
vious year. Also featured is an
extended color section.
The faculty section has been
extended to give not only a repre
sentative picture sampling of
professors but, also, a short biog
raphy of each. Included for the
express purpose of furthering
better student - faculty relations,
this section is an important addi-
I tion to the Quad.
This year also marks the first
Stanford-in-Germany section.
Something for Everyone
In fact, there is something in
the '39 Quad for everyone. Even
the steps to the History building
(and Western Civ) greet fresh
men on the first page.
But more than just a pictorial
account, the Quad's well-chosen
words go behind the pictures and
search for their meaning in rela
tion to the student.
Spirit Captured
Those who question the Stan
ford "spirit!" might seriously
spend some time examining the
Quad, not by the individual pic
ture alone but, rather, as an
evolving unit. Intangible as this
"spirit" may be, the Quad has
done a rmarkablc job of captur
ing it.
Credit is due Editor Bob
Bureo and his staff for retaining
in the '59 Quad a part of this past
i year for each one of us.
Copies still may be purchased
at the Quad office.
