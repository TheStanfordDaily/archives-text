Stanford in Fi.orkxck! ;i truly significant step in a progression
that has all the exciting iudicaitons of leading Stanford toward
the position of the lines! undergraduate university in the eountry.
This announcement is significant because it proclaims in an
nndisputahle wa\ that Stanford in (Germany has heen a success.
The success of the hramhes-ahroad program is a com'
plimerit to the imaginatire thinking and tledicuted in
terest of the faculty. It also compliments the adminis
tration for wisely supporting this particular program and
fur encouraging faculty interest in the tohd educational
program <>/ the University.
Such enthusiasm and sincere interest (in the part ol the faculty
in addition to their marked excellence as scholars, and such sup
port from a forward looking administration can only mean ex
citing years ahead for Stanford's undergraduate program.
We have watched this faculty interest grow in the few short
years that we have heen here the results have heen remarkable:
the General Studies Program, two study centers abroad, the ex
pansion of Honor's Programs, and a new women's housing program.
These impressive results could easily he indicative of
a time not far off when the excellence and quality of a
Stanford undergraduate eilucation wdl he surpassed l>y

And the Florence branch itself? Does anything need to be

abroad follows closely on the heels of the recent news of Project M.

versity is going to work actively to see that an unhealthy imbalance
doesn't occur in the prestige of the University, weighted in favor
of science. We certainly approve of these efforts.
