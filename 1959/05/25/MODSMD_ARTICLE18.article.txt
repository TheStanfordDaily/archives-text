We ARE CLAD him suffering is over, that the long and public death,
the unfortunate lot of those of public stature, is done.
Not always did we see lh<* wisdom ol his policy, though many
times his achievements were great and real, and always we could
recognize him as a man sincerely and honestly committed to the
serviee of his country's interests in the world.
And we can wish that his commitment will he remembered
hy others of his countrvinen, who alter him will make it theirs.
