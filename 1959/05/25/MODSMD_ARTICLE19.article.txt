Untidy Pests
Editor, The Dally:
The University is again threat
ened with a serious problem. De
spite our inhospitality, the swal
lows keep coming back. These
untidy pests seein to like Stan
ford. But their tenacity and en
ergy in the face of stern, annual
reprimands from the University
is so boring.
If the swallows only thought
the same way we do they would

realize what an insult it is to
have one's nest torn down. Then
they would probably go away
and leave the University in peace.
On the other hand, if we could
make their winter stay more at
tractive at wherever it is they
come from, we wouldn't be both
ered with haying all those birds
around.
But, then, as I recall, nature
does abhor a vacuum.
