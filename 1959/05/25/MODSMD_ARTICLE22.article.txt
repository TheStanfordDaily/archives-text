# SEQUOIA
## New Staff Produces Edition: Contents are 'Worthy' 
### Diana Smith Managing Editor 
This spring's "Sequoia" wears
a wooded orange, yellow and
black cover.
A grand spring cover by Gilda
Meyers, it encloses worthy and
readable contents. The magazine
is faulted by some roughnesses
of layout, but these are probably
natural flaws to follow a recent
annual change of staff.
The lead article is "A Politics
of Peace," by H. Stuart Hughes;
it is subtitled "Reflections on C.
Wright Mills' "if le Causes of
World War III'."
Spiritual ( all
Hughes extracts the germs of
a spiritual call to American mo
bilization from tlie "disheveled"
Mills, then continues on his own
to the "supremely irrelevant"
power struggle of the U.S.A. and
U.S.S.R., and the respectability
of many of the emerging nations'
yearnings for neutrality from it.
Hughes' is a thoughtful piece,
deserving of Stanford's attention.
But perhaps one would be not en
tirely out of place in wishing also
for more of worthy students' ar
ticles for our literary magazine.
Outcast
There are two short stories. Tn
"Emil," -Uj De Eds sets her title
character amidst a conclave of
distant family • branches trying
to dispose of this scandaled small

boy outcast, just shipped Ihem !
from Denmark. Grandfather pre-1
sides.
M. E. White's is a wonderful
tale of Billy, of how the circus
eaine to a .small • town Kansas !
spring, and of the luve of Billy ;
and Ida Mae the sword swallow
er. The tale is as wonderfully il j
lustrated by Dave Mcintosh.
Birds, Wood
Most of the art work is of I
birds, and most of the rest of it
of pieces of wood. Other art con
tributors are Fran Huneke, Nick
j Golosow, Robert Ishikawa and
j Jamie Wheeler.
"Berlin: February 19. r >9" holds
| excerpts of David Quarles' diary ,
; of four weeks of volunteer work
! in a West Berlin refugee camp; j
these are disturbing impressions
of a suspended third Germany.
Tangents
Tom Terrell's poem, "Indefi
nite Extension," probes the mean
ingless end of men who have left
the tangible to become tangents.
"Medusa Consoling Narcissus
A Dialogue," by Steve Berry,
chart s*t he end of feeling, even of!
loneliness, in death.
The editorial is concerned with !
the business of reform at this i
University, and how it is not "l'e
rocious activity."
"Sequoia" will be sold on Quad
today through Wednesday, for -10
cents.
