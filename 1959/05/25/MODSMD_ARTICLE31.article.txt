# Bears Whip All Three Card Crews
## 
### 
Stanford varsity crew lost their
I chances for an IRA trip when
they lost to California Saturday
at Oakland, hut the Indian fresh
man shell rowed their best race
of the season, came within a
j length of beating the Cal frosh
and were voted a trip to the In
j tercollegiate Row i ii g Associa
tion's Regatta at Syracuse, N.Y.
Starting at 39 strokes a min-
I ute, the Papoose boat moved to
a two-seat lead before the Bears
I caught up and went ahead after
I half a mile.
Making the trip to Syracuse
will be Mike Jackson, Morgan
Halvorson, Mike Town, Joe Jen
nings, Ray Whit la, Brad Inrnan,
Jeff Eiseman, Ward DeWitt, Dick
Grant, Jon Smith and frosh coach
Phil Waters.
Cal's varsity whipped the local
j first boat by B'i lengths and
made their own plans for an IRA
; trip to forestall "Ky" Ebright's
retirement by one more race.
Stanford found their 3.3 stroke
wasn't enough to match the
Bears and Cal moved ahead from
the start.
Rowing a stroke lower at 32,
the JV oarsmen fell into the
same pattern as their varsity
j counterparts.
