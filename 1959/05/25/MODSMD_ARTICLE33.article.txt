Assistant coach Bill Allhouse
has often said, "Those walks'll

is precisely what slashed the In
dians' throat Saturday. The
trouble was that right-hander El

still managed to shut the Indians
out without a run until there
were two out in the ninth inning.
The locals out hit the Bears 5
to I, but UC was able to combine
hits, walks and Stanford errors
for two runs in the first inning,
one in the fourth, two in the fifth
! and three in the ninth.
Right-hander Earl Russell, who
: heat every team in the eonfer

j for Stanford but retired in the
fifth after he had filled the bases
on walks to Mike White and Noel
Barnes, a fielder's .choice, and
Gordon Dolinar's ground single

curve .just wasn't breaking right.
Southpaw Marv Mecklenberg
! relieved Russell and promptly
walked Tom MeGarry and Gary
Bronze I to force in two runs he
fore he could retire the side on
Elliott's slow roller to third.
Warren Nelson was on the
i mound for the Indians in the

sixth and pitched two good in
nings before bowing out for
pinchhitter .Jim Cowart in the
seventh.
In the eighth, the visitors
chased Roy Lawson, who earlier
this season saved a Stanford vic
tory against Cal, with walks to
Elliott and Bob Puecinelli, a hit
batsman, White's triple to the
right field corner, and Dolinar's
sacrifice fly to right.
Terry Lindeman relieved Law
son and finished the game with
out any further trouble.
Elliott, who did not allow a
Stanford hit until the fourth, was
one out away from tucking an
8-0 shutout in his back pocket
when he let Mike Magee get
away on balls, and issued a hloop
double to left to Lee Moench, and
an equally blooping single to
right to Robinson, scoring Magee

anil Moenoli with the Cnrilinals'
only two runs.
Robinson and Moenoh each eol

out without a run until there

sacrifice fly to right.
Terry Lindeman relieved Law

away on balls, and issued a hloop

out without a run until there

The locals out hit the Bears 5

hits, walks and Stanford errors
for two runs in the first inning,

Right-hander Earl Russell, who

right field corner, and Dolinar's
sacrifice fly to right.
Terry Lindeman relieved Law

Elliott, who did not allow a

one out away from tucking an

when he let Mike Magee get
away on balls, and issued a hloop
double to left to Lee Moench, and
an equally blooping single to
