A booklet containing informa

ulty Commission.
Aimed at presenting, as infor
mally as possible, the degrees,
works and interests of many

ments, willi whom they may not
come into contact. It will also
show students aspects of the pro
fessors' lives, i.e., hobbies, em
phasizing more the personalities,
rather than the strict profession
al data published in so many
straight biographies.
ASSU Legislature has budget
ed $1500 for the publication. John
Nickerson, who has been plan
ning it, said thai it is estimated
that 1 ho booklet will gross $3000.

ter. Students interested in work
ing on this phase of student-fac
ulty relations may try out Mon
