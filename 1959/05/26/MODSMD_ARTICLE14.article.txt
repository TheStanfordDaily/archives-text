## 
### 
GENEVA (/!') Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei A. Gromyko ac
cused the West Monday of plan
ning to convert West Germany
"into a runway for atomic bomb
ers and a launching site for rock
ets." He drew y prompt rebiTke
from U.S. Secretary of State
Christian A. Herter.

I The American diplomal told j
the Big Four foreign ministers' |
conference that rearmament of j
Communist East Germany was
going ahead at a greater pace
than in West Germany.
Britain's Foreign Secretary Scl
wyn Lloyd promptly cast himself |
in the role of conciliator. He sug-1

gested thai arguments along the
lino of the Gromyko-Herter ex
change would get the conference
nowhere.
German .Negotiations
In a 40-minute speech Gromy
ko called on the four big powers
to agree in principle that nego
tiations between the rival Ger
man states represented a desir
able way of restoring German
unity.
Grornyko said an additional ar
ticle or protocol could be added
to the Soviet draft peace treaty
in this connection. To make the
offer more palatable to the West
he spoke of the Big Four powers
rendering necessary aid in the
reunification process but did
not spell out the nature of such
help.
The clash between Grornyko
and Herter came shortly after the
delegations including those of
the Soviet Union and Fast Ger
many extended condolences to
Herter on the death of John Fos
ter Dulles.
ICitrly Today
The conference will meet ear
lier today to allow Herter, Lloyd
and French Foreign Minister
Maurice Couve de Murvillc to fly
together I<> Washington for Dul
les' funeral. The Soviets an
nounced that Grornyko also will
fly to Washington for the funer
al, but not in the same plane with
the Western diplomats.
The conference will recess
Wednesday and Thursday and re
sume Friday.
Accusations Sting
Soviet accusations of Ameri
can-fostered West German mili
tarism repeatedly have stung
the Western delegations at the
conference, now in its third week.
In Washington the State De
partment bluntly advised Soviet
Premier Nikita Khrushchev that
he would have to drop this line if
he wants to see tho Geneva talks
succeed.
The United States rejected the
Soviet Union's latest note protest
ing American arming of some
Atlantic Pact countries, including
Western Germany, with nuclear
weapons.
