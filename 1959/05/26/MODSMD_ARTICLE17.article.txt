# UP FROM $3
## $10 Vehicle Announced 
### 
Kffective on registration day
|of f;ill quarter, the yearly stu
dr>iii vehicle registration lee will
be $10, Frederic O. Glover, assist
ant Id President .1. K. Wallace
Sterling, announced yesterday.
Purpose of the fee increase,
j said Glover, is to place a greater
j proportion of the cost of Univer
i sity traffic control, parking lot
and road maintenance on auto
owners.
University roads are private
and get no lax support.
Chief of Police Gordon Davis
estimated thai his annual traffic
control budget for next year, in
cluding staff, clerical, auto and
motorcycle expense, will be $36,-
| 830.
Roads, Parking
University business office fig.
ores show that maintenance of
roads and parking areas, includ
ing annual depreciation, totals
$60,570.
| This totals $97,400, which, do.
i frayed by an estimated $48,000
i in student fees at the new rate,
leaves $49,400 as the University's
share of the annual cost, Glover
said.
This year and in previous
j years, the $.'-5 vehicle registration
I fee contributed only $18,000 to
ward the same total annual
maintenance cost, he pointed out.
Chief Davis said that next year
; all vehicles, including motor
j scooters and motorcycles, must
j pay the full registration fee.
Better than Ban
After a review of the situation
by University business and ad
ministrative officials, Glover
said:
"II was decided that allocation
of a fair share of the costs to
those responsible for them
seemed a more appropriate solu
tion to the problem than even to
consider banning autos from the
campus, as has been the solution
at some other universities."
A nationwide parking survey
to which Stanford contributed in
formation shows that, in general,
student vehicle registration fees
j vary directly in proportion to the
| number of university parking
spaces available.
Thus annual charges at New
York University are $40, Harvard
j $.30, University of Chicago $18 to
; $20, Perm State $20, Oklahoma
$10, University of Pennsylvania
$20, and."i 2 at Wayne State and
Temple. Low is $1 a year at
Western Reserve.
