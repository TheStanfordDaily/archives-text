# Take-Home Finals Bear Consideration
## 
### 
Wk MOTE WITH approval that List quarter a number of professors
ga\e all or part of their finals as take-home examinations. While
such tests can mean added work to the student, we ill t «•«* 1 that
take-home finals, when practical, are io many cases the heal way
for a professor to test a student.
If we assume that the first objective is to test for knowledge
of a subject and lor the students" ability to use and relate that
knowledge, we wonder how putting a student under pressure by
restricting his time, and placing him in an often crowded, stuff)
room, improves the accuracy of tln* testing?
Knowledge isn't tested —only knowledge-under-pressure, and
there can be a real difference in many cases. Often tlie student
who copes best with the extraneous factors is rewarded —not the
student who has learned the most from the course.
We spend 12 nocks of our undergraduate program
being "finally" tested —wore than an aeadeinie quarter.
Because of this it certainly seems desirable to try to find
a testing system that would accurately test a student and
at the same time contribute in a significant nay to a stu
dent's education.
Take-home finals do this in two ways:
• First, they give the student time to analyze the course
within its own context. Such finals allow ample time —more than
just four hours—to think through the questions and answers, care
fully weighing and reconsidering the course material, with the
result that, in fact, the final has helped the student to reach a better
understanding of the course instead of simply testing him.
• Second, penetrating questions properly drafted and lots of
time to think about them would not only give the student a mean
ingful context in which to review the course, but also allow him
to connect and place what he has learned —and the questions the
course leaves unanswered —in the perspective of his total knowl
edge. ,
These tests could do much to help maintain the totality
of a student's education and help to break doicn —in a
small way at least —the com partrnentalization that arises
from changing courses every quarter and being tested
dozens of times each year.
There are many different ways in which the idea of the take
home final might be used —giving out questions before hand, but
requiring the writing be limited to four hours, or giving part take
home and part in-class finals, for example. We hope faculty people
will consider take-home examinations as they plan lor the finals
ahead.
