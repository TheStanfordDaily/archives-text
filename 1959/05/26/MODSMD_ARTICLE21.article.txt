# President's Report

### 
By John Bohn
Since this is the last column of
an eventful year, I would like to
depart from the usual informa
tive approach to campus issues
to make a few personal com
ments.
I would first like to pay my
respects to the members of the
1958-1959 ASSU Legislature. Sel
dom have I seen a group of peo
ple, themselves deeply involved
in the academic program, so self
less with their time and abilities
in the exercise of an often rather
thankless task.
They have this year attempt
ed to meet issues head on and
fairly, to discuss them at
length, and to reach decisions
which reflect accurately the
interests of the stintent body.
Their aim has been to achieve
a closer and more representative
relationship with the student
body and to lay a firm founda
tion for important achievements
in the future. We hope that fu
ture events will bear favorable
witness to their efforts.
I should iike also to pay my
respects to The Stanford Daily,
and especially to the editors
for this year, Barbara Hicks
a d Lei Krulitz. It is perhaps
unusual that student govern
ment should publicly acknowl
\l *e its debt to The Daily, and
: >a*leve me this is not to imply
hat relations between the Lt'g
is'ature and The Daily have
always been harmonious.
We have, however, been able
o 'raw on the abilities and in
e e~'s represented in The Daily
the great advantage, I think,
of the student body.
Perhaps it is not politic to ex
press my appreciation to the ad
ministration, but I feel that it
would be less than fair not to
do so.

Wt> have been privileged to
work very closely with — and
sometimes in opposition to —
men and women of great stat
ijre and wide understanding,
and we have found the admin
istration extremely anxious to
hear student ideas and propos
als and to delegate to the stu
dents as much responsibility as
they are willing to receive.
Often the criticism is leveled at
student government that, once
elected, student officers become
pawns of the administration and
faculty. If any of you feel that
way I suggest that you ask some
of the administration personnel
with whom student officers come
into contact.
We would be less than hon
est with the student body and
with ourselves, however, if we
were not at least susceptible to
convincing. We have simply
found that in some cases in
our judgment the administra
tion has the weight of logic and
understanding on its side.
And last bTtt by no means least
I would like to acknowledge the
debt that all of your student of
ficers owe to you, the student
body. Speaking for Carolee Hou
ser, your vice-president, your Fi
nancial Manager Larry Kelley
and my Administrative Assistant
Rod Hawes, we are deeply appre
ciative of your continued support
and interest.
To the members of the various
boards and commissions wc
would like to express our thanks
for your initiative, responsibility
and co-operation. As a result all
of our jobs have been much eas
ier.
Speaking for myself I can only
say thank you. It has been a
very great privilege and honor to
have served you as president of
the Associated Students.

way I suggest that you ask some
of the administration personnel
with whom student officers come
into contact.
We would be less than hon
est with the student body and
with ourselves, however, if we
were not at least susceptible to
convincing. We have simply
found that in some cases in
our judgment the administra
tion has the weight of logic and
understanding on its side.
And last bTtt by no means least
I would like to acknowledge the
debt that all of your student of
ficers owe to you, the student
body. Speaking for Carolee Hou
ser, your vice-president, your Fi
nancial Manager Larry Kelley
and my Administrative Assistant
Rod Hawes, we are deeply appre
ciative of your continued support
and interest.
To the members of the various
boards and commissions wc
would like to express our thanks
for your initiative, responsibility
and co-operation. As a result all
of our jobs have been much eas
ier.
Speaking for myself I can only
say thank you. It has been a
very great privilege and honor to
have served you as president of
the Associated Students.

Since this is the last column of
an eventful year, I would like to
depart from the usual informa
tive approach to campus issues
to make a few personal com
ments.
I would first like to pay my
respects to the members of the
1958-1959 ASSU Legislature. Sel
dom have I seen a group of peo
ple, themselves deeply involved
in the academic program, so self
less with their time and abilities
in the exercise of an often rather
thankless task.
They have this year attempt
ed to meet issues head on and
fairly, to discuss them at
length, and to reach decisions
which reflect accurately the
interests of the stintent body.
Their aim has been to achieve
a closer and more representative
relationship with the student
body and to lay a firm founda
tion for important achievements
in the future. We hope that fu
ture events will bear favorable
witness to their efforts.
I should iike also to pay my
respects to The Stanford Daily,
and especially to the editors
for this year, Barbara Hicks
a d Lei Krulitz. It is perhaps
unusual that student govern
ment should publicly acknowl
\l *e its debt to The Daily, and
: >a*leve me this is not to imply
hat relations between the Lt'g
is'ature and The Daily have
always been harmonious.
We have, however, been able
o 'raw on the abilities and in
e e~'s represented in The Daily
the great advantage, I think,
of the student body.
Perhaps it is not politic to ex
press my appreciation to the ad
ministration, but I feel that it
would be less than fair not to
do so.

Wt> have been privileged to
work very closely with — and
sometimes in opposition to —
men and women of great stat
ijre and wide understanding,
and we have found the admin
istration extremely anxious to
hear student ideas and propos
als and to delegate to the stu
dents as much responsibility as
they are willing to receive.
Often the criticism is leveled at
student government that, once
elected, student officers become
pawns of the administration and
faculty. If any of you feel that
way I suggest that you ask some
of the administration personnel
