# Count Oryâ€”'Sparkling Revival'
## 
### Michael Collins 
In the past few years we have
been led to expect ol' the Stan
ford Music Department highly
professional performances of lit
tle-known or unusuaJly interest
ing operatic works. This season's
sparkling revival of Rossini's
musical comedy, "The Count
Ory," is no exception.
Through an emphasis on its
more colorful aspects of vocal
brilliance, costume and stage de
sign, a scintillating performance
of an assuredly second-rate work
was achieved. The opera itself
consists of loosely connected for
mal arias in the Italian buffo
tradition with the addition of con
siderable contribution from the
chorus, a concession to French
opera audiences.
Talent Spent
The first act is as musically
brilliant as the second act is te
dious, Rossini seeming to have
spent all his considerable talent
before he reached the second act.
Howard Sutherland is quite ex
ceptional both in his dramatic
coloratura passages of the florid
areas. The flawless intonation
and extreme vocal agility of
Marni Nixon as the Countess is
remarkable, though her voice is
somewhat thin for the demands
of the operatic stage.
Outstanding
Margot Blum as the Page of
Count Ory is outstanding in her
flawless visual and vocal por
trayal of the lovesick swain, as
is Edwin Dunning in the part of
the Ph.D. turned private spy.
Subordinate roles are enhanced
by the rich contralto of Stanford
graduate Janis Wilcox and the
fine baritone of Winther Ander
son.

Sandor Salgo displays his usu
al mastery of the musical score
in superbly co ordinating its var
ious elements and extracting as
much musical excellence as the
score contains. If the tempo at
times seems a trifle slow, it is no
doubt because of the extreme
difficulty of the florid lines.
A large share of the credit also
belongs to Harold Schmidt,
whose excellent chorus sur
mounts the vocal demands and
still projects clearly the entire
text.
Frederick Rider provides the
production with fanciful sets,

and Frederick Cohen's stage di
rection is admirable, although
ihe movements of the chorus in
the first ad are at times a bit
wooden. In the second act, the
spinning scene is beautifully
staged.
All in all the performance is a
credit to the Stanford Music De
partment. Seats for the remain
ing per formances, May 28. 29 and
30, are available at the Dinkel
spiel box office.
