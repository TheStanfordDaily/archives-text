# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
The limcral Wasn'l 100 Sad
The funeral of Pacific ('oust Conference track and field was car
ried out l-'riday and Saturday in merry fashion in a meet that was
loaded with oddities, surprise, and disappointments especially in
Ilie Stanford column. They included:
• The failure ol Dick Lassen and Don Chesarck to score in the
SSO as thev couldn't even make the final. Lassen found himself in
a very fast heat, still ran well for 770 yards, and then died in the
stretch after taking an elbow from Wayne Lemons. Cliesarek, still
a newcomer to the half, found himself the pacesetter most of the
Way. The others iu the race used him effectively, but left him to
hang in the stretch.
• The impossibly close broad jumping. And adding to the tense*
nes of an event where orte quarter of an inch separated the first four
men was the fact thai three of them had their best marks on their
final jumps.
• Otis Davis' 1(1 I quarter. He's 25 years old, has a basketball
background, and was listed in the Oregon press book as possibly a
solution to their 110 problem. He's improved in long strides all year,
this time chopping 1 . 1 seconds off his previous best. By NCAA time,
there's no telling what he'll he able to do.
• The mile relay, first, CSC was forced to run without Bobby
Slatcn, leaving the race open for < al or Washington. Coming off the
third leg, Cal was well up when suddenly Jerry Siclwrl dropped the
baton after brushing the WSC runner. This might not seem so odd
except that Sieberl lost the slick for Cal in the Fresno Relays just
two weeks ago. Sieberl slopped then and there, but anchor man -lack
Yernian ran anyway, just to keep the Huskies' Terry Tobacco com
pany. The finish was a thriller, with Tobacco the winner by a frac
tion of a foot but of course Cal was disqualified.
• .lerrv Winters, tie barely qualified at 52-4'.a in Iheshol, spent
the next two bonis I browing despite previous experience at throwing
away his best efforts, and then couldn't move from his sixth sp<il
in the finals.
• Hobby Sf a fen and Sieve Anderson. Stalen was supposed to
win the HO, 220 and anchor a winning relay. Instead, he seemed to
incorrectly judge his place as he ran I he quarter in lane 5, and wound
up third. In Ibe 220, lie pulled up while running about sixth, and
finally scratched from the relay. Anderson, who has bad good marks
in the luo, lows and broad jump, wound up with one point.
• 112 rank VVyalf, Ibe ancient, balding Idahoan, was the crowd's
favorite in the three-mile and didn't disappoint. Though he looked
out of il when Dick Miller and Alan Gaylord began their final-lap
kick, Wyafl was just saving. He turned on a double-barreled kick
with ISO yards to and won handily amidst loud cheering.
• Lrnie ( online, who stands as one of present day track's few
wire-to-wire runners. He wails for no man's pace, leads from the
gun, and leads until lie wins or is -caught at the wire. Had Cnnlifl'c
not used blocks, bad lie been in lane three instead of two, or had the
race been SSI yards instead of SSO, ( untitle might have lost.
• And, last of the surprises, assistant athletic director ( buck Tay
lor, who was shocked to find that three Daily sports staffers had
driven KiOO miles to see the meet. Mis comment: "And not even any
girls?"
Back Track Through Spike History
The flavor and facts of many of track and field's brightest mo
ments have been combined into "Hack Track" a collection of track
stories written during the past 3S years by Maxwell Sjiles.
Stiles, now a columnist with the Mirror-News in Los Angeles,
has written for papers in the Southland and Hay Area, and for a
variety of sports and track publications. He's acknowledged as
among the most able of all track writers and historians.
Of particular interest locally are several articles which have
Stanford men as their central characters. On Hen Last man, for ex
ample:
Stanford Cniversify, March 27 (1932) —Ted Meredith, one of the
most glorified traditions in American track history, would have
been but a ghostly shadow behind blond Hen Last man, Stanford's
white blizzard of the cinderpath, here today.
Six yards —seven —maybe eight, and one full second in time, the
stout-hearted Pennsylvania!! of 16 years ago would have been stag
gering in the <lust behind the flying spikes of this new marvel who
today ran a quarter mile in the astounding time of 46.4 seconds.
Or there is Sfilcs' prize-winning story written in the office of the
Long Beach Press-Telegram several hours after Stanfordian-to-be
Bob Mat bias had won the 1918 Olympic decathlon championship:
Last night, I think, I sat in the stands at Wembley, the dark
stands at Wembley, and watched the world of emotions, like silent,
rain drenched jockeys astride steeds of fear and pride, go rushing
by.
I sat there in fancy, in the drizzly gloom of a London night,
somewhere under (he abysmal, overhanging" blackness of the cov
ered grandstand. And beside me, their hearts in (heir throats and
looking on through eyes that glistened like the drops of falling
rain in the dim lit arena below, huddled the chilled figures of a
country doctor and his wife.
Dr. and .Mrs. 0. M. Mathias of Tulare, California, had come all
the way to London in the hope of seeing their 17-year-old son, Bob,
win the decathlon championship of the 14th Olympiad.
And so on. in brilliant fashion, continues "Back Track" and its
chronology of track's great events. Certainly of interest to every
track follower, the SO,OOO-word publication is available for $1 from
Track and Field News, Box 2!)6, Los Altos.
After a 2' ■ year run,"The Finish Line" has reached the finish

Back Track Through Spike History
The flavor and facts of many of track and field's brightest mo
ments have been combined into "Hack Track" a collection of track
stories written during the past 3S years by Maxwell Sjiles.
Stiles, now a columnist with the Mirror-News in Los Angeles,
has written for papers in the Southland and Hay Area, and for a
variety of sports and track publications. He's acknowledged as
among the most able of all track writers and historians.
Of particular interest locally are several articles which have
Stanford men as their central characters. On Hen Last man, for ex
ample:
Stanford Cniversify, March 27 (1932) —Ted Meredith, one of the
most glorified traditions in American track history, would have
been but a ghostly shadow behind blond Hen Last man, Stanford's
white blizzard of the cinderpath, here today.
Six yards —seven —maybe eight, and one full second in time, the
stout-hearted Pennsylvania!! of 16 years ago would have been stag
gering in the <lust behind the flying spikes of this new marvel who
today ran a quarter mile in the astounding time of 46.4 seconds.
Or there is Sfilcs' prize-winning story written in the office of the
Long Beach Press-Telegram several hours after Stanfordian-to-be
Bob Mat bias had won the 1918 Olympic decathlon championship:
Last night, I think, I sat in the stands at Wembley, the dark
stands at Wembley, and watched the world of emotions, like silent,
rain drenched jockeys astride steeds of fear and pride, go rushing

I sat there in fancy, in the drizzly gloom of a London night,
somewhere under (he abysmal, overhanging" blackness of the cov

looking on through eyes that glistened like the drops of falling
rain in the dim lit arena below, huddled the chilled figures of a

Back Track Through Spike History
The flavor and facts of many of track and field's brightest mo

Or there is Sfilcs' prize-winning story written in the office of the

• The failure ol Dick Lassen and Don Chesarck to score in the

a very fast heat, still ran well for 770 yards, and then died in the
stretch after taking an elbow from Wayne Lemons. Cliesarek, still
a newcomer to the half, found himself the pacesetter most of the

background, and was listed in the Oregon press book as possibly a
solution to their 110 problem. He's improved in long strides all year,
this time chopping 1 . 1 seconds off his previous best. By NCAA time,
there's no telling what he'll he able to do.
• The mile relay, first, CSC was forced to run without Bobby
Slatcn, leaving the race open for < al or Washington. Coming off the
third leg, Cal was well up when suddenly Jerry Siclwrl dropped the
baton after brushing the WSC runner. This might not seem so odd
except that Sieberl lost the slick for Cal in the Fresno Relays just
two weeks ago. Sieberl slopped then and there, but anchor man -lack
Yernian ran anyway, just to keep the Huskies' Terry Tobacco com

Stiles, now a columnist with the Mirror-News in Los Angeles,
has written for papers in the Southland and Hay Area, and for a

Stanford Cniversify, March 27 (1932) —Ted Meredith, one of the
most glorified traditions in American track history, would have
been but a ghostly shadow behind blond Hen Last man, Stanford's
white blizzard of the cinderpath, here today.
Six yards —seven —maybe eight, and one full second in time, the
stout-hearted Pennsylvania!! of 16 years ago would have been stag

today ran a quarter mile in the astounding time of 46.4 seconds.
Or there is Sfilcs' prize-winning story written in the office of the
Long Beach Press-Telegram several hours after Stanfordian-to-be
Bob Mat bias had won the 1918 Olympic decathlon championship:
Last night, I think, I sat in the stands at Wembley, the dark
stands at Wembley, and watched the world of emotions, like silent,
rain drenched jockeys astride steeds of fear and pride, go rushing
by.
I sat there in fancy, in the drizzly gloom of a London night,
somewhere under (he abysmal, overhanging" blackness of the cov

rain in the dim lit arena below, huddled the chilled figures of a
country doctor and his wife.
Dr. and .Mrs. 0. M. Mathias of Tulare, California, had come all
the way to London in the hope of seeing their 17-year-old son, Bob,
win the decathlon championship of the 14th Olympiad.

The limcral Wasn'l 100 Sad
The funeral of Pacific ('oust Conference track and field was car
ried out l-'riday and Saturday in merry fashion in a meet that was
loaded with oddities, surprise, and disappointments especially in
Ilie Stanford column. They included:
• The failure ol Dick Lassen and Don Chesarck to score in the
SSO as thev couldn't even make the final. Lassen found himself in
a very fast heat, still ran well for 770 yards, and then died in the
stretch after taking an elbow from Wayne Lemons. Cliesarek, still
a newcomer to the half, found himself the pacesetter most of the
Way. The others iu the race used him effectively, but left him to
hang in the stretch.
• The impossibly close broad jumping. And adding to the tense*
nes of an event where orte quarter of an inch separated the first four
men was the fact thai three of them had their best marks on their
final jumps.
• Otis Davis' 1(1 I quarter. He's 25 years old, has a basketball
background, and was listed in the Oregon press book as possibly a
solution to their 110 problem. He's improved in long strides all year,
this time chopping 1 . 1 seconds off his previous best. By NCAA time,
there's no telling what he'll he able to do.
• The mile relay, first, CSC was forced to run without Bobby
Slatcn, leaving the race open for < al or Washington. Coming off the
third leg, Cal was well up when suddenly Jerry Siclwrl dropped the
baton after brushing the WSC runner. This might not seem so odd
except that Sieberl lost the slick for Cal in the Fresno Relays just
two weeks ago. Sieberl slopped then and there, but anchor man -lack
Yernian ran anyway, just to keep the Huskies' Terry Tobacco com
pany. The finish was a thriller, with Tobacco the winner by a frac
tion of a foot but of course Cal was disqualified.
• .lerrv Winters, tie barely qualified at 52-4'.a in Iheshol, spent
the next two bonis I browing despite previous experience at throwing
away his best efforts, and then couldn't move from his sixth sp<il
in the finals.
• Hobby Sf a fen and Sieve Anderson. Stalen was supposed to
win the HO, 220 and anchor a winning relay. Instead, he seemed to
incorrectly judge his place as he ran I he quarter in lane 5, and wound
up third. In Ibe 220, lie pulled up while running about sixth, and
finally scratched from the relay. Anderson, who has bad good marks
in the luo, lows and broad jump, wound up with one point.
• 112 rank VVyalf, Ibe ancient, balding Idahoan, was the crowd's
favorite in the three-mile and didn't disappoint. Though he looked
out of il when Dick Miller and Alan Gaylord began their final-lap
kick, Wyafl was just saving. He turned on a double-barreled kick
with ISO yards to and won handily amidst loud cheering.
• Lrnie ( online, who stands as one of present day track's few
wire-to-wire runners. He wails for no man's pace, leads from the
gun, and leads until lie wins or is -caught at the wire. Had Cnnlifl'c
not used blocks, bad lie been in lane three instead of two, or had the
race been SSI yards instead of SSO, ( untitle might have lost.
• And, last of the surprises, assistant athletic director ( buck Tay
lor, who was shocked to find that three Daily sports staffers had
driven KiOO miles to see the meet. Mis comment: "And not even any
girls?"
