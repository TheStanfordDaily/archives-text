TILL WE MEET AGAIN
This is the last column of my lifth year of writing for Philip
Morris and Marlboro. I have made it a custom in the last
column of each year not to be funny. I know 1 have also
realized this aim in many other columns during the year, but
that was not for lack of t eying. Today lam not trying. I am not
trying for two reasons: First, because you are getting ready for
final exams and in your present state of shock, nothing in the
world could possibly make you laugh. And second, this final
column of the year is for many of us a leave-taking, and good
byes always make me too misty to be funny.
For me the year ends neither with a bang nor a whimper, but
with a glow—a warm, pleasant, mellow glow—the kind of glow
you will find, for example, at the end of a l'hilip Morris or
Marlboro.
It has been in every way a gratifying experience, my five
years with the makers of Philip Morris and Marlboro, and I
would like to take this opportunity to .extend my heartfelt
appreciation to these good tobacconists, to assure tlieni that
the memory of their kindness will remain ever green in my
heart, and to remind them that they still owe me for the last
three columns.
And in these waning days of the school year, let me address
myself seriously to you, my readers. Have I trod on any toes
this year? Ruffled any feelings? Jostled any sensibilities? If
so, I am sorry.
Have I occasioned any laughs? Chuckles? Sniggers? Mona
Lisa smiles? If so, I'm glad.
Have 1 persuaded any of you to try Philip Morris and
Marlboro? To taste that fine flavor? To smoke that excellent
tobacco? If so, you arc glad.
And now the long, lazy summer lies ahead. Hut for me sum
mer is never lazy. It is, in fact, the busiest time of year. Two
suuuncrs ago, for instance, 1 was out ringing doorbells every
single day, morning, noon, and night. There was a contest,
you see, and the kid in my neighborhood who sold the most
bluing won a pony. 1 am proud to report that 1 was the lucky
winner.
Past summer I was al o out ringing doorbells every single
day, morning, noon, and night. 1 was trying to sell the pony.
