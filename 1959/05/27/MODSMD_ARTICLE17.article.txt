# Political, Growth Crises Gave de Gaulle Opening
## French Fourth Republic Lost Support of Youth, Says Brogan 
### Lynn DeLargey 
"A crisis of very rapid change and growth, a disparity between the
efficiency of political institutions and a revolutionary new economy"
was what led to the dissolution of the French Fourth Republic and
the ascendancy of General Charles de Gaulle last May.
Professor Dennis VV. Brogan of Cambridge University, speaking

last night at the Tuesday .Scrips |
program in Memorial Audito- j
rium, pointed to the failure of the j
Fourth Republic government to j
represent the people, its indul
gence in "politics for politics'
sake," as a cause of the present
alienation of the younger French
people from the older governing
class.
To the French, rle Gaulle repre
sented two opposite guarantees:
maintenance of national power,
especially in Algeria, and protec
tion against militarism. "Most of
the supporters of de Gaulle see
in him a defender of basic repub
lican liberties against the miil
tary."
Weaknesses
Weaknesses of the new consti
tution, which was approved last
fall by SO per cent of the voters,
are chiefly in "overweighting in
favor of the countryside," the
small towns and the colonies, in
the large presidential electoral
college and in the national Sen
ate, newly restored to power.
"Seeds of future trouble" may
be found in de Gaulle's respect
for traditional government, espe
cially local government , at a time j
in France when "society must ex-j
pand or enter on a revolutionary
crisis."
The Fifth Republic under de
Gaulle has already accomplished
"a great many useful things" in
the way of economic reforms and
the elimination of many time
and money-wasting institutions.
Mildly Optimistic
Brogan is "mildly optimistic"
about the success of de Gaulle's
new French community system,
which offers colonies the option
of joining or staying out, because
membership represents an eco
nomic advantage for the former
colonies.
