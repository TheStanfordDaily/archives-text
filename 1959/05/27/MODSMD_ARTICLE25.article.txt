## Personally Speaking 
### Leo Krulitz, Editor 
An optimist would look back
over the year at things like Rich
Sundeen's election on an "aca
demic" platform, or an overflow
lng Memorial Auditorium for a
Kendall-Sibley debate and say—
Stanford is slowly—very slow
ly—becoming an intellectual com
munity of student scholars. The
same optimist would look at ac
tions during the past year which
seem to indicate that student
government kept up with and re
flected this slow progression.
* Legislature established a
committee on academic affairs
which functioned most of the
year.
* Legislature studied such
matters as the scheduling of fi
nals, individual faculty members'
sponsorship of events on campus,
and cinch notices.
» They took a strong stand op
posing student loyalty oaths.
* They also approved a con
stitution for a student philosophi
cal discussion group.
TS'o Leadership
While it is disappointing that
our governing organization has
n't exerted strong, positive lead
ership in this development to
ward an intellectually oriented
college society, Legislature has
n't hindered this progression and
has reaily encouraged it more
so, at least, than any other Legis
lature that we have witnessed.
There are two other problems
facing student government that
bear a few final comments.
First, the myth persists right
up through the student hierarchy
that students have no power,
that in the last analysis the ad
ministration may (to just as they
please—they own the land.
But it is equally true that dur
ing the course of a year if the
University suddenly had no stu
dents to teach or no teachers, the
value of the institution would be
considerably lessened.
Power Equal
The point here is not to advo
cate mass strikes, but simply to
indicate that there is a very
strong latent power in the stu
dents, equal to any threat that
"this is our land, we'll do as we
please." These arguments should
cancel each other out and both
be dismissed, yet we find the
administration's position preva
lent in student minds; projects
and demands constantly fall be
fore it, or never arise because of
it.
Another, perhaps more ration
al, argument can be made.
It is the purpose of the Univer
sity to make tools available— pro
fessors, laboratories, housing,

etc.- which the students can use
to educate themselves. If these
tools are unhelpful, ineffective
01 inadequate, the student is cer
| tainly in a position to detect this,
and student government, repre
senting students, is certainly in
a position to communicate these
inadequacies in an authoritarian
manner.
One thing seems certain. If a
recognition isn't made that stu
dents do, in fact, have both pow
er and meaningful authority if
those students who are less mili
tant can't justify student author
ity on grounds satisfactory to
themselves then this thing
called student government will
remain ineffective not much
more than a tool of the Adminis
tration. No one likes to play
when one is sure that there is a
winning ace in the hole against
you; to do so is hypocrisy.
A second problem that needs
comment: is that when we talk
about expanding the powers of
student government we don't
want an expansion of arbitrary
power over the individual stu
dents or student groups. What is
wanted is a stronger representa
tion of student attitude in deal
ing with important academic
problems. There is a real distinc
tion here, if you'll think about
| it, and a very important one.
To expand LASSU's power
over this club or that in terms of
co-ordination or efficiency is to
do nothing more than create a
nuisance.
Obstruct Individualism
Individual, de-centralized initia
tive is the very thing' the Univer
| sity is attempting to foster. To
hinder this by actions of a stu
j dent government is to obstruct
j desirable individualism.
To challenge individual
J thought and actions on the basis
I of protecting the group from the
individual is a dangerous under
taking. The question here is anal
ogous to the constitutional ques
tion: when does freedom of
speech become disturbing the
: peace?
I don't feel a student governing
body is qualified to draw such a
precarious line dividing the two
—nor does it seem fitting that
they should. We are here to be
disturbed by thoughts of all kinds,
and a part of our education is a
resolving of these disturbances.
All in all, it's been a good year
for student government at Stan
ford—a ground work has been
; laid for things to come. Speak
ing for the editorial board of The
Stanford Daily, I'd like to compli
ment John Bohn, Clee Houser
and the members of Legislature
for a valuable year.
