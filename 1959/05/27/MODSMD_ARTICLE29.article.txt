## Dulles: A Man Who Stood Out Far Above His Political Battles 
### 
John Foster Dulles lived long
enough to know before he died
that among his countrymen he
had no enemies anil that his crit
ics and opponents liked and ad
mired him. This is unusual and
significant. For Dulles was a
highly controversial figure in a
dangerous time, and when we
have explained to ourselves why
at the end he stands out above
his battles, we shall have paid
him a fitting tribute.
The explanation does not He
in this or that policy or in any
moral {generalization. It lies
in the fact that he was in the
great tradition of what is re
quired of a man in his public
and his private life. The eulo
gies speak of him as a dedicat
ed man, and in the exact sense
of that over-used word, he was
dedicated to the function of a
public servant.
Perhaps the highest function
of a public servant in a free and
democratic society is to preserve
its oneness as a community
while he fights the battles which
divide it. John Foster Dulles nev
er lost sight of that.
lie never forgot, sts so many
public men do, that after the
issue which is up for debate is
settled, those who took part in
the debate must still live and
work together. That is the rea
son why among his country

men there is no rancor, and
why the sorrow of his oppo
nents and critics is genuine.
Like most men, he preferred
praise to criticism and agreement
to opposition. But he did not de
| mand conformity. He did not re
gard dissent as perversity; ho
; respected debate and the practice
l of free journalism.
It would be pretenious and
inherently absurd to suppose
that at tlits time it is possible
\ to make any kind of definitive
appraisal of his career. There
is no dispute anywhere that he
has been honorable in concep
tion and purpose. YVe do not
know what will be the judg
ment of the historians.
They will be writing with a
' knowledge which is denied to us
I as to what happened in the later
| chapters of the unfinished story,
j The judgment of history, it is
| fair to say, is almost always
j based on the results and not on
| the intentions. We do not know
I what in Germany, in the Middle
; East and in the Far East will be
i the results of the six years of his
I stewardship.
We cannot influence the histo
rians. But we can perhaps exhort
them to bear two things in mind.
One is that they must discount
heavily those who have a vested
interest in some particular pol
icy which John Foster Dulles
used, and would now like it to be

treated as one of the eternal veri
ties.
lor while Dulles did not
change his policies easily or
quickly, he did change them
when he was convinced that a
change was necessary.
The other thing the historians
must bear in mind is that they
should not judge John Foster
Dulles only by his policies which
are controversial and perhaps
transient. They should judge
him also for his public character
and his public virtue which were
excellent and a noble example to
his people.
