# Meet the Cards
## 
### 
Lundh is a sophomore from
Norway with brilliant past rec
ords and Jias been a valuable
point-get tor for the Indians. A
reliable scorer in the mile and
the half, he also has been a key
man in the two-mile and dis
tance medley relay teams. With
two years left, the lit lie guy
could tear up Western tracks.
Last week Bertil placed fourth
in the I'CC mile with a 4:11.4.

Smith was one of the finest j
sophomore sprinters in Card I
track annals. Started this sea- !
son with a bang, winning both
the short dashes against UCLA I
and turning in a promising low j
hurdle victory "against Fresno |
Stale. Has met nothing but in- !
juries since that lime. A jun- i
ior with a 9.6 best in the 100- i
yard dash.
