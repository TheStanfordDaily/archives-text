# This Point of View
## Unity Fosters Intolerance 
### Patrick Milburn 
It is depressing, though enlight
ening to read letters such as that
of May 19 by Gerry Heinemann
and Pat Paulson on the subject
of "Unity."
Under the guise of "meeting
others to profit from their views," 1
called unity, a group-oriented so
cial life has been fostered that h
blatantly intolerant of individual
differences that depart from a
norm in this kind of activity.
During those years and in a
place away from the operations
of the society as a whole, when
free-thought and free-action could
lead to tremendous diversifica
tion, a conformity is introduced
that pushes the interested intro
vert into a corner and then claims
that he isn't cooperating in free
exchange which has aspects would
could rob him of himself.
If unity is the goal, mass-mind
edness may very easily result. 1
feel that the philosophy implicit
in the word unity suggests a uni
fication of parts, and not the tree
association of thoughtful individ
uals.
When some members of a class
so supposedly full of unity, as '62
seemed to be, call for more unity,
the bankruptcy of the policy that
wishes for floors to have floor
unity, for houses to have house
unity, for classes to have class
unity, should be apparent.
The choice is ours whether we
are going to allow a free develop

ment of personalities or are going
to force them into restrictive
molds of one sort or another.
"Unity," and the slogan, "mix
mingle, inttegrate," both seem to
point to an assumption that all
persons shall serve themselves
and others best by the types of
activities sponsored by floors and
houses and present in pre-reg.
For the university to demon
strate the rich possibilities open
to individuals, the concept of
unity with its connotations would
have to lie discarded in favor of
the "free-association of free indi
viduals."
A decentralized social program
should be instituted in the inde
pendent areas at least, where, cur
rently, if you are going to derive
any use from dues you must par
ticipate in social activities.
During Pre-reg, besides, non
compulsory social functions being
scheduled, talks could be arranged
during the same period on sub
jects such as: international rela
lions, "what is art?", capitalism
and socialism, and on the possible
implications of the patterning of
living matter. These things would
allow a greater number of life
possibilities to be explored and
would give a taste of the diversi
fication open to students at a uni
versity.
Indeed, if the members of the
class of '62 cannot, achieve unity,
should we not suspect that there
is something wrong with the goal
that has been set?
