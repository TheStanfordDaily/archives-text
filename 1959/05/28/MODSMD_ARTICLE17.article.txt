## 'Crusade Against Football' 
### Elna Rodenhouse 
In a recent issue of "Nation," |
Wade Thompson, a professor at ,
Blown University, remarked on
some of the events and ideas thai
he found in his "Crusade Against
Football."
Among other things in the ar- j
tide, he called the football fan j
"an absolute oaf," and explained :
that the football fan believes |
"that he is not just seeing a!
game, but Something Impor
tant."
A football coach, he indicated, j
must not only coach a team, but j
also "be an expert theologian, a j
moralist of awesome skill, and a j
master rhetorician who can ma-j
nipulate cliches with a dazzling I
disregard for logic and common ;
sense."
In a speech last year, Thomp- j
son indicated, one football coach ;
said that football scholarships j
are good because they occasion- >
ally help a boy who might other
wise not be able to go to college.
"He also could have justified
prostitution scholarships by the
same reasoning, but didn't both
er," Thompson commented.
"To the Football Coach," con
tinued Thompson, "football does
n't develop leg muscles—football I
develops character. Football
doesn't provide entertainment for
a few thousand fans who just
want to whoop it up on Saturday
afternoon—football develops the
whoel man, the full personality.
"Football doesn't give a few
kids the thrill of playing before
a mass audience—football devel
ops leadership ability."
"To the Football Coach," adds
Thompson, "football develops
anything but the ability to play
football."
No claim is too extravagant for
football, he remarks. "Football
develops Americanism, Virtue,
Godliness, Patriotism and Char i
ity. I see that one Coach has

publicly stated that football is
our best defense against Commu
nism. Another one states that
football provides us with the
toughness necessary to survive
the next war. I shall not be sur
prised when someone comes up
with the theory that even Christ
played football."
Thompson was besieged, dur
ing his campaign, by reporters
from all types of publications and
just plain curiosity seekers.
">ly patriotism was repeat
edly questioned (1 am fiercely
patriotic). My sexual propen
sities were suspect (I lust only
for females). My sanity was
doubted (I am the soul of com
mon sense). My closets were
ransacked for skeletons (I
used to be a union organizer).
And a great deal of sympathy
for Communism was suspected
(I am grimly anti-Communis
tic )."
On the whole, however, Thomp
son succeeded in his purpose —
that of making Brown students
and possibly others aware of the
fallacies of the Football Myth.

Campus police at the Univer
sity of Oregon have hit upon a
new idea to help parking viola
tors pay their fines. Called a
".Rhino," the device, when placed
against the front wheels of a car,
makes the car immobile, and re
quires the offender to visit the
police station, fine in hand, be
fore he can move his car.
The Rhino resembles a metal
"boot" which can be fastened to
the left front wheel of any car.
The device fits over the rim and
hubcap of the wheel, and can be
adjusted to fit wheels of various
sixes. Once it has been adjusted,
the Rhino can then be locked into
place.
All, yes. Captain Midnight, I
was just leaving.
