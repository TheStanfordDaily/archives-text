This week several students cur
rently pledging fraternities have
been absent from classes. These
absences, resulting for some in
deficiencies on midterm exams,
lave been caused, unfortunately,
by a series of so-called "abdue
ions" which figure in fraternity
ritual.
The result of these abductions
s double-edged: both student and
instructor are hindered in the ac
complishment of their duties as
•itizens in an academic eommu
nity.
By their refusal to recognize
he legitimate claims of intellec
tual endeavor, the fraternities be
tray the very culture of which
heir names are symbolic. Some
l'e-evaluation (ft modern "Olym
pian" codes is necessary.

Editor, The Daily:
Mi-. Niles' letter of Monday,
equivocal as it wrfs, nevertheless
has raised a matter of timely im
port. Niles' abstract utilitarian
summary of the Stanford swal
lows as "untidy pests" gives us a
clue to the sort of detachment
which has led to such treatment
as these creatures have received
a the hands of I the University.
The University action can be
attacked quite simply from the
point of inconsistency — and by
this I mean University housing
policy. In short, these feathered
bipeds deserve nothing more or
less than equal treatment with
any other biped, feathered or
not. The University must stop
ducking the problem and supply
adequate housing for these indi
viduals.
Understanding the demand for
economic efficiency in solving
such problems, I would suggest
the construction of clusters with
central facilities.

No Problem
Editor, The Daily:
We deplore the whole thing.
There is no bird problem.
The birds are OK where they
are. Especially since birdseed is
only 10 cents a box. Someone is
trying to feed it to you. It's ob
vious the swallows aren't going
hungry.
This year they brought all
their friends. They will send 'em
right back to Alaska. It's cold in
Alaska.
We'd like to show 'em, those
cranks! And to prove it we will
demonstrate on Quad at 1 p.m.
on Thursday. We hope to see the
whole University tip up and take
a stand. But we are confident.
Stanford won't let the birds go
to pot!
Feathers and all.
Just remember, this whole
thing is for the birds. But don't
forget binoculars and an umbrel
la.

Editor, The Daily:
This quarter, Stanford fresh
men were required to read an ex
cerpt from Dostoevsky's "The
brothers Karamazov" entitled
"The Grand Inquisitor." In it,
ihe Grand Inquisitor attempts to
explain to Christ (and his con
science) why his system has been
■stahlished, why heretics must be
discovered by any means, and
why they must he burned before
Ihe masses.
While reading this brilliant
work, the freshmen automatical
ly identified themselves with
Christ as the auditor, the con
science of the Grand Inquisitor.
And while reading the words of
the Inquisitor, they, too, said
nothing, smiled half • derisively,
and, like Christ, remained uncon
vinced by the self-justification of
the Grand Inquisitor.
The Inquisitor admitted that
Christ had given men freedom
but he said most men were not
capable of achieving the mature
heights Christ promised them.
They did not know how to use
this freedom. In fact, they were
better off without it and under a
stern, pompous, immutable au
thority which would not and
csfj.uk! not permit questioning or
doubt. By having a system re
lieve them of the burdens of free
dom, men had happiness arid con
tentment, the Inquisitor claimed,
although they could never reach
the mature, full heights prom
ised by Christ (and the system).
But the Inquisitor was willing
to bear the sin of suppression
and although he knew why peo
ple were critical and rebellious
toward the system, he felt com
pelled to enforce it because it ex
isted. He had to be a martyr to
the system to save the peasants
from freedom. Christ smiled at
this delusion of tragic heroieism.
For some reason, the freshmen,
too, found all this very amusing.

Mi-. Niles' letter of Monday,
equivocal as it wrfs, nevertheless
has raised a matter of timely im
port. Niles' abstract utilitarian
summary of the Stanford swal
lows as "untidy pests" gives us a
clue to the sort of detachment
which has led to such treatment
as these creatures have received
a the hands of I the University.
The University action can be
attacked quite simply from the
point of inconsistency — and by
this I mean University housing
policy. In short, these feathered
bipeds deserve nothing more or
less than equal treatment with
any other biped, feathered or
not. The University must stop
ducking the problem and supply
adequate housing for these indi
viduals.
Understanding the demand for
economic efficiency in solving
such problems, I would suggest
the construction of clusters with
central facilities.

We deplore the whole thing.
There is no bird problem.
The birds are OK where they
are. Especially since birdseed is
only 10 cents a box. Someone is
trying to feed it to you. It's ob
vious the swallows aren't going
hungry.
This year they brought all
their friends. They will send 'em
right back to Alaska. It's cold in
Alaska.
We'd like to show 'em, those
cranks! And to prove it we will
demonstrate on Quad at 1 p.m.
on Thursday. We hope to see the
whole University tip up and take
a stand. But we are confident.
Stanford won't let the birds go
to pot!
Feathers and all.
Just remember, this whole
thing is for the birds. But don't
forget binoculars and an umbrel

This quarter, Stanford fresh
men were required to read an ex
cerpt from Dostoevsky's "The
brothers Karamazov" entitled
"The Grand Inquisitor." In it,
ihe Grand Inquisitor attempts to
explain to Christ (and his con
science) why his system has been
■stahlished, why heretics must be
discovered by any means, and
why they must he burned before
Ihe masses.
While reading this brilliant
work, the freshmen automatical
ly identified themselves with
Christ as the auditor, the con
science of the Grand Inquisitor.
And while reading the words of
the Inquisitor, they, too, said
nothing, smiled half • derisively,
and, like Christ, remained uncon
vinced by the self-justification of
the Grand Inquisitor.
The Inquisitor admitted that
Christ had given men freedom
but he said most men were not
capable of achieving the mature
heights Christ promised them.
They did not know how to use
this freedom. In fact, they were
better off without it and under a

science) why his system has been
■stahlished, why heretics must be
discovered by any means, and
why they must he burned before
Ihe masses.
While reading this brilliant
work, the freshmen automatical
ly identified themselves with
Christ as the auditor, the con
science of the Grand Inquisitor.
And while reading the words of
the Inquisitor, they, too, said
nothing, smiled half • derisively,
and, like Christ, remained uncon
vinced by the self-justification of
the Grand Inquisitor.
The Inquisitor admitted that
Christ had given men freedom
but he said most men were not
capable of achieving the mature
heights Christ promised them.
They did not know how to use
this freedom. In fact, they were
better off without it and under a
stern, pompous, immutable au
thority which would not and
csfj.uk! not permit questioning or
doubt. By having a system re
lieve them of the burdens of free
dom, men had happiness arid con
tentment, the Inquisitor claimed,
although they could never reach
the mature, full heights prom
ised by Christ (and the system).
But the Inquisitor was willing
to bear the sin of suppression
and although he knew why peo
ple were critical and rebellious
toward the system, he felt com
pelled to enforce it because it ex
isted. He had to be a martyr to
the system to save the peasants
from freedom. Christ smiled at
this delusion of tragic heroieism.
For some reason, the freshmen,
too, found all this very amusing.

Mi-. Niles' letter of Monday,
equivocal as it wrfs, nevertheless
has raised a matter of timely im
port. Niles' abstract utilitarian
summary of the Stanford swal
lows as "untidy pests" gives us a
clue to the sort of detachment
which has led to such treatment
as these creatures have received
a the hands of I the University.
The University action can be
attacked quite simply from the
point of inconsistency — and by
this I mean University housing
policy. In short, these feathered
bipeds deserve nothing more or
less than equal treatment with
any other biped, feathered or
not. The University must stop
ducking the problem and supply
adequate housing for these indi
viduals.
Understanding the demand for
economic efficiency in solving
such problems, I would suggest
the construction of clusters with
central facilities.

Editor, The Daily:
We deplore the whole thing.
There is no bird problem.
The birds are OK where they
are. Especially since birdseed is
only 10 cents a box. Someone is
trying to feed it to you. It's ob
vious the swallows aren't going
hungry.
This year they brought all
their friends. They will send 'em
right back to Alaska. It's cold in
Alaska.
We'd like to show 'em, those
cranks! And to prove it we will
demonstrate on Quad at 1 p.m.
on Thursday. We hope to see the
whole University tip up and take
a stand. But we are confident.
Stanford won't let the birds go
to pot!
Feathers and all.
Just remember, this whole
thing is for the birds. But don't
forget binoculars and an umbrel
la.
