### 
WASHINGTON (/P)- President Eisenhower will take a direct hand
today in trying to break the deadlock at the East-West foreign min
isters' conference. ,
Only a few hours after the U.S., British, French and Soviet diplo
matic chiefs landed here from Geneva, a White House Conference

was set up.'
The foreign ministers suspend
ed their so-far fruitless talks at
Geneva to attend yesterday's fu
neral of John Foster Dulles, who
not many months ago was in the
thick of the Communist-Western
dispute over Berlin.
Secret Basis
The Geneva negotiations are
scheduled to resume officially
Friday on a secret basis. But the
Soviet and Western foreign pol
icy chiefs are likely to get to
work again before that when
they fly back to Europe together
aboard an Air Force plane.
The Dulles funeral brought
one of the biggest concentrations
fcf foreign dignitaries here in
many years. Eisenhower ar
ranged a luncheon for them to
day to follow his talk with the
Big Four negotiators.
Says (iromyko
Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei (iromyko, arriving here by
commercial airliner, told ques
tioning newsmen, "It's too early
to say" whether the (geneva
meeting may produce a peaceful
solution of the German crisis.
"We would like to sec success,"
said the dour Gromyko.
When he landed about half an
hour later, Secretary of State
Christian A. I loiter voiced the
view that the Geneva scsions so
far had made only small prog
ress.
