# Spring Quarter Tuesday Series Programs Greatly Improved
## 
### Lynn DeLargey 
The Tuesday Series Committee
had two related objectives in mind
in planning this quarter's Tues
day series lectures. The first was
to arrange for lectures of "a little
more intellectual content" than
previously, according to Commit
tee chairman Professor Samuel D.
Thurman.
Consequently the travelogs with
color slides have boon replaced by
lectures on world affairs, litera
ture, and social problems. The re
sult has been eight lectures of no
ticeably more intellectual content,
which should have had wide in
terest for both stud en t sand
townspeople.
More Information
With Denis Brogan climaxing a
series of knowledgeable speakers
of considerable reputation, the
Tuesday series has offered more
real information and stimulation
of thought than Ihe previous two
quarters.
The second objective was to
bring out more students, as well
i as the older people from Palo
Alto.
Attendance figures li aye not
been as high as the Committee
had hoped, however. The average
attendance has dropped from 700
per night autumn quarter and the
all-time high of 1000 winter quar
ter to about '100 this spring.
Does thi/ mean students prefer
illustrated travel talks? Hopeful
ly, the attendance decline merely
reflects the jam-packed social cal
endar for spring quarter. The
weak +)fferings of the first two
quarters no doubt discouraged
many students from attending
during spring quarter.
The smaller Dinkelspiel audito
rium, where speakers can be bet
ter heard and seen, promotes bet
ter understanding and more in
terest in what is said, and -should
be used for all the lectures.
Program Selection
The Committee tries to include
at least one lecture, each quarter
in each of the following fields:
scie nee, literature, and world
events. This quarter world af
fairs (Israel, France, Commu
nism) and controversial social is
sues (abortion, capital punish

ment) squeezed out the science
program. The quality of the lec
tures and their timeliness com
pensated for this lack.
A topic which was not over
worked, on the other hand, was
that of J. Christopher Herold's
talk about his experiences while
working on his prize-winning bi
ography of Madame de Stael. This
led lire was in some ways the wit
tiest of the quarter, with some
most acute and amusing observa
tions on human nature by I lei old.
Autumn Series
The Tuesday Series Committee
is planning to continue to use
local talent. One of the lectures
already scheduled for next fall is
"The Influence of Darwin on Eng
lish Literature," a talk by Wil
liam Irvine of the English depart
ment, commemorating the centen
nial of "The Origin of Species."
Other speakers will include A 1
bert J. Guerard, professor of Eng
lish at Harvard University; and
Harold C. Urey, a Nobel prize
winner in the field of geochem
istry.
In the future the consistently

high-quality program, such as was
organized for this spring quarter,
should be planned for the fall,
when students are slightly less
harassed and the freshmen might
be added to an increased following
for the Series.
