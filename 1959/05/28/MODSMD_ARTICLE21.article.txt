# Thrill of the Year: Big Game
## ...and 80,000 Hearts Stopped! 
### Bob Payne Sports Editor 
The "so-so" records notwith
standing- it has been a year of
many great sports thrills for
Stanford fans.
Such as that long-awaited foot
hall victory, the basketball win
over California which was the
national champion Bears' last
win over California which was
the national champion Bears' last
defeat (or the cage wins over
Washington, UCLA and South
ern Cal), the come-from-behind
baseball wins over Cal, Ernie
Cunliffe's sensational triumph in
the PCC 880-yard final, the golf
triumph over USC.
Most satisfying perhaps was
the well-earned hoop victory over
California in January. But all of
these moments are unspectacu
lar runners-up.
Itig Game
An old tinier might cringe at
the thought of the thought of a
Big dame loss being Stanford's
"Thrill of the Year." But Big
Came, 1958, got the near-unani
mous nod of the Daily sports
staff as the most thrilling sports
happening of the year.
More specifically, you might
say that the thrill came one min
ute and .'JO seconds from the end
of thai classic. And it stopped
the hearts of more than 81,000 fa
natics who had already been
treated to a brilliant battle.
In those memorable closing
moments, senior end Joel Freis
scooted into the Cal secondary,
cut for the sidelines, beat the
Bear defenders to a little lowei j
corner of the end zone, and there
took a perfect pass from Dick j
Norman for an unforgettable
touchdown that almost popped |
Cal's rags-to riches bubble.
Greatest Kver
The old sportswriters who were
accustomed to writing reams of
copy about how no Big Game
could match that one played in
1024, or 19-17, or 1953, were now
revising their masterpieces to
read that this, too, was one of
the greatest Big Games- ever.
Stanford missed its try at a
two-point conversion and the vic
tory. Cal won, 16-15. Outsiders
might have called this a moral !
victory for the Tribe. It was in j
that the Indians themselves and J

their followers knew Stanford
had won. But there was no joy
in Stanfordville because of an
"almost."
Cal had won Big Game and
was going to the Rose Bowl,
Stanford had scored two touch
downs and a field goal, Cal had
two touchdowns.
It also 'goes back to the first
quarter when referee Butch Si
mas said thai Stanford's Irv Nik
olai had been out of the end /one
when he caught a pass that
would have given the Cards a
two - pointer after their first,
touchdown.
Nikolai and the Indians on the
scene put up an awful protest.
And then all Stanfordites, Wash
ington Staters, Southern Califor
nians, and Oregon Staters, and
most interested parties, put up
an awful protest when pictures

| wore published to -almost conclu
svely prove that Nikolai was
well in the end /.one with the
football tucked under his arm.
Someone had said during the
week, "This is the kind ol' year
i that Stanford wins the Big
Game."
Underdog for a change l , the
j Tribe was showing signs of life
after what had been a pretty un
! speetaeuar season. And, as if il
! really was Big Game, the team
was inspired, the students were
inspired, and the Bay Area was
; out of its mind.
Maybe it wall because of the
I creeping sentiment that Cal had
no right to be leading the FCC
j and about to play in the Rose
' Bowl. Bear fans were especially
j leery of this Big Game, too, be
lt can't be heart-breaking un
less it is such an "almost." Heart
breakers aren't "moral victories"
â€”but they'll never be forgotten.
Truly, this was the most exciting
! moment in Stanford sports for
I 1958 59.
And there couldn't have been
I any doubting among the 81,000
| fans that left Memorial Stadium
! that historic fall afternoon . . .
I Big Game surely is the greatest
i gridiron rivalry.

cause it was beginning to look
like USC and VVSC were, at this
late date in the season, the best
teams in the conference.
Stanford was the best team in
the conference that day. But
Stanford lost.
One of the most heart-break
ing defeats in Card history. . . .
