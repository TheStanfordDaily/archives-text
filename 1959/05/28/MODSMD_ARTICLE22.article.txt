A second - place finish in the
CIBA with a pre-season cellar
picked team was the principal
reason that Card baseball coach
Dutch Fehring was elected as

The Stanford Daily's Coach of
the Year.
Coach Fehring highly praised
his team, deeming them one of
Stanford's all-time greats be
cause of their all-out efforts in
winning nine of 11 contests do

cided by one run and grabbing
many come â€¢ from - behind victo
ries.
The '59 team, with a 9-7 loop
record, came within one victory
of tying the Indian Pacific Coast
Championship team of 1953 and
this year's seniors have never
played on a losing ball club.
"This was my most enjoyable
season in four years," remarked
Fehring. "because every boy was
trying all the time."
Coach Fehring graduated from
Purdue in 1934 and came to Stan
ford in 1949 as assistant baseball
coach under Everett Dean. In
1955 Fehring took over the head
coaching spot and his teams have
composed an 85-48-1 record in his
foui - years at the helm.
Although the Indians lost to
SC and split their series with
Cal, their decisive victories over
Santa Clara and UCLA gained
the runner-up spot and a possible
NCAA play-off berth was men
tioned.
However, recent rulings have
enabled NCAA-ineligible USC to
represent the Southern Division
in the play-offs for the PCC title,
hut the Northern Division leader,
Washington, will represent the
PCC in the NCAA play-offs.
Besides his season coaching
job, Fehring has conducted sev
eral coaching clinics with little
leaguers and high school boys in
the summer and last winter quar
ter.
