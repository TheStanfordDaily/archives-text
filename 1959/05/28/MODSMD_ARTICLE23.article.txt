# Spiker Bell Chosen Frosh Top Athlete
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
Don Bell, the brawny frosh
track star who broke the 10-year
old Stanford freshman discus
record three times this year, is
The Daily's choice as frosh ath
lete of the year.
In 1950 one of the most cele
brated of all Indian stars, Bob
Mat bias, hurled the discus 157-3
to set a frosh record that wiih
stood all challengers until Bell
arrived on the scene.
This versatile athlete (ho also
puts the shot and runs the hur
dles) flirted with Mathias' rec
ord for the better part of the
season until on April 24 he broke
it. His ditance was l. r V7-f> , -iÂ».
This was only the beginning.
In the Little Big Meet against
the Cal frosh May 2, Bell was out
to 158-5, breaking his own week
old record and at the same time
smashing Mathias' Little
Meet record by nearly five feet.
Al the West Coast Belays May
!) at Fresno, Bell came through
with what is the best individual
performance of the year by a
freshman athlete. He flipped the
disc 102 1%, nearly four feet over
his own best and close to six feel
belter than Mathias ever threw
as a freshman.
Although Bell's discus efforts
must rank as the best frosh per
formances of the year, several
other freshman stars are worthy
of mention.
Still in track, the fine half-mile
times turned in by Rich Klier
and the great broad jumping of
Dan Moore were also highlights
of the Papooses' cinder season.
