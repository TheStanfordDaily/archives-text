# We're Forced To Study, Too
## 
### 
Comes dead week, and with
it, the only opportunity of the
quarter for Daily staffers to
I get any studying done.
This opportunity comes he
cause there is no paper to put
out â€” tomorrow's issue being
the last of Volume 185.
Announcements of activities
during the rest of the quarter
should be delivered to the Daily
shack by 3 p.m. today.
