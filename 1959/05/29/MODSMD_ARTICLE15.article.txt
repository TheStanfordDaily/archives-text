# CHAPPIES' SPOOF
## 'Crash Comics' Form Jokesters' Last Thrust 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
NOW THAT the end of the year has finally rolled around, the
Chappies are leaving their final, parting thrust at campus life—in
the form of their annual Crash Comics- to llie student body next.
Wednesday.
Crash Comics are the Chappies' spoof, annually, of any comic strip

worth reading, though each year
Ihe chara c t e r s arc twisted
around to somehow relate to
Stanford life.
Some of the comics arc good
this time; some are not.
Traditionally, the Little Men
take their pokes at Ihe Penin
sula's Only, but somehow the
jokes about The Daily don't seem
quite so funny. Perhaps it's just
over-use?
Using deformed copies of the
characters of Pogo, Dondi, Li'l
Orphan Annie, The Queen (oops,
sorry, Freudian slip), The Katz
enjammcr Kids, Dennis the Men
ace, Peanuts and Nancy, the
Chappies comment wryly on ev
erything from freshman women
through Fun Stan and wimps to
pledge classes.
Printed on the inside front cov
er are the words to their prize
winning (and what kind of a
prize could they win?) Spring
Sing songs.
But we have our fun, too, and
as a parting gesture lo the Chap
pies, wo leave this (tune of "O
Tannenbaum"):
Oh Chappie men, oh Chappie
men,
Though crude your little biz is,
We break our code lo share
your load —
Free advertising this is.
Crash Comics will be on sale
Wednesday for 35 cents.
