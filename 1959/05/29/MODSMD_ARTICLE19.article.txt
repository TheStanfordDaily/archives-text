# Two Kinds of Students Present at Stanford
## 
### Leo Krulitz, Editor 
It's always interesting, when
someone has studied a group of
which you are a part, to see how
the findings stack up with what
you would expect.
Such is the case with a recent
study of "the silent generation"
of college students which is sum
marized in an article in "The Na
tion" (May 16, 1959) by Edward
D. Eddy, provost of the Univer
sity of New Hampshire. The ar
ticle is one of six in Nation's
'Campus Report Number 3 - Ten
sion Beneath Apathy."
Eddy sums up the findings
with the comment that "the stu
dent is a 'p al ' ac to x in parenthe
sis.' "
Set Apart
The parenthesis part of his
comment simply suggests that
college years are years set apart
and unconnected with the totality
of a person's life the paradoxes
he has found in students and the
recommendation he makes to re
solve them are far more interest
ing.
He suggests these live para
doxes:
1. "Beneath the student's stud
ied pretense of indifference and
apathy lies an unfashionable but
searching desire for meaning.
2. "It's fashionable to be busy
—but busyness is often more im
portant than the achievement.
3. "While wanting to know
what he should know, the stu
dent protests that he should have
increasing opportunity to think
and act for himself.
4. "Keenly interested in expe
riencing the totality of life and
knowledge, the student often re
acts by preferring to compart
mentalize his own life and knowl
edge.
5. "While respecting and hon
oring the adult who has explicit
convictions, the student prefers
to hide his own in the shelter of
the group."
Concludes
Eddy summarizes and con
cludes—with regard to the last
paradox at least—that "The stu
dent is ready for a more search
ing and strenuous education ex
perience, but the colleges have
not fully recognized, nor are
they fully prepared to meet, this
potential challenge . . . The fail
ure of the student to respond is
basically the failure of the col
lege to challenge."
Does this describe the Stan
ford student and Stanford as a
university? Not quite, 1 think,
because in reality there are two
Stanford students. The first is
probably accurately defined by
these five conclusions—allowing
for a variation of intensity—and
far outnumbers the second kind
of student. This second student
is the one who has resolved these
paradoxes.
This is the student- and he ex

ists on every other campus—who
has dropped the pretense of indif
ference and conducts his search
for meaning in the open, who has
replaced busyness with achieve
ment by carefully selecting the
activities in which he partici
pates, and by taking advantage,
at Stanford at least, of the di
rected reading courses, the semi
nars or a complete honors pro
gram.
This is the student who can't
be tuld what to "know," who does
think in terms of the tutality of
life and knowledge, and the stu
dent who doesn't hesitate to
openly voice a conviction.
While Eddy technically allows
for this second kind of student
by carefully qualifying his terms,
the writer suggests it is impor
tant to make this distinction ex
plicit for several reasons:
Honors Programs
First, here at least, the special
honors programs and courses
that have been established to ac
commodate the second student
seem to indicate that the univer
sity has recognized that some
students are ready for "a more
searching and strenuous educa
tional experience."
Second, the question then aris
es, it this readiness is recognized,
why hasn't the university "chal
lenged" all its students and
brought them into such programs
as these, emphasizing individual
work ?
While some might maintain
that this hasn't been done be
cause of the cost involved in
honors programs, the writer feels
that the crux of the problem is
that no one really knows how to
"challenge" the student.
Not Enough
It isn't enough for Eddy to
charge universities with a "fail
ure to challenge." The writer
feels it would be more to the
point to suggest how this can be
done.
flow can this be done? llow
can we do it at Stanford; how can
we turn the first kind of student
into the second? How can we
communicate to Eddy's "unchal
lenged" students "the sense that
learning is important for learn
ing's sake," as President Sterling
has put it?
The only way to awaken aca
demically a student who is ca
pable of being awakened is by a
contact of an undefinable nature
between faculty member and stu
dent, student and student, or
even book and student. No one
can specify what must be said—
if we could the problem would be
completely solved.
"Expectancy"
But we can place the student in
an "atmosphere of expectancy,"
so to speak. If we can't say how
this challenge, this awakening,
will happen, at least we can say
that the student can uxpect some
thing to happen. If this expec

tancy can be developed in stu
dents, they will then be seeking
out that challenge and it will be
much less likely to slip by them.
The battle will be mostly won.
In many cases no challenge
will be sufficient to awaken the
student- the paradoxes will go
unresolved.
Our academic program is rap
idly approaching a point of ex
cellence—if our students aren't
capable of taking advantage of it,
then the value of it is lost.
How, then, do we go about cre
ating this "atmosphere of expect
ing" or improving the little of it
we have now?
There is no established for
mula-about all the writer can
do is make a lew specific sugges
tions. To keep the problem in its
proper perspective, it might be
desirable to point out the factors
that oppose such an "atmos
phere." The most significant ones
revolve about the makeup of the
student body, itself.
Stanford is the school for the
bright, intelligent children of the
"nouveaux riches" of Western
America. Many of the new rich
are Stanford graduates—gradu
ates of a University that w;is
marked in their generation as the
country-club school.
Parents Maintain
This is the image of Stanford
that they maintain, though we
have long since lost the "country
club" character. The point here
is that this is how the parents of
potential Stanford students still
remember the school—and they
pass this expectancy on to their
children.
My Managing Editor describes
the incoming students as the
"golden children" of the West,
the point being that such a make
up leaves the student body defi
cient of people who have expe
rienced the harder realities of life
—want, disappointment, disgust,
personal pagedy, etc. •
The geographic makeup also
limits us to an overwhelming
representation of the Western
American culture. The writer is
told, and suspects, that there is a
marked difference in the East
and South.
Obvious Place
The most obvious place to start
creating this "atmosphere of ex
pectancy" is in the contact be
tween the University and these
students through the literature a
student receives both before and
alter- his acceptance.
After digging up as much of
the information as possible that
has gone to or will go to next

year's students, and looking
through the information that has
been sent in the past, I'm con
vinced that a good starting point
would be to revamp much of it.
This period when a student is
first entering the University is
the most fruitful lime to build
his expectancies. A letter- from
the ASSU with a salutation of
"Hello Indian," a booklet on
freshman women's housing with
a title like "The Branner Man
ner," and a booklet that goes into
meticulous detail about campus
activities and contains quaint pic
tures of Indians here and there
doesn't contribute much to an
"atmosphere of expectancy."
Pre-Reg Week
Likewise during Pre-Reg Week
further lasting first impressions
are made. Speakers during this
week from President Sterling on
down have their first opportunity
to contribute to an "atmosphere
of expectancy." This opportunity
is passed up far too often iir fa
vor- of jokes about the girls being
here for husbands and how stu
dents are always to feel free to
come into their respective offices.
One sponsor described the Pre-
Reg program as an insult to the
freshmen's intelligence - and
part of it is.
The program might be expand
ed to include attending such
things as the first Tuesday Se
ries. Another writer has suggest
ed introductory discussion ses
sions with the faculty on impor
tant academic topics: "interna
tional relations," "what is art?"
etc.
Sterling Speak
President Sterling might speak
to the students once a year in
assembly—as a thinker and an
educator, instead of as an admin
istrator. Likewise, it would be
good to hear Dean .Rhinelander—
and others—speaking on matters
of academic importance to Stan
ford.
This might be organized into a
regular occurrence once a quar
ter. The changes constantly tak
ing place irr Stanford's academic
outlook generate an excitement,
and an expectancy, irr them
selves. These things are very sel
dom communicated to students
until the change is an accom
plished fact.
Current Problems
More editorial comment by
teachers in classes on current
academic problems might also
help. This isn't to suggest that
professors should sacrifice a lot
of class time for this sort of
thing, but an off-hand comment

or two in passing is certainly wel
come.
Students might pre - register
just once a year after a good con
ference with their 1 adviser instead
of three times and only make
such changes in their year's pro
gram as seem necessary as they
go along.
A good way is also needed for
students to communicate to pro
fessors whether or not the pro
fessor's* c o u r s e is "coming
across." A good questionnaire at
a course's completion might be
of some help, it satisfactory ques
tions can be devised.
Professors with small seminar
courses might consider the possi
bility of a weekend at the Napa
cabin. Such ;i weekend might be
particularly useful in laying the
groundwork for a course.
A suggestion that has appeared
before in The Daily might be
mentioned again a guide to San
Francisco. This certainly would
improve the "atmosphere of ex
pectancy," of this excellent cul

tural and social center.
Libraries in each house might
also be mentioned again.
Writing is an excellent way for
a student to organize his think
ing. The Bridge is an example
of what can be done in the way
of publishing such writing it
should come out more often.

These are a few suggestions
the writer is sure there are many
more. There is no solution to the
problem of changing Stanford
students into students who will
be "learning for lear ning's sake."
perhaps by placing them in
an "atmosphere of expectancy,"
they'll make that change them
selves.

istrator. Likewise, it would be
good to hear Dean .Rhinelander—
and others—speaking on matters
of academic importance to Stan
ford.
This might be organized into a
regular occurrence once a quar
ter. The changes constantly tak
ing place irr Stanford's academic
outlook generate an excitement,
and an expectancy, irr them
selves. These things are very sel
dom communicated to students
until the change is an accom
plished fact.
Current Problems
More editorial comment by
teachers in classes on current
academic problems might also
help. This isn't to suggest that
professors should sacrifice a lot
of class time for this sort of
thing, but an off-hand comment

or two in passing is certainly wel
come.
Students might pre - register
just once a year after a good con
ference with their 1 adviser instead
of three times and only make
such changes in their year's pro
gram as seem necessary as they
go along.
A good way is also needed for
students to communicate to pro
fessors whether or not the pro
fessor's* c o u r s e is "coming
across." A good questionnaire at
a course's completion might be
of some help, it satisfactory ques
tions can be devised.
Professors with small seminar
courses might consider the possi
bility of a weekend at the Napa
cabin. Such ;i weekend might be
particularly useful in laying the
groundwork for a course.
A suggestion that has appeared
before in The Daily might be
mentioned again a guide to San
Francisco. This certainly would
improve the "atmosphere of ex
pectancy," of this excellent cul

tural and social center.
Libraries in each house might
also be mentioned again.
Writing is an excellent way for
a student to organize his think
ing. The Bridge is an example
of what can be done in the way
of publishing such writing it
should come out more often.

These are a few suggestions
the writer is sure there are many
more. There is no solution to the
problem of changing Stanford
students into students who will
be "learning for lear ning's sake."
perhaps by placing them in
an "atmosphere of expectancy,"
they'll make that change them
selves.
It's always interesting, when
someone has studied a group of
which you are a part, to see how
the findings stack up with what
you would expect.
Such is the case with a recent
study of "the silent generation"
of college students which is sum
marized in an article in "The Na
tion" (May 16, 1959) by Edward
D. Eddy, provost of the Univer
sity of New Hampshire. The ar
ticle is one of six in Nation's
'Campus Report Number 3 - Ten
sion Beneath Apathy."
Eddy sums up the findings
with the comment that "the stu
dent is a 'p al ' ac to x in parenthe
sis.' "
Set Apart
The parenthesis part of his
comment simply suggests that
college years are years set apart
and unconnected with the totality
of a person's life the paradoxes
he has found in students and the
recommendation he makes to re
solve them are far more interest
ing.
He suggests these live para
doxes:
1. "Beneath the student's stud
ied pretense of indifference and
apathy lies an unfashionable but
searching desire for meaning.
2. "It's fashionable to be busy
—but busyness is often more im
portant than the achievement.
3. "While wanting to know
what he should know, the stu
dent protests that he should have
increasing opportunity to think
and act for himself.
4. "Keenly interested in expe
riencing the totality of life and
knowledge, the student often re
acts by preferring to compart
mentalize his own life and knowl
edge.
5. "While respecting and hon
oring the adult who has explicit
convictions, the student prefers
to hide his own in the shelter of
the group."
Concludes
Eddy summarizes and con
cludes—with regard to the last
paradox at least—that "The stu
dent is ready for a more search
ing and strenuous education ex
perience, but the colleges have
not fully recognized, nor are
they fully prepared to meet, this
potential challenge . . . The fail
ure of the student to respond is
basically the failure of the col
lege to challenge."
Does this describe the Stan
ford student and Stanford as a
university? Not quite, 1 think,
because in reality there are two
Stanford students. The first is
probably accurately defined by
these five conclusions—allowing
for a variation of intensity—and
far outnumbers the second kind
of student. This second student
is the one who has resolved these
paradoxes.
This is the student- and he ex

ists on every other campus—who
has dropped the pretense of indif
ference and conducts his search
for meaning in the open, who has
replaced busyness with achieve
ment by carefully selecting the
activities in which he partici
pates, and by taking advantage,
at Stanford at least, of the di
rected reading courses, the semi
nars or a complete honors pro
gram.
This is the student who can't
be tuld what to "know," who does
think in terms of the tutality of
life and knowledge, and the stu
dent who doesn't hesitate to
openly voice a conviction.
While Eddy technically allows
for this second kind of student
by carefully qualifying his terms,
the writer suggests it is impor
tant to make this distinction ex
plicit for several reasons:
Honors Programs
First, here at least, the special
honors programs and courses
that have been established to ac
commodate the second student
seem to indicate that the univer
sity has recognized that some
students are ready for "a more
searching and strenuous educa
tional experience."
Second, the question then aris
es, it this readiness is recognized,
why hasn't the university "chal
lenged" all its students and
brought them into such programs
as these, emphasizing individual
work ?
While some might maintain
that this hasn't been done be
cause of the cost involved in
honors programs, the writer feels
that the crux of the problem is
that no one really knows how to
"challenge" the student.
Not Enough
It isn't enough for Eddy to
charge universities with a "fail
ure to challenge." The writer
feels it would be more to the
point to suggest how this can be
done.
flow can this be done? llow
can we do it at Stanford; how can
we turn the first kind of student
into the second? How can we
communicate to Eddy's "unchal
lenged" students "the sense that
learning is important for learn
ing's sake," as President Sterling
has put it?
The only way to awaken aca
demically a student who is ca
pable of being awakened is by a
contact of an undefinable nature
between faculty member and stu
dent, student and student, or
even book and student. No one
can specify what must be said—
if we could the problem would be
completely solved.
"Expectancy"
But we can place the student in
an "atmosphere of expectancy,"
so to speak. If we can't say how
this challenge, this awakening,
will happen, at least we can say
that the student can uxpect some
thing to happen. If this expec

tancy can be developed in stu
dents, they will then be seeking
out that challenge and it will be
much less likely to slip by them.
The battle will be mostly won.
In many cases no challenge
will be sufficient to awaken the
student- the paradoxes will go
unresolved.
Our academic program is rap
idly approaching a point of ex
cellence—if our students aren't
capable of taking advantage of it,
then the value of it is lost.
How, then, do we go about cre
ating this "atmosphere of expect
ing" or improving the little of it
we have now?
There is no established for
mula-about all the writer can
do is make a lew specific sugges
tions. To keep the problem in its
proper perspective, it might be
desirable to point out the factors
that oppose such an "atmos
phere." The most significant ones
revolve about the makeup of the
student body, itself.
Stanford is the school for the
bright, intelligent children of the
"nouveaux riches" of Western
America. Many of the new rich
are Stanford graduates—gradu
ates of a University that w;is
marked in their generation as the
country-club school.
Parents Maintain
This is the image of Stanford
that they maintain, though we
have long since lost the "country
club" character. The point here
is that this is how the parents of
potential Stanford students still
remember the school—and they
pass this expectancy on to their
children.
My Managing Editor describes
the incoming students as the
"golden children" of the West,
the point being that such a make
up leaves the student body defi
cient of people who have expe
rienced the harder realities of life
—want, disappointment, disgust,
personal pagedy, etc. •
The geographic makeup also
limits us to an overwhelming
representation of the Western
American culture. The writer is
told, and suspects, that there is a
marked difference in the East
and South.
Obvious Place
The most obvious place to start
creating this "atmosphere of ex
pectancy" is in the contact be
tween the University and these
students through the literature a
student receives both before and
alter- his acceptance.
After digging up as much of
the information as possible that
has gone to or will go to next

year's students, and looking
through the information that has
been sent in the past, I'm con
vinced that a good starting point
would be to revamp much of it.
This period when a student is
first entering the University is
the most fruitful lime to build
his expectancies. A letter- from
the ASSU with a salutation of
"Hello Indian," a booklet on
freshman women's housing with
a title like "The Branner Man
ner," and a booklet that goes into
meticulous detail about campus
activities and contains quaint pic
tures of Indians here and there
doesn't contribute much to an
"atmosphere of expectancy."
Pre-Reg Week
Likewise during Pre-Reg Week
further lasting first impressions
are made. Speakers during this
week from President Sterling on
down have their first opportunity
to contribute to an "atmosphere
of expectancy." This opportunity
is passed up far too often iir fa
vor- of jokes about the girls being
here for husbands and how stu
dents are always to feel free to
come into their respective offices.
One sponsor described the Pre-
Reg program as an insult to the
freshmen's intelligence - and
part of it is.
The program might be expand
ed to include attending such
things as the first Tuesday Se
ries. Another writer has suggest
ed introductory discussion ses
sions with the faculty on impor
tant academic topics: "interna
tional relations," "what is art?"
etc.
Sterling Speak
President Sterling might speak
to the students once a year in
assembly—as a thinker and an
educator, instead of as an admin
istrator. Likewise, it would be
good to hear Dean .Rhinelander—
and others—speaking on matters
of academic importance to Stan
ford.
This might be organized into a

rienced the harder realities of life
—want, disappointment, disgust,
personal pagedy, etc. •
The geographic makeup also
limits us to an overwhelming
representation of the Western
American culture. The writer is
told, and suspects, that there is a
marked difference in the East
and South.
Obvious Place
The most obvious place to start
creating this "atmosphere of ex
pectancy" is in the contact be
tween the University and these
students through the literature a
student receives both before and
alter- his acceptance.
After digging up as much of
the information as possible that
has gone to or will go to next

year's students, and looking
through the information that has
been sent in the past, I'm con
vinced that a good starting point
would be to revamp much of it.
This period when a student is
first entering the University is
the most fruitful lime to build
his expectancies. A letter- from
the ASSU with a salutation of
"Hello Indian," a booklet on
freshman women's housing with
a title like "The Branner Man
ner," and a booklet that goes into
meticulous detail about campus
activities and contains quaint pic
tures of Indians here and there
doesn't contribute much to an
"atmosphere of expectancy."
Pre-Reg Week
Likewise during Pre-Reg Week
further lasting first impressions
are made. Speakers during this
week from President Sterling on
down have their first opportunity
to contribute to an "atmosphere
of expectancy." This opportunity
is passed up far too often iir fa
vor- of jokes about the girls being
here for husbands and how stu
dents are always to feel free to
come into their respective offices.
One sponsor described the Pre-
Reg program as an insult to the
freshmen's intelligence - and
part of it is.
The program might be expand
ed to include attending such
things as the first Tuesday Se
ries. Another writer has suggest
ed introductory discussion ses
sions with the faculty on impor
tant academic topics: "interna
tional relations," "what is art?"
etc.
Sterling Speak
President Sterling might speak
to the students once a year in
assembly—as a thinker and an
educator, instead of as an admin
istrator. Likewise, it would be
good to hear Dean .Rhinelander—
and others—speaking on matters
of academic importance to Stan
ford.
This might be organized into a
regular occurrence once a quar
ter. The changes constantly tak
ing place irr Stanford's academic
outlook generate an excitement,
and an expectancy, irr them
selves. These things are very sel
dom communicated to students
until the change is an accom
plished fact.
Current Problems
More editorial comment by
teachers in classes on current
academic problems might also
help. This isn't to suggest that
professors should sacrifice a lot
of class time for this sort of
thing, but an off-hand comment

or two in passing is certainly wel
come.
Students might pre - register
just once a year after a good con
ference with their 1 adviser instead
of three times and only make
such changes in their year's pro
gram as seem necessary as they
go along.
A good way is also needed for
students to communicate to pro
fessors whether or not the pro
fessor's* c o u r s e is "coming
across." A good questionnaire at
a course's completion might be
of some help, it satisfactory ques
tions can be devised.
Professors with small seminar
courses might consider the possi
bility of a weekend at the Napa
cabin. Such ;i weekend might be
particularly useful in laying the
groundwork for a course.
A suggestion that has appeared
before in The Daily might be
mentioned again a guide to San
Francisco. This certainly would
improve the "atmosphere of ex
pectancy," of this excellent cul

tural and social center.
Libraries in each house might
also be mentioned again.
Writing is an excellent way for
a student to organize his think
ing. The Bridge is an example
of what can be done in the way
of publishing such writing it
should come out more often.

These are a few suggestions
the writer is sure there are many
more. There is no solution to the
problem of changing Stanford
students into students who will
be "learning for lear ning's sake."
perhaps by placing them in
an "atmosphere of expectancy,"
they'll make that change them
selves.
It's always interesting, when
someone has studied a group of
which you are a part, to see how
the findings stack up with what
you would expect.
Such is the case with a recent
study of "the silent generation"
of college students which is sum
marized in an article in "The Na
tion" (May 16, 1959) by Edward
D. Eddy, provost of the Univer
sity of New Hampshire. The ar
ticle is one of six in Nation's
'Campus Report Number 3 - Ten
sion Beneath Apathy."
Eddy sums up the findings
with the comment that "the stu
dent is a 'p al ' ac to x in parenthe
sis.' "
Set Apart
The parenthesis part of his
comment simply suggests that
college years are years set apart
and unconnected with the totality
of a person's life the paradoxes
he has found in students and the
recommendation he makes to re
solve them are far more interest
ing.
He suggests these live para
doxes:
1. "Beneath the student's stud
ied pretense of indifference and
apathy lies an unfashionable but
searching desire for meaning.
2. "It's fashionable to be busy
—but busyness is often more im
portant than the achievement.
3. "While wanting to know
what he should know, the stu
dent protests that he should have
increasing opportunity to think
and act for himself.
4. "Keenly interested in expe
riencing the totality of life and
knowledge, the student often re
acts by preferring to compart
mentalize his own life and knowl
edge.
5. "While respecting and hon
oring the adult who has explicit
convictions, the student prefers
to hide his own in the shelter of
the group."
Concludes
Eddy summarizes and con
cludes—with regard to the last
paradox at least—that "The stu
dent is ready for a more search
ing and strenuous education ex
perience, but the colleges have
not fully recognized, nor are
they fully prepared to meet, this
potential challenge . . . The fail
ure of the student to respond is
basically the failure of the col
lege to challenge."
Does this describe the Stan
ford student and Stanford as a
university? Not quite, 1 think,
because in reality there are two
Stanford students. The first is
probably accurately defined by
these five conclusions—allowing
for a variation of intensity—and
far outnumbers the second kind
of student. This second student
is the one who has resolved these
paradoxes.
This is the student- and he ex

ists on every other campus—who
has dropped the pretense of indif
ference and conducts his search
for meaning in the open, who has
replaced busyness with achieve
ment by carefully selecting the
activities in which he partici
pates, and by taking advantage,
at Stanford at least, of the di
rected reading courses, the semi
nars or a complete honors pro
gram.
This is the student who can't
be tuld what to "know," who does
think in terms of the tutality of
life and knowledge, and the stu
dent who doesn't hesitate to
openly voice a conviction.
While Eddy technically allows
for this second kind of student
by carefully qualifying his terms,
the writer suggests it is impor
tant to make this distinction ex
plicit for several reasons:
Honors Programs
First, here at least, the special
honors programs and courses
that have been established to ac
commodate the second student
seem to indicate that the univer
sity has recognized that some
students are ready for "a more
searching and strenuous educa
tional experience."
Second, the question then aris
es, it this readiness is recognized,
why hasn't the university "chal
lenged" all its students and
brought them into such programs
as these, emphasizing individual
work ?
While some might maintain
that this hasn't been done be
cause of the cost involved in
honors programs, the writer feels
that the crux of the problem is
that no one really knows how to
"challenge" the student.
Not Enough
It isn't enough for Eddy to
charge universities with a "fail
ure to challenge." The writer
feels it would be more to the
point to suggest how this can be
done.
flow can this be done? llow
can we do it at Stanford; how can
we turn the first kind of student
into the second? How can we
communicate to Eddy's "unchal
lenged" students "the sense that
learning is important for learn
ing's sake," as President Sterling
has put it?
The only way to awaken aca
demically a student who is ca
pable of being awakened is by a
contact of an undefinable nature
between faculty member and stu
dent, student and student, or
even book and student. No one
can specify what must be said—
if we could the problem would be
completely solved.
"Expectancy"
But we can place the student in
an "atmosphere of expectancy,"
so to speak. If we can't say how
this challenge, this awakening,
will happen, at least we can say
that the student can uxpect some
thing to happen. If this expec

tancy can be developed in stu
dents, they will then be seeking
out that challenge and it will be
much less likely to slip by them.
The battle will be mostly won.
In many cases no challenge
will be sufficient to awaken the
student- the paradoxes will go
unresolved.
Our academic program is rap
idly approaching a point of ex
cellence—if our students aren't
capable of taking advantage of it,
then the value of it is lost.
How, then, do we go about cre
ating this "atmosphere of expect
ing" or improving the little of it
we have now?
There is no established for
mula-about all the writer can
do is make a lew specific sugges
tions. To keep the problem in its
proper perspective, it might be
desirable to point out the factors
that oppose such an "atmos
phere." The most significant ones
revolve about the makeup of the
student body, itself.
Stanford is the school for the
bright, intelligent children of the
"nouveaux riches" of Western
America. Many of the new rich
are Stanford graduates—gradu
ates of a University that w;is
marked in their generation as the
country-club school.
Parents Maintain
This is the image of Stanford
that they maintain, though we
have long since lost the "country
club" character. The point here
is that this is how the parents of
potential Stanford students still
remember the school—and they
pass this expectancy on to their
children.
My Managing Editor describes
the incoming students as the
"golden children" of the West,
the point being that such a make
up leaves the student body defi
cient of people who have expe
rienced the harder realities of life
—want, disappointment, disgust,
personal pagedy, etc. •
The geographic makeup also
limits us to an overwhelming
representation of the Western
American culture. The writer is
told, and suspects, that there is a
marked difference in the East
and South.

pable of being awakened is by a
contact of an undefinable nature
between faculty member and stu
dent, student and student, or
even book and student. No one
can specify what must be said—
if we could the problem would be
completely solved.
"Expectancy"
But we can place the student in
an "atmosphere of expectancy,"
so to speak. If we can't say how
this challenge, this awakening,
will happen, at least we can say
that the student can uxpect some
thing to happen. If this expec

tancy can be developed in stu
dents, they will then be seeking
out that challenge and it will be
much less likely to slip by them.
The battle will be mostly won.
In many cases no challenge
will be sufficient to awaken the
student- the paradoxes will go
unresolved.
Our academic program is rap
idly approaching a point of ex
cellence—if our students aren't
capable of taking advantage of it,
then the value of it is lost.
How, then, do we go about cre
ating this "atmosphere of expect
ing" or improving the little of it
we have now?
There is no established for
mula-about all the writer can
do is make a lew specific sugges
tions. To keep the problem in its
proper perspective, it might be
desirable to point out the factors
that oppose such an "atmos
phere." The most significant ones
revolve about the makeup of the
student body, itself.
Stanford is the school for the
bright, intelligent children of the
"nouveaux riches" of Western
America. Many of the new rich
are Stanford graduates—gradu
ates of a University that w;is
marked in their generation as the
country-club school.
Parents Maintain
This is the image of Stanford
that they maintain, though we
have long since lost the "country
club" character. The point here
is that this is how the parents of
potential Stanford students still
remember the school—and they
pass this expectancy on to their
children.
My Managing Editor describes
the incoming students as the
"golden children" of the West,
the point being that such a make
up leaves the student body defi
cient of people who have expe
rienced the harder realities of life
—want, disappointment, disgust,
personal pagedy, etc. •
The geographic makeup also
limits us to an overwhelming
representation of the Western
American culture. The writer is
told, and suspects, that there is a
marked difference in the East
and South.
Obvious Place
The most obvious place to start
creating this "atmosphere of ex
pectancy" is in the contact be
tween the University and these
students through the literature a
student receives both before and
alter- his acceptance.
After digging up as much of
the information as possible that
has gone to or will go to next

year's students, and looking
through the information that has
been sent in the past, I'm con
vinced that a good starting point
would be to revamp much of it.
This period when a student is
first entering the University is
the most fruitful lime to build
his expectancies. A letter- from
the ASSU with a salutation of
"Hello Indian," a booklet on
freshman women's housing with
a title like "The Branner Man
ner," and a booklet that goes into
meticulous detail about campus
activities and contains quaint pic
tures of Indians here and there
doesn't contribute much to an
"atmosphere of expectancy."
Pre-Reg Week
Likewise during Pre-Reg Week
further lasting first impressions
are made. Speakers during this
week from President Sterling on
down have their first opportunity
to contribute to an "atmosphere
of expectancy." This opportunity
is passed up far too often iir fa
vor- of jokes about the girls being
here for husbands and how stu
dents are always to feel free to
come into their respective offices.
One sponsor described the Pre-
Reg program as an insult to the
freshmen's intelligence - and
part of it is.
The program might be expand
ed to include attending such
things as the first Tuesday Se
ries. Another writer has suggest
ed introductory discussion ses
sions with the faculty on impor
tant academic topics: "interna
tional relations," "what is art?"
etc.
Sterling Speak
President Sterling might speak
to the students once a year in
assembly—as a thinker and an
educator, instead of as an admin
istrator. Likewise, it would be
good to hear Dean .Rhinelander—
and others—speaking on matters
of academic importance to Stan
ford.
This might be organized into a
regular occurrence once a quar
ter. The changes constantly tak
ing place irr Stanford's academic
outlook generate an excitement,
and an expectancy, irr them
selves. These things are very sel
dom communicated to students
until the change is an accom
plished fact.
Current Problems
More editorial comment by
teachers in classes on current
academic problems might also
help. This isn't to suggest that
professors should sacrifice a lot
of class time for this sort of
thing, but an off-hand comment

or two in passing is certainly wel
come.
Students might pre - register
just once a year after a good con
ference with their 1 adviser instead
of three times and only make
such changes in their year's pro
gram as seem necessary as they
go along.
A good way is also needed for
students to communicate to pro
fessors whether or not the pro
fessor's* c o u r s e is "coming
across." A good questionnaire at
a course's completion might be
of some help, it satisfactory ques
tions can be devised.
Professors with small seminar
courses might consider the possi
bility of a weekend at the Napa
cabin. Such ;i weekend might be
particularly useful in laying the
groundwork for a course.
A suggestion that has appeared
before in The Daily might be
mentioned again a guide to San
Francisco. This certainly would
improve the "atmosphere of ex
pectancy," of this excellent cul

tural and social center.
Libraries in each house might
also be mentioned again.
Writing is an excellent way for
a student to organize his think
ing. The Bridge is an example
of what can be done in the way
of publishing such writing it
should come out more often.

These are a few suggestions
the writer is sure there are many
more. There is no solution to the
problem of changing Stanford
students into students who will
be "learning for lear ning's sake."
perhaps by placing them in
an "atmosphere of expectancy,"
they'll make that change them
selves.
It's always interesting, when
someone has studied a group of
which you are a part, to see how
the findings stack up with what
you would expect.
Such is the case with a recent
study of "the silent generation"
of college students which is sum
marized in an article in "The Na
tion" (May 16, 1959) by Edward
D. Eddy, provost of the Univer
sity of New Hampshire. The ar
ticle is one of six in Nation's
'Campus Report Number 3 - Ten
sion Beneath Apathy."
Eddy sums up the findings
with the comment that "the stu
dent is a 'p al ' ac to x in parenthe
sis.' "
Set Apart
The parenthesis part of his
comment simply suggests that
college years are years set apart
and unconnected with the totality
of a person's life the paradoxes
he has found in students and the
recommendation he makes to re
solve them are far more interest
ing.
He suggests these live para
doxes:
1. "Beneath the student's stud
ied pretense of indifference and
apathy lies an unfashionable but
searching desire for meaning.
2. "It's fashionable to be busy
—but busyness is often more im
portant than the achievement.
3. "While wanting to know
what he should know, the stu
dent protests that he should have
increasing opportunity to think
and act for himself.
4. "Keenly interested in expe
riencing the totality of life and
knowledge, the student often re
acts by preferring to compart
mentalize his own life and knowl
edge.
5. "While respecting and hon
oring the adult who has explicit
convictions, the student prefers
to hide his own in the shelter of
the group."
Concludes
Eddy summarizes and con
cludes—with regard to the last
paradox at least—that "The stu
dent is ready for a more search
ing and strenuous education ex
perience, but the colleges have
not fully recognized, nor are
they fully prepared to meet, this
potential challenge . . . The fail
ure of the student to respond is
basically the failure of the col
lege to challenge."
Does this describe the Stan
ford student and Stanford as a
university? Not quite, 1 think,
because in reality there are two
Stanford students. The first is
probably accurately defined by
these five conclusions—allowing
for a variation of intensity—and
far outnumbers the second kind
of student. This second student
is the one who has resolved these
paradoxes.
This is the student- and he ex

ists on every other campus—who
has dropped the pretense of indif
ference and conducts his search
for meaning in the open, who has
replaced busyness with achieve
ment by carefully selecting the
activities in which he partici
pates, and by taking advantage,
at Stanford at least, of the di
rected reading courses, the semi
nars or a complete honors pro
gram.
This is the student who can't
be tuld what to "know," who does
think in terms of the tutality of
life and knowledge, and the stu
dent who doesn't hesitate to
openly voice a conviction.
While Eddy technically allows
for this second kind of student
by carefully qualifying his terms,
the writer suggests it is impor
tant to make this distinction ex
plicit for several reasons:
Honors Programs
First, here at least, the special
honors programs and courses
that have been established to ac
commodate the second student
seem to indicate that the univer
sity has recognized that some
students are ready for "a more
searching and strenuous educa
tional experience."
Second, the question then aris
es, it this readiness is recognized,
why hasn't the university "chal
lenged" all its students and
brought them into such programs
as these, emphasizing individual
work ?
While some might maintain
that this hasn't been done be
cause of the cost involved in
honors programs, the writer feels
that the crux of the problem is
that no one really knows how to
"challenge" the student.
Not Enough
It isn't enough for Eddy to
charge universities with a "fail
ure to challenge." The writer
feels it would be more to the
point to suggest how this can be
done.
flow can this be done? llow
can we do it at Stanford; how can
we turn the first kind of student
into the second? How can we
communicate to Eddy's "unchal
lenged" students "the sense that
learning is important for learn
ing's sake," as President Sterling
has put it?
The only way to awaken aca
demically a student who is ca
pable of being awakened is by a
contact of an undefinable nature
between faculty member and stu
dent, student and student, or
even book and student. No one
can specify what must be said—

completely solved.

is the one who has resolved these
paradoxes.
This is the student- and he ex

ists on every other campus—who
has dropped the pretense of indif
ference and conducts his search
for meaning in the open, who has
replaced busyness with achieve
ment by carefully selecting the
activities in which he partici
pates, and by taking advantage,
at Stanford at least, of the di
rected reading courses, the semi
nars or a complete honors pro
gram.
This is the student who can't
be tuld what to "know," who does
think in terms of the tutality of
life and knowledge, and the stu
dent who doesn't hesitate to
openly voice a conviction.
While Eddy technically allows
for this second kind of student
by carefully qualifying his terms,
the writer suggests it is impor
tant to make this distinction ex
plicit for several reasons:
Honors Programs
First, here at least, the special
honors programs and courses
that have been established to ac
commodate the second student
seem to indicate that the univer
sity has recognized that some
students are ready for "a more
searching and strenuous educa
tional experience."
Second, the question then aris
es, it this readiness is recognized,
why hasn't the university "chal
lenged" all its students and
brought them into such programs
as these, emphasizing individual
work ?
While some might maintain
that this hasn't been done be
cause of the cost involved in
honors programs, the writer feels
that the crux of the problem is
that no one really knows how to
"challenge" the student.
Not Enough
It isn't enough for Eddy to
charge universities with a "fail
ure to challenge." The writer
feels it would be more to the
point to suggest how this can be
done.
flow can this be done? llow
can we do it at Stanford; how can
we turn the first kind of student
into the second? How can we
communicate to Eddy's "unchal
lenged" students "the sense that
learning is important for learn
ing's sake," as President Sterling
has put it?
The only way to awaken aca
demically a student who is ca
pable of being awakened is by a
contact of an undefinable nature
between faculty member and stu
dent, student and student, or
even book and student. No one
can specify what must be said—
if we could the problem would be
completely solved.
"Expectancy"
But we can place the student in
an "atmosphere of expectancy,"
so to speak. If we can't say how
this challenge, this awakening,
will happen, at least we can say
that the student can uxpect some
thing to happen. If this expec

tancy can be developed in stu
dents, they will then be seeking
out that challenge and it will be
much less likely to slip by them.
The battle will be mostly won.
In many cases no challenge
will be sufficient to awaken the
student- the paradoxes will go
unresolved.
Our academic program is rap
idly approaching a point of ex
cellence—if our students aren't
capable of taking advantage of it,
then the value of it is lost.
How, then, do we go about cre
ating this "atmosphere of expect
ing" or improving the little of it
we have now?
There is no established for
mula-about all the writer can
do is make a lew specific sugges
tions. To keep the problem in its
proper perspective, it might be
desirable to point out the factors
that oppose such an "atmos
phere." The most significant ones
revolve about the makeup of the
student body, itself.
Stanford is the school for the
bright, intelligent children of the
"nouveaux riches" of Western
America. Many of the new rich
are Stanford graduates—gradu
ates of a University that w;is
marked in their generation as the
country-club school.
Parents Maintain
This is the image of Stanford
that they maintain, though we
have long since lost the "country
club" character. The point here
is that this is how the parents of
potential Stanford students still
remember the school—and they
pass this expectancy on to their
children.
My Managing Editor describes
the incoming students as the
"golden children" of the West,
the point being that such a make
up leaves the student body defi
cient of people who have expe
rienced the harder realities of life
—want, disappointment, disgust,
personal pagedy, etc. •
The geographic makeup also
limits us to an overwhelming
representation of the Western
American culture. The writer is
told, and suspects, that there is a
marked difference in the East
and South.
Obvious Place
The most obvious place to start
creating this "atmosphere of ex
pectancy" is in the contact be
tween the University and these
students through the literature a
student receives both before and
alter- his acceptance.
After digging up as much of
the information as possible that
has gone to or will go to next

year's students, and looking
through the information that has
been sent in the past, I'm con
vinced that a good starting point
would be to revamp much of it.
This period when a student is
first entering the University is
the most fruitful lime to build
his expectancies. A letter- from
the ASSU with a salutation of
"Hello Indian," a booklet on
freshman women's housing with
a title like "The Branner Man
ner," and a booklet that goes into
meticulous detail about campus
activities and contains quaint pic
tures of Indians here and there
doesn't contribute much to an
"atmosphere of expectancy."
Pre-Reg Week
Likewise during Pre-Reg Week
further lasting first impressions
are made. Speakers during this
week from President Sterling on
down have their first opportunity
to contribute to an "atmosphere
of expectancy." This opportunity
is passed up far too often iir fa
vor- of jokes about the girls being
here for husbands and how stu
dents are always to feel free to
come into their respective offices.
One sponsor described the Pre-
Reg program as an insult to the
freshmen's intelligence - and
part of it is.
The program might be expand
ed to include attending such
things as the first Tuesday Se
ries. Another writer has suggest
ed introductory discussion ses
sions with the faculty on impor
tant academic topics: "interna
tional relations," "what is art?"
etc.
Sterling Speak
President Sterling might speak
to the students once a year in
assembly—as a thinker and an
educator, instead of as an admin
istrator. Likewise, it would be
good to hear Dean .Rhinelander—
and others—speaking on matters
of academic importance to Stan
ford.
This might be organized into a
regular occurrence once a quar
ter. The changes constantly tak
ing place irr Stanford's academic
outlook generate an excitement,
and an expectancy, irr them
selves. These things are very sel
dom communicated to students
until the change is an accom
plished fact.
Current Problems
More editorial comment by
teachers in classes on current
academic problems might also
help. This isn't to suggest that
professors should sacrifice a lot
of class time for this sort of
thing, but an off-hand comment

or two in passing is certainly wel
come.
Students might pre - register
just once a year after a good con
ference with their 1 adviser instead
of three times and only make
such changes in their year's pro
gram as seem necessary as they
go along.
A good way is also needed for
students to communicate to pro
fessors whether or not the pro
fessor's* c o u r s e is "coming
across." A good questionnaire at
a course's completion might be
of some help, it satisfactory ques
tions can be devised.
Professors with small seminar
courses might consider the possi
bility of a weekend at the Napa
cabin. Such ;i weekend might be
particularly useful in laying the
groundwork for a course.
A suggestion that has appeared
before in The Daily might be
mentioned again a guide to San
Francisco. This certainly would
improve the "atmosphere of ex
pectancy," of this excellent cul

tural and social center.
Libraries in each house might
also be mentioned again.
Writing is an excellent way for
a student to organize his think
ing. The Bridge is an example
of what can be done in the way
of publishing such writing it
should come out more often.

These are a few suggestions
the writer is sure there are many
more. There is no solution to the
problem of changing Stanford
students into students who will
be "learning for lear ning's sake."
perhaps by placing them in
an "atmosphere of expectancy,"
they'll make that change them
selves.
It's always interesting, when
someone has studied a group of
which you are a part, to see how
the findings stack up with what
you would expect.
Such is the case with a recent
study of "the silent generation"
of college students which is sum
marized in an article in "The Na
tion" (May 16, 1959) by Edward
D. Eddy, provost of the Univer
sity of New Hampshire. The ar
ticle is one of six in Nation's
'Campus Report Number 3 - Ten
sion Beneath Apathy."
Eddy sums up the findings
with the comment that "the stu
dent is a 'p al ' ac to x in parenthe
sis.' "
Set Apart
The parenthesis part of his
comment simply suggests that
college years are years set apart
and unconnected with the totality
of a person's life the paradoxes
he has found in students and the
recommendation he makes to re
solve them are far more interest
ing.
He suggests these live para
doxes:
1. "Beneath the student's stud
ied pretense of indifference and
apathy lies an unfashionable but
searching desire for meaning.
2. "It's fashionable to be busy
—but busyness is often more im
portant than the achievement.
3. "While wanting to know
what he should know, the stu
dent protests that he should have
increasing opportunity to think
and act for himself.
4. "Keenly interested in expe
riencing the totality of life and
knowledge, the student often re
acts by preferring to compart
mentalize his own life and knowl
edge.
5. "While respecting and hon
oring the adult who has explicit
convictions, the student prefers
to hide his own in the shelter of
the group."
Concludes
Eddy summarizes and con
cludes—with regard to the last
paradox at least—that "The stu
dent is ready for a more search
ing and strenuous education ex
perience, but the colleges have
not fully recognized, nor are
they fully prepared to meet, this
potential challenge . . . The fail
ure of the student to respond is
basically the failure of the col
lege to challenge."
Does this describe the Stan
ford student and Stanford as a
university? Not quite, 1 think,
because in reality there are two
Stanford students. The first is
probably accurately defined by
these five conclusions—allowing
for a variation of intensity—and
far outnumbers the second kind
of student. This second student
is the one who has resolved these
paradoxes.
This is the student- and he ex

ists on every other campus—who
has dropped the pretense of indif
ference and conducts his search
for meaning in the open, who has
replaced busyness with achieve

tion" (May 16, 1959) by Edward
D. Eddy, provost of the Univer
sity of New Hampshire. The ar
ticle is one of six in Nation's
'Campus Report Number 3 - Ten
sion Beneath Apathy."
Eddy sums up the findings
with the comment that "the stu
dent is a 'p al ' ac to x in parenthe
sis.' "
Set Apart
The parenthesis part of his
comment simply suggests that
college years are years set apart
and unconnected with the totality
of a person's life the paradoxes
he has found in students and the
recommendation he makes to re
solve them are far more interest
ing.
He suggests these live para
doxes:
1. "Beneath the student's stud
ied pretense of indifference and
apathy lies an unfashionable but
searching desire for meaning.
2. "It's fashionable to be busy
—but busyness is often more im
portant than the achievement.
3. "While wanting to know
what he should know, the stu
dent protests that he should have
increasing opportunity to think
and act for himself.
4. "Keenly interested in expe
riencing the totality of life and
knowledge, the student often re
acts by preferring to compart
mentalize his own life and knowl
edge.
5. "While respecting and hon
oring the adult who has explicit
convictions, the student prefers
to hide his own in the shelter of
the group."
Concludes
Eddy summarizes and con
cludes—with regard to the last
paradox at least—that "The stu
dent is ready for a more search
ing and strenuous education ex
perience, but the colleges have
not fully recognized, nor are
they fully prepared to meet, this
potential challenge . . . The fail
ure of the student to respond is
basically the failure of the col
lege to challenge."
Does this describe the Stan
ford student and Stanford as a
university? Not quite, 1 think,
because in reality there are two
Stanford students. The first is
probably accurately defined by
these five conclusions—allowing
for a variation of intensity—and
far outnumbers the second kind
of student. This second student
is the one who has resolved these
paradoxes.
This is the student- and he ex

ists on every other campus—who
has dropped the pretense of indif
ference and conducts his search
for meaning in the open, who has
replaced busyness with achieve
ment by carefully selecting the
activities in which he partici
pates, and by taking advantage,
at Stanford at least, of the di
rected reading courses, the semi
nars or a complete honors pro
gram.
This is the student who can't
be tuld what to "know," who does
think in terms of the tutality of
life and knowledge, and the stu
dent who doesn't hesitate to
openly voice a conviction.
While Eddy technically allows
for this second kind of student
by carefully qualifying his terms,
the writer suggests it is impor
tant to make this distinction ex
plicit for several reasons:
Honors Programs
First, here at least, the special
honors programs and courses
that have been established to ac
commodate the second student
seem to indicate that the univer
sity has recognized that some
students are ready for "a more
searching and strenuous educa
tional experience."
Second, the question then aris
es, it this readiness is recognized,
why hasn't the university "chal
lenged" all its students and
brought them into such programs
as these, emphasizing individual
work ?
While some might maintain
that this hasn't been done be
cause of the cost involved in
honors programs, the writer feels
that the crux of the problem is
that no one really knows how to
"challenge" the student.
Not Enough
It isn't enough for Eddy to
charge universities with a "fail
ure to challenge." The writer
feels it would be more to the
point to suggest how this can be
done.
flow can this be done? llow
can we do it at Stanford; how can
we turn the first kind of student
into the second? How can we
communicate to Eddy's "unchal
lenged" students "the sense that
learning is important for learn
ing's sake," as President Sterling
has put it?
The only way to awaken aca
demically a student who is ca
pable of being awakened is by a
contact of an undefinable nature
between faculty member and stu
dent, student and student, or
even book and student. No one
can specify what must be said—
if we could the problem would be
completely solved.
"Expectancy"
But we can place the student in
an "atmosphere of expectancy,"
so to speak. If we can't say how
this challenge, this awakening,
will happen, at least we can say
that the student can uxpect some
thing to happen. If this expec

tancy can be developed in stu
dents, they will then be seeking
out that challenge and it will be
much less likely to slip by them.
The battle will be mostly won.
In many cases no challenge
will be sufficient to awaken the
student- the paradoxes will go
unresolved.
Our academic program is rap
idly approaching a point of ex
cellence—if our students aren't
capable of taking advantage of it,
then the value of it is lost.
How, then, do we go about cre
ating this "atmosphere of expect
ing" or improving the little of it
we have now?
There is no established for
mula-about all the writer can
do is make a lew specific sugges
tions. To keep the problem in its
proper perspective, it might be
desirable to point out the factors
that oppose such an "atmos
phere." The most significant ones
revolve about the makeup of the
student body, itself.
Stanford is the school for the
bright, intelligent children of the
"nouveaux riches" of Western
America. Many of the new rich
are Stanford graduates—gradu
ates of a University that w;is
marked in their generation as the
country-club school.
Parents Maintain
This is the image of Stanford
that they maintain, though we
have long since lost the "country
club" character. The point here
is that this is how the parents of
potential Stanford students still
remember the school—and they
pass this expectancy on to their
children.
My Managing Editor describes
the incoming students as the
"golden children" of the West,
the point being that such a make
up leaves the student body defi
cient of people who have expe
rienced the harder realities of life
—want, disappointment, disgust,
personal pagedy, etc. •
The geographic makeup also
limits us to an overwhelming
representation of the Western
American culture. The writer is
told, and suspects, that there is a
marked difference in the East
and South.
Obvious Place
The most obvious place to start
creating this "atmosphere of ex
pectancy" is in the contact be
tween the University and these
students through the literature a
student receives both before and
alter- his acceptance.
After digging up as much of
the information as possible that
has gone to or will go to next

year's students, and looking
through the information that has
been sent in the past, I'm con
vinced that a good starting point
would be to revamp much of it.
This period when a student is
first entering the University is
the most fruitful lime to build
his expectancies. A letter- from
the ASSU with a salutation of
"Hello Indian," a booklet on
freshman women's housing with
a title like "The Branner Man
ner," and a booklet that goes into
meticulous detail about campus
activities and contains quaint pic
tures of Indians here and there
doesn't contribute much to an
"atmosphere of expectancy."
Pre-Reg Week
Likewise during Pre-Reg Week
further lasting first impressions
are made. Speakers during this
week from President Sterling on
down have their first opportunity
to contribute to an "atmosphere
of expectancy." This opportunity
is passed up far too often iir fa
vor- of jokes about the girls being
here for husbands and how stu
dents are always to feel free to
come into their respective offices.
One sponsor described the Pre-
Reg program as an insult to the
freshmen's intelligence - and
part of it is.
The program might be expand
ed to include attending such
things as the first Tuesday Se
ries. Another writer has suggest
ed introductory discussion ses
sions with the faculty on impor
tant academic topics: "interna
tional relations," "what is art?"
etc.
Sterling Speak
President Sterling might speak
to the students once a year in
assembly—as a thinker and an
educator, instead of as an admin
istrator. Likewise, it would be
good to hear Dean .Rhinelander—
and others—speaking on matters
of academic importance to Stan
ford.
This might be organized into a
regular occurrence once a quar
ter. The changes constantly tak
ing place irr Stanford's academic
outlook generate an excitement,
and an expectancy, irr them
selves. These things are very sel
dom communicated to students
until the change is an accom
plished fact.
Current Problems
More editorial comment by
teachers in classes on current
academic problems might also
help. This isn't to suggest that
professors should sacrifice a lot
of class time for this sort of
thing, but an off-hand comment

or two in passing is certainly wel
come.
Students might pre - register
just once a year after a good con
ference with their 1 adviser instead
of three times and only make
such changes in their year's pro
gram as seem necessary as they
go along.
A good way is also needed for
students to communicate to pro
fessors whether or not the pro
fessor's* c o u r s e is "coming
across." A good questionnaire at
a course's completion might be
of some help, it satisfactory ques
tions can be devised.
Professors with small seminar
courses might consider the possi
bility of a weekend at the Napa
cabin. Such ;i weekend might be
particularly useful in laying the
groundwork for a course.
A suggestion that has appeared
before in The Daily might be
mentioned again a guide to San
Francisco. This certainly would
improve the "atmosphere of ex
pectancy," of this excellent cul

tural and social center.
Libraries in each house might
also be mentioned again.
Writing is an excellent way for
a student to organize his think
ing. The Bridge is an example
of what can be done in the way
of publishing such writing it
should come out more often.

These are a few suggestions
the writer is sure there are many
more. There is no solution to the
problem of changing Stanford
students into students who will
be "learning for lear ning's sake."
perhaps by placing them in
an "atmosphere of expectancy,"
they'll make that change them
selves.
It's always interesting, when
someone has studied a group of
which you are a part, to see how
the findings stack up with what
you would expect.
Such is the case with a recent
study of "the silent generation"
of college students which is sum
marized in an article in "The Na
tion" (May 16, 1959) by Edward
D. Eddy, provost of the Univer
sity of New Hampshire. The ar

and an expectancy, irr them
selves. These things are very sel
dom communicated to students
until the change is an accom
plished fact.
Current Problems
More editorial comment by
teachers in classes on current
academic problems might also
help. This isn't to suggest that
professors should sacrifice a lot
of class time for this sort of
thing, but an off-hand comment

or two in passing is certainly wel
come.
Students might pre - register
just once a year after a good con
ference with their 1 adviser instead
of three times and only make
such changes in their year's pro
gram as seem necessary as they
go along.
A good way is also needed for
students to communicate to pro
fessors whether or not the pro
fessor's* c o u r s e is "coming
across." A good questionnaire at
a course's completion might be
of some help, it satisfactory ques
tions can be devised.
Professors with small seminar
courses might consider the possi
bility of a weekend at the Napa
cabin. Such ;i weekend might be
particularly useful in laying the
groundwork for a course.
A suggestion that has appeared
before in The Daily might be
mentioned again a guide to San
Francisco. This certainly would
improve the "atmosphere of ex
pectancy," of this excellent cul

tural and social center.
Libraries in each house might
also be mentioned again.
Writing is an excellent way for
a student to organize his think
ing. The Bridge is an example
of what can be done in the way
of publishing such writing it
should come out more often.

These are a few suggestions
the writer is sure there are many
more. There is no solution to the
problem of changing Stanford
students into students who will
be "learning for lear ning's sake."
perhaps by placing them in
an "atmosphere of expectancy,"
they'll make that change them
selves.
