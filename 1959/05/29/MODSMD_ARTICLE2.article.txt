# President's Com Will Continue
## 
### 
President Sterling's Student-Faculty Advisory Committee on Aca
demic Affairs will continue next year in substantially the same foym
members recommended at the final meeting of the quarter yester
day.
To increase the effectiveness of the committee, members urgec

that the president appoint at
least one member of the Legisla
ture to the committee. This ap
pointee would co-ordinate the ac
tivities of the committee with the
interests of the students as
voiced through the Legislature.
In their recommendation the
members added that the agenda
should be more carcfully pre
pared and that the students be
k r iven more background on cur
rent plans of the University, so
that they arc not groping wildly
for thoughts which have actually
already been incorporated into
programs.
Selection of next year's com
mittee will be by invitation from
President Sterling, but this year's
members were asked to submit
nominees, and any student who
is interested may petition the
President's Office.
Members noted that recommen
dations made earlier this year on
the honors programs arc being
considered by facutly commit
tee's, and their recommendation
to have the library open until 11
p.m. is expected to be in effect
next year.
After settling the question of
Ihe continuation of the commit
tee, discussion moved to the char
acter of the student body. Causes
for a "rat race" atmosphere were
probed.
Deploring the overloading of
| units by an increasing number of
| the students and an unhealthy
drive for grades, committeemen
| observed that a revision of atti
tude toward studies is called for.
j They noted many students are
missing a great deal of the op
portunity for education when
i they tie themselves to many
I units and hence to their books.
