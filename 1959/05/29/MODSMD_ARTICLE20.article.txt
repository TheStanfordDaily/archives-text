# A 						Final Word
## 
### 
MOST PAST Daily Editors haven't been able to resist the tempta
tion to make a few personal comments in their final editorial—
1 now know why.
1 would like to address these few remarks to the entire stall
of the next volume.
The Daily in years past has been proud of its independence,
proud because this independence has permitted its Editors lo speak
openly as individuals, and I believe the finest result has been the
strong, principled stands that have always been forthcoming.
This integrity has never been questioned it has been the strength
of the paper, because no matter what the instance, one thing was
sure —the editor was speaking honestly and sincerely.
A past editor has remarked that the commitments, the philos
ophy so to speak, of the editor becomes apparent through his
writing. 1 can tell you that this is the case, and I would add thai
this is as it should be. This is a good part of the reason why a
person spends the many hours working to become an editor t«»
be able to speak out his concern, and his praise, in his own terms.
I would give you two thoughts lo consider. First, the Dailj
should not be looked upon as a political organ, as you would con
sider Legislature a political organization. The Daily's purpose is
to speak, and not necessarily to achieve or accomplish. II you
consider the Daily as political, you automatically are dealing in
terms of compromise, of {live and lake and il you re not ever so
careful, before you know il \ou\e sacrificed thai one most precious
thing—your principle.
A final comment. The Daily is more than a newspaper and
more than a strong voice, it is a media that should accommodate
the finest thinking, and writing, thai this campus can produce.
If it fails in this respect — if this function of the paper is sacri
ficed for technical excellence, then il has failed an important part
of its responsibility to the student body.
Dick, the job you're undertaking is an education iu itself I
wish you the best of luck.
