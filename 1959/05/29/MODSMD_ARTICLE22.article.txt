# Neumann is Athlete of the Year
## DAILY Sports SCENE 
### John Schwarz 
With the facts, figures, excite
ment and thrills of the 1958-59
Stanford athletic year now his
tory, the time is here for the
l)aily sports staff to relive a few
of the high points and come up
with its choice for the top indi
vidual performer of the year and
the most valuable players in each
sport.
This year's selection for top
athlete of the year shouldn't
come as too big a surprise to
most Indian sports fans. Paul
Neumann's outstanding perform
ances as captain, court general
and all-around top basketball
player have placed him in the
Stanford sports annals as one of
the greatest athletes to ever play
for the Indians.
Great Team Man
Neumann was not only one of
the best individual performers in
Stanford athletics but the icy-

veined hoopster provided Coach
Howie Dallmar with one of the
host team players that he has
been blessed with in his six years
at Stanford.
Certainly Neumann, with one
of I he most devastating .jump
shots in the country and an ex
ceptional ability for quick change
of pace dribble, could have been
one of the top scorers in the na
tion a la Oscar Robertson and
Jerry West had he been play
ing with a last-breaking, high
scoring team like Cincinnati or
West Virginia. However, Neu
mann accepted the slower, more
defensive brand of play that
.seemed essential to making the
dwarfed Indian squad win and
still managed to finish third in
conference scoring with a 37.1
points per game average.
Thwarts Bears
Neumann developed offensive
skills besides scoring and it was
mainly his ball - handling that
broke up NCAA champion Cali
fornia's all-court press and al
lowed the Indians to be the last
team to beat the Bears this year.
A sign of the popularity that
this great athlete held among his
teammates and fellow students
was certainly evident when the

Stanford Pavilion was packed on
j the final game of the season to
see Neumann's last efforts at
reaching the honored 1000-point
circle. Although he fell three
points short, the tremendous
standing ovation that Neumann
received as he left the floor was
one of the greatest the Pavilion
has seen—indicative of how much
Stanford fans appreciated the 6-1
guard's sterling play over his
three years' varsity career.
At the end of the season Bay
Area scribes named Neumann
Northern California's Player of
the Year — outdistancing all of
the members of Cal's champs and
also the high-ranked St. Mary's
quintet.
Bur Cord Top Gridder
Chris Burford, one of the most
versatile athletes that have come
to Stanford in many years, is The
Daily's pick for the Most Valu
able Player on the 1958 football
squad. Burford, who was voted
this same award by his team
mates also, held the often out
manned Stanford gridders to
gether in numerous situations.
His sensational pass-catching ef
forts, his top ■ notch defensive
work and tireless 60-minute per
formances impressed many and
led to Burford's selection on ev
ery All-Coast squad and some All
American teams.*
Mike Magee has garnered the
1958 59 baseball award. Magee,
like Burford, was given the same
distinction by his teammates.
The fireplug second - baseman
made a remarkable shift when he
took over the void in Stanford's

infield at second base after play
ing most of his life as a catcher.
In addition to his anchoring
down of the infield defenses. Ma
gee's clutch hitting was one of
the big factors in many of the j
Cards' one-run triumphs.
Track fans will well be able to
understand why Ernie Cunliffe
was voted this year's MVP of the
spike team. Cunliffe, Stanford's
greatest half-miler of all time,
several times had to run the dif
ficult mile and 880 double to
help insure his team of needed
points.
Cunliffe was brilliant in win
ning the PCC half-mile title in
Seattle as he set a blistering pace
and then held off a determined
challenge by Cal's Jerry Siebert
to win in 1:49.2.
This year's tennis team had
one of the most evenly balanced

squads in some time without any
real individual standout. For
this sport dual recognition was
decided on with Dave Nelson and
i Dick Ogden being the winners.
Nelson and Ogden combined to
| give Stanford one of the best
| doubles teams the school has
had. Their win over UCLA's
powerful duo of Allan Fox and
Norm Perry at the O.jai tourney
was one of the few moments this
year that Stanford could boast of
being on top of the nation's num
| ber one tennis school.
Harrison Smashes Marks
The Stanford PCC champion
swimming team's George Harri
son won national recognition for
both himself and Stanford as he
swam his way to the NCAA and
American records in the 220-yard
individual medley with his 2:06.7
at Ithaca in this year's NCAA
Championships.
Woodgie Reich has been select
ed as the MVP of the highly suc
cessful Stanford golf team.
Reich, a senior, paced the Cards
to an undefeated match-plav sea
son and starred as the Tribe
snapped USC's 51 - match win
streak.

1958 59 baseball award. Magee,
like Burford, was given the same
distinction by his teammates.
The fireplug second - baseman
made a remarkable shift when he
took over the void in Stanford's

infield at second base after play
ing most of his life as a catcher.
In addition to his anchoring
down of the infield defenses. Ma
gee's clutch hitting was one of
the big factors in many of the j
Cards' one-run triumphs.
Track fans will well be able to
understand why Ernie Cunliffe
was voted this year's MVP of the
spike team. Cunliffe, Stanford's
greatest half-miler of all time,
several times had to run the dif
ficult mile and 880 double to
help insure his team of needed
points.
Cunliffe was brilliant in win
ning the PCC half-mile title in
Seattle as he set a blistering pace
and then held off a determined
challenge by Cal's Jerry Siebert
to win in 1:49.2.
This year's tennis team had
one of the most evenly balanced

squads in some time without any
real individual standout. For
this sport dual recognition was
decided on with Dave Nelson and
i Dick Ogden being the winners.
Nelson and Ogden combined to
| give Stanford one of the best

had. Their win over UCLA's
powerful duo of Allan Fox and
Norm Perry at the O.jai tourney
was one of the few moments this
year that Stanford could boast of
being on top of the nation's num

Harrison Smashes Marks
The Stanford PCC champion
swimming team's George Harri
son won national recognition for
both himself and Stanford as he
swam his way to the NCAA and

individual medley with his 2:06.7
at Ithaca in this year's NCAA
Championships.
Woodgie Reich has been select

Reich, a senior, paced the Cards

streak.

With the facts, figures, excite
ment and thrills of the 1958-59
Stanford athletic year now his
tory, the time is here for the
l)aily sports staff to relive a few
of the high points and come up
with its choice for the top indi
vidual performer of the year and
the most valuable players in each
sport.
This year's selection for top
athlete of the year shouldn't
come as too big a surprise to
most Indian sports fans. Paul
Neumann's outstanding perform
ances as captain, court general
and all-around top basketball
player have placed him in the
Stanford sports annals as one of
the greatest athletes to ever play
for the Indians.
Great Team Man
Neumann was not only one of
the best individual performers in
Stanford athletics but the icy-

veined hoopster provided Coach
Howie Dallmar with one of the
host team players that he has
been blessed with in his six years
at Stanford.
Certainly Neumann, with one
of I he most devastating .jump
shots in the country and an ex
ceptional ability for quick change
of pace dribble, could have been
one of the top scorers in the na
tion a la Oscar Robertson and
Jerry West had he been play
ing with a last-breaking, high
scoring team like Cincinnati or
West Virginia. However, Neu
mann accepted the slower, more
defensive brand of play that
.seemed essential to making the
dwarfed Indian squad win and
still managed to finish third in
conference scoring with a 37.1
points per game average.
Thwarts Bears
Neumann developed offensive
skills besides scoring and it was
mainly his ball - handling that
broke up NCAA champion Cali
fornia's all-court press and al
lowed the Indians to be the last
team to beat the Bears this year.
A sign of the popularity that
this great athlete held among his
teammates and fellow students
was certainly evident when the

Stanford Pavilion was packed on
j the final game of the season to
see Neumann's last efforts at
reaching the honored 1000-point
circle. Although he fell three
points short, the tremendous
standing ovation that Neumann
received as he left the floor was
one of the greatest the Pavilion
has seen—indicative of how much
Stanford fans appreciated the 6-1
guard's sterling play over his
three years' varsity career.
At the end of the season Bay
Area scribes named Neumann
Northern California's Player of
the Year — outdistancing all of
the members of Cal's champs and
also the high-ranked St. Mary's
quintet.

mates also, held the often out

gether in numerous situations.
His sensational pass-catching ef

Howie Dallmar with one of the
host team players that he has
been blessed with in his six years
at Stanford.
Certainly Neumann, with one
of I he most devastating .jump
shots in the country and an ex
ceptional ability for quick change
of pace dribble, could have been
one of the top scorers in the na
tion a la Oscar Robertson and
Jerry West had he been play
ing with a last-breaking, high
scoring team like Cincinnati or
West Virginia. However, Neu
mann accepted the slower, more
defensive brand of play that
.seemed essential to making the
dwarfed Indian squad win and
still managed to finish third in
conference scoring with a 37.1
points per game average.
Thwarts Bears
Neumann developed offensive
skills besides scoring and it was
mainly his ball - handling that
broke up NCAA champion Cali
fornia's all-court press and al
lowed the Indians to be the last
team to beat the Bears this year.
A sign of the popularity that
this great athlete held among his
teammates and fellow students
was certainly evident when the

Stanford Pavilion was packed on
j the final game of the season to
see Neumann's last efforts at
reaching the honored 1000-point
circle. Although he fell three
points short, the tremendous
standing ovation that Neumann
received as he left the floor was
one of the greatest the Pavilion
has seen—indicative of how much
Stanford fans appreciated the 6-1
guard's sterling play over his
three years' varsity career.
At the end of the season Bay
Area scribes named Neumann
Northern California's Player of
the Year — outdistancing all of
the members of Cal's champs and
also the high-ranked St. Mary's
quintet.
Bur Cord Top Gridder
Chris Burford, one of the most
versatile athletes that have come
to Stanford in many years, is The
Daily's pick for the Most Valu
able Player on the 1958 football
squad. Burford, who was voted
this same award by his team
mates also, held the often out
manned Stanford gridders to
gether in numerous situations.
His sensational pass-catching ef
forts, his top ■ notch defensive
work and tireless 60-minute per
formances impressed many and
led to Burford's selection on ev
ery All-Coast squad and some All
American teams.*
Mike Magee has garnered the
1958 59 baseball award. Magee,
like Burford, was given the same
distinction by his teammates.
The fireplug second - baseman
made a remarkable shift when he
took over the void in Stanford's

infield at second base after play
ing most of his life as a catcher.
In addition to his anchoring
down of the infield defenses. Ma
gee's clutch hitting was one of
the big factors in many of the j
Cards' one-run triumphs.
Track fans will well be able to
understand why Ernie Cunliffe
was voted this year's MVP of the
spike team. Cunliffe, Stanford's
greatest half-miler of all time,
several times had to run the dif
ficult mile and 880 double to
help insure his team of needed
points.
Cunliffe was brilliant in win
ning the PCC half-mile title in
Seattle as he set a blistering pace
and then held off a determined
challenge by Cal's Jerry Siebert
to win in 1:49.2.
This year's tennis team had
one of the most evenly balanced

squads in some time without any
real individual standout. For
this sport dual recognition was
decided on with Dave Nelson and
i Dick Ogden being the winners.
Nelson and Ogden combined to
| give Stanford one of the best
| doubles teams the school has
had. Their win over UCLA's
powerful duo of Allan Fox and
Norm Perry at the O.jai tourney
was one of the few moments this
year that Stanford could boast of
being on top of the nation's num
| ber one tennis school.
Harrison Smashes Marks
The Stanford PCC champion
swimming team's George Harri
son won national recognition for
both himself and Stanford as he
swam his way to the NCAA and
American records in the 220-yard
individual medley with his 2:06.7
at Ithaca in this year's NCAA
Championships.
Woodgie Reich has been select
ed as the MVP of the highly suc

Reich, a senior, paced the Cards
to an undefeated match-plav sea

This year's tennis team had
one of the most evenly balanced

squads in some time without any
real individual standout. For
this sport dual recognition was
decided on with Dave Nelson and
i Dick Ogden being the winners.
Nelson and Ogden combined to
| give Stanford one of the best
| doubles teams the school has
had. Their win over UCLA's
powerful duo of Allan Fox and
Norm Perry at the O.jai tourney
was one of the few moments this
year that Stanford could boast of
being on top of the nation's num
| ber one tennis school.
