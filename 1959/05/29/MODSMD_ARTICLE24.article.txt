And so another year ends.
1959, tho year ilio PCC died. But also a sports year of quite a few
memories—things that we'll never forget. For instance, how can you
forget Big Came and the inspired show of an Indian team that
came so, so close?
Or how can you forget tho lump in your throat that came when

Pant Neumann was given that
minutes-long standing ovation as
he ended his 'college hoop career
and the electric excitement
that gripped tho Pavilion as he
tried for his 1000 th point?
Paul would have got that 1000
if he'd resorted to gunning, but
he remained a team man.
How can you forget the run
ning of Kick McMillen in that
first football victory; or the
amazing performance of Sid Car
ber in engineering the delightful
win over UCLA; or Dick Nor
man's passing against OSC, or
the game-after-game GO-minute
play of a great Chris Kurl'nrd?
Mow can you forget Krnie (Hn
litre's guts-ball wire-to-wire vic
tory in the PCC 880? Or Mike
Ma gee's bases - loaded triple
against Santa Clara that started
the Tribe off to its surprising
baseball season? Or Trev Grimm
chasing a hallyhooed Max liner
Jr. all around the ring for one
round before driving the big
Santa Claran into bloody obli
vion ?
ITow can you forget I'anl Neu
mann winding his way through
Cal's great all-court press to en
gineer the last defeat the nation
al champion suffered last year?
Mow can you forget sophomore
George Harrison's record-smash
| ing swimming feats? Or the golf
win over use?
The Wonderful World of Spoi l
! has its not-to-be-forgotten ,mo-
I ments.
Recording them next fall will
be now sports edit or John

New Jersey who likes high-scor

And so another year ends.
1959, tho year ilio PCC died. But also a sports year of quite a few
memories—things that we'll never forget. For instance, how can you
forget Big Came and the inspired show of an Indian team that
came so, so close?
Or how can you forget tho lump in your throat that came when

Pant Neumann was given that
minutes-long standing ovation as
he ended his 'college hoop career
and the electric excitement
that gripped tho Pavilion as he
tried for his 1000 th point?
Paul would have got that 1000
if he'd resorted to gunning, but
he remained a team man.
How can you forget the run
ning of Kick McMillen in that
first football victory; or the
amazing performance of Sid Car
ber in engineering the delightful
win over UCLA; or Dick Nor
man's passing against OSC, or
the game-after-game GO-minute
play of a great Chris Kurl'nrd?
Mow can you forget Krnie (Hn
litre's guts-ball wire-to-wire vic
tory in the PCC 880? Or Mike
Ma gee's bases - loaded triple
against Santa Clara that started
the Tribe off to its surprising
baseball season? Or Trev Grimm
chasing a hallyhooed Max liner
Jr. all around the ring for one
round before driving the big
Santa Claran into bloody obli
vion ?
ITow can you forget I'anl Neu
mann winding his way through
Cal's great all-court press to en
gineer the last defeat the nation
al champion suffered last year?
Mow can you forget sophomore
George Harrison's record-smash

win over use?
The Wonderful World of Spoi l
