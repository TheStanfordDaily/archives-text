## Scholars Need Rides To Stanford 
### 
Sign-up sheets for students in
terested in helping some of the
ASSU foreign scholars get from
New York to Stanford next fall
will be posted in all the living
groups Wednesday through Mon
day. according to Dan Young,
Foreign Scholar Commission co
chairman.
Ten of the foreign students will
arrive in New York sometime in
September, and as scholarship
funds barely cover their traveling
expenses, any students driving to
points west, at this time could be
of great assistance. The foreign
students will be able to share
costs if rides are provided.
Families who could extend over
night hospitality for those who
will be hitch-hiking would also be
appreciated, Young said.
The names and addresses of
those who sign up will be sent t rÂ»
the foreign students, and specific
arrangements will be ma d e
through direct correspondence.
