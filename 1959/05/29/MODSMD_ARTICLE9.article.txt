# Monkeys Return Safely From Flight into Space
## Navy Frogmen Hoisted Nose Cone From Sea 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (/h The United Stales fired two mon-
I keys 300 miles into space Thursday and brought them hack alive and
well. The spectacular recovery was an important step toward put
| ting a man in spaec.
The two female monkeys named Able and Baker arc the first

| animals this country has re
prieved alive from a space flight.
Navy frogmen helped hoist the
| nose cone and the nation's new
space heroines from the Atlantic
| Ocean at 1:08 a.m.
Only one hour and 33 minutes
i earlier the monkeys streaked
from Cape Canaveral perched in 1
a powerful Jupiter missile.
1500 MilÂ«'s Away
The intermediate range rocket
! hurled the payload into space at
' blinding 10,000-mile-an-hour speed
| and dumped it in the ocean some
j 1500 miles away in just 15 min
; utes.
The fleet tug U.S.S. Kiowa, a
Navy recovery ship, plucked the i
nose cone from the sea. Some,
- four hours later a medical offi
cer aboard Ihe ship messaged:
"Able, Baker perfect. No inju
ries or other difficulties."
Housing Welcome
Able and Baker will be flown
to Washington, probably Satur
day. There they are expected to
receive a rousing welcome at a ;
news conference of the National ;
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration.
NASA co-operated with the
Army and Navy in sponsoring
this space shoot designed to gath
er data for its man-in-space pro
gram.
Electronic instruments radioed
back information on how the
monkeys reacted during the 15-
minute flight. NASA primarily is
interested in how Able and Baker
reacted to radiation and the nine
minute weightless period to J
which they were subjected.
Weightlessness
Several tiny samples of animal
and vegetable matter also were
stocked in the nose cone for a
further study of cosmic rays and
weightlessness. Included were
specimens of corn, yeast, mus
tard seed, fruit fly larvae, human
blood, bread mold spore and the
eggs and sperms of sea urchins.
Officials said it probably would
be several weeks before the ef
fects on the matter could be eval
uated.
Both Able and Baker wore spe
cial space suits to protect them
from radiation and temperature
changes at high altitudes and
during launching and re-entry.
