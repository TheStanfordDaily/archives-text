# Seeger Heads Folk Song Concerts Here Monday
## 
### 
Three premier American folk singers will perform Monday at
8 p.m in Memorial Auditorium. Pete Seeger, Sam Hinton and Alan
Lomax will present the two-hour concert.
The folk concert will be the first in a series of summer events pre
sented by the Stanford Committee on Public Exercises.

The program is expected to be
one of contrasts, since each of
the three is known for a different
and unique style of folk singing.
Seeger is perhaps the best
known of the three. He lias per
formed throughout the country,
including a sellout show at New
York's Carnegie Hall.
During the coming year, Seeger
is scheduled to appear at the New
por., Rhode Island, Jazz festival,
the S rat ford, Canada, festival,
and other such programs.
Ilinton will be making his sec
ond appearance here, following
another program early this year.
Tickets, at $1.50, are on sale at
Memorial Auditorium box office.
