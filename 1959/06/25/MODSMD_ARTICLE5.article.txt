# Summer Registration Moves Toward 2200
## Final Attendance Expected to Near Last Summer's 
### 
A summer quarter attendance
that looks to be about as large as
] ast year moved through an ac
uity-filled first week of summer
•■ossion. With late registrations
still leaving final totals in doubt,
2172 persons had signed in for
the quarter.
Of the registrants, 1524 were
men, 684 women, a ratio slightly
more favorable than during the
normal school year.
1600 "Natives"
Slightly over 1600 of the group
are "native" Stanford students.
Four hundred nineteen others are
non - mat riculated grad students
and 111 are summer-only under
graduates.
Though 2710 students attended
last year, the current total is ex
pected to grow near that with
registration of participants at
the 13 workshops yet to be held
this quarter. These range any
where from a weekend to a
month in length.
Get-togethers
Students had their first get-to
gether Monday evening following
registration at a Reg Day all
campus dance at Bowman Alum
ni House. They had further op
portunity to get acquainted with
each other and with faculty yes
terday afternoon at an all-Univer
sity reception, also held at Bow
man.
Saturday, an all-campus open
house will be held at 8:30 p.m. in
Lagunita. Sunday, the first flick
of the quarter, "Twelve Angry
Men," will be screened in Memo
rial Auditorium at 7:30 p.m.
