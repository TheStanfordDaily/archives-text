# Top Administration Reshuffled
## Legislature Finalizes Summer Social Plans 
### 
The accent was on the social Monday as summer quarter legisla
ture met for the first time under the gavel of President Jim Robert
son.
Vice-President Steve Farrand, the quarter's social coordinator,
announced plans for a variety of events to be climaxed by the semi-

formal Lagunita Dance on August
8.
Wednesday, the ASSU will
sponsor a bridge tournament to
be held at 7:15 in Lagunita Court.
Farrand said the emphasis would
be on the social rather than the
cut-throat. Prizes will be awarded
to the winners in the party bridge
rotation. A sign-up sheet will be
posted at the ASSU office today.
Co-Rec Swim
Also on the calendar for
Wednesday is the first in a series
of weekly ASSU co-recreational
swimming sessions. It will begin
at 7:30 p.m. in the men's pools.
Coif tournament chairman
Lawson Lowe confirmed the July
27 date for the event, and said it
would be over a nine-hole route.
Here, too, the emphasis will be on
fun, not skill.
Lowe said Hofman Jewelers in
Palo Alto have donated two silver
plates. These will go to the low
gross and low net winners. Under
the Calloway handicap system,
the 120 shooter will have as good
a chance as the par golfer of
winning the net trophy. Lowe
emphasized that the tourney is
for women as well as men.
A quarter-long activity to begin
a week from today are volleyball
tournaments. Two-man competi
tion will be held Tuesday at 4:30,
and mixed doubles Thursdays at
1:30. Signups began Tuesday at
the ASSU office and men's gym.
During the final week, playoffs
will be held among the weekly
winners to determine an all-Uni
versity champion.
Lots of Melon
The first of two watermelon
feeds is scheduled for July 11.
The Saturday afternoon affair
will feature plenty of watermelon
and recreational activities.
Farrand concluded his report
with merit ion of the Lagunita
Dance and another dance July
25, to be presented by the men
students.
Farrand's earlier report on al
ready-staged activities stressed
the success of all three — reg
dance, all - University reception
and Lagunita open house.
The only complaint about the
open house, Farrand commented,
was a lack of girls, many of
whom, he theorized, were appre
hensive about coming stag.
Damman reported that the ini
tial Sunday flick of the quarter
had drawn well. He noted the
excellent films on tap for the
series, and predicted more good
attendances.
Legislature, dissatisfied with
this year's procedure in social cal
endar distribution, resolved to ask
the administration to in the fu
ture hand it out as registrants
file into Memorial Auditorium.
This year, the calendar was dis
tributed from a table in the pa
vilion. Many students contended
they did not know a calendar
was available, and hence received
none. This summer's social calen
dar was compiled and distributed
by administrative officials.
Happy Hours?
Also considered at the meeting,
and given to committees for fur
ther study, were possibilities of
weekly "Happy Hours" and some
sort of summer quarter roster of
students, perhaps complete with
photographs.
With confirmation of some
members, summer legislature will
be composed of Robertson, Far
rand, undergrad men's represent
atives Austen Lauw-Zecha and
Thomas Harding, undergrad
women's representatives Marilyn
Funk and Camille Petersen, Edu
cation Council representative Mir
iam Wagenscneim, and graduate
representative Jim Rasmussen.
Ex-officio members are Dam
man, administrative assistant Ru
by Yaryan, AWS representative
Dolores Smith, parliamentarian
Ellie Whitsett, 1958-59 legislature
representative Pete Erlin and
Summer Weekly editor Dick
Barnes.
Legislature will meet again
Monday at 7:30 p.m. in the ASSU
conference room.

be composed of Robertson, Far
rand, undergrad men's represent
atives Austen Lauw-Zecha and
Thomas Harding, undergrad
women's representatives Marilyn
Funk and Camille Petersen, Edu
cation Council representative Mir
iam Wagenscneim, and graduate
representative Jim Rasmussen.
Ex-officio members are Dam
man, administrative assistant Ru
by Yaryan, AWS representative
Dolores Smith, parliamentarian
Ellie Whitsett, 1958-59 legislature
representative Pete Erlin and
Summer Weekly editor Dick
Barnes.
Legislature will meet again
Monday at 7:30 p.m. in the ASSU
conference room.
The accent was on the social Monday as summer quarter legisla
ture met for the first time under the gavel of President Jim Robert
son.
Vice-President Steve Farrand, the quarter's social coordinator,
announced plans for a variety of events to be climaxed by the semi-

formal Lagunita Dance on August
8.
Wednesday, the ASSU will
sponsor a bridge tournament to
be held at 7:15 in Lagunita Court.
Farrand said the emphasis would
be on the social rather than the
cut-throat. Prizes will be awarded
to the winners in the party bridge
rotation. A sign-up sheet will be
posted at the ASSU office today.
Co-Rec Swim
Also on the calendar for
Wednesday is the first in a series
of weekly ASSU co-recreational
swimming sessions. It will begin
at 7:30 p.m. in the men's pools.
Coif tournament chairman
Lawson Lowe confirmed the July
27 date for the event, and said it
would be over a nine-hole route.
Here, too, the emphasis will be on
fun, not skill.
Lowe said Hofman Jewelers in
Palo Alto have donated two silver
plates. These will go to the low
gross and low net winners. Under
the Calloway handicap system,
the 120 shooter will have as good
a chance as the par golfer of
winning the net trophy. Lowe
emphasized that the tourney is
for women as well as men.
A quarter-long activity to begin
a week from today are volleyball
tournaments. Two-man competi
tion will be held Tuesday at 4:30,
and mixed doubles Thursdays at
1:30. Signups began Tuesday at
the ASSU office and men's gym.
During the final week, playoffs
will be held among the weekly
winners to determine an all-Uni
versity champion.
Lots of Melon
The first of two watermelon
feeds is scheduled for July 11.
The Saturday afternoon affair
will feature plenty of watermelon
and recreational activities.
Farrand concluded his report
with merit ion of the Lagunita
Dance and another dance July
25, to be presented by the men
students.
Farrand's earlier report on al
ready-staged activities stressed
the success of all three — reg
dance, all - University reception
and Lagunita open house.
The only complaint about the
open house, Farrand commented,
was a lack of girls, many of
whom, he theorized, were appre
hensive about coming stag.
Damman reported that the ini
tial Sunday flick of the quarter
had drawn well. He noted the
excellent films on tap for the
series, and predicted more good
attendances.
Legislature, dissatisfied with
this year's procedure in social cal
endar distribution, resolved to ask
the administration to in the fu
ture hand it out as registrants
file into Memorial Auditorium.
This year, the calendar was dis
tributed from a table in the pa
vilion. Many students contended
they did not know a calendar
was available, and hence received
none. This summer's social calen
dar was compiled and distributed
by administrative officials.
Happy Hours?
Also considered at the meeting,
and given to committees for fur
ther study, were possibilities of
weekly "Happy Hours" and some
sort of summer quarter roster of
students, perhaps complete with
photographs.
With confirmation of some
members, summer legislature will

ture hand it out as registrants
file into Memorial Auditorium.
This year, the calendar was dis
tributed from a table in the pa
vilion. Many students contended
they did not know a calendar
was available, and hence received
none. This summer's social calen
dar was compiled and distributed
by administrative officials.

conference room.
The accent was on the social Monday as summer quarter legisla
ture met for the first time under the gavel of President Jim Robert
son.
Vice-President Steve Farrand, the quarter's social coordinator,
announced plans for a variety of events to be climaxed by the semi-

formal Lagunita Dance on August
8.
Wednesday, the ASSU will
sponsor a bridge tournament to
be held at 7:15 in Lagunita Court.
Farrand said the emphasis would
be on the social rather than the
cut-throat. Prizes will be awarded
to the winners in the party bridge
rotation. A sign-up sheet will be
posted at the ASSU office today.
Co-Rec Swim
Also on the calendar for
Wednesday is the first in a series
of weekly ASSU co-recreational
swimming sessions. It will begin
at 7:30 p.m. in the men's pools.
Coif tournament chairman
Lawson Lowe confirmed the July
27 date for the event, and said it
would be over a nine-hole route.
Here, too, the emphasis will be on
fun, not skill.
Lowe said Hofman Jewelers in
Palo Alto have donated two silver
plates. These will go to the low
gross and low net winners. Under
the Calloway handicap system,
the 120 shooter will have as good
a chance as the par golfer of
winning the net trophy. Lowe
emphasized that the tourney is
for women as well as men.
A quarter-long activity to begin
a week from today are volleyball
tournaments. Two-man competi
tion will be held Tuesday at 4:30,
and mixed doubles Thursdays at
1:30. Signups began Tuesday at
the ASSU office and men's gym.
During the final week, playoffs
will be held among the weekly
winners to determine an all-Uni
versity champion.
Lots of Melon
The first of two watermelon
feeds is scheduled for July 11.
The Saturday afternoon affair
will feature plenty of watermelon
and recreational activities.
Farrand concluded his report
with merit ion of the Lagunita
Dance and another dance July
25, to be presented by the men
students.
Farrand's earlier report on al
ready-staged activities stressed
the success of all three — reg
dance, all - University reception
and Lagunita open house.
The only complaint about the
open house, Farrand commented,
was a lack of girls, many of
whom, he theorized, were appre
hensive about coming stag.
Damman reported that the ini
tial Sunday flick of the quarter
had drawn well. He noted the
excellent films on tap for the
series, and predicted more good
attendances.
Legislature, dissatisfied with
this year's procedure in social cal
endar distribution, resolved to ask
the administration to in the fu
ture hand it out as registrants
file into Memorial Auditorium.
