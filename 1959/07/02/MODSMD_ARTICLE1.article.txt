# Top Administration Reshuffled
## Legislature Finalizes Summer Social Plans 
### 
The accent was on the social Monday as summer quarter legisla
ture met for the first time under the gavel of President Jim Robert
son.
Vice-President Steve Farrand, the quarter's social coordinator,
announced plans for a variety of events to be climaxed by the semi-

formal Lagunita Dance on August
8.
Wednesday, the ASSU will
sponsor a bridge tournament to
be held at 7:15 in Lagunita Court.
Farrand said the emphasis would
be on the social rather than the
cut-throat. Prizes will be awarded
to the winners in the party bridge
rotation. A sign-up sheet will be
posted at the ASSU office today.
Co-Rec Swim
Also on the calendar for
Wednesday is the first in a series
of weekly ASSU co-recreational
swimming sessions. It will begin
at 7:30 p.m. in the men's pools.
Coif tournament chairman
Lawson Lowe confirmed the July
27 date for the event, and said it
would be over a nine-hole route.
Here, too, the emphasis will be on
fun, not skill.
Lowe said Hofman Jewelers in
Palo Alto have donated two silver
plates. These will go to the low
gross and low net winners. Under
the Calloway handicap system,
the 120 shooter will have as good
a chance as the par golfer of
winning the net trophy. Lowe
emphasized that the tourney is
for women as well as men.
A quarter-long activity to begin
a week from today are volleyball
tournaments. Two-man competi
tion will be held Tuesday at 4:30,
and mixed doubles Thursdays at
1:30. Signups began Tuesday at
the ASSU office and men's gym.
During the final week, playoffs
will be held among the weekly
winners to determine an all-Uni
versity champion.
Lots of Melon
The first of two watermelon
feeds is scheduled for July 11.
The Saturday afternoon affair
will feature plenty of watermelon
and recreational activities.
Farrand concluded his report
with merit ion of the Lagunita
Dance and another dance July
25, to be presented by the men
students.
Farrand's earlier report on al
ready-staged activities stressed
the success of all three — reg
dance, all - University reception
and Lagunita open house.
