# Bookstore and Post Office Progressing on Schedule
## 
### Austin Scott 
Stanford's new Bookstore-Post
Office is now about 35 per cent
completed, according to Chuck
Rhamy, job supervisor. The two
newest additions to Stanford's
physical plant should be finished
sometime in November.
The buildings are going up on
Lasuen Street across from Union
Court. There will be two separate
buildings connected by an arcade.
They are part of a multi-million
dollar Student Activity Center
proposed by the University.

Construction was held up last
winter quarter when officials
found that costs were going to be
higher than originally anticipated.
New bids were offered, and the
University accepted that of How
ard J. White, Inc., of Palo Alto.
Arcades in Place
Construction was started March
16. At present, the Bookstore ar
cades are in place and part of the
walls have been erected. The re
mainder of the arcades will start
going up today and the Bookstore
rafters will be raised tomorrow.
The arcade roofs and Bookstore
rafters are precast reinforced con
crete and were poured at the site.
They will be raised by a 70-ton
and a 35-ton crane and will be
welded in place.
The architecture of those build
ings continues in the University
tradition of buff walls and red tile
roofs. Walls of both buildings will
have large expanses of glass.
The Bookstore will have one
main floor and a second - story
mezzanine. The departments will
remain the same in kind, but will
be enlarged. This applies particu
larly to the general book depart
ment, which will carry a complete
line of paperbacks in addition to
an increased selection of cloth
bound books.
Parking Lot
Two new innovations will be a
self-service policy and a large con
trolled parking area behind the
store.
The new Post Office will be
twice as big a-s the present one.
The number of boxes will be in
creased from 1837 to 4000. There
will be no more General Delivery
except for transients. Everyone
will either have a post office box
or will get mail at his residence.
Several major changes in con
struction have been made recent
ly. The upstairs floor plan of the
Bookstore was reversed end for
end. The arcade columns, origi
nally intended to be covered with
sandstone veneer, are now to be
sandblasted marble-chip concrete.
There have been many minor
changes in both buildings.
For those who would like a
preview of the completed pro
posed Student Activity Center, the
Planning Office has a model on
exhibition. It includes the Book
store, Post Office, Dinkelspiel, old

Union, Tresidder Memorial Union
and the re-landscaped area around
these buildings.
No use has been set for the old
buildings once the move to new
quarters has been made.
The new buildings will cost the
University $487,000. The cost will
be paid with endowment money,
and the Bookstore Corporation
and the Post Office will lease the
buildings from the University.
These organizations are expect
ed to repay the cost to the Univer
sity in 25 to 30 years.

except for transients. Everyone
will either have a post office box
or will get mail at his residence.
Several major changes in con
struction have been made recent
ly. The upstairs floor plan of the
Bookstore was reversed end for
end. The arcade columns, origi
nally intended to be covered with
sandstone veneer, are now to be
sandblasted marble-chip concrete.
There have been many minor
changes in both buildings.
For those who would like a
preview of the completed pro
posed Student Activity Center, the
Planning Office has a model on
exhibition. It includes the Book
store, Post Office, Dinkelspiel, old

Union, Tresidder Memorial Union
and the re-landscaped area around
these buildings.
No use has been set for the old
buildings once the move to new
quarters has been made.
The new buildings will cost the
University $487,000. The cost will
be paid with endowment money,
and the Bookstore Corporation
and the Post Office will lease the
buildings from the University.
These organizations are expect
ed to repay the cost to the Univer
sity in 25 to 30 years.

OVERALL VIEW (ABOVE) OF ONE ARCADE AT BOOKSTORE POST OFFICE SITE
Stanford's new Bookstore-Post
Office is now about 35 per cent
completed, according to Chuck
Rhamy, job supervisor. The two
newest additions to Stanford's
physical plant should be finished
sometime in November.
The buildings are going up on
Lasuen Street across from Union
Court. There will be two separate
buildings connected by an arcade.
They are part of a multi-million
dollar Student Activity Center
proposed by the University.

Construction was held up last
winter quarter when officials
found that costs were going to be
higher than originally anticipated.
New bids were offered, and the
University accepted that of How
ard J. White, Inc., of Palo Alto.
Arcades in Place
Construction was started March
16. At present, the Bookstore ar
cades are in place and part of the
walls have been erected. The re
mainder of the arcades will start
going up today and the Bookstore
rafters will be raised tomorrow.
The arcade roofs and Bookstore
rafters are precast reinforced con
crete and were poured at the site.
They will be raised by a 70-ton
and a 35-ton crane and will be
welded in place.
The architecture of those build
ings continues in the University
tradition of buff walls and red tile
roofs. Walls of both buildings will
have large expanses of glass.
The Bookstore will have one
main floor and a second - story
mezzanine. The departments will
remain the same in kind, but will
be enlarged. This applies particu
larly to the general book depart
ment, which will carry a complete
line of paperbacks in addition to
an increased selection of cloth
bound books.
Parking Lot
Two new innovations will be a
self-service policy and a large con
trolled parking area behind the
store.
The new Post Office will be
twice as big a-s the present one.
The number of boxes will be in
creased from 1837 to 4000. There
will be no more General Delivery
except for transients. Everyone
will either have a post office box
or will get mail at his residence.
