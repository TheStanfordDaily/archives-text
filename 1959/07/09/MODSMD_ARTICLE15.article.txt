The pamphlet asks "What Makes Art Live?" but the mask Sydney
Gray ponders had only to do with death. It is a 2000-year-old Toltec
Indian funeral mask and is valued at $3000. It was recently given
the Stanford Museum by Mrs. Charlotte Mack of San Francisco.
The mask is carved from green serpentine and was found at the
Pyramid of the Sun near Mexico City.
