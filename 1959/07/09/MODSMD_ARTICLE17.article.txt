Dr. Stephen J. Kline, Stanford
associate professor of mechanical
engineering, has been chosen to
receive the Melville Medal of the
American Society of Mechanical
Engineers at the society's annual
meeting in Atlantic City this fall.
The award, one of the highest
in mechanical engineering, is to
be presented to Dr. Kline for his
paper "On the Nature of Stall."
It was adjudged by the ASME as
the best original paper of the year
on any subject.
"Stall," also known as "flow
separation," is an engineering
phenomenon which has caused
many problems in fluid handling
systems and in aerodynamics. Dr.
Kline's paper surveys the knowl
edge available on flow separation,
both from the existing literature
and from the results of his work
at Stanford, where he directs re
search on internal flow of liquids
and gases.
Dr. Kline graduated from Stan
ford in 1943, and after the war re
turned to take his Master of Sci
ence degree. He taught at Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology
while earning his doctorate, and
joined the Stanford engineering
faculty in 1952.
