# There's a Fortune in 'Widgets'
## 
### Austin Scott 
Want to make a killing in the "widgets" market?
If so, then look closely at a group of 45 students in the Stanford
Graduate School of Business' fourth annual Transportation Manage
ment Program now being held here. Because precisely what they're
trying to do is make a fortune in this weird market of an unknown
product and a compressed calendar.
The Transportation Management Program is an annual feature
of summer quarter, planned to provide certain values for middle
management executives which individual company programs cannot
ordinarily offer.
Its purposes are to enable executives to develop a general man
agement perspective, to increase their skill in diagnosing and solving
problems, to develop greater awareness and understanding of the
economic and political forces affecting the transportation industry,
and to develop increased knowledge and skill in the use of the latest
management tools and techniques.
This year's group of executives, drawn from transportation, in
dustry and military services, began studies June 22 under direction
of Gayton E. Germane, professor of transportation and management.
Slight Speedup —Four Days Equal a Year
"The Management Game" is perhaps the most interesting phase
of the over-all program, and is where the "widgets" come in. The
idea is to compress four years of business operation into sixteen days.
It is basically a decision-making exercise and is intended to teach
high-level decision making to low- and middle-management execu
tives.
Executives usually have to test their decisions in actual business
life. They pay for their mistakes in various ways, including bank
ruptcy. The severe penalties for error in modern industry have made
executives search for some method by which the young executive
may profit from his own successes and failures before he takes over
actual responsibility. "The Management Game" is the result.
The group of 45 is divided into four smaller groups, each consist
ing of four teams of two or three men each. The teams
firms engaged in manufacturing and selling widgets. No one knows
what widgets are or, indeed, anything about the market conditions
for them. Time is speeded up so that a business quarter passes in
24 hours.
In Stanford's eleclronic computing center, an IBM 650 computer
has been programed with all market conditions for widgets. In the
Management Game, men operating as a team make decisions—and
the computer spells out the consequences.
Each team receives information about itself, its competitors and
the market as a whole. As the game progresses, it is up to the teams
to figure the consequences of their own competitors' actions. The
cycle of receiving information and making decisions is repeated in
sequence to form "years" of decisions.
The game is conducted along lines that would be found in an
actual business enterprise. Certain decisions have consequences ordi
narily found in industry, but only the computer knows exactly what
they will be or how severe they are.
There is no winner in the ordinary sense. The firms are assumed
to be operating perpetually, as in real life. At the beginning of the
game, each firm sets the goals for which it wishes to stiive. At the
end, teams are rated on how well they achieved these goals, which
may be profit maximization, increasing a firm's share of the market,
or some other activity.
Decisions, Decisions, Decisions
At the outset of the game, each team is provided with a statement
of its firm's present position in the market and its operating history.
The team must then decide the price of the product, production
volume, advertising expenditures, research and development, and
expenditures and dividends. These reports are due by breakfast time
each morning.
By 2:30 the same afternoon, the computer has returned a state
ment showing sales volume, percentage share of the total market,
current inventory, production capacity for the next quarter, an in
come statement, a statement of cash receipts and disbursements, and
a statement of financial conditions. Using this information from past
quarters, each firm must then make new decisions for the current
operating period.
At the same time, they are trying to discover what widgets are,
what responses the market makes to certain changes in capital allo
cation, and market reactions in general. This is complicated by the
fact that market conditions vary with decisions other firms make.
No one firm knows what the others are doing.
The computer makes computations on the basis of mathematical
formulas based on commonplace assumptions about economic be
havior. For example, it is assumed that a product's sales are in
creased by its appeal to the consumer, and that this appeal depends
on a combination of price, quality and effective market ing techniques.
Further, it is assumed that consumer appeal is a relative matter,
depending on the counter-appeal of competitors' products. A com
pany's production cost depends on the size of its plant, efficiency of
production methods, sales volume, and so on. The variables allowed
make possible a wide variety in production and marketing tactics.
Even Computers Can He Wrong
The computer will permit most normal business operations, but
there are some it can't handle. It will not permit mergers or con
solidations, and has a limited capacity for each bit of information it
has to receive. One firm threw it off the track by selling more than
the computer had said it was possible to sell.
Imagine yourself faced with the operation of one of these firms.
When the game begins, you know only generalities. You may allocate
money to research and development in an effort to produce a better
product and cut production costs, or you may allocate more to effec
tive marketing techniques. Either is likely to increase profit, but
which will do it most effectively?
Suppose you choose advertising, and your sales jump. Then
market conditions change. How much of the increase in sales is due
to your efforts in marketing and how much to changing market
conditions? Couldn't this money be spent more effectively some
where else? What will happen if you expand your plant? Should you
increase inventory? Decisions like these must be made at least once
a day.
Two other features of the Transportation Management Program
have drawn praise. One is the policy of housing all the delegates in
their own section of Wilbur Hall. In this way, informal meetings
may be held at any timettvo v discuss work done.
Visiting speakers are guests of honor at meals for informal ex
changes of ideas and a comparison of problems in different modes
of transportation.
This session's guest speakers include Harry Bridges, president of
the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union; J. W.
Barriger, president, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad; A. P. Heiner
of Kaiser Steel Corporation; and Carroll J. Roush, president of
Oregon-Nevada-California Fast Freight, Inc.

of the over-all program, and is where the "widgets" come in. The
idea is to compress four years of business operation into sixteen days.
It is basically a decision-making exercise and is intended to teach
high-level decision making to low- and middle-management execu
tives.
Executives usually have to test their decisions in actual business
life. They pay for their mistakes in various ways, including bank
ruptcy. The severe penalties for error in modern industry have made
executives search for some method by which the young executive
may profit from his own successes and failures before he takes over
actual responsibility. "The Management Game" is the result.
The group of 45 is divided into four smaller groups, each consist
ing of four teams of two or three men each. The teams
firms engaged in manufacturing and selling widgets. No one knows
what widgets are or, indeed, anything about the market conditions
for them. Time is speeded up so that a business quarter passes in
24 hours.
In Stanford's eleclronic computing center, an IBM 650 computer
has been programed with all market conditions for widgets. In the
Management Game, men operating as a team make decisions—and
the computer spells out the consequences.
Each team receives information about itself, its competitors and
the market as a whole. As the game progresses, it is up to the teams
to figure the consequences of their own competitors' actions. The
cycle of receiving information and making decisions is repeated in
sequence to form "years" of decisions.
The game is conducted along lines that would be found in an
actual business enterprise. Certain decisions have consequences ordi
narily found in industry, but only the computer knows exactly what
they will be or how severe they are.
There is no winner in the ordinary sense. The firms are assumed
to be operating perpetually, as in real life. At the beginning of the
game, each firm sets the goals for which it wishes to stiive. At the
end, teams are rated on how well they achieved these goals, which
may be profit maximization, increasing a firm's share of the market,
or some other activity.
Decisions, Decisions, Decisions
At the outset of the game, each team is provided with a statement
of its firm's present position in the market and its operating history.
The team must then decide the price of the product, production
volume, advertising expenditures, research and development, and
expenditures and dividends. These reports are due by breakfast time
each morning.
By 2:30 the same afternoon, the computer has returned a state
ment showing sales volume, percentage share of the total market,
current inventory, production capacity for the next quarter, an in
come statement, a statement of cash receipts and disbursements, and
a statement of financial conditions. Using this information from past
quarters, each firm must then make new decisions for the current
operating period.
At the same time, they are trying to discover what widgets are,
what responses the market makes to certain changes in capital allo
cation, and market reactions in general. This is complicated by the
fact that market conditions vary with decisions other firms make.
No one firm knows what the others are doing.
The computer makes computations on the basis of mathematical
formulas based on commonplace assumptions about economic be
havior. For example, it is assumed that a product's sales are in
creased by its appeal to the consumer, and that this appeal depends
on a combination of price, quality and effective market ing techniques.
Further, it is assumed that consumer appeal is a relative matter,
depending on the counter-appeal of competitors' products. A com
pany's production cost depends on the size of its plant, efficiency of
production methods, sales volume, and so on. The variables allowed
make possible a wide variety in production and marketing tactics.
Even Computers Can He Wrong
The computer will permit most normal business operations, but
there are some it can't handle. It will not permit mergers or con
solidations, and has a limited capacity for each bit of information it
has to receive. One firm threw it off the track by selling more than
the computer had said it was possible to sell.
Imagine yourself faced with the operation of one of these firms.
When the game begins, you know only generalities. You may allocate
money to research and development in an effort to produce a better
product and cut production costs, or you may allocate more to effec
tive marketing techniques. Either is likely to increase profit, but
which will do it most effectively?
Suppose you choose advertising, and your sales jump. Then
market conditions change. How much of the increase in sales is due
to your efforts in marketing and how much to changing market
conditions? Couldn't this money be spent more effectively some
where else? What will happen if you expand your plant? Should you
increase inventory? Decisions like these must be made at least once
a day.
Two other features of the Transportation Management Program
have drawn praise. One is the policy of housing all the delegates in
their own section of Wilbur Hall. In this way, informal meetings
may be held at any timettvo v discuss work done.
Visiting speakers are guests of honor at meals for informal ex
changes of ideas and a comparison of problems in different modes
of transportation.

Want to make a killing in the "widgets" market?
If so, then look closely at a group of 45 students in the Stanford
Graduate School of Business' fourth annual Transportation Manage
ment Program now being held here. Because precisely what they're
trying to do is make a fortune in this weird market of an unknown
product and a compressed calendar.
The Transportation Management Program is an annual feature
of summer quarter, planned to provide certain values for middle
management executives which individual company programs cannot
ordinarily offer.
Its purposes are to enable executives to develop a general man
agement perspective, to increase their skill in diagnosing and solving
problems, to develop greater awareness and understanding of the
economic and political forces affecting the transportation industry,
and to develop increased knowledge and skill in the use of the latest
management tools and techniques.
This year's group of executives, drawn from transportation, in
dustry and military services, began studies June 22 under direction
of Gayton E. Germane, professor of transportation and management.

Management Game, men operating as a team make decisions—and
the computer spells out the consequences.
Each team receives information about itself, its competitors and
the market as a whole. As the game progresses, it is up to the teams
to figure the consequences of their own competitors' actions. The
cycle of receiving information and making decisions is repeated in
sequence to form "years" of decisions.
The game is conducted along lines that would be found in an
actual business enterprise. Certain decisions have consequences ordi
narily found in industry, but only the computer knows exactly what
they will be or how severe they are.
There is no winner in the ordinary sense. The firms are assumed
to be operating perpetually, as in real life. At the beginning of the
game, each firm sets the goals for which it wishes to stiive. At the
end, teams are rated on how well they achieved these goals, which
may be profit maximization, increasing a firm's share of the market,
or some other activity.
Decisions, Decisions, Decisions
At the outset of the game, each team is provided with a statement
of its firm's present position in the market and its operating history.
The team must then decide the price of the product, production
volume, advertising expenditures, research and development, and
expenditures and dividends. These reports are due by breakfast time
each morning.
By 2:30 the same afternoon, the computer has returned a state
ment showing sales volume, percentage share of the total market,
current inventory, production capacity for the next quarter, an in
come statement, a statement of cash receipts and disbursements, and
a statement of financial conditions. Using this information from past
quarters, each firm must then make new decisions for the current
operating period.
At the same time, they are trying to discover what widgets are,
what responses the market makes to certain changes in capital allo
cation, and market reactions in general. This is complicated by the
fact that market conditions vary with decisions other firms make.
No one firm knows what the others are doing.
The computer makes computations on the basis of mathematical
formulas based on commonplace assumptions about economic be
havior. For example, it is assumed that a product's sales are in
creased by its appeal to the consumer, and that this appeal depends
on a combination of price, quality and effective market ing techniques.
Further, it is assumed that consumer appeal is a relative matter,
depending on the counter-appeal of competitors' products. A com
pany's production cost depends on the size of its plant, efficiency of
production methods, sales volume, and so on. The variables allowed
make possible a wide variety in production and marketing tactics.
Even Computers Can He Wrong
The computer will permit most normal business operations, but
there are some it can't handle. It will not permit mergers or con
solidations, and has a limited capacity for each bit of information it
has to receive. One firm threw it off the track by selling more than
the computer had said it was possible to sell.
Imagine yourself faced with the operation of one of these firms.
When the game begins, you know only generalities. You may allocate
money to research and development in an effort to produce a better
product and cut production costs, or you may allocate more to effec
tive marketing techniques. Either is likely to increase profit, but
which will do it most effectively?
Suppose you choose advertising, and your sales jump. Then
market conditions change. How much of the increase in sales is due
to your efforts in marketing and how much to changing market
conditions? Couldn't this money be spent more effectively some
where else? What will happen if you expand your plant? Should you
increase inventory? Decisions like these must be made at least once
a day.
Two other features of the Transportation Management Program
have drawn praise. One is the policy of housing all the delegates in
their own section of Wilbur Hall. In this way, informal meetings
may be held at any timettvo v discuss work done.
Visiting speakers are guests of honor at meals for informal ex
changes of ideas and a comparison of problems in different modes
of transportation.
This session's guest speakers include Harry Bridges, president of
the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union; J. W.

Want to make a killing in the "widgets" market?
If so, then look closely at a group of 45 students in the Stanford
Graduate School of Business' fourth annual Transportation Manage
ment Program now being held here. Because precisely what they're
trying to do is make a fortune in this weird market of an unknown
product and a compressed calendar.
The Transportation Management Program is an annual feature
of summer quarter, planned to provide certain values for middle
management executives which individual company programs cannot
ordinarily offer.
Its purposes are to enable executives to develop a general man
agement perspective, to increase their skill in diagnosing and solving
problems, to develop greater awareness and understanding of the
economic and political forces affecting the transportation industry,
and to develop increased knowledge and skill in the use of the latest
management tools and techniques.
This year's group of executives, drawn from transportation, in
dustry and military services, began studies June 22 under direction
of Gayton E. Germane, professor of transportation and management.
Slight Speedup —Four Days Equal a Year
"The Management Game" is perhaps the most interesting phase
of the over-all program, and is where the "widgets" come in. The
idea is to compress four years of business operation into sixteen days.
It is basically a decision-making exercise and is intended to teach
high-level decision making to low- and middle-management execu
tives.
Executives usually have to test their decisions in actual business
life. They pay for their mistakes in various ways, including bank
ruptcy. The severe penalties for error in modern industry have made
executives search for some method by which the young executive
may profit from his own successes and failures before he takes over
actual responsibility. "The Management Game" is the result.
The group of 45 is divided into four smaller groups, each consist
ing of four teams of two or three men each. The teams
firms engaged in manufacturing and selling widgets. No one knows
what widgets are or, indeed, anything about the market conditions
for them. Time is speeded up so that a business quarter passes in

of its firm's present position in the market and its operating history.
The team must then decide the price of the product, production
volume, advertising expenditures, research and development, and
expenditures and dividends. These reports are due by breakfast time
each morning.
By 2:30 the same afternoon, the computer has returned a state
ment showing sales volume, percentage share of the total market,
current inventory, production capacity for the next quarter, an in
come statement, a statement of cash receipts and disbursements, and
a statement of financial conditions. Using this information from past
quarters, each firm must then make new decisions for the current
operating period.
At the same time, they are trying to discover what widgets are,
what responses the market makes to certain changes in capital allo
cation, and market reactions in general. This is complicated by the
fact that market conditions vary with decisions other firms make.
No one firm knows what the others are doing.
The computer makes computations on the basis of mathematical
formulas based on commonplace assumptions about economic be
havior. For example, it is assumed that a product's sales are in
creased by its appeal to the consumer, and that this appeal depends
on a combination of price, quality and effective market ing techniques.
Further, it is assumed that consumer appeal is a relative matter,
depending on the counter-appeal of competitors' products. A com
pany's production cost depends on the size of its plant, efficiency of
production methods, sales volume, and so on. The variables allowed
make possible a wide variety in production and marketing tactics.
Even Computers Can He Wrong
The computer will permit most normal business operations, but
there are some it can't handle. It will not permit mergers or con
solidations, and has a limited capacity for each bit of information it
has to receive. One firm threw it off the track by selling more than
the computer had said it was possible to sell.
Imagine yourself faced with the operation of one of these firms.
When the game begins, you know only generalities. You may allocate
money to research and development in an effort to produce a better
product and cut production costs, or you may allocate more to effec
tive marketing techniques. Either is likely to increase profit, but
which will do it most effectively?
Suppose you choose advertising, and your sales jump. Then
market conditions change. How much of the increase in sales is due
to your efforts in marketing and how much to changing market
conditions? Couldn't this money be spent more effectively some
where else? What will happen if you expand your plant? Should you
increase inventory? Decisions like these must be made at least once
a day.
Two other features of the Transportation Management Program
have drawn praise. One is the policy of housing all the delegates in
their own section of Wilbur Hall. In this way, informal meetings
may be held at any timettvo v discuss work done.
Visiting speakers are guests of honor at meals for informal ex
changes of ideas and a comparison of problems in different modes
of transportation.
This session's guest speakers include Harry Bridges, president of
the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union; J. W.
Barriger, president, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad; A. P. Heiner
of Kaiser Steel Corporation; and Carroll J. Roush, president of
Oregon-Nevada-California Fast Freight, Inc.
Want to make a killing in the "widgets" market?
If so, then look closely at a group of 45 students in the Stanford
Graduate School of Business' fourth annual Transportation Manage
ment Program now being held here. Because precisely what they're
trying to do is make a fortune in this weird market of an unknown
product and a compressed calendar.
The Transportation Management Program is an annual feature
of summer quarter, planned to provide certain values for middle
management executives which individual company programs cannot
ordinarily offer.
Its purposes are to enable executives to develop a general man
agement perspective, to increase their skill in diagnosing and solving
problems, to develop greater awareness and understanding of the
economic and political forces affecting the transportation industry,
and to develop increased knowledge and skill in the use of the latest
management tools and techniques.
This year's group of executives, drawn from transportation, in
dustry and military services, began studies June 22 under direction
of Gayton E. Germane, professor of transportation and management.
Slight Speedup —Four Days Equal a Year
"The Management Game" is perhaps the most interesting phase
of the over-all program, and is where the "widgets" come in. The
idea is to compress four years of business operation into sixteen days.
It is basically a decision-making exercise and is intended to teach
high-level decision making to low- and middle-management execu
tives.
Executives usually have to test their decisions in actual business
life. They pay for their mistakes in various ways, including bank
ruptcy. The severe penalties for error in modern industry have made
executives search for some method by which the young executive
may profit from his own successes and failures before he takes over
actual responsibility. "The Management Game" is the result.
The group of 45 is divided into four smaller groups, each consist
ing of four teams of two or three men each. The teams
firms engaged in manufacturing and selling widgets. No one knows
what widgets are or, indeed, anything about the market conditions
for them. Time is speeded up so that a business quarter passes in
24 hours.
In Stanford's eleclronic computing center, an IBM 650 computer
has been programed with all market conditions for widgets. In the
Management Game, men operating as a team make decisions—and
the computer spells out the consequences.
Each team receives information about itself, its competitors and
the market as a whole. As the game progresses, it is up to the teams
to figure the consequences of their own competitors' actions. The
cycle of receiving information and making decisions is repeated in
sequence to form "years" of decisions.
The game is conducted along lines that would be found in an
actual business enterprise. Certain decisions have consequences ordi
narily found in industry, but only the computer knows exactly what
they will be or how severe they are.
There is no winner in the ordinary sense. The firms are assumed
to be operating perpetually, as in real life. At the beginning of the
game, each firm sets the goals for which it wishes to stiive. At the
end, teams are rated on how well they achieved these goals, which
may be profit maximization, increasing a firm's share of the market,
or some other activity.
