## Summer's Recreation Discussed 
### 
Dances — when, where and in
some cases even why—took up
most of the discussion time Mon
day night as summer quarter
legislature met for the second
time.
An idea submitted by Austen
Lauw-Zeeha touched off what
may amount to an almost com
plete revision in the two remain
ing all-campus dances on the sum
mer quarter social calendar.
Lauw-Zecha's proposal was for
both the men's-sponsored and La
gunita dances to be scrapped in
favor of a one-night overnight
at Carmel. This plan met with
legislature's disfavor on several
counts including questions of
distance, attendance and whether
it might tear down the bond that
summer social functions are sup
posed to create between graduate
and undergraduate students.
Alternatives
Alternative proposals included
an all-day recreation and dance
program at a place such as Adobe
Creek Lodge.
After losing on a motion to
hold the overnight, Lauw-Zecha
asked legislature to consider the
possibility of holding the men's
dance off campus, as had been
done last summer. A year ago, an
afternoon swimming session fol
lowed by a buffet and dancing
at Rickey's was staged, and at
tracted a sell-out crowd.
This plan met with full ap
proval, and Lauw-Zecha will now
move ahead with plans for such
a function on July 25.
Dances "A Drag?"
Talk then shifted to the August
8 Lagunita semi-formal. The sur
prising opinion of many at legis
lature was that such dormitory
dances " are a drag."
Vice-President Steve Farrand
suggested a street dance mas
querade party as a substitute,
and the idea met with some favor.
Most of the rest of the meeting
was taken up with reviews of
plans for coming social functions
and with committee reports. A
resolution asking the administra
tion to have persons hand out
next summer's social calendar at
the Pavilion was passed after
President Jim Robertson reported
the administration realized short
comings in the distribution sys
tem used this year.

legislature's disfavor on several
counts including questions of
distance, attendance and whether
it might tear down the bond that
summer social functions are sup
posed to create between graduate
and undergraduate students.
Alternatives
Alternative proposals included
an all-day recreation and dance
program at a place such as Adobe
Creek Lodge.
After losing on a motion to
hold the overnight, Lauw-Zecha
asked legislature to consider the
possibility of holding the men's
dance off campus, as had been
done last summer. A year ago, an
afternoon swimming session fol
lowed by a buffet and dancing
at Rickey's was staged, and at
tracted a sell-out crowd.
This plan met with full ap
proval, and Lauw-Zecha will now
move ahead with plans for such
a function on July 25.
Dances "A Drag?"
Talk then shifted to the August
8 Lagunita semi-formal. The sur
prising opinion of many at legis
lature was that such dormitory
dances " are a drag."
Vice-President Steve Farrand
suggested a street dance mas
querade party as a substitute,
and the idea met with some favor.
Most of the rest of the meeting
was taken up with reviews of
plans for coming social functions
and with committee reports. A
resolution asking the administra
tion to have persons hand out
next summer's social calendar at
the Pavilion was passed after
President Jim Robertson reported
the administration realized short
comings in the distribution sys
tem used this year.
Dances — when, where and in
some cases even why—took up
most of the discussion time Mon
day night as summer quarter
legislature met for the second
time.
An idea submitted by Austen
Lauw-Zeeha touched off what
may amount to an almost com
plete revision in the two remain
ing all-campus dances on the sum
mer quarter social calendar.
Lauw-Zecha's proposal was for
both the men's-sponsored and La
gunita dances to be scrapped in
favor of a one-night overnight
at Carmel. This plan met with
legislature's disfavor on several
counts including questions of
distance, attendance and whether
it might tear down the bond that
summer social functions are sup
posed to create between graduate
and undergraduate students.
