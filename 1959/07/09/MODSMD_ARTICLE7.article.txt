# Summer Directory Completed; 1200 Go on Sale Today for 10c
## 
### 
A directory of summer quarter
students—thought to be the first
of its kind at Stanford—will be
sold beginning today at noon.
Costing 10 cents, the listing of
more than 2000 students will be
sold at the post office, library
and engineering corner.
Ruby Yaryan, who headed the
project, said the book will contain
names, home addresses, campus
residence or local address, year,
major and phone number of each
student listed.
And, for some odd reason, the
marital status will also be in
cluded.

Twelve hundred copies of the
15 to 18-page legal-size directory
will be available.
President Jim Robertson hailed
the directory as an excellent proj
ect by Legislature, and said it
should be most beneficial in pro
moting summer quarter student
contact.
It represents one of the fastest
completed undertakings by any
legislature. Idea for the directory
was proposed only a week ago,
but in the interlude data was
gathered, processed and mimeo
graphed for the publication.
