# 1000 Pounds of Melon Set for Saturday Feed
## Eating Contest Will Highlight Afternoon Feast 
### 
Half a ton of watermelon is just
itching to be eaten.
But by 5 p.m. Saturday, its
wish will have probably been
granted.
Because by that time, Stanford
summer quarterites will have just
completed the first of two giant
watermelon feeds scheduled for
the next four weeks.
The all-campus function, slated
for 2-5 p.m. at the women's gym
athletic fields, will have more
than just the half-ton of watery
stuff.
More Features
Feed chairman Marilyn Funk
reported to Legislature Monday
that volleyball, softball and swim
ming would be featured—but that
these will be secondary in com
parison to a 15-minute melon- eat
ing contest.
Prizes of an undtermined na
ture, she said, will be awarded to
the man (actually, it COULD be
a woman) who eats the most
melon between 2:45 and 3 p.m.
Miss Funk refused comment on
reports that the prizes might con
sist of helping solve her most dif
ficult planning problem—getting
rid of the rinds.
Miss Funk, it seems, has had
difficulties arranging a disposal
system that won't cost almost as
much as the half-ton of melon.
At last reports, she was consider
ing the possibility of requiring
guests to eat rind and seeds if
they tackled the rest of a melon.
Miss Funk said men would be
allowed to swim without being
guests of women students. Fac
ulty members and graduates may
also swim, but no children or pets
will be permitted.
Dressing rooms will be pro
vided, but there will be no towel
service, and guests will be respon
sible for valuables, she added.
