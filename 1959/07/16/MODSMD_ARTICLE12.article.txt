# No, Those Aren't Subversives

### Camille Petersen 
Russky Gorodok was a normal,
congenial living group—the regu
lar joking at meals about studies,
the funny comments . . . and then
suddenly on the morning of the
7th quiet seemed to reign. There
was a strange system of sign lan
guage adopted . . . and after each
meal there was a mad dash for
the safety of the front lawn.
July 7 went down in the annals
of 25 residents and additional club
members as the clay on which the
English language was outlawed
and Russian took over.
It's Co-ed
Russky Gorodok is the coeduca
tional Russian-language house es
tablished to aid those taking
either first- or second-year inten
sified Russian in learning to speak
the language as well as read it.

As an added incentive to strug
gle along with a meager vocabu
lary and keep from resorting to
English, Svinka was established.
Now, Svinka (Russian for pig) is
an extremely hungry piggy bank,
and each time someone says an
English sentence in the house he
must feed Svinka five rubles. It
was found, however, that the vo
cabulary of the first-year students
was not sufficient at this point
to permit them to say enough to
prevent utter frustration, so the
rule was relaxed for a short time.
Now, however, Svinka has reach
ed the near-starvation point, so
English is again, and for keeps,
outlawed.
Labeled Goods
Anyone walking into the house
finds himself faced at every turn
with labels giving the Russian
equivalent for each object. In the

dining room are large of
declensions, conjugations and
prepositions. On the blackboard
near the kitchen door are helpful
phrases such as "Please pass,"
"Excuse me," and the Russian
names for foods. The meals are
prepared by a Russian cook, Mrs.
Olga Kalv, who cooks for the
Kappa Sigma house during the
regular school year.
Idea for the house began with
two students, Jerry Hirsch and
Jim Morrison, last fall. After
many meetings the plan was
okayed by the Administration
spring quarter. The entire house
was a student idea and all of the
arrangements for its establish
ment were done by the students.
Mrs. Anna Shuller was hired as
house director and the Beta Theta
Phi fraternity house was rented
for a residence. All financial as

pects of the program were plan
ned by David Korten.
The Board
An administrative board was
established to facilitate the mak
ing of arrangements for the house
opening. It consisted of Morrison
as house manager, Hirsch pro
gram chairman, Korten financial
manager, Frank Stillman work
chairman, and Pat O'Neill social
chairman. Dave Quarles took over
the job of house manager when
Morrison accepted an opportunity
to go to Europe for the summer.
The coeducational feature of
the house makes it possible for
the students to function as a unit
rather than as two separate
groups. Because of the high pres
sure during the week, Saturday is
set aside for relaxation. House
planned activities ranging from
picnics to a night in the City help
relieve the tension of trying to
learn nine months' work in ten
weeks. Even during these "off
hours," however, Russian is not
forgotten.
A Russian Serenade
Fifteen students invaded the
City for a night, and near the
close of the evening they sere
naded cable car passengers with
Rusisan songs from the Mark
Hopkins to Fisherman's Wharf
and back again. They were joined
by one man who shouted, "Long
live the Tsar!" and "Da svedan
ya!" as he left.
Everything about the house is
directed toward obtaining a bet
ter understanding of the Russian
language and of the Russian peo
ple. Mrs. Shuller, who also teach
es one of the University sections
of Russian 5, holds drill sessions
each afternoon for the students.
Besides this, there are tapes avail
able for all of the lessons in the
textbook. These are available to
the students in a study room at
all times. Blackboards have been
set up for use during the drill ses
sions and individual practice.
Russian magazines and news
papers are available and the Rus
sian song books are being put to
good use.
A club membership entitles the
holder to take part in all house
activities . . . hear guest speakers,
come to the house to practice
•speaking Russian, attend picnics,
and take part in the Russian danc
ing lessons, which are being given
Friday nights. Seventeen people
are taking advantage of club
memberships.
Russky Gorodok is not without
mascots. First, there is Meshka
(Mike), the dog, and then two
parakeets, Georgie and Blue Boy.
Even the mascots are an incentive
to learn to speak Russian . . . par
akeets can learn to talk . . . and
the students would hate to be put
to shame by a couple of birds.

the language as well as read it.

As an added incentive to strug
gle along with a meager vocabu
lary and keep from resorting to
English, Svinka was established.
Now, Svinka (Russian for pig) is
an extremely hungry piggy bank,
and each time someone says an
English sentence in the house he
must feed Svinka five rubles. It
was found, however, that the vo
cabulary of the first-year students
was not sufficient at this point
to permit them to say enough to
prevent utter frustration, so the
rule was relaxed for a short time.
Now, however, Svinka has reach
ed the near-starvation point, so
English is again, and for keeps,
outlawed.
Labeled Goods
Anyone walking into the house
finds himself faced at every turn
with labels giving the Russian
equivalent for each object. In the

dining room are large of
declensions, conjugations and
prepositions. On the blackboard
near the kitchen door are helpful
phrases such as "Please pass,"
"Excuse me," and the Russian
names for foods. The meals are
prepared by a Russian cook, Mrs.
Olga Kalv, who cooks for the
Kappa Sigma house during the
regular school year.
Idea for the house began with
two students, Jerry Hirsch and
Jim Morrison, last fall. After
many meetings the plan was
okayed by the Administration
spring quarter. The entire house
was a student idea and all of the
arrangements for its establish
ment were done by the students.
Mrs. Anna Shuller was hired as
house director and the Beta Theta
Phi fraternity house was rented
for a residence. All financial as

pects of the program were plan
ned by David Korten.
The Board
An administrative board was
established to facilitate the mak
ing of arrangements for the house
opening. It consisted of Morrison
as house manager, Hirsch pro
gram chairman, Korten financial
manager, Frank Stillman work
chairman, and Pat O'Neill social
chairman. Dave Quarles took over
the job of house manager when
Morrison accepted an opportunity
to go to Europe for the summer.
The coeducational feature of
the house makes it possible for
the students to function as a unit
rather than as two separate
groups. Because of the high pres
sure during the week, Saturday is
set aside for relaxation. House
planned activities ranging from
picnics to a night in the City help
relieve the tension of trying to
learn nine months' work in ten
weeks. Even during these "off
hours," however, Russian is not
forgotten.
A Russian Serenade
Fifteen students invaded the
City for a night, and near the
close of the evening they sere
naded cable car passengers with
Rusisan songs from the Mark
Hopkins to Fisherman's Wharf
and back again. They were joined
by one man who shouted, "Long
live the Tsar!" and "Da svedan
ya!" as he left.
Everything about the house is
directed toward obtaining a bet
ter understanding of the Russian
language and of the Russian peo
ple. Mrs. Shuller, who also teach
es one of the University sections
of Russian 5, holds drill sessions
each afternoon for the students.
Besides this, there are tapes avail
able for all of the lessons in the
textbook. These are available to
the students in a study room at
all times. Blackboards have been
set up for use during the drill ses
sions and individual practice.
Russian magazines and news
papers are available and the Rus
sian song books are being put to
good use.
A club membership entitles the
holder to take part in all house
activities . . . hear guest speakers,
come to the house to practice
•speaking Russian, attend picnics,
and take part in the Russian danc
ing lessons, which are being given
Friday nights. Seventeen people
are taking advantage of club
memberships.
Russky Gorodok is not without
mascots. First, there is Meshka
(Mike), the dog, and then two
parakeets, Georgie and Blue Boy.
Even the mascots are an incentive
to learn to speak Russian . . . par
akeets can learn to talk . . . and
the students would hate to be put
to shame by a couple of birds.

finds himself faced at every turn
with labels giving the Russian
equivalent for each object. In the

dining room are large of
declensions, conjugations and
prepositions. On the blackboard
near the kitchen door are helpful
phrases such as "Please pass,"
"Excuse me," and the Russian
names for foods. The meals are
prepared by a Russian cook, Mrs.
Olga Kalv, who cooks for the
Kappa Sigma house during the
regular school year.
Idea for the house began with
two students, Jerry Hirsch and
Jim Morrison, last fall. After
many meetings the plan was
okayed by the Administration
spring quarter. The entire house
was a student idea and all of the
arrangements for its establish
ment were done by the students.
Mrs. Anna Shuller was hired as
house director and the Beta Theta
Phi fraternity house was rented
for a residence. All financial as

pects of the program were plan
ned by David Korten.
The Board
An administrative board was
established to facilitate the mak
ing of arrangements for the house
opening. It consisted of Morrison
as house manager, Hirsch pro
gram chairman, Korten financial
manager, Frank Stillman work
chairman, and Pat O'Neill social
chairman. Dave Quarles took over
the job of house manager when
Morrison accepted an opportunity
to go to Europe for the summer.
The coeducational feature of
the house makes it possible for
the students to function as a unit
rather than as two separate
groups. Because of the high pres
sure during the week, Saturday is
set aside for relaxation. House
planned activities ranging from
picnics to a night in the City help
relieve the tension of trying to
learn nine months' work in ten
weeks. Even during these "off
hours," however, Russian is not
forgotten.
A Russian Serenade
Fifteen students invaded the
City for a night, and near the
close of the evening they sere
naded cable car passengers with
Rusisan songs from the Mark
Hopkins to Fisherman's Wharf
and back again. They were joined
by one man who shouted, "Long
live the Tsar!" and "Da svedan
ya!" as he left.
Everything about the house is
directed toward obtaining a bet
ter understanding of the Russian
language and of the Russian peo
ple. Mrs. Shuller, who also teach
es one of the University sections
of Russian 5, holds drill sessions
each afternoon for the students.
Besides this, there are tapes avail
able for all of the lessons in the
textbook. These are available to
the students in a study room at
all times. Blackboards have been
set up for use during the drill ses
sions and individual practice.
Russian magazines and news
papers are available and the Rus
sian song books are being put to
good use.
A club membership entitles the
holder to take part in all house
activities . . . hear guest speakers,
come to the house to practice
•speaking Russian, attend picnics,
and take part in the Russian danc
ing lessons, which are being given
Friday nights. Seventeen people
are taking advantage of club
memberships.
Russky Gorodok is not without
mascots. First, there is Meshka
(Mike), the dog, and then two
parakeets, Georgie and Blue Boy.
Even the mascots are an incentive
to learn to speak Russian . . . par
akeets can learn to talk . . . and
the students would hate to be put
to shame by a couple of birds.

HOUSE DIRECTOR WATCHES STUDENT IN BLACKBOARD DRILLS
But Don't Try to Read That Writing—lt's in Russian
Russky Gorodok was a normal,
congenial living group—the regu
lar joking at meals about studies,
the funny comments . . . and then
suddenly on the morning of the
7th quiet seemed to reign. There
was a strange system of sign lan
guage adopted . . . and after each
meal there was a mad dash for
the safety of the front lawn.
July 7 went down in the annals
of 25 residents and additional club
members as the clay on which the
English language was outlawed
and Russian took over.
It's Co-ed
Russky Gorodok is the coeduca
tional Russian-language house es
tablished to aid those taking
either first- or second-year inten
sified Russian in learning to speak
the language as well as read it.

As an added incentive to strug
gle along with a meager vocabu
lary and keep from resorting to
English, Svinka was established.
Now, Svinka (Russian for pig) is
an extremely hungry piggy bank,
and each time someone says an
English sentence in the house he
must feed Svinka five rubles. It
was found, however, that the vo
cabulary of the first-year students
was not sufficient at this point
to permit them to say enough to
prevent utter frustration, so the
rule was relaxed for a short time.
Now, however, Svinka has reach
ed the near-starvation point, so
English is again, and for keeps,
outlawed.
