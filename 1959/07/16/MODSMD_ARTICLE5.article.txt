# ‘M’s’ Fate Still Unknown
## New Hearings On Proposal Seem Favorable 
### 
The fate of Stanford's Project
M hung in the hands of Joint Con
gressional Committee on Atomic
Energy today following two days
of testimony on the proposed two
mile linear accelerator.
The $105 million, six-year proj
ect, slated to be built in hills be
hind the campus proper, appeared
a certainty in the spring when
President Eisenhower requested
Congress to appropriate funds for
its construction.
But last week, shortly before
hearings in front of the Research
and Development Subcommittee
of the atomic energy committee,
opposition to the Stanford site ap
peared in the form of proposals
to put the installation in any of
several other areas.
Favorable Testimony
Stanford's hopes, however, still
appear good following a raft of
testimony in favor of the site here,
some of it by Stanford officials
who were asked by the committee
to give facts.
Most prominently mentioned as
an alternate site was an aban
doned railroad tunnel near Ever
ett, Wash. But Atomic Energy
Commission research director Dr.
John H. Williams said it would
cost an additional $10 million to
use the tunnel.
Working even more in favor of
the Stanford site, however, ap
pears to be the fact that a scien
tific community already well vers
ed in operation of linear acceler
ators exists here. In addition, the
facility could be more effectively
utilized for teaching future scien
tists here than at the isolated
Washington location.
Little Earthquake Fear
Objections to Stanford on the
grounds of possible earthquake
damage were minimized by Wil
-lia m s, who said five separate
firms had studied the location and
found it not to be underlied by the
San Andreas Fault.
Stanford's position in the hear
ings was only to present its offer
of land at $1 per year and infor
mation about how the installation
might operate, rather than to in
any sense lobby for the project.
AEC spokesmen as well as area
Congressmen Charles Gubser of
Gilroy and J. Arthur Younger of
San Mateo emphasized that Stan
ford personnel have pioneered the
linear accelerator field.
Representatives from universi
ties including Princeton, the Mid
western Universities Research As
sociation and the Harvard - MIT
electron accelerator project testi
fied yesterday, but only to pre
sent their information and not to
oppose Stanford as a site.
Professor Edward L. Ginzton,
director of the Stanford Micro
wave Laboratory, headed the Uni
versity delegation to the hearings.
With him were Robert Moulton,
assistant to the president; Fred
erick Pindar, associate director of
Hansen Laboratories; and Rich
ard Neal, senior research associ
ate at the Microwave Laboratory.

mile linear accelerator.
The $105 million, six-year proj
ect, slated to be built in hills be
hind the campus proper, appeared
a certainty in the spring when
President Eisenhower requested
Congress to appropriate funds for
its construction.
But last week, shortly before
hearings in front of the Research
and Development Subcommittee
of the atomic energy committee,
opposition to the Stanford site ap
peared in the form of proposals
to put the installation in any of
several other areas.
Favorable Testimony
Stanford's hopes, however, still
appear good following a raft of
testimony in favor of the site here,
some of it by Stanford officials
who were asked by the committee
to give facts.
Most prominently mentioned as
an alternate site was an aban
doned railroad tunnel near Ever
ett, Wash. But Atomic Energy
Commission research director Dr.
John H. Williams said it would
cost an additional $10 million to
use the tunnel.
Working even more in favor of
the Stanford site, however, ap
pears to be the fact that a scien
tific community already well vers
ed in operation of linear acceler
ators exists here. In addition, the
facility could be more effectively
utilized for teaching future scien
tists here than at the isolated
Washington location.
Little Earthquake Fear
Objections to Stanford on the
grounds of possible earthquake
damage were minimized by Wil
-lia m s, who said five separate
firms had studied the location and
found it not to be underlied by the
San Andreas Fault.
Stanford's position in the hear
ings was only to present its offer
of land at $1 per year and infor
mation about how the installation
might operate, rather than to in
any sense lobby for the project.
AEC spokesmen as well as area
Congressmen Charles Gubser of
Gilroy and J. Arthur Younger of
San Mateo emphasized that Stan
ford personnel have pioneered the
linear accelerator field.
Representatives from universi
ties including Princeton, the Mid
western Universities Research As
sociation and the Harvard - MIT
electron accelerator project testi
fied yesterday, but only to pre
sent their information and not to
oppose Stanford as a site.
Professor Edward L. Ginzton,
director of the Stanford Micro
wave Laboratory, headed the Uni
versity delegation to the hearings.
With him were Robert Moulton,
assistant to the president; Fred
erick Pindar, associate director of
Hansen Laboratories; and Rich
ard Neal, senior research associ
ate at the Microwave Laboratory.
The fate of Stanford's Project
M hung in the hands of Joint Con
gressional Committee on Atomic
Energy today following two days
of testimony on the proposed two
mile linear accelerator.
