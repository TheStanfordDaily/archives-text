Now you see it —now you don't. That was the story Saturday at
the all-campus watermelon feed, so far as 1,000 pounds of water
melon were concerned. You saw them at 2 p.m., hut by 3:30 nothing
was left —except a few rinds. The feed featured touch football,
volleyball, swimming and a watermelon eating contest. Co-winners
of the contest were Jack Griggs and Terry Schwaegler. They
shared the prize—a whole watermelon! Oh, yes—and what do you
think the Lagunita dining room served at lunch Saturday? Why,
watermelon —what else ?
