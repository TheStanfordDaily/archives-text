Group Splits
The first non-unanimous vote of
the summer Legislature session
occurred when the body split 4-2
in favor of assessing the Wilbur
Club dues.
Through an oversight, Wilbur
residents were not billed for the
usual $2 social dues as were other
dorm residents.
Debate on the measure centered
about the lateness of an assess
ment now and whether or not to
bill persons taking part in special
summer programs.
Confined Billing
Undergraduate men's represent
atives Lauw-Zecha and Jay Lamb
both opposed any billing, but
Lamb suggested that if Legisla
ture did favor billing, it should be
confined to Soto and Trancos.
He said other wings of Wilbur
were composed predominantly of
older persons taking part in spe
cial programs, many of whom had
already paid a social fee through
registration in their programs.
Appropriations were granted to
Education Council and the Inter
national Club for use in social
hours. Ed Council got not more
than $120 to use with $40 of its
own money in holding all-campus
desserts July 23 and August 6.
I-Club got $20 for its weekly cof
fee hours.

dorm residents.
Debate on the measure centered
about the lateness of an assess
ment now and whether or not to
bill persons taking part in special
summer programs.
Confined Billing
Undergraduate men's represent
atives Lauw-Zecha and Jay Lamb
both opposed any billing, but
Lamb suggested that if Legisla
ture did favor billing, it should be
confined to Soto and Trancos.
He said other wings of Wilbur
were composed predominantly of
older persons taking part in spe
cial programs, many of whom had
already paid a social fee through
registration in their programs.
Appropriations were granted to
Education Council and the Inter
national Club for use in social
hours. Ed Council got not more
than $120 to use with $40 of its
own money in holding all-campus
desserts July 23 and August 6.
I-Club got $20 for its weekly cof
fee hours.

ner and dance July 25 at Rickey's
Studio Inn and a vote to assess
Wilbur Club dues on Soto and
Trancos highlighted M on d a y's
