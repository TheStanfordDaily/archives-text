# Stanford In—Big 4 Becomes 5
## 
### Dick Barnes 
A step that was not unexpected, yet was surprising
from the time standpoint, was taken Thursday after
noon when Stanford announced that it would join the
Athletic Association of Western Universities.
In becoming a member of what is now the Big Five,
Stanford has assured itself continued competition with
California, UCLA, Washington and Southern Califor
nia.
The luring of Stanford into the fold constitutes a
major diplomatic victory for the other four schools,
which had tried to get Stanford to join ever since an
nouncement of the formation of the new circuit. In
addition to the tangible benefit of gaining better sched
ule possibilities through the addition of the Indians,
the Big Four gains greatly in respectability.
The four original members all were rocked with
heavy penalties and probations by the old Pacific
Coast Conference and the NCAA several years ago
as a result of recruiting irregularities. It was these
schools' anger at the penalties which led to the break
up of the PCC, which passed from existence June 30.
Consequently, when the four laid plans for their new
league, many observers wondered if it were merely a
haven for recruiting violators, or whether the four
were seriously interested in operating honestly under
a reasonable code.

Schools in other sections of the country looked to
Stanford for the verdict on the Big Four. If Stanford
joined, they reasoned, the new league must be on the
up-and-up. If the Indians stayed out, there must be at
least indications that all was not well.
Stanford, of course, was caught in the middle. Be
cause of its position taken during the PCC scandals,
the Indians were certainly not the best of friends with
the Big Four. From the outset, however, the Big Four
wooed Stanford—to both gain respectability and help
bring the league up to a better size.
Geography and traditional rivalries have dictated
that Stanford join. While football schedules are firm
for the next five years and include yearly games with
all of the four, scheduling in other sports would suffer
to some extent without a league structure and would
be drastically hit if the Big Four decided to quit sched
uling Stanford.
But again—holding Stanford from an immediate de
cision to join was the desire to feel assured that the
new organization was not merely a cover-up for shady
recruiting. Further, Stanford wished to be assured
that enforcement of recruiting rules was in the hands
of the president of each institution, not merely faculty
representatives.
Stanford weighed these and other factors, including
future Rose Bowl revenues, for many months before
making its decision. Many expected the announcement

to come by July 1, the charter date for the AAWU.
When it didn't come then, it appeared that Stanford
would observe the new league in operation for at least
a year. Though Stanford missed the charter deadline
by more than two weeks, it has now been revealed that
it had told the Big Four of its intention to join and has
thus been accorded the status of charter member.
I he key step in the move to join was the recommen
dation to the Board of Trustees by President Wallace
Sterling. This was made at the Board's Thursday
meeting, was approved, and was then quickly followed
by the official announcement.
Simultaneous statements were made by presidents
of the other four schools, all welcoming Stanford to
the AAWU and expressing confidence in the circuit's
future.
Scheduling arrangements for the first year of opera
tion are still incomplete. Football, of course, is already
set, and basketball has set up a round-robin wherein
each team will meet the other three times. But if,
when and where championship meets in such sports
as track and swimming will be held won't be known
for at least a couple of months.
Administratively, the league operates differently
from the PCC. Heading the office is ex-Pittsburgh
athletic director Tom Hamilton, whose job is to pro
mote league welfare rather than act as a policeman.

by more than two weeks, it has now been revealed that
it had told the Big Four of its intention to join and has
thus been accorded the status of charter member.
I he key step in the move to join was the recommen
dation to the Board of Trustees by President Wallace
Sterling. This was made at the Board's Thursday
meeting, was approved, and was then quickly followed
by the official announcement.
Simultaneous statements were made by presidents
of the other four schools, all welcoming Stanford to
the AAWU and expressing confidence in the circuit's
future.
Scheduling arrangements for the first year of opera
tion are still incomplete. Football, of course, is already
set, and basketball has set up a round-robin wherein
each team will meet the other three times. But if,
when and where championship meets in such sports
as track and swimming will be held won't be known
for at least a couple of months.
Administratively, the league operates differently
from the PCC. Heading the office is ex-Pittsburgh
athletic director Tom Hamilton, whose job is to pro
mote league welfare rather than act as a policeman.
A step that was not unexpected, yet was surprising
from the time standpoint, was taken Thursday after
noon when Stanford announced that it would join the
Athletic Association of Western Universities.
In becoming a member of what is now the Big Five,
Stanford has assured itself continued competition with
California, UCLA, Washington and Southern Califor
nia.
The luring of Stanford into the fold constitutes a
major diplomatic victory for the other four schools,
which had tried to get Stanford to join ever since an
nouncement of the formation of the new circuit. In
addition to the tangible benefit of gaining better sched
ule possibilities through the addition of the Indians,
the Big Four gains greatly in respectability.
The four original members all were rocked with
heavy penalties and probations by the old Pacific
Coast Conference and the NCAA several years ago
as a result of recruiting irregularities. It was these
schools' anger at the penalties which led to the break
up of the PCC, which passed from existence June 30.
Consequently, when the four laid plans for their new
league, many observers wondered if it were merely a
haven for recruiting violators, or whether the four
were seriously interested in operating honestly under
a reasonable code.

Schools in other sections of the country looked to
Stanford for the verdict on the Big Four. If Stanford
joined, they reasoned, the new league must be on the
up-and-up. If the Indians stayed out, there must be at
least indications that all was not well.
Stanford, of course, was caught in the middle. Be
cause of its position taken during the PCC scandals,
the Indians were certainly not the best of friends with
the Big Four. From the outset, however, the Big Four
wooed Stanford—to both gain respectability and help
bring the league up to a better size.
Geography and traditional rivalries have dictated
that Stanford join. While football schedules are firm
for the next five years and include yearly games with
all of the four, scheduling in other sports would suffer
to some extent without a league structure and would
be drastically hit if the Big Four decided to quit sched
uling Stanford.
But again—holding Stanford from an immediate de
cision to join was the desire to feel assured that the
new organization was not merely a cover-up for shady
recruiting. Further, Stanford wished to be assured
that enforcement of recruiting rules was in the hands
of the president of each institution, not merely faculty
representatives.
Stanford weighed these and other factors, including
future Rose Bowl revenues, for many months before
making its decision. Many expected the announcement

to come by July 1, the charter date for the AAWU.
When it didn't come then, it appeared that Stanford
would observe the new league in operation for at least
a year. Though Stanford missed the charter deadline
by more than two weeks, it has now been revealed that
it had told the Big Four of its intention to join and has
thus been accorded the status of charter member.
