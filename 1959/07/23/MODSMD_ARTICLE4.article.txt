# Rickey's Dinner-Dance Will Be Social Feature
## Afternoon Swim Extra Attraction At Gathering 
### 
Mid-summer quarter's social
highlight is expected to draw a
capacity crowd of more than 200
to Rickey's Studio Inn Saturday
for nine hours of swimming, din
ing and dancing.
Ticket chairman Austen Lauw-
Zecha reportpd yesterday that
some tickets still remained, but
that prospective purchasers
should quickly secure them to
avoid disappointment.
The affair, to feature swim
ming in Rickey's pool from 4 until
8, dinner from 8 until 9, and danc
ing from 9 until 1 a.m., is priced
at $3 per personâ€”a cost only 15
cents higher than the price of the
dinner alone.
Dancing Tickets
In addition, tickets at $1 per
person for those who wish to take
advantage of only the dancing are
on sale.
Large dressing rooms have
been arranged to accomodate
swimmers, in order that they not
be forced to return to campus to
change for the dinner and danc
ing.
Dinner will feature a buffet
chicken-a-la king. The dance band,
originally announced as three
piece, has been upped to five
pieces.
Tickets will remain on sale at
engineering corner in mornings,
the cellar in afternoons and in
dormitories until the supply is
exhausted.
