Stanford's summer group of intensive Russian
students aren't just learning to speak the lan
guageâ€”they're (lancing it, too. Here, in the Sve
teet Mesyetz, the group shows a typical one of
the numbers they have been learning in a series
of Friday afternoon dance sessions. Teaching

has been under the direction of Anatol Jaou
kowski of Palo Alto, a native Russian who has
danced with some of the finest of old Russia
ballet troupes. The dancing, done on the front
lawn of Russky Gorodok, has drawn consider
able interest from passers-by.
