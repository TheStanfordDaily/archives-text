## Lag Dance Will Feature South Sea Islands Theme

Students will dance to a theme of "Exotica" Aug. 8 at Adobe Creek
Lodge in the final social event of the summer, the Lagunita Dance.
Chairman Deanna Smith reported early this week that dress will
be cocktail dress semi-formal, and that the affair will follow a South
Seas pattern.
Bids for the dance, which will run from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m., will go

on sale Friday at Lagunita for
Lag women. If extra bids remain
by Monday, they will be placed
on general campus sale. They
will sell for $2.
Dancing will be to the five

Band, which also features a vo
calist. Dancing will be both in
side and out, as a terrace area
adjoins the private room Stan
ford will use.
Private bar facilities will also
be provided for the Stanford
group.
In another social report, this
one concerning an event already
held, Austen Lauw-Zecha termed
the July 25 Rickey's swim-dinner
dance a success. Available tick

joyed swimming in the Rickey's
pool and dinner and dancing in
the Rose Room.
