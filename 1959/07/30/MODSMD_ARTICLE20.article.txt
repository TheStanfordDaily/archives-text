## Congress Still Sits On Project M's Fate 
### 
Whether Congress is going to
give the financial go • ahead to
Stanford's Project M still re
mained an unanswered question
this week. The Joint Congres
sional Committee on Atomic En
ergy said it has delayed giving a
final recommendation on the $105
million linear accelerator in or
der to answer several more ques
tior.s about the installation.
A principal one of those ques
tions was answered Thursday in
Washington when Stanford offi
cials and spokesmen for the Pa
cific Gas and Electric Company
testified that Project M would
not be hampered by any lack of
power.
"Plenty of Power"
Committee members had raised
the question of a sufficiency of
power to operate the accelerator,
but were told that a new 25-mile
long double circuit line reaching
from north of San Jose to south
of Redwood City would "provide
plenty of power capacity."
One Stanford official said that
as far as he knew, the Atomic
Energy Commission, which is
seeking approval of the two-mile
long atom smasher, already had
all the information about power.
The PG&E spokesman added
that his company is ready to
serve the load demands of the ac
celerator "and will be able to do
so without any difficulty."
Needs 30,000 Kilowatts
Professor Edward Ginzton,
Stanford's director of the project,
has estimated an initial power
need of 30,000 kilowatts. The
PG&E would provide 60,000 kilo
watts, which would be stepped
down at a substation yet to be
constructed.
It was reported by PG&E that

even round-the-clock operation of
the accelerator would cause no
power drop in the neighboring
[owns. It was noted, however,
the future expansion of the ac
celerator might necessitate addi
tional power.
If the committee approves the
project, and virtually all testi
mony has been favorable, then it
will be up to the full Congress to
decide its fate. President Eisen
hower has already endorsed the
measure.

long double circuit line reaching
from north of San Jose to south
of Redwood City would "provide
plenty of power capacity."
One Stanford official said that
as far as he knew, the Atomic
Energy Commission, which is
seeking approval of the two-mile
long atom smasher, already had
all the information about power.
The PG&E spokesman added
that his company is ready to
serve the load demands of the ac
celerator "and will be able to do
so without any difficulty."
Needs 30,000 Kilowatts
Professor Edward Ginzton,
Stanford's director of the project,
has estimated an initial power
need of 30,000 kilowatts. The
PG&E would provide 60,000 kilo
watts, which would be stepped
down at a substation yet to be
constructed.
It was reported by PG&E that

even round-the-clock operation of
the accelerator would cause no
power drop in the neighboring
[owns. It was noted, however,
the future expansion of the ac
celerator might necessitate addi
tional power.
If the committee approves the
project, and virtually all testi
mony has been favorable, then it
will be up to the full Congress to
decide its fate. President Eisen
hower has already endorsed the
measure.
Whether Congress is going to
give the financial go • ahead to
Stanford's Project M still re
mained an unanswered question
this week. The Joint Congres
sional Committee on Atomic En
ergy said it has delayed giving a
final recommendation on the $105
million linear accelerator in or
der to answer several more ques
tior.s about the installation.
A principal one of those ques
tions was answered Thursday in
Washington when Stanford offi
cials and spokesmen for the Pa
cific Gas and Electric Company
testified that Project M would
not be hampered by any lack of
power.
"Plenty of Power"
Committee members had raised
the question of a sufficiency of
power to operate the accelerator,
but were told that a new 25-mile
long double circuit line reaching
from north of San Jose to south
of Redwood City would "provide
plenty of power capacity."
One Stanford official said that
as far as he knew, the Atomic
Energy Commission, which is
