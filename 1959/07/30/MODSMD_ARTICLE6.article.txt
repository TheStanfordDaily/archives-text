# Co-ed Football Feature At Second Melon Feed
## 
### 
A midsummer gridiron classic
between Lagunita Court and a va
riety-pack men's team is expected
to highlight activities at the sum
mer's second watermelon feed
Saturday.
The downing of melon and ac
companying tennis, swimming
and volleyball will run from 2 to
5 p.m. at the women's gym field.
Football's funniest hour will

start at 3, when the well-drilled
precision team from Lag meets
the male assortment. Women, un
der the direction of team captain
Miriam "Coo" DeCou and an
anonymous coach have been hard
at work for nearly three weeks
perfecting their attack.
After Last Time
Plans for the female team were
laid at the last melon feed, when
combined teams of men and
women met in an epic two-hour
struggle.
What the men will present re
mains to be seen, in view of the
fact that no practices, or even an
organized team, is in existence.
But, then, there are expected to
be least 11 able-bodied males on
hand with the attraction of the
day's foe.
Taking a lesson from the pre
vious feed, when a half-ton of
melon ran out after less than two
hours, chairman Marilyn Funk
has upped the order to 1200
pounds. She guaranteed that later
delivery would insure its being
ice-cold, and emphasized that it
was all free for the eating.

Men will be allowed to swim in
the women's pool without being
guests of women students. Fac
ulty members and graduates may
also swim, but no children or pets
will be permitted.
Dressing rooms will be provid
ed. but there will be no towel
service, and guests will be respon
sible for valuables.

mer's second watermelon feed
Saturday.
The downing of melon and ac
companying tennis, swimming
and volleyball will run from 2 to
5 p.m. at the women's gym field.
Football's funniest hour will

start at 3, when the well-drilled
precision team from Lag meets
the male assortment. Women, un
der the direction of team captain
Miriam "Coo" DeCou and an
anonymous coach have been hard
at work for nearly three weeks
perfecting their attack.
After Last Time
Plans for the female team were
laid at the last melon feed, when
combined teams of men and
women met in an epic two-hour
struggle.
What the men will present re
mains to be seen, in view of the
fact that no practices, or even an
organized team, is in existence.
But, then, there are expected to
be least 11 able-bodied males on
hand with the attraction of the
day's foe.
Taking a lesson from the pre
vious feed, when a half-ton of
melon ran out after less than two
hours, chairman Marilyn Funk
has upped the order to 1200
pounds. She guaranteed that later
delivery would insure its being
ice-cold, and emphasized that it
was all free for the eating.

Men will be allowed to swim in
the women's pool without being
guests of women students. Fac
ulty members and graduates may
also swim, but no children or pets
will be permitted.
Dressing rooms will be provid
ed. but there will be no towel
service, and guests will be respon
sible for valuables.
