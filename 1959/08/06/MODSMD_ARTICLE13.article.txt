# Dr. Russell Varian Succumbs; Invented Klystron Tube Here
## 
### 
Dr. Russell H. Varian, research
associate at Stanford and inven
tor of the klystron tube, died of
a heart attack July 28 while va
cationing near Juneau, Alaska
The klystron, invented in 3938,
became one of the basic building
blocks of radar, developed during
World War 11.
Dr. Varian received his A.B.
and master's degrees at Stanford
in 1925 and 1927 respectively. He
was named a research associate

in 1937 and held that post until
the time of his death.
He helped to found the firm of
Varian Associates in 1948. At the
time of his death, he was chair
ma of the board. Varian Asso
ciates, located in Stanford's In
dustrial Park, makes geophysical
apparatus, klystron tubes, re
cording instruments and many
other types of electronic equip
ment.
The klystron tube was devel
oped in an effort to solve several
problems that concerned the Var
ian brothers. At the time, there
was no way for airplanes to de
tect runways in bad weather, and
there was no reliable method for
detecting the approach of enemy
planes. The development of the
klystron made radar possible.
Dr. Varian held more than 100
patents in microwave electronics
and applied physics, and has
received many awards for his
work.
