# Durand Talks Attract Top Space Experts
## 
### 
Some of the world's foremost
experts in aviation and space ve
hicle problems are meeting at
Stanford this week at a confer
ence honoring one of America's
aviation pioneers.
The Durand Centennial Confer
ence on Aeronautics and Astro
nautics is commemorating the
100 th anniversary of the birth of
William Frederick Durand. An
emeritus professor who died last
year at the age of 99. Durand
started aeronautical engineering
at Stanford by evolving the basic
theories for aircraft propeller de
sign. He was known for almost a
generation as "the dean of Ameri
can engineering."
Dr. Hugh L. Dryden and Sir
Geoffrey Taylor headline the ros
ter of speakers which have or will
present talks to the sessions. Dr.
Dryden is former director of re
search for the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics, and
is internationally known for his
research on airflow in the bound
ary layer.
Sir Geoffrey, of Cambridge Uni
versity, was an originator of the
"dislocation theory"â€”one of to
day's most important research
tools.
Dr. Theodore von Ivarman,
probably the world's best known
aeronautical scientist, is hero to
dedicate a laboratory in Durand's
name. Dr. von Karman is chair
man of the NATO Advisory
Group for Aeronautical Research
and Development, with headquar
ters in Paris.
Other noted scientists from
Germany, Italy, France, Sweden,
Canada, and from various U.S.
research centers are among the
approximately 500 in attendance.
The meetings are sponsored by
the Air Force Office of Scientific
Research, the Office of Naval Re
search, the Office of Ordnance Re
search, and the National Science
Foundation.
