# Law Library Will Receive Financial Push
## 
### 
A movement has been started
by Federal Judge Louis E. Good
man of San Francisco to estab
lish the Stanford Law School li
brary in the front rank of Ameri
can law libraries, it was an
nounced late last week.
Judge Goodman is chairman of
the newly formed "Friends of the
Stanford Law Library."
Charter members agreed there
is a need for a great law library in
the San Francisco metropolitan
area to meet the demands of to
day's highly sophisticated do
mestic and international practice.
Therefore, they reasoned, Stan
ford's good, 100,000 volume law
library should have the increased
financial support that would bring
it to the standards set by the
great law libraries of the United
States- the Law Library of Con
gress, the Los Angeles County
Law Library, and those of Har
vard, Yale, Columbia, and Michi
gan universities.
Professor John Henry Merry
man, Stanford law librarian and
secretary to the committee, said
it hopes to provide $25,000 a year
through dues from members of
the Friends. The University will
continue to carry normal acquisi
tion and overhead costs, he said.
Patrons agree to support the li
brary with $1000 annually for five
years; sustaining members pay
$250 annually; supporting mem
bers, $100; and members, $25.
