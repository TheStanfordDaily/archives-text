# Radio Telescope Confirms Presence of Sun 'Hot Spots'
## 
### 
"Radiohcliograms" from Stan
ford's new radio telescope have
confirmed the presence of "hot
spots" at the sun's surface.
These visual representations of
microwave radiation from the
sun's chromosphere showed sev
eral such hot spots on May 3, it
was announced yesterday by Pro
fessor Ronald N. Bracewell, de
signer and builder of the tele
scope.
"They also showed the presence
of a brilliant equatorial belt of
radiation in addition to the hot
spots," he said. "One of these hot
spots is probably located above a
sunspot group on the sun's in
visible hemisphere."
lie pointed out that the radia

tion is in the 3,000 megacycle
range, which emanates from the
chromosphere. Visual observa
tions of the chromosphere, or
fiery surface layer of the sun,
show it billowing to heights of
6,000 miles. The radiation pattern,
however, appears to extend as
high as 20,000 miles.
The radio telescope's perform
ance is up to expectations, he said.
It has the highest resolving power
(focal clarity) of any U.S. radio
telescope, and it scans the sun
with a pencil-like beam only
1 15th of a degree in diameter.
The installation consists of 32
aluminum "dish" antennas ar
ranged in two bisecting rows of
16 each. Dishes are 25 feet apart,
and the rows are 375 feet long.
Each dish is 10 feet in diameter,
mounted on a concrete pedestal.
They are interconnected me
chanically and electronically, as
well as being synchronized for
scanning the sun as it passes
through the sky.
The unusual cross design of the
multiple-dish antenna gives the
Stanford radio telescope a resolu
tion equal to that of a single,
steerable dish antenna 400 feet in
diameter, Dr. Bracewell said.
Stanford's radio telescope was
built for approximately $500,000
with support from the Air Force
Officc of Scientific Research.
It was planned for high-resolu
tion studies of the radio sun, Dr.
Bracewell said, but it can also be
u-sed to observe radio stars and
the moon. The life cycles of solar
hot spots and their relation to the
earth's ionospheric weather will
also be investigated.
