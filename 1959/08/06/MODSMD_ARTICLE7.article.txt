# Radio Telescope Confirms Presence of Sun 'Hot Spots'
## 
### 
"Radiohcliograms" from Stan
ford's new radio telescope have
confirmed the presence of "hot
spots" at the sun's surface.
These visual representations of
microwave radiation from the
sun's chromosphere showed sev
eral such hot spots on May 3, it
was announced yesterday by Pro
fessor Ronald N. Bracewell, de
signer and builder of the tele
scope.
"They also showed the presence
of a brilliant equatorial belt of
radiation in addition to the hot
spots," he said. "One of these hot
spots is probably located above a
sunspot group on the sun's in
visible hemisphere."
lie pointed out that the radia

tion is in the 3,000 megacycle
range, which emanates from the
chromosphere. Visual observa
tions of the chromosphere, or
fiery surface layer of the sun,
show it billowing to heights of
6,000 miles. The radiation pattern,
however, appears to extend as
high as 20,000 miles.
The radio telescope's perform
ance is up to expectations, he said.
It has the highest resolving power
(focal clarity) of any U.S. radio
telescope, and it scans the sun
with a pencil-like beam only
1 15th of a degree in diameter.
The installation consists of 32
aluminum "dish" antennas ar
