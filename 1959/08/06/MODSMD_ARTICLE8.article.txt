# Big Antenna To Stand 15 Stories High
## 
### 
A dish antenna as tall as a 15-
story building will soon appear on
the Stanford campus.
It will be a "radar telescope"
with a parabolic reflector 142 feet
in diameter. When completed in
about a year, the big dish will be
America's largest and the world's
second largest.
A 20-60 megacycle radio trans
mitter—the most powerful ever
built in this frequency range and
requiring a million-watt power
supply—will be installed near the
dish, making the combined instal
lation a now and sensitive tool for
space research.
The project was announced
Tuesday by scientists of Stanford
and the Stanford Research In
stitute. It will be a joint under
taking by SRl's Communication
and Propagation Laboratory and
the University's Radio Propaga
tion Laboratory, with support
from the Air Force Cambridge
Research Center.
In Back Hills
The big dish will be located atop
the ridge of hills at the back of
the educational campus, plainly
visible to the surrounding area.
Because of the importance of this
research and its value in teaching,
Stanford's trustees elected to
make an exception to their policy
requiring that all structures on
the Stanford foothills be unob
trusive.
Usually radio telescopes are
equipped only to receive naturally
occurring electromagnetic radia
tion from the cosmos. But with
the high-powered transmitter it
will be possible to bounce signals
against heavenly bodies, as was
recently done with the planet
Venus.
This technique is becoming in
creasingly important in studies of
the solar system, and the Stanford
group will attempt to obtain radar
echoes from Mars and from the
sun itself. The radar-echo method
is called "radar astronomy" to
distinguish it from "radio as
tronomy," which does not involve
reflection of man-made signals.
The University group installing
the transmitter will be headed by
Professor Von R. Eshleman and
his as-sociate, Philip B. Gallagher.
Design Under SRI
Design and construction of the
antenna will be carried out by
SRI under the direction of Pro
fessor Allen M. Peterson, who di
vides his time between Stanford
and SRI. Ray L. Leadabrand and
W. Ray Vincent of SRI will be Dr.
Peterson's associates in the an
tenna construction.
Cost of the 142-foot dish is esti
mated at about $250,000. Special
use of welded structural members
and aluminum fabrication meth
ods will cut some costs 90% in
comparison with other big dishes.
The antenna is designed for use
at frequencies between 20 and
2000 megacycles.
The transmitter is valued at
more than a million dollars. The
total investment will be around
$1,500,000, it is estimated.
