these two beds out of the way,
only 432 remain to be made be
fore the hospital is ready for
patients. The two-patient room

character of the rooms, consid
ered the most modern design
for hospitals. Pastel furnish
ings are in each room, which
is also equipped with a "high

ceiver and microphone on the
wall, and bedside telephones for
each patient.
