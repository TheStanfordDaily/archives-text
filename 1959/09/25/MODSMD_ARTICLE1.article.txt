# Special Freshman Issue
## CONVOCATION Cordial Welcome For Class of '63 
### Steve Baffrey, Associate Editor 
"We think you have particular talents and attributes of character
which combine to make a potential of leadership. We think further
(hat as this potential becomes actual you will derive great grati!ca
tion from the service it will enable you to perform for society at
large."
With these words University President Wallace Sterling bid a

"cordial welcome" to Stanford's
Class of '63 in Freshman Convo
cation ceremonies in Frost Am
phitheater Wednesday night.
Sterling 1 Confident
"That we have confidence in
you," the President told the class, .
"is evident in the fact 1 hat you
are here."
Sterling stressed that in this
era of much public concern over J
higher education — stretching
from tightening admissions poli
cies to doubt of quality and em
phasis—a student must do more
than "simply take for granted
the opportunity and privilege of
going to college."
Value of College lOxperienee
Instead, he said, special value
should be placed upon the expe
rience.
Asking that the Stanford fac
ulty be given "an opportunity to
help" the class establish good rec
ords, Sterling commented on the j
faculty's intent to have its inter-j
est cultivated in the educational
development of each student.
Commenting on Stanford his
tory, Sterling told the Class of
'G3 that, though young as uni
versities go, Stanford had at
tained a world stature of which
her alumnae could be proud. The
hopes that Governor and Mrs. i
Stanford held in their son were
transferred to the University, he
said.
Mrs. Stanford's Trust
"Each of us bears some respon- i
sibility for honoring and perpetu
ating the trust they established." j
Sterling outlined the ways one
could get in and out oJ the Uni- '
versity, emphasizing that cn
tranee comes only as the result
of meeting competitive competi
tion.
In a humorous vein he enum
erated the "several ways to get
out"- graduation, "bad luck" of
a health or financial nature,
"systematic and deliberate loaf
ing," and "discipline."
"All of us now become part-1
ners," he said, "in a mutual edu- i
cational enterprise at a time when
American education is working
to find ways by which to improve
itself and so render greater serv
ice to the nation."
