WASHINGTON (AP)â€”The Air
Force may attempt early Friday
to intercept the paddlewheel sat
ellite Explorer VI with a ballistic
missile launched from a high
flying jet bomber.
The IBM Vanguard center,
which tracks satellites, said the
newest satellite would be almost
directly over Jacksonville, Fla.,
at that hour.
The reports were that the wea
pon to be used was the last of
nine Martin Co. rockets in an
experimental ballistic missile se
ries.
