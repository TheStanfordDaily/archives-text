# Frosh Only At Jolly-Up
## 
### 
With the confident statement
that: "every precaution has been
taken to prevent eager sophomore
men from crashing the gates,"
Jolly-Up Co-Chairman Molly Mer
rill told the Daily that she expects
more than 1400 freshmen and
women to attend the Jolly-Up
Saturday evening in the girls
gym.
Freshman men must have a
Wilbur Hall meal ticket, a pre
reg card and a jolly-up ticket
while the women need only a
ticket.
Once safely inside the freshmen
will have their choice of square
oi' ballroom dancing or of listen
ing to the Stanford-Wiseon-siii
game on audio tape.
As in past years Spike Lynch
and his band will play for the
ballroom dancing with the Men's
Glee Club under the direction of
Woody Howse providing inter
mission entertainment.
The Daily's conversation with
Miss Merrill ended with the ad
monishment, "not to give anyone
any ideas about climbing over the
girls gym walls."
