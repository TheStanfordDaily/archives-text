# Look for Yourself

I)j ar Fresh men,
Welcome home—to your new home, that is.
Thirteen hundred twenty-five of you have joined us here at
Stanford for a four-year experience that inaj do more to shape
your future than ativ other undertaking.
Some of you may have been planning your Stanford career ever
since junior high. And others may have decided to come only in
the past several months.
lint regardless of this, every one of you has undoubtedly been
deluged with scores of opinions, facts, and fantasies about what
Stanford is like.
In the short two davs vonVe been here, some of the things
vou've heard mav alreadv have been confirmed or exploded. Yes—
it's true that Cellar coffee has a flavor all its own. Butnnito —it isn t
reall\ true that '"Nine out of ten girls are beautiful and the tenth
one goes to Stanford.""
On top of all the things you heard before coming here has been
poured a new torrent of ad\ ice and opinions. I his max help some:
il may just further confuse others.
Kven while writing this, a freshman came iu and said bed
gotten so main do's and don'ts in two days he didii t know which
way was up.
To add more advice might seem contradictor) at this point, but
like everyone else who's talked to you this week, we can I resist the
opportunity.
\\ e believe vou should not be dependent upon the preconceived
notions vou have of Stanford. Rather than flails accepting what
others have found, we hope \<>u will take vour entire four years
to do vour own searching out of w hat Stanford has to oiler.
What one person might find valuable mav be worthless to an
other. <)iiI\ bv looking yourself and bv exploring the mam facets
of this University can you derive the greatest benefit from your
time here.
Bear in mind that others can't do vour work for you while
\ on" re here-not if \oii are to benefit from this work. Neither]
should vou allow others to form for you the opinions of what Stan
ford i.sand isn't—what il can do for y :>ll and what it can t.
We hope you'll enjoy il here that you'll have serious times
and fun limes. And we hope vou can contribute to Stanford as J
Stanford will surelv contribute to vou.
Sincere! \ yours,
The Duly j
