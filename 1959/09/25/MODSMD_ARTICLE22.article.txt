# Drive Leaders to Seek Funds From All Alumni
## 
### 
During 1959-60, Stanford Uni
versity will seek $1,000,000 from
alumni, volunteer drive leaders
announced today. Fifty-eight
chairmen of graduating classes
will appeal to each of their class
mates in an effort to reach every
alumnus.
The new program, an attempt
to broaden general financial sup
port, replaces the former general
appeal to the alumni. A previous

trial of the new program on 10
selected classes during 1957 and
1958 resulted in a trebling of don
ors and a doubling of funds. In
four of the selected classes, more
than 30 per cent of the member
ship responded, setting a new
record.
Warner YV. Henry, general
chairman of the new program,
commented, "Alumni support is
vital to the University, especially
when it is realized that of the
nearly $610,000 given in 1958-59
for unrestricted current use,
$395,000 or more than 65 per cent,
came from alumni and parents of
Stanford students."
Three new leaders named for
the 1959 drive are Frank Hay
ward, Chalmers Graham and
Obert Tanner. Hayward will
head the Business School, Gra
ham the Law School, and Tanner
the Graduate School funds.
