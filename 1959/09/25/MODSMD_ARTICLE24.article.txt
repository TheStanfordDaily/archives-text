# Frosh Impressions

"What would I like to see at
Stanford right now? My trunk!"
laughed Harriet Hailparm, Bran
ner freshman, while standing in
the long hot line for postal boxes.
"All I have with me are wool
dresses and high heeled shoes!"
Roommates Shari Coburn and
Susie Goodvillie chorused, "The
huge closets and the tall girls!"
when asked what had surprised
them the most during the first
morning.
And what about the parents of
freshmen, those individuals who
spend the first day acting as taxi
drivers and baggage carriers?
"Today is really a special day
for me—it's the first time I've
been allowed above the first floor
in a women's dorm!" laughed
William McCreary, a Stanford
alumnus whose daughter Genie
is a Roble freshman.
Mrs. Jaline Twaddell, whose
daughter Ellen is in Branner, said
her daughter had "brought every
thing."
"I'm sure I could take half her
things home and she wouldn't
even miss them!"
The typical sponsor's attitude
was expressed by Judy Pinson of
Braner: "It's been like waiting
for D Day, H Hour around here!
We've been here since Sunday at
tending meetings and more meet
ings, and the tense atmosphere
has been terrible! We're so re
lieved that the freshmen are here
at last!"
"I'm looking forward to meeting
my roommate," was the thing
that Phil Bodin of Fort Worth,
Texas, had to say about Stanford.
"And I'll .sure be glad when ori
entation is over and I can get
settled," he continued.
"I'm dreading classes more than
anything else," said John Becker
of Altadena. "And I'm glad that
pre-reg is all planned for us. I'd
like to have more free time, but
I wouldn't know what to do with
it."
Barbara Jean Donati of San
Inez, expressed the most typical
freshman attitude: "I'm looking
forward to everything," she said.

Bill Noill of Clovis, New Mex
ico, thinks that California is
crowded. "But the campus sure
has plenty of room. And it's a
lot nicer than I expected," he said.
"I don't think it's really hit
most of us—how lucky we are to
ho living on the row," said Karen
Doran in response to a question
oil how she liked living in Man
zanita as one of the 20 freshman
women in the newly renovated
residence.
Amoretta Mathews and Carole
St. John noted that the men in
the area had been very friendly
and helpful. Sponsor Nan Baker
added that the Alpha Sigs and the
DU's were furnishing rides to
Branner, where Manzanita women
get their meals.
