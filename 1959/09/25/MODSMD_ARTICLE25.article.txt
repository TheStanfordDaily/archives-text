# Cyclotron To St. Louis Univ.
## 
### 
One of the first cyclotrons ever
built, an 18-year-old one that fig
ured in studies leading to the A
bomb, has been given by Stanford
to St. Louis University. It will
be used to begin accelerator re
search and expand the program
in nuclear physics.'
Stanford will replace the cyclo
tron with a 3-MFV (million elec
tron volt) Von do Graaff accelera
tor. The new machine will be
financed by a $180,000 grant from
the National Science Foundation.
It will be used to continue stud
ies of nuclear structure.
