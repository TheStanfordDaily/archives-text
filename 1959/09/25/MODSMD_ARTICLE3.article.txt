Then join The Daily and see
the world â€”as it conies over a
teletype machine.
The Daily has openings for
newcomers in all phases of
news, feature and sports writ

credit.
Drop in to the shack any time,
but be sure to circle next Tues

when The Daily will hold spe
cial open 'house for prospective
staffers.
