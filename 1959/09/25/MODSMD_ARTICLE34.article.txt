# A Phi O Helps New Students
## 
### 
Among the upperclassmen
wandering around campus this
week were 30 harried men carry
ing luggage, providing transpor
tation from trains and for fresh
man women in Manzanita, keep
ing lines moving at the freshman
placement tests and generally be
ing helpful.
These men are members of
Alpha Phi Omega, Stanford's
service fraternity, best known for
its quarterly book exchange.
The book exchange, located in
a temporary building behind
Cubberley and parallel to the Civ
Library, will accept books Mon
day through Wednesday, but will
not accept any books Thursday.
During the regular hours, 9
a.m. 1o noon and 1 to 4 p.m., stu
dents may bring books, especially
those books for freshman and
General Studies courses, to the
book exchange. A Phi O mem
bers sell the books for a 10-cent
service charge, and former own
ers may pick up checks for their
books about two weeks later.
In addition to the book ex
hange, A Phi O members help
during Pre-Reg, provide scout
masters and Courts of Honor for
the Boy Scout troop at the Con
Home and usher at campus mu
sical presentations.
