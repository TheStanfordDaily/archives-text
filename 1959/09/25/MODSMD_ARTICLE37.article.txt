## Khrushchev Says End of Arms Race Would Not Disrupt U.S. Economy 
### Associated Press 
For a C o m m u n i s 1, Nikita
Khrushchev has done consider
able heretical talking recently,
and never more so than when he
admits to a belief that the United
States economy would not be (lis- i
rupted by an end of military pro
duction.
One of- the most diligently
pushed Communist lines has been
that the Western prosperity is
based on such production.
The theory was bolstered by the
fact that the great American de
pression of i he 1930s never really
ended until war orders began
coming from Britain and France
in 1939.
Depression Expected
After World War II Soviet for-'
eign policy depended heavily upon .
the theory that, once the consumer j
demand was met to compensate
for the period of restriction, the |
West-would suffer another great
depression opening the way for
Communist takeover in the result
ing political crisis.
Adlai Stevenson, after talking
to the Premier on this trip and
comparing his attitudes with those
displayed in previous contacts be
tween them, thinks education re
garding things Western is pro
ducing some promise of Soviet
international cooperation.

It's all right to say that the I
Communists cannot be trusted, for i
that is still true. But when
Khrushchev reiterates that they
are ready to go into the matter of
step by step arms controls, it can
not be brushed off entirely.
Strangely enough, the Kremlin
never gave its own theory a real
chance to prove out. By its display !
of aggressive tendencies, it caused j
the West to remobilize after the'
first drastic military cutbacks.;
This will go down as one of his
tory's great: political contradic- I
t ions.
Military Waste
Since those days American
thinking and American action !
have concentrated on defense as !
never bpfore. The resultant waste |
—for production of military ma
terials which are not used is sheer
waste —is burning up natural re
sources and national energy to a
point where it has become a real
threat to the economic future.
From Khrushchev's standpoint,
it would be nice if the West could
be forced to continue this if the
Soviet Union could escape it.
Since it cannot, the theory is
growing that he is really sincere
about disarmament proposals in
recognition that Soviet peoples
will not much longer be willing
to endure austerity merely for the
sake of the Soviet future.

Through Ihe years of anxiety
the world has been constantly bol
stered by the 1 belief that some
lime, somehow, the Communists
would learn that its bread is but
tered on the side of international
cooperation.
