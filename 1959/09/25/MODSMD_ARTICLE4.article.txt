# Alias-Able Moon Rocket Burns on Pad
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL. Fla. (A>)—
A towering Atlas-Able moon rock
et exploded during an engine test
Thursday, postponing a U.S. ef
fort to even the moon score with
the Russians and prompting a
study of other space probes
planned this fall.
The Atlas-Able was the third
U.S. space vehicle to fail during
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrush
chev's visit to this country.
The 100-foot rocket, scheduled
to carry a 375-pound satellite to
a moon orbit early next month,
was destroyed when tons of ex
ploding fuel ripped through the
first two of its four stages.
The small third and fourth
stages were not on the missile.
The Air Forcc announced the
explosion occurred during a static
test of the missile and that it is
investigating the cause. A static
firing checks all operating func
tions of the engines, including
ignition, while the rocket is locked
on its pad.
The United States was count
ing on the Atlas-Able to better the
spectacular Soviet moon strike of
Sept. 13.
Tt was scheduled for launching
during the period of Oct. 3-6,
when the moon will be at its clos
est point to the earth, about 221.-
000 miles.
A spokesman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration said in Washington that
it's unlikely another rocket can
be readied in time for an October
launch.
NASA announced that as a re
suit of the blowup, it will make
a complete study of space probes
tentatively set-for this fall. This
would include an attempt to send
a probe toward Venus in Novem
ber.
Earlier, a NASA spokesman
said the entire American space
program would come under scru
tiny. tin! this was later toned
down to include only the fall
la unchings.
