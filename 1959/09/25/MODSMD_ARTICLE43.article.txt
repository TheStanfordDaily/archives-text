# Profs Plan Math Course For Elementary Schools
## 
### 
Three thousand second and third graders on ihe Peninsula will
get their first taste of higher mathematics this fall.
An experimental course in plane geometry given last year at Stan
ford and Portola Valley Elementary Schools has proved so success
ful that five neighboring school districts and one private school
will teach it next year.

The participating school dis
tricts are Mountain View, Ra
venswood, Portola Valley and :
Burlingame. In addition. Stan
ford Elementary and Ohlones j
schools of the Palo Alto District
and Peninsula School in Mcnlo
Park will be part of the program. ;
Ninety-one elementary school
classes will be involved.
Professor's Idea
The program is the work of
two Stanford professorsâ€”Asso
ciate Dean Patrick Suppes of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences and Newton S. Hawley, as
sociate professor of mathematics.
The whole idea started when
Hawley and Suppes talked about
geometry to the first graders at
Stanford Elementary in the spring ,
of 1958.
The six and seven-year olds
were captivated by the concept. !
and the single lecture worked into
daily sessions of almost half an
hour. At the end of the two
month experiment, the pupils
were able to bisect line segments,
bisect angles, construct an equi
lateral triangle and find the cen
ter of a circle.
1 Science Grant
The program is supported by a
$61,680 grant from the National

Science Foundation. Professors
Hawley and Suppes feel that the
experiment thus far strongly sup
ports the conclusion that the
mathematical content of the ele
mentary school curriculum can
he increased considerably. Both
professors will develop further
material during the coming year.
