# Indians Travel to Wisconsin To Clash with Giant Badgers
## 
### John Schwarz, Sports Editor 
Stanford Coach Jack Curtice and his young Indian football squad
can look for plenty of trouble torrforrow when Stanford takes on one
ol the- nation's most powerful teams, the Wisconsin Badgers, in
Madison, Wisconsin.
Tlje Badgers are equipped with an elephant line, one of the biggest

in college football, and an All-
American quarterback in Dale
J iackbart.
A Lot of Beef
The Wisconsin line, which aver
ages 222 pounds, consists of seven
lettermeii with 234-pound center
Bob Nelson being the biggest of
the big. Just to insure himself
against injury, Wisconsin Coach
Milt Bruhn has a second string
line which weighs in at a mere
215 average.
Perhaps even more formidable
in the Wisconsin limelight is sen
ior quarterback Dale Hackbart.
Hackbart, who made several Ail-
American teams in his junior
year, is one of the most versatile
Lacks in the country.
Hackbart has proved himself
one of the best running quarter
backs around by piling up 710
yards#on the ground in two sea
sons and averaging 4 yards per
cany. On top of this Hackbart
lias thrown for XO2 yards in those
two seasons.
Good Defense Too
Quarterback Hackbart has had
the pro scouts excited the last
two seasons by not only excelling
in .offensive skills but also turn-

ing in an outstanding defensive
job Hackbarl led the Big Ten
last year in pass interceptions
with seven. On top ol this he ran
back seven punts for 193 yards
ranking him near the top in the
nation.
In an effort to counter the
many assets of Mr. Hackbart and
his Wisconsin team mates, Coach
Curtice hopes to employ enough
versatility in his own attack to
keep the Stanford offense mov
iiig.
Quarterback Dick Norman will
naturally get a chance to limber
up his pitching arm, but the run
rung attack featuring fullbacks
Skip Face and Rick McMillen
along witli halfback Mac VVylie
will have to show the same effec
tiveness of last week if the In
dians hope to successfully pene
trate the Wisconsin defenses.
Hinshaw Out
As an added hindrance to Stan
ford's hopes, the Cards found out
this week that ace tackle Dean
Hinshaw is probably through for
the season clue to a knee injury
suffered in the Oregon game.
First string guard Ron Fernana
des and defensive end Rich Hear
ney also appear to be out for at
least the Wisconsin battle.
With 6-6 Hinshaw out for the
season the pressure will fall on
reserve tackle Gary Pike. Pike is
not an inexperienced lineman
having won his letter last year.
The 222-pound senior could turn
out to be a real tough replace
ment.

Taking over- for the injured
Fernandes will be sophomore
guard Tom Walsh. Walsh, a 205
pounder from Portland, Oregon,
showed a lot of poise for a'rookie
in last week's Oregon game.
With Walsh replacing Fernan
des and Pike in the lineup for
Hinshaw, the Stanford line's aver
se weight took a dip from 211
pounds to 209, 13 pounds less
ihan Wisconsin.

ALL AMERICAN DALE HACKBART
Dale most versatile back in nation
Stanford Coach Jack Curtice and his young Indian football squad
can look for plenty of trouble torrforrow when Stanford takes on one
ol the- nation's most powerful teams, the Wisconsin Badgers, in
Madison, Wisconsin.
Tlje Badgers are equipped with an elephant line, one of the biggest

in college football, and an All-
American quarterback in Dale
J iackbart.
A Lot of Beef
The Wisconsin line, which aver
ages 222 pounds, consists of seven
lettermeii with 234-pound center
Bob Nelson being the biggest of
the big. Just to insure himself
against injury, Wisconsin Coach
Milt Bruhn has a second string
line which weighs in at a mere
215 average.
Perhaps even more formidable
in the Wisconsin limelight is sen
ior quarterback Dale Hackbart.
Hackbart, who made several Ail-
American teams in his junior
year, is one of the most versatile
Lacks in the country.
Hackbart has proved himself
one of the best running quarter
backs around by piling up 710
yards#on the ground in two sea
sons and averaging 4 yards per
cany. On top of this Hackbart
lias thrown for XO2 yards in those
two seasons.
Good Defense Too
Quarterback Hackbart has had
the pro scouts excited the last
two seasons by not only excelling
in .offensive skills but also turn-

ing in an outstanding defensive
job Hackbarl led the Big Ten
last year in pass interceptions
with seven. On top ol this he ran
back seven punts for 193 yards
ranking him near the top in the
nation.
In an effort to counter the
many assets of Mr. Hackbart and
his Wisconsin team mates, Coach
Curtice hopes to employ enough
versatility in his own attack to
keep the Stanford offense mov
iiig.
Quarterback Dick Norman will
naturally get a chance to limber
up his pitching arm, but the run
rung attack featuring fullbacks
Skip Face and Rick McMillen
along witli halfback Mac VVylie
will have to show the same effec
tiveness of last week if the In
dians hope to successfully pene
trate the Wisconsin defenses.
Hinshaw Out
As an added hindrance to Stan
ford's hopes, the Cards found out
this week that ace tackle Dean
Hinshaw is probably through for
the season clue to a knee injury
suffered in the Oregon game.
First string guard Ron Fernana
des and defensive end Rich Hear
ney also appear to be out for at
least the Wisconsin battle.
With 6-6 Hinshaw out for the
season the pressure will fall on
reserve tackle Gary Pike. Pike is
not an inexperienced lineman
having won his letter last year.
The 222-pound senior could turn
out to be a real tough replace
ment.

Taking over- for the injured
Fernandes will be sophomore
guard Tom Walsh. Walsh, a 205
pounder from Portland, Oregon,
showed a lot of poise for a'rookie
in last week's Oregon game.
With Walsh replacing Fernan
des and Pike in the lineup for
Hinshaw, the Stanford line's aver
se weight took a dip from 211
pounds to 209, 13 pounds less
ihan Wisconsin.

ALL AMERICAN DALE HACKBART
Dale most versatile back in nation
Stanford Coach Jack Curtice and his young Indian football squad
can look for plenty of trouble torrforrow when Stanford takes on one
ol the- nation's most powerful teams, the Wisconsin Badgers, in
Madison, Wisconsin.
Tlje Badgers are equipped with an elephant line, one of the biggest

in college football, and an All-
American quarterback in Dale
J iackbart.
A Lot of Beef
The Wisconsin line, which aver
ages 222 pounds, consists of seven
lettermeii with 234-pound center
Bob Nelson being the biggest of
the big. Just to insure himself
against injury, Wisconsin Coach
Milt Bruhn has a second string
line which weighs in at a mere
215 average.
Perhaps even more formidable
in the Wisconsin limelight is sen
ior quarterback Dale Hackbart.
Hackbart, who made several Ail-
American teams in his junior
year, is one of the most versatile
Lacks in the country.
Hackbart has proved himself
one of the best running quarter
backs around by piling up 710
yards#on the ground in two sea
sons and averaging 4 yards per
cany. On top of this Hackbart
lias thrown for XO2 yards in those
two seasons.
Good Defense Too
Quarterback Hackbart has had
the pro scouts excited the last
two seasons by not only excelling
in .offensive skills but also turn-

ing in an outstanding defensive
job Hackbarl led the Big Ten
last year in pass interceptions
with seven. On top ol this he ran
back seven punts for 193 yards
ranking him near the top in the
nation.
In an effort to counter the
many assets of Mr. Hackbart and
his Wisconsin team mates, Coach
Curtice hopes to employ enough
versatility in his own attack to
keep the Stanford offense mov
iiig.
Quarterback Dick Norman will
naturally get a chance to limber
up his pitching arm, but the run
rung attack featuring fullbacks
Skip Face and Rick McMillen
along witli halfback Mac VVylie
will have to show the same effec
tiveness of last week if the In
dians hope to successfully pene
trate the Wisconsin defenses.
Hinshaw Out
As an added hindrance to Stan
ford's hopes, the Cards found out
this week that ace tackle Dean
Hinshaw is probably through for
the season clue to a knee injury
suffered in the Oregon game.
First string guard Ron Fernana
des and defensive end Rich Hear
ney also appear to be out for at
least the Wisconsin battle.
With 6-6 Hinshaw out for the
season the pressure will fall on
reserve tackle Gary Pike. Pike is
not an inexperienced lineman
having won his letter last year.
The 222-pound senior could turn
out to be a real tough replace
ment.

Taking over- for the injured
Fernandes will be sophomore
guard Tom Walsh. Walsh, a 205
pounder from Portland, Oregon,
showed a lot of poise for a'rookie
in last week's Oregon game.
With Walsh replacing Fernan
des and Pike in the lineup for
Hinshaw, the Stanford line's aver
se weight took a dip from 211
pounds to 209, 13 pounds less
ihan Wisconsin.
