# Cal-Iowa highlights Tomorrow's Grid Scene
## 
### 
As Card gridders go East to
battle the Wisconsin Badgers, the
chief Bay Area football interest
will center around California's
first home outing against the na
tion's 10th ranked team —the
Uawkeyes from lowa.
Defeated by the powerful Bob
Jeter and company, 38-12 in the
Rose Bowl January 1, the Golden
Bears will try to avenge that de
feat and win their second straight
ball game of the season.
Crow at Quarterback
Although the Bears, led by
Wayne Crow at quarterback and
Grover Garvin at half, whipped
Washington State in their opener
they will be a definite underdog
against the Forest Evashevski
Hawkeyes in Saturday's clash at
Berkeley.
U9C, an AAWU representative
from the South, also hopes to go
after its second win in a row to
night against Pittsburgh under
the lights in the Coliseum.
The Trojans whipped OSC 27-G
in Portland and are regarded as
the top eleven on the Coast this
season. Pitt whipped Marquette
in their first game so tonight's
battle should be a good one.
Idaho-Washington
Washington's Huskies, the
AAWU conference member from
up North, will also try to run
ther wins to two straight as they
go out against Ihe Idaho Vandals.
The Huskies feature a tough de
fense and strong interior linemen
led by guard Chuck Allen and
tackles Kurt Gegner and Bill Kin
nune.
The other AAWU member—
UCLA is idle this weekend.
In other Pacific Coast action.
WSU journeys south to play San
Jose State's Spartans in what fig

ures to be quite a close one.
Oregon State journeys to Lub
bock, Texas, to iry and grab their
first win at the hands of Texas
Tech. The Beavers, probably
rated as the least-promising of
Coach Tommy Prot tiro's elevens
during his reign at the helm, fea
ture a strong line and faifly in
experienced backs this season.
Oregon vs. Utah
Oregon, fresh after their one
point victory over Stanford here
last Saturday, takes on Utah and
hopes to keep their winning ways.
