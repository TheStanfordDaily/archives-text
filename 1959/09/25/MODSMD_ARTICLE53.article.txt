# Norman Early AAWU Total Offense Leader
## 
### 
The first football statistics of
i he newly formed AAWU showed
Stanford's Dick Norman atop the
league in both passing and total
offense.
Norman, who completed 19
passes against Oregon last Satur
day, rolled up 171 yards through
the air. The (5-3 Stanford quarter
back added seven more yards
rushing to give him a total of
178 yards total offense.
Kilmer Runnem;>
The closest man to Norman in
the total offense race is UCLA's
Bill Kilmer. Kilmer ran for a to
tal of 31 yards against Purdue
last week and passed for 55 more
yards giving him 8G yards on the
day.
Bunched .very closely behind
Norman and Kilmer, were Steve
Bates and Wayne Crow of Cal,
Mac Wylie of Stanford, and Jim
Conroy and Lynn Gaskill of USC
in that order.
Kilmer's 55 yards through the
air were good enough to g;nn him
second place in the league's pass
ing race.
Washington's Bob Schloredt,
who was injured in last week's
game, completed three passes out
of four attempted and grabbed
third place in the passing compe
tition. Schloredt's heaves were
good for -12 yards.
Rushing Leader
Steve Bates of California forged
ahead in the league rushing race
by racking up 71 yards in six car
ries. Stanford's Mac Wylie, who
rolled up 59 yards in 9 carries was
second.
The most remarkable figure of

the week was Lynn GaskilPs
rushing average. The USC back
carried the ball just once bill
went for 54 yards and a touch
down on that one carry.
Stanford's Chris Burford was
far out in front in the reception
statistics. The All-American can
didate grabbed 10 passes in his
opening game good for 91 yards.
Stanford Receives
Of the six leading pass receiv
ers, four were from Stanford.
Halfback Dick Bowers was second
with four catches and 48 yards.
Fullback Skip Face was fifth with
two snares and 15 yards while
halfback John Bond was sixth
grabbing two passes for six
yards.
Oddly enough Stanford, the
only team in the conference to
lose their opener, lead the league
in offense. The Indians made 339
yards against Oregon last Satur
day. California with 300 yards
was second.
