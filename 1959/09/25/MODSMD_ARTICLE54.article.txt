# FOOTBALL'S HERE
## Ducks Nip Cards hi 1959 Opener 
### 
Stanford's football team started
the 1959 season right where they
left off in 1958. Last Saturday the
Indians dropped a squeeker 28-27
to the Oregon Ducks as a last
rninute attempt for a two point
conversion was squashed. The
Stanfordites finished up the 1958
campaign dropping a 16-15 deci-

sion to California when a two
point conversion attempt also
failed.
The Stanford-Oregon fray was
highlighted by some top-notch
offense by both sides. Oregon's
quarterback Dave Grosz lived up
to many of the preseason raves ,
lie received as he passed, ran, and
masterminded the Oregon offense
spectacularly.
Norman Good
The Indians also got a top-notch
job at quarterback as 6-3 Dick
Norman mixed up a potent air
attack that netted the Indians 171
yards with a surprisingly effec- ,
live running game.
Halfback Mac Wylie, and full- i
backs Skip Face and Rick Mc-
Millen provided Stanford with an
excellent ground game.
Stanford Scores First
Stanford picked up the initial
tally in the game, scoring the sec
ond time it had the ball. A Skip
Face punt rolled dead on the Ore
gon four-yard line and when the
Ducks couldn't move the ball out
of the danger zone, they were
forced to punt. After an 8-yard
runback by Face, the Indians
only needed one play to spring
halfback Wylie loose for 30 yards
and a touchdown.

Oregon came right back to tie
the game with Grosz passing the
last 23 to Greg Altenhofen. The
Ducks then rolled up another
touchdown as Grosz carried this
one in himself on a one-yard
sneak.
Stanford's Norman then open
ed up the air attack which led to
another touchdown and a 14-14
1 tie.
A Quick Tally
With one minute and ten sec
onds left in the half, Dave Grosz
led his Oregon mates from their
own 31 all the way to pay dirt.
Hal Steuber, a Stanford sopho
more from Long Beach, Califor
nia, hurdled the line and blocked
Roger - Daniels conversion at
tempt.
I Stanford regained the lead
early in the third quarter. Dick
i Bowers took a screen pass from
Norman and scooted 35 yards
into the end zone. Skip Face, bat
i ting one thousand from the extra
point tee, then kicked his third of
: the day putting the Indians one
point up 21-20.
Oregon wasn't to be down long,
I however, as the Ducks countered
quickly with their fourth touch
down of the game. In an effort
| to regain the lost extra point, the
! Ducks elected to go for two, and
with a play made popular by
I Stanford, the tackle eligible pass,
' they got it.
Grayson Hero
Stanford fought back and after
one fourth-quarter drive stalled
on the Oregon three, the Indians
: finally pushed across another
; tally. With the score then 28-27,
j Stanford elected to go for two
points and a win. Norman faded
back, set himself, and threw
I toward end Chris Burford who
had flared out to the left. Just
i as the ball reached Bui ford's fin
gertips speedy Oregon halfback
Dave Grayson got his hand in the
way knocking the ball to the
ground and insuring a Duck lii
umph.
