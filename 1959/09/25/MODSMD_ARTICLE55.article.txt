# Passing Key to Tribe Attack
## 
### 
In this era of outer space travel
and rockets, Stanford football
fans may find themselves looking
to the air quite often this season.
However, it wouldn't be guided
missiles or satellites that the In
dian fans will be looking at, it will
be passes from the hand of quar
terback Dick Norman.
With the natural pass-catch
combination of Norman and
standout end Chris Burford, the
Indians can't help but gear their
attack to the air. Last year play
ing about half of the time the
rangy Norman finished second in
PCC passing behind his own
team ma'e Bob Nicoiet.
All America Candidate
Burford, who is a strong can
didate for All-American recogni
tion, led the PCC in passes caught
last year with 45 and was third
in the nation in this department.
In Stanford's opening game of
the 1959 season against Oregon,
quarterback N'orman completed
19 of 28 passes attempted and 10

[of these completions were to end
j Burford.
Besides Burford Stanford has
j several other fine receivers,
i Speedy Dick Bowers who plays

halfback is one of the most spec
tacular receivers in college foot
ball. Standing only 5-9 Bowers
uses his sure hands, speed, and
spring to make what seem to be
almost impossible grabs.
Ben Robinson, who missed last
year because of injuries, is back
at end. His 6-5 220-pound frame
gives Norman a big target on
shorter heaves.
Added Strength
Just as added strength at end,
the Indians have Irv Nikolai to
back up Burford and Robinson.
Nikolai played first team last year
and wound up second in the PCC
reception race and seventh in the
nation.
Stanford Coach Jack Curtice
has long been noted for his pass
ing teams. Before coming to
Stanford* two years ago Curtice
held the reins at the University
of Utah where he had one of the
nations top passers in Lee Gross
cup.
The Curtice • offense is deli

nitely one geared to a passing at
tack. One of the halfback posts
is devoted entirely to a pass re
ceiving role. This halfback post,
the left half spot, is flanked on

nearly every play giving the quar
terback, in effect, an additional
end and receiver.
Snrprise Package
The early season play brought
to li; r ht a ground game that most
of the preseason experts felt
Stanford didn't have. Fullback
Skip Face showed exceptional
promise in the running depart
ment against Oregon as he rolled
up several yards eluding many
tacklers. Along with Face, two
extremely hard runners Mac Wy
lie and Rick McMillen also gave
signs of ground gaining ability.
The big question mark facing
Stanford's future plans right now
is the defense. Both the defensive
line and backfield showed flaws
in the season's opener with Ore
gon. On top of this the Indian's
number one lineman Dean llin
shaw was lost for Ihe season
when he suffered a knee injury.
It won't be easy replacing a 6-6
234-pound tackle of Ilinshaw's
caliber.

to li; r ht a ground game that most
of the preseason experts felt
Stanford didn't have. Fullback
Skip Face showed exceptional
promise in the running depart
ment against Oregon as he rolled
up several yards eluding many
tacklers. Along with Face, two
extremely hard runners Mac Wy
lie and Rick McMillen also gave
signs of ground gaining ability.
The big question mark facing
Stanford's future plans right now
is the defense. Both the defensive
line and backfield showed flaws
in the season's opener with Ore
gon. On top of this the Indian's
number one lineman Dean llin
shaw was lost for Ihe season
when he suffered a knee injury.
It won't be easy replacing a 6-6
234-pound tackle of Ilinshaw's
caliber.


DICK NORMAN
He throws them


CHRIS BURFORD
He grabs them
In this era of outer space travel
and rockets, Stanford football
fans may find themselves looking
to the air quite often this season.
However, it wouldn't be guided
missiles or satellites that the In
dian fans will be looking at, it will
be passes from the hand of quar
terback Dick Norman.
With the natural pass-catch
combination of Norman and
standout end Chris Burford, the
Indians can't help but gear their
attack to the air. Last year play
ing about half of the time the
rangy Norman finished second in
PCC passing behind his own
team ma'e Bob Nicoiet.
All America Candidate
Burford, who is a strong can
didate for All-American recogni
tion, led the PCC in passes caught
last year with 45 and was third
in the nation in this department.
In Stanford's opening game of
the 1959 season against Oregon,
quarterback N'orman completed
19 of 28 passes attempted and 10

[of these completions were to end
j Burford.
Besides Burford Stanford has
j several other fine receivers,
i Speedy Dick Bowers who plays

halfback is one of the most spec
tacular receivers in college foot
ball. Standing only 5-9 Bowers
uses his sure hands, speed, and
spring to make what seem to be
almost impossible grabs.
Ben Robinson, who missed last
year because of injuries, is back
at end. His 6-5 220-pound frame
gives Norman a big target on
shorter heaves.
Added Strength
Just as added strength at end,
the Indians have Irv Nikolai to
back up Burford and Robinson.
Nikolai played first team last year
and wound up second in the PCC
reception race and seventh in the
nation.
Stanford Coach Jack Curtice
has long been noted for his pass
ing teams. Before coming to
Stanford* two years ago Curtice
held the reins at the University
of Utah where he had one of the
nations top passers in Lee Gross
cup.
The Curtice • offense is deli

nitely one geared to a passing at
tack. One of the halfback posts
is devoted entirely to a pass re
ceiving role. This halfback post,
the left half spot, is flanked on

nearly every play giving the quar
terback, in effect, an additional
end and receiver.
