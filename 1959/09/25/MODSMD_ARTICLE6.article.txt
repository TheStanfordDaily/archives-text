# Cold War U.S. Fault: Khrushchev
## 
### 
PITTSBURG (/Pi — N i k i t a
Khrushchev, ready to start his
momentous talks with President
Eisenhower, blamed the United
States Thursday for the cold war,
but said he thinks differences be
tween the Soviet Union and the
United States can be ironed out.
On t he cold war, Khrushchev
had a firm conviction:
"The political cold is coming
from you, and not from us. We
are not afraid of the cold but we
would like more favorable winds
to blow."
Audience Appreciative
Khrushchev was closing out a
swing that took him to the West
Coast and back again in eight
days. He spoke to a warmly ap
plauding audience at the Univer
sity of Pittsburg.
Though he blamed this country
for the cold war. there was no
sting in his words, which were
read in English by an interpreter
after he had made some prelimi
nary remarks in Russian.
Ad Libs
After the interpreter finished
the set speech. Khrushchev
bounded back to the microphone
with some ad lib sallies that had
the audience laughing.
The luncheon speech capped a
typically fast-moving day for the
Soviet leader.
Starting in midmorning,
Khrushchev sped out to the plant
of the Mesta Machinery Co.. a
firm which makes equipment for
steel mills.
Needles Officials
There, he needled plant officials
about a lack of U.S.-Soviet trade.
At one point, Khrushchev chal
lenged them to sign a sales agree
ment on the spot.
Shaking hands with many of
tlie Mesta plant's workers, ho
asked about their wages £nd other
conditions.
Impulsive Gifts
One worker impulsively gave
him a cheap cigar, and just as
impulsively Khrushchev snatched
a watch from his wrist and gave
it to the worker. Kenneth Jackey.
In Washington, Eisenhower be
gan final preparations for his
week-end conversations with
Khrushchev in the privacy of
Eisenhower's mountain retreat,
Camp David in the Catoctin
Mountains of northwestern Mary
land. Those talks will begin late
Friday and continue during the
weekend, before Khrushchev re
turns home Sunday night.
Report Possible
A possibility arose that Eisen
hower may make some kind of
public report on the Camp David
talks.
The Soviets have arranged for
Khrushchev to hold an hour-long
news conference after he returns
to Washington from Camp David
Sunday afternoon, and to follow
this up with an hour-long speech
on NBC radio and television.
Having thus delivered his fare
well .sumup to the country at
large, Khrushchev is due to board
the Soviet jet airliner that
brought him here and fly back
to Moscow.
