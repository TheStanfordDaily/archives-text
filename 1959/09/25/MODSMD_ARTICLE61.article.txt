# Funds Won By Briggs
## 
### 
Research funds totaling $22,500
have been awarded to Dr. Wins
low R. Briggs, assistant professor
and specialist in plant physiology,
by the Research Corporation of
New York.
The funds, which were award
ed "with no strings attached,"
will be used on investigations of
plant growth, especially the in
fluence of light on the distribu
tion and metabolism of plant
growth hormones.
Dr. Briggs' work during the
last two years has already con
firmed theories that light does
alter the movement of growth
hormones within the plant.
