# Pres. Sterling, Sundeen Welcome Class of 1963
## 
### 
This welcome is .supplementary
to the one I extended to you at
Freshman Convocation and no less
sincere. May I take a somewhat
different tack than I took then.
Each of you is about to make a
substantial investment in time,
effort and money. If you were an
investor in commercial equities
you would normally expect your
investment to appreciate in value
and pay dividends in the process.
This is certainly what an informed
and trustworthy investment coun
sellor would encourage you to ex
pect.
Then why not take the same
attitude toward the investment,
you will make here during the
next four years? You are really
investing yourself, which is the
most valuable commodity you
have. It is up to you to determine
whether you make this investment
in "blue chip" enterprises which
grow and endure, or in "cats and
flogs" which howl and whine in
unproductive extracurricular con
fusion. Good counsel you can get
for the asking, but the basic choice
is yours. Make it well and make
it. stick!
-I. K. WAM,A('K STIRLING
President, Stanford University

On behalf of the Associated
Students of Stanford University,
may I extend to you a sincere
welcome. We pride ourselves at
Stanford in having very friendly
and cordial relations among its
members. I hope that you, too,
have already found this to be true
of our campus.
Besides coming to regard Stan
ford University as your home I
hope that you will find it a place
of varied and rewarding experi
ences.
Through participation in these
aspects of Stanford life the indi
vidual broadens his or her life's
horizons and thereby moves along
the path of a person who desires
to learn. Thus, T would encourage
you while you are here at Stan
ford to concern yourself with not
only the textbook side of univer
sity life, but also with those
ASSU and other student events
and activities that lend toward
the education of the individual.
Again, we are happy to have
you all with us.
Good luck!
Kicli Sundeen,
President, Associated Students
of Stanford University
