Freshmen enrollment shows a four per cent gain over last year's
total. The Class of '63, 1,325 strong, is composed of 875 men and
450 women.

ter and greater scholarship aid,
said Hall.

changes were necessary. About

Two hundred twenty-five trans

activity.
The registrar estimates a total
of 5,300 undergraduates.

turning Stanford students and
those from other schools.
The largest enrollment in Stanford history—B,9o'o students is ox
pooled for the autumn quarter, according to Registrar Harvey Hall.
Freshmen enrollment shows a four per cent gain over last year's
total. The Class of '63, 1,325 strong, is composed of 875 men and
450 women.

Increase in frosh enrollment is
due to a higher acceptance rate—
the proportion of those who are
admitted and then actually regis
ter and greater scholarship aid,
said Hall.
Since a normal freshman class
has 1,250 students, housing
changes were necessary. About
150 freshman men will be distrib
uted between Stern Hail and
Stanford Village in Menlo Park.
The Village contingent will be
moved oivcampus by winter quar
ter.
Twenty-two frosh girls will be
moved into Manzanita Lodge, for
merly occupied by students in the
Graduate School of Business.
Since W edne s d a y freshmen
have been following an orientation
or "pre reg" program, under the
direction of Chairman Mike Im
mel and Mike Erlin and Barbara
Norman.
Hall predicted a total enroll
ment of 3,600 graduate students
as compared with 3.1 13 of last
year. They are distributed among
the various graduate schools rath
er than concentrated in the sci
ence fields, he noted.
