WHILE YOU WERE GONE —
WAS AT WORK
plotting new and better ways to sep
arate you from your ill-gained dollars.
Caught up in the spiraling inflation, a captive of
American expansionism, hard-pressed by a rapidly
increasing family and pressed in by the growing

There was no alternative to DOUBLINC our store
space in a new location, one block nearer the cam
pus. * *
Here we have more books, more art prints, more
studio cards — and MORE fun. Soon (if they ever
deliver the espresso machine) we'll even have a
coffee house.
So look for your required and rccommendcd paper
backs at . . .
