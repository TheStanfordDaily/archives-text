# Mud-Soaked Indians Nearly Upset Badgers
## Wisconsin Nips Stanford 16-14 
### 
With the rain pounding down in monsoon fashion and gales of
up to 50 miles per hour, the Stanford Indian football team nearly
pulled a stunning upset before a Wisconsin crowd of almost 42,000,
but dropped a squeeker to the hometown Wisconsin Badgers 16-14.
Deapite the fact that the Indians were nipped by the Badgers,
there was no doubt that Stanford!

Coach Jack Curtice's gridders
won the highest respects of the
midwestern writers and fans.
Highly Ranked
Wisconsin, which at the begin
ning of the week was selected as
the fourth ranked team in the
nation, had'a scrap to the finish
before they could subdue an un
ranked and unheralded Stanford
team by a mere two points.
Coming from an early 16-point
deficit the Stanford team fought
its way back into I lie game scor
ing two touchdowns in the second
half while the Wisconsin skies
poured forth with what seemed
like an ocean of water.
Stanford quarterback Dick
Norman, who had to be consid
ered the outstanding individual in
the contest, completed passes
off his ears, his head, and even
connected on one loft handed toss.
211 Yards
The spectacular junior quarter
back did a few ballet steps be
tween the puddles covering Camp
Randall Field and was able to
roll out and complete 17 of 25
pass attempts for an amazing
211 yards.
Norman was not the only Stan
fordite who made a bid to outdo
the Dolshoi Ballet. Ends Ben Rob
inson and Chris Burford along
with halfbacks Mac Wylie and
Dick Bowers did some pretty
fancy stepping in nabbing 15
passes among them.
The 6-5 Robinson perhaps out
shone his team mates a little bit
as he grabbed six of Norman's
heaves. The lanky Robinson
looked something like a giraffe
doing the mambo and trying to
keep his feet dry at the same
time as he snared passes of S, 10,
15, 19 yards, and two 7 yarders.
The Badgers were sparked
most of the afternoon by quarter
back Dale Hackbart, fullback Tom
Weisner, who netted 95 yards on
the ground, and halfback Ron
Steiner.
Hackbart Injured
Hackbart injured a knee in fall
practice and did not start, but
when it appeared obvious his re-
placement, sophomore Jim Bak
ken, wasn't going to be able to do
the job at quarter, Hackbart en
tered the game.
It was Tom Weisner, however,
and not the Ail-American candi
date Hackbart that did the In
dians the most harm. Weisner
bulled in for both Badger touch
downs and was the leading
rusher in the game.
Wisconsin drew the game's
first' blood with 5:22 remaining
in the first quarter, scoring from
37 yards out on six plays after
I >ick Bowers fumbled a Wiscon
sin punt.
Three More
Wisconsin scored three more
points with only 1:35 left in the
first half. After the Badger at
tack had stalled for three downs
on the Stanford nine, reserve
tackle Jim Holzworth entered the
game and kicked what amounted
to a 26-yard field goal.
This field goal proved to be
the most important play of the

game as it later turned out to be
llie difference on the final score
board.
Nine points down, Stanford
opened the second half looking
much sharper than they had
earlier. They moved the ball
from their own 32 to the Wiscon
sin 33. But at this point the Bad
gers got break when Stanford
end Chris Burford had the ball
stolen from him by Weisner after
catching a Norman pass.
ltazzle-Dazzle
The Badgers didn't lose any
time pushing the ball back up
the field as they scored 11 plays
later. Weisner plunged the last
yard after a series of razzle-daz
zle laterals and double reverses
had moved the Badgers to the
one.
Jim Holzworth converted and
the score became 16-0 in favor of
Wisconsin.
With Stanford in possession of
the ball again after the kickoff,
Dick Norman began clicking with
remarkable consistency. He hit
on four straight passes, the fourth

one being a fifty-four yard scor
ing pass to captain Burford.
With the rain pouring down in
torrents, the two teams neither
wanting to fumble the wet ball
deep in their own territory, ex
changed punts before Stanford
! launched its final touchdown
march.
With Norman's passes and
Robinson's and Burford's recep
tions the Indians went from their
own 28 all the way to pay dirt.
Norman ran the two-point con
version.
Unfortunately for the Indians
their second touchdown, leaving
them two points down, came with
only 1:46 remaining in the game.
However, in hopes of a miracle,
the Stanfordites tried an onsides
kick. After a pile of mud-soaked
players was unstacked at the 50-
yard line, Stanford's final hopes
were dashed when ihe Badgers
Jerry Stalcup came out with the
! ball.

up to 50 miles per hour, the Stanford Indian football team nearly
pulled a stunning upset before a Wisconsin crowd of almost 42,000,
but dropped a squeeker to the hometown Wisconsin Badgers 16-14.
Deapite the fact that the Indians were nipped by the Badgers,
there was no doubt that Stanford!

Coach Jack Curtice's gridders
won the highest respects of the
midwestern writers and fans.
Highly Ranked
Wisconsin, which at the begin
ning of the week was selected as
the fourth ranked team in the
nation, had'a scrap to the finish
before they could subdue an un
ranked and unheralded Stanford
team by a mere two points.
Coming from an early 16-point
deficit the Stanford team fought
its way back into I lie game scor
ing two touchdowns in the second
half while the Wisconsin skies
poured forth with what seemed
like an ocean of water.
Stanford quarterback Dick
Norman, who had to be consid
ered the outstanding individual in
the contest, completed passes
off his ears, his head, and even
connected on one loft handed toss.
211 Yards
The spectacular junior quarter
back did a few ballet steps be
tween the puddles covering Camp
Randall Field and was able to
roll out and complete 17 of 25
pass attempts for an amazing
211 yards.
Norman was not the only Stan
fordite who made a bid to outdo
the Dolshoi Ballet. Ends Ben Rob
inson and Chris Burford along
with halfbacks Mac Wylie and
Dick Bowers did some pretty
fancy stepping in nabbing 15
passes among them.
The 6-5 Robinson perhaps out
shone his team mates a little bit
as he grabbed six of Norman's
heaves. The lanky Robinson
looked something like a giraffe
doing the mambo and trying to
keep his feet dry at the same
time as he snared passes of S, 10,
15, 19 yards, and two 7 yarders.
The Badgers were sparked
most of the afternoon by quarter
back Dale Hackbart, fullback Tom
Weisner, who netted 95 yards on
the ground, and halfback Ron
Steiner.
Hackbart Injured
Hackbart injured a knee in fall
practice and did not start, but
when it appeared obvious his re-
placement, sophomore Jim Bak
ken, wasn't going to be able to do
the job at quarter, Hackbart en
tered the game.
It was Tom Weisner, however,
and not the Ail-American candi
date Hackbart that did the In
dians the most harm. Weisner
bulled in for both Badger touch
downs and was the leading
rusher in the game.
Wisconsin drew the game's
first' blood with 5:22 remaining
in the first quarter, scoring from
37 yards out on six plays after
I >ick Bowers fumbled a Wiscon
sin punt.
Three More
Wisconsin scored three more
points with only 1:35 left in the
first half. After the Badger at
tack had stalled for three downs
on the Stanford nine, reserve
tackle Jim Holzworth entered the
game and kicked what amounted
to a 26-yard field goal.
This field goal proved to be
the most important play of the

game as it later turned out to be
llie difference on the final score
board.
Nine points down, Stanford
opened the second half looking
much sharper than they had
earlier. They moved the ball
from their own 32 to the Wiscon
sin 33. But at this point the Bad
gers got break when Stanford
end Chris Burford had the ball
stolen from him by Weisner after
catching a Norman pass.
ltazzle-Dazzle
The Badgers didn't lose any
time pushing the ball back up
the field as they scored 11 plays
later. Weisner plunged the last
yard after a series of razzle-daz
zle laterals and double reverses
had moved the Badgers to the
one.
Jim Holzworth converted and
the score became 16-0 in favor of
Wisconsin.
With Stanford in possession of
the ball again after the kickoff,
Dick Norman began clicking with
remarkable consistency. He hit
on four straight passes, the fourth

one being a fifty-four yard scor
ing pass to captain Burford.
With the rain pouring down in
torrents, the two teams neither
wanting to fumble the wet ball
deep in their own territory, ex
changed punts before Stanford
! launched its final touchdown
march.
With Norman's passes and
Robinson's and Burford's recep
tions the Indians went from their
own 28 all the way to pay dirt.
Norman ran the two-point con
version.
Unfortunately for the Indians
their second touchdown, leaving
them two points down, came with
only 1:46 remaining in the game.
However, in hopes of a miracle,
the Stanfordites tried an onsides
kick. After a pile of mud-soaked
players was unstacked at the 50-
yard line, Stanford's final hopes
were dashed when ihe Badgers
Jerry Stalcup came out with the
! ball.

pulled a stunning upset before a Wisconsin crowd of almost 42,000,
but dropped a squeeker to the hometown Wisconsin Badgers 16-14.
Deapite the fact that the Indians were nipped by the Badgers,
there was no doubt that Stanford!

Coach Jack Curtice's gridders
won the highest respects of the
midwestern writers and fans.
Highly Ranked
Wisconsin, which at the begin
ning of the week was selected as
the fourth ranked team in the
nation, had'a scrap to the finish
before they could subdue an un
ranked and unheralded Stanford
team by a mere two points.
Coming from an early 16-point
deficit the Stanford team fought
its way back into I lie game scor
ing two touchdowns in the second
half while the Wisconsin skies
poured forth with what seemed
like an ocean of water.
Stanford quarterback Dick
Norman, who had to be consid
ered the outstanding individual in
the contest, completed passes
off his ears, his head, and even
connected on one loft handed toss.
211 Yards
The spectacular junior quarter
back did a few ballet steps be
tween the puddles covering Camp
Randall Field and was able to
roll out and complete 17 of 25
pass attempts for an amazing
211 yards.
Norman was not the only Stan
fordite who made a bid to outdo
the Dolshoi Ballet. Ends Ben Rob
inson and Chris Burford along
with halfbacks Mac Wylie and
Dick Bowers did some pretty
fancy stepping in nabbing 15
passes among them.
The 6-5 Robinson perhaps out
shone his team mates a little bit
as he grabbed six of Norman's
heaves. The lanky Robinson
looked something like a giraffe
doing the mambo and trying to
keep his feet dry at the same
time as he snared passes of S, 10,
15, 19 yards, and two 7 yarders.
The Badgers were sparked
most of the afternoon by quarter
back Dale Hackbart, fullback Tom
Weisner, who netted 95 yards on
the ground, and halfback Ron
Steiner.
Hackbart Injured
Hackbart injured a knee in fall
practice and did not start, but
when it appeared obvious his re-
placement, sophomore Jim Bak
ken, wasn't going to be able to do
the job at quarter, Hackbart en
tered the game.
It was Tom Weisner, however,
and not the Ail-American candi
date Hackbart that did the In
dians the most harm. Weisner
bulled in for both Badger touch
downs and was the leading
rusher in the game.
Wisconsin drew the game's
first' blood with 5:22 remaining
in the first quarter, scoring from
37 yards out on six plays after
I >ick Bowers fumbled a Wiscon
sin punt.
Three More
Wisconsin scored three more
points with only 1:35 left in the
first half. After the Badger at
tack had stalled for three downs
on the Stanford nine, reserve
tackle Jim Holzworth entered the
game and kicked what amounted
to a 26-yard field goal.
This field goal proved to be
the most important play of the

game as it later turned out to be
llie difference on the final score
board.
Nine points down, Stanford
opened the second half looking
much sharper than they had
earlier. They moved the ball
from their own 32 to the Wiscon
sin 33. But at this point the Bad
gers got break when Stanford
end Chris Burford had the ball
stolen from him by Weisner after
catching a Norman pass.
ltazzle-Dazzle
The Badgers didn't lose any
time pushing the ball back up
the field as they scored 11 plays
later. Weisner plunged the last
yard after a series of razzle-daz
zle laterals and double reverses
had moved the Badgers to the
one.
Jim Holzworth converted and
the score became 16-0 in favor of
Wisconsin.
With Stanford in possession of
the ball again after the kickoff,
Dick Norman began clicking with
remarkable consistency. He hit
on four straight passes, the fourth

one being a fifty-four yard scor
ing pass to captain Burford.
With the rain pouring down in
torrents, the two teams neither
wanting to fumble the wet ball
deep in their own territory, ex
changed punts before Stanford
! launched its final touchdown
march.
With Norman's passes and
Robinson's and Burford's recep
tions the Indians went from their
own 28 all the way to pay dirt.
Norman ran the two-point con
version.
Unfortunately for the Indians
their second touchdown, leaving
them two points down, came with
only 1:46 remaining in the game.
However, in hopes of a miracle,
the Stanfordites tried an onsides
kick. After a pile of mud-soaked
players was unstacked at the 50-
yard line, Stanford's final hopes
were dashed when ihe Badgers
Jerry Stalcup came out with the
! ball.
