# Mud-Soaked Indians Nearly Upset Badgers
## Wisconsin Nips Stanford 16-14 
### 
With the rain pounding down in monsoon fashion and gales of
up to 50 miles per hour, the Stanford Indian football team nearly
pulled a stunning upset before a Wisconsin crowd of almost 42,000,
but dropped a squeeker to the hometown Wisconsin Badgers 16-14.
Deapite the fact that the Indians were nipped by the Badgers,
there was no doubt that Stanford!

Coach Jack Curtice's gridders
won the highest respects of the
midwestern writers and fans.
Highly Ranked
Wisconsin, which at the begin
ning of the week was selected as
the fourth ranked team in the
nation, had'a scrap to the finish

passes among them.
The 6-5 Robinson perhaps out
shone his team mates a little bit
as he grabbed six of Norman's
heaves. The lanky Robinson
looked something like a giraffe
doing the mambo and trying to
keep his feet dry at the same
time as he snared passes of S, 10,
15, 19 yards, and two 7 yarders.
The Badgers were sparked
most of the afternoon by quarter
back Dale Hackbart, fullback Tom
Weisner, who netted 95 yards on
the ground, and halfback Ron

practice and did not start, but
