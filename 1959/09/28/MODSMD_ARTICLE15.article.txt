Merrill said, "everything was ab
solutely glorious," at the Jolly-

evening.

effectively penetrate into the
Jolly-Up wore the ones who went

Other sophs weren't so success

the trees, as was the sophomore
who claimed to have been as
signed by the Chapparal to do
that publication's cover, of the
Jolly-Up, of course.
The Jolly-t p was just one of

freshmen busy this weekend.
Saturday afternoon they attended
the Co-Rec Day on the Girls' Gym
lawn and Sunday morning they
spont at the Memorial Church
Freshman Service. Sunday after
