## Parking Fees 
### Doug Willis 
Vehicle registration fees for Stanford students have been raised
to $10 yearly effective today, according to Special Assistant to the
President, Frederic O. Glover. University officials report that they
have been forced to increase the fee or to find some other way to
either raise additional incom or to reduce costs. Glover explained
some of the alternatives to the fee increase:
"It was decided," Glover said, "that allocation of a fair share of
Ihe costs to those responsible for them seemed a more appropriate
solution to the problem than even to consider banning autos from
ihe campus, as has been the solution at some other universities."
Most .students seem to think that the higher fee is the fairest
solution to the problem. Steve Thayer, off-campus, said, "I think
that it's better to have students with cars pay proportionally more,
rather than to get so much out of the money from tuitions paid
by non-drivers."
Ed Strong, off campus, said that he thought that part of the
reason for the fee increase is to discourage so many student cars.
Special Assistant to the President, Kenneth M. Cuthbertson, said
that this was not the case and that he did not think that students
had unnecessary cars on campus.
Cuthbertson also explained why faculty and staff members are
not charged for vehicle registration. "We would eventually make
it up to them in salary increases," he said, "and then the money
would still be coming from the same source." Most students and
faculty members agreed with Cuthbertson, but Sigma Chi Mike
Forster suggested, "I think that the faculty and staff could pay
something to help, maybe $3."
Theta IJelta Chi Darwin Dapper thinks that the new fee is all
right because parking is so much more expensive at other schools.
"But on the other band, the roads never have b(*n good, and
(here are very few places to park. So I don't think thai I'm getting
my money's worth."
But according to Assistant University Business Manager Sera
phin F. Post, the 1958-59 university budget included nearly $100,000
in expenses attributed directly to student vehicles. Auto registra
tions, on the other hand, contributed only $18,000 to the general
funds.
According' to estimates released by the administration last spring,
approximately $65,000 were allocated to cover depreciation and road
and parking lot maintenance. Post added that actual receipts in
the business office show Ihat a little over $39,100 was spent during
the 12 months ending August 31 on the maintenance of roaris in
ihe academic campus alone.
The annual traffic control budget for next year, including staff,
clerical, auto and motorcycle expenses, will be $36,830.
Cuthbertson outlined the problem in detail. "We could have
continued to take more money for roads out of the general fund,
which everybody contributes to when he pays his tuition, or we
could make the students driving cars pay for ihe roads. We think
â€¢that $10 yearly is a more equitable sum than $3. We expect to
iiat.se about $48,000 with the new fee, and the remainder of the
deficit will be covered by the general fund.
University officials explain that the higher fee won't necessarily
mean more money for roads. The University business office reports
that the budgets for both the police department and road mainte
nance have been increased for the coming year, hut not because of
the new fee.
"Our roads and police budget operates in a deficit," explained
Glover, "and we are trying to decrease that deficit."
DeWitt Landiis, a transfer student from California Institute of
Technology, made a comparison. "At Cal Tech it cost $4 or $5
registration for a reserved parking place for all year." A nationwide
survey, however, showed that Stanford's fees were below the aver
age. Typical figures were: New York University, $10; Harvard, $30;
University of Chicago, $18 to $26; Oklahoma, $10; Penn Stale, $20;
University of Pennsylvania, $20; Temple, $52; and lowest, Western
Reserve, $1.
