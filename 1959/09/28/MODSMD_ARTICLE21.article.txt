# 1960 EMBARRASSMENT
## Party Promises Unfilled 
### JACK BELL 
WASHINGTON </P) — Demo
crats and .Republicans appear
headed toward default on a ma
jority of the promises they made
to voters in their 1956 platforms.
Unless the next session of Con
gress packs into six months time
action ori 10 highly controversial
problems, both parties are going
to face some embarrassingly un
redeemed pledges when iheir con
vention committees start drafting
new platforms next July.
Although the Democrats have
controlled Congress in the last
three years, the record indi
cates the Eisenhower adminis
tration has come closer than the
Democrats to carrying out 1956
promises. But neither party has
a hatting average worth brag
ging about.
This seems to bear out the com
plaints of Sen. William Proxmire
(DYVis) and others who class
themselves as liberals that the
Democratic leadership in Con
gress hasn't gone far in imple
menting the party's platform.
On 10 major issues, congres
sional actions have fallen short of
the shining promises made by one
or both of the parties.
These include a general farm
program, increased postal rates,
school construction aid, revi
sion of the immigration laws,
elimination of tax inequities, a
boost in the minimum wage, aid
to depressed areas, and in
creases in social security bene
fits.
While Congress passed a civil
rights law in 1957, it fell short of
I he goal set by both parties to
eliminate racial discrimination in
education and in other fields.
Both parties promised budget
balancing, after which the deficit
set a peacetime record in the fis
cal year which ended last June 30.
If the budget is balanced this
year, President Eisenhower ap
parently will claim most of the
credit.
About the only pledge the
two parties made that has been
redeemed in full was statehood

for Alaska and Hawaii.
Partly because of Eisenhower's
efforts in arousing public opin
ion, Republicans came closer than
the Democrats to getting the kind
of labor control bill they wanted.
In 1956, the Democratic plat
form pledged that party to "strike
off ttie shackles which the Taft-
Hartley law has unjustly imposed
on labor." It called "unequivo
cably" for repeal of the act.
Republicans promised to "re
vise and improve the Taft-
Hartley Act so as to protect
more effectively the rights of
labor unions, management, the
individual worker and the pub
lic."
By his vetoes, Eisenhower
trimmed the housing program
down from the more expansive
Democratic framework to the
less-enthusiastic level of the Re
publicans.
Although he didn't get all he
wanted, Eisenhower did get an
increase in interest rates on gov
ernment savings bonds. This
came despite the 1956 Democratic
promise of "a vigilant review of
our debt management policy in
order to reduce interest rates."
Democrats triumphed in the
argument over a water projects
program when they enacted
over a presidential veto a rivers
and harbors measure carrying
67 more project starts than the
Budget Bureau had approved.
Democrats bragged also that
they had provided the funds for
"the largest crash program in
history to attack cancer and heart
disease," while ignoring the Re
publican proposal for reinsurance
of voluntary health insurance
plans.
Although Eisenhower prevailed
in keeping defense expenditures
down, the Democrats contended
they hd provided "the flexibility
needed to accelerate the missile
research program." and had
spurred anti-submarine warfare
projects.
The President had to com
promise with the opposition on
continuing the interstate high

way program he originally pro
posed. He got a one cent in
crease in the gasoline tax in
stead of the l'i cents he re
quested.
But on other platform issues
the record of accomplishment was
almost nil.

On 10 major issues, congres
sional actions have fallen short of

These include a general farm

school construction aid, revi

elimination of tax inequities, a
boost in the minimum wage, aid
to depressed areas, and in

While Congress passed a civil

balancing, after which the deficit

About the only pledge the

Partly because of Eisenhower's
efforts in arousing public opin
ion, Republicans came closer than
the Democrats to getting the kind
of labor control bill they wanted.
In 1956, the Democratic plat
form pledged that party to "strike
off ttie shackles which the Taft-
Hartley law has unjustly imposed
on labor." It called "unequivo
cably" for repeal of the act.
Republicans promised to "re
vise and improve the Taft-
Hartley Act so as to protect
more effectively the rights of
labor unions, management, the
individual worker and the pub
lic."
By his vetoes, Eisenhower
trimmed the housing program
down from the more expansive
Democratic framework to the
less-enthusiastic level of the Re
publicans.
Although he didn't get all he
wanted, Eisenhower did get an
increase in interest rates on gov
ernment savings bonds. This
came despite the 1956 Democratic
promise of "a vigilant review of
our debt management policy in
order to reduce interest rates."
Democrats triumphed in the
argument over a water projects
program when they enacted
over a presidential veto a rivers
and harbors measure carrying
67 more project starts than the
Budget Bureau had approved.
Democrats bragged also that
they had provided the funds for
"the largest crash program in
history to attack cancer and heart
disease," while ignoring the Re
publican proposal for reinsurance
of voluntary health insurance
plans.
Although Eisenhower prevailed
in keeping defense expenditures
down, the Democrats contended
they hd provided "the flexibility
needed to accelerate the missile
research program." and had
spurred anti-submarine warfare
projects.
The President had to com
promise with the opposition on
continuing the interstate high

way program he originally pro
posed. He got a one cent in
crease in the gasoline tax in
stead of the l'i cents he re

But on other platform issues
the record of accomplishment was
almost nil.

ion, Republicans came closer than
the Democrats to getting the kind
of labor control bill they wanted.
In 1956, the Democratic plat
form pledged that party to "strike
off ttie shackles which the Taft-
Hartley law has unjustly imposed
on labor." It called "unequivo
cably" for repeal of the act.
Republicans promised to "re
vise and improve the Taft-
Hartley Act so as to protect
more effectively the rights of
labor unions, management, the
individual worker and the pub
lic."
By his vetoes, Eisenhower
trimmed the housing program
down from the more expansive
Democratic framework to the
less-enthusiastic level of the Re
publicans.
Although he didn't get all he
wanted, Eisenhower did get an
increase in interest rates on gov
ernment savings bonds. This
came despite the 1956 Democratic
promise of "a vigilant review of
our debt management policy in
order to reduce interest rates."
Democrats triumphed in the
argument over a water projects
program when they enacted
over a presidential veto a rivers
and harbors measure carrying
67 more project starts than the
Budget Bureau had approved.
Democrats bragged also that
they had provided the funds for
"the largest crash program in
history to attack cancer and heart
disease," while ignoring the Re
publican proposal for reinsurance
of voluntary health insurance
plans.
Although Eisenhower prevailed
in keeping defense expenditures
down, the Democrats contended
they hd provided "the flexibility
needed to accelerate the missile
research program." and had
spurred anti-submarine warfare
projects.
The President had to com
promise with the opposition on
continuing the interstate high

way program he originally pro
posed. He got a one cent in
crease in the gasoline tax in
stead of the l'i cents he re
quested.
But on other platform issues
the record of accomplishment was
almost nil.
