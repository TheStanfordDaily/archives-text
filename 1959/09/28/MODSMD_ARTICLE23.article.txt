# Action Pending
## 
### 
John Opsahl, 18-year-old Stan
ford sophomore, has been re
leased on $150 bail pending action
against him by the Alcoholic
Beverage Commission on a charge
of purchasing beer under age.
Since Opsahl is technically not a
Stanford student because ho is
not enrolled as yet this fall, the
situation is between him and the
ABC. The University is an inter-
I ested bystander.
