## Soggy Setback Doesn't Dampen Card Gridders 
### 
"Just a matter of three to five
points in our opening two games
and we would probably be in the
top ten right now."
These were the sentiments of
Stanford football Coach Jack Cur
tice and his mud-soaked Indian
warriors after dropping a close
16-14 decision to the number four
ranked team in the nation, the
University of Wisconsin Badgers.
3 Points
In the first two weeks of the
1959 football campaign the In
dians have lost two games by the
combined total of three points.
Two Saturdays ago the Stanford
team was nosed out by the Ore
gon VVebfoots 28-27 and last Sat
urday it was the two-point loss to
Wisconsin.
Despite the frustration involved
in losing games by such close
scores, the Card gridders were
extremely enthusiastic over their
chances for the rest of the season.
.Much Praise
Coach Curtice had many words
of praise for several of his per
formers. Quarterback Dick Nor
| man and ends Chris Burford and
i Ben Robinson were high on Cur
| tice's list of compliments.

This trio of players played su
perb football under' some of the
most hazardous conditions that
any team will face this year. With
the rain pouring dovvn Norman
and his ends combined for pass
completions galore.
Curtice was perhaps most ex
cited though over the play of his
young middle linemen.
"Those four guards, Lacey
(Larry Lacey), Leahy (Gary
Leahy i, Walsh (Tom Walsh i.and
Peter (Don Petert played the
heck out of the game."
These four linemen were not
bullied about by the much larger
Wisconsin linemen as many fore
casters had predicted they would
be.
New Experience
Many of t tie Stanford players
had never before played on a
football field in the rain. Hall
back John Bond commented that
in his eight years of football he'd
never before had to cope with
rain.
"It was raining so hard in the
second half," continued Bond,
"that I couldn't hear signals with
the rain pounding on my hel
met."
When asked how it felt to meet
up with the highly regarded Wis
consin linemen, one Stanford
tackle mentioned that he thought
Dean Hinshaw, ace Stanford
tackle who was injured in the
Card opener, was tougher than
any lineman he saw all day.
Stevenson Guest
Among the 42,000 fans that sat
through the rain to watch Ihe
game was ex-Illinois governor
and presidential candidate Adlai
Stevenson.
Stevenson was the guest of
Wisconsin Governor- Nelson at
the game.

Wisconsin Governor- Nelson at
the game.
"Just a matter of three to five
points in our opening two games
and we would probably be in the
top ten right now."
These were the sentiments of
Stanford football Coach Jack Cur
tice and his mud-soaked Indian
warriors after dropping a close
16-14 decision to the number four
ranked team in the nation, the
University of Wisconsin Badgers.
3 Points
In the first two weeks of the
1959 football campaign the In
dians have lost two games by the
combined total of three points.
Two Saturdays ago the Stanford
team was nosed out by the Ore
gon VVebfoots 28-27 and last Sat
urday it was the two-point loss to
Wisconsin.
Despite the frustration involved
in losing games by such close
scores, the Card gridders were
extremely enthusiastic over their
chances for the rest of the season.
.Much Praise
Coach Curtice had many words
of praise for several of his per
formers. Quarterback Dick Nor
| man and ends Chris Burford and
i Ben Robinson were high on Cur
| tice's list of compliments.

This trio of players played su
perb football under' some of the
most hazardous conditions that
any team will face this year. With
the rain pouring dovvn Norman
and his ends combined for pass
completions galore.
Curtice was perhaps most ex
cited though over the play of his
young middle linemen.
"Those four guards, Lacey
(Larry Lacey), Leahy (Gary
Leahy i, Walsh (Tom Walsh i.and
Peter (Don Petert played the
heck out of the game."
These four linemen were not
bullied about by the much larger
Wisconsin linemen as many fore
casters had predicted they would
be.
New Experience
Many of t tie Stanford players
had never before played on a
football field in the rain. Hall
back John Bond commented that
in his eight years of football he'd
never before had to cope with
rain.
"It was raining so hard in the
second half," continued Bond,
"that I couldn't hear signals with
the rain pounding on my hel
met."
When asked how it felt to meet
up with the highly regarded Wis
consin linemen, one Stanford
tackle mentioned that he thought
Dean Hinshaw, ace Stanford
tackle who was injured in the
Card opener, was tougher than
any lineman he saw all day.
Stevenson Guest
Among the 42,000 fans that sat
through the rain to watch Ihe
game was ex-Illinois governor
and presidential candidate Adlai
Stevenson.
Stevenson was the guest of
Wisconsin Governor- Nelson at
the game.
