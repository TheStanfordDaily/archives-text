# Roundup of AAWU Teams
## 
### 
All ended up just abput as ex
pected last weekend in West
Coast football action. California
was trounced by the University
of lowa, -42-12, USC dumped Pitt,
23-0, and the University of Wash
ington ran all over Idaho, also
23-0.
The Cal-lowa game was almost
a review of last year's Hose Bowl,
as the powerful Hawkeyes, if
possible, looked better than they
did in beating the Bears on New
Year's Day. lowa seemed to be
able to score at will against what
appeared to be a weak Cal Club.
At first glance it looked as if the
Berkeleyites might make a game
of it as they drew first blood with
56 seconds of the game gone, but
then the Cal attack and defense
went to pieces, and the Hawks
rolled up the highest score against
a Bear team since 1955.
The USC Trojans showed their
suspected power as they rolled
over the University of Pittsburgh,
but the Troy were dealt a bad
blow when quarterback Willie
Wood sustained a shoulder sepa
ration on the first play of the
game, and it is doubtful if he
will be able to see any action for
the rest of this season.
Washington's Huskies, with the
help of some great running by
halfback George Fleming on a
very soggy field, easily handled
the Vandals of Idaho in Seattle.
