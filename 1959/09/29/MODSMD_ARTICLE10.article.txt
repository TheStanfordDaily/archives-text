# Ike: Summit Talks Virtually Certain
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/Pi—President
| Eisenhower said Monday his se
' eret talks with Soviet Premier
j Nikita Khrushchev about Berlin's
future led to enough progress to
j wipe out many of his objections
j to a summit conference.
At a special news conference,
I Eisenhower strongly hinted a top
level East-West parley is now vir
tually certain—but not until he
consults with British, French,
West German and other allied
leaders.
The President said that Khrush
chev has now agreed there will
be no deadline for East-West ne
gotiations to meet in seeking a
peaceful settlement.
Eisenhower said Khrushchev
has agreed these talks should not
be "unnecessarily or unduly ex
tended." He did not explain
whether this meant negotiators
[ would have days, weeks or
■ months to talk.
Eisenhower gave no clue to the
j kind of Berlin settlement that
I might lie shaping up.
But he specified: "Any agree-
I ment must be acceptable to the
j people of the area, including the
j most concerned—the people of
i West Berlin and the federal re
public of Germany."
Khrushchev in reporting Sun
: day on his talks said he and Ei
| senhower found much in common
j in their search for a settlement
! of the Berlin crisis.
And Monday, back in Moscow,
Khrushchev shouted to loud ap
plause at a homecoming rally:
"Long live American - Soviet
friendship!"
Eisenhower gave these points
as to the results of his talks with
Khrushchev:

1. The Soviet leader showed
himself to he an extraordinary
man. He appeared to be a pas
sionate believer in the Commu
nist system, switching from a
negative and difficult attitude to
geniality as he debated issues
with the President.
2. He and Khrushchev both de
plored the need to spend billions

J for arms. But no new start was
made on the big problem of dis
arming under proper controls.
3. V. S. Emelyanov, Khrush
chev's atomic energy chief, said
the Soviet Union and the United
States must develop the peaceful
uses of atomic energy together
"because it is just too expensive
for one country alone."
