j A center for training teachers of
Chinese and Japanese languages
has been established at Stanford
in line with recent attempts to im
plement the National Defense Ed
ucation Act of 1958.
One of 14 universities named
as centers for "critical" languages
(Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi,
Portuguese and Russian), Stan
ford has been enlisted to help
train the necessary personnel to
extend the knowledge and use of
these languages where instruc
tion ordinarily is not easily avail
able.
At present, six persons are
studying Chinese under these gov
ernment grants and one is study
ing Japanese. All are graduate
students.
Students Participating
The Chinese scholars include
James E. Briggs, Mrs. Darlene
Goodwin, Miss Roxane Heater,
Michael McCaskey, Robert Mor
rell and Peter Rooney. The stu
dent in Japanese is Donald Gui
mary.
The grants, covering tuition,
transportation and support, in
cluding support for dependents,
range from $2000 to $5000. Stan
ford is matching the grants from
the government with donations
to the center.
Diplomatic Step
Professor Shau Wing Chan,
Head of the Asian Languages de
partment and head of the center,
remarked that the program "indi
cates that the federal government
is beginning to recognize the im
portance of these languages nor
mally not taught in American in
stitutions," and felt that increased
instruction in them is a necessary
diplomatic step.
Other Chinese and/or Japanese
language centers are located at
the University of Chicago. Har
vard, the University of Kansas
and the University of Washing
ton. Centers for the other "criti
cal" languages are at Harvard.
Princeton, Yale. Columbia, New-
York University and the Univer
sities of Michigan, Pennsylvania
and Wisconsin.
Possible Extension
Professor Chan is also working
on extending this type of training.
"There may be a good possibility
l that the government will find it
feasible and possible to extend a
similar type of scholarship pro
gram to upper division under
graduates who are prepared to
continue the study of Chinese and
Japanese," he commented.
Also toward the end of extend
ing the scope of the program, Pro
fessor Chan indicated that under
graduate Arabic classes are being
offered through the Department
of Asian Languages.

sities of Michigan, Pennsylvania
and Wisconsin.
Possible Extension
Professor Chan is also working
on extending this type of training.
"There may be a good possibility
l that the government will find it
feasible and possible to extend a
similar type of scholarship pro
gram to upper division under
graduates who are prepared to
continue the study of Chinese and
Japanese," he commented.
Also toward the end of extend
ing the scope of the program, Pro
fessor Chan indicated that under
graduate Arabic classes are being
offered through the Department
of Asian Languages.
j A center for training teachers of
Chinese and Japanese languages
has been established at Stanford
in line with recent attempts to im
plement the National Defense Ed
ucation Act of 1958.
One of 14 universities named
as centers for "critical" languages
(Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi,
Portuguese and Russian), Stan
ford has been enlisted to help
train the necessary personnel to
extend the knowledge and use of
these languages where instruc
tion ordinarily is not easily avail
able.
At present, six persons are
studying Chinese under these gov
ernment grants and one is study
ing Japanese. All are graduate
students.
Students Participating
The Chinese scholars include
James E. Briggs, Mrs. Darlene
Goodwin, Miss Roxane Heater,
Michael McCaskey, Robert Mor
rell and Peter Rooney. The stu
dent in Japanese is Donald Gui
mary.
The grants, covering tuition,
transportation and support, in
cluding support for dependents,
range from $2000 to $5000. Stan
ford is matching the grants from
the government with donations
to the center.
Diplomatic Step
Professor Shau Wing Chan,
Head of the Asian Languages de
partment and head of the center,
remarked that the program "indi
cates that the federal government
is beginning to recognize the im
portance of these languages nor
mally not taught in American in
stitutions," and felt that increased
instruction in them is a necessary
diplomatic step.
Other Chinese and/or Japanese
language centers are located at
the University of Chicago. Har
vard, the University of Kansas
and the University of Washing
ton. Centers for the other "criti
cal" languages are at Harvard.
