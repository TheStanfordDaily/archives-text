A cium.k in student football tickets which eliminates price
hrcakdowns drew much adverse comment during ihe first day <
sales yesterday.
\\ liile some complained of the $6. 75 price for tickets to llie five
remaining Stanford home games, the main criticism was that now
I here was no way of knowing w hat to charge for a ticket if a student
wanted lo sell it.
The problem, it now appears, is something students have
brought nn themselves. Assistant Athletic Director (lliuck Taylor
told us that students in the past have sold their tickets lo outsiders
w ho then couldn't get into the game, since the\ didn't have student
body cards.
Due to numerous complaints received from victims of such
sales, student tickets have this year been designed differently from
regular tickets, and have been stripped of the price designation.
Slight In higher prices have resulted from an equalization of
admission costs lo students. Tickets for games with all except
I S(], I (II.A and California now cost $1. HiGame tickets remain
at S2. A previouslv-signed long-term contract with the two I ,os
Angeles schools has fixed prices at $1 .75 on a reciprocal basis.
'The decision lo eliminate free-to-student games and to equalize
all lickt'i prices where possible was made, 'Taylor told ii*. to elimi
nate had feeling which had crept up among schools during the ne
gotiating of game contracts.
There will naturally he little enthusiasm about having to pay
for something which once was free. But in considering the price
of tickets lo outsiders, the overall costs of running the athletic pro
gram. and the fact that there is an admission charge to most other
"big-liiue*' student events, the move can't he called entirely un
just i lied.
