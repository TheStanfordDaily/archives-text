Now that the public appear
ances of Mr. K's tour are over,
we can breathe more easily.
There were great risks in send
ing the leading Communist of the
world into our crowded cities, and
if the security measures to pro
tect him look excessive, we must
remember that it is better to have
been safe than sorry.
There have been some embar
rassing incidents. These were
bound to happen once both gov
ernments accepted the half-baked
idea that the great issues which
divide us can be dealt with by
tace-to-face catch-as-catch-can en
counters.
Mr. K. does seem to have
embarked on the .journey with
the odd notion that he could al
ter American policy by haran
guing the people. The Presi
dent seems to have toyed with
the idea that a sightseeing tour
of the United States might
make a new man of Mr. K.
The rough passages were to be
expected as long as the trip was
regarded as an exercise in mu
tual conversion and seduction.
But these incidents are not likely
to have any lasting importance,
and there is certainly no reason
to think that what Mr. K. and the
President have to say to one an
other has been altered in any
significant way.
Neither can follow his personal
feelings. The President is con
lined within the limits of tlie
Western alliance and of the long
established positions of the United
States government. Mr. K., for
all of his being a dictator, is con
fined within the limits of the
massive Soviet system and of its
alliances.
Although Mr. K. rebuffed the
heckling about Hungary, about
censorship, and about other
dark spots in his regime, it
must be said, I believe, that on
the basic theme of his visit he
has been straight-forward. He
has not glossed over, indeed he
has emphasized, the fact that
the two social orders are rivals.
He has insisted, of course, that

the Soviets will win the competi
tion. But ho has admitted frankly
that it will take years of very
hard effort to catch up with us
and to surpass us. This was an
admission, indeed it was an argu
ment, that the Soviet Union must
have peace for many years to
come.
There is no way of telling now
whether he communicated this
message to the multitudes who
saw and heard on television. But
there is little doubt that he has
been understood by the United
States government which, as a
matter of fact, has for some con
siderable time realized the Soviet
need for peace and Mr. K.'s in
tention to avoid war.
In fact, the President would
not have invited Mr. K. to come
to Washington had he not been
certain that the Soviet Union
and Mr. K. want to avoid war,
to avoid it, not because they
love us but because they them
selves need years of peace in
order to do what they have set
themselves to do.
This was the crucial point. It
has injected an element of sin
cerity and credibility into Mr. K.'s
persistent appeals for peace. If
this crucial point is true, it marks
the radical difference between the
totalitarianism of the Soviet
Union today and the totalitarian
ism of Germany under the Nazis.
For Hitler's goals could be
achieved only by military con
quest. The Soviet goals in the
era over which Mr. K. presides
cannot be achieved, indeed they
would be utterly impossible, if
there were war.
We cannot afford to be dis
tracted and diverted from the
main purpose of the exchange of
visits by the trivialities and the
irrelevancies of the pitter-patter
of the propagandists and of the
exhibitionists. We had need to
talk with Mr. K. and he had need
to talk with us. For while our
conflict is irreconcilable in this
generation, both of us know that
it cannot be settled by arms.

Now that the public appear
ances of Mr. K's tour are over,
we can breathe more easily.
There were great risks in send
ing the leading Communist of the
world into our crowded cities, and
if the security measures to pro
tect him look excessive, we must
remember that it is better to have
been safe than sorry.
There have been some embar
rassing incidents. These were
bound to happen once both gov
ernments accepted the half-baked
idea that the great issues which
divide us can be dealt with by
tace-to-face catch-as-catch-can en
counters.
Mr. K. does seem to have
embarked on the .journey with
the odd notion that he could al
ter American policy by haran
guing the people. The Presi
dent seems to have toyed with
the idea that a sightseeing tour
of the United States might
make a new man of Mr. K.
The rough passages were to be
expected as long as the trip was
regarded as an exercise in mu
tual conversion and seduction.
But these incidents are not likely
to have any lasting importance,
and there is certainly no reason
to think that what Mr. K. and the
President have to say to one an
other has been altered in any
significant way.
Neither can follow his personal
feelings. The President is con
lined within the limits of tlie
Western alliance and of the long
established positions of the United
States government. Mr. K., for
all of his being a dictator, is con
fined within the limits of the
massive Soviet system and of its
alliances.
Although Mr. K. rebuffed the
heckling about Hungary, about
censorship, and about other
dark spots in his regime, it
must be said, I believe, that on
the basic theme of his visit he
has been straight-forward. He
has not glossed over, indeed he
has emphasized, the fact that
the two social orders are rivals.
He has insisted, of course, that

the Soviets will win the competi
tion. But ho has admitted frankly
that it will take years of very
hard effort to catch up with us
and to surpass us. This was an
admission, indeed it was an argu
ment, that the Soviet Union must
have peace for many years to
come.
There is no way of telling now
whether he communicated this
message to the multitudes who
saw and heard on television. But
there is little doubt that he has
been understood by the United
States government which, as a
matter of fact, has for some con
siderable time realized the Soviet
need for peace and Mr. K.'s in
tention to avoid war.
In fact, the President would
not have invited Mr. K. to come
to Washington had he not been
certain that the Soviet Union
and Mr. K. want to avoid war,
to avoid it, not because they
love us but because they them
selves need years of peace in
order to do what they have set
themselves to do.
This was the crucial point. It
has injected an element of sin
cerity and credibility into Mr. K.'s
persistent appeals for peace. If
this crucial point is true, it marks
the radical difference between the
totalitarianism of the Soviet
Union today and the totalitarian
ism of Germany under the Nazis.
For Hitler's goals could be
achieved only by military con
quest. The Soviet goals in the
era over which Mr. K. presides
cannot be achieved, indeed they
would be utterly impossible, if
there were war.
We cannot afford to be dis
tracted and diverted from the
main purpose of the exchange of
visits by the trivialities and the
irrelevancies of the pitter-patter
of the propagandists and of the
exhibitionists. We had need to
talk with Mr. K. and he had need
to talk with us. For while our
conflict is irreconcilable in this
generation, both of us know that
it cannot be settled by arms.

Now that the public appear
ances of Mr. K's tour are over,
we can breathe more easily.
There were great risks in send
ing the leading Communist of the
world into our crowded cities, and
if the security measures to pro
tect him look excessive, we must
remember that it is better to have
been safe than sorry.
There have been some embar
rassing incidents. These were
bound to happen once both gov
ernments accepted the half-baked
idea that the great issues which
divide us can be dealt with by
tace-to-face catch-as-catch-can en
counters.
Mr. K. does seem to have
embarked on the .journey with
the odd notion that he could al
ter American policy by haran
guing the people. The Presi
dent seems to have toyed with
the idea that a sightseeing tour
of the United States might
make a new man of Mr. K.
The rough passages were to be
expected as long as the trip was
regarded as an exercise in mu
tual conversion and seduction.
But these incidents are not likely
to have any lasting importance,
and there is certainly no reason
to think that what Mr. K. and the
President have to say to one an
other has been altered in any
significant way.
Neither can follow his personal
feelings. The President is con
lined within the limits of tlie
Western alliance and of the long
established positions of the United
States government. Mr. K., for
all of his being a dictator, is con
fined within the limits of the
massive Soviet system and of its
alliances.
Although Mr. K. rebuffed the
heckling about Hungary, about
censorship, and about other
dark spots in his regime, it
must be said, I believe, that on
the basic theme of his visit he
has been straight-forward. He
has not glossed over, indeed he
has emphasized, the fact that
the two social orders are rivals.
He has insisted, of course, that

the Soviets will win the competi
tion. But ho has admitted frankly
that it will take years of very
hard effort to catch up with us
and to surpass us. This was an
admission, indeed it was an argu
ment, that the Soviet Union must
have peace for many years to
come.
There is no way of telling now
whether he communicated this
message to the multitudes who
saw and heard on television. But
there is little doubt that he has
been understood by the United
States government which, as a
matter of fact, has for some con
siderable time realized the Soviet
need for peace and Mr. K.'s in
tention to avoid war.
In fact, the President would
not have invited Mr. K. to come
to Washington had he not been
certain that the Soviet Union
and Mr. K. want to avoid war,
to avoid it, not because they
love us but because they them
selves need years of peace in
order to do what they have set
themselves to do.
This was the crucial point. It
has injected an element of sin
cerity and credibility into Mr. K.'s
persistent appeals for peace. If
this crucial point is true, it marks
the radical difference between the
totalitarianism of the Soviet
Union today and the totalitarian
ism of Germany under the Nazis.
For Hitler's goals could be
achieved only by military con
quest. The Soviet goals in the
era over which Mr. K. presides
cannot be achieved, indeed they
would be utterly impossible, if
there were war.
We cannot afford to be dis
tracted and diverted from the
main purpose of the exchange of
visits by the trivialities and the
irrelevancies of the pitter-patter
of the propagandists and of the
exhibitionists. We had need to
talk with Mr. K. and he had need
to talk with us. For while our
conflict is irreconcilable in this
generation, both of us know that
it cannot be settled by arms.
