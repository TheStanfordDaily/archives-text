# ON GERMAN QUESTION
## 'Talk Policy' Gets Extension 
### J.M. ROBERTS Associated Press News Analyst 
The cards are all stacked now
for new trouble between thq
people of East Germany and their
Communist rulers.
Although he specifically de
clined to put words into Hie So
viet Premier's mouth. President
Eisenhower makes it pretty clear
that Krushchev has put off into
the indefinite future any show
down over Berlin.
A year ago the Premier was
promising the East German re
gime that it would soon l>e
given control over communica
tions between the Western
powers and their occupation
forces in Berlin.
He proposed to make Berlin a
free city, cleared of Western
forces. This would have meant a
Berlin isolated within East Ger
many, subject to pressures which
would ultimately give the Com
munists control there.
The Allies steadfastly refused
to accept any such thing. They
said, in effect, they would fight
first.
Khrushchev soon began to
back down. He just wanted, he
said, to negotiate a new ar
rangement. The Allies, lie said,
should realize that it is time
for a peace treaty with East
Germany, and recognize two
German states until the situa
tion permitted the Germans
themselves to arrange unifica
tion.
The Allies wouldn't go for that,

but hopped on the negotiations
idea. They began to talk, they
have been talking ever since, and
now the chief upshot of the Ei
senhower - Khrushchev confer
ences is an agreement to continue
talking.
When the Allies adopted the
talk-talk policy it became evident
that it would lead to a four-power
summit conference, despite Am
erican, German and French reser
vations against British enthusi
asm. Now that appears to be the
next step.
In the process, the East Ger
; man regime's position was first
inflated, even to the point
where its representatives were
admitted as observers at the
; foreign ministers conference in
| Geneva. Now it has been dc

fluted to the point where nego
tiations over ils powers revert
entirely to the Kremlin.
This makes it even more clear
to the German people, East and
West, just how the East German
Communists are merely a marker
in the Soviet game.
East Germany has been petting
some share of the general pros
| perity which is sweeping Europe.
Pressures are different and less
urgent than when its people once
I attempted open revolt.
But the government has been
| undercut, and because its author
ity has not been increased, it is
; now lessened. It will now have
to adopt tactics to reassert itself,
and so will widen its differences
with a people who increasingly
doubt its potency.

free city, cleared of Western
forces. This would have meant a

should realize that it is time
