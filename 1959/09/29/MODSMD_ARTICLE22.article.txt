Season's Here
As the reg lines lengthen, cars stop streaming into The Farm
from near and far-off places, and papers begin to pile up on all the
desks, the Daily Sports staff starts another fall.season under the
leadership of sports editor, John Schwara.
This writer is typical in hoping that the summer would last and
last but now that school has begun let's get on with it—the cover
ages, comments and sticking our neck way out for a few football
predictions.
But first let's wrap up the summer with a few sad comments
about the dying San Francisco Giants. Yes, as ( hock Dressen once
said, "The (iiants is dead" and die they did as they suddenly ran
out of pitching in their disastrous series against the Los Angeles
Dodgers losing four straight and then two more against the Cubs,
fading fast out of the pennant picture and causing a lot of unhappi
ness in the lives of Bay Area fans who had confidently bragged
'about having "a line on a couple of good tickets for the Series in
Candlestick Park.
But outspoken baseball experts from Smogland had plenty to
cheer about as the Bums came on strong with Milwaukee to tie for
the title 1 . So no Series for Stanford fans unless you want to journey
to ihe Coliseum this year.

The grid picture looks pretty
good rlown on the Farm this year.
After two "moral victories" -one
and two point losses are always
classified as this, here against
tough Oregon and tougher Wis
consin, it looks like Stanford root
ers will have something to yell
about this year. The rather in
experienced, inner line of the
Tribe picked as a definite ques
tion mark preseason—has cer
tainly jelled and looked real good •
against the bigger, experienced i
Wisconsin linemen in the 14-16 t
defeat last Saturday.
Dick Norman's thrilling pass- j
ing to Chris Burford, Ben Robin
son, Irv Nikolai, and Dick Bowers
has proven every bit as effective
as some optimistic preseason re
ports stated.
Now a few comments about
last Saturday's gamp . . . Most
spectators and writers agreed
that the Indians from Palo Alto
looked pretty nervous in that

first half at Madison. They lost
the hall as the result of fumbles and cosily interceptions in the open
ing stan/.a at several inopportune occasions and at the end of the
half were clown 9-0.
Cards Come Back
However, that strong second half passing attack of Dick Nor
man's to sticky-fingered receivers Robinson, Bnrford, Nikolai and
Bowers plus the aggressive line play of the interior linemen in the
driving rain almost gave the Cards a victory.
Line Coach Andy Everest was very pleased with his boys' show
ing especially that of guards Larry Laeey, Don Peter, and Tom
Walsh. He admitted they seemed edgy the first half but said I hat
Walsh, a sophomore filling in for Ron Fernandes—out with injured
knee, Laeey, Gary Pike, who filled tackle Hinshaw's shoes, and I'hil
Burkiand all showed good team play and their only problem seemed
in too eager pursuit as the Badgers made I heir yardages cutting
hack against the charging Indians.
Everest also believes that ihe Cards will stay with their two
platoon system as he states that all the coaches were pleased with
both teams' performances to date.
Cal Has Problems
A look around the Coast. Over at Berkeley it was another story.
Sportswriters and coaches had tried to bill the Cal-lowa grid contest
;t,s a close, hard fought rematch with Cal trying to grab a revenge
win over the Ha\ykeyes.
However Ihe Golden Bears, after scoring quickly against the
Hawkeyes found that they had quarterback problems, pass defense
problems, and just plain couldn't stop the lowan's winged T attack
led by Bob Jeter and Dick Horn. The Brnins climaxed a festive
football week by losing to lowa 42-12 and lowa became a definite
threat for a return hid for the Big Ten tille.
Down South Use whipped I'itt 23 to 0 and once again proved
that they are the team to beat here on the Coast this year. The
Trojans suffered one big setback in losing the services of quarter
back Willie Wood with a shoulder injury for, quite possibly, the
rest of Ihe season.
Elsewhere, Washington still is winning—defeating Idaho 23-0;
Oregon over Utah 21-0; WSU defeated San Jose 30-6 and Oregon State
lost to Texas Tech 14-15 to round out the Coast action.

the title 1 . So no Series for Stanford fans unless you want to journey
to ihe Coliseum this year.

The grid picture looks pretty
good rlown on the Farm this year.
After two "moral victories" -one
and two point losses are always
classified as this, here against
tough Oregon and tougher Wis
consin, it looks like Stanford root
ers will have something to yell
about this year. The rather in
experienced, inner line of the
Tribe picked as a definite ques
tion mark preseason—has cer
tainly jelled and looked real good •
against the bigger, experienced i
Wisconsin linemen in the 14-16 t
defeat last Saturday.
Dick Norman's thrilling pass- j
ing to Chris Burford, Ben Robin
son, Irv Nikolai, and Dick Bowers
has proven every bit as effective
as some optimistic preseason re
ports stated.
Now a few comments about
last Saturday's gamp . . . Most
spectators and writers agreed
that the Indians from Palo Alto
looked pretty nervous in that

first half at Madison. They lost
the hall as the result of fumbles and cosily interceptions in the open
ing stan/.a at several inopportune occasions and at the end of the
half were clown 9-0.
Cards Come Back
However, that strong second half passing attack of Dick Nor
man's to sticky-fingered receivers Robinson, Bnrford, Nikolai and
Bowers plus the aggressive line play of the interior linemen in the
driving rain almost gave the Cards a victory.
Line Coach Andy Everest was very pleased with his boys' show
ing especially that of guards Larry Laeey, Don Peter, and Tom
Walsh. He admitted they seemed edgy the first half but said I hat
Walsh, a sophomore filling in for Ron Fernandes—out with injured
knee, Laeey, Gary Pike, who filled tackle Hinshaw's shoes, and I'hil
Burkiand all showed good team play and their only problem seemed
in too eager pursuit as the Badgers made I heir yardages cutting
hack against the charging Indians.
Everest also believes that ihe Cards will stay with their two
platoon system as he states that all the coaches were pleased with
both teams' performances to date.
Cal Has Problems
A look around the Coast. Over at Berkeley it was another story.
Sportswriters and coaches had tried to bill the Cal-lowa grid contest
;t,s a close, hard fought rematch with Cal trying to grab a revenge
win over the Ha\ykeyes.
However Ihe Golden Bears, after scoring quickly against the
Hawkeyes found that they had quarterback problems, pass defense
problems, and just plain couldn't stop the lowan's winged T attack
led by Bob Jeter and Dick Horn. The Brnins climaxed a festive
football week by losing to lowa 42-12 and lowa became a definite
threat for a return hid for the Big Ten tille.
Down South Use whipped I'itt 23 to 0 and once again proved
that they are the team to beat here on the Coast this year. The
Trojans suffered one big setback in losing the services of quarter
back Willie Wood with a shoulder injury for, quite possibly, the
rest of Ihe season.
Elsewhere, Washington still is winning—defeating Idaho 23-0;
Oregon over Utah 21-0; WSU defeated San Jose 30-6 and Oregon State
lost to Texas Tech 14-15 to round out the Coast action.


ANDY EVEREST
His Line Looked Good
Season's Here
As the reg lines lengthen, cars stop streaming into The Farm
from near and far-off places, and papers begin to pile up on all the
desks, the Daily Sports staff starts another fall.season under the
leadership of sports editor, John Schwara.
This writer is typical in hoping that the summer would last and
last but now that school has begun let's get on with it—the cover
ages, comments and sticking our neck way out for a few football
predictions.
But first let's wrap up the summer with a few sad comments
about the dying San Francisco Giants. Yes, as ( hock Dressen once
said, "The (iiants is dead" and die they did as they suddenly ran
out of pitching in their disastrous series against the Los Angeles
Dodgers losing four straight and then two more against the Cubs,
fading fast out of the pennant picture and causing a lot of unhappi
ness in the lives of Bay Area fans who had confidently bragged
'about having "a line on a couple of good tickets for the Series in

ing stan/.a at several inopportune occasions and at the end of the
half were clown 9-0.
Cards Come Back
However, that strong second half passing attack of Dick Nor
man's to sticky-fingered receivers Robinson, Bnrford, Nikolai and
Bowers plus the aggressive line play of the interior linemen in the
driving rain almost gave the Cards a victory.
Line Coach Andy Everest was very pleased with his boys' show
ing especially that of guards Larry Laeey, Don Peter, and Tom
Walsh. He admitted they seemed edgy the first half but said I hat
Walsh, a sophomore filling in for Ron Fernandes—out with injured
knee, Laeey, Gary Pike, who filled tackle Hinshaw's shoes, and I'hil
Burkiand all showed good team play and their only problem seemed
in too eager pursuit as the Badgers made I heir yardages cutting
hack against the charging Indians.
Everest also believes that ihe Cards will stay with their two
platoon system as he states that all the coaches were pleased with
both teams' performances to date.
Cal Has Problems
A look around the Coast. Over at Berkeley it was another story.
Sportswriters and coaches had tried to bill the Cal-lowa grid contest
;t,s a close, hard fought rematch with Cal trying to grab a revenge
win over the Ha\ykeyes.
However Ihe Golden Bears, after scoring quickly against the
Hawkeyes found that they had quarterback problems, pass defense
problems, and just plain couldn't stop the lowan's winged T attack
led by Bob Jeter and Dick Horn. The Brnins climaxed a festive
football week by losing to lowa 42-12 and lowa became a definite
threat for a return hid for the Big Ten tille.
Down South Use whipped I'itt 23 to 0 and once again proved
that they are the team to beat here on the Coast this year. The
Trojans suffered one big setback in losing the services of quarter
back Willie Wood with a shoulder injury for, quite possibly, the
rest of Ihe season.
Elsewhere, Washington still is winning—defeating Idaho 23-0;
Oregon over Utah 21-0; WSU defeated San Jose 30-6 and Oregon State
lost to Texas Tech 14-15 to round out the Coast action.


ANDY EVEREST
His Line Looked Good
Season's Here
As the reg lines lengthen, cars stop streaming into The Farm
from near and far-off places, and papers begin to pile up on all the
desks, the Daily Sports staff starts another fall.season under the
leadership of sports editor, John Schwara.
This writer is typical in hoping that the summer would last and
last but now that school has begun let's get on with it—the cover
ages, comments and sticking our neck way out for a few football
predictions.
But first let's wrap up the summer with a few sad comments
about the dying San Francisco Giants. Yes, as ( hock Dressen once
said, "The (iiants is dead" and die they did as they suddenly ran
out of pitching in their disastrous series against the Los Angeles
Dodgers losing four straight and then two more against the Cubs,
fading fast out of the pennant picture and causing a lot of unhappi
ness in the lives of Bay Area fans who had confidently bragged
'about having "a line on a couple of good tickets for the Series in
Candlestick Park.
But outspoken baseball experts from Smogland had plenty to
cheer about as the Bums came on strong with Milwaukee to tie for
the title 1 . So no Series for Stanford fans unless you want to journey
to ihe Coliseum this year.

The grid picture looks pretty
good rlown on the Farm this year.
After two "moral victories" -one
and two point losses are always
classified as this, here against
tough Oregon and tougher Wis
consin, it looks like Stanford root
ers will have something to yell
about this year. The rather in
experienced, inner line of the
Tribe picked as a definite ques
tion mark preseason—has cer
tainly jelled and looked real good •
against the bigger, experienced i
Wisconsin linemen in the 14-16 t
defeat last Saturday.
Dick Norman's thrilling pass- j
ing to Chris Burford, Ben Robin
son, Irv Nikolai, and Dick Bowers
has proven every bit as effective
as some optimistic preseason re
ports stated.
Now a few comments about
last Saturday's gamp . . . Most
spectators and writers agreed
that the Indians from Palo Alto
looked pretty nervous in that

first half at Madison. They lost
the hall as the result of fumbles and cosily interceptions in the open
ing stan/.a at several inopportune occasions and at the end of the
half were clown 9-0.
