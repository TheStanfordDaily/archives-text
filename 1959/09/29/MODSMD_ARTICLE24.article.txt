# Team Managers Are Needed
## 
### 
Both the varsity and freshman
football teams need managers.
Anyone interested in managing
either team should see Senior
Manager Jerry Otehis any day
this week between 3:30 and 4:30
p.m. at the BAC.
The frosh baseball squad has
also put out the call for mana
gers. Interested freshmen should
call Howell Lovell at DA 3-59915
or see Coach Mickey Holzman in
room 17 of the BAC.
