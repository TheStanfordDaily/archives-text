SAN FRANCISCO
ford's Jack Curtice believes his
football teams have sei some sort
of record. They've lost the last
three games by a combined total
of four points.
Thai includes the finale of last
year when t lie Indians were
edged by California 16-15. In the
first two of 1959, they lost to
Oregon 2S-27 and Wisconsin 1(5-14.
Cactus Jack aims for the vic
tory column this week when his
Indians host the College of Pa
cific Tigers Saturday.
Improve the Defense
"We're showing a little run
ning, we know we can pass and
we're trying to improve our de
fense," Curtice told the Northern
California Football Writers and
Broadcasters Assn. "COP will be
looking forward to trimming us.
They polished off Cal last year
and would like to have an Indian
scalp. We'll see if we can hold
up against the best back in the
country in that boy Bass."
Coach Jack Myers of COP said
that, after a week's rest, his ace
halfback Dick Bass will be able
to go against Stanford. Bass suf
fered a muscle pull in pre-season
drills and saw little action in the
COP opener.
Curtice said Wisconsin was
fortunate to have the place kick
ing opportunity in the first half
at Madison when the Badgers
kicked the three-pointer. "In the
second half rainstorm," he de
clared. "a catfish might have
made it between the goal posts
but a football would never have
made it."
Great Passing Show
Si ill quarterback Dick Norman
put on a great passing show, once
throwing left handed and once
with both hands, as Stanford ral
lied for its two touchdowns.
California Coach Pete Elliott,
whose Bears travel to Austin and
a televised game with Texas,
said lowa took advantage of every
mistake his team made in taking
the 42-12 victory.
"But." he added, "I feel after
watching the pictures that our
squad played harder and better
than we'd thought at the time. I
thought tackle Frank Sally play
ed awfully well as did the quar
terbacks Wayne Crow and Larry
Parque. Bob Wills played his
best game so far."
SJS vs. Hawaii
Coach . Bob Titchenal of San
Jose State will guard against a
repetition of last year when ihe
University of Hawaii upset his
Spartans 8-6.

"We'll show our boys the films 1
of last year's game two or three |
times this week," Titchenal de-1
dared.
The Rainbows of Hawaii are
coached by his former college
roommate, Henry Vasconeellos.
