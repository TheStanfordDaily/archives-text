# Bums Eke Out 1st Playoff Win
## 
### 
MILWAUKEE (A 3 ) â€” Young
Larry Sherry's brilliant relief
pitching and John Roseboro's
sixth inning home run gave the
aroused Los Angeles Dodgers a
3-2 victory over Milwaukee Mon
day in the opener of a best-of
three playoff series for the Na
tional League pennant.
The series will continue Tues
day in the vast Los Angeles Coli
seum with the Dodgers' Don
Drysdale 17-13 trying to close it
out in two straight. Lew Bur
dene 21 15 will work for the
Braves. Game time is 4 p.m. EST.
Sherry, a 24-year-old right
hander from Los Angeles, came
to the rescue of wild Danny Me-
Devitt. the Dodger starter, in the
second inning. Working with the
coolness of a veteran, the young
man who was brought up from
St. Paul in early July allowed
only 4 hits in the last 7 2-3 score
less innings.
Roseboro Homers
All this fine pitching in rain,
fog and heavy dew would have
been wasted if Roseboro hadn't
slammed a 2-1 pitch by Carlton
Willey over the right field fence
for his 10th home run as he lead
off the sixth. The blow by the
Dodger catcher, who is doing a
man-sized job of trying lo fill the
ample shoes of Roy Campanella,
fell five rows into the bleachers,
about 375 feet from home plate.
Neal and Larker each had three
of the 10 Dodger hits off Willey
and relief man Don MeMahon
who pitched the last three inn
ings.
Roseboro's homer was the only
extra base blow of the soggy
afternoon.
It looked for a long time as

though the game never would get
started. Ten minutes before game
time, it started to rain, gently at
first and then harder and harder.
The ground crew pulled the tar
paulin over the infield while the
players sat down on the bench
to wait it out.
Finally the rain let up and the
umpires came out with President
Warren Giles of the league to
confer with the opposing mana
gers. After a long discussion
they ordered the rover off and
the warmups started. The game
got under way 47 minutes late.
Ii was played under lights from
the very .start. In the late inn
ings a fog rolled in. Roth teams
played remarkably good ball un
der the circumstances but it was
not one of those thrillers you will
retell to your grandchildren.
Better Than Brooklyn
The Dodgers, Los Angeles va
riety, did belter than the old
Brooklyn brand ever did in the
first game of the playoff. The
Brooks lost in two straight to St.
Louis in 1940 and dropped the
first to the Giants in
1951 before finally being knocked
out in the third game by Bobby
Thomson's "miracle" homer.
Now they go home to a tu
multous greeting at the big Coli
seum with its 250-foot left field
fence where the final game or
games will be played Tuesday and
Wednesday.
And they did it without their
best hitter. Duke Snider, who was
on the bench with a damaged
knee. He was available only for
pinch hitting duty if needed.
