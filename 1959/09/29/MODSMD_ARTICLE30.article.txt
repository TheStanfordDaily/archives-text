ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER DOLLAR
Today T begin my sixth 3'onr of writing this column for the
nwikers of l'liilip Morris and Marlboro Cigarettes. For this I
get money.
Not, lot mo hasten to state, that payment is necessary, "Sirs,"
T said :i few days ago to the makers of Philip Morris and Marl
boro, "if I can introduce America's college men and women to
l'hilip Morris and Marlboro, and thus enhance their happiness,
heighten their zest, upgrade their gusto, magnify their cheer,
and broaden their bliss, there is no need to pay me because 1 am
more than amply rewarded."
We wept then. I'm not ashamed to say it. WE WEPT! I
wish the wiseacres who say big business is cold and heartless
could have been there that day. I wish they could have seen
the great, shimmering tears that splashed on the board room
table. Wo wept, every man jack of us. The makers wept—the
secretaries wept— I wept—my agent, Clyde C!reedy, wept. We
wept all.
."No, no!" cried the makers, ."We insist on paying you.'J

"Oli, very well," T said, and the gloom passed liko a sum in or
shower. We lauded and we lit, Philip Morrises and Marlboros—
and some of us lit Alpines—which is a brand-new cigarette from
the makers of Philip Morris and Marlboro—a fine new cigarette
with a light touch of menthol and the rich taste of choice tobaccos
and the longest filter yet devised. And if you are oue who likes
a fine new cigarette with a light touch of menthol and the rich
taste of choice tobaccos and the longest, filter yet devised, you
would do well to ask for new king-size Alpines. If, on the other
hand, you do not like menthol but do like better makin's and
a filter that does what it's built for, for Marlboro. Or, if you
don't like filters at all, but only mildness, ask for Philip Morris.
Any way you play it, you're a winner.
But I digress. "Will you," said the makers of Philip Morris,
Marlboro and Alpine, "write about the important issues that
occupy the supple young minds of college America tliis year in
your column?"
"But of course," I replied, with a kindly chuckle.
"And w ill you, ' asked the makers, "from time to time say a
pleasant word about Philip Morris, Marlboro and Alpine?''
"Crazy kids!" 1 said with a wry grin, pushing my fit
gently against their jaws. "You know I will."
And we all shook hands- silently, firmly, manlilv. And I left,
dabbing my eyes with my agent, and hurried to the neare t
typewriter. * itMMnmninna

ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER DOLLAR
Today T begin my sixth 3'onr of writing this column for the
nwikers of l'liilip Morris and Marlboro Cigarettes. For this I
get money.
Not, lot mo hasten to state, that payment is necessary, "Sirs,"
T said :i few days ago to the makers of Philip Morris and Marl
boro, "if I can introduce America's college men and women to
l'hilip Morris and Marlboro, and thus enhance their happiness,
heighten their zest, upgrade their gusto, magnify their cheer,
and broaden their bliss, there is no need to pay me because 1 am
more than amply rewarded."
We wept then. I'm not ashamed to say it. WE WEPT! I
wish the wiseacres who say big business is cold and heartless
could have been there that day. I wish they could have seen
the great, shimmering tears that splashed on the board room
table. Wo wept, every man jack of us. The makers wept—the
secretaries wept— I wept—my agent, Clyde C!reedy, wept. We
wept all.
."No, no!" cried the makers, ."We insist on paying you.'J

"Oli, very well," T said, and the gloom passed liko a sum in or
shower. We lauded and we lit, Philip Morrises and Marlboros—
and some of us lit Alpines—which is a brand-new cigarette from
the makers of Philip Morris and Marlboro—a fine new cigarette
with a light touch of menthol and the rich taste of choice tobaccos
and the longest filter yet devised. And if you are oue who likes
a fine new cigarette with a light touch of menthol and the rich
taste of choice tobaccos and the longest, filter yet devised, you
would do well to ask for new king-size Alpines. If, on the other
hand, you do not like menthol but do like better makin's and
a filter that does what it's built for, for Marlboro. Or, if you
don't like filters at all, but only mildness, ask for Philip Morris.
Any way you play it, you're a winner.
But I digress. "Will you," said the makers of Philip Morris,
Marlboro and Alpine, "write about the important issues that
occupy the supple young minds of college America tliis year in
your column?"
"But of course," I replied, with a kindly chuckle.
"And w ill you, ' asked the makers, "from time to time say a
pleasant word about Philip Morris, Marlboro and Alpine?''
"Crazy kids!" 1 said with a wry grin, pushing my fit
gently against their jaws. "You know I will."
And we all shook hands- silently, firmly, manlilv. And I left,
dabbing my eyes with my agent, and hurried to the neare t
