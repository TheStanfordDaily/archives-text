# CLOSER TO EARTH
## New Band of Radiation Found by Explorer VI 
### 
WASHINGTON (JP)—'The U.S. Paddle Wheel satellite has found
a third, and previously undetected, band of intense and deadly radia
tion around the earth. It could mean added danger for the first man
into space.
The discovery of this new 310-mile-wide radiation band, starting

about 1,000 miles from earth, was
announced yesterday by the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration.
Van Allen Bands
Earlier U.S. space vehicles had j
detected two doughnut-shaped
bands of radiation—one extend
ing between 1,400 miles and 3,400
miles from earth, the other start
ing at about 8.000 miles and
These are called the Van Allen
bands, for Dr. James Van Allen,
a physicist at the University of
lowa.
Up to now, these two bands
were rated the two greatest
known hazards to manned space
flight. The new and closer-in
band forms another possible bar
rier.

At a news conference, NASA
scientists also disclosed that, a
two-pound camera-type device
aboard the satellite had taken the
first crude picture of the earth
and its cloud cover from a point
19.500 miles out in space. The
picture was radioed back to earth.
Explorer VI, launched at Cape
Canaveral, Fla., on Aug. 7, is ex
pected to stay aloft for about two
years. It is circling the earth
once every 12Ms hours in an orbit
ranging from a peak altitude of
26.000 miles to a low point 156
miles from the earth.
