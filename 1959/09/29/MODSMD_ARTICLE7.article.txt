# Explorer's Radio Designed at RPL
## 
### 
Explorer Vl's miniature radio
receiver was designed and built
by two Stanford graduate stu
dents. Louis H. Rorden and Rob
ert N. Beattie.
The receiver was developed in
order to test a.theory proposed
by Dr. Robert A. Helliwell, a
member of the Radio Propagation
Lab. Helliwell suggested that ion
ization in outer space forms ir
regular patterns instead of .being
evenly distributed as was for
merly thought. If proved to exist,
these formations would explain
many strange radio effects.
