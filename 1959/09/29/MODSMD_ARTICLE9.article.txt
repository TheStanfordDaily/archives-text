# Today--A Change for Frosh
## 
### 
A memo to all freshmen
Would you like to attend an
open house at which there will
be no members of the rally com,
co-rec com, jolly-up com, or pom
pon com?
How about an open house
which will have no speeches,
question and answer sessions,
professors, sponsors, or student
body presidents?
Possibly you would enjoy at
tending a function at which few
lists must be signed, no money
will be asked of you, and no lines*
must be stood in.
Perhaps you would find it re
freshing to attend an open house
at which few hands will be sha
ken and no refreshments will be
served.
Then today's open house at the
Daily shack between 3 and 9 is
for you. Here you will do nothing
more than meet the kind, friend
ly. and congenial people who put
out Stanford's answer to the
Christian Science Monitor.
Here you will see how YOU can
fit into the publication of the
Dally.
Activity credit is given for the
minute sacrifice of only three
hours of your idle time per week
which you can spend in such
glorious past times as covering
fascinating news events and re
writing the deathless prose turn
ed in by other Daily reporters.
