As MOST of us trudge toward the main quad today to start
clashes for the 1959â€”1960 school year, a much more momentous,
though similar, happening is also taking place close hy.
l odav, 011 a corner of this campus, medical students in the Uni
versity School of Medicine, a part of the beautiful $22 million Stan
lord Medical Center, embark upon a new curriculum for educa
tion in medicine.
"The five-year plan," as it is called, has been designed hv the
Medical School's leading educators in an attempt to educate the
"whole'" doctor to understand the "whole patient.
In short, these educators have spotted the dangers present in a
world of people d;tilv growing smaller of mind through intensive
specialized study. They aim to make the doctors of the future
thinking, knowledgeful men ahlc to understand the patient not
only as a disease, hut also as a person amidst an environment.
It is more than fitting that for such a distinctive and provocative
curriculum departure an equally distinctive, beautiful and pro
vocative building should be ready to house these studies.
The eyes of a great many of the most intelligent men of our
nation, in medicine and in every other walk of life, will lie Incus
ing on Stanford and its new plan in the years to come.
Many of these men are critical, many more skeptical, but it ap
pears that all are hopeful that the results v\ill be positive ones.
Today The Daily salutes Dean Hobert 11. Alwav ami the Stan
ford School of Medicine with the hope that this and the years to
eonie will prove the merits of the new education plan.
