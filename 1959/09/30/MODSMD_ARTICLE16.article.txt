# Rx Apathy Antidotes
## 
### Mary Lou McKinley 
Antidote, n. Whatever tends
to counteract evil that some
thing else might produce.
(Webster's)
Now it's not the purpose of this
column to decry apathy as an evil.
Live and let live, as Dionysus
said, surrounding himself with
the prettiest goddesses, the choic
est epicurean delights and the
best, and most exclusive entertain
ment available in those days.
But for those of you who are
bored, dissatisfied and have blank
space looking at you from the so
cial calendar, this column will
try each week to present, means
for offsetting and preventing
these dulling effects.
One of the surest and closest
connteractants against social
apathy is to be found at 642
High Street on the second floor
of the Zack Building here in
Palo Alto. Newly opened on
Aug. 7, "Outside at the Inside"
combines coffee house-left bank
atmosphere with nite club en
tertainment and red plush car
pets to produce a relaxing and
enjoyable change of scene.
Entertainment is continuous
during the evening with varied
acts highlighting different days.
Wednesday evenings "Los Fla
mencos de la Bodega" give three
shows with a cover charge of
$1.75. Thursdays at 9 p.m. and
Friday and Saturdays at 10:30 the
fee is $1 for the John Moser Trio
plus great artists, and on Sun
days the Wayfarers sing folk
songs in four evening shows for a
$ 1 cover.
There is no cover charge on
Monday and Tuesday nights,
and the entertainment is more
casual, though no less enjoy
able. A very talented young pi
anist, Eddie VVettland, appears
often, and, with bass player Bill
(iage, provided top entertain
ment last Monday night. Dick
Fregulia, class of '(>2, also per
forins frequently.
The coffee house opens at 7
p.m. each evening and also serves
lunch from 12 noon to 2 p.m. on
weekdays.
Mike DuPont, owner of "Out
side at the Inside," has filled ade
quately a need for good entertain
ment in pleasant surroundings
that is available to "under 21s"
as well as the older contingent.
There's no cause now for the "too
far away" excuse for apathy.
In fact, Palo Alto has plenty
of things to do this weekend.
At the same location of "Out
side at the Inside," The Troupe
Theater's musical revue, "Six
Appeal" is in its Ifttli week.
Shows are Friday and Saturday
at 8:80 p.m. Phone DA 1-4220

Comedia currently is present
ing two well-known comedies at

p.m., and "Where's Charley?"
will be presented Oct. 1, 2, and 3.
Reservations: DA 6-8317.
The campus itself is not void of
apathy antidotes. Sunday, actor
Vincent Price will appear at 4
p.m. in Memorial Hall for what

promises to be a very enjoyable
afternoon. He will interpret in
dramatic readings "Three Ameri
can Voices"—those of Walt Whit
man, James McNeill Whistler, and
Tennessee Williams. Student

Auditorium Box Office, which
will open at 3 p.m. Sunday.
On Oct. 7, Louis Armstrong

Auditorium with his All Stars.
Those of us who saw the show
last year won't miss it next
week —and neither should any
one else. Tickets are priced at
$2.50, $3.50 and $5 for benefit
of the University's unrestricted
Scholarship Fund.
Now, for those apathy-afflicted
students with an urge—and
means—to travel, San Francisco
is filled with a variety of counter
balancing agents.
Louis Prima and Keely Smith
will appear in the Civic Audito
rium Saturday in two shows, at
8:15 and 11:30 p.m. Tickets are
available at Sherman Clay and

p.m.
Matinees are Wednesday and
Saturday at 2:30 p.m. This is a
musical well worth seeing if you
haven't already.
And as a last and certain anti
dote this week, why not drive
down to Monterey this weekend
for the largest West Coast Jazz
Festival? The three-day program
is filler! with top-rate performers,
too many to list here, and the
first show begins Friday at 8:15
p.m.
And as for me? I'll be here at
the Daily Shack (the greatest
cure ever for apathy) compiling
next week's column.

And as a last and certain anti
dote this week, why not drive

p.m.
And as for me? I'll be here at
the Daily Shack (the greatest
cure ever for apathy) compiling
next week's column.
Antidote, n. Whatever tends
to counteract evil that some
thing else might produce.
(Webster's)
Now it's not the purpose of this
column to decry apathy as an evil.
Live and let live, as Dionysus
said, surrounding himself with
the prettiest goddesses, the choic
est epicurean delights and the
best, and most exclusive entertain
ment available in those days.
But for those of you who are
bored, dissatisfied and have blank
space looking at you from the so
cial calendar, this column will
try each week to present, means
for offsetting and preventing
these dulling effects.
