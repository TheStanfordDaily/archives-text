UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (JP)
A mass Soviet block walkout in
the U.N. General Assembly Tues
day set the stage for bitter debate
on charges that Communist China
is trying to destroy the Tibetan
people's way of life.
Members of the Soviet delega
tion and its eight satellites left
the Assembly just before the
speech of T. F. Tsiang, the Na
tionalist Chinese ambassador.
"From this rostrum, as repre
sentative of China. I declare that
Free China condemns the Com
munist atrocities in Tibet and
welcomes any proposal to exam
ine them in the present session
of the Assembly," Tsiang as
serted.
The Assembly's 21-nation Steer
ing Committee was expected to
act, probably Wednesday, on the
request of Ireland and Malaya to
put the Tibetan issue before the
Assembly for full-scale debate.
Those two nations said in mak
ing the request there is "prima
facie evidence of an attempt to
destroy the traditional way of
life of the Tibetan people" and
their religious and cultural au
tonomy.
"In such circumstances," they
added, "the United Nations has
both a moral obligation and a le
gal right to discuss the situation.
"The governments concerned
further consider that this Assem
bly has a duty to call for the res
toration of the religious and civil
liberties of the people of Tibet."
The Soviet walkout indicated a
strong fight in the committee.
But Ireland and Malaya — who

have the support of the United
States — were confident they
would win enough votes to as
sure a recommendation to the
Assembly that it consider the
Tibetan issue.
Tsiang said his government
was shocked at the action of the I
Chinese Communists in sending
troops into Tibet in 1950. Red
China's actions in Tibet, he add- j
ed, "are abhorrent to the Chinese
people."
He made clear that the Chi- j
nese Nationalists would not raise
any legal objections to U.N. ac
tion on Tibet. This was of spe
cial significance since both Na
tionalist and Communist China j
claim Tibet as Chinese territory. '
