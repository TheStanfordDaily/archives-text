What's Wrong Willi Our Tackles?
The summer was hectic enough, sports-wise, and now here we are
on the first day of school with two football games already played.
No wins and two losses isn't much of an improvement over last
year, is it?
But then we all know that the .scores of last year's first two
were 40-6 and 30-7 and this year's first two were 28-27 and 16-14.
In fact, the Tribe lost last season's third game 28-0 for an impressive
three-game total of 13 points to the opponents' 98. And Stanford's
two touchdowns in those first three games were scored by tackles â€”
Phil Burklaiul on a fumble recovery against Washington State and
Troy Barbee on a tackle-eligible pass against Rice.

The tackles haven't even scored
yet this year. What's wrong?
But thank goodness we don't
have lo live in that nightmarish
past. Instead, we can look to a
promising future promising de
spite the fact that there doesn't
seem to be a single breather along
the line. Even 101 Troj might be
vulnerable without Willie Wood,
who if he hadn't got hurt last
week would have been racked up
next week or the week after.
No doubt about it. Dick Norman
is destined for great things. It
inighi as well be said now: Dick
is on his way to becoming Stan
ford's greatest all-time passer.
And, to coin a phrase; that's quite
a mouthful.
For the record, Norman has 36
completions in 53 tries for 382
yards. That percentage figures
io something around .680, which
is about fantastic. Against Ore
yon, a defensive power, and Wis
consin (the Big Ten's best?) yet.

A local commentator who's get
ling on television all the time nowadays what with the National
League play-off on the air. commented the other eve that Wisconsin
would have run Stanford out of the stadium if there hadn't been a
tornado raging during the second half.
Well, that's interesting seeing as how Stanford moves the ball
by passing and seeing as how wind and rain aren't recommended for
passing. And Wisconsin had a considerably bigger line and big lines
are supposed to do well in mud. And Wisconsin's top ground gainer
was a straight-ahead running fullback, and when it's muddy they
say straight ahead is about the only way to run
But then, this guy knows. He listened on his radio.
Football has many weeks left, though, and that's .just about all
you'll see on this page anyhow, so we might look into the past
after all.
Yankees Third? on Crazy?
Immediate past, that is. Like this summer.
What a National League race that was (is?). And just think of
all the money we cowards could have had if we had had the forti
tude to bet that the Yankees wouldn't pull out of it.
It was quite a summer for track, not so much the Pan-American
games, which were an all-American farce, but the Russia-lJ. S. meet.
A Bay Area lad named Ray Norton is beginning to look like the most
solid World's Fastest Human we've had in years. Dyrol Burleson,
who is just now starting his varsity track eligibility for Oregon,
waxed the Russians and then waxed everyone in the Pan-Am games.
What a future is unfolding for that lad.
It was a very golfy summer, too. Stanford was the scene of
the National Junior tournament. The winner of it. I.arry Lee, is
headed for Seattle U., but Stanford came up with a fair prize, too.
He's Bill Welch."
Bill lost in the first round of the Nationals here, but he won tlie
Idaho amateur title this summer <a tourney in which Lee was
ousted) and reached the semi-finals of the Washington amateur
(as did Lee). So we did pretty well, too.
And Stanford's own Anne Quast was given the honor of having
her picture on the cover of Sports Illustrated. We all know that
this is tantamount to a jinx; and, anyway, she was knocked out of
the Women's Amateur tournament after breezing through the first
rounds.
Anne, however, brightened up good ol' SI a hit and so she might
as well brighten up this column, too.
