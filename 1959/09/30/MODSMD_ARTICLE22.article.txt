## NEXT STANFORD FOE Bass Holds Key To COP Future 
### Stan Hulett 
When the College of Pacific Bengals move into Stanford Stadium
on Saturday, Indian fans will get a look at the man that many feel
is the best halfback in the United States today. Dick Bass, 190-pound
senior from Vallejo, is reported to be in. top shape after being hob
bled up with a pulled leg muscle since the start of the season.

Bass saw only limited action
against Colorado State two weeks
ago, but Bengal Coach, Moose
Myers, reports that the flashy
! halfback will be ready lo see full
duty against the Indians on Sat
j urday. With Bass at full running
strength, the Tigers could give
! the Cards a tough tussle, but the
lack of a strong line and reserves
could spell the downfall of the
: Bengals.
Injuries Hurt
COP lias been hard hurt by in
juries this season. Before the
'opening of fall practice, All-Coast
; candidate, guard Carl Kammerer
was badly hurt in a logging acci
dent and was lost for the season
; and sophomore tackle Carl Over
street, a 6-3, 230-pound tackle,
; was lost from a knee injury. Both
were expected to lie the main
| stays of the COP line, but now
Myers has his problems.
But this was not enough. Half
back Bob Cabonyog, a transfer
from Hartnell College, was lost
for the season with torn ankle
ligaments.
In the first outing for the Ben
â–  gals this season, they were
dumped by a not too strong Colo
rado Stale club, 9-6. COP had
troubles moving the ball without
the services of Bass. Their line
averaging some 210 pounds per
man is big, but lacks the real
speed lo stop a good running at
tack.
Before the opening of the sea
son this looked like it would be
the big year for the Bengals, with
18 returning letle*rmen and 23
j seniors, COP looked to be on their
way to the first real good season
since 1949, but injuries have ta
ken their toll, and the hopes have
disappeared in a maze of training
tape and gauze.
Triple Crown Winner
The Tigers were counting
very heavily on Bass, last sea
son's NCAA "Triple Crown"
(rushing, total offense and scor
ing! winner. The Pacificites felt
| they were on their way, but in
jury to (lie leg of the All-Ameri
ean halfback has slowed him con
siderably. But should Bass come
around in the near future, the
Bengals coidd indeed have the
fine season they hoped for.
Their big problem this week
end will be to cope with the great
Stanford passing attack, led by

[ Dick Norman. COP is not noted
! for a strong pass defense and this
could prove to be the undoing of
Ihe men from Stockton Saturday
when ihey do battle with the In
dians in Stanford Stadium.


SPKEDY DICK BASS
Triple Crown Winner
