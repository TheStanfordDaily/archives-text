SAN FRANCISCO (JP) South
ern California's Mike McKeever
is lineman-of-the-week in the Far
West Five.
The 215-pound junior guard was
a defensive standout in the Tro
jans' 23-0 victory over Pittsburgh
and has been a major reason USC
has yielded but one tally in two
games.
Earlier, the FWF, known offi
cially as the Athletic Association
of Western Universities, chose
Stanford quarterback Dick Nor
man as its back of the week off
his showing against Wisconsin.
