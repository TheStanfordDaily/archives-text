# Families Move Into Escondido
## 
### 
The first families have moved
into Escondido Village, Stan
ford's new $3 million campus de
velopment for married students.
The 250 apartments in the 175-
acre development are being
turned over to waiting families
as fast as they are ready. The
entire project was scheduled for
completion Monday, Sept. 28.
There were 538 applications on
hand last June for the drawing
that selected the first occupants
of Escondido Village. Most of the
"losers" went on the waiting list,
which now stands at 250.
Wooded Section
The 54 one- and two-story
I buildings are widely spread in a
I random arrangement in a wooded
section of the campus along Stan
ford Avenue between El Carnino
i Real and Escondido Road. Green
belts 200 feet wide are being
planted between the Village and
neighboring streets.
Archite' ;s Wurster, Bernardi
& Emmons of San Francisco de
vised seven different floor plans,
divided into 56 one-bedroom, 140
two-bedroom, and 54 three-bed
room apartments. Both one- and
two-bedroom apartments offer
upstairs bedrooms in an open
balcony arrangement. Some of
the three-bedroom units have a
covered patio.
Ranch Houses
As part of the effort to avoid
| the "institutional" feeling in the
new community, the buildings
are an adaptation of the long, low
lines of early California ranch
houses, with low-pitched shingle
roofs and wide eaves. Exteriors
are combinations of driftwood
grey finish board-and-batten red
wood, cement bricks, and asbes
tos siding highlighted by trim in
soft contrasting colors.
Monthly rentals, which include
furniture, kitchen appliances, and
all utilities, are $85 for a one
bedroom unit, $95 for two bed
rooms, and $105 for three bed
rooms. The project was financed
by the Federal Housing and Home
Finance Agency, and rental rates
were set no higher than neces
sary to cover loan repayments
| and maintenance.
