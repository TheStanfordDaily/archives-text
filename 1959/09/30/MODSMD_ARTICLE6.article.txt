# IKE ENTERS TALKS
## Government to Act Soon In 77-Day Steel Strike 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) â€”'The gov
ernment's legal machinery was
being oiled Tuesday in the likely
event President Eisenhower is
unable to win agreement from
union and industry leaders to end
the 77-day-old steel strike.
Action to invoke emergency
provisions of the Taft-Hartley
law. with an 80-day cooling-off
period, may come quickly if Ei
senhower's separate talks Wed
nesday with negotiators from
both sides do not break the dead
lock.
Direct Hand
The President took a direct
hand in the situation Monday,
saying he was getting sick and
tired of the impasse which deep
ened last Friday when the United
Steelworkers of America broke
off industry-labor talks in New
York, on grounds they were get
ting no place.
In advance of Eisenhower's
meeting with the rival sides,
some federal officials said they
doubt even his personal interven
tion will bring the industry and
union any closer together.
Eisenhower was pictured as j
concerned because the walkout |
was keeping idle 500,000 steel j
strikers and nearly 200,000 other
workers in industries dependent
on steel.
Hall Production
The Institute of Appliance
meanwhile, said
a sizable part of that industry j
will have to halt production by I
Oct. 15 unless the steel strike j
ends by then. The industry said I

this was a finding of a special
survey made for Eisenhower's
guidance.
In his statement Monday, the
President declared that so far as
government action can be brought
to bear "I am not going to permit
the economy to suffer."
Taft-Hartley Law
In light of this, Eisenhower is
expected to set in motion the
Taft-Hartley law's machinery if
his meetings with the steel dis
putants don't bear fruit. That is
the only legal weapon he has.
The President will meet first
with the industry group headed
by R. Conrad Cooper, chief of the
steelmakers' bargaining team,
and Roger M. Blough, board
chairman of U.S. Steel Corp. Next
he will talk with the union group
led by Steelworkers President Da
vid J. McDonald.
