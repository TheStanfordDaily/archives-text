Under a new industry-educa
tion cooperative program, three
West Coast aircraft firms have

j University in Aero-Astronautical
Engineering," it was announced

The firms are Aerojet, Hughes,
and Lockheed. A few other com

them.
In this program of mutual ben
efit, Stanford will receive $."5000
to $10,000 from each affiliate to
augment Ihe existing budget. The
University will also gain valuable
advice from affiliates on new
trends in the fast-changing field
of airplane, missile and space
craft design.
In return, the industries will
gain by getting research reports
and manpower recruiting.
Included in Stanford's new re
search facilities are two hyper
sonic wind tunnels, one an arc
discharge type capable of 12,000
mph windstreams and 14,000 de
grees Fahrenheit temperatures.
Another, a quartz lamp appara
tus, can simulate re-entry heat
that a space-ship might meet in
reentry into the earth's atmos
phere.
