TOKYO (/P) — Nikita Khru
shchev told Rod China's loaders in
Peiping Wednesday night: "Wo,
on our part, must do everything
possible to preclude war as a
means for .settling outstanding
questions." Differences must lie
solved through negotiations, he
said.
Mao T/.e-tung, the Chinese Com
munist party leader, and Premior
Chou En-lai were among those
who listened in this prelude to the
Oct. 1 celebration of Communist
Chinese regime's 10th birthday.
Western leaders are coming to
a realistic understanding of tlio
world situation, Khrushchev said.
"When I talked to President Ei
senhower," he said, "my impros
sion was that the President of the
United States — and he has the
support of many people—is aware
of the need for relaxing interna
tional tension."
No Force
The Soviet Premier- told the
gathering that although Commu
nist nations have created a mighty
potential they should not test the
stability of the capitalist system
by force.
"This would be wrong," ho said.
"The peoples would never under
stand and would never support
those who took it into their heads
to act in this way. We have al
ways been against predatory
wars. Marxists have always roc*
ognized only liberating, just
wars.
"Even so noble and progressive
a system as Socialism Commu
nism -cannot be imposed by force
of arms against the will of the
people."
China Warned
The K hr us h c h e v statement
might be regarded as a warning
to Rod China to avoid armed con
flict over such issues as its claim
to about 40,000 square miles of
territory on the India-China fron
tier. The Soviet Union urged Pei
ping and New Delhi in early Sep
tember to settle their border quar
rel.
The Chinese Communist claim
to Formosa could bo a different
matter, in view of Khrushchev's
reference to "liberating, just
wars." Peiping describes its cam
paign against Formosa and off
shore islands of Nationalist China
as a liberation movement.
