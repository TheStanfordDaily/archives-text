Well, I've paid my $10 oar reg
istration fee, been disturbed by
the maze created by the planners
who massacred Palrn Drive, met
the froah dollies, complained that
freshmen are in Stern and the Vil
lage, waited in a Bookstore line
and even taken a book out of the
library.
Tliere isn't much else that
could happen to prove that fall
quarter is under way — unless
maybe I should have a mid term
tomorrow.
This writer is (normally) pretty
optimistic about the 12 weeks that
lie ahead and in the next 20 lines
or so wili tell you why and may
be play like a human optimism
pill to instill the same feeling in
tome of you who pay my terribly
meager salary.
For one thing, football season
figures to hold a few more joys
this year than in a couple of past
seasons which I remember all too
well. ,
If for no other reason I say
litis because the team has been
picket! to go nowhere at all.
Thus, anywhere it does go is
somewhere. That might sound
like hacking' into the situation,
but it at least is one way to look
at it.
1 have to go along with Coach
Jack Curtice's statement that
three to five points now separate
Stanford from a listing in the Top
10 squads in the nation. Stanford
may never make this list this
year, but I predict lots of excite
ment while they try.
Still on the football kick, plans
are now on the boards- in fact
are off the boards by now — to
present some colorful and even
exciting halftime shows for Sta
dium home games.
Thanks to the pioneering, for
ward-looking efforts of Assist
ant Director of Athletics Chuck
Taylor and Kally Com and Band
personnel (AI Chambers and
Harvey Hiindt, respectively),
co-ordinated card stunt - band
halt times have been planned.
This is the first time this has
been done on a large scale here,
and many fingers are crossed in
the hope that it all comes off with
success.
This Saturday the groups com
bine for a colorful "Salute to the
1960 Olympics." In future weeks

"Festivals and Holidays," "Nurs
ery Rhymes" and "American
Scenes" halftime s have been
scheduled.
Perhaps, if there's a donor
available, somebody will donate
color film and a photographer and
we can make reshowings a part
of the Sunday night flicks. East
man Kodak????
Hani's Head soon begins try
outs for a show destined to
"bring - Big Game hack to (laie
ties." (Oct. 5-7, Little Theater.)
And already Kally Com and yell
leader extraordinary Bill Karto
y.ian are in dark, smoke-filled
rooms to provide a season of
fun.
Brigitte Bardot (who is preg
nant now, by tlie way) comes to
the Sunday night flicks on Nov.
1, and Senior Happy Hours loom
large on the social calendar.
We play USC in L.A. on Oct. 24.
and it's time to remind those of
you who don't have plans for this
weekend, that it's generally lots
of fun, and I'm on the prowl for
a listing of what's going to go on
down there. Have no fear, will
spread the word!
Tomorrow is Olympic Day—
complete with Rally —at Ros
sot . . . oops, the Alpine Beer
Garden. Four p.m. Follow the
torch!
Having disseminated all this
information about what fall quar
ter holds in store for me — and
some of you - I feel I can't neg
lect those among us who are
more interested in the Tuesday
Evening Series, the Concert Se
ries, and so on. These appear to
be among the best I've seen com
ing to Stanford in a couple of
years.
I don't shun them, but am us
ually involved enough in all the
rest of what I like never to have
much additional time. Still, I've
often heard people among us up
ami say, "(iee, I discovered the
Tuesday Evening Series (or
some such thing) last night—
not had, you know!" So I might
discover it, too.
And when you consider that
nicely interspersed with all this
potential fun there definitely are
classes to go to, and there defi
nitely is work to be done, it man
ages to make up a full, but still
inviting, quarter. I wish me luck
. . . and you, too.
