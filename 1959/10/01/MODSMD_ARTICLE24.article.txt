The first round being concluded,
one can say, I think, that the Presi
dent's initiative has prospered.
His main purpose in proposing the
exchange of visits was to reopen
ihe clogged and frozen channels
of diplomatic communication be
tween the Western Alliance and
the Soviet Union.
This he has done, and this is the
meaning and the significance of
the conversations at Camp David.
There are to be exchanges
through normal d ip I o in a t i c
channels. When our allies have
been consulted about the place,
(he time, and the agenda, there
will be a Foreign Ministers'
meeting and a summit meeting.
There are to be continuing mul
ti-lateral negotiations about our
dear testing and about disarma
ment. There are to be bi lateral
negotiations about cultural ex
changes and also about a settle
ment of the lend-lease debts. And
beyond all these, there is to be in
the spring a visit by the President
and his family to the Soviet Un
ion.
This much is on the record. How
far there was a meeting of minds
(jff the record on the specific is
sues, we do not now know. But
Mr. K. in his press conference on
Sunday implied that there had
been more understandings than
the official communique reveals.
This is in a way confirmed by
the fact that the President has
agreed to an elaborate and ex
tended series of negotiations,
something lie would not have
done liajl the talks at Camp Da
vid become irreconcilably dead
locked.
Having been one of those who
were filled with misgivings about
the venture in personal diplomacy,

and also about the risks of acci
dents and incidents in Mr. K.'s
public tour, ttie result of Round
One is a pleasant surprise.
I can see now that I had failed
to realize how mighty are the
compulsions which are working
on both the President and Mr. K.
They are compulsions to find
ways by which, as the communi
que said, "all outstanding inter
national questions" can "be set
tled not by the application of
form but by peaceful means
through negotiations."
For neither of the heads of
governments is there, to use the
memorable sentence spoken by
.Mr. Eisenhower some years
ago, "any alternative to peace."
The source of these compul
sions is the race of armaments.
As between the U.S.S.R. and the
U.S.A. there exists a balance of
power in the sense that any war,
however "limited" it might be
when it began, would threaten to
become a total war.
Each of the two governments is
able to inflict intolerable and un
acceptable losses upon the other's
country, and neither could "win"
a war which caused such wide
spread, such long lasting, and
such irreparable devastation.
Although the balance of pow
er may fluctuate, there is at
present no prospect whatever
of the kind of scientific break
through which would give one
or the other of tli«- governments
a safe and reliable supremacy.
This exerts a mighty compul
sion upon them to respect the sta
tus quo, whether it be that of the
Western presence in West Berlin
or that of the Soviet presence in
Eastern Europe.

As between the U.S.S.R. and the
U.S.A. there exists a balance of
power in the sense that any war,
however "limited" it might be
when it began, would threaten to
become a total war.
Each of the two governments is
able to inflict intolerable and un
acceptable losses upon the other's
country, and neither could "win"
a war which caused such wide
spread, such long lasting, and
such irreparable devastation.
Although the balance of pow
er may fluctuate, there is at

of the kind of scientific break
through which would give one

a safe and reliable supremacy.

The first round being concluded,
one can say, I think, that the Presi
dent's initiative has prospered.
His main purpose in proposing the
exchange of visits was to reopen
ihe clogged and frozen channels
of diplomatic communication be
tween the Western Alliance and
the Soviet Union.
This he has done, and this is the
meaning and the significance of
the conversations at Camp David.
There are to be exchanges
through normal d ip I o in a t i c
channels. When our allies have
been consulted about the place,
(he time, and the agenda, there
will be a Foreign Ministers'
meeting and a summit meeting.
There are to be continuing mul
ti-lateral negotiations about our
dear testing and about disarma
ment. There are to be bi lateral
negotiations about cultural ex
changes and also about a settle
ment of the lend-lease debts. And
beyond all these, there is to be in
the spring a visit by the President
and his family to the Soviet Un
ion.
This much is on the record. How
far there was a meeting of minds
(jff the record on the specific is
sues, we do not now know. But
Mr. K. in his press conference on
Sunday implied that there had
been more understandings than
the official communique reveals.
This is in a way confirmed by
the fact that the President has
agreed to an elaborate and ex
tended series of negotiations,
something lie would not have
done liajl the talks at Camp Da
vid become irreconcilably dead
locked.
Having been one of those who
were filled with misgivings about
the venture in personal diplomacy,

and also about the risks of acci
dents and incidents in Mr. K.'s
public tour, ttie result of Round
One is a pleasant surprise.
I can see now that I had failed
to realize how mighty are the
compulsions which are working
on both the President and Mr. K.
They are compulsions to find
ways by which, as the communi
que said, "all outstanding inter
national questions" can "be set
tled not by the application of
form but by peaceful means
through negotiations."
For neither of the heads of
governments is there, to use the
memorable sentence spoken by
.Mr. Eisenhower some years
ago, "any alternative to peace."
The source of these compul
sions is the race of armaments.
