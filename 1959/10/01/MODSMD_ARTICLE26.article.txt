# OLD QUESTION
## China Still Poses Old Questions 
### ARTHUR EDSON 
WASHINGTON (/P) — As long
ago as 1810 a puzzled writer was
asking:
"Among: the different ac
counts respecting China, how
shall we hit upon the true one?"
In San Francisco, Nikita Khru
shchev said that in time China
will surpass both the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R.
Is this true? Does the future
belong to this vast land with its
vast population, where white peo
ple are known as the "long
noses"?
Few U.S. reporters have been
permitted to visit China recent
ly. Undisputed tacts are diffi
cult to come by.
For example: How many Chi
nese are there?
The Chinese Communist gov
ernment said that, as of midnight,
June 30, 1953, it had counted short
noses here and estimated short
noses there. It« astounding con
clusion: 601,938,035.
The British politician, Clem
ent Attlee, once wrote: "I think
the real reason for this popu
lation increase is that China,
being - admittedly a backward
country, hopes to make up in
quantity what it lacks in qual
ity in order to achieve a position
of power in the world. This is
a disturbing thought."
It's hard to make positive state
ments about China. In parts of it
the snow never melts. In south
ern parts oranges grow in profu
sion. It shares with Nepal the
highest spot on earth, Ml. Ever
est, 29,002 feet.
But on one thing all visitors
seem to agree. The lot of the
women, once little more than
slaves, has improved tremendous
ly.
Now women are street clean
ers, rolling mill foremen, house
surgeons, an entire train crew.
They do the same work as men,
get the same pay, wear the
same clothes.
"It wasn't always easy," a visi
tor sadly reports, "to identify
i hem as women."
This may bother a "long nose,"
but the Chinese don't seem to
have any identification problems.
Each year another 13 to 15 mil
lion Chinese are born in this in
creasingly turbulent world.
