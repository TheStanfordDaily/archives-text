# World Awaits Russ Position

There is an atmosphere of ex
citement in the world, created by
wonderment whether, just barely
| possibly, the Soviet Union could
I really be turning the corner to-
I ward international co-operation.
This atmosphere is mentioned
here somewhat after the fash
ion in which one nation fre- j
(jnently extends diplomatic rec
ognition to a new government
in another, as something which
must be considered in doing \
business, but without endorse- |
nient pending developments.
Winston Churchill, whose veryl
(bones have sometimes seemed to
! act as an antenna for picking up!
j the nuances of world affairs, says!
I he sees signs of a thaw in the I
cold wars.
Nikita Khrushchev, in his talk |
with Mao Tse-tung in Peiping fol
lowing his conference with Presi
dent Eisenhower, seemed to be
trying to sell the same line of
relaxation of tensions which he:
seemed to be trying to sell in the
United States. The word seems is j
used advisedly in this connection,!
since the Communist expansionist
theory, which Khrushchev has:
not renounced, calls for chican-;
ery, masquerading and double j
j dealing if they help the Commu-
I nist cause.
Sincerity will be more evi- j
dent if, during future negotia-
I tions, the Soviet Union ever
agrees to give up anything she
[ values for the sake of peace, j
This Khrushchev has consist- j
â€¢ ently refused to do. But at least
he is advising 3lao to <jiiit rock
ing the boat now.
It is by no means proven yet
that Khrushchev has given up!
anything important to him by the
shift in timing regarding his
'threats against the Allied posi

lion in West Boil in.
That whole business could have
been a means to an entirely dif
ferent end than a new status for
Berlin. It could have been a de
liberate means toward his invita
tion to the United States and his
new appearance as a proponent
of peace.
Contributing* to the atmos
phere of excitement tire the
preparations now going' for
ward for a summit conference.
Yet such a conference may con
tain no more promise of real
settlements than did the Wash
ington visit.
Indeed, il seems likely that
Khrushchev would have put for
ward any real concessions he was
prepared to make before Presi
dent Eisenhower just as readily
as when two more chiefs of gov
ernment will be added to the
gathering.
