A New Conference

Tho beginning of the 1959 football season two weeks ago brought
along with it a completely new conference for West Coast sports
fans to follow.
The AAWU, Athletic Association of Western Universities, opened
its initial season with the University of Washington, University of
California, UCLA, USC, and Stanford all as members.
The new league only has contractual binds to its schools in foot
ball and basketball and actually is only really influential in football.
The AAWU football champion will, starting in 1961, represent the
West in the Rose Bowl classic.
The basketball picture in the new league is not nearly as clear
cut as is the football scene. The five team hoop league is as of now
in existence but there are several indications that the organization
of a new West Coast basketball league in which all the schools from
the old Pacific Coast Conference will participate is in the offing.
One of the main reasons why the AAWU basketball league may
not last long is the NCAA rule which states that the college athletic
association will not recognize leagues with less than six members
for its tournament berths.
Since the AAWU has only five teams, each team will be considered
the same as an independent when NCAA tournament time rolls
around in March.
As far as other sports besides football and basketball are con
cerned, it is too impractical and too expensive to have any formal
connection between the five AAWII schools. With Washington in
the league it makes it extremely difficult for all the schools to get
together in some of the spring sports which have lesser spectator
appeal.
Stanford's spring sports calendar will probably read very similar
to the way it has in the past. The only difference will be the absence
of the PCC ties and events.
Stanford's decision to join the new league came only after many
weeks of deliberation and discussion.
One of the main blocks which appeared to hold Stanford's final
decision back was the doubt in some people's mind as to whether or
not this new league would eventually have the same fate befall it
as the old PCC had.
The PCC was disbanded, as is widely known, when some of the
member schools became bitter over penalties dealt them for breaking
the conference code.
The charter members of the AAWU —Cal, UCLA, Washington,
and USC—represent all of the schools who were caught breaking
the PCC regulations.
What assurance does Stanford have that these schools won't
immediately around and break the AAWU rules if they feel
it will aid in their football success? Frankly Stanford has little, if
any assurance, that these teams won't break the rules.
However, the AAWU has been set up with very few rules to
break. Basically there are only two regulations binding the school.
First of all, payments to any athletes must be on a work-for-your
pay basis, and secondly each athlete must be a bona fide student
carrying in Stanford's case at least 12 units a quarter. Both of these
rules were already University regulations at Stanford.
Despite the fact that many onlookers have been skeptical of the
league feeling it will turn into a high finance-low scruples organiza
tion (Steve Baffrey, ex-Stanford Daily sports editor named the
AAWU, Athletes After Wampum Unites), there is no reason why, if
the other schools choose this pattern, Stanford must follow them.
Why Join?
This, of course, brings up the question of why join the league at
all and compromise your principles by aligning with schools who
might decide to become involved in activities contrary to Stanford's
standards? The answer to this is probably just practicality.
Regardless of whether or not Stanford joined the new league,
they are in such a geographic situation that they are pretty much
forced to play the other four AAWU schools or give up football.
If the Ivy League with Vale, Harvard, and the others with its
policy of lighter football were located in the West, Stanford's foot
hall problems might be solved. However, to travel 3,000 miles weekly
for football games is a little ridiculous.
It comas down 1o a matter of if you have to play the four schools
in the AAWU anyway, why not join the league and reap some of
the benefits of the conference. The main benefit of the league is the
Kose Bowl. It's hard for any athletic department that is on a tight
budget to scoff at the annual income the Rose Bowl offers.
At Stanford tho athletic department supports the whole physical
education program and the Kose Bowl income is a big help.
