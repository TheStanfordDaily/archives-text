send 39-year-old Early Wynn af- j
ter the charged-up Los Angeles j
Dodgers in Thursday's delayed

their dramatic playoff victory i
over Milwaukee, the Dodgers i
turned to rangy Roger Craig, 11- |
."), their best starting pitcher in
Ihe closing month of the National
League season.
The forecast calls for partly
cloudy weather with the temper
ature in the middle 60s, assuring
the sellout crowd of 46,550 a
fairly comfortable afternoon. The
