# Cards Work to Defense COP
## Daily Sports 
### Stan Hulett 
Stanford's footballers are work
ing hard and long on their de
fense for this Saturday's clash
with the Bengals of College of
the Pacific. And not just defense
for Ail-American halfback Dick
Bass, but defense for the rest of
a good Tiger offense.
According to Indian Coach Jack
Curtice, "We cannot defense for
Bass alone, they (COP) have too
many other good people." Cur
tice feels that the Tiger offense
can be lough and the Cards will
have to be ready to put a stop
to it.
It looks now as if the Indians
will continue to use the passing
attack as the center of their of
fense. The running attack does
not seem to be sharp enough yet,
but work is being (lone on it. If
the Cards could put together a
ground game to go with one of
the best passing punches in the
nation to date, they could easily
turn what might otherwise be a
close game into a rout.
Tremendous Passing Game
Stanford's passing game has
been nothing short of tremend
ous in the two games thus far
in the 1959 season. The Indians
currently are third in the nation
in passing yardage and Dick Nor
man is the NCAA total offense
leader.
Norman, however, is not the
only figure in the Stanford throw
ing attack. The receivers have
also done a tremendous job in
handling the passes. Chris Bur
ford, Ben Robinson, and Dick
Bowers have all made their share
of great catches to aid the Stan
ford cause.
And don't forget the line, for
without their blocking, quarter
back Norman could not have the
time to wait for receivers to free
themselves.
Good Protection
Norman and the other Card
quarterbacks have been getting
this protection which has added
greatly to the Stanford cause. In
the first two games, it looked like
the passers had all the time they
needed to get rid of the ball.

Stanford will have to do with
out the services of two linemen
in the upcoming game with the
Bengals lion Fernandes, a 6-1,
205-pound guard will be out of
action this weekend because of
torn knee ligaments, and end
Rich Hearney will be sidelined
with a calcium deposit in his leg.
They will be ready for action
when the team travels to Seattle
next week to meet the University
of Washington.
The rest of the Stanfordites,
with the exception of a few minor
bruises, will be in top shape for
the second home game of the
season for the Cards.

the Pacific. And not just defense
for Ail-American halfback Dick
Bass, but defense for the rest of
a good Tiger offense.
According to Indian Coach Jack
Curtice, "We cannot defense for
Bass alone, they (COP) have too
many other good people." Cur
tice feels that the Tiger offense
can be lough and the Cards will
have to be ready to put a stop
to it.
It looks now as if the Indians
will continue to use the passing
attack as the center of their of
fense. The running attack does
not seem to be sharp enough yet,
but work is being (lone on it. If
the Cards could put together a
ground game to go with one of
the best passing punches in the
nation to date, they could easily
turn what might otherwise be a
close game into a rout.
Tremendous Passing Game
Stanford's passing game has
been nothing short of tremend
ous in the two games thus far
in the 1959 season. The Indians
currently are third in the nation
in passing yardage and Dick Nor
man is the NCAA total offense
leader.
Norman, however, is not the
only figure in the Stanford throw
ing attack. The receivers have
also done a tremendous job in
handling the passes. Chris Bur
ford, Ben Robinson, and Dick
Bowers have all made their share
of great catches to aid the Stan
ford cause.
And don't forget the line, for
without their blocking, quarter
back Norman could not have the
time to wait for receivers to free
themselves.
Good Protection
Norman and the other Card
quarterbacks have been getting
this protection which has added
greatly to the Stanford cause. In
the first two games, it looked like
the passers had all the time they
needed to get rid of the ball.

Stanford will have to do with
out the services of two linemen
in the upcoming game with the
Bengals lion Fernandes, a 6-1,
205-pound guard will be out of
action this weekend because of
torn knee ligaments, and end
Rich Hearney will be sidelined
with a calcium deposit in his leg.
They will be ready for action
when the team travels to Seattle
next week to meet the University
of Washington.
The rest of the Stanfordites,
with the exception of a few minor
bruises, will be in top shape for
the second home game of the
season for the Cards.
