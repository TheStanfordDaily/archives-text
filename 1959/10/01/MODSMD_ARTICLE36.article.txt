# Norman Tops NCAA Grid Offense Stats
## 
### 
Stanford's grid squad may yet
have to win its first game, but
you couldn't tell by looking at the
latest NCAA offense figures.
For instance Dick Norman, the
Indian's quarterback, leads the
entire nation in both the total
offense statistics and in forward
passing. Norman's favorite re
ceiver, Chris Bur ford, also paces
ihe nation in the pass receiving
department.
Norman has pitched the pig
skin 59 times for 373 yards, 23
yards better than his closest rival,
Bob Atkins of New Mexico State,
who has played in three games
to Norman's two.
Bur ford has grabbed 14 passes
for 176 yards for his nation-pac
ing mark.
As a team the Indians are third
in the country in passing as only
Army and SMU have better aerial
marks.
