# Activities Day
## 
### 
I lie freshman coining to Stanford normally finds himself in
one of two frames of mind concerning his participation in student
activities: either he is determined to once and for all renounce all
such goings-on, or he assumes he can continue with full-time par
ticipation in seven or eight things just like in high school.
\ new service of Axe Soeietv, to take place today, should help
the freshmen and other new students to decide just what tliev II do
ahont extra curricular activities.
I lie program, called, simpl\ enough, Activities Day. has been
de.-igned to give the Stanford newcomer one place to get informa
tion on \i r 111 all \ ever\ cluh or aetivit) on th% campus.
Such a program has long been needed here, and we congratu
late Axe Society on taking the time and effort in initiating sncli a
service.
To Stanford newcomers, we suggest yon take advantage of this
opportunity to learn what goes on outside the classroom. I here
arc man\ interesting ami worth-while groups which deserve your
attention, and for \ irtnallv everyone there is some group or groups
which deserve sour time. Ihe student who confines his interests
to the textbook and library is ignoring opportunities to broaden
either his vocational or avocational interests.
\\ c would, however, caution von that Stanford is not quite like
high school. You can't he a perpetual joiner ami do a good job.
Some groups require a great deal of time, others not so much,
lint van" 11 enjoy yourself more, do u belter job for the organiza
tion, ami derive the greatest benefits if you are discriminating and
112 ar-sighted in \ our choice of activities.
