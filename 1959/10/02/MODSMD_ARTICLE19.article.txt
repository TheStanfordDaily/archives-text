The academic year opens with |
similar stories from all over the
nation. We find increased enroll- |
merits, welcome rallies, orienta-!
lion programs, tuition hikes, reg- j
istration procedures, and, as on j
Stanford campus, new buildings.
Appropriate and inspiring for
the veterans of reg is a sermon
on "That IBM-Card Feeling"
which opened the year's Vesper
Services at the University of
( Connecticut.
More serious are reports on the I
aftermath of the Sept. 17 death
of a USC pledge as a result of a j
hazing stunt. After Richard i
Swanson choked to death on a |
piece of raw liver in an initiation j
stunt, members of Kappa Sigma
fraternity were dismissed or!
placed on probation and the fra- !
ternity has been banned perma- ;
nently from the campus.
Meanwhile, fraternities on two
of the largest campuses are work- |
ing to end discrimination in
choosing members. Fraternity j
presidents asked the Interfrater
nity Council at the University of :
Michigan "to endeavor to assist i
local chapters . . . toward the!
voluntary elimination of arbl- !
trary selective practices, as well ;
as written restrictions.'
At Berkeley, two of the five
fraternities who last October
did not deny having discrimi
natory race or religion clauses
have now removed such clauses
and two others have plans for
doing so soon.
Since discrimination is forbid- i
den by state law, the University j
board of regents has said all such :
clauses must be removed by Sept. :
1, 1904. on pain of withdrawal of
university recognition, which is I
essential to national recognition.
Also at California there is evi
dence of change in the character
of the land-grant college. As
established by Congress, tlie land- j
grant schools have been rquired i
1o maintain an ROTC program.
The University has made this pro
gram of training compulsory.
Now, after a survey showing
that most men students favor
a voluntary program, Associ
ated Students President David
Armor has written to the stu
dent bodies of other land-grant
universities to ask them to
.'make a similar referendum in
the hopes of making a general
change to a voluntary system.
Another of the land-grant i
schools, traditionally agricultural
and mechanical, has renewed its |
request for permission to give I
ma jors in liberal arts fields. Ore- ,
gon State College was unsuccess- i
I'm I in its bid to add divisional ma- '

jors in the humanities and social
sciences.
Instead, the State Board of Ed
ucation holds that technical sub
jects and liberal arts should be
taught by two separate universi
-1 ies.
Students and faculty mem
bers at many universities are
publishing' reports on their
summers abroad. Twelve hun
dred students took part in the
Experiment in International
Living, staying with families in
countries, including Russia.
A man with unusual experi
ences in Russia is a professor
at the University of Washing
ton, a poultry scientist, who
answered questions at the Am
erican National Exhibition in
Moscow this summer.
Dr. Igor Kosin, himself born in
Russia, said that most people
asked about life in generalâ€”top
ics such as education, medical
care and unemployment. Some
asked how the U.S. is able to pro
duce enough food with only 5 or
10 per cent of the population
farming, while the percentage in
Russia is around 50. A working
model of an American mecha
nized farm drew comments from
Russian farmers that their ma
chinery was inferior, Kosin re
ports.
A USC student reports that in
talking with Russian students, he
found the materials by which the
Russians judge the U.S. are
works of such writers as Ers
kine Caldine, Dickens, and Jack
London, who emphasize racial
discrimination, unemployment,
and exploitation.
Another SC student was part
of student group which made a
fact-finding tour through Cuba.
A law student, Tom Harrison,
says he was struck by "the
god-like way Castro was re
spected by his people."
The typical Cuban "wanted to
convince us that Cuba is not over
run with communists and that
Castro was doing a tremendous
job. Schoolrooms are being built
at a tremendous pace (10,000
since March). Military facilities
are being converted into schools."
Agrarian reforms are also going
forward at a rapid pace, the stu
dents report.
As college students swing back
into the rhythm of the grind they
may welcome a less deadly rhy
thm to be heard at Monterey
Peninsula College, where the Sec
ond Annual Monterey Jazz Fes
tival will be held this weekend.
College bands, both big bands and
small combos, will play to an
expected audience of 35,000 al
the five concerts of the festival.
Swingin!
