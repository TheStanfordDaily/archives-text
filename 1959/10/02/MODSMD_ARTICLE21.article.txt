# DeGaulle Reverts to Old Protocol Stand, But France Still Needs Peace in Algeria
## 
### J. M. ROBERTS Associated Press News Analyst 
Various outside forces are now
at work trying to find a bridge
on which F r en c h President
Charles De Gaulle and rebel lead
ers in Algeria may meet to dis
cuss peace.
I)e Gaulle caused at least
some surprise in the world by
hewing so closely to democratic
principles in his effort to find
a solution. Now he reverts to
the old wartime l)e Gaulle,
standing on protocol and refus
ing to answer rebel statements.
Since there is no such thing as
a government of Algeria, be
won't deal with the rebel re
gime about Algeria.
This is not an unusual position
for governments to take.
But, even if the rebel leaders
cannot speak for Algeria — and
there is considerable evidence that
the whole idea of the rebellion is
held by only a minority even of
the Arab population—they do
speak for t he war which France
is trying to end.
Regardless of the formal
French position, there is some
intercourse provided by go-l>e
tweens behind the scenes.
Count Gerard d'Hauteville.
World War II officer with friends
on both sides, heads a team from
the Moral Rearmament Move
ment which is publicly reported
to have established two-way con
tacts in Switzerland.
The government of Tunisia has
formally offered to act as go
between.
There is no evidence that the
United States and Britain are
taking any part, although both
welcomed De Gaulle's plan for
an eventual election, amply
safeguarded as to its freedom,
by which Algeria could choose
between independence and au
tonomy within the French Com
munity such as that now en
joyed by some other former
colonial areas.
The rebels have held out for

independence a complete break
from France despite the fact
that Algeria could not alone main
tain independence if she had it..
Algeria's economy cannot stand
alone. France picks up a big tab
there all the time. It buys Al
gerian products at prices higher
than could be obtained in the
world market. It even buys the
Algerian wine which France does
not need.
An independent Algeria would

immediately become another
unstable area, and I)c Gaulle
bad reason when he predicted
such a situation would invite
Communist conquest.
But Fiance desperately needs
to stop the fighting. Devotion of
so much military strength to this
1 area is responsible for France's
position in relation to the United
States. Britain and Germany with
regard to the defenses of Europe,
1 about which she complains.
