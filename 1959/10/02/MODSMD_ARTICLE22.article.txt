# MAO. NIKITA TALK
## Red China Shows Off Arms In Parade for Khrushchev 
### 
TOKYO (/Pi Mao Tze-tung paraded his tanks, guns and warplane.s
before Soviet Premier N'ikita Khrushchev at Peiping Thursday in
a thunderous celebration of Red China's loth birthday. The site
was the great plaza named the Square'of Heavenly Peace.
j The visiting Soviet Premier, who has called for avoidance of force

in settling disputes, witnessed a I
display of Chinese instruments of
force that Radio Peiping called
the biggest military parade since
the Communists took over the
China mainland in 1949.
Khrushchev had another closed- !
door talk with Mao, chairman of :
the Chinese Communist party, i
before they headed to the review
ing stand. Radio Peiping an- ;
nounced they had met with their |
top aides for the second such ses-!
sion in as many days. The broad
cast gave no details of what they
discussed. It was presumed |
Khrushchev gave Mao a fill-in at ;
their first meeting on his his- j
toric talks with President Eisen
hower.
Parade u Highlight
The parade was the highlight
of the anniversary celebration.
Rumbling across the square
were 144 big artillery pieces and
99 tanks, all described as made 1
in China. Overhead 'flew 155 .jet
planes bombers and fighters.
Though military shows are a
fixture of various Communist j
holidays, the size of this turnout
looked almost as if it had been
| designed to answer Khrushchev's
I declaration at a Peiping recep-1
j tion Thursday night that world
| differences must be solved i
through negotiations.
"Must Preclude War"
"We, on our part, must do ev
erything possible to preclude
i war," Khrushchev had said.
But Defense Minister Lin Piao
dispelled any idea the Commit
i nists may abandon the use of
! force in the Formosa area.
He cried in an order to the day:
"The aspirations of the Chinese
people, in one way or another to
liberate their own territory of
Taiwan, Formosa, and the coast
al islands and to achieve the com
plete unification of the great
motherland must be realized, and
no foreign countries are allowed
to interfere with this."

I declaration at a Peiping recep-1
j tion Thursday night that world

through negotiations.
"Must Preclude War"
"We, on our part, must do ev
erything possible to preclude
i war," Khrushchev had said.
But Defense Minister Lin Piao
dispelled any idea the Commit
i nists may abandon the use of
! force in the Formosa area.
He cried in an order to the day:
"The aspirations of the Chinese
people, in one way or another to
liberate their own territory of
Taiwan, Formosa, and the coast
al islands and to achieve the com
plete unification of the great
motherland must be realized, and
no foreign countries are allowed
to interfere with this."
TOKYO (/Pi Mao Tze-tung paraded his tanks, guns and warplane.s
before Soviet Premier N'ikita Khrushchev at Peiping Thursday in
a thunderous celebration of Red China's loth birthday. The site
was the great plaza named the Square'of Heavenly Peace.
j The visiting Soviet Premier, who has called for avoidance of force

in settling disputes, witnessed a I
display of Chinese instruments of
force that Radio Peiping called
the biggest military parade since
the Communists took over the
China mainland in 1949.
Khrushchev had another closed- !
door talk with Mao, chairman of :
the Chinese Communist party, i
before they headed to the review
ing stand. Radio Peiping an- ;
nounced they had met with their |
top aides for the second such ses-!
sion in as many days. The broad
cast gave no details of what they
discussed. It was presumed |
Khrushchev gave Mao a fill-in at ;
their first meeting on his his- j
toric talks with President Eisen
hower.
Parade u Highlight
The parade was the highlight
of the anniversary celebration.
Rumbling across the square
were 144 big artillery pieces and
99 tanks, all described as made 1
in China. Overhead 'flew 155 .jet
planes bombers and fighters.

fixture of various Communist j
holidays, the size of this turnout
