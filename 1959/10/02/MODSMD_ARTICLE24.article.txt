LONDON (/I 1 ) Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan said Thursday
"the way is now clear for the
summit" and appealed to voters
to send him to such a top-level
meeting with a strongly Con
servative House of Commons be
hind him.
In a campaign speech in the
Yorkshire city of Pudsey, he said
"We are approaching the most
dramatic moment in the life of
Europe and of the world since
the war. We have now succeeded
in replacing fear and ultimatum
by discussion and negotiation."
Conservative circles hoped an
announcement of the summit date
would come before Britons vote
for 1 a new Parliament next Thurs
day. Such a development, they
felt, would insure a Conservative
victory.
Public opinion polls usually
very close to the mark in Britain
showed the two parties now
were running almost neck and
neck, but with per cent of
the electorate reporting itself un
decided.
Macmillan switched the empha
