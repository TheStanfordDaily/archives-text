# NATIONAL HEADLINER
## Iowa Favored Over Wildcats 
### 
The oddsmakers take a lot of
convincing nowadays, for North
western, 45-13 conquerors of Ok
lahoma last week and ranked No.
2 in the country by most of the
football polls, i-s an underdog this
week.
But the prognosticators really
aren't taking such a l'lier, because
the Wildcats are in lowa City to
morrow to take on fifth-ranked
lowa in a real early-season titanic
that tops the national gridiron
late.
The Rose Bowl champion Hawk
eyes opened their season last
week with a spectacular 42-12
romp over California, the same
team that they massacred last
New Year's Day in Pasadena. The
score that day was 38-14. This
year's Hawkeyes had been touted
as considerably weaker while the
Bears were tabbed a bit stronger.
Iti'al Test-
So it all shapes up as a real test
for Northwestern. The Wildcats
got hold of an Oklahoma team
weakened by food-poisoning last
week and handed the Sooners
their worst beating since pre Bud
Wilkinson days.
Top-ranked Louisiana State, with
consecutive wins over Rice and
Texas Christian,- takes on another
Southwest Conference foe tomor

row in Baylor. The two other oc
cupants on the top five national
rungs, Mississippi and Army, are
heavy favorites in games with
Memphis State and Illinois, re
spectively.
While ineligible lowa is trying
to spike North western's Ruse
Bowl hopes, other Big Ten con
tenders are,in non-conference bat
tles.
Purdiie-Notre Dame
Purdue and Notre Dame mix in
the biggest of the non-coUnting
clashes. Purdue was rated by
many as the Big Ten's best, but
got off to a slow start two weeks
ago when held to a 0-0 standoff by
UCLA. Noty Dame roared away
last week in it* first game under
new coach Joe Kuharich. clobber
ing North Carolina, 28-S, in a
game that had been rated a toss
up.
Wisconsin, another highly-rated
eleven, has what should be a
breat her against Marquette. Wis
consin opened last week by nip
ping Stanford, 16-14, in a wind
and rain storm. Marquette dis
played more muscles than had
been expected in dropping its
opener to Pittsburgh, 21-15, but
last week was topped, 14-0, by
Detroit.
Big Ten darkhorse Indiana is
favored over Minnesota, and tra
ditional rivals Michigan and Mich
igan State meet in another con
ference clash.
Navy, off to a roaring start with
lopsided wins over Boston Col
lege and William and Mary, trav
els to the Cotton Bowl to lake on
Southwest Conference favorite
Southern Methodist. The pass
minded Mustangs lost their open
er last week to Ceorgia Tech, 10-
12.
Surprise Winner
Nebraska a surprise winner by
32-12 over Minnesota last week,
takes on winless Oregon State.
Eastern power Syracuse tangles
with Maryland and Duke takes on
Rice in Houston,
Auburn should return to the
win trail in an intersect ional
against lightly - regarded Hardin-
Simmons. The Tigers were
shocked. 3-0, by Tennessee in last
week's opener. Tennessee, mean
while, has a tough conference
clash with Mississippi State.
O th e r conference games of
some import around the nation
pit Arkansas and Texas Chris
tian, lowa Slate and Missouri, and
Oklahoma and Colorado.
