CHICAGO (A* - Duke Snider
laughed it off an old pro to I lie
core.
"Now you lake thai throwing
error ol* mine," said Snider afler
playing in his 33rd World Series
game Thursday. "11 was the best
ihrow I made all year one hop
and it was at second base. Course,
nobody was at second to take it.
"Hut it made me happy that the
old pro, Gil Hodges, rushed in
from first to stop the ball, even if
he had to sit on it. Until then I
thought the thing was going into
the dugout."
Fans Too Noisy
"Now another thing, about me
dropping Sherm Lollar's fly," con
tinued the Dodgers' center fielder.
"The fans were yelling so much
YVally Moon and I couldn't hear
ourselves yell who was to take it.
The ball just landed in my glove
when Moon hit me. and out it
plopped.
"From now on we will use hand
signals instead of trying to do it
by ear. It was as noisy out there
as it used to be in the old days
in Ebbets Field. We used to use
hand signals then because of the
racket.
"We just got out of practice do

ing il in the Los Angeles Coli
seum, where there is no left field
and right field is so far away you
can't hear the fans anyway.

"I understand my two errors in
one inning set a record for out
fielders in a series game. Well, I
got all kinds of records for a Na
tional Leaguer most home runs
I in a series M), runs! total bases
<2<D, most extra bases on long
hits (ID, most strikeouts (Si I
could go on. So Iwo errors is just
another in Ihe collection.
"1 hope it's not the last of my
records. 1 plan to get in a couple
of more series before I'm fin
ished.
"There was no doubt in my
mind that I was supposed to catch
Lollar's fly. And 1 know there
was no doubt in Moon's mind lie
was supposed to do ihe same
thing. We just didn't realize there
was so much noise out there."
"If we're going to take a heat
ing," continued the Duke, "I'd
much rather get beat like I his and
then win the close ones. When
we go out there tomorrow, the
score will be nothing to noth
ing."
