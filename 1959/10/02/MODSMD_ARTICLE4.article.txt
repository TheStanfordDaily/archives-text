# YEARâ€™S FIRST SESSION
## Dance, Distribution Issues Highlight LASSU Meeting 
### Steve Baffrey, Associate Editor 
What wai forecast as a mild opening session of the 1959-1960
University student legislature last night raised a couple of hot points
before the one-hour and twenty-seven-minute meeting was adjourned. ;
A requested $200 appropriation to the Cardinals Board for what
is listed on the social calendar as an all-campus Big Game dance

| injected the first excitement into j
the opening session.
Permission for two student en
! terprises to distribute an enter- j
j tainment guide booklet on cam
pus was the second issue to go 1
beyond normal discussion limits.!
The Cardinals appropriation j
request was presented to the Leg- j
islature by Jerry Bishop, a mem-!
ber of the Board. Cardinals has
no funds to present the dance.
Lack of Support
The advisability of such a j
dance during the Big Game week
was questioned on the basis of'
lack of obvious student support,
and possible student interest in i
other activities, namely ones in J
San Francisco.
Bishop reported that the ideaj
of the dance was to "keep stu-j
dents on the campus after the;
Big Game bonfire and rally."
ASSU Vice President Julie
! Hirsch, formerly a member of
Cardinals, gave support to the re
quest, stating that "opinion on
the issue had been sought last
year."
The request was approved, by
passing an attempt to table it for
j further consideration or a com
| pilation of current student opin
| ion.
Booklet Blocked
I A constitutional block finally
was pushed in the way of Dick
Turner and Roy Lawson, enter
tainment booklet editors seeking
| distribution permission.
Constitutionally, their request
should have come via Publica
tions Board approval instead of j
from direct petition.
Before the discovery of the |
technicality the legislature debat-j
| ed principle and precedent in at- j
tempting a decision on the issue. j
