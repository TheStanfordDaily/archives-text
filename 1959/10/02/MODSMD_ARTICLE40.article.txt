### Stan Hulett 
Many Stanford fans will get
their first look at the Indians to
morrow as the Cards meet the
College of Paeifie in the Stanford
Stadium, with kiekoff time at 2.
Both the Indians and the Tigers
will be looking for their first win
of the young 19.19 season. In their
first outing the Pacificites lost to
t he I 'diversity of ('olorado 9 (! and
last weekend were idle.
Stanford dropped a elose 2S-27
decision to the University of Ore
gon in the season opener and then
traveled to Ma 'ison to take on the
University ol Wisconsin Badgers,
and there lost another squeaker.
KM 1, on a wet afternoon. In both
games the Indians looked greatly
improved over last season, which
ended with a 2s record for the
Cards.

In both games it has been the
highly vaunted passing attack of
the Stanfordites that has kept
them close and now the Indians
are working hard to get a good
ground game to go with it. COP
is primarily a running team led
by All • American halfback Pick
I i'i ss,
So the fans will be in store for
;i running game by the Tigers and
the best passing attack on the
Coat hy the Cards. Dick Norman
will ho throwing at his favorite
Stanford mates. Chris Burford,
tlie top-ranking pass receiver in
the nation. Ben Robinson, and
hick Bowers, who are tied for
I iili spot among the NCAA pass
receivers.

Tomorrow's game will be the
fourth meeting between the two
schools, with Stanford holding the
edge with two victories to the
Bengals' one. The Tigers sur
prised the Indians 25-20 in the
first meeting between the two in
Stanford came back to take
the next two, 13-12 in 1954 in a
game marred by fumbles, and 33-
1 I in 1955, the last meeting of the
t wo
of bourse the man to watch in
the C<)P offense will be the great
All American halfback Bass. Bass
was the NCAA triple crown win
ner in the 1958 season, as he won
the total offen.se. rushing offense
and scoring titles. He has already
been through the pro draft, be
in;.' picked up at the end of last

season by the Los Angeles Rams.
Bass decided to use up his last
year of eligibility at Pacific.
On ihe strength of his last
year's performance and decision
to return, many observers felt
that this would be the year that
the Tigers would roll, bul injuries
have already cost the Pacificites
two of their top men. Carl Ham
merer and Carl Overstreet.
COP has a big line, but they arc
not as fast as the Wisconsin line
that the Indians faced last week
end in Madison. So it seems that
if t tic Card line does as well as it
did last weekend iti the mud and

rain it could prove to be the down
fall of the Bengals.
Stanford's line was a big ques
tion mark before the season open
er against Oregon, but ii has
proved itself to be capable of giv
protection on pass plays. This
has been one of the major reasons
for the success of the Stanford
passing attack.
Norman is currently the top
collegiate passer in the nation, as
well as the top offensive playei
among the major colleges in the
country. Ii has been his passing
that has made Stanford one of the
top offensive teams on the West
Coast.
Against Wisconsin, Norman
threw every conceivable type of
pass, from a basketball pass to
one left-handed. With this kind
of throwing Stanford will give
the fans a real top spectacle in the
Stanford Stadium tomorrow.
