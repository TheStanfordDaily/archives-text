There was one gone in the third
when ihe sky began to la 11 on the
Dodgers, to ihe vast entertain
ment of most of ihe capacity
crowd of 48,013. The White Sox
fans, who had waile d 40 years for
;i series, chanted "go-go" like a
college cheering section as the i
score mounted.
Fox si rifted it all with a double
that bounced off the dark green
wall in tight field. Landis sent
him scooting home with a single
over Neal's head to right renler
Then came Kluszewski's first ,

and immediately ran into trouble.!

tor. Wally Moon and Snider col- I
lided under the ball and Snider j
let it drop. Billy Goodman
