# Longshoreman Strike Brings Shipping Halt
## 
### 
NEW YORK (/Pi Nettled over
contract negotiations, clock work
ers handling ship cargoes on At
lantic and Gulf coasts struck yes
terday despite pleas of the gov
ernment and wishes of their load
ers.
As a result, shipping on two
thirds of the American coastline
was virtually brought to a stand
still.
Railroads halted movement of
most freight to the two coasts to
prevent huge pileups on unman
ned piers.
Hundreds of dry cargo vessels
were tied up. Fuel tankers gen
erally were exceptions because
they are handled by other unions.
The surprise walkout shoved
the strike-caused manpower loss
past the million mark by a con
servative count.
Major strikes already were un
der way in the steel, meat-pack
ing, ship repair, glass and non
ferrous metal industries.
Biggest of the strikes by far
is the continuing steel stoppage,
now in its 12th week. An estimat
ed 500,000 steelworkers are idle in
the basic steel industry as well
as 200.000 other workers in in
dustries dependent on steel.
