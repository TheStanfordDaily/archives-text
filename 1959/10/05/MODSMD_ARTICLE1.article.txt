# Soviets Expect First Photos of Hidden Surface
## 
### 
MOSCOW (/P) The Russians Sunday rocketed a 614-pound satel- j
lite into» space aimed at taking mankind's first pictures of the per-1
petually hidden face of the moon.
If all goes well, the unmanned laboratory of intricate instruments
should reach the area of the moon Monday night, then head back j

toward a vast, cigar-shaped orbit
around the earth.
The American civilian space
agency is taking a wait-and-see
attitude for Ihe lime being on
whether' the Soviet "interplane
tary space station" will succeed
in its objective.
A spokesman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
t rat ion indicated Sunday the ag
ency is not doubting that the Rus
sians have a new space messen
ger in flight. But he said predic
tions of success, as the Russians
have already confidently made,
are one tiling and actual accom
plishment of the objective is an
other.
The Soviet announcement said
the space station is on a course
that should take it around the
moon at a distance of about 10,-
000 kilometers—about 6,200 miles.
Then it should swing back toward
earth.
Soviet scientists predicted the
space station would stay aloft for
a long time because it will ap
proach no closer than 1,240 miles
to the earth.
Conquest of Space
"This means we have already
entered the period of planned con
quest of cosmic space and reali
ation of a flight to the moon and
the nearest planet," said astrono
mer Nikolai Barbashev, chairman
of the Academy of Sciences plan
etary committee.
Hours after the early Sunday
morning takeoff, the question of
whether the space station would
make one loop around the moon
or more than one was the subject
of excitedly contradictory re
ports.
Experts at Moscow Planetari
um said the vehicle, called an
interplanetary station in the So
viet announcement, was in fact
only another earth satellite.
Moon Included
They said for this one circuit it !
is going to include the moon
within its flight.
After that they said it will con
linuc to circle the earth with an
extremely elongated orbit and
when the moon chances around
this way again some 28 days
hence, it might just get looped
again, and perhaps again every
four weeks or so.
This seemed unlikely to some
scientific observers since the
moon also moves around the
earth. It would be difficult to
calculate a course so that the
moon could be looped on later
circuits.
Other Soviet commentators
said the flying laboratory would I
loop the moon, then come back
into an elongated orbit around :
the earth, staying aloft many
weeks.
At latest report the flying sta
tion sounded off on schedule at a
poinj calculated by Soviet scien- j
tists as about 67,000 miles up. |

whether' the Soviet "interplane
tary space station" will succeed
in its objective.
A spokesman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
t rat ion indicated Sunday the ag
ency is not doubting that the Rus
sians have a new space messen
ger in flight. But he said predic
tions of success, as the Russians
have already confidently made,
are one tiling and actual accom
plishment of the objective is an
other.
The Soviet announcement said
the space station is on a course
that should take it around the
moon at a distance of about 10,-
000 kilometers—about 6,200 miles.
Then it should swing back toward
earth.
Soviet scientists predicted the
space station would stay aloft for
a long time because it will ap
proach no closer than 1,240 miles
to the earth.

"This means we have already
entered the period of planned con
quest of cosmic space and reali
ation of a flight to the moon and
the nearest planet," said astrono
mer Nikolai Barbashev, chairman
of the Academy of Sciences plan
etary committee.
Hours after the early Sunday
morning takeoff, the question of
whether the space station would
make one loop around the moon
or more than one was the subject
of excitedly contradictory re
ports.
Experts at Moscow Planetari
um said the vehicle, called an
interplanetary station in the So
viet announcement, was in fact
only another earth satellite.
Moon Included
They said for this one circuit it !
is going to include the moon
within its flight.
After that they said it will con
linuc to circle the earth with an
extremely elongated orbit and
when the moon chances around
this way again some 28 days
hence, it might just get looped
again, and perhaps again every
four weeks or so.
This seemed unlikely to some
scientific observers since the
moon also moves around the
earth. It would be difficult to
calculate a course so that the
moon could be looped on later
circuits.
Other Soviet commentators
said the flying laboratory would I
loop the moon, then come back
into an elongated orbit around :
the earth, staying aloft many
weeks.
At latest report the flying sta
tion sounded off on schedule at a
poinj calculated by Soviet scien- j
tists as about 67,000 miles up. |
MOSCOW (/P) The Russians Sunday rocketed a 614-pound satel- j

should reach the area of the moon Monday night, then head back j
