Director Ford Oehne has issued
a call for actors, singers, dancers
and technical people to help put
the 1959 show on.

Game week. We don't intend to
use the week as an excuse to put
on a show," he said.

appear in the show and most of
the production's skits will be
staged in "exciting, colorful cos
tumes," according to Oehne - .
Gaieties runs from Nov. 17 to
20.
Interested prospective cast and
crew members who are unable to
make tryouts during the sched
uled times should contact Oehne,
