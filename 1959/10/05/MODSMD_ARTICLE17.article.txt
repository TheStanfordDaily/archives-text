# LASSU and Opinion
## 
### 
Most matters which come before ASSI I Legislature are not of
great interest to students as a whole. I'hings such as club constitu
tions or appropriations to some group publishing a booklet stir
no student opinion ihev are of interest onlv to the concerned or
ganizations.
\\ hen an issue arises which is of concern to much'of the student
body, we believe it is the responsibilit\ of Legislature to make some
attempt to sound out student opinion. Though a decision eontrar\
to opinion may be dictated h\ one factor or another. Legislature
should at least be able to sa\ it acted after considering this opinion.
Legislature, unfortunately, cannot sav this after its action
I hursdav in appropriating student funds for a campus dance the
night before Big <rame.
Last Big Game, for the first tilne in main years, Stanford's Fri
day night Big (rame rally in San Francisco was abandoned, and
the bonfire program moved from Thursday to Friday night. Pro
ponents ol this move said it had much support, though this state
ment was not documented.
Now, a final nail has been driven into the coffin of the ( itv rally,
this time with no move to consult campus opinion. Perhaps stu
dents would like a dance after the bonfire. \\ e think the\"d rather
have the what-used-to-be traditional rallv in San Francisco.
We hope this action does not establish a precedent for the 1959â€”
60 Legislature. I here are few enough issues which interest or af
fect students let student opinion at least be heard on those which
are of concern.
On the particular issue of the moment, though action has been
taken it is still not 100 late for \ou to let Legislature know wlial
you think of plans for Big Game eve. After all. if there's one thing
that's supposed to be for the students, it's Big (rame and all its
uctivit ies.
