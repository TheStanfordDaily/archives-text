Ihk (.1,\ss OF 6(1 kicked off its social vear Friday with what
looks lo luivc been anion'; the most successful of recent Olympic
Days, (icrtainlv llic competitive nature of tlic Alpine Koad race
vsas an improvement over past such events. And there was a size
able crowd on hand for the festi \ ilies. Ml in all. il vn as a <rood start
for *60.
Speaking of jjood starts, head veil leader Hill Kartozian seems
lo have broken in more successfullv than any of his'recent prede
cessors. We applaud his leaving the veil-leading to assistants so he
can concentrate on comments. Stanford has become prettv par
ticular about vi'll leaders, so tlie lack of concentrated opposition
stands as a significant lritmi[di for Kartozian.
