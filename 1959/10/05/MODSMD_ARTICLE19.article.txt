# OUTLOOK DIM
## Summit Dates Should Be Set In Two Weeks 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) â€”U.S. offi
cials see little or no chance for
working out a Berlin agreement
with the Soviet Union, in .spite of
the atmosphere of good will gen
erated by the Eisenhower-Khru
shchev talks.
Just when an anticipated sum
mit meeting will be held is still
a guess, though a decision is ex
pected in 10 days to two weeks.
The best-informed State De
partment officials say that the
session will probably be in Ge
neva and might be arranged by
the latter part of November but
could be delayed as late as next
February.
The outcome of the British
elections is bound to have an ef
fect on the timing. Diplomats
said it was obvious that a change
in the London government would
mean that new ministers would
have to have time to review the
situation and formulate their poli
cies. whereas a continuation of
the present government would
have no such effect.
What is more important to
policymakers here than the tim
ing is the fact that nothing which
was done at Camp David provides
any hope for reaching a better
understanding with the Soviet
Union on Berlin or other German
issues- or indeed on any other
matter.
