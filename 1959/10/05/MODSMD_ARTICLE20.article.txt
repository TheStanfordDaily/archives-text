Anything that head yell leader
Bill Kartozian does at a football
game this year seems destined to
cause controversy.
The Stanford cheering sec
tion hung on every word from
its head yell leader Saturday;
some in hopeful anticipation,
others in more than mild anxi
ety.
Almost everyone on campus
agrees that Kartozian is actually
a's different from other yell lead
ers as he promised to be, but we
surely haven't agreed as to
whether we like the idea or not.
"I think that Kartozian is great
and so is the cheering section,"
said first year law student Wally
Cummins. "He's the best yell
leader we've had in four years—
though he may be in the Dean's
Office at 8 o'clock Monday. Now
I'd like to start a movement to
get rid of card stunts."
"I enjoyed Kartozian more
than the football game," said
l'reshman Judy Wendall.
However, alumni and guests
seated near the rooting section
Saturday weren't nearly so en
thusiastic.
"I think tfyat that cheerleader
is ihe most peculiar that I've ever
seen," .said Mrs. F. B. Hevern of
Mountain View. "He's terrible.
You should at least have a cheer
leader' that looks like one."
The yell leading stinks," said
two other guests. "We came to
the game to root for Stanford,
but now we're pulling for COP.
The kind of rooting out here to
day doesn't become Stanford."
According to Mr. and Mrs. W.
F. Becker of Northwestern Uni
versity, Kartozian was objection
able. "He's an insult to the stu
dents' intelligence," they said.
"He makes a personal show out
of his position, and that's not
right. We're surprised to see the
students go along with him."
But as freshman Martin Degg
ler put it, "Kartozian seems to
have a tremendous following, and
he gets a lot out of the cheering
section."
Kartozian's "personal show"
started when he entered the
stadium in a "C.0.P.P." out
house and emerged dressed in
his usual overcoat, straw hat
and cigar.
Mr. E. E. W. McGuire of Marin
County commented, "The cheer
ing seems all right, but I think
that you'll get tired of your head
yell leader before the end of the
season."
Senior Caroline Bien said that
she thought that Kartozian was
good. "He's got a good approach
to the 'fight' yell, and I think
that he's suave," she said.
A girl who refused to give
her name said that she enjoyed
Kartozian's yells. "On second
thought, 1 didn't really enjoy
them," she said. "I think that
his humor and costume were
not in place."
"It's about time that we had a
cheerleader that isn't other-di
rected," commented another stu
dent.
"I think that Kartozian is ef
fective because people pay atten
tion to him just to see what he
is going to do," explained Mirlo
sophomore Barb Larson.
Other students si ill weren't
sure about what they thought
of this year's yell leading. "I
think that it's just the same
kind of humor that we had last
year, but Kartozian has the
personality (o put it over," said
one student.
"Well, Kartozian got the cheer

ing section to do the yells he
wanted. And thai makes him bet
ter than most yell leaders," said
another.
"Kartozian's different, but I
don't think that that's necessarily
bad," said Sally Sievers of Ruble
Hall.
Jeff Evans, off-campus, thinks
it's good that Kartozian doesn't
lead the yells. "A good yell
leader has enough to do with
out that too," lie said.
Another student told why he
thought Kartozian was going to
be a good yell leader: "He's
pretty casual, and he keeps ev
eryone's attention. The other yell
leaders have been all red-hots,
but Kartozian exemplifies the
Stanford altitude."
