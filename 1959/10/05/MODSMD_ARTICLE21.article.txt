# GOP Calls for $36 Billion Annual Science Budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)—A 36-bil
lion-dollar annual government
outlay for America's scientific
expansion by 1976 was proposed
Sunday in a Republican commit
tee report.
Forecasting vast technological
developments in the next 17
years, a GOP task force said cur
rent scientific spending of about
10 billion dollars a year must be
more than tripled to prepare for
revolutionary changes in the
American way of life.
The GOP task force as an arm
of the progress committee set up
by the Republican National Com
mittee to peer into the future—
said it is against "vast new spend
ing programs directed from
Washington." It said government
must play only a partnership role
with private enterprise in scien
tific developments, not run the

show.
The task force foresaw a won
derous life of physical ease in
197G for 237 million Americans
who cou 1 d think advanced
thoughts while machines took
care of the drudgery of produc
tion.
