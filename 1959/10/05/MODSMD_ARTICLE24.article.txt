# Troy Wins Bears And UCLA Lose
## 
### 
The University of Southern
California led by sophomore
quarterback Ben Charles supplied
AAWU and West Coast football
fans with one of their finest mo
! ments last Friday night when
1 they dumped Ohio State's Buck-
I eyes 17-0.
The Trojans from Los Angeles,
fast becoming one of the nation's
top teams, held the powerful Big
i Ten Buckeyes to a total of only
;143 yards in offense.
Substitutes Well
Charles filling in for injured
Troy quartrback Willie Wood
proved to be a more than ade
quate replacement as he passed
; for one touchdown and scored an
; other.
j The University of California
i and UCLA, both of which were
I involved in other intersect ional
parries, didn't fare as well as the
Trojans.
Cal not only was blasted 33-0
by the Texas Longhorns but also
losfthe services of both their top
i quarterbacks, Larry Parque and
i Wayne Crow.
Crow injured an ankle which
kept him out of action in the sec
! ond half and he probably will be
lost for next Saturday's game
with Notre Dame. Parque hurt
his shoulder and he also may be
out at least a week.
Passes Hurt
UCLA, after piling up a 14-0
halftime lead, found a Pittsburgh
passing attack just a little too
tough as the Panthers rolled up
19 points in the fourth quarter
to take a 25-21 victory.
The University of Washington
Huskies put on one of the most
convincing offensive shows that
anyone in Seattle has seen in
years as they drubbed Utah 51-6
on Saturday.
The Huskies scored three touch
downs in the first quarter and
kept right on going as they
crossed the goal line seven times.
Stanford Next
Washington will open its 1959
AAWU season next Saturday
j against the Stanford Indians at
| Seattle.
Oregon's Webfoots won their
i third consecutive game Saturday
by squeaking by the Washington
State Cougars 14-6.
Oregon fullback Dave Powell
lead the Duck runners for the
third straight week but was in
jured late in the first half and
saw only one half's action.
Oregon State, doing just the
opposite of the Ducks, dropped
their third straight game. The
Beavers were nipped 7-6 by Ne
braska as a Nebraska sophomore
kicked sealed the doom for Ore
gon State. Oregon will meet San
Jose State next weekend, in what
should be about an even money
battle.
