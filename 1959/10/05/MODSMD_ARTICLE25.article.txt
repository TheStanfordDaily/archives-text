## Curtice Praises Indians After Season's First Win 
### 
For the first time in the 1959
football campaign Stanford Coach
Jack Curtice was able to* look
back at Saturday's action with
satisfaction of coming home with
the winner.
"It's kind of like having a little
money in the bank again," re
marked Curtice after Stanford's
gridiron Indians had just com
pleted a 21-6 victory over the COP
Tigers.
Outside of a few tackling weak
nesses Curtice was very satisfied
with the Indians winning effort.
"Even our best tacklers were
missing tackles they should have
been making," continued Curtice,
"However, those COP backs Wal
lace and Bass are certainly
great."
Wallace Lauded
Curtice had especially high
compliments for Hank Wallace,
COP's hard • running fullback.
Wallace gained 58 yards rushing
and picked up 53 more yards run
ning with screen passes.
"That Wallace is darn near as
good as Bass (Dick Bass) and
between the two of them they
make as good a combination of
backs as I've ever seen in one
college backfield."
Stanford's success was parti
ally a product of the depth that
the Indians were able to display
against the thinner COP man
power. Curtice was extremely
pleased, as ho has been each week
this season, with the play of some
of his "greenie" linemen.
Gordon Surprises
Jack Gordon, a center on last
year's freshman team and not
even first string on that squad,
drew a lot of praise from his
coach. Gordon was switched to
tackle in spring practice last year
and has played well in both the
Wisconsin game and the COP
game. Gordon made 11 tackles
against the Tigers, the second
highest total on the team. Mac
Wylie, the leader, had 13.
As well as Gordon, other mem
bers of the second unit line were
singled out by Curtice for their
part in the victory. George Hon
ore, a sophomore end, Cap Ing

ham, a senior tackle, and Gary
Leahy, a sophomore guard, were
all large contributors to Stan
ford's victory effort.
Most everybody connected with
ihe Indian team was convinced
that Saturday's win was a team
effort. Rick McMillen who scored
Stanford's first touchdown after
taking a swing pass from Indian
quarterback Dick Norman gave
much of the credit for his 25-yard
scamper to teammate Mac Wylie.
Key Block
Wylie, playing well on both of
fense and defense, threw the key
block for McMillen which allowed
the Card halfback to run un
touched down the sideline.
Another Stanford player who
turned in an outstanding game
was end Ben Robinson. "Big
Ben," the tallest member of the
team (now that Dean Hinshaw is
out) at 6-5 contributed key blocks
in many of Stanford's offensive
drives as well as hauling in a Nor
man pass for a 40-yard gain.
Dick Norman, the nation's lead
ing passer, carried the ball on
runs good for 26 yards in Satur
day's game.
"Norman will just have to do
a little running if our attack is
going to move," commented Cur
tice.
He feels that it would improve
the Stanford attack greatly if
Norman would run with the ball
more.
Dick Bass, COPs All-American
halfback, picked up 110 net yards
rushing in the game. However,
65 of those yards came in the first
quarter and Bass was consider
ably slowed down in the second
half.
The explanation Curtice had
for this was a change in Stan
ford's defensive setup.

much of the credit for his 25-yard
scamper to teammate Mac Wylie.
Key Block
Wylie, playing well on both of
fense and defense, threw the key
block for McMillen which allowed
the Card halfback to run un
touched down the sideline.
Another Stanford player who
turned in an outstanding game
was end Ben Robinson. "Big
Ben," the tallest member of the
team (now that Dean Hinshaw is
out) at 6-5 contributed key blocks
in many of Stanford's offensive
drives as well as hauling in a Nor
man pass for a 40-yard gain.
Dick Norman, the nation's lead
ing passer, carried the ball on
runs good for 26 yards in Satur
day's game.
"Norman will just have to do
a little running if our attack is
going to move," commented Cur
tice.
He feels that it would improve
the Stanford attack greatly if
Norman would run with the ball
more.
Dick Bass, COPs All-American
halfback, picked up 110 net yards
rushing in the game. However,
65 of those yards came in the first
quarter and Bass was consider
ably slowed down in the second
half.
The explanation Curtice had
for this was a change in Stan
ford's defensive setup.
For the first time in the 1959
football campaign Stanford Coach
Jack Curtice was able to* look
back at Saturday's action with
satisfaction of coming home with
the winner.
"It's kind of like having a little
money in the bank again," re
marked Curtice after Stanford's
gridiron Indians had just com
pleted a 21-6 victory over the COP
Tigers.
Outside of a few tackling weak
nesses Curtice was very satisfied
with the Indians winning effort.
"Even our best tacklers were
missing tackles they should have
been making," continued Curtice,
"However, those COP backs Wal
lace and Bass are certainly
great."
Wallace Lauded
Curtice had especially high
compliments for Hank Wallace,
COP's hard • running fullback.
Wallace gained 58 yards rushing
and picked up 53 more yards run
ning with screen passes.
"That Wallace is darn near as
good as Bass (Dick Bass) and
between the two of them they
make as good a combination of
backs as I've ever seen in one
college backfield."
Stanford's success was parti
ally a product of the depth that
the Indians were able to display
against the thinner COP man
power. Curtice was extremely
pleased, as ho has been each week
this season, with the play of some
of his "greenie" linemen.
Gordon Surprises
Jack Gordon, a center on last
year's freshman team and not
even first string on that squad,
drew a lot of praise from his
coach. Gordon was switched to
tackle in spring practice last year
and has played well in both the
Wisconsin game and the COP
game. Gordon made 11 tackles
against the Tigers, the second
highest total on the team. Mac
Wylie, the leader, had 13.
As well as Gordon, other mem
bers of the second unit line were
singled out by Curtice for their
part in the victory. George Hon
ore, a sophomore end, Cap Ing

ham, a senior tackle, and Gary
Leahy, a sophomore guard, were
all large contributors to Stan
ford's victory effort.
Most everybody connected with
ihe Indian team was convinced
that Saturday's win was a team
effort. Rick McMillen who scored
Stanford's first touchdown after
taking a swing pass from Indian
quarterback Dick Norman gave
much of the credit for his 25-yard
scamper to teammate Mac Wylie.

ally a product of the depth that
the Indians were able to display
against the thinner COP man
power. Curtice was extremely
pleased, as ho has been each week
this season, with the play of some
of his "greenie" linemen.
Gordon Surprises
Jack Gordon, a center on last
year's freshman team and not
even first string on that squad,
drew a lot of praise from his
coach. Gordon was switched to
tackle in spring practice last year
and has played well in both the
Wisconsin game and the COP
game. Gordon made 11 tackles
against the Tigers, the second
highest total on the team. Mac
Wylie, the leader, had 13.
As well as Gordon, other mem
bers of the second unit line were
singled out by Curtice for their
part in the victory. George Hon
ore, a sophomore end, Cap Ing

ham, a senior tackle, and Gary
Leahy, a sophomore guard, were
all large contributors to Stan
ford's victory effort.
Most everybody connected with
ihe Indian team was convinced
that Saturday's win was a team
effort. Rick McMillen who scored
Stanford's first touchdown after
taking a swing pass from Indian
quarterback Dick Norman gave
much of the credit for his 25-yard
scamper to teammate Mac Wylie.
Key Block
Wylie, playing well on both of
fense and defense, threw the key
block for McMillen which allowed
the Card halfback to run un
touched down the sideline.
Another Stanford player who
turned in an outstanding game
was end Ben Robinson. "Big
Ben," the tallest member of the
team (now that Dean Hinshaw is
out) at 6-5 contributed key blocks
in many of Stanford's offensive
drives as well as hauling in a Nor
man pass for a 40-yard gain.
Dick Norman, the nation's lead
ing passer, carried the ball on
runs good for 26 yards in Satur
day's game.
"Norman will just have to do
a little running if our attack is
going to move," commented Cur
tice.
He feels that it would improve
the Stanford attack greatly if
Norman would run with the ball
more.
Dick Bass, COPs All-American
halfback, picked up 110 net yards
rushing in the game. However,
65 of those yards came in the first
quarter and Bass was consider
ably slowed down in the second
half.
The explanation Curtice had
for this was a change in Stan
ford's defensive setup.
