LOS ANGELES (#»)■— Aging
Carl Furillo came through again
for the Dodgers with a two - run
pinch single in the seventh that
propelled Los Angeles to a 3-1 vic
tory over the Chicago White Sox
Sunday before a record World Se
ries throng of 92,294 at the uncov
ered Coliseum.
The 37-year-old Dodger, whose
pinch single in the playoffs helped
win the pennant last Tuesday,
thus boosted Los Angeles into a
2-1 series lead after three games.
Furillo's sharp ground ball just
past the itching glove of shortstop
Luis Aparicio came with the bases
loaded and two out on the second
pitch by Gerry Staley who had
just relieved Dick Donovan. Al
though Chicago came back with
one in the eighth and Los Ange
les matched it, Furillo's hit was
the game-winner.
Dick Donovan and young Don
Drysdale had been hojked up in
a tremendous scoreless baltle for
six innings. Time after time the
White Sox threatened, collecting
at least one of their 12 hits in each
inning, but they couldn't break
through until the eighth. By that
time Larry Sherry had come on
to take over for Drysdale who
had weakened suddenly.
Smelling the sweet scent of vic
tory and the certain record player
cut that will go with it. Sherry
was superb in the ninth. He
struck out pinch - hitter Norm
Cash and bla/.cd a called third
strike past Aparicio. Fox singled
through the pitcher's legs into
center for his third hit but Sherry
whiffed Jim Landis to end it.
Eleven White Sox were left on
base by the pitching of Drysdale
and young Sherry and the tight
inner defense that reeled off three
double plays.
In the seventh inning, Charlie
Neal led off with a single against
the left field screen. Wally Moon
grounded out, Neal moving to sec
ond. Then Donovan lost his con
trol and walked Norm Larker on
four straight pitches. Then White
Sox Manager A 1 Lopez figured
that was enough for Donovan and
called in his bullpen ace Gerry
Staley.
Then Dodger manager Walt Al
ston called on Furillo for pinch
hitting duty. Furillo hit the next
pitch just beyond the reach of the
fingertips of shortstop Luis Apa
ricio and"the two runs scored.
And pandemonium broke loose in
the Coliseum.
Aparicio .said he did not see
the ball Furillo hit very well be
cause of the white-shirted back

ground that bothered both the
fielders and the flitters:
The Go-Go Sox, who banked on
speed to win the A meri e a n
League pennant, were thrown out
three times by catcher Johnny
Roseboro when they tried to steal.
They had one stolen base, by Lan
dis in the first, hut there was no
throw on him as Fox was on third
at the time.
The two teams will play the
fourth game today at the Coli
seum at 7 p.m. Early Wynn, win
ner of the opening game, 11-0, will
pitch for the White Sox against
the Dodgers' Roger Craig.
