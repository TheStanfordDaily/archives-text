TOKYO (/P) â€” Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev wound up a
five-day visit in Red China Sun
day with a parting declaration
that Soviet Communists consider
it their "sacred duty" to liquidate
the cold war. Then he flew to Vla
divostok, the far eastern capital
of the Soviet Union.
Hammering publicly for the
third and last time during his
visit on the theme of international
| relaxation of tensions, the Soviet
Premier said, with Mao Tze-tung
listening:
"At present, the forces of pcace
are stronger than ever. There is
full actual possibility to bar the
road to war. The common people
of the entire world are becoming
ever more confident that with the
growth of the might of the world
Socialist system it will be possible
forever to eliminate war as a
means of solving international
j disputes."
