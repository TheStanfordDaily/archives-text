# Indians Stop COP Tigers 21-6 For First Win of 1959 Season
## Card Defense Stops Bass; End Six Game Loss Streak 
### Stan Hulett 
Stanford's Indians broke a six-game losing streak spread over two
seasons, by beating the College of, Pacific Tigers, 21-6 Saturday in
Stanford Stadium.
It was quite a victory for the Indians, for they stopped All Amci i
can halfback Bass almost completely in the second half, after the

fleet Tiger had gained 65 yards on |
seven carries and passed for 13
yards in the first period of the I
game. At the end of the game, !
Bass had gained only an addi
tional 45 yards.
The big plays of the game were
when the Indians stopped Bass
and Company twice inside the
Card ten-yard line. More than
this, the Stanford line cracked
through the Bengal forward wall
and stopped Bass twice, once for
no gain and once for a yard loss,
inside the ten, to stop two Tiger
touchdown drives.
Much to the surprise of all, the
Indians did not pass the ball as
much as they were expected to.
Stanford only passed 21 times in
the game, a low figure compared
to the other two games they have
played this season. The Cards
chose to run the ball, and run it
they did. They gained 156 yards
on the ground and 195 in the air,
a much better balanced attack
than the Indians have shown in
a couple of years.
Dick Norman, sensational In
dian passer, kept up his pace, as
he passed 19 times, completed 12
for 195 yards. Norman also gained
26 yards on the ground, for a

total of 221 yards. The Indians
showed great balance in their
running attack, as I hey had five
men gaining between 23 and 27
yards apiece. Skip Face gained
28, Norman and Mac Wylie, 2fi,
Rod Sears 27 and Gil Dowd, 23.
COP Worn Down
This was the running attack
jlhat wore down the COP team,
and was the big reason that the
Tigers were unable to complete
their drives late in the game, they
were just, plain tired. The Card
defense forced the Bengals to
grind out their gains at three or
four yards at a time, and this be
gan to tell on the Bengals in the
final period.
Stanford used two units and
they seemed to be of equal abil
ity, for they had about equal suc
cess in stopping the COP running
attack. Some relatively new faces
were big guns in the Stanford
defense. Fellows like Jack Gor
'don, a 6-2, 194-pounder, made 11
tackles on the afternoon. Gary
Leahy, a sophomore guard, put
the stop on nine Tiger ball car
riers. The old faces were in there,
too. Mac Wylie got 13 tackles,
Tom Walsh, a standout" soph
guard, got nine, Gary Pike got
ten, and Cap Ingham pulled down
seven.
Burford Connects
Chris Burford, All-American
end candidate, grabbed off three
of Norman's passes for a total of
63 yards. This brings the Stan
ford captain's season total to 17
catches in three games. Ben Rob
inson caught only one pass, but
he grabbed the ball and faked
three defenders out of their shoes,
setting up the first Stanford
score.
On the first play after Robin
son's fine run, Rick McMillen
took a pitchout from Norman and
streaked down the sideline for the
score. McMillen was helped out.
by a fine block by Mac Wylie,
who downed the only Bengal who
had a shot at McMillen, halfback
Herm Urenda. Skip Face split,
the uprights on the kick and the
Indians led COP 7-6, with 5:20
left in the first half.
COP—First Blood
The Bengals had drawn first
blood in the game when Hank
Wallace, hard driving fullback,

NORMAN COLLARS BASS
Indian's Norman hooks Bass after the Tiger rambled
Stanford's Indians broke a six-game losing streak spread over two
seasons, by beating the College of, Pacific Tigers, 21-6 Saturday in
Stanford Stadium.
It was quite a victory for the Indians, for they stopped All Amci i
can halfback Bass almost completely in the second half, after the

fleet Tiger had gained 65 yards on |
seven carries and passed for 13
yards in the first period of the I
game. At the end of the game, !
Bass had gained only an addi
tional 45 yards.
The big plays of the game were
when the Indians stopped Bass
and Company twice inside the
Card ten-yard line. More than
this, the Stanford line cracked
through the Bengal forward wall
and stopped Bass twice, once for
no gain and once for a yard loss,
inside the ten, to stop two Tiger
touchdown drives.
Much to the surprise of all, the
Indians did not pass the ball as
much as they were expected to.
Stanford only passed 21 times in
the game, a low figure compared
to the other two games they have
played this season. The Cards
chose to run the ball, and run it
they did. They gained 156 yards
on the ground and 195 in the air,
a much better balanced attack
than the Indians have shown in
a couple of years.
Dick Norman, sensational In
dian passer, kept up his pace, as
he passed 19 times, completed 12
for 195 yards. Norman also gained
26 yards on the ground, for a

total of 221 yards. The Indians
showed great balance in their
running attack, as I hey had five
men gaining between 23 and 27
yards apiece. Skip Face gained
28, Norman and Mac Wylie, 2fi,
Rod Sears 27 and Gil Dowd, 23.
COP Worn Down
This was the running attack
jlhat wore down the COP team,
and was the big reason that the
Tigers were unable to complete
their drives late in the game, they
were just, plain tired. The Card
defense forced the Bengals to
grind out their gains at three or
four yards at a time, and this be
gan to tell on the Bengals in the
final period.
Stanford used two units and
they seemed to be of equal abil
ity, for they had about equal suc
cess in stopping the COP running
attack. Some relatively new faces
were big guns in the Stanford
defense. Fellows like Jack Gor
'don, a 6-2, 194-pounder, made 11
tackles on the afternoon. Gary
Leahy, a sophomore guard, put
the stop on nine Tiger ball car
riers. The old faces were in there,
too. Mac Wylie got 13 tackles,
Tom Walsh, a standout" soph
guard, got nine, Gary Pike got
ten, and Cap Ingham pulled down
seven.
Burford Connects
Chris Burford, All-American
end candidate, grabbed off three
of Norman's passes for a total of
63 yards. This brings the Stan
ford captain's season total to 17
catches in three games. Ben Rob
inson caught only one pass, but
he grabbed the ball and faked
three defenders out of their shoes,
setting up the first Stanford
score.
On the first play after Robin
son's fine run, Rick McMillen
took a pitchout from Norman and
streaked down the sideline for the
score. McMillen was helped out.
by a fine block by Mac Wylie,
who downed the only Bengal who
had a shot at McMillen, halfback
Herm Urenda. Skip Face split,
the uprights on the kick and the
Indians led COP 7-6, with 5:20
left in the first half.

NORMAN COLLARS BASS
Indian's Norman hooks Bass after the Tiger rambled
Stanford's Indians broke a six-game losing streak spread over two
seasons, by beating the College of, Pacific Tigers, 21-6 Saturday in
Stanford Stadium.
It was quite a victory for the Indians, for they stopped All Amci i
can halfback Bass almost completely in the second half, after the

fleet Tiger had gained 65 yards on |
seven carries and passed for 13
yards in the first period of the I
game. At the end of the game, !
Bass had gained only an addi
tional 45 yards.
The big plays of the game were
when the Indians stopped Bass
and Company twice inside the
Card ten-yard line. More than
this, the Stanford line cracked
through the Bengal forward wall
and stopped Bass twice, once for
no gain and once for a yard loss,
inside the ten, to stop two Tiger
touchdown drives.
Much to the surprise of all, the
Indians did not pass the ball as
much as they were expected to.
Stanford only passed 21 times in
the game, a low figure compared
to the other two games they have
played this season. The Cards
chose to run the ball, and run it
they did. They gained 156 yards
on the ground and 195 in the air,
a much better balanced attack
than the Indians have shown in
a couple of years.
Dick Norman, sensational In
dian passer, kept up his pace, as
he passed 19 times, completed 12
for 195 yards. Norman also gained
26 yards on the ground, for a

total of 221 yards. The Indians
showed great balance in their
running attack, as I hey had five
men gaining between 23 and 27
yards apiece. Skip Face gained
28, Norman and Mac Wylie, 2fi,
Rod Sears 27 and Gil Dowd, 23.
COP Worn Down
This was the running attack
jlhat wore down the COP team,
and was the big reason that the
Tigers were unable to complete
their drives late in the game, they
were just, plain tired. The Card
defense forced the Bengals to
grind out their gains at three or
four yards at a time, and this be
gan to tell on the Bengals in the
final period.
Stanford used two units and
they seemed to be of equal abil
ity, for they had about equal suc
cess in stopping the COP running
attack. Some relatively new faces
were big guns in the Stanford
defense. Fellows like Jack Gor
'don, a 6-2, 194-pounder, made 11

the game, a low figure compared
to the other two games they have
played this season. The Cards
chose to run the ball, and run it
they did. They gained 156 yards
on the ground and 195 in the air,
a much better balanced attack
than the Indians have shown in
a couple of years.
Dick Norman, sensational In
dian passer, kept up his pace, as
he passed 19 times, completed 12
for 195 yards. Norman also gained
26 yards on the ground, for a

total of 221 yards. The Indians
showed great balance in their
running attack, as I hey had five
men gaining between 23 and 27
yards apiece. Skip Face gained
28, Norman and Mac Wylie, 2fi,
Rod Sears 27 and Gil Dowd, 23.
COP Worn Down
This was the running attack
jlhat wore down the COP team,
and was the big reason that the
Tigers were unable to complete
their drives late in the game, they
were just, plain tired. The Card
defense forced the Bengals to
grind out their gains at three or
four yards at a time, and this be
gan to tell on the Bengals in the
final period.
Stanford used two units and
they seemed to be of equal abil
ity, for they had about equal suc
cess in stopping the COP running
attack. Some relatively new faces
were big guns in the Stanford
defense. Fellows like Jack Gor
'don, a 6-2, 194-pounder, made 11
tackles on the afternoon. Gary
Leahy, a sophomore guard, put
the stop on nine Tiger ball car
riers. The old faces were in there,
too. Mac Wylie got 13 tackles,
Tom Walsh, a standout" soph
guard, got nine, Gary Pike got
ten, and Cap Ingham pulled down
seven.
Burford Connects
Chris Burford, All-American
end candidate, grabbed off three
of Norman's passes for a total of
63 yards. This brings the Stan
ford captain's season total to 17
catches in three games. Ben Rob
inson caught only one pass, but
he grabbed the ball and faked
three defenders out of their shoes,
setting up the first Stanford
score.
On the first play after Robin
son's fine run, Rick McMillen
took a pitchout from Norman and
streaked down the sideline for the
score. McMillen was helped out.
by a fine block by Mac Wylie,
who downed the only Bengal who
had a shot at McMillen, halfback
Herm Urenda. Skip Face split,
the uprights on the kick and the
Indians led COP 7-6, with 5:20
left in the first half.
COP—First Blood
The Bengals had drawn first
blood in the game when Hank
Wallace, hard driving fullback,
plunged over from the one, to
give the Tigers their only score
of the game. From then on the
Bengals were unable to sustain

The Indians struck again half
way into the fourth period. After 1
the Indians had recovered a COP |
fumble on the Tiger 26-yard line, |
Wylie skirted left end for 13
yards and a first down, and then
Norman passed to Irv Nikolai,
who made a great diving catch in
the end zone for the score.
Face kicked the PAT. and the
Indians led 14-6, with four min
utes left in the game. Then COP
went into a spread formation,
and in desperation began throw

ing the ball, but to no avail. The
Indians took the ball over on
downs and went on for their third
and final score of the afternoon.
Norman passed to Burford for 17,
1 then Archie Schmitt cracked the
center of the line for three and
! I lien plunged over for the tally.
Then he kicked the PAT, and the
Cards led 21-6.
Again COP went into their
spread formation and began
throwing desperation passes, but
could not punch the hall over for
the score. And the Indians had
their first win in the last seven
starts, and the third for Coach
Jack Curtice at Stanford.
