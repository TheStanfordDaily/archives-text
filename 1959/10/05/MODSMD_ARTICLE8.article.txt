Before the aclual filming the
audience was warmed up by Al
len Ludden, the panel moderator,
and Jack Leary, producer, and in
structed to "respond" to the show.
Leary especially requested the au
dience to be fair and applaud both
Stanford and Oregon.
Choice
The audience had a choice of !
watching the actual participants!
through a tangle of three televi
sion cameras and ten technicians
or on the two monitoring sets
placed on the edge of the stage.
Only the parts of the program ac
tually produced on Dinkelspiel
stage were visible to the audience.
Both the commercials and a short
address by Arthur S. Fleming,
Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare, were filmed else
where.
The contest was run like a foot
ball game, each "half" opening
with a referee's whistle. The mod
erator read a toss-up question
that an individual on either team
could answer for ten points. Then
the team which answered the
question correctly was given a
chance to earn bonus points on
questions directed to their team
only. The questioning was based
on snap answers and no lime was
allowed for thinking or discus
sion.
Every Field
The questions covered almost
every field of knowledge: art, lit
erature, current events, math, pol
itics, sports and â€¢science. They
ranged from a Roman speech to
"Anatomy of Murder" and "Lady
Chatterley's Lover." Sad Sam
Jones of the Giants, Khrushchev,
pioneer trails, birds and Mary
Queen of Scots were also subjects
of questions.

Stanford contestants were cho
sen by a faculty committee acting
upon recommendations from Uni
versity departments; the finalists
were picked after interviews with
faculty members. According to
Del Simenson, the only girl on the
Stanford team, the panel mem
bers were told to prepare by read
ing anthologies and play plots,
but that most of the questions
would be from basic knowledge
and awareness of current events.
The same Stanford participants
will compete next week against
Loyola, but Fran Huneke, Dan
Kremer, Oscar Moyle, Dave
Quarles, Bill Sterling and Cliff
Terry are standing by as alter
nates in case any of them cannot
participate.
