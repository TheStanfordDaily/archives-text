### Austin Scott 
The target date for completion
of Stanford's new Bookstore-Post
Office is Nov. 15, according to
Chuck Rhamy, job supervisor.
Although it may not look like it,
only about six weeks of work re
mains to be done.
Construction on the two newest
additions to Stanford's physical
plant was started March 16.
There was a short delay when of
ficials found that costs were go
ing to be higher than anticipated.
The buildings will continue the
tradition of buff walls and red
tile roofs. Both will contain large
expanses of glass. The Bookstore
has several floor-to-roof glass pan

els, and the upper portion of the
Post Office walls will be glass.
The Bookstore will have one
main floor and a second - story
mezzanine. The departments will
remain the same, but will be en
larged. The general book depart
ment, along with the textbook sec
tion, will take up the entire mez
zanine and will carry a complete
line of paperbacks in addition to
an enlarged selection of cloth
bound books.
If the buildings are completed
on schedule, the Bookstore will
i*begin Transferring stock to the
new building just after the winter
quarter rush. They hope to bo
completely moved in by the begin
ning of spring quarter.
Freshman Store
The special freshman store, set
up each autumn quarter at Engi
neering Corner, and the business
and law stores will be incorpo
rated into the new building. The
Medical School store, however,
will remain in the Medical School
building. This branch carries a
complete line of medical texts
and reference books.
A self-service policy to be in
augurated once the new store is
open should get rid of the tradi
tional Bookstore lines. Students
will be allowed to pick up their
own merchandise, and will bring
it to a check-out counter near the
exit. Textbooks will also be se
lected in this way.
Arcade Columns
Several unusual construction
techniques have been employed
in the new buildings. The roofs
of both are supported by large
concrete beams, which in turn are
supported only at the ends by the
arcade columns. The stairway to
the mezzanine in the Bookstore
will be cantilevered from the
ground floor. The mezzanine it
self will be supported only by ihe
arcade columns, which are entire
ly outside the store. Both build
ings will be completely air-condi
tioned.
The now Post Office will have
more than 4000 post-office boxes.
These will be placed on three
walls around the outside of the
building under the arcades. They
will be reached from the outside.
With the exception of a counter
just inside the front door, the en
tile inside area will be used only
by employees of the Post Office.
The counter will accommodate as
many as four clerks.
No General Delivery
Once the new building is in use.
there will be no more general de
livery. All persons will receive
mail at their residences or will
have post-office boxes.
The two buildings are part of a

multi â€¢ million - dollar Student Ac
tivity Center proposed by the
University. The other buildings
will be Dinkelspiel and Tresidder
Memorial Union.
No use has been set for the old
buildings once the move to new
quarters has been made.
The new buildings will cost the
University $487,000. The cost will
be paid with endowment money,
and the Bookstore Corporation
and the Post Of/ice Department
will lease the buildings from the
University.
