(Editor's Note: Though for
mal dedication and opening
ceremonies of Stanford Medi
cal Center have passed as up
to-the-minute news stories, the
over-all opening and first year
of the Med Center makes up
one continuing story. To fur
nish background material to
this story, The Daily presents
the first of a three-part series

011 Stanford's Med Center. Au
thor Steve Raffrey is highly
familiar with the Center after
a summer of work as an assist
ant information officer at the
Center's news bureau.

The hubbub, headaches, and
j hard work of dedicating Stan-1

ford's beautiful $22 million Medi
cal Center have mostly been as
pi rined away now.
Still, what this Center is, what
it means to Stanford, and sundry
items of information about it
should be of interest to Stanford
students in order that they might
take pride in and know of this
Center.

Let's start with bare facts —but
interesting ones.
The Center was built at a cost
of $22 million. It covers .% acres,
and contains 1(5 acres of floor
space (labs, offices, etc.). Seven
buildings — three hospital and
four medical school — comprise
the Center.
The Center contains the Stan
ford University School of Medi
cine and the Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital. A "central core" con
tains facilities such as X-ray di
agnosis and therapy equipment,
clinical laboratories, kitchen and
central supply room which serve
both of the major components.
Internationally renowned archi
tect Edward D. Stone designed
the Center. He is additionally
famous for designs of Ihe Ameri
can Embassy in New Delhi, India,
and the American Pavilion at the
Brussels World's Fair.
In case you are interested in
the philosophy of the swastika
like design of the Center, Stone
terms it a "modern interpreta
tion" of the existing, older sand
stone architecture of the main
quad.
The big hanging dishes sur
rounding the Center house re
flecting lights (both upward and
downward) and also "hanging
gardens" (when mother nature
adds life and length to what is
in them).
Thomas D. Church of San Fran
cisco is the landscape architect.
Modern, beautiful fountains
decorate the front of the Center
- and are normally lit at night—
