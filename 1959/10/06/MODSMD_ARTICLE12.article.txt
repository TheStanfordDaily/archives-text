PALM SPRINGS, Calif. UV)
President Eisenhower Monday
called both the steel and dock
strikes detrimental to the United
States. He insisted on behalf of
the American people that the
shutdowns be ended fast.
Eisenhower spoke out through
an aide as:
1. The five-day-old East and
Gulf Coast strike, which has tied
up shipping piers from Maine to
Texas, was put officially before
the President by Secretary of
Labor James P. Mitchell. The
President's vacation headquar
ters here declined comment, on re
ports from Washington that Ei
senhower shortly would invoke
injunction provisions of the Taft-
Hartley law.
2. The Wage Policy Committee
of the Steelworkers Union re
jected the latest management
proposals for settlement of the
83-day-old steel strike.
In discussing the two shut
downs, White House press secre
tary James C. Ilagerty told a
news conference here:
"The President believes these
two strikes are detrimental to
the United States and the Ameri
can people, and he believes the
American people want both of
them settled and settled fast."
Although the dock strike has
been under way only five days
as compared To the 83 days the
steel strike has been running, the
government, is understood to re
gard the dock tie-up as the more
urgent matter.
That shutdown caught ship
pers unprepared and losses in
perishable commodities have been
heavy. The economic impact has
flooded Washington with de
mands for government action.
