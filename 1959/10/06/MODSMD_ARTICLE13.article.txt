UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (/I'j
The United Arab Republic ac
cused Israel Monday of raising a
fake crisis in the United Nations
over freedom of navigation in the
Suez Canal.
Mahmoud Fawzi, U.A.R. for
eign minister, told the 82-nation
General Assembly the issue
would "melt away and automati
cally disappear" if Israel recog
nized the legitimate rights of
more than a million Palestine
Arab refugees.
Ambassador Arthur Lourie,
head of the Israeli delegation, im
mediately challenged Fawzi to
tell the Assembly whether the
U.A.R. is willing lo negotiate a
settlement of the entire Palestine
problem.
He said Israel is ready lo ne
gotiate "at any time and place
without attaching any condi
tions." He described the U.A.R.
position as a "maze of contradic
tions" and added: "Having failed
on the field of battle, they now
say they are entitled to maintain
against us a onesided state ot
war."
