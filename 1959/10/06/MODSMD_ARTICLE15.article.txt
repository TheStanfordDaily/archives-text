# The 						Trouble with Tuesday

... is that it comes so early in
flu* week.
The first of the year with the
traditional fresh, young and eager
faces of incoming freshmen shin
ing, with enthusiasm, trepidation
and expectation probably isn't the
time for a story like this.
But all upperclassmen know
that the freshmen need as much
help as they can get, so the point
of this story, in case you miss it
later on, is how to succeed in this
great, wide world.
The secret:
Raise enough tain at Stan
ford that you get kicked out
alter three years.
A simple enough plan and two
men whom 1 met in my summer
work in the wilds of Central Ore
gon followed this formula. One
of them did come back to finish
his education and the other didn't.
And the one who didn't has a
higher yearly income than the
one who did, although the one
who did may be the better invest
ment if you follow me this far.
The one who didn't adds about
$15U,0()() to his bank account each
year. He's Richard Boone, the
Paladin of "Have Gun, Will Tra
vel" fame.
Boone spent about two weeks
in Central Oregon shooting
shows for this television season.
When 1 got to him, he was wait
ing for the "sunny Oregon sky"
to clear of rain clouds. It didn't.
So we talked. And having been
to Stanford didn't seem to have
hurt him a bit.
Boone's Stanford career back
in the '3(J's sounded like a lively
one. On one occasion he and some
of his Theta Xi brothers made a
dummy and put it out in one of
the campus streets. Who should
come driving along but Mrs. Her
bert Hoover and one of the other
distinguished matrons of the
campus.
When these sedate ladies ran

over the dummy, Boone and
his friends rushed out yelling,
"You've killed our brother."
Mrs. Hoover got so upset she
tripped and sprained her ankle.
The Theta Xi's were on proba
tion for quite awhile.
The other man, also at Stan
ford in the '30's, finally received
a degree in 1953 after serving
in the Pacific during World
War 11.
He now is publisher of Central
Oregon's Daily newspaper, the
Bend Bulletin, and has interests
in other 1 newspapers.
He didn't go into detail as to
how he happened to take a leave
of absence from Stanford, but his
present-day passion for injecting
life into the sleepy town of Bend
suggests what spirit dwelt in a
19-year-old lad.
One thing he tells is how
when he returned to Stanford
he had about 30 Con Home
hours to work out. Even though
the Dean of Men who pushed
the eject button more than a
decade before was no longer
with the University, those Con
Home hours were.
Chandler worked them out, too,
even though he got: into some
poison oak right at the beginning.
So maybe there should be a
postscript to the success formula:
When you are asked to leave
after three years, don't come
back, unless poison oak doesn't
bother you.
Seen at Saturday's football
game:
When Ed White was encour
aging the card section with
"Wave those babies," some en
thusiastic father did.
After the game, a Stanford
woman, probably a freshman be
cause she had a feather in her
hair 1 , was asked to join the ranks
of the famous by signing a little
girl's autograph book.

suggests what spirit dwelt in a
19-year-old lad.
One thing he tells is how
when he returned to Stanford
he had about 30 Con Home
hours to work out. Even though
the Dean of Men who pushed
the eject button more than a
decade before was no longer
with the University, those Con
Home hours were.
Chandler worked them out, too,
even though he got: into some
poison oak right at the beginning.
So maybe there should be a
postscript to the success formula:
When you are asked to leave
after three years, don't come
back, unless poison oak doesn't
bother you.
Seen at Saturday's football
game:
When Ed White was encour
aging the card section with
"Wave those babies," some en
thusiastic father did.
After the game, a Stanford
woman, probably a freshman be
cause she had a feather in her
hair 1 , was asked to join the ranks
of the famous by signing a little
girl's autograph book.
... is that it comes so early in
flu* week.
The first of the year with the
traditional fresh, young and eager
faces of incoming freshmen shin
ing, with enthusiasm, trepidation
and expectation probably isn't the
time for a story like this.
But all upperclassmen know
that the freshmen need as much
help as they can get, so the point
of this story, in case you miss it
later on, is how to succeed in this
great, wide world.
The secret:
Raise enough tain at Stan
ford that you get kicked out
alter three years.
A simple enough plan and two
men whom 1 met in my summer
work in the wilds of Central Ore
gon followed this formula. One
of them did come back to finish
his education and the other didn't.
And the one who didn't has a
higher yearly income than the
one who did, although the one
who did may be the better invest
ment if you follow me this far.
The one who didn't adds about
$15U,0()() to his bank account each
year. He's Richard Boone, the
Paladin of "Have Gun, Will Tra
vel" fame.
Boone spent about two weeks
in Central Oregon shooting
shows for this television season.
When 1 got to him, he was wait
ing for the "sunny Oregon sky"
to clear of rain clouds. It didn't.
So we talked. And having been
to Stanford didn't seem to have
hurt him a bit.
Boone's Stanford career back
in the '3(J's sounded like a lively
one. On one occasion he and some
of his Theta Xi brothers made a
dummy and put it out in one of
the campus streets. Who should
come driving along but Mrs. Her
bert Hoover and one of the other
distinguished matrons of the
campus.
When these sedate ladies ran

over the dummy, Boone and
his friends rushed out yelling,
"You've killed our brother."
Mrs. Hoover got so upset she
tripped and sprained her ankle.
The Theta Xi's were on proba
tion for quite awhile.
The other man, also at Stan
ford in the '30's, finally received
a degree in 1953 after serving
in the Pacific during World
War 11.
He now is publisher of Central
Oregon's Daily newspaper, the
Bend Bulletin, and has interests
in other 1 newspapers.
He didn't go into detail as to
how he happened to take a leave
of absence from Stanford, but his
present-day passion for injecting
life into the sleepy town of Bend
suggests what spirit dwelt in a

dummy and put it out in one of
the campus streets. Who should
come driving along but Mrs. Her
bert Hoover and one of the other
distinguished matrons of the
campus.
When these sedate ladies ran

over the dummy, Boone and
his friends rushed out yelling,
"You've killed our brother."
Mrs. Hoover got so upset she
tripped and sprained her ankle.
The Theta Xi's were on proba

The other man, also at Stan
ford in the '30's, finally received
a degree in 1953 after serving
in the Pacific during World
War 11.
He now is publisher of Central
Oregon's Daily newspaper, the
Bend Bulletin, and has interests
in other 1 newspapers.
He didn't go into detail as to
how he happened to take a leave
of absence from Stanford, but his
present-day passion for injecting
life into the sleepy town of Bend
suggests what spirit dwelt in a
19-year-old lad.
One thing he tells is how
when he returned to Stanford
he had about 30 Con Home
hours to work out. Even though
the Dean of Men who pushed
the eject button more than a
decade before was no longer
with the University, those Con
Home hours were.
Chandler worked them out, too,
even though he got: into some
poison oak right at the beginning.
So maybe there should be a
postscript to the success formula:
When you are asked to leave
after three years, don't come
back, unless poison oak doesn't
bother you.
Seen at Saturday's football
game:
When Ed White was encour
aging the card section with
"Wave those babies," some en
thusiastic father did.
After the game, a Stanford
woman, probably a freshman be
cause she had a feather in her
hair 1 , was asked to join the ranks
of the famous by signing a little
girl's autograph book.
