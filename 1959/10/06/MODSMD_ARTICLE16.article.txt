On Sept. 16 Mr. K. had just ar- i
rived in Washington and it was
impossible for most of us to pay
serious attention to anything I
else. Yet on that date Gen. de
Gaulle made public his policy and
plan for dealing with the Alge
rian question. We can now pay
serious attention to what he said,
and it is quite evident that it will
be long remembered.
For in his address lie look
Hie decisive step without which
(here could be no hope of put
ting an end to the bitter and
bloody civil war. He accepted
the principle of self-determina
tion by an open and equal elec
tion to be observed by the
world.
The acceptance of this principle
is, of course, only the first step
towards a satisfactory solution of
the problem. But without that
first step no solution was pos
sible.
In these elections the Algerians
will have three choices. They can
secede and set up as an independ
ent state. They can vote to be
come an integral part of metro
politan France.
Or they can choose autonomy
by departments, more or less in
the manner of the Swiss can
tons, within the economic, fi
nancial, and political structure
of the recently formed French
< ommunity. This Community
now consists of France itself
and twelve republics in Africa
and Madagascar.
It is this third choice that Gen.
de Gaulle hopes the Algerians
will make. But the Algerians are
free to choose either of the other
two options. And it is freedom to
choose independence which has
transformed radically the Alge
rian question. The Algerians do
not have to fight a war of inde
pendence. If independence is
what they want, they can have
it by their own free vote and by
a ratifying vote by the French.
As long as the option of inde
pendence did not exist, it was
impossible for the United States
to give public support to the Al
gerian policy of the preceding
French governments.
This situation has been altered
completely by Gen. de Gaulle's

| offer of self-determination. From
now on our position is bound to
be, while we avoid meddling, to
encourage tho effort to work out
| practically the program he has
proposed, and to use what influ
ence we may have to support the
Arabs, who, like M. Bourguiba of
Tunisia, are working for a policy
of moderation and conciliation.
It would not be proper for the
United States government to give
official support to any of the
three options on which the Alge
j rians will vote.
But Americans can in their
private capacity say what they
are sure to think: that the best
future lies in the third optionâ€”
autonomy within the French
Community. It is best for the
European settlers in Algeria,
for the Moslem masses, for the
neighbors of Algeria in Tunisia
and Morocco, for the stability
I and prosperity of North frica
and of the Western Mediterra
nean.
For Algeria alone does not have
the resources and the technology
to provide a decent future for its
excessively large population. But
the French Community does have
the resources and the technology.
It is significant that the critics
of the plan have not questioned
the good faith of Gen. de Gaulle
and his government. If it were
needed, there is impressive evi
dence of his good faith in the
record, as described to the Gen
eral Assembly yesterday by the
French Foreign Minister, M.
Couve de Murville, the record of
the building of the French Com
munity.
It is not too soon to say that in
his handling of the problem of
the transfiguration of the old
French empire. Gen. de Gaulle has
shown those qualities which mark
him as one of the truly great men
of our era. There is here again
ihe old largeness of mind, the old
magnanimity of temper, the old
penetrating intuition of human
nature, and the old elegance of
style which distinguishes great
men from lesser men.
No one can be sure that he will
succeed. But one can be sure that
he deserves to succeed,
