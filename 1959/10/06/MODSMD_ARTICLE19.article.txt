# Russ-Chinese Atmosphere May Be Forerunner of Split

The cool atmosphere which
surrounded Soviet Premier Ni
kita Khrushchev's visit to Peiping
leads naturally to speculation as
to whether the years-long predic
tions of an eventual split may be
coming true.
Ever since the Communist
conquest of China, students of
Sino-Soviet affairs have dis
cussed the possibility that Tito
ism might eventually find its
greatest converts in Peiping.
Not only did the Chinese Reds
set up their own school of Com
munist theoreticians. Holders of
the theory of eventual separate
ness relied heavily on tendencies
which were more Chinese than
Communist. They did not believe
Soviet and Chinese cooperation
could be maintained permanently
in tire light of traditional differ
ences.
Now Peiping is paying only the
briefest lip service to Khrush
chev's peace offensive. Even
while he has been talking to them
about fostering peaceful coexist
ence, they have been renewing
their pledge to take Formosa by
force if necessary. They have con
tinued their military activities on
the Indian border, an area of dis
pute where the Soviet Union spe
cifically asked for negotiation in
stead of force.
Khrushchev was received in
Peiping with little fanfare and
departed without any. When he
spoke of the peace offensive, he
did not even pretend to speak
for the eirtire Communist
sphere, as usual, but only for
the Soviet sphere and people.
Mao Tze-tung and Chou En-lai
joined him in no statement of
joint purposes.
Whereas once the talk of an
eventual separateness between
Moscow and Peiping was cheer
ing to the West, it is now omi
nous. At a time when the Soviet
Union is seeking at least a tem

porary armistice, a cloud of pro
spective aggresion throws its
shadow all across Asia.
The whole business could l>e
merely a Communist posturing
in which Mao and Khrushchev
understand each other. They
would be cooperating to demon
strate that, as the West seeks
peace, it cannot hope for success
without recognition of the impor
tance of Communist China.
