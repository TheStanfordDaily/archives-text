## 
### Judy Levin 
"A core of people who have
common ideals and direction" is
Ihe basis of a peace movement
on a college campus, Robert
Pickus stated last night in a
speech before the Socialist cau
cus of the Political Union.
Once the essential group of in
terested people have formed, an
organized program can follow,
he pointed out. Pickus is execu
tive secretary of Acts for Peace,
a California organization dedi
cated to an action program.
Students who are concerned
with a pcace movement can,
through the Political Union, help
to spread the idea on campus by
means of college media, films
and literature.
Mi*. Pickus mentioned the need
for a more adequate alternative
to the Communist threat than the
dominantly military response
which has pervaded our foreign
policy in the last ten years.
Ho added that support of the
Cnited N'ations as the center of
world community and law, and a
greater response to the social
and economic challenge of the
times were some of the points to
be included in a sound approach
to the problem of peace today.
