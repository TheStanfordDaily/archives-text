WASHINGTON (/P) America
still lags behind the Soviet Union
in rockets for space projects but
in the "life and death" field of
intercontinental ballistic missiles
she's climbed close to her rival.
That was the word Monday
from the Defense Department's
top scientist, Dr. Herbert York.
York indicated it might take at
least a year for the United States
to duplicate the Soviet's present
effort of hur ling a 600-pound sat
ellite towards the moon. The rea
son: America's most powerful
booster for space rockets has only
about half the thrust power of
the booster believed used by the
Soviets.
