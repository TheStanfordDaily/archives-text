What Do You Say
"Well, what do you say Mr. Athletic Director when you win one,"
quipped Stanford's head grid mentor Jack Curtice to assistant ath
letic director Chuck Taylor in the locker - room Saturday alter the
Cards' first win oi' the season. This summed up Coach Curtice's
obvious pleasure with his first win, which saw the Tribe contain the
CO!* breakaway backs Dick Bass and Henry Wallace and win it 21 (5.
Coach Curtice was especially pleased with sophomore tackle Jack
Cordon and soph end Ceorge llonore's per formance. Cordon was a
third string lineman on the lrosh team last year but came in and
helped to fill in the gap at tackle when Dean llinshaw was lost via

an injury.
The Athletic Department wa.l
pleased with the work of thel
Rally Com led by Ed White, the
band headed by llarvey limit and
coordinator Steve Baffrey for a
job well done dui'ing the hall
time show. Athletic Director Tay
lor appreciated -their fine cooper
ation and said he received many
complimentary comments on the
show.
Another intricate and impor
tant part of the Stanford football
games is the seating arrange
ments for the fans. A new look
this year in visiting student sec
tion may bring a lot of howls
from the rooters from neighbor
ing California schools.
For when our visitors from
San Jose, UCLA and Cal come to
The Farm they will find that their
rooting section is not on their 50-
yard line, but instead they will
sit from the 30-yard line in and
most will end up in the end /.one

sections.
Chuck Taylor explains that a new "gentlemen's agreement" with
1 he four California schools in the AAYVU states that the home school
will keep its old sections on the 5(1 but they will give their 50-yard
spots on the other side of the field to season ticket holders in order
to "induce more sales."
Taylor went on to explain that in the liitf Ten the visitors nearly
always end up behind the goal posts and that "we certainly don't
plan to resort to that." But even though Card fans won't be 1 hurt
let's hope we can see the field from our rooting section down in
too much this year San Jose, I'CI.A and Cal are all home games,
the Coliseum ;it the U.S.C. game.
More After Effects
More after effects. Although there was general glee in the Stan
ford camp after the fine victory over COP, Tiger head coach Jack
.Meyers looked very tired after last Saturday's contest.
However, the genial .'Meyers proved himself a much better gentle
man in defeat than a certain losing counterpart from Ohio State.
It seems that the controversial coach Woody Hayes did not like a
sportwriter's comment about his team after SC's fine victory last
Friday night. So for the third time he took a swing at the writer
and hit a passerby, which was reminiscent of the swing he took
at a local writer after Stanford's 6-0 victory here in 1955.
This is one writer who hopes the Buckeyes will pick up that
"fighting spirit" of their coach in their next game as I just lost a
good bet against the Trojans last weekend.
