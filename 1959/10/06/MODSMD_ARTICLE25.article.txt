###

against the California Bears on Saturday at Berkeley.
That was the word from Notre Dame publicist Charlie Callahan
at Monday's meeting of the Northern California Football Writers

and Broadcasters Assn.
it did nothing to inflate the
hopes of California's Pete Elliott
| who already had been delayed by
a flat tire en route to the meeting.
l/o and Mack both suffered
twisted knees in a drill on Sept. 9
and haven't seen game action
| either in the 2S-8 victory over-
North Carolina or the 28-7 loss to
Purdue last Saturday.
Elliott declared "some real bad
plays" helped beat his Bears at
i Austin where Texas grabbed a
i 33-0 victory.
1 and 2
California beat Washington
State to open the season and then
lost to lowa before meeting Tex
i as.
Elliott said tackle .Roland Lash
eV was out with a sprained ankle
and quarterback Larry Parque
probably won't play because of a
i dislocated shoulder. Quarterback
Wayne Crow and center Terry
! Jones, who both suffered ankle
injuries, are expected to play.
Sophomore Pete Olson will get
a chance to show his ability at
quarterback against Notre Dame
! while Ken Meade and Jim Gianu
lias also may see service at that
spot.
Stanford Coach Jack Curtice,
whose Indians beat COP and meet
undefeated Washington at Seat
tle on Saturday, termed defense
his biggest problem.
Northern Invasion

vade this area with Oregon play
ing at San Jose State Friday

so Oregon doesn't overpower us,"
said Titchenal whose team won
