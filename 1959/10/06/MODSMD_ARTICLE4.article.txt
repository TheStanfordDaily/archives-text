Capt. Midnight ticketed a
Stanford fire truck and the
County Fire Marshal's car for
parking in the pedestrian zone
in front of the bookstore at 10
a.m. yesterday.
Firemen were making a spe
cial check at the bookstore at
the time.
As Midnight slipped the tick
ets under the windshield wip
ers, he was reportedly grinning
gleefully.
Informed sources disclosed
that the Captain is bucking for
promotion.
