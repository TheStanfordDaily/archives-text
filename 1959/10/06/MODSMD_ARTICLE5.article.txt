# Ike: 'Steel, Dock Strikes Are Detrimental to U.S.'
## Steel Proposals Rejected; Negotiations Near Collapse 
### 
PITTSBURGH (/P> Negotia
tions in the 83-day old steel strike
appeared to be on the verge of
collapse last night.
After the United Steelworkers
earlier yesterday had rejected an
industry proposal to end the
strike, an extraordinary night
session was called. It lasted only
five minutes.
David J. McDonald, president
of the USW, called for the night
session — first held since the
strike started in July.
McDonald asked that the prin
cipals of the industry—leaders of
12 major companies—be invited
to participate. None were on
hand when the meeting began,
only the four negotiators from
each side.
The United Steelworkers flatly
rejected a new contract offer-
Monday afternoon.
Despite the renewed bargain
ing, there were strong indications
President Eisenhower would have
to use the Taft-Hartley Act to
end the costly dispute.
Here's what happened:
The USYV's 170-ftiember Wage
Policy Committee turned down

the industry proposal as "com
pletely unsatisfactory." The vote
was unanimous.
Industry negotiators lifted a
news blackout and said its offer
amounted to a 15-cent hourly
package increase over a two-year
period.
The union issued a statement
placing the worth of the proposal
at 10.2 cents an hour for the two
years.
"Such an economic package
would be unacceptable to the
St eel workers even if you did not
attach further conditions to it
which are themselves totally un
acceptable," it added.
This was a reference to an in
dustry demand for changes in
local plant working rules.
About three hours after the
union rejection, McDonald and R.
Conrad Cooper, chief industry
representative, led their negotiat
ing teams back to the bargaining
table.

The industry's latest offer was
to improve pension, insurance and
supplemental unemployment ben
efits in the first year of a two
year agreement, and to increase
wage ranges in the second year
by 6 to 12 cents an hour.
At Palm Springs, Calif., vaca
tioning President Eisenhower re
emphasized his plea for swift set
tlement of the strike. He said the
dispute is detrimental to the
United States and the American
people.
The President seems sure to i
invoke emergency provisions of |
the labor law if the strike con-1
tinues much longer. The question ,
is how soon.

strike started in July.
McDonald asked that the prin
cipals of the industry—leaders of
12 major companies—be invited
to participate. None were on
hand when the meeting began,
only the four negotiators from
each side.
The United Steelworkers flatly
rejected a new contract offer-
Monday afternoon.
Despite the renewed bargain
ing, there were strong indications
President Eisenhower would have
to use the Taft-Hartley Act to
end the costly dispute.
Here's what happened:
The USYV's 170-ftiember Wage
Policy Committee turned down

the industry proposal as "com
pletely unsatisfactory." The vote
was unanimous.
Industry negotiators lifted a
news blackout and said its offer
amounted to a 15-cent hourly
package increase over a two-year
period.
The union issued a statement
placing the worth of the proposal
at 10.2 cents an hour for the two
years.
"Such an economic package
would be unacceptable to the
St eel workers even if you did not
attach further conditions to it
which are themselves totally un
acceptable," it added.
This was a reference to an in
dustry demand for changes in
local plant working rules.
About three hours after the
union rejection, McDonald and R.
Conrad Cooper, chief industry
representative, led their negotiat
ing teams back to the bargaining
table.

The industry's latest offer was
to improve pension, insurance and
supplemental unemployment ben
efits in the first year of a two
year agreement, and to increase
wage ranges in the second year
by 6 to 12 cents an hour.
At Palm Springs, Calif., vaca
tioning President Eisenhower re
emphasized his plea for swift set
tlement of the strike. He said the
dispute is detrimental to the
United States and the American
people.
The President seems sure to i
invoke emergency provisions of |
the labor law if the strike con-1
tinues much longer. The question ,
is how soon.
PITTSBURGH (/P> Negotia
tions in the 83-day old steel strike
appeared to be on the verge of
collapse last night.
After the United Steelworkers
earlier yesterday had rejected an
industry proposal to end the
strike, an extraordinary night
session was called. It lasted only
five minutes.
David J. McDonald, president
of the USW, called for the night
session — first held since the
strike started in July.
