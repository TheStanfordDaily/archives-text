# REDESIGNED CURRICULUM
## 'Whole Doctor' Is Med School's Aim

(Editor's Note: This is the second in a three-part article on Stan
lord's new $22 million Medical Center. The series is designed to
help Stanford students become familiar with the campus' newest j
structure and what goes on inside its walls.)

One hundred years ago last month M.D. degrees were conferred
on I lie first two students to graduate from a medical school in the
West. The school was the Cooper Medical College, founded by Dr.
Samuel Elias Cooper, in San Francisco.
In the last 10(3 years much has happened to that school —in the

| way of number and caliber of
j graduates, and even location.
N'ow the Stanford University
I School of Medicine, this school
will graduate, in this year and
years to come, members of the
medical profession on whom the
eyes of the professional and edu
cational greats in this country
will focus.
New Plan
Coincident with the 'move of
the Medical School from anti
quated and terribly inadequate
quarters in San Francisco last
month came the institution of a
new plan for education in mcdi
cine.
The decision to move the School
was made by the Stanford Board
of Trustees in 1953 in a desire "to
relocate the school and join in
struction of the basic sciences
and clinical medicine on campus
in a university setting."
The new educational plan calls
for admission of a student to the
medical "school after the third
year of undergraduate study.
Completion of the requirements
for the M.D. degree normally fol
lows in five years after admission.
The redesigned curriculum
views the eight years of study
between high school and the M.D.
degree as a whole, rather than in
the usual perspective of four col
lege years and four in medical
school.
Medical students will complete
requirements for the bachelor's
degree during the first three of
the five medical school years. In
this way, it is hoped, non medical
talents and interests will be de
veloped alongside medical apti
tudes.
Those educators who designed
the new curriculum noted the
widespread specialization which
has plagued medicine. According
to these men, a diminished under
standing of the "whole patient"
has been the result.
"Whole Doctor," Too
The plan, then, seeks to help
the new doctor to understand this
"whole patient" by pointing out
lhat one must understand more
than just diseases, germs, viruses,
technical equipment, body tem
peratures and the like.
And along with a considered
effort to help these future doc
tors better understand that
"whole patient" comes the effort
to, in effect, educate the "whole
doctor" by allowing him to in
clude non-medical and scientific
courses in his program
Principles of medicine are
stressed in the new Stanford cur
riculum leather than detailed mas
tery of each subject or technique.
For example, "multidiscipline
courses" in Basic Medical Sci
ences combine anatomy, biochem
istry, microbiology, pathology,
pharmacology and physiology in
one study cooperatively conduct

ed by the six departments. Lec
ures and lab work are coordi
nated.
Previously, medical students
mastered each subject separately
and had to work out interrela
tionships themselves.
A unique adjunct of the new
jurriculum is the "multidiscipline
laboratory" feature. These labs
serve 16 students as "home bases"
for a full year, with each student
assigned to one desk to which ho
has access at any time.
No longer will Stanford medi
cal students scuttle from lab to
lab carting all his notebooks
and equipment with him as he
goes.
Along with the admission of
approximately sixty-two medical
students each year (this year the
number was 75), some 100 nurs
ing students are accepted for ihe
Stanford School of Nursing, also
housed in the new Medical Cen
ter.
Student Facilities
Student facilities in the Center
now rank as the nation's most
modern. Most of the laboratories
and pieces of equipment are the
newest available.
Classrooms, for instance, are
all of the theater-seat type, acous
tically designed to provide maxi
mum efficiency. Most are fully
equipped with movie screens and
project ion equipment.
A student lounge, hinted to be
a "dating bureau" of sorts, rests
between medical school and nurs
ing school facilities and has a
snack bar, music, and other com
forts few other student lounges
here have.

on I lie first two students to graduate from a medical school in the
West. The school was the Cooper Medical College, founded by Dr.
Samuel Elias Cooper, in San Francisco.
In the last 10(3 years much has happened to that school —in the

| way of number and caliber of
j graduates, and even location.
N'ow the Stanford University
I School of Medicine, this school
will graduate, in this year and
years to come, members of the
medical profession on whom the
eyes of the professional and edu
cational greats in this country
will focus.
New Plan
Coincident with the 'move of
the Medical School from anti
quated and terribly inadequate
quarters in San Francisco last
month came the institution of a
new plan for education in mcdi
cine.
The decision to move the School
was made by the Stanford Board
of Trustees in 1953 in a desire "to
relocate the school and join in
struction of the basic sciences
and clinical medicine on campus
in a university setting."
The new educational plan calls
for admission of a student to the
medical "school after the third
year of undergraduate study.
Completion of the requirements
for the M.D. degree normally fol
lows in five years after admission.
The redesigned curriculum
views the eight years of study
between high school and the M.D.
degree as a whole, rather than in
the usual perspective of four col
lege years and four in medical
school.
Medical students will complete
requirements for the bachelor's
degree during the first three of
the five medical school years. In
this way, it is hoped, non medical
talents and interests will be de
veloped alongside medical apti
tudes.
Those educators who designed
the new curriculum noted the
widespread specialization which
has plagued medicine. According
to these men, a diminished under
standing of the "whole patient"
has been the result.
"Whole Doctor," Too
The plan, then, seeks to help
the new doctor to understand this
"whole patient" by pointing out
lhat one must understand more
than just diseases, germs, viruses,
technical equipment, body tem
peratures and the like.
And along with a considered
effort to help these future doc
tors better understand that
"whole patient" comes the effort
to, in effect, educate the "whole
doctor" by allowing him to in
clude non-medical and scientific
courses in his program
Principles of medicine are
stressed in the new Stanford cur
riculum leather than detailed mas
tery of each subject or technique.
For example, "multidiscipline
courses" in Basic Medical Sci
ences combine anatomy, biochem
istry, microbiology, pathology,
pharmacology and physiology in
one study cooperatively conduct

ed by the six departments. Lec
ures and lab work are coordi
nated.
Previously, medical students
mastered each subject separately
and had to work out interrela
tionships themselves.
A unique adjunct of the new
jurriculum is the "multidiscipline
laboratory" feature. These labs
serve 16 students as "home bases"
for a full year, with each student
assigned to one desk to which ho
has access at any time.
No longer will Stanford medi
cal students scuttle from lab to
lab carting all his notebooks
and equipment with him as he
goes.
Along with the admission of
approximately sixty-two medical
students each year (this year the
number was 75), some 100 nurs
ing students are accepted for ihe
Stanford School of Nursing, also
housed in the new Medical Cen
ter.
Student Facilities
Student facilities in the Center
now rank as the nation's most
modern. Most of the laboratories
and pieces of equipment are the
newest available.
Classrooms, for instance, are
all of the theater-seat type, acous
tically designed to provide maxi
mum efficiency. Most are fully
equipped with movie screens and
project ion equipment.
A student lounge, hinted to be
a "dating bureau" of sorts, rests
between medical school and nurs
ing school facilities and has a
snack bar, music, and other com
forts few other student lounges
here have.

N'ow the Stanford University
I School of Medicine, this school
will graduate, in this year and
years to come, members of the
medical profession on whom the
eyes of the professional and edu
cational greats in this country
will focus.
New Plan
Coincident with the 'move of
the Medical School from anti
quated and terribly inadequate
quarters in San Francisco last
month came the institution of a
new plan for education in mcdi
cine.
The decision to move the School
was made by the Stanford Board
of Trustees in 1953 in a desire "to
relocate the school and join in
struction of the basic sciences
and clinical medicine on campus
in a university setting."
The new educational plan calls
for admission of a student to the
medical "school after the third
year of undergraduate study.
Completion of the requirements
for the M.D. degree normally fol
lows in five years after admission.
The redesigned curriculum
views the eight years of study
between high school and the M.D.
degree as a whole, rather than in
the usual perspective of four col
lege years and four in medical
school.
Medical students will complete
requirements for the bachelor's
degree during the first three of
the five medical school years. In
this way, it is hoped, non medical
talents and interests will be de
veloped alongside medical apti
tudes.
Those educators who designed
the new curriculum noted the
widespread specialization which
has plagued medicine. According
to these men, a diminished under
standing of the "whole patient"
has been the result.
"Whole Doctor," Too
The plan, then, seeks to help
the new doctor to understand this
"whole patient" by pointing out
lhat one must understand more
than just diseases, germs, viruses,
technical equipment, body tem
peratures and the like.
And along with a considered
effort to help these future doc
tors better understand that
"whole patient" comes the effort
to, in effect, educate the "whole
doctor" by allowing him to in
clude non-medical and scientific
courses in his program
Principles of medicine are
stressed in the new Stanford cur
riculum leather than detailed mas
tery of each subject or technique.
For example, "multidiscipline
courses" in Basic Medical Sci
ences combine anatomy, biochem
istry, microbiology, pathology,
pharmacology and physiology in
one study cooperatively conduct

ed by the six departments. Lec
ures and lab work are coordi
nated.
Previously, medical students
mastered each subject separately
and had to work out interrela
tionships themselves.
A unique adjunct of the new
jurriculum is the "multidiscipline
laboratory" feature. These labs
serve 16 students as "home bases"
for a full year, with each student
assigned to one desk to which ho
has access at any time.
No longer will Stanford medi
cal students scuttle from lab to
lab carting all his notebooks
and equipment with him as he
goes.
Along with the admission of
approximately sixty-two medical
students each year (this year the
number was 75), some 100 nurs
ing students are accepted for ihe
Stanford School of Nursing, also
housed in the new Medical Cen
ter.
Student Facilities
Student facilities in the Center
now rank as the nation's most
modern. Most of the laboratories
and pieces of equipment are the
newest available.
Classrooms, for instance, are
all of the theater-seat type, acous
tically designed to provide maxi
mum efficiency. Most are fully
equipped with movie screens and
project ion equipment.
A student lounge, hinted to be
a "dating bureau" of sorts, rests
between medical school and nurs
ing school facilities and has a
snack bar, music, and other com
forts few other student lounges
here have.

lord's new $22 million Medical Center. The series is designed to
help Stanford students become familiar with the campus' newest j
structure and what goes on inside its walls.)

One hundred years ago last month M.D. degrees were conferred
on I lie first two students to graduate from a medical school in the
West. The school was the Cooper Medical College, founded by Dr.
Samuel Elias Cooper, in San Francisco.
