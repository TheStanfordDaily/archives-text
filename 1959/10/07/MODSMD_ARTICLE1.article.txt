(Editor's Note: This is the second in a three-part article on Stan
lord's new $22 million Medical Center. The series is designed to
help Stanford students become familiar with the campus' newest j
structure and what goes on inside its walls.)

One hundred years ago last month M.D. degrees were conferred
on I lie first two students to graduate from a medical school in the
West. The school was the Cooper Medical College, founded by Dr.
Samuel Elias Cooper, in San Francisco.
In the last 10(3 years much has happened to that school —in the

| way of number and caliber of
j graduates, and even location.
N'ow the Stanford University
I School of Medicine, this school
will graduate, in this year and
years to come, members of the
medical profession on whom the
eyes of the professional and edu
cational greats in this country
will focus.
New Plan
Coincident with the 'move of
the Medical School from anti
quated and terribly inadequate
quarters in San Francisco last
month came the institution of a
new plan for education in mcdi
cine.
The decision to move the School
was made by the Stanford Board
of Trustees in 1953 in a desire "to
relocate the school and join in
struction of the basic sciences
and clinical medicine on campus
in a university setting."
The new educational plan calls
for admission of a student to the
medical "school after the third
year of undergraduate study.
Completion of the requirements
for the M.D. degree normally fol
lows in five years after admission.
