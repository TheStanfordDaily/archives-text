# Palo Alto Power Off Three Hours
## 
### 
Palo Alto was left without,
power from 1:59 to 3:45 p.m. to
day after a 35-foot traveling
crane hit the main 60,000 volt
power lines Into Palo Alto a
quarter mile south of Embarca
dero on Bayshore freeway. The
erane belonged to L. C. Smith Co.,
contractors for current freeway
improvements.
Electrical power to Palo Alto
was cut off until alternate power
lines were brought into service
from Mountain View. Repairs to
the line caused northbound traf
fic to be regulated until about
midnight. Stanford, with its own
source of power, was not af
fected.
Traffic was' snarled in Palo
Alto, and the city police worked
to replace blacked-out traffic
lights at busy intersections.
The Palo Alto-Stanford Hospi
tal used emergency power re
sources during the blackout.
