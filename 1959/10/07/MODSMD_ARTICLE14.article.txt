## Negotiations Fail to Solve Steel Strike 
### 
PITTSBURGH (/P) —A steel ne
gotiations summit meeting failed
Tuesday night to break the dead
lock in the 84-day-old steel strike.
President Eisenhower again
called on the steel industry and
union, through his press secre
tary, James C. Hagerty, to re
sume negotiations until they
reach an agreement.
Eisenhower said significantly
in Washington last week that lie
wanted a steel settlement initiat
ed by the time he got back to the
national capital Thursday.
Therefore Tuesday's fresh ap
peal bore all the earmarks of a
final urging at a negotiated set
tlement before the President may
feel impelled to apply the T-H law
to steel too.
After the 90-minute meeting
with top steel industry executives,
United St eel workers President
David J. McDonald told news
men:
"Nothing has changed. The in
dustry's position is not flexible."
Earlier Tuesday the union de
manded a fair settlement and
pledged to continue the 84-day
walkout indefinitely until "justice
is done."
Tuesday wound up the 12th
week of the strike. New layoffs
were announced in the railroad
and auto industries.
