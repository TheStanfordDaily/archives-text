# Both Sides Meet At Hearing Today In Washington
## 
### 
PALM SPRINGS (/P> Presi
dent Eisenhower paved the way
Tuesday for an 80-day cooling-off
halt of the dock strike by invoking
the Taft-Hartley law. lie said the
Atlantic and Gulf Coast shutdown
by the independent International
Longshoremen's Assn. threatens
national health and safety.
In Washington, Labor Depart
ment officials predicted a back-to
work injunction will be obtained
in federal court by Friday.
An ILA spokesman, informed
of the President's action, said in
New York: "We always obey the
government."
.Sixth Day
Eisenhower's use of the Taft-
Hartley law in the dock strike
came with the shutdown only six
days old.
In the dock tie-up, which has
halted shipping from Maine to
Texas, Eisenhower said in an ex
ecutive order that the strike "will
imperil the national health and
safety" if permitted to continue.
The President added the strike
also impedes the flow of neces
sary perishable products, includ
ing food, to heavily populated At
lantic and Gulf Coast ports.
Fact-Finding Board
As the first step under the Taft-
Hartley national emergency pro
visions, Eisenhower named a
three-man fact-finding board and
instructed the members to report
to him by Saturday. The board
makes no recommendations.
Both sides in the strike were
told to appear Wednesday in
Washington before the board.
The hearing is expected to take
only one day.
Injunction Petition
On the basis of the board's re
port, the President then can di
rect the Justice Department to
petition in a federal district court
for an injunction ordering about
85,000 striking dockers back to
their jobs.
Eisenhower also could find the
board's report does not justify the
court order procedure. But in
this case, the President already is
familiar with the issues and se
rious economic impact of the
strike, and an injunction petition
in a few days—probably by Fri
day—is regarded as a foregone
conclusion.
When any court injunction has
run its 80-day course, there is
nothing to keep the ILA from
striking again.

Injunction Petition
On the basis of the board's re
port, the President then can di
rect the Justice Department to
petition in a federal district court
for an injunction ordering about
85,000 striking dockers back to
their jobs.
Eisenhower also could find the
board's report does not justify the
court order procedure. But in
this case, the President already is
familiar with the issues and se
rious economic impact of the
strike, and an injunction petition
in a few days—probably by Fri
day—is regarded as a foregone
conclusion.
When any court injunction has
run its 80-day course, there is
nothing to keep the ILA from
striking again.
PALM SPRINGS (/P> Presi
dent Eisenhower paved the way
Tuesday for an 80-day cooling-off
halt of the dock strike by invoking
the Taft-Hartley law. lie said the
Atlantic and Gulf Coast shutdown
by the independent International
Longshoremen's Assn. threatens
national health and safety.
In Washington, Labor Depart
ment officials predicted a back-to
work injunction will be obtained
in federal court by Friday.
An ILA spokesman, informed
of the President's action, said in
New York: "We always obey the
government."
.Sixth Day
Eisenhower's use of the Taft-
Hartley law in the dock strike
came with the shutdown only six
days old.
In the dock tie-up, which has
halted shipping from Maine to
Texas, Eisenhower said in an ex
ecutive order that the strike "will
imperil the national health and
safety" if permitted to continue.
The President added the strike
also impedes the flow of neces
sary perishable products, includ
ing food, to heavily populated At
lantic and Gulf Coast ports.
Fact-Finding Board
As the first step under the Taft-
Hartley national emergency pro
visions, Eisenhower named a
three-man fact-finding board and
instructed the members to report
to him by Saturday. The board
makes no recommendations.
Both sides in the strike were
told to appear Wednesday in
Washington before the board.
The hearing is expected to take
only one day.
