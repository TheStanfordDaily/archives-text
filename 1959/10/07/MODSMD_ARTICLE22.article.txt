# More Season Books?

Football si:aso\ has hardl\ begun and complaints about Stan
funi s season tickets have bareh died down. et the problem of
what to do about basketball tickets is already in the air.
Stanford's lin\ antiquated pavilion has posed seating problems
for years. Now, a 67 per cent increase in the guarantee Stanford
must make to each \ isit ing team has made the situation critical. The
financial upshot of the increase is that Stanford must sell out the
pavilion for every home game to break even on basketball.
Though mam games in the past have not sold out, it is not be
cause fans aren't interested. The difficulty is that student tickets
have been sold during each week, and single-game public tickets
have not been available until ordy a day or so before a game.
This, coupled with the fact that often there are not public tick
ets available for big games, has gotten fans out of the habit of going
to Stanford games.
Topping the solution list looks to be the selling of season ticket
books to students, as is done for football. Ibis, however, poses
several problems. Most students who go to one football game go
to all of them. But not so in basketball, where women especially
are not cvery-game fans.
An added solution might be to sell two types of season booksâ€”
one for all the home games, another for five choice games, or per
haps for all the Friday night games.
Another problem is whether to make the books cover all 13
games, or only the 10 during winter quarter. It would appear wiser
to sell ticket hooks at the start of winter quarter, rather than try
to sell against the pressure of Big Game activities and end-of-quar
ter cramming.
\\ hat the selling of season books would accomplish, of course,
is to establish at the start of the season how many seats per game
will he taken up by Stanford students. This then leaves ample time
to get remaining tickets in the hands of the public.
Students, naturally, would rather be able to buy tickets a game
at a time. But bearing in mind the problems of trying to manage
a $1250 per game guarantee out of a place that seats 2800, it's al
most definite that something must be done.
Though the question may he out of season, this is the time in
terested students will have to make their thoughts and suggestions
known if tliev are to have any effect on a decision soon to be made
