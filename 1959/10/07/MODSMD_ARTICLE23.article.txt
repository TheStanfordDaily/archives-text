### Rich Sundeen ASSU President 
The purpose of this column lies
in the hope of familiarizing you.
the members of the Associated
Students of Stanford University,
with the various plans, opera
tions, and issues that arise within
Legislature.
Communication such as this
may engender within the stu
dent body interest in student
government. An arousal of in
terest will invoke, I hope, wider
participation by students, either
through individual or group
action or through well thought
out constructive criticism.
Throughout this quarter I will
attempt to present, in objective
form, facts involved in various
plans and issues with which Leg
islature deals. As well, I will en
deavor to present the whys and
motivations behind some of the
issues.
A representative body such as
Legislature cannot function ef
fectively without support of its
constituents, nor without knowl
edge of their desires. By express
ing your views to your represen
tatives, you may play an integral
part in your student government.
And in turn the members of Leg
islature will have the basis to
fulfill their responsibilities by
the realization of your opinions
and desires on various issues.
I hope you will take advan
tage of your ASSU Legislature
for it is not only the central cog
for all ASSU activities but also
the most effective student lob
hying body to the administra
tion.
All of your ASSU officers,
President, Vice President, and
Student Financial Manager, hold
regular office hours in the ASSU
Office. Speaking on behalf of all
three I know they are all quite

willing and anxious to discuss
current issues and plans with any
interested persons.
Arrangements are also being
made for your three ASSU offi
cers to eat dinner once a week
at one of the undergraduate dor
mitories in order to discuss prob
lems and answer questions per
taining to the ASSU.
This week there are several
points of concern to the genera!
student body. Several ASSU
Boards and Commissions are
holding tryouts. Students inter
ested in becoming active in some
ASSU Office or ASSU activity
should consult the tryout column
in The Daily.
Perhaps the proposed Big
Game Dunce looms as the ma
jor controversy this week. I
believe Cardinals and Legisla
ture intend for the dance to
provide a form of social func
tion for those who have no de
sire to go off campus after the
Big Game Bonfire.
Such a dance after a bonfire
would be quite casual and ought
to be a good time for everyone.
Those who wish can still go to
San Francisco or other places.
Critics of the dance say that such
an activity breaks Big Game tra
dition and, also, would crowd the
already heavy schedule of dances
on that weekend
On the other hand, proponents
of a pre-Big Game Dance main
tain that the San Francisco rally
was not greatly missed last year
and that perhaps the bonfire fol
lowed by an all campus dance will
consequently become another
campus tradition.
At any rate, the Legislature
has deemed this idea of the Car
dinals worthy of consideration
and experiment.
