First on my "pure entertain
ment" list this week in Palo Alto
is Comedia's current production
of "Where's Charley?", the hi
larious musical comedy by-
George Abbot taken from the play
"Charley's Aunt."
A( the Loft Theater, Emerson
at Hamilton, the audience sits
tin three sides of the playing
area and almost immediately
feels a part of the show. (In
fact, in the second act, the audi
ence is invited to join in sing
ing the well-known song - , "Once
in Love With Amy"—and en
thusiastically responds.)
In the title role, William Kin
solving, who is well known to
Stanford audiences for his many
appearances in Ram's H e a d
shows, is excellent as the Oxford
student of 1892 who masquerades
as his aunt in order to get written
permission to marry his beloved.
The hilarious situations which
ensue from his "split personal
ity" and Kinsolving's talent in
playing them to full advantage,
as well as his vocal ability, make
this one of the funniest and most
entertaining shows I've seen in
quite a while.
As Charley's friend. Jack,
Tom Kissinger (also a frequent
Stanford performer) gives a
likewise enjoyable performance
though his voice is not equal
to Kinsolving's.
Amy Spettigue, Charley's girl
friend, is played brilliantly by
Jacque Wood who will be remem
bered for her show-stopping num
ber, "Zip," in "Pal Joey" here
last spring, and in the role of
Kitty. Barbara Stii's lovely voice
is one to be remembered.
In fact, every member of the
cast and chorus was excellent.
Other notables include Philip
Schultz, as Sir Francis, Rusty
D'Anna as Mr. Spettigue, and
Barbara Lingafelter, playing
Charley's real aunt who appears
quite unexpectedly.
Frank Loesser's delightful
music is played effectively by
alternate pianists David Wil
liams and Layne Stamler with
bass by Victor Bacigalnpi, with
the two instruments carrying
amazingly well the part of an
orchestra.
Although the slapstick becomes
a little too thick and tedious in
Act Two, the high caliber of the
production on the whole, directed
by Peter Kump, guarantees an
evening equal in enjoyment to
that spent at many a San Fran-

Cisco theater I'm sure. Reserva
tions can be made at DA 6-8317
for performances this Friday,
Saturday and Sunday at 8:30 p.m.
Also in Palo Alto this Satur
day at 8:30 p.m., Odetta will give
a concert of ballads, work-songs
and spirituals at the Palo Alto
Senior High School.
An article about the famous
folk-singer whose career began
at the"Tin Angel" in San Fran
cisco, recently appeared in "Down
Beat." Tickets from $1.95 to $3.00
may be purchased at High Fidel
ity, Unlimited, and Bell's College
Book Shop.
In San Francisco this week
are many opportunities for us
to "open our eyes to the Ameri
can artist" —from theater to art
exhibits and ballet; —as was
urged by Vincent Price in his
outstanding lecture - reading
here last Sunday afternoon.
At the California Palace of the
Legion of Honor, Lincoln Park,
"American Prints Today — 1959"
are being shown through Oct. 18.
Open daily from 10 .m. to 5 p.m..
(he exhibition is free.
And at the San Francisco Mu
seum of Art at the Civic Center,
recent work of three Bay Area
artists is on display — paintings
by Art Holman and David Simp
son and sculpture by John R.
Baxter, all of which express an
affirmation of man's relationship
to his natural and social environ
ment.
Ballet lovers are promised an
evening of ballet in the grand
manner on Oct. 14 at the Vet
eran's Auditorium when stars
of many of the world's leading
ballet companies will be seen
in "A Ballet Gala."
In its final week at the Marines'
Theater, Sutler and Mason, is
the Actors' Workshop presenta
tion of "The Plaster Bambino,"
Ford Foundation award winning
comedy, which stars outstanding
actors. Burgess Meredith and Vi
veca Lindfors. Performances are

liams and Layne Stamler with
bass by Victor Bacigalnpi, with
the two instruments carrying
amazingly well the part of an
orchestra.
Although the slapstick becomes
a little too thick and tedious in
Act Two, the high caliber of the
production on the whole, directed
by Peter Kump, guarantees an
evening equal in enjoyment to
that spent at many a San Fran-

Cisco theater I'm sure. Reserva
tions can be made at DA 6-8317
for performances this Friday,
Saturday and Sunday at 8:30 p.m.
Also in Palo Alto this Satur
day at 8:30 p.m., Odetta will give
a concert of ballads, work-songs
and spirituals at the Palo Alto
Senior High School.
An article about the famous
folk-singer whose career began
at the"Tin Angel" in San Fran
cisco, recently appeared in "Down
Beat." Tickets from $1.95 to $3.00
may be purchased at High Fidel

In San Francisco this week
are many opportunities for us
to "open our eyes to the Ameri
can artist" —from theater to art
exhibits and ballet; —as was
urged by Vincent Price in his
outstanding lecture - reading
here last Sunday afternoon.
At the California Palace of the
Legion of Honor, Lincoln Park,
"American Prints Today — 1959"
are being shown through Oct. 18.
Open daily from 10 .m. to 5 p.m..
(he exhibition is free.
And at the San Francisco Mu
seum of Art at the Civic Center,
recent work of three Bay Area
artists is on display — paintings
by Art Holman and David Simp
son and sculpture by John R.
Baxter, all of which express an
affirmation of man's relationship
to his natural and social environ
ment.
Ballet lovers are promised an
evening of ballet in the grand
manner on Oct. 14 at the Vet
eran's Auditorium when stars
of many of the world's leading
ballet companies will be seen
in "A Ballet Gala."
In its final week at the Marines'
Theater, Sutler and Mason, is
the Actors' Workshop presenta
tion of "The Plaster Bambino,"
Ford Foundation award winning
comedy, which stars outstanding
actors. Burgess Meredith and Vi
veca Lindfors. Performances are
nightly with two shows Saturday
(at 6 and 9 p.m.) and Sunday
(2:30 and 8:30 p.m.). Tickets run
from $2.50 to $3.85.
And in the "to open" category,
the three-week pre-Broadway en
gagement of "A Mighty Man Is
He" will begin Monday at the
Geary Theater. Seats for the
comedy, which stars Nancy Kelly,
are priced from about $2.10 to
$4.85 with slightly lower prices
for the Wednesday and Saturday
matinees.
First on my "pure entertain
ment" list this week in Palo Alto
is Comedia's current production
of "Where's Charley?", the hi
larious musical comedy by-
George Abbot taken from the play
"Charley's Aunt."
A( the Loft Theater, Emerson
at Hamilton, the audience sits
tin three sides of the playing
area and almost immediately
feels a part of the show. (In
fact, in the second act, the audi
ence is invited to join in sing
ing the well-known song - , "Once
in Love With Amy"—and en
thusiastically responds.)
In the title role, William Kin
solving, who is well known to
Stanford audiences for his many
appearances in Ram's H e a d
shows, is excellent as the Oxford
student of 1892 who masquerades
as his aunt in order to get written
permission to marry his beloved.
The hilarious situations which
ensue from his "split personal
ity" and Kinsolving's talent in
playing them to full advantage,
as well as his vocal ability, make
this one of the funniest and most
entertaining shows I've seen in
quite a while.
As Charley's friend. Jack,
Tom Kissinger (also a frequent
Stanford performer) gives a
likewise enjoyable performance
though his voice is not equal
to Kinsolving's.
Amy Spettigue, Charley's girl
friend, is played brilliantly by
Jacque Wood who will be remem
bered for her show-stopping num
ber, "Zip," in "Pal Joey" here
last spring, and in the role of
Kitty. Barbara Stii's lovely voice
is one to be remembered.
In fact, every member of the
cast and chorus was excellent.
Other notables include Philip
Schultz, as Sir Francis, Rusty
D'Anna as Mr. Spettigue, and
Barbara Lingafelter, playing
Charley's real aunt who appears
quite unexpectedly.
Frank Loesser's delightful
music is played effectively by
alternate pianists David Wil
liams and Layne Stamler with
bass by Victor Bacigalnpi, with
the two instruments carrying
amazingly well the part of an
orchestra.

eran's Auditorium when stars
of many of the world's leading
ballet companies will be seen
in "A Ballet Gala."
In its final week at the Marines'
Theater, Sutler and Mason, is
the Actors' Workshop presenta
tion of "The Plaster Bambino,"
Ford Foundation award winning
comedy, which stars outstanding
actors. Burgess Meredith and Vi
veca Lindfors. Performances are
nightly with two shows Saturday
(at 6 and 9 p.m.) and Sunday
(2:30 and 8:30 p.m.). Tickets run
from $2.50 to $3.85.
And in the "to open" category,
the three-week pre-Broadway en
gagement of "A Mighty Man Is
He" will begin Monday at the
Geary Theater. Seats for the
comedy, which stars Nancy Kelly,
are priced from about $2.10 to
$4.85 with slightly lower prices
for the Wednesday and Saturday
matinees.
First on my "pure entertain
ment" list this week in Palo Alto
is Comedia's current production
of "Where's Charley?", the hi
larious musical comedy by-
George Abbot taken from the play
"Charley's Aunt."
A( the Loft Theater, Emerson
at Hamilton, the audience sits
tin three sides of the playing
area and almost immediately
feels a part of the show. (In
fact, in the second act, the audi
ence is invited to join in sing
ing the well-known song - , "Once
in Love With Amy"—and en
thusiastically responds.)
In the title role, William Kin
solving, who is well known to
Stanford audiences for his many
appearances in Ram's H e a d
shows, is excellent as the Oxford
student of 1892 who masquerades
as his aunt in order to get written
permission to marry his beloved.
The hilarious situations which
ensue from his "split personal
ity" and Kinsolving's talent in
playing them to full advantage,
as well as his vocal ability, make
this one of the funniest and most
entertaining shows I've seen in
quite a while.
As Charley's friend. Jack,
Tom Kissinger (also a frequent
Stanford performer) gives a
likewise enjoyable performance
though his voice is not equal
to Kinsolving's.
Amy Spettigue, Charley's girl
friend, is played brilliantly by
Jacque Wood who will be remem
bered for her show-stopping num
ber, "Zip," in "Pal Joey" here
last spring, and in the role of
Kitty. Barbara Stii's lovely voice
is one to be remembered.
In fact, every member of the
cast and chorus was excellent.
Other notables include Philip
Schultz, as Sir Francis, Rusty
D'Anna as Mr. Spettigue, and
Barbara Lingafelter, playing
Charley's real aunt who appears
quite unexpectedly.
Frank Loesser's delightful
music is played effectively by
alternate pianists David Wil
liams and Layne Stamler with
bass by Victor Bacigalnpi, with
the two instruments carrying
amazingly well the part of an
orchestra.
Although the slapstick becomes
a little too thick and tedious in
Act Two, the high caliber of the
production on the whole, directed
by Peter Kump, guarantees an
evening equal in enjoyment to
that spent at many a San Fran-

Cisco theater I'm sure. Reserva
tions can be made at DA 6-8317
for performances this Friday,
Saturday and Sunday at 8:30 p.m.
Also in Palo Alto this Satur
day at 8:30 p.m., Odetta will give
a concert of ballads, work-songs
and spirituals at the Palo Alto
Senior High School.
An article about the famous
folk-singer whose career began
at the"Tin Angel" in San Fran
cisco, recently appeared in "Down
Beat." Tickets from $1.95 to $3.00
may be purchased at High Fidel
ity, Unlimited, and Bell's College
Book Shop.
In San Francisco this week
are many opportunities for us
to "open our eyes to the Ameri
can artist" —from theater to art
exhibits and ballet; —as was
urged by Vincent Price in his
outstanding lecture - reading
here last Sunday afternoon.
At the California Palace of the
Legion of Honor, Lincoln Park,
"American Prints Today — 1959"
are being shown through Oct. 18.
Open daily from 10 .m. to 5 p.m..
(he exhibition is free.
And at the San Francisco Mu
seum of Art at the Civic Center,
recent work of three Bay Area
artists is on display — paintings
by Art Holman and David Simp
son and sculpture by John R.
Baxter, all of which express an
affirmation of man's relationship
to his natural and social environ
ment.
