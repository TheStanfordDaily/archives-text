## FASTER, FASTER!

College enrollment continues to spiral upward. The need for
more classrooms and more teachers grows more desperate daily.
But classrooms, alas, do not spring up like mushrooms—nor
teachers like May flies. So what must we do while we build more
classrooms and train more teachers? We must get better use out
of the classrooms and teachers we now have. That's what we
must do.
This column, normally a vehicle of good-humored foolery,
will today forsake laughter to examine the cri>is in higher
education. My sponsors, the makers of Philip Morris ('igarettes,
as bonny a bunch of tycoons as you will see in a month of .Sun
days, have given cheerful consent to this departure. Oh,
splendid chaps they are—the makers of Philip Morris, fond of
home, mother, porridge, the Constitution and country fiddling!
Twinkly and engaging they arp, as full of joy, as brimming with
goodness, as loaded with felicity as the cigarettes they bring
you in two handy packages—the traditional soft pack and the
crushproof flip-top box.
How can we make better use of existing campus facilities? The
answer can be given in one word—speedup! Speed up the educa
tional process—streamline courses. Eliminate frills. Sharpen.
Shorten. Quicken.

Following is a list of courses with suggested methods to speed
up each one.
PHYSlCS—Eliminate slow neutrons.
PSYCHOLOGY LAB—Tilt the mazes downhill. The white
mice will run much faster.
ENGINEERING—Make slide rules half as long.
MUSIC —Change all tempos to allegro. (An added benefit
to be gained from this suggestion is that once you speed up
waltz time, campus proms will all be over by ten p.m. With
students going home so early, romance will languish and mar
riage counsellors can be transferred to the Buildings and
Grounds Department. Also, houses now used for married
students can be returned to the School of Animal Husbandry.)
ALGEBRA—If N always equals twenty-four, much time
consuming computation can be eliminated.
DENTISTRY—Skip baby teeth—they fall out anyhow.
POETRY—Amalgamate the classics. Like this:
Hail to thee blithe spirit
Shoot if you must this old gray head
You nint nothin' hut a hound dog
Smiling, the boy fell dead
You see how simple it is? Perhaps you have some speedup
ideas of your own. If so, I'll thank you to keep them to your
selves. T 1969 Max Shuluiau

The Philip Morris Company, makers of Philip Morris, Marl
boros and Alpine, have no interest in speedup. We age our
line tobaccos stow and easy. And that's the way they smoke
— sloir arid easy and full of natural tobacco goodness.
