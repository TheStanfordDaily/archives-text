What a Roaring Start
There is a cussed thing about football games nowadays that
makes them horrible things to try to predict. I started the present
season with a cheery outlook that never would there be a year as
bad as last; and then opened the predicting season with a scintillat
ing 7!) performance. lint it is nice to know that 7-f) is only two
games out of first.
It must be the two-point conversion rule. That certainly has in
creased the upset liability in college football as well as caused
Stanford to lose a Big Game.

As well, it must be the open
ing up of the college game. Thank
goodness we have apparently es
caped the flood of the split-T that
seemed a few years ago destined
to envelope the entire college grid
scene. Split-T is good, solid, foot
ball that relies on sheer man
power and cuts down on the pos
sibility of upset. Now 1 suppose
it is nice that the best team should
always win, or rather the team
with the most men, but the more
wide open look in offenses makes
u team spectacularly killing on
one day and spectacularly blun
dering the next. So there are up
sets.
Stanford will be meeting this
week what used to be the most
grind-it-outish team on the Coast.
Washington is coached by an old
Oklahoma gridder, -lini Owens,
and has been sticking pretty
close to the steady, straight-ahead
ground game.
But with only minor success.

The Huskies were staying so close
to the straight-ahead game last year that despite being blessed with
some of the speediest backs on the Coast, their longest run from
scrimmage was a bristling 31 yards.
So Washington has opened up a bit this yearâ€”widening the of
fense, throwing the ball more often and more effectively, and break
ing loose their speed men more often. George Fleming, the Dallas
speedster with the talented toe, is breaking away often and has
really distinguished himself on kick returns.
Berkeley Gets Its Lumps
Brother Bear is having quite a season isn't he? This week it's
Notre Dame and while I'd just as soon see the Bears upset the Irish,
I'm afraid I won't be putting any money on it.
C'al was happy with having lost most of last year's team, except
Joe Kapp, back; but then this was the same line that took the atti
tude of a rug in last year's Hose Bowl and has turned in similar
performances the last two weeks.
Speaking of Kapp, he really wasn't such a bad old guy after all,
was he? As a matter of fact, Joe currently has Calgary, Alberta,
by the tail and is being hailed as about the best thing ever to hit the
Stampede city. In other words, he is enjoying quile a season in
Canadian profesional football.
Before I shed too many tears over the lovely bounces of the
college football, let me offer a word of thanks that The Stanford
Daily's fearless forecasters don't pick the pro games, too.
For instance, setting aside the 49ers' slaughter of Los Angeles
just three weeks after the Rams 48-14 exhibition win, try this: Sun
flay, Washington beat Pittsburgh, which last week had beaten Cleve
land, which Sunday demolished the Chicago Cardinals, who last week
had walked all over Washington. Interesting.
Two Guys From Nowhere
Then there is this World Series which annually confounds early
football season.
Who ever thought that Roger Craig and Larry Sherry would be
the Dodgers' heroes? Craig, the big pitcher in the pennant drive,
lost 17 games for St. Paul last year. Sherry, of recent fame, was
6 14 at Spokane last season. So they traded minor league places this
year, by mid-season were with the Dodgers, and now are first-class
heroes.
My, but IF is the biggest word in the alphabet.
Think what would have happened IF: the Braves had had Red
Sehoendienst this year; Bob Friend had had a winning year for
Pittsburgh; Don Drysdale had had as correspondingly as great a
year as the rest of the Dodgers; Willie McCovey and Eddie Bressoud
had been at their best for the Giants all season. Well, well. Looks
like four runaways.
And for what it's worth, here is a brief comment on that contro
versial old character, Bill Kartozian. Be silent, critics. For three
years you've complained about yell leaders whose biggest trouble
was that they just tried too much to be like yell leaders. Now we
get a yell leader who's not concerned with being the yell leader's
yell leader. And he looks like the best in years.
