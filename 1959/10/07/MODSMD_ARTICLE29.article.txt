# Huskies Rate Tough
## 
### Russ Allen 
Fresh after an impressive vic
tory over tough COP, the Stan
ford gridders journey North this
weekend to piay the high-riding
Huskies from the University of
Washington.
Strictly a darkhorse candidate
at the opening of the season, the
Huskies have won their first
three ball games outscoring
their opponents by a whopping
95 to 18 and now are a definite
threat to top the AAWU and go
to the Rose Bowl.
Assistant coach Dutch Fehring
singled out the Husky team ag
gressiveness as their outstanding
point of attack. "Their morale is
high and their good linemen
cover well on punts, have good
pursuit and excellent gang tac
kling" he stated.
Coach Fehring went on lo pre
dict that the LISC • Washington
game in almost two weeks should
decide the AAWU or "Big Five"
race.
Scliloredt Good (JP.
The Huskies are led by quarter
backs Bob Scliloredt and Bob 11iv
ner. Scliloredt is a smart, all
around signal caller as he can
run, pass and kick. His 261 yards
gained places him second in
AAWU total offense stats.
Schloredt's punting can be al
most considered an offensive
weapon as last year he and his
teammates led the nation in de
fensing punt returns. So far this
sason he has punted 12 times for
a 43.7 yard average placing him
third in conference punting.
Bob Hivner leads the strong
Husky second unit and is a good
passer as well as able team com
mander.
The definite strong point in the
Washington attack is their rough
interior lineman. Guards Chuck

Allen and Bill Kinnune and tackle
Kurt Gegner certainly uphold the
Husky tradition of fast, aggres
sive linemen.
Three Fine Teams
Another aspect of the Husky
attack is their ability to move and
score with three good teams. For
the first time in several years
Washington head coach Jim Ow
ens seems to have no depth prob
lems.
In the Husky backfield, the
purple and gold men have a cou
ple of top-notch backs in halfback
George Fleming and fullback Ray
Jackson. Card coach Fehring
compares the two to Dick Bass
and Henry Wallace of COP in
size, speed and moves.
Fleming is the Huskies leading
scorer with 30 points—grabbing
three touchdowns, 2 for 2 field
goals and 6 for 7 extra points. He
is also their top kickoff and punt
return man.
Jackson, a hard-charging full
back, has gobbled up 106 yards
to tie for second in team offense

stats, and leads in Husky rushing.
Sehloredt and Hivner's chief
pass receiver is end Dick Aguirre
who has grabbed-off seven for
106 yards and 2 TDs. Other good
linemen are the Bullard brothers,
Barry and Tim at tackles; and
end Don Millich.
Huskies I'se "Swlng-T"
Th e I luskies feature the
"Swing-T" attack which features
14 different formations, men in
motion, and general confusion
for the opponents' defenses so
far.

Jackson, a hard-charging full

stats, and leads in Husky rushing.
Sehloredt and Hivner's chief
pass receiver is end Dick Aguirre

HUSKIES' KURT GEGNER
Hard-Charging Tackle
Fresh after an impressive vic
tory over tough COP, the Stan
ford gridders journey North this
weekend to piay the high-riding
Huskies from the University of
Washington.
Strictly a darkhorse candidate
at the opening of the season, the
Huskies have won their first
three ball games outscoring
their opponents by a whopping
95 to 18 and now are a definite
threat to top the AAWU and go
to the Rose Bowl.
Assistant coach Dutch Fehring
singled out the Husky team ag
gressiveness as their outstanding
point of attack. "Their morale is
high and their good linemen
cover well on punts, have good
pursuit and excellent gang tac
kling" he stated.
Coach Fehring went on lo pre
dict that the LISC • Washington
game in almost two weeks should
decide the AAWU or "Big Five"
race.
Scliloredt Good (JP.
The Huskies are led by quarter
backs Bob Scliloredt and Bob 11iv
ner. Scliloredt is a smart, all
around signal caller as he can
run, pass and kick. His 261 yards
gained places him second in
AAWU total offense stats.
Schloredt's punting can be al
most considered an offensive
weapon as last year he and his
teammates led the nation in de
fensing punt returns. So far this
sason he has punted 12 times for
a 43.7 yard average placing him
third in conference punting.
Bob Hivner leads the strong
Husky second unit and is a good
passer as well as able team com
mander.
The definite strong point in the
Washington attack is their rough
interior lineman. Guards Chuck

Allen and Bill Kinnune and tackle
Kurt Gegner certainly uphold the
Husky tradition of fast, aggres
sive linemen.
Three Fine Teams
Another aspect of the Husky
attack is their ability to move and
score with three good teams. For
the first time in several years
Washington head coach Jim Ow
ens seems to have no depth prob
lems.
In the Husky backfield, the
purple and gold men have a cou
ple of top-notch backs in halfback
George Fleming and fullback Ray
Jackson. Card coach Fehring
compares the two to Dick Bass
and Henry Wallace of COP in
size, speed and moves.
Fleming is the Huskies leading
scorer with 30 points—grabbing
three touchdowns, 2 for 2 field
goals and 6 for 7 extra points. He
is also their top kickoff and punt
return man.
Jackson, a hard-charging full
back, has gobbled up 106 yards
to tie for second in team offense
