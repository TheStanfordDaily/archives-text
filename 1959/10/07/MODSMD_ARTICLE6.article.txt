# Carburetor Quandary Unsolved
## 
### Carl Oliver 
Chevrolet carburetors were in
great demand Monday. Two stu
dents each wanted one, two local
garages were looking for them,
an unknown thief was looking for
one, and Stanford Police are still
looking for one . , . complete
with thief,
James Flanagan, 1275 Middle
Ave., Menlo Park, returned from
morning classes to his parking
spot on Lasucn and discovered his
car missing. A friend reported
seeing a tow-truck haul the ve
hicle away.
Flanagan reported the loss to
Stanford Police who found the
car at a local garage that had,
indeed, hauled the car away. The
garage said a Mr. J. Hanagan had
telephoned a request for a carbu
retor overhaul.
Ron Todd, 565 Willow Road,
Palo Alto, left classes at the med
ical school and found a note on
the windshield of his car:
'"Where's the carburetor?" Todd
looked, found it had been re
moved from his Chevrolet.
Stanford Police Chief Gordon
Davis dialed the telephone num
ber which had been used as a
signature to the note. Another
local garage answered and told
the following story:
A Dr. Petersen had phoned the
garage to ask that a mechanic be
sent out to take the carburetor
off his car and replace it with
one that the doctor would give
him.
Dr. Petersen said he could see
the car from his office and would
bring the new part down when
he saw the mechanic arrive.
The mechanic arrived, removed
the old carburetor, and waited
for Dr. Petersen to bring the new
one. The doctor never appeared.
The mechanic walked into the
nearby medical school and check
ed with the three Dr. Petersens
working there â€” none of them
knew anything about the job.
When the mechanic returned to
the parking lot, he discovered
that during his absence, someone
had taken the carburetor he had
just removed. The mechanic re
turned to his garage.
Flanagan's car was returned to
him, Todd is still missing one
carburetor.
