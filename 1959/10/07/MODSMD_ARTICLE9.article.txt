### Daryl Glenney 
"Perhaps if we can solve some
of the problems of business edu
cation those of business will be
less formidable ." This is the goal
of the modern school of business,
according to Ernest C. Arbuckle,
Dean of Stanford's Graduate

School of Business, who initiated
the Tuesday Evening Series last
night with "This Busines of Busi
ness Education."
In his brief and often humor
ous lecture, Arbuckle traced the
history of business schools from
the turn of the century, when
only six existed, to the present,
when over 735 schools of business
have been established.
"As big business expanded, so
did tlie need for graduate busi
ness students," explained Arbuc
kle.
A primary problem in business
education today, Arbuckle main
tains, is the lack of communica
tion and understanding between
the scholar and the business
community.
The general feeling si ill per
sists that the school of business
education "serves neither the in
tellectual advancement nor the
material welfare of the commu
nity," he said.
Thus, the business school has
Ihe opportunity to mix the tradi
tions and values of a university
with those, of the business world.
Convinced that in years ahead
Ihe business world will wonder
why as well as how it can best
operate, Arbuckle concluded,
"We must make our education
ufseful lo the whole man, to the
full reach of his possibilities and
the full span of his life."
