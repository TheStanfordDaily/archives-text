# Elementary School Plotted In Escondido Village Area
## 
### 
Five acres at the corner of Stanford Avenue and Escondido Road will be the site of Palo Alto's first
elementary school on the Stanford campus since the 1920'5.
The Escondido Elementary School will serve the College Terrace, Escondido Village and surround
ing areas beginning in September of 1960.
The Palo Alto Unified School District has been considering a school on the campus since Stanford

first decided to build Escondido
Village. The decision was made
a year ago and the site purchased
in August.
Eight-Room School
The eight-room school, designed
by architects Clark, Stromquist,
Potter and Ehrlich, is the first
to be built in the cluster plan.
Its 300 students will attend classes
in six classrooms, two kindergar
tens and 112l l 2 acres of playground.
Administrative areas and a multi
use room will also be included.
The multi-use room is the first
to be built at tlie same time as
the rest of Ihe school.
Six classrooms will be added
later, bringing the number of stu
"dents up to 500.
The cluster is an educational
experiment which is also practi
cal. The site is steepâ€”and it
slopes 11 feet and the cluster
insures a minimum of ground
cutting.
Bids are due Oct. 26 and con
struction will start Nov. 1. The
school is expected to cost about
$300,000 for site - development,
paving, grading and turfing.
Fronting' Escondido
Fronting on Escondido Road,
the school will have a colored
gravel roof and stucco walls. A
small library will serve as a small
instructional area apart from the
other classrooms.
As another experiment, the pas
sageways between the cluster
units will have asphalt rather
than concrete floors. This should
insure less slipping.
The school goes from kinder
garten through the sixth grade.
