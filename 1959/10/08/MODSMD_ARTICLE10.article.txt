( ARSON CITY, Nov. (A J ) â€”A
boundary question which could
have led to severe confusion be
tween parts of Arizona and Ne
vada is apparently heading to
ward settlement.
Congress set the state bound
aries down the middle of the
Colorado River when Nevada
became a state in IStff) and
again when Arizona won state
hood in 1?)12.
The rub is that the river has
shifted two miles or so in vari
ous directions over the years.
Officials envisioned such fu
ture problems as an Arizona
gambling operation arguing it
was legal because its land was
actually Nevada's.
