# IFC Constitution Draft Approved by University
## 
### 
A new constitution, designed to
provide for mutual decisions with
: the administration rather than
the separate actions of the past,
| has been presented to Stanford's
: Interfraternity Council for its ap
| proval.
Stanford's administration has

| already given approval to the
document.
The new constitution provides
for the establishment of a new
Interfraternity Board, separate
from the more general Council,
which will bring fraternity mem
bers and faculty and administra

tion representatives together for
major - policy decisions.
A similar organizational set-up
existed on the Stanford campus
for approximately 20 years prior
to 1952 but at that time alumni
representatives were on the board
and there were none from the
administration. IFC, reduced to
rubber-stamp status under that
set-up, revoked the constitution.
The new Board will be com
posed of three faculty members
selected by President Wallace
Sterling, Dean of Men William
Craig and Assistant Dean of Men
David Larimer.
IFC's president, secretary-trea
surer, judicial council chairman,
rushing committee chairman,
house managers president and
three council members at large
will represent fraternities.
Council Still Exists
The Council, composed of offi
cers and house presidents or rep
resentatives, still exists under the
new constitution and must con
cur with the Board on all matters.
Any resolution or policy state
ment must be passed by a ma
jority vote of both bodies.
If they fail at passage of such
a motion, a study group composed
of members of both bodies will
be established to work out a set
tlement.
Under the new set-up it is ex
pected that the Board will con
cern itself mainly with matters
involving administration and Uni
versity policies while the Coun
cil's function will be to act on
more general problems of the
fraternity system.
Final Review
All matters passed by the
groups shall be subject to the
final review and by approval of
Sterling, but it is expected that
his opinions will be expressed to
the Board through his represen
tatives on it.
An additional power of the new
Board is the review and approval
of all IFC Judicial Council pro
ceedings and recommendations.
In the event of major decisions,
fraternity spokesmen have hinted
that matters will be referred di
rectly to the Board.
IFC will discuss the new con
stitution at its next Monday night
meeting and a final vote on it is
expected a week from then. Con
current passage of the new bill
through the Legislature is ex
pected.
