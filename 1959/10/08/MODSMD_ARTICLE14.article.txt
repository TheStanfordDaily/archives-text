# Medics Hear from 'Frantic Patient'
## 
### Steve Baffrey Associate Editor 
(Kditor's Note: This con
cludes the Daily's throe-part se
ries on Stanford's new Medical
("enter.)

A man whose organization
gives plenty of money to doctors
and medical research gave the
members of the medical profes
sion polite hell in the midst of
dedication ceremonies for Stan
ford's new Medical Center last
month.
The man was William McPeak,
vice-president of the Ford Foun
dation, who represented what ho
called the "Small, Frantic Voice
of the Patient."
McPeak, who prefaced his criti
cisms with the statement that
"America has probably the best
medical care in the world," felt
that too often our system is run
to the doctors' convenience and
the patients' disadvantage.
Noted Speakers
McPeak was but one of a host
of major speakers who high
lighted the dedication ceremonies.
Included in the list were Frank
Stanton, CHS president; Califor
nia Gov. Edmund G. Brown; Dr.
Vernon VV, Lippai'd, Yale Medical

School Dean; Dr. E. Cowles An
dt'u.s, famous Johns Hopkins car
diologist; Palo Alto Mayor Noel
Porter; Dr. Lester J. Evans, ex
ecutive of the Commonwealth
Fund and Dr. James A. Shannon,
Director of the National Insti
tutes of Health.
Along with these major speak
ers, the dedication program, which
lasted for two days, included a
full-dress academic convocation,
open house tours, and 17 scien
tific symposia conducted by not
able members of the Stanford
faculty.
And the only thing which could
have upset the whole program
managed to come, 1 hough oul of
season, to spoil it. It was on the
big final day that nature opened
up and flooded the Bay Area with
an unprecedented rainstorm. Rut
moving the ceremonies into Me
morial Auditorium solved the
problem.
Modern Machines
Inside the $22 million home
which the City and University
have provided on the campus has
been assembld a great number of
the most modern and advanced
medical machines of our age.


STANFORD'S MKDICAI, IJNKAK ACCKLKKATOK
A Major Advance in Deep Scaled (ancer Treatment
Topping the list as hv far the
most spectacular is Stanford's
own 7 million electron volt medi
cal linear accelerator or "cancer
cannon."
The huge X-ray gun was de
veloped here at Stanford and is
used in research and therapy for
treating deep-seated cancers.
Heart X-rays
Still another machine unique to
Stanford and its research pro
grams is the "Cine-angiocardiog
raphy" device which is better
known as the heart-X-ray cam
era. This device, the work of Dr.
Herbert Abrams of the Medical
School staff, enables researchers
to take motion pictures of func
tions of the heart on two planes.
The films are particularly use
ful for instruction in the cardi
ology field.
Another device now being
worked on by Stanford staff
members is a portable version of
the artificial heart — now used
solely in surgery. Research, it is
hoped, will make it possible for
this machine, and its more com
plex brother, the heart-lung ma
chine, to be used in emergency
cases outside hospitals.
The move of the Med School to

Stanford and the advent of the :
new curriculum plan were bol- i
stered additionally by the addi
tion of highly respected medical
educators to the Stanford fac
ulty.
Nobel Laureate Joshua Leder
berg probably leads the list in
prominence. Doctor Lederberg
won the 1958 prize for his work
in genetics.
A new Department of Genetics
has been established here under

: his supervision.
While their work is in totally
I different areas of the same field,
his wife, Doctor Lederberg, is
another addition to the Stanford
medical faculty.
A former member of the New
York Hospital - Cornell Medical
Center staff and faculty has come
to assume the position as the new
head of the Pediatrics depart
ment. He is Dr. Norman Kretch
mer. -•

From St. Louis to the Medical 1
School is the path travelled by
Dr. Arthur Kornberg, new head
of the Biochemistry Department.
These are but some of the new j
medical education leaders who I
have recently joined the Stanford j
School of Medicine staff. With 1
each has come noted co-workers, I
and beside these are still other
leaders in medicine.
And as with people, the same

general note holds true for ma
chines. Those mentioned above
are but a part of the equipment
stock in the Center and of course
new instruments are being work
ed on daily.
Behind the fancy and beautiful
facade designed by Edward D.
Stone lie the workings of a fancy
hope, that Stanford can bring to
the West, the country, and even
the world, grjeat advances in the
field of medicine.
