cludes the Daily's throe-part se
ries on Stanford's new Medical
("enter.)

A man whose organization
gives plenty of money to doctors
and medical research gave the
members of the medical profes
sion polite hell in the midst of
dedication ceremonies for Stan
ford's new Medical Center last
month.
The man was William McPeak,
vice-president of the Ford Foun
dation, who represented what ho
called the "Small, Frantic Voice
of the Patient."
McPeak, who prefaced his criti
cisms with the statement that
"America has probably the best
medical care in the world," felt
that too often our system is run
to the doctors' convenience and
the patients' disadvantage.
Noted Speakers
McPeak was but one of a host
of major speakers who high
lighted the dedication ceremonies.
Included in the list were Frank
Stanton, CHS president; Califor
nia Gov. Edmund G. Brown; Dr.
Vernon VV, Lippai'd, Yale Medical

School Dean; Dr. E. Cowles An
dt'u.s, famous Johns Hopkins car
diologist; Palo Alto Mayor Noel
Porter; Dr. Lester J. Evans, ex
ecutive of the Commonwealth
Fund and Dr. James A. Shannon,
Director of the National Insti
tutes of Health.
Along with these major speak
ers, the dedication program, which
lasted for two days, included a
full-dress academic convocation,
open house tours, and 17 scien
tific symposia conducted by not
able members of the Stanford
faculty.
And the only thing which could
have upset the whole program
managed to come, 1 hough oul of
season, to spoil it. It was on the
big final day that nature opened
up and flooded the Bay Area with
an unprecedented rainstorm. Rut
moving the ceremonies into Me
morial Auditorium solved the
problem.
Modern Machines
Inside the $22 million home
which the City and University
have provided on the campus has
been assembld a great number of
the most modern and advanced
medical machines of our age.
