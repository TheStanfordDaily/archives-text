# NON-PROFIT?
## SRI Tax Exemption Criticized 
### 
Stanford Research Institute
drew sharp criticism yesterday
over its advantageous income lax
position as a non-profit research
institute.
This criticism came from Lewis
E. Harris of the American Coun
cil of Independent Laboratories,
who claimed that tax-free re
search institutes are unfair com
petition to the private laborato
ries for which he is spokesman.
Harris claimed that tax-exempt
research institutes such as SRI
are engaging mainly in private
research for private clients, rath
er than pursuing only "basic re
search for the public good."
He indicated that only about
six per cent of the dollar volume
of such research organizations
can properly be classified as tax
exempt.
These charges, made at the an
nual meeting of the Council of
Laboratories yesterday in San
Francisco, went unanswered as
SRI spokesmen stated their "re
luctance to dignify them" by re
sponding.
Stanford Research Institute,
which was founded in 1946 at the
behest of the Stanford Board of
Trustees, engages in hundreds of
research projects each year in
such diverse areas as cancer re
search, electronics, studies of gas
pipeline corrosion, economic fore
casts, and selecting the best lo
cation for Disneyland.
SRI enjoys a tax advantage in
that it is a non-profit organiza
tion.
The Institute is affiliated with
the University, but has no opera
tional ties with it. The stated
purpose of SRI includes further
ing the educational purpose of
the University. The Stanford
Trustees are designated the gen
eral members of the corporation
of the Research Institute, and as
such they have many of the pow
ers of ownership, the Inslittue
spokesmen said.
