I'm crushed by some sad news
I got earlier this week. Seems
that pert little Carole McKanna
has loaded up on some 20 units
and won't be the bright star of
this year's Big Game Gaieties.
Admittedly some of you
couldn't care less about this
news, hut I have had a feeling
for about three years that
those of us here now would
someday be able to say "I knew
her when." And so it saddens
ni«- to think that the cutest
voice and c Iv <*v e rest talent
around won't be around any
more.
11 isn't too often that people
rise to stardom in the hectic show
business world of today, but 1
can remember hearing a number
of people predict a fair measure
of success for this local talent,
and (hough they knew far much
more than this writer, I went
along with them.
Carole is an English major who
really looks on acting a.s an in
significant, but fun, kind of side
line activity. This, of course, puts
her into a category numbering
probably more than a million
other Americans. The only dif
ference appears to be that Carole
McKanna has the talent most of
them lack.
Unlike most of her counter
parts, .Miss McKanna is com
pletely unaffected by the fact
that she's never met with an
unfavorable review. To her, it's
all just as much fun 110 matter
what people think of what she
does on a stage.
And more enjoyable yet, .she
isn't the affected young actress
who throws on-stage fits, or re
fuses to perform unless certain
conditions are met.
Instead, she's more likely to
think that anybody who pulls a
trick like that is a creep. (And
of course she's right.)
Carole McKanna first aj>-
peared on a Stanford stage in
the 195(5 Gaieties — a simple
walk-on number entitled "Any
one for Tennis?"
Admitting that ham is defi
nitely a part of her, she went on
to a role in that year's Spring
Show, Cole Porter's "Out of This
World."
After Gaieties in her sopho
more year she managed to sub
tley steal the spotlight in that
Spring's "Call Me Madam" from
a couple of campus stage nota
bles and even a couple of talent
ed more professional outsiders.

Lust year, .Miss McKunna
highlighted another Gaieties
show, then again went 011 to
be the talked-ahout favorite,
Linda English, in "Pal Joey"—

again despite the fact that some
high-up-t he-ladder professional
talent appeared on the same
stage.
Here is a voice which really
isn't rich and deep-throated as
most singing stars' voices are
supposed to be. In fact, it isn't
big or brassy, either, fn further
fact it isn't anything but her own,
and that's why it's interesting.
And as far as her acting is con
cerned, well . . . it's just always
what it should be. Never too
much, never too little, and always
realistic.
So what's the point of it all?
.lust this: here's a girl with the
talent and ability to go on into
a field that most females long
for —and with enough promise
to make a real success of it.
Instead, though, here's a girl
who just wants to graduate in
March so she can get married.
It seems so natural that a gal
who had slipped so easily into
the spotlight would try to slip just
as easily out. And I just don't
want her to get away before con
gratulating her on what she's
done to brighten up Stanford
while she's been here, and wish
ing her luck and good wishes for
when she's not.

I'm crushed by some sad news
I got earlier this week. Seems
that pert little Carole McKanna
has loaded up on some 20 units
and won't be the bright star of
this year's Big Game Gaieties.
Admittedly some of you
couldn't care less about this
news, hut I have had a feeling
for about three years that
those of us here now would
someday be able to say "I knew
her when." And so it saddens
ni«- to think that the cutest
voice and c Iv <*v e rest talent
around won't be around any
more.
11 isn't too often that people
rise to stardom in the hectic show
business world of today, but 1
can remember hearing a number
of people predict a fair measure
of success for this local talent,
and (hough they knew far much
more than this writer, I went
along with them.
Carole is an English major who
really looks on acting a.s an in
significant, but fun, kind of side
line activity. This, of course, puts
her into a category numbering
probably more than a million
other Americans. The only dif
ference appears to be that Carole
McKanna has the talent most of
them lack.
Unlike most of her counter
parts, .Miss McKanna is com
pletely unaffected by the fact
that she's never met with an
unfavorable review. To her, it's
all just as much fun 110 matter
what people think of what she
does on a stage.
And more enjoyable yet, .she
isn't the affected young actress
who throws on-stage fits, or re
fuses to perform unless certain
conditions are met.
Instead, she's more likely to
think that anybody who pulls a
trick like that is a creep. (And
of course she's right.)
Carole McKanna first aj>-
peared on a Stanford stage in
the 195(5 Gaieties — a simple
walk-on number entitled "Any
one for Tennis?"
Admitting that ham is defi
nitely a part of her, she went on
to a role in that year's Spring
Show, Cole Porter's "Out of This
World."
After Gaieties in her sopho
more year she managed to sub
tley steal the spotlight in that
Spring's "Call Me Madam" from
a couple of campus stage nota
bles and even a couple of talent
ed more professional outsiders.

Lust year, .Miss McKunna
highlighted another Gaieties
show, then again went 011 to
be the talked-ahout favorite,
Linda English, in "Pal Joey"—

again despite the fact that some
high-up-t he-ladder professional
talent appeared on the same
stage.
Here is a voice which really
isn't rich and deep-throated as
most singing stars' voices are
supposed to be. In fact, it isn't
big or brassy, either, fn further
fact it isn't anything but her own,
and that's why it's interesting.
And as far as her acting is con
cerned, well . . . it's just always
what it should be. Never too
much, never too little, and always
realistic.
So what's the point of it all?
.lust this: here's a girl with the
talent and ability to go on into
a field that most females long
for —and with enough promise
to make a real success of it.
Instead, though, here's a girl
who just wants to graduate in
March so she can get married.
It seems so natural that a gal
who had slipped so easily into
the spotlight would try to slip just
as easily out. And I just don't
want her to get away before con
gratulating her on what she's
done to brighten up Stanford
while she's been here, and wish
ing her luck and good wishes for
when she's not.

I got earlier this week. Seems
that pert little Carole McKanna
has loaded up on some 20 units
and won't be the bright star of
this year's Big Game Gaieties.
Admittedly some of you
couldn't care less about this
news, hut I have had a feeling
for about three years that
those of us here now would
someday be able to say "I knew
her when." And so it saddens
ni«- to think that the cutest
voice and c Iv <*v e rest talent
around won't be around any
more.
11 isn't too often that people
rise to stardom in the hectic show
business world of today, but 1
can remember hearing a number
of people predict a fair measure
of success for this local talent,
and (hough they knew far much
more than this writer, I went
along with them.
Carole is an English major who
really looks on acting a.s an in
significant, but fun, kind of side
line activity. This, of course, puts
her into a category numbering
probably more than a million
other Americans. The only dif
ference appears to be that Carole
McKanna has the talent most of
them lack.
Unlike most of her counter
parts, .Miss McKanna is com
pletely unaffected by the fact
that she's never met with an
unfavorable review. To her, it's
all just as much fun 110 matter
what people think of what she
does on a stage.
And more enjoyable yet, .she
isn't the affected young actress
who throws on-stage fits, or re
fuses to perform unless certain
conditions are met.
Instead, she's more likely to
think that anybody who pulls a
trick like that is a creep. (And
of course she's right.)
Carole McKanna first aj>-
peared on a Stanford stage in
the 195(5 Gaieties — a simple
walk-on number entitled "Any
one for Tennis?"
Admitting that ham is defi
nitely a part of her, she went on
to a role in that year's Spring
Show, Cole Porter's "Out of This
World."
After Gaieties in her sopho
more year she managed to sub
tley steal the spotlight in that
Spring's "Call Me Madam" from
a couple of campus stage nota
bles and even a couple of talent
ed more professional outsiders.

Lust year, .Miss McKunna
highlighted another Gaieties
show, then again went 011 to
be the talked-ahout favorite,
Linda English, in "Pal Joey"—

again despite the fact that some
high-up-t he-ladder professional
talent appeared on the same
stage.
Here is a voice which really
isn't rich and deep-throated as
most singing stars' voices are
supposed to be. In fact, it isn't
big or brassy, either, fn further
fact it isn't anything but her own,
and that's why it's interesting.
And as far as her acting is con
cerned, well . . . it's just always
what it should be. Never too
much, never too little, and always
realistic.
So what's the point of it all?
.lust this: here's a girl with the
talent and ability to go on into
a field that most females long
for —and with enough promise
to make a real success of it.
Instead, though, here's a girl
who just wants to graduate in
March so she can get married.
It seems so natural that a gal
who had slipped so easily into
the spotlight would try to slip just
as easily out. And I just don't
want her to get away before con
gratulating her on what she's
done to brighten up Stanford
while she's been here, and wish
ing her luck and good wishes for
when she's not.
