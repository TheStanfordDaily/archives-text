Although there was little dra
ma about them, the meetings last
week in Washington of the World
Hank and the Monetary Fund
marked a turning point in our
lime. In our relations with the
economically advanced countries
of Western Europe and of Japan,
the post-war period has come to
an end.
For our principal allies and
principal enemies alike, the
devastation and ttie dislocation
of the war meant a period of
years, roughly ten, for recon
struction and recovery. During
this period of reconstruction
their greatest need was a sup
ply of hard currency, of which
the dollar was the chief exam
ple.
The great American measures,
l>eginning with the Marshall Plan
and including many others, were
designed to overcome the short
age of dollars, of which we had a
surplus and our allies and ene
mies a deficit.
This policy has boon brilliantly
successful. Japan and the indus
trial part of Western Europe not
only made a full recovery but are
in a condition of expanding pros
perity, and indeed of boom.
For them the dollar shortage
has been turned into a dollar
surplus, and it is self-evident,
as their financial representa
tives in Washington have been
the first to admit, that they
must now take their place as
partners rather than as depend
ent relations in tlx* task of
financing the development of
the under-developed countries
of the world.

This change has become visible
I in the past two years. Since the
! last quarter of 1957, it is the
| United States, not the principal
! beneficiaries of the Marshall
; Plan, which has been running a
deficit in its balance of payments.
These deficits are now growing.
During 1958 the deficit amounted
!to over three billion dollars. In
the first six months of this year,
1959, the deficit has been even
higher than in the first six
months of 1958.
During the second quarter of
; this year 1959 (April to June),
112 or e ik n countries increased,
through their transactions with
the United States, their gold
and dollar assets by well over a
billion, actually by 1,1(50 mil
lion.
This does not include new capi
tal contributions to the Interna
! lional Monetary Fund. Most of
! Ihis rise in liquid funds accrued
to the industrially advanced coun
i tries of' Europe and to Japan.
If the United States is to re
| main the chief banker of the non-
Communist world and some
| body will have to play that role
we cannot afford to lose gold
at the rate we have been losing
i it during the past year.
Our gold reserve is, to be
sure, the largest in the world
Kven after the recent losses it
is still nearly 20 billion dollars.
But as against these reserves
we have outstanding foreign
liabilities of over 15 billion. An
other year or so of the deficit
we are now running, would
make the position very light,
