# U.S. Position On W. Berlin Clears Haze
## 
### J.M. ROBERTS Associated Press News Analyst 
Secretary of Stale Christian A.
Herter's statement that the West
ern Allies will maintain their
military occupation of West Ber
lin until Germany is unified set
tles a point over which some haze
had been cast by recent general
ized statements.
Alter Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev's visit, President
Kisenhower, obviously desiring
to avoid being pushed into any
definitive statements about
what might or might not bap
pen at a summit conference,
said the United States, position
about these things did not ne
cessarily have to remain fixed
always.
This caused some disturbance
in Germany, where it was l'eared
Allied desires for greater accom
modation with the Soviet Union
might lead them into some sort
of settlement opening West Ber
lin to greater Communist influ
ence.
Herter's statement means that
suggestions for neutral control in
West Berlin, such as a U.N. force,
are unacceptable along with
Khrushchev's idea for a so-called
free city.
It does not mean, however,
that (here can be no negotiation
regarding tbe size of occupa
tion forces, or the cessation of
free world propaganda and es
pionage activities which use
Berlin as a base.
Propaganda and espionage are,
however, fields in which dividing
lines are so vague they can al
most never be controlled by for
mal agreements but only through
the existence of trust between
nations.
The United States and Britain,
for instance, almost never have
any trouble about it. No such
good will exists between the Al
lies and the Soviet Union, nor will
it ever as long as totalitarianism
and communism are tied together
in Moscow.
Secretary Herter's reticence
about his hopes for results at a
summit conference tend to for
malize the general impression
that as a continuation of the
talk, talk which has so far pre
vented a crisis over Berlin, the
conference will be a success,
though 110 settlements are pro
duced.
Nevertheless it becomes in
creasingly obvious that tensions
have been relaxed only because
the Allies have stood so firm
about their rights in Berlin that
the Kremlin is not prepared to
risk further pushing at this time.
Basically the problems of Ger
many. the middle ground, will be
settled only with over-all settle
ment of the cold war itself.
