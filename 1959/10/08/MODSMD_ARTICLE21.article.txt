A First
Last Saturday, for the first time in this writer's life he was able
to pick up the morning newspaper and actually feel a wave of satis
faction in seeing that the USC Trojans had triumphed in their week
end football activity.
The Trojans with some fine play from a sophomore quarterback,
Ben Charles, really put the bite on Ohio Slate's Buckeyes and dumped
the Big Ten powerhouse 17-0.
For marry of the last few years Ohio State with its machine-like
offense has reeled off two and three yards at a time chewing up
opponents with their superior depth, size, and power.

Despite the fact that the Buck
eyes have rolled up such a suc
cessful record they have always
left this writer a little cold. There
is rrothing more boring than go
ing out to a football game and
spending the entire afternoon
watching the two teams run a
succession of line plunges and
off tackle plays. The ball carrier
takes about two steps and is bur
ied in a maze of blockers, tac
klers, and referees. Just about
the time everyone is dug out and
unstacked, the procedure begins
all over again.
Ohio State has stuck to this
procedure right along as have
several other Big Ten teams, and
unfortunately, they have always
managed to keep a more than
respectable record.
The strength of most of the
powerhouses such as Ohio State
rests on their ability to dig
enough coal miners or farmboys
out of the back country to put
together a line that would make

any Texas steer rancher look in awe. Football rather than a science
becomes a game of pure brute strength.
USC, which is fast resembling one of that school's all time best
grid teams, went to the air' and was able to show enough finesse to
throw Coach Woody Hayes' Buckeyes into a state of panic.
Once a team that relies on the slow grind-them-out method of
offense gets a couple of touchdowns behind, they're practically lost
because it takes them so long to move up the field.
In contrast to the powerhouse football, Stanford has always main
tained a style of ball that has some semblance of variety and ex
citement.
The offense that Coach Jack Curtice has employed in the two
years he has been at Stanford, if not always effective, has always
l>een interesting.
A Scare in the Midwest
Two weeks ago when Curtice and his aerial-minded team went to
Wisconsin to play what was then rated the number four team in the
nation, the experts had placed them a 19-point underdog. Many
people thought this was being charitable at that. The Badgers were
u big, hard running, but slow team. The Indians Dick Norman be
gan throwing and before the afternoon was over Wisconsin Coach
.Milt Bruhn, and his Badger players had the scare of their lives. The
Badgers won the game but only by two points.
Oddly enough the local sportswriters and fans in Madison, rather
than being disappointed over the fact that their highly rated Badgers
could only squeak out a 2-point win over an unrated team, were
very excited over this wide open football that came to play Wisconsin.
Several writers from Chicago and Milwaukee couldn't hear or talk
enough about this Norman kid who threw passes from every angle.
One Wisconsin student said that if their team could create as
much excitement, he might even give up his flask until after Ihe
game was over.

Two weeks ago when Curtice and his aerial-minded team went to
Wisconsin to play what was then rated the number four team in the
nation, the experts had placed them a 19-point underdog. Many
people thought this was being charitable at that. The Badgers were
u big, hard running, but slow team. The Indians Dick Norman be
gan throwing and before the afternoon was over Wisconsin Coach
.Milt Bruhn, and his Badger players had the scare of their lives. The
Badgers won the game but only by two points.
Oddly enough the local sportswriters and fans in Madison, rather
than being disappointed over the fact that their highly rated Badgers
could only squeak out a 2-point win over an unrated team, were
very excited over this wide open football that came to play Wisconsin.
Several writers from Chicago and Milwaukee couldn't hear or talk
enough about this Norman kid who threw passes from every angle.
One Wisconsin student said that if their team could create as
much excitement, he might even give up his flask until after Ihe
game was over.

Last Saturday, for the first time in this writer's life he was able
to pick up the morning newspaper and actually feel a wave of satis
faction in seeing that the USC Trojans had triumphed in their week
end football activity.
The Trojans with some fine play from a sophomore quarterback,
Ben Charles, really put the bite on Ohio Slate's Buckeyes and dumped
the Big Ten powerhouse 17-0.
For marry of the last few years Ohio State with its machine-like
offense has reeled off two and three yards at a time chewing up
opponents with their superior depth, size, and power.

Despite the fact that the Buck
eyes have rolled up such a suc
cessful record they have always
left this writer a little cold. There
is rrothing more boring than go
ing out to a football game and
spending the entire afternoon
watching the two teams run a
succession of line plunges and
off tackle plays. The ball carrier
takes about two steps and is bur
ied in a maze of blockers, tac
klers, and referees. Just about
the time everyone is dug out and
unstacked, the procedure begins
all over again.
Ohio State has stuck to this
procedure right along as have
several other Big Ten teams, and
unfortunately, they have always
managed to keep a more than
respectable record.
The strength of most of the
powerhouses such as Ohio State
rests on their ability to dig
enough coal miners or farmboys
out of the back country to put
together a line that would make

any Texas steer rancher look in awe. Football rather than a science
becomes a game of pure brute strength.
USC, which is fast resembling one of that school's all time best
grid teams, went to the air' and was able to show enough finesse to
throw Coach Woody Hayes' Buckeyes into a state of panic.
Once a team that relies on the slow grind-them-out method of
offense gets a couple of touchdowns behind, they're practically lost
because it takes them so long to move up the field.
In contrast to the powerhouse football, Stanford has always main
tained a style of ball that has some semblance of variety and ex
citement.
The offense that Coach Jack Curtice has employed in the two
years he has been at Stanford, if not always effective, has always
l>een interesting.
A Scare in the Midwest
