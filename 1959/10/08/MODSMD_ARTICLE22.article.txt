## Injured Gridders Return to Action Daily Sports 
### Russ Allen 
There was good news from the Stanford camp today as Card
gridders prepared for their Saturday clash with the Washington
Huskies. Guard Ron Fernandes, out for two weeks with a knee
injury, was pronounced able to play and will see action against the
Huskies in Seattle this weekend.
Trainer Connie Jarvis said that "the boys are in fine shape for-

tius time 01 year ana are botnerea
only with minor bumps and
bruises."
The only exception to the good
condition of the Tribe squad is
center Doug Pursell who stayed
in from practice to have a strain
in his neck checked. Pursell is
scheduled to make the trip and
will play—but he may be ham
pered with that injury.
The Indians have worked on de
fensing the multiple offense- the
"Swing T"—of the Huskies this
week in drills and will probably
go with the 6-2-2-1 defense with
variations that they used success
fully against COP last weekend.
Quarterback Dick Norman, still
leading the nation in total of
fense anrl passing after three
games, will be ready to throw
against the Huskies.
Stanford receivers, led by cap
tain Chris Burford who tops the
nation in pass receiving, should
find the Huskies a little tougher
this year than in year-s gone by.
Washington defense secondary
has intercepted seven opponent
passes for 91 yards and two TD's.
However, Card gridders are
counting that the Norman to Bur
ford, Robinson or Bowers passes
will electrify the Seattle crowd
and stop ihe Huskies.
