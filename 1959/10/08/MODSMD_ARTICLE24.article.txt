# Soccer Mentor Welcomes Strong Squad With Optimism
## 
### Glenn Alford 
Stanford soccer coach Fred
Priddle, the man who should
know, claims that Stanford is the
team to end USF's reign of ter
ror on West Coast soccer. A well
rounded team, led by high-scorers
forward Rune Engebretsen and
right inside Dick Bartlett and de
fensive standout center halfback
Wolfgang Storeh, should be suf
ficient to demolish the dynasty
established by USF in the last few
years.
Lose All-American
Stanford's soccer hopes were
dealt a blow early in the year
when it looked a-s if All-American
goalie Bill Dittman would be lost
for the rest of the season with an
attack of mononucleosis, but now

JL
it appears that Dittman will be
back in time to play in all but
two of the league games.
Meanwhile, Tony Chanler has
been such an excellent replace
ment for Dittman that there has
been little or no loss in the team's
overall strength.
Cards Triumph
Stanford has played one game
to date, edging Balboa of San
Francisco 7-6. Engebretsen scored
four goals, Bartlett had two and
Storch had one.
This Saturday, at Davis, the
soccer team will play its first
league game, taking on the Cal
Aggies. This game should give a
true indication of the team's
strength.
The lineup for Saturday's game
includes Chanler, goalie; Tom
Lief, light fullback; Dan Far
thing, left fullback; Storch, cen
ter halfback; Russ Williams, right
halfback; Charles Leonard, left
halfback; Adam Bianchi, right
wing; Bartlett, right inside; En
gebretsen, center forward; Bernie
Knaggs, left inside, and Mike Tip
pet t, left wing.
