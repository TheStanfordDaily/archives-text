# Indian Water Polo Squad Ready on Short Notice
## 
### Rick Walker 
Stanford will field its first wa
ter polo team in four years this
quarter. The return of this popu
lar spectator sport was made pos
sible when the swimming season
was changed from spring to win
ter quarter.
The problem confronting coach
Tom Haynie now is how to round
his squad into workable shape
with only two weeks' practice.
"They will only get in six work
outs together as a team before
their first meet," he moaned.
The short practice time is a re
sult of Stanford's late registra
tion date which gives other

schools a one- to three-week head
start on the Indians.
Fortunately, the squad is
blessed with a handful of expe
rienced players, mostly veterans
of high school polo. Such an indi
vidual is Bob Spence, an El Se
gundo ace, whose experience and
timing will make him an integral
member of the squad.
A wide variety of shots and
good ball-handling ability should
make Bob Lorton, center forward,
one of the team's highest scorers.
Definitely a man to watch will
be guard George Harrison, whose
speed and maneuverability will
help him to outdistance myny a
surprised opponent.

"They will only get in six work
outs together as a team before
their first meet," he moaned.
The short practice time is a re
sult of Stanford's late registra
tion date which gives other

schools a one- to three-week head
start on the Indians.
Fortunately, the squad is
blessed with a handful of expe
rienced players, mostly veterans
of high school polo. Such an indi
vidual is Bob Spence, an El Se
gundo ace, whose experience and
timing will make him an integral
member of the squad.
A wide variety of shots and
good ball-handling ability should
make Bob Lorton, center forward,
one of the team's highest scorers.
Definitely a man to watch will
be guard George Harrison, whose
speed and maneuverability will
help him to outdistance myny a
surprised opponent.
