# Will Caruso Win Again?
## 
### 
Another battle of popularity
between rock 'n' rollers and
classicists, such as last year's ,
Presley vs. Caruso bout, is ex
pected in KGO's current "Fa- j
vorite Artist" contest.
Last year a group of Stan
ford students, led by John
Frankenstein, organized the
college vote and pushed Enrico
Caruso into the top spot, clob
bering Elvis. The result: four
solid hours of Caruso.
Disk Jockey Jim Lange said
card and letter votes should be
addressed to "Favorite Artist"
contest, KGO Radio, 277 Golden
Gate Ave., San Francisco 2.
