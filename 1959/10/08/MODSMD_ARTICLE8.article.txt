### 
PITTSBURGH, Pa. CP) —Steel negotiators despaired yesterday of
a strike peace pact on the eve of President Eisenhower's apparent
deadline for government intervention under the Taft-Hartley Act.
At the same time, the President's fact-finders worked at top speed
to deliver to the White House a report designed to send 83,000

striking dock workers back to
work under a court order.
President David J. McDonald of
the United Steelvvorkers Union,
saying a negotiated settlement
seemed hopeless, sent the union's
170-man Wage Policy Committee
home. The group would have to .
approve any new contract.
The on - and • off negotiations !
were again suspended with no;
further meetings in prospect to
end the crippling 85-day steel j
strike worst in steel history.
Longshoremen
Meanwhile, the three-man fact !
finding panel zipped through a
public hearing on the week-old In
ternational Longshoremen's Asso
ciation strike in 1% hours.
Under the Taft - Hartley law's
emergency machinery, the fact
finders' report must precede court
action.
J us t i c e Department officials
stood ready to seek the Taft-Hart
ley Act injunction against the
dock strikers today in Federal
District Court in New York City.
If the federal court agrees to
order an 80-day cooling-off pe
riod, longshore work gangs may
start tomorrow to move the piled
up cargoes which have been chok
ing Atlantic ports from Maine to
Texa-s for the last week.
Steel
In Pittsburgh, neither the steel j
industry nor USW would budge |
from its stand after a "summit j
meeting" between McDonald andj
top industry executives got no
where Tuesday night.
Eisenhower said a week ago ho
wanted a settlement on the steel
strike by the time he returns to
Washington today.
McDonald said that if Eisen
hower invokes the Taft-Hartley
Act and seeks to stop the strike
for 80 days under a court injunc
tion, the USW will fight the in
junction attempt in the courts.
