# T-H Mandate Stops Walkout
## 
### 
NEW YORK (/P) A week-old strike of clock workers on the At
lantic and Gulf coasts was ended last night by a federal court
Taft-Hartley mandate.
Union leaders immediately ordered 85,000 longshoremen back to
piers from Maine to Texas. Waterfront activity was expected to
return to normal Friday. —

Federal District Judge Irvin R.
Kaufman issued an order re
straining the International Long
shoremen's Association from fur
ther strike action. It is good for
10 days. A hearing was scheduled
for Oct. 15 on the government's
request for an injunction provid
ing an 80-day cooling-off period
under the Taft-Hartley law.
The attorney general's office
went into court at the direction
of President Eisenhower.
Officials of the ILA had an-[
nounced in advance that they j
would comply with any court or
der to halt their strike.
The law requires a cooling-off
period of up to 80 days during
which efforts will be made to J
reach an agreement over contract I
terms between the ILA and the j
shippers.
Strike History
The strike began Oct. 1 and lied j
up more than 200 ships. None of
the big passenger liners were af-;
fected. But thousands upon thou- j
sands of tons of cargo were j
stranded, some of it perishable.
The union struck with the ex- I
piration of its old contract. It had
been seeking in negotiations to j
win a 40-ccnt hourly wage in- 1
crease, along with increased pen
sion and other welfare benefits, i
The old New York contract pro-;
vided a basic $2.80-an-hour wage.
The shippers offered a 30-cent j
hourly package increase over a j
three-year period in return for
more leeway in using automation
for cargo handling. It was this j
demand that rankled the ILA, j
which contended it would cut
down the amount of work avail
able to its members.
President Eisenhower ordered
Taft - Hartley action on the;
grounds that the strike imperiled
national health and safety and af
fected the food supply of 22 mil
lion persons in the strike area.

Meanwhile, there wa« no imme- j
diate sign of any action by the
President on the steel strike.
There have been no steel nego
tiations since Tuesday night when ■
top leaders of the industry and
the striking United Steelworkers I
of America throw up their hands i
in despair of reaching a now con-i
tract agreement.

period of up to 80 days during
which efforts will be made to J
reach an agreement over contract I
terms between the ILA and the j
shippers.
Strike History
The strike began Oct. 1 and lied j
up more than 200 ships. None of
the big passenger liners were af-;
fected. But thousands upon thou- j
sands of tons of cargo were j
stranded, some of it perishable.
The union struck with the ex- I
piration of its old contract. It had
been seeking in negotiations to j
win a 40-ccnt hourly wage in- 1
crease, along with increased pen
sion and other welfare benefits, i
The old New York contract pro-;
vided a basic $2.80-an-hour wage.
The shippers offered a 30-cent j
hourly package increase over a j
three-year period in return for
more leeway in using automation
for cargo handling. It was this j
demand that rankled the ILA, j
which contended it would cut
down the amount of work avail
able to its members.
President Eisenhower ordered
Taft - Hartley action on the;
grounds that the strike imperiled
national health and safety and af
fected the food supply of 22 mil
lion persons in the strike area.
Steel Strike
Meanwhile, there wa« no imme- j
diate sign of any action by the
President on the steel strike.
There have been no steel nego
tiations since Tuesday night when ■
top leaders of the industry and
the striking United Steelworkers I
of America throw up their hands i
in despair of reaching a now con-i
tract agreement.
NEW YORK (/P) A week-old strike of clock workers on the At
lantic and Gulf coasts was ended last night by a federal court

ther strike action. It is good for
