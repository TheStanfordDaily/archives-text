Averill Harriman, former gov
ernor of New York, will be the
keynote speaker at the Institute
of International Relations' For
eign Policy Institute on Jan. 13-
14, 1960. The announcement of
Harriman's appearance was made
last night to the student Legis
lature by lIR President A 1 Kahn.
While the Harriman announce
ment was probably the most ex
citing of the evening's business,
the group did discuss and refer
to the Student Affairs Committee
a thorny problem which has re
i eently been brought into the cam
pus spotlight.
The problem is that posed by
a lack of privileges for married
students' wives.
A married student representa
tive, Ed Warren, brought the
issue to LASSU's attention citing
examples of high-priced football
tickets and lack of library privi
leges.
Three provisions up for second
j readings were also passed by the
1 group. One includes a statement
of objectives for the lIR, another
allows changes in the Branner
constitution, and the third pro
vides for flam's Head ticket price
and salary changes.
I In addition, the body sent into
| By-Laws Committee two new stu
| dent group constitutions. One is
j the new Interfraternity docu
| ment, the other for a new Stan
j ford Press Club.
In a carryover from last week,
the group further discussed a
$200 appropriation to Cardinals
for its scheduled all-campus Big
Game Dance, though did not ap
proach reconsidering it.
Two foreign scholars expressed
thanks for ASSU generosity.
