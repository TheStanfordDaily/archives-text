# IFC'S Forward Step
## 
### 
Stan komi's I\ti hi iuti kmty Council will soon voir on a new con
stitution which, ii appears, will lie a significant step forward in
111 <• solution of fraternity problems on 111 is campus.
As out lined in ve>terdav"« Dailv, the new eonsl il ul ion will bring
together fralernilv men ami faculty and administration representa
tives for the settlement of major problems which may arise.
It is difficult not to \ iew this as a forward step w hen one remem
bers the decision procedure of the past. IF( 1 and its internal bodies
recommended actions which were then scnl to the lop administra
tive echelons for approval.
At no point in the formal workings of the old system was there
an official opportunity for representatives from both camps to
meet and, by organizational order, come to a mediated decision.
It appears that both sides are enthused at the opportunity which
is presented in the new document; this enthusiasm is indicative of
what should emerge after final passage of the document.
liolh the University administration and the IFC will move into
this era of increased co-operation expecting times of peace. It
appears that inherent in the document are the necessarv measures
for such peace.
One thing appears certain neither group will find itself in
the position of having to make an extreme policy decision with an
eve only tow ard usin;i that decision as a basis for bargaining toward
a more moderate filial verdict.
Faeh side has a necessarv check on the act ions of Ihe other. IF( 1
will have the council's needed approval vote of the new hoard's
action, and the administration has the final approval check of
President Sterling.
\\ bile the president's is obviously the stronger, il is reasonable
to assume that his position on fraternity affairs will he voiced by
his representative on the board.
I'll us, a board decision can be expected to be final, and not
merely a prelude toward disagreement and misunderstanding as
is the case under the present system.
