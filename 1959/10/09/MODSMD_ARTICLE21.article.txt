Students at Cal are a bit bitter
because of the new AAWU agree
ment on seating at away football
games. It se<jms that Cal rooters,
at this year's Big Game, will not
get their usual 50-yard line seats.
Because of t lie Biff Five
agreement, Stanford season
ticket holders will get the mid
section seats, while the Cal kid
dies will have to be satisfied
with seats extending from the
40-yard line to behind the goal
line.
Ah, the season's off to a good
start!
Football bleachers are also in
the news at the University of
Oregon. Seems a "fine old Ore
gon tradition," seat-saving, is be
ing carried to extremes. A recent
letter to the editor asking for
student pressure in the IFC com
plains that fraternity pledge
classes are marched over and told
to save seats for the brotherhood,
and when the gates open most of
Ihe people are caught in a smash
as the pledges rush for their sta
tions.
"By the time one gets to Ihe
stands it looks like a set-up for
a Memorial Day parade. There
are ropes strung and people
standing all over in grim little
groups. You are told to 'move
on, buster,' 'you can't sit here,'
and other such phraseology,
more or less crudely framed."
Kansas' marching band is go
ing to be smaller than usual this
year and ihe student director is
putting the blame on science.
Kansas, ho says, likes to use a
marching hand of 100 men. This
year, however, only 80 have turn
ed up.
"University hands throughout
the country are experiencing
musician shortages because of
the scientific age," commented
the director. "Men are spend
ing their time in engineering
and science."
Ah. these South American tem
peraments! It seems that row
dies at the National College of

Guayaquil, Ecuador, couldn't take
the strutting of scantily clad ma
jorettes. In the riot that ensued,
a police car was overturned, two
persons were killed and four in
jured.
San Jose State has ruled out
card stunts at games for the rest
of the year. The rally committee
chairman explained the decision
as the result of SJS's recent
game: "The stunts were terrible
and the students just aren't in
terested."
Maybe there is hope for lially
Com after all.
Most returning students are
impressed with the academic
heights reached by the entering
frosh, but how would it feel to
have this happen on the Farm?
UCLA, in cooperation with 11
local high schools, is letting 102
high school seniors take univer
sity courses concurrently with
their high school work.
Eli Sobel, Associate Dean of
the special honors program, ex
plained the purpose of the pro
gram: "First it aims to help the
students toward advanced cred
it. More generally the purpose
is to allow the student to ac
celerate intellectually, to find
new stimulation and motivation
which lie might lack in high
school."

Wouldn't it be just great to go
into the RBR and come out two
hours later to find your bicycle
had been impounded because it
had been illegally parked? This
is what happened recently at the
University of Michigan's Under
graduate Library.
Thirty-two bikes were picked
up because they were not parked
in the nearby hike stalls. Sev
eral bikes showed scraps of warn
ing stickers glued to the seats.
The warning stickers have been
isued by the library as a warning
to leave ihe library entrance clear
and uncluttered.
Parking problems everywhere,
aren't there?
