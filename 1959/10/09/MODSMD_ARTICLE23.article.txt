# EXCHANGE VISITS
## U.S., Russia Near Atomic Cooperation 
### J.M. ROBERTS Associated Press News Analyst 
The United States and the So- J
viet Union are heading, in the j.
fields of atomic energy and space
research, for the first real test of
their abilitv to cooperate since
World War 11.
John A. McCone, chairman of
t li<> U.S. Atomic Energy Com
! mission, has gone to the Soviet
Union under an exchange agree
; mcnt to inspect peaceful atomic
energy installations.
The exchange agreement is ex
pected to lead to more formal and
more complete cooperation in the
whole field.
The Soviet representatives in
the United Nations have just
come forward with their first
suggestion in many years which
has been received with prompt
warmth by both the United States
and Britain. It is for an interna
tional conference under U.N. aus
pices to arrange for the exchange
of information on outer space.
For years serious students of
the cold war have considered
step-by-step cooperation <o be i
one of the requirements for at
tainment of a feeling of mutual
trust looking toward more im- j
portant settlements. The search
1 lias not been rewarding.
Even during the International
I Geophysical Year exchange of
scientific information ran into
snags whenever any political con
notation arose.
There is already a great ad
vance in the exchange of general
scientific information, however,
especially whenever scientists
I meet as they did at the Geneva
I conference on peaceful uses of
I atomic energy.
It is the gradual creation of
an atmosphere of cooperation
in which political students are
chiefly interested, however.
The question now is whether
under scientific exchange agree
ments the Russians will cooper
ate in anything except what gives
them the major share of profit.
