# Frosh, Brave Grid Squads Open Seasons Tomorrow
## 
### 
"The best football game on the
Peninsula this weekend," accord
ing to Stanford Freshman Coach
Homer Smith, will be the annual
contest between the Stanford
Frosh and the Indian Junior Var
sity Saturday morning at 9:30 in
Stanford Stadium. Since both
teams feature the same wide-open
offense used by Jack Curtice's
Card varsity, this should be a
startling offensive battle.
The JV's, coached by Jack Mc-
Kenna and George Pesut, should
rate as slight favorites, having
practiced as a team since Sept. 1,
while the frosh didn't suit up un
til Sept. 30. Key figures in the
Brave attack will be Bob Price,
19f58 freshman quarterback, Gary
Craig and Toby flecker at the
halfback slots, and Frank Atkin
son, Bob Drakulich, Dick Cook,
and Chuck Morehouse up front.
The freshmen are working hard
to prepare for their game Oct. 17
gainst Cal's Frosh. All hough the
battle for most starting positions
is still unresolved, several boys
have shown up as standouts in
early sessions for the freshmen.
Among the backs, Ed Cummins
from Anaconda, Montana, has
impressed with his fine hustle
and all-around play. Cummins is
6-1 and 180 pounds and does the
most of the backfield blocking.
Top play by an interior line
man has been turned in by Stan-
Rounds. 6-2, 205-pound guard from
Yuba City. Starr excels especi

ally on defense. The most effec
tive wide runner among the Pa
pooses is right halfback Mick
Doherty. Doherty is 6-1 and 200
pounds and played for St. Igna
tius of San Francisco.
