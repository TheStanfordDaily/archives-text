# Bears to Battle Fighting Irish
## 
### 
Battered Bears of Berkeley,
losers of their last two games,
take on Notre Dame's fighting
Irish at home tomorrow in the
feature game of the AAWU slate.
Notre Dame rates as heavy fa
vorite on the strength of George
Izo's passing and an explosive
running attack. The Irish are in
their first year under Coach Joe
Kuharich.
California was cheered by the
return to action of its two top
quarterbacks, Larry Parque and
Wayne Crow, who were injured
in the Texas game last week.
Parque worked out yesterday
with a brace on his injured shoul
der and Crow limped on a heavily
taped ankle. Both were able to
hit iheir receivers.
UCLA will take advantage of a
bye 1o recover from its 2.1-21 up
set loss to Pittsburgh. Southern
California also takes a week's
rest after whipping powerful
Ohio State last week 17-0.
