amazing Dodgers became the first
club in modern baseball to climb
from seventh place to a world
championship in one year when

24-year-old Sherry in four relief
jobs. Sherry joined Los Angeles

the third. The Dodgers proceed
ed to batter Early Wynn and Dick
Donovan for six big runs in a
frantic fourth inning.
