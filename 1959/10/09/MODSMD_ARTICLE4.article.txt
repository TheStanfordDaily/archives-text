LOS ANGF:LES (/P)â€” Fraternity
men at the University of South-
I ern California are on the carpet
! again.
The school is investigating a
; riot Wednesday night in which
1 1,000 youths from the school's
Fraternity Row set off a false
alarm, ignited a smoke bomb, lit
a huge bonfire, chanted obsceni
ties at newsmen, and hanged the
president of the school in effigy.
Last month a pledge choked to
I death while trying to swallow a
piece of raw liver during a Kappa
Sigma fraternity initiation. The
fraternity chapter was subse
quently closed, and stiff new
rules for fraternities and sorori
ties were ordered.
USC officials said Wednesday
night's riot was the result of stu
' dents' displeasure over the new
rules. They required that adult
advisers be present at all formal
and informal initiations, and or
dered restrictions on houses
' whose members' grade average
falls below the grade average for
| all students.
Dr. Norman Topping, who was
j burned in effigy, wasn't available
for comment.
