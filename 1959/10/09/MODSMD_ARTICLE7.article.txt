parties had roughly 6 per cent.
But the popular vote did not
gauge the national result, which
was based solely upon the polling
in the individual districts. Voters
in each of these voted for the
man or woman they wanted to
send to the House of Commons.
Only the voters in Macmillan's
and Gaitskell's home districts had
a chance to cast a ballot for
either leader personally.
Sir Winston Churchill, nearing
85, was re-elected to Parliament.
LONDON, Friday (/P) — The
Conservatives, led by Prime Min
ister Harold Macmillan, scored a
great victory in Thursday's elec
tion, winning an unprecedented
third term of office. The Labor
Party was routed.
Macmillan rode to triumph on
a wave of British prosperity cou
pled with a foreign policy calling
for forthright dealing with the
Soviet Union on H-bomb and
other problems.
Summit Appeal
The British electorate gave the
65-year-old Prime Minister a vote
of confidence on his pica that ho
could best represent this nation
at a summit conference.
The Conservatives, who won a
five-year term are generally clos
er to the foreign policy of the
United States than are the Labor
ites. Labor is Britain's Socialist
party.
House of Commons Victory
All indications early Friday
were that the Conservatives
would emerge from final elec
tion returns with a majority far
greater than the 53-seat margin
they held over other parties in
the 630 seat House of Commons.
Hugh Gaitskell, the Laboi
Party leader who would have be
come prime minister had his
party won, conceded defeat less
than four hours after the polls
closed.
Popular Vote Close
.Returns from 275 districts of
630 gave the Conservatives in
round numbers 49 per cent of the
popular vole and the Laborites 45
per cent. The Liberals and splinter
parties had roughly 6 per cent.
But the popular vote did not
gauge the national result, which
was based solely upon the polling
in the individual districts. Voters
in each of these voted for the
man or woman they wanted to
send to the House of Commons.
Only the voters in Macmillan's
and Gaitskell's home districts had
a chance to cast a ballot for
either leader personally.
Sir Winston Churchill, nearing
85, was re-elected to Parliament.
