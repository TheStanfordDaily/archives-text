# Student Hurt When Gang Crashes Party
## 
### 
A Stanford student was injured Friday night when a party that
he was chaperoning was "raided" by a gang of 25 teenagers.
Tom While, sophomore, was treated at Palo Alto Hospital for a
broken nose and other minor bruises that he suffered while resisting
the crashing attempt at a party for his brother in their Ladera home.

White and Fred Michaud, both
members of Delta Kappa Epsilon,
had been asked to chaperone the
affair.
The crashers, who had been at
tending another party nearby,
walked into the house through
three unlocked doors—and were
gone by the time police arrived.
Leave Quickly
As the mob entered the house,
White told them, "You'd better
get out—the police are coming."
One man said something to White
and then hit him in the face,
knocking him down. There was
more pushing and shoving, and
then the intruders left.
A vase and porch post were
broken and a hole smashed in a
hallway wall during the brief at
tack. No weapons were used in
the fight.
Identities of 15 of the crashers
was learned by Saturday after
noon and they were ordered to
appear at the Redwood City sher
iff's office. One suspect, Jerry
Duane Ahrens, 20, of Palo Alto,
was arrested after admitting he
had slugged White.
Party for Brother
The party had previously been
reported as a fraternity pledge
affair. White, however, said that
the party was for the friends of
his brother, Merton, 15, and that
he and Michaud were the only
college students present.
White had been asked by his
grandmother, Mrs. H. A. Hinds,
to chaperone the gathering. The
boys are sons of Wayne B. White,
technical program coordinator
for Stanford Research Institute.
Their parents are currently in
Europe and Mrs. Hinds was stay
ing with the boys.
