# Nurses Find Ventura Convenient, Isolated
## 
### Daryl Glenney 
The opening of Ventura Hall,
the campus residence for stu
dent nurses, poses a new problem
in integration should women en
rolled in Stanford's nursing pro
gram be isolated after their first
two years, or should they remain
part of the general student body
and participate in the customary
"house system" of campus hous
ing?
Marylyn Crooker, a Ventura
junior in her first year of stu
dent-nursing, agreed that living
on the edge of the campus, adja
cent to the new Med Center, is
convenient. "But," she added "this
develops little or no contact with
the general student body, making
it hard for the nurses to feel a
part of Stanford."
Proximity Appreciated
Since the nursing school has
previously been located in San
Francisco, completely removed
from the Stanford campus, many
of the senior students at Ventura
appreciate the relative proximity
of the new hall.
"This is like a palace, compared
to tho old stuff in San Francisco,"
senior Betty Matthewsou stated
enthusiastically.
Nancy Bernaseoni said, "After
living my first year completely
away from the campus, I feel
more a part of the student body
living in Ventura."
A fifth-year student, Alissa
Steelman, thinks "the nursing j
students don't lit in too well with

the undergrads. Wo can fool a
lot more independent hero than
we would in regular dorms."
Value filed
Most of the Ventura girls agreed
on the value of living with follow
nursing students exclusively. As
Nancy Iversen stated, "by living
together we are able to discuss
specific nursing problems and
help each other."
Students in the Stanford nurs
ing program live in the regular
undergraduate dorms for two
years, fulfilling general studies
requirements and nursing pre
requisites. The next three years
are spent on nursing courses at
the Med Center and in hospital
practice.
Student nurses usually have
classes from <S a.m. lo noon and
work in the hospital in the after
noons. With tho completion of
this program, tho women gradu
ate as registered nurses with a
B.S. degree.
Ventura Hall, tho new nurses'
residence, was originally a bach
elor professors' apartment house,
and more recently a graduate
women's residence.
When tho nursing school was
in San Francisco there was dor
mitory space for all the women
in the last three years of the
nursing program. Ventura can
accommodate only the 55 third
and fourth year students. Fifth
j year students must live off cam
pus.
