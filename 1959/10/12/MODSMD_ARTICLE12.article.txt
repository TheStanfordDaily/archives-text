## 
### Bob Frank 
An alleged deterioration of re
'at ions between the U.S. and Lat
n America, partly due to U.S.
State Department support of
,atin American dictators, was
the subject of discusison by a
listinguished pan e 1 Saturday
light in connection with the Stan
ford Conference on Latin Amer
ica.
The conference, organized and
directed by the Pacific Coast
Council on Latin American Stud
es and Stanford's Department of
Hispanic American Studies, both
headed by Professor Ronald Hil
ton, widened understanding of
delegates interested in trade, in
dustrial development, culture,
education and population growth
south of the border.
Approximately 500 delegates
from all parts of the Western
Hemisphere were joined by 156
Stanford students who were per
mitted to attend the meetings
without paying the $25 registra
tion fee through the efforts of the
ASSU Political Union.
Distinguished Members
The Saturday evening panel
discussion, open to the public,
was presided over by William H.
Cowles Jr., President of the In
ter-American Press Association.
The panel included Alberto Gain
za Paz, editor of La Prensa of
Buenos Aires; Prof. Robert J.
Alexander of Rutgers University;
Herbert Matthews, editor and
Latin American correspondent of
the New York Times; and Ray
mond G. Leddy, consul of the U.S.
Embassy in Mexico.
Professor Alexander asserted
that Latin American relations had
fallen to an all time low from the
period of the "Good Neighbor
Policy" and the aura of good feel
ing in the period following the
Second World War, and suggest
ed a "New Economic Policy" to
replace our "essentially direction
less" policy toward our southern
neighbor-s.
Individual Tailoring-
Herbert Matthews pointed out
that Alexander's plan would be
costly and that we must tailor
our policies to the individual
countries instead of launching
one blanket program. He felt
that not all responsibility for de
terioration of relations should be
placed on the U.S.
After the plenary panel discus
sion a plaque, presented by the
University of Bahia in Brazil,
honoring the major role of Stan
ford's second president, John Cas
per Branner, in the scientific and
humanistic development of Bra
zil, was unveiled and dedicated in
the department of Hispanic
American Studies.
Propagandizing
John D. J. Moore, vice-president
of W. R. Grace & Co., gave a
luncheon address in which he re
vealed that great numbers of
Latin American dancers, miners,
political leaders, etc., are being
invited to visit Red China and
Moscow, and returning to their
countries properly propagan
dized.
The analyses of important
problems of Latin America pre
sented in sessions of the Confer
ence will be published in book
form as a report on "A Decade
of Latin America."
