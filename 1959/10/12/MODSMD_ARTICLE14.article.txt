# TALKING ABOUT
## Campus Roads 
### Doug Willis 
The Stanford "farm" is going
big city. And this summer the
final ingredients for a lull-fledged
city were added: about a mile of
"super - highway" and one â€¢ way
streets.
The divided section of Cam
pus Drive constructed this sum
mer between Palm Drive ami
Serra Street is a section of a
master plan designed to keep
main circular traffic as far as
possible from the academic and
dormitory areas, according to
Matthew Sanders, acting direc
tor of the Stanford Planning
Office.
Since a road is needed to the
Medical School anyway, ex
plained Sanders, it was more eco
nomical to build Campus Drive
as a completed section of the
planned peripheral road.
The peripheral road, of which
Campus Drive will be a major
part, will circle the academic
campus and be supplemented by
service roads to dormitory and
parking areas.
"We hope someday to keep
all through traffic out of the
academic areas," said Sanders.
The Planning Office explained
lhat the new road is also intended
to divert visitors and workers in
the Science Quad area away from
the already crowded Physics Cor
ner intersection.
According to Stanford Police
Chief Gordon Davis, "It's a little
early to tell about the new Cam
pus Drive section, but there is no
reason why it shouldn't work
out.
"There has been some confu
sion, as there always is when
one-way streets and new streets
are first put into operation, but
everything seems to be work
ing smoothly now."
Most student objections to the
new roads and the one-way-street
plan initiated with the roads have
been about the expense and "use
lessness" of the new Campus
Drive section, and to the traffic
tieups in the west exits from
campus.
"I'm going to sell my car. I
don't think there's any way to get
off my side of the campus," ex
aggerated one student.
Advantages to the new road '

were pointed out by another
student. "I'd never seen the
museum before," he said.
According to the University
business office a total of $120,000,
including $10,000 yet to be spent
on landscaping, has been allocat
ed for the extension of Campus
Drive.
The breakdown includes ap
proximately $70,000 for construc
tion costs; engineering, $11,(500;
contingencies, $14,000; and ap
proximately $12,000 for miscella
neous expenses
"The one-way streets eliminat
ed the most dangerous traffic sit
uation on campus: Palm Drive at
the oval," Davis explained, "but
there has been more traffic than
anticipated at the intersection of
Campus Drive and Palm Drive.
"It is beginning to look as if
another set of automatic sig
nals may be necessary at ( am
pus Drive and Palm Drive,"
concluded Davis.
"I think that they should have
spent the money on Palm Drive,"
said a graduate student. "The
new roads don't do us any good
if we still get tied up on Palm
Drive before we can even get to
them."
But according to the Planning
Office, many studies have been
made concerning improving Palm
Drive, but it is not wide enough
between the palm trees for an
adequate four-lane road.
Plans to eventually make
Palm Drive one way inbound
for its whole length are also
being considered. A parallel
outbound road would then have
to be built.
Campus Drive will continue
from Serra Street, where it now
ends, to Searsville Road, and then
to link with the section of Cam
pus Drive in front of Florence
Moore Hall.
However, explained the Plan
ning Office, definite plans have
not been made as yet because of
pending decisions by state and
county highway officials about
Willow Road and Foothill Road.
"Uy the time that tin* new
science quad is built, Campus
Drive will be extended and Ix>-
mita Drive will be closed to ve
hicle traffic," added Sanders.
