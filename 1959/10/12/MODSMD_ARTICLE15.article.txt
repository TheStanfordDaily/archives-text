(Editor's Note: In the early
group of letters to the editor
written this full, several have
already violated t h e basie
"ground rules" of the letters
column.
To restate these rules, all
letters must he fully signed by
the author, and should include
campus residence or telephone
number in event it is necesasry
for us to contact the author.
Letters should be no longer
than 200 words in length. Let
ters slightly over that length
may be cut to 200 words. Very
long letters will not be consid
ered at all.)
Parking Rebate
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to add my complaints to
those about the increase in price
of parking stickers from $3 to
$10 ...
There are over 2o0 families lo
cated in Stanford Village. The
village is located about 2'i miles
from the Stanford campus. The
students, who are usually sup
porting children, have faced,
within the last several years, a

small rasie in rent for living
quarters, a large raise in costs of
all items needed for living and
maintaining the families. They
have been compensated with no
raise in the University aid upon
which so many of them depend,
no more opportunity to work
part-time outside the University
for increased wages.
They seldom have the extra
time needed to bicycle the dis
tance from the village to class
rooms. The rainy season makes
such distance, via bicycle, impos
sible through most of the aca
demic year. Automobiles are
necessary, not only for scholastic
participation but for the basic
needs of food, medical care, etc.
They are maintained by most at
great sacrifice. Certainly we
should not assume the University
is concerned only with those who
can "afford" its services.
I wish to propose that the ad
ministration give special dispen
sation to Stanford Village resi
dents and return to them $7 as
soon as possible. I would appre
ciate any ideas as to how to make
this proposal work.
