# MET LAST WEEK
## CENTO: Ex-Baghdad Pact 
### J.M. ROBERTS Associated Press News Analyst 
While SEATO considers its ob
ligations to Laos in case of con
tinued Communist attack, and
NATO considers the possibilities
of a summit conference, CENTO
met last week to take up more
tactical problems.
II this doesn't mean anything
to you, it isn't surprising, since
CENTO is a new word in the
great maze of political ami mil
itary treaty organizations to
which the United States be
longs or is affiliated with in
one way or another.
Indeed, although the ministers
representing the CENTO nations
are meeting in Washington, this
is one treaty organization of
which the United States is not a
member.
CENTO stands for Central
Treaty Organization, which used
to be the Baghdad Pact before
revolutionary Premier Abdel Ka
rim Kassem took Baghdad out
of it.
Its present members are Brit
ain, Turkey, Pakistan and Iran.
The United States, through
John Foster Dulles, started it.
The United States has binding
defense treaties with all of its
members, specifically as mem
bers of the pact, and over and
above the mutual aid, SEATO
and NATO treaties it had with
all of them except Iran. The
United States is a member of
all the working committees.
But to assuage the discontent
of the Arab states, and such neu
tral countries as India, which
agitate against all such pacts, the
United States didn't actually join.

The pact, originally known as
the "Northern Tier" arrangement
by which Dulles completed par
tial encirclement of the Commu
nist sphere from Bangkok to the
Western border of India, was
partly designed as a lure by
which it was hoped the Arab
states would be led into the free
world defense camp.
Despite Iraq's adherence, this
never proved out, and more re
sentment than good will was
created.
When Iraq pulled out, it was
necessary to do something to
hold the organization together.
The United States signed binding
defense treaties with the three
Eastern members.
This brought the wrath of the

Soviet Union down on Iran, and
that country has been subjected
to bitter Soviet propaganda ever
since. More than one Communist
inspired intrigue designed to un
seat the Shah has been reported.
