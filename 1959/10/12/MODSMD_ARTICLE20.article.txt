FOOTBALL: ITS CAUSE AND CURE
Next Saturday at the football ffnmr while you are sitting in your
choice student's seat behind the end zone, won't you give a
thought to Alaric Sigafoos?
Alaric Sigafoos (18()8rlO.'M) started life humbly on a farm
near Thud, Kansas. I lis mother and father, both named Ralph,
were bean-gleaners, and Alaric became a bean-gleaner too. Later
be moved to Oregon and found work with a logging firm as a
stump-thumper. Then he went to North Dakota where he
tended the furnace in a granary (wheat-heater). Then he drifted
to Texas where he tidied up oil fields (pipe-wiper). Then to
Arizona where he strung dried fruit (fig-rigger). Then t<> Ken
tucky where he fed horses at a breeding farm (oat-toter). Then
to Long Island where he dressed poultry (duek-plucker). Then
to Alaska where he drove a delivery van for a bakery (bread
sledder). Then to Minnesota where he cut up frozen lakes (iee
slicer). Then to Nevada where he computed odds in a gambling
house (dice-pricer). Then to Milwaukee where he pasted camera
lenses together (Zeiss-splicer).
Finally he went to Omaha where he got a job in a tannery
beating pig hides until they were soft and supple (hog-flogger.)
Here he found happiness at last.

Why, you jisk, did ho find happiness at last? Light n firm and
fragrant Marlboro, taste those hotter makin's, enjoy t hat filter
that filters like no other filter filters, possess your souls in sweet
content, cross your little fat legs, and read on.
Next door to Alaric's hog-floggory was an almond grove owned
hv a girl named Chimera Emrick. Chimera was pink and white
and marvelously hinged, and Alaric was instantly in love. Each
day he came to the almond grove to woo Chimera, hut she, alas,
stayed cool.
Then one day Alaric got a brilliant idea. It was the day be
fore the annual Omaha Almond Festival. On this day, as every
one knows, all the almond growers in <)maha enter floats in the
big parade. These floats always consist of large cardboard al
monds hanging from large cardboard almond trees.
Alaric's inspiration was to stitch pieces of pigskin together
and inflate them until they looked like big, plump almonds.
"These sure beat skinny old cardboard almonds, ' said Alaric
to himself. "Tomorrow they will surely take first prize lor
Chimera and she will be mine!''
Early the next morning Alaric carried his lovely inflated pig
skin almonds over to Chimera, but she, alas, had run off during
the night with Walter T. Severidge, her broker. Alaric Hew into
such a rage that he started kicking his pigskin almonds all over
the place. And who should be walking by that very instant but
Abner I )oubleday!
Mr. Doubledav had invented baseball the day before, and he
was now trying to invent football, but he was stymied because
lie couldn't figure out what kind of ball to use. Now, seeing
Alaric kick the pigskin spheroids, his problem was suddenly
solved. "Eureka!" he cried and ran to his drawing board and
invented football, which was such a big success that he was in
spired to go on and invent lacrosse, Monopoly, run sheep run,
and nylon. ® m.™ m»« Mniiim.n
