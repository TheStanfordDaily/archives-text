# Huskies Top Tribe 10-0 As Norman's Passes Fail
## 
### Russ Allen 
While Stanford students swel
tered in 80 degree weather down
on the Farm Saturday, up north
in Seattle, Card gridders were
finding the cold rain and fast
Washington Huskies too tough
to handle. The Indian passing at
tack literally bogged down as the
speedy Huskies shut out tlv
Tribe, 10-0.
Quarterback Dick Norman hau
an off day Saturday, completing
only four out of 21 passes and
had four intercepted. However,
these statistics don't tell the true
story of the game as many of
Norman's passes slipped out of
the hands of Card receivers with
three of Washington's four inter
ceptions resulting from the wet
ball sliding out of Indian arms
into the hands of the Huskies.
Bad Breaks
Two other factors which defi
nitely hurt the Tribe were inju
ries and a couple of bad breaks
on judgment calls by officials.
Center Doug Pursell did not make
the trip last weekend, and al
though both John Thomas and
Chris Cottle did a good job filling
in at center it always hurts a
club to have a first team lineman
out.
Stanford's two top ends Chris
Burford and Ben Robinson were
out all week with minor injuries
Burford with a bad ankle sprain
and Robinson with a hip pointer
and were slowed down a little
by these injuries during the
game.
Two key calls which hurt the
Tribe involved a disputed fumble
in the closing seconds of the first
half which saw Rod Sears pass
to John Bond who went out of
bounds on the Washington 27.
The official said he fumbled be
fore the ball was blown dead and
the Huskies took over and
quenched an Indian threat for a
TD or field goal.
One Inch Line
Also there was the controver
sial screen pass play which the
official claimed that after a Sears
to Gil Dowd aerial. Dowd ran till
he was stopped on the one-yard
line, then rolled into the Husky
end zone. The official claimed
the big halfback was stopped on
the one-inch line which is cer
tainly cutting it pretty close.
Despite the bad breaks of
weather, injuries and official's
calls, Card gridders would not
take anything away from the
Husky offense and defense.
Norman said that "we had run
into their type of defense before
but it hadn't bothered us. They
did a real fine job in holding us."
There were several bright spots
in the contest. Head coach Jack
Curtice said that this was the
best defensive effort he's seen at
Stanford. The Indians made four
good goal line stands and got
some fine tackling from John
Bessey, Mac Wylie and the rest
of the team.
Quarterback Rod Sears did a
fine job when he came in and
replaced Dick Norman. Sears
passed 10 for 26 for 108 yards
and gained 16 yards on the ground
himself.
Knds Good
Coach Curtice also praised
ends Robinson and Burford for
the fine receiving. Robinson
grabbed off eight Card passes
and the over-all play of captain
Burford was excellent.
On Norman's passing, Curtice
remarked "that Dick did have a
bad day and was probably throw
ing a little too quickly but a lot
of incompleted passes were
dropped on him."
All and all the game was a
pretty even contest. Both teams
carried out 65 offensive plays

and had 17 first downs. The
Husky only had a 25-yard total
yardage on the Indians also.
Washington's victory was due
in part to a new offensive forma
tion the Double T—which they
used exclusively throughout the
game and which cost the Indians
one touchdown until they could
readjust to it. Later on in the
game the Huskies weren't doing
as well as the Indians began to
stop the Washington running at
tack.
Also the fine running of
speedy Texas backs Ray Jackson
and George Fleming and especi
ally the long gains of Don Mc-
Keta racked up quite a bit of
yardage in the first and third
quarters when the Huskies scored
their TD and field goal.
Indians Receive
Stanford won the toss and re
ceived to start the game. They
drove light down to the Wash
ington 20-yard line only to have
the Huskies intercept—the first
of the four 1 which plagued Nor
man throughout the first half.
After a lengthy Husky drive
the Indians recovered a fumble
only to have the Huskies' Flem
ing intercept a pass off Burford's
finger tips. On the second play
McKeta went over left tackle for
30 yards and a Washington score.
Fleming kicked the extra point.
After receiving the kickoff
Norman threw three passes to
Robinson for 54 yards and then
Fleming intercepted his second
pass on the Washington goal line
and another Stanford threat was
erased.
In the second quarter the ball
changed hands several times and
then Sears came in for quarter
for the Indians. A couple of runs
by Skip Face, one by Dowd and
a pass to Robinson brought the
ball to mid-field where a penalty
against the Huskies kept the of
fense going.
Sears passed another to Robin
son and one to Burford which set
up the controversial play in the
end of the quarter. Sears threw
to John Bond, down and out to
the Husky 27, a fumble and the
half ended.

In the third quarter the rain
was coining down harder and
after an exchange of fumbles the
fired up Huskies managed to
drive down inside the Card 10-
yard line. Stopped from scoring
a TD, Fleming booted an eleven
yard field goal and the Huskies
led 10-0.
Tough Defense
Although most of the team
rated Washington as having the
toughest pass defense which they
have faced so far, the gridders
all believed that they would have
had a better chance on a dry day.
Most believed that they could
have whipped the Huskies down
here.
But any way you look at it the
Huskies won their fourth game
in a row. are a definite Rose Bowl
contender and may be the second
best team on the Coast behind
S.C.

Bad Breaks
Two other factors which defi
nitely hurt the Tribe were inju
ries and a couple of bad breaks
on judgment calls by officials.
Center Doug Pursell did not make
the trip last weekend, and al
though both John Thomas and
Chris Cottle did a good job filling
in at center it always hurts a
club to have a first team lineman
out.
Stanford's two top ends Chris
Burford and Ben Robinson were
out all week with minor injuries
Burford with a bad ankle sprain
and Robinson with a hip pointer
and were slowed down a little
by these injuries during the
game.
Two key calls which hurt the
Tribe involved a disputed fumble
in the closing seconds of the first
half which saw Rod Sears pass
to John Bond who went out of
bounds on the Washington 27.
The official said he fumbled be
fore the ball was blown dead and
the Huskies took over and
quenched an Indian threat for a
TD or field goal.
One Inch Line
Also there was the controver
sial screen pass play which the
official claimed that after a Sears
to Gil Dowd aerial. Dowd ran till
he was stopped on the one-yard
line, then rolled into the Husky
end zone. The official claimed
the big halfback was stopped on
the one-inch line which is cer
tainly cutting it pretty close.
Despite the bad breaks of
weather, injuries and official's
calls, Card gridders would not
take anything away from the
Husky offense and defense.
Norman said that "we had run
into their type of defense before
but it hadn't bothered us. They
did a real fine job in holding us."
There were several bright spots
in the contest. Head coach Jack
Curtice said that this was the
best defensive effort he's seen at
Stanford. The Indians made four
good goal line stands and got
some fine tackling from John
Bessey, Mac Wylie and the rest
of the team.
Quarterback Rod Sears did a
fine job when he came in and
replaced Dick Norman. Sears
passed 10 for 26 for 108 yards
and gained 16 yards on the ground
himself.
Knds Good
Coach Curtice also praised
ends Robinson and Burford for
the fine receiving. Robinson
grabbed off eight Card passes
and the over-all play of captain
Burford was excellent.
On Norman's passing, Curtice
remarked "that Dick did have a
bad day and was probably throw
ing a little too quickly but a lot
of incompleted passes were
dropped on him."
All and all the game was a
pretty even contest. Both teams
carried out 65 offensive plays

and had 17 first downs. The
Husky only had a 25-yard total
yardage on the Indians also.
Washington's victory was due
in part to a new offensive forma
tion the Double T—which they
used exclusively throughout the
game and which cost the Indians
one touchdown until they could
readjust to it. Later on in the
game the Huskies weren't doing
as well as the Indians began to
stop the Washington running at
tack.
Also the fine running of
speedy Texas backs Ray Jackson
and George Fleming and especi
ally the long gains of Don Mc-
Keta racked up quite a bit of
yardage in the first and third
quarters when the Huskies scored
their TD and field goal.
Indians Receive
Stanford won the toss and re
ceived to start the game. They
drove light down to the Wash
ington 20-yard line only to have
the Huskies intercept—the first
of the four 1 which plagued Nor
man throughout the first half.
After a lengthy Husky drive
the Indians recovered a fumble
only to have the Huskies' Flem
ing intercept a pass off Burford's
finger tips. On the second play
McKeta went over left tackle for
30 yards and a Washington score.
Fleming kicked the extra point.
After receiving the kickoff
Norman threw three passes to
Robinson for 54 yards and then
Fleming intercepted his second
pass on the Washington goal line
and another Stanford threat was
erased.
In the second quarter the ball
changed hands several times and
then Sears came in for quarter
for the Indians. A couple of runs
by Skip Face, one by Dowd and
a pass to Robinson brought the
ball to mid-field where a penalty
against the Huskies kept the of
fense going.
Sears passed another to Robin
son and one to Burford which set
up the controversial play in the
end of the quarter. Sears threw
to John Bond, down and out to
the Husky 27, a fumble and the
half ended.

In the third quarter the rain
was coining down harder and
after an exchange of fumbles the
fired up Huskies managed to
drive down inside the Card 10-
yard line. Stopped from scoring
a TD, Fleming booted an eleven
yard field goal and the Huskies
led 10-0.
Tough Defense
Although most of the team
rated Washington as having the
toughest pass defense which they
have faced so far, the gridders
all believed that they would have
had a better chance on a dry day.
Most believed that they could
have whipped the Huskies down
here.
But any way you look at it the
Huskies won their fourth game
in a row. are a definite Rose Bowl
contender and may be the second
best team on the Coast behind
S.C.

bounds on the Washington 27.
The official said he fumbled be
fore the ball was blown dead and
the Huskies took over and
quenched an Indian threat for a
TD or field goal.
One Inch Line
Also there was the controver
sial screen pass play which the
official claimed that after a Sears
to Gil Dowd aerial. Dowd ran till
he was stopped on the one-yard
line, then rolled into the Husky
end zone. The official claimed
the big halfback was stopped on
the one-inch line which is cer
tainly cutting it pretty close.
Despite the bad breaks of
weather, injuries and official's
calls, Card gridders would not
take anything away from the
Husky offense and defense.
Norman said that "we had run
into their type of defense before
but it hadn't bothered us. They
did a real fine job in holding us."
There were several bright spots
in the contest. Head coach Jack
Curtice said that this was the
best defensive effort he's seen at
Stanford. The Indians made four
good goal line stands and got
some fine tackling from John
Bessey, Mac Wylie and the rest
of the team.
Quarterback Rod Sears did a
fine job when he came in and
replaced Dick Norman. Sears
passed 10 for 26 for 108 yards
and gained 16 yards on the ground
himself.
Knds Good
Coach Curtice also praised
ends Robinson and Burford for
the fine receiving. Robinson
grabbed off eight Card passes
and the over-all play of captain
Burford was excellent.
On Norman's passing, Curtice
remarked "that Dick did have a
bad day and was probably throw
ing a little too quickly but a lot
of incompleted passes were
dropped on him."
All and all the game was a
pretty even contest. Both teams
carried out 65 offensive plays

and had 17 first downs. The
Husky only had a 25-yard total
yardage on the Indians also.
Washington's victory was due
in part to a new offensive forma
tion the Double T—which they
used exclusively throughout the
game and which cost the Indians
one touchdown until they could
readjust to it. Later on in the
game the Huskies weren't doing
as well as the Indians began to
stop the Washington running at
tack.
Also the fine running of
speedy Texas backs Ray Jackson
and George Fleming and especi
ally the long gains of Don Mc-
Keta racked up quite a bit of
yardage in the first and third
quarters when the Huskies scored
their TD and field goal.
Indians Receive
Stanford won the toss and re
ceived to start the game. They
drove light down to the Wash
ington 20-yard line only to have
the Huskies intercept—the first
of the four 1 which plagued Nor
man throughout the first half.
After a lengthy Husky drive
the Indians recovered a fumble
only to have the Huskies' Flem
ing intercept a pass off Burford's
finger tips. On the second play
McKeta went over left tackle for
30 yards and a Washington score.
Fleming kicked the extra point.
After receiving the kickoff
Norman threw three passes to
Robinson for 54 yards and then
Fleming intercepted his second
pass on the Washington goal line
and another Stanford threat was
erased.
In the second quarter the ball
changed hands several times and
then Sears came in for quarter
for the Indians. A couple of runs
by Skip Face, one by Dowd and
a pass to Robinson brought the
ball to mid-field where a penalty
against the Huskies kept the of
fense going.
Sears passed another to Robin
son and one to Burford which set
up the controversial play in the
end of the quarter. Sears threw
to John Bond, down and out to
the Husky 27, a fumble and the
half ended.

In the third quarter the rain
was coining down harder and
after an exchange of fumbles the
fired up Huskies managed to
drive down inside the Card 10-
yard line. Stopped from scoring
a TD, Fleming booted an eleven
yard field goal and the Huskies
led 10-0.
Tough Defense
Although most of the team
rated Washington as having the
toughest pass defense which they
have faced so far, the gridders
all believed that they would have
had a better chance on a dry day.
Most believed that they could
have whipped the Huskies down
here.
But any way you look at it the
Huskies won their fourth game
in a row. are a definite Rose Bowl
contender and may be the second
best team on the Coast behind
S.C.

Indian quarterback picks up a few yards
While Stanford students swel

finding the cold rain and fast
Washington Huskies too tough
to handle. The Indian passing at
tack literally bogged down as the
speedy Huskies shut out tlv
Tribe, 10-0.
Quarterback Dick Norman hau
an off day Saturday, completing
only four out of 21 passes and
had four intercepted. However,

Bad Breaks
Two other factors which defi

Center Doug Pursell did not make

and Robinson with a hip pointer
and were slowed down a little

but it hadn't bothered us. They
did a real fine job in holding us."
There were several bright spots
in the contest. Head coach Jack
Curtice said that this was the
best defensive effort he's seen at
Stanford. The Indians made four
good goal line stands and got
some fine tackling from John
Bessey, Mac Wylie and the rest
of the team.
Quarterback Rod Sears did a
fine job when he came in and
replaced Dick Norman. Sears
passed 10 for 26 for 108 yards
and gained 16 yards on the ground
himself.

Coach Curtice also praised
ends Robinson and Burford for
the fine receiving. Robinson
grabbed off eight Card passes
and the over-all play of captain
Burford was excellent.
On Norman's passing, Curtice
remarked "that Dick did have a
bad day and was probably throw
ing a little too quickly but a lot
of incompleted passes were
dropped on him."
All and all the game was a
pretty even contest. Both teams
carried out 65 offensive plays

and had 17 first downs. The
Husky only had a 25-yard total
yardage on the Indians also.
Washington's victory was due
in part to a new offensive forma
tion the Double T—which they
used exclusively throughout the
game and which cost the Indians
one touchdown until they could
readjust to it. Later on in the
game the Huskies weren't doing
as well as the Indians began to
stop the Washington running at
tack.
Also the fine running of
speedy Texas backs Ray Jackson
and George Fleming and especi
ally the long gains of Don Mc-
Keta racked up quite a bit of
yardage in the first and third
quarters when the Huskies scored
their TD and field goal.
Indians Receive
Stanford won the toss and re
ceived to start the game. They
drove light down to the Wash
ington 20-yard line only to have
the Huskies intercept—the first
of the four 1 which plagued Nor
man throughout the first half.
After a lengthy Husky drive
the Indians recovered a fumble
only to have the Huskies' Flem
ing intercept a pass off Burford's
finger tips. On the second play
McKeta went over left tackle for
30 yards and a Washington score.
Fleming kicked the extra point.
After receiving the kickoff
Norman threw three passes to
Robinson for 54 yards and then
Fleming intercepted his second
pass on the Washington goal line
and another Stanford threat was
erased.
In the second quarter the ball
changed hands several times and
then Sears came in for quarter
for the Indians. A couple of runs
by Skip Face, one by Dowd and
a pass to Robinson brought the
ball to mid-field where a penalty
against the Huskies kept the of
fense going.
Sears passed another to Robin
son and one to Burford which set
up the controversial play in the
end of the quarter. Sears threw
to John Bond, down and out to
the Husky 27, a fumble and the
half ended.

In the third quarter the rain
was coining down harder and
after an exchange of fumbles the
fired up Huskies managed to
drive down inside the Card 10-
yard line. Stopped from scoring
a TD, Fleming booted an eleven
yard field goal and the Huskies
led 10-0.
Tough Defense
Although most of the team
rated Washington as having the
toughest pass defense which they
have faced so far, the gridders
all believed that they would have
had a better chance on a dry day.
Most believed that they could
have whipped the Huskies down
here.
But any way you look at it the
Huskies won their fourth game
in a row. are a definite Rose Bowl
contender and may be the second
best team on the Coast behind
S.C.

Indian quarterback picks up a few yards
While Stanford students swel
tered in 80 degree weather down
on the Farm Saturday, up north
in Seattle, Card gridders were
finding the cold rain and fast
Washington Huskies too tough
to handle. The Indian passing at
tack literally bogged down as the
speedy Huskies shut out tlv
Tribe, 10-0.
Quarterback Dick Norman hau
an off day Saturday, completing
only four out of 21 passes and
had four intercepted. However,
these statistics don't tell the true
story of the game as many of
Norman's passes slipped out of
the hands of Card receivers with
three of Washington's four inter
ceptions resulting from the wet
ball sliding out of Indian arms
into the hands of the Huskies.
Bad Breaks
Two other factors which defi
nitely hurt the Tribe were inju
ries and a couple of bad breaks
on judgment calls by officials.
Center Doug Pursell did not make
the trip last weekend, and al
though both John Thomas and
Chris Cottle did a good job filling
in at center it always hurts a
club to have a first team lineman
out.
Stanford's two top ends Chris
Burford and Ben Robinson were
out all week with minor injuries
Burford with a bad ankle sprain
and Robinson with a hip pointer
and were slowed down a little
by these injuries during the
game.
Two key calls which hurt the
Tribe involved a disputed fumble
in the closing seconds of the first
half which saw Rod Sears pass
to John Bond who went out of
bounds on the Washington 27.
The official said he fumbled be
fore the ball was blown dead and
the Huskies took over and
quenched an Indian threat for a
TD or field goal.
One Inch Line
Also there was the controver
sial screen pass play which the
official claimed that after a Sears
to Gil Dowd aerial. Dowd ran till
he was stopped on the one-yard
line, then rolled into the Husky
end zone. The official claimed
the big halfback was stopped on
the one-inch line which is cer
tainly cutting it pretty close.
Despite the bad breaks of
weather, injuries and official's
calls, Card gridders would not
take anything away from the
Husky offense and defense.
Norman said that "we had run
