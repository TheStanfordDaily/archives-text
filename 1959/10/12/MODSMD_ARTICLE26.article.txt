Brave coach .lack McKenna
gave credit to the whole team for
the victory and commented that
the difference between the teams
was the seasoned quarterbacking
of Bob Price. McKenna also sin
gled out the outstanding line play
of Chuck Morehouse, Bob Draku
lich, Jim Moe and Bob Atkinson,
and the running of Roger Crist
and Pete Fitzgerald.
Even though the final score
was one-sided, the both sides
played well. There were only
two penalties called in the game,
both for offside. The freshman
attack worked well on the ground,
as Mickey Doherty and Ed Cum
mins were able to make short |
gains consistently again.st the j
JV's. The freshmen were not 1
able to complete any long passes,
and consequently never could
move the ball more than fifteen
yards at a crack.
Surprise
The frosh defense showed up
surprisingly well against the
stronger and more-experienced
JV team. Tom Fetherston did an
excellent job, putting a good rush
on Price and forcing him to hurry
many of his passes.

weak, however, as Price was able
to complete a number of short
passes for key first downs.
Frosh coach Homer Smith, un- j
derstandably depressed by the

lopsided score, noted that he has
just one week to get his players
working together as a team. He

Price Lauded
Brave coach .lack McKenna
gave credit to the whole team for
the victory and commented that
the difference between the teams
was the seasoned quarterbacking
of Bob Price. McKenna also sin
gled out the outstanding line play
of Chuck Morehouse, Bob Draku
lich, Jim Moe and Bob Atkinson,
and the running of Roger Crist
and Pete Fitzgerald.
Even though the final score
was one-sided, the both sides
played well. There were only
two penalties called in the game,
both for offside. The freshman
attack worked well on the ground,
as Mickey Doherty and Ed Cum
mins were able to make short |
gains consistently again.st the j
JV's. The freshmen were not 1
able to complete any long passes,
and consequently never could
move the ball more than fifteen
yards at a crack.
Surprise
The frosh defense showed up
surprisingly well against the
stronger and more-experienced
JV team. Tom Fetherston did an
excellent job, putting a good rush
on Price and forcing him to hurry
many of his passes.
Freshman pass defense was
weak, however, as Price was able
to complete a number of short
passes for key first downs.
Frosh coach Homer Smith, un- j
derstandably depressed by the

lopsided score, noted that he has
just one week to get his players
working together as a team. He

standing hack and Steve Player
as his best lineman.
