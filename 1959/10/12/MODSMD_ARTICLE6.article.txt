# Conference on Latin America Helps Mutual Understanding
## Castro's Regime: 'Honest' 
### 
New York Tirrtes correspond
ent Herbert L. Matthews called
Castro's Cuban regime "the first
completely honest regime that
Cuba has known in the more than
450 years of her history."
Matthews' dinner speech Fri
day highlighted the three-day
meeting of the Stanford Confer
ence on Latin America, a confer
ence organized to survey devel
opments in Latin America coun
try by country and topic by topic
for- the last decade and for possi
ble future problems.
Hardest to Understand
Matthews claimed that the Cas
tro revolution was one of the
hardest stories to understand
among recent news developments,
but had the worst coverage by
the press of any war he could
remember.
In spite of stories breaking
throughout the summer about
Castro's attempts to spread his
revolution to other Latin Ameri
can nations, Matthews said there
was only one Castro-ordered in
vasionâ€”the attempt at invasion
of Trujillo's Dominican Republic.
Agrarian Reform
The heart of the revolution in
Cuba, said Matthews, is agrarian
reform. While the plan is widely
believed to be economically un
sound, "good, bad or indifferent,
Cuba is going to have an agrarian
reform."
"Castro wants drastic social
and economic reform s. This
brings him close, and often paral
lel to, Communism. He does
some things, like agrarian re
form, which the Reds would do
if they had power, although they
would do it differently."
Cuban Communists
"But the paradoxical truth
about the Cuban Communists is
that they are fellow-travelers of
the 26th of July Movement. In
truth, they did not even help Fi
del Castro until they saw he was
going to win."
Americans tend lo associate
any social revolution with com
munism, but Cuba's revolution is
completely Castro's.
No Elections
There is no question that Cas
tro would win at least 80 per cent
of the vote if elections were held
today in Cuba.
"Castro is an emotional, inex
perienced, confused, amateurish,
passionate, willful, arrogant
young man . . . yet, it is equally
true that he is a decent, honest,
brave, sincere, idealistic young
man who thinks he is being dem
ocratic and wants to be, who pas
sionately desires to do what is
best for his people and his coun
try."
