# Stanford Beats Loyola In G.E. College Bowl
## 
### 
Stanford defeated Loyola Uni
versity of Los Angeles yesterday
in the second G.E< College Bowl
to be held on the Stanford cam
pus.
Stanford team members Del
Simenson, George Green, Dan
White and Roger Dingman won
with a score of 120 to 115. Sun
day they will defend their title
in Hollywood against University
of Colorado.
The teams were required to
identify the unpleasant wives of
famous personalities from Socra
tes lo Jiggs. Members of both
teams tripped in trying to spell
"arteriosclerosis." Stanford strug
gled rather unsuccessfully to
identify ballet music from sev
eral famous operas. However,
both teams did well on current
events and historical questions.
The final whistle blew while
Allen Ludden, the moderator, was
reading a question. After a con

troversy, the judges ruled that
Loyola panel member Dave Ro
berti had signaled to answer the
question before the whistle, not
after. Therefore he was entitled
to attempt to answer the ques
tion.
If he had answered the ques
tion correctly Loyola would have
won the game. However, Roberti
answered it incorrectly.
The program was shown at
5:30 p.m. yesterday on the West
Coast and broadcast directly on
the East Coast.
