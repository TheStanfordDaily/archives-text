# World Peace Key Described
## 
### Patricia Falk 
A devotee of Ghandi last night
told a group of Stanford students
that the only key to world peace
is personal harmony related to
political action.
Ira Sandperl, a Menlo Park
teacher and disciple of the Indian
religious leader, addressed the So
cialist Caucus of The Political
Union on the subjects of internal
and external peace inspired by
love and self-knowledge.
Holding that war is the mag
nification of everyday competi
tiveness, he feels if individuals
work toward peace as they have
toward war that peace will result
as surely as wars have.
Sandperl believes that other
civilizations have collapsed, but
ours is fated to explode unless
we, collectively, find ourselves.
He feels that a revolution in at
titudes must occur, and that sel
fish national interests must be
subordinated to the general good.
Sandperl advised students to
help themselves find interior
peace by thinking in silence for
only a few moments a day. "Ev
ery morning when you awaken,"
he said, "be quiet, listen, and
think of things relating you to
the world. Do not be harsh in
judging yourselves when you
make mistakes,"
The Socialist Caucus was form
er! this year as part of the Po
litical Union, after trying to form
as a discussion group last year,
but meeting opposition from the
Legislature, spokesman George
Guy said.
The Caucus expects to have
meetings every Monday at
7:30 p.m., Guy said. The Social
ist character of the group is per
haps best exemplified by its or
ganization. Guy, although speak
ing for the group, said, "we have

no real chairman. We find that
wo all work together rather well."
The Monday open meetings will
try to adhere to topics on politi
cal or economic subjects "in an
area between Capitalism and
Communism." Guy explained:
"Other than attending meetings,
the only membership requirement

is that the student's mind be open
to arguments other than those
he may have heard all his life. 1-Ie
must have a keen interest in
searching."
