UNITED NATIONS, N'.Y. (A 3 )
The United Nations General As
sembly was deadlocked yesterday
on the question of admitting
either Turkey or Poland to the
Security Council.
Also at stake is the prestige of
the U.S., principal supporter of
Turkey.
Poland maintained an edge, but
failed to win the required two
thirds majority in a series of se
cret ballots held in the 82-mem
ber General Assembly.
On the opening vote of the As
sembly yesterday, Poland re
ceived '16 votes, only eight short
of the required number. At that
time, Turkey had 34 votes.
At one point during the morn
ing, Poland was within six votes
of victory. Israel was absent be
cause of Yom Kippur holiday,
and one other delegation ab
stained.
The Assembly elected Ecuador
and Ceylon for two-year terms
on the 11 -nation council, then
went into the deadlock over Tur
key and Poland.
Most UN diplomats took the
point of view that a Turkish de
feat would he a blow to the pres
tige of the U.S., which has cam
nuiinicd vii'oroush for Turkey.
