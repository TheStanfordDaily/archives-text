# SUPREME COURT
## Review Set On Unions' Political Aid 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) —'The Su
preme Court Monday granted an
irganized labor plea for review
of a lower court ruling which
could profoundly affect union
membership and political activ
ity.
The court agreed unanimously
to review a decision of the Geor
gia Supreme Court that compul
sory union membership is uncon
stitutional if the union uses for
political activity any of the dues
collected.
It also followed a hands-off line
on details of school integration
cases.
Union Case
The union case was brought in
Macon, Ga., by six employes of
the Southern Railway System
who were required to join unions
under a union shop agreement
which calls for such membership
after 60 days of employment.
The court's refusal to review
lower court rulings in school
cases had these effects:
In Prince Edward County, Va.,
there remains unchanged a cir
cuit court order for immediate
integration which has resulted in
county officials closing all public
schools.
Norfolk Schools
The Norfolk, Va., City Council
continues under court injunction
not to cut off public school funds.
Negroes in Raleigh and Mont
gomery counties, N.C., are pre
vented from speeding up the de
segregation which is proceeding
piecemeal under a state pupil as
signment law.
In the Prince Edward case, Vir
ginia unsuccessfully sought rein
statement of a U.S. district court
order giving the county until 1965
to begin integration. The U.S.
circuit court at Richmond re
versed it and ordered desegrega
tion to begin in September 1959.
Rather than accept this deci
sion, the county closed all its
three high schools and 18 elemen
tary schools. Most of its 1,500-
plus white school-age children are
now in privately operated schools
but there has been no general
provision for the more than 1,700
Negro children.

order giving the county until 1965
to begin integration. The U.S.
circuit court at Richmond re
versed it and ordered desegrega
tion to begin in September 1959.
Rather than accept this deci
sion, the county closed all its
three high schools and 18 elemen
tary schools. Most of its 1,500-
plus white school-age children are
now in privately operated schools
but there has been no general
provision for the more than 1,700
Negro children.
WASHINGTON (/P) —'The Su
preme Court Monday granted an
irganized labor plea for review
of a lower court ruling which
could profoundly affect union
membership and political activ
ity.
The court agreed unanimously
to review a decision of the Geor
gia Supreme Court that compul
sory union membership is uncon
stitutional if the union uses for
political activity any of the dues
collected.
It also followed a hands-off line
on details of school integration
cases.
Union Case
The union case was brought in
Macon, Ga., by six employes of
the Southern Railway System
who were required to join unions
under a union shop agreement
which calls for such membership
after 60 days of employment.
The court's refusal to review
lower court rulings in school
cases had these effects:
In Prince Edward County, Va.,
there remains unchanged a cir
cuit court order for immediate
integration which has resulted in
county officials closing all public
schools.
Norfolk Schools
The Norfolk, Va., City Council
continues under court injunction
not to cut off public school funds.
Negroes in Raleigh and Mont
gomery counties, N.C., are pre
vented from speeding up the de
segregation which is proceeding
piecemeal under a state pupil as
signment law.
In the Prince Edward case, Vir
ginia unsuccessfully sought rein
statement of a U.S. district court
order giving the county until 1965
to begin integration. The U.S.
circuit court at Richmond re
versed it and ordered desegrega
tion to begin in September 1959.
Rather than accept this deci
sion, the county closed all its
three high schools and 18 elemen
tary schools. Most of its 1,500-
plus white school-age children are
now in privately operated schools
but there has been no general
provision for the more than 1,700
Negro children.
