# Med School's Curriculum Attracts Critics Already; Family Doctor Excluded
## Dean Alway Refutes Attack By Organized Practitioners 
### Steve Baffrey, Associate Editor (And from Associated Press Dispatches) 
Stanford's new medical school was under fire yesterday from the
California Academy of General Practice for the "exclusion of the
family doctor from its curriculum."
And, in a more general statement, the Academy accused the na
tion's medical schools of turning out "gold-plated and super-atomic
specialists."
Here on campus Dr. Robert H. Alway, dean of the Stanford school,
countered the remarks by stating that the "reorganization did not
exclude the family doctor; in fact it excludes nothing that is of
value for the proper education of doctors."

Doctor Alway noted that the
curriculum was developed after
a long study by the curriculum
committee which considered the
inclusion of general practitioners
"inappropriate."
School's Goal
"A medical school's goal should
not be to turn out general prac
titioners," he said. "Instead we
expect to produce well-trained
basic medical men able to go on
to further breakdowns."
The Academy urged the uni
versity to "recognize general
practice in the curriculum and
use general practice instructors
in the teaching staff wherever
possible."
To this, Alway countered, "The
new curriculum has been planned
to emphasize the unity of medi
cine and to overcome its splinter
ing into separate highly detailed
specialties."
Goneralist
"It could very well result," he
continued, "in a new breed of
generalist who could take over
for today's general practitioner,
pediatrician and internist."
There is a difference in the
family doctor and the general
practitioner, according to Alway.
"The general practitioner often
addresses himself to cases he
shouldn't, simply because of the
inclusive nature of his practice,"
the Dean said.
"The family doctor," he went
on, "is the man you and I appre
ciate and who takes care of our
families, inferring complex cases
to specialists."
Not Gold-plated
Defending against the "gold
plated and super-atomic special
ists" charge, Alway pointed to
the Stanford emphasis on the be
havioral sciences in order to im
prove doctor-patient relation
ships. "This does not seem to be
either gold-plated or super-atomic
to me."
"Our curriculum is probably
going to be a target for state
ments like these for some time
to come," the Dean commented,
"but we feel it is quite forward
looking and will prove itself."

California Academy of General Practice for the "exclusion of the
family doctor from its curriculum."
And, in a more general statement, the Academy accused the na
tion's medical schools of turning out "gold-plated and super-atomic
specialists."
Here on campus Dr. Robert H. Alway, dean of the Stanford school,
countered the remarks by stating that the "reorganization did not
exclude the family doctor; in fact it excludes nothing that is of
value for the proper education of doctors."

Doctor Alway noted that the
curriculum was developed after
a long study by the curriculum
committee which considered the
inclusion of general practitioners
"inappropriate."
School's Goal
"A medical school's goal should
not be to turn out general prac
titioners," he said. "Instead we
expect to produce well-trained
basic medical men able to go on
to further breakdowns."
The Academy urged the uni
versity to "recognize general
practice in the curriculum and
use general practice instructors
in the teaching staff wherever
possible."
To this, Alway countered, "The
new curriculum has been planned
to emphasize the unity of medi
cine and to overcome its splinter
ing into separate highly detailed
specialties."
Goneralist
"It could very well result," he
continued, "in a new breed of
generalist who could take over
for today's general practitioner,
pediatrician and internist."
There is a difference in the
family doctor and the general
practitioner, according to Alway.
"The general practitioner often
addresses himself to cases he
shouldn't, simply because of the
inclusive nature of his practice,"
the Dean said.
"The family doctor," he went
on, "is the man you and I appre
ciate and who takes care of our
families, inferring complex cases
to specialists."
Not Gold-plated
Defending against the "gold
plated and super-atomic special
ists" charge, Alway pointed to
the Stanford emphasis on the be
havioral sciences in order to im
prove doctor-patient relation
ships. "This does not seem to be
either gold-plated or super-atomic
to me."
"Our curriculum is probably
going to be a target for state
ments like these for some time
to come," the Dean commented,
"but we feel it is quite forward
looking and will prove itself."
