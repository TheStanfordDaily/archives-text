# No Place to Study?

"There's no place on rumpus to study."
\\ e have heard lliis complaint from every pari of campus, ever
since we came to Stanford as freshmen. And we are sure that
students have been repeating it for many years before we came
here.
\\ e have often wondered, with all the rooms available 011 Quad
and around the campus at night, why the University hasn I made
some provision to use them to provide for the people who need
and want a place to study.
The answer is very simple: the University has. Only il hasn't
bothered to advertise it.
Any campus group which can show adequate need for a study
room on Quad and can find someone to be responsible lor Hie care
and supervision of the room can apply to the office of the Dean
of Men. When approved, the group is assigned a room by the
Registrar's Office.
Presently 20 groups have study rooms on Quad. Sixteen of
the rooms are used by fraternities, and the other four are used
by the Stanford Village freshmen, an Honors Program group,
Lathrop House and the Stanford football team.
Room 300 in Engineering Corner is a general study room open
every evening for the entire campus.
Most of the study rooms now in use are open seven nights per
week between 7 and midnight.
It's probable that there aren't enough study rooms on campus,
just as we have all said, but we can't really complain too loudly
as long as the Dean's Office and Registrar's Office continue to pro
vide places for all responsible and needy applicants who bother
to a.«k.
