# The 						Trouble with Tuesday

... is that it is the morning
alter . . . house meetings.
There was a friendly old fellow
in the town in which I worked
this summer who dropped into
the newspaper office almost ev
ery day to tip his hat to us news
hens and to enlighten us with
some story tip or bit of general
information.
He was amazing. He was al
ways wide awake when I groped
my way into the office to keep
my 7:30 a.m. date with my type
writer.
One day he came up with the
question: Why do they call it
Thousand Island Dressing when
it is obviously named after the
Thousand Islands?
You tell me.
On another occasion, he came
in with a horrified expression—
as horrified as he could look with
his ever twinkling eyes. His com
ment that morning was some
thing which should make stu
dents of literature, and music for
that matter, sit up and take no
tice.
Did you know, said lie, that
Edgar Allen Poe had been set
to music?
He added that he thought it
was rock and roll.
Sure enough. I admit I had to
go to the library to get a copy of
Poe's poetry to compare with the
record; I have read some Poe, but
am far from well versed in his
works.
With book in hand I tried to
find the record in question. It
was difficult because I didn't
know the title. Besides, the rec
ord stores were charging 10 cents
(for some worthy cause) for ev
ery record listened to but not
purchased.
But one morning, when I had
about decided my friend was kid
ding me, I heard it. Bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells, bells and more
bells.
I forgot my cooling coffee and

readied for my borrowed book of
Poe. Sure enough, it was the one
I'd been looking for.
The poem which the music
"masters" have so ravaged is
"The Bells." Set to music it is
called "Ringin' and a-Swingin' "
—or something like that.
The recording lifts the first
three parts of the poem directly,
hardly a comma out of place. It
lends itself rather well to that
type of music—repetitious sylla
bles, repetitious sounds.
I don't know whether to con
gratulate those who did this or
to condemn them.
You can look at it this way.
Most teenagers these days prob
ably haven't even heard of Poe.
Consider the "Battle of New Or
leans." American teenagers didn't
know enough to find anything
wrong with it, but the Canadians
found so many errors they had
to rewrite it- at least while the
Queen was in Canada.
Anyway Poe set to music is
one way to get a little culture
into the coke crowd.
lint what a way!
Even after the above rationali
zation, I fear I'm not convinced.
I'm disappointed in those who
call themselves songwriters that
they should be so barren of crea
tivity—even in comparison to the
usual rock and roll — that they
should have to do this to Poe.
Maybe a Friends of Poe Club
can be organized.
In the meantime, we can wait
for them to get to "The Raven."
Just think what a tremendous
beat coidd be put into "Never
more."

Someone last week was still on
Daylight Saving Time. He wan
dered into a class, sat down and
not seeing anyone he knew,
asked: Is it 12 o'clock—Math 41?
i It was 11 o'clock—advertising.
