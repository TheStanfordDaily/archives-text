# Hostel Will Cover Duties of Science
## 
### 
'The Moral and Political Re
sponsibilities of Science" will be
the discussion topic in the first
Faculty Hostel for Fall Quarter.
The Hostel will be held at Napa

Oct. 23 and 24.
Discussions will be led by Drs.
John Arnold and Robert North.
Hostel signups will be limited to
12 students, according to Hostels
Board Chairman John Nickerson;
signups will begin Monday, Oct.
19, in the ASSU office.
The Hostel group will leave
Friday afternoon and return Sat
urday afternoon, although Nick
erson said that the group often
decides to stay for more discus
sions. A $3.25 charge covers three
meals and the night's lodging.
The Hostel program, which
started about five years ago, in
cludes both the Faculty Hostels,
open to all interested students,
and the Organization Hostels, de
signed to "unify groups and help
them to have a quiet chance to
clarify their goals," Nickerson
said.
The Hostels take place in a
large, private home near Napa,
which is rented by the Board; the
building can accommodate about
12 students with sleeping bags at
the present time. It is located in
the Redwood country, and on a
clear day may have a view as far
as the Golden Gate Bridge.
The purpose of the Faculty
Hostels is to "provide an enlarge
ment of the educational opportu
nities provided by the Univer
sity" in allowing students to meet
for quiet weekends of discussion
on contemporary topics "away
from the rush of campus life,"
Nickerson explained. Faculty
members chosen for their inter
est in the topics selected accom
pany all hostels.
Seven Faculty Hostels have
been tentatively scheduled for
this year, with Organization Hos
tels to be scheduled in between.
The YWCA has planned a Hostel
for this weekend, and the lIR is
now planning one, Nickerson said.
