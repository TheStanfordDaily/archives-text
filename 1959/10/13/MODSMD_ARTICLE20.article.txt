# Indonesia Steps on Helpful U.S. Toes By Backing Reds on Formosa Question
## 
### J.M. ROBERTS Associated Press News Analyst 
Just when the United States
has begun to accept Indonesian
neutralism, and to extend mili
tary and economic aid to a gov
ernment which seriously needs it.
the Indonesian foreign minister
has taken a highly unneutral po
sition with regard to Formosa.
Considered against the back
ground of recent events and
what seem to be the verities of
Indonesian politics, one cannot
help but wonder whether Ori
ental courtesy, may not have
involved Foreign Minister Sn
handrio in something from
which he may later need to ex
tricate himself.
In a communique broadcast by
Peiping after Subandrio's visit
there, he announces support of
Red China's claims to Formosa,
against which the United States
has taken an unequivocal stand.
In return, he receives Peiping's
promise to support Indonesian
claims to Dutch-held Western
New Guinea.
This comes at a lime when In
donesian nationalism has been
working against all foreign busi
ness interests, especially affect
ing Chinese of both Communist
and Nationalist persuasions.
It comes at a time when,
after several years of watchful
waiting the United States, hav
ing gone thankless after sup
porting Indonesian independ
ence during the years of con
flict with the Dutch, had reop
ened her heart and her coffers
to the new republic.
It comes at a time when the In

donesian government is very
largely controlled by anti-Com
munist Gen. Wsution, who has
turned to the United States for
military aid in his efforts to end
the numerous local rebellions
which still plague him.
It comes on the eve of Suban
drio visits to Japan, which always
has opposed any Chinese expan
sionism, and to the Philippines,
to which Red Chinese on Formosa
would represent the same sort of

| threat as the Japanese did in
| World War 11.
If Subandrio's expression in
Peiping; should prove to be an
actual part of Indonesian pol
icy, it would represent a very
direct and dangerous conflict
with U.S. policy, which is to de
fend Formosa by force if neces
sary.
II would represent a policy
which, for Indonesia, is unneces
sary and unprofitable.
