To expose himself to a press |
conference at this moment, as
Secretary Herter did on Tuesday, !
was the rough equivalent of walk
ing into the lion's den.
Mr. K. has come and gone.
Mr. Iv. lias been to Peking. The
great issues of life and death
have been talked about, and the
main agreement reached has
been that there shall be more
talk and more negotiation, talk
without time limits and with
out precision, without threats
but without promises. This
basic agreement requires the
use in public of vague formu
lae, in which nobody has to dot
his i's and cross his t's.
Diplomacy of this kind was in
vented before the modern press
conference, and it takes very
adroil evasive action to protect
such diplomacy in a modern press
conference. Mr. Herter, having
gone down among the lions, has
returned with no bad injury and
with only one, so it seems to me.
scratch.
He allowed himself to be drawn
into a line of questions about Mr.
K.'s visit to Peking, about the re
lations of Russia and China, and
about our views of where Russia
stands in relation to China.
These are among the most
interesting questions in the
world for table la Ik and for
irresponsible newspaper writ
ing and for private official con
sideration.
But the one man who cannot
speculate about them in public is
the Secretary of State. For there
is nothing he can say which floes
not do more harm than good.
As we have no relations with
Peking and no influence in Pe
king, it is not seemly for us to
issue official public commenta
ries about Soviet relations with
Peking. These commentaries can
not possibly soften the Chinese
position.
They cannot fail to embar
rass the Russians. Surely the
right official policy is silence,
and the utmost reserve and dis
cretion.
Apart from this Chinese
scratch, Mr. Herter did extremely
well, most particularly with the
question of Berlin. The crucial
problem of Berlin, which was not
solved at Geneva, is how 1o find
a basis of negotiation which in
sures the security of the commu
nity of West Berlin.
Except, it would seem, for Mr.
Acheson, there is a general recog
nition that the situation is abnor
mal. It is abnormal for half of a

city to have a different social or
der from the other half, and it is
abnormal for a city to be situated
110 miles inside the territory of
a state with which it does not
have official diplomatic relations.
This abnormal situation has
to be maintained in substance
until the two Berlins are re
united and become the capital
of a reunited (Germany. Hut to
maintain this abnormality for
a long period of time, perhaps
for a generation, we cannot
stand pat upon the old texts ol'
the occupation period.
These texts did not foresee
anything like the present situa
tion enduring for a whole gener
ation.
We must move forward to the
formation of a new international
statute which defines the rights
of West Berlin and of the two
Germanys and of the four occu
pying powers.
The negotiation of such an
international statute is the goal.
It is still on the distant horizon.
Kut it is visible. It is the goal
to which we must hope that
our talks with Mr. K. will lead.
We do not know that they will
lead there, itnt they might.
And it would Im* a mistake not
to try.
In this negotiation the Weslern
powers must be free to be firm
on the substance on the security
of West Berlin as a community -
but flexible on the formulae of
the guarantee and the arrange
ments.
A new international statute
will, for example, have to be rati
fied by the East German state.
This is unavoidable. But officially
at least it is anathema in Bonn.
With the crucial German
election of 1961 ahead of him, it
will not be easy for Dr. Aden
auer to be flexible at all. But
it will not be impossible for him
1o follow along if it is manifest
there is firm and friendly lead
ership in Washington which
knows the score in Germany
and in Central Europe.
A good friend, as we are to the
Germans, does not always say:
IMe too. There may be a time
! when the duty of a good friend
is to nudge his ally and help him
j to recogni/.e the facts of life.
