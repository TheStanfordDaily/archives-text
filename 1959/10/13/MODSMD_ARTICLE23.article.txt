Back in llie Sun
Stanford gridders are bark in their classes Ibis week, and no
doubt are very glad to return to Sunny California after spending a
weekend in dismal Seattle and suffering their third defeat of the
year. At least this weekend the passing attack of Norman, Sears,
Hurford, Bowers and Robinson will get a fair test under clear skies
against Washington Stale's Cougars.
Before we close the book on Washington let's have a few parting
comments. LSU, that fine educational institution in the south which
seems to draw pretty good football teams, has a unit called the
Chinese Bandits who are the hustling and aggressive top defensive

men on the team.
The Huskies also feature a de
fensive unit that can be called the
Chinese Laundry. If the hard
charging linemen Chuck Allen,
Bill Kinnune and Kurt Gegner
can't stop their opponents —as
was the ease in last week's game
for the Card line of Gary Pike,
Gary Leahy, Tom Walsh and Phil
Burkland put a solid wall up
ahead of quarterbacks Dick Nor
man and Rod Sears the Huskies
then call on their Rain God up
there and wash their opponents
out.
Another scandal has seeped out
of Seattle. You may remember
ihe first big blow-up over their in
famous "Slush Fund." A fund
which provided an education, two
cars and a good salary for wor
thy gridders. It might be noted
that flurrying Hugh McKlhenny
was said to have taken a pay cut
in signing with the 49ers. This
proved to bring on the Big Fuss
that eventually broke up the PCC.

Well, it seems that Hie Washington mascot—a beautiful big white
Husky—died last year and a replacement was needed. After a search
ihe right dog was found and all was O.K. However, after an exten
sive investigation, it was found that the Husky wasn't a Husky after 1
all but a mongrel part Husky, German Shepherd and Cliiluialum!
Well, there were a few red faces in Seattle but it seems this time the
university managed to gloss over its mistake and the mascot re
mained.
After viewing last weekend's game this writer believes that we
«till have a good chance of finishing above .500. The Tribe's four
guards now actually five with Ron Fernandew back in action
Walsh, Leahy, Don IVter and Larry Lacey have come on real
strong and have more than held their own against bigger opponents.
Well Stocked in Ends
Stanford seems to be pretty well stocked with good ends this year.
Chris Burl'ord and Ben Robinson both are All-American caliber and
should at least make All-Coast. Irv Nikolai has looked good on of
fense and George Honore has mflde some good tackles from the de
fensive end position.
The tackling has improved but still poses some problems for
Coach .lack Curtice. With his top ends Burl'ord and Robinson hurt,
Curtice would like to use Honore and Nikolai or Bill Donahue a lot
on defense. He would also like to play John Bessey at one wing
spot on defense. But all three substitutions would cost him time-outs
unless he can insert them during a time-out called by officials, an
incomplete pass or a penalty.
However, Curtice is again—as is the case nearly every year at
Stanford—suffering from lack of depth. It looks like the only way
that he can get those real big tackles and real fast backs i-s to talk
the Director of Admissions into cutting the College Board Score re
quirement to about half of what it is. Until then, the popular mentor
will be coaching above-average ball players, who play their hearts out
against opponents that top them in size and speed nearly every
weekend.
