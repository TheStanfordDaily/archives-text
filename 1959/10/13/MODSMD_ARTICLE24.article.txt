### 
Over 150 Stanford water polo I
fans were treated to a comedy of i
errors presented in a serious vein
Friday afternoon as Cal's Bears ;
outclassed and outscored the In
dians 23-5.
The only ray of sunshine for |
Stanford rooters came in the I
fourth quarter when the Indians
managed to hold iheir rugged op
ponents to two points, meanwhile j
scoring four themselves.
Cal started with a quick score
off the toss-up to betfin the meet.
But the Indians quickly coun
tered as Andy Sehwarz put a deft
back - hand between the nets.
From that point on it was all
Cal's show as they scored four
more times in rapid succession,
and wound up the quarter lead
ing 7-1.
The only Stanford fan who left
the stadium smiling was Coach
Tom Haynie who commented,
"What do you expect after only
six practices? The boys looked:
all right, considering. You could
actually watch them improve as
the game progressed."
The Indians now have a full
week to practice before they
meet San Jose, a team touted to

be one of the best among the
small schools this year. The meet,
to be held at Stanford, will begin
at 10 Saturday morning.
