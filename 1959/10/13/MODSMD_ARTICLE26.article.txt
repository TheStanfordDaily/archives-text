## Sad Defense Big Worry To Cougars 
### 
Stanford will be up against a
team with unexpected defensive
woes Saturday. This was the
mournful report of Washington
Stale University publicist-Dick
Fry at the weekly press luncheon
yesterday in San Francisco.
WSU will be making its third
appearance in the Bay Area in
four weeks. The Cougars have
won their other two local outings
- 30-6 over San Jose State and
20-12 last week over College of
the Pacific.
Last week at COP, the Cougars
ran into an unheralded passer
named Bob Gatiss who rolled up
a fantastic 328 yards on just 15
completions and exposed a real
weakness in the WSU defense.
"This was kind of a shock to
us," said Fry, "but maybe it's
just as well since we meet Stan
ford this week. At least we got a
forewarning that we'll have to
work on pass defense.
"Our whole defense has been a
disappointment this year. We've
got pretty much the same person
nel as we had last season when
we were seventh nationally in
pass defense. Something has hap
pened."
On the injury side, WSU lost
the services of its first string
fullback Ted Cano, who broke his
leg at COP. Cano will be re
placed by sophomore George
Reed.
As for Stanford, coach Jack
Curtice said onJy sophomore Hal
Stueber is expected to miss this
week's game. He injured his
knee last Saturday against Wash
ington.
"I fee] we've got just about as
good a club as Washington," Cur
tice said. "There were only 2G
yards difference in the yardage
statistics. But the rain and driz
zle didn't help."
Curtice said that below par re
ceiving was in part responsible
for Dick Norman's nightmarish
passing afternoon in Seattle.
"We played good defense up
there," he said, "and tackled bet
ter than against COPâ€”but the
offense just bogged down."
