# Indian Soccer Team Topples Aggies
## 
### Glenn Alford 
Stanford's soever team lived up
to Indian Coach Fred Priddle's
high expectations in earning a
hard-fought 3-2 victory over the
tough Cal Aggies last Saturday.
The game was played at Davis
under weather conditions that
would make an African pigmy
uncomfortable. The temperature
was in the 85-90 range and the
humidity wa« high, making it ex
tremely difficult or either team
to play its best game.
Look Out
If Stanford did not play its best
game Saturday, though, then the
other teams in the league had
better look out.
Defense was the key to the
victory. The Cal Aggies' high
scoring forwards were almost
completely corralled by a tough
Stanford back line led by goalie
Hunt Bascomb, center half Wolf

gang Storch, and fullback Dan |
Farthing.
Stanford's first goal came with
17:05 gone in the first quarter.
Sot up by beautiful passes by
right wing Adam Bianchi and
right inside Dick Bartlett, the
goal came on a hard smash off
the foot of Rune Engebretsen.
Cal Aggies scored next on a
squib kick by Alex Rarrau.
Storch gave Stanford a 2-1 lead
with a penalty kick, but the Ag
gies' Rudolf Trujillo tied the
game up just before the half
time.
The game remained tied through
the third quarter but Stanford
tallied on a beautiful piece of
teamwork midway in the fourth
! quarter. Bartlett, a play maker
all afternoon, laid the ball right j
j in front of the goal and Mike Tip
pett rammed it in to decide the!
I game.

The Aggies had a good chance
to lie it up with only minutes re
maining in the game, but Trujillo
missed a penalty kick.
Coach Pr i d d 1 e singled out
goalie Bascomb for special prai«e.
Bascomb is only a freshman, but
he did a wonderful job on de
ense. This was the first college
varsity game that Bascomb had
played in.
Bartlett Praised
Priddle also had kind things to
say about Bartlett, who injured
his leg in the first half but played
inspired ball late in the game
when Stanford was trying to
fight off a late Aggie challenge.
Bernie Knaggs played a fine
all-around game, and Storch was
a bulwark on defense.
The biggest Stanford needs are
replacements for the forward
line, which is strong but lacks
depth.

| The Stanford JV's were defeat
! eel by Travis AFB 13 1 earlier in
the day.
USF, perennial league cham
pion, had its 38-game winning
streak stopped on Saturday, los
ing to CCSF 3*o. This leaves the
league race a wide-open affair
with the Indians high on the li«t
of contenders.
The next opponent for Stanford
is that same San Francisco City
College team that dumped the
USF Dons on Saturday. The two
teams, currently tied for the top
spot in the Western loop, will
square off Saturday morning
starting at 11 a.m. at the Stan
ford soccer field.
Other teams which make up
the Western league are USF, San
Jose State, the Cal Aggies, San
Francisco State College, Santa
Clara, and the University of Cali
fornia.

varsity game that Bascomb had
played in.
Bartlett Praised
Priddle also had kind things to
say about Bartlett, who injured
his leg in the first half but played
inspired ball late in the game
when Stanford was trying to
fight off a late Aggie challenge.
Bernie Knaggs played a fine
all-around game, and Storch was
a bulwark on defense.
The biggest Stanford needs are
replacements for the forward
line, which is strong but lacks
depth.

USF, perennial league cham
pion, had its 38-game winning
streak stopped on Saturday, los
ing to CCSF 3*o. This leaves the
league race a wide-open affair
with the Indians high on the li«t
of contenders.
The next opponent for Stanford
is that same San Francisco City
College team that dumped the
USF Dons on Saturday. The two
teams, currently tied for the top
spot in the Western loop, will
square off Saturday morning
starting at 11 a.m. at the Stan
ford soccer field.
Other teams which make up
the Western league are USF, San
Jose State, the Cal Aggies, San
Francisco State College, Santa
Clara, and the University of Cali
fornia.
Stanford's soever team lived up
to Indian Coach Fred Priddle's
high expectations in earning a
hard-fought 3-2 victory over the
tough Cal Aggies last Saturday.
The game was played at Davis
under weather conditions that
would make an African pigmy
uncomfortable. The temperature
was in the 85-90 range and the
humidity wa« high, making it ex
tremely difficult or either team
to play its best game.
Look Out
If Stanford did not play its best
game Saturday, though, then the
other teams in the league had
better look out.
Defense was the key to the
victory. The Cal Aggies' high
scoring forwards were almost
completely corralled by a tough
Stanford back line led by goalie
Hunt Bascomb, center half Wolf

gang Storch, and fullback Dan |
Farthing.
Stanford's first goal came with
17:05 gone in the first quarter.
Sot up by beautiful passes by
right wing Adam Bianchi and
right inside Dick Bartlett, the
goal came on a hard smash off
the foot of Rune Engebretsen.
Cal Aggies scored next on a
squib kick by Alex Rarrau.
Storch gave Stanford a 2-1 lead
with a penalty kick, but the Ag
gies' Rudolf Trujillo tied the
game up just before the half
time.
The game remained tied through
the third quarter but Stanford
tallied on a beautiful piece of
teamwork midway in the fourth
! quarter. Bartlett, a play maker
all afternoon, laid the ball right j
j in front of the goal and Mike Tip
pett rammed it in to decide the!
I game.

The Aggies had a good chance
to lie it up with only minutes re
maining in the game, but Trujillo
missed a penalty kick.
