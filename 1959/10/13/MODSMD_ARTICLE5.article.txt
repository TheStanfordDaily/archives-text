# Steel Vows Long Fight On Issues
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) —Declaring j
it will not be beaten, the United I
Steelworkers Union said Monday
a court order may force an 80-day :
truce in the record steel strike j
"but there will be no permanent
peace."
Steelworkers President David
J. McDonald told a White House
fact-finding panel that at the end :
of the enforced truce the basic
issue would remain unsolved.
The basic issue, he said, is
"whether the companies will
break the union."
Excited
His voice swelling to a roar,
the white-haired union chief
boomed that the Steelworkers
"never, and I repeat never" would
yield to management's demands.
He said these call for elimination
of protection for workers against
changes in local working condi
tions as a prerequisite to a wage
settlement.
McDonald shouted that such
changes — which the companies
say are necessary to cut labor
costs —can be imposed "only over
our dead bodies."
Two Witnesses
McDonald and Arthur J. Gold
berg, the union's general counsel,
were leadoff witnesses as a three
man panel oegan hearings intend
ed to help President Eisenhower
decide whether to seek a strike
halting injunction. The board is
under orders to report to Eisen
hower by Friday.
Industry spokesmen were in
line to give their views to the fact
finders alter the union had had
its say about the increasingly
bitter dispute which dragged
through its 90th day.
In the past, the companies have
accused the unions of demanding
pay boosts and other benefits [
that management argued would
threaten new inflation. The steel
firms have pledged to resist this,
and there was no sign they were i
ready to back off.
The new conflict pointed to a i
renewed walkout about New 1
Year's Day even if a federal
court order should send the strik- j
ers back to the mills for 80 days, i
McDonald said his union would
bow to an injunction, although
opposed to it.
Added Tack
The panel's assigned job is to
find the facts in the case, but
Chairman George W. Taylor had
made it clear he planned to try
to work out a voluntary agree-!
merit. Taylor, an old hand at ar-!
ranging such settlements, is out
spoken in his feelings that a Taft-'
Hartley injunction only serves to
prolong a labor dispute.
Both McDonald and Goldberg
challenged the need for an injunc- j
lion to halt the strike, which has
shut down about 85 per cent of 1
the nation's steelmaking plants;
and idled about 800,000 workers, :
including half a million steel
hands. This strike already ranks
as the longest in the turbulent ,
history of the industry.
Goldberg contended the strike
poses no threat to national health i
or safety.

McDonald shouted that such

Two Witnesses
McDonald and Arthur J. Gold
berg, the union's general counsel,
were leadoff witnesses as a three
man panel oegan hearings intend
ed to help President Eisenhower
decide whether to seek a strike
halting injunction. The board is
under orders to report to Eisen
hower by Friday.
Industry spokesmen were in
line to give their views to the fact
finders alter the union had had
its say about the increasingly
bitter dispute which dragged
through its 90th day.
In the past, the companies have
accused the unions of demanding
pay boosts and other benefits [
that management argued would
threaten new inflation. The steel
firms have pledged to resist this,
and there was no sign they were i
ready to back off.
The new conflict pointed to a i
renewed walkout about New 1
Year's Day even if a federal
court order should send the strik- j
ers back to the mills for 80 days, i
McDonald said his union would
bow to an injunction, although
opposed to it.
Added Tack
The panel's assigned job is to
find the facts in the case, but
Chairman George W. Taylor had
made it clear he planned to try
to work out a voluntary agree-!
merit. Taylor, an old hand at ar-!
ranging such settlements, is out
spoken in his feelings that a Taft-'
Hartley injunction only serves to
prolong a labor dispute.
Both McDonald and Goldberg
challenged the need for an injunc- j
lion to halt the strike, which has
shut down about 85 per cent of 1
the nation's steelmaking plants;
and idled about 800,000 workers, :
including half a million steel
hands. This strike already ranks
as the longest in the turbulent ,
history of the industry.
Goldberg contended the strike
poses no threat to national health i
or safety.
WASHINGTON (/P) —Declaring j
it will not be beaten, the United I
Steelworkers Union said Monday
a court order may force an 80-day :
truce in the record steel strike j
"but there will be no permanent
peace."
Steelworkers President David
J. McDonald told a White House
fact-finding panel that at the end :
of the enforced truce the basic
issue would remain unsolved.
The basic issue, he said, is
"whether the companies will
break the union."
Excited
His voice swelling to a roar,
the white-haired union chief
boomed that the Steelworkers
"never, and I repeat never" would
yield to management's demands.
