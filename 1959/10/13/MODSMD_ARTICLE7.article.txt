# 'Father of Supersonic Age' To Orate on Astronautics
## 
### 
A colorful, flowing-haired scientist who is often referred to as the
"father of the supersonic age," will speak to the public on "Missiles,
Astronautics, and Space Flight" at 7:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. The program is the second in the Tuesday Evening Series.
Dr. Theodore von Karman is chairman of the President's advisory

group for aeronautical research
and development. He has had
long experience in the missile
field.
During World War 11, his
work was the basis for Jet-As
sisted-Take-Off (JATO) rockets.
This advance led him to become
one of the founders of Aerojet
Engineering Corporation, now
the world's largest rocket com
pany.
In 1944 he organized the scien
tific advisory board of the U.S.
Air Force and then steered it suc
cessfully for ten years. This
board made many important con
tributions to America's intercon
tinental ballistic missile and guid
ed missiles such as the Regulus
and the Snark.
Earlier work by Dr. von Kar
man aided the development of
the first American supersonic
tunnel; his study of air's resist
ance to objects moving at super
sonic speed paved the way for
design of modern jets and mis
siles.
