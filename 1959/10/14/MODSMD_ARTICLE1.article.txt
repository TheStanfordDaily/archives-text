The California Academy of
General Practice yesterday shelv
ed a resolution that criticized the
Stanford Medical School for "ex
cluding the family doctor from
its curriculum."
The resolution, proposed Mon
day by the San Mateo County

Chapter, called Stanford's reor
ganization unwise and urged the
medical school "to recognize gen
eral practice in the curriculum
and use general practice instruc
tions in the teaching staff wher
ever possible."
The resolution continued to ac

cuse the nation's medical schools
for turning out "gold-plated and
super-atomic specialists."
The Academy, however, voted
to refer the resolution to the
board of directors which yester
day decided that no action should
be taken without further discus
sion.
Dr. Robert Alway, dean of the
Stanford Medical School, ex
plained that the reorganization
attacked by the resolution "did
not exclude the family doctor; in
fact it excludes nothing that is
of value for the proper education
of doctors."
Two other members of the
I Academy, Dr. Carroll B. Andrews
of Sonoma and Dr. Leon Desi
mone of Los Angeles charged
that many of the medical stu
dents who are now going in for
specialties would make better
I practitioners if they had been
properly counseled by the facul
ties of their medical schools.
Answering these charges Al
way said that "a medical school's
goal should not be to turn out
general practitioners. Instead we
expect to produce well-trained
basic medical men able to go on
I to further specialties."
