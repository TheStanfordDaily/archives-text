## Courage, Money Cause Of Russian Missile Lead 
### Jo Nielsen 
The chairman of the President's advisory board for aeronautical
research and development told a standing-room-only audience last
night that the Russians arc leading the U.S. in missile power be
cause of courage and money.
In the second of the Tuesday Evening Series lectures, Dr. Theodore

von Karman expressed hope for
more scientific interchange be
tween the two countries. "I be
lieve that we will learn from
them and they will learn from
us," he said.
"Everyone knows that the Rus-;
sians have more luck with their,
missiles." But, he went on to say,;
with more money for scientific
research, the U.S. would be on an
equal plane with Russia.
Value Acquired in Century
Von Karman traced the his- j
tory of rockets after revealing
that less than a century ago, a
British general stated that rock
ets have no military value. The
leading scientist then showed the
expansion of aeronautics through
rockets and into missiles.
Illustrating with slides, he told j
about the tests now being made
for the effect of rockets on the
human body. "The human organ
does not react to speed but to
acceleration."
Two Types Missiles
He explained that there are
now two types of missiles, sub
marine and ballistic. He regretted
that there was so much emphasis
on their miiltary uses, and hoped
that they will be used more for
peaceful purposes in the future.
Although research is being
done on better methods of accel
erating the missiles, von Karman
feels that for our age at least,
chemical and nuclear power will
remain most widely in use.
Von Karman concluded by re
minding the audience that Co
lumbus didn't explore for mate
rial gains, but for new informa
tion. "Intellectual curiosity will
bring better knowledge of the
universe," he ended.

leading scientist then showed the
expansion of aeronautics through
rockets and into missiles.
Illustrating with slides, he told j
about the tests now being made
for the effect of rockets on the
human body. "The human organ
does not react to speed but to
acceleration."
Two Types Missiles
He explained that there are
now two types of missiles, sub
marine and ballistic. He regretted
that there was so much emphasis
on their miiltary uses, and hoped
that they will be used more for
peaceful purposes in the future.
Although research is being
done on better methods of accel
erating the missiles, von Karman
feels that for our age at least,
chemical and nuclear power will
remain most widely in use.
Von Karman concluded by re
minding the audience that Co
lumbus didn't explore for mate
rial gains, but for new informa
tion. "Intellectual curiosity will
bring better knowledge of the
universe," he ended.
