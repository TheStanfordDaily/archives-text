# New Chairman Battles Apathy
## 
### 
A more concentrated attempt
to get out the vote and to coun
teract student apathy during fall
quarter elections is the aim of
the newly appointed Elections
Commissions chairman, Ken Pur
cell.
Purcell feels that both Elec
tions Com members and Ihe can
didates for offices should make
more direct contact with the stu
dents, through informal talks at
living groups, rallies and im
promptu talks around campus.
Because the Head Yell Leader
will be elected during the fall
elections, due to a proposal
passed in last spring's election,
Purcell is working on a program
to have these candidates appear
at the San Jose State and UCLA
games. Students will then have
a better chance to judge for them
selves the yell-leading abilities of
each candidate.
