# U.S. Explorer VII Hurtles Into Orbit
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Flu. (/P) —The United States launched one satellite into orbit around the earth
yesterday and, in a dramatic new experiment, fired a missile across the path of another.
Explorer VII, a9l -pound "gyroscope" satellite equipped to study cosmic radiation and other myste
ries of space, was hurled into a low orbit by a Juno II rocket. It was another step in the program to
send a man into space within two years.
Earlier, a 847 jet bomber flying over the cape fired a 37-foot Bold Orion missile across the path of

the Explorer VI "Paddle Wheel"
satellite. The shot could lead to
development of air-launched mis
siles to knock down enemy satel
lites.
The Paddle Wheel was at the
low point of its orbit at an alti
tude of 146 miles and streaking
through the skies at 26,000 miles
an hour when the Bold Orion was
launched. It was aimed to pass
10 miles in front of the satellite.
A reliable source said the Bold
Orion sped 150 miles upward,
reaching a point four miles above
the satellite, then fell into the
Atlantic 1,000 miles northeast of
here.
Cautious
In Washington, the Air Force
issued a cautiously worded state
ment saying "preliminary evalua
tion indicates the mission was
successfully accomplished."
The "gyroscope" so named be
cause it looks like the whirling
devices used to stabilize planes in
flight, was placed in an orbit that
carries it as far as 664 miles from
the earth and as close as 346
miles. It is expected to remain
up 20 years.
The National Aeronautics and
Space Administration in Wash
ington said the satellite com
pleted its first circuit of the earth
in 101 minutes. It was sending
back information which may an
swer a question vital to every
one:
"What happens to sunshine—
where does it all go?"
Human Control
The answer could lead to vastly
improved weather forecasting, or
keys to human control over wea
ther. Or even perhaps to ad
vance warnings that a new ice
age was about to begin.
Over a year or 10 years, the
earth maintains a pretty good
balance between income and ex
penditure of sunshine heat.
But scientists don't know
whether this balance holds true
week by week or month by
month.
700 Miles
Dr. Homer Newell Jr. said the
satellite was aimed at an orbit
ranging from 700 miles at its out
ermost point to 340 miles at the
nearest.
Newell said the more circular
orbit attained is an advantage
from the standpoint of the num
ber of experiments carried.

700 Miles
Dr. Homer Newell Jr. said the
satellite was aimed at an orbit
ranging from 700 miles at its out
ermost point to 340 miles at the
nearest.
Newell said the more circular
orbit attained is an advantage
from the standpoint of the num
ber of experiments carried.
CAPE CANAVERAL, Flu. (/P) —The United States launched one satellite into orbit around the earth
yesterday and, in a dramatic new experiment, fired a missile across the path of another.
Explorer VII, a9l -pound "gyroscope" satellite equipped to study cosmic radiation and other myste
ries of space, was hurled into a low orbit by a Juno II rocket. It was another step in the program to
send a man into space within two years.
Earlier, a 847 jet bomber flying over the cape fired a 37-foot Bold Orion missile across the path of

the Explorer VI "Paddle Wheel"
satellite. The shot could lead to
development of air-launched mis
siles to knock down enemy satel
lites.
The Paddle Wheel was at the
low point of its orbit at an alti
tude of 146 miles and streaking
through the skies at 26,000 miles
an hour when the Bold Orion was
launched. It was aimed to pass
10 miles in front of the satellite.
A reliable source said the Bold
Orion sped 150 miles upward,
reaching a point four miles above
the satellite, then fell into the
Atlantic 1,000 miles northeast of
here.
Cautious
In Washington, the Air Force
issued a cautiously worded state
ment saying "preliminary evalua
tion indicates the mission was
successfully accomplished."
The "gyroscope" so named be
cause it looks like the whirling
devices used to stabilize planes in
flight, was placed in an orbit that
carries it as far as 664 miles from
the earth and as close as 346
miles. It is expected to remain
up 20 years.
The National Aeronautics and
Space Administration in Wash
ington said the satellite com
pleted its first circuit of the earth
in 101 minutes. It was sending
back information which may an
swer a question vital to every
one:
"What happens to sunshine—
where does it all go?"
Human Control
The answer could lead to vastly
improved weather forecasting, or
keys to human control over wea
ther. Or even perhaps to ad

age was about to begin.
