## EDITORIALS, COLUMNS, INTERPRETATION It's About Those Roads

"Millions for defense but no! one cent for tribute" was tlie
rallying cry in tlie days of tlie Barbary pirates.
Its modern successor, for Stanford students al least, could just
as easily be "Thousands, for new roads, but not one cent for im
provements."
The 1 niversit\'s policies regarding campus thoroughfares are
not, of course, quite that exaggerated—but every time we drive
our car around Stanford that saying seems pretty appropriate.
It's not a case of whether or not we like that new system of one
way streets wending through the trees to the med school it's just
that we're tired of breaking springs on some of the other not-so-new
roads around here.
Traffic at the Lomita and Serra intersection (by Biology Cor
ner) is among the heaviest on campus. Perhaps it would move a
bit smoother if it weren't for those 10 or 15 feet of washboard on
Lomita.
Or then there's the plight of students who have to go to the rear
part of Menlo Park. Unless they want to drive more than a mile
out of their way by going around Lake Lagunita, they have to light
a nice long stretch of rutted dirt road past the golf course and
stables- But that's all that's left since Los Arboles Road was closed
a couple of years ago. The situation might also be improved a bit
if one could get onto Willow Road via Searsville Road without
having to drive off a small rutted elifl'-like bit of dirl road.
Back into our original area of small improvements, we can cite
a safety factor as sufficient cause for some additional sign-painting
along our thoroughfares. Though new slop signs have been in
stalled at many points, few of these have any sort of warning signs
painted on the pavement.
Take the stop sign at the corner of Quarry Road and the med
school parking lot entrance as an example: the sign itself is bidden
behind a utility pole and a tree, there is no warning painted on
the pavement, and there is not even the customary while line at
the point where traffic is supposed to stop.
Campus Drive at Lasueii is now a stop sign point as well, and
there are no warnings. It's no wonder, then, to see cars whizzing
through this point where drivers are accustomed to finding no
stops.
In the washboard category again, there's still Escondido Road,
near its intersection with Stanford Avenue.
The list of "little things" that could stand improvement in the
road system could go on for some length, but this isn't necessary.
As long as big money is being spent for new roads, we can't see
why some little money can't go toward fixing existing facilities and
eliminating safety hazards.
