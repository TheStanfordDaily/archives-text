Brilliant . . . stunning . . . mag
nificent! These were the com
ments heard during intermission
and again after the show at the
Curran Theater Friday night, ac
claiming "Mary Stuart" as an ex
ample of truly great theater.
A show such as this should
run at least a month, hut un
fortunately, the last perform
ances of Frederick Schiller's ro
mantic drama are scheduled
for tonight through Saturday.
In the roles which easily could
have been written for Ihcm. Eva
LeGallienne and Signe Hasso
bring alive the two mighty
queens, Elizabeth of England and
Mary of Scotland, respectively,
around whom the play revolves.
Each a dynamic actress, each
powerful and commandingly re
gal whenever she appears on the
stage, together the two actresses
leave the audience spellbound af
ter the first act scene where the
two majesties confront each oth
er.
In reality, Elizabeth and Mary
never met, hut the temptation
of such an inherently dramatic
scene must have been too much
for Schiller who uses! it suc
cessfully to heighten theatrical
effect.
Stunning Eliznbethan costumes
and exciting settings and lighting
effects compliment the show, but
attention is centered at all times
on the brilliant performances of
Miss LeGallienne and Miss Has
so.
Directed by Englishman Ty
rone Guthrie, these remarkable
actresses along with the rest of
t lie excellent cast have made
"Mary Stuart" something to be
remembered in this area for a
long time. If you're a theater
fan at all, this is a "must."
Tickets for the remaining per
formances are priced from $2 to
$4 for tonight and tomorrow
night, $2.50 $4.50 for Friday and
Saturday nights, and $2 $3.50 for
the matinees.
To finish the evening with a
flourish, why not drop in at the
Hungry i where the Limeliters,
a very good popular folk music
group, and Marilyn Child, anoth

er folk singer and product of the
Hungry i, are currently appear
ing. (While we're on names, per
haps you've heard that the name
Hungry i stems from the days
when groups of hungry intellec
tuals sat contemplating there.)
