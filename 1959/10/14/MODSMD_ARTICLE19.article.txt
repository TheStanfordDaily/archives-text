### Rich Sundeen ASSU President 
More than 1500 Stanford stu
dents are married. Of this sig
nificant percentage of the total
student body, a large majority
have wives who do not attend
Stanford.
At the last meeting of Legis
lature, Ed Warren, a married
student, set before the group
the idea of aiding students'
wives who are not attending
Stanford with some type of stu
dent financial rates for activi
ties and opportunities open to
all students.
He pointed out that the Univer
sity has done much in aiding the
married students and their wives,
citing Esconnido Village and the
inclusion of the whole family in
the Stanford medical insurance
plan.
However, Warren feels that, in
light of the budgeted finances of
many of the married students
and their families, married stu
dents could take advantage of
more student activities if they
were able to purchase tickets for
their wives at rales comparable
to those of students.
One suggestion was some
type of plan which would en
title the owner to privileges
similar to a member of ASSIJ.
In this case, those interested
could purchase a blanket card
for a price corresponding to the
amount taken out of tuition for
ASSIJ fees.
Before such a plan could be un
dertaken, much study and inves

ligation must be made concern
ing the problem. Thus, Legisla
ture has referred it to a subcom
mittee. This committee will de
termine the feasibility of such a
project. If it is decided that such
legislation is advisable, the com
mittee, wilh the aid of married
student representatives, will de
vise some plan drawn according
to the needs of our campus and
from similar programs of other
•schools.
Also at our last meeling, Leg
islature had the pleasure of meet
ing and hearing from two of
our ten ASSU foreign scholars.
Th roug ho u t the subsequent
weeks of the quarter the other
scholars will also address the
Legislature. I hope that you, too,
will be able to meet them on an
informal basis. We can learn
much from them, and of course
they are here to learn of our
United States and its people -
meaning you.
At long last, plans for tin*
initiation of our Stanford Stu
dent Union are becoming a
reality. Legislature lias invited
Chester Berry, the Union direc
tor, to speak at its next meet
ing.
The purpose of his talk will be
to inform the Legislature of the
Union project and what role the
students should assume in this
project. More information and
details concerning this vital topic
will soon follow.

to those of students.
One suggestion was some
type of plan which would en
title the owner to privileges
similar to a member of ASSIJ.
In this case, those interested
could purchase a blanket card
for a price corresponding to the
amount taken out of tuition for
ASSIJ fees.
Before such a plan could be un
dertaken, much study and inves

ligation must be made concern
ing the problem. Thus, Legisla
ture has referred it to a subcom
mittee. This committee will de
termine the feasibility of such a
project. If it is decided that such
legislation is advisable, the com
mittee, wilh the aid of married
student representatives, will de
vise some plan drawn according
to the needs of our campus and
from similar programs of other
•schools.
Also at our last meeling, Leg
islature had the pleasure of meet
ing and hearing from two of
our ten ASSU foreign scholars.
Th roug ho u t the subsequent
weeks of the quarter the other
scholars will also address the
Legislature. I hope that you, too,
will be able to meet them on an
informal basis. We can learn
much from them, and of course
they are here to learn of our
United States and its people -
meaning you.
At long last, plans for tin*
initiation of our Stanford Stu
dent Union are becoming a
reality. Legislature lias invited
Chester Berry, the Union direc
tor, to speak at its next meet
ing.
The purpose of his talk will be
to inform the Legislature of the
Union project and what role the
students should assume in this
project. More information and
details concerning this vital topic
will soon follow.
More than 1500 Stanford stu
dents are married. Of this sig
nificant percentage of the total
student body, a large majority
have wives who do not attend
Stanford.
At the last meeting of Legis
lature, Ed Warren, a married
student, set before the group
the idea of aiding students'
wives who are not attending
Stanford with some type of stu
dent financial rates for activi
ties and opportunities open to
all students.
He pointed out that the Univer
sity has done much in aiding the
married students and their wives,
citing Esconnido Village and the
inclusion of the whole family in
the Stanford medical insurance
plan.
However, Warren feels that, in
light of the budgeted finances of
many of the married students
and their families, married stu
dents could take advantage of
more student activities if they
were able to purchase tickets for
their wives at rales comparable
to those of students.
