On Parking Fees
(Editor's Note: The follow
ing letter is a partial copy of a
reply sent to the party who
wrote The Daily complaining
of parking sticker fees.)
Dear Mrs. Passell:
President Sterling is in the
East at the moment and the car
bon of your letter to The Daily
concerning our auto registration
fee has been referred to me.
I should like to emphasize thai
this is not a "parking" but a reg
istration fee which helps defray
several expenses connected with j
cars on the campus.

The University recognized that
the new fee would be a hardship
in some cases. But making ex
ceptions to the fee, as you sug
gest, would lead to a chaotic con
dition. Rather, it seemed more
reasonable to expect that stu
dents with financial problems
from this and other causes would
consult with the University's Of
fice of Financial Aids. This of
fice exists for the very reason
you cite in your letter, that "we
should not assume the University
is concerned only with those who
can 'afford' its services."
