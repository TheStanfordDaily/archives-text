Cougars Take Up Residence
There was a popular suggestion Monday that Washington State
publicity man Dick Fry take up commuting from Pullman to the
Bay Area. Or taking up residence here, anyhow.
Fry is in the area for the third week of the last four, ahead of
the Cougars who Saturday take on Stanford in their third Bay Area
game of the season. Dick is getting to be a familiar face around
San Francisco press circles. Word is out that he is starting a drive
for WSU-in-Alameda. It would be much handier that way.
Washington State, as one of the schools left outside by the new
AAWIJ, had real scheduling problems this year seeing that both
UCLA and Southern California dropped off the slate at late notice.
The result is that the Cougars have only two games in Pullman this
year, one in Spokane, and seven away from home. Then, of course,
there is the unique home-and-home series with Oregon, another team
that was beset by scheduling troubles thanks to UCLA's and IJSC's
walking out.

And it wasn't until August
ahout six weeks ago to be exact
that WSU completed its sched
ule. That eleventh hour addition
is a Thanksgiving Day engage
ment with the University of Hous
ton. In Houston, of course.
Hut the scheduling troubles
weren't enough. The Cougars,
with the preseason hope that they
might possibly have their best
team in coach >lim Sutherland's
four-year reign, haven't clicked
yet. They've lost two games out
of four and those two losses Cal
and Oregon have just about
eliminated WSU from Rose Bowl
contention. And Look magazine,
among others, had tabbed the
Cougs for a Pasadena date New
Year's day.
It should be an interesting day
Saturday, at least when Stanford
has the ball. The Cards and Dick
Norman will be trying to recover
from a horible afternoon of pass
ing in Seattle last Saturday; WSU
will be trying to plug up an air

defense thai was extremely vulnerable last week against College of
the Pacific.
In Stockton, the Cougars were riddled by a quarterback named
Bob Ciutiss, who to this date has been just plain OP Bob Catiss.
Catiss completed 15 passes against WSU not a terribly impressive
statistic—but the 15 logged 328 yards.
These passes into just about the same secondary that last season
was seventh in the nation for defensing passes. Defense, in fact,
has been a problem to the Cougars all season. Second on the Coast
to Oregon last year, there have been no signs of the same hard-nosed
defending this season. This, with most of last year's line returning.
Passing Team Without a <^)B
Quarterback has been the real troublespot for the C'ougs, though.
For three years, they rode through behind two, not just one, of
the best passers in the land. Bob Newman and Bunny Aldrich for
two years and last year Newman and Davey Wilson.
Mike Agee, a converted end, and sophomore Mel Melin have been
given the job this year. Technically, they have worked out pretty
well. Neither figured to be a Newman, but both had adequate ability.
Some enthusiasts were calling Melin potentially a better thrower
than Newman. But he hasn't clicked yet on his passes, has been
consistently overthrowing his receivers, and hasn't been able to move
the team on the ground. Agee can move the team on the ground, but
isn't a great passer.
Jack Curtice didn't come right out and say "we really want this
one," but there could be a bit of revenge-seeking in the Stanford
camp Saturday. "WSU gave us quite a reception up there last year
in my first game," said Jack (the Cougars won, 40-6). "So I've got
kind of a special interest in making this an interesting afternoon."
Of course, those Stanfords who remember back two years have
memories too. Such as an 18-7 Stanford lead with 3:33 to play and
the ball on the WSU 13. That game ended 21-18, Washington State.

defense thai was extremely vulnerable last week against College of
the Pacific.
In Stockton, the Cougars were riddled by a quarterback named
Bob Ciutiss, who to this date has been just plain OP Bob Catiss.
Catiss completed 15 passes against WSU not a terribly impressive
statistic—but the 15 logged 328 yards.
These passes into just about the same secondary that last season
was seventh in the nation for defensing passes. Defense, in fact,
has been a problem to the Cougars all season. Second on the Coast
to Oregon last year, there have been no signs of the same hard-nosed
defending this season. This, with most of last year's line returning.

Quarterback has been the real troublespot for the C'ougs, though.
For three years, they rode through behind two, not just one, of
the best passers in the land. Bob Newman and Bunny Aldrich for
two years and last year Newman and Davey Wilson.
Mike Agee, a converted end, and sophomore Mel Melin have been
given the job this year. Technically, they have worked out pretty
well. Neither figured to be a Newman, but both had adequate ability.
Some enthusiasts were calling Melin potentially a better thrower
than Newman. But he hasn't clicked yet on his passes, has been
consistently overthrowing his receivers, and hasn't been able to move
the team on the ground. Agee can move the team on the ground, but
isn't a great passer.
Jack Curtice didn't come right out and say "we really want this
one," but there could be a bit of revenge-seeking in the Stanford
camp Saturday. "WSU gave us quite a reception up there last year
in my first game," said Jack (the Cougars won, 40-6). "So I've got
kind of a special interest in making this an interesting afternoon."
Of course, those Stanfords who remember back two years have
memories too. Such as an 18-7 Stanford lead with 3:33 to play and

for WSU-in-Alameda. It would be much handier that way.
Washington State, as one of the schools left outside by the new
AAWIJ, had real scheduling problems this year seeing that both
UCLA and Southern California dropped off the slate at late notice.
The result is that the Cougars have only two games in Pullman this
year, one in Spokane, and seven away from home. Then, of course,
there is the unique home-and-home series with Oregon, another team
that was beset by scheduling troubles thanks to UCLA's and IJSC's
walking out.

And it wasn't until August
ahout six weeks ago to be exact
that WSU completed its sched
ule. That eleventh hour addition
is a Thanksgiving Day engage
ment with the University of Hous
ton. In Houston, of course.
Hut the scheduling troubles
weren't enough. The Cougars,
with the preseason hope that they
might possibly have their best
team in coach >lim Sutherland's
four-year reign, haven't clicked
yet. They've lost two games out
of four and those two losses Cal
and Oregon have just about
eliminated WSU from Rose Bowl
contention. And Look magazine,
among others, had tabbed the
Cougs for a Pasadena date New
Year's day.
It should be an interesting day
Saturday, at least when Stanford
has the ball. The Cards and Dick
Norman will be trying to recover
from a horible afternoon of pass
ing in Seattle last Saturday; WSU
will be trying to plug up an air

defense thai was extremely vulnerable last week against College of
the Pacific.
In Stockton, the Cougars were riddled by a quarterback named
Bob Ciutiss, who to this date has been just plain OP Bob Catiss.
Catiss completed 15 passes against WSU not a terribly impressive
statistic—but the 15 logged 328 yards.
These passes into just about the same secondary that last season
was seventh in the nation for defensing passes. Defense, in fact,
has been a problem to the Cougars all season. Second on the Coast
to Oregon last year, there have been no signs of the same hard-nosed
defending this season. This, with most of last year's line returning.
Passing Team Without a <^)B
Quarterback has been the real troublespot for the C'ougs, though.
For three years, they rode through behind two, not just one, of
the best passers in the land. Bob Newman and Bunny Aldrich for
two years and last year Newman and Davey Wilson.
Mike Agee, a converted end, and sophomore Mel Melin have been
given the job this year. Technically, they have worked out pretty
well. Neither figured to be a Newman, but both had adequate ability.
Some enthusiasts were calling Melin potentially a better thrower
than Newman. But he hasn't clicked yet on his passes, has been
consistently overthrowing his receivers, and hasn't been able to move
the team on the ground. Agee can move the team on the ground, but
isn't a great passer.
Jack Curtice didn't come right out and say "we really want this
one," but there could be a bit of revenge-seeking in the Stanford
camp Saturday. "WSU gave us quite a reception up there last year
in my first game," said Jack (the Cougars won, 40-6). "So I've got
kind of a special interest in making this an interesting afternoon."
Of course, those Stanfords who remember back two years have
memories too. Such as an 18-7 Stanford lead with 3:33 to play and
the ball on the WSU 13. That game ended 21-18, Washington State.

Cougars Take Up Residence
There was a popular suggestion Monday that Washington State
publicity man Dick Fry take up commuting from Pullman to the
Bay Area. Or taking up residence here, anyhow.
Fry is in the area for the third week of the last four, ahead of
the Cougars who Saturday take on Stanford in their third Bay Area
game of the season. Dick is getting to be a familiar face around
San Francisco press circles. Word is out that he is starting a drive
for WSU-in-Alameda. It would be much handier that way.
