# ANYONE HAVE A PASSER?
## Cougars Looking For Quarterback Daily Sports 
### 
"If Washington State comes up
I with a quarterback," the presea
i sone dope said, "The Cougars
could take it all." After four
games, the Cougars haven't yet
come up with a top-flight qb, and
I Stanford this week meets a team
'still waiting to "jell."
Coach Jim Sutherland, long
i known as one of the nation's
! leading advocates of the air game,
thus finds himself with a passing
offense and no passer. At least
not a passer to compare with Bob
Newman, Bunny Aldrich or Dave
! Wilson who for the past three
years have ranked among the na
tion's leaders.
So of all thingsâ€”a Sutherland
! team has had to rely on the
| ground game, which has been
solid, but is still a ground game
in an offense built for passing.
Offense Slowed
Senior Mike Agee and sopho
more Mel Melin were entrusted
| with the Cougar signal-calling
j role this season and have yet to
gel the offense working to per
i feet ion. Even in WSU's most im
pressive victory 30-6 over San
Jose State the offense sputtered
most of the afternoon and only a
i pair of sudden scores in the clos
ing moments made the margin
: "respectable."
A new twist was added to the
offense this year when Suther
land instituted an unbalanced
line. As it works, there is really
no left end. The left ."tackle" is
eligible on many plays; the right
| "end" is often really a tackle, and
j the guy who is supposed to be a
"left end" is usually a wide
flanker on the right side. In other
words, the line usually reads: It,
lg, c, rg, rt, re, flanker.
The Cougars still have a host
of fine receivers holdovers from
the days of more frequent pass
ing. Speedy Gail Cogdill, the
starting flanker, heads these pass
; catchers and presents one of the
most dangerous threats on the
i Coast.
Ellersick Brilliant
Don Ellersick, another brilliant
I receiver last season, is in the
| wingback slot this year, and La-
Roy Rath, the starting wing for
two seasons is alternating from
| end to fullback.
The WSU ground game was
| given a jolt last week when San
i Francisco's Ted Cano broke his
| leg. Cano had been the starting
fullback most of the season. How-
I ever, the presence of junior Keith
! Lincoln and sophomore speed
i sters George Reed and Perry Har
per make the Cougs a real over
i land threat.
Harper is the Johnny-come
; lately of the crew. A top sprinter
j on the track team, he gained 81
yards in eight tries against Col
lege of the Pacific last week.
Lincoln (6-2, 205), has the pros

j excited. A deceptive runner, he
also is a 42-yard-average punter
| and teamed vvilh Cogdill on a per
fect 67-yard scoring pass in the
Cal game. Lincoln's pass traveled
I 52 yards in the air.
Most of last season's line re
turns. The Cougars are especially
j strong at center with Marv Nel
son and Mori Hit/el, and at tackle
with Dick Farrar, Garner Ek
stran, Myke Lindsay and Jim
Greig.
But the darling of the fans is
: at guard: junior Bill Berry. Berry
i is 5-7 and weighs 100 and has
been the Cougars' best guard for
two years.
Last season the Cougar line de
veloped into one of the loop's
| toughest. With Newman in the
! lineup, the team had thought
mostly of offense for two seasons,
j and WSU was noted as having
one of the most vulnerable de
fenses in the country.
But when Newman was injured
early last season, the emphasis
I shifted more and more to defense.
