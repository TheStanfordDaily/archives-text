Stanford's Dick Norman con
tinues to dominate tho AAWU in
dividual statistics, despite having
a miserable afternoon wrestling
with a soggy pigskin in Washing
ion last Saturday. Norman tops
tho passers with 52 completions
in 93 attempts for 040 yards. Far
behind are Wayne Crow of Cali
fornia and Boh Sehloredt of
Washington with 12 completions
each. An oddity is the ranking of
Stanford's second string quarter
back, Rod Sears, as the fourth
leading passer in the league with
! 10 complet ions.
Norman leads the total offense
I statistics by a fantastic margin.
He has compiled 658 total yards,
more than twice as much as his
nearest competitor, Sehloredt.
Bill Kilmer of UCLA is a far
distant third.
Bates Ahead

! than doubled his rushing yardage
I with a big Sat urday against No
i tre Dame and took over the rush
ing lead. Bates has gained 177
yards in only 20 carries for an
8.8 average. Lynn Gaskill, of
USC has averaged a fantastic 14
yards per carry. Skip Face has
rushed for 134 yards to rank
fourth in the conference.
Kilmer is the AAWU's leading
punter with a 44.3 average. Rick
McMillen of Stanford is second
with Sehloredt third. Face
dropped from first to fourth after
a below par showing against
Washington.

five pass receivers. Chris Bur
ford has 19 receptions, Ben Rob
inson 16. Dick Bowers 10, and
Skip Face 7 to pace (he statistics.
SC Tops Conference
With the exception of Stan
ford's lead in the passing statis
tics, USC tops the conference in
every department. USC has
yielded the least yardage both on
the ground and in the air. They
also have yielded the fewest
points. USC has the most yards
gained rushing and also leads in
total offense.
