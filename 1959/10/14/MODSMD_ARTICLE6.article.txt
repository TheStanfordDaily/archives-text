## 
### Roy Schmidt 
"Before getting mad and criti
cizing racial difficulties at Little
I Rock we ought to put our own
j house in order." This statement
concerning California's migratory
i labor problems, was made by At
torney Laurence R. Grannis at a
i meeting of the ASSU Political
; Union held yesterday at Bowman
Alumni House.
Grannis presented the legal and
political side of the problem and
predicted that it will be a major
! issue in the next session of the
State Legislature. He said that
it will narrow down to a battle
between labor unions, who oppose
importation of labor, and the
farm groups, who support it.
Dr. Bruce Jcssup of the School
of Medicine, who formei ly work
ledIed with the Santa Clara County
j Health Department, also contrib
uted to the discussion of health
: problems among imported Mexi
can laborers. He described the
"abominable health conditions"
| which exist mainly because the
Mexican braceros are not eligible
for county hospital service. State
l law provides that this residential
j service is for people who have rc
| sided within the county for one
year.
