### 
WASHINGTON (/P)—The chief
of President Eisenhower's steel
strike inquiry board said yester
day it would be "a miracle of the
very first order" if a strike set
tlement can be achieved this
week.
In evident discouragement, Dr.
George W. Taylor, chairman of
the fact-finding panel exploring
the 91-day steel strike, indicated
there was little hope of averting
a Taft-Hartley law injunction
forcing 500,000 steelworkers back
io the mills for an 80-day cooling
off period.
Friday Deudline
Eisenhower set Friday as the
deadline for the panel's report.
When he gets it, the President
may instruct the attorney general
to seek a federal court injunction
ending the walkout for 80 days
while mediation efforts go for
ward.
Taylor told newsmen that the
panel is very distressed that it
still has nut been able to get the
issues in the dispute defined
after two days of testimony.
The chairman said mediators
cannot work effectively until the
issues are etched out.
He chided both sides for not
clarifying the issues.
Union Witnesses
Only union witnesses have ap
peared so far. Industry spokes
men were expected to get their
turn today.
The Steelworkers Union was
trying on its own to bring about
last-ditch bargaining in hope of
ending the strike before the gov
ernment moves in court to do so.
David J. McDonald, president
of the striking Steelworkers
Union, tried openly to get the
decision-making heads of the
country's four biggest steel com
panies into immediate, brass
tacks bargaining.
Challenge
"I challenge these gentlemen to
appear, sit down with us, and do
the job," he said.
McDonald named the four as
Roger M. Blough of U.S. Steel
Corp., A. B. Homer of Bethlehem
Steel, Charles White of Republic
and Avery Adams of Jones &
Laughlin.

Eisenhower set Friday as the
deadline for the panel's report.

panel is very distressed that it
still has nut been able to get the
issues in the dispute defined

cannot work effectively until the
issues are etched out.

clarifying the issues.

turn today.
The Steelworkers Union was
trying on its own to bring about
last-ditch bargaining in hope of

of the striking Steelworkers
Union, tried openly to get the
decision-making heads of the

panies into immediate, brass
tacks bargaining.
Challenge
"I challenge these gentlemen to
appear, sit down with us, and do
the job," he said.
