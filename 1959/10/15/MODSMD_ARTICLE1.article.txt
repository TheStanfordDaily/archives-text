# Plan to Annex Stanford Told
## 
### 
A propositi to annex the Stanford academic reserve, including the
Quad, housing areas and the stadium, to Palo Alto was made by
Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce President George S. Nolte yes
terday.
The seven-square-mile area has a population of 12,000, including
students.
Allied E. Brandin, vice president in charge of university business

affairs, including land develop
ment, said that the University
had not been contacted concern
ing the proposal.
No Comment
He said he would not be able
to comment on tlie proposal un
til Nolte contacts Stanford offi
cials and explains his suggestion.
The chamber head made the
proposal at a meeting of the
group's board of directors, and
said he plans to talk over the
possibility of annexation with city
and University officials.
Stanford's plan has been to an
nex its nonacademic sections to
Palo Alto when they are devel
oped. The Stanford Industrial
Park, the Stanford shopping cen
ter and areas set aside for hous
ing development have been an
nexed in the past few years.
However, the school recently
has given signs it prefers that the
academic reserve remain unin
corporated.
Half of ( ampus
The reserve makes up about
half of the 8,800 Stanford acres in
San Mateo and Santa Clara coun
t ies.
It also would take in the I<).>
million-dollar linear accelerator
proposed for construction in the
foothills behind the campus.
Nolte noted that the plan is
still in "an exploratory stage''
and has not been formally con
sidered by t lie chamber's board of
directors.
He gave added prestige for
Palo Alio and prospective bene
fits for Stanford as two main
reasons for the annexation.
Proposal I'raised
He suggested that many of the
school's municipal-type services,
such as fire and police protec
tion, might be assumed by the
city, should the campus move
within the city limits.
Nolte's proposal was praised
by Vice Mayor Stanley Evans,
who also serves on the chamber
of commerce board.

group's board of directors, and
said he plans to talk over the
possibility of annexation with city
and University officials.
Stanford's plan has been to an
nex its nonacademic sections to
Palo Alto when they are devel
oped. The Stanford Industrial
Park, the Stanford shopping cen
ter and areas set aside for hous
ing development have been an
nexed in the past few years.
However, the school recently
has given signs it prefers that the
academic reserve remain unin
corporated.
Half of ( ampus
The reserve makes up about
half of the 8,800 Stanford acres in
San Mateo and Santa Clara coun
t ies.
It also would take in the I<).>
million-dollar linear accelerator
proposed for construction in the
foothills behind the campus.
Nolte noted that the plan is
still in "an exploratory stage''
and has not been formally con
sidered by t lie chamber's board of
directors.
He gave added prestige for
Palo Alio and prospective bene
fits for Stanford as two main
reasons for the annexation.
Proposal I'raised
He suggested that many of the
school's municipal-type services,
such as fire and police protec
tion, might be assumed by the
city, should the campus move
within the city limits.
Nolte's proposal was praised
by Vice Mayor Stanley Evans,
who also serves on the chamber
of commerce board.
A propositi to annex the Stanford academic reserve, including the
Quad, housing areas and the stadium, to Palo Alto was made by
Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce President George S. Nolte yes
terday.
The seven-square-mile area has a population of 12,000, including
students.
Allied E. Brandin, vice president in charge of university business

affairs, including land develop
ment, said that the University
had not been contacted concern
ing the proposal.
No Comment
He said he would not be able
to comment on tlie proposal un
til Nolte contacts Stanford offi
cials and explains his suggestion.
The chamber head made the
proposal at a meeting of the
