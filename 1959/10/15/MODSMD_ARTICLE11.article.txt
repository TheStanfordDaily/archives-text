# Monday Is New Deadline For Steel Strike Inquiry
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) President Eisenhower's inquiry panel, still plugging against odds for settlement
ol' the marathon steel strike, yesterday was granted an added three days for handing its report to the
White House.
Eisenhower agreed to mo.ve ahead his deadline for receiving the report from tomorrow to Monday.
The President must get the report, detailing the facts in the dispute, before he can order the Justice

Department to seek an 80-day
strike-stopping injunction.
The extension gives the three
man inquiry board time to try to j
wangle a peace pact.
That would make a report un-!
necessary. Pan e 1 Chairman j
George W. Taylor, a veteran me-1
diator of labor disputes, said:
"Naturally, our aim is to avoid
filing any report at all."
It was clear the panel was driv-!
ing hard in the time left to break
(he deadlock that has blocked set
tlement of the 92-day strike, |
worst in steel industry history.
Union Case
The striking United Steelwork
ers Union completed its argu- j
mcnts on the strike issues Tues
day night.
R. Conrad Cooper, executive
vice president of U.S. Steel Corp.,
and chief industry negotiator,
kicked off the companies' side
yesterday.
"Plain Hogwash," is how Coo
per characterized union charges
that the industry is trying to
break the union. He said Ihe in- 1
dustry needs relief from obsolete
and unnecessarily costly work
practices.
There was little outward evi-!
dence Taylor's panel has yet
scored any gain toward moving
both sides toward agreement.
.Management
Cooper and another leading in
dustry negotiator, John A. Morse
of Bethlehem Steel, told the in- j
quiry panel that more manage- |
ment leeway in achieving labor j
cost economies is a precondition i
to any settlement of economic
issues such as wage rates.
Morse agreed with Taylor, how- j
ever, that the industry is not
adamant on how these labor cost !
economies are to be achieved.
Similarly, on prodding from
Taylor, union President David J.
McDonald agreed the Steelwork
ers' economic demands are also
susceptible to bargaining.

Morse agreed with Taylor, how- j
ever, that the industry is not
adamant on how these labor cost !

WASHINGTON (/P) President Eisenhower's inquiry panel, still plugging against odds for settlement
ol' the marathon steel strike, yesterday was granted an added three days for handing its report to the
White House.
Eisenhower agreed to mo.ve ahead his deadline for receiving the report from tomorrow to Monday.
The President must get the report, detailing the facts in the dispute, before he can order the Justice

Department to seek an 80-day
strike-stopping injunction.
The extension gives the three
man inquiry board time to try to j
wangle a peace pact.
That would make a report un-!
necessary. Pan e 1 Chairman j
George W. Taylor, a veteran me-1
diator of labor disputes, said:
"Naturally, our aim is to avoid
filing any report at all."
It was clear the panel was driv-!
ing hard in the time left to break
(he deadlock that has blocked set
tlement of the 92-day strike, |
worst in steel industry history.
Union Case
The striking United Steelwork
ers Union completed its argu- j
mcnts on the strike issues Tues
day night.
R. Conrad Cooper, executive
vice president of U.S. Steel Corp.,
and chief industry negotiator,
kicked off the companies' side
yesterday.
"Plain Hogwash," is how Coo
per characterized union charges
that the industry is trying to
break the union. He said Ihe in- 1
dustry needs relief from obsolete
and unnecessarily costly work
practices.
There was little outward evi-!
dence Taylor's panel has yet
scored any gain toward moving
both sides toward agreement.
