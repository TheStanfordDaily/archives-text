# New Traffic Control
## 
### 
Two traffic lights may soon
regulate Palm Drive traffic. A
temporary one was stationed at
the new Campus Drive intersec
tion yesterday to test its effect
on traffic flow.
Police Chief Gordon Davis and
Safety Director Robert Love both
recommended to the Planning
Office that a permanent installa
tion be made.
During peak load hours, the
light would stop Palm Drive traf
fic to permit an easy exit for
drivers leaving campus and re

lievo the congestion now occur
ring at noon and 5 p.m. During
other hours the light would be
set as a flashing caution light.
The temporary light used in
yesterday's test was borrowed
from a San Jose firm and will
be used through this weekend.
Police expect to station it at sev
eral other trouble points on cam
pus to discover whether installa
tion of a permanent light would
alleviate those situations.
