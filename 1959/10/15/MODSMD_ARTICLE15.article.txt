### 
New University living groups
: may have individual libraries for
reference and general reading,
according to Thompson M. Little,
senior librarian in the Humani
ties and Social Sciences Division.
Possibilities for expansion of
the dormitory library program
stem from the first-year success
of the libraries in Muir and Bur
bank houses of Stern Ilall, Little
reported.
. I Other groups living in new
quarters wishing libraries of their
I own should send two or three
representatives to see Elmer Grie
der in the director's office of the
Main Library.
The program was started by
Little and Dr. R. C. Swank, Di
rector of University Libraries. In
' itially each library received a
; $2000 grant from the Dormitory
Reserve Fund. Graduate students
were salaried for regular super
vision of the libraries.
Each library started with 503
| volumes, general and reference
books chosen from the General
Studies course. Capacity is 1000
volumes.
