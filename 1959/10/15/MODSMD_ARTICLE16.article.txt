# MONEY PLANS
## LASSU To Review New Union 
### Steve Baffrey Associate Editor 
Stanford's student legislature
will hear a report tonight from
Chester A. Berry, new director of
the Stanford Union. Berry is ex
pected to discuss proposed activi
ties and monetary aspects of the
University's plans for the new
student activities center.
Another report is also on the
docket. This is a proposed plan
for the year's activities of the
Cardinals Board. This report had
been asked for by a special study
committee of last year's legisla
ture, but had not been submitted
until called for by Lagunita rep
resentative Barbara Hicks last
week.
Big Game Dance
It appears, with the Cardinals
plans up for review, that addi
tional discussion may be forth
coming on the questioned $200
appropriation for an all-campus
Big Game dance. Since approved
by the Legislature two weeks ago,
there has been considerable ad
verse comment about the plan.
Also, it is expected that Rally
Com will request an appropria
tion to pay for colored motion
pictures of this season's coordi
nated halftimes. The Commit
tee's plans include showings at
the Sunday evening flicks.
In carry - over business, t lie
group will undoubtedly return
both tlie Stanford Press Club and
the Interfraternity Council con
stitutions for second readings and
probable approval.
Two Appointments
Two appointments, to the
chairmanship of Elections Com
mission and the Chamber of
Commerce, will also be made.
It is also expected that legisla
tive study committees will be
established to investigate the op
erations and potentials of the
Public Relations Board and the
Political Union.
Also, three new constitutions
will be submitted to the group
for eventual approval. They will
come from the Hostess Commis
sion and the Texas and Rifle
clubs.
