# Socialists Desire Capitalism Debate
## 
### 
Stating Ihat "capitalism cannot
endure indefinitely," the Socialist
Caucus of the Political Union has
issued a challenge to any student
or faculty member wishing to de
fend capitalism publicly.
The statement, issued by Chair
man George Guy, is directed to
campus political associations and
to any individual "who feels him
self capable of articulating a
plausible defense of capitalism."
The Socialists also are willing
to debate any campus Commu
nists on the merits of socialism
vs. communism.
Anyone wishing to accept the
challenge should write the Politi
cal Union. Socialist Caucus, AS

after 6 p.m.
