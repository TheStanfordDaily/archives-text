At the beginning of the steel
strike in July, the President de
clared that he would not inter
vene because "I believe that we
have got thoroughly to test out
and use the method of free bar
gaining."
When Mr. K. arrived here
two months later, one of the
things the President wanted to
have him see was the steel
strike. It would show the visi
tor an example of free bargain
ing between unions and man
agement.
Now three weeks later he has
set in motion the machinery of
the Taft-Hartley Act, and every
one is hoping that board of in
quiry under the Act will somehow
succeed in avoiding the need to
invoke the Act, and that it will
somehow be able to mediate a
settlement. If the board does not
succeed, the steel strike will be
suspended for eighty days and
then may be resumed at the on
set of winter.
It is a dreary outcome for what
was to have been a test of "the
method of free bargaining." The
test has gone on since July, and
the method of free bargaining
has failed in the task.
Why did it? It failed because
the issues of the steel strike
were not ones to which the
method of free bargaining ap
plies. The President did not
understand the nature of the
steel strike. He failed to see
that the issues were not those
which collective bargaining can
resolve.
On the side of labor the ulti
mate issue is its right to share in
the larger profits of the compa
nies. On the side of management
the ultimate issue is to put a stop
to the spiral of wage increases
since the Second World War and
to recover some of the ground
lost to labor since that time.
Here then is a case of indus
trial warfare between giant busi
ness and giant labor. It is a test
of power and of will in which the

two parties are not bargaining
and will not compromise their
differences.
When the President chose to
regard the steel strike as one
which could bo settled by "free
bargaining," there was not in
volved a true principle based on
the reality of things but a senti
mental illusion.
Nor was it a feature of Amer
ican life which we could show
oil' proudly to Mr. I\. On the
contrary, the steel strike is a
spectacular example of the fact
that, far from being a com
pleted and perfected society,
there is in our society much
that is primitive, irrational, and
increasingly intolerable.
It is not a jolly thing 1o have
the basic industry of the country
close down for three months with
no settlement in sight just be
cause we have not learned how
to substitute law and order for
unconditional industrial warfare.
The claim that a strike of these
dimensions and of such conse
quences is a private affair, not a
proper subject of national inter
vention, is entirely untenable. It
was untenable in July when the
Administ rat ion approved the
claim that this was a private af
fair and it is untenable in Octo
ber when the Administration has
had to intervene.
The national interest is not
only that a settlement should
be reached and production re
sinned. There is a prime na
tional interest in the terms on
which the strike is settled. The
day is past when this country
can tolerate "free" bargaining
by which labor gets higher
wages and management puts
up the prices.
The national interest demands
that the major industrial conflicts
be settled under conditions which
are good for the economy as a
whole. That being the case, some
agency has to have the authority
to speak for the national interest
when a conflict arises.
