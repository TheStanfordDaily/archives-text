# One Opinion
## STEVE BAFFREY

The time for the annual fall
trok to tlie Southland is almost
upon us, and I count the days un
til the migration begins.
To some among us, studies
override all pleasure and time
is more than of the essence and
premium. Still, not being that
devoted, I take time out in this
busy world for the trip.
That is, I will take time out if
a ride shows up.
Primary function of the week
end, of course, is the football
game. And I firmly believe every
one who goes South for it, should
make it to the Coliseum. This is
something which doesn't always
happen.
But surrounding the big tussle
are a number of events which I
also feel are don't-miss affairs.
These start about Thursday night,
but most of us don't make the
scene until Friday, so we'll start
there.
The Stanford Club of Los An
geles throws its big pre-game
affair back in Pasadena this
year. The alumni rally is set
for the Huntington-Sheraton
Hotel on Friday night. And it
gets going at about . . . well,
whenever enough people con
gregate to get going.
The L.A. Club has sent a re
minder north to the effect that
we're all welcome to enjoy cock
tails with the older folks, only
ID's are required.
Also on Friday night the USC
campus should hop with some
sort of festivity, though no word
has filtered up yet. Still, you can
bet your bottom dollar that a
short drive along the Trojan row
will turn up some jolly time.
Party crashing isn't always
fun, hut it is most of the time
down South.
Private parties? Of course
there will be some, and they're
only private as long as you don't

hear about them. Once the word
drifts out, no matter how it does.
I consider a party open, and I'm
sure you'll want to, too.
Then, of course, there's Satur
day night and that's always time
for a party. Only this year even
more so (Prediction: Stanford 20,
SC 14). And if you want to start
on the rounds right after the
game then head to the main ball
room of the Bill more.
The Stanford .Junior Alumni
of L.A. host a no-lioster there
until about 10 that night, which
of course still leaves time for
more.
Again, try the Southern Cal
row; you should find something.
Also, keep an ear open for news
or invites of other functions, and
if you get washed out, remember
there's always a night spot.
Like the Coconut Grove, Mou
lin Rouge, etc. . . .
Just one bit of friendly advice:
If you live down South, and will
be staying at home, remember to
budget enough time with the
folks so that they really believe
they aren't running a motel.
SHORT SHORTS: Over two
and a-quarter thousand musicians
file into Stanford Stadium for
Saturday's Fifth Annual High
School Band Day ... an amusing
and entertaining spectacle . . .
The Stanford Band will preview
a "Festivals and Holidays" half
time down South which will look
great with card stunts added the
next week up here ... I don't
consider paving roads as a simple
operation of laying tar on exist
ing ruts ... It seems LSJU does
. . . Legislature tonight gets a re
quest to appropriate money for
color films of this year's fancy
halftimes so they can be shown
at the Sunday night flicks . . .
You've all done a good job here;
I'm bucking to see that you get
to see 'em.
