## 
### 
ASSU scholar, Mohammed Ku
mati, from Beirut, Lebanon, ex
pressed his first impressions of
the United States and of Stan
ford life with unusual thought
fillness in a Daily interview Mon
day.
A resident at the Delt house
this quarter, Kumati is continu
ing his studies in economics,
which he began at the American
University in Beirut. He has also
done extensive work in philoso
phy at Makassed College, and
was assistant editor of the daily
newspaper there.
Admiring Stanford's liberal ed
ucation program in general, Ku
mati was particularly impressed
by the dignity and objectivity of
the student legisltaure, which he
addressed last Thursday.
Americans are well qualified in
the social science, Kumati said.
You ought to continue your "ex
ploration of the human universe,"
and base your response to the
challenges which now face your
nation on these terms.
Kumati plans to return to Leb
anon next year, where he will
teach for a few years before com
pleting his doctoral thesis in the
history of economic theory.
