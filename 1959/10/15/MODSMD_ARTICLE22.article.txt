Remember Mrs. R.
Editor, The Daily:
How callous, how forgetful we
oft become!
Recently Mrs. Eleanor Roose
velt celebrated her 75th birthday,
and this event went all but un
noticed at Stanford. Soon she
will turn her toes up to the dai
sies and be heard no more. Let
us, therefore, not forget how she
brought us world peace.
Even cold Andre Vishinsky
melted when she persuaded him
to assist her in a declaration of
human rights. During the worst
of the Hungarian Revolt, it was
she who spoke for the world
when she suggested we set up
soup kitchens for the refugees.
A staunch foe of communism,
she nevertheless thinks that the
Communists are good men at
heart.
Demonstrating once more that
Eleanor Roosevelt can never be
out of style, she appeared on tele
vision with the touching appeal
that shall live in history: "Isn't
it a shame that there are so many
poor starving people in the world.
We in America are so fortunate
that we have so much good food
to eat good food like Good Luck
Margarine."

The Torn Fence
Editor, The Daily:
Your editorial of Oct. 14 has me
wondering if you know what you
are talking aboutâ€”at all. Did
you know, for example, that if
one stays within the legal speed
limits on campus, il is pretty hard
to bieak automobile suspension
springs ?
That the only reason you can
get on Willow Road from Sears
ville Road at all is because stu
dents tear down the fence at the
west end of Searsville Road and
drive over private property?
(You should be ashamed of your
selves. )
That Escondido Road at Stan

ford Avenue was repaved at the I
beginning of this last summer
and was one of the best roads on
the campus? That the only rea
son'it is in the shape it is now is
that our junior hot rodders use
it for a speedway and come
screeching to a hall at Stanford
Avenue? For some si range rea
son this produces moguls in the
road . . .
Where stop signs are con
cerned, I'll admit you have a
point, but not much of one. You j
obviously didn't know (since il i
appears only on the California 1
Vehicle Code) that it takes both a
sign and a limit line ... to make I
a legally enforceable stop.

Therefore, you may whiz (if
you can do that at 20 mph)
through the intersection of Las
uen and Campus Drive. But, of
course, you must exercise due
caution for cross traffic and pe
destrians which have the right of
way. Maybe it would be a little
betler to stop anyway even if you
don't have to.
If you must pick on a stop sign,
why not take the one on Salva
tierra on the north side of Cam
pus Drive? That one is there to
keep traffic which is going the
wrong way on a one way street
from flying out onto Campus
Drive . . .
