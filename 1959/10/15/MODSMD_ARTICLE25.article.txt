Odd as it may soom tho next two weeks of football will bo the hip;
deciding factors in the selection of this year's All-American teams.
In order for the nation's periodicals and news services to have their
lists compiled and ready to put before the public during the last
weeks in November, they have to make their picks somewhere be
tween the sixth and seventh week of the season.
Despite a rather weak showing in iho passing department last
week at Seattle, Stanford's Dick Norman and Chris Burford still rank
high on the list of contenders for berths on the coveted football all
star team.
Just what kind of a chance the two Indian stars really have is a
fairly uncertain question, but a quick glance at the situation around

the country and tho records of
the two players could give some
indication.
Daily sportswriter Bub Payne
in a column last year outlined
what he thought were four pre
requisites for - any West Coast
player aspiring for All-American
recognition. Tlve first of these
necessities is a good press agent;
the second is to play on a win
ning football team but one that
has only a minimum of great All-
American prospects; the third
was to play your best football the
first six games of the season; and
the last was to play a bang-up
game in the East or iho Midwest.
Looking at tho records of Nor
man and Burford in the light of
these suggestions makes it ap
pear as though tho Stanfordites
may have a pretty rough time
getting any mention on Ail-Amer
ican first teams.
The press agent bit is hard to
analyze. Norman and Bur ford
have golten their share of pub-

lieily out hero on tho Pacific Const but it's fairly probable that there
aren't too many on the East Coast that have heard much about the
pair. Fortunately, Stanford's offense is so geared to the air attack
that the two have paced the nation all season in offensive depart
ments and thereby have gotten nationwide publicity each week with
the releasing of the NCAA statistics.

Ail-American?
Odd as it may soom tho next two weeks of football will bo the hip;
deciding factors in the selection of this year's All-American teams.
In order for the nation's periodicals and news services to have their
lists compiled and ready to put before the public during the last
weeks in November, they have to make their picks somewhere be
tween the sixth and seventh week of the season.
Despite a rather weak showing in iho passing department last
week at Seattle, Stanford's Dick Norman and Chris Burford still rank
high on the list of contenders for berths on the coveted football all
star team.
Just what kind of a chance the two Indian stars really have is a
fairly uncertain question, but a quick glance at the situation around

the country and tho records of
the two players could give some
indication.
Daily sportswriter Bub Payne
in a column last year outlined
what he thought were four pre
requisites for - any West Coast
player aspiring for All-American
recognition. Tlve first of these
necessities is a good press agent;
the second is to play on a win
ning football team but one that
has only a minimum of great All-
American prospects; the third
was to play your best football the
first six games of the season; and
the last was to play a bang-up
game in the East or iho Midwest.
Looking at tho records of Nor
man and Burford in the light of
these suggestions makes it ap
pear as though tho Stanfordites
may have a pretty rough time
getting any mention on Ail-Amer
ican first teams.
The press agent bit is hard to
analyze. Norman and Bur ford
have golten their share of pub-

lieily out hero on tho Pacific Const but it's fairly probable that there
aren't too many on the East Coast that have heard much about the
pair. Fortunately, Stanford's offense is so geared to the air attack
that the two have paced the nation all season in offensive depart
ments and thereby have gotten nationwide publicity each week with
the releasing of the NCAA statistics.
