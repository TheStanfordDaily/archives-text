# A 						Minus Sign
## 
### 
Stanford's record this year certainly gives the pair a minus sign
on the second prerequisite. Although the games have been close
Stanford has still failed to add much prestige to its players with its
record so far.
As another added hazard Norman and Bnrford have one another
to contend with. As a passing combination the two Card gridders
are tops; however, when incomes time to vote most of the selectors
will be reluctant to vote for two players from tlie same school, so
they will have to decide between the two.
With the exception of last week's nightmare in Seattle both Bur
lord and Norman have gotten off to a fast start in the first four
games of the season. Norman has been the nation's leader in total
olfense and passing from the first week of the season. Bnrford has
been up on top of the nation's receiving chart with the same con
sistency.
A few of Norman's big rivals for both All-American and statistical
honors have fallen by the wayside with miserable opening perform
ances or injuries.
Northwestern quarterback Dick Thornton had the misfortune
of cracking his ankle in the second game of the season, putting him
out of contention. Dale Hackhart, Wisconsin's ace signal caller, after
having knee trouble, has not been able to produce as expected.
Don Meredith, SMU's quarterback, has had trouble connecting
with his receivers this year. He failed to make the top ten list in
passing the opening two weeks in the season.
