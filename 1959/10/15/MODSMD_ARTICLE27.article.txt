# Top Contenders
## 
### 
Norman's top contenders right now appear to bo Richie Lucas,
IVnn State's ace, and Gale Weidner, Colorado's quarterback. With
IViin Stat<* undefeated, Lucas appears to be Ihe biggest threat.
Burford at end cannot depend so much on statistics to help him
out. Last year the tough Stanford end ended up second in the na
tion's pass-receiving charts but only got honorable mention in All-
America polls.
At end publicity seems to play a bigger role. Curt Merz of lowa
and Al Goldstein of North Carolina are the big pre-season favorites
and they are yet to make the receiving list this year.
One thing working in favor of Norman especially, and also Bur
lord, is 1 ho fine performance that was put on in .Madison, Wisconsin,
by the Indians. Norman had his most sensational afternoon of pass
ing and impressed the Midwestern writers immensely. Bul'ord, de
spite a case of fumbleitis (he fumbled twice), caught a 54-yard touch
down pass and did a fine all-around .job against Wisconsin.
