# Minor Injuries, Aches Plague Card Gridders
## 
### 
Minor aches and pains plague I
the Stanford football team as it !
reaches iho midway point of the
1959 season in Saturday's clash
with Washington State.
Latest on the injury list for the |
Indians in fullback Rick McMil- I
len, who suffered a shoulder j
pointer late in practice Tuesday |
night. McMillen, hampered by ;
injuries all through his varsity
career, had been elevated to the
first unit in place of Skip Face
and will be ready Saturday.
Sophomore guard star Tom
Walsh and veteian center Doug
Purse! 1 are both on the "doubt
ful" list for Saturday's game,
but expect to see action. Pursell
was sidelined last week by a neck
injury and did not make the trip
1o the Washington game; Walsh
suffered a sprained ankle against
the Huskies.
Fernandes in Top Shape
The possible loss of Walsh,
however, has been offset by the
return to action of junior Ron
Fernandes, reported hack in top
shape. Fernandes, still looking
for his first full injury-free sea
son as a collegiate gridder, was
injured in iho season opener with
Oregon. Walsh took over when
Fernandes was injured and has
been one of the pleasant sur
prises of the Card line.
Only Hal Steuber, sophomore
halfback, is definitely out of the
Cougar game and may be side
lined for at least two more weeks.
Steuber wrenched his knee
against Washington.
On tho credit side of the ledger,
starling ends Chris Burford and
Ben Robinson appear in lop shape
and ready for lull time duty Sat
urday. Both were partially hob
bled last week but were forced
to go most of the way.
Burford, with 19 receptions,
and Robinson, with IG, currently
rank first and second among the
nation's pass receivers.
Warm Weather Seen
A week of summer-like wea
ther appears likely to as
sure the Tribe of a dry ball and
dry field in contrast to last
week's drippy weather in Seattle.
The Indians, who were quite
sensational in the mud and rain
at Madison, Wis., three weeks
ago. had a miserable day in tho
drizzle last week. Quarterback
Dick Norman went into the game
with a substantial national lead
in total offense and came out this
week with a slim one-yard mar
gin.
"But it wasn't just Norman,"
cautioned coach Jack Curtice.
"On three of his four intercep
tions, the ball slithered off the
receivers' hands into Washing
ton's hands."
With Steuber out and McMillen
on tho "maybe" list, the Injuns'
may have to rely on their passing
game even more than usual this
week.

nation's pass receivers.
Warm Weather Seen
A week of summer-like wea
ther appears likely to as
sure the Tribe of a dry ball and
dry field in contrast to last
week's drippy weather in Seattle.
The Indians, who were quite
sensational in the mud and rain
at Madison, Wis., three weeks
ago. had a miserable day in tho
drizzle last week. Quarterback
Dick Norman went into the game
with a substantial national lead
in total offense and came out this
week with a slim one-yard mar
gin.
"But it wasn't just Norman,"
cautioned coach Jack Curtice.
"On three of his four intercep
tions, the ball slithered off the
receivers' hands into Washing
ton's hands."
With Steuber out and McMillen
on tho "maybe" list, the Injuns'
may have to rely on their passing
game even more than usual this
week.
Minor aches and pains plague I
the Stanford football team as it !
reaches iho midway point of the
1959 season in Saturday's clash
with Washington State.
Latest on the injury list for the |
Indians in fullback Rick McMil- I
len, who suffered a shoulder j
pointer late in practice Tuesday |
night. McMillen, hampered by ;
injuries all through his varsity
career, had been elevated to the
first unit in place of Skip Face
and will be ready Saturday.
Sophomore guard star Tom
Walsh and veteian center Doug
Purse! 1 are both on the "doubt
ful" list for Saturday's game,
but expect to see action. Pursell
was sidelined last week by a neck
injury and did not make the trip
1o the Washington game; Walsh
suffered a sprained ankle against
the Huskies.
Fernandes in Top Shape
The possible loss of Walsh,
however, has been offset by the
return to action of junior Ron
Fernandes, reported hack in top
shape. Fernandes, still looking
for his first full injury-free sea
son as a collegiate gridder, was
injured in iho season opener with
Oregon. Walsh took over when
Fernandes was injured and has
been one of the pleasant sur
prises of the Card line.
Only Hal Steuber, sophomore
halfback, is definitely out of the
Cougar game and may be side
lined for at least two more weeks.
Steuber wrenched his knee
against Washington.
On tho credit side of the ledger,
starling ends Chris Burford and
Ben Robinson appear in lop shape
and ready for lull time duty Sat
urday. Both were partially hob
bled last week but were forced
to go most of the way.
Burford, with 19 receptions,
and Robinson, with IG, currently
rank first and second among the
nation's pass receivers.
