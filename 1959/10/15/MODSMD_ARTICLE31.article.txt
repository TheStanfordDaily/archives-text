## 
###

out just how much a bad Satur
day can hurt in the NCAA na
tional total offense race. A week
ago sure-throwing Dick was over
100 yards ahead of his nearest
competitor; after completing only
four passes out of 21 attempts

for a sub-par game total of 03
yards, the Indian quarterback fin
ished this week just one yard
ahead of Colorado sophomore
Gale We id nor.
Norman also held onto his pass
completion lead, but Pete Hall of
Marquette had moved within four
of Dick's .~)2 total.
Pervis Atkins, last week's rush
ing leader, had his troubles when
ho collected 61 yards, well under
his previous average. The New
Mexico State halfback has now
gained 547 yards on the ground,
comfortably ahead of North Tex
as State's r unne ru p A liner
Haynes who has 378 yards in four
games.
The decline of offensive stars
is part of the indication of
stronger defenses of leading
teams. Mississippi has not al
lowed a point in four games.
LSU, South Carolina, Purdue,
Texas and Air Force have all al
lowed an average of less than five
points per game to their oppo
nents.
