VV H I T E SANDS MISSILE
RANGE, N.M. </P)—A Nike-Zeus
missile designed to kill ICBMs
made its maiden test flight
Wednesday across (he southern
New Mexico desert.
Army spokesmen termed the
test a success, although the mis
sile fell short of its goal because
of an apparent failure during the
coasting phase of the missile's
flight.
Both stages of the powerful
missile fired, and information of
flight and propulsion characteris
tics were telemetered to the 1
ground.
Nike-Zeus is the Army's top
secret answer it hopes—to in
tercontinental ballistic missiles.
It carries a hydrogen warhead on
top of what the Army bills as
"the most powerful known single
unit propellant rocket motor ever
fired."
It is designed to head off
ICBMs while they are still in the
stratosphere en route from en
emy bases, and to destroy them
with a fusion explosion.
