# 'Simplicity Is Key to Design' Says Architect
## 
### Jerry Isenberg 
Felix Candella, one of Mexico's
foremost architects and a top
flight engineer, told his audience
in the Physics Lecture Hall yes
terday that "Architecture should
be most . . . very simple."
"All architects play the game
of trying to find something new,
he continued, "and this can lead
to some pretty outlandish con
struction."
Sponsored by the Departments
of Architecture and Engineering,
Candella's talk covered his prin
ciples of design and construction,
which he illustrated with slides
of some of his buildings.
Candella went on to say that
he uses the same geometric fig
ure, the hyperbolic paraboloid, as
the basis for nearly all his con
struction. The configuration,
which resembles a saddle, has the
advantage of allowing the engi
neer to eliminate curved support
ing members in his construction.
A specialist in the construction
of thin-walled cement buildings,
Candella, in partnership with
other members of his family,
builds factories and warehouses
"to earn a living."
It is in his churches that his
style of sweeping lines and ab
sence of interior supports is most
evident. Reliance for support is
chiefly on cantilevers and light
weight construction.
Candella told his appreciative
audience he intended to continue
his present style of construction.
"It's the only thing 1 know how
to do," he said with a smile.
