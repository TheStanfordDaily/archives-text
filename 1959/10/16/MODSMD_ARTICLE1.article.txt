Washington State a caged
Cougar all season comes to the
Stadium tomorrow to meet a
Stanford team that was pretty
well shackled itself last week. To
say the least, ii should be an in
teresting, unpredictable after
noon.
The game is the fifth annual
high school band day. The foot
ball starts at 2 p.m.
For coach Jim Sutherland and
the Cougars, it has already been
a disappointing season. YVSU had
hopes of finally making it to the
Hose Bowl this year (a trip
missed by one-half game last sea

about all that is left of the Pa

the Cougars are 0-2, having
lost to California and Oregon.

was optimistically hoped to have
been WSU's best team in years.

ones, run well around the ends
and up the middle. But never

Cal on even terms for three
quarters before finally submit
ting to 92 and 50-yard runs in Ihe
fourth period. They twice put to
gether handsome drives that got
them inside Oregon's ten-yard
line, and then couldn't push over
a score.
In the Cougars' two wins the
offense sputtered most of the
way. Striking fast against San
Jose State, they bogged down for
two quarters and only a couple
of waning-minute touchdowns
marie it a 30-6 game. At College
of the Pacific last week, WSU
scored twice in the first quarter,
once early in the second and then
hung on for a 20-12 win.
Stanford's offense has sparkled
all season, until last week. Then,
