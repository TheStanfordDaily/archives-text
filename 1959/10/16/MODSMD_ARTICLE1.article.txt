# Card Gridders Host Cougars

### Bob Payne 
Washington State a caged
Cougar all season comes to the
Stadium tomorrow to meet a
Stanford team that was pretty
well shackled itself last week. To
say the least, ii should be an in
teresting, unpredictable after
noon.
The game is the fifth annual
high school band day. The foot
ball starts at 2 p.m.
For coach Jim Sutherland and
the Cougars, it has already been
a disappointing season. YVSU had
hopes of finally making it to the
Hose Bowl this year (a trip
missed by one-half game last sea
son). If the Cougars still have a
chance for the Roses, it is a slim
one. In the race for Pasadena
about all that is left of the Pa
cifif Coast conference nowadays
the Cougars are 0-2, having
lost to California and Oregon.
A misfiring offense, and a pe
riodically leaky defense have just
about ruined the season for what
was optimistically hoped to have
been WSU's best team in years.
Offensive Might
Surely, the Cougs have gone
through the motions of offensive
might. They've completed sensa
tional long pass plays and short
ones, run well around the ends
and up the middle. But never
quite often enough. They played
Cal on even terms for three
quarters before finally submit
ting to 92 and 50-yard runs in Ihe
fourth period. They twice put to
gether handsome drives that got
them inside Oregon's ten-yard
line, and then couldn't push over
a score.
In the Cougars' two wins the
offense sputtered most of the
way. Striking fast against San
Jose State, they bogged down for
two quarters and only a couple
of waning-minute touchdowns
marie it a 30-6 game. At College
of the Pacific last week, WSU
scored twice in the first quarter,
once early in the second and then
hung on for a 20-12 win.
Stanford's offense has sparkled
all season, until last week. Then,
the Tribe ran into a revitalized
Washington eleven that put the
damps on what had been one of
the nation's most sensational air
arms.
Stern Defense?
Everybody will be trying to un
track tomorrow.
The WSU defense as well. One
of the sternest on the Coast at
the end of last season, it has been
letting down at the most inoppor
tune moments this season. Last
week, COP, heretofore no great
shakes as a passing team, riddled
the Cougar secondary for 358
yards.
Stanford will go into action
without starting center Doug
Pursell or sophomore guard Tom
Walsh, coach Jack Curtice dis
closed yesterday. Pursell also
missed last week's Washington
game with a neck injury. Walsh
injured his ankle in the Husky
game.
Back in the lineup at top speed
will be veteran Ron Fernandes,
the man whose spot Walsh had
been so ably filling. Fernandes
was hurt in the opener with Ore
gon. Rick McMilJen, hurt in prac
tice this week, should be ready.
Ktenber Out
Sophomore halfback Hal Steu
ber is definitely out, possibly for
two more weeks, with a wrenched
knee.
Washington State's injury sit
uation is somewhat the same.
First string fullback Ted Cano is

out for the season with a broken j
leg. Reserve linemen Roger Du
prel and Walt Altobelli reportedly
will not be making the trip.
Lack of the big "home run" I
pass such as the ones that killed
Stanford here two years ago has i
been the biggest trouble with the
WSU attack. Quarterback Mike
Agee and Me] Melin have not
proved to be of the same passing
mold as Bob Newman, or 1 even
Newman's understudies.
Outstanding Receivers
But Agep and Melin have con
nected frequently and the pres
ence of a fleet of outstanding re
ceivers still make WSU a dan
gerous passing threat.
Senior Gail Cogdill, one of the |
swiftest wingmen in the.nation,
is enough to give any coach tho j
v\illies. Cogdill has caught 13
passes this season for 273 yardsj
and while his reception total is I
ninth in the nation, his yardage
figure is second.
Last yea.' Cogdill set an NCAA
single game record when he j
caught seven passes against j
Northwestern for 252 yards.
Stanford felt his sting, too. He !
scored on a 72-yarder in WSU's
•10-G rout of Ihe far-from-ready
Tribe in last year's opener.
Defensive Stars
Slot back Don Ellersick, flank
ers Don Johnston and Pete

Schenck and ends Ed Shaw and
Laßoy Rath, top defensive stars,
add more targets. And the left
tackles are eligible about half the
time in Sutherland's new unbal
anced line offense.
The development of a solid
ground game, with Keith Lincoln,
George Reed and Perry Harper
doing most of the running, has
helped offset the inconsistency of
the passing attack. The versatile
Lincoln is one of the Coast's top
all-around backs.
Reed and Harper, both sopho
mores, have been pleasant sur
prises. Reed will be starting in
Cano's spot at fullback. Sprint
star Harper blossomed last week
at COP, gaining SI yards in
eight carries.
All-Const Center
Senior center Marv Nelson, an
all-coast first teamer last year,
anchors the forward wall. There
is considerable beef up front in
Ron Green (23.")), Dick Farrar
(227),« Jim Greig (202) Myke
Lindsay (210). And then there
is Bill Berry.
Berry, at 5-7 and 160 pounds,
is possibly the smallest starting
lineman in major collegiate
ranks. Needless to say, he's fast
and has performed well enough to
have been in the starting lineup
ever since the middle of last sea
son.
It will be a couple of teams
trying to break loose "like they
know they can." If they both do
at once, it coidd be quite a sight.

been WSU's best team in years.
Offensive Might
Surely, the Cougs have gone
through the motions of offensive
might. They've completed sensa
tional long pass plays and short
ones, run well around the ends
and up the middle. But never
quite often enough. They played
Cal on even terms for three
quarters before finally submit
ting to 92 and 50-yard runs in Ihe
fourth period. They twice put to
gether handsome drives that got
them inside Oregon's ten-yard
line, and then couldn't push over
a score.
In the Cougars' two wins the
offense sputtered most of the
way. Striking fast against San
Jose State, they bogged down for
two quarters and only a couple
of waning-minute touchdowns
marie it a 30-6 game. At College
of the Pacific last week, WSU
scored twice in the first quarter,
once early in the second and then
hung on for a 20-12 win.
Stanford's offense has sparkled
all season, until last week. Then,
the Tribe ran into a revitalized
Washington eleven that put the
damps on what had been one of
the nation's most sensational air
arms.
Stern Defense?
Everybody will be trying to un
track tomorrow.
The WSU defense as well. One
of the sternest on the Coast at
the end of last season, it has been
letting down at the most inoppor
tune moments this season. Last
week, COP, heretofore no great
shakes as a passing team, riddled
the Cougar secondary for 358
yards.
Stanford will go into action
without starting center Doug
Pursell or sophomore guard Tom
Walsh, coach Jack Curtice dis
closed yesterday. Pursell also
missed last week's Washington
game with a neck injury. Walsh
injured his ankle in the Husky
game.
Back in the lineup at top speed
will be veteran Ron Fernandes,
the man whose spot Walsh had
been so ably filling. Fernandes
was hurt in the opener with Ore
gon. Rick McMilJen, hurt in prac
tice this week, should be ready.
Ktenber Out
Sophomore halfback Hal Steu
ber is definitely out, possibly for
two more weeks, with a wrenched
knee.
Washington State's injury sit
uation is somewhat the same.
First string fullback Ted Cano is

out for the season with a broken j
leg. Reserve linemen Roger Du
prel and Walt Altobelli reportedly
will not be making the trip.
Lack of the big "home run" I
pass such as the ones that killed
Stanford here two years ago has i
been the biggest trouble with the
WSU attack. Quarterback Mike
Agee and Me] Melin have not
proved to be of the same passing
mold as Bob Newman, or 1 even
Newman's understudies.
Outstanding Receivers
But Agep and Melin have con
nected frequently and the pres
ence of a fleet of outstanding re
ceivers still make WSU a dan
gerous passing threat.
Senior Gail Cogdill, one of the |
swiftest wingmen in the.nation,
is enough to give any coach tho j
v\illies. Cogdill has caught 13
passes this season for 273 yardsj
and while his reception total is I
ninth in the nation, his yardage
figure is second.
Last yea.' Cogdill set an NCAA
single game record when he j
caught seven passes against j
Northwestern for 252 yards.
Stanford felt his sting, too. He !
scored on a 72-yarder in WSU's
•10-G rout of Ihe far-from-ready
Tribe in last year's opener.
Defensive Stars
Slot back Don Ellersick, flank
ers Don Johnston and Pete

Schenck and ends Ed Shaw and
Laßoy Rath, top defensive stars,
add more targets. And the left
tackles are eligible about half the
time in Sutherland's new unbal
anced line offense.
The development of a solid
ground game, with Keith Lincoln,
George Reed and Perry Harper
doing most of the running, has
helped offset the inconsistency of
the passing attack. The versatile
Lincoln is one of the Coast's top
all-around backs.
Reed and Harper, both sopho
mores, have been pleasant sur
prises. Reed will be starting in
Cano's spot at fullback. Sprint
star Harper blossomed last week
at COP, gaining SI yards in
eight carries.
All-Const Center
Senior center Marv Nelson, an
all-coast first teamer last year,
anchors the forward wall. There
is considerable beef up front in
Ron Green (23.")), Dick Farrar
(227),« Jim Greig (202) Myke
Lindsay (210). And then there
is Bill Berry.
Berry, at 5-7 and 160 pounds,
is possibly the smallest starting
lineman in major collegiate
ranks. Needless to say, he's fast
and has performed well enough to
have been in the starting lineup
ever since the middle of last sea
son.
It will be a couple of teams
trying to break loose "like they
know they can." If they both do
at once, it coidd be quite a sight.
Washington State a caged
Cougar all season comes to the
Stadium tomorrow to meet a
Stanford team that was pretty
well shackled itself last week. To
say the least, ii should be an in
teresting, unpredictable after
noon.
The game is the fifth annual
high school band day. The foot
ball starts at 2 p.m.
For coach Jim Sutherland and
the Cougars, it has already been
a disappointing season. YVSU had
hopes of finally making it to the
Hose Bowl this year (a trip
missed by one-half game last sea
son). If the Cougars still have a
chance for the Roses, it is a slim
one. In the race for Pasadena
about all that is left of the Pa

the Cougars are 0-2, having

Stanford's offense has sparkled
all season, until last week. Then,
the Tribe ran into a revitalized
Washington eleven that put the
damps on what had been one of
the nation's most sensational air
arms.
Stern Defense?
Everybody will be trying to un
track tomorrow.
The WSU defense as well. One
of the sternest on the Coast at
the end of last season, it has been
letting down at the most inoppor
tune moments this season. Last
week, COP, heretofore no great
shakes as a passing team, riddled
the Cougar secondary for 358
yards.
Stanford will go into action
without starting center Doug
Pursell or sophomore guard Tom
Walsh, coach Jack Curtice dis
closed yesterday. Pursell also
missed last week's Washington
game with a neck injury. Walsh
injured his ankle in the Husky
game.
Back in the lineup at top speed
will be veteran Ron Fernandes,
the man whose spot Walsh had
been so ably filling. Fernandes
was hurt in the opener with Ore
gon. Rick McMilJen, hurt in prac
tice this week, should be ready.
Ktenber Out
Sophomore halfback Hal Steu
ber is definitely out, possibly for
two more weeks, with a wrenched
knee.
Washington State's injury sit
uation is somewhat the same.
First string fullback Ted Cano is

out for the season with a broken j
leg. Reserve linemen Roger Du
prel and Walt Altobelli reportedly
will not be making the trip.
Lack of the big "home run" I
pass such as the ones that killed
Stanford here two years ago has i
been the biggest trouble with the
WSU attack. Quarterback Mike
Agee and Me] Melin have not
proved to be of the same passing
mold as Bob Newman, or 1 even
Newman's understudies.
Outstanding Receivers
But Agep and Melin have con
nected frequently and the pres
ence of a fleet of outstanding re
ceivers still make WSU a dan
gerous passing threat.
Senior Gail Cogdill, one of the |
swiftest wingmen in the.nation,
is enough to give any coach tho j
v\illies. Cogdill has caught 13
passes this season for 273 yardsj
and while his reception total is I
ninth in the nation, his yardage
figure is second.
Last yea.' Cogdill set an NCAA
single game record when he j
caught seven passes against j
Northwestern for 252 yards.
Stanford felt his sting, too. He !
scored on a 72-yarder in WSU's
•10-G rout of Ihe far-from-ready
Tribe in last year's opener.
Defensive Stars
Slot back Don Ellersick, flank
ers Don Johnston and Pete

Schenck and ends Ed Shaw and
Laßoy Rath, top defensive stars,
add more targets. And the left
tackles are eligible about half the
time in Sutherland's new unbal
anced line offense.
The development of a solid
ground game, with Keith Lincoln,
George Reed and Perry Harper
doing most of the running, has
helped offset the inconsistency of
the passing attack. The versatile
Lincoln is one of the Coast's top
all-around backs.
Reed and Harper, both sopho
mores, have been pleasant sur
prises. Reed will be starting in
Cano's spot at fullback. Sprint
star Harper blossomed last week
at COP, gaining SI yards in
eight carries.
All-Const Center
Senior center Marv Nelson, an
all-coast first teamer last year,
anchors the forward wall. There
is considerable beef up front in
Ron Green (23.")), Dick Farrar
(227),« Jim Greig (202) Myke
Lindsay (210). And then there
is Bill Berry.
Berry, at 5-7 and 160 pounds,
is possibly the smallest starting
lineman in major collegiate
ranks. Needless to say, he's fast
and has performed well enough to
have been in the starting lineup
ever since the middle of last sea
son.
It will be a couple of teams
trying to break loose "like they
know they can." If they both do
at once, it coidd be quite a sight.
Washington State a caged
Cougar all season comes to the
Stadium tomorrow to meet a
Stanford team that was pretty
well shackled itself last week. To
say the least, ii should be an in
teresting, unpredictable after
noon.
The game is the fifth annual
high school band day. The foot
ball starts at 2 p.m.
For coach Jim Sutherland and
the Cougars, it has already been
a disappointing season. YVSU had
hopes of finally making it to the
Hose Bowl this year (a trip
missed by one-half game last sea
son). If the Cougars still have a
chance for the Roses, it is a slim
one. In the race for Pasadena
about all that is left of the Pa
cifif Coast conference nowadays
the Cougars are 0-2, having
lost to California and Oregon.
A misfiring offense, and a pe
riodically leaky defense have just
about ruined the season for what
was optimistically hoped to have
been WSU's best team in years.
Offensive Might
Surely, the Cougs have gone
through the motions of offensive
might. They've completed sensa
tional long pass plays and short
ones, run well around the ends
and up the middle. But never
quite often enough. They played
Cal on even terms for three
quarters before finally submit
ting to 92 and 50-yard runs in Ihe
fourth period. They twice put to
gether handsome drives that got
them inside Oregon's ten-yard
line, and then couldn't push over
a score.
In the Cougars' two wins the
offense sputtered most of the
way. Striking fast against San
Jose State, they bogged down for
two quarters and only a couple
of waning-minute touchdowns
marie it a 30-6 game. At College
of the Pacific last week, WSU
scored twice in the first quarter,
once early in the second and then
hung on for a 20-12 win.

the man whose spot Walsh had
been so ably filling. Fernandes
was hurt in the opener with Ore
gon. Rick McMilJen, hurt in prac
tice this week, should be ready.
Ktenber Out
Sophomore halfback Hal Steu
ber is definitely out, possibly for
two more weeks, with a wrenched
knee.
Washington State's injury sit
uation is somewhat the same.
First string fullback Ted Cano is

out for the season with a broken j
leg. Reserve linemen Roger Du
prel and Walt Altobelli reportedly
will not be making the trip.
Lack of the big "home run" I
pass such as the ones that killed
Stanford here two years ago has i
been the biggest trouble with the
WSU attack. Quarterback Mike
Agee and Me] Melin have not
proved to be of the same passing
mold as Bob Newman, or 1 even
Newman's understudies.
Outstanding Receivers
But Agep and Melin have con
nected frequently and the pres
ence of a fleet of outstanding re
ceivers still make WSU a dan
gerous passing threat.
Senior Gail Cogdill, one of the |
swiftest wingmen in the.nation,
is enough to give any coach tho j
v\illies. Cogdill has caught 13
passes this season for 273 yardsj
and while his reception total is I
ninth in the nation, his yardage
figure is second.
Last yea.' Cogdill set an NCAA
single game record when he j
caught seven passes against j
Northwestern for 252 yards.
Stanford felt his sting, too. He !
scored on a 72-yarder in WSU's
•10-G rout of Ihe far-from-ready
Tribe in last year's opener.
Defensive Stars
Slot back Don Ellersick, flank
ers Don Johnston and Pete

Schenck and ends Ed Shaw and
Laßoy Rath, top defensive stars,
add more targets. And the left
tackles are eligible about half the
time in Sutherland's new unbal
anced line offense.
The development of a solid
ground game, with Keith Lincoln,
George Reed and Perry Harper
doing most of the running, has
helped offset the inconsistency of
the passing attack. The versatile
Lincoln is one of the Coast's top
all-around backs.
Reed and Harper, both sopho
mores, have been pleasant sur
prises. Reed will be starting in
Cano's spot at fullback. Sprint
star Harper blossomed last week
at COP, gaining SI yards in
eight carries.
All-Const Center
Senior center Marv Nelson, an
all-coast first teamer last year,
anchors the forward wall. There
is considerable beef up front in
Ron Green (23.")), Dick Farrar
(227),« Jim Greig (202) Myke
Lindsay (210). And then there
is Bill Berry.
Berry, at 5-7 and 160 pounds,
is possibly the smallest starting
lineman in major collegiate
ranks. Needless to say, he's fast
and has performed well enough to
have been in the starting lineup
ever since the middle of last sea
son.
It will be a couple of teams
trying to break loose "like they
know they can." If they both do
at once, it coidd be quite a sight.
Washington State a caged
Cougar all season comes to the
Stadium tomorrow to meet a
Stanford team that was pretty
well shackled itself last week. To
say the least, ii should be an in
teresting, unpredictable after
noon.
The game is the fifth annual
high school band day. The foot
ball starts at 2 p.m.
For coach Jim Sutherland and
the Cougars, it has already been
a disappointing season. YVSU had
hopes of finally making it to the
Hose Bowl this year (a trip
missed by one-half game last sea
son). If the Cougars still have a
chance for the Roses, it is a slim
one. In the race for Pasadena
about all that is left of the Pa
cifif Coast conference nowadays
the Cougars are 0-2, having
lost to California and Oregon.
A misfiring offense, and a pe
riodically leaky defense have just
about ruined the season for what
was optimistically hoped to have
been WSU's best team in years.
Offensive Might
Surely, the Cougs have gone
through the motions of offensive
might. They've completed sensa
tional long pass plays and short
ones, run well around the ends
and up the middle. But never
quite often enough. They played
Cal on even terms for three
quarters before finally submit
ting to 92 and 50-yard runs in Ihe
fourth period. They twice put to
gether handsome drives that got
them inside Oregon's ten-yard
line, and then couldn't push over
a score.
In the Cougars' two wins the
offense sputtered most of the
way. Striking fast against San
Jose State, they bogged down for
two quarters and only a couple
of waning-minute touchdowns
marie it a 30-6 game. At College
of the Pacific last week, WSU
scored twice in the first quarter,
once early in the second and then
hung on for a 20-12 win.
Stanford's offense has sparkled
all season, until last week. Then,
the Tribe ran into a revitalized
Washington eleven that put the
damps on what had been one of
the nation's most sensational air
arms.
Stern Defense?
Everybody will be trying to un
track tomorrow.
The WSU defense as well. One
of the sternest on the Coast at
the end of last season, it has been
letting down at the most inoppor
tune moments this season. Last
week, COP, heretofore no great
shakes as a passing team, riddled
the Cougar secondary for 358
yards.
Stanford will go into action
without starting center Doug
Pursell or sophomore guard Tom
Walsh, coach Jack Curtice dis
closed yesterday. Pursell also
missed last week's Washington
game with a neck injury. Walsh
injured his ankle in the Husky
game.
Back in the lineup at top speed
will be veteran Ron Fernandes,
the man whose spot Walsh had
been so ably filling. Fernandes
was hurt in the opener with Ore
gon. Rick McMilJen, hurt in prac
tice this week, should be ready.
