# SU BIOCHEMIST WINS NOBEL PRIZE
## Award Given for Basic Research in the Field Of Hereditary Traits 
### Austin Scott 
Dr. Arthur Kornberg, executive head of the Stanford Department
of Biochemistry, and Dr. Severo Ochoa of New York University yes
terday were jointly awarded tho 1959 Nobel Prize for Medicine.
Both mon received the prize for their pioneering work in the field
of heredity. Together, the two men will share $42,606 in cash.

Here at Stanford, Dr. Kornberg
! received the news wtih a cheerful
i "0.K." and said he planned to go
j to Stockholm in December to ac
cept.
In New York, Dr. Ochoa, a nat
uralized Spanish-born American,
smiled happily over a paper cup
j of champagne.
First to Synthesize
Physicians who chose to work
jin biochemistry, the two were
j the first to successfully synthe
size the nucleic acids DNA and
j RNA.
Both men worked together for
I a year in 1946. Since then, they
have pursued their research in
dependently.
Dr. Ochoa has done most of his
| work in analyzing RNA, Ribonu
cleic acid, which takes part in the
production of proteins.
DNA, the specialty of Dr. Korn
i berg, is the scientific nickname
for Deoxyribonucleic Acid, the
I complex material that determines
hereditary characteristics in the
offspring of animals, plants, bac
: teria and some viruses.
DNA is the chemical that is be
lieved to correspond to what are
i commonly called "genes." One
1 gene is a section of the "code" of
DNA. The code depends upon the
sequence of four specific bases in
the acid.
Basic Itiiihii 1114 Blocks
These bases are basic building
blocks. They may bo thought of
as letters of an alphabet, and
may be combined in a limited
I number of ways to form "words,"
I or a particular type of DNA. The
j differences between living organ
j isms depend upon the number
1 and types of "words," or DNA,
j its cells contain.
Mutations in animals occur
! when one of the letters in a word
I is changed or replaced by an
other. That is, when the relative
I proportions of the bases in a spe*
! eific lypc of DNA are changed.
Heredity factors in any living
organism, blue eyes for instance,
are determined by the type of
! DNA present in the cells. By
substituting one building block
for another, Ihe DNA in a cell
may be changed, and any further
cells produced will bear some
sort of mutation.
Isolated Enzyme
In 1956 at the Washington Uni-
I versity School of Medicine in St.
1 Louis, Dr. Kornberg isolated an
j enzyme (natural chemical ftita
j lystt which when put into a test
tube with the four bases and a
certain amount of DNA would
synthesize additional DNA of the
type used as a pattern for the
reaction.
Since doing the original experi
ments, Dr. Kornberg and his as
sociates have made many differ
ent types of DNA. They are now
conducting studies to see whether
the manufactured DNA behaves
S in every way like th natural ma
i terial.
This research has important
1 significance in heredity studies.
I Eventually it may be possible to
"transplant" DNA with desired
| characteristics into animals or
i men in order to control heredity.
May Help Cancer Research
Also, there is a close resem
blance between the action of can
i cer and the effects of both genes
and viruses. There is the possi
i bility that further studies in the
I area opened up by Dr. Kornberg
| will lead to an increased under
! standing of the operation of can
j cer.
Dr. Kornberg came to Stanford
• in June, bringing with him five
i of his leading researchers and his
I entire laboratory. Mrs. Kornberg,
his full-time assistant since 1953,
holds an M.A. in biochemistry,

First to Synthesize
Physicians who chose to work
jin biochemistry, the two were
j the first to successfully synthe
size the nucleic acids DNA and
j RNA.
Both men worked together for
I a year in 1946. Since then, they

DNA, the specialty of Dr. Korn
i berg, is the scientific nickname
for Deoxyribonucleic Acid, the
I complex material that determines
hereditary characteristics in the
offspring of animals, plants, bac
: teria and some viruses.
DNA is the chemical that is be
lieved to correspond to what are
i commonly called "genes." One
1 gene is a section of the "code" of
DNA. The code depends upon the
sequence of four specific bases in
the acid.
Basic Itiiihii 1114 Blocks
These bases are basic building
blocks. They may bo thought of
as letters of an alphabet, and
may be combined in a limited
I number of ways to form "words,"
I or a particular type of DNA. The
j differences between living organ
j isms depend upon the number
1 and types of "words," or DNA,
j its cells contain.
Mutations in animals occur
! when one of the letters in a word
I is changed or replaced by an
other. That is, when the relative
I proportions of the bases in a spe*
! eific lypc of DNA are changed.
Heredity factors in any living
organism, blue eyes for instance,
are determined by the type of
! DNA present in the cells. By
substituting one building block
for another, Ihe DNA in a cell
may be changed, and any further
cells produced will bear some
sort of mutation.
Isolated Enzyme
In 1956 at the Washington Uni-
I versity School of Medicine in St.
1 Louis, Dr. Kornberg isolated an
j enzyme (natural chemical ftita
j lystt which when put into a test
tube with the four bases and a
certain amount of DNA would
synthesize additional DNA of the
type used as a pattern for the
reaction.
Since doing the original experi
ments, Dr. Kornberg and his as
sociates have made many differ
ent types of DNA. They are now
conducting studies to see whether
the manufactured DNA behaves
S in every way like th natural ma
i terial.
This research has important
1 significance in heredity studies.
I Eventually it may be possible to
"transplant" DNA with desired

blance between the action of can

Both mon received the prize for their pioneering work in the field
of heredity. Together, the two men will share $42,606 in cash.

Here at Stanford, Dr. Kornberg
! received the news wtih a cheerful
i "0.K." and said he planned to go
j to Stockholm in December to ac
cept.
In New York, Dr. Ochoa, a nat
uralized Spanish-born American,
smiled happily over a paper cup
j of champagne.
First to Synthesize
Physicians who chose to work
jin biochemistry, the two were
j the first to successfully synthe
size the nucleic acids DNA and
j RNA.
Both men worked together for
I a year in 1946. Since then, they
have pursued their research in
dependently.
Dr. Ochoa has done most of his
| work in analyzing RNA, Ribonu
cleic acid, which takes part in the
production of proteins.
DNA, the specialty of Dr. Korn
i berg, is the scientific nickname
for Deoxyribonucleic Acid, the
I complex material that determines
hereditary characteristics in the
offspring of animals, plants, bac
: teria and some viruses.
DNA is the chemical that is be
lieved to correspond to what are
i commonly called "genes." One
1 gene is a section of the "code" of
DNA. The code depends upon the
sequence of four specific bases in
the acid.
Basic Itiiihii 1114 Blocks
These bases are basic building
blocks. They may bo thought of
as letters of an alphabet, and
may be combined in a limited
I number of ways to form "words,"
I or a particular type of DNA. The
j differences between living organ
j isms depend upon the number
1 and types of "words," or DNA,
j its cells contain.
Mutations in animals occur
! when one of the letters in a word
I is changed or replaced by an
other. That is, when the relative
I proportions of the bases in a spe*
! eific lypc of DNA are changed.
Heredity factors in any living
organism, blue eyes for instance,
are determined by the type of
! DNA present in the cells. By
substituting one building block
for another, Ihe DNA in a cell
may be changed, and any further
cells produced will bear some
sort of mutation.
Isolated Enzyme
In 1956 at the Washington Uni-
I versity School of Medicine in St.
1 Louis, Dr. Kornberg isolated an
j enzyme (natural chemical ftita
j lystt which when put into a test
tube with the four bases and a
certain amount of DNA would
synthesize additional DNA of the
type used as a pattern for the
reaction.
Since doing the original experi
ments, Dr. Kornberg and his as
sociates have made many differ
ent types of DNA. They are now
conducting studies to see whether
the manufactured DNA behaves
S in every way like th natural ma
i terial.
This research has important
1 significance in heredity studies.
I Eventually it may be possible to
"transplant" DNA with desired
| characteristics into animals or
i men in order to control heredity.
May Help Cancer Research
Also, there is a close resem
blance between the action of can
i cer and the effects of both genes
and viruses. There is the possi
i bility that further studies in the
I area opened up by Dr. Kornberg
| will lead to an increased under
! standing of the operation of can
j cer.
Dr. Kornberg came to Stanford
• in June, bringing with him five
i of his leading researchers and his
I entire laboratory. Mrs. Kornberg,
his full-time assistant since 1953,
holds an M.A. in biochemistry,
j Together they have authored
; several research papers.
