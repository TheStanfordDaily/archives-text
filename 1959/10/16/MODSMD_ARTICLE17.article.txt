Dr. Norman Topping, President
of the University of Southern
California, was hung in effigy on
SC's fraternity row last week in
a general riot.
The administration was "ex
tremely disappointed" at the
row's action, which was a pro
test against new social and
scholastic regulations.
The president had issued a
"scholastic manifesto for frater
nities and sororities which will
require these social organizations
to meet the university's all stu
dent grade average or risk sus
pension from SC and the removal
of their charters by the groups'
national offices."
Twenty-two of the 32 fraterni
ties face suspension if they fail
to raise their grade point aver
ages above the all-university av
erage of 2.51 by the end of the
1960-61 school year.
Houses failing to meet all
student. averages for one se
mester will not be allowed to
initiate pledges; if they fail for
two semesters to match the
all-U average, they shall not be
allowed to pledge new mem
bers; and those which fail to
come up to the all-SC average
for three consecutive semesters
shall be expelled and the chap
ters removed.
Along with the scholastic pol
icy came a social one.
All events of any sort at fra
ternity houses held after 8 p.m.
must have two couples as chap
erones. One couple must be par
ents of one of the participants
and the second couple of com
parable age.
All events except dinner ex
changes alter 5:30 p.m. but end
ing before 8 p.m. must have one
couple as chaperone who must
also be the age of the parents
of the participants.
All fraternities shall conduct
their informal initiation period at
the same time. Each must sub
mit a complete schedule of pledge
activities for each semester, and
two alumni advisers, 35 years or
older, must be present at all in
formal and formal initiations.
The new administrative "phil
osophy" is not a reaction to the
Kappa Sigma hazing death of a
21-year-old pledge, according to
Dean of Students Robert J. Dow
ney. "President Topping has been
formulating his academic policy
since last July," he said.
More sedate reactions to the
decisions appeared in the Daily
Trojan.
A dialogue letter to the editor
(under the .appropriate heading
of Sound and Fury) has a con
versation between a caretaker
and a 1970 freshman who wants
to know what "those houses" are.
After being told of the University
ruling, the boy exclaims, "Why,

that's ridiculous. By continuing
to raise their averages, the fra
ternities and sororities would
eventually put the all-university
average out of everyone's reach."
The old caretaker replies,
"Why, it got so bad, just before
the end, that the president of the
student body, all Rowite members
of the ASSC Senate, the yell king
and half the varsily football team
gave up these activities in a vain
attempt to get their grades up
to the then-required 3.4."
All there is to be said to this
is check your math, fellow. The
rest is just about as logical.
An editorial declares "This (the
hanging) was but one of a long
line of asinine activities — T.G.-
I.F.'s, water-fights, panty-raids,
etc.—and we are sick of seeing
this university put in the position
of explaining these lame-brain
actions to the world at large . . .
"Perhaps they (the fraterni
ties) just don't want to be exposed
to to much education and fear
that this new policy will make
less safe the fraternity group
which has always protected them
from the more rigorous demands
of academic life. We admit there
is safety in a group, particularly
if the group is identified and sur
rounded by insanity such as was
demonstrated last Wednesday.
The group says, in effect, let us
all stick together and no matter
what we do nothing much will
happen to any of us. And nothing
very much does."
On the same page, in a differ
ent editorial, the Daily Trojan
says, "To subject fraternities
to the threat of severe punish
ment should they fail to attain
the president's academic goal,
and this without also pointing
a guilty finger at the men's
dormitories who are also below
the all-university average, in
fers that it is tlie nature of fra
ternity life which is at fault.
If President Topping desires to
carry his policy to the logical
end, he must deny students the
privilege of living in the dorms
should they fail to maintain
grades above the all-university
average. . . .
"The Row does not want to be
put in the position of Atlas
charged with the task of carrying
the weight of SC's scholastic
world on its shoulders."
In the University of Cincinnati
News Record, this item appears:
"Was it just an accident that ev
ery fraternity on the University
of Cincinnati campus finished
above the all-men's scholarship
average this past year?" The
averages: 2.49 to 2.21.
But the Daily Bruin's com
ment on the SC 1 situation was
the most piercing and applica
ble —"And don't think it can't
happen here."
