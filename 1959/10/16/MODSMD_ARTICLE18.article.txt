A Misunderstanding
Editor, The 1) nly:
It is evident that the Socialist
Caucus misunderstands the tra
ditional Stanford reticence about
our national way of life. That
anyone should question it cannot
but seem odd. Our very existence

answers to its effectiveness.
If the members of the caucus
are not merely engaging in puer
ile iconoclasms I would be happy
to remind them of the serious
ideals which are effectively made
a reality under the system of
American capitalism.
John O'Neill
