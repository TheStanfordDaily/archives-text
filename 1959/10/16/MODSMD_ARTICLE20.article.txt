# SCIENCE AT STANFORD
## ‘The Monster’: 2000 a Day 
### George Greenstein 
Stanford's 700 million electron
volt linear accelerator is by far
the largest, most complicated, and
most expensive gadget operated
by the University.
The "little monster," as the
atom-smasher is irreverently
called, operates on a budget of
more than $2,000 a day, and at
maximum output uses more
power than San Francisco.
It requires a crew of 20 techni
cians to keep the machine in
proper working order, and 100
men to assist the 20-plus scien
tists attached to the experimental
laboratory.
A machine drawing more power
than San Francisco is more lethal
than a bomb. When operating at
maximum output, the accelera
tor puts out in one second 700
times more radiation than a man
can survive.
Safety precautions are corre
spondingly strict and detailed.
Before turning on the accelera
tor, the technician on duly
must turn off all lights in dan
ger areas, ring warning bells,
and announce the turning on
over a public address system.
Should even these precautions
fail, the machinc is so arranged
that it cannot be turned on un
less all doors to danger areas are
locked.
Experiments performed with
the accelerator are expensive and
involved. A typical experiment
will cost about $2,000 —and some
run as high as $35,000.
Gerry Ohlsen, a grad student
at the accelerator, spent two
years planning and doing pre
liminary work on an experi
ment that took only four week
ends to perform.
"Simply to set up your equip
ment for an experiment," he ex
plained, "takes two or three days.
And to turn on the machine takes
from four to eight hours."
The accelerator itself runs in

a boringly regular fashion —if
all goes well —buzzing quietly
to itself. The experimenter,
once so busy babying his gad
getry and the machine, can only
sit and worry.
There is, however, a lot to
worry about. With an instrument
as big as the "little monster,"
something is bound to go wrong
sometime.
In such cases the long process
of the experiment is interrupted,
the accelerator is turned off- in
itself a long job and the men on

duty try to figure out what hap
pened.
Often it develops that al
though the accelerator is turn
ed on, nothing is accelerated.
In some such cases the defect
is expensive and extremely com
plicated to repair.
But there are also the cases
1 like that which happened to one
| man. I-le spent six hours in dis-
I covering that that machine was
pointed not at his carefully set-up
instruments, but at a blank wall
| in a different room.
