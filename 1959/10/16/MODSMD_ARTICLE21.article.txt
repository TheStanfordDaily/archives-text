# To Find What Makes Us Tick
## 
### 
"To find out what makes Amer
ica and Americans tick" is the
personal assignment of English
man Raymond Couchman. He
hopes to accomplish his mission
this year, as an ASSU scholar and
fall quarter resident at the AKL
house.
A graduate in economics from
the London School of Economics
and Political Sciences, Couchman
will be working for an M.A. in
history this year.
He recently hitch-hiked for
18 months in Europe, spending
six months in Spain where he
taught English. "It's an ideal
way of meeting people from all
walks of life and a multitude of
occupations," said Couchman.
He has reported his travel ex
periences and impressions in sev
eral radio broadcasts, and was a
feature writer for London and
British local newspapers. His
book, "Young Europe," is now
being published.
While generally pleased with
the friendly spirit at Stanford,
Couchman responded to further
questioning with a grin; "The at
mosphere does not appear to be
particularly conducive to study,"
lie said. "Students who work
hard, play harder."
