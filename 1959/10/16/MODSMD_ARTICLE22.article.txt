# NSF Program In Research Is Success
## 
### 
A new addition to the National
Science Foundation Program,
summer research jobs for top un
dergraduate students, has quick
ly proved a success at Stanford.
Twenty-four students selected
from the University's undergrad
uate honors program are being
supported until the end of the
scholastic year on the $17,580
NSF award, at pay ranging from
$1.75 to $2.75 an hour.
The students, who fit their re
search in around academic sched
ules, are teamed with a graduate
student and "guided with a loose
rein" by faculty members. The
largest single group working un
der the program was seven sci
ence majors, who went to work
for O. Cutler Shepard, executive
head of the Department of Metal
lurgical Engineering. Other re
search was directed by Dr. Eric
Hutchinson, executive head of
the chemistry division, and Doug
las H. Lawrence, professor of
psychology.
Albert H. Bowkor, dean of
Stanford's graduate division, said
in describing the program, "This
program has three unusual fea
tures. First, it provides recogni
tion for talented undergraduates;
second, it attempts to capture the
'teachable moment' when the stu
dent shows early interest in sci
entific research; and third, it
keeps students at work in their
chosen field, rather than in non
professional summer work, to
help finance their education.
