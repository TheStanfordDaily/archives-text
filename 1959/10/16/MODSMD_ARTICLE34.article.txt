### 
Spurred on by the hope of win
ning their first meet of the sea
son Stanford's water polo squad
tackles San Jose State this Sta
urday morning at 10 in the Stan
ford pool.
In their season's first meet
last Friday the Indians took the
beating of their life from Cal,
23-5. But with another week's
practice under their belts they
look greatly improved and pre
pared to take on the Spartans.
