# Frosh Meet Cal In Season Opener
## 
### Roy Schmidt 
Stanford's freshmen footballers kick off the 1959 season tomorrow
when they take on California's frosh at Stanford Stadium. Game
time is 10:45 a.m.
Coach Homer Smith's squad, which dropped a 34-0 decision to the
Stanford junior varsity last Saturday, has been working all week to

polish its attack. Smith attrib
uted the loss to the fact that his
1 team had not had a chance to
jell. "Football is an eleven man
1 effort, and we just couldn't get
together out there.
The freshmen couldn't seem to
j click on short passes which their
i coach considers the heart of the
| attack. Stanford's passing game
centers around John Powers, a
; 1 9 5 - p o un d quarterback from
: Phoenix, Arizona. The squad's top
i receivers are ends Chris Jessen
and Tom Fetherston.
On the ground the freshmen
boast a formidable running com
bination in fullback Mick Doherty
and right half Ed Cummings.
These two, rated by their coach
as the top ball carriers on the
squad, proved very effective
against the bigger and more ex
-1 perienced JV's.
Stanford may be without the
! services of first string halfback
Danny Spence, who has been hob
bled by an injured knee. Smith
indicated that ho might use
Spence in spots, but he definitely
will not start.
Also on the injured list are
fullback Tim Farrell, who hurt
his knee, and end Terry Wilson,
who suffered a cut lip and had
some teeth jarred loose.
One of the key weaknesses in
last week's scrimmage was pass
I defense. Brave quarterback Bob
Price made the frosh secondary

look very bad with his accurate
tosses. Smith indicated that his
squad has been working on this
defect all week, and he hopes they
have it solved.
California frosh, under Coach
Mike White gave every indication
of being a real powerhouse last
Saturday when they whipped the
Berkeley JV's, 22-6. The Cubs took
last year's frosh game against
Stanford by a 22-8 margin.
