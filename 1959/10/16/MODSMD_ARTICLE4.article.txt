# Gubser Claims Next Congress Will Okay Bill
## 
### Bill Reppy 
U.S. Congressman Charles Gub
ser said yesterday that he could
see 110 congressional stumbling
block for Stanford's proposed
linear accelerator. He spoke be
fore students in a meeting spon
sored by the Stanford Western
Society.
"The bill authorizing the linear
accelerator should be passed early
in the next session of Congress
in time for appropriation," said
Gubser. He praised Stanford for
"a superior and excellent presen
tation before the joint Congres
sional committee on atomic en
ergy.
The Congressional Record
shows that the joint committee
had at one time passed the bill
out to Congress, but it changed
its mind in order to give more
study to the power and patents
involved in the project.
According to Gubser, the argu
ment of a faction seeking to lo
cate the accelerator in an aban
doned railroad tunnel has proved
to be ridiculous, and a second
rival group from the midwest is
now supporting the bill.
The accelerator, also known as
the "Monster," will be two miles
long and will be constructed un
der the foothills behind the cam
pus.
It will be the greatest develop
ment in a .scientific laboratory
ever," said Gubser. "Stanford is
becoming the atomic research
center of the world."
Congressman Gubser, a co
author of the bill, represents the
10th district which covers Santa
Clara, San Benito, and Santa Cruz
counties. He is currently a mem
ber of the House Armed Forces
Committee.
