# LASSU HEARS BERRY
## Community Center Idea Pervades Union Plans 
### Steve Baffrey, Associate Editor 
New union director Chester A. Berry last night told the student
legislature that Stanford will eventually have a "college" union, and
not necessarily a "student" union.
1 Berry, in the course of remarks 011 eventual union plans, noted
; that the hope is for a "University community center" in what is

loosely referred to as the new
student union.
In addition Berry leveled a crit-1
icism at past University policies I
which he pointed out were mani- j
fested in what he termed "build- j
ing a building, and then deciding
what is to go on inside."
He told the group that the cur
rent stage of progress is "a state)
of defining what will happen in
the building." Berry requested
the Legislature set in motion the
wheels necessary to establish a
student group to work with him j
and the union committee.
"Two years," he answered a
representative who asked poten-1
tial moving elates into the new
structure.
In other business, the Legisla
ture tabled for another week final
approval on both the pending
Stanford Press Club and Inter
fraternity Council constitutions.!
Vogue and unclear wording was
the l-eason in both cases.
LASSU also established an Ap
propriations Committee of its
own members to study future ap
propriation request.s before they
reach the discussion floor. As
sistant Financial Manager Ed
Cutter will chair the group.
Rally Corn's appropriation re
quest for movies of co-ordinated
halftime movies to be shown at
the Sunday night flicks, the re
institution of the Scratch Sheet, j
and the establishment of investi
gation committees to study Pub
lic Relations Commission and the
Political Union combined with
the year's report of Cardinals to j
complete the night's work.
