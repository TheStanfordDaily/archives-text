# Cougar 'Arrival' Buries Stanford
## 
### Bob Payne 
Washington State's football team has been waiting all season to
"jell," so the Cougars thoughtfully waited until Saturday afternoon,
let Stanford score two quick and easy touchdowns, and then jelled
all over the place.
The final score was 3(5-19. WSU coach Jim Sutherland made no

bones about the fact that he
thought the Cougars had "ar
riveri" Saturday. Card coach Jack
Curtice looked at it this way:
"We're going to need a lot of im
provement or Southern California
will blow us out of the stadium."
Saturday, the Tribe challenges
the unbeaten Trojans in Los
Angeles.
WSU pulled no surprise
punches Saturday. The three men
the Cougars were boosting for
All-American at the first of the
season looked every bit the part.
They were Keith Lincoln, the
205-Lincoln junior halfback who
did absolutely everything Satur
day; Gail Cogdill, the sensational
end who pulled down five passes
and had the Indian secondary
"loose" all day, and Don Eller
sick, the versatile wingback who
caught two touchdowns passes,
intercepted a Stanford aerial and
even gained six yards once.
All this was complimented by
senior quarterback Mike Agee,
who looked anything like a weak
link Saturday. Agee, described
pretty much as a bit inadequate
this season, completed six of eight
passes and was a cool, steady field
general all afternoon.
Stanford, a favorite for a
change, started off as if to prove
the predictors right.
After an exchange of punts,
the Tribe got the ball on its own
35 and started the game's first
scoring drive. It took 15 plays—
almost all of them on the ground.

Tribe moved down to the Cougar
14. Otherwise, it had been all the
running of Rick McMillen, Skip
Face and Mac Wylie.
On third and six at the 14,
N'orman hit Burford again for
nine yards to the five. Norman
got one on a keeper, Face two
at right end and then Wylie shot
off tackle for the touchdown. Face
converted, with 3.26 left in the
first period.
Running Power
WSU showed a little running
power after the kickoff. The
Cougars drove from their own 27
to the Card 41, where Perry
Harper fumbled at the end of a
nine yard gain. Gil Dowd got it
for the Tribe and the second
scoring march was underway.
This one was quick and beauti
ful. On the first play of the sec
ond quarter, Norman found Bur
ford just ahead of the Cougar
secondary and hit him with a pass
that took the ball down to the
WSU 23.
Norman hit John Bond on a
look-in for eight more to the 15.
Wylie took a pitch and went 13
yards to the two. Face took two
plays to take it over.
First Miss
Then Skip missed the first
extra point of his varsity career,
after 18 straight over two sea
sons. Maybe this was a sign of
bad things to come.
For Mike Agee came right back
to earn his spurs, and the Cougars
were off and running.
They drove 80 yards in 10 plays.
Agee passes of 15 yards to Cog
dill, 27 to Lincoln, 17 to Cogdill,
and 5 more to Cogdill were big
gainers in the drive. Agee took
it in himself from the two. It had
been WSU's best drive of the
year and Agee's finest passing.
The Cougars weren't fired up
yet at this point, however. But
Keith Lincoln was soon to take
over.
Lincoln Takes Over
Before he was through, Lincoln
had gained 84 yards, completed
three of three passes, punted
twice for an average of 46.5
yards, scored one touchdown and
one two-point conversion and
passed for two touchdowns and
another two-pointer.
An exchange of punts—WSU's
a 53-y<irder by Lincoln — gave
Stanford the ball on its own 12-
yard line late in the half. The
Tribe got it out to the 26, where
a Norman pass was intercepted
by WSU end Pete Schenck.
This, by everybody's admission,
Was the turning point.
Agee pitched out to Lincoln,
the big halfback started around
end, stopped and lofted one down

to Ellersick in the corner of the
end zone for a 26-yard scoring
play. Lincoln fired one to Schneck
for the two-pointer and the
Cougars enjoyed a 14-13 half
time lead.
Turn on Steam
Stanford had let up long ago
and the Cougars just poured on
the steam after intermission. The
second time the Cougs had their
hands on the ball ,it took eight
plays to go 62 yards for the TD.
Lincoln gained 19 yards in the
drive, passed to Ellersick on a 29-
yarder that took it to the Indian
eight and one play later hit the
high-leaping Ellersick again with
the seven-yard scoring pass.
Lincoln swept end for the two
points.
Stanford was now in need of
gambling. The Tribe failed first
on a fourth-and-foUr try at the
WSU 38. Then, on another fourth
and-four on the Card 48, McMillen
got just three yards and the
Cougars took over.
There was only one pass in
1 his drive—it went incomplete—
but a Card interference penalty
pulled WSU out of a huge hole.
From then on it was the running
of Lincoln and Laßoy Rath, and

Rath boomed ten yards through
the middle for the touchdown. He
did the same for Ihe two-pointer
that made it 30-13.
A pass interception by Geoff
Price on the five yard line stalled
Stanford's errant TD drive, but a
poor Cougar punt set the stage
for another.
Norman's 23-yard pass to Face
got the ball down to ihe WSU
13 and then Rod Sears came into
take over the quarterbacking.
Things didn't go to well from
that point as the Tribe wound
up with another fourth-and-four
situation at the seven. Sears
passed incomplete, but an away
from-the-ball pass interference
call gave the Indians a first down
one the one.
Sears Scores
After a line play gained noth
ing, Sears kept the ball and went
through tackle for the score. With
5;20 left, a try for two points
failed.
Lincoln was not through. The
Cougars got the ball to the 50.
Lincoln skirted right end. He was
stopped at the 35, cut sharlv to his
Schenck, and outran everybody
left, got a beautiful block from
else to the end zone. 36-19.

Norman wound up with 13-for
28 and 147 yards — probably
enough to protect his national
passing lead. Burford, a brilliant
performer both ways, had seven
catches for 6ti yards.
In the line, Phil Burkland and
Don Peter were standouts for the
Tribe.
