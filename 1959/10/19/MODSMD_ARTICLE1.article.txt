# Cougar 'Arrival' Buries Stanford
## 
### Bob Payne 
Washington State's football team has been waiting all season to
"jell," so the Cougars thoughtfully waited until Saturday afternoon,
let Stanford score two quick and easy touchdowns, and then jelled
all over the place.
The final score was 3(5-19. WSU coach Jim Sutherland made no

bones about the fact that he
thought the Cougars had "ar
riveri" Saturday. Card coach Jack
Curtice looked at it this way:
"We're going to need a lot of im
provement or Southern California
will blow us out of the stadium."
Saturday, the Tribe challenges
the unbeaten Trojans in Los
Angeles.
WSU pulled no surprise
punches Saturday. The three men
the Cougars were boosting for
All-American at the first of the
season looked every bit the part.
They were Keith Lincoln, the
205-Lincoln junior halfback who
did absolutely everything Satur
day; Gail Cogdill, the sensational
end who pulled down five passes
and had the Indian secondary
"loose" all day, and Don Eller
sick, the versatile wingback who
caught two touchdowns passes,
intercepted a Stanford aerial and
even gained six yards once.
All this was complimented by
senior quarterback Mike Agee,
who looked anything like a weak
link Saturday. Agee, described
pretty much as a bit inadequate
this season, completed six of eight
passes and was a cool, steady field
general all afternoon.
Stanford, a favorite for a
change, started off as if to prove
the predictors right.
After an exchange of punts,
the Tribe got the ball on its own
35 and started the game's first
scoring drive. It took 15 plays—
almost all of them on the ground.
