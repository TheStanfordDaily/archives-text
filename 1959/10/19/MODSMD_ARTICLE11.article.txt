"Many events in this world inspire fear and anxiety; others in
spire hope and confidence. Eminent in the latter category is the aid
being given to worthy students of all nations, through the World
University Service, by their more fortunate fellows in other lands.
"As members of an American university community, we enjoy
manifold blessings which others do not share. This week, when our
student volunteers conduct Stanford's annual World University
Service drive for funds, it would be well for us to count our blessings
and seriously consider the advantage of sharing with others."
—J. E. WALLACE STERLING,
President of the University.
"The Stanford student body has made an enviable record in pro
moting international understanding through the IIR, the ASSU
Foreign Scholarship Program, Model United Nations Assemblies,
Foreign Policy Conferences and many other activities and programs.
"Our contributions to World University Service may have had less
attention than some of the other activities, but they are as important
as anything we can do in this area.
"Essentially WUS is a program of self-help. Every dollar in
vested starts a chain reaction which results in many dollars worth
of benefit. I hope that every Stanford student will respond to the
appeal."
—H. DONALD WINBIGLER,
Dean of Students.
"Each year the ASSU sponsors the World University Service
Drive. It is this drive that enables us to share or provide less
fortunated students throughout the world with many of the oppor
tunities and services that we as Americans and Stanford students
consider necessities. In these times when international relations and
policies have taken on a great significance to such a widespread
number of people, World University Service provides an excellent
vehicle by which we, as members of the University community, can
aid in the hope for international peace and understanding. What
could be a better way to realize this hope than to help provide text
books, build student health clinics and medical centers, replace card
board shacks with decent living quarters, or extend a helping hand
of friendship. I sincerely hope that you will take it upon yourselves
to see the worthiness of this organization's drive and generously
respond to it during this next week."

tunities and services that we as Americans and Stanford students
consider necessities. In these times when international relations and
policies have taken on a great significance to such a widespread
number of people, World University Service provides an excellent
vehicle by which we, as members of the University community, can
aid in the hope for international peace and understanding. What
could be a better way to realize this hope than to help provide text
books, build student health clinics and medical centers, replace card
board shacks with decent living quarters, or extend a helping hand
of friendship. I sincerely hope that you will take it upon yourselves
to see the worthiness of this organization's drive and generously
respond to it during this next week."
—RICH SUNDEEN,
ASSU President.
"Many events in this world inspire fear and anxiety; others in
spire hope and confidence. Eminent in the latter category is the aid
being given to worthy students of all nations, through the World
University Service, by their more fortunate fellows in other lands.
"As members of an American university community, we enjoy
manifold blessings which others do not share. This week, when our
student volunteers conduct Stanford's annual World University
Service drive for funds, it would be well for us to count our blessings
and seriously consider the advantage of sharing with others."
—J. E. WALLACE STERLING,
President of the University.
"The Stanford student body has made an enviable record in pro
moting international understanding through the IIR, the ASSU
Foreign Scholarship Program, Model United Nations Assemblies,
Foreign Policy Conferences and many other activities and programs.
"Our contributions to World University Service may have had less
attention than some of the other activities, but they are as important
as anything we can do in this area.
"Essentially WUS is a program of self-help. Every dollar in
vested starts a chain reaction which results in many dollars worth
of benefit. I hope that every Stanford student will respond to the
appeal."
—H. DONALD WINBIGLER,
Dean of Students.
"Each year the ASSU sponsors the World University Service
Drive. It is this drive that enables us to share or provide less
fortunated students throughout the world with many of the oppor
tunities and services that we as Americans and Stanford students
consider necessities. In these times when international relations and
