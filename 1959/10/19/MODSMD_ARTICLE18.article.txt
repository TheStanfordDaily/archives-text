The Tuesday Evening Series

other panel discussion Friday at
the"I" Center on a subject yet to

UN Day
Saturday is UN Day and a
street dance will be held that eve
ning from 8 to 12 in the Dinkel
spiel Auditorium parking lot. As
part of the entertainment, Allen
Rosenthal, a British student, will
play a guitar and sing interna
tional folk songs.
During the week a display,
sponsored by the United Nations
Education Center of the lIR and
WUS, will appear on both sides of
the stairway at the Main Library.
A special book fair in conjunction
with UN Week has been set up in
the World Affairs Council Book
and Pamphlet Shop at 656 Market
St., San Francisco, and students
and faculty have been invited to
visit it.
Dr. K. Bhaskara Rao. WUS re
gional executive from India, will
be on campus during the drive
and will speak to numerous
classes and living groups.
$5000 Goal
According to Pete Knopf, chair
man of the WUS Drive, a realistic
goal of $5000 has been set for this
year's contributions. Most of this
will be collected from individual
students in the living groups, al
though there will be a collection
table at Engineering Corner Tues
day and Wednesday mornings for
graduate and off - campus stu
dents.
Faculty solicitations will be
postponed until later in the year
so as not to conflict with the local
Community Fund Appeal current
ly taking place.
Collection Competition
Collections will continue in the
living groups through Thursday,
and there will be four classes of
competition for the largest per
capita donations. These divisions
are: I, fraternities, eating clubs
and Stern houses; 11, Row houses,
Moore houses, Lagunita casas and
Union; 111, Roble and Branner;
and IV, Wilbur houses.
Announcement of winners and
awarding of prizes will be made
Saturday night at the street dance.
In addition to the division prizes
there will be an overall grand
prize for the highest contributing
group.
Solicitors have been asked by
Knopf to bring the money they
collect to the third floor of the
Women's Clubhouse every night
between 8:30 and 10:30.
Several other money - raising
events are planned, including
smashing an old car with a sledge
hammer and electing a professor
to lead a yell at the San Jose State
game in two weeks.
The money procured from the
drive will be used to help needy
students over the world in several
different areas of assistance.
Funds go for student lodging and
living, student health, individual
and emergency aid, and educa
tional activities and facilities. The
program, in its 39th year, is di
rected largely by students' on an
international basis with head
quarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
