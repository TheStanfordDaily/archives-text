# ASSU Octopus
## 
### 
Every si'iux't; ASSII candidates call for reorganization ami the re--
(1 notion of red tape in student government. Ami every fall a new
group of student officers, armed with good intentions, attacks the
octopus of over-organization.
The ASSU and Legislature are capable of providing many val
uable services to the student body as a screening ami clearing sta
tion for student activities. We are sorry when we see these services
drowning in their own sea of red tape.
In Legislature Oct. 8 two constitutions were presented for ap
proval: the revised Interfraternity Council charier and the consti
tution for a Stanford Press (Hub. In accordance with correct par
liamentary proceedings, these documents were sent to Bv-Laws
Committee for study.
The three-man By-Laws Committee, even though il was new
at the job and unfamiliar with the form for constitutions under the
ASSU, waited until the following Thursday afternoon just a few
hours before the next Legislature meeting to study the constitu
tions.
An IFC memorandum authorized the By-Laws Committee to
make minor changes in their constitution in order to expedite its
passage. But the IKC constitution was tabled for minor corrections,
which, of course, could not be made during the LASSU meeting.
Standard articles taken from ;i model constitution and incor
porated in the Press Club constitution were ruled ambiguous and
vague.
We respect Presidential Assistant John Bassett and the oilier
members of his By-Laws Committee for their good intentions.
We wonder, though, if even Roberts Rules of Order would pass
this committee without being tabled lo straighten out ambiguities.
