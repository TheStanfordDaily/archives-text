## The 						I-Center 
### Doug Willis 
For many of the more than
300 foreign students at Stanford
the I-Center is an important, if
not dominating, part of their soc
ial lives at Stanford.
"It is good idea to have the
I-Center," said one American
student, "so that the people who
would like (o meet foreign stu
dents know where to find
them."
"I think that the I-Center is a
wonderful thing," said another
girl, but she couldn't explain why.
"It just is."
However, one person who
knows the I-Center .just about as
well as anyone is a little more
critical of the Center's operation.
Dr. Werner Warmbrunn, foreign
student advisor, observes that
perhaps a few foreign students
are too comfortable in the I-
Center and consequently don't
take part in campus life.
"The ideal purpose of the I-
Center," explains Warmbrunn,
"is to be a home base and start
ing point for the foreign stu
dents. lint we hope that as the
year progresses, they will make
friends outside or bring friends
to the I-Center."
Warmbrunn observed that the
I-Center does work in this way
and that the number of foreign
students found in the I-Center
decreases steadily during the
year.
"But Stanford social life ap
pears to run in small circles,"
said Warmbrunn, "and neither
the American and foreign stu
dents know how to associate with
each other."
"I think that most students
would like to meet foreign stu
dents, hut there seems to be a

fear of being different," ob
served another American stu
dent
Foreign students in the I-
Center meet the more intellectual
American students, noted Warm
brunn. "Those dissatisfied with
the intellectual atmosphere in
the dorms come to the I-Center."
Warmbrunn observed the suc
cess of many programs designed
to bring in American students. He
named the Sidewalk Cafe, the
Saturday night Firesides and the
luncheon discussions as the most
successful.
But Warmbrunn also noted
several weaknesses in the for
eign student program: "Some
times I begin to wonder wheth
er the I-Center is not also a
liability just because it works
so well," said Warmbrunn in an
open letter to foreign students
last spring, "because it provides
a warm nest for the stranger
from overseas, who on his part
too has to make an effort if lie
wants to get to know people in
the USA."
Warmbrunn also criticized the
small number of foreign students
who do not have time to take part
in campus life, but "have plenty
of time to sit around in the I-
Center . . . where the same con
versations go on day after day
and night after night."
But the only thing wrong with
the I-Center, agree many stu
dents who visit there, is that too
many American students think
that the Center is just for the
foreign visitor and they are shy
about coming into the Center.
"If only more people realized
what this place offers," mused
more than one participant in
I-Center activities.
