## Indian Loss Bewildering To Curtice 
### 
It was a bewildered and be
fuddled Jack Curtice who talked
with reporters in the Stanford
lockerroom Saturday after watch
ing the Indians absorb their worst
beating of the season.
"I can't explain how wo wore
world beaters for two touchdowns
and t hen completely collapsed any
more than I can fly a kite," the
Card's head coach said.
Curtice had no answer at all for
the disappointing second half.
Curtice called the game the
lowest point since he's been at
Stanford. He said that Washing
ton Stale had thrown no surprises
at the Tribe and that he didn't
think that the Cougars had as
good a team as the one which
made his initiation to West Coast
football such an unpleasant one
last year.
Still searching for explanations
for his squad's sudden letdown,
Curtice said that ihe boys looked
tired physically. "Maybe after the
first two touchdowns came so
easily, they just took it easy."
Somebody brought up the pain
ful subject of next week's op
onent, unbeaten Southern Cali
fornia. It was obvious that the
Card mentor was not indulging
in any wishful thinking.
"We'll have to be up in the sky
to stay in the same park with
SC," Curtice said. "It'll take
everything we've got to keep from
being blown plumb off the field."
On the credit side of the
ledger, Curtice observed that the
Indian's tackling had been good
and that the hard running of
Archie Schmitt had been a pleas
ant surprise. Another glad note
is that that there were no bad
injuries. First string center Doug
Pursell only played for four
downs Saturday because of a
neck injury, but will be back at
full strength next Saturday.
