# Frosh Edge Cubs In Offensive Tilt
## 
### Chuck Bischoff 
In a wild offensive battle Saturday morning the Stanford fresh
man footballers won the first of two "Little Big Games" from Cal's
frosh, 40 to 34. The Papooses built up a 33 to 14 halftime lead and
made the game look like a runaway, but defensive lapses almost
cost them a victory which seemed in the bag.

Led by the hard rushing of
right halfback Ed Cummings and
fullback Mick Doherty, the Indian
frosh picked up 31 first downs to
Cal's 14. Cummings carried 17
times for 125 yards and Doherty
ground out 85 yards in 16 plays,
often carrying Cal taeklers.
Quarterback John Power kepi
the offense running smoothly and
completed 12 passes out of 25 for
125 yards, mostly to ends Tom
Fetherston and Chris Jessen and
flanker back Tim Hansel.
In the first half the only way
either team could be stopped was
through fumbles. The Cal frosh
scored first, traveling 46 yards
in 9 plays after recovering a
fumble. Quarterback Larry Balli
ett went in from the one. The
Indians roared back after the
kickoff as Doherty and Cummings
alternated for 74 yards in 6 plays.
Doherty swept around end for
the last 7 yards.
Fumbles Hurt
The Bear Cubs fumbled the
next kickoff, and the Indian frosh
quickly capitalized, as Royse
scored the first of two touch
downs. This did not discourage
Cal, for two minutes later Bob
Patterson broke loose for 48 yards
to the Stanford two. Balliett again
sneaked over and the score was
14 to 14.
The Papooses took the ensuing
kickoff and again marched down
the field. Jim Richardson plough
ed through several taeklers into
the end one. On the next play
from scrimmage Cal again
fumbled and Stanford recovered
on the 35. The frosh went to the
air, and Power threw an 8 yard
touchdown pass to Fetherston. A
few minutes later the fumble and
score routine was repeated. This
time Cummings scored for the
Indians to make it 33 to 14. as
the half ended.
Fumbles Again
After driving from their own
12 yard line to the Cal 27,
the Indian frosh were held on
downs. But on the first play Cal
fumbled once more and shortly
afterwards Roy.se plunged over
from the one, making the score
40 to 14.
From then on the tide turned
swiftly in favor of the Cal frosh.
Early in the fourth quarter half
back Rudy Carvajal broke over
the middle and romped 65 yards
for the score. The next time the
Bear Cubs got the ball Randy
Gold threw a perfect 39 yard pass
to Larry Lowell. Minutes later,
they drove 42 yards after an in
terception for another touchdown.
Coach Homer Smith said the
freshmen showed they were a
"real fine team" but "they made
mistakes which all young players
will do," allowing the Bear Cubs
to break away for many long
gains. Smith was pleased with
the offense, especially the run
ning of Cummings, Doherty, and
Bob Royse.
