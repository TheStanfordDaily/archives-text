"During the first quarter I
thought it would be a long after
noon, but as it turned out, this
was the best game by far that our
team has played this year." Wash
ington State University's coach
Jim Sutherland shifted to a more
comfortable position on the hard
wooden locker room bench, lit
another cigarette and began to
relax alter the tension of his
Cougars' come-from-behind vic
tory.
The major post game topics
were the exceptional play of Keith
Lincoln, a junior halfback who
sparked Sutherland's offense,
and the effective defense of Stan
ford's Dick Norman. According
to the WSU head mentor it was
not a matter of stopping Norman
or the Indian offense, but the fact
lhat Stanford did not stop Wash
ington State.
"Lincoln played better than I've
ever seen him play before," Suth
erland continued, "and Ellersick,
Cogdill, Le√üoy Raft and the
centers, Nelson and Hitzel, all
played exceptional games. Agee
called a good game; he mixed the
plays well."
"Lincoln for the first time this
year was thinking only of the
game at hand."
For Stanford Sutherland singled
out Chris Burford and he thought
the entire Indian line played well,
with Phil Burkland rating special
mention. Stanford's running at
tack, usually receiving less at
tention than the passing, was
praised by the visiting coach.
The big break for the Cougars
came when they intercepted a
pass while trailing 13-6. "Up until
then our players were worried
about everything, but then they
got that interception after scor
ing their first touchdown and
found they could stop Norman's
passing . . and Sutherland sum
med up the result ". . . and that's
all they needed to get going."
