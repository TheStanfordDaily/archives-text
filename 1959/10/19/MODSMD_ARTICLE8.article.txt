# Colorado Scores Win Over Stanford on College Bowl
## 
### Jerry Rankin 
Stanford's scholastic football
•squad, unable to overcome a 95-
point first-half lead by the Univer
sity of Colorado, went flown to a
190-155 defeat on the GE College
Bowl yesterday afternoon in Hol
lywood.
The loss, completing a losing
weekend for the University's var
sity footballers, came on the
team's third appearance on the
nationally televised show and
means that Colorado will fly to
New York City next Sunday to de
fend its title.
Stanford correctly answered
just one question during the en
tire first half of the show and was
behind 125-30 at the start of the
second half.
Team Members
The team — Del Simenson,
George Green, Roger Dingman I
and Dan White — then staged a
thrilling comeback that brought
them to within five points of the
Coloradans, 125-120.
At one point, the quick-thinking
White correctly answered six out
of seven questions thrown at
Stanford, five of them in a row.
However, Colorado recovered
and began to pull away again.
With two minutes left in the
game, it was 150-130, Colorado
ahead. Stanford missed a ques
tion then and never had a chance |
after that.
'Toss-Lps'
Both teams were stumped sev
eral times by "toss-up" questions,

sitting in silence while the studio
audience waited for one or the
other to attempt an answer.
With the $500 loser's share they
received, the Stanford scholars'
total winnings on the show came
to $3500, all of which goes to the
Univers'ty scholarship fund.
Miss Simenson revealed on the
show that a reporter for Look
magazine has been following the
group recently, gathering mate
rial for a Look article.
A cheering, shouting crowd of
50 students gathered in Toyon
Hall to watch the program, which
was broadcast on CBS at 5:30.
In the past two weeks the Stan
ford squad defeated the Univer
sity of Oregon and Loyola Univer
sity of Los Angeles in shows
beamed from here.
The program shifts permanent
ly to New York next week, with
Colorado scheduled to face a
quartet from Southern Methodist
University.
