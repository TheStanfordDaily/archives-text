# Turkey Leads In U.N. Vote
## 
### 
UNITED NATION'S. N.Y.. (/P>
Turkey, the West's candidate
for a seat on the U.N. Security
Council, went into a slight lead
over Communist Poland yester
day in a new round of voting. Bid
the Turks were well short of a
two-thirds majority, and the East-
West deadlock persisted.
Balloting in the General Assem
bly was suspended for two weeks
after a see-saw race developed.
Turkey's three-vote edge, its best
showing so far, gave the West
new bargaining strength in the
intense diplomatic maneuvering
for the seat on the 11-nation
Council.
At stake is the prestige of the
West, as well as a vote in the
U.N. body primarily responsible
for dealing with international
disputes.
Recently the West has resorted
to procedural maneuvers to frus
trate any Soviet vetoes.
Yesterday's voting marked the
third time the assembly has met
to choose a successor for the two
year term iti the Council seat now
held by Japan. The winner takes
over Jan. 1.
Normally the West could be ex
pected to line up enough votes.
But this year Poland began cam
paigning early and signed up sup
port before Turkey entered the
race. The Turks came in late be
cause Greece, a North Atlantic
Treaty ally like Turkey, at first
considered campaigning as the
Western candidate and then de
cided not to.
