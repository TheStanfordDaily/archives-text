# Ike Asks Injunction To Halt Steel Strike
## President Sees 'No Prospects' For Early Bargaining Success 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — President Eisenhower, calling Monday a
"sad day for the nation," ordered government lawyers to ask a fed
eral court to send 500,000 striking steelworkers back to the mills for
80 days.
Eisenhower issued his instructions to Atty. Gen. William P. Rogers

about hours atter his special
fact-finding panel reported to him
that "We see no prospects for an
early cessation of the strike"
which already has lasted a record
97 days.
In its report to Eisenhower, the
panel said it "cannot point to
any single issue of any conse
quence whatsoever upon which
the parties are in agreement."
The biggest obstacles to a set
tlement, the report told Eisen
hower, lie in union demands for
pay and other increases and in
dustry demands for greater lati
tude in adjusting working condi
tions to achieve economies.
Backing Away
Backing away from its original
money demands, the United Steel
workers Union finally proposed
increased wage and other bene
fits it valued at about 20 cents an
hour under a two-year contract.
Before the strike began, the steel
hands were averaging $3.11 an
hour.
The companies contended the
union's proposals still were in
flationary and said they would
cost much more than the steel
workers estimated. In its counter
offer, the industry sought a
three-year contract with added
benefits worth about half what
the union wanted.
As for the work rules issue, the
industry has offered to submit to
arbitration in its demand for the
right to alter local conditions to
increase efficiency and cut labor
costs. These rules run into the
thousands and vary from plant to
plant. The companies never have
spelled out what rules they would
change.
The White House announced the
back-to-work order will be sought
in federal district court in Pitts
burgh Tuesday afternoon.
Letter to Rogers
After consulting with various
legal, labor and other advisers,
the President made public his
letter to Rogers, saying:
"It is essential to the national
interest that production be re
sumed immediately in the steel
industry.
"Free collective bargaining has
not worked in this dispute despite
the dedicated efforts of Ihe fed
eral government and the fact
finding board of inquiry.
"In order to protect the in
terests of all the American people,
this leaves me with no alternative
except to seek an injunction un
der the existing law.
"American's hopes for a vol
unteer responsible settlement
have not been fulfilled. It is a
sari day for the nation."
If the order is granted, the
steelworkers would be required to
return to their jobs for 80 days—
a "cooling off" period intended
to allow new efforts to negotiate
a settlement.

Letter to Rogers
After consulting with various
legal, labor and other advisers,
the President made public his
letter to Rogers, saying:
"It is essential to the national
interest that production be re
sumed immediately in the steel
industry.
"Free collective bargaining has
not worked in this dispute despite
the dedicated efforts of Ihe fed
eral government and the fact
finding board of inquiry.
"In order to protect the in
terests of all the American people,
this leaves me with no alternative
except to seek an injunction un
der the existing law.
"American's hopes for a vol
unteer responsible settlement
have not been fulfilled. It is a
sari day for the nation."
If the order is granted, the
steelworkers would be required to
return to their jobs for 80 days—
a "cooling off" period intended
to allow new efforts to negotiate
a settlement.
WASHINGTON (/P) — President Eisenhower, calling Monday a
"sad day for the nation," ordered government lawyers to ask a fed
eral court to send 500,000 striking steelworkers back to the mills for
80 days.
Eisenhower issued his instructions to Atty. Gen. William P. Rogers

about hours atter his special
fact-finding panel reported to him
that "We see no prospects for an
early cessation of the strike"
which already has lasted a record
97 days.
In its report to Eisenhower, the
panel said it "cannot point to
any single issue of any conse
quence whatsoever upon which
the parties are in agreement."
The biggest obstacles to a set
tlement, the report told Eisen
hower, lie in union demands for
pay and other increases and in
dustry demands for greater lati
tude in adjusting working condi
tions to achieve economies.
Backing Away
Backing away from its original
money demands, the United Steel
workers Union finally proposed
increased wage and other bene
fits it valued at about 20 cents an
hour under a two-year contract.
Before the strike began, the steel
hands were averaging $3.11 an
hour.
The companies contended the
union's proposals still were in
flationary and said they would
cost much more than the steel
workers estimated. In its counter
offer, the industry sought a
three-year contract with added
benefits worth about half what
the union wanted.
As for the work rules issue, the
industry has offered to submit to
arbitration in its demand for the
right to alter local conditions to
increase efficiency and cut labor
costs. These rules run into the
thousands and vary from plant to
plant. The companies never have
