## EDITORIALS COLUMNS, INTERPRETATION Walter Lippmann

There should be some red faces
among the President's advisers
as they read what Dr. Taylor had
to say on Tuesday. Dr. Taylor is
the chairman of the board ap
pointed last week by the Presi
dent to set in motion the Taft
' Hartley Act.
This law, incident ally, is by
common consent, unsuited to
the steel strike. But as it is the
only law we have, and as we
cannot think of what else to do,
we are resorting to it.
Dr. Taylor's embarrassing re
mark was that "a settlement this
week would be a miracle of the
No. 1 first order." Why would it
be such a miracle? Because "our
mediation efforts are impeded by
our difficulty in nailing down
what the issues are.
"I think it's very distressing
at this stage that we are still
having trouble defining issues."
It is indeed distressing to al
low a strike in this country's
basic Industry to run three
months without even clarify
ing and defining what the
strike is about.
A month before the strike be
gan, at his press conference on
June 17, the President was asked
by Mr. Brandt of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch whether, since the
unions and the companies were
using "self-serving statistics," the
government could not bring out
some impartial figures "so that
people can understand the issues
and make their own decisions."
The President replied that the
question was intelligent and that
he would have it studied.
But a month later, having
had it studied, he had been told
by his advisers to keep out of
the argument because "all the
facts are pretty well known."
He has now been told by Dr.
Taylor that the essential facts are
not known at all, and that after
three monlhs of propaganda by
the companies and the unions, it
would now be "a minor miracle"
to get the issues defined this
week.
In short, the country is suffer
ing from a costly stoppage be
cause there is an industrial war
going on over issues which no
body who is interested will, which
nobody who is disinterested can,
define. There may be all manner
of argument about what is the

proper role of the government in
a dispute of this kind.
But can there be any argu
ment that in a conflict of such
national significance it is a
duty of the government to see
that the issues are defined?
In the general confusion, where
there is no responsible and reli
able authority to elucidate the
truth, there is no one who is rep
resenting the national interest.
Yet great national interests are
at stake.
There is the national interest
in resuming top production.
There is the interest in arriving
at a settlement which in terms of
wages and prices is compatible
with the health of the economy
as a whole. For the settlement of
the steel strike will set a pattern
for wages and prices which other
industries will follow.
But who has authority to rep
resent the national interest in
the steel dispute? The answer
is nobody. We are, it is said,
demonstrating to mankind the
virtues of "free bargaining."
My own view is that for a con
structive solution of what is a
very complex business, it is es
sential for the nation through the
Congress to make a fundamental
decision of national policy.
This would be to assert that
in the great industrial conflicts
involving gi a nt monopolistic
corporations and unions, the
national interest is paramount.
It is paramount in that differ
ences must be settled without
strikes or lockouts. It is para
mount in that the wage-price con
ditions of the settlement must be
beneficial to the whole national
economy.
The national interest being par
amount, in the last resort the gov
ernment should have the power
to require compulsory arbitra
tion, and to enforce observance of
the verdict. In my view, if this
power exists and is intelligently
exercised, it will rarely have to
be invoked.
For with the existence of the
reserve power, tin 1 government
will he in a strong position to
urge lalmr and management, to
bargain freely if they can and
if they will, or else to accept

that the issues are defined?
In the general confusion, where
there is no responsible and reli

at stake.
There is the national interest

There is the interest in arriving

the steel strike will set a pattern

There should be some red faces
among the President's advisers
as they read what Dr. Taylor had
to say on Tuesday. Dr. Taylor is
the chairman of the board ap
pointed last week by the Presi
dent to set in motion the Taft
' Hartley Act.
This law, incident ally, is by
common consent, unsuited to
the steel strike. But as it is the
only law we have, and as we
cannot think of what else to do,
we are resorting to it.
Dr. Taylor's embarrassing re
mark was that "a settlement this
week would be a miracle of the
No. 1 first order." Why would it
be such a miracle? Because "our
mediation efforts are impeded by
our difficulty in nailing down
what the issues are.
"I think it's very distressing
at this stage that we are still
having trouble defining issues."
It is indeed distressing to al
low a strike in this country's
basic Industry to run three
months without even clarify
ing and defining what the
strike is about.
A month before the strike be
gan, at his press conference on
June 17, the President was asked
by Mr. Brandt of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch whether, since the
unions and the companies were
using "self-serving statistics," the
government could not bring out
some impartial figures "so that
people can understand the issues
and make their own decisions."
The President replied that the
question was intelligent and that
he would have it studied.
But a month later, having
had it studied, he had been told
by his advisers to keep out of
the argument because "all the
facts are pretty well known."
He has now been told by Dr.
Taylor that the essential facts are
not known at all, and that after
three monlhs of propaganda by
the companies and the unions, it
would now be "a minor miracle"
to get the issues defined this
week.
In short, the country is suffer
ing from a costly stoppage be
cause there is an industrial war
going on over issues which no
body who is interested will, which
nobody who is disinterested can,
define. There may be all manner
of argument about what is the

proper role of the government in
a dispute of this kind.
But can there be any argu
ment that in a conflict of such

to say on Tuesday. Dr. Taylor is
the chairman of the board ap
pointed last week by the Presi
dent to set in motion the Taft
' Hartley Act.
This law, incident ally, is by
common consent, unsuited to
the steel strike. But as it is the
only law we have, and as we
cannot think of what else to do,
we are resorting to it.
Dr. Taylor's embarrassing re
mark was that "a settlement this
week would be a miracle of the
No. 1 first order." Why would it
be such a miracle? Because "our
mediation efforts are impeded by
our difficulty in nailing down
what the issues are.
"I think it's very distressing
at this stage that we are still
having trouble defining issues."
It is indeed distressing to al
low a strike in this country's
basic Industry to run three
months without even clarify
ing and defining what the
strike is about.
A month before the strike be
gan, at his press conference on
June 17, the President was asked
by Mr. Brandt of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch whether, since the
unions and the companies were
using "self-serving statistics," the
government could not bring out
some impartial figures "so that
people can understand the issues
and make their own decisions."
The President replied that the
question was intelligent and that
he would have it studied.
But a month later, having
had it studied, he had been told
by his advisers to keep out of
the argument because "all the
facts are pretty well known."
He has now been told by Dr.
Taylor that the essential facts are
not known at all, and that after
three monlhs of propaganda by
the companies and the unions, it
would now be "a minor miracle"
to get the issues defined this
week.
In short, the country is suffer
ing from a costly stoppage be
cause there is an industrial war
going on over issues which no
body who is interested will, which
nobody who is disinterested can,
define. There may be all manner
of argument about what is the

proper role of the government in
a dispute of this kind.
But can there be any argu
ment that in a conflict of such
national significance it is a
duty of the government to see
that the issues are defined?
In the general confusion, where
there is no responsible and reli
able authority to elucidate the
truth, there is no one who is rep
resenting the national interest.
Yet great national interests are
at stake.
There is the national interest
in resuming top production.
There is the interest in arriving
at a settlement which in terms of
wages and prices is compatible
with the health of the economy
as a whole. For the settlement of
the steel strike will set a pattern
for wages and prices which other
industries will follow.
But who has authority to rep
resent the national interest in
the steel dispute? The answer
is nobody. We are, it is said,
demonstrating to mankind the
virtues of "free bargaining."
My own view is that for a con
structive solution of what is a
very complex business, it is es
sential for the nation through the
Congress to make a fundamental
decision of national policy.
This would be to assert that
in the great industrial conflicts
involving gi a nt monopolistic
corporations and unions, the
national interest is paramount.
It is paramount in that differ
ences must be settled without
strikes or lockouts. It is para
mount in that the wage-price con
ditions of the settlement must be
beneficial to the whole national
economy.
The national interest being par
amount, in the last resort the gov
ernment should have the power
to require compulsory arbitra
tion, and to enforce observance of
the verdict. In my view, if this
power exists and is intelligently
exercised, it will rarely have to
be invoked.
For with the existence of the
reserve power, tin 1 government
will he in a strong position to
urge lalmr and management, to
bargain freely if they can and
if they will, or else to accept
voluntary arbitration.
