Class Rudeness
Editor, The Daily:
In my English class this morn
ing, I witnessed an example of
rudeness which prompted me to
write this letter. The professor
was just finishing his summary
of the day's discussion when the
bell rang.
Rather than remain for 20 or
30 seconds more, about half the
students immediately rose from
their seats, and began to leave
the classroom, chattering away
as if they had just turned off a
television program.
I wonder how many others
heard our professor mutter, "Oh,
the devil with it!" His disgust at
such a snub is understandable,
for how would you feel if your
audience suddenly left you in the
middle of a sentence? Where
were these students headed in
such a hurry?
I seriously doubt that any had
appointments so important or
schedules so tight that they could
not have remained another min
ute. This type of behavior is un
becoming to anyone, and espe
cially to college students, since
we are supposedly old enough to
extend at least a few common
courtesies.
Let's be sure this instance of
rudeness is not repeated.
