# SRI Brews Coffee-Pot Tempest
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) —'The Pres
ident makes a casual remark. A
Cabinet officer answers a ques
tion—and then tosses in an extra
comment he probably intends for
an aside. Almost instantly t he
reverberations can become inter
national.
In no other spot on earth can
such small chatter produce such
large, sometimes almost terrify
ing, results.
Take the case of the substitute
coffee.
Begins at SRI
It began with tlie Stanford Re
search Institute, an outfit which
can hardly be described as giddy.

Institute officials signed a con-1
tract to do a study for the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee.
Their findings, in 100 calm
pages, carried this mild title:
"United States Foreign Policy:
Possible Nonmilitary Scientific
Developments and Their Poten
tial Impact on Foreign Policy
Problems of the United Stales."
Important as this is, it's not
the stuff of which headlines are
made.
Those Topics
A look at some of the topks
covered confirms the impression.
Air pollution through nuclear
tests "National boundaries are

fixed and well defined, but the
movement of air masses through
out the globe evades control and
identification."
Control of climate — "Experi
ments indicate that alterations of
weather are a definite possibil
ity."
Not until page 58 do you hit
what turned out to be the explo
sive.
Coffee Substitute
This page is devoted to synthet
ic or substitute coffee. Experi
ments have been going on, the re
port says, and maybe in a few
years, or a few months, a substi
tute will be found. Even then, the
institute said, it isn't possible to
predict whether the consumers
will care for it.
Well, all this was reported and
sent to coffee-growing countries.
Somehow— maybe because of
faulty translation some stories
left the impression not that the
U.S. government paid for the
study, which was true, but that it
was paying for the hunt for a
coffee substitute, which wasn't.
The reaction south of the bor
der was immediate and frantic.
Shocked Statements
The presidents of Colombia and
of Mexico viewed with consterna
tion. Ambassadors rushed around
worriedly. Foreign ministers con
sulted. They all must have felt
like the man who once had the
exclusive buggy whip franchise
for the Detroit area.
One conclusion, as put in a

news release: "The consequences
of the development of synthetic
coffpp on Latin-American econo
mies had been greatly exaggerat
ed in Latin-American circles."
So the coffee pot stopped boil
ing, although the disturbing
thought remains in coffee nations
that undoubtedly sometime a sub
stitute will be found.
