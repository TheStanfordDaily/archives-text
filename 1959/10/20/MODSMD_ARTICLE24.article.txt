... is that every time it comes
around term paper deadlines
are nearer.
Via this reference lo writing,
I'd like to direct your attention
to the October issue of Harper's
which contains a 66-page supple
ment on "Writing in America."
Some of today's most distin
guished writers and critics t«*ll
what they think is good and bad
about current American writ
ing, chiefly fiction.
Alfred Kazin leads off by dub
bing modern fiction writers and
their characters "The Alone Gen
eration." To Kazin today's novel
ists dwell on, and apparently in,
"an unimaginative universe
limited to the self and its de
tractors." He adds that there is a
"cowardess of style" and that so
many works are "thin."
Kazin discusses such novelists
as Norman Mailer, J. 1). Salinger,
Herbert Gold and Saul Bellow in
his sharp criticism.
Perhaps even more critical than
Kazin is Elizabeth Hardwick, wife
of poet Robert Lowell, in her re
view of book reviewing. Those for
whom the New York Times Book
Review can do no wrong will have
difficulty in getting through her
piece with an t even temper, which
is possibly all for the better be
cause it is the even temper of cur
rent book reviewing which she
assails.
She calls the New York Times
Book Review a "provincial lit
erary journal." Nor is she

merciful to tlx- Saturday Re
view which she says dropped
"Of Literature" for good
reason.
Archibald MacLeish finds it
difficult to justify a college
course in creative writing. In
stead, the young writer should
seek to talk with older writers, not
be "taught" by them in the class
room sense. lie also takes a poke
at San Francisco beatnik writing.
The supplement is rounded out
with discussions of Hollywood and
writing by Budd Schulberg,
poetry, television writing, literary
lecturing and a "Letter to a
Young Man About to Enter Pub
lishing."
Also in the October issue of
Harper's appropriately enough,
is a short story, "The Wolfer,"
by Stanford's Wallace Stegner.

Did you hear about the Stan
ford professor who got sick and
tired of the red tape connected
with building a house on Stanford
land? Even Ihe plants for the
yard had to be approved. Our
man submitted a list of plants
giving their Latin names, and the
list was approved. On it were
such things as Poison Oak.
