## PRESS BOX Black Saturday 
### 
Ah yes .... Another Black Saturday .... and once again Stanford
football fans are wondering how long this season will last. After
such a good start this year, Card grid aficionados were hoping that
maybe this year .... well anyway 1 guess it's that famous old ltay
Area maxim that will solve the problem once again—"Wait until
next year!"
What happened last Saturday?—is a question that every Stanford
supporter including Coach Jack Curtice is asking now. Do the boys
want 1o win? They certainly showed I hey did in the first quarter
against WSU going into the end of the half 13 point ahead. Sud
denly Cougar quarterback Mike A gee caught fire and passed his

way to a quick TD and State was
behind by six points. Stanford
started to retaliate but a Cougar
theivery of a Tribe QB Dick Nor
man pass seemed to jell the WSU
attack and "unjell" the Indians.
No one can take anything away
from the Cougars. Their line
opened up many good holes for
backs Keith Lincoln and Laßoy
Katli to romp through and usually
gave Agee enough time to pass.
The fine receiving of VVSII ends
Don Kllersick and Gail Cogdill—
who showed they were definitely
faster and more deceptive than
the Tribe defensive secondary in
making some spectacular catches
definitely helped the WSU
cause.
And last if not least, the great
overall play of the Monrovia
Flash, Keith Lincoln — who
showed that he was .just about
everything his Palousc Country
publicity agents said he was pre
season—was a great decider in
last Saturday's contest. Lincoln

totaled 145 yards—getting 84 yards rushing for a 6.5 yard per carry
average and 3 for 3 passes for 61 yards.
However, there were many people in the stands that thought that
especially in the last hall, the Indians made W'SU look like a Big
Ten All-Star Team and certainly the Cougars aren't that good.

supporter including Coach Jack Curtice is asking now. Do the boys
want 1o win? They certainly showed I hey did in the first quarter
against WSU going into the end of the half 13 point ahead. Sud
denly Cougar quarterback Mike A gee caught fire and passed his

way to a quick TD and State was
behind by six points. Stanford
started to retaliate but a Cougar
theivery of a Tribe QB Dick Nor
man pass seemed to jell the WSU
attack and "unjell" the Indians.
No one can take anything away
from the Cougars. Their line
opened up many good holes for
backs Keith Lincoln and Laßoy
Katli to romp through and usually
gave Agee enough time to pass.
The fine receiving of VVSII ends
Don Kllersick and Gail Cogdill—
who showed they were definitely
faster and more deceptive than
the Tribe defensive secondary in
making some spectacular catches
definitely helped the WSU
cause.
And last if not least, the great
overall play of the Monrovia
Flash, Keith Lincoln — who
showed that he was .just about
everything his Palousc Country
publicity agents said he was pre
season—was a great decider in
last Saturday's contest. Lincoln

totaled 145 yards—getting 84 yards rushing for a 6.5 yard per carry
average and 3 for 3 passes for 61 yards.
However, there were many people in the stands that thought that
especially in the last hall, the Indians made W'SU look like a Big
Ten All-Star Team and certainly the Cougars aren't that good.

Ah yes .... Another Black Saturday .... and once again Stanford
football fans are wondering how long this season will last. After
such a good start this year, Card grid aficionados were hoping that
maybe this year .... well anyway 1 guess it's that famous old ltay
Area maxim that will solve the problem once again—"Wait until
next year!"
