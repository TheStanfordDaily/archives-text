# Is There a Conflict?
## 
### 
What seemed to be the trouble? Is their a conflict on play calling
between Curtice and Norman? It seems shaky all right as for example
the repititious calling of pitchout right three times in a row which
was diagnosed by the Cougars after the first time the Tribe ran it.
It also seemed that there was a large amount of play calling from
the sideline by Curtice and also there might have been some con
flict in the coach's desire to stay on the ground although most "ex
perts" agree that Stanford's running attack is no great earth shaker
—and Norman's wish to pass. This of course is all just speculation
and certainly is not meant to be grandstand quarterbaeking.
No, I think that no one can say that the Stanford grid organization
does not want to win but it certainly looks like a disastrous weekend
coming up in the Coliseum this Saturday against the undefeated
USC Trojans.
Of course, the Indians cannot be counted out in the game for as
one Bay Area sports writer put it their inconsistant up and down
play and passing attack gives the Tribe a chance against anyone in
the Nation. Also, the Indians will be after their third win in a row
down in the Coliseum.
To top it all ex-Daily Sports Editor Steve Baffrey gives us some
sage advice. "In my own twisted mind I harbor the following
thoughts about this Saturday's jaunt to L.A.: (1 i Southern California
is the only team on the Coast, I feel, that doesn't think it can be
beaten. (2) Stanford, on the other hand is about the only team that
doesn't think it can win. <3» Something around 20-14, Stanford, is
bound to happen—Besides, upsetting USC is a Stanford tradition—
every so often." Well Steve you should get a lot of takers on your
bet ....
