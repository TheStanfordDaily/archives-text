# Pick a Winner
## 
### 
As the rest of the Sports Staff here moves ahead getting better
and better on the football game predictions this writer is taking giant
backward steps. Scraping by 8 and 8 wrong last week—which in
cludes Texas A&M's 6-39 "upset" over favored TC'U, Air Force over
Oregon, lowa over Wisconsin and many other wild mistakes—l hope
that somebody would send me a few winners so that at least it looks
like I can pick a few winners.
Some of the games that are on tap for this weekend could prove
1o be even more of a headache for we prognosticators. For example
try to figure out a winner for the Penn State-Illinois clash, the Wash
ington-Oregon game, or the lowa-Purdue fray.
If these game aren't enough just throw in Michigan State-Indiana
or Wisconsin-Ohio State. I'm just glad that this week's battle between
Muhlenberg and Gettysburg isn't on our list.
