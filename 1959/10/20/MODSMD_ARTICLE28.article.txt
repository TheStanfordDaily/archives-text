## Soccermen Lose; First '59 Defeat 
### 
If soccer games were 66 min
utes long, Stanford would possess
an unbeaten record in the North
ern California Intercollegiate Soc
cer Conference. Unfortunately for
the Indians, they last 88 minutes
and Stanford was beaten 2-1 by
City College of San Francisco on
Maloney Field Saturday.
Stanford held a 1-0 lead going
into the final quarter on the
strength of Mike Tippett's goal
in the first five minutes of the
game.
Lynch Scores
It looked as if the one goal
lead was going to stand up, but
CCSF forward Jim Lynch, who
had scored two of the three goals
in City College's victory over
USF, took matters into his own
hands, took advantage of a mixup
on defense, and slipped the ball
past goalie Hunt Bascom to tie
the game, with twenty minutes
left in the game.
A very few minutes later,
Lynch spotted a free ball directly
in front of the Stanford goal and
dribbled it in under Bascom's
lunge.
No More Goals
Stanford could not mount
another offensive and the 2-1
margin stood up as the final
score.
Inexperience was the main
cause of the defeat, said Coach
Fred Priddle after the game. The

lack of experienced reserve for
wards forced a tired and ineffec
tive center half Rune Engebretsen
to play almost the entire game.
Engebretsen's inability to play
up to his past performances made
it necessary for Bernie Knaggs
to partially cover both inside right
and center half, and as a result
the entire front line suffered in
effectiveness. Overall, however,
Knaggs played a creditable game.
Bascom and left half Wolfgang
Storch played their hearts out in
a futile attempt to bring a victory
home to the farm.
CCSF Ineligible
There is one consolation in
the loss. CCSF is not eligible to go
to the NCAA playoffs because
it is a two year college, so if it
wins the league championship the
second place team will go to the
playoffs.
In two preliminary games, Ihe
Stanford JV's were divided into
two groups, one of which was de
feated by CCSF 3-1 and the other
of which tied Polytechnic of San
Francisco 0-0.
Next Saturday at 11:00, Stan
ford will play San Francisco State
on the latter's field.
The next Indian home game
will be on Oct. 21 against Santa
Clara at 11 a.m.
That same day the Stanford
JV's play Mission High School in
a game beginning at 9:30 a.m.
