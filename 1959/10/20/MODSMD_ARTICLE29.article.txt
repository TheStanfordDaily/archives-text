# Cross-Country Team Victors Despite Heat, Two Opponents
## 
### 
Stanford's cross-country team
was hot Friday; almost too hot to
run, but hot.
The Indians braved the 90 de
gree heat and the smog at the
Stanford Golf Course lo win a
triangular affair against San
Jose State and Santa Clara
Youth Village. Final scores read:
Stanford 39, San Jose 46, and
Santa Clara 50.
The Card's Bob Monzingo took
first place as he panted across
the finish line of the three mile
course in the slow time of 14:59.5.
Keith Wallace came in second
about five seconds later.
The disappointing times can be
accounted for by either the fact
that it was the first meet of the
season or by the humidity.
Pulling out the third and fourth
spots among the 37 participants
were Santa Clara's Ned Sargent
and Merle McGee in times of
15:07 and 15:10. Charlie Clark
and Sam Holt grabbed fifth and
sixth for San Jose in 15:14 and
15:18.
After this the judges had to
wait nearly a minute and a half
for another runner to appear in
the person of Stanford's Bertil

Lundh, who took seventh place
with a time of 16:30.
For the Indians Ernie Cunliffe
took 10th, Kim Maxwell 31th, and
John Northway 15th.
The next meet is Saturday in
Los Angeles against SC, UCLA,
and Air Force harriers.
