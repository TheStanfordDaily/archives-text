## 
### Rick Walker 
A vastly improved Stanford
wator polo learn lost its second
meet of tho year Saturday morn
ing to San Jose State 1813 before
a handful of loyal fans who
turned out to see the Indians
first polo team in four years. The
meet was in direct contrast to
last Friday's disastrous encounter
with Cal when the Indians were
swamped 23 5.
Stanford was very much in the
game throughout ihe first half
and led by one point midway
through the second period. But a
fresh San Jose platoon led by
Roger Scaife proved too much for
the tiring Indians and they fell
behind 5-8 at the half.
Four Straight
San Jose opened the third
period with four straight goals,
but the Indians countered with
five in the later half of the period
against the San Jose's second
team.
The score remained close
throughout the last period, and
with 2 minutes to play, Stanford
trailed by only 2 points. At this
juncture San Jose scored with a
tremendous shot from 10 feet out
by Mike 80/./o, making the score
13-16. Seconds later Stanford goal
guard John Bates was called out
of the game on a foul.
Another Quickie
The Spartans then scored
another fast one with "PL> minutes
left, followed by still another on
a foul shot off of Jack Lorton.
When George Harrison left the
game with 1 minute to play,
Stanford's chances were ended,
and the score stayed at 18-13.

Despite the loss, Coach Haynie
seemed quite pleased with the
progress his team had made since
the Cal meet the week before.
Against San Jose the team was
breaking well, both on offense
aiid defense. In many cases Stan
ford showed good anticipation, the
mark of a seasoned polo team.
However, Stanford will be
caller! upon to display all its
talents this coming weekend as
they travel south to meet UCLA
and SC. The Trojans in particular
are touted to have a strong team,
filled with many Southland high
school water polo stars, not to
mention two players off of
Hungary's 1956 Olympic water
polo team.
USC and Cal are rated by many
as the top collegiate water polo
teams in the nation. Stanford's
southern trip will be a good in
dication of how much improve
ment has taken place.
