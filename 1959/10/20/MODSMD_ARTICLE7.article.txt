## IFC Move Marks End Of Era 
### Steve Baffrey 
Stan for d ' s Interfraternity
Council late last night passed a
unanimous resolution to "outlaw
on the Stanford campus all forms
of fraternity hell weeks and haz
ing in contradiction to the Cali
fornia state law, Stanford Uni
versity policies, or basic human
dignity."
Thus, it appears, the end of an
era has been brought about
through the common sense of the
only people who could recommend
and strictly enforce such a policy.
IFC President George Ingham,
immediately following the brief
but to-the-point meeting, stated
the Council's hope "that with the
passing of this resolution any
future reoccurance of the un
fortunate incidents which have
occurred on other campuses will
be avoided at Stanford."
Permits Hitual
The resolution permits, as does
state law and University policy,
formal initiation and ritual which
is not of a physically harmful or
degrading nature. It also permits
those houses that hold "help
weeks" in which new members
are required to aid local charities
and service groups to go on with
these programs.
The new California law, passed
this summer, outlaws "any
method of initiation into a stu
dent organization or any pastime
or amusement engaged in with
respect to such an organization
which causes, or is likely to cause,
bodily danger or physical harm
to any student or other person."
The law further defines hazing
as "any act that injures, de
grades or disgraces or tends (to
do any of the above)."
Against Hazing
University policy has for a num
ber of years been against, hazing
and hell weeks as against any
form of physical abuse coincident
with the joining of such a social
organization.
When told of the Council's ac
tion, Dean of Men William Craig
said, "'IFC is to be congratulated.
This action marks a real step for
ward and ranks with its actions of
two years ago aimed at abolish
ing discriminatory clauses."
The Dean felt that the Stanford
Council had now taken action on
the two greatest complaints
people have against fraternities.
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler, when contacted by the
Daily late last night said, "I have
just learned of the IFC action
and would like to commend IFC
for its forthright position."
