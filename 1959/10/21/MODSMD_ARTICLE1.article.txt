cial three-man fact-finding panel
reported it could see no immedi
ate end to the strike through vol
untary negotiations.
The union and the basic steel
industry have been negotiating
off and on since May 5. They're
still far apart on the basic issues

Judge Herbert P. Sorg recessed court shortly before 6 p.m. until
this morning. The government and the United Steelworkers

Union had completed their argu
ments.
"Unless the strike is enjoined,"
the government said, "the United
States of America will suffer im
mediate and irreparable injury."
The petition named the United
Steelworkers and 97 steel com
panies as defendants.
Unions Deny Danger
The union's counter petition ar
gued that the walkout does not
now endanger the country's econ
omy as interpreted under the
Taft-Hartley act.
David J. McDonald, Steelwork
ers president, had said the union
would obey a back-to-work in
junction. But he also said an ad
verse decision would be appealed
to higher federal courts, the U.S.
Supreme Court if necessary.
Since the strike started July 13
in a new contract dispute, some
250,000 workers in steel-related
industries have been laid off. The
figure, according to government
experts, can be expected to mush
room in tiie next few weeks.
Bargaining Would Continue
During the period of an in
junction, the union and steel com
panies would be required to con
tinue collective bargaining with
the help of federal mediators.
Eisenhower instructed the U.S.
attorney general's office Monday
to .seek an injunction after a spe
cial three-man fact-finding panel
reported it could see no immedi
ate end to the strike through vol
untary negotiations.
The union and the basic steel
industry have been negotiating
off and on since May 5. They're
still far apart on the basic issues
of wages and contract work rules.
