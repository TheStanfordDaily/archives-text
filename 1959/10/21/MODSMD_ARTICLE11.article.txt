# NO-DOZ COMPETITION
## Insomnia Cure Gets Firm Endorsement 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
Have trouble sleeping these
days? Maybe you're a confirmed
insomniac now that mid-terms
are about here. Well then, buy a
Chaparral today on Quad —it's
guaranteed to knock No-Do/, all
to pieces. This mag is a real ho
hum-er.
The "Welcome Back" issue of
the Stanford Chaparral includes
(for 35 cents — nearly 34 more
than it's worth) the same tired
references to the curve, high tui
tion, the ABC, over-paid southern
California athletes and The Will
that have characterized Chappies
from time immemorial, although
this reporter can't say for sure,
not being as old as the Litte Men
must be who have resurrected
| this issue's material.
Cash Register
Naturally, the Quad gets its
I annual architectural redo, but
this time, rather than a race
track, bookie joint or a eollossal
computing machine, the boys re
organize the place into a gigantic
cash register. This particular
article "Stanford's 25-Year
Plan" is especially nixworthy
from the standpoint of anyone
looking for respite from a dull
I textbook. It can't compete with
Errol Flynn's love letters to his
"Woodsie," available in a San
Francisco paper for much less
than the Chappie.
Flynn's teen-ager reminds us
that one good tiling (if that rash
statement can be allowed here) in
what is repeatedly claimed, hut
rarely shown, to be one of the
nation's best campus humor

mags, is the Frosh Queen, who
shall remain nameless here so
the Chappie's few readers can get
at least one gqocl yuk. She ap
pears in some costumes (and
poses) that Women's Social Reg
ulations wouldn't condone on
Quad, or on a date, for that mat
ter.
Tip for 4 K'
A few of the short subjects
treated do bring one a few
chuckles. In fact, Kartozian
might pick up on a couple of ihe
"New Songs and Yells" for per
formance in the south this week
end, far from the ears of deans.
After reading this "Welcome
Back" publication, this reporter
was indeed welcomed back—by
his chiropractor. The physical
strain involved in seeking out a
possible funny on the inside cover
montage resulted in a dislocated
collar bone.
So, if you can't sleep tonight,
get hold of a copy of the Chapar
ral from a nearby garbage can,
and soon you'll slumber away.
Remember, going to sleep with
the Chappie is almost as exciting
as going to sleep with the "Bul
letin of Courses and Degrees."

might pick up on a couple of ihe
"New Songs and Yells" for per

end, far from the ears of deans.
After reading this "Welcome
Back" publication, this reporter
was indeed welcomed back—by
his chiropractor. The physical
strain involved in seeking out a
possible funny on the inside cover
montage resulted in a dislocated
collar bone.
So, if you can't sleep tonight,
get hold of a copy of the Chapar
ral from a nearby garbage can,
and soon you'll slumber away.
Remember, going to sleep with
the Chappie is almost as exciting
as going to sleep with the "Bul
letin of Courses and Degrees."
Have trouble sleeping these
days? Maybe you're a confirmed
insomniac now that mid-terms
are about here. Well then, buy a
Chaparral today on Quad —it's
guaranteed to knock No-Do/, all
to pieces. This mag is a real ho
hum-er.
The "Welcome Back" issue of
the Stanford Chaparral includes
(for 35 cents — nearly 34 more
than it's worth) the same tired
references to the curve, high tui
tion, the ABC, over-paid southern
California athletes and The Will
that have characterized Chappies
from time immemorial, although
this reporter can't say for sure,
not being as old as the Litte Men
must be who have resurrected
| this issue's material.
Cash Register
Naturally, the Quad gets its
I annual architectural redo, but
this time, rather than a race
track, bookie joint or a eollossal
computing machine, the boys re
organize the place into a gigantic
cash register. This particular
article "Stanford's 25-Year
Plan" is especially nixworthy
from the standpoint of anyone
looking for respite from a dull
I textbook. It can't compete with
Errol Flynn's love letters to his
"Woodsie," available in a San
Francisco paper for much less
than the Chappie.
Flynn's teen-ager reminds us
that one good tiling (if that rash
statement can be allowed here) in
what is repeatedly claimed, hut
rarely shown, to be one of the
nation's best campus humor

mags, is the Frosh Queen, who
shall remain nameless here so
the Chappie's few readers can get
at least one gqocl yuk. She ap
pears in some costumes (and
poses) that Women's Social Reg
ulations wouldn't condone on
Quad, or on a date, for that mat
ter.
Tip for 4 K'
A few of the short subjects
treated do bring one a few
chuckles. In fact, Kartozian
