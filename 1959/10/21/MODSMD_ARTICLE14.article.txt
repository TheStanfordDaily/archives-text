# Axe Society Holds Tryouts This Week
## 
### 
Tryouts for membership in the
Stanford Axe Society will be held
today and tomorrow at Bowman
Alumni House, according to Axo
Society publicity chairman Don
Roemer.
Roomer emphasized the fact
that members of all classes —not
merely freshmen and transfers —
are invited to try out for the
group. Interviews arc scheduled
for 3-5 and 7-8:30 p.m. today and
2-4 p.m. tomorrow, all in the
Historical Room of Bowman. Stu
dents interested are asked to sign
up for an appointment time on
lists posted at the ASSU Office.
The Axe Society is now en
gaged in formulating plans for
Big Game Week activities. Cam
pus functions such at last year's
"Bury the Bear" funeral proces
sion and services will be carried
out by society members.
In addition to these activities,
Axe Society members are re
sponsible for the safe transporta
tion of the Stanford Axe from the
stadium to its Cellar display case,
"after an Indian win," said Roe
mer.
The recent new student Activi
ties Day was held under the Axe
Society sponsorship to acquaint
incoming students with campus
organizations and their functions.
