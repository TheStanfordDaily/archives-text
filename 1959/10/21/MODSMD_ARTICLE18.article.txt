# IFC Moves Again
## 
### 
Interfratermtv Council is to he highlv commended, we believe,
for ils action Monday in moving to abolish undesirable forms of
hazing and hell weeks at Stanford.
doming on the heels of plans for a new fralernilv'-administra
tion board, it appears that the present IFC., under the leadership
of Cap Ingham, will he among the most progressive and straight
thinking of recent councils.
Though 1 F(:*s banning of degrading hazing and hell weeks might
seem superfluous in view of existing state law and I'niversity poli
cies, the action is in reality most significant.
If IFC did not put a ban on these activities, they could slill
continue in secrecy and remain for the most part undetected. The
University or state might find out about isolated incidents and
mete out after-the-fact punishment. But with the houses them
selves opposed to hazing and hell weeks, these will be eliminated
before they start.
This elimination, of course, is what is desired, not merely sanc
tions against some house AFTFK one of its pledges chokes on raw
liver or is hospitalized after a healing.
Fraternities on all campuses presently find themselves the tar
gets of plenty of raised eyebrows from the public. IFC's action
should help convince this public that, at least at Stanford, frater
nities are honestlv concerned with raising their own standards and
making more positive contributions to University life.
\\ e hope now that the rank and file of fraternity members will
give 100 per cent support to IFC's decision in order that occur
rences of the type at USC and California will not occur here.
