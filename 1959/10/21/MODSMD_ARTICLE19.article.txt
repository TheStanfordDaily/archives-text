### Mary Lou McKinley 
For some of us, the number one
event this weekend will be the
SC game and all related subjects.
But for those who aren't planning
on being part of the exodus to the
southland, there are many events
in the Bay Area which won't
make for bad consolation.
If a trip to the City is what
you'd like, an enjoyable eve
ning can he spent at the Geary
Theater where "A MIGHTY
MAN IS HE" is in the middle of
its three-week run.
Although the "mighty man" of
the title never appears, he is
never missed, as Nancy Kelly pro
vides all the "might" necessary
for a very funny show.
In fact, her talents as a come
dienne and an actress are certain
ly "might" enough for us to pass
over the show's several weak
spots.
As the understanding life
with a sense of humor, Miss
Kelly has a good supporting
cast participating in the fast
paced marital merry-go-round.
Written by Arthur Kober, the
pre-Broadway comedy is directed
by Reginald Denham who also
staged one of Miss Kelly's great
est successes, "The Bad Seed."
Tickets are variably priced,
with matinees held on Wednes
days and Fridays.
One of the dependably good
Actor's Workshop productions,
"THE BUSY MARTYR" is play
ing at the Encore Theater,
Mason off Geary, on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday nights.
Tickets for the comedy, by
George Hitchcock, are priced at
$1.85 and $2.75.
"Our Town," the now classic
play by Thornton Wilder which
follows the youth, marriage, and,
finally, death of several of the
citizens of a small town, is being
presented at the Belle Union
Theater, Kearny at Washington,
Fridays and Saturdays at 8:30
p.m.
And for a complete change of
pace, the wonderfully fun musical
comedy, "Damn Yankees," will
open tomorrow night at 8:40 p.m.
at the San Francisco Opera Ring,
123 S. Van Ness Ave. To play
Thursdays and Fridays, the show
is staged in-the-round. All seats
are $2.
If you've decided by now to
see one of the evening shows, :
why not "do it up in the high
Roman fashion" and have din
ner at "THE RITZ OLD POO
DLE DOG" the City's oldest
French restaurant, at 65 Post
Street, only about five blocks
from the Geary and Cur ran
Theaters.
With elegant atmosphere and
delicious food, the "Poodle Dog"
has grown up and changed with
San Francisco. The first one,
established in the Gold Rush days,

was reportedly named, "Poulet
d'Or," but free translation by the
'49ers soon changed this to its
present one.
Dinners range from $3.50 to
$4.75. And if you've forgotten to
make reservations at SU 1-1919,
the head waiter will do his best
to find you a table and see that
you make it to the show on time.
If you're a fan of the classic
! guitar, you might go to the
I Veterans' Auditorium Friday
night when KAY DE LA
TORRE, outstanding in his
field, gives his first San Fran
cisco concert. Tickets are on
sale at Sherman, Clay and Co.,
priced from $1.66 to $3.
An outstanding dance event will
! he presented Saturday and Sun
day nights and Sunday afternoon
at the San Francisco Opera House
where Inbal, the National 'Dance
Theater of Israel, will present a
unique program of Yemenite
dances and music from the old
world. Tickets are still available
from $2 to $4.50.
In Palo Alto this weekend, the
West Bay Opera company will
open its fourth major season with
a double program.
The first two acts of Richard
Wagner's "THE F LYING
DUTCHMAN" and the complete
production of "COMEDY ON
THE BRIDGE" by Bohuslav
Martinu in English will he pre
sented Friday and Saturday
nights at 8:15 p.m. at the Com
munity Theater, Middlcfiehl and
Melville.
Musical Director for the com
pany is Henry Ilolt who also di
rected the music for last year's
Stanford Players' production of
"lolanthe." Gene Chesley, grad
uate student in the Speech and
Drama Department who has
worked with many Stanford Play
ers' shows, is production director.
Singing the lead role in "The
Flying Dutchman," which is, ac
cording to Chesley, the most am
bitious thing the company has
attempted so far, will he Dan Taft
of San Francisco. In the second
show on the program, Ethel Brad
ford, Ramona Grim, and Tony
Cuevas will star, all of whom
were in the company's production
of "Gianni Schicchi" last year.
The operas are done "full
scale" with complete settings
and costumes and are more than
worth the small price of $2 per
ticket.
This weekend's shows will be
followed on Feb. 18-21 with the
complete performance of Mozart's
"The Marriage of Figaro" and on
May 20,21 with Puccini's "Sister
Angelica" and Act One of Verdi's
"The Masked Ball."
Subscription tickets for the
series also are on sale for $5
and can be obtained at DA 5-4381
or by writing Box 231, Palo Alto.
