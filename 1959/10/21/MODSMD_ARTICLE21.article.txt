### Rich Sundeen ASSU President 
As was stated in last week's
column, Legislature invited Dr.
Chester Berry, the Stanford Un
ion Director, to speak Oct. 15.
Before coming to Stanford Berry
served as Director of Student Ac
tivities, which included the direc
torship of a college union at the
University of Rhode Island.
Presently, h<> is national presi
dent of the Association of Col
lege Unions. Berry thus comes
to us with a wealth of know
ledge and experiences in tlx*
field of college unions.
In his talk Berry outlined the
purpose of college unions. lie
pointed out how each university
has its own particular needs and
demands from its respective col
lege union.
In order to ascertain what Stan
ford's specific needs are and in
what way our college union can
satify them, Berry proposed that
Legislature form an ad hoc. com
mittee of students to work with
him and the permanent Stanford
Union Committee, comprised of
students and faculty.
Such a siiident committee
would give reciprocal communi
cation between tlie students and
the standing committee. At
present 1 believe this student
committee, known as the stu
dent board for the college un
ion, will he broken up into vari
ous subcommittees in order to
study and investigate particular
areas of program and service,
such as activities and food and
service facilities.
From their findings the hoard's
subcommittees will formulate
the college union organization and
proposed programs which will
ultimately determine Hie actual
physical make up of the union.

I In order to begin work as soon
jas possible we have selected a
I small group of students who have
shown an interest in contributing
! some of their time to such a proj
| ect, to form the primary nucleus
for Ihe Legislature's ad hoc col-
I lege union board.
This student board will sub
sequently b:* comprised of over
100 members and will include a
largfe cross section of the slu
deiif body in order to obtain a
maximum of campus opinion.
Finally, as planning and orga
nizational stages crystallize and
the Stanford College Union be
comes a reality in organization
and structure this student board
will probably become the ASSU
i College Union Board. The student
! responsibilities of the actual oper
ation of the college union would
; be delegated to this Board.
As one can see, the proposed
college union involves much
work and several interested stu
dents.
I hope many of you will want
lo volunteer your time and efforts
and thereby aid in making this
dream of the past, a reality of the
near furl lire. If you are interested
I in becoming a member of this stu-
I dent board for the college union,
| please come to Bowman Alumni
House tomorrow at 9 p.m.
The functions of the board will
then be explained by Berry and
student representatives of the
permanent Stanford Union Com
mittee.
