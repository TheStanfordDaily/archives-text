Foreign Opinion
Editor, TliÂ«' Daily:
Would it not be possible 1o
establish a regular single or
double column in The Stanford
Daily as an organ for foreign stu
dent opinion? This column would

be edited by an independent
"Foreign Student Editor" in col
laboration with the staff ol The
Daily.
Ray B. Coiichman,
English Foreign Scholar.
Editor's Note: Present out
lt'ls for foreign student opinion
exist both in the Letters col
umns of The Daily and in the
Bridge, a quarterly campus
magazine composed of inter
pretive and commentary arti
cles written by foreign students.
