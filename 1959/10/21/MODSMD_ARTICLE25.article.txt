11 is this current state of panic that is around us that has mo a bit
baffled right now.
Kvidently, everybody thinks the best thing for Stanford's foot
ball team to do right now is resign. All this because the Cards lost a
game they were supposed to win. This, I must admit, is a rarity,
but then how many times in the past two seasons has the Tribe
been favored?
One of the San Francisco papers proclaimed Monday in nice, black
headlines: "Indians Facing I!) Season."
Then somebody else said "probably Stanford's sorriest showing in
two years." Now we're really getting ridiculous.
In the first place, 1 can name at least six sorrier instances last
season. Most prominent of which would probably he the game with
Washington State. That was quite a brutal afternoon for the Tribe,
which managed one touchdown by recovering a fumble in the end
/one and was literally trampled while the Cougars rang up a pain
fully easy 10 points.
Then there were the Rico game, Northwestern game, Air Force
game, Southern California game and the Oregon game. Three of
those were scoreless days for the Tribe.
Stanford scored If) points Saturday. Only twice last year did the
Indians reach thai point 22 in the win over Washington, and 21
in the other win, over I'CI.A.
WSI got some fantastic performances Saturday. The pass receiv
ing shows of Gail Gogdill, Don Fllorsick and Pete Selienck leaping
and grabbing were one you just don't see every Saturday after
noon. Keith Lincoln was too much for words. It seems now altogether
possible that the Cougars may keep right on rolling the rest of the
year, and clobber quite a few foes as they did the Tribe.
Jus! Our l>;i<l Showing
As for this 1-9 season business everybody seems to forget the
Tribe's first four games. In spite of a modest 21-(> decision as the
only victory in the four, Stanford still outscored its combined op
ponents.
The four touchdowns against Oregon must bo some sort of a
modern record. Wisconsin admittedly was lucky to beat the Injuns.
The Kadgers have been romping merrily away since then, and
dumped lowa last Saturday. Washington, fresh off a .">!-(> victory,
scored one touchdown against Stanford. Last week against IJSC, the
Huskies got two.
It really hasn't been so bad at all. So please don't throw away your i
tickets yet.
I think that there are not two college ends in the land that 1
would trade for two who cavorted in the stadium Saturday Chris
lturlord and Gail Cogdill.
The Cougar players had nothing but praise and admiration for
Kurford. "What makes him so good?" asked one of their defensive
hacks, "lie looks awkward and slow â€”but he's great!"
Record time? Incidentally, did you know that there wore 10 touch- i
downs scored in the Stadium Saturday? That might be a record. It
even tops the day in 1949 when the Cards nipped Idaho 63-0 and the
Braves walked on the San Francisco State JY's, Kill.
I'oor Quizzing. I imagine Howie Dalhuar sympathizes with the
Stanford College Bowl team. We just can't win on the road.
Maybe wo weren't "up" for that intersoctional. More likely it is
just another case of the inferior band of quiz games played on the
Pacific Coast.
1 had alw ays heard Colorado was a party school. 1 missed I lie
show myself. Maybe, as sports editor John Schwarz suggested, Colo
rado won bv reciting all the words on the Budweiser beer can.
