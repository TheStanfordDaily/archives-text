Tho University of Southern
California is far and away tho
toughest team that Stanford's
football squad will have to face
this season. It's as easy as that.
Tho undefeated Trojans are
currently ranked as the fifth best
team in the nation by the Associ
ated Press, and an Indian win
Saturday in the Coliseum would
be the major upset of the 19.")9
campaign.
The USC personnel is, to say
the very least, impressive. As a
case in point take a look at the
Trojan quarterback situation.
YVood Injured

Wood had the inside track on the
starting signal calling position
and was being touted as a possi
ble All-American candidate. In

injury and only last week re
turned to the line-up.
But even though he missed two
games he is still the top scoring
quarterback for SC and has
moved the ball at an average clip
of f>.4 yards per play.
Wood's top replacement A 1
Prukop has filled in brilliantly
for tho injured star directing two
scoring drives and completing 7
of 18 passes.

person of Ben Charles is the
Trojans top passer. Competing 8
of 13 attempts, Charles has
gained 191 yards through tho air
for a fine average of 1 1 yards
per pass.

scoring marches and lias directed
the team at an average of
yards per play.

Tho University of Southern
California is far and away tho
toughest team that Stanford's
football squad will have to face
this season. It's as easy as that.
Tho undefeated Trojans are
currently ranked as the fifth best
team in the nation by the Associ
ated Press, and an Indian win
Saturday in the Coliseum would
be the major upset of the 19.")9
campaign.
The USC personnel is, to say
the very least, impressive. As a
case in point take a look at the
Trojan quarterback situation.
YVood Injured
As the season began Willie
Wood had the inside track on the
starting signal calling position
and was being touted as a possi
ble All-American candidate. In
SC's second game against Pitt,
however, Wood suffered a hack
injury and only last week re
turned to the line-up.
But even though he missed two
games he is still the top scoring
quarterback for SC and has
moved the ball at an average clip
of f>.4 yards per play.
Wood's top replacement A 1
Prukop has filled in brilliantly
for tho injured star directing two
scoring drives and completing 7
of 18 passes.
Still another signal caller in the
person of Ben Charles is the
Trojans top passer. Competing 8
of 13 attempts, Charles has
gained 191 yards through tho air
for a fine average of 1 1 yards
per pass.

Charles has also directed four
scoring marches and lias directed
the team at an average of
yards per play.
