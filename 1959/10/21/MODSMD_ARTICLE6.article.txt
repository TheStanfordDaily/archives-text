# Mardikian: Faith Key To Success
## 
### Daryl Glenney 
George Mardikian, world-re
knowned owner of the "Omar
Khayyam'' restaurants, last night
gave an appreciative Stanford
audience the "recipe" for success:
faith in one's self, faith in Ameri
ca, and faith in God.
Sponsored by the Institute of
International Relations in con
junction with United Nations
Week, Mardikian spoke at the
Tuesday Evening Series on his
recent book, "Song of America,"
written as the "outcome of a sup
pressed desire to tell people born
here why they should get on their I
knees every morning and thank
God for America."
Cites Experience
Mardikian cited his first ex
periences in the United States as
proof that America is "the land
of opportunity." A 19-year-old
Armenian immigrant, Mardikian j
was introduced to the American j
people by his sister and brother- â€¢
in-law in San Francisco. He de- j
cided they were all crazy.
But it was then that Mardikian
set his goal: to become the!
craziest American of them all. He !
began with a $12 a week job as a
dishwasher. Fifteen years later
he opened tlie first "Omar Khay
yam" in Fresno, following his
"success recipe" despite the de
pression.
'Melting Pot'
"America's greatness lies in the
fact that it is the melting pot of
all peoples," Mardikian told last
night's audience. "Policemen say
ing 'Good morning,' workers
jumping on the streetcars to go
to work, garbage men singing
'Santa Lucia,' milkmen trustingly
leaving their goods on the porch
this is the Song of America."
"My greatest wish," Mardikian |
said, "is to make an American
understand what it is like not to j
be an American; what it is like to
one moment belong with one's
ancestors to a million dead yester
days, and the next moment be
long with Americans to a million
unborn tomorrows."
Mardikian donated his speak- j
er's honorarium to Stanford's j
World University Service drive. I
