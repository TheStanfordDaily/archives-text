# USW Gain Stay Of T-H Mandate

PITTSBURGH (/J J > A U.S. dis
trict judge yesterday ordered the
record 99-day steel strike halted
temporarily. But the strike rolled
on as an appellate judge delayed
execution of the Taft-Hartley
edict.
Judge Austin Staley of the U.S.

Third Circuit Court of Appeals
granted the striking United Steel
workers Union a stay of the or
der until this morning.
That meant no reopening of
mills and pickets continued on
duty. He said the Taft-Hartley
injunction would become effec
tive then unless the union asks
a full three-member Third Cir
cuit Court panel in Philadelphia
for a further stay pending formal
hearing of the union's appeal.
Arthur J. Goldberg. USVV gen
eral counsel, said he would be be
fore the court at 10 a.m.
Judge Staley said the union
had challenged the constitution
ality of a section of the Taft-Hart
ley Act granting courts the right
to ban strikes.
According to the union, this
section empowers the courts to
issue injunctions against an act
legal in itself â€” the right to
strike.
The Philadelphia jurist acted
within an hour after Judge Her
bert P. Sorg of the U.S. District
Court here issued a permanent
injunction banning steel strike
activity for 80 days.
Government attorneys, acting
on instructions from President
Eisenhower, sought the injunc
tion on grounds the strike was
endangering the nation's eco
nomic health and safety.
The union vigorously opposed
the government request, contend
ing the strike has not caused any
national emergency.
Under the Taft-Hartley Act,
both sides are required to con
tinue collective bargaining dur
ing the life ol an injunction.
