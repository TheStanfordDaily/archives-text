The attempts to settle the steel
strike by mediation have failed
and the President will now have
to seek an injunction under the
Taft-Hartley Act.
This is the only course open
to liiin under existing law,
given the fact that he followed
the advice of those who told
him early last summer to stand
aside, to do nothing, and to
let the strike run its course as
a demonstration of "free bar
gaining."
This advice came to him, no
doubt indirectly, from the leaders
of the steel industry who thought,
mistakenly as it turned out, that
they had the union at a disad
vantage, that they could defeat
the strike and impose a settle
ment upon the union.
Having decided not to inter
vene, the administration did no
thing to elucidate and define the
issues. It did nothing to rally
public opinion in favor of a good
settlement.
Nobody, not the companies or
the unions or the administra
tion, wishes to see the Taft-
Hartley Act invoked. The Act
provides that for 80 days the
strike shall he suspended, and
that before 75 days have passed
the workers shall vote on the
latest offer from management.
If they reject this offer, they
can go on strike again on the
80th day. This will take us into
the first weeks of January. As
things stand now, in all proba
bility there will be no settlement
by that time unless meanwhile
there has been built up a body of
public opinion demanding a settle
ment which will find expression
in the next session of Congress.
Thus the Act provides that
the Board of Inquiry shall make
a statement which "shall not
contain any recommendations."
At the end, then, of the 80-day
intermission the strike can he
resumed without any impartial
and responsible judgment as to
how il ought to hi* settled.
Senator Taft recognized that
this was a serious limitation, and
after the Act has been passed
he did in fact attempt to have it
amended to permit the Board of
Inquiry to recommend a settle
ment.
He was not able to induce Con
gress to amend the law. But what
he really counted on, as Mr.

Joseph A. Loftus of the New York
Times reminds us, is this.
If a strike go on and
there is a national emerg
ency —as there is in steel —then
Senator Taft expected Congress
to intervene and to pass an
emergency act to deal with the
particular situation.
This is what the country should
now prepare for. During the com
ing weeks, while the strike is
suspended by injunction but is
not settled, the President and the
leaders of Congress should confer
on special legislation to be en
acted by the Congress.
In one way or another this
legislation would compel a satis
factory settlement. The threat of
this legislation offers the best
promise of a voluntary settle
ment.
It is interesting and one hopes
it is significant of a change in
administration policy that the
Secretary of Labor, Mr. Mitch
ell, has in the past few days
proposed that there should be
statutory authority to set up
fact-finding boards independent
of the Taft-Hartley Act pro
cedure.
This is a marked advance from
the President's position of last
July. But it does not go far
enough. The statutory boards
should have authority not only
to find the facts but to mediate
and to make recommendations on
the basis of what they learned in
mediating.
This is short of compulsory
arbitration. But as a next step
it may be near enough to be ef
fective. For in the case of a
stubborn and dangerous strike,
like this one in steel, an official
recommendation for settlement
could not be rejected without
running the risk that Congress
would then take the next step,
and compel arbitration.
In any event, since we have
to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act
which we know is inadequate,
(lie thing to do, it seems to me,
is to reinforce it at once —on
the principle that Senator Taft
had in mind.
This is to notify the warring
parties that the next move—if
they refuse to agree — will be
legislation by the President and
the Congress.

Joseph A. Loftus of the New York
Times reminds us, is this.
If a strike go on and
there is a national emerg
ency —as there is in steel —then
Senator Taft expected Congress
to intervene and to pass an
emergency act to deal with the
particular situation.
This is what the country should
now prepare for. During the com
ing weeks, while the strike is
suspended by injunction but is
not settled, the President and the
leaders of Congress should confer
on special legislation to be en
acted by the Congress.
In one way or another this
legislation would compel a satis
factory settlement. The threat of
this legislation offers the best
promise of a voluntary settle
ment.
It is interesting and one hopes
it is significant of a change in
administration policy that the
Secretary of Labor, Mr. Mitch
ell, has in the past few days
proposed that there should be
statutory authority to set up
fact-finding boards independent
of the Taft-Hartley Act pro
cedure.
This is a marked advance from
the President's position of last
July. But it does not go far
enough. The statutory boards
should have authority not only
to find the facts but to mediate
and to make recommendations on
the basis of what they learned in
mediating.
This is short of compulsory
arbitration. But as a next step
it may be near enough to be ef
fective. For in the case of a
stubborn and dangerous strike,
like this one in steel, an official
recommendation for settlement
could not be rejected without
running the risk that Congress
would then take the next step,
and compel arbitration.
In any event, since we have
to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act
which we know is inadequate,
(lie thing to do, it seems to me,
is to reinforce it at once —on
the principle that Senator Taft
had in mind.
This is to notify the warring
parties that the next move—if
they refuse to agree — will be
legislation by the President and
the Congress.

The attempts to settle the steel
strike by mediation have failed
and the President will now have
to seek an injunction under the
Taft-Hartley Act.
This is the only course open
to liiin under existing law,
given the fact that he followed
the advice of those who told
him early last summer to stand
aside, to do nothing, and to
let the strike run its course as
a demonstration of "free bar
gaining."
This advice came to him, no
doubt indirectly, from the leaders
of the steel industry who thought,
mistakenly as it turned out, that
they had the union at a disad
vantage, that they could defeat
the strike and impose a settle
ment upon the union.
Having decided not to inter
vene, the administration did no
thing to elucidate and define the
issues. It did nothing to rally
public opinion in favor of a good
settlement.
Nobody, not the companies or
the unions or the administra
tion, wishes to see the Taft-
Hartley Act invoked. The Act
provides that for 80 days the
strike shall he suspended, and
that before 75 days have passed
the workers shall vote on the
latest offer from management.
If they reject this offer, they
can go on strike again on the
80th day. This will take us into
the first weeks of January. As
things stand now, in all proba
bility there will be no settlement
by that time unless meanwhile
there has been built up a body of
public opinion demanding a settle
ment which will find expression
in the next session of Congress.
Thus the Act provides that
the Board of Inquiry shall make
a statement which "shall not
contain any recommendations."
At the end, then, of the 80-day
intermission the strike can he
resumed without any impartial
and responsible judgment as to
how il ought to hi* settled.
Senator Taft recognized that
this was a serious limitation, and
after the Act has been passed
he did in fact attempt to have it
amended to permit the Board of
Inquiry to recommend a settle

and the President will now have
to seek an injunction under the
Taft-Hartley Act.
This is the only course open
to liiin under existing law,
given the fact that he followed
the advice of those who told
him early last summer to stand
aside, to do nothing, and to
let the strike run its course as
a demonstration of "free bar
gaining."
This advice came to him, no
doubt indirectly, from the leaders
of the steel industry who thought,
mistakenly as it turned out, that
they had the union at a disad
vantage, that they could defeat
the strike and impose a settle
ment upon the union.
Having decided not to inter
vene, the administration did no
thing to elucidate and define the
issues. It did nothing to rally
public opinion in favor of a good
settlement.
Nobody, not the companies or
the unions or the administra
tion, wishes to see the Taft-
Hartley Act invoked. The Act
provides that for 80 days the
strike shall he suspended, and
that before 75 days have passed
the workers shall vote on the
latest offer from management.
If they reject this offer, they
can go on strike again on the
80th day. This will take us into
the first weeks of January. As
things stand now, in all proba
bility there will be no settlement
by that time unless meanwhile
there has been built up a body of
public opinion demanding a settle
ment which will find expression
in the next session of Congress.
Thus the Act provides that
the Board of Inquiry shall make
a statement which "shall not
contain any recommendations."
At the end, then, of the 80-day
intermission the strike can he
resumed without any impartial
and responsible judgment as to
how il ought to hi* settled.
Senator Taft recognized that
this was a serious limitation, and
after the Act has been passed
he did in fact attempt to have it
amended to permit the Board of
Inquiry to recommend a settle
ment.
He was not able to induce Con
gress to amend the law. But what
he really counted on, as Mr.

Joseph A. Loftus of the New York
Times reminds us, is this.
If a strike go on and
there is a national emerg
ency —as there is in steel —then
Senator Taft expected Congress
to intervene and to pass an
emergency act to deal with the
particular situation.
This is what the country should
now prepare for. During the com
ing weeks, while the strike is
suspended by injunction but is
not settled, the President and the
leaders of Congress should confer
on special legislation to be en
acted by the Congress.
In one way or another this
legislation would compel a satis
factory settlement. The threat of
this legislation offers the best
promise of a voluntary settle
ment.
It is interesting and one hopes
it is significant of a change in
administration policy that the
Secretary of Labor, Mr. Mitch
ell, has in the past few days
proposed that there should be
statutory authority to set up
fact-finding boards independent
of the Taft-Hartley Act pro
cedure.
This is a marked advance from
the President's position of last
July. But it does not go far
enough. The statutory boards
should have authority not only
to find the facts but to mediate
and to make recommendations on
the basis of what they learned in
mediating.
This is short of compulsory
arbitration. But as a next step
it may be near enough to be ef
fective. For in the case of a
stubborn and dangerous strike,
like this one in steel, an official
recommendation for settlement
could not be rejected without
running the risk that Congress
would then take the next step,
and compel arbitration.
In any event, since we have
to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act
which we know is inadequate,
(lie thing to do, it seems to me,
is to reinforce it at once —on
the principle that Senator Taft
had in mind.
This is to notify the warring
parties that the next move—if
they refuse to agree — will be
legislation by the President and
the Congress.
