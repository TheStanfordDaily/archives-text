# Spiegelberg Talk Outlines Art Mythology
## 
### Ross Hermann 
The mythology of Indian Art
and tho resulting aesthetics were
! outlined last night in a talk by
Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg, associ
; ate professor of Indian Civiliza
tions and Asian Languages.
Beginning his presentation of
the subject, Spiegelberg express
ed tho view that art is an import
ant part of life and a fervent,
ilfigh pitched representation of
human existence. Since art and
religion are closely connected, a
true understanding of any people
| can he gained through the study
of art rather than the investiga
tion of social development or his
tory.
Origins Traced
Spiegelberg traced the origins
of Indian art aesthetics in terms
of traditional mythology. Es
sentially, art is considered to have
been originated in heaven, and
all works are thought to be Ihe
products of divine inspiration. All
forms of art occupy a middle
status between the highly spirit
ual and the material realms, serv
ing as a bridge between the two.
This concept is in direct agree
ment with the widespread feeling
that this world is a miserable
place and must be subordinated
to a more elevated realm.
The place of art in life was de
scribed, therefore, as the meeting
place of the two levels. Art serves
then as a medium of communica
tion with the Gods. For the In
dians, similar experiences are
birth, death, eclipses of the sun
and moon, and pilgrimages.
Art for the Gods
In Indian art, the important
feature is not the object itself but
the image that it leaves upon the
person's mind. Art, and partic
ularly music, is not designed for
pleasure or entertainment but is
performed for the Gods. The ex
ecution of music transforms the
atmosphere and clears the chan
nels for spiritual insight.
Spiegelberg concluded that the
purpose of all art is to achieve
bliss and to outdo and rise above
the difference between joy and
pain. The Indians believe that
their art can accomplish this be
cause. according to mythology, it
was born in heaven and executed
by the Gods.
