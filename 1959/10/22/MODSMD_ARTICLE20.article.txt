Should Question
Editor, The Daily:
A recent letter in your column
rather shocked me by the way in
which it tried to justify lack of
critical thinking by students. It
asserted that we should not ques
tion our national way of life be
cause it has obviously been effec
tive.
Of course, it has been effective,
but so has Communism in the
Soviet Union. For any who
doubted this, the latest moon
rocket should be conclusive evi
dence. Are we to suggest that the
Russians unquestioningly accept
their way of life? I doubt it.
A dynamic society is one thai
constantly questions itself and
seeks out the best in everything.
The university in particular must
play a leading role.
I am not at all suggesting that
we believe everything or anything
the Socialists say, but they de
serve to be heard and through
ly considered. It is not just an
extra-curricular activity; it is
our duty in a democracy.
A merely superficial study of
scientific history shows that er
roneous theories often last for
centuries because they appear to
work so well; it is only by critical
questioning that they are found
to be lacking. Error is never re
vealed by tacit acceptance.
In this age of moon rockets and
H-bombs, it is imperative that we
re-examine and question every
phase of our national way of life.
You never know; we may find
that we're perfect.

Stanford s Yacht
Editor, The Daily:
For the past few days over
radio station KARL, the United
States Government has adver

tised the sale of a yacht, suitable
for private use.
It has come to the attention
of a few of the students that an
opportunity presents itself to
give Stanford another academic
first which would be recognized
both nation and world-wide.
What other university can boast
of its own presidential yacht!
We can see it now, in its blaz
ing coat of red paint, transporting
students and faculty to next
year's Big Game. How about
weekend overnights to Milpitas—
by water, yet. We mean, like
wow!
Our forward thinking organiz
ing committee has even come up
with a possible name for Stan
ford's own Big Red Bucket of
Bolts. We feel that it should bear
the name of Stanford's most
prominent graduate.
Therefore we propose — the
"LSJUS (Leland Stanford Junior
University Ship) Warren G.
Wonka!" We ask you, how about
that.
For further details, listen to
station KABL and if you find
this idea as intriguing as we
have, respond by sending letters
to the editor of The Daily. Should
enough students support this en
deavor, the forward looking com
mittee will act!

Stanford s Yacht
Editor, The Daily:
For the past few days over
radio station KARL, the United
States Government has adver

tised the sale of a yacht, suitable
for private use.
It has come to the attention
of a few of the students that an
opportunity presents itself to
give Stanford another academic
first which would be recognized
both nation and world-wide.
What other university can boast
of its own presidential yacht!
We can see it now, in its blaz
ing coat of red paint, transporting
students and faculty to next
year's Big Game. How about
weekend overnights to Milpitas—
by water, yet. We mean, like
wow!
Our forward thinking organiz
ing committee has even come up
with a possible name for Stan
ford's own Big Red Bucket of
Bolts. We feel that it should bear
the name of Stanford's most
prominent graduate.
Therefore we propose — the
"LSJUS (Leland Stanford Junior
University Ship) Warren G.
Wonka!" We ask you, how about
that.
For further details, listen to
station KABL and if you find
this idea as intriguing as we
have, respond by sending letters
to the editor of The Daily. Should
enough students support this en
deavor, the forward looking com
mittee will act!
The Forward Looking Committee
Should Question
Editor, The Daily:
A recent letter in your column
rather shocked me by the way in
which it tried to justify lack of
critical thinking by students. It
asserted that we should not ques
tion our national way of life be
cause it has obviously been effec
tive.
Of course, it has been effective,
but so has Communism in the
Soviet Union. For any who
doubted this, the latest moon
rocket should be conclusive evi
dence. Are we to suggest that the
Russians unquestioningly accept
their way of life? I doubt it.
A dynamic society is one thai
constantly questions itself and
seeks out the best in everything.
The university in particular must
play a leading role.
I am not at all suggesting that
we believe everything or anything
the Socialists say, but they de
serve to be heard and through
ly considered. It is not just an
extra-curricular activity; it is
our duty in a democracy.
A merely superficial study of
scientific history shows that er
roneous theories often last for
centuries because they appear to
work so well; it is only by critical
questioning that they are found
to be lacking. Error is never re
vealed by tacit acceptance.
In this age of moon rockets and
H-bombs, it is imperative that we
re-examine and question every
phase of our national way of life.
You never know; we may find
that we're perfect.
