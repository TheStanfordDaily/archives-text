# One Opinion
## STEVE BAFFREY 
### 
Up to last Sunday evening the
fact I am about to admit some
how bothered me deep down in
side wherever it is one gets
bothered.
But now, having experienced
it first hand, and consequently
having changed my values some
what, I can admit it without
much pain.
Enough mystery! The fact is
a simple one. Plainly, the Stan
ford Daily is the best garbage
can liner that ever the row did
see!
The fact T pointedly learned
during my guest (really, substi
tute) appearance as a hasher at
Hurlburt House a few days ago.
In fact, after three years of
this I had begun to think the
gag had worn thin. Then the
heavens opened up and the light
poured in, and I was thoroughly
convinced that this sheet had
more virtues than ever I, a
loyal staff member, had at
tributed to it.
Still, I will admit that coming
to this realization is a little hard
on the value system. But the
philosophy that says we must
accept realities has some merit.
And speaking about merit, I
must laud the paper for its length
and its thickness (and, you bet,
for it's before-the-can content).
Any shorter would be too
short (it wouldn't fold out over
the tops of the cans). And long
er â€”too long (either too much
over the top or too much to
fiddle with on the inside).
Any thinner gives not enough
protection; any thicker makes for
too much bulk in handling.
But despite this shock to my
complacency there was consola
tion in the act of lining the cans.
Thankfully, I feel I should say,

I can't remember having used a
copy of Ihe Daily which hadn't
been read before. I think (hope)
\( expect).

Question from a reader: Why '
does the beautiful new Medical
Center fare AWAY from the
main campus?
Answer: Well, you see, it's this
way. Seems old mom nature pro
vided lots of beautiful trees and
millions of blades of nice green
grass over on the other side of
the center, and nastily forgot to
do same between the center and
the campus. Therefore .... and
not wanting to spend any more
money than necessary . . . You
see ?
'Not her question, 'nother read
er: Why is it that Stanford al
ways seems to have a couple of
standout team members on the
football squad, but always seems
to do so poorly?
Answer: I give up!
Somebody over Rohle way
pulled a beautiful backhanded
approach to polling her con
stituency for a question pending
at legislature, and it's hard to 1
let it slip by without comment.
The question is whether or not
Rally Com should receive an
appropriation to film coordinated
halftime activities for showing at
the Sunday night flicks. The pro
posal at legislature was a simple
enough one: to have the repre
sentatives find out if their con
stituents would be in favor of
such.
In at least one Roble corridor
the representative asked ques
tions, all right, but in the follow
ing order:
(1) Do you go 1o football
games?
(2) Do you think people would !
mess up the card stunts if they
knew someone was making pic
tures of them?
(31 Do you think we should ap
propriate money to have pictures
of the car stunts taken?
Off hand, I would say somebody
was making a case of this thing.
Ah democracy!
FINAL NOTE OF JOY: j
Carol McKamm, who a couple |
of weeks ago was not going to ;
have anything to do with (iaie
ties this year, lias taken a small
part, not requiring' a heap of
rehearsal time, in the show.
Now I'll buy me a ticket!
