# Student Is Winning Pianist
## 
### Hurry Greenberg 
Arthur Tollefson first saw
Stanford in 19r>8. He sat before a
piano on the stage of Memorial
Auditorium, one of five finalists
who were striving for the $3000
Kimber Award, given to the most
talented young California instru
mentalist.
So much money might unnerve
a normal kid of 1(5. but Tollefson
is made of sterner stuff. He won
the $3000 and the gold medal that
goes with it and, in the process,
became the youngest person ever
to win the coveted award.
Superior Grades
Now a 17-year-old music major
at Stanford on a $750 scholar
ship earned on excellent high
school grades rather than supe
rior playing, Tollefson leaned for
ward in a Holliday Lounge chair
and revealed how it all started.
"When I was five years old, my
mother, who is a music teacher,
gave me my first piano lesson.
She continued to tutor me for' five
years and then a few years ago
took me to her former teacher,
Vincent Arrillaga, one of the
country's top pianists."
Studied at Conservatory
The following year Tollefson
began studying at the San Fran
cisco Conservatory of Music. Lil
lian Hodghead, co-founder of the
Conservatory, was his teacher.
"I continued my studies there
for two years and then went to
learn from Adolph Bailer." Tol
lefson said. Bailer is pianist with
the famous Alma Trio
Thirteen is anything but an un
lucky number for Tollefson be
cause it was at this age that he
gave his first full-length recital
at tho Conservatory, and it also
marks his first appearance with
the San Francisco Symphony.
No Effect
Although he practiced four
hours a day, it had no effect upon
his school work. Tollefson attend
ed Lick - Wilmerding, a private
boys' school, and, upon gradua
tion, lie was awarded a diamond
ring for being first in his senior
class, maintaining a 3.8 average.
He swung the conversation
back to his favorite topic. "When
I was 15, 1 won the full-tuition Lit
lian Hodghead Scholarship at the
Conservatory and continued to
study with Bailer."
It was also in this year that he

gave his second full-length recital
at the Conservatory, playing se
lections from Beethoven, Chopin,
Liszt, Bach, Schubert, MacDowell
and Prokofieff.
"Then came my c r owning
achievement, winning the Kimber
Award," he said, a smile lighting
up his face. There were 500 con
testants at the start: violinists,
'cellists and pianists. It was cut
down to 20 semi-finalists, then to
five finalists and then to the win
ner, Tollefson.
Guest Soloist
In February he was invited by
Arthur Fiedler of the Boston Pops
to guest solo with the San Fran
cisco Symphony. Over 10,000 peo
ple filled the Civic Auditorium to
hear him play.
Hobbies? He's an avid sports
fan but cannot participate be
cause of those valuable hands.
"Believe it or not, I also enjoy
Broadway musicals; most classi

eal musicians despise them."
Toilefson's father is a commer
cial engineer lor Pacific Tele
phone and Telegraph. He has a
little brother, Donald, who is get
ting his first taste of piano les
sons.
Toilefson's dream is to be a con
cert pianist, and, looking back on
some of his accomplishments, no
one can deny that he is on the
right track. Arthur Tollefson,
probably a name to remember.

began studying at the San Fran
cisco Conservatory of Music. Lil
lian Hodghead, co-founder of the
Conservatory, was his teacher.
"I continued my studies there
for two years and then went to
learn from Adolph Bailer." Tol
lefson said. Bailer is pianist with
the famous Alma Trio
Thirteen is anything but an un
lucky number for Tollefson be
cause it was at this age that he
gave his first full-length recital
at tho Conservatory, and it also
marks his first appearance with
the San Francisco Symphony.
No Effect
Although he practiced four
hours a day, it had no effect upon
his school work. Tollefson attend
ed Lick - Wilmerding, a private
boys' school, and, upon gradua
tion, lie was awarded a diamond
ring for being first in his senior
class, maintaining a 3.8 average.
He swung the conversation
back to his favorite topic. "When
I was 15, 1 won the full-tuition Lit
lian Hodghead Scholarship at the
Conservatory and continued to
study with Bailer."
It was also in this year that he

gave his second full-length recital
at the Conservatory, playing se
lections from Beethoven, Chopin,
Liszt, Bach, Schubert, MacDowell
and Prokofieff.
"Then came my c r owning
achievement, winning the Kimber
Award," he said, a smile lighting
up his face. There were 500 con
testants at the start: violinists,
'cellists and pianists. It was cut
down to 20 semi-finalists, then to
five finalists and then to the win
ner, Tollefson.
Guest Soloist
In February he was invited by
Arthur Fiedler of the Boston Pops
to guest solo with the San Fran

ple filled the Civic Auditorium to
hear him play.
Hobbies? He's an avid sports
fan but cannot participate be
cause of those valuable hands.
"Believe it or not, I also enjoy
Broadway musicals; most classi

eal musicians despise them."
Toilefson's father is a commer
cial engineer lor Pacific Tele
phone and Telegraph. He has a
little brother, Donald, who is get
ting his first taste of piano les
sons.
Toilefson's dream is to be a con

"Then came my c r owning
achievement, winning the Kimber
Award," he said, a smile lighting
up his face. There were 500 con

PROFICIENT PIANIST

Arthur Tollefson first saw
Stanford in 19r>8. He sat before a
piano on the stage of Memorial
Auditorium, one of five finalists
who were striving for the $3000
Kimber Award, given to the most
talented young California instru
mentalist.
So much money might unnerve
a normal kid of 1(5. but Tollefson
is made of sterner stuff. He won
the $3000 and the gold medal that
goes with it and, in the process,
became the youngest person ever
to win the coveted award.
Superior Grades
Now a 17-year-old music major
at Stanford on a $750 scholar
ship earned on excellent high
school grades rather than supe
rior playing, Tollefson leaned for
ward in a Holliday Lounge chair
and revealed how it all started.
"When I was five years old, my
mother, who is a music teacher,
gave me my first piano lesson.
She continued to tutor me for' five
years and then a few years ago
took me to her former teacher,
Vincent Arrillaga, one of the
country's top pianists."
Studied at Conservatory
The following year Tollefson
began studying at the San Fran
cisco Conservatory of Music. Lil
lian Hodghead, co-founder of the
Conservatory, was his teacher.
"I continued my studies there
for two years and then went to
learn from Adolph Bailer." Tol
lefson said. Bailer is pianist with
the famous Alma Trio
Thirteen is anything but an un
lucky number for Tollefson be
cause it was at this age that he
gave his first full-length recital
at tho Conservatory, and it also
marks his first appearance with
the San Francisco Symphony.
No Effect
Although he practiced four
hours a day, it had no effect upon
his school work. Tollefson attend
ed Lick - Wilmerding, a private
boys' school, and, upon gradua
tion, lie was awarded a diamond
ring for being first in his senior
class, maintaining a 3.8 average.
He swung the conversation
back to his favorite topic. "When
I was 15, 1 won the full-tuition Lit
lian Hodghead Scholarship at the
Conservatory and continued to
study with Bailer."
It was also in this year that he

gave his second full-length recital
at the Conservatory, playing se
lections from Beethoven, Chopin,
Liszt, Bach, Schubert, MacDowell
and Prokofieff.
"Then came my c r owning
achievement, winning the Kimber
Award," he said, a smile lighting
up his face. There were 500 con
testants at the start: violinists,
'cellists and pianists. It was cut
down to 20 semi-finalists, then to
