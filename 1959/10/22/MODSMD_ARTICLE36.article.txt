# Indian's Burford, Norman In National Grid Limelight
## 
### 
Despite consistent losses by the
Stanford Indians, Iwo individuals,
Dick Norman and Chris Burford,
continue to lead the nation in
three statistics columns.
With Norman leading in both
total offense and forward passing
and Burford in pass receiving, op
posing teams continue to regard
Stanford as a danger on the field.
Regardless of losses, observers
continue to admit that the In
dians have great potential.
Norman Ups Lead
Stanford's Dick Norman, last
week just one yard ahead in total
offense, has pushed his margin
clear up to a booming 80 yards.
In the forward passing column
Norman is still way out in front
by 94 yards.
Caldwell, of Army, is Norman's
new threat in the passing col
umn, replacing Weidner of Colo
rado, who came within one yard
of catching up the closest this
season anyone has come to the
Indian pace-setter.
Burford. Norman's favorite tar
get, is the most pressed of the na
tion's top three leaders to date.
Bill Carpenter of Army, the fa
mous "lonely" end, has equaled
Burford in yardage, and is only
one behind in pass catching.
Chris Burford's 2(5-25 lead may be
insignificant, however, when one
considers the fact that Carpenter
has played only four games to
the Indian's five.
Stanford Fourth in Passing
In other areas, Stanford ranks
fourth in forward passing offense
with a 197 yards per game aver
age; and tenth in punting, aver
aging 11.3 yards per game. There
have never before been more
than five punters averaging 44
yards this far along in the sea
son, but there are now nine.
Ranking along with Norman
and Burford as a season leader
is Pervis Atkins of New Mexico
State. Atkins has been the rush
ing pace-setter with a 90-yard
lead over Wat kins of lowa State.
Atkins has been the leading scor

or all through October as well as
the only ball - carrying leader.
This concentration of the offense
limelight has not happened be
fore in the 25 years the NCAA
has been keeping records.
Yale Unscored Upon
Yale remains the only unscored
upon team in the nation, and will
be looking at a 16-year record this
week when they meet Colgate.
USC was the last team to go un
scored upon through six games.
That was back in 1943.
