## Papooses' Interior Linemen Show Strength in Cal Game 
### Chuck Bischoff 
Often after a successful foot
ball game, the fans are likely to
heap praises on the runners and
passers who made the spectacu
lar plays. But rarely do they real
ize Ihat the men who open up
the holes and give the passer time
to throw, namely the interior
linemen, are of at least equal im
portance.
In last Saturday's frosh vic
tory over Cal's Cub squad, the
hard-hitting frosh line showed up
very well. The most effective in
terior lineman is co-captain and
right guard Sieve Player. Player
functions best on offense, often
pulling out of the line to lead a
runner down field.
Right tackle C. B. Simons has
the asset of great physical

â€¢strength, and is very agile for his
220 pounds. Simons also stands
out on offense. Keeping the op
position loose up front is center
Mike Dowling. Dowling hits very
hard and is a fine all-around play
er.
Defensive standouts incl u d e
left guard Starr Rounds and left
tackle Charles Buehler. Rounds
is very strong and should get bet
ter as he learns more techniques
of playing his position. Buehler,
at 245 pounds, is the biggest
member of the line ,but is also
very agile. lie has a lot of poten
tial and a great deal is expected
of him as he too picks up some
of the finer points of play.
These are the frosh who will
have the job Saturday of knock
ing heads down south with the
big and tough USC freshman line.
