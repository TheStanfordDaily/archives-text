# Closed Practice Sessions 'Insure' Football Secrecy
## 
### 
For the second straight after
noon Stanford's football team
held a closed practice session yes
terday in preparation for the
coming battle against Southern
California in the Coliseum.
This brings to mind similar
secret practices held before the
SC game last year in which it
turned out that working behind
closed doors was the quickest
way to advise the Trojans of what
was brewing outside of phoning

Los Angeles.
The cooperation from the Stan
ford arm of the press corps prom
ises to be improved over last year,
however, and the Associated
Press will have lo wait until
Saturday like everyone else to

find out just what Jack Curtice
and his boys have in the way of
surprises for the men from Troy.
Injured Return
In the meantime the Tribe's
disabled list has grown consider
ably smaller and the team is con
siderably cheered by the complete
return of Doug Pursell and Tom
Walsh to t ho line-up. Also Chris
Burford and Ben Robinson seem
pretty much over their minor
aches.
As if they didn't have enough
to worry about with the upcom
ing battle against the number
four or five team in the country
(depending on which wire service
you subscribe to), it turns out
that the Smoglanders are the
team leaders in five out of the
six major statistical departments

in the A A WIT.
The Trojans have substantia]
leads in total offense, total de
fense, rushing offense, rushing
defense, and passing defense.
The only other department, that
of passing offense, happily, be
longs to Stanford and Dick Nor
man.
Nationally too, the Trojans are
formidable. Although they haven't
a single individual leader, SC is
eighth in the country in total
offense, fourth in total defense,
seventh in rushing offense, and
fourth in rusing defense. Lots of
luck.
SC Back Leads League
Continuing the statistics it
seems that the top runner in the
AAVVU is also from SC; halfback
Jerry Traynham.
These, then, are only some of
the headaches which the Tribe
will have to encounter. A great
rushing offense, an equally great
defense, and four or five fine
runners, each one as effective as
the next. Won't be easy.

rushing offense, an equally great
defense, and four or five fine
runners, each one as effective as
the next. Won't be easy.

Back in Fill! Strength
For the second straight after
noon Stanford's football team
held a closed practice session yes
terday in preparation for the
coming battle against Southern
California in the Coliseum.
This brings to mind similar
secret practices held before the
SC game last year in which it
turned out that working behind
closed doors was the quickest
way to advise the Trojans of what
was brewing outside of phoning

Los Angeles.
The cooperation from the Stan
ford arm of the press corps prom
ises to be improved over last year,
however, and the Associated
Press will have lo wait until
Saturday like everyone else to

find out just what Jack Curtice
and his boys have in the way of
surprises for the men from Troy.
Injured Return
In the meantime the Tribe's
disabled list has grown consider
ably smaller and the team is con
siderably cheered by the complete
return of Doug Pursell and Tom
Walsh to t ho line-up. Also Chris
Burford and Ben Robinson seem
pretty much over their minor
aches.
As if they didn't have enough
to worry about with the upcom
ing battle against the number
four or five team in the country
(depending on which wire service
you subscribe to), it turns out
that the Smoglanders are the
team leaders in five out of the
six major statistical departments

in the A A WIT.
The Trojans have substantia]
leads in total offense, total de
fense, rushing offense, rushing
defense, and passing defense.
The only other department, that
of passing offense, happily, be
longs to Stanford and Dick Nor
man.
Nationally too, the Trojans are
formidable. Although they haven't
a single individual leader, SC is
eighth in the country in total
offense, fourth in total defense,
seventh in rushing offense, and
fourth in rusing defense. Lots of
luck.
SC Back Leads League
Continuing the statistics it
seems that the top runner in the
AAVVU is also from SC; halfback
Jerry Traynham.
These, then, are only some of
the headaches which the Tribe
will have to encounter. A great
rushing offense, an equally great
defense, and four or five fine
runners, each one as effective as
the next. Won't be easy.
