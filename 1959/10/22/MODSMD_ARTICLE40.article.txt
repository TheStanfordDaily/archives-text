One thing that is as regular as football at Stanford is the rash of
grandstand quarterbacks and coaches that appear on the scene come
the cooler days of mid-October.
The last few years the football team has certainly provided plenty
of controversy for the critical fan. However, most spectators who
try to analyze matters of football usually overlook the obvious and
dig for remote underlying factors. 1 couldn't help overhearing a few
Stanford loyals as they left the Stadium last Saturday after WSU
had just laid a rather humiliating defeat on this year's gridders.

One fan was ready to send the
whole team to a psychiatrist
where all their inhibitions, com
plexes and fears could be re
lieved. Another fan, this one a
little more vehement in his bit
terness, was practically advocat
ing that the University shoulr 1
call in a Senate subcommittee tr
investigate the loyalty of the
Stanford football players. "They
just don't want to win!" he rant
ed and raged.
Still a third chap was all ready
to have Coach Jack Curt ice
lynchcd from the nearest euca
lyptus tree. I'm still not sure
whether he meant in effigy or the
real thing. His gripe was that
Stanford was just loaded with
talent but they just never 1 won
The obvious conclusion (?): the
coach.
Others had any number of ra
tionales from dissension among
the players to the fact that sev
eral of the players were married
and this led to a lessening of in
centives.

In order for some of these grandstanders to get a look at lUvc
effort that is being put in by Stanford's football team may I suggest
Hie same procedure that a loyal San Jose rooter went through a few
weeks ago?
Depressed after State had dropped a decision at the hands of un
beaten Oregon, one of the students decided he would tell Ihe coaches
and players what he thought of their performances. Afler he had
gotten all his gripes off his chest the coaches said, "Fine, why don't
you show up for practice Monday and we'll give you a suit and you
can show us what real effort is?"
The fan lasted one day's worth of drills. I think he leaves the
hospital this week.
Why?
Why has Stanford's record been so poor the last few years? Two
reasons which seem the soundest to me are just simple physical
shortcomings. First of all, Stanford's football team lacks any real
speed either in the line or the backfield; number twu, there is nothing
more than average size in the Indian line.
There isn't one back on the Stanford roster who could be consid
ered a breakaway man. The Indians are stocked with hard-running
fullbacks. There's Archie Schmidt, Ciil Dowd, Kick McMillcn, Mac
| YYylie, Sid Garber and others. If you've seen one you've seen them
I all. Actually any one of these players might be a tremendous threat
on the ground if there were just someone to vary the running attack,
j Just to add some more complications to the attack, Stanford has
had trouble getting downfield blocking even when their runners have
made it around the ends. Phil Burkland has, however, been one line
| man who has consistently been able to keep ahead of the ball carriers
and has made some fine blocks.
As for the size angle—Stanford has done yoeman's effort in the
line but rarely does a team win week after week any more unless
they have a huge line.
Stanford's one good-sized lineman, Dean Hinshaw, unfortunately
was injured, leaving a lean, tough but small line.
How does a coach teach his players to run faster or gain a little
weight and height?
