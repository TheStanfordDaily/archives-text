## 
### 
(This is the first in a series
of articles discussing the play
ers who make up the Stanford
football team. The next article
will appear next Tuesday dis
cussing the tackles.)
A football team which bases its
offense on passing has to be
stocked with plenty of sure-hand
ed ends, and Stanford is fortu
nate in having many top pass-re
ceiving ends.
The two wings who have re
ceived the most publicity so far
this season are the starters, Ben
Robinson and Chris Burford.
Burford, captain of this year's
team, was a unanimous All-
Coast lineman last year and ha;
shown no let-down this year, lie
leads the nation in pass recep
tions and has been outstanding in
all his efforts. "Burf," as Bur
ford is known by his teammates,
played in 540 of the 600 minutes
of Stanford football last year.
In private life Burford is one

of the Indians' married players.
He also is Hie father of a year
old daughter.
Robinson Catches Baseballs Too
Robinson is well known to both
football and baseball fans at
Stanford. "Big Ben" played in
the outfield in last year's Indian
diamond squad.
At 6-5 Robinson is the Cards'
tallest player. His height serves
him well in his receiving chores

as he has snared many passes
which would have been out of
reach of others.
Backing up Robinson and Bur
ford are many other strong can
didates.
Nikolai Second on Coast
Irv Nikolai, who played first
string end last year, has been al
ternating between flankerback
and end this year. Nikolai, a
physica I education major from
Alameda, transferred to Stanford
from Oakland JC two years ago.
Last year he w;is the Coast's sec-

ond top receiver and ihe nation's
seventh ranking pass snarer.
Two top defensive ends on the
Indian squad this year are sopho
more George Honore and senior
Bill Donahue.
Honore, who delves in a little
civil engineering between football

games, has shown as much im
provement as any Stanford play
er this year. Thrown into several
games to give Ben Robinson a
rest on defense, i lonore has
shown cat - like reflexes on the
fieid. Also a good pass receiver,
Ilonore will probably get a shot
at offense next year.
Donahue Small But Tough,
Donahue is one of the most
amazing members of the Stan-

ford squad. Despite standing
only 5-9 and weighing a mere 175
pounds, Donahue has proven him
self especially tough on defense.
The Auburn senior has wonder

ful powers of anticipation and is
constantly found haunting enemy
backfields.
Tom McDonald, a 190-pounder
from Corcoran, has filled in well
on offense. McDonald has been
a prime target for quarterback
Rod Sears this year. McDonald
has one more year after 1959 and
could grab off one of next year's
starting berths.
Rich Hearney and Bob Mueller
round out the end corps.
Hearney Once Played Center
Hearney, a junior, has been in
jured the last several week?, but
started the season as Stanford's
top defensive end. A Petaluma
native, Ilearney is majoring in
ore - medical studies. Some of
Hearney's defensive ability was
gained when he playecl center a
a freshman.
Mueller, only a sophomore, fig
ures to be one of the Indians of
the future. Receiving and block
ing are Mueller's main attributes.
He comes to Stanford from Hono
lulu.

physica I education major from

from Oakland JC two years ago.
Last year he w;is the Coast's sec-

ond top receiver and ihe nation's
seventh ranking pass snarer.
Two top defensive ends on the
Indian squad this year are sopho
more George Honore and senior
Bill Donahue.
Honore, who delves in a little
civil engineering between football

games, has shown as much im
provement as any Stanford play
er this year. Thrown into several
games to give Ben Robinson a
rest on defense, i lonore has
shown cat - like reflexes on the
fieid. Also a good pass receiver,
Ilonore will probably get a shot
at offense next year.
Donahue Small But Tough,
Donahue is one of the most
amazing members of the Stan-

ford squad. Despite standing
only 5-9 and weighing a mere 175
pounds, Donahue has proven him
self especially tough on defense.
The Auburn senior has wonder

ful powers of anticipation and is
constantly found haunting enemy
backfields.
Tom McDonald, a 190-pounder
from Corcoran, has filled in well
on offense. McDonald has been
a prime target for quarterback
Rod Sears this year. McDonald
has one more year after 1959 and
could grab off one of next year's
starting berths.
Rich Hearney and Bob Mueller
round out the end corps.
Hearney Once Played Center
Hearney, a junior, has been in
jured the last several week?, but
started the season as Stanford's
top defensive end. A Petaluma
native, Ilearney is majoring in
ore - medical studies. Some of
Hearney's defensive ability was
gained when he playecl center a

Mueller, only a sophomore, fig
ures to be one of the Indians of

A football team which bases its
offense on passing has to be
stocked with plenty of sure-hand
ed ends, and Stanford is fortu
nate in having many top pass-re
ceiving ends.
The two wings who have re
ceived the most publicity so far
this season are the starters, Ben
Robinson and Chris Burford.
Burford, captain of this year's
team, was a unanimous All-
Coast lineman last year and ha;
shown no let-down this year, lie
leads the nation in pass recep
tions and has been outstanding in
all his efforts. "Burf," as Bur
ford is known by his teammates,
played in 540 of the 600 minutes
of Stanford football last year.
In private life Burford is one

of the Indians' married players.
He also is Hie father of a year
old daughter.
Robinson Catches Baseballs Too
Robinson is well known to both
football and baseball fans at
Stanford. "Big Ben" played in
the outfield in last year's Indian
diamond squad.
At 6-5 Robinson is the Cards'
tallest player. His height serves
him well in his receiving chores

as he has snared many passes
which would have been out of
reach of others.
Backing up Robinson and Bur
ford are many other strong can
didates.

Target for Sears
(This is the first in a series
of articles discussing the play
ers who make up the Stanford
football team. The next article
will appear next Tuesday dis
cussing the tackles.)
A football team which bases its
offense on passing has to be
stocked with plenty of sure-hand
ed ends, and Stanford is fortu
nate in having many top pass-re
ceiving ends.
The two wings who have re
ceived the most publicity so far
this season are the starters, Ben
Robinson and Chris Burford.
Burford, captain of this year's
team, was a unanimous All-
Coast lineman last year and ha;
shown no let-down this year, lie
leads the nation in pass recep
tions and has been outstanding in
all his efforts. "Burf," as Bur
ford is known by his teammates,
played in 540 of the 600 minutes
of Stanford football last year.
In private life Burford is one

of the Indians' married players.
He also is Hie father of a year
old daughter.
Robinson Catches Baseballs Too
Robinson is well known to both
football and baseball fans at
Stanford. "Big Ben" played in
the outfield in last year's Indian
diamond squad.
At 6-5 Robinson is the Cards'
tallest player. His height serves
him well in his receiving chores

as he has snared many passes
which would have been out of
reach of others.
Backing up Robinson and Bur
ford are many other strong can
didates.
Nikolai Second on Coast
Irv Nikolai, who played first
string end last year, has been al
ternating between flankerback
and end this year. Nikolai, a
physica I education major from
Alameda, transferred to Stanford
from Oakland JC two years ago.
Last year he w;is the Coast's sec-

ond top receiver and ihe nation's
seventh ranking pass snarer.
Two top defensive ends on the
Indian squad this year are sopho
more George Honore and senior
Bill Donahue.
Honore, who delves in a little
civil engineering between football

games, has shown as much im
provement as any Stanford play
er this year. Thrown into several
games to give Ben Robinson a
rest on defense, i lonore has
shown cat - like reflexes on the
fieid. Also a good pass receiver,
Ilonore will probably get a shot
at offense next year.
Donahue Small But Tough,
Donahue is one of the most
amazing members of the Stan-

ford squad. Despite standing
only 5-9 and weighing a mere 175
pounds, Donahue has proven him
self especially tough on defense.
The Auburn senior has wonder

ful powers of anticipation and is
constantly found haunting enemy
backfields.
Tom McDonald, a 190-pounder
from Corcoran, has filled in well
on offense. McDonald has been
a prime target for quarterback
Rod Sears this year. McDonald
has one more year after 1959 and
could grab off one of next year's
starting berths.
Rich Hearney and Bob Mueller
round out the end corps.
Hearney Once Played Center
Hearney, a junior, has been in
jured the last several week?, but
started the season as Stanford's
top defensive end. A Petaluma
native, Ilearney is majoring in
ore - medical studies. Some of
Hearney's defensive ability was
gained when he playecl center a
a freshman.
Mueller, only a sophomore, fig
ures to be one of the Indians of
the future. Receiving and block
ing are Mueller's main attributes.
He comes to Stanford from Hono
lulu.
