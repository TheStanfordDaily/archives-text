ey said Wednesday the few re
maining members of the new
Continental Baseball League will
be selected from among Montreal,
Buffalo, Atlanta and Dallas Fort
Worth.
lie left no doubt Buffalo will
be the first to join the founding
group of Toronto, New York,
Houston, Denver and Minneapo
lis St. Paul.
"In my judgment the remain
ing three will come from the four
cities named," the Continental
president told a press conference.
"Perhaps in all fairness we
should include New Orleans but 1
believe listing only four makes it
a factual statement."
Rickey predicted Buffalo will
have completed necessary ar
rangements within another week.
"They are far ahead of every
body," he said. "They can raise
the necessary $2 '{> million. They
have from $500,000 to $600,000 in
the bank. They have something
like 2937 stockholders but we
have insisted they select a few
businessmen to underwrite the
balance."
