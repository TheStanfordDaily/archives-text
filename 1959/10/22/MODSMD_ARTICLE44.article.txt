# Lightweights Boost Stanford Mat Team
## 
### Stan Hulett 
With some help from men in
the low weight divisions, the
Stanford wrestling team should
ho improved over lasi season.
Last year, Coach Jack McKenna's
mat men were forced to forfeit
(he matches in the 130- and 137-1
pound divisions.
But this year the Indians have
found men for these spots, and il
i.i hoped that they will help plug
up the holes. The Card mat men j
lost important points last season
because of the lack of men in '
these divisions, and this cost |
them more than one match.
Good Season Last Year
They did curl the season with a
good 4-2 season mark, however,
the fourth win of t he season be
ing a great team victory over the
University of Californ-i. And the
Indians have all the men back
from this team, with the addition
of the frosh from last season.
Dick Denny, Art Spiegel, Tom
Walsh, now a standout guard on
the Indian football team, Lee
Stephenson, Skip Pew, Phil Mur
phy and Gerry Nicolaysen will
'>11 return to the Stanford lineup
to bolster the wrestling crew.
Wrestling New to Stanford
Last year was the first real
vear of wrestling at Stanford.
For the first time, the wrestling
program was on a regular basis
with the rest of the intercolle
giate athletics, and the Indians
made themselves known in wres
tling circles.
With the addition of men in the
130- and 137-pound classes, the In
dians should be an improved
team over last year, the added ex
periences also being an important
key to this season's success.
The Indians will have their two

| toughest matches of the season
i in the first two weeks of the sea
son, meeting tough Cal Poly and
San Jose State to start off the
1959 campaign.
