STUDYING CAN BE SCREAMS
Ii studying is bugging you, try mnemonics.
Mnemonics, as we all know, was invented by tlie great Greek
philosopher Mnemon in f)2l> B.C. (Mnemonics, incidentally,
was only on< of the inventions of this fertile Athenian. He also
invented the staircase which, as you may imagine, was of
inestimable value to mankind. Before the staircase people
who wished to go from floor to floor were forced to live out
their lives, willy-nilly, on the ground floor, and many of them
grew cross ;is hears. Especially Demosthenes who was elected
( onsn! of Athens three times but never served because he was
unable to get up to the office of Commissioner of Oaths on the
tliinl floor to he sworn in. But after Mnemon's staircase,
Demosthenes got up to the third floor easy as pic—to Athens'
sorrow, as it turned out. Demosthenes, his temper shortened
by years ol confinement to the ground floor, soon embroiled his
countrymen in a series of senseless wars with the Persians, the
Visigoths and the Ogallala Sioux. He was voted out of office in
•>l' H.( . and Mnemon, who had made his accession possible,
was pelted to death with fruit salad in the Duomo. This later
became known as the Missouri Compromise.)

But I digress. Wo were discussing mnemonics, which are nothing
nioro than aids to memory—catchwords or jingles that help you
remember names, dates and places. For example:
Columbus so Hal the ocean blue
In fourteen hundred ninety-two.
Pee how simple? Make up your own jingles. What, for in
stance. is the important event immediately following Colum
bus's discovery of America? The Boston Tea Party, of course.
Try this:
Samuel Adorns flung the ten
I nlo the briniy Zuydcr Zee.
(NOTE: The Zuydcr Zee was located in Boston Harbor until
l!)()4 when Salmon P. Chase traded it to Holland for Louisiana
and two outfielders.)
But 1 digress. To get back to mnemonics, you can see how
simple and useful they are—not only for history but also for
everyday living; for instance:
In nineteen hundred fifty-nine
The smoh to tool:for is Alpine.
"Why Alpine?" you ask. Taste that fine, fresh flavor. Enjoy
that subtle coolness. Until Alpine you needed two cigarettes to
reap the benefits of Alpine—one for flavor, one for high filtra
tion—and smoking two cigarettes is never graceful; in fact,
with mittens it is nigh impossible. Now you need only one
cigarette—Alpine, (let some. You'll sec.
