# 'Moon Besieged' Sets Heighten Violent Theme
## 
### Mary Lou Mckinley 
A setting designed almost entirely on diagonal and jagged lines
to create emotional intensity will appear on the main stage of Mem
orial Auditorium when "The Moon Besieged," Ford Foundation
award-winning play by Seyril Schochen, opens Oct. 25.
The first and third acts of the drama, which is based on the events

j immediately before and after the
I famous raid a 1 Harpers' Ferry on
| Oct. 16, 1859, take place at John
i Brown's farmhouse in New York.
Set Designs
Dick Hay, set designer for the
; Stanford Players 1 , has used the
| jagged line effect to create a dis
j torted and un real appearance
i which reflects Brown's own
j fanaticism and distorted world.
The feeling of violence is height
ened further by a black "frame"
of jagged lines set just behind
the proscenium arch of the stage.
To increase the diagonal line
effect, Hay continued, "false per
spective" is being used which will
make the room look deeper than
it really is. The lowered pro
scenium frame also will height
en the oppressive, cave-like at
mosphere of the dwelling.
In contrast to the first act
with the horizontal, low line pre
dominating, the second act, which
takes place by the Kennedy house
! at Harper's Ferry, is on the verti
cal line, and the proscenium frame
will be raised.
Harper's Ferry
This act takes place .just prior
to the Harper's Ferry incident,
the fulfillment of Brown's "mis
sion," and the vertical building
on the American Gothic line sug
gests exultation.
Between scenes, projections of
Civil War scenes in silhouette
form will be cast on the two side
j walls of the auditorium. With the
projections, choral music of act
ual Civil War songs will be
| broadcast on speakers placed all
â–  around the auditorium to produce
a stereophonic effect. In Hay's
words, the combination will be
an "epic presentation of Ihe Civil
; War to which the play is leading
I up."
