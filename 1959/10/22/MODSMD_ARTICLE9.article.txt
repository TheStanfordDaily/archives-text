Stanford has one winning team
l hat never made tlio sports page.
It's the debate team.
Last year they participated in
227) intercollegiate debates with a
record of 143-76 The extra de
bates were non-decision.
A Stanford team took first at
the Western Speech Association
Tournament ihe most coveted
debate prize in the Western Unit
ed States. Jon Ericson, the de
bate coach, describes it as "a tro
phy which a school, if it's active
in forensics, may achieve once
every 20 years."
The debate team is only one of
the divisions of the Stanford
Speech Association. Speech Asso
ciation is under ASSU. It was or
ganized to "promote student in
terest and participation in both
c a m p us a n d intercollegiate
speech activities."
Debate Tradition
The present organization is the
culmination of a long tradition of
debate at Stanford. When the
University was founded, three in
dependent debating scoieties were
active on campus. They were en
tirely s t u d en t run. However,
once a year after 189."5 they met
with a faculty member to select

! the representatives to compete
for the Medaille Carnot.
This contest between Califor
nia and Stanford i« the oldest an
nual forensic c on test between
j American colleges. It began in
; 189."> when Baron Pierre de Cou
! bertin offered a gold medal to he
(presented to the best speaker in
I an annual meeting between Cal
| and Stanford. In 1917 the name
I of the award was changed from
i Medaille Carnot to Medaille Jof
; frc, honoring the French war
hero Marshal Joffre. The contest
is now sponsored by tho Alliance
Frangaise of San Francisco.
All-UnSversity Society
In 1922 the debate societies
were given a permanent faculty
adviser. By 1930 the independent
groups joined to form an all-Uni
versity debate society. A faculty
adviser served as chairman.
In 19f>0 the present Stanford
Speech Association was founded
with the idea of giving students
more control. It was changed
and enlarged to cover all fields
i of speech.
The Speech Association has
changed from a rather elite
group of experienced and accom
i pljshed debaters to one which is
j open to all students. Anyone is

invited, regardless of previous ex
perience. It is felt that member
ship in Speech Association can be
of as much benefit to the ama
teur as to the professional public
speaker.
At the present time there are
24 active debate teams. Some of
.these have had no previous expe
j riencc, but they can get as much
as they want here.
Wednesday Meeting
Each Wednesday night at the
| Speech Association's g en e r a 1
j meeting from two to 12 teams
I hold debates. Next Wednesday
there will be 12 teams debating
I the current national topic, "Re
solved: Congress should be given
the power to reverse decisions of
the Supreme Court." All students
are invited.
All students interested In de
bating will meet in Room c 53 in
| Cubbcrlcy at 7:15 p.m. Wednes
day. From there each debate
, team will go to an individual
room and begin tlie debate at
7:30.
Speech Association is making
plans for a regular •series of de-
I bates with College of the Pacific
! to be held every Monday night.
They also hope to begin regular
series with other neighboring col

leges.
Other tentative plans include a
series of programs over KZSU.
These would have an introduc
tory panel on the current topic,
to be followed in later programs
by a series of actual debates.
There might also be a TV show
in the form of a modified debate.
Two teams would cross-examine
each other in courtroom style.
The members of Speech Asso
ciation have a chance to get ex
perience and training off campus
as well as on. On Oct. 10, 44 stu
dents went to San Francisco to
attend a debate workshop spon
sored by the Northern California
Forensic Association. Two Stan
ford seniors took part in the dem
onstration debate.
On Oct. 30 31, 23 students will
travel to Sacramento State Col
lege for the Northern California
F or en si c Association Tourna
ment. It will feature debates, or
atory and interpretative reading.
Twenty-four other debaters will
attend an Invitational Tourna
ment at Fresno State on Nov. 13-
w ;
Later this year a West Point
; team will arrive at Stanford to
discuss the subject "What Should
Be the United States Policy To
ward Communist Aggression in
Southeast Asia?" Next spring
the University of New Zealand
will debate here.
Delta Sigma Rlio
Connected with the Speech As
sociation is Delta Sigma Rho, na
tional honorary forensic frater
nity. It is dedicated to the en
couragement of forensic activi
ties in American colleges, and
the maintenance of a high stand
ard of public speaking.
The Stanford chapter was or
ganized in 1911 and is the oldest
west of the Rocky Mountains.
Each year debaters of junior or
senior standing are elected to
membership on the basis of ex
cellence; and participation in a
minimum number of debates
with major institutions.
Alumni
Debating and speech at Stan
ford have figured in the back
ground of many prominent alum
ni. Robert McClintoek, presently
the American ambassador to Leb
anon, was captain and leading
speaker of an all-California team
which toured the universities of
England and Scotland in 1930. He
said in a recent letter that his
debating at Stanford has proved
to be the most helpful thing in
preparing him for his career.
Other former Stanford debat
ers are Lawrence Kimpton, chan
cellor of the University of Chi
cago; Frank Church, U.S. Sena
tor from Idaho; Robert R. Gros,
vice-president of the Pacific Gas
and Electric Company; Will Rog
ers. Jr.; Virgil Whitaker, head of
the Stanford English Depart
ment; Thomas Bailey, head of
