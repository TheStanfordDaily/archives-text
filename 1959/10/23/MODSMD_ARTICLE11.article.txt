### Ron Rapoport 
Stanford's football team takes on its most difficult task of the season tomorrow as it goes against
unbeaten Southern California in Ihe Los Angeles Coliseum.
To win this one the Indians will have to play the best football of their lives, because in any one of
three ways on paper they can't win:
1. Comparative records Stanford has won only once while dropping four games. SC is undefeated

and has beaten:
a. A fair team, Oregon State,
b. A good team, the University
of Pittsburgh,
c. An excellent team, Ohio
State, and
d. < And most important) a team
which has beaten Stanford, the
the University of Washington.
2. Statistics thus far—Stanford
admittedly has the top passer in
the country. Also it has two of

the nation's top ends. SC, on the
other hand, has no individual
leaders nationally. It's as a team
that they shine. Nationally they
are eighth in total offense, fourth
in total defense, seventh in rush
ing offense, and fourth in rushing
defense. 'Nuf said.
AAWU-wise too the Trojans
dominate everything. Everything,
that is, except passing which de
partment belongs to you-know
who.
liun, Run, Run
3. (The last of this painful
rundown) rushing—This is what
the SC offense is built around.
They run and run and run.
Not only that but SC Coach
Don Clark is in the enviable posi
tion of not having any one out
standing rushing star; he has
about six.
This makes the Trojan's rush
ing offense, to say the least, un
predictable. About the only play
ers who can't carry the ball are
those who aren't in the game.
They have run 245 running
plays from scrimmage and have
gained a net of 1047 yards. That's
an average of 4.3 yards a try.
AAWLJ's Best
Individually the Tropan run
ners stack up like this. Jerry
Traynham, the top runner in the
AAWU has gained 281 yards for
a 5.6 average. Reports from Los
Angeles yesterday indicated that
Traynham had injured his hand,
but will be able to play at full
strength.
Sophomore Lynn Gaskill has
run 13 plays from scrimmage and
has gained 10.6 yards a try.
Quarterback Willie Wood, by now
fully recovered from his early
season bout with an injury, has
gained 3.7 yards a try, even
though he sat out two games.
Fullback Clark Hoi den has
carried 37 times and has a 3.6
average. That takes care of the
first team.
