# Hard Task Ahead As Cards Meet USC
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
Stanford's football team takes on its most difficult task of the season tomorrow as it goes against
unbeaten Southern California in Ihe Los Angeles Coliseum.
To win this one the Indians will have to play the best football of their lives, because in any one of
three ways on paper they can't win:
1. Comparative records Stanford has won only once while dropping four games. SC is undefeated

and has beaten:
a. A fair team, Oregon State,
b. A good team, the University
of Pittsburgh,
c. An excellent team, Ohio
State, and
d. < And most important) a team
which has beaten Stanford, the
the University of Washington.
2. Statistics thus far—Stanford
admittedly has the top passer in
the country. Also it has two of

the nation's top ends. SC, on the
other hand, has no individual
leaders nationally. It's as a team
that they shine. Nationally they
are eighth in total offense, fourth
in total defense, seventh in rush
ing offense, and fourth in rushing
defense. 'Nuf said.
AAWU-wise too the Trojans
dominate everything. Everything,
that is, except passing which de
partment belongs to you-know
who.
liun, Run, Run
3. (The last of this painful
rundown) rushing—This is what
the SC offense is built around.
They run and run and run.
Not only that but SC Coach
Don Clark is in the enviable posi
tion of not having any one out
standing rushing star; he has
about six.
This makes the Trojan's rush
ing offense, to say the least, un
predictable. About the only play
ers who can't carry the ball are
those who aren't in the game.
They have run 245 running
plays from scrimmage and have
gained a net of 1047 yards. That's
an average of 4.3 yards a try.
AAWLJ's Best
Individually the Tropan run
ners stack up like this. Jerry
Traynham, the top runner in the
AAWU has gained 281 yards for
a 5.6 average. Reports from Los
Angeles yesterday indicated that
Traynham had injured his hand,
but will be able to play at full
strength.
Sophomore Lynn Gaskill has
run 13 plays from scrimmage and
has gained 10.6 yards a try.
Quarterback Willie Wood, by now
fully recovered from his early
season bout with an injury, has
gained 3.7 yards a try, even
though he sat out two games.
Fullback Clark Hoi den has
carried 37 times and has a 3.6
average. That takes care of the
first team.
Halfback Alan Shields, another
sophomore who will be around to
haunt SC opponents for some
time, is averaging 4.4 yards per
carry from scrimmage in 27
carries. Fullback Jim Conroy has
toted the mail 31 times and has
a 4.2 average. Impressive? Down
right scary.
The passing story too is far
from one-sided. Yes, the Indians
have a great passer. One of the

best. Dick Norman has thrown
121 times and connected 65 limes
for 786 yards.
That's nearly three times as
many passes and over twice as
many yards as all the passing SC
has done. The rub here, however,
is that SC has two equally effec
tive passers, not counting friend
Wood who hasn't had a real
chance yet.
Third QB
Ben Charles, listed as third
string qb, has thrown 13 times for
194 yards. A 1 Prukrop, who is .sec
ond string, but first when Wood
is not available, has tossed 18
times for 81 yards.
This, then, is the success story
of SC. Or rather four-elevenths
of it. They have a line too.

Starting with the famous twins;
Mc-Keever by name, Mike and
Marlin. They are both 6-1, both
215 pounds, and both only jun
iors. Also they are both fast and
hit with a ferocity which, thanks
to the Soul bland press, is already
legendary.
Marlin is an end and has caught
six passes for TO yards. Mike
plays left guard. George Van
Vliet is the other end, but when
SC throws passes 1 hey seem to be
usually directed at Marlin be
cause George has only caught
two aerials.
Ficca Tough
The tackles are Dan Ficca and
Ron Mix. Ficca is also a tough
character as he won All-Coast
honors last year when he was
only a sophomore.
A 1 Bansavege will start at right
guard and Dave Morgan drew the
starting center assignment.
The Stanford lino will be solidly
intact for a change as the Cards
can jubilantly welcome back the
full time services of center Doug
Pursell. Doug only played for four
plays last week, since he had a
neck injury, but will be ready
for full-time action this week.
Ends Set
Chris Burford and Ben Robin
son will be ready and at full
strength at the ends as will Phil
Burkland and Gary Pike at the
tackles. .Ron Fernandes and Don
Peier will start at the guard slots.
Dick Bowers and Mac VVylie
will start at the halfs and Skip
Face will open at fullback with
Rick McMillen standing by.


MIKE AND MARLIN—OR IS IT MARIJN AND MIKE?
Is this the Thundering Herd?
