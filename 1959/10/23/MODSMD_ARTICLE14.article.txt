## 
### 
BERKELEY </P> â€” The Univer
sity of California yesterday sus
pended one fraternity chapter for
a year and put another on pro
bation for a year in disciplinary
action for hazing.
Chancellor Glenn T. Seaborg
said the Faculty Committee on
Student Conduct recommended
the penalties and that he fully
concurred.
Suspended is Nu Chapter of
Theta Xi, wherep ledge Donald
S. Wood, a 20-year-old junior
physic major, developed a kid
ney ailment recently after he was
poked in the stomach with a
paddle during an initiation cere
mony. He is being treated at Co
well Memorial Hospital on the
campus for nephritis, and is ex
pected to spend several more
weeks in convalesence.
Suspension of Theta Xi means
the university "will withdraw all
recognition and the living group
will no longer be a part of the
fraternity system on the Berkeley
campus," the chancellor said.
Seven chapter officers, includ
ing senior George Sonne, 20. who
wielded the paddle on Wood, have
been placed on probation for a
year, Seaborg said. He declined
to name the other officers.
lota chapter of Zeta Psi was
nit on probation for hazing six
pledges in ceremonies in which
ihey were "deprived of sleep," for
extended periods and "volunta
rily permitted a small insignia of
he fraternity to be burned" on
heir arm, Seaborg said.
Probation means Zeta Psi will
not be able to carry on social
functions, pledge new members
or hold initiations. Seaborg said.
Theta Xi members can continue
living at the house but as far as
he university is concerned the
"raternity doesn't exist during the
'ear of suspension, Seaborg said.
Officials of both fraternities re
fused to comment.
