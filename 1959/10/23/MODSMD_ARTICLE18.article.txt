# Two Observances
## 
### 
Two DATES of an oddly coincidental nature occur today and tomor
row. Today: the third anniversary of the Hungarian devolution.
Tomorrow: United Nations Day.
In each, we may reflect and see things of significance about the
state of the world in which we live.
In today's anniversary, we can see a deep-sealed fighting heart
and spirit within a group of persons who were determined to
breathe freedom into their homeland.
In setting aside a dav for the UN we are reminded of the efforts
of at least some of its members to find freedom for all peoples of
the world.
The closeness of these two observances mav perhaps prompt us
to contemplate on their interconnections. Did failure of the LJIN
to take really strong action account for tin* defeat of the Hun
garian patriots? Or might some even go so far as to believe 111:11
the (ightrig action of Hungarians played havoc v\ith peace ell'orts
in the UN?
At this point in history, it is impossible to say whether either
the UN or the Hungarian Revolution has succeeded or failed. Cer
tainly there have been main disappointing moments in UN his
tory hut, then, many throughout the world can thank UN aid
for their present improved situations.
In Hungary, it is true that the thumb of Russia still grinds hard.
But if the spirit expressed in the Revolution eventually works to
bring freedom to that country, who can say the Revolution was
in vain?
It's an oddity—the closeness of these two observances. But it's
also a time to pause and give thought to a future which the spirit
of either or both may play a great role in determining.
