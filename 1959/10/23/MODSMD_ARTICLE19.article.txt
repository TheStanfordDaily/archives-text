Cal's men's rooting section is
no longer. It died a violent death
Wednesday night by the bloody
hand of the Executive Committee
of the Associated Students.
Controversy first developed
when Cal played Notre Dame the
week before last. The rooting
section put on a splendid show
throwing gremlins, apple cores,
eggs and anything handy at the
yell leaders, pitching cards into
the air, sending balloons full of
green dye into the air over the
women's section, etc., etc., etc.
An editorial in the Daily Cali
fornian put it this way:
"Last year the team was win
ning and the men's rooting- sec
tion was relatively well-be
haved.
"This, of course, was in viola
tion of all California tradition.
It was too good to last.
"And sure enough!, it didn't"
The new section, integrated
and effective immediately, will
provide seats for athlctic privi
lege card holders on a "First
come, first served" basis, with a
certain section and row desig
nated for each student.
ASUC President Dave Armor
and Vice-President Bill liavvley
sponsored the resolution and Ar
mor cast the vote breaking the
6-6 tie in the Executive Commit
tee meeting.
S t u dent feelings have been
mixed.
One girl commented, "A mixed
rooting section would be safer
and more fun for both sexes—let
the men take out their inhibitions
some place else."
A graduate in educational
psychology said, "The question
of order in the men's rooting
section is omnipresent with
every football season. The de- !
gree to which the disorder re
ceives attention by student
"nvn' e/»n be correlated
—»> recess or
. .he loam. I'm not in
. i or of abolishment."
At least, one student told
Ilawley, "There's going to be
blood splattered all over the
stadium. We're going to storm
the gates, and it won't work."
The president of Interfrater
nity Council was for keeping the
section. "It's true that their con
duct in the game was deplorable,
but I think we should tackle the
problem and solve it instead of
giving up and abolishing the sec
tion."

The men's rooting section has
always been a source of contro
versy on the Berkeley campus.
In 19-16, following Big Game, stu
dents tore up the benches in Me
morial Stadium and started a
bonfire, causing several thousand
dollars' worth of damage.
Too bad, fellows.

In other news at Cal, an 18-
year-old freshman, Fred Moore,
ended his 59-hour hunger strike
against the University's compul
sory military training program
yesterday.
Part of his written explanation
for his protest is as follows:
"I refuse to take ROTC. I
filed an exemption form asking
to be excused from the military
training requirements. I gave
as my reason: I am a con
scent ious objector. ... I object
to killing and any action aiding
war or purpose of war due to
my religious and conscientious
beliefs. It was rejected.
"The Dean of Students made i"
quite clear that I either sign up
and take ROTC or withdraw
from the University.
"This fast is undertaken to
show my earnestness concerning
this problem. I seek to get the
Regents to agree with me not by
force or coercion but by appeal
ing to their better judgment and
understanding."
The strike was backed by thr
ASUC which will hold a mass
meeting today.
Fred headed home yesterday
with his father, an Air Force colo
nel. He has an "honorable dis
missal" from the university.

allowed to grow fat on its ovvi
egoism- carrying this to the ex

seems about as logical to me as ;

Cal's men's rooting section is
no longer. It died a violent death
Wednesday night by the bloody
hand of the Executive Committee
of the Associated Students.
Controversy first developed
when Cal played Notre Dame the
week before last. The rooting
section put on a splendid show
throwing gremlins, apple cores,
eggs and anything handy at the
yell leaders, pitching cards into
the air, sending balloons full of
green dye into the air over the
women's section, etc., etc., etc.
An editorial in the Daily Cali
fornian put it this way:
"Last year the team was win
ning and the men's rooting- sec
tion was relatively well-be
haved.
"This, of course, was in viola
tion of all California tradition.
It was too good to last.
"And sure enough!, it didn't"
The new section, integrated
and effective immediately, will
provide seats for athlctic privi
lege card holders on a "First
come, first served" basis, with a
certain section and row desig
nated for each student.
ASUC President Dave Armor
and Vice-President Bill liavvley
sponsored the resolution and Ar
mor cast the vote breaking the
6-6 tie in the Executive Commit
tee meeting.
S t u dent feelings have been
mixed.
One girl commented, "A mixed
rooting section would be safer
and more fun for both sexes—let
the men take out their inhibitions
some place else."
A graduate in educational
psychology said, "The question
of order in the men's rooting
section is omnipresent with
every football season. The de- !
gree to which the disorder re
ceives attention by student
"nvn' e/»n be correlated
—»> recess or
. .he loam. I'm not in
. i or of abolishment."
At least, one student told
Ilawley, "There's going to be
blood splattered all over the
stadium. We're going to storm
the gates, and it won't work."
The president of Interfrater
nity Council was for keeping the
section. "It's true that their con
duct in the game was deplorable,
but I think we should tackle the
problem and solve it instead of
giving up and abolishing the sec
tion."

The men's rooting section has
always been a source of contro
versy on the Berkeley campus.
In 19-16, following Big Game, stu
dents tore up the benches in Me
morial Stadium and started a
bonfire, causing several thousand
dollars' worth of damage.
Too bad, fellows.

In other news at Cal, an 18-
year-old freshman, Fred Moore,
ended his 59-hour hunger strike
against the University's compul
sory military training program
yesterday.
Part of his written explanation
for his protest is as follows:
"I refuse to take ROTC. I
filed an exemption form asking
to be excused from the military
training requirements. I gave
as my reason: I am a con
scent ious objector. ... I object
to killing and any action aiding
war or purpose of war due to
my religious and conscientious
beliefs. It was rejected.
"The Dean of Students made i"
quite clear that I either sign up
and take ROTC or withdraw
from the University.
"This fast is undertaken to
show my earnestness concerning
this problem. I seek to get the
Regents to agree with me not by
force or coercion but by appeal
ing to their better judgment and
understanding."
The strike was backed by thr
ASUC which will hold a mass
meeting today.
Fred headed home yesterday
with his father, an Air Force colo
nel. He has an "honorable dis
missal" from the university.

Cal's men's rooting section is
no longer. It died a violent death
Wednesday night by the bloody
hand of the Executive Committee
of the Associated Students.
Controversy first developed
when Cal played Notre Dame the
week before last. The rooting
section put on a splendid show
throwing gremlins, apple cores,
eggs and anything handy at the
yell leaders, pitching cards into
the air, sending balloons full of
green dye into the air over the
women's section, etc., etc., etc.
An editorial in the Daily Cali
fornian put it this way:
"Last year the team was win
ning and the men's rooting- sec
tion was relatively well-be
haved.
"This, of course, was in viola
tion of all California tradition.
It was too good to last.
"And sure enough!, it didn't"
The new section, integrated
and effective immediately, will
provide seats for athlctic privi
lege card holders on a "First
come, first served" basis, with a
certain section and row desig
nated for each student.
ASUC President Dave Armor
and Vice-President Bill liavvley
sponsored the resolution and Ar
mor cast the vote breaking the
6-6 tie in the Executive Commit
tee meeting.
S t u dent feelings have been
mixed.
One girl commented, "A mixed
rooting section would be safer
and more fun for both sexes—let
the men take out their inhibitions
some place else."
A graduate in educational
psychology said, "The question
of order in the men's rooting
section is omnipresent with
every football season. The de- !
gree to which the disorder re
ceives attention by student
"nvn' e/»n be correlated
—»> recess or
. .he loam. I'm not in
. i or of abolishment."
At least, one student told
Ilawley, "There's going to be
blood splattered all over the
stadium. We're going to storm
the gates, and it won't work."
The president of Interfrater
nity Council was for keeping the
section. "It's true that their con
duct in the game was deplorable,
but I think we should tackle the
problem and solve it instead of
giving up and abolishing the sec
tion."

The men's rooting section has
always been a source of contro
versy on the Berkeley campus.
In 19-16, following Big Game, stu
dents tore up the benches in Me
morial Stadium and started a
bonfire, causing several thousand
dollars' worth of damage.
Too bad, fellows.

In other news at Cal, an 18-
year-old freshman, Fred Moore,
ended his 59-hour hunger strike
against the University's compul
sory military training program
yesterday.
Part of his written explanation
for his protest is as follows:
"I refuse to take ROTC. I
filed an exemption form asking
to be excused from the military
training requirements. I gave
as my reason: I am a con
scent ious objector. ... I object
to killing and any action aiding
war or purpose of war due to
my religious and conscientious
beliefs. It was rejected.
"The Dean of Students made i"
quite clear that I either sign up
and take ROTC or withdraw
from the University.
"This fast is undertaken to
show my earnestness concerning
this problem. I seek to get the
Regents to agree with me not by
force or coercion but by appeal
ing to their better judgment and
understanding."
The strike was backed by thr
ASUC which will hold a mass
meeting today.
Fred headed home yesterday
with his father, an Air Force colo
nel. He has an "honorable dis
missal" from the university.

SC still reeks from its "prob
lcm."
