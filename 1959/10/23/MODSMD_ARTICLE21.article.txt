Support Moore
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned students
of Stanford University feel com
pelled to offer publicly our sup
port and encouragement of Fred
erick Moore, the University of
California freshman, who has
gone on a hunger strike in order
to protect the integrity of his
beliefs.
Frederick Moore has done no
more than to act according to the
dictates of his conscience; for
his crime or error of judgment
or whatever it is called, he is
threatened with expulsion (that
is, he will be "requested to with
draw" from the University of
California, the state university of
'.lis state of legal residence).
If a citizen of the United States
is not free to act in accordance
with his conscience, he is not
free at all. It is no answer to say
ihat the State of California ex
lends a privilege to Mr. Moore
when it offers to educate him at
a state university, and that this
privilege may be held forth upon
conditions, for under the Con
stitution of the United States,
California is obliged not to dis
criminate against any person on
the basis of his religious beliefs.
Mr. Moore has acted upon prin
ciples which he believes to be
right; whether these principles
spring from belief in any par
icular organized religion, they
ire clearly religious in nature.
That such unjustified pressure
should be brought to bear to
force him from such action, is
nothing less than a flagrant dep
rivation of fundamental civil
liberty.
We therefore appeal to the far
uliy and students of the Univer
sity of California, to all students
ind to all the citizens of this
-itate, to support the action of an
American who has not been afraid
o act upon his beliefs, and to
•xert all legitimate influence
ipon the Board of Regents of
he University of California to re
>eal this unjust and unconscion
ible regulation.

spring from belief in any par
icular organized religion, they
ire clearly religious in nature.
That such unjustified pressure
should be brought to bear to
force him from such action, is
nothing less than a flagrant dep
rivation of fundamental civil
liberty.
We therefore appeal to the far
uliy and students of the Univer
sity of California, to all students
ind to all the citizens of this
-itate, to support the action of an
American who has not been afraid
o act upon his beliefs, and to
•xert all legitimate influence
ipon the Board of Regents of
he University of California to re
>eal this unjust and unconscion
ible regulation.

We, the undersigned students
of Stanford University feel com
pelled to offer publicly our sup
port and encouragement of Fred
erick Moore, the University of
California freshman, who has
gone on a hunger strike in order
to protect the integrity of his
beliefs.
Frederick Moore has done no
more than to act according to the
dictates of his conscience; for
his crime or error of judgment
or whatever it is called, he is
threatened with expulsion (that
is, he will be "requested to with
draw" from the University of
California, the state university of
'.lis state of legal residence).
If a citizen of the United States
is not free to act in accordance
with his conscience, he is not
free at all. It is no answer to say
ihat the State of California ex
lends a privilege to Mr. Moore
when it offers to educate him at
a state university, and that this
privilege may be held forth upon
conditions, for under the Con
stitution of the United States,
California is obliged not to dis
criminate against any person on
the basis of his religious beliefs.
Mr. Moore has acted upon prin
ciples which he believes to be
right; whether these principles
spring from belief in any par
icular organized religion, they
ire clearly religious in nature.
That such unjustified pressure
should be brought to bear to
force him from such action, is
