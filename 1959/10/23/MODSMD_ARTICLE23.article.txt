The cocktail party wits (orig
inal thinkers, all of them) with
: their Ivy League hair-cuts, bur
nished hiown suits and pipes to
match, were of course fascinated
by Gentleman John Painter's
latest "Chappie" masterpiece,
"Success Is a Frame of Mind."
1 disagree, not because he is a
| corrupter of youth and a teacher
1 of evil, not because his contribu-
I lion is obviously a reject from
Adam, Nugget, Man or Playboy,
! but rather because well-read and
i urban as he appears, Painter just
| can't for the life of him spell "T.
S. Eliot."

Foreign Opinion
Fditor, The Daily:
Re your editorial comment on !
I my letter suggesting the estab
j lishment of a Daily Column for
foreign student opinion. "The

Bridge," a publication unlisted
on registration day, which has a
growing but still somewhat
limited circulation, appears only
at three monthly intervals, hard
ly a regular vehicle for foreign
student opinion.
Very little space appears to he
given to "Letters to tlie Editor"
despite the space used for the
daily printing of the head of that
column. Having looked through
past issues ii appears that seldom
does a student, foreign or other
wise, other than staffers, have
articles accepted.
Itay B. Coiichinan,
Fnglish Foreign Student.
Fditor's Note: l.ittle spurt* has
been given to letters because few
have been written. All signed let
ters have been printed, and will
continue to be printed. We have
again, however, received several
unsigned letters which are thus
unacceptable.
