# Six Stanford Students Learn Russian Through Intensified 'Crash Program'
## 
### Marie Prior 
Six Stan t' ord students re
nounced their native English lan
guage and spoke only Russian
for six weeks during a unique
language experiment entailing a
month's stay in Russia this sum
mer.
David Hamilton, Jonnet Kerns,
Ed Nordby, Mary Patzer, Ruth
Radford, and Ed Walker were se
lected from first- and second-year
Russian classes to be members of
a group of 20 college students
sponsored by the Inter-University
Commission on Travel Grants of
Indiana University, made possible
by the Carnegie Corporation. By
using these students as "guinea
pigs," the Carnegie Corporation
hoped to prove that Russian, or
any language, can be learned by
a "crash program" technique.
To accomplish this goal the
students first attended an intense
language summer school, eight
weeks at Indiana University for
the first-year students and six
weeks at Middlebury College for
the second-year linguists. After
taking tests designed to analyze
their understanding and aptitude
for Russian, Ihe students depart
ed for Russia. Their skill was im
mediately put to test on a Rus
sian boat, and from that point on
no English was spoken.
The experimenters were the
first group of American under
graduate Russian - speaking stu

dents to visit Russia, and they re
mained there the 30-day time lim
it which tourists are allowed.
"You cannot be a capable tour
ist," stated Hamilton, "unless you
can speak Russian. Not only
does a knowledge of the language
enable you to read street signs
but also to better know and un
derstand the people."
"Russians, detecting that we
weren't natives by our accent,
took us for many nationalities
but never American. They were
amazed to discover Ihat there
were actually students in the
United States who could speak

their language," commented Miss
Patzer. "But," added Miss Kerns,
"they were warm, friendly and
intensely curious about Ameri
cans and anything American."
During their 30-day sojourn the
students visited Leningrad, Mos
cow, Stalingrad, Rostov -on - the-
Don and Kiev. They stayed in
hotels, but many had the oppor
tunity to visit Russian homes. "I
met one Ukrainian man who told
me he liked me because I was the
daughter of a workingman but
would have liked me less had I
been the daughter of a capital
ist," said Miss Radford.
On their return to the United
States, the Russian skill of the
experimental group was again
tested. The Carnegie Corpora
tion will decide, on the basis of
these tests and the evaluations
of the students, if the program
was a success.

Six Stan t' ord students re
nounced their native English lan
guage and spoke only Russian
for six weeks during a unique
language experiment entailing a
month's stay in Russia this sum
mer.
David Hamilton, Jonnet Kerns,
Ed Nordby, Mary Patzer, Ruth
Radford, and Ed Walker were se
lected from first- and second-year
Russian classes to be members of
a group of 20 college students
sponsored by the Inter-University
Commission on Travel Grants of
Indiana University, made possible
by the Carnegie Corporation. By
using these students as "guinea
pigs," the Carnegie Corporation
hoped to prove that Russian, or
any language, can be learned by
a "crash program" technique.
To accomplish this goal the
students first attended an intense
language summer school, eight
weeks at Indiana University for
the first-year students and six
weeks at Middlebury College for
the second-year linguists. After
taking tests designed to analyze
their understanding and aptitude
for Russian, Ihe students depart
ed for Russia. Their skill was im
mediately put to test on a Rus
sian boat, and from that point on
no English was spoken.
The experimenters were the
first group of American under
graduate Russian - speaking stu

dents to visit Russia, and they re
mained there the 30-day time lim
it which tourists are allowed.
"You cannot be a capable tour
ist," stated Hamilton, "unless you
can speak Russian. Not only
does a knowledge of the language
enable you to read street signs
but also to better know and un
derstand the people."
"Russians, detecting that we
weren't natives by our accent,
took us for many nationalities
but never American. They were
amazed to discover Ihat there
were actually students in the
United States who could speak

their language," commented Miss
Patzer. "But," added Miss Kerns,
"they were warm, friendly and
intensely curious about Ameri
cans and anything American."
During their 30-day sojourn the
students visited Leningrad, Mos
cow, Stalingrad, Rostov -on - the-
Don and Kiev. They stayed in
hotels, but many had the oppor
tunity to visit Russian homes. "I
met one Ukrainian man who told
me he liked me because I was the
daughter of a workingman but
would have liked me less had I
been the daughter of a capital
ist," said Miss Radford.
