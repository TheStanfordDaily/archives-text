# Nobel Award Under Fire

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (#>) -
The Swedish Academy drew
Swedish criticism yesterday for
awarding the 1959 Nobel Prize in
literature to Italian poet Salva
tore Quasimodo.
The Stockholm newspaper Aft
onbladet suggested there are sev
eral more deserving writers
around.
"After its incursion into the
heroic with last year's prize to
Pasternak, the Academy has re
turned to a safe middle position,"
the influential Socialist organ
complained.
Award of the 1958 prize to Boris
Pasternak, the Soviet author of
"Doctor Zhivago," aroused an in
ternational controversy. His
novel, banned in the Soviet Union,
is critical of communism. Under
Communist pressure, Pasternak
turned down the award.
Aftonbladet declared the Acad
emy has been too cautious at
times in the past, awarding the
coveted citations and cash to
mediocre writers whose words
afterward "become more and
more banal."
