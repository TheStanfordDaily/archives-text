# Soccer Team Goes Visiting Oft-Beaten SF State Gators
## Daily Sports 
### 
Goalies are at a premium willi
most soccer teams. Stanford is
lucky in that it has three goalies
that can come into a game and
! give a better than average ac
count of themselves.
Bill Dittman was an All-Ameri
! can last year and was a shoo-in
for ihe first string job until he
i contracted mononucleosis. Tony
Chanler took over for one game
and was not spectacular, but he
did Ihe job.
Hunt Baseom moved up from
i 'ho JayVees and was so spectacu
lar that many were wondering if
Dittman could regain his job after
he recovered from his illness.
Thus far in the season, there
have been no complaints about the
defense. Centerhalf Wolfgang
Stojch has been the most spectac
ular defensive player in the
league. Fullbacks Dan Farthing
land Tom Lief leave little to be
1 desired when it comes to screen

ing a wing from the goal. On the
whole, the defense has given up
only four goals in two league
games, which is an envious
record.
The offense has been spotty
and, with the exception of occa
sional spurts against the Cal
Aggies, has been almost dormant
in league games. If Rune Enge
bretsen can snap out of his
slump, the offense will go. Enge
bretsen has been handicapped by
the absence of his high-scoring
partner Dick Bartlett from parts
of the two league games because
of injuries. If Bartlett can play
most of Saturday's game with
the Gators, then both players
could break out in a rash of
goals that would leave the Gators
wondering what happened.
San Francisco is winless on the
league season, its record bright
ened only by a tie. The game will
be played on the Gator home
soccer field at 11.

Stojch has been the most spectac
ular defensive player in the
league. Fullbacks Dan Farthing
land Tom Lief leave little to be
1 desired when it comes to screen

ing a wing from the goal. On the
whole, the defense has given up
only four goals in two league
games, which is an envious
record.
The offense has been spotty
and, with the exception of occa
sional spurts against the Cal
Aggies, has been almost dormant
in league games. If Rune Enge
bretsen can snap out of his
slump, the offense will go. Enge
bretsen has been handicapped by
the absence of his high-scoring
partner Dick Bartlett from parts
of the two league games because
of injuries. If Bartlett can play
most of Saturday's game with
the Gators, then both players
could break out in a rash of
goals that would leave the Gators
wondering what happened.
San Francisco is winless on the
league season, its record bright
ened only by a tie. The game will
be played on the Gator home
soccer field at 11.
