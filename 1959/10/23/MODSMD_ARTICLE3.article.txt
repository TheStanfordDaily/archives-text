The llR's Current Affairs
Panel, on admission of Red China
to the United Nations, held last
night in the Delta Chi house, dis
cussed the problem in the light of
the role of the U.N. today and to
morrow.
George Chow of Nationalist
China argued that the Chinese
people were firmly opposed to ad
mitting Communist China to the
U.N. since il did not truly repre
sent the people. He also objected
on the grounds that Communist
China has followed an aggressive
policy in Korea, Indochina, Laos,
and Tibet which is against the
U.N. charter requirements for
admission of new nations.
John Isherwood of England
based his argument for admitting
Rod China on his premise that
we must "live with the world as
we find it, not as we wish it."
It is wrong, ho feels, to allow one
fourth of the world's population
to go unrepresented in Iho U.N.
Woody Moyle, representing the
United States, took the view that
the U.S. and the U.N. would gain
nothing by admitting Red China
and would loose prestige and a
moral point.
Dilip Adarkav of India used the
example of the U.N. as a "good
boy's club" whose purpose is the
exchange of opinions. Rod China
should have a right to express its
opinions like other nations.
