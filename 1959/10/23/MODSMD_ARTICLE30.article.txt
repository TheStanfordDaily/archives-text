# BOTH HOPING
## Smell of Roses in the Air For Washington, Oregon 
### 
The scent of roses will defi
nitely be in the air tomorrow
when the undefeated Oregon
Webfoots ho-st Ihe University of
Washington in the West Coast's
top football contest.
Both Washington and Oregon
are strong contenders for the
1960 Rose Bowl berth. The Ducks
have won five straight contests
and the Huskies have won four
of five.
The only loss suffered by the
Washingtonians was at the hands
of the West's top team, the USC
Trojans. The Huskies lost that
one by the narrow margin of 22-
15.
Last week the Webfoots cashed
in with their best effort of the
year when they dumped the high
ly rated Air Force Academy 20-3.
Since USC is ineligible for the
Rose Bowl in 1960, it appears that
the only three teams left in con
tention are UCLA, Oregon and
Washington.
UCLA, after squeaking by Cal
last week 19-12, will meet the Air
Force Academy tonight in Los
Angeles. Ray Smith, captain and

fullback for the Bruins, will be
called on to do yeoman service
against the Falcons.
Smith, the leading ground gain
er on the UCLA squad, picked up
119 yards rushing against Cal
last week.
Two years ago when the Fal
cons were in their first season of
football, the Bruins whipped
them 47-0. The Air Force hopes
to revenge that defeat tonight.
The University of California,
looking for its second victory this
season, will play the Oregon
State Beavers at Berkeley tomor
row. The Beavers will also be
looking for the second triumph.
Last Saturday the Beavers dis
posed of Idaho's Vandals 66-18
and the word from Corvallis is
that the Beavers finally have
their offense rolling.
Idaho looks like it's in for an
other -shellacking this weekend as
they take on the Washington
State Cougars. The Cougars sud
denly came to life last week in
their 36-19 victory over Stanford,
and are predicted to do even more
scoring against the Vandals.
