# Can Tribe Win? Well...Maybe

Can Stanford beat Southern California?
It's a good thing that the answer to questions like that one are
not decided by a vote, for if they were it would be foolhardy for any
member of the Stanford football team to poke his nose outdoors to
morrow.
Look, for instance, at the predictions box elsewhere in today's

sports section. For the first time
since the season began not a
single picker has stuck with the
Cards.
Or take a typical representative
of the San Francisco press. He's
been covering Stanford's gridiron
fortunes for years and, more than
just incidentally, he's a Stanford
alum. This is what he has to say:
". . . Sending (the Indians)
against tho Thundering Herd
might well come under the head
ing of cruelty to college kids.
Perhaps some congressional sub
committee should investigate the
match with an eye toward calling
it off for the good of the game
and the physical welfare of the
poor Indian."
He says more, things like hav
ing each Trojan tie one hand be
hind his back, but it gets rather
silly and is painful to read.
This, then, is the attitude of the
press. Stanford is going to get
whomped and there is no help
for it.
Well, is there anybody who
holds out hope for the Tribe?
The answer to this one is yes. and
happily those who think that the
men from Troy are beatable arc
the only ones who have a chance
to beat them.
Jack Curtice head coach, speaks
now:
I've never gone into a game
that I didn't think that I could
win. Sure, the odds may be rug
ged but I believe I'd quit coach
ing if I didn't think I could win
and I think the kids feel that
way too.
Indeed they do, coach, indeed
they do. Try sampling the opinion
of a couple of fullbacks.
Skip Face says simply, "We
can beat them. On paper it looks
like no contest, but the game isn't
played on paper. We're working
real hard and not believing
everything we read about not hav
ing a chance."

thusly:
I know we can win. I j
wouldn't feel like I wanted to be
on the team otherwise. The team
knows they can win and that
makes a big difference.
Rounding out the opinions is I
Chuck Taylor, assistant athletic
director. "We will win. Curtice's |
style of play is the type that will

| heat SC."
Incurably optomistic, you say?
Quite possibly. Then again, The
forecasters don't all have perfect
or even nearly perfect records and
as for that San Francisco writer,
well we think he's trying to put
he hex on the Trojans.
Maybe he will, and maybe to-
I morrow we will.
