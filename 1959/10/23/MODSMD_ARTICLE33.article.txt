# FACE SC, UCLA, AF
## Cross-Country Squad in Quadrangular 
### 
This is the weekend for trips
and Stanford's cross-country team
is taking one too.
The thinclads will journey to
LA for a quadrangular affair
with UCLA, SC\ and the Air
Force. Making the trip for the
Cards will be Keith Wallace, Boh
Monzingo, Bertil Lundh, Kim
i vlaxweJl, Ernie Cunliffe, and
John North way.
The meet shapes up to be a
tight one with the condition of
the Stanford runners playing an
important part in the Indian's
fortunes.
Wallace has been having some
achille's tendon problems, but
should be sufficiently recovered
j to come through with a top per
ormance. Monzingo has had a

cold, but he too should be able to
run with no ill effects.
The most improved team in the
meet will undoubtedly be the Air
Force. The fly-boys have won
three impressive meels so far
this year from Oklahoma State,
University of Colorado, and the
Nebraska State Teachers.
Southern Cal took a triangular
meet against UCLA and Cal last
week and should also make a
strong victory bid tomorrow. Top
runners for the Trojans are
Fernando Leon, a greatly im
proved runner over last year, and
Pete Rodriguez. Leon took sev
enth in the PCC meet last year
and Rodriguez finished fifth. SC's
squads are note I for their good
team running.
