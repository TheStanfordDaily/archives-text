# Papooses Meet SC Freshmen In Toughest Contest of Season
## 
### Chuck Bischoff 
The Papoose gridders will be
facing their toughest game to
morrow morning as they meet
the USC frosh in a preliminary
game in the Coliseum.
The past week the squad has
worked to polish its attack and
to correct the defensive errors J
which allowed Cal to make many I
long gains. v
Careful analysis of game I
movies and the pinpointing of
costly mistakes should serve to !
make this a sounder football
team. The defense will have to bo
improved, especially against pass
ing. for the USC frosh showed
a top passing attack in their
game last week.
Unfortunately, the frosh may I
not enter the game at full !
strength. First string right guard !
Sieve Player, the top lineman on
the team, has been out all week
with an ankle injury, and it is
doubtful that he will see much
action.
The Stanford freshmen, like the
varsity, will be underdogs against 1
the men from Trov. But the Pa

pooses, led by game co-captains
Ed Cummings and Tom Fether
ston, will be looking for their
second upset victory of the year.
Last year's game ended with the
Indian frosh on the short end,
14 to 6.

morrow morning as they meet
the USC frosh in a preliminary
game in the Coliseum.
The past week the squad has
worked to polish its attack and
to correct the defensive errors J
which allowed Cal to make many I
long gains. v
Careful analysis of game I
movies and the pinpointing of
costly mistakes should serve to !
make this a sounder football
team. The defense will have to bo
improved, especially against pass
ing. for the USC frosh showed
a top passing attack in their
game last week.
Unfortunately, the frosh may I
not enter the game at full !
strength. First string right guard !
Sieve Player, the top lineman on
the team, has been out all week
with an ankle injury, and it is
doubtful that he will see much
action.
The Stanford freshmen, like the
varsity, will be underdogs against 1
the men from Trov. But the Pa

pooses, led by game co-captains
Ed Cummings and Tom Fether
ston, will be looking for their
second upset victory of the year.
Last year's game ended with the
Indian frosh on the short end,
14 to 6.
