# Cards Battle Troy to Wire--But Fall, 30-28
## Passing Attack Clicks; Near Upset for Indians 
### Ron Rapoport 
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM Someday the people who make up
the college football rules will decide that besides a won and lost
column there should be one for moral victories. When I hat happens
Stanford will be one of the top teams in the country.
Saturday's 30-28 loss to Sounthern California was another of these

almost-but-not-quite-an-upset af
fairs which gives the Tribe a
total of one win, two losses and
four moral victories in their last
seven outings.
The 28 points which the In
dians tallied against Troy mark
seven more than the total points
that the Trojans have allowed
in their previous four games of
the season.
Stanford came from behind
twice in the first half to grab a
21-12 halftime lead and it wasn't
until the first few minutes of the
final quarter that SC's running
finally caught up with the Tribe
and put Troy ahead for good.
Amazing Running
The Trojan's running game,
which can only be described as
amazing, amassed a total of 375
yards. One-hundred twenty-five
of these were credited to fullback
Clark Holden, who equalled an SC
record by scoring four times on
runs, of 22, four, one and 21 yards.
It was Dick Norman's passing
that kept Stanford in the game
and gave the Indians their scores.
Norman completed 16 aerials out
of 32 tries for 207 yards. Eleven
of these completions however,
came in the first half and it
wasn't until late in the fourth
quarter, after the Troyboys had
done all of their scoring, that he
connected on any more.
Chris Burford was Norman's
favorite received again as the
fine end pulled down five tosses
for 46 yards and two touchdowns.
Many Breaks
Even though the offenses of
both squads were outstandingly
potent, a large portion of the
,scores were accounted for by
what are usually referred to as
the breaks of the game.
For instance when the Trojans
were ahead 12-6 midway in the
second period, a Stanford drive
was sustained by a penalty. The
Tribe had the ball fourth down
and seven on the SC 47 and Rick
McMillcn punted. A holding
penalty was called on SC which
gave the Indians a first down and
a fresh chance to score.
Score they did eight plays
later as Skip Face hauled the
pigskin over from I he three.
This run of Face's incidentally
was one of a few surprises turned
in by a Stanford runner.
Fine Effort
Skip took a pitchout and circled
wide around his left end. He
was hit by Trojan linemen twice,
but both times broke away and
just did manage to cross the goal
line before the sideline stripe. An
excellent effort.
The next Tribe TD was set up
by a Trojan fumble as SC quart
erback Willie Wood pitched out to
Angelo Coia who hobbled the ball
on the SC 22 where Indian tackle
Cap Ingham recovered.
After a five yard penalty
Norman hit Mac Wylie with a
pass on the Trojan twelve and
two plays later he found Burford
in the end zone with a jump pass.
The Trojans too owe at least
one of their tallies to a lucky
break.
Deflection —Interception
Early in the second half Nor
man threw a hard jump pass
which hit SC lineman Dan Ficca,
bounced high in the air and was
retrieved by fleet Trojan back
Bob Levingston, who returned it
to the Stanford 33.
Holden and Jerry Traynham.
another in SC's seemingly inex
haustable collection of fine run
ning backs, took turns carrying
uj) to the Card four and Holden
cracked over for the score.
The effectiveness of the SC
running attack, as related to their
passing, can be pointed out in
another way.
Willie Wood, one of the Tro
jan's three field generals, made
his only really lengthy appear
ance in the game in the first
