## 
### 
BULLETIN
HAVANA — An Ameri
can was injured slightly yester
day after lie inadvertently drove
his car through an ambush set
up by Cuban sailors disguised
a* peasants, police said. The
sailors were expecting a light
plane to land on the dark high
way outside Havana.
Patrick Kinney, 28, of Ab
sarokee, Mont., an employee of
a local steel-processing com
pany, and his wife were fired
on after four men tried to flag
them down with waving arms
and blinking flashlights.
HAVANA (/Pt —The progovern
ment press and radio yesterday
summoned Cubans to a massive
rally today to protest "foreign
aggression," a cold reference to
the United States.
Prime Minister Fidel Castro,
beset by the gravest crisis in his
'en months of power, originally
called the rally to protest "aerial
attacks against nationall terri
tory."
But as sound trucks blared
through the streets and radio
broadcasts called on the people
to rally, the theme was switched
to "foreign aggression."
The Cuban Labor Confedera
tion prepared more than a million
badges reading "against foreign
aggression" to be distributed
when demonstrators begin assem
bling at the presidential palace
today.
Joining in the call for at least
a million Cubans to turn out. the
confederation has ordered a gen
eral work shutdown for noon to
give workers a chance to attend
the rally. The shutdown applies

to Havana and three neighboring
provinces.
The aggression charge is an ap
parent allusion to what Castro
claims are bombings and straf
ings by planes manned by "war
criminals" based in the United
States. U.S. authorities here have
said they have found no evidence
of any bombing or strafing al
though light planes have been
heckling Havana with leaflet
dropping missions.
