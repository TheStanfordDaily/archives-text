# ‘Moon Besieged’ Has Theater ‘First’
## 
### Mary Lou Mckinley 
When "The Moon Besieged" opens in Me
morial Auditorium Wednesday night, a new
aspect in the history of the theater will be
used for the first time.
A roll of drums coming through the audi
ence and finally focusing on one playing area
of the stage for the beginning of the first act
will signal the initial use of stereophonic
sound in the theater. It also will be used in
Mary Martin's new show which is opening
soon in New York, but its first trial will be
at Stanford.
'Very Experimental'
According to Sam Reis, sound co-ordinator
for Seyril Scho chen's Ford Foundation
award-winning drama, the sound is "very
experimental," not only for Stanford, but for
theater in general.
"We are trying to synchronize every
thing." he added, with perfect co-ordination
between sound, lights and the projections of
Civil War scenes which will be cast on the
two side walls of the auditorium between
scenes.
A group of about 20 boys from tlve Palo
Alto High School has recorded eight authen
tic songs from the Civil War period which
were included as an integral part of the

script.
Under the direction of Marjorie Klein, Reis
said, the group worked on the recordings
during their lunch hours and at night to
capture the spirit of the young soldiers of
the war in their camps," many of whom were
away from home for the first time.
No Attempt at Coordination
Because of the individualness of camp-fire
•singing, there has been no real attempt to
co-ordinate the voices, Reis explained. Ac
companied by a banjo, two guitars, harmon
ica, drums and accordion, the singing will re
flect the loneliness which characterized the
period, he continued*.
From the opening drums and chorus, all
the music is co-ordinated with the play's ac
tion, from the recurring love song "Shenan
doah" to spirited hoe-downs and a revival
type song which ends the first act.
Kft'eet of Battle
At the end of act two when John Brown
and his men are going to Harper's Ferry,
the sound of drums will come in again, giv
ing the effect of the actual battle, and pro
ceed from tlie stage out through the audi
ence. This effect again will be used at the
end of the play.
Starring in the Stanford Players' produc
tion will be Ben Cooper, who has been work

ing in Iho fields of radio, television and mov
ies. as well as on the stage, for 16 years.
Cooper will portray Oliver Brown, son of
the abolitionist John Brown, who will be
played by Alvin S. Kaufman. Kaufman, pres
ently working on his doctorate here, is an as
sistant professor ol' speech at Fresno State
College.
Playing Oliver's young wife Martha will
be Julia Curtis, a Stanford student who ap
peared in several productions here last year.
Peninsula actress At ha Hillback will por
tray John Brown's wife.

morial Auditorium Wednesday night, a new
aspect in the history of the theater will be
used for the first time.
A roll of drums coming through the audi
ence and finally focusing on one playing area
of the stage for the beginning of the first act
will signal the initial use of stereophonic
sound in the theater. It also will be used in
Mary Martin's new show which is opening
soon in New York, but its first trial will be
at Stanford.
'Very Experimental'
According to Sam Reis, sound co-ordinator
for Seyril Scho chen's Ford Foundation
award-winning drama, the sound is "very
experimental," not only for Stanford, but for
theater in general.
"We are trying to synchronize every
thing." he added, with perfect co-ordination
between sound, lights and the projections of
Civil War scenes which will be cast on the
two side walls of the auditorium between
scenes.
A group of about 20 boys from tlve Palo
Alto High School has recorded eight authen
tic songs from the Civil War period which
were included as an integral part of the

script.
Under the direction of Marjorie Klein, Reis
said, the group worked on the recordings
during their lunch hours and at night to
capture the spirit of the young soldiers of
the war in their camps," many of whom were
away from home for the first time.
No Attempt at Coordination
Because of the individualness of camp-fire
•singing, there has been no real attempt to
co-ordinate the voices, Reis explained. Ac
companied by a banjo, two guitars, harmon
ica, drums and accordion, the singing will re
flect the loneliness which characterized the
period, he continued*.
From the opening drums and chorus, all
the music is co-ordinated with the play's ac
tion, from the recurring love song "Shenan
doah" to spirited hoe-downs and a revival
type song which ends the first act.
Kft'eet of Battle
At the end of act two when John Brown
and his men are going to Harper's Ferry,
the sound of drums will come in again, giv
ing the effect of the actual battle, and pro
ceed from tlie stage out through the audi

end of the play.
Starring in the Stanford Players' produc
