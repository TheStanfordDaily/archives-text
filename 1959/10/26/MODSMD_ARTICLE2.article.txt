### Bob Payne Associate Editor 
The athletics didn't stop at
football Saturday afternoon in
the Los Angeles Coliseum. As if
the Stanford Southern Cal grid
thriller wasn't enough, the two
cheering sections staged a couple
of minor brawls.
Stanford's rooters, just like the
Card gridders, were faced with
odds of superior numbers. And
the SC rooters, like the Trojan
gridders, knew they had been in
a fight.
SC's ingenious fans started the
day's extra-curricular activity by
stealing a "Trojan Bull" head
that Stanford was bringing on
the field to challenge Bill (the
torero himself) Kartozian. This
action was met by vigorous pro
test from Kartozian and assist
ants, plus a few of the Indians
closest at hand.
S t a n 112 or d retaliated at half
time by stealing, as is customary,
the Trojan helmet of an SC band
member. This really incensed the
rooters, for many of the Trojans
stormed across the field for more
battling. The fisticuffs were
many, the deputy sheriffs joined
in, and the helmet managed to
wind up high in the Cards' small
cheering section.
Whereupon a trade was pro
posed—helmet for bull's head.
SC got grabby, however, and
more fighting ensued. At which
point a -sheriff lost his hat (which
also wound up in the cheering
section).
But finally the Trojans got
their helmet, and slunk back
across the Coliseum. It was yet
another moral victory for Stan
ford.
