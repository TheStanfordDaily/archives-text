# TALKING ABOUT
## Foreign Opinion 
### Doug Willis 
How can we improve commun
ications between foreign students
who come to Stanford and the
many American students who
would like to meet them and to
exchange ideas?
Every year this question arises
and every year new solutions
are sought. This year, a sizable
number of foreign students, many
of whom signed a Letter to the
Editor appearing on this page to
day, have suggested that a for
eign student opinion column ap
pearing regularly in the Daily
would be a step toword solving
this problem.
Tin* Daily has pointed out
that present outlets for foreign
students opinion exist both in
the Letters to the Editor col
umns of the Daily and in the
Bridge, a quarterly campus
magazine composed of interpre
tive and commentary articles
written by foreign students.
Most American students inter- j
viewed said that a foreign stu-|
dent column sounded like a good
idea. "I would like it if they
wrote about current events," said i
one student, "but I wouldn't read I
it if it was just talk about their
homelands or what they think of
Stanford."
Several students said that they
would like to read foreign stu
dent views on "just about any
subject, because they have a dif
ferent perspective."
Turkish foreign stud en <
Nusrel Yazar suggested that
the column might set foreign
students apart even more.
"Daily articles about foreign
students and the I Center would
help communication more than
a column," he said.
"The Daily is often thought of
as an isolated, dominating group,"
Yazar continued, and many for
eign students don't feel that they
can express their views through
the Daily.
English foreign scholar Ray B. j
Couchman explained some of his
ideas about how a foreign student |
column might be set up:
"It is to be emphasized that
such a column is not intended
to differentiate in any way be
tween foreign and American stu
dent.
"On the other hand, while we
are all students at Stanford, our
experiences, ideals and cultural I
backgrounds differ, and nothing!

but good could come from an ex
pression and exchange of ideas
in a foreign student column
; speeificly set aside for that pur
pose.
"There seems to he an idea
current that this column is in
tended for daily and vociferous
criticism o 1 tli e American
scene. It must be emphasized
again that articles appearing in
this column would cover a wide
variety of topics: travel, humor,
comment on political issues
and current affairs related to
the student's home country and
descriptions of folkways and
| cultures, religions observances
j and legends."
Foreign Scholar John Boot of
Holland was a little skeptical of
the proposed column. He sug
gested that there were only two
things that a foreign student
could comment on that Ameri
i can students couldn't do just as
1 well: his own country and its
j politics, etc. and how he sees
America."And I'm quite sure
that the same things would end
! up being said again and again."
James Howe, another English
j foreign student, agreed that a
foreign student opinion column
would be beneficial to the entire
campus, but he thought lhat ihe
column should contain comment
on the social and educational
structure of Stanford and on cur
rent issues.
"The Daily is a taenia! pa
per," Howe observed, "but it
seemed loathe to give interpre
tations and views. We feel that
new views would come from
foreign students."
Makonnen Amlak of Ethiopia
said that he did not feel that there
is a satisfactory outlet for foreign
student opinion. "I think that
the foreign students would bene
fit from a column," he concluded.
llelene La Koehe, a second
year foreign scholar from
France, noted that there is still
a Letters to the Kditors column,
"but with their own column,
foreign students will hesitate
less."
Another foreign student ex
plained the value of foreign stu
dent observations of Stanford life.
Foreign students are "standing
on the edge of a stream, rather
than beftig in the current," and
' perhaps they can sec bell or where
! the stream is going.
