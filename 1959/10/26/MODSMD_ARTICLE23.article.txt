Effective Society
Fdilor, The Daily:
Mr. Stinson and I scorn to dif
fer about what makes our society
an "effective" one. I did not men
tion any criteria of effectiveness
beyond implying that lack of crit
icism is one of the features es
sential to the working acceptance
of our society.
Mr. Stinson disagrees and says
that our society is (or could bei
based upon active implementa
tion of the processes of debate
and criticism after the fashion of
J. Stuart Mill.
That such a proposal might
imply recognition of an intelli
gent elite capable of such dis
cussion would, 1 suggest, disturb
a great number of democratic
prejudices, not to speak of Stin
soin himself.
More interesting, are Mr. St bi
son's criteria of effectiveness
(whether or not the outcome of
democratic debate) namely,
moon rockets and H-bombs.
Quito typical, I should say, is
Mi'. Stinson's willingness to dis
cuss democracy, our way of life
and so forth, to the background
music of death and destruction
accepted as the boundaries of the
intellectual or American life.
With those conditions unques
tioned. it is not at all unlikely
that those of Mr. Stinson's ilk
will find themselves perfectly ad
justed to both and as a further
flourish of mental health engag
ing in discussions of democracy.

Good Rejections
Fditur, The Daily:
Mr. Erickson, you wrote a
good Icier Friday, but I'll
have you know I've been rejected
by better magazines than Play
boy. As for h'liot, he handles his
affairs, and I handle mine.
