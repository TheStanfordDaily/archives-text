# MEET BURNELL RICHARDSON AND DICK MASLOWSKI
## 
### 
They're transmission engineers with Michigan
Hell Telephone Company in Detroit. Burned
graduated from Western Michigan in 19.") I
with a B.S. in Physics, spent four years in
the Navy, then joined the telephone company.
His present work is with carrier systems, as
they relate to Direct Distance Dialing facilities.
Dick got his B.S.E.E. degree from Michigan
in 1956 and came straight to Michigan Bell.
He is currently engineering and administering
a program to utilize new. transistorized re
peater (amplifier) equipment.
Both men are well qualified to answer a
question you might well he asking yourself:
'*\\ hat's in telephone company engineering
for me?"

SAYS DICK:

"There's an interesting day's work for you
every day. really have to use your engi
neering training and you're always working
with new developments. Every time Bell Lab
oratories designs a new and more efficient
pieee of equipment, you are challenged to in
corporate it in our system effectively and
economically. For example, I have heen work
ing on projects utilizing a newly developed
voice frequency amplifier. It's a plug-in type
— transistorized — and consumes only two
watts, so il lias lots of advantages. But I have
to figure out where and how il can he used in
our sprawling network to provide new and
improved service. Technological developments
like this really put spice in the job."'

SAYS BURNELL:

"Training helps, too —and von gel tlie best.
Through an interdepartmental training uro
gram. you Irani how company-wide operations
dovetail. V>u also gel a broad background bv
rotation of assignments. I'm now working
with earl ier systems, but previously worked on
repeater (amplifier) projeels as Dirk is doing
now. Most important. I think you always learn
'praetieal engineering. »11 constantly search
for the solution that will he most economical
in the long run."
There's more, of course—but vou can gel
the whole story from the Hell interviewer.
He'll be visiting your campus before long, lie
Mire to -it down and talk with him.
