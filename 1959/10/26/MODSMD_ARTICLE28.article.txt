# USC Mentor Lauds Cards

### 
Trojan Coach Don Clark said
what nearly everybody connected
with the Stanford football team
must have thought at one time or
another during the current sea
son.
"If Stanford put together one
complete game," said the SC
coach in ihe dressing room after
the game, "they could beat any
one in the country."
Clark was profuse in his praise
of the Tribe's effort. As expected
he had much 1o say about Stan
ford Quarterback Dick Norman.
"It's pretty difficult to rush
ihe passer when he can throw a
jump pass after taking one or
two steps," he said. He thought
Norman tightened up in the sec
ond half accounting for Norman's
that his team's defense against
poorer competion rate in the final
part of the game.
Clark maintains that his team
has a long way to go to hit its
peak because it is not a senior
cluii. This should make future SC
opponents anything but pleased,
since SC is unbeaten now and it
sounds like Don is hoping for
improvement on that record.
"Those odds favoring us by 20
points were ridiculous," was the
Trojan mentor's comment.
Clark didn't think his team was
overconfident, a charge leveled at
Troy for their squeaky win.
"Stanford is a fine team. Again I
say they could beat anyone if
they played up to their ability all
the time."
