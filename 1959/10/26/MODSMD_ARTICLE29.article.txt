LOS ANGELFS MEMORIAL
COLISEUM "We should have
won it!"
This was the voiced opinion of
the Stanford footballers after
Saturday's 30-28 loss to the USC
Trojans. They came just about
as close as you can get to hand
ing the high flying Trojans their
first loss of the 1959 season.
As the Cards sat around in the
dressing room after the squeaker
loss, comments like, "We had
them right in the palms of our
hands" and "We know they were
ripe," could be heard from all
corners of the hot, sticky dress
ing room.
Fans Impressed
The Indians were naturally dis
appointed, but they showed Ihe
more than 44,000 people present
that they were a real tough ball
club. As one SC fan put it, "how
on earth did Stanford get to be
a 19 point underdog in this game?
1 can't see how they have won
only one game this season."
Other fans just shook their
heads in amazement at the great
passing of Dick Norman, and the
bctter-than-expected defense of
the Indians that held the Trojans
great ground game down, at least
considering the way pre-game
pickers had figured it.
As guard Tom Walsh put it,
"They could get the three and
four yard stuff, but we didn't
get pushed all over the field like
most people thought we would."
'We Scared Them'
The Cards had reason to be
proud of themselves, but they
were mostly unhappy that they
couldn't pull the game out of the
fire. "We threw a real scare into
those guys, they were really
worried for a while," said Mac
Wylie, who showed himself to be
quite a pass receive!" on the after
noon. "They hurt us early in the
game with some trap blocks, but
when we got onto -that we slowed
them down quite a bit."
Stanford was really up for the
game, for they wanted to put a
stop to the Trojan win streak,
and an end 1o its own loss streak.
"They did the best they could
possibly do, and they put out 110
per cent the whole way," was
how Coach Jack Curtice put il
between sips on a coke in the
coaches' room after ihe loss.

Wylie, who showed himself to be
quite a pass receive!" on the after
noon. "They hurt us early in the
game with some trap blocks, but
when we got onto -that we slowed
them down quite a bit."
Stanford was really up for the
game, for they wanted to put a
stop to the Trojan win streak,
and an end 1o its own loss streak.
"They did the best they could
possibly do, and they put out 110
per cent the whole way," was
how Coach Jack Curtice put il
between sips on a coke in the
coaches' room after ihe loss.
LOS ANGELFS MEMORIAL
COLISEUM "We should have
won it!"
This was the voiced opinion of
the Stanford footballers after
Saturday's 30-28 loss to the USC
Trojans. They came just about
as close as you can get to hand
ing the high flying Trojans their
first loss of the 1959 season.
As the Cards sat around in the
dressing room after the squeaker
loss, comments like, "We had
them right in the palms of our
hands" and "We know they were
ripe," could be heard from all
corners of the hot, sticky dress
ing room.
Fans Impressed
The Indians were naturally dis
appointed, but they showed Ihe
more than 44,000 people present
that they were a real tough ball
club. As one SC fan put it, "how
on earth did Stanford get to be
a 19 point underdog in this game?
1 can't see how they have won
only one game this season."
Other fans just shook their
heads in amazement at the great
passing of Dick Norman, and the
bctter-than-expected defense of
the Indians that held the Trojans
great ground game down, at least
considering the way pre-game
pickers had figured it.
As guard Tom Walsh put it,
"They could get the three and
four yard stuff, but we didn't
get pushed all over the field like
most people thought we would."
'We Scared Them'
The Cards had reason to be
proud of themselves, but they
were mostly unhappy that they
couldn't pull the game out of the
fire. "We threw a real scare into
those guys, they were really
worried for a while," said Mac
Wylie, who showed himself to be
quite a pass receive!" on the after
noon. "They hurt us early in the
game with some trap blocks, but
