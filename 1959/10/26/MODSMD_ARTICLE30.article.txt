headed for the sideline and
rambled almost untouched 1o the

return was superb.

first Indian touchdown when he
crashed the Trojan line, blocked
a punt deep in USC territory, and

to pay dirt. Doherty's first score
came eigth minutes later and the

more score in the last quarter as
Van Osdel ran another end sweep,
this one for ton yards.
The USC freshmen showed
good speed around end through
out the entire game but had

Buehler, Starr Rounds, Duncan
Ross, Randy Vahan, Charles
Hart wig and many other mem
bers of the huge freshman in
terior wall held well throughout
the contest.
Knd Sweeps Hurt
However, Ihe end sweeps of

defense constant trouble.
The Indians in contrast to
their opponents found the road
easier going up the middle and
off tackle as Cummings, Doherty.
and Bob Hansler all got good
yardage on power plays.
The next encounter for the un

Saturday when UCLA freshmen
come to Stanford to meet the

ents. Earlier this year the Pa
