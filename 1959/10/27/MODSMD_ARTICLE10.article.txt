Unsolicited research funds to
taling $22,500 have been awarded
to Dr. Winslovv R. Briggs, assist
ant professor and specialist in
plant physiology, by the Research
Corporation of New York, ac
cording to Professor Victor C.
Twitty of the Biological Sciences
Department.
The grant, awarded "with no
strings attached," will be given to
Dr. Briggs in identical amounts
of $7500 for two years, and may
be used for whatever independent
research Dr. Briggs chooses.
Dr. Briggs plans to put the
money into his investigations of
plant growth, especially the in
fluence of light on the distribu
tion and metabolism of plant
growth hormones. In the two
years since Dr. Briggs began his
investigations, he has confirmed
theories that light does alter the
movement of growth hormones
within the plant.
This award is the first of its
kind made to a biologist, Twitty
said. Most of the previous grants
have gone to physical scientists.
