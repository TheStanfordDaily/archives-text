# Moon's Hidden Face Shown In First Soviet Photographs
## Landscape Mainly Drab Plains, Scientists State 
### 
MOSCOW (/P) The hidden side of the moon is largely drab plains
with far fewer landmarks than we see on its face, Soviet scientists
said Monday night.
They presented this analysis of photographs ascribed to picture
taking apparatus aboard Lunik lll—used Oct. 7 as the Soviet rocket

station passed beyond the moon.
Russian names are being given
eight landmarks.
As presented Monday night on
Moscow TV the pictures meant
little to ordinary observers. A
helpful announcer pointed to cer
tain areas and said. "That is a
sea. This is a crater."
But Prof. Alexander Mikhailov
in a broadcast reported these
findings: "The unseen part of the
moon is considerably more mo
notonous than the side turned to
ward the earth. It contains fewer
seas and fewer contrasts."
Montononous Landscape
He said the general monotony
of the landscape is "beyond doubt
associated with the question of
the origin of the configuration of
the moon."
"The dark patches of the so
called seas are clearly visible,"
Mikhailov said. "Some of them
extend to the other side of the
moon."
The Russians say the pictures
were transmitted to earth over
distances up to 290.000 miles—
just when was not announced.
Among the eight features
named is "the Sea of Moscow."
Tass said this sea is a 180-mile
wide depression north of the lu
nar equator.
A bay in the southern part of
this sea has been called "the
Bay of Astronauts."
Tsiolkovsky Crater
The name "Tsiolkovsky" was
given to a crater "more than 60
miles in diameter with a central

elevation clearly discernible in
the southern hemisphere."
Constant in Tsiolkovsky was a
Russian authority on rockets and
space travel in the early 1900s.
He died in 1936.
Two big craters were reported
situated north of the lunar equa
tor "almost on the dividing line
of the visible and invisible parts
of the moon."
A mountain range stretching
south from these craters toward
the equatorial area was named
"Soviet."
Meclita —dream Sea
"A sea called the Mechta—
dream—sprawls out in the south
ern hemisphere on the very edge
of the moon's invisible side,"
Tass said.
A team of Soviet scientists
chose the names.
This one-nation operation is a
departure in science. The so-called
seas, mountains and craters on
the moon's side .facing thp earth
have been named by scientists of
many lands down through the
ages.
An official announcement by
the Soviet news agency said
photographic apparatus aboard
the Lunik was switched on at
6:30 a.m. Moscow time Oct. 7
and took pictures for 40 minutes.
At the time, the 614-pound, in
strument-packed satellite was
from 37.284 to 43,498 miles from
the moon. Tass said.
The Soviet announcement de
scribed the Lunik as taking actual
photographs, a great technologi
cal feat. It is understood the

United Slates in its planned moon
shot will use an electronic scan
ning device to send back signals
from which a picture can bo re
constructed.
Presumably the control system
acted on instruction from a Soviet
ground station. Tass spoke of "ra
dio signals from the earth to the
interplanetary station to control
the latter's work.
