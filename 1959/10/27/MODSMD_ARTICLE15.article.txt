# Soviet Photo Lacks Detail
## 
### HOWARD C. HEYN 
PASADENA (/P) — Scientists
were generous with their interest
but sparing in their comment
last night concerning Rus
sian photographs purporting to
show the hidden side of the moon.
Those interviewed agreed that
the pictures represented a re
markable scientific achievement.
None expressed any doubt that
the pictures were actually trans
mitted from the space station Lu
nik 111, as the Soviet scientists
claim.
But all also agreed that the
lack of detail in prints received
here made it almost impossible
to evaluate the pictures.
Prints Shown
The scientists were shown
prints of an Associated Press
Wirephoto -sent here from Mos
cow after the pictures were re
ceived in Russia from the space
vehicle.
"It's a pretty good pitcure,"
said Dr. Albert R. Hibbs, physi
cist at the California Institute of
Technology, "but in this form it
is principally a curio."
Hibbs is acting chief of the
Space Science Division at Cal
tech Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
He is also a member of the NASA
Lunar Exploration Committee.
He added:
"It is impossible to tell how
much definition has been lost in
transmission. I would like very
much to see the original of this
picture."
Shared by Three
This view was shared by three
other scientists. They are Harri
son Brown, authority on meteor
ites and Caltech professor of geo
chemistry; Dr. Seth Nicholson,
an authority on the sun and a re
tired astronomer at Mt. Wilson
and Palomar observatories, and
Dr. Robert S. Richardson, asso
ciate director of Griffith Park Ob
servatory in Los Angeles.
"'One would also like to see
photos of the visible side of the
moon made with the same equip
ment which is aboard Lunik III,"
said Nicholson. He said the Rus
sian picture is "much better than
many pictures of the earth trans
mitted from American rockets."
Hibbs concurred in this but
said that pictures recovered from
American rocket capsules — rath
er than transmitted through
space—are better than the Rus
sians' moon view from the rear.
