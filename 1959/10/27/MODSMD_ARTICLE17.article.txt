# Cal's Problem
## 
### 
Tmk stud km' who went on a hunger strike against HO 1(1 at tin*
University of California lias now gone on Ins way, but in I»is wake
remains much controversy ahont the incident.
He naturally gained many supporters in liis hid to eliminate
coni|)idsory two-year military training at California. Opponents
asked why Moore ever came to Cal in the first place if he opposed
IiOTC.
i
We with his stand that compulsory military training
should he eliminated, though a hunger strike does not strike us
as the most mature way of voicing an opinion.
To force students to take two years of military courses when
they have not the slightest interest seems to us a waste of student
time and instructors' efforts.
Those who are interested in officer training will avail them
selves of the opportunity anyway. Those not interested prohahl)
aren't going to take more than the two years required, hence the\
aren't doing the armed services any good. Kven the possible few
who decide to stick it through the four years despite lark of
interest are likely to turn out to he poor officers, and p< rhaps do
more harm than good.
As to the point that Moore need not have come to Cal, this is
quite true. But hear in mind that Cal may have better offered
than any other school the type of education he desired.
To say that once there, he should patently accept everything,
is, we believe, a most narrow view.
Should every student who chooses Stanford refrain from ever
asking for a change in something which he may oppose? \\ <•
think not. We doubt that either Cal or Stanford is perfect. To
say that those who might have a criticism should sta\ away onl\
invites stagnation.
The difficulty, we think, does not come when criticism arises,
but rather when criticism disappears and an atmosphere of pas
sive acceptance pervades.
