After the talk with Mr. Khru
shchev at Camp David it was be
lieved in Washington that before
the President's visit to Moscow
in Hie -spring there would have to
be a meeting at the summit.
But before there could be a
meeting at the summit there
had to be an understanding
among the Western allies in
cluding West Germany about
the position to be taken. Berlin
and the German question are,
of course, the sticky point, on
which an understanding is
needed.
For it is plain that if and when
Macmillan, de Gaulle and Eisen
hower meet Khrushchev, they
must have a common policy on
how to stabilize the situation in
West Berlin.
But this is easier said than
done. For there is an important
difference of view between Ger
many and France on the one
hand, Britain and the U.S.A. on
the other.
The basic difference is that
we are prepared to negotiate
about Berlin whereas our con
tinental allies do not wish to ne
gotiate anything which would
alter the status quo.
This difference explains the re
luctance of General de Gaulle to
accept the President's proposal
for a summit meeting of the
Western allies. Such a meeting
would be a failure unless France
nnd Germany yielded'to the Pres
ident and agreed to treat Berlin
as a negotiable question.
The would have to
insist. For if he yielded to Gen
eral de Gaulle and Dr. Adenauer
bv agreeing that the status of
Berlin is fixed, unalterable end
non - negotiable, the diplomatic
venture on which he embarked
last summer would be wrecked.
Given the basic difference
among the Western allies, it
is very doubtful, therefore,
whether the best way to re
solve it is by a face-to-face en
counter among the heads of the
Western governments. For on
the basic difference, there can
be no compromise.
However much it may be dis
persed in the public communique,
either we negotiate with the Rus
sians or we do not negotiate with
h: 4 Russians. We cannot take
the view that we are willing to
negotiate about the future of
West Berlin but that nothing in
the existing situation may be
changed.
As this difference has devel
oped among the Allies, one view
or the other must prevail—either
that of Paris • Bonn or that of
Washington - London — before we
can safely deal with the Russians.
The root of the difference
lies in the question of the rec
ognition of the East German

state. Everyone knows that if
a new statute for West Berlin
is negotiated — which guaran
tees its freedom and the right
of access —the price will be in
one way or another a de facto
recognition of the East German
state.
Bonn and Paris are not willing
to pay this price. In the last
analysis the British and we are
prepared to pay it. That is what
divides us, and it is this differ
ence which will have to be re
solved before we can begin to
deal seriously with the Soviet
government.
In all probability the difference
among the Allies cannot be re
solved quickly. Dr. Adenauer is
preparing for a crucial election
in 1961, and he cannot voluntarily
agree to anything which recog
nizes the legal existence of the
East German state and the fact
that there are two Germanys.
General de Gaulle, who in
fact wants two Germanys and
does not want a reunited Ger
many, is supporting Dr. Ade
nauer's campaign for re-elec
tion in 1061. There is no other
German in sight who is so use
ful to the French national in
terest.
At least until that election is
over, until Dr. Adenauer has a
new political mandate, Bonn and
Paris have a strong interest in
not engaging in a serious nego
tiation about Berlin with the Rus
sians.
In this country there exists the
same difference of opinion about
negotiating. It is led by mem
bers of the Truman administra
'ion. by Mr. Truman himself, Mr.
Acheson and Mr. Paul Nitze.
Their thesis is that the status
of West Berlin is not a nego
tiable question, that the right
policy for this country is to re
fuse to discuss the status of
West Berlin, and to defy the
Soviets to do anything about
West Berlin.
They think, it would appear,
that the Soviet government will
be over-awed by our firmness.
And if il is not over-awed, they
are prepared to fight some kind
of "limited" war.
These retired Truman officials,
'ike old soldiers, are in my view
trying to relive the battles in
which they won their fame and
their glory.
But while they are right in
insisting that the cold war will
go on. their preoccupation with
their own prist history is pre
venting them from grasping
and dealing with the new phase
of the cold war. A rigid anil
unchanging diplomacy, which
is what they advise, will not
work in the present phase of
the cold war.
