# Cal Scientists Awarded Nobel Physics Prize
## 
### 
The 1939 Nobel prize for phys-1
ics was awarded yesterday to
two University of California sci
entists, Emilio Segre and Dr.
Owen Chamberlain.
They discovered antiprotons,
proving that matter exists in two
forms, as particles and antiparti
cles. The antiproton is the electri
cally negative mirror image of
the proton or hydrogen nucleus.
Segre and Chamberlain found
that clashing their antiproton and
a proton together in the atom
smashing bevatron at Berkeley
caused both particles to dissolve
into light.
The Swedish Academy of Sci
ences, which awards the Nobel
prize, calls the discovery one of
cosmic implications. It is an im
portant step toward introducing
order into the micro-world of 30
odd sub-atomic particles known
today. The discovery was first
published in 1935.
Segre, 54. is a native of Italy
and student of Enrico Fermi, the
pioneer nuclear physicist. Dr.
Chamberlain, 39, received his doc
torate in physics from the Uni
versity of Chicago. Both have
worked at the atomic bomb re
search center at Los Alamos,
New Mexico.
