Not Foisted
Editor, The Daily:
It is amazing to me that Fred
erick Moore should travel all the
way across the country from Vir
ginia to enter a college, one of
whose basic tenents —the institu
tion of compulsory ROTC—■was
inimical to the "dictates of his
conscience."
Certainly ROTC was not foisted
upon him: the University of Cali
fornia makes no secret of the
compulsory nature of its ROTC
program in its brochures. By en
tering the University of Californ
ia, Moore became a party to a
contract with the institution, to
accept it as it existed.
Moore simply did not conduct
himself in a mature manner, the
most immature act being his
choice of a school whose goals
were not consonant with his own.
Regarding Moore's actions, it
would be equally ludicrous for
the members of a religious sect
while attending U.C. to try to
convert the school to their per
sonal ethic.
I think most of us are pacifist
to the extent the intellectuals who
formed the Oxford Pledge were
repulsed by the horrors and moral
significance of war. Most of us,
however, stand approximately
where Franklin I). Rooseveli
stood when he said: "I am a
pacifist, BUT. . ."
Today, however, a new pacifism
is overtaking the college campus,
based not on intellectual disgust
for war, but on emotional fear of
the nuclear consequences of war,
a fact which changes the com
plexion of the matter, for it is
removing the qualification from
Roosevelt's words, and is permit
ting the subjugation of the
sacred elements and contracts of
our civilization.
Tu quoque, Mr. Moore?

John Jones
Editor, The Daily:
Let us consider the pitiable case
of poor John Jones. He was once
a student at the University of Cal
ifornia, but has since been ex
pelled by the unconscionable re
ligious bigots who run the place.
You see, John, once a very
skeptical fellow, got religion dur
ing his sophomore year and the
religion to which he was con
verted abhorred, indeed forbade,
all forms of competition, holding
all such to be utterly immoral.
Well, in line with his Constitu
tional rights; John petitioned the
university to be excused from all
examinations. And of course in
our democracy, where civil lib
erties are the keystone, what

choice could the university have
had bul lo grant his rightful re
quest ?
Somehow, incomprehensibly,
the university couldn't see it that
way. In fact the exact words with'"
which thoy heaped scorn upon

his faith were, "Oh, come now
John."
John, I'm happy to report, has
| the courage of his convictions
and has now found happiness
j selling brushes door-to-door.
