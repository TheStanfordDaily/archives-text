... Is that every time it ar
rives I'm a week older.
This may seem quite inconse
quential to most people, but after
spending some time at Lagunita
ur some other "integrated" dorm,
one begins to look for signs of
age.
This need to start checking
price tags on wheel chairs seems
to be one of the results of the
thorough mixing of classes in
women's dorms.
For instance, one evening at
dinner some sophomores were
exclaiming over a friend's up
coining birthday. The poor girl
was about to turn li)! Why
(bat's almost 20! And anything
20 or above is apparently quite
ancient. 1 sat and listened to
them, wondering it all tin* gray
hairs I've gotten in my long 21
years were showing too much.
The paradox is that those who
are most horrified at leaving
their teens are probably the same
ones who will be first at the door
of a 21-year-old asking if she is
using her II) that night. (Mixing
of classes gives ihe youngster
more chances to find an ID thai
isn't in use.)
On trial at Lag is smoking at
dinner, which is another result
of "integration." When there were
chiefly sophomores there, ap
parently there was little interest
in smoking at meals, but the
older folks were influential in
getting at least a trial period.
Voting on its continuation was
scheduled last night.
It's too soon for real evalua
tions of "integration." One of
the goals, at least according to
propaganda, was to give sohpo
mores the opportunity to talk
with the older women, and get
pointers on classwork, profes
sors and other academic coun
sel. How much of this is going
on is hard to say and how
beneficial any of it is, is even
harder.
Sophomores who have not se
lected a major can find a wide
variety of fields represented in
their living groups, and usually
the juniors and seniors are will
ing to discuss their majors.
Perhaps what can be considered
a by-product of "integration" is
the social aspect. Unattached sen

iors, instead of being only with
their own class, many of whom
are pinned or engaged, have op
portunities for exchanges for
which lower classmen are gen
erally more enthusiastic, being
generally unattached.

Just a coincidence? On a poll
taken in Lag to ascertain the
readership and value of the
Scratch Sheet one casa reported
2!) women had read an issue of
the Scratch Sheet and three had
decided to take a course on the
basis of an SS evaluation. The
number who did not think the
Scratch was of value was also
three.

It's too soon for real evalua

the goals, at least according to
propaganda, was to give sohpo

Sophomores who have not se

Just a coincidence? On a poll
taken in Lag to ascertain the
readership and value of the
Scratch Sheet one casa reported
2!) women had read an issue of
the Scratch Sheet and three had
decided to take a course on the
basis of an SS evaluation. The
number who did not think the
Scratch was of value was also
three.
... Is that every time it ar
rives I'm a week older.
This may seem quite inconse
quential to most people, but after
spending some time at Lagunita
ur some other "integrated" dorm,
one begins to look for signs of
age.
This need to start checking
price tags on wheel chairs seems
to be one of the results of the
thorough mixing of classes in
women's dorms.
For instance, one evening at
dinner some sophomores were
exclaiming over a friend's up
coining birthday. The poor girl
was about to turn li)! Why
(bat's almost 20! And anything
20 or above is apparently quite
ancient. 1 sat and listened to
them, wondering it all tin* gray
hairs I've gotten in my long 21
years were showing too much.
The paradox is that those who
are most horrified at leaving
their teens are probably the same
ones who will be first at the door
of a 21-year-old asking if she is
using her II) that night. (Mixing
of classes gives ihe youngster
more chances to find an ID thai

On trial at Lag is smoking at
dinner, which is another result
of "integration." When there were
chiefly sophomores there, ap
