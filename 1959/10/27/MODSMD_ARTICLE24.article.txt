# Gaieties Sees 67th Year

### Camille de Campos 
"You could take a thousand
Stanford women and train them
for a thousand years and you
still couldn't get a decent 20-girl
line out of them," complained a
disgruntled reviewer of the 1933
Gaieties.
Big Game entertainment has
been a tradition since the first
Cal-Stanford game in 1892, but
its form has not always been the
lavish shows of recent years. Its
reception, too, has been varied,
but the gala presentation has
withstood the assaults of review
ers, many of which like the above
wisely remained anonymous, and
the harassments of rowdy groups
designated "Roughs."
The earliest shows were plays
with variety numbers between
the acts. These were presented
by various campus d r a m a t i <•
groups and took place the night
of the game.
By 1921 it was the Chappie
Show, titled Ihe "Cheeri-O Re
vue." The Old Chappie co-ordi
nated activities which featured
sketches, the Chappie beauty cho
rus and a cast of 62 performers.
The "Football Frothies" high
lighted tiro next year's festivities.
They satirized campus personali
ties and whirled through a lavish

and exotic dance number- to the
music of the eight-piece Ram's
Head orchestra. The talents of
the "Bouncing Bubbles," the flap
per chorus girls, crowned the
glory of that season's annual one
night stand.
The gloom of Black Saturday
prevailed in 1924 no Big Game
show. However, there was a per
formance the next year, and then
Ram's Head took over and pre
sented "Football Gaieties of
1926." An exasperated reviewer
suggested that it would be hotter
to "confine the chorus to a few
simple maneuvers. Balancing on
one foot and singing at the same
time present too many difficul
ties . .
"Good clean fun" described the
third annual "Big Game Gaieties"
in 1927. The same brand of suds
must have been used for the
1935 edition, but Dean's office—
Ram's Head relations seem to
have soured in tho time span be
tween. "The show is as clean as
a Boston edition of 'Ulysses'," a
spokesman reported, "and was
kept so by the same process."
That year's show "suffered
from lack of adequate rehearsal,"
but was memorable in other re
spects. It was the last Gaieties
given in the old Assembly Hall—

the cornerstone for the new Me
morial Auditorium had already
been placed. One Winstead Wea
ver, better known in Stanford an
nals as "Doodles" Weaver, stood
alone on the darkened stage and
delivered a eulogy in the form of
Puck's speech, which reduced the
audience to tears.
"How the Hell Are You?" in
flashing lights greeted Gaieties
audiences two years ago, and the
phrase immediately became the
campus by-word.
The show has grown beyond
the confines of Memorial Audito
rium. Gaieties first went on the
road in 19.34, when the show
made a USO tour. The troups re
lumed to Stanford with a pocket
ful of government awards and
added recognition. Rapidly be
coming a part of the regular run
are the Los Angeles perform
ances, given at the end of au
tumn quarter.
Despite technical mishaps,
splitting costumes and frequent
threats of bankruptcy, the Big
Game tradition has endured. A
1939 Gaieties number salutes the
"Game of the Year." History
seems to confirm that the annual
extravaganza is the "show of the
year."
