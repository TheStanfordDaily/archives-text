The "Madison Avenue" district
of Stanford Public Relations
Commission has already begun
its yearly business of campus ad
vertising. Co-chairman Nina El
kin d an d Terry Hitter head
the 27-me m be r commission,
which is divided into three func
tional subcommittees: art, silk
screening and the newsletter.
The principal function of Pub
Rel is to provide publicity for any
campus group affiliated with the
ASSU. They design, make and
distribute posters, banners and
stencils. The only cost to the cus
tomer organization is for the ma
terials.
A schedule of these prices is
posted in the Pub Rel Office, in
the northeast corner of tihe Un
ion. The office is open frcpi 1 to
5 p.m. Monday through Thurs
day and 1 to 3 p.m. Friday.
Pub Rel requires two weeks
for posters which must be de
signer], cut and run. Posters
which have already been de
signed need a week and a half to
be cut and run. Orders for ban
ners should be made at least a
week in advance. There is no
deadline for stencils.
Another purpose of Pub Rel is
to regulate advertising on cam
pus. The approval of a member
of the board must be secured on
any -signs put up.
Outdoors, posters may be dis
played on the four corners of
Quad, in front of the library, on
the trees in front of Union and in
front of the Post Office. They
may also lie put outside living
areas with the approval of the
resident administrator and Pub
Rel. Bulletin boards are provided
indoors.
Pub Rel also serves as a liaison
between the ASSU and local busi
ness groups such as the Chamber
of Commerce.
New at Pub Rel this year is a
more efficient system of order
ing supplies. Last year materials
were ordered on a piecemeal basis

as they were needed. This year
ttie supplies have been obtained
in much larger quantities, at sub
stantial savings.
Also new is the approach to the
work. In past years, a few indi
viduals tended to end up with all
the work. This year, in closer ac
cordance with the provisions of
the ASSU constitution, the jobs
are spread out among the entire
staff.

The "Madison Avenue" district
of Stanford Public Relations
Commission has already begun
its yearly business of campus ad
vertising. Co-chairman Nina El
kin d an d Terry Hitter head
the 27-me m be r commission,
which is divided into three func
tional subcommittees: art, silk
screening and the newsletter.
The principal function of Pub
Rel is to provide publicity for any
campus group affiliated with the
ASSU. They design, make and
distribute posters, banners and
stencils. The only cost to the cus
tomer organization is for the ma
terials.
A schedule of these prices is
posted in the Pub Rel Office, in
the northeast corner of tihe Un
ion. The office is open frcpi 1 to
5 p.m. Monday through Thurs
day and 1 to 3 p.m. Friday.
Pub Rel requires two weeks
for posters which must be de
signer], cut and run. Posters
which have already been de
signed need a week and a half to
be cut and run. Orders for ban
ners should be made at least a
week in advance. There is no
deadline for stencils.
Another purpose of Pub Rel is
to regulate advertising on cam
pus. The approval of a member
of the board must be secured on
any -signs put up.
Outdoors, posters may be dis
played on the four corners of
Quad, in front of the library, on
the trees in front of Union and in
front of the Post Office. They
may also lie put outside living
areas with the approval of the
resident administrator and Pub
Rel. Bulletin boards are provided
indoors.
Pub Rel also serves as a liaison
between the ASSU and local busi
ness groups such as the Chamber
of Commerce.
New at Pub Rel this year is a
more efficient system of order
ing supplies. Last year materials
were ordered on a piecemeal basis

as they were needed. This year
ttie supplies have been obtained
in much larger quantities, at sub
stantial savings.
Also new is the approach to the
work. In past years, a few indi
viduals tended to end up with all
the work. This year, in closer ac
cordance with the provisions of
the ASSU constitution, the jobs
are spread out among the entire
staff.
