can League's expansion program
calls for an inter-league deal that
would put New York back in the
National League in exchange for
one of its present franchises. The
Associated Press learned this
Monday from an authoritative
source.
Under this revolutionary plan,
the American League would ex
pand to 10 teams, possibly next!
year. Two new franchises, Min
neapolis and New York, would be
added. The new franchise in New
York, already American League
territory, then would be offered
to the National League in ex
change for either Pittsburgh or
Philadelphia.
The big problem, of course,
would be to get the status quo
minded National League to ac
cept this proposition. That does
n't seem likely.
