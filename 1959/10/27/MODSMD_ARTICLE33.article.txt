## USC Unbeatable? Elliott Hopes Not 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (/!') "South
ern California is a great football
team but I don't know that it's
unbeatable," declared California
Coach Pete Elliott Monday as his
Bears opened preparation for the
Trojans' invasion of Berkeley
Sat urday.
"They arc the same people we
beat last year and this is a game
we'd sure like to win," added El
liott, whose club has lost five!
straight while Southern Califor
nia rolls along unbeaten and un
tied.
fireat Ground Attack
Describing Southern California ;
to the Northern California Eoot
j ball Writers and Broadcast ers As
sociation, Elliott said: "They
have a great ground attack and
defense. The teams that hurt
them the most have been passing
teams. So you can -see that's
right up our alley."
The latter was a joke, folks.
California threw just three passes
last Saturday against Oregon
State, completing none and hav
ing one intercepted and run back
I 71) yards for a touchdown as Ore
gon State beat the Bears 21-20.
Lauds Team
Coach Jack Curtice of Stanford
lauded his team for its battle
against the Trojans last Satur
day. Underdogs by three touch
downs, the Indians went down 30-
2S after leading 21-12 at the half.
Her e v e a 1 e d that quarterback
Dick Norman, who gained 232
yards passing and running, had

to play nearly all the game be-1
cause reserve Rod Sears had the j
flu.
"Tackle Phil B u r k I a n d was
catching Trojans going the other
way and coming his way," Cur
lice declared. "He played a great
game as did end Ben Robinion
whose blocking kept our runners
going."
Stanford this week hosts the
San Jose State Spartans, who
handed Arizona State University
its only loss of the campaign.
Spartan Coach Bob Titchenal said
it was the best game his team
has played.
"It was a team job stopping
them," he said. "Our halfback j
Oneal Cuterry looks bettor each
week.
"If our team plays like it did j
in the first half last Saturday, we
might stay on the field against |
Stanford."
Frequently Offsides
Asked about frequent offside
penalties against the Spartans
last week, Titchenal explained,
"We were starting most of our
plays on a call of 'go.' On many j
plays their defense would holler
'go' and we'd start and get a j
penalty."
What's wrong with that? #
"Nothing," replied Titchenal.
"except it's against the rules."
This weekend will be one of the !
rare times during the football
season when Bay Area fans will
have to choose between a Stan
ford and a California game. Both
schools will be playing at home. |
