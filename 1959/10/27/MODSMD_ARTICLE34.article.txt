# engineers and what they do at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft...

### 
The field has never been broader
The challenge has never been greater
Engineers' at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft today arc concerned
with the development of all forms of llight propulsion
systems—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and other advanced
types for propulsion in space. Many of these systems are so
entirely new in concept that their design and development,
and allied research programs, require technical personnel
not previously associated with the development of aircralt
engines. Where the company was once primarily interested
in graduates with degrees in mechanical and aeronautical
engineering, it now also requires men with in
electrical, chemical, and nuclear engineering, and in physics,
chemistry, and metallurgy.
Included in a wide range of engineering activities open to
technically trained graduates at all levels are these lour
basic fields:
ANALYTICAL ENGINEERING Men engaged in this
activity are concerned with lundamental investigations in
the fields of science or engineering related to the conception
of new products. 1 he v carry out detailed analyses of ad
vanccd flight and space systems and interpret results in
terms of practical design applications. 1 hey provide basic
information which is essential in determining the types of
systems that have development potential.
DESIGN ENGINI I .RING The prime requisite here is an
active interest in the application of aerodynamics, thermo
dynamics, stress analysis, and principles of machine design
to the creation of new flight propulsion systems, Men en
gaged in this activity at IWWA. establish the specific pct
formancc and structural requirements of the new product
and design it as a complete working mechanism.
EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING Here men supervise
and coordinate fabrication, assembly and laboratory testing
of experimental apparatus, system components, and devel
opment engines. I hey devise test rigs and laboiatoty setups,
specify instrumentation and direct execution of the actual
test programs. Responsibility in this phase of the develop
ment program also includes analysis of test data, reporting
of results and recommendations for future cflort.
MATERIALS ENGINEERING Men activc in this field
at P&WA investigate metals, alloys and other materials
under various environmental conditions to determine their
usefulness as applied to advanced flight propulsion systems.
They devise material testing methods and design special
test equipment. They arc also responsible for the determina
tion of new fabrication techniques and causes of failures or
manufacturing difficulties.
