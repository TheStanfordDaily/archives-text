# Burkland, Pike Lead Tough Indian Tackles
## 
### 
At the start of the football season this fall, the big problem in
the Stanford line appeared to be the tackle spots. Dean Hinshaw,
the 6-6, 210 pounder from Willows, was the only certainty at tackle
and when he was injured in the opening game things looked very
low.
Since that lime Stanford Coach Jack Curtice has found several

players that have proven that
they can do an adequate job in
helping to maintain the Indian
forward wall.
Phil Burkland, Iho most ex
perienced of this year's tackles,
has done much to help bolster
Stanford's line.
"The Janitor" as Burkland is
known by his team mates and
fraternity brothers lias provided
Stanford's backfield with most of
what little downfield blocking
they have had this year. Ex
tremely quick for a lineman,
Burkland is a good receiver and
has been used several times this
year in the tackle eligible pass
play.
Pike Steps In
Stepping in to replace the in
jured Hinshaw has been senior
Gary Pike. Pike at 222 pounds is
currently the biggest of Stan
ford's middle linemen. Two years
ago when Pike transfered to Stan
ford from Santa Monica City
College, he was a guard, but he
was shifted to tackle last spring.
Pike is a Psychology major and
makes his home in Culver City.
Backing up Pike and Burkland
are Cap Ingham, Jack Gordon,
and Trev Grimm.
Ingham, a senior from Olympia,
Wash., is small for a tackle at
200 pounds, but has proven him
self a tough defensive player.
Like Pike. Ingham started his
college football career as a guard
but was shifted to tackle. One of
six pre-medical students on this
year's Stanford team, Ingham is
one of the better students on the
squad.
Politician
When he's not playing football
or studying, Ingham takes care
of matters pertaining to the inter
fraternity council since he is
president of that organization.
Jack Gordon is probably the
biggest surprise on this year's
team. Last year Gordon was a
center on the freshman football

squad and appeared to he doomed
to play behind Chris Cotile and
Doug PurselJ for the rest of his
college football career. Last
spring, however, Gordon took a
shot at tackle and by the second
game of this year he was seeing
regular action.
Gordon, a physics major, is
especially adept at tackling. In
the COP game Gordon distin
guished himself by making 11
stops in only a short period of
play.
Grimm, another Stanfordite
who was shifted to tackle this
year from another sport, adds a
lot of punch to the lineup in more
ways than one. Grimm was unde
feated as the heavy weight on
last year's boxing team.
He started at Stanford three
years ago as an end. After three
years at end, Grimm was shifted
a notch to tackle. Grimm, another
of the team's better students, is
taking pre-law studies.

and when he was injured in the opening game things looked very
low.
Since that lime Stanford Coach Jack Curtice has found several

players that have proven that
they can do an adequate job in
helping to maintain the Indian
forward wall.
Phil Burkland, Iho most ex
perienced of this year's tackles,
has done much to help bolster
Stanford's line.
"The Janitor" as Burkland is
known by his team mates and
fraternity brothers lias provided
Stanford's backfield with most of
what little downfield blocking
they have had this year. Ex
tremely quick for a lineman,
Burkland is a good receiver and
has been used several times this
year in the tackle eligible pass
play.
Pike Steps In
Stepping in to replace the in
jured Hinshaw has been senior
Gary Pike. Pike at 222 pounds is
currently the biggest of Stan
ford's middle linemen. Two years
ago when Pike transfered to Stan
ford from Santa Monica City
College, he was a guard, but he
was shifted to tackle last spring.
Pike is a Psychology major and
makes his home in Culver City.
Backing up Pike and Burkland
are Cap Ingham, Jack Gordon,
and Trev Grimm.
Ingham, a senior from Olympia,
Wash., is small for a tackle at
200 pounds, but has proven him
self a tough defensive player.
Like Pike. Ingham started his
college football career as a guard
but was shifted to tackle. One of
six pre-medical students on this
year's Stanford team, Ingham is
one of the better students on the
squad.
Politician
When he's not playing football
or studying, Ingham takes care
of matters pertaining to the inter
fraternity council since he is
president of that organization.
Jack Gordon is probably the
biggest surprise on this year's
team. Last year Gordon was a
center on the freshman football

squad and appeared to he doomed
to play behind Chris Cotile and
Doug PurselJ for the rest of his
college football career. Last
spring, however, Gordon took a
shot at tackle and by the second
game of this year he was seeing
regular action.
Gordon, a physics major, is
especially adept at tackling. In
the COP game Gordon distin
guished himself by making 11
stops in only a short period of
play.
Grimm, another Stanfordite
who was shifted to tackle this
year from another sport, adds a
lot of punch to the lineup in more
ways than one. Grimm was unde
feated as the heavy weight on
last year's boxing team.
He started at Stanford three
years ago as an end. After three
years at end, Grimm was shifted
a notch to tackle. Grimm, another
of the team's better students, is
taking pre-law studies.

At the start of the football season this fall, the big problem in
