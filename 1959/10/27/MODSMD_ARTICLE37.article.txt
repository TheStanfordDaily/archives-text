# Harriers Hurt By Rash of Poor Health
## 
### 
A streak of bad health hit the
Stanford cross-country team last
Saturday and as a result the In
dians couldn't field a complete
team for their race against USC,
UCLA and the Air Force Acad
emy at Los Angeles.
The competition was won by
USC with a score of 24. Air
Force had 31, and UCLA recorded
34.
Stanford's two top runners,
Keith Wallace and Bob Monzingo,
both had minor ailments and
were not able to run. With these
two men out Stanford only had
four runners to compete in the
quadrangular. Five entries are
necessary for a squad to be eli
gible in the team competition.
The four Stanford harriers that
did compete, however, turned in
a fine performance. John North
way paced the Cards, finishing
fifth, Bertil Lundh ran seventh,
Ernie Cunliffe was 13th and
Keith Maxwell was 20th.
The Indians will have a chance
to gain revenge on at least UCLA
this weekend when the Bruins
j plus Cal meet the Card harriers
jat Stanford, Saturday morning
! at 10.
Stanford Coach Payton Jordan
' feels that this year's cross-coun
try team might be the Indians'
finest if everyone were healthy
all of the time. Monzingo and
Wallace will most probably be
back for Saturday's race, and
both of them plus Northway,
Cunliffe and Lundh will be defi
nites in Saturday's action.
