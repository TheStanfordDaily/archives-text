It's Moral Virlory Time
Another Saturday, another Moral Victory for Stanford <*ridders.
This may be painfully repetitous for Card fans but 1 can assure you
that for three quarters down in the Coliseum, in sunny and smoggy
1..A., Iho students in the small but-brave Tribe rooting section were
all pinching themselves with amazement as I heir team was ahead and
playing their hearts out against the Herd from Troy down on the
field.
Yes, no doubt the 2S-30 loss to S.C. will be talked about for many
weeks. Certainly the team was up for the game and was terrifically

disappointed over its outcome.
But the Trojans just have too
many horses for any Coast team
to handle this year. The bad
thing about this is that they grad
uate only four lettermen from the
first three teams which makes
them even tougher up here next
year.
However nothing should be
taken away from the fine per
formances of the Stanford team.
Dick Norman looked al his bes'
against "SC Zoo" completing 16
passes for 207 yards and adding
25 yards on runs mostly on roll
outs so if he decides to keep
on running a little that roll-out
pass will be twice as effective.
Linemen Chris Burford, Ben
Robinson and I'hil Burklaml did
a tremendous job against the Tro
jans. Burford grabbed five passes
two for TDs; Robinson made a
great catch for 47 yards and sev
eral key tackles; and Burklaml
intercepted his first pass of the
season and made many tackles.

Linebackers Doug Pureed, John Thomas and Mac VVylie all did
their best in holding the Trojans from making any long runs.
Skip Face and Dick Bowers also played well on offense and defense
and so it went, with each Card player trying his best to upset S.C.
Of course against nearly any other Coast team a similar effort
would result with a Stanford win and the big problem for Coach
Jack Curtice will be to gel is boys up for this Saturday's game with
a surprisingly tough San Jose State ball club.
A very deserved tip of the hat to Head Cheer Leader Bill Kartozian
and his crew of Sin Aldrip, Terry Inch, Tom Sherman and Kit Cole
for a top-notch job done down at the Coliseum last weekend against
a lot of competition. "Toy." started off in another of his amazingly
clever stunts portraying Antonio Ordonez or possibly Luis Dom
inium with his corrida of cheerleaders. Suddenly as el loro entered
the field fifty or so yellow-shirted stout-hearted SC rooters charged
across the field and jumped the "hull fighters" all five of them
and stole the bull skin, afterwards retiring to the 1 safety of their
cheering section.
Peace returned and our yell leaders returned to the business at
hand that of cheering the Indians to a fine 21-12 lead at half time.
However hostilities erupted again as during half time some heroic
Stanford fan grabbed a Trojan band helmet and the chase began
again. This time about sixty yellow-shirted "Squires" a sort of
honorary somewhat similar to Rally Com came charging across
and at close odds of about seven to one jumped our cheerleaders and
several Tribe supporters who could get down there soon enough.
L.A. (loiinlv Protection
Los Angeles County deputy sheriffs always on and to protect the
visiting students waited till the fighting had receded then jumped
in to restrain the Trojan rooters. Certainly Kartozian and his men
should be congratulated for restraining from seriously injuring the
attacking Trojan rooters for certainly SC Coach Don Clark will want
to suit those brave men up for his next home contest. At least Bill
will not have to practice up on any judo this weekend as the Cards
return to the friendly confines of The Farm against San Jose State.
There is one football expert on the campus who is feeling pretty
smug right about now. It seems he bet against Stanford every game
wilh this writer and now appears ahead. However, if the Indians can
keep on an even keel and come up again like they did against SC
1 certainly feel that we can finish out with a fine win streak and I
can have a little peace about Stanford football and football in general.

wilh this writer and now appears ahead. However, if the Indians can
keep on an even keel and come up again like they did against SC
1 certainly feel that we can finish out with a fine win streak and I
can have a little peace about Stanford football and football in general.

It's Moral Virlory Time
Another Saturday, another Moral Victory for Stanford <*ridders.
This may be painfully repetitous for Card fans but 1 can assure you
that for three quarters down in the Coliseum, in sunny and smoggy
1..A., Iho students in the small but-brave Tribe rooting section were
all pinching themselves with amazement as I heir team was ahead and
playing their hearts out against the Herd from Troy down on the
field.
Yes, no doubt the 2S-30 loss to S.C. will be talked about for many
weeks. Certainly the team was up for the game and was terrifically

disappointed over its outcome.
But the Trojans just have too
many horses for any Coast team
to handle this year. The bad
thing about this is that they grad
uate only four lettermen from the
first three teams which makes
them even tougher up here next
year.
However nothing should be
taken away from the fine per
formances of the Stanford team.
Dick Norman looked al his bes'
against "SC Zoo" completing 16
passes for 207 yards and adding
25 yards on runs mostly on roll
outs so if he decides to keep
on running a little that roll-out
pass will be twice as effective.
Linemen Chris Burford, Ben
Robinson and I'hil Burklaml did
a tremendous job against the Tro
jans. Burford grabbed five passes
two for TDs; Robinson made a
great catch for 47 yards and sev
eral key tackles; and Burklaml
intercepted his first pass of the
season and made many tackles.

Linebackers Doug Pureed, John Thomas and Mac VVylie all did
their best in holding the Trojans from making any long runs.
Skip Face and Dick Bowers also played well on offense and defense
and so it went, with each Card player trying his best to upset S.C.
Of course against nearly any other Coast team a similar effort
would result with a Stanford win and the big problem for Coach
Jack Curtice will be to gel is boys up for this Saturday's game with
a surprisingly tough San Jose State ball club.
A very deserved tip of the hat to Head Cheer Leader Bill Kartozian
and his crew of Sin Aldrip, Terry Inch, Tom Sherman and Kit Cole
for a top-notch job done down at the Coliseum last weekend against
a lot of competition. "Toy." started off in another of his amazingly
clever stunts portraying Antonio Ordonez or possibly Luis Dom
inium with his corrida of cheerleaders. Suddenly as el loro entered
the field fifty or so yellow-shirted stout-hearted SC rooters charged
across the field and jumped the "hull fighters" all five of them
and stole the bull skin, afterwards retiring to the 1 safety of their
cheering section.
Peace returned and our yell leaders returned to the business at
hand that of cheering the Indians to a fine 21-12 lead at half time.
However hostilities erupted again as during half time some heroic
Stanford fan grabbed a Trojan band helmet and the chase began
again. This time about sixty yellow-shirted "Squires" a sort of
honorary somewhat similar to Rally Com came charging across
and at close odds of about seven to one jumped our cheerleaders and
several Tribe supporters who could get down there soon enough.
L.A. (loiinlv Protection
Los Angeles County deputy sheriffs always on and to protect the
visiting students waited till the fighting had receded then jumped
in to restrain the Trojan rooters. Certainly Kartozian and his men
should be congratulated for restraining from seriously injuring the
attacking Trojan rooters for certainly SC Coach Don Clark will want
to suit those brave men up for his next home contest. At least Bill
will not have to practice up on any judo this weekend as the Cards
return to the friendly confines of The Farm against San Jose State.

attacking Trojan rooters for certainly SC Coach Don Clark will want
to suit those brave men up for his next home contest. At least Bill
will not have to practice up on any judo this weekend as the Cards
return to the friendly confines of The Farm against San Jose State.
There is one football expert on the campus who is feeling pretty
smug right about now. It seems he bet against Stanford every game
wilh this writer and now appears ahead. However, if the Indians can
keep on an even keel and come up again like they did against SC
1 certainly feel that we can finish out with a fine win streak and I
can have a little peace about Stanford football and football in general.

It's Moral Virlory Time
Another Saturday, another Moral Victory for Stanford <*ridders.
This may be painfully repetitous for Card fans but 1 can assure you
that for three quarters down in the Coliseum, in sunny and smoggy
1..A., Iho students in the small but-brave Tribe rooting section were
all pinching themselves with amazement as I heir team was ahead and
playing their hearts out against the Herd from Troy down on the
field.
Yes, no doubt the 2S-30 loss to S.C. will be talked about for many
weeks. Certainly the team was up for the game and was terrifically

disappointed over its outcome.
But the Trojans just have too
many horses for any Coast team
to handle this year. The bad
thing about this is that they grad
uate only four lettermen from the
first three teams which makes
them even tougher up here next
year.
However nothing should be
taken away from the fine per
formances of the Stanford team.
Dick Norman looked al his bes'
against "SC Zoo" completing 16
passes for 207 yards and adding
25 yards on runs mostly on roll
outs so if he decides to keep
on running a little that roll-out
pass will be twice as effective.
Linemen Chris Burford, Ben
Robinson and I'hil Burklaml did
a tremendous job against the Tro
jans. Burford grabbed five passes
two for TDs; Robinson made a
great catch for 47 yards and sev
eral key tackles; and Burklaml
intercepted his first pass of the
season and made many tackles.

Linebackers Doug Pureed, John Thomas and Mac VVylie all did
their best in holding the Trojans from making any long runs.
Skip Face and Dick Bowers also played well on offense and defense
and so it went, with each Card player trying his best to upset S.C.
Of course against nearly any other Coast team a similar effort
would result with a Stanford win and the big problem for Coach
Jack Curtice will be to gel is boys up for this Saturday's game with
a surprisingly tough San Jose State ball club.
A very deserved tip of the hat to Head Cheer Leader Bill Kartozian
and his crew of Sin Aldrip, Terry Inch, Tom Sherman and Kit Cole
for a top-notch job done down at the Coliseum last weekend against
a lot of competition. "Toy." started off in another of his amazingly
clever stunts portraying Antonio Ordonez or possibly Luis Dom
inium with his corrida of cheerleaders. Suddenly as el loro entered
the field fifty or so yellow-shirted stout-hearted SC rooters charged
across the field and jumped the "hull fighters" all five of them
and stole the bull skin, afterwards retiring to the 1 safety of their
cheering section.
Peace returned and our yell leaders returned to the business at
hand that of cheering the Indians to a fine 21-12 lead at half time.
However hostilities erupted again as during half time some heroic
Stanford fan grabbed a Trojan band helmet and the chase began
again. This time about sixty yellow-shirted "Squires" a sort of
honorary somewhat similar to Rally Com came charging across
and at close odds of about seven to one jumped our cheerleaders and
several Tribe supporters who could get down there soon enough.
L.A. (loiinlv Protection
Los Angeles County deputy sheriffs always on and to protect the
visiting students waited till the fighting had receded then jumped
in to restrain the Trojan rooters. Certainly Kartozian and his men
should be congratulated for restraining from seriously injuring the
attacking Trojan rooters for certainly SC Coach Don Clark will want
to suit those brave men up for his next home contest. At least Bill
will not have to practice up on any judo this weekend as the Cards
