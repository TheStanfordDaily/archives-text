# IN SOCCER ACTION
## Weakened Cards Crush SF State 
### Glen Alford 
Stanford massacred a game bunch of San Francisco Gators, 7-1,
Saturday in a soccer game in San Francisco. This was definitely the
team's best showing of the 1959 season.
The large margin of victory is remarkable in view of the fact that
the team roster is beginning to look like an admittance list to a

hospital. All-American goalie Rill
Dittman seems to lie definitely
out for the season after fighting
mononucleosis for most of the
s u m m e r . His spectacular re
placement, Hunt Baseom, came
down with the flu and al •■<>
missed Saturday's g.'me.
First-string fullback Dan Far
thing broke his hand in a boxing
match and is out for the year.
Right inside Dick Bartlett had a
hemorrhage in his log and missed
the Gator game, but will play
next week against Santa Clara.

Stanford is fortunate to have
so many substitutes who can j;<>
into a game and give a good a:
count of themselves under pres
sure. Miklos Totossy took over
for F a r t h i n g and Dick Voake
took over for Baseom, and both
played very capably.
The center line was shaken up
following last week's los-s to CC
SF, and the moves made by
Coach Fred Priddle really paid
off. Rune Engebrcttsen was
shifted from center forward to
right inside and played twice as
well as he did last week. Wolf
gang Storch moved from left half
to center forward and put two
goals into the nets.
Adam Bianehi, right wing, also
scored two goals and was cilod
by Priddle as having played his
best game of the year.
Henry Vieira took over the left
half position and played good ball
until he suffered a charleyhorxe
late in the game. He will play
next week. Jan Achenbaeh moved
into the center half slol and won
himself a first-string job.
Lief, Knaggs and Storch were

selected by the referee and the
S.F. Slate coach as the outstand
ing placers of the game. This is
the third such honor- in the three
league games that Stanford has
played.
The scoring went as follows:
Stanford scored first as Storch
dribbled the ball single-handedly
through the Gator team and
faked the goalie out of his sweat
shirt before easily netting the
goal. Bianchi made the next goa'
with the aid of a fine pass h\
Mike Tippett. Knaggs and then
Bianchi again scored to end the
half with a 4-0 Stanford lead.
Storch Scores
Storch scored early in the sec
ond half and put the game out of
reach. The Gators finally got on
the scoreboard when their center
forward Norm Friedberg scored
Goals by E ngeb r e t t s en and
"Zach" Lauw-Zecha, who substi
tuted for Engebrettsen late in the
game, rounded out the scoring.

league games that Stanford has
played.
The scoring went as follows:
Stanford scored first as Storch
dribbled the ball single-handedly
through the Gator team and
faked the goalie out of his sweat
shirt before easily netting the
goal. Bianchi made the next goa'
with the aid of a fine pass h\
Mike Tippett. Knaggs and then
Bianchi again scored to end the
half with a 4-0 Stanford lead.
Storch Scores
Storch scored early in the sec
ond half and put the game out of
reach. The Gators finally got on
the scoreboard when their center
forward Norm Friedberg scored
Goals by E ngeb r e t t s en and
"Zach" Lauw-Zecha, who substi
tuted for Engebrettsen late in the
game, rounded out the scoring.
Stanford massacred a game bunch of San Francisco Gators, 7-1,
Saturday in a soccer game in San Francisco. This was definitely the
team's best showing of the 1959 season.
The large margin of victory is remarkable in view of the fact that
the team roster is beginning to look like an admittance list to a

hospital. All-American goalie Rill
Dittman seems to lie definitely
out for the season after fighting
mononucleosis for most of the
s u m m e r . His spectacular re
placement, Hunt Baseom, came
down with the flu and al •■<>
missed Saturday's g.'me.
First-string fullback Dan Far
thing broke his hand in a boxing
match and is out for the year.
Right inside Dick Bartlett had a
hemorrhage in his log and missed
the Gator game, but will play
next week against Santa Clara.
Subs Comic Through
Stanford is fortunate to have
so many substitutes who can j;<>
into a game and give a good a:
count of themselves under pres
sure. Miklos Totossy took over
for F a r t h i n g and Dick Voake
took over for Baseom, and both
played very capably.
The center line was shaken up
following last week's los-s to CC
SF, and the moves made by
Coach Fred Priddle really paid
off. Rune Engebrcttsen was
shifted from center forward to
right inside and played twice as
well as he did last week. Wolf
gang Storch moved from left half
to center forward and put two
goals into the nets.
Adam Bianehi, right wing, also
scored two goals and was cilod
by Priddle as having played his
best game of the year.
Henry Vieira took over the left
half position and played good ball
until he suffered a charleyhorxe
late in the game. He will play
next week. Jan Achenbaeh moved
into the center half slol and won
himself a first-string job.
Lief, Knaggs and Storch were

selected by the referee and the
S.F. Slate coach as the outstand

the third such honor- in the three
league games that Stanford has
