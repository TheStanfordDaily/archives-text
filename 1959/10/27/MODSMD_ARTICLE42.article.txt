# Elated Frosh Footballers Ready for Powerful UCLA
## 
### 
There is nothing like a couple
of big wins to pick up the spirit
and enthusiasm <d' a football
earn, as proved by Coach Homer
Smith and his freshman eleven.
Siniih. understandably elated
over the PapooseV 27-21 defeat of
SC this weekend, has noticed a
boom in spirit and chattel' among
his players.
Stanford's freshmen take on
another Southland rival this Sat
urday when they tackle UCLA at
Stanford. Kick-off time is 10:15
a.m.
Most (■ratifying'
"The most gratifying thing
'bout the SC game was the way
I he boys held up in that weath
■?ar," indicated Coach Smith. The
cmperature on the field was 100
degrees and the smog was thick.
Smith didn't hesitate to name
hi-s bulldozing fullback, Mike Do
herty, as the outstanding hack in
the game. The 218-pound full
back scored two touchdowns and
broke away for gains of 11 and
91 yards. The latter came on a
kickoff which he returned to the
Trobabe two-yard line.
Perhaps the big difference be
tween the two teams was the
Si an ford line which stubbornly
refused to give yardage up I he
middle. Tackle C. B. Simmons
was named top lineman by his
coach. Charles Buehler. Charles
Hartwig, Duncan Ross, Starr
Rounds and Randy Vahan also
did yeoman duty.
Smith also praised the play of
quarterback John Powers who
"did a fine job both offensively
and defensively."
•lessen Out
One bleak spot in a pretty
brighl afternoon was the loss of
the Papooses 'top receiver. Chris
Jessen, who is oul for the year
with a knee injury.
This loss may be offset by ihe
return of righi guard Steve Play
er and wingback Jim Griffith,
both of whom missed ihe SO
game. Griffith will fill in for Jim

Shroyer who has been moved *10
end in place of Jessen.
Defense has been the Papooses'
key weakness so far this season
In three games the opposition has
averaged almost 30 points per
game. Well aware of this flaw,
Smith says, "We hope the de
fense will be better Saturday so
we can have the ball more on of
fense."
One at a Time
Refusing to get carried away
by these early successes, Smith
says that he is playing one game
at a time and right now all he can
think about is UCLA. The Bru
babes, incidentally, whipped San
Diego State in their first game.
50-6.
Running from the traditional
Red Sanders single wing, the
Bruin frosh should be a real test
for Smith's yearlings.
California's Cubs, the first Pa
poose victim bounced back last
weekend by beating COP's fresh
men 50-16 making the Stanford
frosh appear even stronger in
California football circles.

Perhaps the big difference be
tween the two teams was the
Si an ford line which stubbornly
refused to give yardage up I he
middle. Tackle C. B. Simmons
was named top lineman by his
coach. Charles Buehler. Charles
Hartwig, Duncan Ross, Starr
Rounds and Randy Vahan also
did yeoman duty.
Smith also praised the play of
quarterback John Powers who
"did a fine job both offensively
and defensively."
•lessen Out
One bleak spot in a pretty
brighl afternoon was the loss of
the Papooses 'top receiver. Chris
Jessen, who is oul for the year
with a knee injury.
This loss may be offset by ihe
return of righi guard Steve Play
er and wingback Jim Griffith,
both of whom missed ihe SO
game. Griffith will fill in for Jim

Shroyer who has been moved *10
end in place of Jessen.
Defense has been the Papooses'
key weakness so far this season
In three games the opposition has
averaged almost 30 points per
game. Well aware of this flaw,
Smith says, "We hope the de
fense will be better Saturday so
we can have the ball more on of
fense."
One at a Time
Refusing to get carried away
by these early successes, Smith
says that he is playing one game
at a time and right now all he can
think about is UCLA. The Bru
babes, incidentally, whipped San
Diego State in their first game.
50-6.
Running from the traditional
Red Sanders single wing, the
Bruin frosh should be a real test
for Smith's yearlings.
California's Cubs, the first Pa
poose victim bounced back last
weekend by beating COP's fresh
men 50-16 making the Stanford
frosh appear even stronger in
California football circles.

Most (■ratifying'
"The most gratifying thing
'bout the SC game was the way
I he boys held up in that weath

cmperature on the field was 100
degrees and the smog was thick.
Smith didn't hesitate to name
hi-s bulldozing fullback, Mike Do

the game. The 218-pound full
back scored two touchdowns and
broke away for gains of 11 and
91 yards. The latter came on a
kickoff which he returned to the
