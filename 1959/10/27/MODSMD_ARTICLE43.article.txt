### 
Even a trip to Southern Cali
fornia last weekend couldn't got
the Indian water polo team into
Ihe win column as they absorbed
their third and fourth losses of
the season at the hands of SC
27-7 and UCLA 10-8.
The UCLA encounter was a
heartbreaker for Stanford as they
lost two of their top men, Jack
Lorton and Craig Smith in the
second quarter on fouls. The In
dians managed to battle to a one
point load at the end of the third
quarter, but the loss of George
Harrison at this point combined
with the Card's lack of proper
conditioning gave the Bruins a
four point fourth quarter and the
10-8 win.
In Coach Haynie's opinion "We
are on a par right now with
UCLA in man power. If we can
keep all our men in the pool, two
more weeks conditioning should
be enough to give Stanford the
victory next time we meet."
