## Steel Front Broken as Union Negotiates 2-Year Separate Truce With Kaiser 
### 
WASHINGTON (A') — The Kai
ser Steel Corporation last night
signed a separate peace with the
Steelworkers Union. Il could be
the big break in the record steel
strike.
The agreement between the un
ion and the nation's ninth biggest
steel producer smashed the indus
try's solid front for the first time
since the mills shut down 104
days ago.
The new Kaiser - Steelworkers
pact will be in force for nearly
two years, until June 30. 1961. It
provides an added 10 cents in
fringe benefits for 7500 Kaiser
employees the first year. They
will get 12 4 cent-s more the sec
ond year, including a seven-cents
an-hour pay boost.
The pact also provides for a
company - union committee to
study ways to "insure a proper
sharing of the fruits of the com
pany's progress." Officials of
both sides denied this could be
called a profit-sharing plan.
Shunted to a committee was
the problem of wo r k rule s

changes—one of the most touchy
issues in the long - drawn ■ out
wrangle between the giant union
and 96 steel producers.
Kaiser officials ordered be
tween 500 and 600 maintenance
workers to report at midnight
Monday and called back nearly
1200 workers for the 8 a.m. shift
Tuesday.
Announcement of the agree
ment capped day-long negotia
tions between company officials
headed by Board Chairman Ed
gar F. Kaiser and steelworkers'
representatives led by union
President David J. McDonald.
Kaiser and McDonald said:
"We regard this agreement to
he a non-inflationary -settlement,
designed to work for the best in
terests of the management, the
employees and the public."
Praising Kaiser for "real en
lightened leadership," McDonald
invited "all other steel companies
to come forward immediately and
sign this agreement and put the
over 500,000 steelworkers back on
their jobs."
The agreement was announced
after nearly five hours of nego
tiations behind closed doors.
McDonald's .statement said,
"Both parties believe lhat this
agreement is in the public inter
est and fully responsive to Presi
dent Eisenhower's plea for a
prompt and freely negotiated set
tlement by collective bargaining."
The signing was done amid a
public display of good will be
tween Kaiser and McDonald. They

shook hands and threw their
arms about each other while un
ion officials and representatives
applauded.
Spelling out details, McDonald
said the agreement provides for
improvements in insurance, pen
sions and wages, spread over the
duration of the contract.
McDonald and Kaiser told a
news conference the first year of
the contract will provide 10 cents
an hour of additional pension
payments, group insurance and
supplemental employment bene
fits for the workers.
The •supplemental benefits
mean pay in addition to unem
ployment compensation for an
employee who is laid off.
