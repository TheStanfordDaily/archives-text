## Professor Discusses John Dewey 
### Jo Nielsen 
John Dewey's efforts at find- !
injur a way to settle moral con- j
flicit werc directed at liberating
man from bondage to blind tradi- [
tion. This was one of the high- :
lights of Ihe lecture given last !
night by Professor Ernest Nagel
of Columbia University on "John 1
Dewey Philosopher .of Sri ence." I
Nagel explained the title of his
! talk by revealing that Dewey
I turned to the sciences to find an
| embodiment of some general
principles' which would give a
logical theory for the solving of
I moral problems.
"It is not unfair to say that
Dewey was primarily a moral
ist," said Nagel in commemorat
ing the centennial anniversary
I last week of philosopher Dewey's
; birth. He went on to show that
; Dewey felt that moral problems
tended to be solved by falling
j back onto custom.
Cling to Theories
The problem wjth this, thought
! the philosopher, was the fact that 1
scientists then clung to certain j
theories only because of tradi
tion.
Dewey was not looking for just t
a general formula that would ap-!
ply to all morals, however, but j
rather for a comprehensive prin
ciple lhat would control knowl
edge in a given field. For, as Na-;
gel put it,"The full reality of
knowledge is carried in the indi-1
vidual case, not in generalities." j
From analyzing science, Dewey i
decided that the laws of nature, I
so termed by the scientist, were
simply tools for effecting jhe!
aims of inquiry. "Scientific laws '
are principles for organizing in
quiry," Nagel clarified.
Limit Set
He explained that Dewey also
drew the conclusion that a limit
should be set to the scope of sci
entific authority, for many dis
coveries of -science are unrelated
to human experiences, and there
fore are remote from man.
The Columbia professor justi
fied Dewey's use of science in his
search for a morality formula by
stating that science itself is a
product of inquiry, and it is one
of the missions of science to cor
rect theories used only because of
tradition.
