# Tunnel Research Borings Begin at Accelerator Site

Project "M," Stanford's pro
posed two-mile-long atom smash
er is into exploratory geological
research—only a shade past Ihe
drawing board stage, but ap
proaching reality.
Drilling of "core samples" to
determine the best location for
the giant linear accelerator is now
in progress on the proposed site
in the foothills behind the collcge
campus.
Determining Costs
Last summer, the Atomic En
ergy Commission awarded a con
tract to the University for ex
ploration of the proposed site to
determine the best tunnel path
and to establish site conditions
for "refining present cost esti
mates.
Stanford plans to bore two
parallel tunnels under a two
mile stretch of foothills. One tun
nel, 10 feet in diameter, would
contain the actual accelerator
tube. The other, 24 feet in dia
meter, will iiouse control equip
ment operated by technicians run
ning the atom smasher.
The lunnels will be separated
by 33 feet of earth and rock to
shield the operators from the
radiation produced by the ac
cerator when it is operating.
'Core Sampling'
Consultant geologist, Dr. Frank
W. Atchley, said that "core sam
pling" would be used to deter
mine the type of material lying
at to levels through which the
tubes will run.

, The tunnels will be 100 feet
below the earth's surface at the
shallowest point and will some
times be as deep as 350 feet.
A Boise, Idaho, firm, Nichols
and Thompson, was awarded the
| drilling contract three weeks ago
j and has completed five of the six
teen "holes" that are planned.
In sampling, a three-inch tube
with one end ringed by black dia
monds is drilled into the ground,
It cuts a "rod of rock" which
is analyzed to show what type of
material is being drilled through
at that depth.
Additional information is ob
i tained by forcing water into the
drilled hole at high pressures. A
! high rate of water loss indicates
fractured and porous rock.
President's Support
On May 14, President Eisen
hower announced his support of
the Stanford proposal:
"I am recommending to the
; Congress," he said, "that the
federal government finance the
construction as a national facility.
"Because of the cost, such a
project must become a federal re
| sponsibility. This proposed na
! tional facility, which will be by
far the largest of its kind ever
built a machine two miles long
—has the endorsement of the in
terested government agencies.
I Construction of the accelerator
will take six years, at an over-all
cost of approximately $100,-
; 000,000.
"By such means the govern
i men! labors to advance our scien
tific knowledge and to further
the free use oj' science for healing,
for enriching life and freeing the
! spirit."
Need for Smasher
Describing the need for a larger
atom smasher than those now
! existent, Dr. Robert Hofstadter,
j University physicist, said: "VVe
' have a clear picture of the outer
seven-tenths of the particles
I (protons and neutrons) but no
j one can be sure what lies within
J the inner three-tenths. We've
j heard some interesting guesses,
, but non seems to offer a really
j satisfactory explanation. With
: higher energies we can look
deeper. That's where we'll find
the correct answer."
Russia has announced plans for
building a 50 billion electron
volt '(BEV) accelerator with a
1 beam power of about 50 watts,
approximately the amount used
by an ordinary light bulb. The
proposed Stanford accelerator
will eventually operate at 45 BEV
and over a million watts when
finished.
| The largest accelerator now in
j operation is the University of Cal
i ifornia's circular "Bevatron."
