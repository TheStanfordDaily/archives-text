# A 						Slap in the Face
## 
### 
StiDi n r government has received a slap in llie fare at tlie Uni
versity of <California.
In a directive aimed at greater decentralization within the
I diversity of California, UC President ('.lark Kerr last week put
student affairs on all campuses in the hands of the chancellors and
provosts.
The directive states that student organizations cannot, hv their
nature, have full independence of action, and therefore student
action is subject to prior review.
As an administration representative at UC's Berkeley campus
explained tlie directive, "I don't think student government has as
one of its roles speaking to the public. This is the role of the
University Affairs Council. The student government is not meant
to represent student opinion in off-campus issues.
Tlie spokesman continued to explain that this authority has
always existed, that this is only a specification of the lines of au
thority. 'Students must accept the same kind of limitations that
are on the faculty," he said.
In a joint editorial the Daily California!!, the Santa Barbara
El Gaucho and the Riverside Highlander called the action a "slap
in the face" for student government. "If they think at all they
(the students) will protest the president's action. If they do not
protest, lliev deserve what they're getting,"" the editorial con
cludes.
The UCLA Daily Bruin called the protests of its sister papers
"a popular wave of extremism."" The Bruin described its stand
as "a sort of hostile acceptance," because it docs "not question the
legal right of the president.
The Bruin continues, "Our eyes are on the men who will apply
this policy. . . . They must use this policy as a guide, not as a
crutch or whip.*'
\\ e agree with the Bruin. I his policy must not be a crutch
or whip. But we cannot approve of the Bruin stand of "hostile
acceptance." And we do not concur in labeling the Daily Cali
fornian as a victim of "a popular wave ot extremism.
The Daily Californian is not foolishly crying wolf. I his wolf
is real.
We doubt the wisdom of a university policy which censors and
ultimately controls the voice of its student body. The opportunity
for a student body to express its views is a valuable one. It is
one of the most educational experiences available to students, as
a group or individually.

The UCLA Daily Bruin called the protests of its sister papers
"a popular wave of extremism."" The Bruin described its stand
as "a sort of hostile acceptance," because it docs "not question the
legal right of the president.
The Bruin continues, "Our eyes are on the men who will apply
this policy. . . . They must use this policy as a guide, not as a
crutch or whip.*'
\\ e agree with the Bruin. I his policy must not be a crutch
or whip. But we cannot approve of the Bruin stand of "hostile
acceptance." And we do not concur in labeling the Daily Cali
fornian as a victim of "a popular wave ot extremism.
The Daily Californian is not foolishly crying wolf. I his wolf
is real.
We doubt the wisdom of a university policy which censors and
ultimately controls the voice of its student body. The opportunity
for a student body to express its views is a valuable one. It is
one of the most educational experiences available to students, as
a group or individually.
StiDi n r government has received a slap in llie fare at tlie Uni
versity of <California.
In a directive aimed at greater decentralization within the
I diversity of California, UC President ('.lark Kerr last week put
student affairs on all campuses in the hands of the chancellors and
provosts.
The directive states that student organizations cannot, hv their
nature, have full independence of action, and therefore student
action is subject to prior review.
As an administration representative at UC's Berkeley campus
explained tlie directive, "I don't think student government has as
one of its roles speaking to the public. This is the role of the
University Affairs Council. The student government is not meant
to represent student opinion in off-campus issues.
Tlie spokesman continued to explain that this authority has
always existed, that this is only a specification of the lines of au
thority. 'Students must accept the same kind of limitations that
are on the faculty," he said.
