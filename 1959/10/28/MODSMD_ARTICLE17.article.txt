This weekend appears to be a
"home weekend" in more ways
than one. Mid-term exams and
the football game Saturday alone
would ensure a good-sized on
campus group, but along with
these stimuli, three plays are
opening this week in the area.
Tonight, the already-much
publicized "THE MOON BE
SIEGED" opens in Memorial
Auditorium with Ben Cooper,
stereophonic sound, and the
fact that it is a pre Broadway,
premiere performance as chief
drawing cards.
Cooper, a veteran actor of 16
years experience who started in
the theater at the age of eight,
said at a press luncheon last week
that he really hasn't been on the
stage for 14 years. Although
offered roles in several stage pro
ductions, he has preferred to con
centrate on radio, television and
film appcarences in the past
years.
When contacted by director
Sensenbach about appearing in
"The Moon Besieged," the per
sonable young actor said lie felt
an immediate sympathy with the
character of Oliver Brown, son of
the fanatic abolitionist, John
Brown. "You might say I'm
gambling up here right now," he
said, but added that ho believes
"you learn from every job you
do."
Cooper, who joined the cast
here after the others already
had been in rehearsal for a
week, commented on the great
amount of "spirit and zeal" in
the group. They are doing
"awfully good work," he said,
noting in particular the per
formances of A 1 Kaufman and
Julia Curtis.
To alleviate some of Ihe ten
c ion a basically nonprofessional
cast might feel in working with
a professional actor, Cooper said
that at his first rehearsal here
he mentioned two things: one,
that he was not to be called "Mr.
Cooper," and two, that if the
others had been worried aboul
memorizing all their lines, to for
get it—he didn't know his lines
"cold" either.
Another premier perform
ance will he seen this Friday
night at 642 High Street in
Pal > Alto when The Troupe
Thea'er presents K en n e th
Patehen's play "DON'T LOOK
NOW."
One of America's major con
temporary poets, Patchen, in his
first plav, has presented seven

human beings trying to salvage
their lives in the face of some
terrible catastrophe they cannot
see or understand.

the Bay Area's best-known actors
and actresses, includes Tom Win
ston, currently a KJBS disc jock

This weekend appears to be a
"home weekend" in more ways
than one. Mid-term exams and
the football game Saturday alone
would ensure a good-sized on
campus group, but along with
these stimuli, three plays are
opening this week in the area.
Tonight, the already-much
publicized "THE MOON BE
SIEGED" opens in Memorial
Auditorium with Ben Cooper,
stereophonic sound, and the
fact that it is a pre Broadway,
premiere performance as chief
drawing cards.
Cooper, a veteran actor of 16
years experience who started in
the theater at the age of eight,
said at a press luncheon last week
that he really hasn't been on the
stage for 14 years. Although
offered roles in several stage pro
ductions, he has preferred to con
centrate on radio, television and
film appcarences in the past
years.
When contacted by director
Sensenbach about appearing in
"The Moon Besieged," the per
sonable young actor said lie felt
an immediate sympathy with the
character of Oliver Brown, son of
the fanatic abolitionist, John
Brown. "You might say I'm
gambling up here right now," he
said, but added that ho believes
"you learn from every job you
do."
Cooper, who joined the cast
here after the others already
had been in rehearsal for a
week, commented on the great
amount of "spirit and zeal" in
the group. They are doing
"awfully good work," he said,
noting in particular the per
formances of A 1 Kaufman and
Julia Curtis.
To alleviate some of Ihe ten
c ion a basically nonprofessional
cast might feel in working with
a professional actor, Cooper said
that at his first rehearsal here
he mentioned two things: one,
that he was not to be called "Mr.
Cooper," and two, that if the
others had been worried aboul
memorizing all their lines, to for
get it—he didn't know his lines
"cold" either.
Another premier perform
ance will he seen this Friday
night at 642 High Street in
Pal > Alto when The Troupe
Thea'er presents K en n e th
Patehen's play "DON'T LOOK
NOW."
One of America's major con
temporary poets, Patchen, in his
first plav, has presented seven

human beings trying to salvage
their lives in the face of some
terrible catastrophe they cannot
see or understand.
The cast, composed of seven of
the Bay Area's best-known actors
and actresses, includes Tom Win
ston, currently a KJBS disc jock
ey, Mae F. Ward, Nancy Mc-
Knight and Mary Ellen Mims.
Scheduled for a five-week run,
the play will be shown Thursday

week, commented on the great
amount of "spirit and zeal" in
the group. They are doing
"awfully good work," he said,
noting in particular the per
formances of A 1 Kaufman and
Julia Curtis.
To alleviate some of Ihe ten
c ion a basically nonprofessional
cast might feel in working with
a professional actor, Cooper said
that at his first rehearsal here
he mentioned two things: one,
that he was not to be called "Mr.
Cooper," and two, that if the
others had been worried aboul
memorizing all their lines, to for
get it—he didn't know his lines
"cold" either.

This weekend appears to be a
"home weekend" in more ways
than one. Mid-term exams and
the football game Saturday alone
would ensure a good-sized on
campus group, but along with
these stimuli, three plays are
opening this week in the area.
Tonight, the already-much
publicized "THE MOON BE
SIEGED" opens in Memorial
Auditorium with Ben Cooper,
stereophonic sound, and the
fact that it is a pre Broadway,
premiere performance as chief
drawing cards.
Cooper, a veteran actor of 16
years experience who started in
the theater at the age of eight,
said at a press luncheon last week
that he really hasn't been on the
stage for 14 years. Although
offered roles in several stage pro
ductions, he has preferred to con
centrate on radio, television and
film appcarences in the past
years.
When contacted by director
Sensenbach about appearing in
"The Moon Besieged," the per
sonable young actor said lie felt
an immediate sympathy with the
character of Oliver Brown, son of
the fanatic abolitionist, John
Brown. "You might say I'm
gambling up here right now," he
said, but added that ho believes
"you learn from every job you
do."
