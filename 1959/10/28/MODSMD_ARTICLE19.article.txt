Low Comedy?
! Editor, The Daily:
After Saturday's high drama at
Los Angeles, does last week's
election of WUS's "Red Hot Pro
fessor'' look like low comedy?
Nevertheless, I am sure that Mr.
: Shuchat, Mr. Servos and I re
ceived with the same mixed feel-
I ings the first election returns
(and your cameramen!) Tuesday
! night.
Surprise that we should be out
I in front. Gratitude for the kindly
impulse which led so many to dig
for pennies to put on our noses.
I Chagrin that Notoriety—Fame's
| call-girl cousin—was winking at
■ us.
Apprehension lest we bo nomi
nated to The Big K's little band
of nimble jacks. These senti
ments were bound to grow as the
balloting went on.
For my part loyalty to well
moaning supporters and to those
i distant students whose cause was
being served by the continued
clinking of pennies, dimes and
dollars kept me in the act. I have
no doubt but that the same was
true of the other front-runners,
although both of them, if we can
accept the photographic evidence,
appear beter qualified for the
accolade.
Now "the people's choice" by a
very narrow margin <$17» in
Thursday's eleventh hour at the
polls, I must bend a neck as sliff
as my other joints.
"There are some situations
which, once entered into, must be
carried through to the end," ob
serves Christopher Motley in the
opening scene of his "Thunder on
the Left." (The book came out
while I was an undergraduate
rooter at Stanford games fought
and forgotten before you were
born.)
Only, today's is a situation
that my eollegues and I didn't
enter; it swept up and broke over
us. "Protect me from my friends,"
the Due fie Villars, Louis XlV's
i great general, prayed his Sire;
'I can take care of my enemies."
To which a fervent "Amen."
For last Tuesday I was still a
simple academiciaij pursuing
with tongue and pen a destiny
obscure. But since Thursday the
hounds of the city-desk have been
baying the heavens and yelping
about my door.
"Arc you or are you not going
to lead a yell?" "How about a pic
ture of you warming up for
Saturday?" "Will your costume
be like Kartozian's?" "Is there
any foundation to the rumor go
ing about that you will decline
this opportunity to have thous
ands roar at your bidding?"
(More likely at my fumbles!)
And this I owe to the charitable
impulses of my friends!
But to all who contributed
time and money to the World
University Service drive, I repeat
Mr. Knopf's words of thanks.
For my two eollegues T happily
borrow Mr. Knopf's suggestion
that so close a finish marks all
three of us with the same bright
dye.
And thinking of Mr. Kartozian,
who will no doubt make high
comedy for Saturday's Roman
j holiday, I echo the cry that
1 opener! the show in many an
ancient arena "Mortituri salu
! tamus" which, for the present
situation might be best, if very

roughly, translated "Lead on,
Mac Duff."

The Whole Paper
Editor, The Daily:
Through vigorous campaigning
and letter-writting (signing), it
has become an uncontestable fact
that foreign student opinion has
not been given sufficient room,
heed and public attention in the
past on this campus.
The last letter to the editor
(preceding the present flood of
entries* by a foreign student was
by Mohammed Ibn Saud in 1948
who complained about the "lack
j of adaptability of Stanford coeds
i and the absurdity'of social regu
lations," a topic which, although
i remote and farfetched, indicates

I nevertheless one of the areas of
I possible comment.)
As a matter of fact it had con-1
sistently been pushed into the
background, where, under the !
sheltering halls of the recently
established "I" Center, opinions [
have led a paltry wallflower ex- j
i istence, only quarterly breaking
I into sudden bloom in a "Bridge"-
| head of authenticity and tea
| leaves.
It has been argued that the es
| tablishing of a column in The
I Daily would remedy this painful
lack of publicity for the worthy
i comments of a small but critical
| thinking minority of this campus.
! It seem* that this idea, revolu-1
i tionary and compelling though it
! is, stops far short of the true so
-1 hit ion. It is, therefore, suggested |
to hand over the complete Daily
to a new staff composed of for
eign students.
Since the sports page is the
only consistently read page of the
present Daily anyway, and the
editorial comment usually below
any academic par, one could pos
sibly compromise by keeping the
present sports staff, however
poor their football predictions
may be, and concentrate for the
rest, of the paper on penetrating
analyses and comparisons, blend
ed into a pleasant texture of Eu
ropean jokes, travelogues (by
Mr. Couch man) and political
news to be provided by foreign
students.

Low Comedy?
! Editor, The Daily:
After Saturday's high drama at
Los Angeles, does last week's
election of WUS's "Red Hot Pro
fessor'' look like low comedy?
Nevertheless, I am sure that Mr.
: Shuchat, Mr. Servos and I re
ceived with the same mixed feel-
I ings the first election returns
(and your cameramen!) Tuesday
! night.
Surprise that we should be out
I in front. Gratitude for the kindly
impulse which led so many to dig
for pennies to put on our noses.
I Chagrin that Notoriety—Fame's
| call-girl cousin—was winking at
■ us.
Apprehension lest we bo nomi
nated to The Big K's little band
of nimble jacks. These senti
ments were bound to grow as the
balloting went on.
For my part loyalty to well
moaning supporters and to those
i distant students whose cause was
being served by the continued
clinking of pennies, dimes and
dollars kept me in the act. I have
no doubt but that the same was
true of the other front-runners,
although both of them, if we can
accept the photographic evidence,
appear beter qualified for the
accolade.
Now "the people's choice" by a
very narrow margin <$17» in
Thursday's eleventh hour at the
polls, I must bend a neck as sliff
as my other joints.
"There are some situations
which, once entered into, must be
carried through to the end," ob
serves Christopher Motley in the
opening scene of his "Thunder on
the Left." (The book came out
while I was an undergraduate
rooter at Stanford games fought
and forgotten before you were
born.)
Only, today's is a situation
that my eollegues and I didn't
enter; it swept up and broke over
us. "Protect me from my friends,"
the Due fie Villars, Louis XlV's
i great general, prayed his Sire;
'I can take care of my enemies."
To which a fervent "Amen."
For last Tuesday I was still a
simple academiciaij pursuing
with tongue and pen a destiny
obscure. But since Thursday the
hounds of the city-desk have been
baying the heavens and yelping
about my door.
"Arc you or are you not going
to lead a yell?" "How about a pic
ture of you warming up for
Saturday?" "Will your costume
be like Kartozian's?" "Is there
any foundation to the rumor go
ing about that you will decline
this opportunity to have thous
ands roar at your bidding?"
(More likely at my fumbles!)
And this I owe to the charitable
impulses of my friends!
But to all who contributed
time and money to the World
University Service drive, I repeat
Mr. Knopf's words of thanks.
For my two eollegues T happily
borrow Mr. Knopf's suggestion
that so close a finish marks all
three of us with the same bright
dye.
And thinking of Mr. Kartozian,
who will no doubt make high
comedy for Saturday's Roman
j holiday, I echo the cry that
1 opener! the show in many an
ancient arena "Mortituri salu
! tamus" which, for the present
situation might be best, if very

roughly, translated "Lead on,
Mac Duff."

and letter-writting (signing), it
has become an uncontestable fact
that foreign student opinion has
not been given sufficient room,
heed and public attention in the
past on this campus.
The last letter to the editor
(preceding the present flood of
entries* by a foreign student was
by Mohammed Ibn Saud in 1948
who complained about the "lack
j of adaptability of Stanford coeds
i and the absurdity'of social regu
lations," a topic which, although
i remote and farfetched, indicates

I nevertheless one of the areas of
I possible comment.)
As a matter of fact it had con-1
sistently been pushed into the
background, where, under the !
sheltering halls of the recently
established "I" Center, opinions [
have led a paltry wallflower ex- j
i istence, only quarterly breaking
I into sudden bloom in a "Bridge"-
| head of authenticity and tea
| leaves.
It has been argued that the es
| tablishing of a column in The
I Daily would remedy this painful
lack of publicity for the worthy
i comments of a small but critical
| thinking minority of this campus.
! It seem* that this idea, revolu-1
i tionary and compelling though it
! is, stops far short of the true so
-1 hit ion. It is, therefore, suggested |
to hand over the complete Daily
to a new staff composed of for
eign students.
Since the sports page is the
only consistently read page of the
present Daily anyway, and the
editorial comment usually below
any academic par, one could pos
sibly compromise by keeping the
present sports staff, however
poor their football predictions
may be, and concentrate for the
rest, of the paper on penetrating
analyses and comparisons, blend
ed into a pleasant texture of Eu
ropean jokes, travelogues (by
Mr. Couch man) and political
news to be provided by foreign
students.

Low Comedy?
! Editor, The Daily:
After Saturday's high drama at
Los Angeles, does last week's
election of WUS's "Red Hot Pro
fessor'' look like low comedy?
Nevertheless, I am sure that Mr.
: Shuchat, Mr. Servos and I re
ceived with the same mixed feel-
I ings the first election returns
(and your cameramen!) Tuesday
! night.
Surprise that we should be out
I in front. Gratitude for the kindly
impulse which led so many to dig
for pennies to put on our noses.
I Chagrin that Notoriety—Fame's
| call-girl cousin—was winking at
■ us.
Apprehension lest we bo nomi
nated to The Big K's little band
of nimble jacks. These senti
ments were bound to grow as the
balloting went on.
For my part loyalty to well
moaning supporters and to those
i distant students whose cause was
being served by the continued
clinking of pennies, dimes and
dollars kept me in the act. I have
no doubt but that the same was
true of the other front-runners,
although both of them, if we can
accept the photographic evidence,
appear beter qualified for the
accolade.
Now "the people's choice" by a
very narrow margin <$17» in
Thursday's eleventh hour at the
polls, I must bend a neck as sliff
as my other joints.
"There are some situations
which, once entered into, must be
carried through to the end," ob
serves Christopher Motley in the
opening scene of his "Thunder on
the Left." (The book came out
while I was an undergraduate
rooter at Stanford games fought
and forgotten before you were
born.)
Only, today's is a situation
that my eollegues and I didn't
enter; it swept up and broke over
us. "Protect me from my friends,"
the Due fie Villars, Louis XlV's
i great general, prayed his Sire;
'I can take care of my enemies."
To which a fervent "Amen."
For last Tuesday I was still a
simple academiciaij pursuing
with tongue and pen a destiny
obscure. But since Thursday the
hounds of the city-desk have been
baying the heavens and yelping
about my door.
"Arc you or are you not going
to lead a yell?" "How about a pic
ture of you warming up for
Saturday?" "Will your costume
be like Kartozian's?" "Is there
any foundation to the rumor go
ing about that you will decline
this opportunity to have thous
ands roar at your bidding?"
(More likely at my fumbles!)
And this I owe to the charitable
impulses of my friends!
But to all who contributed
time and money to the World
University Service drive, I repeat
Mr. Knopf's words of thanks.
For my two eollegues T happily
borrow Mr. Knopf's suggestion
that so close a finish marks all
three of us with the same bright
dye.
And thinking of Mr. Kartozian,
who will no doubt make high
comedy for Saturday's Roman
j holiday, I echo the cry that
1 opener! the show in many an
ancient arena "Mortituri salu
! tamus" which, for the present
situation might be best, if very

roughly, translated "Lead on,
Mac Duff."

this opportunity to have thous
ands roar at your bidding?"
(More likely at my fumbles!)
And this I owe to the charitable
impulses of my friends!
But to all who contributed
time and money to the World
University Service drive, I repeat
Mr. Knopf's words of thanks.
For my two eollegues T happily
borrow Mr. Knopf's suggestion
that so close a finish marks all
three of us with the same bright
dye.
And thinking of Mr. Kartozian,
who will no doubt make high
comedy for Saturday's Roman
j holiday, I echo the cry that
1 opener! the show in many an
ancient arena "Mortituri salu
! tamus" which, for the present
situation might be best, if very

roughly, translated "Lead on,
Mac Duff."

The Whole Paper
Editor, The Daily:
Through vigorous campaigning
and letter-writting (signing), it
has become an uncontestable fact
that foreign student opinion has
not been given sufficient room,
heed and public attention in the
past on this campus.
The last letter to the editor
(preceding the present flood of
entries* by a foreign student was
by Mohammed Ibn Saud in 1948
who complained about the "lack
j of adaptability of Stanford coeds
i and the absurdity'of social regu
lations," a topic which, although
i remote and farfetched, indicates

I nevertheless one of the areas of
I possible comment.)
As a matter of fact it had con-1
sistently been pushed into the
background, where, under the !
sheltering halls of the recently
established "I" Center, opinions [
have led a paltry wallflower ex- j
i istence, only quarterly breaking
I into sudden bloom in a "Bridge"-
| head of authenticity and tea
| leaves.
It has been argued that the es
| tablishing of a column in The
I Daily would remedy this painful
lack of publicity for the worthy
i comments of a small but critical
| thinking minority of this campus.
! It seem* that this idea, revolu-1
i tionary and compelling though it
! is, stops far short of the true so
-1 hit ion. It is, therefore, suggested |
to hand over the complete Daily
to a new staff composed of for
eign students.
Since the sports page is the
only consistently read page of the
present Daily anyway, and the
editorial comment usually below
any academic par, one could pos
sibly compromise by keeping the
present sports staff, however
poor their football predictions
may be, and concentrate for the
rest, of the paper on penetrating
analyses and comparisons, blend
ed into a pleasant texture of Eu
ropean jokes, travelogues (by
Mr. Couch man) and political
news to be provided by foreign
students.
