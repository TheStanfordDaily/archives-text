### Rich Sundeen ASSU President 
Among events occurring in the
past week on other university
campuses, I would like to com
ment upon one. It involves the
recenl ruling at the University of
California by which student body
organizations cannot express
opinions on any off-campus is
sues of the flay, such as political,
[ economic or religious pr oblems
without consent of the campus
chancellor or provost.
>Iy point is not to attack or
praise this policy nor to brag
that this could never happen at
I Stanford.
We do not face the same prob
lems as.a state university. May
I only remind the reader of our
good fortune to have a student
| association ( the ASSU) that re
mains as a separate entity from
the University?
And as long as all of the groups
that comprise ASSU act in a ma
ture manrler and within the Uni
versity's founding grant, ASSU
I will continue to function as a
separate and independent body.
The livelihood of many or
ganizations that present inter
esting and thought - provoking
programs and publications to
the student body depends upon
j this independence of the Asso
i ciation.
Thus,' such groups as the IIR.
! Political Union, The Daily and Se
[ quoia are able to present a wide
variety of opinions and view
points in their respective fields,
thereby enhancing the possibili
ties of broadening ihe individu
al's understanding of the world
around him.

I hope this privilege is not ta
ken for granted.
Rather, it is my desire that the
members of ASSU organizations
and their patrons will realize the
benefits of the autonomous posi
(ion of ASSU and its concurrent
responsibilities.
Today is the last day for nom
inations for LASS I representa
tives unit freshman class offi
cers. If yon have any desire at
all to hold an office may 1 urge
you to fill out a nomination
slip and run for the office?
The experience of the cam
paign alone presenting yourself
before other people and meeting
students is worth the time ant!
effort.
If elected, the new and varied
responsibilities entailed in the.
various offices can only add to
your University learning experi
ence.
