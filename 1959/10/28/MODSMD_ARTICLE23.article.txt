Dr. Bailey, who believes that
Dickens cannot be appreciated
unless his dramatic works are
read aloud, is known for her
comic timing and variety of voice,
giving both descriptive and nar-

rative passages the electric vital
ity Dickens intended.
A native California!!. Dr. Bailey
received her first degrees from
Stanford, and earned her Ph. D.
at Yale. Later she spent a year
abroad studying production of
classic drama in theatres of
Germany, France, and England.
In 1935-37 Dr. Bailey headed
a Stanford summer institute in
Stage Classics Production, work
ing with a directing staff of Wil
liam Thornton, James Sandoe,
Robert Brauns, and Hubert Hel'f
ner, Sr. From this group came
the Dramatists' Alliance, which
Dr. Bailey served as proctor and
editor. Several of the plays of
this organization have since be
come minor classics, including
the 1942 award play, "Dark of
the Moon."
