# General Studies Program Extended
## 
### Dallas Young 
This year' for the first time all
undergraduate students are un
der the General Studies program.
Last year's seniors were the final
class under tlie old upper and
lower division program.
Harvey Hall, Registrar, ex
plained that the switch to the
General Studies program was to
"introduce more flexibility, stu
dents who wish may start special
izing earlier, and ... to see to
it that a Stanford bachelor de
gree contains a broad liberal
base."
Previously « t u d <? jit s had to
complete the general University
requirements during the first
two years, but now they may ful
fill them during any of the un
dergraduate years.
Discussion of Problems
The General Studies Program
Subcommittee on Advising and
Individual Student Requests met
recently to discuss problems that
have arisen during the three
years that the program has been
in effect.
The committee felt that Stan
ford students, not including
transfers, should not complete

more than one social science and
one humanities course at a dif
ferent school, i.e., summer school.
A student may fulfill the lan
guage requirement at any time
by examination, but if he is at
tempting to complete it by credit
transfer, he must take the sec
ond quarter of his second year
here. Any person can arrange to
take the language placement test
by contacting the individual de
partments. Dr. Hall added that
the course numbered 120 in each
language is designed specifically
to fulfill the additional require
ment.
Colloquia Seniors Only
For the last three years a stu
dent could fulfill part ol the sen
ior colloquia requirement during
his junior year. Beginning this
year only seniors may take col
loquai, all A.B. candidates must
take two and no student may
take a colloquium from a profes
sor in his major department.
If space permits, B.S. candi
dates may enroll in colloquia dur
ing registration, but may not sign
the class lists for them during
pre-reg.
Concerning the group activity

requirement, Dr. Hall differenti
ated between activities which are
listed in the Time Schedule and
might be taken for academic
credit and those which are not. A
student enrolling in an activity
listed in the Time Schedule (i.e.,
Band, P.E.) signs for 0 units if
for fulfillment of the activity re
quirement and for 1 unit if for
academic credit. Non-class activi
ties (i.e., Daily, Quad) grant ac
tivity credit from a list of par
ticipants certified by the faculty
adviser and submitted to the Gen
eral Studies office.
Two P.K. Classes .Minimum
A student must take a physical
education course during both the
freshman and sophomore years.
No P.E. classes may be taken by
academic credit until the activity
requirement is completed unless
a student is earning two class ac
tivities at 1he same time. Then
he may elect to take one for aca
demic credit.
Specific General Studies prob
lems 'should first be discussed
with a student's adviser, accord
ing to Dr. Hall, and, if further
help is needed, with Miss Cham
berlin, General Studies secre

tary, Room 11 ID. Miss Chamber
lin also handles changing of ad- J
visors or majors.
The General Studies Subcom
mittee on Advising and Individ-1
ual Student Requests supervises
just this type of technical aspects
of the program.

The committee felt that Stan
ford students, not including
transfers, should not complete

more than one social science and
one humanities course at a dif
ferent school, i.e., summer school.
A student may fulfill the lan
guage requirement at any time
by examination, but if he is at
tempting to complete it by credit
transfer, he must take the sec
ond quarter of his second year
here. Any person can arrange to
take the language placement test
by contacting the individual de
partments. Dr. Hall added that
the course numbered 120 in each
language is designed specifically
to fulfill the additional require
ment.
Colloquia Seniors Only
For the last three years a stu
dent could fulfill part ol the sen
ior colloquia requirement during
his junior year. Beginning this
year only seniors may take col
loquai, all A.B. candidates must
take two and no student may
take a colloquium from a profes
sor in his major department.
If space permits, B.S. candi
dates may enroll in colloquia dur
ing registration, but may not sign
the class lists for them during
pre-reg.
Concerning the group activity

requirement, Dr. Hall differenti
ated between activities which are
listed in the Time Schedule and
might be taken for academic
credit and those which are not. A
student enrolling in an activity
listed in the Time Schedule (i.e.,
Band, P.E.) signs for 0 units if
for fulfillment of the activity re
quirement and for 1 unit if for
academic credit. Non-class activi
ties (i.e., Daily, Quad) grant ac
tivity credit from a list of par
ticipants certified by the faculty
adviser and submitted to the Gen
eral Studies office.
Two P.K. Classes .Minimum
A student must take a physical
education course during both the
freshman and sophomore years.
No P.E. classes may be taken by
academic credit until the activity
requirement is completed unless
a student is earning two class ac
tivities at 1he same time. Then
he may elect to take one for aca
demic credit.
Specific General Studies prob
lems 'should first be discussed
with a student's adviser, accord
ing to Dr. Hall, and, if further
help is needed, with Miss Cham
berlin, General Studies secre

tary, Room 11 ID. Miss Chamber
lin also handles changing of ad- J
visors or majors.
The General Studies Subcom
mittee on Advising and Individ-1
ual Student Requests supervises
just this type of technical aspects
of the program.
This year' for the first time all
undergraduate students are un
der the General Studies program.
Last year's seniors were the final
class under tlie old upper and
lower division program.
Harvey Hall, Registrar, ex
plained that the switch to the
General Studies program was to
"introduce more flexibility, stu
dents who wish may start special
izing earlier, and ... to see to
it that a Stanford bachelor de
gree contains a broad liberal
base."
Previously « t u d <? jit s had to
