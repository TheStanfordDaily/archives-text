## Daily Sports 
### 
The New York Yankees and ex-
Brooklyn Dodgers had their fa
mous subway world series, and
Stanford has a football counter
part with its Bayshore Freeway
series with San Jose State. Next
Saturday the San Jose Spartans
invade Stanford's venerable 90,-
000-capaeity stadium for the six

| teenth m e e t in g of the two
j schools.
Basing an offense mainly on
the passing of senior quarterback
Emmet t Lee and sophomore sig
nal caller Ray Podesto, the Spar
tans have compiled a respectable
four-win, two - loss record for
their first six games of then 9

campaign.
Last week San Jose played
their best game of the season,
ran up a 21-0 lead on Arizona
State University and then cut the
Sun Devils' winning skein at nine
with a 24-115 victory.
Bay Area fans usually consider
Stanford's passing attack, led by
Dick Norman, to lie tlie most sen
sational offense of the local col
lege teams. But Lee, Podesto
and company have literally
thrown four opponents for a loss
by pitching for a total of 1198
yards, and their average of 199.7
yards per game is more than nine
yards better than the Indians'
190 3-yard average.
Besides the aerial antics of the
quarterbacks. San Jose has some
fast and effective runners. Five
foot six-inch, 192 -pound Oneal
Cuterry has netted 371 yards in
63 rushing attempts for a 5.9-
yard - per - carry average while
grabbing 19 passes for another
319 yards. Right behind Cuterry
is speedy sophomore Mac Burton
who has a .5.8-yard-per-carry av
erage.
Previously the lower peninsula
team had edged by Denver 14-13
and then smashed University of
Hawaii 44-1 1 and Fresno State 40-
14. San Jose's two losses came
from two northern independent
schools, Washington State Uni
versity and Oregon.

The New York Yankees and ex-
Brooklyn Dodgers had their fa
mous subway world series, and
Stanford has a football counter
part with its Bayshore Freeway
series with San Jose State. Next
Saturday the San Jose Spartans
invade Stanford's venerable 90,-
000-capaeity stadium for the six

| teenth m e e t in g of the two
j schools.
Basing an offense mainly on
the passing of senior quarterback
Emmet t Lee and sophomore sig
nal caller Ray Podesto, the Spar
tans have compiled a respectable
four-win, two - loss record for
their first six games of then 9

campaign.
Last week San Jose played
their best game of the season,
ran up a 21-0 lead on Arizona
State University and then cut the
Sun Devils' winning skein at nine
with a 24-115 victory.
Bay Area fans usually consider
Stanford's passing attack, led by
Dick Norman, to lie tlie most sen
sational offense of the local col
lege teams. But Lee, Podesto
and company have literally
thrown four opponents for a loss
by pitching for a total of 1198
yards, and their average of 199.7
yards per game is more than nine
yards better than the Indians'
190 3-yard average.
Besides the aerial antics of the
quarterbacks. San Jose has some
fast and effective runners. Five
foot six-inch, 192 -pound Oneal
Cuterry has netted 371 yards in
63 rushing attempts for a 5.9-
yard - per - carry average while
grabbing 19 passes for another
319 yards. Right behind Cuterry
is speedy sophomore Mac Burton
who has a .5.8-yard-per-carry av
erage.
Previously the lower peninsula
team had edged by Denver 14-13
and then smashed University of
Hawaii 44-1 1 and Fresno State 40-
14. San Jose's two losses came
from two northern independent
schools, Washington State Uni
versity and Oregon.
