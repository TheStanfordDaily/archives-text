Kvrrvl>o<!v\s Having Troubles

My, hul how everybody is optimistic now. Last week, Stanford
had a blundering football team that might just as well hang ii up;
this week, Stanford has its eyes on a 5-5 record. That's quite an
order, when you have to start at 1-3.
We just can't win for losing. The game Stanford played Saturday
in the Coliseum would have been enough to vanquish all but a hand
ful of teams around the nation. But the Trojans were just too big,
too lough and too many. California gets the next shot at Troy, Satin -
day in Berkeley. The San Francisco papers are plastered this week
with the same headlines we saw last week: "We ('an Win." Etc. Cal
hopes to do it with speed, but not passing. Lots of luck.

If you think the football team
is having its troubles, what about
the water polo team? A compara
tive infant to the spoil, Stanford
is now 0-4, 1 believe.
We did scare UCLA Friday,
losing only 10-8.
Water polo isn't exactly a pic
nic. Stop-and-go swimming is
about as strenuous an exercise
as there is. The Indians took on
Cal, an old hand at tho sport,
after about two weeks of practice.
Cal won, 23-5. We were in the
game at 11, but the Bears got
lucky and rang up 20 straight
goals. This "slump" killed us.
Then we scored 13 goals
against San .lose State, but lost,
18-13. This, I would say, is the
highlight of ihe season.
Saturday, it was Southern Cal.
Now, Olympic 100-meter champ
Jon Hendricks of Australia is on
SC's team, as is backstroke ace
Chuck Kittick. This isn't so bad.
But there are also a couple of
Hungarians who were members

of the 1956 Olympic champions thai flow Iho coop to Amcrica as soon
as iho games were over. Really, you see, SC isn't recruiting he
hind the iron curtain. Not yet, anyhow. Or not to my knowledge.
One of the Hungarians was a goaiie and the other a big gun named
Gabor Nagy. Gabor scored 11 goals. What can you do?
Norman Follows Suit
Dick Norman had a tradition to keep up Saturday and he was ;il
most unbelievable in doing.
Stanford passers always go wild against SC in the Coliseum. I
imagine Trojan alums were taken ill when they saw Dick take to
the air Saturday.
Even including Jackie Douglas in 1957, who didn't really need to
pass because the rushing-strong Indians were rolling to a 35-7 victory
over Troy Stanford quarterbacks since 1950 had averaged 15 com
pletions for 209 yards and two touchdowns in Coliseum appearances
against I'SC.
Saturday, Dick Norman had 16 completions, 207 yards, two touch
down.
Year Passer Score l'A l'C Yards TD

1957 Jack Douglas (S 35, SC 7).... 13 8 7!) I
1959 Dick Norman (SC 30, S 28) 32 16 207 2
Ironically, the greatest of all these passing shows was in the Cards'
only post-1950 Coliseum lost to SC (before this year). That was the
game that the Trojans won with 11 seconds to play when Tsad Tsam
Tsagalakis booted a 3N yard field goal.
But Garrett was sort of going it along that day. The Tribe runners
gained only 59 yards to supplement his aerial show.
Yes, They Are Tough
A reliable Southland source < lOd Magee, dad of the Tribe second
baseman, Mike) told us Saturday that it is wise to take SC's "pro
gram weights" with a granule of salt, lie reports that Marlin Mc-
Keever's "21S pounds" is closer to 232. And Mike's "215" is more like
228.
They were all big enough, anyway.
At times, the McKeever boys certainly look like All-Americans.
Both have terrific speed for their size. They also seem to relish in
capacitating opponents. Maybe it's a game of their own.
Mike decided, in the fourth quarter, to incapacitate the Indians'
tough center, Doug Pursell. In the first place, he chose the wrong
man. In the second place, he was caught. It looked for a while like
poor Mike was going to have a tantrum right there on the field.
I'm sure your heart was warmed as mine was to pick up the Sport
ing Green yesterday morning and see the smiling faces of Marlui,
Mike and Clark Hoiden, along with three coeds.
lloldcn looked like an All-American, too. Saturday. I guess that is
sort of an obvious remark, after four TD's.

ful of teams around the nation. But the Trojans were just too big,
too lough and too many. California gets the next shot at Troy, Satin -
day in Berkeley. The San Francisco papers are plastered this week
with the same headlines we saw last week: "We ('an Win." Etc. Cal
hopes to do it with speed, but not passing. Lots of luck.

If you think the football team
is having its troubles, what about
the water polo team? A compara
tive infant to the spoil, Stanford
is now 0-4, 1 believe.
We did scare UCLA Friday,
losing only 10-8.
Water polo isn't exactly a pic
nic. Stop-and-go swimming is
about as strenuous an exercise
as there is. The Indians took on
Cal, an old hand at tho sport,
after about two weeks of practice.
Cal won, 23-5. We were in the
game at 11, but the Bears got
lucky and rang up 20 straight
goals. This "slump" killed us.
Then we scored 13 goals
against San .lose State, but lost,
18-13. This, I would say, is the
highlight of ihe season.
Saturday, it was Southern Cal.
Now, Olympic 100-meter champ
Jon Hendricks of Australia is on
SC's team, as is backstroke ace
Chuck Kittick. This isn't so bad.
But there are also a couple of
Hungarians who were members

of the 1956 Olympic champions thai flow Iho coop to Amcrica as soon
as iho games were over. Really, you see, SC isn't recruiting he
hind the iron curtain. Not yet, anyhow. Or not to my knowledge.
One of the Hungarians was a goaiie and the other a big gun named
Gabor Nagy. Gabor scored 11 goals. What can you do?
Norman Follows Suit
Dick Norman had a tradition to keep up Saturday and he was ;il
most unbelievable in doing.
Stanford passers always go wild against SC in the Coliseum. I
imagine Trojan alums were taken ill when they saw Dick take to
the air Saturday.
Even including Jackie Douglas in 1957, who didn't really need to
pass because the rushing-strong Indians were rolling to a 35-7 victory
over Troy Stanford quarterbacks since 1950 had averaged 15 com
pletions for 209 yards and two touchdowns in Coliseum appearances
against I'SC.
Saturday, Dick Norman had 16 completions, 207 yards, two touch
down.

Ironically, the greatest of all these passing shows was in the Cards'
only post-1950 Coliseum lost to SC (before this year). That was the
game that the Trojans won with 11 seconds to play when Tsad Tsam
Tsagalakis booted a 3N yard field goal.
But Garrett was sort of going it along that day. The Tribe runners
gained only 59 yards to supplement his aerial show.
Yes, They Are Tough
A reliable Southland source < lOd Magee, dad of the Tribe second
baseman, Mike) told us Saturday that it is wise to take SC's "pro
gram weights" with a granule of salt, lie reports that Marlin Mc-
Keever's "21S pounds" is closer to 232. And Mike's "215" is more like
228.
They were all big enough, anyway.
At times, the McKeever boys certainly look like All-Americans.
Both have terrific speed for their size. They also seem to relish in
capacitating opponents. Maybe it's a game of their own.
Mike decided, in the fourth quarter, to incapacitate the Indians'
tough center, Doug Pursell. In the first place, he chose the wrong
man. In the second place, he was caught. It looked for a while like
poor Mike was going to have a tantrum right there on the field.
I'm sure your heart was warmed as mine was to pick up the Sport
ing Green yesterday morning and see the smiling faces of Marlui,
Mike and Clark Hoiden, along with three coeds.
lloldcn looked like an All-American, too. Saturday. I guess that is
sort of an obvious remark, after four TD's.

the water polo team? A compara
tive infant to the spoil, Stanford
is now 0-4, 1 believe.
We did scare UCLA Friday,
losing only 10-8.
Water polo isn't exactly a pic
nic. Stop-and-go swimming is
about as strenuous an exercise
as there is. The Indians took on
Cal, an old hand at tho sport,
after about two weeks of practice.
Cal won, 23-5. We were in the
game at 11, but the Bears got
lucky and rang up 20 straight
goals. This "slump" killed us.
Then we scored 13 goals
against San .lose State, but lost,
18-13. This, I would say, is the
highlight of ihe season.
Saturday, it was Southern Cal.
Now, Olympic 100-meter champ
Jon Hendricks of Australia is on
SC's team, as is backstroke ace
Chuck Kittick. This isn't so bad.
But there are also a couple of
Hungarians who were members

of the 1956 Olympic champions thai flow Iho coop to Amcrica as soon
as iho games were over. Really, you see, SC isn't recruiting he
hind the iron curtain. Not yet, anyhow. Or not to my knowledge.
One of the Hungarians was a goaiie and the other a big gun named
Gabor Nagy. Gabor scored 11 goals. What can you do?
Norman Follows Suit
Dick Norman had a tradition to keep up Saturday and he was ;il
most unbelievable in doing.
Stanford passers always go wild against SC in the Coliseum. I
imagine Trojan alums were taken ill when they saw Dick take to
the air Saturday.
Even including Jackie Douglas in 1957, who didn't really need to
pass because the rushing-strong Indians were rolling to a 35-7 victory
over Troy Stanford quarterbacks since 1950 had averaged 15 com
pletions for 209 yards and two touchdowns in Coliseum appearances
against I'SC.
Saturday, Dick Norman had 16 completions, 207 yards, two touch
down.

Ironically, the greatest of all these passing shows was in the Cards'
only post-1950 Coliseum lost to SC (before this year). That was the
game that the Trojans won with 11 seconds to play when Tsad Tsam
Tsagalakis booted a 3N yard field goal.
But Garrett was sort of going it along that day. The Tribe runners
gained only 59 yards to supplement his aerial show.
Yes, They Are Tough
A reliable Southland source < lOd Magee, dad of the Tribe second
baseman, Mike) told us Saturday that it is wise to take SC's "pro
gram weights" with a granule of salt, lie reports that Marlin Mc-
Keever's "21S pounds" is closer to 232. And Mike's "215" is more like
228.
They were all big enough, anyway.
At times, the McKeever boys certainly look like All-Americans.
Both have terrific speed for their size. They also seem to relish in
capacitating opponents. Maybe it's a game of their own.
Mike decided, in the fourth quarter, to incapacitate the Indians'
tough center, Doug Pursell. In the first place, he chose the wrong
man. In the second place, he was caught. It looked for a while like
poor Mike was going to have a tantrum right there on the field.
I'm sure your heart was warmed as mine was to pick up the Sport
ing Green yesterday morning and see the smiling faces of Marlui,
Mike and Clark Hoiden, along with three coeds.
lloldcn looked like an All-American, too. Saturday. I guess that is
sort of an obvious remark, after four TD's.

had a blundering football team that might just as well hang ii up;
this week, Stanford has its eyes on a 5-5 record. That's quite an
order, when you have to start at 1-3.
We just can't win for losing. The game Stanford played Saturday
in the Coliseum would have been enough to vanquish all but a hand
ful of teams around the nation. But the Trojans were just too big,
too lough and too many. California gets the next shot at Troy, Satin -
day in Berkeley. The San Francisco papers are plastered this week
with the same headlines we saw last week: "We ('an Win." Etc. Cal
hopes to do it with speed, but not passing. Lots of luck.
