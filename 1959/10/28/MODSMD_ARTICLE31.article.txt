# Tribe Guards Improving Fast
## 
### Ken Dery 
Despite Iho absence of a Mike McKeever or a Dan Ficea Stafford
guards have played well ihis season, and seem to be getting better
with each game. With no man weighing over 210 pounds, the guards
have had to tight the problem of size all year, but have managed
to surprise fans and opponents alike.
The most pleasant surprise has been the emergence and develop-

ment of sophomore Tom Walsh.
Considered one ol' the top pros
pects from last year's frosh team,
Walsh has shown signs of his
eagerness to play by gaining a
spot on the starting lineup.
Strong and agressive at 205
pounds, Walsh possesses the
speed and ability to be a top guard
for the next three years. Tom
is from Portland, Oregon, and is
a Civil Engineering major.
Junior Ron Fernandes, one of
the two returning lettermen at
guard, has proven himself an ex
cellent football player in many
ways.
A Sacramento product, Ron had
to sit out the 1957 season because
of an injured knee, after having
starred on the '56 frosh team. He
had trouble finding himself last
season, but really caught fire in
the last four games. The injured
knee has cut down his speed
somewhat) but he still has good
mobility in a limited area.
Hard Working
Considered hard-working, ea
ger, and intelligent by his
coaches, he is heavily counted on.
His lack of size (201 > has been
more than overcome by his gen
eral football sense, ruggedness.
and defensive skill. Ron's major
is Political Science.
Larry Lacey, a junior, trans
ferred to Stanford last year from
Stockton College and was dei
veloping into a very capable j
guard when -in early-season knee!
injury knocked him out of threei
games and limited his play great
ly in two more. A tribute to his;
skill and fortitude is the fact that
he came back to play 33 minutes |
against California.
A knee operation last winter
hampered his progress in spring
practice, but he was expected to
report in good shape in the fall.
Anyone who has been to a Stan- J
ford football game this year cer
tainly knows that Lacey is back
and healthy. Majoring in Politi
cal Science like Fernandes, Larry
is a well - balanced solid player
a good man to have around. His
honr. 1 is Stockton.
Heaviest
Heaviest guard on the squad is'
sophomore Gary Leahy. The 211-.
pounder lias shown good speed.

; and his moves last spring stamped
j him as one to watch. A top guard
on the 1957 freshman team, Gary
just could not crack the varsity
| lineup last year. lie is still de
veloping and maturing, and the
j fact that he has three years of
J competition ahead of him is in
i his favor.
Plis major is International Re
; lations, and he lives in San Fran
j cisco.
Junior Don Peter saw action
in five games last season, but has
| relatively little actual game ex
; perienee. Don played on the
freshman team in 1956, but did
not play football at all in 1957.
Handicapped by lack of real
; speed and si/.e, Peter is a hard
worker who loves to play. Peter
also plays rugby. Majoring in
Physical Education, Don is still
growing and maturing.
Lacks Experience
Sophomore Errol Scott has all
i the tools, but simply lacks the ex
perience Scott, at 209 pounds and
-3*11" is short, stocky, and power
| ful. With his good attitude it is
J 'bought that he could go a long
way. The most important thing
he needs is the confidence that
| £an only he gained from game
competition. He is a Political
i Science major. He also kicks off.
Rounding out the guards are
Norman LaCa/.e, 5'11", 196 pound
junior from Inglewood and Ed
Rothman. Rothman, a sophomore
did not see action last year, but
showed good potential in the
| spring and is improving.
Rothman's home 1 own is San
Francisco and he is majoring in
His ory.
LaCaze is one of four psycho
logy majors that are on this year's
Indian football team.

to surprise fans and opponents alike.
The most pleasant surprise has been the emergence and develop-

ment of sophomore Tom Walsh.
Considered one ol' the top pros
pects from last year's frosh team,
Walsh has shown signs of his
eagerness to play by gaining a
spot on the starting lineup.
Strong and agressive at 205
pounds, Walsh possesses the
speed and ability to be a top guard
for the next three years. Tom
is from Portland, Oregon, and is
a Civil Engineering major.
Junior Ron Fernandes, one of
the two returning lettermen at

cellent football player in many
ways.
A Sacramento product, Ron had
to sit out the 1957 season because
of an injured knee, after having
starred on the '56 frosh team. He
had trouble finding himself last
season, but really caught fire in
the last four games. The injured
knee has cut down his speed
somewhat) but he still has good
mobility in a limited area.

coaches, he is heavily counted on.

Junior Ron Fernandes, one of

ways.
A Sacramento product, Ron had
to sit out the 1957 season because
of an injured knee, after having
starred on the '56 frosh team. He
had trouble finding himself last
season, but really caught fire in
the last four games. The injured
knee has cut down his speed

mobility in a limited area.

guards have played well ihis season, and seem to be getting better
with each game. With no man weighing over 210 pounds, the guards
have had to tight the problem of size all year, but have managed
to surprise fans and opponents alike.
The most pleasant surprise has been the emergence and develop-

Walsh has shown signs of his
