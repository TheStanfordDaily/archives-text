# Added Experience Helpful To 1959 Stanford Boxers
## 
### 
It is often said that experience!
is the best teacher, and if so. the:
Stanford boxing team should
show lots of improvement overj
last season. All but one member I
jof last year's team. Tom Logs
don, will return to action this sea-
I son.
Coach Ray Lunny is extremely
happy over this season's pros-1
poets, saying, "If anything wol
i should be much better." Lunny
j will greet returnees Trev Grimm I
undefeate d heavy weight; Ed
Rothman, another heavy; Talton
I Ray, light-heavy; Hill Vaughoy
ind Bill McDonald, both at 1 he.
1 05 weight, and Jim Tompkins]
! from last year's club.

Along with those experienced
returnees, Lunny will see some
pew faces this year. Dutch Bans
bach, at the 147-pound weight,
who got into the finals of last
year's intramural tourney, will
fill the opening at that spot, j
Bruce Bellows, the winner of the
156-pound class in the intramu
rals, will also be on deck. Two
new lightweights will enter the
picture. Sieve Morris and War-i
ren Keller are both top prospects;
for the 125-pound division. Cece
Bryan will take over the 132-
pound'class for Lunny.
This will be the first season for
the Indians in the new boxing j
conference, which includes San
Jose State, California, Santa
Clara, Chico State, USF, Fresno
State and Stanford. The Califor
nia Collegiate Bo x in g Confer
ence, the CCBC, will hold a con- j
ference tournament at Stanford,
March 24 26.

San Jose State will undoubtedly
be (he team to beat in the new
conference. The Spartans are
noted for their tough boxing
teams, and last year were the
NCAA hoxing champs.
The Spartans defeated a strong
Wisconsin team to gain their na
tional honor.
