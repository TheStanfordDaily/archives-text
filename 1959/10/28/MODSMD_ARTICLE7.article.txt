# Red Hottest Professors Plan 'Yell of the Century'
## 
### Steve Freidberg 
The "Yell of the Century" will
be led Saturday at the San Jose
game by the three red-hottest pro
fessors on the Stanford campus.
These professors, James T.
Watkins IV, Kurt Servos and Jul
ius Shuchat, were accorded this
honor in the "Elect the Red-Hot
Professor" contest held last week
to raise funds for the World Uni
versity Service Drive. Because of
the closeness of the voting it was
decided to have the three highest
vote winners lead the yell instead
of the winner alone, as was origi
nally planned.
'Golden Age'
Watkins said that the nature
of the yell will be kept top secret
until the game. "However," he
stated, "there is much research
being done on the matter and it
will definitely have a historical
basis. We hope to recreate the
Golden Age of Yell Leading. I
am sure the rooting section will
respond with tremendous force."
During the game the tree pro
fessors will sit in front of the
rooting section and will display
their yell-leading talents at the
end of the half-time. Bill Karto
zian, head yell leader, will intro
duce them.
Total â€”$2059.91
As a result of the contest and
the living group donations the
WUS Drive netted $2059.91. The
winner of the sweepstakes as
well as the upper division worn
en's prize was Naranja in Lagu
nita with a total of $101.23, an

Roble won the frosh women's

division with $1.18 per person
by selling cookies to the frosh
men. Rinconada won the Wilbur

Chairman Says Thanks
Pete Knopf, chairman of the
Drive, has asked all groups,
which have not reported or still
have money to turn in, to do so
at the ASSU office. He also
thanked all the students who
helped organize the Drive and
those who supported it.
"The students who receive your
help will appreciate the fact that
you thought about their desper
ate situation and then did some
thing positive to help," he com
mented.
