Artist-in-Residence
The play's author, Miss Scho
chen is currently an artist-in
residence here during the pro
duction of the play. The theme
of the play, violence and how it
can become an end in itself al
though originally used for peace
ful purposes, is one on which she
has been working for some time.
Since Stanford was one of four
theater groups, out of the eigth
participating in the Ford Founda
tion's program, which wanted to
produce "The Moon Besieged," it
was Miss Schochen's decision
that brought the play here.
Richard Hay, set designer for
the Stanford Players, has created
in his settings reflections of the
prevailing atmosphere of the
play.
The first and third acts take
place at Brown's cabin in New
York and have been designed on
the low, horizontal and jagged
line to mirror Brown's own dis
torted world. The second act,
however, which takes place just
before the raid, is designed on a
vertical line to reflect Brown's
high expectations.
Stereophonic Sound
Adding to the pre-Civil War
atmosphere, stereophonic sound
will bring in the voices of young
boys singing camp songs of that
period, and projections of Civil
War scenes will be shown on the
side walls of the auditorium be
tween scenes.
Several Broadway and Holly
wood directors, producers and
actors are expected to attend per
formances of the show, and if re
ceived favorably, the play may go
to New York.
Tickets for reserved seats
priced at $1.25 and $1.75 are on
sale at Memorial Box Office. The
play is scheduled to run through
Saturday this week and from
Nov. 4-7.

Besieged."
One of the eight plays selected
by the Ford Foundation to be pre
sented under its program, the

When asked his opinion of the
play, Cooper, said that he thought
it "a very valid piece of work."
Oliver Brown
Playing the role of Oliver
Brown, the pacifist-tending son of
abolitionist John Brown, Cooper
was selected for the part by the
play's director, A. D. Sensenbach.
Julia Curtis will play Martha,
Oliver's young wife. John Brown,
whose violent fanaticism led the
raid on Harper's Ferry, will be
played by Alvin S. Kaufman.

Artist-in-Residence
The play's author, Miss Scho
chen is currently an artist-in
residence here during the pro
duction of the play. The theme
of the play, violence and how it
can become an end in itself al
though originally used for peace
ful purposes, is one on which she
has been working for some time.
Since Stanford was one of four
theater groups, out of the eigth
participating in the Ford Founda
tion's program, which wanted to
produce "The Moon Besieged," it
was Miss Schochen's decision
that brought the play here.
Richard Hay, set designer for
the Stanford Players, has created
in his settings reflections of the
prevailing atmosphere of the
play.
The first and third acts take
place at Brown's cabin in New
York and have been designed on
the low, horizontal and jagged
line to mirror Brown's own dis
torted world. The second act,
however, which takes place just
before the raid, is designed on a
vertical line to reflect Brown's
high expectations.
Stereophonic Sound
Adding to the pre-Civil War
atmosphere, stereophonic sound
will bring in the voices of young
boys singing camp songs of that
period, and projections of Civil
War scenes will be shown on the
side walls of the auditorium be
tween scenes.
Several Broadway and Holly
wood directors, producers and
actors are expected to attend per
formances of the show, and if re
ceived favorably, the play may go
to New York.
Tickets for reserved seats
priced at $1.25 and $1.75 are on
sale at Memorial Box Office. The
play is scheduled to run through
Saturday this week and from
Nov. 4-7.
