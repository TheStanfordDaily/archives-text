# PANELISTS AGREE
## Medical System Future Uncertain 
### Jerry Rankin 
American's medical profession
is in the midst of a change, but
whether it will operate under the
present free enterprise system or
become socialized is still un
decided, a panel of three local
experts said last night.
The discussion of the merits of
socialized and free enterprise
medical service came before an
audience of 150 at the Physics
Lecture Hall.
Two of the panelists, Dr.
Charles Gardipee and Arnold
Rogow, said that large segments
of the American population are
being priced out of medical serv
ice because of steadily spiraling
medical costs.
Stanford Instructors
Gardipee is with the California
State Health Department and is
a part-time instructor at Stan
ford. Rogow is a University politi
cal science instructor.
Rogow, pointing out the
steeply rising medical costs and
inability of medical insurance
plans to completely cover medical
costs, held that the only practical
solution is government subsida
tion of medicine.
Dr. Russel Lee, executive head
of the Palo Alto Medical Clinic,
responded to Rogow by noting
that while the United States is
the only large country without
some form of socialized medicine,
it has probably the best health
conditions in the world.
Poor Risks
Rogow said that since elderly
people are on a fixed income and
are regarded as the poorest health
risks by insurance companies,
they are being priced; out of the
medical service field.
He scored the American Medi
cal Association for its attitude in

fighting a badly needed increase
in doctors, federal grants to
needy rural areas and obstructing
admission of students to medical
schools.
Lee said the free enterprise
medical system is responsible for
the 72-year life span we can ex
pect.
Government Influence
He said government influence
in medicine would lead to much
poorer service because of red
tape. He claimed that the vital
feeling of responsibility a doctor
feels for his patient would be
greatly diminished by socialized
medicine.
He proposed a plan whereby a
community would have its own
hospital, with the member paying
dues and receiving all needed
medical service.

being priced out of medical serv
ice because of steadily spiraling
medical costs.
Stanford Instructors
Gardipee is with the California
State Health Department and is
a part-time instructor at Stan
ford. Rogow is a University politi
cal science instructor.
Rogow, pointing out the
steeply rising medical costs and
inability of medical insurance
plans to completely cover medical
costs, held that the only practical
solution is government subsida
tion of medicine.
Dr. Russel Lee, executive head
of the Palo Alto Medical Clinic,
responded to Rogow by noting
that while the United States is
the only large country without
some form of socialized medicine,
it has probably the best health
conditions in the world.
Poor Risks
Rogow said that since elderly
people are on a fixed income and
are regarded as the poorest health
risks by insurance companies,
they are being priced; out of the
medical service field.
He scored the American Medi
cal Association for its attitude in

fighting a badly needed increase
in doctors, federal grants to
needy rural areas and obstructing
admission of students to medical
schools.
Lee said the free enterprise
medical system is responsible for
the 72-year life span we can ex
pect.
Government Influence
He said government influence
in medicine would lead to much
poorer service because of red
tape. He claimed that the vital
feeling of responsibility a doctor
feels for his patient would be
greatly diminished by socialized
medicine.
He proposed a plan whereby a
community would have its own
hospital, with the member paying
dues and receiving all needed
medical service.
American's medical profession
is in the midst of a change, but
whether it will operate under the
present free enterprise system or
become socialized is still un
decided, a panel of three local
experts said last night.
The discussion of the merits of
socialized and free enterprise
medical service came before an
audience of 150 at the Physics
Lecture Hall.
Two of the panelists, Dr.
Charles Gardipee and Arnold
Rogow, said that large segments
of the American population are
being priced out of medical serv
ice because of steadily spiraling
medical costs.
