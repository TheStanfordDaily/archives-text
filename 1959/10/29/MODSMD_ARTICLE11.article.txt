# Ideology Shift In USSR Noted
## 
### Bob Frank 
The revolutionary ideology no
longer interests the Russian peo
ple, political science teaching as
sistant Peter Grothe told a Po
litical Union audience yesterday.
Russians are more interested
in the future of their country and
in improved living conditions
than in Co rn munist ideals, he
said.
In a trip to Russia and satel
lite countries last summer, Gro
the found the Russians more cu
rious about the United States
than antagonistic.
Khruslichcv Visit
The American Exhibition and
the recent Khrushchev visit to
this country have created an op
portunity for American propa
ganda, he said.
Grothe urged Americans to
travel to Russia and the East Eu
ropean satellites to tell Commu
nists what they don't know about
America anti-trust laws, social
security, public education, pro
gressive income tax, integration
progress.
Goods Scarce
In most Communist countries
resentment against the govern
ment stems from the scarcity of
consumer goods, Grothe said, but
living standards are improving,
and American propaganda should
emphasize our freedom rather
than living conditions.
Seven times lasl summer poo
pic Grothe had made appoint
ments with to talk a bo u t the
United States did not keep their
appointments. When fear of the
government keeps people from
meeting their friends, said Gro
the, freedom can be a telling
propaganda issue.
