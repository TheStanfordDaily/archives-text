### 
VVASI lINGTON (/I s )â€”President
Eisenhower disclosed yesterday
that all major Western leaders.
French Pr e sident Charles do
Gaulle included, have agreed to
hold a Western summit confer
once within the next few months.
De Gaulle evidently is calling
the turn on timing. He also ap
parently is going to get his way
about putting off until sometime
next spring a subsequent East-
West summit conference with So
viet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.
The Western session may take
place before the end of the year,
perhaps in Paris. Eisenhower said
the time and place remain to be
worked out.
