Television has been caught
perpetrating a fraud which is so
gigantic that it calls into question
the foundations of the industry.
The fraud was not the work
of a few cheats who had
wormed their way into the com
pany of honest men. The fraud
was too big, too extensive, too
well organized to he cured or
atoned for by throwing a few
conspicuous individuals to the
wolves, and by putting on a
pious show of scrupulosity
about the details of the produc
tions.
There has been, in fact, an
enormous conspiracy to deceive
the public in order to sell prof
itable advertising to the sponsors.
It involves not merely this in
dividual or that, but the industry
as a whole.
This is the judgment of the
leading professional critics of
television on both the "New York
Herald Tribune" and the "New
York Times." Mr. John Crosby
has said that the "moral squalor
of the quiz mess reaches clear
through the whole industry."
Mr. Jack Gould has said that
the fraud could not have been
carried out without "the con
stant involvement of represent
atives of networks, advertising
agencies, and sponsors."
The size of the fraud is a bitter
reflection on the moral condition
of our society. But it is also sure
proof that there is something
radically wrong with the funda
mental national policy under
which television operates.
The principle of that policy is
that for all practical purposes
television shall be operated
wholly for private profit. There
is no competition in television
except among competitors trying
to sell the attention of their
audiences for profit. As a result,
while television is supposed to be
"free," it has in fact become the
creature, the servant, and indeed
the prostitute, of merchandizing.
According to "Newsweek,"
the television networks decided
about a year ago that in the
coming season, during the
prime evening hours which
draw the biggest audiences,
they would devote to violence
a total of twenty-four hours a
week.
What to do about it? The great
offense of the television industry

is that it is misusing a superb
scientific achievement, that it is
monopolizing the air at the ex
pense of effective news reporting,
good art, and civilized entertain
ment.
The crux of the evil is that
in seeking great mass audi
ences, the industry has decided
from its experience that the
taste of great masses is a low
one, and that to succeed in the
competition it must pander to
this low taste.
Quite evidently, this is an evil
which cannot be remedied by a
regulating commission or by some
form of government or self-con
stituted censorship. The alterna
tive, which is practiced in one
form or another in almost every
other civilized country, is com
petition â€” competition not for
private profit but for public serv
ice.
The best line for us to take is, I
am convinced, to devise a way by
which one network can be run as
a public service with its criterion
not what will he most popular but
what is good.
No doubt, this network would
not attract the largest mass
audience. But: if it enlisted the
great talents which are avail
able in the Industry, but are
now throttled and frustrated, it
might well attract an audience
which made up in influence
what it lacked in numbers. The
force of a good example is a
great force, and should not be
underrated.
They are unwise friends of
our system of private capital
ism who do not recognize the
fact that the higher life of our
society depends on respect for
and support of non-commercial
institutions. It is true that the
best way for this country to
produce wealth is by private
enterprise for private profit.
But there are a lot of other
things that need to be done be
sides producing wealth and sell
ing goods. One of them is to in
form, instruct, and entertain the
people through the media of mass
communications.
And among these media there
must be some which aim not at
popularity and profit but at ex
cellence and the good life.
