As things now stand, Southern
California's Trojans — the best
football team on the Coast—will
not get a chance to play in the
Pasadena New Year's classic.
An NCAA penalty for viola
lion of the Association's athletic
code prohibits the Trojans from
playing in any post-season spec
tacular until Jan. (5, 1960 —when
there aren't any, for another
year at least.
But the news in the air is that
Southern California will appeal
the NCAA restriction, and the
speculation is that their appeal
will be granted and the thunder
ing herd from Troy will be re
warded for its gridiron efforts.
This writer would like nothing
more than to see a strong Coast
team in the Rose Bowl. I would
rejoice in the prospect that a
former PCC or current AAWU
member stood a better than even
chance of coming home from
Pasadena a winner.
But 1 don't think that school
should be I lie University of
Southern California in 1960 —
powerhouse or not.
I harbor no bitterness toward
the Trojans because of their win
over the Indians last weekend or
because of the rough-edged rela
tions which Stanford has had
with SC in recent years.
This week my thoughts run on
some type of high moral, ethical,
for-the - good - of - Coast - football
plain.
I am trying to think ahead
toward the future of football
here on the West C oast. And
as long as the AAVVIJ appears
to be the going: thing, I'm
anxious to see it keep the
stature if is capable of keeping.
This, of course, means that the
five clubs in the conference musl
learn to abide by its specific rules
and regulations and must, of

course, abide by those of the
NCAA.
And, in my book, there is no
greater way to have the serious
ness of breaking a rule impressed
upon one's mind than to level a
stiff penalty, and then sit on it
down to the wire.
In other words: What could
make a better impression on
tire mind of the onee-a-law
breaker Trojans than to have
to sit out fids campaign's Rose
Bowl knowing full well that
they had about the best chance
in the West of winning it.

TALKING ABOUT BOOKS:
Although this doesn't concern me
as much as it will some of you (I
don't have time to read outside,
"just for fun or enjoyment" books
until vacations come 'round),
here's something to look for.
The David McKay Co. has just
released Nikolai Khokhlov's "In
j the Name of Conscience" with
some of the most interesting spot
reading I have ever done. Am
now looking forward to a full
length vacation so I can full
length the book.
Khokhlov is a former Com
munist espionage agent who
joined the Russian secret serv
ice during World War !l to help
the country he loved. What hap
pened when he tried to ease out
of it, and what bus happened to
him since produce an exciting
story with a great deal of im
pact.
The former secret agent is now
convinced that forces everywhere
are at work against the political
system we call Communism; he
firmly believes that the Russian
people, who have already over
thrown it as a "philosophy," will
eventually overcome it as a politi
cal state.
