Twice Disturbed
Editor, The Daily:
I am disturbed by the two
letters which appeared in The
Daily on Tuesday by Tom .Reilly
and Dave Long. Both letters con
cerned the fast by University of
California freshman Frederick
Moore in protest of the school's
policy of compulsory ROTC. •
Mr. Reilly's letter revealed an
obvious lack of knowledge of the
facts concerning the case and a
failure to understand Moore's
motive for his action. First, I
must remind Mr. Reilly that Fred
erick Moore is a legal resident of
the state of California and there
by has a specific interest in the
state's educational system.
His "immature act" gained the
immediate endorsement of the
Associated Students at Cal and
over 1000 individual students
signed his petition. An over
whelming majority of • Cal stu
dents went on record over two
years ago in favor of voluntary
ROTC.
In the light of those facts I
fail to see how Mr. Reilly can
compare Moore's protest to a

"religious sect" trying to "eon
vert the school to their personal
ethic." I feel that Moore shoidd
be congratulated for his un
equivocal stand in contrast to the
hyprocrisy of many modern lead
ers to whom Mr. Reilly alludes.
May I suggest to Mr. Reilly
that if he does not have a gen
uine "fear of the nuclear con
sequences of war," whether in
tellectual or emotional, he is just
not aware of the tragic situation
confronting the world today.
Mr. Long's letter represents
the epitome of the sarcasm on
which both writers seem to de
pend in their arguments. His
language mocks a much more
mature and serious attempt by
Frederick Moore to witness for
his convictions.
Mr. Long's attempted analogy
makes one very dangerous pre
supposition. The entiie anecdole
implies that compulsory ROTC
is as integral a part of higher edu
cation as scholastic examinations.
Fortunately, most modern edu- j
cators would not agree.
I am pleased to see that this
issue has aroused some public

concern at Stanford and that The
Daily has taken a stand in the
editorial column. I look forward
to the day when more men have
the mature moral concern for
their society that Frederick
Moore has demonstrated.

makes one very dangerous pre
supposition. The entiie anecdole
implies that compulsory ROTC
is as integral a part of higher edu
cation as scholastic examinations.
Fortunately, most modern edu- j
cators would not agree.
I am pleased to see that this
issue has aroused some public

concern at Stanford and that The
Daily has taken a stand in the
editorial column. I look forward
to the day when more men have
the mature moral concern for
their society that Frederick
Moore has demonstrated.
Gary Green
Twice Disturbed
Editor, The Daily:
I am disturbed by the two
letters which appeared in The
Daily on Tuesday by Tom .Reilly
and Dave Long. Both letters con
cerned the fast by University of
California freshman Frederick
Moore in protest of the school's
policy of compulsory ROTC. •
Mr. Reilly's letter revealed an
obvious lack of knowledge of the
facts concerning the case and a
failure to understand Moore's
motive for his action. First, I
must remind Mr. Reilly that Fred
erick Moore is a legal resident of
the state of California and there
by has a specific interest in the
state's educational system.
His "immature act" gained the
immediate endorsement of the
Associated Students at Cal and
over 1000 individual students
signed his petition. An over
whelming majority of • Cal stu
dents went on record over two
years ago in favor of voluntary
ROTC.
In the light of those facts I
fail to see how Mr. Reilly can
compare Moore's protest to a

"religious sect" trying to "eon
vert the school to their personal
ethic." I feel that Moore shoidd
be congratulated for his un
equivocal stand in contrast to the
hyprocrisy of many modern lead
ers to whom Mr. Reilly alludes.
May I suggest to Mr. Reilly
that if he does not have a gen
uine "fear of the nuclear con
sequences of war," whether in
tellectual or emotional, he is just
not aware of the tragic situation
confronting the world today.
Mr. Long's letter represents
the epitome of the sarcasm on
which both writers seem to de
pend in their arguments. His
language mocks a much more
mature and serious attempt by
Frederick Moore to witness for
his convictions.
Mr. Long's attempted analogy
makes one very dangerous pre
supposition. The entiie anecdole
implies that compulsory ROTC
is as integral a part of higher edu
cation as scholastic examinations.

cators would not agree.
