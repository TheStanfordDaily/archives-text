Clarification
fulifnr, The Daily:
Having been one of those who
signed the letter of the foreign
students of Monday's Daily issue,
I would like to clarify and modify
my position.
I feel the establishment of an
independent column for foreign
students is a very good and con
structive idea; as a matter of fact,
this proposal was originally sug
gested to us by some American
si udents.
However, I do have a reserva
tion as regards the practicality
and feasibility of have a foreign
editor. How are we going to pick
a foreign editor? After all, to a
Japanese for instance, an Arab
editor is as foreign as an Ameri
can editor, and certainly more
foreign to an Israeli.
Should our American friends
agree with us on the principle of
establishing the regular outlet
for foreign student opinion, why
not appoint an independent Amer
ican editor who would edit the
column in collaboration with the
office of the Foreign Student Ad
viser.

Sufficient Reason
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Reilly is "amazed" that any
one should come all the way from
Virginia to attend school in Cal
ifornia, when that school had
"basic tenents" (sic) inimical to
the dictates of his consicence.
The University of California is,
by general consent, one of the na
tion's finest universities. It is
also the university of the State
of which Frederick Moore is a
citizen. These I should have
thought sufficient reasons for a
journey from Virginia. That Mr.
Moore should have been deprived
of these advantages on the basis
of his conscientious beliefs is
oppressive and discriminatory.

Mr. Reilly rails Monro's action
"immature." This advances the
argument little further than to
say he disapproves of lhe action.
I think Mr. Moore acted with ex
traordinary maturity and cour
age, which means 1 approve of
his action.
Mr. Reilly is, it appears, "a
pacifist, RUT .. ." . . BUT not
a pacifist" I presume he would
continue. A subtle exercise in
gobbledygook. He gives his ap
proval to "intellectual disgust for
war" but condemns "emotional
fear of the nuclear consequences
of war."
The extent to which "disgust"
and repulsion at "the horrors
and moral significance of war"
are intellectual rather than emo
tional involves a distinction too
subtle for me to follow.
I am against the devotion of
the total energies of our society
toward the annihilation of a sub
stantial part of the human race.
If this attitude is "emotional,"
so be it. Mr. Moore has taken an
unconditional stand for peace.
Too many people, while stoutly
maintaining they are for peace,
BUT. .*â€¢ . , are content to ride
on the train to total war and total
destruction.
