LANGUAGE MADE SIMPLE: NO. 1
In this day of swift international communications, like radio,
television, and the raft, it becomes more and more important
to be solidly grounded in foreign languages. Accordingly, I
have asked the makers of Philip Morris whether I might not
occasionally forego levity in this column and instead use it for
a lesson in language.
"Of course, silly!" chuckled the makers of Philip Morris,
tousling my yellow locks. Oh, grand men they are, just as full
of natural goodness as the cigarettes they make, just as clean
and fresh, just as friendly, just as agreeable to have along in
all times and climes and places. "Of course, fond boy,'' laughed
the makers and tossed me up and down in a blanket until, giddy
with giggling, I bade them desist, and then we all had basins
of farina and smoked Philip Morrises and sang songs until the
campfire had turned to embers.
For our first lesson in language we will take up French. We
will approach French in the modern manner—ignoring the
tedious rules of grammar and concentrating instead on idiom.
After all, when we go to France, what does it matter if we can
parse and conjugate? What matters is that we should be able
to speak idiomatic conversational French.
£o, for the first exercise, translate the following real, 1 rue-to
life dialogue between two real, truc-to-life Frenchmen named
Claude (pronounced Clohd) and Pierre (also pronounced Clohd).

CLAUDE: Cood morning, sir. Can you direct, mn to 1 lio
nearest monk?
PIERRE: T have regret, but T am a stranger here myself.
CLAUDE: Is it that you come from the France?
PIERRE: You have right.
CLAUDE: T :ilso. Come, let us mount the airplane and return
ourselves to the France.
PIERRE: We must defend from smoking until the airplane
elevates itself.
CLAUDE: Ah, now it has elevated itself. Will you have a
Philippe Maurice?
PIERRE: Mercy.
CLAUDE: How many years has the small gray cat of the
sick admiral?
PIERRE: She has four years, hut the tall brown dog of the
short blacksmith has only three.
CLAUDE: In the garden of my aunt it makes warm in the
summer and cold in the winter.
PIERRE: What a coincidence! Tn the garden of my aunt too!
CLAUDE: Ah, we arc landing. Regard how the airplane
depresses itself.
P.IERRE: What shall you do in the France?
CLAUDE: I shall make a promenade and see various sights
of cultural significance, like the Louvre, the Tomb of Napoleon,
and the Eiffel Tower ... What shall you do?
PIERRE: I shall try to pick up the stewardess.
CLAUDE: Long live the Francc! (112 1959 Affix Shulmits

LANGUAGE MADE SIMPLE: NO. 1
In this day of swift international communications, like radio,
television, and the raft, it becomes more and more important
to be solidly grounded in foreign languages. Accordingly, I
have asked the makers of Philip Morris whether I might not
occasionally forego levity in this column and instead use it for
a lesson in language.
"Of course, silly!" chuckled the makers of Philip Morris,
tousling my yellow locks. Oh, grand men they are, just as full
of natural goodness as the cigarettes they make, just as clean
and fresh, just as friendly, just as agreeable to have along in
all times and climes and places. "Of course, fond boy,'' laughed
the makers and tossed me up and down in a blanket until, giddy
with giggling, I bade them desist, and then we all had basins
of farina and smoked Philip Morrises and sang songs until the
campfire had turned to embers.
For our first lesson in language we will take up French. We
will approach French in the modern manner—ignoring the
tedious rules of grammar and concentrating instead on idiom.
After all, when we go to France, what does it matter if we can
parse and conjugate? What matters is that we should be able
to speak idiomatic conversational French.
£o, for the first exercise, translate the following real, 1 rue-to
life dialogue between two real, truc-to-life Frenchmen named
Claude (pronounced Clohd) and Pierre (also pronounced Clohd).

CLAUDE: Cood morning, sir. Can you direct, mn to 1 lio
nearest monk?
PIERRE: T have regret, but T am a stranger here myself.
CLAUDE: Is it that you come from the France?
PIERRE: You have right.
CLAUDE: T :ilso. Come, let us mount the airplane and return
ourselves to the France.
PIERRE: We must defend from smoking until the airplane
elevates itself.
CLAUDE: Ah, now it has elevated itself. Will you have a
Philippe Maurice?
PIERRE: Mercy.
CLAUDE: How many years has the small gray cat of the
sick admiral?
PIERRE: She has four years, hut the tall brown dog of the
short blacksmith has only three.
CLAUDE: In the garden of my aunt it makes warm in the
summer and cold in the winter.
PIERRE: What a coincidence! Tn the garden of my aunt too!
CLAUDE: Ah, we arc landing. Regard how the airplane
depresses itself.
