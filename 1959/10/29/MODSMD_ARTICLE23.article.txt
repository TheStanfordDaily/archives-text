Bowl Contenders
With Washington having dumped Oregon last weekend in what
appeared to be the battle for the Rose Bowl, and Mississippi and
I-SU squaring off in what should be the Sugar Howl decider this
week, it doesn't seem too premature to look around the country at
the various bowl contenders.
This year in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, a new bowl game will
be played for the first time, the Tobacco Bowl. Four teams as of
now stand as the favorites to initiate this newest of bowl games come
January 1.
The loading contender for the host school spot in the game ap
peals to be the winner of last year's (ligar Bowl, the Webster Queens
men. So far this year the Queensmen have been riding on a cloud of
smoke through their first five games.

Dutch Masters, atheltic director
and coach of the Queensmen lays
most of his team's success to the
vast recruiting job done by his
alumni group.
Center Prima Dora was re
cruited all the way from Italy,
big left tackle White Owl is a
product of an Arizona Indian res
ervation, and right end Robert
Burns came over from Scotland
in play.
The rest of the Queensmen's
starting eleven are mostly local
products. Roy Tan, speedy half
back, has run rings around op
ponents this year, Red Dot is in
at fullback, Phil Blunt and Wil
liam Penn are the guards, Phil
Panatella supplements Owl at
tackle, L Producto is the quarter
back, Van Dyck is a left end, and
from Walla Walla playing flank
er back is Corona Corona. Per
fecto Garcia understudies Pro
ducto.
The Queensmen's leading oppo
nent for the host spot is Virginia

I,&M from Newport. The other day I was out to see the Cavaliers'
coach "Old" Gold, and I think his words adequately summarized the
style of play the Cavaliers have shown this year, "It's what's up
front that counts," offered Gold. "If we haven't got it there we
haven't got it."
And it's not to hard to imagine after hearing these words that the
Cavaliers have the best line in the nation.
The line is lead by captain Paul Maul at tackle and "Fat" Ima at
guard. The rest of the line shows plenty of thinking men including
Herb Tareylon and Chester Field at ends, O. Asis at guard, Walter
Raleigh playing tackle, and a tough man on roll outs, center Bull
Durham.
The backfield is highlighted by a newcomer, fullback AI Pine. Pine
is in the backfield with two veterans "Lucky" Strike and Phil Morris.
1). Maurier, son of the famous financier, is at quarterback.
Early this year the Cavaliers almost had to close down school
due lo a cancer scare but they managed to group together and filter
out the infectuous sector. Actually this left them with only two weeks
lo get in shape for their first tilt with Maxwell House's Percolators
from Silex U. They said it couldn't be done, but "Old" Gold's men
did a king size job and were overwhelming winners.
Vying for the visitors spot in the Tobacco Bowl are two other
teams.
Canadian (lliih
The first of these and favorite as of now is a Canadian club led
by the Walker brothers, Johnny and Hiram. The Canadians' coach
and athletic director, the old granddad of the game, is "Old" Taylor.
Canadian line has shown so much in the spirit department this year
that it prompted Harold Express, Canada's leading sportswriter, to
nickname the upfronters "the Seagram's Seven."
The Walker brothers play halfback and fullback on the team with
Don Cue at quarterback and Jack Daniels at the other halfback. King
George VI is the fifth in the backfield Canadian rules call for five
backs.
The Canadian line features a half pint at guard in Gordon Dis
tilled, but the rest of the line is quart sized. Two foreigners,
Wolf Schmidt and "Smearing" Off, are the tackles, Early Times is at
guard, Jim Beam at center, and "Sonny" Brook and "Red Label are
ihe ends.
The Canadians also feature a strong bench with I. W. Harper, kick
specialist, and Cal Vert, a reserve.
The Canadians up 'til now have relied on one play as their big
ground gainer, and have labeled it Vat <W. It was a good enough play
to can Bud Weiser's Bnrgemeisters despite the fact that the Burge
meisters oriental import Carl lug scored often. Experts thought Bud
Weiser had too many horses.
Making it tough for the Canadians to get the coveted bid is a
powerhouse team from Hershey, Pennsylvania.
Dean of the Coaches
The Hershey team is coached by the highly respected dean of the
nation's coaches, Mr. Goodbar.
"Mountain" Bar is the light tackle on the Hershey Confectioners
and is the sweetest thing that's happened to his school in years. Team
ing with Bar in the line are a couple of guards that rarely melt. Baby
Ruth and "Milky" Weigh, and center "Big" Hunk. AI Mondjoy is the
other tackle. At ends are Butter Finger and O.Henry. The backfield
consists of Whitman Sampler at quarterback and Mac Farlane at
halfback. Both came to Hershey in a package deal, ( buck lies is at
fullback, and Peter Paul at the other halfback. QB Sampler gives
variety to ihe attack.
The Hershey squad always brings with it a whole paj-ty of at
taches including pom pom girls Tootsie Roll and Lolly Pop, and water
boys Cal Sew, and AI lfambra. Their trainer, one of the best around,
is Ben Gay
The confectioners can thank the work of "Pop" Corn and "Sugar"
Daddy, the leading alums, for helping assemble this year's club.
The Tobacco Bowl game itself should become quite a traditional.
University President Lines has already accepted an invitation to
throw out the first ball, and will bring his wife Grace and son Mai son.
Four officials noted for running a clean game have been con
tacted including Dutch Cleanser, A. Jacks, Mr. ( lean and the only
official that can shake hands with all four co-captains at the same
lime, Handy Andy.

front that counts," offered Gold. "If we haven't got it there we
haven't got it."
And it's not to hard to imagine after hearing these words that the
Cavaliers have the best line in the nation.
The line is lead by captain Paul Maul at tackle and "Fat" Ima at
guard. The rest of the line shows plenty of thinking men including
Herb Tareylon and Chester Field at ends, O. Asis at guard, Walter
Raleigh playing tackle, and a tough man on roll outs, center Bull
Durham.
The backfield is highlighted by a newcomer, fullback AI Pine. Pine
is in the backfield with two veterans "Lucky" Strike and Phil Morris.
1). Maurier, son of the famous financier, is at quarterback.
Early this year the Cavaliers almost had to close down school
due lo a cancer scare but they managed to group together and filter
out the infectuous sector. Actually this left them with only two weeks
lo get in shape for their first tilt with Maxwell House's Percolators
from Silex U. They said it couldn't be done, but "Old" Gold's men
did a king size job and were overwhelming winners.
Vying for the visitors spot in the Tobacco Bowl are two other
teams.
Canadian (lliih
The first of these and favorite as of now is a Canadian club led
by the Walker brothers, Johnny and Hiram. The Canadians' coach
and athletic director, the old granddad of the game, is "Old" Taylor.
Canadian line has shown so much in the spirit department this year
that it prompted Harold Express, Canada's leading sportswriter, to
nickname the upfronters "the Seagram's Seven."
The Walker brothers play halfback and fullback on the team with
Don Cue at quarterback and Jack Daniels at the other halfback. King
George VI is the fifth in the backfield Canadian rules call for five
backs.
The Canadian line features a half pint at guard in Gordon Dis
tilled, but the rest of the line is quart sized. Two foreigners,
Wolf Schmidt and "Smearing" Off, are the tackles, Early Times is at
guard, Jim Beam at center, and "Sonny" Brook and "Red Label are
ihe ends.
The Canadians also feature a strong bench with I. W. Harper, kick
specialist, and Cal Vert, a reserve.
The Canadians up 'til now have relied on one play as their big
ground gainer, and have labeled it Vat <W. It was a good enough play
to can Bud Weiser's Bnrgemeisters despite the fact that the Burge
meisters oriental import Carl lug scored often. Experts thought Bud
Weiser had too many horses.
Making it tough for the Canadians to get the coveted bid is a
powerhouse team from Hershey, Pennsylvania.
Dean of the Coaches
The Hershey team is coached by the highly respected dean of the
nation's coaches, Mr. Goodbar.
"Mountain" Bar is the light tackle on the Hershey Confectioners
and is the sweetest thing that's happened to his school in years. Team
ing with Bar in the line are a couple of guards that rarely melt. Baby
Ruth and "Milky" Weigh, and center "Big" Hunk. AI Mondjoy is the
other tackle. At ends are Butter Finger and O.Henry. The backfield
consists of Whitman Sampler at quarterback and Mac Farlane at
halfback. Both came to Hershey in a package deal, ( buck lies is at
fullback, and Peter Paul at the other halfback. QB Sampler gives
variety to ihe attack.
The Hershey squad always brings with it a whole paj-ty of at
taches including pom pom girls Tootsie Roll and Lolly Pop, and water
boys Cal Sew, and AI lfambra. Their trainer, one of the best around,
is Ben Gay
The confectioners can thank the work of "Pop" Corn and "Sugar"
Daddy, the leading alums, for helping assemble this year's club.
The Tobacco Bowl game itself should become quite a traditional.
University President Lines has already accepted an invitation to
throw out the first ball, and will bring his wife Grace and son Mai son.
Four officials noted for running a clean game have been con
tacted including Dutch Cleanser, A. Jacks, Mr. ( lean and the only
official that can shake hands with all four co-captains at the same
lime, Handy Andy.

With Washington having dumped Oregon last weekend in what
appeared to be the battle for the Rose Bowl, and Mississippi and
I-SU squaring off in what should be the Sugar Howl decider this
week, it doesn't seem too premature to look around the country at
the various bowl contenders.
This year in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, a new bowl game will
be played for the first time, the Tobacco Bowl. Four teams as of
now stand as the favorites to initiate this newest of bowl games come
January 1.
The loading contender for the host school spot in the game ap
peals to be the winner of last year's (ligar Bowl, the Webster Queens
men. So far this year the Queensmen have been riding on a cloud of
smoke through their first five games.

Center Prima Dora was re

at fullback, Phil Blunt and Wil

Dean of the Coaches
The Hershey team is coached by the highly respected dean of the
nation's coaches, Mr. Goodbar.
"Mountain" Bar is the light tackle on the Hershey Confectioners
and is the sweetest thing that's happened to his school in years. Team
ing with Bar in the line are a couple of guards that rarely melt. Baby
Ruth and "Milky" Weigh, and center "Big" Hunk. AI Mondjoy is the
other tackle. At ends are Butter Finger and O.Henry. The backfield
consists of Whitman Sampler at quarterback and Mac Farlane at
halfback. Both came to Hershey in a package deal, ( buck lies is at
fullback, and Peter Paul at the other halfback. QB Sampler gives
variety to ihe attack.
The Hershey squad always brings with it a whole paj-ty of at
taches including pom pom girls Tootsie Roll and Lolly Pop, and water
boys Cal Sew, and AI lfambra. Their trainer, one of the best around,
is Ben Gay
The confectioners can thank the work of "Pop" Corn and "Sugar"
Daddy, the leading alums, for helping assemble this year's club.
The Tobacco Bowl game itself should become quite a traditional.
University President Lines has already accepted an invitation to
throw out the first ball, and will bring his wife Grace and son Mai son.
Four officials noted for running a clean game have been con

Bowl Contenders
With Washington having dumped Oregon last weekend in what
appeared to be the battle for the Rose Bowl, and Mississippi and
I-SU squaring off in what should be the Sugar Howl decider this
week, it doesn't seem too premature to look around the country at
the various bowl contenders.
This year in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, a new bowl game will
be played for the first time, the Tobacco Bowl. Four teams as of
now stand as the favorites to initiate this newest of bowl games come
January 1.
The loading contender for the host school spot in the game ap
peals to be the winner of last year's (ligar Bowl, the Webster Queens
men. So far this year the Queensmen have been riding on a cloud of
smoke through their first five games.

Dutch Masters, atheltic director
and coach of the Queensmen lays
most of his team's success to the
vast recruiting job done by his
alumni group.
Center Prima Dora was re
cruited all the way from Italy,
big left tackle White Owl is a
product of an Arizona Indian res
ervation, and right end Robert
Burns came over from Scotland
in play.
The rest of the Queensmen's
starting eleven are mostly local
products. Roy Tan, speedy half
back, has run rings around op
ponents this year, Red Dot is in
at fullback, Phil Blunt and Wil
liam Penn are the guards, Phil
Panatella supplements Owl at
tackle, L Producto is the quarter
back, Van Dyck is a left end, and
from Walla Walla playing flank
er back is Corona Corona. Per
fecto Garcia understudies Pro
ducto.
The Queensmen's leading oppo
nent for the host spot is Virginia

I,&M from Newport. The other day I was out to see the Cavaliers'
coach "Old" Gold, and I think his words adequately summarized the
style of play the Cavaliers have shown this year, "It's what's up
front that counts," offered Gold. "If we haven't got it there we
haven't got it."
And it's not to hard to imagine after hearing these words that the
Cavaliers have the best line in the nation.
The line is lead by captain Paul Maul at tackle and "Fat" Ima at
guard. The rest of the line shows plenty of thinking men including
Herb Tareylon and Chester Field at ends, O. Asis at guard, Walter
Raleigh playing tackle, and a tough man on roll outs, center Bull
Durham.
The backfield is highlighted by a newcomer, fullback AI Pine. Pine
is in the backfield with two veterans "Lucky" Strike and Phil Morris.
1). Maurier, son of the famous financier, is at quarterback.
Early this year the Cavaliers almost had to close down school
due lo a cancer scare but they managed to group together and filter
out the infectuous sector. Actually this left them with only two weeks
lo get in shape for their first tilt with Maxwell House's Percolators
from Silex U. They said it couldn't be done, but "Old" Gold's men
did a king size job and were overwhelming winners.
Vying for the visitors spot in the Tobacco Bowl are two other
teams.

The first of these and favorite as of now is a Canadian club led
by the Walker brothers, Johnny and Hiram. The Canadians' coach
and athletic director, the old granddad of the game, is "Old" Taylor.
Canadian line has shown so much in the spirit department this year
that it prompted Harold Express, Canada's leading sportswriter, to
nickname the upfronters "the Seagram's Seven."
The Walker brothers play halfback and fullback on the team with
Don Cue at quarterback and Jack Daniels at the other halfback. King

Bowl Contenders
With Washington having dumped Oregon last weekend in what
appeared to be the battle for the Rose Bowl, and Mississippi and
I-SU squaring off in what should be the Sugar Howl decider this
week, it doesn't seem too premature to look around the country at
the various bowl contenders.
This year in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, a new bowl game will
be played for the first time, the Tobacco Bowl. Four teams as of
now stand as the favorites to initiate this newest of bowl games come
January 1.
The loading contender for the host school spot in the game ap
peals to be the winner of last year's (ligar Bowl, the Webster Queens
men. So far this year the Queensmen have been riding on a cloud of
smoke through their first five games.

Dutch Masters, atheltic director
and coach of the Queensmen lays
most of his team's success to the
vast recruiting job done by his
alumni group.
Center Prima Dora was re
cruited all the way from Italy,
big left tackle White Owl is a
product of an Arizona Indian res
ervation, and right end Robert
Burns came over from Scotland
in play.
The rest of the Queensmen's
starting eleven are mostly local
products. Roy Tan, speedy half
back, has run rings around op
ponents this year, Red Dot is in
at fullback, Phil Blunt and Wil
liam Penn are the guards, Phil
Panatella supplements Owl at
tackle, L Producto is the quarter
back, Van Dyck is a left end, and
from Walla Walla playing flank
er back is Corona Corona. Per
fecto Garcia understudies Pro
ducto.
The Queensmen's leading oppo
nent for the host spot is Virginia

I,&M from Newport. The other day I was out to see the Cavaliers'
coach "Old" Gold, and I think his words adequately summarized the
style of play the Cavaliers have shown this year, "It's what's up
front that counts," offered Gold. "If we haven't got it there we
haven't got it."
And it's not to hard to imagine after hearing these words that the
Cavaliers have the best line in the nation.
The line is lead by captain Paul Maul at tackle and "Fat" Ima at
guard. The rest of the line shows plenty of thinking men including
Herb Tareylon and Chester Field at ends, O. Asis at guard, Walter
Raleigh playing tackle, and a tough man on roll outs, center Bull
Durham.
The backfield is highlighted by a newcomer, fullback AI Pine. Pine
is in the backfield with two veterans "Lucky" Strike and Phil Morris.
1). Maurier, son of the famous financier, is at quarterback.
Early this year the Cavaliers almost had to close down school
due lo a cancer scare but they managed to group together and filter
out the infectuous sector. Actually this left them with only two weeks
lo get in shape for their first tilt with Maxwell House's Percolators
from Silex U. They said it couldn't be done, but "Old" Gold's men
did a king size job and were overwhelming winners.
Vying for the visitors spot in the Tobacco Bowl are two other
teams.
Canadian (lliih
The first of these and favorite as of now is a Canadian club led
by the Walker brothers, Johnny and Hiram. The Canadians' coach
and athletic director, the old granddad of the game, is "Old" Taylor.
Canadian line has shown so much in the spirit department this year
that it prompted Harold Express, Canada's leading sportswriter, to
nickname the upfronters "the Seagram's Seven."
The Walker brothers play halfback and fullback on the team with
Don Cue at quarterback and Jack Daniels at the other halfback. King
George VI is the fifth in the backfield Canadian rules call for five
backs.
The Canadian line features a half pint at guard in Gordon Dis
tilled, but the rest of the line is quart sized. Two foreigners,
Wolf Schmidt and "Smearing" Off, are the tackles, Early Times is at
guard, Jim Beam at center, and "Sonny" Brook and "Red Label are
ihe ends.
The Canadians also feature a strong bench with I. W. Harper, kick
specialist, and Cal Vert, a reserve.
The Canadians up 'til now have relied on one play as their big
ground gainer, and have labeled it Vat <W. It was a good enough play
to can Bud Weiser's Bnrgemeisters despite the fact that the Burge
meisters oriental import Carl lug scored often. Experts thought Bud
Weiser had too many horses.
Making it tough for the Canadians to get the coveted bid is a
powerhouse team from Hershey, Pennsylvania.
Dean of the Coaches
The Hershey team is coached by the highly respected dean of the
nation's coaches, Mr. Goodbar.
"Mountain" Bar is the light tackle on the Hershey Confectioners
and is the sweetest thing that's happened to his school in years. Team
ing with Bar in the line are a couple of guards that rarely melt. Baby
Ruth and "Milky" Weigh, and center "Big" Hunk. AI Mondjoy is the
other tackle. At ends are Butter Finger and O.Henry. The backfield
consists of Whitman Sampler at quarterback and Mac Farlane at
halfback. Both came to Hershey in a package deal, ( buck lies is at
fullback, and Peter Paul at the other halfback. QB Sampler gives
variety to ihe attack.
The Hershey squad always brings with it a whole paj-ty of at
taches including pom pom girls Tootsie Roll and Lolly Pop, and water
boys Cal Sew, and AI lfambra. Their trainer, one of the best around,
is Ben Gay
The confectioners can thank the work of "Pop" Corn and "Sugar"
Daddy, the leading alums, for helping assemble this year's club.
The Tobacco Bowl game itself should become quite a traditional.
University President Lines has already accepted an invitation to
throw out the first ball, and will bring his wife Grace and son Mai son.

tacted including Dutch Cleanser, A. Jacks, Mr. ( lean and the only
