# Stanford Plans Aerial Strategy
## 
### 
A local collegiate football honor
of some importance, the peninsula
passing yardage title, may well
be decided when Stanford and
San Jose State meet on the
Indian's home field Saturday.
The two teams, principle con
tenders for the peninsula leader
ship, have featured wide-open
aerial attacks all season and both
squads, Stanford led by junior
Dick Norman and San Jose
paced by senior Emmtt Lee and
sophomore Ray Podesto, are cur
rently ranked among the top ten
passing teams in the nation.
Emphasis in the Card's practice
sessions has not only been on
sharpening their own pass at
tack, but on defenses to stop the
Spartan's throwing which has
accounted for nearly 200 yards
per game.
Stop Runs Too
Besides San Jose's passing, the
Cards must guard against the
yard eating runs of halfbacks
Oneal Cuterry and Mac Burton.
Together the two Spartan back
field aces have added more than
500 yards to Lee and Podesto's
passing gains.
Stanford's power in the front
wall was weakened when left

tackle Phil Burkland pulled a
muscle in his thigh while work
ing on conditioning after practice
had ended. Burkland, one of the
best blockers on Jack Curtice's
eleven, will definitely he out of
the San Jose game.
Gordon Moves I T p
Taking over tackle duties for
the injured Burkland will bo
sophomore Jack Gordon, a third
stringer on last year's freshman
team who has improved rapidly.
Bob Atkinson will be moved from
center to tackle to bring the posi
tion up to its usual three deep
strength.
Gary Leahy, sophomore guard,
is also out of action with a back
injury and Dick Bowers, senior
halfback, is on the doubtful list.
