# RULES NEEDED?
## Infractions Jeopardize Fun. Stan. 
### Jerry Isenberg 
"If the students don't want the
! Fundamental Standard, let's give
I 'em a set of rules right now.
Let's give people the protection
i they need."
This was the chairman of the
Fundamental Standard and Hon
! or Code Commission, Jim Robert-
I son. speaking. His comment was I
[occasioned by the recent sharp
: increase in the number of stu-,
l dents appearing before Men's j
Council and other campus judi
; ciary groups.
"The popular attitude toward
the Standard seems to be chang-j
ing," said Kurt Ha user, Men's I
! Council chairman. "Students
want a handbook telling them |
j how to live." he concluded mo- j
I rosely.
Growing Concern
These statements, made at a
Daily interview, reflect a grow
ing concern in administrative and
j judicial circles about the future)
of the Fundamental Stan d a r d j
j here.
This concern has grown out of
i an increasing number of flagrant
violations of the Standard. Fori
I example, a firecracker thrown
into a stall shower recently by a 1
i Stanford student has impaired a
| fellow student's hearing for life, j
The value of furniture stolen
| from Stern lounges has risen to
$1500. Finally, a recent freshman
; exchange was crashed by Stan
-1 ford students making lewd com
' ments and throwing firecrackers.
"The University has a 1 w a y s
considered itself fortunate." j
j Mauser continued, "to be able to
i give each student the opportunity
| to develop a sense of personal re-
I sponsibility for his conduct,
j "It is impossible to develop this
! sence of responsibility in a per
son whose decisions in matters of
conduct are made according to a j
rule book."
Governing Principle
Fundamental Standard is the
name given to the principle that
l each Stanford student governs
J himself maturely and with honor,
j It is not a set of rules.
It does not depend on police en
j foreement for its success, but on
J public disapproval of behavior
contrary to its spirit.
This is in contrast to methods
of law enforcement at schools of
the caliber of Harvard, Yale and
Princeton where a much larger
police force than Stanford's co
j operates with each student's con
[ science to maintain order.
Where police protection is pro
vided, exc h a nges are rarely
crashed because few will risk ar
rest. Comparatively little furni
ture is stolen where night watch-1
men are stationed around the liv-
I ing groups.
Passing the Buck
Robertson concluded the inter
view by citing the recent expe
rience of many R.A.'s and spon
i sors. "Students approach them
i and ask, 'Will you turn us in if
we commit such - and - such an
act?'
"The trend seems to be toward
j passing on to someone else the
! responsibility for personal con
duct. I wonder if the traditional
! .joke about the FunStan watch- j
I bird hasn't become a popular sug-1
j gestion for changing the system
I governing our conduct."
