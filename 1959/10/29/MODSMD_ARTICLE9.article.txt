## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — The Su
preme Court refused yesterday
to require the Steelworkers Un
ion to hurry its appeal from an
order that, would end the 106-day
old steel strike.
This probably means the strike
will drag on at least into next
week.
Delay Stands
In a brief order giving no rea
sons, the high court rejected a
government request that Ihe
back-to-work injunction become
effective promptly if Ihe union
did not file its appeal b> noon to
day.
By so doing the Supreme Court
let stand a six-day delay granted

the union by an appeals court in
Philadelphia Tuesday when it up
held the back-to-work order is
sued earlier by a U.S. district
judge in Pittsburgh. That delay
intended to give the union time
to carry its case to the Supreme
Court is due to expire Monday.
There was nothing to indicate

the high court's action was other
than unanimous.
NEGOTIATIONS Top negoti
ators resume industrywide talks
in Pittsburgh today. Individual
company sessions continue; Unit
ed Steelworkers accuse Wheeling
Steel Corporation of failing to
bargain.
MEDIATION — Joseph Finne
gan, top federal mediator, sched
ules negotiations in Washington
Monday if Pittsburgh talks are
nonproductive.
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS —
President Eisenhower says Kai
ser Steel Corporation settlement
should be the signal for general
agreement.
IDLE — Half a million steel
workers, about 280,000 in steel
related industries. Strike in 107 th
