# Besiegers Routed In Polished Flop

### Mary Lou Mckinley 
They besieged the moon for nearly three hours in Memorial Audi
torium Wednesday night and despite the acting abilities of the
east, il emerged as untouched as after a U.S. rocket attempt.
Ben Cooper did his part, set designer Richard Hay did his, and the
rest of I lie cast did the best possible, but the play just never got off

the ground.
The pace of the play itself couldn't have been much faster, but
each speech was too much of a "little gem" too wordy and too long.
This, combined with direction which did nothing to spark the script
or compliment the acting, drew out the play to unnecessary length

'through seemingly unnecessary
detail.
All hough it was obvious that
;ho author, Sayril Schochen, had
spent a great deal of time writ
ing and polishing tho script, the
whole idea of tho drama never
seemed to crystalize, and char
acterization seemed generally
vague and underdeveloped.
Playing Brown's younger son
Oliver, Ben Cooper did a fine job,
proving himself to be the talented
young actor of radio, television
and movie experience he is con
sidered to be. Although the role
really gave him little chance to
show his true ability, he gave his
lines with an ease and natural
ness, making his role as the
pacifist-tending son quite be
; lieveable.
-John Brown
Alvin S. Kaufman, who pro
trayed John Brown, did the best
possible with the role, giving it
at least a part of the dynamic
quality it should have had. In try
ing to show the religious prac
tices behind Brown, both play
wright and director seemed to go
to the extreme of making him a
back-woods preacher type.
Julia Curtis gave a nice quality
to the role of Martha, Oliver's
young wife, but lack of forecful
ness made her characterization
' weak at times.
In the role of John Brown's
wife, Atha Hillback presented a
convincing picture of a woman
dominated and worn down by her
husband's zeal.
Definitive Role
One of the few definitive roles
!in tho entire play, Annie, the
mountain girl, zealously devoted
to her father and his cause, was
i effectively played by Carol Mo
; script.
Kagi, a member of Brown's
group who realized that "when
you carry a gun, God has to be on
your side," was powerfully play
ed by Fred Levi. With this char
acter in tiie second act, I believe,
the play came closest to expecta-
I tions.
The second act moved some-
I what better than the first, with
the scene between John Brown
1 and Oliver generating a good deal
of tension and excitement.
Good Settings
The settings were another
credit on the positive side.
| Created with imagination and
| skill, the two different sets for
the play added considerable to
the prevailing atmosphere of
i tension and violence.
The feeling of the impending
disaster of the Civil War how
| ever did not come across as
i strongly as the author evidently
: intended. As such, the projec
â–  tions which were cast on the
side walls of the auditorium
seemed to have little relevancy.
Certainly the opening mood,
generated stereophonically by a
I roll of drums surrounding the
j audience, a dimming of lights,
the projection and choral sing
ing, was effective and drew spon
taneous applause from the audi
ence.
Tickets for tho Stanford Play
ers' production are still on sale at
Memorial Box Office at $1.23 and
$1.75. Shows continue tonight
and tomorrow night and next
