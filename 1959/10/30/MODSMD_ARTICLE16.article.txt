# An Opinion Outlet
## 
### 
To SF.RVICF, what appears lo he a growing demand for outlets of
student opinion, The Daily announces initiation of a column open
to any individual at Stanford.
This column will supplement other media of student opinion
already iu existence, including Sequoia, The Bridge, and organi
zation publications.
Certain specific groups have requested a column for their
members only. We feel, however, that to be fair to ail persons
at Stanford, such a non-staff column should he open to everyone.
This column will appear each Friday beginning next week,
assuming interest is expressed through submission of articles.
Because of space limitations, the column will be on a stricth
competitive basis.
All articles submitted to the Daily office by each Wednesday
will he considered, with one selected for each week. Articles not
used one week will be held for consideration the following week.
Again it must be emphasized that submission of an article in
no way guarantees its publication, since we anticipate more mate
rial than there is space available. Articles should be in the range
of 100 to 500 words.
I here is 110 limit as to topics, hut timeliness and general in
terest in the topic will he criteria of selection, in addition lo
quality of writing.
