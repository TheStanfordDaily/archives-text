The University of California
has taken on the new title of the
controversy center of the nation.
Everyone is fighting about
something.
First it was the men's root
inn section, then compulsory
ROTC, then President Clark
Kerr's "directives of student
government."
And now the issue is discrimi
nation in housing.
In a three-and-a-half-hour meet
ing last week, the NAACP and
university administration decided
to have a written agreement with
those listing off-campus housing
with the Housing Office to abide
by the university's policy of no
discrimination, to inform each
student of the policy and to en
courage students to report cases
of discrimination.
This problem has apparently
been around quite a number of
years, but it wasn't until "nu
merous complaints" that any
kind of action was taken.
The first active step, a letter
from the NAACP to Kerr, stated
in part, "This constant harass
ment of students by bigoted land
lords—who use the university's
services to get their tenants —can
no longer be ignored by your of
fice, or the city officials, or the
community.
"We feel that it is highly im
possible for a student to study,
Objectively, what is being taught
at the university—freely—under
the threat of eviction for having
invited a Negro to share the
apartment, or even to visit, him."
A member of a m in or i t y
group who looked for housing
near campus this summer had
this to say, "My purpose is not
to call names, throw stones or
make faces. 1 promise not to
become emotional. I merely
want to state a few statistics
for the benefit of those who
persist in denying that there is
a serious problem for the mi
nority student seeking housing
in this area.
"Of the landlords I visited or
phoned, 46 per cent presented
clear-cut cases of discrimination;
15 per cent fell into the zone of
questionable discriminatory prac
tices; and 39 per cent were non
discriminating."
A column by a Negro student
in the Daily Californian, "One
Man's Opinion," told more. "For
the umpteenth time, I had been
refused a place to live. I know
tlie three s'ories so well that 1
feel slightly obliged to aid the
persons in telling them.
"There is the nice old lady
who is so sorry that she has
just rented the apartment. She
is sure that I would have liked
it but she had just received a
deposit from two young men.
Yet her 'For Rent' sign and list
ing are still up one month later.
"Then we find the staid old
gentleman who gladly shows you
the plnce—'Just perfect for you,
my boy'; 'Love to have you'—'Oh,
the rent? One hundred forty

five dollars por month, my boy;
you pay utilities also.' These
places are generally worth be
tween $65 and $80 per month.
'Well, sorry, my boy; can't go
any lower for a sharp single like
this.'
"The third story is generally
told by males, ages 22-36. 'I'm
sorry, fella, but I just can't do it.
Now I, personally, have nothing
against Negroes. If I owned the
place I would gladly rent it to
you; however, I am just the man
ager. The owner will just not al
low me to rent to you. I'm sorry,
fella.' "
As a result of this uproar the
university YYVC'A has decided
to make public a "survey on the
housing problems of minority
students at the university"
which was compiled between
1956 and 1958.
A questionnaire was sent to 100
Jewish, 100 Oriental, 40 Negro
and 100 foreign students. Forty
five per cent of these responded.
Eighty per cent answered that
they did not believe that all hous
ing listed in the Housing Office
is available to all students, re
gardless of race, color or creed.
The Daily C'al's editorial com
me nt was. "Something is
wrong in the university's Hous
ing office. . . .
"One landlord recently told a
Negro student that, as he under
stands tho university policy, 'I
have to SHOW my Apartment to
everyone, but I don't have to
rent it.'
"Clearly, something is amiss.
We prefer to believe the Housing
Office is operating with the best
intentions. But we can't believe
there is no foundation to such
general distrust of its policies."
In the meantime, Yale has
just announced that it will no
longer tolerate discriminatory
behavior on the part of land
lords who use the listing facili
ties of the Housing Bureau.
The action is a result of dis
crimination against several for
eign students.
The Michigan Daily of the Uni
versity of Michigan has called for
the adoption of a definite policy
which would force the withdraw
al of university recognition from
any organization, regardless of
the time it came onto the campus,
that restricts membership on the
basis of race, religion or nation
ality.
And at San Jose State, frater
nities will be given less than five
years to get rid of discriminatory
clauses if the State Board of Edu
cation approves a state college
presidents' proposal passed last
week.
The measure will deny recogni
tion to any fraternity, sorority or
other campus groups with racial
or religious discriminatory
clauses in its by-laws.
So it's all in the South, is it?
And in the midst of all this tur
moil, Los Angeles State College
listens to the swinging sounds of
Dave Brubeek, in person, tonight.
