Society Change
Editor, The Daily:
The tone and content of the
letters to the editor of this news
paper reflect a change in our
society that appears especially
prevalent on this campus. With
in most groups and especially on
university campuses, the major
ity of criticism and discussion of
existing values has usually come
from the liberal elements.
This is to be expected, regard
less of how liberal a particular
society is, the conservatives in
it are disposed to preserve the
prevailing conditions while the
liberals desire something dif
ferent.
Here, however, a large portion
of the letters (it seems to me a
majority) appear to represent
an element loath to change and
even loath to the idea that anyone
would be "immature" enough to
even suggest such a thing..
Such is the impression I get
from the letters of Tom Reilly
and Dave Long, as well as those
from other students who recently
have indicated their distaste with
the idea of even discussing
changes in our society as long as
what we have appears to function
adequately.
This way of thinking is a kind
of pseudo-pragmatism. Real
pragmatism is devoted to a sys
tem that achieves the best practi
cal consequences. EVEN if this
calls for- a change.
Reilly and Long indicate that
Frederick Moore's actions are
"immature." This is corrcct if
one equates immaturity with
emotionalism. Moore obviously
was aware that emotionalism, as
well as self-torture, are excellent
and effective means of gaining
public attention and sympathy.
Religious leaders and dictators
alike have always used these
methods. If one wants to define
such behavior as immature, it
is one's privilege.
What this verbose conserva
tivism of Stanford students means
might be significant. The prob
lem of whether it reflects their
background might prove to be an
interesting research problem for
a sociology or psychology student.

Editor, The Daily:
The Committee on General
Studies, in "extending" its pro
gram, has effectively banned B.S.
candidates from senior colloquia.

This action is a deplorable con
tradiction of Stanford's professed
"liberal" education policy.
Engineering students, because 1
of intense science requirements. !
are limited to a few units in the'
social sciences and the humani- 1
ties. Prerequisites in many of
these departments quickly use
up these units and the engineer
is therefore unable to pursue non-!
scientific interests to any satis-j
faction.
The senior colloquia program in j
past years was one way of re- j
lieving this block to education by
providing 1 lie engineer with an
opportunity to take a non-intro- j
ductory, non-scientific course of
special interest and to work in
close contact with a competent j
professor, rather than a graduate
student.
However, because A.B. candi- j
dates are required to take collo- :
quia and because many profes-j
sors are reluctant to teach Ihcm, j
B.S. candidates, already sorely

limited to a few general studies
units, are placed in an "if space
available" category with respect
to one of the most valuable
aspects of study at Stanford.
There are many of us in engi
neering who desire* as mu c h
scope to our education as possible,
and taking colloquia left-overs at
registration is no answer to our
problem.

have indicated their distaste with
the idea of even discussing

This way of thinking is a kind
of pseudo-pragmatism. Real
pragmatism is devoted to a sys
tem that achieves the best practi
cal consequences. EVEN if this
calls for- a change.
Reilly and Long indicate that
Frederick Moore's actions are
"immature." This is corrcct if
one equates immaturity with
emotionalism. Moore obviously
was aware that emotionalism, as
well as self-torture, are excellent
and effective means of gaining
public attention and sympathy.
Religious leaders and dictators
alike have always used these
methods. If one wants to define
such behavior as immature, it
is one's privilege.

The Committee on General
Studies, in "extending" its pro
gram, has effectively banned B.S.
candidates from senior colloquia.

This action is a deplorable con
tradiction of Stanford's professed
"liberal" education policy.
Engineering students, because 1
of intense science requirements. !
are limited to a few units in the'
social sciences and the humani- 1
ties. Prerequisites in many of
these departments quickly use
up these units and the engineer
is therefore unable to pursue non-!
scientific interests to any satis-j
faction.
The senior colloquia program in j
past years was one way of re- j
lieving this block to education by
providing 1 lie engineer with an
opportunity to take a non-intro- j
ductory, non-scientific course of
special interest and to work in
close contact with a competent j
professor, rather than a graduate
student.
However, because A.B. candi- j
dates are required to take collo- :
quia and because many profes-j
sors are reluctant to teach Ihcm, j
B.S. candidates, already sorely

limited to a few general studies
units, are placed in an "if space
available" category with respect
to one of the most valuable
aspects of study at Stanford.
There are many of us in engi
neering who desire* as mu c h
scope to our education as possible,
and taking colloquia left-overs at
registration is no answer to our
problem.

Society Change
Editor, The Daily:
The tone and content of the
letters to the editor of this news
paper reflect a change in our
society that appears especially
prevalent on this campus. With
in most groups and especially on
university campuses, the major
ity of criticism and discussion of
existing values has usually come
from the liberal elements.
This is to be expected, regard
less of how liberal a particular
society is, the conservatives in
it are disposed to preserve the
prevailing conditions while the
liberals desire something dif
ferent.
Here, however, a large portion
of the letters (it seems to me a
majority) appear to represent
an element loath to change and
even loath to the idea that anyone
would be "immature" enough to
even suggest such a thing..
Such is the impression I get
from the letters of Tom Reilly
and Dave Long, as well as those
from other students who recently
have indicated their distaste with
the idea of even discussing
changes in our society as long as
what we have appears to function
adequately.
This way of thinking is a kind
of pseudo-pragmatism. Real
pragmatism is devoted to a sys
tem that achieves the best practi
cal consequences. EVEN if this
calls for- a change.
Reilly and Long indicate that
Frederick Moore's actions are
"immature." This is corrcct if
one equates immaturity with
emotionalism. Moore obviously
was aware that emotionalism, as
well as self-torture, are excellent
and effective means of gaining
public attention and sympathy.
Religious leaders and dictators
alike have always used these
methods. If one wants to define
such behavior as immature, it
is one's privilege.
What this verbose conserva
tivism of Stanford students means
might be significant. The prob
lem of whether it reflects their
background might prove to be an
interesting research problem for
a sociology or psychology student.
