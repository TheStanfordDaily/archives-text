# Brubabes Meet Unbeaten Papooses Today
## 
### Chuck Bischoff 
The Freshman football team
will be looking for its third win
in a row tomorrow morning
against the UCLA frosh. Fresh
from a 27 t<o 21 victory over USC,
ihe Indian frosh will be opposed
by another tough squad from
down South in the preliminary
game at 10:45.
According to freshman Coach

Homer Smith, the Brubabes, who
trounced San Diego State 50 to 6
in their first game, should be
even better than the Trobabes.
He stated that once again the
Papoose gridders will probably
be underdogs, but this has not
bothered thorn the past two
weeks.
UCLA will run from the single
wing and the greatest problem
for the frosh this week has been
adjusting their defense to this
unfamiliar formation. The key to
the Brubabe attack is tailback
Rob Smith. Smith is an all-around

threat, as he is proficient at
both passing and running. Right
end Mel Profit bears watching on
passes and turns in a fine job de
fensively. .Right tackle Nelson
Rising bulwarks the Brubabe
line.
Again this week the Papoose
attack will rest largely on the
running of fullback Mick Doherly
and right halfback Ed Cummings.
Quarterback John Power should
pass more tomorrow than he did
against the Trobabes. Down
South the freshmen were able to
move well on the ground, but

their passing attack was stopped,
exactly the opposite situation
situation from 1 lie varsity game.
The line will he led by left guard
Starr Rounds and left tackle Chet
Hinshaw, who turned in outstand
ing performances last week. Hin
shaw and Power have been named
as Co-Captains for the game.
Physically, Stanford's fresh
men should be in pretty good
shape. Although left end Chris
Jessen is out for the season, al
most all the rest of the players
who have been out with injuries
should be ready to see action.
