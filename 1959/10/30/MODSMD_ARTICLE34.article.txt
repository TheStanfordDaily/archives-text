# Pursell, Cottle, Thomas Head Centers
## 
### 
The strongest position on this
year's S I a n 112 or d football team
seems undoubtedly to be center.
Junior Doug Pursell. currently
the starting middleman on the
Indian team, is one of the best
linemen the Indians have had in
many years. Pursell at 221
pounds is as rough a linebacker
as any in the country.
In on almost half of the Stan
ford tackles, Pursell has devel
oped tremendous powers of an
ticipation and rarely does the
husky center miss an opposing
ball carrier.
Backing up Pursell are prob
ably lb' 1 besi center reserves on
the West Coast, John Thomas
and Chris Cottle, with J. T. Jones
on hand also.
YV e i g hi n g in at 208 pounds,
Thomas is especially tough on of
fense. Thomas, a political sci
ence major from Whittier, is cur
rently in his last campaign of
football at Stanford.
Cottle would probably be first
team on most college football
squads but, unfortunately for
him, Pursell is around.
The sophomore center weighs
slightly over 200 pounds and is
majoring in pre-medical studies.
His home is Inglewood.
J. T. Jones, the number four
center on this year's squad, was

an end up until spring practice
last year. Since moving into the
center post Jones has improved
rapidly. In the brief appearances
that he has made this year he
has shown signs of good tackling
ability. Jones has one more year
of eligibility.
Monterey Park is his home
town and he is majoring in psy
chology.
