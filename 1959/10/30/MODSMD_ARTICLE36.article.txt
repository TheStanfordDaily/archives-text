# Poloists vs. SC
## 
### 
An amazing powerful Trojan
water-polo team will invade the
Stanford campus this afternoon
to meet the Indian poloists at 3:30
in the men's pool. The Cards will
have their hands full trying to
hold the Trojans down to a rea
sonable score and at the same
time put a few tallies on the
board themselves.
Last Saturday after scoring 12
times in the first quarter, the
Trojans went on to slaughter
Stanford 27-7. SC is led by Gabor
Nagy, a transfer off of Hungary's
1956 Olympic championship polo
squad. Nagy scored 11 against
the Cards last weekend.
Stanford will be faced with
putting the ball past goal guard,
Deutsch, another Hungarian from
the '56 squad who was chosen
to the Olympic water polo All
star team.
