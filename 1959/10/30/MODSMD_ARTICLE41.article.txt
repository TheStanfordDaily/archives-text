## 
### 
A panel of San Francisco
writers discussed the "permissive
climate," beatniks, Chinese opera
and literalurc, the unknown poets
and San Francisco-Los Angeles
rivalry yesterday at the first In
termezzo program in the Bender
Room of the Main Library.
Participating on the panel were
Michael Grieg, feature writer for
the San Francisco Chronicle;
Oscar Lewis, social historian of
San Francisco; Charles Leong,
free lance writer; Franklin Walk
er, literary historian; and moder
ator Richard Dillon.
Grieg, speaking of San Fran
cisco's permissive climate, said
that San Francisco encourages
visits from writers from the east.
Dr. Walker said that the writ
ing climate is as good as it ever
was but that the present writers
are not so concerned with local
color.

Charles Leong discussed the
literature from Chinatown. He
mentioned Handy Low, one of
the first Chinese to break the
literary ice. Low is a Stanford
graduate.
The beatnik situation was dis
cussed. The panel agreed that
the beat movement seems to be
continuing, even after the literary
spirit has gone out of it. Many of
the men out here are playing a
role.
Moderator Dillon concluded the
panel with "San Francisco is a
cultural center; it is going some
where; but just where we don't
have the foggiest notion."
