# Encina Remodeling Job Due for Early Windup
## 
### Roger Tippy 
The million-dollar remodeling
project on the center wing of En
cina Hall will be finished next
January or February, according
to Assistant Business Manager
S. F. Post.
At that time, the business and
controller's offices now at En
cina will expand into larger
quarters and the Planning Office
and vice-president in charge of
finance, now on the Quad, will
move in.
The chief accomplishment has
been to remove the wall which
partitioned each floor into in
dividual rooms and redesign the
floors for office, working. New
roofing has been put on and the
fifth floor converted into a
storage attic. Only the first two
floors will be utilized at present.
The job started last October and
is being handled by the firm of
Wagner and Martinez.
One of Oldest
Encina is one of the oldest
buildings on campus, built in the
founding year of 1891. At first it
was the only men's residence and
housed men of all classes. One of
the first to live there was Herbert
Hoover. In 1923 it became a dorm
itory for freshmen men, and con
tinued in this capacity until 1954
when Wilbur llall was built.
But it became a dormitory once
more. In 1956 room assignments

were made to the new Florence
Moore Hall. But September came
and two houses, Alondra and
Paloma, weren't finished. So for
three weeks Encina was home to
some 1.00 girls an ironic epilogue
10 63 years of male residency.
Encina Infirmary
In October of 1957 tlie name
was temporarily changed to En
cip.a Infirmary when the Asiatic
flu reached such proportions
thai regular hospital beds were
far too scarce. Two floors were
opened to accommodate the over
flow. At the height of the epi
demic, there were 67 patients at
Encina Infirmary.
Encina still can be used as an ;
emergency hospital, but no spe- j
cific plans, other than the con-;
version of the first two floors, j
have been made for its eventual ;
use.

emergency hospital, but no spe- j
cific plans, other than the con-;
version of the first two floors, j
have been made for its eventual ;
use.
The million-dollar remodeling
project on the center wing of En
cina Hall will be finished next
January or February, according
to Assistant Business Manager
S. F. Post.
At that time, the business and
controller's offices now at En
cina will expand into larger
quarters and the Planning Office
and vice-president in charge of
finance, now on the Quad, will
move in.
The chief accomplishment has
been to remove the wall which
partitioned each floor into in
dividual rooms and redesign the
floors for office, working. New
roofing has been put on and the
fifth floor converted into a
storage attic. Only the first two
floors will be utilized at present.
The job started last October and
is being handled by the firm of
Wagner and Martinez.
One of Oldest
Encina is one of the oldest
buildings on campus, built in the
founding year of 1891. At first it
was the only men's residence and
housed men of all classes. One of
the first to live there was Herbert
Hoover. In 1923 it became a dorm
itory for freshmen men, and con
tinued in this capacity until 1954
when Wilbur llall was built.
But it became a dormitory once
more. In 1956 room assignments

were made to the new Florence
Moore Hall. But September came
and two houses, Alondra and
Paloma, weren't finished. So for
three weeks Encina was home to
some 1.00 girls an ironic epilogue
10 63 years of male residency.
Encina Infirmary
In October of 1957 tlie name
was temporarily changed to En
cip.a Infirmary when the Asiatic
flu reached such proportions
thai regular hospital beds were
far too scarce. Two floors were
opened to accommodate the over
flow. At the height of the epi
demic, there were 67 patients at
Encina Infirmary.
Encina still can be used as an ;
emergency hospital, but no spe- j
cific plans, other than the con-;
version of the first two floors, j
have been made for its eventual ;
use.
