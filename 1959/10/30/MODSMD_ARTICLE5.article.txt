# Cards Host Spartan Gridders
## 
### John Osmundson 
Saturday is Boy Scout Day at
Stanford Stadium. Ten thousand
Boy Scouts will be in full regalia
while only about 40 Indians will
be in uniform. Pretty unair odds.
The Scouts are supposed to con
fine their activities to post-game
ceremonies, but 40 high-scoring
Spartans from San Jose State
have been contracted 1o provide
Stanford with a little football fun
in tomorrow's encounter.
Last Saturday Stanford's 19-
point underdogs traveled south to
Los Angeles, threshed the USC
Trojans 2112 in the first half and
then just barely missed pulling
the upsel of the year, 30-28. The
Indians were on the warpath;
they ambushed the unsupecting
Southlanders with the pass.
Same as Last Week
Tomorrow's performance might
follow the same script with San
Jose playing Stanford and the
Cards cast as USC. It might be
hard to see an analogy between
the undefeated Trojans and once
victorious Indians until one ex
amines the game facts.
In 13 previous games San Jose
has won one and Stanford gar
nered the other 14 decisions.
Pointwise it is 526 counters for
the locals and 120 for San Jose
over tho past 15 meetings. The
Spartans have been shut out sev
en times and lost 7-46 in 1957, the
most recent game between the
two schools.
And so the little school to the
south, whose 14.000 enrollment is
nearly three times as large as
Stanford's undergraduate attend
anee, might just resent the Cards
dominance.
They Pass Too
San Jose has no trouble filling
Stanford's role. Spartan coach
Bob Titchenal's team has been us
ing a passing attack for major
portions of their goalward jour
neys. much like the Indians.
The San Jose Stanford parallel
goes further. The Spartans have
had defensive problems, especial
ly against Oregon and Washing
ton State University, two teams
which also scored often against
the Cards. Against WSU the
Southlanders held the short end
of a 14-6 score until Washington
State exploded for 16 points in
the final four minutes to bury the
Spartans 30-6. The performance
was comparable to the Indians'
36-19 loss to the same Cougar
team.
Tomorrow's game is called foot
ball; the feet are used mainly for
running and kicking. Instead of
feel, though, the emphasis in this
encounter could well he on the
accurate arms of opposing pass
ers.
(ill Yards
Emmett Lee, San Jose's quar
terback, has completed 4ft out of
88 throws for a solid 611 yards;
Ray Podesto yes, he's from Mo
desto second signal caller be
hind Lee. has completed 29 for 38,
a sparkling .763 percentage and
401 more yards.
As everyone knows by now,
Stanford's Dick Norman is a veri
table magician with the pigskin,
threading his receivers' hands for
81 completions. 993 yards and sev
en touchdowns.
If the highly touted aerial tal
ent is hitting there may be little
reason to keep the ball on the

ground. Willi both teams throw
ing close to 30 passes per game,
there may be more missiles
thrown on the football field to
morrow than in tlie Stanford
rooting section.
Might Catch Up
When told that his team was
behind San Jose in passing totals,
Tribe chief Jack Curtis predicted,
"We might just catch up with
I hem. The team has been work
ing well in practice."
Six-foot one-inch Burton is the
tallest Spartan secondary defend
er. Most of the others range from
5-11 to Oneal Cuterry's 5-6. Nor
man can pass over the heads of
defenders to 6-5 Stanford end Ben
Robinson or 6-2 Chris Burford.
On the ground, Titchenal's
team has an edge with halfbacks
Cuterry and Mac Burton averag
ing 5.9 and 5.8 yards per carry
respectively to lead both team's
groundgainers. San Jose's 1098
yards on the ground is more than
300 yards better than the Indians'
total and gives the Spartans bet
ter offensive diversity.
Face Top Scorer
For Stanford, fullback Skip
Face leads in scoring with 40
points and in rushing with 185
yards. Halfback' Mac Wylie's 5.2
yards per carry is tops for the
Farm runners.
Phil Burkland, crisp blocking
left tackle, was listed as definite
ly out of action Wednesday and
sophomore Jack Gordon will
probably get ihe starting nod at
(he line slot. Halfback Dick Bow
el's will also miss tomorrow's
game due to injuries, but guard
Gary Leahy, out Wednesday, is
back on the active list.
