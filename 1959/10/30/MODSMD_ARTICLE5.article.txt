# Cards Host Spartan Gridders
## 
### John Osmundson 
Saturday is Boy Scout Day at
Stanford Stadium. Ten thousand
Boy Scouts will be in full regalia
while only about 40 Indians will
be in uniform. Pretty unair odds.
The Scouts are supposed to con
fine their activities to post-game
ceremonies, but 40 high-scoring
Spartans from San Jose State
have been contracted 1o provide
Stanford with a little football fun
in tomorrow's encounter.
Last Saturday Stanford's 19-
point underdogs traveled south to
Los Angeles, threshed the USC
Trojans 2112 in the first half and
then just barely missed pulling
the upsel of the year, 30-28. The
Indians were on the warpath;
they ambushed the unsupecting
Southlanders with the pass.
Same as Last Week
Tomorrow's performance might
follow the same script with San
Jose playing Stanford and the
Cards cast as USC. It might be
hard to see an analogy between
the undefeated Trojans and once
victorious Indians until one ex
amines the game facts.
In 13 previous games San Jose
has won one and Stanford gar
nered the other 14 decisions.
Pointwise it is 526 counters for
the locals and 120 for San Jose
over tho past 15 meetings. The
Spartans have been shut out sev
en times and lost 7-46 in 1957, the
most recent game between the
two schools.
And so the little school to the
south, whose 14.000 enrollment is
nearly three times as large as
Stanford's undergraduate attend
anee, might just resent the Cards
dominance.
They Pass Too
San Jose has no trouble filling
Stanford's role. Spartan coach
Bob Titchenal's team has been us
ing a passing attack for major
portions of their goalward jour
neys. much like the Indians.
The San Jose Stanford parallel
goes further. The Spartans have
had defensive problems, especial
ly against Oregon and Washing
ton State University, two teams
which also scored often against
the Cards. Against WSU the
Southlanders held the short end
of a 14-6 score until Washington
State exploded for 16 points in
the final four minutes to bury the
Spartans 30-6. The performance
was comparable to the Indians'
36-19 loss to the same Cougar
team.
