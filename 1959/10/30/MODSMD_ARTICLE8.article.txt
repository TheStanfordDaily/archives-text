# Bomb Reported in Union Turns Out to Be Fake
## Squad to Lift Fingerprints From Blinker 
### Barry Greenberg 
At 2:10 yesterday afternoon,
Stanford switchboard operator
Viola Meginnes received a call
from a man who said, "At 3 p.m.
a bomb is going off in the Union.
Somebody better do something
about it."
Stanford Police Chief Gordon
Davis was immediately notified
and Fixe Chief John Marston ac
companied him to the Union.
Students in the area were asked
10 evacuate and did . . . quickly.
Davis and Marston started look
ing for the bomb. With twenty
minutes to go before scheduled
"blast off time," Marston spotted
a blue package, tho size of a shoe
box, tucked under one of the
benches in The Cellar near the
cashier's window.
Tick, Tick, Tick
They decided to remove the
package which was emitting a
ticking sound, a ticking much
slower than that of an alarm
clock.
Davis gingerly lifted the pack
age and placed it on an aluminum
tray. With the assistance of Mar
ston, he placed the package in his
car and drove to Lake Lagunita
where he deposited it on tho
ground about 50 yards from the
boat house.
The operation was completed
by 2:50 and then the wait started.
The "bomb" didn't go off at 3 or
at 3:30 or ever. Sergeant First
Class George Raetz and Specialist
Eddie Arabe of the 6th Army
demolition squad arrived from
the Presido, San Francisco, at
5:15 and exposed the "bomb" to
be a blinker used by road gangs.
Taking no Chances
Just to play it on the safe
side, Ractz and Arabe stopped the
ticking with carbon dioxide. After
waiting a couple of minutes,
Santa Clara County Deputy Sher
iff Jerry Ducote picked up the
blinker and took it to the crime
laboratory in San Jose to check
for fingerprints.
"It was a nice, clear voice,"
said Miss Meginness, referring to
the anonymous tipster. "He
mumbled at first and 1 told him
I didn't understand. But the sec
ond time he was very clear," she
said.
"I've been fire chief for 20
years and this is the first bomb
scare we've had," commented
Marston. "The students made a
very quick and orderly evacua
tion," he smiled.
Praise for Davis
Jeff Littleboy, assistant direc
tor of news and publications and
one of the first persons on the
scene, had nothing but praise for
Davis. "Picking up that package
and carrying it to Lake Lagunita
took guts, real guts."
"I wasn't exuberant about
carrying that package," mused
Davis. "When I carried it on the
tray toward my car, I asked a
student to open the car door for
me. He obliged. I don't think he
knew what was in the package."
C. Robert Love, director of
safety, reports that there isn't,
the slightest clue to who the
prankster is. "It's still too early,"
Love said.
Jerry Campbell of tlu 1 Federal
Bureau of Investigation was
there as well as three detectives
since bombings are a federal of
fense.
