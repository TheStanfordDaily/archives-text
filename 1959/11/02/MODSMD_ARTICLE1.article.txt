# Indians Romp Over SJS; Stomp Spartans, 54-38!
## How the Ball (player) Bounces! 
### John Osmundson 
If football fans think they get
their money's worth when both
learns demonstrate a free-wheel
ing. high - scoring offense, then
those who witnessed Stanford's
54-38 romp over San Jose Satur
day got the best buy since the in
vention of inflation.
II was a perfect football Sat
urday afternoon. There was a
hint of autumn and the appear
ance of Boy Scouts, bands and
professors James Watkins, Kurt
Servos and Julius Schuchat with
their "yell of the century" lent nil
the color needed. The only thing
lacking was that extra little ingre
dient of the game known as de
fense.
Both teams, noted for their
passing attacks, had their aerial
games moving at full throttle.
The Jack Curtice directed Indians
chalked up 285 yards by air and
added 224 yards rushing for a sea
son high of .109 yards total of
fense. Bob Titchenal's southern
squad pitched for 253 yards mid
ground out 107 on the ground for
a game final of 362.
Neither team could contain the
other. If seven points had been
awarded every time the defensive
eleven held the op p os i t i on on
downs. Stanford would still have
won. but this time by a slimmer
21-2 1.
New Record
The total of 92 points was
enough for a new Stanford Sta
dium record; tlie old record was
ancient indeed, set in 1923 when
the Indians defeated Mare Island
82-0 and tied in 1925 when UCLA
fell to the Cards by the same
score.
Three Cards, Dick Norman,
Mac Wylie and Chris Burford,
came through with exceptional
performances. Norman protected
his national total offense lead
with 260 yards passing and eight
running for 268 total. Wylie in
tercepted two San Jose passes,
ran one back for a touchdown,
threw tremendous blocks to aid
Stanford's running game. He also
made 10 tackles while on defense.
Burford. the nation's leading
pass receiver, caught five more
tosses for 77 yards and one touch
down. Archie Schmitt and Skip
Face picked up 77 and 82 yards
running respectively to lead Card
rushers.
Fast Break
Not only did Stanford's final
margin of victory resemble a bas
ketball score, but the opening
minutes of play resembled the
hoop game's fast break style of
offense.
After taking the opening kick
off, the Cards went 13 yards in
two plays. Norman threw two in
complete passes and then the
Tribe quarterback connected to
end Ben Robinson on the left side;
Robinson cut to the sidelines and
ran the rest of the 58 yards needed
for the first Indian touchdown.
Sure-footed Skip Face warmed


OOFS! —We've heard a lot about the way a foot
hall bounces hut what about the way a football
player bounces? In the upper left picture Archie
Sclunitt goes for a header in the first quarter
with Gary I'ike looking on. A little later Skip
Face (lower I.) landed on the other end after a
good gain around left end. Chris Burford (lower

r.) reversed the process once more as he goes
down neck first after taking a Dick Norman
pass in mid-air as Spartan center Hank
< hanmess (53) looks on. Red-hot prof James T.
Watkins IV (upper r.) didn't do any bouncing in
leading the "yell of the century" except maybe
into the Yell Leader election (See Edit P. 2).
