## 
### Doug Willis Associate Editor 
Running on the platform "A
vote for Symonds is a vote for
Garlinghouse," junior Taffy
Symonds has given notification
that he is a write-in candidate
for head yell leader.
Two regularly filed candidates
will run against Symonds for
head yell leader: Phi Delta Theta
Paul Daigle and Phi Sigma Kappa
Phil Huyck.
Symonds' campaign is based on
the proposition that he will run
for the office, and if elected, he
will appoint sophomore Rich
Garlinghouse as his assistant.
Symonds would then fade out of
the picture and leave Garling
house as the actual yell leader.
Declared Ineligible
Garlinghouse filed for the of
fice of head yell leader last week,
but was declared ineligible by
Legislature because he did not
meet the constitutional require
ment that yell leader candidates
"must have completed at least 7i5
units, or five quarters ... at the
time of election."
Before the Constitutional
amendment last spring which
moved the yell leader election to
fall quarter it was possible for
sophomores 1o run for yell leader.
A member of Legislature com
mented that there is nothing il
legal about Symonds' move, but
that there are clauses in the Con
stitution concerning student of
ficers who fail to fulfill the obli
gations of their offices.
Yell Leader lially
Head yell leader candidates
will appear at a rally at the Cellar
tomorrow noon. Ken Pureell,
elections commission chairman,

fice of head yell leader last week,
but was declared ineligible by
Legislature because he did not
meet the constitutional require
ment that yell leader candidates

gations of their offices.

Running on the platform "A
vote for Symonds is a vote for
Garlinghouse," junior Taffy
Symonds has given notification
that he is a write-in candidate
for head yell leader.
Two regularly filed candidates
will run against Symonds for
head yell leader: Phi Delta Theta
Paul Daigle and Phi Sigma Kappa
Phil Huyck.
Symonds' campaign is based on
the proposition that he will run
for the office, and if elected, he
will appoint sophomore Rich
Garlinghouse as his assistant.
Symonds would then fade out of
the picture and leave Garling
house as the actual yell leader.
