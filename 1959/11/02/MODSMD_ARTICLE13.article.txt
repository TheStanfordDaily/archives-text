# New Plan for House Displays
## 
### 
House decorations for Big
Game weekend this year should
be more eye catching and eye
holding than ever.
For the first year, as many as
three living groups can work on
one display. This means greater
concentration of effort and money
and better results.
There will also be new cate
gories for trophy prizes and new
criteria for judging. These will
be decided tomorrow night.
Dick Landes, decoration chair
man, reminds all living groups
that the deadline for entering the
house decorating contest is Fri

Paper for the decorations can
be ordered through ASSU at a
discount if it is ordered by next
Wednesday. A color chart will be
posted in the ASSU office lobby
on Wednesday.
There are only twenty-five more
decorating days until Big Game.
