Stanford's firsl-ever <*;Â» 11 quarter head yell leader election looks
now as though it may come close to the Karto/ian campaign of last
spring in so far as interest is concerned.
Although only two "official '"candidates now exist, the collec
tion of write-in and substitute candidates is adding plenty of fuel
to the campaign.
Hut despite the now-growing numbers of student entrants, the
most popular candidate at this point is quite likely Professor James
T. W at kins IV.
Winner of the red-hottest professor election, Dr. Walking was
a smash success with his yell of the century at Saturday's San Jose
Stale game. Almost before he had finished, a "W rile-in Watkins"
chant and election drive were beginning in the stands.
To Dr. Watkins, we say thanks for your wonderful sportsman
ship and good humor during the whole red-hot professor event.
We hope you'll accept the write-in voles you're hound to get as
further appreciation.
