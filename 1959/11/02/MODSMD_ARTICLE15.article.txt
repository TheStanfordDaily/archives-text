# TALKING ABOUT
## Yell Leaders 
### Doug Willis 
Two yell leader candidates
are officially filed for primary
elections Wednesday and Thurs
day, and probably three more
candidates will be in the race,
though not all by choice.
Bill Kartozian appears certain
1o draw a few write-in votes.
"But I'm not a candidate," says
Kartozian, "the only way I know
of to say that is that I won't
even be around next fall."
Hod Hot Professor James T.
Watkins IV is retiring from yell
leading, though an energetic
write-in campaign is being pre
pared in his behalf.
Watkins, however, is expected
to decline the yell leader post
if elected. On being contacted he
stated, as he read the constitu
tion. only students are eligible for
student offices.
Running in behalf of Rich
Garlinghouse, Taffy Symonds has
declared himself a write-in candi
date on the platform, "A vote for
Symonds is a vote for Garling
house."
Garlinghouse, a sophomore,
was a filed candidate for yell
leader until Thursday when
Legislature ruled him ineligible
under the amended yell leader
election by-laws.
Symonds and Garlinghouse ex
plained that Symond's candidacy
is only a legal move and that
they could find no other way for
Garlinghouse to run for yell
leader. If elected, Symonds ex
plained, he would appoint Garl
inghouse as his chief assistant
yell leader, then he would fade
out of the picture.
"I am fighting bureaucracy,"
said Symonds. "Last year, due to
an unfortunate oversight, the
Legislature neglect to provide
constitutional means by which a
student of sophomore standing
could run for yell leader.
"But now the Legislature
says it is too late to change the
standing requirements, too hard
for them to move quickly."
"We cannot interpret that last
year's Legislature overlooked
changing the yell leader qualifi
er'ions," explained ASSU Presi
dent Rich Sundeen. "As the quali
fications were previously, a per
son couldn't hold the office of yell
leader until his junior year. If the
by-laws were amended to allow
sophomores to run in the fall,
then a person could hold the of
fice while still a sophomore."
"I think that the Legislature
hasn't kept in touch with the sit
uation by saying 'Yes, we'll
change it for next year'," com
mented Garlinghouse.

"Now the only persons eli
gible for yell leader are jun
iors," said Garlinghouse, "and
I'm sure that Legislature didn't
intend that."
A member of Legislature com
mented that there seemed to be
nothing wrong with Symonds'
plan for the election. "Rut there
are articles in the Constitution on
persons negligent of their offices.
I can't speak for Legislature, but
we could do something about itâ€”
maybe."
Symonds empasized the "neces
sity" of his candidacy: "To fight

the slow wheels of bureaucracy, I
am attempting an unprecedented
move."
Candidate Paul Daigle wasn't
available for comment, and Phil
Huyck didn't feel that he should
comment on the eligibility of
another candidate, but an anony
mous rooter summed up nearly
everyone's thoughts: "If this
thing keeps going, it could be al
most as big as Kortozian last
spring."

Two for the money
