Kind Words
Editor, The Daily:
It is altogether fitting and
proper that a few kind words be
said on behalf of Tom Reilly be
fore the campus pacifists see fit
to bury him.
I am afraid poor Tom does
fear the consequences of nuclear
war just as do Messrs. Green,
Freeman, and Moore. I suspect,
however, that Mr. Reilly is not
the one who "is just not aware
i of the tragic situation confront
ing the world today."
Mr. Reilly seems to realize that
there are some things more re
pulsive and fearsome than anoth
er war, e.g., Russian domination.
We— from Mr. Eisenhower on
down to Mr. Freeman—are all too
prone to regard war as unthink
able and to act accordingly.
What more can the Russians
ask for? What can give greater
: power to their threat of war than
, this outlook? Perhaps it is time
we as a nation give serious
thought to war as a thinkable
! alternative.
Allen Drury, formerly of the
Stanford Daily, has alluded to the
pacifist phenomena in his current
best seller, "Advise and Consent."
The pacifist movement today
1 seems to bear striking resem
blances to Drury's COMFORT
j (Committee on Making Further

Offers for a Russian Truce) and
its battJe cry: "I had rather crawl
on my knees to Moscow than die
under an atom bomb." Isn't
biological life great?
Finally, it's not so strange that
Michael Freeman should have
trouble with what he regards as
Mr. Reilly's subtle distinctions.
Mr. Freeman evidently finds the
whole Western Tradition a bit too
Subtle to comprehend.

Recoil Action
Editor, The Daily:
As would any red-blooded Stan
ford Rough, I recoiled in shock
upon reading Friday's letter from
Messrs. Frentzel and Gibbs. These
stalwart defenders of intollec
tualism would deny us our sports
page in the interest of providing
space for the weighty words of
our foreign students.
Granted, these visitors are en
titled to space in the press, but
let us not look to page 3 to find it.
Frentzel and Gibbs curse the
Sports Section, yet do they realize
that it is all that keeps The Daily

from the oblivion it would other
wise deserve? Were it not for this
one ray of light on a gloomy sea
of printer's ink, The Daily would
go unread from press to garbage
can liner.
Now that there is, indeed, to be
a column for individual student
opinion, there must be space in
which to print it. This will neces
sitate a reduction in the space de
voted to other features. Let us re
move the trivia, the useless chaff,
from The Daily. Like the editor
ials. maybe.
