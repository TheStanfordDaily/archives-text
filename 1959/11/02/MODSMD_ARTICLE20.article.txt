The single wing formation that
helped raise Stanford freshman
coach Homer Smith to All-Ameri
can heights as a player al Prince
ton. came back to haunt the Card
Mentor on Saturday when his
Stanford Papooses dropped a
game at the hand of the single
winging Brubabes of UCLA, 27-
13.
The loss was the first this year
for Smith's hard-charging Pa
pooses who had previously whip
perl Cal's first year men and also
USC's frosh. UCLA has yet to
lose this year.
Over 101) Yards
Bob Smith, an explosive triple
threat tail back, did most of the
damage for UCLA as the speedy
halfback gained over 400 yards
on the afternoon.
Smith gained 136 yards rush
ing, completed seven passes for
101 yards, ran back two kickoffs
for 125 yards, and took one pun)
return for one yard to pace the
Uclans.
John Power, Stanford's left
handed quarterback, had quite a
day for himself also. The 195
pound signal caller hit on 19 of
30 pass attempts for 231 yards.
UCLA opened the scoring in the
first quarter after a bad pass
from center on a fourth down
play resulted in Stanford losing
the ball to the Bruin frosh on
the Indian 35. Ten plays later,
Smith carried the ball over from
the five for the touchdown. Two
pass interference calls against
Stanford contributed to the UCLA
cause in the scoring march.

Stanford tied the score in the
second quarter when Power
passed to end Tom Fetherston for
three yards to climax an 80 yard
drive, Power then booted the
extra point.
UCLA came back to take the
lead in the third quarter.with Bill
Hauck carrying the ball the last
11 yards lo the score. Jim Meyers,
after the Bruins had been pena
lized 15 yards, booted about a 22
yard extra point.
The fourth quarter saw three
touchdowns scored. The first, a
UCLA tally, came after a 68 yard
Brubabe march in which Smith
gained 44 of the yards.
Alley-Oop
The second score of the quarter
was Stanford's as quarterback
Power and flanker back Jim
Shroyer combined on some fancy
pass plays. The big play in Ihe
Papoose 80 yard final drive was
an a 1 ley-oop pass play from
Power to Shroyer with the
flanker back leaping and pulling
the high floating pass away from
two defenders on the UCLA four
yard line.
UCLA's Smith iced the game
with a 92 yard return of the Stan
ford kickoff. Ho ran virtually un
touched down the east sideline
for UCLA's final touchdown.
The only thing that brought
Smith down all day was the
UCLA bench.
On leaving the game after his
final touchdown scamper, Smith
leaned too far back on fine of the
wooden benches that lined the
UCLA sideline, the result was one
well tipped tailback.
