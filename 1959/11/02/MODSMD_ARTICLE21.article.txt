West Coast football teams
played pretty much as expected
last weekend as the top elevens
all ground their way to victory.
Only a strong defensive effort
saved Cal's Bears from a white
washing at the hands of USC,
and the Trojans had to settle for
a 14 to 7 victory.
Washington strengthened their
position as favorites for playing
in the Rose Bowl by stopping
UCLA, 22-7. Washington State
maintained their slim Bowl hopes
by powering over Oregon State,
14-0. And Oregon's Ducks spotted
Idaho a seven point lead and
then proceeded to clobber the
hapless Vandals, 45 to 7.
SC's Trojans seems to have
lost their "fine edge" as they have
been able to defeat their last
three opponents by an average of

I only five points. Against the
| hitherto disappointing Bears from
Berke 1 e y, the men of Troy
had to come from behind to hand
i the Gold and Blue their sixth
; straight loss.
At Los Angeles, Bob Schloredt,
1 the Huskies' one-eyed quarter
back, was the whole show as he
passed for two touchdowns and
scored once himself in leading
Washington to their first victory
over the Bruins since 1950. Ore
gon is still in the Rose Bowl
I race as they proved by moving
j rough-shod over Idaho.
