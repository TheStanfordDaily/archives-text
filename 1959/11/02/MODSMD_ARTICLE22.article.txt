# Curtice Happy; Despite Defense
## 
### 
Jack Curtice was understand
ably happy after Stanford's
victory Saturday. He was
pleased with the offense, but he
was not unhappy with the de
fense, despite the 38 points which
the Indians gave up to San Jose
State.
Curtice explained it thusly:
"We contained San Jose State
reasonably well. That (Oneal)
Cuterry is a goer. To defend
! against him, you have to give a
| little on other departments of de
! fense." Curtice might also have
added that he cleared the bench
I of everybody thai suited up for
the game.
Curtice was especially happy j
with the rushing attack. He
enthused that Skip Face, Archie
Schmitt, and Mac Wylie, who
I gained 177 yards between them,
really looked good on the ground.
Curtice was equally pleased j
with his blocking. He cited Gil
Dowd and Wylie for clearing the
way for Face and Schmitt on
Stanford's big ground gainer, the,
I pitchout.
Curtice was proud of the
team's spirit. "Those boys have
put out their guts against Ore
gon, Southern California, and
Wisconsin, and they still come
out and play every week."
The attitude of the players in
dicated a strong determination
to beat UCLA. The unholy four of
Chris Burford, Dick Norman,
Skip Face, and Irv Nikolai said
through spokesman Nikolai, "It's
good to win, but we've got to
work hard on defense. UCLA is
going to be a lot tougher than
San Jose State." Burford and
Norman didn't have much to say.
Their wide smiles told their story.
Curtice also commented that
next weekend's game should be
a wide open affair.

Card Offense Praised
Coach Bob Titchenal looked
rather tired and depressed as he
left the field after his San Jose
Slate Spartans suffered their
third loss of the season at the
hands of Stanford's fired-up In
dians.
Victims of the pinpoint pass
ing of Dick Norman, ihe Spartans
yielded 285 yards through the air.
Obviously upset by this fact.
Titchenal reasoned. "We throw
a lot, and their passing shouldn't
have hurt us that much. I'd have
to say that Norman and Burford
hurt us as much as anybody."
The youthful Spartan coach
noted that Stanford is a great of
fensive football team and diffi
cult to contain. "Defensively?
Well, we moved Ihe ball pretty
well ourselves," he added.
Titchenal singled out right half
back Mac Wylie and right end
Ben Robinson in addition to Nor
man and Burford for their out
standing play.
Titchenal was elated over the
performance of second string
quarterback Lee, who completed
17 of 24 passes for 175 yards.

the game.
Curtice was especially happy j
with the rushing attack. He
enthused that Skip Face, Archie
Schmitt, and Mac Wylie, who
I gained 177 yards between them,
really looked good on the ground.
Curtice was equally pleased j
with his blocking. He cited Gil
Dowd and Wylie for clearing the
way for Face and Schmitt on
Stanford's big ground gainer, the,
I pitchout.
Curtice was proud of the
team's spirit. "Those boys have
put out their guts against Ore
gon, Southern California, and
Wisconsin, and they still come
out and play every week."
The attitude of the players in
dicated a strong determination
to beat UCLA. The unholy four of
Chris Burford, Dick Norman,
Skip Face, and Irv Nikolai said
through spokesman Nikolai, "It's
good to win, but we've got to
work hard on defense. UCLA is
going to be a lot tougher than
San Jose State." Burford and
Norman didn't have much to say.
Their wide smiles told their story.
Curtice also commented that
next weekend's game should be
a wide open affair.

Coach Bob Titchenal looked
rather tired and depressed as he
left the field after his San Jose
Slate Spartans suffered their
third loss of the season at the
hands of Stanford's fired-up In
dians.
Victims of the pinpoint pass
ing of Dick Norman, ihe Spartans
yielded 285 yards through the air.
Obviously upset by this fact.
Titchenal reasoned. "We throw
a lot, and their passing shouldn't
have hurt us that much. I'd have
to say that Norman and Burford
hurt us as much as anybody."
The youthful Spartan coach
noted that Stanford is a great of
fensive football team and diffi
cult to contain. "Defensively?
Well, we moved Ihe ball pretty
well ourselves," he added.
Titchenal singled out right half
back Mac Wylie and right end
Ben Robinson in addition to Nor
man and Burford for their out
standing play.
Titchenal was elated over the
performance of second string
quarterback Lee, who completed
17 of 24 passes for 175 yards.
Jack Curtice was understand

victory Saturday. He was
pleased with the offense, but he
was not unhappy with the de
fense, despite the 38 points which
the Indians gave up to San Jose
State.
Curtice explained it thusly:
"We contained San Jose State
reasonably well. That (Oneal)
Cuterry is a goer. To defend
! against him, you have to give a

the game.
