# Rules Conflicts Figure in Rail, Steel Disputes
## 
### 
From The Associated Press
Conflicts over work rules con
i tinued 1o play a major role in dis-
I putes between unions and two of
I America's largest industries
I steel and railroads.
As the steel strike went inio
its 110 th day, the government's
j failure to win enforcement of its
injunction to force strikers back
to work before the beginning of
November meant a further delay
in ihe filling of many priority
defense contracts.
New Deadline
The steel industry will now
have until Dec. 31 to fill military
orders whereas the deadline
would have been Dec. 14 had the
j strike been set lied before Sunday.
The same old problems of work
j rules and wages continued to
1 deadlock the negotiators, while
| the unions and the government
prepared arguments for the Su
| preme Court hearing tomorrow
on the union's appeal to set aside
the Taft-Hartley injunction that
I would halt the dispute for at least
80 days.
Kailrouds Too
Meanwhile, the Association of
American Railroads yesterday
made public its proposals for
changing work rules some as
much as 40 years old which it
says cost carriers more than $300
million last year.
A three-year moratorium on
changing work rules expired
: Saturday and t lie association
promptly presented ideas for
eliminating unnecessary posi
tions, wasteful puridictional di
visions, and multiple pay for
single-time work.
