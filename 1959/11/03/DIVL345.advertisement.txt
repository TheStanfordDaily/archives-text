COLLINS RADIO COMPANY
WESTERN DIVISION
Will visit the Stanford University Campus
on November 6, 1959, to interview 8.5.,
M.S. and Ph.D. candidates in EE, ME and
Physics who wish to locate on the West
Coast.
The Western Division of Collins Radio Company has estab
lished its autonomy during the past tew years. The result
ing plans provide for a very substantial expansion as well
as complete relocation in new facilities in a very desirable
Southern California area.
Systems and equipment design techniques in the field of
data handling for communications purposes are of primary
importance at the present time. The basic elements of
these "state of the art" products are proprietary to Collins
and applicable to both military and civilian use. Advanced
development thinking and studies are continually in
process.
A premium is placed upon graduate level education. Com
pany sponsorship is available for either formal graduate
programs toward advanced degrees or informal spot courses
picked up as the occasions and interest coincide.
If you arc unable to attend an interview, please write to the
Industrial Relations Department of Collins Radio Company,
2700 West Olive Avenue, Burbank, California.
