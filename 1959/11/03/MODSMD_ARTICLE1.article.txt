# Noon Rally to Introduce Yell Leader Candidates
## 
### 
Head yell leader candidates
hot h official and write-in will be
presented, along with candidates
for Men's and Women's Councils,
at a short rally at the Cellar at
noon today.
Bill Kartozian will introduce the
aspirants for his office, who will
make short speeches and or lead
yells.
Yesterday some 400 persons

gathered in front of the Quad,
expecting to see Rich Garling
house parachute from an air
piane. They gasped when the
parachute failed to open but later
learned that instead of Garling
house, a dummy had been shoved
from the plane, sheets streaming
boh id it to resemble an unopened
parachute.
Garlinghouse is ineligible to
run for head yell leader because
he is a sophomore, but Taffy
Symonds is seeking the position,
promising that Garlinghouse will
be the inspiration for the yell
leading.
(See statements by the two of
ficial yell leader candidates and
Symonds on page 2.)
