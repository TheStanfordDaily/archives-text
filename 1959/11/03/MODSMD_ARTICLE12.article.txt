### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (/Piâ€”
The UN Political Committee ap
proved unanimously yesterday a
resolution tossing all disarma
ment proposals to the forthcom
ing Geneva conference.
But just before the vote the
United States and the Soviet Un
ion clashed on the emphasis to
ho placed on Premier Nikita
Khrushchev's plan for wiping out
all armaments in four years.
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minis
ter Vasily V. Kuznetsov declared
the Soviet Union expected that
Khrushchev's proposal will be
taken as a basis for the work of
the 10-nation East-West Commit
tee that will gather in Geneva
early next year.
U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge replied that the resolution
referred specifically to both So
viet and British plans presented
to the United Nations and to all
other proposals and suggestions
made here.
"That language is clear enough
to make plain that the Geneva
group has been asked to give
thorough consideration to all per
tinent proposals, and not just
one," ho declared. "We may wish
to put forward new proposals of
our own" at Geneva.
