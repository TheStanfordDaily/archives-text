# Apartment Size To Be Discussed
## 
### 
David Packard, chairman of
the Stanford Board of Trustees,
and Alt" Brandin, university busi
ness manager, will meet tonight
with Menlo Park residents who
will try to shrink the size of tho
proposed tower apartments on
Stanford land.
The meeting will begin at S
p.m. at the Oak Knoll School in
Menlo Park.
The Willow-Creek Corporation
is expected to ask the city of
Palo Alto for permission to erect
eight-story apartments backing
up to San Francisquito Creek on
Stanford land south of the creek.
Bay Laurel Drive and nearby
areas in Menlo Park fear the
buildings would lower property
values and destroy their privacy.
