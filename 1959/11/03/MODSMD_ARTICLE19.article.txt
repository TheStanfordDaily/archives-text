The President has been shown
that the flattering reception
which he received when he wenl
recently to Bonn and Paris did
not mean that they accepted his
leadership.
Within the past week both
General de Gaulle and Dr. Ad
enauer have in fact dissented
from ami have conic out against
the new policy which the Presi
dent decided upon last -Inly.
To be sure, both approve in
principle the exchange of visits
and tlie prospect of a summit
meeting. But in fact each is op
posing the ideas which are the
substance of the new policy.
General de Gaulle has done this
by reviving the older doctrine
which the President broke away
from last summer. The general
wants to postpone a meeting as
long as possible, in this case until
Ihc spring when, with the nomi
nating conventions about to
choose the President's successor,
General Eisenhower will be very
near the end of his full influence
and prestige.
General de Gaulle, moreover,
does not want to treat the meet
ing in the spring as an engage
ment. He wants to treat it as a
prize which Mr. K must in the
months to come win by his good
behavior. During these months
we, or at least lie, are to judge
whether Mr. K has earned the
prize.
Finally, if the French view pre
vails, a summit meeting is not to
be an attempt to negotiate a few
useful agreements. It is to be a
grandiose diplomatic Armaged
don. There is to be "a confronta
tion between East and West that
could be decisive for peace."
This is a recipe for accepting
the President's policy in principle
and obstructing it in fact.
Dr. Adenauer's tactics are the
same. In principle, he too is in
favor of a meeting with the

head of the Soviet government.
But he proposes to censor what
may be talked about at the
meeting, lie would like to ex
clude from the agenda the prob
lems of Berlin and of Germany!
He thinks the negotiations
should he limited to the sub
ject of controlled nuclear and
conventional disarmament.
This partnership is now chal
lenging the President's leadership
of the Western alliance. Bonn and
Pai'is are entitled to do that, and
it is evident that we are not going
to quarrel with them over the
leadership of the West.
Indeed, there are many Amer
icans who would say that if
there is to be a settlement in
Central Europe, the Europeans
should play the leading part in
it.
But before it comes to a settle
ment Bonn and Pai'is should ask
themselves whether they are pre
pared to exercise the leadership
of the Western alliance. On Euro
pean questions they can have that
leadership if they can carry the
burden of it.
It is not something that Ameri
cans want for the sake of pres
tige. The leadership of Western
Europe is a heavy burden which
Americans have been carrying
since the second World War be
cause no one else has thus far
been able to carry it.
The basic fact is that the de
fense of West Berlin, of West
ern Germany, ami of metro
politan France, depends upon
the United States. The German
forces and the French forces
are a screen and a tripwire.
But that is all they are.
On this country rests the whole
responsibilty for deterring the
use of force in Central Europe,
and of waging the war if it comes

dent decided upon last -Inly.
To be sure, both approve in
principle the exchange of visits
and tlie prospect of a summit
meeting. But in fact each is op
posing the ideas which are the
substance of the new policy.
General de Gaulle has done this
by reviving the older doctrine
which the President broke away
from last summer. The general
wants to postpone a meeting as
long as possible, in this case until
Ihc spring when, with the nomi
nating conventions about to
choose the President's successor,
General Eisenhower will be very
near the end of his full influence
and prestige.
General de Gaulle, moreover,
does not want to treat the meet
ing in the spring as an engage
ment. He wants to treat it as a
prize which Mr. K must in the
months to come win by his good
behavior. During these months
we, or at least lie, are to judge
whether Mr. K has earned the
prize.
Finally, if the French view pre
vails, a summit meeting is not to
be an attempt to negotiate a few
useful agreements. It is to be a
grandiose diplomatic Armaged
don. There is to be "a confronta
tion between East and West that
could be decisive for peace."
This is a recipe for accepting
the President's policy in principle
and obstructing it in fact.
Dr. Adenauer's tactics are the
same. In principle, he too is in
favor of a meeting with the

head of the Soviet government.
But he proposes to censor what
may be talked about at the
meeting, lie would like to ex
clude from the agenda the prob
lems of Berlin and of Germany!
He thinks the negotiations
should he limited to the sub
ject of controlled nuclear and
conventional disarmament.
This partnership is now chal
lenging the President's leadership
of the Western alliance. Bonn and
Pai'is are entitled to do that, and
it is evident that we are not going
to quarrel with them over the
leadership of the West.
Indeed, there are many Amer
icans who would say that if
there is to be a settlement in
Central Europe, the Europeans
should play the leading part in
it.
But before it comes to a settle
ment Bonn and Pai'is should ask
themselves whether they are pre
pared to exercise the leadership
of the Western alliance. On Euro
pean questions they can have that
leadership if they can carry the
burden of it.
It is not something that Ameri
cans want for the sake of pres
tige. The leadership of Western
Europe is a heavy burden which
Americans have been carrying
since the second World War be
cause no one else has thus far
been able to carry it.
The basic fact is that the de
fense of West Berlin, of West
ern Germany, ami of metro
politan France, depends upon
the United States. The German
forces and the French forces
are a screen and a tripwire.
But that is all they are.
On this country rests the whole
responsibilty for deterring the
use of force in Central Europe,
and of waging the war if it comes
