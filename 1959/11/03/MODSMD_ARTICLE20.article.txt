# The 						Trouble with Tuesday

... Is that the night before
the Daily never has a night
editor.
Jim Robertson, Fundamental
Standard Commission chairman,
appeared to be speaking quite im
pulsively last week when he told
a Daily reporter, "If the students
don't want the Fundamental
Standard, let's give 'em a set of
rules right now. Let's give people
the protection they need."
The Commission, since its be
ginning, has considered the prob
lem posed by the changing con
ditions of society—a relaxation of
this "rule" and that. Off and on
the Commission has been criti
cized for failing to come up with
something concrete as a defini
tion for the Fundamental Stand
ard.
The problem with something
concrete is that we would either
find ourselves repeating the laws
and customs of society in gen
eral, or setting up our own code
of law, probably extremely more
limited than that of society.
Robertson commented that
thefts from the men's dorms
have increased considerably.
He also cited the case of the
student whose hearing was
damaged by firecrackers. To
counter these events he pro
poses setting up rules.
I suggest that we already have
plenty of rules to cover such sit
uations. Just because the Funda
mental Standard is not strictly de
fined to prohibit thefts, does this
mean there are no such restric
tions on campus? Just because
the Fundamental Standard does
not say "Thou shalt not throw
firecrackers and injure someone's
hearing," does this mean we have
free reign to throw firecrackers
wherever and whenever we
please?
Stanford mny be for many an
ivory tower type of existence, but
we are not isolated from nor
exempt from the laws of ihe
state. And certainly we are not
completely exempt from hu
manity.
I suggest that the Fundamental
Standard means that we obey the
laws of the state, as well as ob
serve the courtesies of one man
to another. It means that we fol

low the conduct expected of a
good citizen anywhere and that
we have no unique code of citizen
ship.
To be sure there are unique
situations in u residence cam
pus like Stanford. Probably too
many of these are covered by
specific regulations, but at any
rate Ihere are plenty of rules
which would answer Robert
son's problem.
The other suggestion made by
the Fundamental Standard Com
mission chairman is that it might
be necessary lo police the cam
pus more thoi»ughly to prevent
thefts.
Some communities use police
power to enforce their laws.
There is no question that there
are a number of sources of
punishment at Stanford after a
law has been broken: Judicial
Council, the Dean, county, state
and federal courts, if necessary.
But preventive measures are more
difficult, as communities in gen
eral have found. It would be pos
sible to increase the police force
(and tuition) and provide night
watchmen all over campus.
Hopefully, however, there are
enough people on this campus
to whom most of the aspects
of good citizenship and the
Fundamental Standard come
unconsciously. Most people
don't steal from the men's
dorms. Most don't throw fire
crackers at one another.
Robertson says those who don't
need protection against those
who do. I suggest that if those
who don't knew more about what
was happening—the hearing in
jury, the thefts if they realized
that their majority was growing
smaller—they would be able to
do something about it themselves.
Social pressure can be for good
or evil, but will not be at all
unless there is some knowledge
of need.
The silence which surrounds
the actions of our councils does
not contribute to the improve
ment of the situation. We don't
want our actions based on fear of
reprisal, but we don't need furth
er protection, when we can pro
tect ourselves, as I suggest we
can do.
