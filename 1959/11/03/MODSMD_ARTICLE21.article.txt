# Yell Leader Candidates Tell Campaign Stories
## 
### 
As a candidate for head yell
yeader, I believe I possess the
necessary qualifications for this
office. I am well educated (the
only student at Stanford to com
plete the Western Civ series in
nine quarters) and reasonably
humorous (I stayed alter school
for a month in the fourth grade
for telling off-color stories).
If elected, 1 will make the fol
lowing changes and additions to
the present system: replace the
Stanford Band with the Kingston
Trio; bring Kim Novak, Gina Lol
labrigida, Tina Louise, Eva Marie
Saint and May Britt to campus
for duty as pom pon girls; use
Lili St. Cyr and her celebrated
bathtub routine for a halftime
show; locate kegs of beer in
strategic positions in the student
section; supply air rifles with
which to pepper little kids; hire
a judo instructor for yell leaders
(to cope with USC fans); and
make the Big Game Bonfire a
funeral pyre for local teenage
hoods.

It has been my pleasure while
at Stanford to witness an un
believable string of moral vic
tories. There are times when I
wish we were a little more vic
torious and a little less moral.
That's where the head yell leader
comes in, so to speak.
One of the higgest problems in
leading a rooting section com
posed of Stanford men and girls,
so to speak, is to keep the yells
at a sufficiently lewdificatious
level to allow the men to gratify
their inner need for . . ~ so If)
speak, and yet to keep the female
section and the Dean pacifed.
To pacify the Dean, I propose
putting him in the women's root
ing section. To pacify the female
section, put them in Ihe men's
rooting secton. To satisfy the
men, let them play football on the
field. Now let the team move up
stairs to a positon of authority
in the Dean's Office. Then the
team can throw me out and I'll
go home and kick the cat, so to
speak.
In all justice, I feel that there
is only one candidate for the posi
ton. However, I hope you'll for
get about justice this time and
vote for me for yead hell leader
(sic), so to speak.

I feel that now is the moment
for my thoughts on the Rowdy
Function. There is no doubt that
the true proponent of this phi
losophy, a vanishing man, is an
artist and should not feel the in
hibitions of the church, the state,
or the family in his expression.
Public sentiment too has no place
in his life. One of the last of the
great unfettered is Rich Carling
house.
But if you want not a manne
quin but Rich Garlinghouse
thrown from a plane, it shall be
done!
Finally, Rich and I are run
ning together as a working team.
If elected, 1 will fulfill the duties
demanded by the legislature, but
from Rich will come the initia
tive and direction for the office.
A vote for Symonds, then, is a
vote for Garlinghouse.
