Disagreement
Editor, Tlie Daily:
It is unforlunato that The
Daily was so hasty in its evalua
tion of the Ford Foundation
award-wining play, "The Moon
Besieged." Most Stanford students
are not drama critics, but they
are able to evaluale from their
degree of enjoyment the over-all
merit of a production.
The Daily, by its bombastic
headline of "Flop," has labeled
this production, in the eyes of
many students, as not worthy of
their time and money. Perhaps
the critic should see the play
again, as student opinion in many
quarters does not seem to agree
with the Daily evaluation.
