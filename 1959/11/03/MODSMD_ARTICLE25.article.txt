Parking Fees
Kriitnr, The Daily:
Thpro is question that the $10
parking fee (and since you may
park if and only if you register,
it doesn't matter whether you call
it a parking or registration fee)
applied uniformly to all car own
ers is unfair.
But, as the University correct
ly asserts, the bookkeeping neces
sary for any alternative would be
prohibitively expensive.
It's a simple matter, however,
to have the University itself pay
the difference between $10 and
what the individual feels is fair.
Since I graduated I have an
nually been requested to give to
keep LSJU going. I have given
in the past, and will continue to
give less parking expenses.
