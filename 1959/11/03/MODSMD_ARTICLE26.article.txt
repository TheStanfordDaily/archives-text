Wins Around the Corner
It looks like at last Old Mr. Sun is mining out from behind that
dark eloud as Stanford gridders may have finally eonvineed them
selves that thoy can score nearly anytime they want to. Now it
seems that they will have to regain some of their early season
tackling polish for as soon as State hacks Oneal Cuterry or Emniett
Lee found that they were bottled up on one side of the field all
they had to do was reverse their running and come back to the other
side making yardage and causing a lot of anguish for coaches and

specialors atiKe.
Key injuries to back Dick
Bowers and tackle Phil Burkland
may have hurt the Tribe's de
fensive efforts.
However both »lack Gordon and
Trev Grimm filled in well for
the injured Burkland and many
Tribe lineman and defensive
backs could hold Spartan backs
only to suffer from momentary
lapses which caused the 38 Spar
tan points. Needless to say the
Tribe will have to come up in de
fense against the invading Uclans
this weekend. The Bruins have
as many elusive backs and one
hard-running fullback named Ray
Smith who doesn't give up too
easily.
One very bright spot — besides
the obvious clicking of Dick Nor
man's passing machine was the
Tribe running attack. Stanford's
running which has been usually
laughed at in the past—gained 16
first downs and 124 total yards.
Card end sweeps with Skin Face

and Archie Sclimitt carrying the hall accounted for two thirds of the
yardage. This was due to good blocking as many times blocks by the
pulling guards, Gil Dowel, Face or Mac Wylie would spring Card backs
lose for ten yards before a white shirted Spartan could catch them.
Face gained 82 yards and ended up with 15 points for the afternon.
"Speedy" Schmitt rolled off 77 for a seven yard per carry average.
And of course, those 54 points look very nice to players and fans
alike. The last time Stanford grid fans saw that big score under Stan
ford on the scoreboard was in 1953 when Ail-American quarterback
Hobby Garrett was throwing to ends Sam Morely another All-Ameri
can and John Steinberg.
Good Old Days
The 1953 grid season was quite a year for Card fans and in many
ways can be compared to this year. Garrett to Morely or Steinberg
sel many passing records and there was Ernie Horn to carry the ball
on occasions. 1953 was a year which saw the Tribe compile a 6-3-1
record. The highlight of the season was a 21-20 defeat over the UCLA
Bruins—led by Paul Cameron that year and who eventaully went
on to the Rose Bowl. That year, fresh off their 54-0 defeat of San
Jose, they went on to beat the Bruins a much tougher ball club then
than now—and now I'm sure the football squad is hoping that His
tory will repeat itself.
Up Berkeley way we see that USC is not possibly as tough as every
body thinks—at least score-wise—as the Cal Bears came out on the 7-
14 short end. However if not improving their toughness in score at
least a few members of the Troy Zoo are furthering their fistic ca
reers. Mighty Mike McKeever, of SC twin fame, is out to break all
records in being thrown out of football games. He is personally
"credited" by Bear Coach Pete Elliot of injuring both halfback Steve
Bates and QB Pete Olson. McKeever showed his versatility after hit
ling Stanford center Doug PurseII with a right two weekends ago.
He came back strong last Saturday in using a left against Cal's Olson
and a right elbow when he jumped on Bates. Equally prominent in
Ihe race for King Toughy from Troy is back Jim Conroy who tried
to keep up with McKeever with a fine kick to the face of Cal guard
Don Piestrup.
As the second half of the season gets underway, this writer recom
mends following the Trojans to find out who wins the Toughy award.
All Card fans and cheerleaders are no doubt glad to be back on the
Farm watching ball games free to worry only about water balloons
and flying cards—not to fear the surging mob from Troy.

Wins Around the Corner
It looks like at last Old Mr. Sun is mining out from behind that
dark eloud as Stanford gridders may have finally eonvineed them
selves that thoy can score nearly anytime they want to. Now it
seems that they will have to regain some of their early season
tackling polish for as soon as State hacks Oneal Cuterry or Emniett
Lee found that they were bottled up on one side of the field all
they had to do was reverse their running and come back to the other
side making yardage and causing a lot of anguish for coaches and

specialors atiKe.
Key injuries to back Dick
Bowers and tackle Phil Burkland
may have hurt the Tribe's de
fensive efforts.
However both »lack Gordon and
Trev Grimm filled in well for
the injured Burkland and many
Tribe lineman and defensive
backs could hold Spartan backs
only to suffer from momentary
lapses which caused the 38 Spar
tan points. Needless to say the
Tribe will have to come up in de
fense against the invading Uclans
this weekend. The Bruins have
as many elusive backs and one
hard-running fullback named Ray
Smith who doesn't give up too
easily.
One very bright spot — besides
the obvious clicking of Dick Nor
man's passing machine was the
Tribe running attack. Stanford's
running which has been usually
laughed at in the past—gained 16
first downs and 124 total yards.
Card end sweeps with Skin Face

and Archie Sclimitt carrying the hall accounted for two thirds of the
yardage. This was due to good blocking as many times blocks by the
pulling guards, Gil Dowel, Face or Mac Wylie would spring Card backs
lose for ten yards before a white shirted Spartan could catch them.
Face gained 82 yards and ended up with 15 points for the afternon.
"Speedy" Schmitt rolled off 77 for a seven yard per carry average.
And of course, those 54 points look very nice to players and fans
alike. The last time Stanford grid fans saw that big score under Stan
ford on the scoreboard was in 1953 when Ail-American quarterback
Hobby Garrett was throwing to ends Sam Morely another All-Ameri
can and John Steinberg.
Good Old Days
The 1953 grid season was quite a year for Card fans and in many
ways can be compared to this year. Garrett to Morely or Steinberg
sel many passing records and there was Ernie Horn to carry the ball
on occasions. 1953 was a year which saw the Tribe compile a 6-3-1
record. The highlight of the season was a 21-20 defeat over the UCLA
Bruins—led by Paul Cameron that year and who eventaully went
on to the Rose Bowl. That year, fresh off their 54-0 defeat of San
Jose, they went on to beat the Bruins a much tougher ball club then
than now—and now I'm sure the football squad is hoping that His
tory will repeat itself.
Up Berkeley way we see that USC is not possibly as tough as every
body thinks—at least score-wise—as the Cal Bears came out on the 7-
14 short end. However if not improving their toughness in score at
least a few members of the Troy Zoo are furthering their fistic ca

on occasions. 1953 was a year which saw the Tribe compile a 6-3-1
record. The highlight of the season was a 21-20 defeat over the UCLA
Bruins—led by Paul Cameron that year and who eventaully went
on to the Rose Bowl. That year, fresh off their 54-0 defeat of San
Jose, they went on to beat the Bruins a much tougher ball club then
than now—and now I'm sure the football squad is hoping that His
tory will repeat itself.
Up Berkeley way we see that USC is not possibly as tough as every
body thinks—at least score-wise—as the Cal Bears came out on the 7-
14 short end. However if not improving their toughness in score at
least a few members of the Troy Zoo are furthering their fistic ca
reers. Mighty Mike McKeever, of SC twin fame, is out to break all
records in being thrown out of football games. He is personally
"credited" by Bear Coach Pete Elliot of injuring both halfback Steve
Bates and QB Pete Olson. McKeever showed his versatility after hit
ling Stanford center Doug PurseII with a right two weekends ago.
He came back strong last Saturday in using a left against Cal's Olson
and a right elbow when he jumped on Bates. Equally prominent in
Ihe race for King Toughy from Troy is back Jim Conroy who tried
to keep up with McKeever with a fine kick to the face of Cal guard
Don Piestrup.
As the second half of the season gets underway, this writer recom
mends following the Trojans to find out who wins the Toughy award.
All Card fans and cheerleaders are no doubt glad to be back on the
Farm watching ball games free to worry only about water balloons
and flying cards—not to fear the surging mob from Troy.

Wins Around the Corner
It looks like at last Old Mr. Sun is mining out from behind that
dark eloud as Stanford gridders may have finally eonvineed them
selves that thoy can score nearly anytime they want to. Now it
seems that they will have to regain some of their early season
tackling polish for as soon as State hacks Oneal Cuterry or Emniett
Lee found that they were bottled up on one side of the field all
they had to do was reverse their running and come back to the other
side making yardage and causing a lot of anguish for coaches and

specialors atiKe.
Key injuries to back Dick
Bowers and tackle Phil Burkland
may have hurt the Tribe's de
fensive efforts.
However both »lack Gordon and
Trev Grimm filled in well for
the injured Burkland and many
Tribe lineman and defensive
backs could hold Spartan backs
only to suffer from momentary
lapses which caused the 38 Spar
tan points. Needless to say the
Tribe will have to come up in de
fense against the invading Uclans
this weekend. The Bruins have
as many elusive backs and one
hard-running fullback named Ray
Smith who doesn't give up too
easily.
One very bright spot — besides
the obvious clicking of Dick Nor
man's passing machine was the
Tribe running attack. Stanford's
running which has been usually
laughed at in the past—gained 16
first downs and 124 total yards.
Card end sweeps with Skin Face

and Archie Sclimitt carrying the hall accounted for two thirds of the
yardage. This was due to good blocking as many times blocks by the
pulling guards, Gil Dowel, Face or Mac Wylie would spring Card backs
lose for ten yards before a white shirted Spartan could catch them.
Face gained 82 yards and ended up with 15 points for the afternon.
"Speedy" Schmitt rolled off 77 for a seven yard per carry average.
And of course, those 54 points look very nice to players and fans
alike. The last time Stanford grid fans saw that big score under Stan
ford on the scoreboard was in 1953 when Ail-American quarterback
Hobby Garrett was throwing to ends Sam Morely another All-Ameri
can and John Steinberg.
