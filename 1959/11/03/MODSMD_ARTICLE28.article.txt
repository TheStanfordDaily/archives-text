jured and unsick team on the

and Cal at Berkeley Saturday.
The triangular score read Stan
ford 31, SC 38, Cal 48. The In
dians won in dual scoring too as
they took Cal 23-32 and SC 26-29.
The Tribe win can be wholly
credited to the recovery of Keith
Wallace and Hob Monzingo from
achile's heel trouble and the flu
respectively.

ond and third places in the meet
finishing behind Cal speedster
Alan Gaylord. Gaylord's winning

and take the race.
First finished for the Trojans

was Fernando Leon who took the
fourth slot for a 20:16 effort.
Bertil Lundh finished eighth for
the Indians and Bob Holgerson
and Rich Klier came in 18th and
19th out of the 21 man field.
Jordan said that the results
of the meet only proved his con
tention that as long as the Cards
run up to their potential they are
the best team Stanford has had.
The biggest problem the squad
faces is still to keep a full team
on the field and to have them all
feeling and running up to par.
The next meet for the thinclads
is against UCLA and Cal this
Saturday on the Stanford home
home course.
