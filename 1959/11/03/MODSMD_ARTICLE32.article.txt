# Stanford Drops SC Polo Match
## 
### 
The moment the gold water I
polo hall hit the water il was!
grabbed by a Trojan and kept in I
ihe possession of his teammates.'
being relinquished only for brief
intervals while SC practiced de
fense. The result was a crushing
31-6 defeat for the Indians last
Friday in the men's pool.
The defeat this weekend was
even worse than the 27-7 defeat
I suffered a week before at the
hands of the Trojans.
Big gun for the Trojans was
Chuck Bittick, a big backstroker
off of the swim team, who scored
nine points. Neither the Stanford
guards nor the goal guard could
stop his powerful throws a« he
often scored from as far out as
20 feet.
Occasional amusement for the

discouraged Stanford fans was
provided by SC's H u ng a r i a n
guard Gabor Nagy who delighted
in performing seal antics with
the ball while completely befud
dling the inexperienced Stanford
men surrounding him.
Andy Schwarz saved the In
dians from complete disgrace as
he came through after the half
with two excellent exhibitions of
scoring and, aided by Bob Spence
whose strong arm put two points
through the net, scored all but
one of Stanford's goals.
Next Saturday the UCLA
Bruins play the Indian poloists al
Stanford at 10 a.m.
Score by quarters:
12 3 4
SC 7 7 9 B—3l
