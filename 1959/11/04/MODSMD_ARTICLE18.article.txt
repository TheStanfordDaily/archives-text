# Fundamental Standard
## 
### 
Concirn lias again been raised about I lit* value and future of the
Fundamental Standard at Stanford. A rise in eriininal incidents
on campus over the pa I lew vears and a seeming wave of student
indifference toward the Standard are the primary causes of lliis
concern.
Spokesmen for Men's C.ouneil and Fundamental Standard and
Honor (lode Commission have said that perhaps Fun Stan is over
the hill that it may be time to depend on more than conscience
as a supplement to normal law enforcement.
\\ e can see little point in merely righteously preaching the
merits of Fun Stan in an effort to gain new support for it. And
we're glad to see that this sort of approach isn t being used by the
council and commission.
Hut one method of gaining respect and support for fun Stan
which we believe is being neglected is a streamlining of the stand
ard.
There has too often been, we believe, a preoccupation of the
standard with trivia. Coincidental with concern about the stand
ard has come a recent example of these tri\ia:
Stanford women ha\e been informed that it is a Fundamental
Standard violation to go to sleep iu a car. In other words, il a
woman should doze oil while driving back with her date I rum San
Francisco, she's violated Fun Stan.
Women iu Fagunita and Moore, and probably other living
groups, are laughing out loud at I his latest regulation. And its not
hard to imagine their laughter and ridicule spreading to the stand
ard as a whole.
We appreciate the concern for Fun Stan's future. And we don't
want to see Yale-style plainclothesmen patrolling the dorms,,ei
ther.
But we believe that for Fun Stan to earn its support, its appli
cation should be limited to items of legitimate concern, not to every
move (even in sleep) a student may make.
