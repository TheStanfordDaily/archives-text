Comes a time in the quarter be
tween mid-terms and term papers
when we can take a deep breath,
relax, and forget (for a day or
two) the cares of the "student."
And this gap needn't be empty
thanks to the many current at
tractions in the entertainment
field up and down the Peninsula.
At the Loft. Theater, Emer
son at Hamilton, in Palo Alto,
Comedia opened its production
of Tennessee Williams' "CAT
ON A HOT TIN HOOF" last
weekend.
Produced by Peter Kump and

directed by Philip Schultz, the
three-act drama carries all of the
tension that Williams could want
or the audience can take.
In the title role of Maggie the
Cat, Belinda Rose, who appeared
here last year in "Pal Joey," gives
an effective performance. Carry
ing the first act alone, which is
primarily Maggie's, would be a
job for any actress, but Miss Rose
does it successfully with skill
and feeling.
Characterizing Big Daddy with
a more philosophical nature
than the Burl Ives portrayal,
Mark Hammer does an excel
lent job in the role. Hammer,
who has written many scripts
for Ram's Head shows as well
as acted in Stanford produc
tions in recent years, skillfully
integrates the pathos and hum
or of the role and powerfully
brings Big Daddy to life.
Another fine acting job was
done by Lynn Boatsman as Big
Mama. Mac was effectively played
by Nancy Smith, appropriately
dislikeable as Sister Woman with
her five "no-necked monsters."
Although the production is a
little long, the play it self is long
and the tension generated holds
throughout the three acts.

Complete with "guilt-scroll"
bedstead, the production, which
is the play's first off-Broadway
showing in the Bay Area, is
sure to further Comedia's al
ready-high reputation. Perform
ances are scheduled for Friday
nights at 8:80 p.m.
Another Comedia production,
"Where's Charley," is playing
Saturday nights at the Loft
Theater, and Kenneth Patchen's
play "Don't Look Now," which
opened last week, continues this
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
nights at the Troupe Theater,
612 High St reel in Paly.
At the Peninsula Little The
ater, 1800 El Camino in San Ma
teo, "Summer of the Seventeenth
Doll," a new play by Australian
playwright .Ray Lawler will be
presented Friday and Saturday at
8:30 p.m. Tickets are $1.50, ob
tainable by calling LYtell 3-4171.
In San Francisco, the Actor's
Workshop production of George
Hitchcock's "THE BUSY MAR
TYR" continues its run Thurs
day through Saturday nights
till the end of this month at
the Encore Theater, 40 Mason.
This satiric comedy centers
around a discouraged writer who
in order to gain recognition and
fame spends all his time confes
sing to crimes he didn't commit.
A prologue set in the present day
takes the audience back to a small
French town in 1890 where all
sorts of delightful characters ap
pear to complicate the "martyr"
efforts.
Bright and entertaining, the
show now is offering a special
student rate of $1.50 for iho
Thursday performances. Regular
rates are $1.85 and $2.75.
Dance lovers are in for a
treat this weekend with four

BELINDA ROSE
Plays Maggie the Cat
Comes a time in the quarter be
tween mid-terms and term papers
when we can take a deep breath,
relax, and forget (for a day or
two) the cares of the "student."
And this gap needn't be empty
thanks to the many current at
tractions in the entertainment
field up and down the Peninsula.
At the Loft. Theater, Emer
son at Hamilton, in Palo Alto,
Comedia opened its production
of Tennessee Williams' "CAT
ON A HOT TIN HOOF" last
weekend.
Produced by Peter Kump and

directed by Philip Schultz, the
three-act drama carries all of the
tension that Williams could want
or the audience can take.
In the title role of Maggie the
Cat, Belinda Rose, who appeared
here last year in "Pal Joey," gives
an effective performance. Carry
ing the first act alone, which is
primarily Maggie's, would be a
job for any actress, but Miss Rose
does it successfully with skill
and feeling.
Characterizing Big Daddy with
a more philosophical nature
than the Burl Ives portrayal,
Mark Hammer does an excel
lent job in the role. Hammer,
who has written many scripts
for Ram's Head shows as well
as acted in Stanford produc
tions in recent years, skillfully
integrates the pathos and hum
or of the role and powerfully
brings Big Daddy to life.
Another fine acting job was
done by Lynn Boatsman as Big
Mama. Mac was effectively played
by Nancy Smith, appropriately
dislikeable as Sister Woman with
her five "no-necked monsters."
Although the production is a
little long, the play it self is long
and the tension generated holds
throughout the three acts.

Complete with "guilt-scroll"
bedstead, the production, which
is the play's first off-Broadway
showing in the Bay Area, is
sure to further Comedia's al
ready-high reputation. Perform
ances are scheduled for Friday
nights at 8:80 p.m.
Another Comedia production,
"Where's Charley," is playing
Saturday nights at the Loft
Theater, and Kenneth Patchen's
play "Don't Look Now," which
opened last week, continues this
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
nights at the Troupe Theater,
612 High St reel in Paly.
At the Peninsula Little The
ater, 1800 El Camino in San Ma
teo, "Summer of the Seventeenth
Doll," a new play by Australian
playwright .Ray Lawler will be
presented Friday and Saturday at
8:30 p.m. Tickets are $1.50, ob
tainable by calling LYtell 3-4171.
In San Francisco, the Actor's
Workshop production of George
Hitchcock's "THE BUSY MAR
TYR" continues its run Thurs
day through Saturday nights
till the end of this month at
the Encore Theater, 40 Mason.
This satiric comedy centers
around a discouraged writer who
in order to gain recognition and
fame spends all his time confes
sing to crimes he didn't commit.
A prologue set in the present day
takes the audience back to a small
French town in 1890 where all
sorts of delightful characters ap
pear to complicate the "martyr"
efforts.
Bright and entertaining, the
show now is offering a special
student rate of $1.50 for iho
Thursday performances. Regular
rates are $1.85 and $2.75.
Dance lovers are in for a
treat this weekend with four

BELINDA ROSE
Plays Maggie the Cat
Comes a time in the quarter be
tween mid-terms and term papers
when we can take a deep breath,
relax, and forget (for a day or
two) the cares of the "student."
And this gap needn't be empty
thanks to the many current at
tractions in the entertainment
field up and down the Peninsula.
At the Loft. Theater, Emer
son at Hamilton, in Palo Alto,
Comedia opened its production
of Tennessee Williams' "CAT
ON A HOT TIN HOOF" last
weekend.
Produced by Peter Kump and

directed by Philip Schultz, the
three-act drama carries all of the
tension that Williams could want
or the audience can take.
In the title role of Maggie the
Cat, Belinda Rose, who appeared
here last year in "Pal Joey," gives
an effective performance. Carry
ing the first act alone, which is
primarily Maggie's, would be a
job for any actress, but Miss Rose
does it successfully with skill
and feeling.
Characterizing Big Daddy with
a more philosophical nature
than the Burl Ives portrayal,
Mark Hammer does an excel
lent job in the role. Hammer,
who has written many scripts
for Ram's Head shows as well
as acted in Stanford produc
tions in recent years, skillfully
integrates the pathos and hum
or of the role and powerfully
brings Big Daddy to life.
Another fine acting job was
done by Lynn Boatsman as Big
Mama. Mac was effectively played
by Nancy Smith, appropriately
dislikeable as Sister Woman with
her five "no-necked monsters."
Although the production is a
little long, the play it self is long
and the tension generated holds
throughout the three acts.

Complete with "guilt-scroll"
bedstead, the production, which
is the play's first off-Broadway
showing in the Bay Area, is
sure to further Comedia's al
ready-high reputation. Perform
ances are scheduled for Friday
nights at 8:80 p.m.
Another Comedia production,
"Where's Charley," is playing
Saturday nights at the Loft
Theater, and Kenneth Patchen's
play "Don't Look Now," which
opened last week, continues this
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
nights at the Troupe Theater,
612 High St reel in Paly.
At the Peninsula Little The
ater, 1800 El Camino in San Ma
teo, "Summer of the Seventeenth
Doll," a new play by Australian
playwright .Ray Lawler will be
presented Friday and Saturday at
8:30 p.m. Tickets are $1.50, ob
tainable by calling LYtell 3-4171.
In San Francisco, the Actor's
Workshop production of George
Hitchcock's "THE BUSY MAR
TYR" continues its run Thurs
day through Saturday nights
till the end of this month at
the Encore Theater, 40 Mason.
This satiric comedy centers
around a discouraged writer who
in order to gain recognition and
fame spends all his time confes
sing to crimes he didn't commit.
A prologue set in the present day
takes the audience back to a small
French town in 1890 where all
sorts of delightful characters ap
pear to complicate the "martyr"
efforts.
Bright and entertaining, the
show now is offering a special
student rate of $1.50 for iho
Thursday performances. Regular
rates are $1.85 and $2.75.
Dance lovers are in for a
treat this weekend with four
separate and varied programs
