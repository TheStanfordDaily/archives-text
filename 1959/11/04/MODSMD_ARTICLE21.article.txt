Foreign News
Editor, The Daily:
Perhaps a more important is
sue than the foreign student col
umn is the lack of national and !
foreign news coverage in The
Daily. This is a weakness of j
American newspapers generally,
but The Daily is as blinkered as
Pravda.
First, let us have some more !
NEWS. Then, second, let people ;
willing to comment upon these:
matters, whether American or j
foreign students, have some
chance to avail themselves oi
your letter column.
Judging by tho content of the
Daily material, few students j
other than tho lIR group seem to
be interested in foreign affairs.
Conversation with student's
here generally seems to give an
opposite and more favorable im-!
pression. Perhaps The Daily is j
underestimating the interest and |
intelligence of its readers?

Editor, The Daily:
My thanks to Mr. Freeman,
who is "Campus Co • ordinator,
Acts for Peace" (believe it or
nol), and to Mr. Green for in
forming me of their inability to
understand my letter in Tues
day's Daily. The tone of their let
ters indicates they did not try
very hard.
Due to the merciless scram
bling they gave to my words to
make me sound like a warmon
ger, it is evident they missed my
point: that the important distin"-
tion is between an unconditional
pacifism, which is ignoble, and a
legitimate aspiration to a just
peace, which is noble.
The pacifist dqctrine does not
preach a just peace, for it neces
sarily teaches submission. And
submission will not bring the
physical relief the pacifist antici

pates: the inhumanity of war is
slight up against the horrors a
pacifist submission would bestow
upon us -witness the documenta
tion of the 25 million atrocities
committed by Communists, nol
.1 gainst combatants in hostile
lands, but against civilians in sub
missive lands.
The path presently being pur
sued by the West is tenuous,
rocky and difficult; but it is not
intolerable, as is ihe path of sub
mission the pacifists press upon
us.
To Ihose who are capable of
comprehending a peace without a
simultaneous abdication of hu
man dignity, and to those who see
peace in slavery as a meaningless
concept, there are words of con
solation: Peace can spring from
a base of love, charity, faith and,
most important, hope.
There must he more to our
lives than the dooming submis
sion willed upon us by Messrs.
CJreen and Freeman. Only with
out the hqpe of which they de
prive us are-wo lost. . . .

Perhaps a more important is
sue than the foreign student col
umn is the lack of national and !
foreign news coverage in The
Daily. This is a weakness of j
American newspapers generally,
but The Daily is as blinkered as
Pravda.
First, let us have some more !
NEWS. Then, second, let people ;
willing to comment upon these:
matters, whether American or j
foreign students, have some
chance to avail themselves oi
your letter column.
Judging by tho content of the
Daily material, few students j
other than tho lIR group seem to
be interested in foreign affairs.
Conversation with student's
here generally seems to give an
opposite and more favorable im-!
pression. Perhaps The Daily is j
underestimating the interest and |
intelligence of its readers?

Editor, The Daily:
My thanks to Mr. Freeman,
who is "Campus Co • ordinator,
Acts for Peace" (believe it or
nol), and to Mr. Green for in
forming me of their inability to
understand my letter in Tues
day's Daily. The tone of their let
ters indicates they did not try
very hard.
Due to the merciless scram
bling they gave to my words to
make me sound like a warmon
ger, it is evident they missed my
point: that the important distin"-
tion is between an unconditional
pacifism, which is ignoble, and a
legitimate aspiration to a just
peace, which is noble.
The pacifist dqctrine does not
preach a just peace, for it neces
sarily teaches submission. And
submission will not bring the
physical relief the pacifist antici

pates: the inhumanity of war is
slight up against the horrors a
pacifist submission would bestow
upon us -witness the documenta
tion of the 25 million atrocities
committed by Communists, nol
.1 gainst combatants in hostile
lands, but against civilians in sub
missive lands.
The path presently being pur
sued by the West is tenuous,
rocky and difficult; but it is not
intolerable, as is ihe path of sub
mission the pacifists press upon
us.
To Ihose who are capable of
comprehending a peace without a
simultaneous abdication of hu
man dignity, and to those who see
peace in slavery as a meaningless
concept, there are words of con
solation: Peace can spring from
a base of love, charity, faith and,
most important, hope.
There must he more to our
lives than the dooming submis
sion willed upon us by Messrs.
CJreen and Freeman. Only with
