### Rich Sundeen ASSU President 
A controversy has arisen this
week as to whether a student of
sophomore standing should be
able to run for Head Cheer
Leader.
Presently, ASSU by-laws
state that Head Cheer Leader
candidates . . must have com
pleted at least seventy-five
units, or five quarters . . . al
the time of election." (Art. IX,
Sec. 1, Para. Si.)
Thursday night, after having
been declared ineligible, a student
of sophomore standing appealed
his case to Legislature through
ihc Elections Commission chair
man.
Legislature was asked to enable
a sophomore to run for Head
Cheer Leader. Reasoning behind
the appeal appears to stem from
last year's by-law change, when
election time of Ihe Head Cheer
Leader was switched from spring
lo fall quarter.
The spokesman for the soph
omore pointed out that hist
year's Legislature simply over
looked altering the requirement
to concur with tlie elections
time, and that it should read
that only three quarters must
he completed in order to run for
the office.
By ruling out sophomores the
by-law virtually limits the candi
dacy for Head Cheer Leader to
only students with junior class

| standing, or seniors who are plan
i ning to attend school a fifth year.
Thus, the representative asked
' the Legislature to cons i d e r
j amending the by-laws pertaining
to the Head Cheer Leader require
j ments in order to correct last
year's "oversight." Legislature
declined to act upon the problem.
One of the main reasons it
did not act was thai it was too
late. In order to amend by-laws,
the proposed amendment must
he read or brought up at two
regular meetings of Legislature
—the vote being taken at the
second meeting.
Since elections were scheduled
before the next regular meeting,
lo have proposed a by-law change
would have been to no avail.
Besides the time element, Leg
islature also considered two other
factors. Many felt that the silence
of last year's Legislature cannot
be interpreted necessarily as an
oversight.
Perhaps last year's members,
| realizing its implications, saw
no need in changing Ihe by-law
nor in making mention of it.
As to the limiting aspects of
the by-law as it now stands, it
was pointed out that, although
previously third quarter sopho
mores could run for the office,
the Head Cheer Leader never
held office until his junior year.
: And this situation still remains
I under the existing by-law.

—the vote being taken at the

Since elections were scheduled
before the next regular meeting,
lo have proposed a by-law change
would have been to no avail.
Besides the time element, Leg
islature also considered two other
factors. Many felt that the silence
of last year's Legislature cannot
be interpreted necessarily as an
oversight.
Perhaps last year's members,
| realizing its implications, saw
no need in changing Ihe by-law
nor in making mention of it.
As to the limiting aspects of
the by-law as it now stands, it
was pointed out that, although
previously third quarter sopho
mores could run for the office,
the Head Cheer Leader never
held office until his junior year.
: And this situation still remains
I under the existing by-law.
A controversy has arisen this
week as to whether a student of
sophomore standing should be
able to run for Head Cheer
Leader.
Presently, ASSU by-laws
state that Head Cheer Leader
candidates . . must have com
pleted at least seventy-five
units, or five quarters . . . al
the time of election." (Art. IX,
Sec. 1, Para. Si.)
Thursday night, after having
been declared ineligible, a student
of sophomore standing appealed
his case to Legislature through
ihc Elections Commission chair
man.
Legislature was asked to enable
a sophomore to run for Head
Cheer Leader. Reasoning behind
the appeal appears to stem from
last year's by-law change, when
election time of Ihe Head Cheer
Leader was switched from spring
lo fall quarter.
The spokesman for the soph
omore pointed out that hist
year's Legislature simply over
looked altering the requirement
to concur with tlie elections
time, and that it should read
that only three quarters must
he completed in order to run for
the office.
By ruling out sophomores the
by-law virtually limits the candi
dacy for Head Cheer Leader to
only students with junior class

| standing, or seniors who are plan
i ning to attend school a fifth year.
Thus, the representative asked
' the Legislature to cons i d e r
j amending the by-laws pertaining
to the Head Cheer Leader require
j ments in order to correct last
year's "oversight." Legislature
declined to act upon the problem.
One of the main reasons it
did not act was thai it was too
late. In order to amend by-laws,
the proposed amendment must
he read or brought up at two
regular meetings of Legislature
—the vote being taken at the
