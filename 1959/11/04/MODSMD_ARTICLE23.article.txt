Mature Liberals
Editor, The Daily:
What do you mean Lofgen,
Freeman and Green cannot com
prehend the subtleties of ihe
Western tradition? Liberals are
mature and learned. Mrs. Roose
velt recently appointed Professor
of International Relations at
Brandeis University. Ex • Presi
dent T r urn an, a distinguished
voice critic and by his own ac
count, the pre-eminent authority
on economic matters, recently re
ceived an honorary degree from
Oxford.
In fact, we have purified educa
tion of all medievalisms (reli
gion. morality, ctc.> and replaced

j ihem with guidance programs.
Some means had to be found to
I adjust the pupils to Doctor Dew
-1 ey's great regime.
Us Liberals got open minds.
We aren't bigoted like you! Why,
Governor Brown's mind was so
open that it spilled all over
! Khrushchev with: "We who like
you, we who admire you, welcome
you." "Pat" knows on which side
of the iron curtain his bread is
' buttered. Us Liberals always see
i the other side!
I personally like Professor Sib
ley, I wish more people would lis—
i ten to him, there would be no
j more war* and I would 1101 have
to fight. Ugh! Me pacifist!
