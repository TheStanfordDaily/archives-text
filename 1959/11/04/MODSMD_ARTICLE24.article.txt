## Bailey Fears Earth Race 
### Barry Greenberg 
"A lot of people are worried
about the race into space between
the U.S. and Russia. I'm more
concerned with the race on earth.
If all the Russians went to the
moon or Mars, 1 would be very
happy."
Such is the opinion of Thomas
Andrew Bailey, professor of his
tory and former Executive Head
of the History Department.
The 57-year-old historian sat
in his tiny office at the top of
History Corner. He wore a green
eyeshade, similar to the type
found adorning the heads of Las
Vegas croupiers.
"If we're lucky, the cold war
is going to last a long time,"
Bailey continued. "It's obviously
going in favor of the Russians
and we had better keep our tech
nological guard up to ward off
any forthcoming blows."
"Of course, let us not forget
Red China," he said, shifting in
his seat. "One of the best cartoons
I've seen in a long while shows
Khrushchev leaving China after
his trip and Mao-Tze-Tung is
whispering to one of his cohorts
as he points at the Russian,
'We'll bury them'."
"It's even conceivable th a t
.Russia and the U.S. will form an
alliance to stop Red China,"
Bailey said. "Nothing is impos
sible."
Bailey is the author of many
books on American Diplomacy.
He has won California Common
wealth Club Gold Medals for
"Woodrow Wilson and the Lost
Peace," printed in 1944. and for
"America Faces Russia," printed
in 1950. He is also a silver medal
recipient for "A Diplomatic His
tory of the American People,"

the sixth edition of which was
printed last year.
Other books are: "Theodore
.Roosevelt and the. Japanese-
American Crisis," 1934; "The Pol
icy <jf the United States Toward
the Neutrals, 1917-18," 1942;
"America's Foreign Policies: Past
and Present," 1943; "Woodrow
Wilson and the Great Betrayal,"
1945; "Wilson the Peacemaker,"
1947; and"The Man on the
Street," 1948.
Bailey is also the author of
"The American Pageant," a his
tory textbook used by 325 col
leges and universities. He is pres
ently working on a book of doc
uments and readings to be used
in conjunction with the textbook.
Born in San Jose, Calif., Bailey

earned his A.li. from Stanford
in 1924, his M.A. in 1925 and his
Ph.D. two years later.
It was the following year while
teaching history al the University
of Hawaii that he met Sylvia
Dean, daughter of the university
president, on a blind date. They
were married soon afterwards.
He was an assistant professor
of history at Stanford from 1930-
35, associate professor from 1935-
40 and a professor from 1940-52.
Since 1952, he has been Execu
tive Head four times, serving as
a professor the other years.
Bailey doesn't spend all of his
time here. He often tours the
country and has lectured at Harv
ard, Cornell, and John Hopkins
universities.
When not teaching, reading, or
writing history, Bailey enjoys
watching sports events. He can
often be found on weekends in
his home on Santa Theresa Street
in front of his television watching
a football or baseball game.
"I was never very good at
sports though," he said. "History
has always been my meat."
