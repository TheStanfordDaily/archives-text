Reverence, stewardship, an d
complete dedication these are
t he qualities of holiness, said the
lit. Reverend Stephen F. Bayne
Jr., in Sunday's All Saints Day
sermon at Memorial Church.
Bishop Bayne, who leaves soon
for London to assume the posi
tion of Anglican Executive Of
ficer, a title referred to as "num
ber two in the Anglican Church,"
was on campus for the weekend
only. A close friend of President
Sterling, Bishop Bayne came from
Washington to help celebrate the
president's tenth anniversary as
well as to keep the invitation to
preach.
The doctrine of sainthood, the
Bishop said, varies in its serious
ness and clarity in our generation,
but it is still expressed in indi
vidual lives. Today the quality of
holiness is believed to be the
quality of a rare few, differing
from the New Testament feeling
that "holiness was what people
were created for."
The "universal vocation" of
sainthood in the New Testament
is now thought of as belonging to
a specific few, but there still
exists a "willingness to accept a
standard higher than we can
achieve," which is the "first root
of holiness."
The second root is the "sense
of the other," said Bishop Bayne.
"Great spirits received life as
«*i gift of God, and accepted it not
in fatalism but in faith." Today
"wo are our own creators—life
is increasingly something we will
manipulate."
The third quality is the sense
of wholeness, the sense of utter

| devotion and dedication. The
theologican compared ihe op
posite of this to going through
old letters from a former sweet
heart—"the sense that what be
longed to you does no longer."
"We are called to be saints,"
Bishop Bayne concluded. "Not in
the sense of 'holier than thou,' not
'little parsonettes,' but we need to
let Christ take over and make of
us what He will."
