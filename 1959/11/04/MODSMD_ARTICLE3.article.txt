### 
WASHINGTON (/I 3 ! The Supreme Court listened yesterday as
government and steel union lawyers debated the legality of a back
to-work order.
There was no indication when the high court may hand down its

law. He also said that Judge Sorg
went too far, and that the in
junction section of the Taft-Hart
ley law is unconstitutional bo
cause it gives too much power to
the courts.
