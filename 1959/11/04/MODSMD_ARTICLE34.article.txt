# Stanford Set for UCLA
## 
### 
Next Saturday the UCLA Bru
ins come a-visitin' in hopes to
I snap out of a two-game losing
! streak against the Stanford foot
j ball squad. The Card gridders —
j fresh after two good games
against SC and San Jose State -
I will be out to win their second
| win in a row and their third of
! t lie year.
The Bruins have lallen down
1 considerably from their 0-0 tie
against Purdue the Hth-ranked
j team in the nation in their open
-1 ing game. Uclan gridders have
only managed to defeat Cal and
have lost to Oregon, Washington
land the Air Force.
Barnes UCLA Isoss
Head coach Billy Barnes leads
j the Bruins this season and is in
his second year at the UCLA
helm taking over from the ail-
I in.n George Dickerspn after the
I third game of the 1958 season.
| Barnes continues the Red Saun
ders single - wing attack which
features a balanced line which
j he learned under the late great
as end coach and chief scout for
UCLA since 1950.
The Bruins are led by fullback
i Ray Smith a co-captain and
tailback Bill Kilmer. Smith is the
I 1 e a d in g ground gainer in the
Bruin attack and has gained 233
! yards net this season lor a 4.1-
j yard average.
Kilmer is the top passer and

punter on the Bruin squad com
pleting 11 for 3f) passes and kick
ing at a respectable 12.81-yard
average and is also Hie loader in
total offense with 108 yards for
the season.
Ilrulns Play Five
Due to the dissolution of the
I'CC. t'C'LA did not have enough
time to fill in its schedule after
quickly dropping some northern
coast teams and so consequently
has played only five games and
has compiled a 1-3-1 win-loss rec
ord.
UCLA will be out to better its
12-IG-1 record in its 29-game sc
ries with the Indians. This series
has been one of the most colorful
in grid history which has seen the
Tribe whip the Bruins 82-0 back

in 1925 and then 29 years later
the Uelans came back to top Ihej
Cards 72-D on that Black Saturday
in the Coliseum in 1954.
Adding color to this Saturday's
clash is the Smith combo on the
UCLA squad which may sec Ray
Smith at lull, spin and hand to
tailback Bob Smith the second
leading ground gainer on the
squad or Skip Smith at wing
back or tailback.
Eine Ooori
Besides Kilmer and the Smiths,
the Bruins expect line work from
their big and aggressive linemen.
Returning lettermen Jack Met
calf and Rod Cochran at guards
rate as tough as any on the coast.
Harry Baldwin at center is an
other Bruin returnee and gar
nered All • Coast m en t i on last
year.
Wingback Gene Gaines has the
speed which is a must in the ef
fective wing - back rover-e plav.
So all in all it looks like Cardinal i
gridders are going to look at a
pretty tough UCLA squad re i
gardless of their record next j
weekend.

The Bruins are led by fullback
i Ray Smith a co-captain and
tailback Bill Kilmer. Smith is the

j yard average.
Kilmer is the top passer and

punter on the Bruin squad com
pleting 11 for 3f) passes and kick

average and is also Hie loader in
total offense with 108 yards for
the season.
Ilrulns Play Five
Due to the dissolution of the
I'CC. t'C'LA did not have enough
time to fill in its schedule after
quickly dropping some northern
coast teams and so consequently
has played only five games and
has compiled a 1-3-1 win-loss rec
ord.
UCLA will be out to better its
12-IG-1 record in its 29-game sc
ries with the Indians. This series
has been one of the most colorful
in grid history which has seen the
Tribe whip the Bruins 82-0 back

in 1925 and then 29 years later
the Uelans came back to top Ihej
Cards 72-D on that Black Saturday
in the Coliseum in 1954.
Adding color to this Saturday's
clash is the Smith combo on the
UCLA squad which may sec Ray
Smith at lull, spin and hand to
tailback Bob Smith the second
leading ground gainer on the
squad or Skip Smith at wing
back or tailback.
Eine Ooori
Besides Kilmer and the Smiths,
the Bruins expect line work from
their big and aggressive linemen.
Returning lettermen Jack Met

rate as tough as any on the coast.
Harry Baldwin at center is an
other Bruin returnee and gar
nered All • Coast m en t i on last

Wingback Gene Gaines has the
speed which is a must in the ef

So all in all it looks like Cardinal i
