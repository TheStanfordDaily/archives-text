I refuse to say anylhing about your friend and mine the West's
most likeable college football player good ol' Mike Mr Keener of
Southern Cal, who kept up his good record last week by putting
California halfback Steve Bates out for the season, was thrown oul
of the game for something else (this makes two straight), lias pro
voked the ire of the Sail Francisco press (and us, too), flatly denied
he was being bad, and has currently pulled ahead in that age-old
contest: "Mike ami Marlin. Which twin is (he dirtiest?"
Now, then, what else is new?
Ridiculous football crowds, for one thing. Soul hern California's
powerful grid team, really big time now that it is free of those small
time northern schools, is having

a heck of a time playing to any
sort of a house.
At Berkeley last week, 37,000
fans watched USC play Cal.
There were 37,500 (many, 1 know,
Boy Senilis I to watch Stanford
play one of its "smallest" (al
though among the wildest > games
of the year with San .lose Slate.
Seems that if it wasn't for
Washington and Stanford there
wouldn't be any sort of major
college attendance in the Big
Five.
College football is definitely on
the rocks in Los Angeles. The
14,000 that turned out last week
for the Slant'ord-Sc game was be
ing looked upon in the Southland
as a pretty fair crowd. This in
contrast to the 1951 Card -SC
(lash which drew 96.000; or the
79,000 that watched the same
teams battle in 1953. Granted,
this year's meeling didn't have
the ltose Bowl-ish aura of those
two classics, but after all this is

one of the Coast's top rivalries. Or it used to be.
t CI,A and Cal sister institutions and old rivals played to a
happy little gathering of 33,000 fans three weeks ago. It might be
encouraging to note that Washington drew that many for its game
with the Bruins last week. But that's a pretty poor draw for a team
that's apparently headed for the Rose Bowl.
Then we have the Los Angeles Itams. They played to two crowds
of more than 75,000 in the past two weeks. And the Rams are hiving
the National Football League's most disappointing season (consider
ing what everyone was expecting of themi. Plainly, the L.A. foot
hall dollar is going to the Itams.
Saturday's Oal-SC crowd leads me to wonder if maybe the Bay
Area's buck isn't going to the pros, too. But 1 will here be so brash
as to say that, weather reasonable, Stanford will host the Big Five's
biggest crowd ever this week for the UCLA game. Forty-five thou
sand would do it.
Look What's Around the (lonicr
Did you know that the score of the Stanford-San -lose season
opening basketball game last December was 57-40? Or care? Any
way, the schools' football teams did darned near as well Saturday.
With just three little old games left in this current football season,
ic is about time to think about roundball, too.
Stanford's hopes of at long last finding some of that basketball
height were shattered before school even started when (5-7 sophomore
Rub llosiey, one of the brightest big man prospects ever to hit the
Farm, suffered a partially broken neck in a surfing accident. Hos
ley's 0-7 co-partner in destruction with last year's Papooses. .John
Windsor, was knocked down by mononucleosis a few weeks back but
should be ready when the season starts.
The bulk of the Tribe hoopers this year should be fairly young
and inexperienced. But the talent is there. All this seems to indicate
that I'm saying something like "Look out next year." That's about
the size of it.
Paul Neumann, of course, is not going to be easily replaced. But
if there was ever anybody who looked like a potential Paul Neu
mann, it was last season's frosh guard, John Fontius. And John may
have even greater physical attributes than Neumann.
Know whom Stanford will be playing in the first round of the
holiday tournament in L.A.'s new auditorium? Just West Virginia
(NCAA runner-up), that's all.
Talk about a couple of guys named Smith. UCLA is crawling
with football-playing Smiths.
Kay Smith, the senior fullback, is the most prominent. He's the
workhorse in the Bruin single wing. Then there is reserve tailback
Skip Smith. And another tailback named Bobby Lee Smith.
Saturday morning at Stanford Stadium there was another Smith.
This was Rob (or Boh i Smith. All told, he personally accounted for
363 yards (rushing, passing, kick returning) in personally dealing
the Papooses their first loss.
