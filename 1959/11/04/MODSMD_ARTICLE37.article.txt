# HERES STANFORD'S AIR ATTACK
## Norman, Sears Lead Quarterbacks 
### 
y
When ono thinks of Stanford football 1959, tho name Dick
Norman immediately comes to mind. Here is the boy the experts
were picking for greatness after his play at the end of last season,
and Dick has certainly made these football scribes look good. Be
hind him are three able replacements: Rod Sears. Jim Smith, and

Joe McAnerney.
Norman at (J'.T and 200 pound*
is built well lor a quarterback
and is one of the finest tacklers
among the backs. However, it is
for his offensive accomplishments
that he is destined to go down as
one of Stanford's all time greats
Currently leading the natior
in total offense and passing, the
amazing junior from Lynwood
has attempted 171 passes and
completed 93 for a fine percent
aye of .534. He has amassed 125.'
yards through the air good foi
nine touchdowns.
Xormaii Showed Promise
Last season Norman alternator
starting assignments with co
caplain Bob Nieolet. While theii
overall performances were .just
about < ven, Norman gave a
warning of things to come in the
Oregon State gatno when he com
pletod 21 ot .'-il passes for 23(i
yards and one 1 o ti c h d o w n .
Against California he fired the
touchdown strike in the closing
minutes thai gave tlit* Cards their
chance to win.
While Dick "has shown the
powerful arm necessary for pass
itig greatness, it lias been his
medium length pass, usually or
the third down "must" situatioi
that has kept the offense moving
Quiet, modest, unassuming
but very aggressive, Dick sal ou
the 1957 season because of th(
abundance of quarterbacks. A
hard worker, he came back a ma
lure young man with inlensi
desire.
Sears Improved
Sophomore Rod Sears has beer
playing behind Norman all yeai
and tho 19-year-old from Pied
rriont has done a good job. Com
plot ing 11 of 23 passes, he ha. l
shown an extreme coolness undo)
pressure. A smart runner with a
lack of real speed, Rod is danger
ous when he take off with the
ball, and lie has developed an ae
curate running toss.
A Physical Education major
Rod is definitely a line quarter
back in I lie making. His inexper
ionee has shown at times on do
fense, but he is improving. He i
considered a fine punter. *
Jim Smith, also a sophomore
was the regular quarterback foi

last year's frosh team. His size
s very much in Jim's favor <ti'3",
891 and ho is just beginning to
•eacli his maturity. The eompoti
ions is tremendous, but Smith
loves the game and possesses a
*ood arm. lie pitched for last
year's freshman baseball team.

completed 93 for a fine percent
aye of .534. He has amassed 125.'
yards through the air good foi
nine touchdowns.

yards and one 1 o ti c h d o w n .
