Plans to open the new Stanford 1
I Post Office at the beginning of
■ winter quarter have received a
| severe blow, according to local
I foreman of mails Henry Quinn.
Quinn reports that the concrete]
! foundation laid to support the
banks of private boxes is too nar
row, and must be torn out. A
j wider concrete foundation will
! then be poured.
Gov't Specifications
The difficulty, it seems, stems
; from a set of government speci-I
■ fications which is used in the con-!
struction of all post offices simi-i
lar to the one now being built
1 here. This design, however, has
| been incorporated into only three
; other post offices in the country,
\ all of which used private boxes of
wood instead of steel.
A six-inch conchete foundation,
: perfectly adequate for the ligh I
wood boxes, will not support steel
boxes which are 15 inches deep.
A 12-inch foundation is being de
manded by the Post Office Do-
I partment.
No Bids
As of yesterday, no bids had j
been let for clearing away the 1
present foundation or pouring a I
new one.
Clyde Griff i t li, foreman of |
the Howard White Company con
j struction crew in charge of build
ing the post office, said that the
! delay is "almost certain" to post
pone opening of the office past
the proposed date.
No new date will be set for the
opening.
