# VA Warns GI's On Loan Liability
## 
### 
A veteran's eligibility for a GI
loan is not restored automatically
when he sells his GI-purchased
home and obtains a VA release
from liability to the Government
I on the loan, according to the VA.
As long as the VA's guaranty
'on the loan is outstanding, no
1 restoration of Gl loan rights can j
I be extended. Even if the loan is j
paifi in full, a veteran is only!
| entitled to another loan when the
property was taken for public
use, destroyed by natural hazard,
or disposed of for reasons con
sidered sufficient by the VA. In
111 is case, veterans should apply
to the nearest VA office for
i restoration of entitlement.
