# Old Heros Replaced By Rebels

### Daryl Glenney 
Because (he goal of today's
novelist is to combat the sick,
shoddy optimism of community
and church, the traditional "hero"
has vanished from I lie modern
novel.
This is the assertion of Albert
,T. Guerard, Harvard English pro
fessor, who presented last night's
Tuesday Evening Series lecture.
Since Freud first undertook to
reduce man's stature, according
to Guerard. the novelist has been
driving ego into the corner and
"hacking it to pieces." "In this
post-Freudian world, ugly mo
tives must be found for every
thing good," Guerard said.
Typical Hero
Fiction's hero reveals the soci
ety in which we live, stated Guer
ard. Where the typical hero was
formerly a national idol fighting
the forces of evil, today's hero is
a powerful rebel trying to save
society by destroying its faith and
ideals, he said.
Guerard cited works of Fitz
gerald and Hemingway as com
ing closest to "diminishing the
old American dream of innocence
and youthful success." Such con
temporary novels as "By Love
Possessed" and"The Man in the
Grey Flannel Suit," he pointed
out, also reflects only compro
misses, not dreams.
Modern Novelist
"The modern novelist cannot
be blamed for revealing these un
comfortable truths and unpleas
ant people," contended Guerard.
One theory for the disappearance
of the hero is that the modern
world has no heroes of classic
magnitude and tragic flaws, he
said.
"I would like to see more af
firmative novels; I'd even like to
write one," Guerard concluded.
"By this I mean not a novel full
of affirmations, but one which
will restore society's lost longings
for pleasure in freedom and re
establish these as social goods."
Guerard, son of Stanford's re
tired literature professor Albert
L. Guerard and himself a Stan
ford alumnus, has written nine
books, including several novels
and autobiographies. His most
recent work is "The Bystander."
