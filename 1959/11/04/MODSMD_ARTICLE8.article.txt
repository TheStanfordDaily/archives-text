# Soviets Hold Royalties
## 
### Jerry Rankin 
Several Stanford authors ap
parently enjoy a flattering but fi
nancially unrewarding popularity
in Russia, according to results of
a University survey.
This is because the Russians
have adopted at least 21 texts
written by 10 University instruc
tors, but without the formality
of paying royalties.
The Soviets are not members
of the International Copyright
Union, and do not pay royalties
| to foreign authors whose books
I they translate and publish.
Two-way Exchange
If the Russians were to join the
| 1CU. the way would ho cleared
i for a two-way exchange of roy
alties "two-way" because the
j U.S. has also used Russian texts
! without payment of royalties.
The 10 authors have
written or co-authored hooks in
mathematics, physics and chem
istry and have later discovered
j the Russian edition of their
works.
As Vice-President Frederick E.
Terman puts it, "The Stanford
I family apparently stands pretty
! well in Russia."
Terman'-; famous "Radio En
gineers Handbook" was printed
in an edition of 20,000 in 1930.
The Russian version of his "Elec
tronic Measurements." which he
; wrote jointly with Dean Joseph
I M IVtlil of tin* School of Engi

I necring. appeared in 195").
He pointed out that even if the j
I Soviet Union did join the TOT. j
j the amount of money received j
from royalties would he rather!
small.
No SI ranker
Terman is no stranger to hav
; ing his books pirated. The Chi- j
nose published some of his books
j before World War II without pay- j
; ing royalties. The Japanese did i
! the same during the war.
| At least nine of Russian-born j
i Stepfhen P. Timoshenko's works I
1 have been used, including his
j classic "Strength of Materials."
I Me is an emeritus professor of
, theoretical and applied mechan
i ics.
Four of the nine books were
| written in collaboration with Don
ovan H. Young, professor of engi-
I neering mechanics.
Apparently the earliest Stan
ford work to appear in an unau- '
thori/vd edition was a study by
George S. Parks, retired head of
the Chemistry Department,
ill M3B
Written in 1932, he discovered I
| in 193S that it had been trans
lated into Russian and used ex
tensively throughout the Soviet
| Union.
Pr o Ie s so r Hugh Skilling's
"Fun d a m en t a 1 s of Elect ric >
Waves," penned in 1912 before he.

of Electrical Engineering, is an-

Professor Skilling says he has
j "not the faintest hope" of realiz
ing any royalties from his book.
Russian scientific interest in
oilier space was shown in 1938
when "Radio Astronomy," by
Professor Ronald Brace well of
the Radio Propagation *Labora
! Tory, appeared on Soviet book
j stalls.
Bracewell first learned by a
: strange coincidence that the book,
! collaborated upon by Dr. Joseph
I Pawsey, had been published in
Russia.
Itussiuii Cafeteria
Pawsey was lunching in a Rus
sian cafeteria when a young wom
an passing by noticed the name
lag Ire happened to be wearing.
It turned out that she had been
the editor in charge of translat
ing their book.
Bracewell, noting the Russians
"have been vigorously translat
ing foreign books for 20 or 30
years," has little hope for any
royalties. Me feels his book is
probably in use "In a college or
institution."
The late professor of chemis
try. James W. Mc√üain, found in
193.") that his "Sorption of Gases
and Vapors by Solids" was being
used as a text in Russian colleges.
Me inquired of the Russian gov
ernment, which asked him to
write a preface to their edition.
His pay for this was a free trip
