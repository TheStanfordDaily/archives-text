On the move at home and abroad
!
From Florida to the Philippines, from Alaska to the Dominican Republic
.. . General Telephone — America's second largest telephone system —is
getting around these days.
Our job is to bring people closer together through modern communica
tions—in the states and overseas, as well. Right now our operating com
panies and affiliates serve more than 3'& million American homes and
offices and a number o{ foreign countries. On top of this, our overseas
manufacturing subsidiaries in Belgium and Italy provide much needed
communications equipment to markets almost everywhere in the world.
In this country, General Telephone's growth in the past ten years has
paralleled the strong, healthy growth of America, itself. As for the future
—every sign indicates a continuation of this expansion, a growth poten
tial that s practically unlimited. For instance, we are adding new tele
phones at a rate of 750 a day. And we're investing almost $200 million
in new telephone facilities this year, alone.
This is a typical example of how we strive... not only to meet today's
communications needs but to answer tomorrow's.
