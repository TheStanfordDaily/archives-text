# MOST POWERFUL EVER
## Million Watt Transmitter To Be Completed by '60 
### Ross Hermann 
The installation of a high-pow
ered radio transmitter, to be used
in space research, will be com
pleted by Jan. 1, the Stanford
Radio Propagation Laboratory
revealed yesterday.
A 40 by 100-foot steel building
is being constructed to house the
transmitter. The foundations are
already in place with completion
of the building scheduled for Dec.
1.
Antenna Coming
The radio transmitter project,
announced last summer along
with plans for a giant dish an
tenna, is costing an estimated $1
million. Operating on 20-60 meg
acycles. the transmitter will be
the most powerful of its type ever
built, requiring a million-watt
power supply.
The operation of the transmit
ter will be closely coordinated
with the antenna, which will be

erected within the next year.
The antennas is expected to be op
erational by mid-summer 1960.
The dish, rising to the height of
a 15-story building, will be built
at a cost of $250,000, bringing the
total investment in the two proj
ects to almost $1.5 million. When
completed, the big dish will be the
largest in the United States and
the second largest in the world.
The projects are a joint under
taking of the SRI Communication
and Propagation Laboratory and
the University Radio Propagation
Laboratory, with the support of
the Air Force Cambridge Re
search Center.
The combined activities of the
two highly complex instruments
will provide a new and sensitive
tool for space research.
liadar Telescope
The dish antenna, equipped
with a parabolic reflector 142
feet in diameter, will serve as a
"radar telescope." It will receive
the naturally occurring electro
magnetic radiation emitted from
the stars. In this respect it may
be operated independently from
the transmitter.
With the high-powered trans
mitter, however, it will be pos
sible to bounce radio signals
against the heavenly bodies and
receive the echoes of the signals
with the dish antenna. Stanford
scientists will attempt to obtain
radar echoes from Mars and even
the sun.
This latter technique, called
"radar astronomy," is becoming
increasingly important in the
study of the solar system. This
method is distinguished from "ra
dio astronomy," which does not
involve the reflection of man
made signals but only the recep
tion of natural radiation.
Benefits
By probing with the transmit
ter and the dish antenna the sci
entists hope:
• to gain more accurate meas
urements of cosmic distances;
• to explore the surface of the
moon and the Janets;
• to compute the rotation speed
of Venus, whose surface is ob
scured by perpetual fog;
• to discover the density and
distribution of ions in the sun's
outer corona;
• to accumulate data on the
amounts and movements of ion
ized gases and debris betewen the
moon and the earth and in inter
planetary space.
The transmitter and the anten
na will also be used in collabora
tion with other existing Univer
sity and SRI facilities giving Stan
ford one of the world's most com
plete radio-radar astronomy es
tablishments.

The installation of a high-pow
ered radio transmitter, to be used
in space research, will be com
pleted by Jan. 1, the Stanford
Radio Propagation Laboratory
revealed yesterday.
A 40 by 100-foot steel building
is being constructed to house the
transmitter. The foundations are
already in place with completion
of the building scheduled for Dec.
1.
Antenna Coming
The radio transmitter project,
announced last summer along
with plans for a giant dish an
tenna, is costing an estimated $1
million. Operating on 20-60 meg
acycles. the transmitter will be
the most powerful of its type ever
built, requiring a million-watt
power supply.
The operation of the transmit
ter will be closely coordinated
with the antenna, which will be

erected within the next year.
The antennas is expected to be op
erational by mid-summer 1960.
The dish, rising to the height of
a 15-story building, will be built
at a cost of $250,000, bringing the
total investment in the two proj
ects to almost $1.5 million. When
completed, the big dish will be the
largest in the United States and
the second largest in the world.
The projects are a joint under
taking of the SRI Communication
and Propagation Laboratory and
the University Radio Propagation
Laboratory, with the support of
the Air Force Cambridge Re
search Center.
The combined activities of the
two highly complex instruments
will provide a new and sensitive
tool for space research.
liadar Telescope
The dish antenna, equipped
with a parabolic reflector 142
feet in diameter, will serve as a
"radar telescope." It will receive
the naturally occurring electro
magnetic radiation emitted from
the stars. In this respect it may
be operated independently from
the transmitter.
With the high-powered trans
mitter, however, it will be pos
sible to bounce radio signals
against the heavenly bodies and
receive the echoes of the signals
with the dish antenna. Stanford
scientists will attempt to obtain
radar echoes from Mars and even
the sun.
This latter technique, called
"radar astronomy," is becoming
increasingly important in the
study of the solar system. This
method is distinguished from "ra
dio astronomy," which does not
involve the reflection of man
made signals but only the recep
tion of natural radiation.
Benefits
By probing with the transmit
ter and the dish antenna the sci
entists hope:
• to gain more accurate meas
urements of cosmic distances;
• to explore the surface of the
moon and the Janets;
• to compute the rotation speed
of Venus, whose surface is ob
scured by perpetual fog;
• to discover the density and
distribution of ions in the sun's
outer corona;
• to accumulate data on the
amounts and movements of ion
ized gases and debris betewen the
moon and the earth and in inter
planetary space.
The transmitter and the anten
na will also be used in collabora
tion with other existing Univer
sity and SRI facilities giving Stan
ford one of the world's most com
plete radio-radar astronomy es
tablishments.
