# Student Barred By Men's Council
## 
### 
Men's Council has handed down
a quarter's suspension to a Stan
ford student who recently threw
a "cherry bomb" firecracker into
a stall shower, permanently dam
aging a fellow student's hearing.
The action means the suspend
ed student will be barred from at
tending classes for one quarter.
This case was cited as an exam
ple of student disregard of the
Fundamental Standard last week
by Fundamental Standard Com
mission chairman Jim Robertson.
