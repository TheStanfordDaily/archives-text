It is reasonable that serious
doubts should be raised about the
wisdom of the Administration de
cision to attach a "Buy Ameri
can" string to much of our eco
nomic aid.
This i« a sharp turning away
from the liberal, anti-restrictive
trade policy we have practiced—
and preached with notable suc
cess since the end of the war. It
seems to me that all parties con
cerned, the Administration par
ticularly, ought to give this ac
tion a thorough second look lest
we get embarked on a policy
which will do far more harm to
America and to the free world
than it will do good.
I am not suggesting (hat we
should not try to redress the $3
billion imbalance in trade (lie
U.S. is experiencing, due to (lie
flowing abroad in increasing
volume, we are buying abroad
more (ban we are selling
abroad. We should, therefore,
be anxious to arrest (he drain
011 our gold reserves.
But the real issue is not wheth
er we need to correct our trade
imbalance but whether the course
the Administration is taking —
that is, requiring recipients of
the Development Loan Fund to
buy American products even
when it is decisively uneconoimc
for them to do so—is the best
way to go about it.
The new tied-loan policy, re
quiring other governments, as a
condition of such loans, to pur
chase in a single market — the
U.S. market—irrespective of cost,
would not contribute more than
$100 to $200 million to our bal
ance of payments.
The question is: Will not (lie
drawbacks and h a r m w h i c h
(his policy will do (o our long,
constructive effort to build in
the whole free world a competi
tive, freer flowing, multi-later
al trade system be far greater
than (he dollar advantage?
There is certainly an impres
sive case to be made against this
action and the principal arcu

ments are these:
• It will further rut the com
modity aid we are furnishing
abroad at a time when President
Eisenhower had declared thai
Congressional cuts have reduced
it below the minimum necessary.
• The economies of many un
developed countries will be se
riously hurt.
• Just because the Soviet Un
ion ties all its loans to the pur
chase of Iron Curtain goods is no
reason we should do the same.
• Not only will the "Buy Amer
ican" policy hurt the national
economies we are trying to help,
but it would hurt the U.S. politi
cally because U.S. aid would have
a less favorable impact on the
underdeveloped and uncommitted
nations and people.
• We will be weakening our
ability to counter Ihe effective
ness—and lure—of Soviet aid of
fers.
• We will undercut the cause
we have helped bring to such use
ful fruition — the cause of per
suading other nations by our ex
ample and argument to accept
the U.S. thesis that a free, com
petitve world trade system is best
for everybody.
It is perfectly true that there
are new factors in the world
'rade picture. We are losing trade
mkl dollars to our allies whose
improved productivity and eco
nomic health we have helped to
brine about.
Today other free-world na
tions, especially Germany, Brit
ain, France and Japan, are able
to and should bear a larger
burden of foreign aid through
loans.
Should we not first Iry, as I
think we can, to enlist the co
operation of our economically
strong allies, without any "Buy
American" or "Buy British" or
"Buy Japanese" restrictions, to
strengthen further the freely
competitive world trade system
in which we all share equally
before we take steps away from
this healthy system, before we
ourselves embark on this "Buy
American" tied-loan policy which
turns away from the competitive
world trade system we rightly
want to promote?

trade policy we have practiced—
and preached with notable suc
cess since the end of the war. It
seems to me that all parties con
cerned, the Administration par
ticularly, ought to give this ac
tion a thorough second look lest
we get embarked on a policy
which will do far more harm to
America and to the free world
than it will do good.
I am not suggesting (hat we
should not try to redress the $3
billion imbalance in trade (lie
U.S. is experiencing, due to (lie
flowing abroad in increasing
volume, we are buying abroad
more (ban we are selling
abroad. We should, therefore,
be anxious to arrest (he drain
011 our gold reserves.
But the real issue is not wheth
er we need to correct our trade
imbalance but whether the course
the Administration is taking —
that is, requiring recipients of
the Development Loan Fund to
buy American products even
when it is decisively uneconoimc
for them to do so—is the best
way to go about it.
The new tied-loan policy, re
quiring other governments, as a
condition of such loans, to pur
chase in a single market — the
U.S. market—irrespective of cost,
would not contribute more than
$100 to $200 million to our bal
ance of payments.
The question is: Will not (lie
drawbacks and h a r m w h i c h
(his policy will do (o our long,
constructive effort to build in
the whole free world a competi
tive, freer flowing, multi-later
al trade system be far greater
than (he dollar advantage?
There is certainly an impres
sive case to be made against this
action and the principal arcu

ments are these:
• It will further rut the com
modity aid we are furnishing
abroad at a time when President
Eisenhower had declared thai
Congressional cuts have reduced
it below the minimum necessary.
• The economies of many un
developed countries will be se
riously hurt.
• Just because the Soviet Un
ion ties all its loans to the pur
chase of Iron Curtain goods is no
reason we should do the same.
• Not only will the "Buy Amer
ican" policy hurt the national
economies we are trying to help,
but it would hurt the U.S. politi
cally because U.S. aid would have
a less favorable impact on the
underdeveloped and uncommitted
nations and people.
• We will be weakening our
ability to counter Ihe effective
ness—and lure—of Soviet aid of
fers.
• We will undercut the cause
we have helped bring to such use
ful fruition — the cause of per
suading other nations by our ex
ample and argument to accept
the U.S. thesis that a free, com
petitve world trade system is best
for everybody.
It is perfectly true that there
are new factors in the world
'rade picture. We are losing trade
mkl dollars to our allies whose
improved productivity and eco
nomic health we have helped to
brine about.
Today other free-world na
tions, especially Germany, Brit
ain, France and Japan, are able
to and should bear a larger
burden of foreign aid through
loans.
Should we not first Iry, as I
think we can, to enlist the co
operation of our economically
strong allies, without any "Buy
American" or "Buy British" or
"Buy Japanese" restrictions, to
strengthen further the freely
competitive world trade system
in which we all share equally
before we take steps away from
this healthy system, before we
ourselves embark on this "Buy
American" tied-loan policy which
turns away from the competitive
world trade system we rightly
want to promote?
