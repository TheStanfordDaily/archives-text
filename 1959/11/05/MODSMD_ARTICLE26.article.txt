Pacifists Humble
Editor, The Daily:
It is unfortunate that there has j
been injected into the exchange
between Mr. Reilly and myself an
edge of bitterness. To the extent
that this is my fault, I owe an
apology to Mr. Reilly.
I should, however, like to clear
up one misunderstanding com
mon to several of your corre
spondents. Mr. Reilly states that
pacifism "necessarily teaches sub
mission." This is not so.
Pacifism teaches first humility;
that the truth is not easily found, j
and that before we assume that ;
it is "they" who are wrong, and
"we" who are right, we must con- 5
stantly challenge the premises of
our own beliefs and the purity of I
our own motives.
This does not preclude a choice j
between right and wrong. The
pacifist has concluded, not finally |
and irrevocably, but with suffi-j
cient certainty to form a basis for'
action, thai to offer violence to j
another human being is immoral.
This does not lead to submis-'
sion to injustice. The pacifist has
a moral duty to resist evil with
the same determination as does
the non-pacifist, but in place of i
violence and hatred he offers non
violent resistance and compas
sion.
That this doctrine requires no
less courage in the face of a!
ruthless opponent is clear. Thai
it is effective has also been dem- !
onstrated in practice.
