But I don't have any favorite

DID YOU KNOW? OR DO
YOU CARE? Some famous Stan
ford football songs are in (he
public domain. It almost sounds
like they're in ill fame to say
(hat but it means nobody pays
anybody when the songs are
I played.
Most likely no one would be
too concerned about (bis — ex
! cept the band, which profits by
copyrights, and the student fi
nancial manager, because the
ASSU does, too.
I learned this choice bil of in
formation (lie other day while
talking to high-ups in the band.
Seems it all came about a
couple of years ago (or more)
when one of the financial mana
gers forgot (o renew copyrights
on some of these Stanford ditties.
And it seems to be (oo late to get
(hem back. Soil of a once-they
get-domained (hey really ge( do

Hut this doesn't seem right

I will join forces with anyone
who lias nothing better to do

The chief of (he local Indian
tribe, Prince Lightfoot, has re
cently put a now book (or book
j let) on the market which bears
| some looking in(o if you have any
| interest in Indian lore.
The booklet is called "Prince
I Lightfoot—lndian from the Cali
fornia Redwoods." It includes a
number of stories by the prince,
whose other name is Timm Wil

liams. In the book Timm has in-j
eluded some of the legends of his j
Yurok iribe, along with explana
tions of art, costume, language!
and crafts.
Naturally, because I find (lie
Prince a very interesting and
entertaining person, 1 found
the book a very enjoyable one.
I have gotten over an earlier]
feeling that (his loyal Stanford j

fan deserves much more praise
than he's getting, at least a ver
ba] expression of it.
Still, I feel he's added much in
the way of color to Stanford
sports, and to get to know Timm
through the honk is an experience
some of you might he glad you

DID YOU KNOW? OR DO
YOU CARE? Some famous Stan
ford football songs are in (he
public domain. It almost sounds
like they're in ill fame to say
(hat but it means nobody pays
anybody when the songs are
I played.
Most likely no one would be
too concerned about (bis — ex
! cept the band, which profits by
copyrights, and the student fi
nancial manager, because the
ASSU does, too.
I learned this choice bil of in
formation (lie other day while
talking to high-ups in the band.
Seems it all came about a
couple of years ago (or more)
when one of the financial mana
gers forgot (o renew copyrights
on some of these Stanford ditties.
And it seems to be (oo late to get
(hem back. Soil of a once-they
get-domained (hey really ge( do

Hut this doesn't seem right

I will join forces with anyone
who lias nothing better to do
than try to get these songs
hack out of the public domain —
whatever that is.

The chief of (he local Indian
tribe, Prince Lightfoot, has re
cently put a now book (or book
j let) on the market which bears
| some looking in(o if you have any
| interest in Indian lore.
The booklet is called "Prince
I Lightfoot—lndian from the Cali
fornia Redwoods." It includes a
number of stories by the prince,
whose other name is Timm Wil

liams. In the book Timm has in-j
eluded some of the legends of his j
Yurok iribe, along with explana
tions of art, costume, language!
and crafts.
Naturally, because I find (lie
Prince a very interesting and
entertaining person, 1 found
the book a very enjoyable one.
I have gotten over an earlier]
feeling that (his loyal Stanford j

fan deserves much more praise
than he's getting, at least a ver
ba] expression of it.
Still, I feel he's added much in
the way of color to Stanford
sports, and to get to know Timm
through the honk is an experience
some of you might he glad you
had.
