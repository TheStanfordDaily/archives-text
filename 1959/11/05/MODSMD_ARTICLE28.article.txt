Moon Comments
Kriitor, The Daily:
If in the future Stanford finds
itself conspicuously avoided in
the awarding of such plays as
"The Moon Besieged," the fault |
will lie not with the Stanford
Players but with the quality of
the reception and criticism ac
corded by the University audi
ence.
The Daily's review of this play
will not, I hope, go on record as
representative of Stanford's gen
eral reaction. The review was ap
pallingly imperceptive and the
striking immaturity of some of
its statements deserves to be;
pointed out.
The reviewer states that "the
whole idea of the drama never
seemed to crystallize" a star
tling opinion in view of the fact
that the reviewer was not aware
of this "whole idea."
The play was an attempt to
show how the spirit of vengeance!
and hatred may function without
check when sanctioned by a claim
for the "holiness" of the cause.
It is difficult not to regard as in
tended by the playwright a timely
parallel between the story of John
Brown and that of Senator Jo
seph McCarthy.
The same violations of justice
and charity resulted in our time!
from a mistaken notion by the
general public that anything done
in the name of the American fla;
and the eradication of Commu
nism deserved a blanket endorse
ment.
To understand all this the re
viewer would have had to give
careful attention to the lines,of
the play, but each of these she
found "too much of a 'little gem'
â€”too wordy and too long."
Name-dropping is ordinarily in
excusable, but it seems fair to
ask Miss McKinley her opinion
of Shakespeare's speeches. Does

she believe that or new plays
must confine themselves to mono
syllables and proceed on the
conversational level of Stanley
Kowalski?
Fortunately, an opportunity
will exist during the play's per
formances next (this) weekend to
correct the impression of critical
immaturity at Stanford given
Miss Schochen and the Ford
| Foundat ion.

Americanization
I'ditor, The Daily:
I was shocked out of my com
placency by a letter appearing in
j your columns and authored by
Herr Morawitz. Since my fore
; fathers originated in his country
let me advance the impressions
of one who has been "American
ized."
America's voice may be an un
tutored one at times, but The
Daily's editorials, and her well
chosen coverage, reflect the kind
nesses and the tolerant pulses
which pervade America's people.
When someone like Herr Mora
witz wishes to have his day in
court, he knows that he has a
tolerant and heterogeneous audi
ence. 1 love reporting by Ameri
cans because I have become at
tuned to their way of life since
migrating here 16 years ago.
My undergraduate education
was received in a free night col
lege founded by Peter Cooper,
who neither sought to ask me the
color of my skin nor to exclude
me because of the religious be
liefs which I firmly hold.
Now, I am undertaking gradu
ate study at Stanford under the
auspices of American industry.
Yet I do not have to rely either
on a dictatorship or a paternalis
tic socialistic scheme of things
in order to secure the benefits of
an advanced education. And all
this to an average individual who
was willing to take advantage of
the opportunities offered by his
fellow citizens! . . .
In America the sky is the limit
in any field, because the spirit
soars free, unfettered by "Euro
pean" or other limiting ideolo
gies. . . .
My name is unimportant, and
my story is one of the less meri
torious "Songs of America." Let
the foreign students read the
present columns of The Stanford
Daily, as imperfect as they might
be, and they, too, will hear the
music and see t lie light in gradual
stages.
Another source material for
foreign students lies in the Bible.
The words are simple (not as
flowery or well put together as
the foreign student's) but the ma
terial is eternal in its impact.
