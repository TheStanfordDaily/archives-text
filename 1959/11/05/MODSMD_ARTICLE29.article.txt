morning. If Shakespeare didn't write Canterbury Tales I'm :i
(lend duck . . . Lunch at the house—turkey hash. Question:
how can we have turkey hash when we never had turkey? . . .
Smoked a Marlboro after lunch. I dig those better makin's
the most! . . . Played bridge with sorors in afternoon. When

feated ... Smoked more Marlboros. Quelle joic!... And so to bed.
TFESDAY: Faculty tea at the house. Spilled pot of oolong
on Dean of Women. She very surly. Offered her a Marlboro.
Still surly. Offered skin graft. No help . . . Dinner at Kozy
Kampus Kafe—24 hamburgers. But no dessert. Have to watch
waistline . . . And so to bed.
WEDNESDAY: (lot our marks in English lit quiz. Lucky
for me Shakespeare wrote Canterbury Talis! . . . Afternoon date
with Ralph Feldspar. Purely platonic. Ralph wanted to con
sult me about love trouble he's having with his girl Nymphet
Calloway. I assured him things would get better. Ralph said
he certainly hopes so because last four times lie called on
Nymphet, she dumped vacuum cleaner hag on him . . . Smoked
several Marlboros. Wonderful cigarette. No confusion about
which end to light. Saves loads of time . . . Dinner at house
bread. That's all; just bread . . . And so to bed.
T1 ll'RSDAY : Three packages from home- laundry, cookies,
records. So hungry I ate all three . .. Quiz in American history.
If Millard Fillmore didn't invent cotton gin, I'm in big trouble
. . . Dinner at house. Rig excitement—Nymphet Calloway an
nounced her engagement to Ralph Feldspar. While sorors
flocked around to congratulate Nymphet, 1 ate everybody's
side meat . . . Then smoked Marlboro. Oh, what a piece of work
is Marlboro! . . . And so to bed.

FRIDAY: Clot our murks in American history quiz. Was
shattered to learn that Millard Fill more did not invent cotton
»in. He wrote Cavbrbury Tubs . . . How very odd! . . . Lunch
at the house bread hash ~. Marlboro after lunch. (treat smoke.
, Must send valentine to manufacturers .. . Spent entire after
noon setting dressed for date tonight with Norman Twonkcv.
Norman is dull, dark, loaded—a perfect doll! Only thing wrong
is he never tells a y;irl where he's going to take her. So I put
on a bathing suit, on top of that an evening gown, and on top
of that a snowsuit. Thus 1 was ready for a splash party, a dance,
or a toboggan slide . . . So what do you think happened? He
entered me in a steeplechase, that's what! . . . Would have taken
first prize easily if 1 hadn't pulled up lame in the last furlong
. . . And so to bed. ■ im# m«» shuim**

bread. That's all; just bread . . . And so to bed.
T1 ll'RSDAY : Three packages from home- laundry, cookies,
records. So hungry I ate all three . .. Quiz in American history.
If Millard Fillmore didn't invent cotton gin, I'm in big trouble
. . . Dinner at house. Rig excitement—Nymphet Calloway an
nounced her engagement to Ralph Feldspar. While sorors
flocked around to congratulate Nymphet, 1 ate everybody's
side meat . . . Then smoked Marlboro. Oh, what a piece of work
is Marlboro! . . . And so to bed.

FRIDAY: Clot our murks in American history quiz. Was
shattered to learn that Millard Fill more did not invent cotton
»in. He wrote Cavbrbury Tubs . . . How very odd! . . . Lunch
at the house bread hash ~. Marlboro after lunch. (treat smoke.
, Must send valentine to manufacturers .. . Spent entire after
noon setting dressed for date tonight with Norman Twonkcv.
Norman is dull, dark, loaded—a perfect doll! Only thing wrong
is he never tells a y;irl where he's going to take her. So I put
on a bathing suit, on top of that an evening gown, and on top
of that a snowsuit. Thus 1 was ready for a splash party, a dance,
or a toboggan slide . . . So what do you think happened? He
entered me in a steeplechase, that's what! . . . Would have taken
first prize easily if 1 hadn't pulled up lame in the last furlong
. . . And so to bed. ■ im# m«» shuim**
