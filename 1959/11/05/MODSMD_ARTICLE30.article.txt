## Briggs Studies Phototropism 
### George Greenstein 
Phototropism is a big word ap-1
plied to a big topic. As early as
1880 Darwin first studied the
mechanism of the bending of J
plants toward a light, yet it has
been only in the last 30 years that
scientists have begun to intro
duce some degree of order into
a mass of theories and specula
tions.
The order introduced into the
study of phototropism is the or
der of a series of phenomena only
vaguely understood — phenomena
which ultimately rest on such
fundamentals as the nature of
growth and of I he energy sources
all life depends upon.
Light Bends
Suppose you hold a candle a !
yard away from a corn shoot for
a few minutes. Slowly the shoot
will bend toward the light. Take
the light away and the stalk re
turns to the vertical. Increase the
total amount of light received by
the plant and you increase its
curvature.
You can increase the intensity
of the light and decrease the time
you apply it, and find that the
curvature depends only on the to
tal light received.
Glass Insert
The following experiment has
been performed. Take the shoot,
split it down the middle, and in
sert a piece of thin glass in its
tip. Then the plant will not bend
toward the light.
Now a plant bends when one
side grows faster than the other.
Placing a piece of glass in the
tip prevents "something" there
are some thoughts as to what this I

"something" is — from getting
across the plant. If it can get
across the plant, one side will
grow faster than the other. If
not, both grow equally.
This seems to indicate that
there is some substance in a
plant whose presence makes it
grow. It also gives us some indi
cation as to its behavior: when
exposed to a certain amount of
light it is moved away from it.
Now increase the amount of
light applied, but keep its inten
sity low. We find eventually that
the plant will curve no farther—
that whatever mechanism is caus
ing curvature is now saturated.
If we still increase the total
light received we will finally
come to a point where the plant
starts to curve farther even if we
split the plant.
Here is a second mechanism
that makes one side of a plant
grow faster than another, which
involves no transfer of a chemi
cal in the plant at all. What is
this mechanism? No one knows.
Increase Light
Keep on increasing the light.
The plant again reaches a point
where it will bend no farther. We
have reached the limit beyond
which this second mechanism is
always saturated beyond which
whatever is happening cannot
happen any more.
Yet we get still more curvature
if we apply really large doses of
light enough to cause a good
sunburn — and this third mecha
nism of curvature seems to in
volve a lessening of the ability of
the light side to grow.
Does this involve a destruction

[ of whatever it is that makes
plants grow? Perhaps. If so, we
have another bit of information
about this poorly - understood
| stuff - too much light kills it.
j Not too much brightness, but too
much total light.
Thu-s we find three different
mechanisms that have something
to do with making plants grow,
i Yet the mechanisms themselves
may be changed.
Dr. Winslow Briggs, assistant
professor of biology at Stanford,
has recently performed a series
of experiments in which the total
dose of light received by a plant is
constant, but the intensity — the
j brightness—of light is varied.
In particular, he kept the light
bright. The brighter the light,
the less the plant curved. There
is an intensity where the plant
will not curve at all, no matter
how much total light is applied.
Ability Destroyed
Apparently the very ability of
the plant to curve is destroyed by
bright light. Does this involve
a destruction of the stuff that
makes the plant grow? No. it
does not, for the plant keeps right
on growing.
Obviously then, bright lights
act not on the "something" that
makes plants grow, but on the
mechanism that affects it. And it
is a strange kind of effect light
has. for if we increase the bright
ness .still farther the plant starts
to curve again.
What sort of a mechanism is it
that operates by light intensities
j which destroy all others? Again
j no one knows.
No one knows but we have

some ideas about its characteris
tics. Dr. Briggs has performed
the following experiment: Shine
a brilliant burst of light on a
plant for a few seconds, then
shine a dim light on it for a long
time.
At first the plant will not
budge, but in 20 minutes or so it
will start to bend in response to
the dim light. Eventually it act-;
as if it had completely forgotten
the brilliant light.
Apparently the ill effects of
bright light on our mechanism
are not permanent they gradu
ally die out. Now Dr. Briggs left
the light on only for an instant—
3/1000 of a second and followed
it with dim light. The plant bent
immediately.
Minimum Time
Light, no matter how bright,
seems to have no effect on our
mechanism unless it lasts more
than a certain minimum length
of time.
So the unknown mechanism—
or three . or four mechanisms—
that act on the "growth chemical"
—or chemicals—takes time to act,
can be affected by bright light
and slowly recovers, cannot be de
stroyed by too bright light, and
cannot be destroyed by bright
light lasting too short a time.
It was through the study of a
relatively innocuous subject like
the bending of plants that men
had reason to believe in the ex
istence of such a substance; and
it is through Dr. Briggs' work
and the work of others like him
that we now have a description
of what this elusive stuff is like,
how it acts, and how it does not
act. Once this description is com
plete, an understanding of its na
ture is possible.

been performed. Take the shoot,
split it down the middle, and in
sert a piece of thin glass in its
tip. Then the plant will not bend
toward the light.
Now a plant bends when one
side grows faster than the other.
Placing a piece of glass in the
tip prevents "something" there
are some thoughts as to what this I

"something" is — from getting
across the plant. If it can get
across the plant, one side will
grow faster than the other. If
not, both grow equally.
This seems to indicate that
there is some substance in a
plant whose presence makes it
grow. It also gives us some indi
cation as to its behavior: when
exposed to a certain amount of
light it is moved away from it.
Now increase the amount of
light applied, but keep its inten
sity low. We find eventually that
the plant will curve no farther—
that whatever mechanism is caus
ing curvature is now saturated.
If we still increase the total
light received we will finally
come to a point where the plant
starts to curve farther even if we
split the plant.
Here is a second mechanism
that makes one side of a plant
grow faster than another, which
involves no transfer of a chemi
cal in the plant at all. What is
this mechanism? No one knows.
Increase Light
Keep on increasing the light.
The plant again reaches a point
where it will bend no farther. We
have reached the limit beyond
which this second mechanism is
always saturated beyond which
whatever is happening cannot
happen any more.
Yet we get still more curvature
if we apply really large doses of
light enough to cause a good
sunburn — and this third mecha
nism of curvature seems to in
volve a lessening of the ability of
the light side to grow.
Does this involve a destruction

[ of whatever it is that makes
plants grow? Perhaps. If so, we
have another bit of information
about this poorly - understood
| stuff - too much light kills it.
j Not too much brightness, but too
much total light.
Thu-s we find three different
mechanisms that have something
to do with making plants grow,
i Yet the mechanisms themselves
may be changed.
Dr. Winslow Briggs, assistant
professor of biology at Stanford,
has recently performed a series
of experiments in which the total
dose of light received by a plant is
constant, but the intensity — the
j brightness—of light is varied.
In particular, he kept the light
bright. The brighter the light,
the less the plant curved. There
is an intensity where the plant
will not curve at all, no matter
how much total light is applied.
Ability Destroyed
Apparently the very ability of
the plant to curve is destroyed by
bright light. Does this involve
a destruction of the stuff that
makes the plant grow? No. it
does not, for the plant keeps right
on growing.
Obviously then, bright lights
act not on the "something" that
makes plants grow, but on the
mechanism that affects it. And it
is a strange kind of effect light
has. for if we increase the bright
ness .still farther the plant starts
to curve again.
What sort of a mechanism is it
that operates by light intensities
j which destroy all others? Again
j no one knows.
No one knows but we have

some ideas about its characteris
tics. Dr. Briggs has performed
the following experiment: Shine
a brilliant burst of light on a
plant for a few seconds, then
shine a dim light on it for a long
time.
At first the plant will not
budge, but in 20 minutes or so it
will start to bend in response to
the dim light. Eventually it act-;
as if it had completely forgotten
the brilliant light.
Apparently the ill effects of
bright light on our mechanism
are not permanent they gradu
ally die out. Now Dr. Briggs left
the light on only for an instant—
3/1000 of a second and followed
it with dim light. The plant bent
immediately.
Minimum Time
Light, no matter how bright,
seems to have no effect on our
mechanism unless it lasts more
than a certain minimum length
of time.
So the unknown mechanism—
or three . or four mechanisms—
that act on the "growth chemical"
—or chemicals—takes time to act,
can be affected by bright light
and slowly recovers, cannot be de
stroyed by too bright light, and
cannot be destroyed by bright
light lasting too short a time.
It was through the study of a
relatively innocuous subject like
the bending of plants that men
had reason to believe in the ex
istence of such a substance; and
it is through Dr. Briggs' work
and the work of others like him
that we now have a description
of what this elusive stuff is like,
how it acts, and how it does not
act. Once this description is com

Phototropism is a big word ap-1

grow faster than another, which
involves no transfer of a chemi
cal in the plant at all. What is
this mechanism? No one knows.
Increase Light
Keep on increasing the light.
The plant again reaches a point
where it will bend no farther. We
have reached the limit beyond
which this second mechanism is
always saturated beyond which
whatever is happening cannot
happen any more.
Yet we get still more curvature
if we apply really large doses of
light enough to cause a good
sunburn — and this third mecha
nism of curvature seems to in
volve a lessening of the ability of
the light side to grow.
Does this involve a destruction

[ of whatever it is that makes
plants grow? Perhaps. If so, we
have another bit of information

j Not too much brightness, but too
much total light.
Thu-s we find three different
mechanisms that have something
to do with making plants grow,
i Yet the mechanisms themselves
may be changed.
Dr. Winslow Briggs, assistant
professor of biology at Stanford,
has recently performed a series
of experiments in which the total
dose of light received by a plant is
constant, but the intensity — the
j brightness—of light is varied.
In particular, he kept the light
bright. The brighter the light,
the less the plant curved. There
is an intensity where the plant
will not curve at all, no matter
how much total light is applied.
Ability Destroyed
Apparently the very ability of
the plant to curve is destroyed by
bright light. Does this involve
a destruction of the stuff that
makes the plant grow? No. it
does not, for the plant keeps right
on growing.
Obviously then, bright lights
act not on the "something" that
makes plants grow, but on the
mechanism that affects it. And it
is a strange kind of effect light
has. for if we increase the bright
ness .still farther the plant starts
to curve again.
What sort of a mechanism is it
that operates by light intensities
j which destroy all others? Again
j no one knows.
No one knows but we have

some ideas about its characteris
tics. Dr. Briggs has performed
the following experiment: Shine
a brilliant burst of light on a
plant for a few seconds, then
shine a dim light on it for a long
time.
At first the plant will not
budge, but in 20 minutes or so it
will start to bend in response to
the dim light. Eventually it act-;
as if it had completely forgotten
the brilliant light.
Apparently the ill effects of
bright light on our mechanism
are not permanent they gradu
ally die out. Now Dr. Briggs left
the light on only for an instant—
3/1000 of a second and followed
it with dim light. The plant bent
immediately.
Minimum Time
Light, no matter how bright,
seems to have no effect on our
mechanism unless it lasts more
than a certain minimum length
of time.
So the unknown mechanism—
or three . or four mechanisms—
that act on the "growth chemical"
—or chemicals—takes time to act,
can be affected by bright light
and slowly recovers, cannot be de
stroyed by too bright light, and
cannot be destroyed by bright
light lasting too short a time.
It was through the study of a
relatively innocuous subject like
the bending of plants that men
had reason to believe in the ex
istence of such a substance; and
it is through Dr. Briggs' work
and the work of others like him
that we now have a description
of what this elusive stuff is like,
how it acts, and how it does not
act. Once this description is com

DR. WINSLOW BRIGGS, ASS T. PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY
Investigates effect of light intensity of plant growth
Phototropism is a big word ap-1
plied to a big topic. As early as
1880 Darwin first studied the
mechanism of the bending of J
plants toward a light, yet it has
been only in the last 30 years that
scientists have begun to intro
duce some degree of order into
a mass of theories and specula
tions.
The order introduced into the
study of phototropism is the or
der of a series of phenomena only
vaguely understood — phenomena
which ultimately rest on such
fundamentals as the nature of
growth and of I he energy sources
all life depends upon.
Light Bends
Suppose you hold a candle a !
yard away from a corn shoot for
a few minutes. Slowly the shoot
will bend toward the light. Take
the light away and the stalk re
turns to the vertical. Increase the
total amount of light received by
the plant and you increase its
curvature.
You can increase the intensity
of the light and decrease the time
you apply it, and find that the
curvature depends only on the to
tal light received.
Glass Insert
The following experiment has
been performed. Take the shoot,
split it down the middle, and in
sert a piece of thin glass in its
tip. Then the plant will not bend
toward the light.
Now a plant bends when one
side grows faster than the other.
Placing a piece of glass in the
tip prevents "something" there
are some thoughts as to what this I

"something" is — from getting
across the plant. If it can get
across the plant, one side will
grow faster than the other. If
not, both grow equally.
This seems to indicate that
there is some substance in a
plant whose presence makes it
grow. It also gives us some indi
cation as to its behavior: when
exposed to a certain amount of
light it is moved away from it.
Now increase the amount of
light applied, but keep its inten
sity low. We find eventually that
the plant will curve no farther—
that whatever mechanism is caus
ing curvature is now saturated.
If we still increase the total
light received we will finally
come to a point where the plant
starts to curve farther even if we
split the plant.
Here is a second mechanism
that makes one side of a plant
grow faster than another, which
involves no transfer of a chemi
cal in the plant at all. What is
this mechanism? No one knows.

of experiments in which the total
dose of light received by a plant is
constant, but the intensity — the
j brightness—of light is varied.
In particular, he kept the light
bright. The brighter the light,
the less the plant curved. There
is an intensity where the plant
will not curve at all, no matter
how much total light is applied.
Ability Destroyed
Apparently the very ability of
the plant to curve is destroyed by
bright light. Does this involve
a destruction of the stuff that
makes the plant grow? No. it
does not, for the plant keeps right
on growing.
Obviously then, bright lights
act not on the "something" that
makes plants grow, but on the
mechanism that affects it. And it
is a strange kind of effect light
has. for if we increase the bright
ness .still farther the plant starts
to curve again.
What sort of a mechanism is it
that operates by light intensities
j which destroy all others? Again
j no one knows.
No one knows but we have

some ideas about its characteris
tics. Dr. Briggs has performed
the following experiment: Shine
a brilliant burst of light on a
plant for a few seconds, then
shine a dim light on it for a long
time.
At first the plant will not
budge, but in 20 minutes or so it
will start to bend in response to
the dim light. Eventually it act-;
as if it had completely forgotten
the brilliant light.
Apparently the ill effects of
bright light on our mechanism
are not permanent they gradu
ally die out. Now Dr. Briggs left
the light on only for an instant—
3/1000 of a second and followed
it with dim light. The plant bent
immediately.
Minimum Time
Light, no matter how bright,
seems to have no effect on our
mechanism unless it lasts more
than a certain minimum length
of time.
So the unknown mechanism—
or three . or four mechanisms—
that act on the "growth chemical"
—or chemicals—takes time to act,
can be affected by bright light
and slowly recovers, cannot be de
stroyed by too bright light, and
cannot be destroyed by bright
light lasting too short a time.
It was through the study of a
relatively innocuous subject like
the bending of plants that men
had reason to believe in the ex
istence of such a substance; and
it is through Dr. Briggs' work
and the work of others like him
that we now have a description
of what this elusive stuff is like,
how it acts, and how it does not
act. Once this description is com
plete, an understanding of its na
ture is possible.


DR. WINSLOW BRIGGS, ASS T. PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY
Investigates effect of light intensity of plant growth
Phototropism is a big word ap-1
plied to a big topic. As early as
1880 Darwin first studied the
mechanism of the bending of J
plants toward a light, yet it has
been only in the last 30 years that
scientists have begun to intro
duce some degree of order into
a mass of theories and specula
tions.
The order introduced into the
study of phototropism is the or
der of a series of phenomena only
vaguely understood — phenomena
which ultimately rest on such
fundamentals as the nature of
growth and of I he energy sources
all life depends upon.
Light Bends
Suppose you hold a candle a !
yard away from a corn shoot for
a few minutes. Slowly the shoot
will bend toward the light. Take
the light away and the stalk re
turns to the vertical. Increase the
total amount of light received by
the plant and you increase its
curvature.
You can increase the intensity
of the light and decrease the time
you apply it, and find that the
curvature depends only on the to
tal light received.
Glass Insert
The following experiment has
been performed. Take the shoot,
split it down the middle, and in
sert a piece of thin glass in its
tip. Then the plant will not bend
toward the light.
Now a plant bends when one
side grows faster than the other.
Placing a piece of glass in the
tip prevents "something" there
are some thoughts as to what this I

"something" is — from getting
across the plant. If it can get
across the plant, one side will
grow faster than the other. If
not, both grow equally.
This seems to indicate that
there is some substance in a
plant whose presence makes it
grow. It also gives us some indi
cation as to its behavior: when
exposed to a certain amount of
light it is moved away from it.
Now increase the amount of
light applied, but keep its inten
sity low. We find eventually that
the plant will curve no farther—
that whatever mechanism is caus
ing curvature is now saturated.
If we still increase the total
light received we will finally
come to a point where the plant
starts to curve farther even if we
split the plant.
Here is a second mechanism
that makes one side of a plant
grow faster than another, which
involves no transfer of a chemi
cal in the plant at all. What is
this mechanism? No one knows.
Increase Light
Keep on increasing the light.
The plant again reaches a point
where it will bend no farther. We
have reached the limit beyond
which this second mechanism is
always saturated beyond which
whatever is happening cannot
happen any more.
Yet we get still more curvature
if we apply really large doses of
light enough to cause a good
sunburn — and this third mecha
nism of curvature seems to in
volve a lessening of the ability of
the light side to grow.
Does this involve a destruction

[ of whatever it is that makes
plants grow? Perhaps. If so, we
have another bit of information
about this poorly - understood
| stuff - too much light kills it.
j Not too much brightness, but too
much total light.
Thu-s we find three different
mechanisms that have something
to do with making plants grow,
i Yet the mechanisms themselves
may be changed.
