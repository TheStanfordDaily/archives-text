# Farm Passing Duo Heads NCAA Football Statistics
## 
### 
With the offensively geared
San Jose game under their belts,
Stanford's aerial duo, Dick Nor
man and Chris Burford, have
grabbed a solid passing receiving
leadership in the NCAA statisti
cal grind.
Norman racked up 268 yards
-260 of them on a dozen completed
passes against the Spartans.

I This was his highest game total
| of the season and boosted his of-
I fense margin to 249 yards over |
, lowa State's Dwight Nichols, 13091
I to 1060. Norman has a 16-comple- j
I tion bulge over the runner-up
! passer, Pete Hall of Marquette.
Burford grabbed five of this |
j partner's missiles for 77 yards to
go five ahead of Army's Bill Car
penter, 36-31, and also wrest
away the yardage lead from the
"lonely end."
If this two - man corporation
cops the passing - catching tan
dem, they'll be the third twosome
ever to accomplish the feat. Mis
sissippi's Chuck Conerly firing to
Barney Poole in 1947 and Cal's
Paul Larson to Jim Hanifan in
1954 turned the trick previously.
Skip Face moved up from tenth
to sixth in the scoring depart
ment and Ben Robinson stayed in
the number nine spot in the pass-1
receiving parade.
