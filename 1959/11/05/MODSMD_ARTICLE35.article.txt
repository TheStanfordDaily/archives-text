# Stanford Gridders Polish Attack for UCLA Bruins
## Daily Sports 
### 
Stanford gridders finished a tough afternoon scrimmaging yesterday in preparing for the invading
UCLA Bruins this Saturday.
Tribe hopes received an added lift as tackle Phil Burkland and halfback Dick Bowers returned to
the team. Burkland and Bowers are still rated as only possible starters depending on how badly their
injuries hamper them. They were injured in the tough contest down in the Coliseum against SC two

weeks ago and were out of the
San Jose game.
The nation's top passing com
bo, Dick Norman throwing and
Chris Burford catching, will be
Ihe Tribe's chief weapon against
the invading Bruins who will have
to improve their pass coverage
against Norman to Burford, Ben
.Robinson, Bowers, Skip Face or
John Bond who as a group, top
the AAYVU receiving stats.
Itunning Adds Variety
The Cai'ds new-found running
attack should provide Ihe variety
needed against UCLA and will
get an acid test against Iho tough
Bruins. Next Saturday will give
a real chance for Face, Archie
Schmitt, Gil Dowd, Rick McMillan
and Mac Wylie to prove them
selves as runners and blockers
against a Uclan squad which held
the highly touted Washington
ground game to 108 yards two
weeks ago.
The Tribe will be after a third
win in a row against UCLA. The
Indians edged the Bruins 21-19
last year down South and whip
ped them 20-6 two years ago up
here. However the Uclans have
been plagued with only "half
seniors" on their ball club the
Bruin seniors could only play in
half the games due to the old
PCC penalties in the last two
years -and this year will bo at
full strength.
First AAWU Win
This weekend will give the
Tribe a chance to collect their
first AAVVU win and the boys
especially like to beat a team from
the South. If the Cards take
the Bruins it will be the first
time that UCLA has been beaten
three times in a row since Cal did
it back in '48, '49, and '50.
The Indians have been working
on their defense this week for
the Bruin single-wing attack.
Hard running Uclans Ray Smith,
Bill Kilmer, and Bob Smith have
chalked up quite a bit of yard
age in the Bruin deliberate type
of play.
To See Action
Card Coach Jack Curtice will
no doubt be calling on fullback
Wylie quite a bit in this Satur
day's clash. Wylie had one of his
best games against San Jose—
making ton tackles and many key
blocks while coming up with a
touchdown on a runback of an
intercepted pass.
Tackle Jack Gordon is another
Tribe gridder to come on strong
for the Indians. Starting in left
tackle in place of Burkland, Gor
don looked real good on offense
and defense both in last week
end's clash.

UCLA Bruins this Saturday.
Tribe hopes received an added lift as tackle Phil Burkland and halfback Dick Bowers returned to
the team. Burkland and Bowers are still rated as only possible starters depending on how badly their
injuries hamper them. They were injured in the tough contest down in the Coliseum against SC two

weeks ago and were out of the
San Jose game.
The nation's top passing com
bo, Dick Norman throwing and
Chris Burford catching, will be
Ihe Tribe's chief weapon against
the invading Bruins who will have
to improve their pass coverage
against Norman to Burford, Ben
.Robinson, Bowers, Skip Face or
John Bond who as a group, top
the AAYVU receiving stats.
Itunning Adds Variety
The Cai'ds new-found running
attack should provide Ihe variety
needed against UCLA and will
get an acid test against Iho tough
Bruins. Next Saturday will give
a real chance for Face, Archie
Schmitt, Gil Dowd, Rick McMillan
and Mac Wylie to prove them
selves as runners and blockers
against a Uclan squad which held
the highly touted Washington
ground game to 108 yards two
weeks ago.
The Tribe will be after a third
win in a row against UCLA. The
Indians edged the Bruins 21-19
last year down South and whip
ped them 20-6 two years ago up
here. However the Uclans have
been plagued with only "half
seniors" on their ball club the
Bruin seniors could only play in
half the games due to the old
PCC penalties in the last two
years -and this year will bo at
full strength.
First AAWU Win
This weekend will give the
Tribe a chance to collect their
first AAVVU win and the boys
especially like to beat a team from
the South. If the Cards take
the Bruins it will be the first
time that UCLA has been beaten
three times in a row since Cal did
it back in '48, '49, and '50.
The Indians have been working
on their defense this week for
the Bruin single-wing attack.
Hard running Uclans Ray Smith,
Bill Kilmer, and Bob Smith have
chalked up quite a bit of yard
age in the Bruin deliberate type
of play.
To See Action
Card Coach Jack Curtice will
no doubt be calling on fullback
Wylie quite a bit in this Satur
day's clash. Wylie had one of his
best games against San Jose—
making ton tackles and many key
blocks while coming up with a
touchdown on a runback of an
intercepted pass.
Tackle Jack Gordon is another
Tribe gridder to come on strong
for the Indians. Starting in left
tackle in place of Burkland, Gor
don looked real good on offense
and defense both in last week
end's clash.


PHIL BURKLAND
Tackle rated as possible starter
Stanford gridders finished a tough afternoon scrimmaging yesterday in preparing for the invading
UCLA Bruins this Saturday.
