A Few Good Players
II it came to picking a college football team with the most talented
ex-players as coaches, this year's Stanford staff would probably
rate some fairly high recognition. Several of this year's assistants
to head Coach Jack Curtice have some illustrious pasts behind them
in college football circles.
Andy Everest, Curtice's right hand man and handler of the for
ward wall on this year's squad, played football at Texas Western
under, of all people, Jack Curtice. Andy starred at center for the
Texas club and captained them in his senior year. That same year
that Andy captained the team, Texas Western was the nation's lead
ing rushing team. That was back in 1950.
Homer Smith, the freshman football coach, had his good days too.
Smith captained and played on one of Princeton's best teams back
in 1953. On one afternoon against Harvard, Smith set the Ivy League
rushing record for a single game by piling up a mere 273 yards on
the ground.
His last two years at Princeton, Smith was named to the All East
backfield and his senior year got several Ail-American nominations.

Pete Kmetovich, helping handle
(he Stanford backfield, needs no
real introduction to Indian fans.
Kmetovich was the left half on
the 1910 "Wow Boys", and his
runback of a punt to a touchdown
against Nebraska in the '41 Hose
Bowl has almost become legend
ary on the Farm.
After Pete left Stanford and
the navy he 1 took a whirl at pro
football playing with the Phila
delphia Eagles in 1946 and with
the Detroit Lions the year after.
f)ut< It Fehring, sometime foot
ball coach and sometime baseball
coach, was quite a player at
Purdue in the early thirties. Fehr
ing played tackle and was named
Ail-American in 1933. That same
year he captained the All Big-
Ten squail.
The newest addition to the
coaching staff, Leon McLaughlin,
is especially familiar to Los
Angeles nat ive s . McLaughlin
was one of UCLA's best linemen
of all time. He captained the

team in 1950 and played center for the Bruins each year of his varsity
career. In the first PCC-Big Ten Rose Bowl game in 194ti, McLaughlin
centered for UCLA against the Big Ten champs from Illinois. Buddy
Young', speedy 5-5 halfback was the mini's star at the time.
National Champs
After leaving UCLA, McLaughlin went on to do very well with
the Los Angeles Bams. He was starting offensive center for the Ranis
the year they won the NFL title, 1951, and also was still at center on
the 1955 Western Division champs from Los Angeles.
Dan S'tavely, who joined the staff late last year, was a standout
player at Denver University. He was more well known in college,
however, for being a wrestler. Perhaps, a wrestler is more valuable
to a West Coast football coaching staff this year than a football man—
that is when you consider the play of a certain lineman so far in 1959.
Or would a boxer be better.
Jack McKenna, now handling the Braves, is also a good man when
it comes to the arts of self defense. McKenna coaches wrestling at
Stanford. Jack, the youngest member of the football staff, played
football at Stanford in 1955. As a member of the Indian squad 31c-
Kenna was a center.
One more coach is left to be mentioned—the boss—Jack Curtice.
Curtice played his football at Transylvania College, which doesn't
just exist in Mad magazine. In his best season at Transylvania,
Curtice led the nation in forward passing. That same year the Indian
mentor threw 23 touchdown aerials. Curtice did most of his passing
from the tailback spot in the single wing.
A New Rule
With all the new rules that have been flooding into college foot
ball the last few seasons, it seems to me that perhaps this year the
coaches ought to consider an amendment to the two point conversion
rule. As it stands now the defensive team gets no benefit out of inter
cepting a pass for a two point conversion attempt or recovering a
fumble in the air on the same play. Maybe the football rules com
mittee should allow the defensive team two points if they can manage
1o intercept or recover a fumble and run it back the 98 yards to the
opponents goal. It might happen once in a season, but who knows
that once might mean the national title.
I guess if they allowed this, however, they would have to allow the
Ihree point play. What's that? Oh. merely when the team attempting
the two point conversion runs it across the goal and then laterals it
back where a teammate awaits to hold the ball to be kicked for the
third point. This one would be good for Stanford.
