# Indian Hushing Attack Realizes Potential in San Jose Game
## 
### 
Stanford's rushing attack fi
nally realized its potential last
week as Indian backs rolled up a
season high of 224 yards on the
ground against the hapless San
Jose State defense.
The Indians' big threat all af
ternoon was Ski[j Face, the lead
ing ground gainer for the day
with 82 yards in 12 carries.
The role was nothing new for
Face, who tops all other Stanford
backs by almost 100 yards with a
267 total.
The IS! pound fullback finished
las! season as the team's leading
scorer dt -spite having played only
five minutes in the first three
games.
Besides being their best run
ning threat, Face is also the In
dians' kicking specialist. kndin rT
thr> squad in punting, kick-offs
and field goals. A fine all-around
a:hletc who was leading hurdler
on the Stanford treck team last
year, Face po; ;esses the natural
speed and ag'.lity of a top defen
sive back.
al Fullback
Cactus Jack appears to be qui'e
deep ai fullback with Rick MV-
Millen and Sid Garber around to
spell Face. MeMillen, a senipr,
averaged .">.82 yards per carry
lasi year to lead the team. This
year he has picked up 163 yards
in -17 carries for a 3.47 average.
Although he does not daze you
with his speed, MeMillen is agile

and is dangerous from any point
on the field. lie has also proved
to be a dangerous pass receiver.
The 191-pounder has blossomed
into a polished punter this year
and boasts a 41-yard average.
A converted quarterback, Gar
ber has proved himself a very
elusive runner from the fullback
spot. Although he seldom played
last year, Garber proved to be the
big man in Stanford's 21-19 vic
tory over UCLA.
In addition to his football tal
ents. the 204-pound senior is also
an outstanding scholar and is ma
joring in pro-mod.
Amazing Performance
Mac VVylie, the Indians' depend
able right halfback, put on an
amazing blocking performance

last week against San Jose and
was personally responsible for
several of his teammates' explo
sive runs.
Wylie was impressive packing
I Ir* ball himself as he picked up
18 yards in four carries for a 1..1
average. The 190-pound junior is
second to Face in rushing with a

189-yard total.
Perhaps Wylie's greatest value
to the team is his aggressive de
fensive play. The rugged line
backer leads the team in tackles
and showed hi* pass - defending
ability against San Jose when he
picked off two Spartan aerials.
I'lcasant Surprise
One of the pleasant surprises
for Curtice this year ha-s been
the hard r un n in g of Archie
Schmitt. This 196-pound junior
played perhaps his best game of
the '59 season last Saturday when
he picked up 77 yards in 11 car
ries.
An All-American at Taft Col
lege in 1955, Schmitt came to
Stanford with a tremendous 'repu
tation but was sidelined with in
juries in '56 and '57.
Also running from the light
half spot is Gil Dowd, a 212-pound
junior. Like Schmitt, Dowd came
to Stanford with a big reputation
and was hampered by injuries.
Although he played most of last
year, lie was never able to go all
out because of minor injuries.
Having played just briefly this
year. Dowd has managed to av
erage four yards per carry on 20
tries.
The Indian attack was hurt
considerably by the absence of

Dick Bowers, regular 1 left half
back, who was shelved with in
juries last week.
Despite his punitive size, five
feet nine inches, 172 pounds, Bow
ers has proved a fine target for
Dick Norman's passes, and the
I pint-sized wingback lias latched
on to 12 of the ;e aerials for 169

yards and a touchdown.
Behind Bovvers, Curtice can call
! on the services of two accom
plished backs, John Bond and
John Bessey. Bond, a senior, has
| played both halfbacks and full
back during his three seasons at
Stanford.
Although he has not carried
the ball much this year, this 192-

pound senior is a fine runner.
Much of his value to the squad
this year has been his blocking
ami pass receiving. He has caught
10 aerials for 107 yards.
Perhaps the fastest back on the
Indian squad is Bessey, but un-

fortunately ho lacks the experi
enee ol' a first-siring player. Bps
sey has seen a great cieil of ac
tion on defense where his si/r
and natural •ipe'ed are assets.

The role was nothing new for
Face, who tops all other Stanford
backs by almost 100 yards with a
267 total.
The IS! pound fullback finished
las! season as the team's leading
scorer dt -spite having played only
five minutes in the first three
games.
Besides being their best run
ning threat, Face is also the In
dians' kicking specialist. kndin rT
thr> squad in punting, kick-offs
and field goals. A fine all-around
a:hletc who was leading hurdler
on the Stanford treck team last
year, Face po; ;esses the natural
speed and ag'.lity of a top defen
sive back.
al Fullback
Cactus Jack appears to be qui'e
deep ai fullback with Rick MV-
Millen and Sid Garber around to
spell Face. MeMillen, a senipr,
averaged .">.82 yards per carry
lasi year to lead the team. This
year he has picked up 163 yards
in -17 carries for a 3.47 average.
Although he does not daze you
with his speed, MeMillen is agile

and is dangerous from any point
on the field. lie has also proved
to be a dangerous pass receiver.
The 191-pounder has blossomed
into a polished punter this year
and boasts a 41-yard average.
A converted quarterback, Gar
ber has proved himself a very
elusive runner from the fullback
spot. Although he seldom played
last year, Garber proved to be the
big man in Stanford's 21-19 vic
tory over UCLA.
In addition to his football tal
ents. the 204-pound senior is also
an outstanding scholar and is ma
joring in pro-mod.
Amazing Performance
Mac VVylie, the Indians' depend
able right halfback, put on an
amazing blocking performance

last week against San Jose and
was personally responsible for
several of his teammates' explo
sive runs.
Wylie was impressive packing
I Ir* ball himself as he picked up
18 yards in four carries for a 1..1
average. The 190-pound junior is
second to Face in rushing with a

189-yard total.
Perhaps Wylie's greatest value
to the team is his aggressive de
fensive play. The rugged line
backer leads the team in tackles
and showed hi* pass - defending
ability against San Jose when he
picked off two Spartan aerials.
I'lcasant Surprise
One of the pleasant surprises
for Curtice this year ha-s been
the hard r un n in g of Archie
Schmitt. This 196-pound junior
played perhaps his best game of
the '59 season last Saturday when
he picked up 77 yards in 11 car
ries.
An All-American at Taft Col
lege in 1955, Schmitt came to
Stanford with a tremendous 'repu
tation but was sidelined with in
juries in '56 and '57.
Also running from the light
half spot is Gil Dowd, a 212-pound
junior. Like Schmitt, Dowd came
to Stanford with a big reputation
and was hampered by injuries.
Although he played most of last
year, lie was never able to go all
out because of minor injuries.
Having played just briefly this
year. Dowd has managed to av
erage four yards per carry on 20
tries.
The Indian attack was hurt
considerably by the absence of

Dick Bowers, regular 1 left half
back, who was shelved with in
juries last week.
Despite his punitive size, five
feet nine inches, 172 pounds, Bow
ers has proved a fine target for
Dick Norman's passes, and the
I pint-sized wingback lias latched
on to 12 of the ;e aerials for 169

yards and a touchdown.
Behind Bovvers, Curtice can call
! on the services of two accom
plished backs, John Bond and
John Bessey. Bond, a senior, has
| played both halfbacks and full
back during his three seasons at
Stanford.
Although he has not carried
the ball much this year, this 192-

pound senior is a fine runner.
Much of his value to the squad
this year has been his blocking
ami pass receiving. He has caught
10 aerials for 107 yards.
Perhaps the fastest back on the
Indian squad is Bessey, but un-

fortunately ho lacks the experi
enee ol' a first-siring player. Bps
sey has seen a great cieil of ac
tion on defense where his si/r
and natural •ipe'ed are assets.

thr> squad in punting, kick-offs
and field goals. A fine all-around
a:hletc who was leading hurdler
on the Stanford treck team last
year, Face po; ;esses the natural
speed and ag'.lity of a top defen
sive back.
al Fullback
Cactus Jack appears to be qui'e
deep ai fullback with Rick MV-
Millen and Sid Garber around to
spell Face. MeMillen, a senipr,
averaged .">.82 yards per carry
lasi year to lead the team. This
year he has picked up 163 yards
in -17 carries for a 3.47 average.
Although he does not daze you
with his speed, MeMillen is agile

and is dangerous from any point
on the field. lie has also proved
to be a dangerous pass receiver.
The 191-pounder has blossomed
into a polished punter this year
and boasts a 41-yard average.
A converted quarterback, Gar
ber has proved himself a very
elusive runner from the fullback
spot. Although he seldom played
last year, Garber proved to be the
big man in Stanford's 21-19 vic
tory over UCLA.
In addition to his football tal
ents. the 204-pound senior is also
an outstanding scholar and is ma
joring in pro-mod.
Amazing Performance
Mac VVylie, the Indians' depend
able right halfback, put on an
amazing blocking performance

last week against San Jose and
was personally responsible for
several of his teammates' explo
sive runs.
Wylie was impressive packing
I Ir* ball himself as he picked up
18 yards in four carries for a 1..1
average. The 190-pound junior is
second to Face in rushing with a

189-yard total.
Perhaps Wylie's greatest value
to the team is his aggressive de
fensive play. The rugged line
backer leads the team in tackles
and showed hi* pass - defending
ability against San Jose when he
picked off two Spartan aerials.
I'lcasant Surprise
One of the pleasant surprises
for Curtice this year ha-s been
the hard r un n in g of Archie
Schmitt. This 196-pound junior
played perhaps his best game of
the '59 season last Saturday when
he picked up 77 yards in 11 car
ries.
An All-American at Taft Col
lege in 1955, Schmitt came to
Stanford with a tremendous 'repu
tation but was sidelined with in
juries in '56 and '57.
Also running from the light
half spot is Gil Dowd, a 212-pound
junior. Like Schmitt, Dowd came
to Stanford with a big reputation
and was hampered by injuries.
Although he played most of last
year, lie was never able to go all
out because of minor injuries.
Having played just briefly this
year. Dowd has managed to av
erage four yards per carry on 20
tries.
The Indian attack was hurt
considerably by the absence of

Dick Bowers, regular 1 left half
back, who was shelved with in
juries last week.
Despite his punitive size, five
feet nine inches, 172 pounds, Bow
ers has proved a fine target for
Dick Norman's passes, and the
I pint-sized wingback lias latched
on to 12 of the ;e aerials for 169

yards and a touchdown.
Behind Bovvers, Curtice can call
! on the services of two accom
plished backs, John Bond and
John Bessey. Bond, a senior, has
| played both halfbacks and full
back during his three seasons at
Stanford.
Although he has not carried
the ball much this year, this 192-

pound senior is a fine runner.
Much of his value to the squad
this year has been his blocking
ami pass receiving. He has caught
10 aerials for 107 yards.
Perhaps the fastest back on the
Indian squad is Bessey, but un-

fortunately ho lacks the experi
enee ol' a first-siring player. Bps
sey has seen a great cieil of ac
tion on defense where his si/r
and natural •ipe'ed are assets.
