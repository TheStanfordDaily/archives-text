# Steel Negotiations Stopped Indefinitely-No Progress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON </P> — Steel in
dustry and union negotiators met
face-to-face yesterday but parted
as deadlocked as ever in the 113- i
day-old strike.
Joseph F. Finnegan told news
men the eyes of both sides are i
focused on the Supreme Court. He j
recessed the talks indefinitely.
The court has under study an |
appeal by the United Steelwork
ers Union from a District Court
judge's order that 500,000 strikers ;
return to the long-idle steel mills:
at least for so days. There was
no word on when the high court ■
may announce its decision.
The nine justices began their!
deliberations after a hearing Tues

day, and continued them yester
day without any announced re
sult. Presumably they will dig
I into the complex legal problem
again today.
At issue is the order itself and
the emergency machinery of the
112-year-old Taft-Hartley law under
! which the injunction was issued
! two weeks ago. The union has
' challenged the constitutionality of
that section of the law. While the
j Supreme Court considers the case,
the back-to-work order remains
; suspended.
