I respect Mr. Reilly's view, but
1 believe he has misunderstood
the pacifist position when ho says
that it entails an undignified sub
mission to slavery.
The pacifist will resist tyranny
with his very being, but will not
return evil with evil, for the prob
lem of violence never was, and
never will be. solved by violence.
