Moreno's note said Panama
"laments yesterday's occurrences
and in no way can accept or ap
prove the acts of the type that
motivated your protest."
"Nevertheless," the note added,
"I must say that in relation to
the occurrences at the Canal Zone
boundary, my government has in
formation about certain unjustifi

of unarmed Panamanians and
throwing tear gas bombs on vari

"These have left more than 40
Panamanian citizens wounded by
actions of the armed forces of
the United States."
Panama was put off limits to
Americans living in the Canal
Zone after the trouble. Panaman
