# Capsule Puts Man Closer to Space Travel

### 
WASHINGTON (JP) — A Mer
cury space capsule was hurled
35,000 feet high yesterday by a
Little Joe rocket—moving Ameri
ca one step nearer getting a man
into space.
Within 45 minutes of the firing,
the one-ton capsule was scooped
from the Atlantic by the Navy
salvage vessel Preserver about
five miles from Ihe takeoff point
on Wallops Island, Va.
It was the second such tests in
perfecting the escape mechanism
designed to save the astronauts'
lives if they run into trouble dur
ing launchings. An escape rocket
was fired 35 seconds after the
take-off.
The National Aeronautics and
Space Administration said the
launching was designed parti
cularly to test the performance of
the escape system under maxi
mum load conditions.
The test used a capsule similar
to one that will be placed into
orbit carrying a man.
Atlas missiles will be used for
the actual man-in-space shots,
probably in 1961. The Little Joe is
an instrument for which six
launchings have been scheduled,
in unmanned tests.
