# CLASH WITH CARDS
## Baby Blue Invades Farm 
### Russ Allen 
Tomorrow the baby blue Bru
ins from UCLA invade the Farm
in hopes of stopping the air at
tack of the S t a n 112 or d football
squad. Almost 1000 rooters from
VVestwood are expected to come
up and view their team in action.
The Card varsity will be out to
grab off its first AAWU win
and its third victory in a row
against the Uclans. The Indians
are favored for a change—to top
i ho Bruins by 13 points but Coach
Jack Curtice knows he will have
a rough contest on his hands and
certainly does not go along with
the odds-makers.
Indian trainer Connie Jarvi;
reports that the team is in good
shape for tomorrow's game. Half
back Dick Bowers will definitely
be a starter and tackle Phil Burk
land another Card griddcr who
has been out for two weeks with
a shoulder injury is a possible
starter and can be counted on to
play tomorrow anyway.
Grimm Ready
Trev Grimm who at first re
port was to miss tomorrow's ac
tion will be all right to play at
a tackle spot. Rod Sears — who
plays behind Dick Norman at
quarterback- is the only Indian
gridder who will definitely miss
the game. Sears suffered a dis
located shoulder at the beginning
of the week.
The Bruins have had a bout
with "Old Man Injury" this week
as their first-string tailback the
speedy, hard-running Bob by i
Smith may be kept out of the!
lineup with a knee injury.
Tomorrow's contest presents |
the interesting and contrasting j
clash between UCLA's Red San-1
ders type single-wing and Stan-:
ford's passing pro-type offense!
which features split ends and;
halfbacks.
Keep the Hall
Coach Billy Barnes will lead his j
Bruins into the game with one :
thought in mind —to hold on to
the ball by slowly grinding yard- |
age and not give the pigskin up j
to the Indians until after a UCLA j
score.
Of course Stanford will give its)
fans a treat in the fine passing
show of Norman to Chris Bur-1
ford, Ben Robinson or Bowers, j
This week an added attraction as j
the Indians will try to pull Bruin
defenders in with a running game
