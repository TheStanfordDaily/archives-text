# CLASH WITH CARDS
## Baby Blue Invades Farm 
### Russ Allen 
Tomorrow the baby blue Bru
ins from UCLA invade the Farm
in hopes of stopping the air at
tack of the S t a n 112 or d football
squad. Almost 1000 rooters from
VVestwood are expected to come
up and view their team in action.
The Card varsity will be out to
grab off its first AAWU win
and its third victory in a row
against the Uclans. The Indians
are favored for a change—to top
i ho Bruins by 13 points but Coach
Jack Curtice knows he will have
a rough contest on his hands and
certainly does not go along with
the odds-makers.
Indian trainer Connie Jarvi;
reports that the team is in good
shape for tomorrow's game. Half
back Dick Bowers will definitely
be a starter and tackle Phil Burk
land another Card griddcr who
has been out for two weeks with
a shoulder injury is a possible
starter and can be counted on to
play tomorrow anyway.
Grimm Ready
Trev Grimm who at first re
port was to miss tomorrow's ac
tion will be all right to play at
a tackle spot. Rod Sears — who
plays behind Dick Norman at
quarterback- is the only Indian
gridder who will definitely miss
the game. Sears suffered a dis
located shoulder at the beginning
of the week.
The Bruins have had a bout
with "Old Man Injury" this week
as their first-string tailback the
speedy, hard-running Bob by i
Smith may be kept out of the!
lineup with a knee injury.
Tomorrow's contest presents |
the interesting and contrasting j
clash between UCLA's Red San-1
ders type single-wing and Stan-:
ford's passing pro-type offense!
which features split ends and;
halfbacks.
Keep the Hall
Coach Billy Barnes will lead his j
Bruins into the game with one :
thought in mind —to hold on to
the ball by slowly grinding yard- |
age and not give the pigskin up j
to the Indians until after a UCLA j
score.
Of course Stanford will give its)
fans a treat in the fine passing
show of Norman to Chris Bur-1
ford, Ben Robinson or Bowers, j
This week an added attraction as j
the Indians will try to pull Bruin
defenders in with a running game


INDIAN HALFBACK DICK BOWERS
Returns to the Active List
with Skip Face, Archie Schmitt
and Gil Dowd carrying the ball.
The big question in this con
test will be the battle in the line
and whether Bruin backs can
stay with the fine, elusive Card
receivers.
Foiii* Speedsters
Also (lie Bruins can field four
speedy gridders end Marv Lus
ter, tailback Bob Smith and wing
backs Gene Gaines and Jim .John
son Rater Johnson's little broth
er and Southern California fans
have been waiting for these boys
to break loose all year.
One unusual aspect of tomor
row's clash is the fact that for
once the Stanford interior line
men -tackles Burkland and Gary
Pike, guards Don Peter and Tom

Walsh and center Doug Pursell
j outweigh their opposition this
lime by 11 pounds per man.
However by inserting two big
tackles in their lineup the Bruins
j can add considerable.
More Experienced
Bruin interior linemen have a
, slight advantage of experience
over the Tribe. Right tackle Paul
Ogelsby, a 224-pound senior, is a
two-year letterman. Starting
guards Jack Metcalf, Rod Coch
ran and center Harry Baldwin
are returning lettermen and all
1 theree were "iron men" for the
• Bruins last year playing in al
: most every minute of every
! game.
Steve Bauwens at left tackle is
I lie only sophomore on the Bruin
j team. He comes up from a top
! notch freshman Brubabe squad.
Of course the Bruins to stop
will be fullback Ray Smith a
1 second - team All - Coast selection
last year and Bill Kilmer who
can run, pass and punt. Kilmer
leads (he Coast in punting and is
high up in total offense figures.
Wiiigbacli Reverse
Another key UCLA play that
you can bet the Indians will be
watching for is the famous wing
back reverse play. This is (he
play that is supposed to break
loose wingback Gene Gaines for a
long gainer.
The Uclans also run off anoth
er razzle-dazzle play in this se
ries where the wingback Gaines
hands if) end Luster in a sort of
end-around or double reverse
play that again is designed for
that long yardage needed.
One interesting sidelight of to
morrow's battle is (he position of
Stanford Coach Leon McLauglin.
McLauglin is a new Tribe assist
ant under Curtice but also was
the outstanding graduating UC
LA football player in 1949. It
should be strange for the popular
coach to find himself on the other
side of the fence this time.
