A new $175 victory banner is
now flying atop USC's Bovard Au
ditorium through the courtesy of
the UCLA Bruins.
It is their gift of repentance
after stealing the banner from
the Bovard tower after last
year's SC-UCLA football game.
The Daily Trojan reports that
the Bruins climbed the four
flights of stairs to Bovard tower
after the game and snatched the
flag from its resting place.
"More than five separate doors
lead to the tower, making it al
most impossible for the West
wood thieves to have found the
banner, let alone abscond with it,"
Knight president Wayne Warga
reported.
However, Warga was wrong.
Obviously. But a flag is noth
ing like an axe.

Students at the University of
Kansas have an absolutely un
bearable problem.
They go to classes in boiler
rooms.
It seems that Summerfield
Hall, a brand new masterpiece of
modern architecture, has no air
conditioning.
As one student put if, "I can
say that the unscarred desks pro
vide little consolation for perspi
ration dripping on them."
The Daily Kansan has re
ceived 11 letters protesting the
temperatures. After an inves
tigation. it found the problem
had been solved: students are

[ now wearing bathing suits to
I class.

The University of Minnesota's
most pressing problem is the
threatened loss of their bongos
from their pizza places.
Live music apparently consti
tutes a nuisance.
Angered by a city move to
limit the live music, 330 stu
dents signed a petition of pro
test for delivery to the Minne
apolis City Council. They feel
this is a violation of the prin
ciple of individual rights.

Report on a Kenyon College
party and general goings-on:
"Faculty and administration
members often attend fraternity
cocktail parties, as guests and not
as chaperones. They are not
drunken brawls; in fact, ihey are
quite dignified. ■. . .
"Drinking 'in the open' is al
lowed there. For example, a
tent is often set up in the mid
dle of the campus in which beer
is cither sold or given away, as
the occasion demands. It is not
uncommon to have beer at foot
ball games. The boys have easy
accessibility to beer and liq
uor."
That's the way they live in
Ohio.

And at UCLA, only 376 rooters'
tickets for tomorrow's game had
been sold as of deadline day. It j
looks like a roaring weekend.
