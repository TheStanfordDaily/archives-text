One cannot help but wonder
I whether France would really in
| sist on spending the vast amounts
| of money and effort required to
, explode an atom bomb if she be
lieved there was an early hope
for renunciation of atomic weap-
I ons by all countries.
There lias been a great deal
of talk recently about the ban
ning of atomic tests being the
most likely point at which the
great powers could begin tak
ing steps toward disarmament.
France is not included in the
discussion, under way at Geneva.
Would she pay the price just
to be included, and only to obtain
the prestige—by which diplomats
mean the mailed fist which they
like to have behind their diplo
matic efforts—or is she primarily
interested in obtaining a weapon
which others have?
Both considerations ha v e
been expressed. President
Charles de Gaulle is strongly
motivated by the idea that
France should be, by right of
her traditions as a great power
and her contributions to world
political thinking, more re
spected in world councils.
j She has fallen from this estate
because of the political vigor
! sapped by two great wars, the
military impotence displayed dur
ing World War 11, and her mili
tary preoccupation with such af
fairs as Algeria and Indochina
while other nations have been
drawing the defense lines be
tween the Communist and free
worlds.
It is quite probable that in
truth no nation will finally stop
testing permanently until con
vinced that they have wrung out
just about all the information ob
tainable in that fashion.
