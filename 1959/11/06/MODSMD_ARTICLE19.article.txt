# As I See It
## A 						column of non-staff opinion 
### Dave Long 
There is a lot of talk recently to
the effect that a deal of "conserv
atism" is to he found on our na
tion's campuses.
What does the term mean?
We can all, of course, play
Lewis Carroll's Humpty
Duiupty and say that if means
just what we choose it to mean
—neither more nor less, hut it
might be a matter of more in
terest to determine if there is
any political significance to
which historical circumstance
has given peculiar meaning.
The concept may be traced to
Edmund Burke, whose Reflec
tions on the Revolution in France
is, among other things, an ex
tended definition of conservatism.
And this leads me to say a little
of what conservatism is not.
It is not intransigence, nor is
it apathy or conformity or big
otry, or Charlie Wilson.
Conversatism is not even a po
litical philosophy by which is
meant a program for political ac
tion built on some kind of moral
justification. What is it then?
Conservatism is a political
methodology, and, as such, is a
value free. It is based on politi
cal-scientific, not moral, consider
ations— not even such "moral"
considerations as Dave Spitz's
consent or John Dewey's in
stramentalism or J. S. Mill's
"utility of man as a progressive
being."
Conservatism doesn't tell you
how to get what you want. (My
"wants" has no moral overtones,
naturalistic or otherwise. It is

i not necessarily even ego-cen
tric.)
Conservatism's first command
ment is: Don't go oft half-cocked.
Man is alternately hot and cold,
energetic and apathetic, admiring
and envious, considerate and un
thinking. In a word, he is change
able (and modern advertising
media have vastly magnified that
fact).
Hence, the man who thinks that
i there is something radically
! wrong with the social tradition
of which he is a part is possibly
right but probably wrong.
Before he shoots off his
month at length, tearing down
with ease what was with dif
ficulty built, lie would do well
to steep himself in the tradi
tion, understand its core and
essence, understand its history
and its problems.
Then, and then only, he is pre-
I pared to suggest alterations, for
I previously he did not know what
he was talking about.
The passing of this step brings
the second commandment into
play: Don't try to change too
much too fast. Societies and the
men that are their members are
so complicated that schemes look
ing good on paper often as not,
or oftener, don't work out.
That is, if you try for too
much of what you want you'll
probably wind up with a great
deal more of what you don't
want. That is why conserva
tives are the strongest op
ponents of all kinds of revolu
tionary schemes, of the right
and the left.
One important result of these
insights is that the conservative
realizes that the "open society"
doesn't work. It violates both
commandments. It encourages
men to go off half-cocked and is
essentially revolutionary.
This is not to forget Sidney
Hook (Heresy Yes, Conspiracy
No). Mr. Hook has really proved
our point. He just closes his so
ciety in abritrary places.
(This probably makes sense
in that if man's "values" are
equally good they are equally
worthless, and whose we scrap
don't make much difference if
the mere preservation of the
society from physical violence
is somehow a supreme "value.")
What about progress? Don't
conservatives oppose progress?
Only if all you mean by progress
is change. If, on the other hand,
you mean improvement—getting
better, more good—then the con
servative is the only true pro
gressive for lie cautions only lest
change be for the worse.

atism" is to he found on our na
tion's campuses.
What does the term mean?
We can all, of course, play
Lewis Carroll's Humpty
Duiupty and say that if means
just what we choose it to mean
—neither more nor less, hut it
might be a matter of more in
terest to determine if there is
any political significance to
which historical circumstance
has given peculiar meaning.
The concept may be traced to
Edmund Burke, whose Reflec
tions on the Revolution in France
is, among other things, an ex
tended definition of conservatism.
And this leads me to say a little
of what conservatism is not.
It is not intransigence, nor is
it apathy or conformity or big
otry, or Charlie Wilson.
Conversatism is not even a po
litical philosophy by which is
meant a program for political ac
tion built on some kind of moral
justification. What is it then?
Conservatism is a political
methodology, and, as such, is a
value free. It is based on politi
cal-scientific, not moral, consider
ations— not even such "moral"
considerations as Dave Spitz's
consent or John Dewey's in
stramentalism or J. S. Mill's
"utility of man as a progressive
being."
Conservatism doesn't tell you
how to get what you want. (My
"wants" has no moral overtones,
naturalistic or otherwise. It is

i not necessarily even ego-cen
tric.)
Conservatism's first command
ment is: Don't go oft half-cocked.
Man is alternately hot and cold,
energetic and apathetic, admiring
and envious, considerate and un
thinking. In a word, he is change
able (and modern advertising
media have vastly magnified that
fact).
Hence, the man who thinks that
i there is something radically
! wrong with the social tradition
of which he is a part is possibly
right but probably wrong.
Before he shoots off his
month at length, tearing down
with ease what was with dif
ficulty built, lie would do well
to steep himself in the tradi
tion, understand its core and
essence, understand its history
and its problems.
Then, and then only, he is pre-
I pared to suggest alterations, for
I previously he did not know what
he was talking about.
The passing of this step brings
the second commandment into
play: Don't try to change too
much too fast. Societies and the
men that are their members are
so complicated that schemes look
ing good on paper often as not,
or oftener, don't work out.
That is, if you try for too
much of what you want you'll
probably wind up with a great
deal more of what you don't
want. That is why conserva
tives are the strongest op
ponents of all kinds of revolu
tionary schemes, of the right
and the left.
One important result of these
insights is that the conservative
realizes that the "open society"
doesn't work. It violates both
commandments. It encourages
men to go off half-cocked and is
essentially revolutionary.
This is not to forget Sidney
Hook (Heresy Yes, Conspiracy
No). Mr. Hook has really proved
our point. He just closes his so
ciety in abritrary places.
(This probably makes sense
in that if man's "values" are
equally good they are equally
worthless, and whose we scrap
don't make much difference if
the mere preservation of the
society from physical violence
is somehow a supreme "value.")
What about progress? Don't
conservatives oppose progress?
Only if all you mean by progress
is change. If, on the other hand,
you mean improvement—getting
better, more good—then the con
servative is the only true pro
gressive for lie cautions only lest
change be for the worse.

We can all, of course, play
Lewis Carroll's Humpty
Duiupty and say that if means
just what we choose it to mean
—neither more nor less, hut it
might be a matter of more in
terest to determine if there is
any political significance to
which historical circumstance
has given peculiar meaning.
The concept may be traced to
Edmund Burke, whose Reflec
tions on the Revolution in France
is, among other things, an ex
tended definition of conservatism.
And this leads me to say a little
of what conservatism is not.
It is not intransigence, nor is
it apathy or conformity or big
otry, or Charlie Wilson.
Conversatism is not even a po
litical philosophy by which is
meant a program for political ac
tion built on some kind of moral
justification. What is it then?
Conservatism is a political
methodology, and, as such, is a
value free. It is based on politi
cal-scientific, not moral, consider
ations— not even such "moral"
considerations as Dave Spitz's
consent or John Dewey's in
stramentalism or J. S. Mill's
"utility of man as a progressive
being."
Conservatism doesn't tell you
how to get what you want. (My
"wants" has no moral overtones,
naturalistic or otherwise. It is

i not necessarily even ego-cen
tric.)
Conservatism's first command
ment is: Don't go oft half-cocked.
Man is alternately hot and cold,
energetic and apathetic, admiring
and envious, considerate and un
thinking. In a word, he is change
able (and modern advertising
media have vastly magnified that
fact).
Hence, the man who thinks that
i there is something radically
! wrong with the social tradition
of which he is a part is possibly
right but probably wrong.
Before he shoots off his
month at length, tearing down
with ease what was with dif
ficulty built, lie would do well
to steep himself in the tradi
tion, understand its core and
essence, understand its history
and its problems.
Then, and then only, he is pre-
I pared to suggest alterations, for
I previously he did not know what
he was talking about.
The passing of this step brings
the second commandment into
play: Don't try to change too
much too fast. Societies and the
men that are their members are
so complicated that schemes look
ing good on paper often as not,
or oftener, don't work out.
That is, if you try for too
much of what you want you'll
probably wind up with a great
deal more of what you don't
want. That is why conserva
tives are the strongest op
ponents of all kinds of revolu
tionary schemes, of the right
and the left.
One important result of these
insights is that the conservative
realizes that the "open society"
doesn't work. It violates both
commandments. It encourages
men to go off half-cocked and is
essentially revolutionary.
This is not to forget Sidney
Hook (Heresy Yes, Conspiracy
No). Mr. Hook has really proved
our point. He just closes his so
ciety in abritrary places.
(This probably makes sense
in that if man's "values" are
equally good they are equally
worthless, and whose we scrap
don't make much difference if
the mere preservation of the
society from physical violence
is somehow a supreme "value.")
What about progress? Don't
conservatives oppose progress?
Only if all you mean by progress
is change. If, on the other hand,
you mean improvement—getting
better, more good—then the con
servative is the only true pro
gressive for lie cautions only lest
change be for the worse.
There is a lot of talk recently to
the effect that a deal of "conserv
atism" is to he found on our na
tion's campuses.
