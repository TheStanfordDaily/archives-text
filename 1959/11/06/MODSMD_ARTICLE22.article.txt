# NOT SO AT DARTMOUTH
## Political Activity? Never Got a Start at Stanford 
### Dave Quarles 
Dr. John Sloan Dickey, presi
dent of Dartmouth College, rec
ently announced that he was
"ready to he counted publicly" as
a supporter of Governor Rocke
feller for the Republican Presi
dential nomination.
President Dickey's action, al
though conceivably stimulated by
the fact that Rockefeller is a
Dartmouth alumnus, would seem
to reflect a positive attitude to
ward political activities of both
faculty and students.
President Dickey's partisan
stand could only indicate his ap
proval if not encouragement of
partisian politics on the Dart
mouth campus.
Out Long Ago
However, the specter of parti
san politics at Stanford was
exorcised long ago by Mrs. Stan
ford, and Stanford still suffers
from that rite of purification. In
the amendment of June 1, 1597,
to the Pounding Charter, Mrs.
Stanford limited the University
to a bloodless political life of
non-partisanship.
Mrs. Stanford's amendment
took its toll immediately. Dr.
Edward A. Ross, one of the moral
leaders of the early progressive
movement and professor of so
ciology at Stanford, campaigned
too vigorously for free silver in
1896.
When the amendment to the

charter did not stop his public
partisan activities, Pi e si den t
Jordan was forced by Mrs. Stan
ford 10 fire Dr. Ross in 1900.
Reputation Damage
President Jordan told Dr. Ross,
''She (Mrs. Stanford) has no de
sire to limit fredom of speech,
but she feels that the reputation
of the University for serious con
versatism is impared by hasty ac
ceptance of political and social
fads or of ideas not approved by
conservative thinkers, and ad
ministrative schemes not accep
table to serious business men."
With Dr. Ross' departure went
the Stanford faculty and stu
dents' right to public partisan po
litical activities. Since then the
political atmosphere has been
controlled by the theory of "equal
time" for all. Even H-Bomb rallies
have been held only with permis
sion from the administration,
and permission for such "social'
fads" is often given with great
reluctance.
Despite recent calls for the "de
fense of capitalism," active po
litics is not a characteristic of
student life here. Although Stan
ford recently experienced a varia
tion of the "Ross Affair," it did
not arouse half of the comment
which shook the University in
1900. Political sensibilities be
come less vocal after the com-1
placency of 50 years of non
partisanship.
Lest Mrs. Stanford appear
slandered, it should be noted that
this university's plight is not un
common. Dr. Earl A. McGrath, i
former United States Commis-;
sioner of Education, and now |
head of the Institute of Higher |
Education at Columbia Teachers j
College, writes in the October is
sue of The Teacher College Rec- ]
old that it is hard to understand
why so many American educators |
must submit to "political emascu-!
lation as a condition of admission
to the profession."
The profession of student has
shared a similar fate at Stanford.
Perhaps we might follow Dart
mouth into a new political era if
President Hoover decided to run
again next fall.
