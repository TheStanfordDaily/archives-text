# NOT SO AT DARTMOUTH
## Political Activity? Never Got a Start at Stanford 
### Dave Quarles 
Dr. John Sloan Dickey, presi
dent of Dartmouth College, rec
ently announced that he was
"ready to he counted publicly" as
a supporter of Governor Rocke
feller for the Republican Presi
dential nomination.
President Dickey's action, al

charter did not stop his public
partisan activities, Pi e si den t
Jordan was forced by Mrs. Stan
ford 10 fire Dr. Ross in 1900.
Reputation Damage
President Jordan told Dr. Ross,

but she feels that the reputation
of the University for serious con
versatism is impared by hasty ac
ceptance of political and social
fads or of ideas not approved by
conservative thinkers, and ad
ministrative schemes not accep
table to serious business men."
With Dr. Ross' departure went
the Stanford faculty and stu
dents' right to public partisan po
litical activities. Since then the
political atmosphere has been
controlled by the theory of "equal
