# BOWMAN ALUMNI HOUSE
## Hoover Campaign Buttons Found 
### Greg Hopkins 
There's a back room over at
Bowman Alumni House filled
with all sorts of amazing things
Dailies from any year you can

name, Herbert Hoover campaign
buttons, and nasty letters from
long-dead alumni trying, prob
ably, to get to the bottom of stu
dent apathy.
Stanford Alumni Association
Director Bob Pierce discovered
these items, along with stacks of
less interesting invoices and
dated correspondence.
The Alumni Association is gov
erned by the 19-member Alumni
Executive Board which directs
the activities of Director Pierce,
Stanford '49, his assistant Joe
Hillis, '56, and the seven other
employees who work at Bowman.
( 'onl'erence Program
Pierce is especially proud of
his group's Stanford Conference
program. Placed among the top
ten programs of this type in the
country by the American Alumni
Council last year, the Stanford
Conferences bring a part of the
Farm directly to alumni in cities
throughout California and the
nation.
At weekend meetings, soon to
be held in such places as Texas
and New York, professors discuss
campus and world-wide develop
ments.
The on-campus conference held
last May for alumni in this area
was only one of the startling total
of 549 meetings held at Bowman
Alumni House during the past
year. Although the building's
name includes the word "alumni,"
only eight alumni groups holding
11 meetings contributed to the

549 total. Student groups such as
Axe Society, Class excoms and
the ASSU Legislature meet reg
ularly at Bowman.
Religious Groups
Diverse religious groups make
use of the facilities, too. Tucked
away in a handy closet is a
prayer rug and compass, evi
dently for use by some eastern
oriented faith, and a number of
Christian Science hymnals.
Your group can help to build
next year's number of meetings
to an all-time high, if you put
your name in pretty early, that
is. The Bowman facilities are
good for almost any on-campus
type of gathering you're plan
ning. Cost is nothing and use of
the building is welcomed. All you
j need do is ask.
Because of the pressure of
numerous functions, a new com
mittee meeting room is due to be
opened at Bowman in I he future.
Its furnishings will center around
a large table presented by the
Stanford Club of Manila, Philip
pine Islands.
Alumni Review
Rounding out a tour of t he
Alumni Association's c a m p us
headquarters brings you to the
I office of Dan Endsley, '57, editor

of the multi-award winning
"Stanford Review." Endsley puts
out a 24-page magazine 10 times
a year. The Review is mailed to
all members of the Alumni As
sociation, and carries articles
; concerning all aspects of the Uni
i versity, as well as news of alumni
| and their activities.
Director Pierce is eager to
; make students familiar with the
funtions of the Alumni Associa
tion, as every student is a po
tential participant in the group,
i He urges you to stop in and look
j around Bowman if you haven't
i yet. There's also a very large pile
| of old files which need to be
| carried to the trash.
