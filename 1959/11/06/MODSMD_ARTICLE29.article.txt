# Soccer Team Meets USF
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team will
play iis most important game of
the* season against USF tomor
row. Card Coach Fred Priddle
says,"The team that wins the
Stanford - USF soccer game will
win the Western Soccer League
championship."
USF is currently loading the
league with a 4-1 record, and
Stanford is fourth with a 3-1 rec
ord. CCSF and California are tied
for second with a 3-0-1 record.
CCSF scored by making long
cross field passes from wing to
wing. Stanford hopes to use this
same strategy.
Wings Adam Bianchi and Mike
Tippett are just the men to pass
the Dons silly, and Dick Bart
lot I, Rune Engebrettsen and Ber
nio Knaggs can supply the scor
ing punch for the one or two
goals that will probably decide
the game.
1 ligh-scoring 112 o rw a r d Wolf
gang Storch will probably be
shifted back to halfback. Storch
is needed to break up the power
smashes by USF's middle trio.
The center of USF'Â« front line
does virtually all of their scor
ing. so defensive strength at half
back is vital.
The fullback slot is back at full
strength with the return to action
of Dan Farthing. Miklos Totossy
has done a creditable job for Far
ming while Dan was sidelined
with a broken hand and will prob
ably .start Saturday, but Farthing
will see plenty of action. Tom

| Lief will start at tho other full
back position.
Dick Voake is slated to play the
whole game as goalie. Hunt Bas
com, freshman goalie, is out of
the rest home after a bout with
the flu, but probably will not
play.
There is incentive besides the
league championship to win ihis
one, for there could be- several
Ail-American nominations riding
ion the outcome of the game.
