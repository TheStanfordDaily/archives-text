# Poloists Get Two Tries
## 
### 
Stanford's water polo team
gets a double chance this week
end to erase their 0-5 record as
they take on San Jose State at
San Jose this afternoon and
UCLA in the men's pool Saturday
morning.
"1 think we can beat UCLA this
time." said Coach Haynie despite
the 10-8 loss suffered at the hands
of the Bruins two weeks ago
down south.
The Indians have enhanced
their scoring potential this week
by switching the lineup so that
Bob Spence, George Harrison and
Andy Schvvarz, who have together
scored almost three-fourths of
Stanford's total points, are at for
ward positions. This puts Jack
and Bob Lorton who are better
ball handlers in backpool to get
the ball down fast.
San Jose who beat Stanford
18-13 throe weeks ago is expected
to repeat again this afternoon at
3:30.
