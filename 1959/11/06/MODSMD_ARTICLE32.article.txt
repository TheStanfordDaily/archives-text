# Coast Football
## 
### 
Here's how Coast football
shapes up this weekend:
Controversy -torn Southern
California will have another go
at it this weekend when they play
gracious host to the West Virginia
eleven at the Coliseum. The
battling Trojans will be seeking
their seventh straight win of the
season over the 3-4 Montaineers.
California, seemingly improv
ing every week but always los
ing, travels to Portland to meet
the strong Oregon Ducks whose
only loss was by 13-12 to Wash
ington. The Huskies, meantime,
are at home to play Oregon State.
Washington's lone loss was a
narrow one to USC and the
Huskies' victory over Oregon
puts them in the driver's seat in
the race for the Rose Bowl.
Washington State, with Ihree
straight victories on the ledger,
takes a week off. Luckless Idaho
will try again for its first victory
at the hands of Utah.
