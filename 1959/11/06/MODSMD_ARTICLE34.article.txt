# Three Top Spikers In Cross-Country Contest
## 
### 
Three runners, whose best
times over a four â€¢ mile course
are within 30 seconds of each oth
er, should provide some real tight
competition tomorrow when the
S t a n 112 or d cross-country squad
hosts UCLA and Cal.
Starting time is 10 a.m. at the
second tee of the Stanford golf
course.
Stanford's Bob Monzingo, Cal's

Alan Gaylord and UCLA's Ken
Riding are the three topnotchers
who could very well finish one,
two, three in any order. All have
turned in four-mile times between
19:30 and 20 minutes.
As for the meet itself the In
dians have to rate a-s the favor
ites by virtue of their victory last
week over Cal. The Bears beat
the Uclan thinclads two weeks
ago.
Also in the Cards' favor is their
lately developed tendency to run

well as a group. Tribe Coach
P a y to n Jor d a n says that he
thinks his squad should lie able
to beat any team it faces pro
viding it keeps turning in steady
performances.
About Monzingo in particular
Jordan has much to say. "Bob has
really been coming into his own,"
the head mentor said. "lie is go
ing to he hard to beat both in
cross-country and also in the mile
and two-mile this spring."
Rounding out the seven - man
squad for the Indians will be j
John Northway, Bertil Lundh,
Ernie Cunliffe, Keith Wallace,]
Bob Holgerson, the Tribe's only

fresh m a n entered, and Rich
i Klier.
