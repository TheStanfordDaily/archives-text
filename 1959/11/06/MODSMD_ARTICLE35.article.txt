# Papooses Meet Cal Frosh at Berkeley In Season's Second 'Little Big Game'
## 
### Chuck Bischoff 
The Indian Papooses will in
vade the lair of the Bear Cubs to
morrow morning as the freshman
gridders travel lo Berkeley for
the second of two "Little Big
Games.'" Despite a 40 to 34 vic
tory over the Cal frosh three
weeks ago, the Stanfords will not
be favored.
The Cal Bear Cubs have shown
tremendous improvement in re
cent weeks, crushing the Tro
babes of USC last Saturday on a
32 to 6 count. Their top running
is done by halfbacks Rudy Car
vajal and Bob Paterson and full
back Tony Mellos. Both Carvajal
and Patterson averaged better
than 10 yards per carry in the
first meeting of these two teams.
Cal has also shown an excellent
passing attack, with quarterback
Randy Gold doing most of the
throwing. The Bear Cubs should
pass more often than they did at
Stanford, when they completed
seven passes out of nine for 150
yards.
Many new faces will be seen

in the Papoose starting lineup I
as five regulars will be sidelined ,
by injuries. Star fullback Mick
Doherty hurt his aim last week,
and end Tom Fethcrston and
tackle C. B. Simons are out with
neck injuries. Guard Steve Play
er reinsured his ankle and end
Chris Jessen is laid up with a bad
knee. Despite this rash of inju
ries, which has practically deci
mated his starting lineup, coach
Homer Smith states, "Injuries
will not hurt us. My greatest dis
appointment is that these boys
will have to miss this last game
of the season."
A brighter note is the fact that
Ed Cummings, who ran wild in

the first Cal game, is back at his
right halfback post after being
hurt last week. Quarterback John
Power, who completed 19 passes
out of 30 against UCLA, will
again be th r o w in g frequently.
Replacing the injured play e r s
will be Bob Royse at fullback,
Tim Hansel at split end, Terry
Wilson at right end, Chuck Hart
wig at right tackle and Gary Lof
gren at right guard.
