# RHYMES TO AIM AT UCLA
## Halftime Show Features 'Tales for Baby Bruins' 
### 
"Tales for Baby Bruins," based entirely on familiar nursery
rhymes, will be the theme of the coordinated halftime show pre
sented by the Stanford card section and Stanford Marching Band
at tomorrow's football game. The show, by far the most complex
attempted thus far this season, will feature moving parts in each
of the Band formations.

In the first stunt, the Band will
form a huge baby buggy which
will move 25 yards across the
field as the wheels turn. The Stan
ford Band will serenade the baby
Bruin in the card section with
"You Must Have Been a Beauti
ful Baby."
Open season is declared on
bears as the Stanford Marching
Band forms a bow and arrow to
the tune of "A Hunting We Will
Go." As the Band swings into
"Ten Little Indians," the arrow
shoots into the Stanford rooting
section, piercing the poor Bruin
formed by the cards.
The baby Bruin gets a free trip
to London with the next stunt.
The Band forms London Bridge,
and. as the familiar strains of
"London Bridge Is Falling Down"
float across the field, the bridge
falls and then rises again. The
cards again form baby Bruin,
who this time unfortunately hap
pens to be under London Bridge
when it falls.
Stars appear in the cards and
on the field as the next stunt
begins. The cards form a falling
star against a night sky. A star
also appears in the Band and, as
we hear "Twinkle. Twinkle, Lit
tle tSar," the star twinkles.
To end the show, the cards will
form Stanford's fam o us "Ex
panding S" as the Band salutes
the spectators wits its equally
well-known trademark, the Queen
Anne Salute.
