# Philologists Hear About Latin Satire
## 
### Sue Wotring 
In his lecture to the Philologi
cal Association yesterday after
noon, Sir Ronald Syme stated
that satirists need not to have
"gone down into the belly of
tears" to obtain writing material.
Using the classic poet, Juvenal,
as an example. Oxford Professor
Syme criticized scholars' meth
ods of taking allusions in an au
thor's works as proof of events
in his own life.
Criteria Discussed
Professor Syme discussed the
criteria used to obtain informa
tion about Juvenal's life and
warned against confusing liter
ary allusions with historical al
lusions. He pointed out that Ju
venal was not satirizing the age
in which he lived, but rather an
earlier period.
As an example, Syme noted
that Juvenal in his attacks upon
literature chose to -satirize the
Latin epic which had, in fact, de
clined several years earlier.
Syme quoted Juvenal as writing,
"The present age is dangerous;
I must go for the dead."
Exile to Egypt
Many scholars like to believe
that Juvenal led a disappointing
and poverty-stricken life. Al
though there is some evidence of
Juvenal's having been to Egypt,
there is not conclusive proof that
he was exiled.
In conclusion, Syme asserted
that Juvenal did not want us to
know about him; he preferred to
remain "splendidly anonymous."
In answer to the question, "Why
did Juvenal write?" Syme re
plied. "Literary ambition." Per
haps he was "bitter like other
writers who would like a job but
have to fall back on teaching."
