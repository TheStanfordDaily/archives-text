# Socialists, Capitalists Misfire

### Austin Scott 
The Socialist Challenge to the
Stanford community ran out of
steam last night at the I Center.
"That Capitalism is inherently
unsound on both moral and eco
nomic grounds" had been an
nounced as the subject of a de
bate, but the Socialist caucus'
George Guy and Mike Freeman
never came to grips with Capital
ism's defenders Don Proudfoot
and Mike Willemsen.
Proudfoot and Willemsen first
| defined the methods by which
I property may be acquired under
| capitalism, pointing out that a
I man is entitled to what he cre
i ates, and that he deserves some
thing for increasing a product's
! value. They asked for an exam
j pie of working socialism to equal
America as an example of work
ing capitalism and challenged
their opponents either to prove
capitalism unsound or to provide
a better system.
Guy answered that the basic
tenet of capitalism is selfishness,
that capitalism is inefficient be
cause the investor does not have
complete knowledge of all invest
ment and job opportunities, and
j that the U.S. is dependent upon
j a war economy, but he failed to
! touch on any inherent weak
j nesses.
Freeman said that he did not
consider this to be a debate, and
that he could not answer all ques
tions in ten minutes. He proposed
; to offer a few thoughts on capi
talism. He claimed that Cadillacs
, and ranch houses are the aims of
I capitalists, and that "Their gods
are mammon and Madison Ave
nue." He concluded. "We must
seek compassion for all human
! beings - something which has
I been lost in capitalism."
