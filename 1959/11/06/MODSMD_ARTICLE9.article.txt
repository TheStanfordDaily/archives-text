## Scratch Sheet, Poli Union Discussed by Legislature 
### Doug Willis. Associate Editor 
Discussion on a Public Relations Committee report recommending
the institutionalization of the Scratch Sheet as a permanent ASSU
organ topped the business of Stanford's student Legislature last
night.
An alternative to institutionalizing the Scratch Sheet would be to

bring it up for Legislature's ap-,
proval before each publication.
Action on the Scratch Sheet may
be taken by Legislature next
week.

In other business a Cardinalsl
Board motion to set aside five
per cent of the funds collected ;
from each campus charity drive |
for a floating charity fund was |
sent to committee. Cardinals I
Board chairman Bruce Cochran
explained to Legislature that
such a floating fund is needed to
give the ASSU funds to make
token contributions to charities
that do not hold drives on cam
pus.
Legislature passed re c o m -
mendations to Stanford's Politi
cal Union pointing out weak
nesses in the Union's membership
requirements and the qualifica
tions for officers. Legislature
also recommended that the Politi
cal Union's funds should continue
to bo controlled directly by Legis
lature.
Legislature also approved the
results of this week's primary
elections and passed recommend
ations that the voting procedures
be reviewed for offices where

graduate students by schools
rather than living areas was also
sent to Elections Commission.
