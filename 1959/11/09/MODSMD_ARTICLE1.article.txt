# Cards Smothered By UCLA 55-13
## 
### Russ Allen 
Stanford Coach Jack Curtice thought his troubles were over
after the Tribe's 19-36 defeat by Washington State. Last Saturday
the UCLA Bruins proved him wrong as they ran over, through and
around the home town Indians defeating them by a whopping 55-
13 score.
Bruin backs Bill Kilmer and the two men named Smith, Ray and

j Skip, gained a total of 332 yards
to give the Bruins iheir second
victory of the season. I) was the
Cards worst defeat since the in
famous 0-72 loss 1o the s«ime
j Uclans in the Coliseum during
1 the 19.11 grid season.
However, t lie Bruins needed
help from the Indians to pile up
their 53 points. Seven Card
fumbles four of which were re
covered by the Bruins three of
these inside the Stanford 20 yard
line and 3 UCLA pass intercep
;ions certainly gave the Bruins at
least four of their eight touch
downs.
Many Injuries
To top all this misery, Curtice
learned that guards Tom Walsh
and Don Peter- both starters
; against UCLA were probably
lost for the season. Also it is
doubtful whether tackle Trev
Grimm or halfback Dick Bowers
will be able to play in next week's
action against Oregon State.
Walsh, along with fullback
! Archie Schmitt, suffered the old
bugaboo injury—a strained knee.
Grimm joined Peter and Rod
Sears with a shoulder separation
| while Bowers was troubled with
a pulled leg muscle.
Although certainly these in
juries to key men and the costly
offensive errors certainly hurt,
Coach Curtice admitted that the
Indians suffered an "old fash
, ioned licking" and another Card
win this year will depend on how
our line holds up.
Cheesecloth Line
The weakness in the Card line
1 was certainly evident to everyone
present last weekend as at times
the Tribe defensive forward wall
! resembled cheesecloth as the
Uclan backs could pour through
at will.
One pleasant glimmer camp oul
of the dark of Saturday's clash
ihe "discovery" of Card sopho
more quarterback Jim Smith.
After Dick Norman was pulled
out in the second quarter, Smith
who had been playing Norman's
defensive position when timeouts
would allow him to enter the
game came into the contest at
offensive quarterback and com
pleted five straight passes for- 4
yards, then pitched out to Gil
I)owd who scored the second
and last Tribe score.
However that was the end of
the Tribe's "togetherness" as they
could never act as a unit to score
in the remainder of the game.
Smith enderl up with a phenom
enal 10 for 1 I completion record
for 107 yards and will give Stan
ford fans something to look for
ward to in the future.

The game started out like
everybody expected UCLA drove
l ight down the field climaxing a
;"8 yard drive in eight plays to
score I he first TD. The Indians
came righl back with Mac Wylie
and Skip Face carrying the ball,
Norman passing and that special
reverse pass play with Chris Bur
ford throwing this time to John
Bond for 31 yards.
The quarter ended 7-7 and fans
thought that the game might end
a real cliff-hanger. Uclan gridders
began driving down the field
again and Card fans crossed

their fingers as the Tribe held on
downs on the Stanford nine yard
line.
However two plays later the
dam broke on the Indians
Schmitt fumbled on the four and
the "Baby Blue" quickly scored
making i! 14-7. UCLA kicked off,
the Tribe had to punt, and two
minutes later UCLA 21-Tribe 7.
Once again the Uclans kicked off
but this time the Cards didn't
wait too long.
A Blink of the Lye
On the first play, Gil Dowd
fumbled on the 12 yard line and
after a blink of Iho eyes, specta
tors could .see UCLA 2>S Stanford
7 on the scoreboard.
Stanford made one last attempt
as Smith then came in and the

sophomore from Grants Pass,
Ore., gave the Tribe a 13-29 do licit
as the teams left for the locker
rooms at halftime.
As regards to the second half
in die words of the Bruin choor
ing section "You ain't seen noth
in' yet." The Uclans piled up 20
points in the third quarter and
seven more in the final stanza to
win it 55-13.
Sonic Solace
As bad as it looked, there was
still some outstanding perform
ances by Card gridders. Captain
Burford played another one of
his brilliant games. "Bui 112" grab
bed off six passes for 17 yards
and played a good defensive game
as well.

When the Bruins would send
three blockers out ahead of Bruin
tailbacks Skip Smith or Kilmer,
old number SS would continually
be there knocking down the in
terference and turning the play
in.
Another unusual aspect of the
game was the record number of
Card receivers which pulled in
passes. The Tribe connected on
22 passes Norman had 11 for 24
and 72 yards; Smith hit for 10
and Burford had 1 for a total
of 240 yards to eleven Card re
ceivers.
Next weekend the Indians go
north to play the fast-improving
Beavers from Oregon State.
Needless to say that the Indians
will have to improve as the
orange and black Beavers are

another tough single-wing ball
club.

The game started out like
everybody expected UCLA drove
l ight down the field climaxing a
;"8 yard drive in eight plays to
score I he first TD. The Indians
came righl back with Mac Wylie
and Skip Face carrying the ball,
Norman passing and that special
reverse pass play with Chris Bur
ford throwing this time to John
Bond for 31 yards.
The quarter ended 7-7 and fans
thought that the game might end
a real cliff-hanger. Uclan gridders
began driving down the field
again and Card fans crossed

their fingers as the Tribe held on
downs on the Stanford nine yard
line.
However two plays later the
dam broke on the Indians
Schmitt fumbled on the four and
the "Baby Blue" quickly scored
making i! 14-7. UCLA kicked off,
the Tribe had to punt, and two
minutes later UCLA 21-Tribe 7.
Once again the Uclans kicked off
but this time the Cards didn't
wait too long.
A Blink of the Lye
On the first play, Gil Dowd
fumbled on the 12 yard line and
after a blink of Iho eyes, specta
tors could .see UCLA 2>S Stanford
7 on the scoreboard.
Stanford made one last attempt
as Smith then came in and the

sophomore from Grants Pass,
Ore., gave the Tribe a 13-29 do licit
as the teams left for the locker
rooms at halftime.
As regards to the second half
in die words of the Bruin choor
ing section "You ain't seen noth

points in the third quarter and
seven more in the final stanza to
win it 55-13.

As bad as it looked, there was
still some outstanding perform
ances by Card gridders. Captain
Burford played another one of
his brilliant games. "Bui 112" grab
bed off six passes for 17 yards
and played a good defensive game
as well.

When the Bruins would send
three blockers out ahead of Bruin
tailbacks Skip Smith or Kilmer,
old number SS would continually
be there knocking down the in
terference and turning the play
in.
Another unusual aspect of the
game was the record number of
Card receivers which pulled in
passes. The Tribe connected on
22 passes Norman had 11 for 24
and 72 yards; Smith hit for 10
and Burford had 1 for a total
of 240 yards to eleven Card re

Five more touchdowns were later scored by the Inspired I ( LA grid squad
Stanford Coach Jack Curtice thought his troubles were over
after the Tribe's 19-36 defeat by Washington State. Last Saturday
the UCLA Bruins proved him wrong as they ran over, through and
around the home town Indians defeating them by a whopping 55-
13 score.
Bruin backs Bill Kilmer and the two men named Smith, Ray and

Cards worst defeat since the in
famous 0-72 loss 1o the s«ime

However, t lie Bruins needed
help from the Indians to pile up
their 53 points. Seven Card
fumbles four of which were re
covered by the Bruins three of
these inside the Stanford 20 yard
line and 3 UCLA pass intercep
;ions certainly gave the Bruins at
least four of their eight touch
downs.
Many Injuries
To top all this misery, Curtice
learned that guards Tom Walsh
and Don Peter- both starters

lost for the season. Also it is
doubtful whether tackle Trev
Grimm or halfback Dick Bowers
will be able to play in next week's

Five more touchdowns were later scored by the Inspired I ( LA grid squad
Stanford Coach Jack Curtice thought his troubles were over
after the Tribe's 19-36 defeat by Washington State. Last Saturday
the UCLA Bruins proved him wrong as they ran over, through and
around the home town Indians defeating them by a whopping 55-
13 score.
Bruin backs Bill Kilmer and the two men named Smith, Ray and

j Skip, gained a total of 332 yards
to give the Bruins iheir second
victory of the season. I) was the
Cards worst defeat since the in
famous 0-72 loss 1o the s«ime
j Uclans in the Coliseum during
1 the 19.11 grid season.
However, t lie Bruins needed
help from the Indians to pile up
their 53 points. Seven Card
fumbles four of which were re
covered by the Bruins three of
these inside the Stanford 20 yard
line and 3 UCLA pass intercep
;ions certainly gave the Bruins at
least four of their eight touch
downs.
Many Injuries
To top all this misery, Curtice
learned that guards Tom Walsh
and Don Peter- both starters
; against UCLA were probably
lost for the season. Also it is
doubtful whether tackle Trev
Grimm or halfback Dick Bowers
will be able to play in next week's
action against Oregon State.
Walsh, along with fullback
! Archie Schmitt, suffered the old
bugaboo injury—a strained knee.
Grimm joined Peter and Rod
Sears with a shoulder separation

a pulled leg muscle.
Although certainly these in
juries to key men and the costly
offensive errors certainly hurt,
Coach Curtice admitted that the
Indians suffered an "old fash

win this year will depend on how
our line holds up.
Cheesecloth Line
The weakness in the Card line
1 was certainly evident to everyone
present last weekend as at times
the Tribe defensive forward wall

Uclan backs could pour through

One pleasant glimmer camp oul
of the dark of Saturday's clash
ihe "discovery" of Card sopho
more quarterback Jim Smith.
After Dick Norman was pulled
out in the second quarter, Smith
who had been playing Norman's
defensive position when timeouts
would allow him to enter the
game came into the contest at
offensive quarterback and com
pleted five straight passes for- 4
yards, then pitched out to Gil
I)owd who scored the second
and last Tribe score.
However that was the end of
the Tribe's "togetherness" as they
could never act as a unit to score
in the remainder of the game.
Smith enderl up with a phenom

for 107 yards and will give Stan

Norman passing and that special

defensive position when timeouts
would allow him to enter the
game came into the contest at
offensive quarterback and com
pleted five straight passes for- 4
yards, then pitched out to Gil
I)owd who scored the second
and last Tribe score.
However that was the end of
the Tribe's "togetherness" as they
could never act as a unit to score
in the remainder of the game.
Smith enderl up with a phenom
enal 10 for 1 I completion record
for 107 yards and will give Stan
ford fans something to look for
ward to in the future.

The game started out like
everybody expected UCLA drove
l ight down the field climaxing a
;"8 yard drive in eight plays to
score I he first TD. The Indians
came righl back with Mac Wylie
and Skip Face carrying the ball,
Norman passing and that special
reverse pass play with Chris Bur
ford throwing this time to John
Bond for 31 yards.
The quarter ended 7-7 and fans
thought that the game might end
a real cliff-hanger. Uclan gridders
began driving down the field
again and Card fans crossed

their fingers as the Tribe held on
downs on the Stanford nine yard
line.
However two plays later the
dam broke on the Indians
Schmitt fumbled on the four and
the "Baby Blue" quickly scored
making i! 14-7. UCLA kicked off,
the Tribe had to punt, and two
minutes later UCLA 21-Tribe 7.
Once again the Uclans kicked off
but this time the Cards didn't
wait too long.
A Blink of the Lye
On the first play, Gil Dowd
fumbled on the 12 yard line and
after a blink of Iho eyes, specta
tors could .see UCLA 2>S Stanford
7 on the scoreboard.
Stanford made one last attempt
as Smith then came in and the

sophomore from Grants Pass,
Ore., gave the Tribe a 13-29 do licit
as the teams left for the locker
rooms at halftime.
As regards to the second half
in die words of the Bruin choor
ing section "You ain't seen noth
in' yet." The Uclans piled up 20
points in the third quarter and
seven more in the final stanza to
win it 55-13.

As bad as it looked, there was
still some outstanding perform
ances by Card gridders. Captain
Burford played another one of
his brilliant games. "Bui 112" grab
bed off six passes for 17 yards
and played a good defensive game
as well.

When the Bruins would send
three blockers out ahead of Bruin
tailbacks Skip Smith or Kilmer,
old number SS would continually
be there knocking down the in
terference and turning the play
in.
Another unusual aspect of the
game was the record number of
Card receivers which pulled in
passes. The Tribe connected on
22 passes Norman had 11 for 24
and 72 yards; Smith hit for 10
and Burford had 1 for a total
of 240 yards to eleven Card re
ceivers.
Next weekend the Indians go
north to play the fast-improving
Beavers from Oregon State.
Needless to say that the Indians
will have to improve as the
orange and black Beavers are

another tough single-wing ball
club.

Stanford Coach Jack Curtice thought his troubles were over
after the Tribe's 19-36 defeat by Washington State. Last Saturday
the UCLA Bruins proved him wrong as they ran over, through and
around the home town Indians defeating them by a whopping 55-
13 score.
Bruin backs Bill Kilmer and the two men named Smith, Ray and

j Skip, gained a total of 332 yards
to give the Bruins iheir second
victory of the season. I) was the
Cards worst defeat since the in
famous 0-72 loss 1o the s«ime
j Uclans in the Coliseum during
1 the 19.11 grid season.
However, t lie Bruins needed
help from the Indians to pile up
their 53 points. Seven Card
fumbles four of which were re
covered by the Bruins three of
these inside the Stanford 20 yard
line and 3 UCLA pass intercep
;ions certainly gave the Bruins at
least four of their eight touch
downs.
Many Injuries
To top all this misery, Curtice
learned that guards Tom Walsh
and Don Peter- both starters
; against UCLA were probably
lost for the season. Also it is
doubtful whether tackle Trev
Grimm or halfback Dick Bowers
will be able to play in next week's
action against Oregon State.
Walsh, along with fullback
! Archie Schmitt, suffered the old
bugaboo injury—a strained knee.
Grimm joined Peter and Rod
Sears with a shoulder separation
| while Bowers was troubled with
a pulled leg muscle.
Although certainly these in
juries to key men and the costly
offensive errors certainly hurt,
Coach Curtice admitted that the
Indians suffered an "old fash
, ioned licking" and another Card
win this year will depend on how
our line holds up.
Cheesecloth Line
The weakness in the Card line
1 was certainly evident to everyone
present last weekend as at times
the Tribe defensive forward wall
! resembled cheesecloth as the
Uclan backs could pour through
at will.
One pleasant glimmer camp oul
of the dark of Saturday's clash
ihe "discovery" of Card sopho
more quarterback Jim Smith.
After Dick Norman was pulled
out in the second quarter, Smith
who had been playing Norman's
defensive position when timeouts
would allow him to enter the
game came into the contest at
offensive quarterback and com
pleted five straight passes for- 4
yards, then pitched out to Gil
I)owd who scored the second
and last Tribe score.
However that was the end of
the Tribe's "togetherness" as they
could never act as a unit to score
in the remainder of the game.
Smith enderl up with a phenom
enal 10 for 1 I completion record
for 107 yards and will give Stan
ford fans something to look for
ward to in the future.
