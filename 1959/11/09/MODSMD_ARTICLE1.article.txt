# Cards Smothered By UCLA 55-13

Stanford Coach Jack Curtice thought his troubles were over
after the Tribe's 19-36 defeat by Washington State. Last Saturday
the UCLA Bruins proved him wrong as they ran over, through and
around the home town Indians defeating them by a whopping 55-
13 score.
Bruin backs Bill Kilmer and the two men named Smith, Ray and

j Skip, gained a total of 332 yards
to give the Bruins iheir second
victory of the season. I) was the
Cards worst defeat since the in
famous 0-72 loss 1o the s«ime
j Uclans in the Coliseum during
1 the 19.11 grid season.
However, t lie Bruins needed
help from the Indians to pile up
their 53 points. Seven Card
fumbles four of which were re
covered by the Bruins three of
these inside the Stanford 20 yard
line and 3 UCLA pass intercep
;ions certainly gave the Bruins at
least four of their eight touch
downs.
Many Injuries
To top all this misery, Curtice
learned that guards Tom Walsh
and Don Peter- both starters
; against UCLA were probably
lost for the season. Also it is
doubtful whether tackle Trev
Grimm or halfback Dick Bowers
will be able to play in next week's
action against Oregon State.
Walsh, along with fullback
! Archie Schmitt, suffered the old
bugaboo injury—a strained knee.
Grimm joined Peter and Rod
Sears with a shoulder separation
| while Bowers was troubled with
a pulled leg muscle.
Although certainly these in
juries to key men and the costly
offensive errors certainly hurt,
Coach Curtice admitted that the
Indians suffered an "old fash
, ioned licking" and another Card
win this year will depend on how
our line holds up.
Cheesecloth Line
The weakness in the Card line
1 was certainly evident to everyone
present last weekend as at times
the Tribe defensive forward wall
