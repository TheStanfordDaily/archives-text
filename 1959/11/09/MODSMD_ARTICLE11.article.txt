# Mills Buzz with Activity As Steelworkers Return
## Taft-Hartley Law Guarantees Production for Just 80 Days 
### 
PITTSBURGH (/P) — Steel mills across the nation buzzed with
activity yesterday as thousands of striking workers responded to a
Taft-Hartley injunction to rebuild the country's nearly exhausted
| supply of steel.
Hours after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the injunction by an
8-1 vote Saturday, workers with lunch boxes under their arms headed
into miLls that had been strike-bound for 116 days. Some spoke
harshly of the injunction.
United Steelworkers President David J. McDonald, who headed
the USW fight for higher wages and improved fringe benefits, told
; the 500.000 strikers: i

"The Supreme Court has spo
ken. You are lo resume work
forthvvit h."
The union fight for contract
improvements may be far from
over. The injunction guarantees
production for only 80 days. If
differences are not settled be-j
tween union and management by
then the strike could be renewed.
Workers Busy
But the long negotiations dead
lock that dated back to the first
contract talks in New York last
! May was forgotten momentarily.
IBoth management and the work
i ers were busy getting mills back
j into production.
Steel producers estimated it
would take at least six weeks be
fore pre-strike production figures
about 2,600,000 ingot tons a
week would be reached again.
It will take much longer to get
mills up to peak production.
Even the first workers into the
plants knew they may have to
wait a month for their first pay
checks. Others knew it would be
longer than a month before they |
would be called back to work.
No Slowdown
McDonald scotched talk that
the Steelworkers may work sLow-j
ly in an attempt to hold down pro- j
duction. He said the workers
"were loyal citizens and would
comply with the law of the land."
In the early hours of the work
resumption much time was spent
checking ironmaking blast fur
naces and steel making open
hearths for damage. Undoubtedly
some of the brick linings in the
furnaces cracked during the idle
period.
It was a bitter blow to the union
when the Supreme Court upheld
the T-H injunction, which was
issued Oct. 21 in the U.S. District
Court at Pittsburgh. Enforce
ment was delayed more than two
weeks by USW appeals.
Nation Threatened
President Eisenhower asked for
the injunction Oct. 16. He said
the strike was theatcning the na
j tion's economic health and safety.
The union argued the strike was
causing discomfort but did not
threaten the nation.
| The Supreme Court's majority
i opinion rejected all contentions j
i the union made in urging that
I the injunction be struck down.
Meanwhile the big open-hearth
j steel furnaces in South San Fran
cisco and across the bay in Pitts
burg were fired up and fed yester
day with the first scrap metal
since the steel strike began.
Bethlehem Steel and U.S.
Steel's plants were expected to be
in full production by the end of j
the week, spokesmen said.

PITTSBURGH (/P) — Steel mills across the nation buzzed with
activity yesterday as thousands of striking workers responded to a
Taft-Hartley injunction to rebuild the country's nearly exhausted
| supply of steel.
Hours after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the injunction by an
8-1 vote Saturday, workers with lunch boxes under their arms headed
into miLls that had been strike-bound for 116 days. Some spoke
harshly of the injunction.
United Steelworkers President David J. McDonald, who headed
the USW fight for higher wages and improved fringe benefits, told
; the 500.000 strikers: i

"The Supreme Court has spo
ken. You are lo resume work
forthvvit h."
The union fight for contract
improvements may be far from
over. The injunction guarantees
production for only 80 days. If
differences are not settled be-j

then the strike could be renewed.
