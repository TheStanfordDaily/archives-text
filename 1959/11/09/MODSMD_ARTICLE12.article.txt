## 
### Camille de Campos 
In Iho beginning Lclancl Stan
ford said, "Let thou? he a Farm!"
— and there was a Farm.
Historians may doubt this ac
count of the establishment of the
Stanford land holdings on the San
Francisco peninsula, but this is
the way it all comes about during
this year's version of Ram's Head
Big Game Gaieties,
In the course of the show, the
Farm's hillbilly inhabitants and
primitive facilities give way to
enthusiastic students and techni
cal progress. However, a long
with Ihe benefits of modern liv
ing comes that bugaboo of cam
pus leaders apathy.
As a result, audiences will be
treated to a picture (if the kinds
of fans who do and who don't
go to Stanford's annual Big Game
with arch enemy California.
Madison Avenue on Farm
The situation gets critical
enough to have the University
call in a Madison Avenue adver
tising firm to help "sell" the foot
ball contest. But the firm decides
to sell the whole University to the
public instead. Mayhem ensues
before the "Indian in a Grey
Flannel Suit" concludes.

The Gai e tic s cast includes
award • winning soloist Ho d d y
Guittard, Stanford magician Dick
Zimmerman, and a Gaieties-pro
duced star, Carol McKanna.
Zimmerman first attracted at-1
tent ion around the Bay Area last j
spring when lie predicted a front j
page headline in the San Fran- j
cisco Chronicle two weeks in ad
vance. Zimmerman's prediction
was locked in a safe and one week
later, at the Con Home Carnival,
it was revealed with only one
word wrong.
Folk Singer
Along with these entertainers,
a folk-singing trio and the "We
Four" barbershop quartet will •
appear.
A 20-member chorus and a 30-
member dance ensemble will com
plement the music of a 22-piece
orchestra, directed by Russ Belts.
Twenty-four musical numbers are
slated for this year's production.
Famed Hollywood designer |
Edith Head will design costumes
for the show.
The production will be staged
in Memorial Auditorium Nov. 17 I
through Nov. 20. Tickets are l
available at the Memorial Audito-j
rium box office.
