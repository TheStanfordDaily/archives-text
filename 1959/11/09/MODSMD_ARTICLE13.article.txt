# Bermudas Out For Girls of South Africa
## 
### 
The Alpha Tau Omega house is
acting as host for ASSU scholar
William Jacobson, a commerce
and law graduate from the Uni
versity of Cape Town in South
Africa. This year ho is working
for the master's degree in busi
ness administration.
Comparing some of the lighter
aspects of student life, he said,
"We are just as keen as Stan
ford students on our sports and
campus nature study practicals.
but our female species have more
good sense than to wear these un
becoming 'Bermuda breeches'."
The University of Cape Town
was one of the two "open" uni
versities in South Africa, and as
a member of the Students' Rep
resentative Council of the univer
sity, Jacobson was actively em
broiled in the struggle against
the government imposing "apart
heid" in the university.
A government bill this year, he
said, "condemned Cape Town to
a segregated future."
Students in South Africa are
more conscious of political prob
lems, noted Jacobson.
