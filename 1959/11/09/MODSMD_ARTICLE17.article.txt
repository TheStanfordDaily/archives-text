Capitalism Report
Editor, The Daily:
The debate on Capitalism has
been inadequately reported under
the story "Socialists, Capitalists
Misfire." It was inadequate in
presenting both the views of the
affirmative as well as the nega
tive. Certainly because of space
limitations on the front page of
the Daily a more thorough cover
age of the arguments on both
sides would not be possible. I shall
not take this opportunity to gain
an unfair advantage by asserting
that either side of the debate pre
sented irrefutable proofs. 1 must,
however, indicate that the report
of the debate was tinted with
judgments reflecting the values
of the reporter.
To permit a fuller presentation
of the socialist viewpoint in their
criticism of capitalism, and also
of a fuller defense of capitalism,
the Socialist Caucus would wel
come a chance to argue their case
in the pages of the Daily, and
would welcome any member of
the Stanford community to take
up the defense of capitalism.

Closed Church
Editor, The Daily:
I, among others, am wondering
why the Memorial Church doors
are not kept open at all times.
Is the danger of vandalism to a
church so great as to justify de
priving students of its use?
Donaid L. Richardson
Song of America
Editor, The Daily:
After reading the inspiring and
inspired letter by H. F. Schick (as
he says the name is unimportant)
I started, as the writer had pro
phetically foreseen, to see music
and hear the light in gradual
ages. And behold (I guess this
a - roper word in context and
e ;ides biblical) the music was
another 'song of America"and

the light came from gaudy neon
signs on Main-Street, USA. My
heart not as completely fettered
by European ideologies as my
mind—rose to a sky pink in the
same shade as t lie 19G0 Cadillac
convertibles and the song had
been transcribed in a hit tunc and
was number one on the top forty
for twenty consecutive weeks,
its title "Don't Be Overanalyti
cally-Critical." And as the sooth
ing soft clouds of a pleasant
euphoria started to transport me
into stages of bliss only com
parable to that of a Stanford
senior who lands the famous
triple of collegiate success, the
crowning achievement of an
academic life: graduation diplo
ma, marriage to the gril he had
been pinned to for the last three
years, and a ten thousand dollar
job with IBM with retirement
guarantee as vice president at the
age of 32. But 1 digress.
Deprived of my critical facul
ties and furthermore willing to
accept without sceptical reserva
tions any gospel from the Ameri
can pulpit, I decided that 1 had
had my day in court a long time
ago, and that now the time had
come to enlist (not in the army—
in that connection I am a pacifist)
in the endless ranks of people
who had migrated the long dusty
road across the Atlantic and the
great plains to find opportunity,
the untutored voice of America
and the soaring spirits of people
like Mr. Schick, thirstily drinking
from the fountain of wisdom at
the steps of that great monument
lof the American dream: Hoover
tower. (In this connection I
mean neither the American dream
in Professor Guerard's interpre
tation as innocence nor the op
posite Freudian interpretation of
Hoover Tower. Actually I mean
nothing at all.)
And I tore up the petition for
turning over the Daily to foreign
students signed by 8,513 students
with a heroic sigh.
Ceterum censeo folium diei
delendum esse.

job with IBM with retirement
guarantee as vice president at the

Deprived of my critical facul
ties and furthermore willing to
accept without sceptical reserva
tions any gospel from the Ameri
can pulpit, I decided that 1 had
had my day in court a long time
ago, and that now the time had
come to enlist (not in the army—
in that connection I am a pacifist)
in the endless ranks of people
who had migrated the long dusty
road across the Atlantic and the
great plains to find opportunity,
the untutored voice of America
and the soaring spirits of people
like Mr. Schick, thirstily drinking
from the fountain of wisdom at
the steps of that great monument
lof the American dream: Hoover
tower. (In this connection I
mean neither the American dream
in Professor Guerard's interpre
tation as innocence nor the op
posite Freudian interpretation of
Hoover Tower. Actually I mean
nothing at all.)
And I tore up the petition for
turning over the Daily to foreign
students signed by 8,513 students
with a heroic sigh.

Capitalism Report
Editor, The Daily:
The debate on Capitalism has
been inadequately reported under
the story "Socialists, Capitalists
Misfire." It was inadequate in
presenting both the views of the
affirmative as well as the nega
tive. Certainly because of space
limitations on the front page of
the Daily a more thorough cover
age of the arguments on both
sides would not be possible. I shall
not take this opportunity to gain
an unfair advantage by asserting
that either side of the debate pre
sented irrefutable proofs. 1 must,
however, indicate that the report
of the debate was tinted with
judgments reflecting the values
of the reporter.
To permit a fuller presentation
of the socialist viewpoint in their
criticism of capitalism, and also
of a fuller defense of capitalism,
the Socialist Caucus would wel
come a chance to argue their case
in the pages of the Daily, and
would welcome any member of
the Stanford community to take
up the defense of capitalism.

I started, as the writer had pro

ages. And behold (I guess this
a - roper word in context and

another 'song of America"and

the light came from gaudy neon
signs on Main-Street, USA. My
heart not as completely fettered
by European ideologies as my

same shade as t lie 19G0 Cadillac

been transcribed in a hit tunc and
was number one on the top forty
for twenty consecutive weeks,
its title "Don't Be Overanalyti

ing soft clouds of a pleasant
euphoria started to transport me
into stages of bliss only com
parable to that of a Stanford

triple of collegiate success, the

Song of America
Editor, The Daily:
After reading the inspiring and
inspired letter by H. F. Schick (as
he says the name is unimportant)
I started, as the writer had pro
phetically foreseen, to see music
and hear the light in gradual
ages. And behold (I guess this
a - roper word in context and
e ;ides biblical) the music was
another 'song of America"and

the light came from gaudy neon
signs on Main-Street, USA. My
heart not as completely fettered
by European ideologies as my
mind—rose to a sky pink in the
same shade as t lie 19G0 Cadillac
convertibles and the song had
been transcribed in a hit tunc and
was number one on the top forty
for twenty consecutive weeks,
its title "Don't Be Overanalyti
cally-Critical." And as the sooth
ing soft clouds of a pleasant
euphoria started to transport me
into stages of bliss only com
parable to that of a Stanford
senior who lands the famous
triple of collegiate success, the
crowning achievement of an
academic life: graduation diplo
ma, marriage to the gril he had
been pinned to for the last three
years, and a ten thousand dollar
job with IBM with retirement
guarantee as vice president at the
age of 32. But 1 digress.
Deprived of my critical facul
ties and furthermore willing to
accept without sceptical reserva
tions any gospel from the Ameri
can pulpit, I decided that 1 had
had my day in court a long time
ago, and that now the time had
come to enlist (not in the army—
in that connection I am a pacifist)
in the endless ranks of people
who had migrated the long dusty
road across the Atlantic and the
great plains to find opportunity,
the untutored voice of America
and the soaring spirits of people
like Mr. Schick, thirstily drinking
from the fountain of wisdom at
the steps of that great monument
lof the American dream: Hoover
tower. (In this connection I
mean neither the American dream
in Professor Guerard's interpre
tation as innocence nor the op
posite Freudian interpretation of
Hoover Tower. Actually I mean
nothing at all.)
And I tore up the petition for
turning over the Daily to foreign
students signed by 8,513 students
with a heroic sigh.
Ceterum censeo folium diei
delendum esse.
