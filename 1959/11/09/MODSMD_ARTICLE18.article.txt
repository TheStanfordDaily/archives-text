### J.M. Roberts Associated Press News Analyst 
President Eisenhower's forth
coming goodwill trip to nine for
eign countries will transcend any
thing of this nature ever attempt
ed by a president before.
For many years the big powers
used to send naval contingents
around the world, "showing the
flag" to remind less-powerful
countries, and sometimes each
other, how they were expected to
act.
Now. instead of showing the
face of power, the United States
emphasizes the face of friendship
and cooperation in the develop
ment of countries which once
were little more than pawns in
big power diplomacy.
For many months, now, Ameri
can efforts have been directed to
ward maintaining the status quo
in Germany and Europe. Since
the war, a great deal more mu
tual aid money has gone to Eu
rope than to Asia.
The Soviet Union, on the other
hand, has sent numerous goodwill
missions into Asia, ranging from
Khrushchev on down, and has
made progress in her program of
economic infiltration.
But whoever thought that tlir
President of the United States
himself would attempt to show
the flag of friendship there and
get things back into balance?
