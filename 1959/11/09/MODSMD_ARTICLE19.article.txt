# EMBEDDED IN INNER QUAD
## Class of '96 First to Lay Traditional Class Plaque 
### Jerry Rankin 
May 25, 1N96, was a warm, pleas
ant spring day, the kind 1 hat
made one glad to be alive. Mem
bers and friends of the fifth class
to graduate from Stanford were
gathered around a class officer
who was saying:
"Generations, centuries shall
come and go, foi they are short in
the life of a great institution; and
when at length the lino of blocks
encircles the entire quadrangle,
the memory of this day will be
lost in the legends of the past;
forgotten the tales of today; for
gotten the origination of the cus
tom; forgotten the officers of the
class; forgotten all: hut '96 will
still remain embedded in the
rock."
(511 Years Ago
These words, spoken on an af
ternoon 63 years ago, reflect the
feelings of the Class of '96 as they
became the first class to dedicate
a class plate.
Since that day, 66 other plates
have been laid, starting in front
of Memorial Church and stretch
ing northward down the red and
grey stones of Inner Quad.
After the '96 plaque had been
laid, the Classes of '92, '93. '94 and
'95 returned to dedicate their
plates, all behind that of '96, so
that now the plaques run in a sin
gle line from '92 to '59.
Resting under the plates in
metal containers are the class
wills, histories and poems, ("on
temporary copies of the Quad, Se
quoia and The Daily are also
placed inside.
Made by Foundry
The Stanford foundry makes
the bronze plates, which are ap
proximately three feet square.
The Corporation Yard constructs
the containers.
The plate is laid each year dur
ing Senior Week. It was troweled
into place each year for more
than a quarter of a century by
Ben Facciola, foreman of the Uni
versity's masons. During the war
when metals were unobtainable,
he fabricated the markers with a
red - colored concrete mixture.
These were replaced in 1947 with
metal plates.
When Facciola died during the
1949-50 school year, his son, Fred
G. Facciola, a Palo Alto contrac
tor, volunteered to take over the
job of laying the plaques.
Go on Forever
It appears that the Class of '96
fully expected the tradition, sug
gested by treasurer Robert W.
Campbell, to go on forever.

In a letter to Dr. David Starr
Jordan, then Stanford president,
the Class of '96 suggested that the
plates be laid in the "center row
of blocks in front of what is to be j
the new chapel.
"The plan is to have each class
which shall graduate take up a :
block . . . until there would be a I
row of blocks entirely around the
Quadrangle, representing classes
for a period of 500 years or more." i
Class president R. C. Wilbur ex- j
plained that the class "trusted fu-1
hire classes to continue to do this
for all time." He thought that j
"when the ninetieth block shall
have been dedicated, '96 will be
forgotten"
Miscalculation
Although this doesn't appear!
likely, it does seem the class mis-J
calculated how long it would take
to fill a single row of blocks'
around the Inner Quad.
Dr. Jordan estimated, and has;
since been proven correct, that
only in the year 2517 will the |
plaques form a single circle of
the Inner Quad. It will be 5097, he
pointed out, before the other four
series of red-brown squares are
filled. Then, by changing to a dif
ferent color of metal for the plate. !
the alternating grey squares will
not be replaced until 8297.

feelings of the Class of '96 as they
became the first class to dedicate
a class plate.
Since that day, 66 other plates
have been laid, starting in front
of Memorial Church and stretch
ing northward down the red and
grey stones of Inner Quad.
After the '96 plaque had been
laid, the Classes of '92, '93. '94 and
'95 returned to dedicate their
plates, all behind that of '96, so
that now the plaques run in a sin
gle line from '92 to '59.
Resting under the plates in
metal containers are the class
wills, histories and poems, ("on
temporary copies of the Quad, Se

Made by Foundry
The Stanford foundry makes
the bronze plates, which are ap
proximately three feet square.
The Corporation Yard constructs
the containers.
The plate is laid each year dur
ing Senior Week. It was troweled
into place each year for more
than a quarter of a century by
Ben Facciola, foreman of the Uni
versity's masons. During the war
when metals were unobtainable,
he fabricated the markers with a
red - colored concrete mixture.
These were replaced in 1947 with
metal plates.
When Facciola died during the
1949-50 school year, his son, Fred
G. Facciola, a Palo Alto contrac
tor, volunteered to take over the
job of laying the plaques.
Go on Forever
It appears that the Class of '96
fully expected the tradition, sug
gested by treasurer Robert W.
Campbell, to go on forever.

In a letter to Dr. David Starr
Jordan, then Stanford president,
the Class of '96 suggested that the
plates be laid in the "center row
of blocks in front of what is to be j
the new chapel.
"The plan is to have each class
which shall graduate take up a :
block . . . until there would be a I
row of blocks entirely around the
Quadrangle, representing classes
for a period of 500 years or more." i
Class president R. C. Wilbur ex- j
plained that the class "trusted fu-1
hire classes to continue to do this
for all time." He thought that j
"when the ninetieth block shall
have been dedicated, '96 will be
forgotten"
Miscalculation
Although this doesn't appear!
likely, it does seem the class mis-J
calculated how long it would take
to fill a single row of blocks'
around the Inner Quad.
Dr. Jordan estimated, and has;
since been proven correct, that
only in the year 2517 will the |
plaques form a single circle of
the Inner Quad. It will be 5097, he
pointed out, before the other four
series of red-brown squares are
filled. Then, by changing to a dif
ferent color of metal for the plate. !
the alternating grey squares will
not be replaced until 8297.

encircles the entire quadrangle,
the memory of this day will be

The plate is laid each year dur
ing Senior Week. It was troweled
into place each year for more
than a quarter of a century by
Ben Facciola, foreman of the Uni
versity's masons. During the war
when metals were unobtainable,
he fabricated the markers with a
red - colored concrete mixture.
These were replaced in 1947 with
metal plates.
When Facciola died during the
1949-50 school year, his son, Fred
G. Facciola, a Palo Alto contrac
tor, volunteered to take over the
job of laying the plaques.
Go on Forever
It appears that the Class of '96
fully expected the tradition, sug
gested by treasurer Robert W.
Campbell, to go on forever.

In a letter to Dr. David Starr
Jordan, then Stanford president,
the Class of '96 suggested that the
plates be laid in the "center row
of blocks in front of what is to be j
the new chapel.
"The plan is to have each class
which shall graduate take up a :
block . . . until there would be a I
row of blocks entirely around the
Quadrangle, representing classes
for a period of 500 years or more." i
Class president R. C. Wilbur ex- j
plained that the class "trusted fu-1
hire classes to continue to do this
for all time." He thought that j
"when the ninetieth block shall
have been dedicated, '96 will be
forgotten"
Miscalculation
Although this doesn't appear!
likely, it does seem the class mis-J
calculated how long it would take
to fill a single row of blocks'
around the Inner Quad.
Dr. Jordan estimated, and has;
since been proven correct, that
only in the year 2517 will the |
plaques form a single circle of
the Inner Quad. It will be 5097, he
pointed out, before the other four
series of red-brown squares are
filled. Then, by changing to a dif
ferent color of metal for the plate. !
the alternating grey squares will
not be replaced until 8297.
May 25, 1N96, was a warm, pleas
ant spring day, the kind 1 hat
made one glad to be alive. Mem
bers and friends of the fifth class
to graduate from Stanford were
gathered around a class officer
who was saying:
"Generations, centuries shall
come and go, foi they are short in
the life of a great institution; and
when at length the lino of blocks
encircles the entire quadrangle,
the memory of this day will be
lost in the legends of the past;
forgotten the tales of today; for
gotten the origination of the cus
tom; forgotten the officers of the
class; forgotten all: hut '96 will
still remain embedded in the
rock."
(511 Years Ago
These words, spoken on an af
ternoon 63 years ago, reflect the
feelings of the Class of '96 as they
became the first class to dedicate
a class plate.
Since that day, 66 other plates
have been laid, starting in front
of Memorial Church and stretch
ing northward down the red and
grey stones of Inner Quad.
After the '96 plaque had been
laid, the Classes of '92, '93. '94 and
'95 returned to dedicate their
plates, all behind that of '96, so
that now the plaques run in a sin
gle line from '92 to '59.
Resting under the plates in
metal containers are the class
wills, histories and poems, ("on
temporary copies of the Quad, Se
quoia and The Daily are also
placed inside.
Made by Foundry
The Stanford foundry makes
the bronze plates, which are ap
proximately three feet square.
