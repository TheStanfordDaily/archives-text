# Madame Pandit Outlines India's Desires for Peace

### Elna Rodenhouse 
"Even if one country breaks a
peace treaty, this does not mean
thai the treaty is inherently
wrong; nor does it give the other
country the right to break the
treaty also." With these words,
Madame Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit,
India's high commissioner to
London and former president of
the UN General Assembly, out
lined in her lecture here Friday
her country's deep desire for
peace at all costs.
India's obligations to her east
ern neightbors first, and to the
rest of the world next, increase
her desire to stick to this policy.
"India will only take up arms ii
the ultimate is reached — if all
else fails. Negotiation is the right
path and the path we will follow,"
she indicated, in talking about the
Red Chinese border infiltrations.
Breaking Point Near
"I don't think we would will
ingly go to war," she commented,
"but we are very near the break
ing point now."
India's hopes for peace have
come about because of its history
and because of sociological and
economic reasons.
India, as an independent nation,
was born in 1947, in the time of
"flux and change," Madame
Pandit told her audience. Its
leaders first had to stabilize the
people, to establish an economy
and to try to function in the
brotherhood of nations.
Democracy had a very simple
definition for Indians then: it
meant food, shelter and oppor
tunity. "If we could provide this," |
Madame Pandit said, "we could j
then build toward a political de
mocracy."
Independence Achieved Peacefully
India, under Mohandas Gandhi's
guidance, became the first nation
to gain its independence by non
violent methods. From this first
lesson, the Indian political philos
ophy has become one of striving
for democratic ends through
peaceful means at almost any
cost.
At the time of its birth as a
nation, "India had no traditional
friends, no traditional enemies."
Upon entry into the United Na
tions, she said, India found a di
vided world.
It became India's policy to work
as a reconciliation force. This
meant judging each question on j
its merits, not necessarily on the
merits of those countries backing
it. Because of this, she felt, India
has been thought to be "going
back" on democracy.
Democracy is at present taking I

many different forms, she said,
because the countries following it
are developing at different rates.
"There are far greater divisions
between prosperity and hunger
than there are between democ
racy and communism.
Bridge Hunger Clap
"Success or failure of democ
racy and peace depends greatly
on how quickly the gap between
the world's food production and
the hungry people of Asia and
Africa is bridged.
"The leadership we want from
you is not of Cadillacs and .jets
and science's achievements," she
explained. "We want that too, . . .
but it is not your achievements
today that will be the test of sur
vival. It is for Ihe heart of man
kind that democracy and com
munism are fighting. The race
will be won by the person whose
affirmations will be followed by
action.
"I believe we are dedicated to
the same thing," she said. "I
would like to see the trust of old

friends grow between us. But I
don't want to see complacency.
"Peace will not grow from a
summit meeting. Peace will not
come from God—God helps those
who help themselves. Peace will
only come from those who work
individually for better under
standing and trust in the world
community.
Key of Democracy
"The key of democracy is being
forged in India. If that key is not
forged, then the future, not only
of Aisa, but the whole democratic
world, is at stake.
"We want your sympathy, your
understanding, your support. But
we are not ready for entangling
alliances and we don't want
them."
