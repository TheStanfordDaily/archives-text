# Coaches Attribute Rout to Mistakes
## 'Defense Disintegrated' 
### Roy Schmidt 
Saturday was a dark day in the
annals of Stanford football, and
the deep, tired lines in Jack Cur
tice's face reflected the gloom of
the occasion. His team had just
been badly beaten by an under
dog UCLA eleven. 55 13.
"There's no reason at till why
this should happen," he offered.
"We work more on defense than
on offense in practice, but . . ."
The Card defensive unit yielded
350 yards on the ground, most of
which came on plays up the mid
dle.
Tackle Troubles
"You've got to have a tough
line against any single wing out
fit, and ours just disintegrated."
Curtice was especially concerned
over the tackle situation. He had
to play Jack Gordon the whole
game at offensive left tackle and
use John Thomas, a center, on de
fense.
The offensive picture wasn't
much bl ighter 1 . .J itt e ry Card
backs fumbled seven times and
had three passes intercepted.
"They didn't stop us; we stopped
ourselves, C u rti ce noted. "We
gave them the ball deep in our
own territory too often.
The nation's leading passer,
Dick No r m a n , on whose arm
rests the fortune of Stanford foot
ball .had one of his worst days as
an Indian. The slender junior
completed only 11 of 24 for 72
yards and had one intercepted.
Smith Sparks
Sophomore quarterback Ji m
Smith sparked Stanford's only
sustained drive of ihe game as he
led the Indians to their second
touchdown in the closing minutes
of the first half. Smith completed
10 of 1 1 tosses for 107 yards.
"For a sophomore Smith
played real well," commented
Cactus Jack. "Those two inter
ceptions were caused by inexpe
rience as much as anything else."
Curtice indicated thai he felt
before the game that the team
wasn't up for this one. "I really
feel sorry for them," he said.
"They hate it worse than I do."
Assistant Athletic Director
Chuck Taylor offered one conso
lation to the dejected head coach.
"The same thing happened to me.
Jack. In fact I hold the record for
that 72-0 defeal in '54."
In reply to this Curtice man
aged a weak smile 1 hough if was
easy to see that ii took a great
deal of effort.
Next S a t u r d a y Curtice will
have to face a no ther team
schooled in the Red Sanders style
of single wing in the Oregon
State Beavers. The Beavers will
enter the game with the same
sort of record that UCLA had, a
win and a lot of close losses.
