# 'Best Game This Year'
## 
### John Osmundson 
UCLA coach Billy Barnes hur
ried to his team's dressing room
after the game, delivered a short
pep talk to the enthusiastic,
cheering southern gridders and
then emerged with a goal-post
! wide grin and the game ball
: tucked neatly under one arm.
Of the game ball, which his
team voted to give him. Barnes
commented, "It isn't the first
game ball I've gotten, but it's the
best one."
The "best" comment was dear
ly understandable in view of UC
LA's past performances this sea
j son. Although they played good
football in earlier games, the
J team was killed by costly mis
j takes. Saturday the Bruins were
j an almost perfect team with ev
eryone blocking and carrying out
'assignments with precision.
Key Players
Barnes began to name key UC
LA players in the contest, but
I then stopped. "How can you sin
; gle out anyone in a game like
this?'' he asked. "Thirty-eight out
of Ihe 30 players on our traveling
j squad were in the game and ev
ery one of them was outstand
i ing."
Tailback Bob Smith was the
only Uclan not to see action and
:that was flue to injuries. His po
sition was ably filled, however,
wilh Bill Kilmer and Skip Smith
totaling for 270 yards from the
backfield spot.
Kilmer looked sharp all week
j in prcgame practices, but if Bob
Smith had been well Kilmer
would have been another second
string runner. As it was he be
came the game's offensive star
with 113 yards rushing and 57
j more on passes.
Strong Defense
Strong UCLA defense not only
stopped Card offensive attempts,
but provided Bruin scoring
chances with recovered fumbles
and intercepted passes. Third
string guard Tom Payton was
conceded by Barnes to be a stand
out of the outstanding southland
ers after he intercepted a pass
and then recovered a fumble.
"There was a mixup on that
pass B u r 112 or d threw," revealed
Barnes, "but after that the de
; fense straightened out."
The Bruin head mentor would
i n't rate Stanford and California
j after beating Cal three weeks ago
j 10-12 and then running up a 42-
j point margin against the Indians.
Barnes did offer some relief to
believers in comparative scores:
"'We're not that much better than
Stanford; it's just that we finally
played errorless ball and Stan
ford was hurt by the same costly
I mistakes we have had."
