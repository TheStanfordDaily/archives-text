### Babara Hicks 
The friendliness of the Russian
people was emphasized by eight
speakers who described their ex
periences in Russia at a meeting
Friday night at the Women's
Clubhouse.
Five of the students--David
Hamilton. Jon net Kerns, Ruth
Radford, Mary Patzer and Ed
Walker visited Russia this sum
mer on a program designed to j
test the effectiveness of special
language training.
Bill Hutchinson worked with
the American Exhibition in Mos
cow. and Jim Coogan and Larry
Orton. both freshmen, were part
of ;i tour of recent high school
graduates.
Each of the students told of
many occasions on which, once
the Russians discovered the visi
tors were from America, crowds
numbering in the hundreds would
form and the students would bo
kept for hours, asking and an
swering questions.
How We Live
Hutchinson, commenting on
the fascination of the Russian
people for machines which were
lacking in the Exhibition said
the Russians wanted to see how
Americans lived, but instead were :
shown what they lived with.
Miss Radford told of some of j
the questions asked her in con
nection with religion. One old
woman wanted to know if Ameri
cans believed in the same God thej
Russians do and another asked if
there were R ussi a 11 Orthodox j
churches in America.
Most Touching*
One of the most touching expe
riences of the tour, according to
Miss Kerns, took place in a mar- [
ket place. She had spent three
hours answering questions about I
America. At last an old man came 1
up, tears in his eyes, to her with i
a bouquet of flowers to express
the thanks of the people to her
for telling them something of
America.
The two freshmen. Coogan and
Orton, said the post high school
tour was something new to the
Russians, and they were constant
ly followed. They gave the only
report of running into agitators.
Friday's m eel i 11 g was spon
sored by the Russian section of
the Department of Modern Euro
pean Languages. Dr. Jack A. Po
sin and Mrs. Sana Kliachko were
in charge. I
