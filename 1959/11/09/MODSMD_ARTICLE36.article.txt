likewise in the second half, failing only after Ihev had penetrated

deep into enemy territory.

I start that neither team would
score anything like the forty
j poin's racked up by the Papooses
in their previous •!() t<> ,'M victory
over the Boar Cubs in the first
i Little Big dame." S'anford could
j not muster a first down in the
| entire first quarter, running only
i six plays for a net of minus four
yards. Lale in the quarter the
Bear Cubs star ed a sustained
march of 7(5 yards in 1(5 plays
climaxed as Bob Patterson broke
| >ver the middle for 11 yards and
! ihe first touchdown. A few tnin
jutes later a Papoose fumble gave
j Cal the ball on the Stanford 33,
j and quarterback Randy Gold
i tossed to Dave Muga in the end
'one for a 16 yard scoing play. An
offsides penalty of ! '■.< yards and
; a forward fumble recovered by
Cal gave the Bear ('ubs a two
I point conversion and ihe score
! stood 11 to 0 at halftime.

With 28 minutes remaining in
| the game and the offense finally
! clicking, things did not look too
I bad for Stanford. Unfortunately,
the rest of the game turned out

to lie <»Mc ' hwarted Stanford drive
alt or another. The Papooses
racked up live straight first
downs to move lo the Cal 14,
only to he stopped with only two
yards in four plays.

territory kille ! the last Stanford
hope and sent the Papooses to a
! I to 7 defeat.
