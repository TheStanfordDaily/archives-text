# U.S. Growth Can Double: Rockefeller
## 
### 
NEW YORK (A') -Republican
Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller
suggested last night that if Amer
ican labor foregoes further work
week reductions the national eco
j nomic growth rate can almost
i double.
lie said such a Â«tep could bring
i higher living standards, expanded
government services and as much
j as a 15 per cenl cut in taxes.
In the face of growing union
pressure for a 30 - hour week.
Rockefeller told the Economic
Club of New York in a major
prepared speech:
No Reason
"There is no compelling reason j
why American growth should be j
j fixed at the historic 3 per cent j
i rate, or even tho postwar 4 per
| cent rate.
"Since 1930, our average work
week has declined from over 48
! hours to under 38 hours, or by!
\3Va hours every decade. The in-j
crease in leisure has been an im-1
portant social gain, but it has also I
diluted our production record, i
Few would urge that wo should i
keep cutting the work week at
this rate for an indefinite period j
into the future.
5% Within Reach
"If we should decide at any!
| point to forego further week
| week reductions in favor of in
creased output of goods and serv-j
! ices, this of itself would allow us
to realize the full benefit of our
almost 3 per cent annual increase
in output per man hours. This
normal increase in productivity,
plus a reasonably expectable 2!
per cent annual increase in the)
work force, would put a 5 per
cent growth rate well within our 1
reach."
Rockefeller is widely regarded j
as an undeclared candidate for
the GOP presidential nomination I
for 1960. His forum was a dinner)
gathering of some of the top men
in industry and finance in the
East.
