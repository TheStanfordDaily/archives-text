### 
NEW DELHI, India (TP) - Red China's Premier Chou En-lai pro
posed yesterday to settle the angry border dispute with India at a
personal mooting with Prime Minister Nehru. Indian sources said
Chou's new approach is unacceptable.
Refusing to give ground on claims to 40,000 square miles of Ilima-

layan soil India regards as its
own, the Chinese Premier sug
gested both sides pull back their
forces 12 1 miles in the disputed
zone.
"The entire approach is repug
nant to India's stand on its inter-;
nationally recognized border," an
authoritative Indian source said, i
Nehru himself mentioned j
Choii's note in a report to a com-!
mittee of his Congress Party but
expressed no opinion, a committee
member reported. Nehru has de
clared he is willing to negotiate
but has never said anything about
sitting down with Chou to talk
things over.
Chou's note was handed to Neh- j
ru Sunday, then broadcast yester
day by Peiping radio before its j
contents were made known here.'
If he suggested a site for the j
meeting there was no public men- j
tion of it.
The Red Chinese Premier, in j
urging prompt action on his j
plan, said "clashes which both
sides do not want to see may oc- j
cur in the future."
"The Chinese government pro
poses that, in order to discuss
further the boundary question
and other questions in the rela
tions between the two countries,
the. prime ministers of the two
countries hold talks in the im
mediate future," Chou's note said.
Chou suggested that the armed
forces of China and India each
withdraw 12'â€¢> miles at once from
the so-called MacMahon line. |
The MacMahon lino was drawn j
in 1914 by Sir Henry MacMahon, |
a British Indian official, to show
the border between India and
Tibet.
No Chinese government ever (
has recognized the line. Red China
claims territory as far as 80 miles !
south of the lino in India's North
east Frontier Agency, where I
some border clashes have oc
curred.
