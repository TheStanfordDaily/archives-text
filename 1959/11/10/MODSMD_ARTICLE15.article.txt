# Display Orders For Big Game Are Due Today
## 
### 
The deadline has been advanced
to noon today for ordering dec
orating paper for Big Game house
decorations, according to Decora
lion Chairman Dick Landes.
Orders must be made today so
that there will be time to fill
the orders by next week.
Orders can be placed at the
ASSU office. Boxes of regular
paper are priced at $1.20 each
and metallic-colored paper costs
about twice as much. Also avail
able are brown corrugated sheets
in two sizes.
Each house decoration chair
man has the responsibility to
order exactly the amount of paper
that is needed, because there will
not be time to reorder.
Paper ordered today can be
picked up at the ASSU office Nov.
16, 17 and 18 from 3:30 to 5:30
p.m. Houses will be billed for all
paper they order, whether it is
picked up or not.
Landes emphasized that "house
decorations are the big event of
Homecoming this year" and urged
living groups to consider mech
anized displays.
