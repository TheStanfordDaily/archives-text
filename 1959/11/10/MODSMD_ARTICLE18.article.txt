# Post Office Foundation Adapted
## 
### 
Despite government specifica
tions, the present foundation for
| the steel boxes at the new Stan
! ford Post Office will he used. In
: stallation of the boxes began yes
terday morning.
Foreman of the mails, Henry
1 Quinn, reported last week that
the concrete foundation laid to
j support the rows of boxes was too
narrow and had to be torn out.
He revealed that a wider founda
! tion, one adhering to government
specification, would have to be
j poured.
This difficulty was to have post
poned the scheduled January
opening date of the new office.
Foundation Adapted
Quinn reported yesterday how
' ever, that the small foundation is
! being used. Two by six wooden
I beams are being installed on top
j of the concrete to which the boxes
| will be anchored. Quinn believes
1 that this arrangement will prove
j satisfactory.
j He said that the cost of tear
| ing out and replacing the con
crete was a determining factor in
utilizing Ihe present undersized
installation. He stated that the
government is "stuck with" the
. foundation as it now exists.
Government Restrictions
The problem arose originally
I from a set of government restric
tions controling post office con
struction. A six inch foundation,
fully adequate to support wooden
boxes, was installed but was
found to be insufficient to carry
the weight of steel boxes. For
steel boxes, the government re
quires that a 12 inch foundation
be used.
