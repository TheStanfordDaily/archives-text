# FRANKENSTEIN
## Folk Art Is Overlooked Says Critic 
### Ann Miller 
Alfred V. Frankenstein, San
Francisco art critic, spoke yester
day on "The Negro, the Hangman,
and the Sign Painter," in a lecture j
sponsored by the Stanford Fac
ulty Women's Club.
Frankenstein discussed the :
style and effects of American;
folk painting and included a col-1
lection of slides.
Recent Emphasis
Thirty years ago there was
very little enthusiasm about folk
painting but interest in this field :
has grown considerably in recent
years. Frankenstein feels that,
despite this increased emphasis,
many have overlooked the signifi
cance of these paintings.
He began by contrasting folk;
paintings with the works of con-1
temporary artists, and pointing
out their similarities in such
areas as perspective and intensity, i
"As wc study modern artists and i
their use of perspective relation
ship and naturalism, we begin to !
appreciate and value folk paint
ing."
New Discovery
A group of paintings were re
cently found in New York state
about the trial of an illiterate and}
penniless Negro who murdered a 1
family for revenge against so-j
ciety. The series was done by an i
unknown sign painter for exhibi
tion in an Auburn, New York, I
saloon during the trial. Franken
stein showed these paintings and
discussed how tiiey revealed 1
many aspects of American life
not evident in other paintings,]
such as fascination with death,
interest in religion, and a definite
macabre feeling.
The subjects often include re-1
ligious irleas or legendary figures,
for much of this folk painting was '
meant to give the rural people;
the images and feelings they
craved.
