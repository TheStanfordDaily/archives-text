## EDITORIALS, COLUMNS, INTERPRETATION We Hate Kids, Too 
### 
Bill Kartozian says,""I hate kids," and everyone laughs.
The Stanford band gets together, says, '"We 11at«■ kids," and
everyone laughs again.
Vie're getting to hate kids, too. In some respects, it's still a
laughing matter. But in others, it's getting to be (in (art, has
long been) a big problem.
The kids we refer to are, of course, those thousands who run
riot near the end of every football game in the stadium.
In case vou haven't been to a game recently, the situation is
this: Willi about five minutes to play, hordes of the 5-15 set
pile up in the first rows of seats in the end /one and knot-hole
gang sections. With about two minutes to play, they jump the
low railing and crowd the running track. \\ ilh a minute to go,
they're solid at the out-of-bounds and end /one lines on the
field. On the last play, they're all over the poor ball carrier, who
already has II opposition players to contend with.
The youthful horde, as far as most observers were concerned,
cost Stanford a touchdown two years ago in the Big Game. Lead
ing Cal 14-12, the Indians were on the Bears' one-yard line. On
the final play, Jackie Douglas ran a quarterback sneak. He wasn't
just tackled by Bears, lie was swarmed under by thousands of
kids.
The officials decided after a time that he liadn I scored. But
who was to know with the mass of humanity on the field? Had
Stanford been trailing In two points, we'll bet there would have
been blood shed over the decision —and plenty of it would have
been the kids'.
With the problem getting gradually worse, and with another
Big Game coining up here in less than two weeks, we think it's
time for some action.
W hen it comes to thinking seriously about the situation, it
becomes obvious that it isn't really the kids who are at fault.
Kids are alike all over, but places like the Los Angeles Coliseum
and Cal's Memorial Stadium don't have end-of-game demonstra
tions as bad as those here.
The student police can't really be blamed. How can even as
many as 30 or 40 of them contain thousands? And a few sheriff's
deputies can't help much more.
So, unless the athletic department can come up with a better
idea, we'd just as soon see them erect a fine-mesh wire screen in
front of all the end zone and knot-hole gang sections of the stands.
Presently-existing screening already separates these areas from
other sections; thus, screening across the front would effectively
isolate the kids from the field. Oh, a few fans might gripe about
obstruction —but no one has had much trouble looking through
Walter O'Malley's screen at the Coliseum.
Again, this may not be the world's best solution. But unless
someone thinks of something better fast, we think it's one the
athletic department should look at —and implement before Nov.
21, if this is possible.
