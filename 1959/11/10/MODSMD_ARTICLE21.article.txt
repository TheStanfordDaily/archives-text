Are you, personally, willing to
do .something to make sure that
deceit and dishonesty are ban
ished from the television screen
in your home?
I believe that something use
ful and dramatic can be done by
the public —and this, if it is to
have any effect, means you, not
somebody else.
I believe that something dra
matic and forceful can he done
by the millions of TV viewers 1o
bring home to the sponsors, to
the networks, to the producers, to
the writers, to the performers,
that we mean business, that we
aren't fooling, that unless this
awful, sordid, squalid mess of
rigged shows is totally cleaned
up or cleaned out, something pain
ful is going to happen.
Are we individual and unor
ganized viewers absolutely help
less to register a collective pro
test and a collective demand?
What can be done? This can
be done:
Why don't a few million view
ers-all who want to raise their
voice to say that it isn't going to
bo enough to pretty up the edges
of the TV screen—pick a date and
a prime time of adult program
ming and all at once observe an
hour of television silence?
Any date, any evening time
would do it, but viewers who
want to join in such an hour of
silence, an hour of warning,
would need to pick it far enough
ahead so that they could act
simultaneously. Therefore, why
not the following:
The date — Tuesday night,
Nov. 17.
The time —10 p.m. local stand
ard time.
The place—Your living room,
and at Ibis hour, Tuesday night,
Nov. 17, at 10 p.m., if you are
looking at television, you can
join with other viewers across
the country in simultaneously

clicking off the dial; and if you
are not looking at television,
you refrain from doing so be
tween 10 and 11 p.m.
Have no doubt that the net
works — and sponsors — would
watch — and measure — such a
demonstration very sensitively.
I don't even know what pro
grams are scheduled for Tuesday
evening, Nov. IT, but since 10
o'clock, E.S.T., would be 9 p.m.
in the Midwest, 8 p.m. in the
Rocky Mountain states, and 7 p.m.
on the Pacific coast, the hour of
silence and the hour of warning
would be aimed at no single pro
gram.
The latest testimony released
by the House Investigating
Committee shows that even the
little tots, the famous "Quiz
Kids" of some years ago, was
a rigged performance, and that
11-year-old Patty Duke was en
listed to engage in the fake
question-and-answer on "The
$64,000 Challenge," and then
sternly cautioned that she must
not tell the truth about the
rigging!
No wonder the President of
the United States has said that
television "has done an awful
thing to the American people."
You can telephone your disgust
to your local station. You can
write a letter to your newspaper.
You can telegraph your Congress
man.
But the only way you can
register a monumental protest
which says: Clean house —or
else, is for several million TV
viewers to act together simul
taneously.
Wouldn't an hour of television
silence which would be an hour
of warning on Tuesday evening,
Nov. 17, at 10 p.m., local standard
time, do it ?

11-year-old Patty Duke was en
listed to engage in the fake
question-and-answer on "The
$64,000 Challenge," and then

No wonder the President of

You can telephone your disgust
to your local station. You can
write a letter to your newspaper.
You can telegraph your Congress
man.
But the only way you can
register a monumental protest
which says: Clean house —or
else, is for several million TV
viewers to act together simul
taneously.
Wouldn't an hour of television
silence which would be an hour
of warning on Tuesday evening,

Are you, personally, willing to
do .something to make sure that
deceit and dishonesty are ban
ished from the television screen
in your home?
I believe that something use
ful and dramatic can be done by
the public —and this, if it is to
have any effect, means you, not
somebody else.
I believe that something dra
matic and forceful can he done
by the millions of TV viewers 1o
bring home to the sponsors, to
the networks, to the producers, to
the writers, to the performers,
that we mean business, that we
aren't fooling, that unless this
awful, sordid, squalid mess of
rigged shows is totally cleaned
up or cleaned out, something pain
ful is going to happen.
Are we individual and unor
ganized viewers absolutely help
less to register a collective pro
test and a collective demand?
What can be done? This can
be done:
Why don't a few million view
ers-all who want to raise their
voice to say that it isn't going to
bo enough to pretty up the edges
of the TV screen—pick a date and
a prime time of adult program
ming and all at once observe an
hour of television silence?
Any date, any evening time
would do it, but viewers who
want to join in such an hour of
silence, an hour of warning,
would need to pick it far enough
ahead so that they could act
simultaneously. Therefore, why
not the following:
The date — Tuesday night,
Nov. 17.
The time —10 p.m. local stand
ard time.
The place—Your living room,
and at Ibis hour, Tuesday night,
Nov. 17, at 10 p.m., if you are
looking at television, you can
join with other viewers across
the country in simultaneously

clicking off the dial; and if you
are not looking at television,
you refrain from doing so be
tween 10 and 11 p.m.
Have no doubt that the net
works — and sponsors — would
watch — and measure — such a
demonstration very sensitively.
I don't even know what pro
grams are scheduled for Tuesday
evening, Nov. IT, but since 10
o'clock, E.S.T., would be 9 p.m.
in the Midwest, 8 p.m. in the
Rocky Mountain states, and 7 p.m.
on the Pacific coast, the hour of
silence and the hour of warning
would be aimed at no single pro
gram.
The latest testimony released
by the House Investigating
Committee shows that even the
little tots, the famous "Quiz
Kids" of some years ago, was
a rigged performance, and that
11-year-old Patty Duke was en
listed to engage in the fake

Nov. 17, at 10 p.m., if you are
looking at television, you can
join with other viewers across
the country in simultaneously

clicking off the dial; and if you
are not looking at television,
you refrain from doing so be
tween 10 and 11 p.m.
Have no doubt that the net
works — and sponsors — would
watch — and measure — such a
demonstration very sensitively.
I don't even know what pro
grams are scheduled for Tuesday
evening, Nov. IT, but since 10
o'clock, E.S.T., would be 9 p.m.
in the Midwest, 8 p.m. in the
Rocky Mountain states, and 7 p.m.
on the Pacific coast, the hour of
silence and the hour of warning
would be aimed at no single pro
gram.
The latest testimony released
by the House Investigating
Committee shows that even the
little tots, the famous "Quiz
Kids" of some years ago, was
a rigged performance, and that
11-year-old Patty Duke was en
listed to engage in the fake
question-and-answer on "The
$64,000 Challenge," and then
sternly cautioned that she must
not tell the truth about the
rigging!
No wonder the President of
the United States has said that
television "has done an awful
thing to the American people."
You can telephone your disgust
to your local station. You can
write a letter to your newspaper.
You can telegraph your Congress
man.
But the only way you can
register a monumental protest
which says: Clean house —or
else, is for several million TV
viewers to act together simul
taneously.
Wouldn't an hour of television
silence which would be an hour
of warning on Tuesday evening,
Nov. 17, at 10 p.m., local standard
time, do it ?
