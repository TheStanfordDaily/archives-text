# The 						Trouble with Tuesday
## 
### Barbara Hicks 
... Is that I have an H o'clock,
and it has a paper due . . . and
the Don Cossacks were reafly
good last night.
It was exciting to see such a
fine turnout Friday night at
Women's Clubhouse to hear stu
dents who visited Russia this
summer give their reports. The
basement room of the clubhouse
overflowed with audience, which
is somewhat remarkable, consid
ering it was Ui Friday night, (2»
the Arabs were expounding their
views at the I Center, (3) the
Moon was still being Besieged,
and (4) there was one of the main
football rallies of the year.
When the discussion paused for
refreshments, the .Russian flowed
faster than the tea from the
Samovars. Over in one corner
could he found Alexander Keren
sKy chatting in his native tongue
with some Russian matron. Ana
lole G. Ma/our, Russian history
teacher, was there, as well as the
Russian teachers in the Modern
European Languages department.
Hill Hutchinson, who worked
with the American Exhibition
in Moscow, commented that the
exhibition didn't really show
the Russians how Americans
live. For instance, there was a
supermarket, hut typical house
wives didn't do typical shop
ping.
Agreeing with Bill that we want
to show the Russians what makes
us tic, we must still realize that
an exhibition is an artificial situa
tion. Even transplanting an
American town to Russian would
not succeed entirely because it
would be difficult to go about
one's life causually, knowing
that there was an audience.
Bill also said the Exhibition
showed Russians what Ameri
cans liked to look at rather than
what the Russians were inter
ested in, such as machinery, just
as the Russian exhibition in
America showed Russian inter
ests.
But perhaps we can get some
insight from just knowing what
we are interested in through our
exhibit. At least it's better than
no exchange at all.

This is question day.
First, to the Corp Yard, Police
Department, Safety Department
and Insurance Department. Why
did it take more than one day to
replace the lights in the stairwells
leading to the Quad?
To AWS: Is it a Fundamental
Standard violation to wear Ber
mudas to the library in violation
of the "Minimum dress regula
tions" decree? If not, what is it
besides a violation of the mini
mum dress regulations?
To Women's Council: Even if
"going to sleep" was an over
worked excuse for being late,

which is really 1 hf- Fun Stan viola
tion: going lo sleep or deliberate
ly fabricating some other excuse
for being late in order to avoid
a Fun Stan violation? (Clarifica
tion from last week's Daily: it
now appears that just going lo
sleep in a car is not the violation;
it's that this is no excuse for be
ing late after 3 a.m.)
... Is that I have an H o'clock,
and it has a paper due . . . and
the Don Cossacks were reafly

mum dress regulations?
To Women's Council: Even if
"going to sleep" was an over
worked excuse for being late,

which is really 1 hf- Fun Stan viola
tion: going lo sleep or deliberate
ly fabricating some other excuse
for being late in order to avoid
a Fun Stan violation? (Clarifica
tion from last week's Daily: it
now appears that just going lo
sleep in a car is not the violation;
it's that this is no excuse for be
ing late after 3 a.m.)
... Is that I have an H o'clock,
and it has a paper due . . . and
the Don Cossacks were reafly
good last night.
It was exciting to see such a
fine turnout Friday night at
Women's Clubhouse to hear stu
dents who visited Russia this
summer give their reports. The
basement room of the clubhouse
overflowed with audience, which
is somewhat remarkable, consid
ering it was Ui Friday night, (2»
the Arabs were expounding their
views at the I Center, (3) the
Moon was still being Besieged,
and (4) there was one of the main
football rallies of the year.
When the discussion paused for
refreshments, the .Russian flowed
faster than the tea from the
Samovars. Over in one corner
could he found Alexander Keren
sKy chatting in his native tongue
with some Russian matron. Ana
lole G. Ma/our, Russian history
teacher, was there, as well as the
Russian teachers in the Modern
European Languages department.
Hill Hutchinson, who worked
with the American Exhibition
in Moscow, commented that the
exhibition didn't really show
the Russians how Americans
live. For instance, there was a
supermarket, hut typical house
wives didn't do typical shop
ping.
Agreeing with Bill that we want
to show the Russians what makes
us tic, we must still realize that
an exhibition is an artificial situa
tion. Even transplanting an
American town to Russian would
not succeed entirely because it
would be difficult to go about
one's life causually, knowing
that there was an audience.
Bill also said the Exhibition
showed Russians what Ameri
cans liked to look at rather than
what the Russians were inter
ested in, such as machinery, just
as the Russian exhibition in
America showed Russian inter
ests.
But perhaps we can get some
insight from just knowing what
we are interested in through our
exhibit. At least it's better than
no exchange at all.
