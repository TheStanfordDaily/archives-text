## PRESS BOX An Interested Spectator 
### 
One interested observer in ihe high a bow the Stan
ford field at last Saturday's fiasco was the former All-American
Stanford quarterback John Brodie. Apparently Brodie was there to
watch the latesl Card quarterbaeking star Dick Norman and he
broughl along a 49er teammate Monte Clark who did his playing
down for rough & tough USC. Norman had another one of his off
flays but Brodie, Clark and the rest of their 49er teapimates took no
heed to Stanford's actions as they flew down to the Coliseum Sunday

and whipped the LA limns for
the the first time down in Smog
land since 1953.
Yes, if any football fan wants
to watch some real football this
year he should "pledge his al
legiance" to the amazing San
Francisco 49ers. This year Win
ning football in the Bay Area is
played on Sundays as the 49ers
are on top of the Western Con
ference with a G-l record- that
lone defeat to Green Bay by only
one point on one of the oif days
for the San Franciscans. Yes . . .
if you want to see some good, ex
citing football, i.e., cheer for a
winner, go see the 49ers play on
Sundays but then try an get a
ticket. I understand that there
has been a lot of interesting
prices offered for one of these
prized ducats.
The pro season of the National
Football League entered its sec
ond half last Sunday and cer
tainly these same 49ers are the
talk of both divisions. Picked to

finish down near Ihe bottom by all the "exports" the amazing red and
silver team lias shown intense desire from the vets and has had some
great performances from rookies to compile their first place stand
ing. They are currently ihe highest scoring team in both halves of
the league scoring a total of IK9 points for seven games while al
lowing only 88 points scored against them second in ihe department
to the Eastern Conference Cleveland Browns.

Mickey and Defense Spark 49ers
What caused this fantastic change? Certainly Head Coach Red
Hickey a formev defensive end for the Bams has sparked this out
burst. Great performances by defensive hacks Dave Baker, from
Oklahoma, and Eddie Dove, from Colorado both rookies and ex
lllini star Abe Wood sen and Drake's Jerry Mertens have strengthened
'he supposed "weak spot" in the 49er defense. Also the old men up
front in the 49er defensive line Leo Xomcllini, who clinched the 21-
16 victory over the Bams last Sunday by blocking an extra point at
tempt, Clark, John Gonzaga, Karl Buhke, and linebackers Jerry
Tnhhs and Mat! Hazeltine have made it rough on both running and
passing teams.
Certainly the 49ers gave no evidence of their fine first half bid
for the NFL title in preseason action. They lost quite a few ballgames
one 1.1-48 loss to the over-rated Bams—but came back strong to
whip their Southland rivals 34-0 and last Sunday 24-16. The San Fran
ciscans have also double wins against Detroit and single victories
over the tough, George Halas-coached Chicago Bears, and the Phila
delphia Eagles.
Of course the great defensive efforts of the red and silver Bay
Areans has proved to place them on top of the heap, but also some
fine blocking and running from the offensive unit plus the able
team commanding from quarterback Y. A. Tittle has been the cause
of 49er success.
Running Came Improves
Great holes are opened up in the opposing lines by guards Bruce
Bosley and Ted Connolley and tackle Bol» SI. Clair for J. I). Smith
and Joe "the Jet" Perry to charge through. When the boys can't make
it in the center they sweep the ends with Rugh McElhenney—"the
King" and Perry or Lenny Lyles carrying the ball. Top downfield
blocking has given the defensive backs led by Woodsen and Mertens
a lot of room for running back intercepted passes, punts or kickoffs
Woodsen got a 105 yard kickoff return record breaker against the
Bams.
Then we might as well keep on passing out the laurels as cer
tainly Tittle has regained that old form passing to ends Clyde Con
ner, Bill Wilson and B. C. Owens and keeping the former Indian
grid great Brodie on the bench getting on the field now only to hold
the extra point and field goal attempts.
However, the season is but half over now and certainly with a
tough road trip in store for the 49ers they go back to play the
Baltimore Colts, in second place two games out, and the Bears
the season is far from over.
Hut if any Stanford—or Cal for that matter footba 11 fan wants to
"inflate his ego" or lift himself out of the frustrating dephs of watch
ing the Old Home Team, journey up to Kezar Stadium or plod down
in front of a TV set on Sunday and watch the exciting 49ers win a
close one or two pointer. Yes, the remaining five games will be tough
ones and the season is far from over, but a lot of Peninsula fans
may have a winner on their side of the Bay after all this year.

tainly these same 49ers are the
talk of both divisions. Picked to

finish down near Ihe bottom by all the "exports" the amazing red and
silver team lias shown intense desire from the vets and has had some
great performances from rookies to compile their first place stand
ing. They are currently ihe highest scoring team in both halves of
the league scoring a total of IK9 points for seven games while al
lowing only 88 points scored against them second in ihe department
to the Eastern Conference Cleveland Browns.

Mickey and Defense Spark 49ers
What caused this fantastic change? Certainly Head Coach Red
Hickey a formev defensive end for the Bams has sparked this out
burst. Great performances by defensive hacks Dave Baker, from
Oklahoma, and Eddie Dove, from Colorado both rookies and ex
lllini star Abe Wood sen and Drake's Jerry Mertens have strengthened
'he supposed "weak spot" in the 49er defense. Also the old men up
front in the 49er defensive line Leo Xomcllini, who clinched the 21-
16 victory over the Bams last Sunday by blocking an extra point at
tempt, Clark, John Gonzaga, Karl Buhke, and linebackers Jerry
Tnhhs and Mat! Hazeltine have made it rough on both running and
passing teams.
Certainly the 49ers gave no evidence of their fine first half bid
for the NFL title in preseason action. They lost quite a few ballgames
one 1.1-48 loss to the over-rated Bams—but came back strong to
whip their Southland rivals 34-0 and last Sunday 24-16. The San Fran
ciscans have also double wins against Detroit and single victories
over the tough, George Halas-coached Chicago Bears, and the Phila
delphia Eagles.
Of course the great defensive efforts of the red and silver Bay
Areans has proved to place them on top of the heap, but also some
fine blocking and running from the offensive unit plus the able
team commanding from quarterback Y. A. Tittle has been the cause
of 49er success.
Running Came Improves
Great holes are opened up in the opposing lines by guards Bruce
Bosley and Ted Connolley and tackle Bol» SI. Clair for J. I). Smith
and Joe "the Jet" Perry to charge through. When the boys can't make
it in the center they sweep the ends with Rugh McElhenney—"the
King" and Perry or Lenny Lyles carrying the ball. Top downfield
blocking has given the defensive backs led by Woodsen and Mertens
a lot of room for running back intercepted passes, punts or kickoffs
Woodsen got a 105 yard kickoff return record breaker against the
Bams.
Then we might as well keep on passing out the laurels as cer
tainly Tittle has regained that old form passing to ends Clyde Con
ner, Bill Wilson and B. C. Owens and keeping the former Indian
grid great Brodie on the bench getting on the field now only to hold
the extra point and field goal attempts.
However, the season is but half over now and certainly with a
tough road trip in store for the 49ers they go back to play the
Baltimore Colts, in second place two games out, and the Bears
the season is far from over.
Hut if any Stanford—or Cal for that matter footba 11 fan wants to
"inflate his ego" or lift himself out of the frustrating dephs of watch
ing the Old Home Team, journey up to Kezar Stadium or plod down
in front of a TV set on Sunday and watch the exciting 49ers win a
close one or two pointer. Yes, the remaining five games will be tough
ones and the season is far from over, but a lot of Peninsula fans
may have a winner on their side of the Bay after all this year.

One interested observer in ihe high a bow the Stan
ford field at last Saturday's fiasco was the former All-American
Stanford quarterback John Brodie. Apparently Brodie was there to
watch the latesl Card quarterbaeking star Dick Norman and he
broughl along a 49er teammate Monte Clark who did his playing
down for rough & tough USC. Norman had another one of his off
flays but Brodie, Clark and the rest of their 49er teapimates took no
heed to Stanford's actions as they flew down to the Coliseum Sunday

and whipped the LA limns for
the the first time down in Smog
land since 1953.
Yes, if any football fan wants
to watch some real football this
year he should "pledge his al
legiance" to the amazing San
Francisco 49ers. This year Win
ning football in the Bay Area is
played on Sundays as the 49ers
are on top of the Western Con
ference with a G-l record- that
lone defeat to Green Bay by only
one point on one of the oif days
for the San Franciscans. Yes . . .
if you want to see some good, ex
citing football, i.e., cheer for a
winner, go see the 49ers play on
Sundays but then try an get a
ticket. I understand that there
has been a lot of interesting
prices offered for one of these

whip their Southland rivals 34-0 and last Sunday 24-16. The San Fran
ciscans have also double wins against Detroit and single victories
over the tough, George Halas-coached Chicago Bears, and the Phila
delphia Eagles.
Of course the great defensive efforts of the red and silver Bay
Areans has proved to place them on top of the heap, but also some
fine blocking and running from the offensive unit plus the able
team commanding from quarterback Y. A. Tittle has been the cause
of 49er success.
Running Came Improves
Great holes are opened up in the opposing lines by guards Bruce
Bosley and Ted Connolley and tackle Bol» SI. Clair for J. I). Smith
and Joe "the Jet" Perry to charge through. When the boys can't make
it in the center they sweep the ends with Rugh McElhenney—"the
King" and Perry or Lenny Lyles carrying the ball. Top downfield
blocking has given the defensive backs led by Woodsen and Mertens
a lot of room for running back intercepted passes, punts or kickoffs
Woodsen got a 105 yard kickoff return record breaker against the
Bams.
Then we might as well keep on passing out the laurels as cer
tainly Tittle has regained that old form passing to ends Clyde Con
ner, Bill Wilson and B. C. Owens and keeping the former Indian
grid great Brodie on the bench getting on the field now only to hold
the extra point and field goal attempts.
However, the season is but half over now and certainly with a
tough road trip in store for the 49ers they go back to play the
Baltimore Colts, in second place two games out, and the Bears
the season is far from over.
Hut if any Stanford—or Cal for that matter footba 11 fan wants to
"inflate his ego" or lift himself out of the frustrating dephs of watch
ing the Old Home Team, journey up to Kezar Stadium or plod down
in front of a TV set on Sunday and watch the exciting 49ers win a
close one or two pointer. Yes, the remaining five games will be tough
ones and the season is far from over, but a lot of Peninsula fans
may have a winner on their side of the Bay after all this year.

One interested observer in ihe high a bow the Stan
ford field at last Saturday's fiasco was the former All-American
Stanford quarterback John Brodie. Apparently Brodie was there to
watch the latesl Card quarterbaeking star Dick Norman and he
broughl along a 49er teammate Monte Clark who did his playing
down for rough & tough USC. Norman had another one of his off
flays but Brodie, Clark and the rest of their 49er teapimates took no
heed to Stanford's actions as they flew down to the Coliseum Sunday

and whipped the LA limns for
the the first time down in Smog
land since 1953.
Yes, if any football fan wants
to watch some real football this
year he should "pledge his al
legiance" to the amazing San
Francisco 49ers. This year Win
ning football in the Bay Area is
played on Sundays as the 49ers
are on top of the Western Con
ference with a G-l record- that
lone defeat to Green Bay by only
one point on one of the oif days
for the San Franciscans. Yes . . .
if you want to see some good, ex
citing football, i.e., cheer for a
winner, go see the 49ers play on
Sundays but then try an get a
ticket. I understand that there
has been a lot of interesting
prices offered for one of these
prized ducats.
The pro season of the National
Football League entered its sec
ond half last Sunday and cer
tainly these same 49ers are the
talk of both divisions. Picked to

finish down near Ihe bottom by all the "exports" the amazing red and
silver team lias shown intense desire from the vets and has had some
great performances from rookies to compile their first place stand
ing. They are currently ihe highest scoring team in both halves of
the league scoring a total of IK9 points for seven games while al
lowing only 88 points scored against them second in ihe department
to the Eastern Conference Cleveland Browns.

Mickey and Defense Spark 49ers
What caused this fantastic change? Certainly Head Coach Red
Hickey a formev defensive end for the Bams has sparked this out
burst. Great performances by defensive hacks Dave Baker, from
Oklahoma, and Eddie Dove, from Colorado both rookies and ex
lllini star Abe Wood sen and Drake's Jerry Mertens have strengthened
'he supposed "weak spot" in the 49er defense. Also the old men up
front in the 49er defensive line Leo Xomcllini, who clinched the 21-
16 victory over the Bams last Sunday by blocking an extra point at
tempt, Clark, John Gonzaga, Karl Buhke, and linebackers Jerry
Tnhhs and Mat! Hazeltine have made it rough on both running and
passing teams.
Certainly the 49ers gave no evidence of their fine first half bid
for the NFL title in preseason action. They lost quite a few ballgames
