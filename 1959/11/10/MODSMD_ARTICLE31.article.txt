## Bruin Sunk; Win One for Poloists 
### 
Stanford's loss-weary water polo team finally scored Iheir first
win last Saturday in a spectacular fashion as they slaughtered UCLA
in a hard fought, but one-sided battle 19-8 before a sparse home
gathering. The Indian's other weekend battle resulted in a 26-14 loss
1o San Jose Stale Friday in the Spartan's pool. These two meets

leave Stanlord with a l b season
record.
Friday's contest was marked by
highly diversified scoring on
Stanford's part as the 14 goals
were divided among 10 Indians,
with Bob Owen getting the lion's
share with three. Andy Schwarz
and Jerry Bricca scored two each.
Roger Scaife led San Jose scor
ing with nine points.
Second Loss
The loss to San Jose was Stan
ford's second of the year to the
Spartans, the first being a 13-18
Indian loss.
Stanford's Bob Spence led off
with the first score of the day
against UCLA and from there on
the Indians maintained a two for
one pace with the Bruins. UCLA's
first score came on a pass from
Stanford guard Craig Smith to
teammate John Bates that went
awry and wandered into the Stan
ford goal.
One fact that stood out Satur
day in comparison with previous
games was the lack of fouls com
mitted by Stanford players. Only

two Stanford men. Andy Schwarz
and Bob Lorton, fouled out of the
game, in comparison to the three
Bruins that left on fouls.
It would appear that Coach
Haynie's strategy of putting his
strong arms in the forward posi
tions payed off because four for
wards scored all of the team's
points. Leading in this depart
ment was Bob Spenre with nine,
followed by George ttarrison with
six.
Ilatcs â€”Out standing Game
An outstanding game was
played by goalie John Bates, who
managed to anticipate most of
UCLA's shots and was in front of
half of them before they left the
would-be scorer's hand.
