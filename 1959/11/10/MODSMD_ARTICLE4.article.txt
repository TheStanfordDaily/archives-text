and a transfer from San Bernar
dino Valley College. A guest of
El Capitan Eating Club, Da.jani
is doing undergraduate work in
j political science this year.
After working in U.S. Embas-
I sies and libraries in the Middle
I East, Da.jani decided that by
! studying in this country he would
I increase his own understanding
lof people, and would be more
I qualified for his planned future
I in the diplomatic service of the
UAR.
He arrived in the States in 1957
with $30.00 in his pocket, and
I then worked and studied in New
York and San Bernardino before
coming to Stanford.
Da.jani is now acting as modera
tor for the lIR consular and cul
tural talks, and is very interested
in speaking to church and civic

Expressing his firm belief in
the value of foreign scholarships,

make the best ambassadors this
country will ever have, because
their tolerance is based on under

or indoctrination."
Money given here has a more
lasting value than other foreign
aid projects, he noted, "for rulers ;
come and go, but the people stay
forever."
