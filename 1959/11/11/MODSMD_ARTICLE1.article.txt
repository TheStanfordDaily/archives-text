## 'Villagers' Problems Are Ours' 
### Jerry Isenberg 
"Our purpose is to help the
natives of the underdeveloped
areas to help themselves," saicl
Dr. John L. Peters yesterday in
defining the purpose of World
Neighbors, Inc.
Peters, president of Worl d
Neighbors, told an informal
gathering at Bowman Alumni
House that his organization is at
tempting to provide the means
by which Asiatic peoples can
better prepare themselves to
"grapple with the harsh realities
of their existence."
Organized in 1952
World Neighbors was organ
ized in 1952 when a Methodist
congregation responded to a talk
in which Peters had discussed his
plan to lessen the likelihood of
war.
With limited resources, the
group began its work in the Phil
ippines and in south India edu
cating people in small villages
and rural districts in modern tech
niques of agriculture and in
dustry. It also concentrated on
reducing illiteracy and improving
sanitation.
Villagers are approached,
Peters said, with this attitude:
"We came because your problems
are related to ours. Let's join re
sources and see what we can
accomplish."
Self Respect
. "We never give a man a plow,"
he continued. "We feel it is im
portant for him to maintain his
self respect by buying into this
partnership."
World Neighbors has increased
the scope of its operations to
include Egypt and most recently
Ethiopia.
Peters summed up the work of
his group saying, "We assist
people with their problems â€”
whether that means killing rats
or teaching women to make
gloves."
