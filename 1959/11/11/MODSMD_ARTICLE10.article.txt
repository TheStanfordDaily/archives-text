World Impact
The movie industry must first
j remember that movies demon
strate the universality of popular
entertainment, he said. The stu
dios have story scouts stationed
in cities throughout the world to
search for material that will be
acceptable to people in all coun
tries.
To illustrate the impact that
American films have outside of
this country, Brown used the ex
ample that in Latin America,
American movies are the chief
I means of learning English. He
also mentioned the fact that
"Three Coins in a Fountain" in
creased tourism in Italy.
Precautions Needed
In selecting story material for
j films, the movie industry must
also take into account the various
censorship boards and organiza
tions in the U.S. Among others,
I there are religious, state and even
labor objections which have to be
coped with.
In addition to being careful not
to antagonize any of these groups,
the story must be presented with
out violating the author's inten
tions, if it has been taken from
a book. This is obviously not al
ways possible, Brown said.
Sec Familiar Works
"People who have seen or
heard of a play or book are cu
rious to see it as a movie," Brown
said in discussing the sources of
the stories finally used. Books
must also be able to be made into
dramas, for often a film producer
must convey, through action or
dialogue, ideas which the author
| has been able to explain at length.

Precautions Needed
In selecting story material for
j films, the movie industry must
also take into account the various
censorship boards and organiza
tions in the U.S. Among others,
I there are religious, state and even
labor objections which have to be
coped with.
In addition to being careful not
to antagonize any of these groups,
the story must be presented with
out violating the author's inten
tions, if it has been taken from
a book. This is obviously not al
ways possible, Brown said.
Sec Familiar Works
"People who have seen or
heard of a play or book are cu
rious to see it as a movie," Brown
said in discussing the sources of
the stories finally used. Books
must also be able to be made into
dramas, for often a film producer
must convey, through action or
dialogue, ideas which the author
| has been able to explain at length.


DAVID BROWN
The Hollywood Story
"Behind all the tinsel and glam
our there is a serious and dedi
cated Hollywood, far more inter-
I esting than that ordinarily shown
; to the public." r e v e a 1 e d last
night's Tuesday Evening Series
speaker, David Brown,
Brown, executive story editor
| for Twentieth Century-Fox Stu
• dios, went on to explain some of
! the things that go into selecting
| the material for a screenplay.
World Impact
The movie industry must first
j remember that movies demon
strate the universality of popular
entertainment, he said. The stu
dios have story scouts stationed
in cities throughout the world to
search for material that will be
acceptable to people in all coun
tries.
To illustrate the impact that
American films have outside of
this country, Brown used the ex
ample that in Latin America,
American movies are the chief
I means of learning English. He
also mentioned the fact that
"Three Coins in a Fountain" in
creased tourism in Italy.
