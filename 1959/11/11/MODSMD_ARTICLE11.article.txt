# Stanford Men Brave Antarctic
## 
### 
Three intrepid Stanford stu
dents are presently engaged in
field work in one of the world's
most inaccessible spots â€” Ant
arctica.
John Dearborn and Jack Litllc
page, graduate students, and
Stoner Haven, a senior, are the
adventurers. Dearborn spent the
isolated winter at the Naval Air
Facility, McMurdo Sound in Ross
Sea. The small base there had
only radio contact with the out
side world from March to Oc
tober. Over 100 scientists and
navy men wintered over at Mc-
Murdo.
Their project concerns the
study of marine life in Antarctic
waters. A wire mesh trap, a fine
net "tangle." baited hooks and
doth funnels arc used to capture
specimens.
These are lowered through two
holes in frozen Ross Sea. Each
day, the holes must be chopped
open and the traps checked.
Temperatures ;il the site average
around minus ten degrees, but
reached minus 50 degrees during
the winter.
The most often found speci
mens are starfish, isopods and
types of plankton. All are taken
to the biology laboratory here
for study. Funds for the Marine
Biological Program are from the
National Science Foundation.
Dearborn and Littlepagc will
return t<> the U.S. In March. Hav
en will remain for the seven
month winter period.
