# Polls Open Today For Final Voting
## 
### 
Final elections open today, with the only all-campus post to be decided being that of head yell leader.
There is agreement among the head yell leaders—both incumbent and prospective—about when the
new one would take charge of leading the yells. They disagree with the recently passed amendment
which states that the new head yell leader would assume office at the beginning of winter quarter—
part way through basketball season.
Asked for his comments on the issue, Bill Kartozian said, "I'd rather do it just till the end of foot-

nau season. 11 seems to oe a more
normal break in the year for a
yell leader to make the break as
the sports change, rather than as
the quarters change. I'd feel
rather lost in the pavilion where
people would feel a little more
restraint at throwing water bal
loons at me."
'Change With the Sport'
Taffy Symonds had this to say:
"I agree with Bill that it is a more
logical time to change—to change
with the sport. It also helps the
whole continuity of the new yell
leader to start with a new sport.
I think that if a new yell leader
is to take over at the beginning
of basketball season, he should
not have to be under the shadow
of the old yell leader. If elected,
I'd be willing to work out with Bill
an arrangement of this sort."
'Contact Legislature'
Phil Huyck commented: "All
I authorities willing, I'm amenable.
• If Kartozian feels that this is
j the right way, I'd go along. 1
| think that something should be
worked out with Legislature so
that a mutual understanding is
reached, and there is a common
interpretation of the amendment.
If elected, I would first contact
j Legislature and find out their
I feelings and reasoning behind
the amendment. I do feel that
the break with the change in
sports is a more natural one than
is the quarter break."
