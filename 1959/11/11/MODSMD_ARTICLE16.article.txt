# KHRUSHCHEV VISIT
## De Gaulle Ends Chance For Early Summit Meet 
### 
PARIS (/P) — President Charles de Gaulle yesterday exploded any
chance of the East-West summit conference before next April.
He announced that Soviet Premier Nikita Khruschecv will begin
his talks here March 15, and that these talks are a precondition for
the top-level East-West meeting.
The tall, dour French President also told a conference of 700

newsmen:
1. France will agree at once
to discard atomic weapons if the
United Nations succeeds in reach
ing an agreement to ban nuclear
arms. But there is no chance
France will renounce the right to
such weapons while other powers
go ahead perfecting the arms in
their nuclear arsenals. The pro
jected test of a French atomic
bomb in the Sahara Desert will
go ahead on schedule.
2. He is holding his offer of
many months ago for Algeria's
rebellious nationalist leaders to
come to Paris under safe-conduct
to discuss a crease-fire.
There seems little likelihood the
rebels will take him up, since he
added nothing new to his offer.
The rebels want political ques
tions, as well as a military cease
fire, included in any talks. The
French deny that the rebels are
sufficiently representative to dis
cuss political issues for all Al
geria. —
De Gaulle's announcement of a
March date for Khrushchev's
visit was confirmed in Moscow.
