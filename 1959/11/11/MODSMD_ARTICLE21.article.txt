Living up to its high standards
of polished productions and fine
acting, •the Actor's Workshop is
currently presenting John Os
borne's "Epitaph for George Dil
lon" at the Marines' Theater, Sut
ter and Mason streets in San
Francisco.
Set in the mid • 1950'5, the
three-act drama takes place in a
dingy house of a London sub
urb with a time span of a year,
from the day when the unsuc
cessful actor-playwright George
Dillon moves in with the Elliot
family, through autumn when
he develops tuberculosis and
winter when he returns perma
nently to the house.
Portraying "that mysterious, ri
diculous being called an artist,"
Tom Rosqui does an excellent job
as the actor "by profession" who
takes full advantage of the hospi
tality and money offered him. He
bitterly attacks the falseness and
shallowness of society, yet he is
the biggest phony of the lot, and
when finally one of his plays is
produced it is only after he has
re-written it to popular taste as
directed by the producer.
Playing Ruth Gray, Mrs. El
liot's sister, Winifred Mann does
an outstanding job as the one who
sees Dillon as he really is. She
shares his dislike for tawdry so
ciety, but, unlike Dillon, by facing
it and herself she opens up a
chance for escape.
Also notable in the cast are
Shirley -lac Wagner as Mrs. El
liot who finds Dillon and brings
him home, Elisabeth Keller as
the shallow teen-age, Josie, Dirk
Harvey playing the uncommu
nicative Mr. Elliot, and Kay Fry,
who plays Mr. Colwyn-Stuart,
the minister who believes there
is a "lamp" burning, or at least
flickering, in everyone.
Both direction and set design by
Vincent Porcaro are effective, and
although the idea of the play is
not new, it is well written and
well acted, producing a worth
while evening at' the theater.

of polished productions and fine
acting, •the Actor's Workshop is
currently presenting John Os
borne's "Epitaph for George Dil
lon" at the Marines' Theater, Sut
ter and Mason streets in San
Francisco.
Set in the mid • 1950'5, the
three-act drama takes place in a
dingy house of a London sub
urb with a time span of a year,
from the day when the unsuc
cessful actor-playwright George
Dillon moves in with the Elliot
family, through autumn when
he develops tuberculosis and
winter when he returns perma
nently to the house.
Portraying "that mysterious, ri
diculous being called an artist,"
Tom Rosqui does an excellent job
as the actor "by profession" who
takes full advantage of the hospi
tality and money offered him. He
bitterly attacks the falseness and
shallowness of society, yet he is
the biggest phony of the lot, and
when finally one of his plays is
produced it is only after he has
re-written it to popular taste as
directed by the producer.
Playing Ruth Gray, Mrs. El
liot's sister, Winifred Mann does
an outstanding job as the one who
sees Dillon as he really is. She
shares his dislike for tawdry so
ciety, but, unlike Dillon, by facing
it and herself she opens up a
chance for escape.
Also notable in the cast are
Shirley -lac Wagner as Mrs. El
liot who finds Dillon and brings
him home, Elisabeth Keller as
the shallow teen-age, Josie, Dirk
Harvey playing the uncommu

the minister who believes there
is a "lamp" burning, or at least
flickering, in everyone.

well acted, producing a worth
while evening at' the theater.
