The Triple
Editor, The Daily:
As an American and a Stanford
student, I feel that I must take
issue with Mr. Moranitz' state
ment of the "triple of collegiate
success" diploma, marriage to
the girl he (the student) has been
pinned to for the last three years,
and a $10,000 job (per year, I as
sume) with IBM.
For your information, Mr. Mo
ranitz. we are more European
over here than you realize—for
eign cars, lederhosen, and each
coed has had "my trip to Europe"
(and presumably is now ready to
settle down to life in Middletown,
U.S.A.).
But aside from our "European
ization," I must set Mr. Moranitz
straight on the matter of the col
lege student's goals.
We all desire: (1) to marry the
girl next door (whom, admittedly,
we have been pinned to, but who
attends college in another part of
the country); (2) granted, we do
want a diploma, but also in the
way of academic paraphernalia,
we desire preparation in one eso
teric language and a basic course
in existentialism, for the purpose
of cocktail party ware-demonstra
tion; and (3> wo do not desire
$10,000 jobs at IBM, but would
rather have our own businesses,
selling used cars or the like.
In another part of The Daily,
for Mr. Moranitz' information,
Madame Pandit's recent talk was
reported, in which she described
the three goals of Indian democ
racy: food, shelter and opportu
nity.
We have already mastered the

goal of food in this country, but it j
is possible to state the goal of the
American college student in rela
tion to food the average Ameri
can is most concerned with ensur
ing that he eats with the right
people.

This year we are predicting our j
own "Big Game Headline," (Apol
ogies to Dick Zimmerman and
Ram's Head for the overlap.)
"KIDS REVOLT- STANFORD
UNDER KID RULE, CENTER '
OF MASSED REBELLION."
COPS STYMIED: 'HOW CAN
YOU STOP 10,000 PINT-SIZED,
YELPING, SCREAMING. ROMP
ING, BITING DAMN KIDS?' "
We say stop this headline be
fore it becomes reality; here is
our solution.
All kids, brats, punks, monsters, j
etc., should be given a ticket to i
this week's game in the Stanford ;
Stadium. Of course there is no I
game, but once the kids are in the i
gates could be locked and a bomb |
could easily exterminate them all. |
The Stadium could then be
flooded, flushed, drained and dried
in time for the Big Game which
could be played and enjoyed in
comfort—no kids.

ization," I must set Mr. Moranitz
straight on the matter of the col
lege student's goals.
We all desire: (1) to marry the
girl next door (whom, admittedly,
we have been pinned to, but who
attends college in another part of
the country); (2) granted, we do
want a diploma, but also in the
way of academic paraphernalia,
we desire preparation in one eso
teric language and a basic course
in existentialism, for the purpose
of cocktail party ware-demonstra
tion; and (3> wo do not desire
$10,000 jobs at IBM, but would
rather have our own businesses,
selling used cars or the like.
In another part of The Daily,
for Mr. Moranitz' information,
Madame Pandit's recent talk was
reported, in which she described
the three goals of Indian democ
racy: food, shelter and opportu
nity.
We have already mastered the

goal of food in this country, but it j
is possible to state the goal of the
American college student in rela
tion to food the average Ameri
can is most concerned with ensur
ing that he eats with the right
people.

We say stop this headline be

our solution.
All kids, brats, punks, monsters, j

this week's game in the Stanford ;
Stadium. Of course there is no I
game, but once the kids are in the i
gates could be locked and a bomb |
could easily exterminate them all. |
The Stadium could then be
flooded, flushed, drained and dried
in time for the Big Game which
could be played and enjoyed in
comfort—no kids.
