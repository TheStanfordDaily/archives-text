### Rich Sundeen ASSU President 
During the past week the three
student members of Ihe Stanford
Union Committee — Debbie Dex
ter, Bob Best, and myself
traveled with Chester Berry,
Stanford Union director, to the
regional conference of the As
sociation of College Unions in
Moscow, Idaho.
Over 200 students and union
staff members representing
nearly 40 college unions from
.seven western states, including
Hawaii, met.
The greatest value of this con
ference resulted from the oppor
tunity to meet and talk with rep
resentatives from other unions.
Many ideas could be discussed
and shared in order to aid each
school build a strong union pro
gram.
One of the deepest impres
sions we brought back was the
need for a balanced union pro
gram.
By this, I mean the need for a
check against developing a gigan
tic "play palace," offering only
social or recreational facilities.
Of course, I also realize that
we do not want to create a library
out of our union.
My point is that we must main
tain a program and building that
will augment and enhance the
entire social, cultural, recrea
tional, and intellectual programs
for our campus.
Another purpose of our trip
was to visit as many other un
ions along our way as possible.
This enabled us to view and
study first hand the organiza
tional and physical structures
of various unions.

Included in our tour of unions,
we visited ihe University of Ore
gon, Oregon State College, Port
land State College, Whitman Col
lege, University of Idaho, and
Washington Slate University.
Peculiar or unique situations
confront each of these schools
and their unions. Conditions
such as location of the institu
tion, needs of the campus com
munity, services already ade
quately available, and finan
cial resources determine, to
various degrees, what each uni
versity or college union will be
like.
Keeping in mind those condi
tions peculiar to Stanford, we
woe able to drew specific ideas
from each of the unions we vis
ited and apply them to what
should be included in Stanford's
new union.
For example, several of the
unions had large short-order or
snack-eating areas that also serve
as central congregating points for
students during coffee breaks,
after studying, or dates.
This, it would seem, would
be quite high on our priority
list for what is to be included
within our union. On the other
hand, one of the schools did not
have adequate hotel facilities in
its vicinity and, thus, it devotes
one entire floor of its union to
hotel accommodations for cam
pus visitors.
Obviously, with Stanford's loca
tion, such a large rooming area
would not be practical, even if it
could be financially afforded.
As well as drawing ideas for
use in our union we were in such
a position to look critically at
the other unions. We learned
from other's mistakes. Wasted
space, over-loaded programs, and
inefficient food operations (con
gested lines, cold food, and slow
service) were among the various
faults we noted.
The student commissions work
ing on the activities, services, and
food services should be able to
make their recommendations by
ihe first week of December. Thus,
according to Berry, we ought to
have ihe architect's preliminary
drawings completed by January.

and their unions. Conditions
such as location of the institu
tion, needs of the campus com
munity, services already ade
quately available, and finan
cial resources determine, to
various degrees, what each uni
versity or college union will be
like.
Keeping in mind those condi
tions peculiar to Stanford, we
woe able to drew specific ideas
from each of the unions we vis
ited and apply them to what
should be included in Stanford's
new union.
For example, several of the
unions had large short-order or
snack-eating areas that also serve
as central congregating points for
students during coffee breaks,
after studying, or dates.
This, it would seem, would
be quite high on our priority
list for what is to be included
within our union. On the other
hand, one of the schools did not
have adequate hotel facilities in
its vicinity and, thus, it devotes
one entire floor of its union to
hotel accommodations for cam
pus visitors.
Obviously, with Stanford's loca
tion, such a large rooming area
would not be practical, even if it
could be financially afforded.
As well as drawing ideas for
use in our union we were in such
a position to look critically at
the other unions. We learned
from other's mistakes. Wasted
space, over-loaded programs, and
inefficient food operations (con
gested lines, cold food, and slow
service) were among the various
faults we noted.
The student commissions work
ing on the activities, services, and
food services should be able to
make their recommendations by
ihe first week of December. Thus,
according to Berry, we ought to
have ihe architect's preliminary
drawings completed by January.
During the past week the three
student members of Ihe Stanford
Union Committee — Debbie Dex
ter, Bob Best, and myself
traveled with Chester Berry,
Stanford Union director, to the
regional conference of the As
sociation of College Unions in
Moscow, Idaho.
Over 200 students and union
staff members representing
nearly 40 college unions from
.seven western states, including
Hawaii, met.
The greatest value of this con
ference resulted from the oppor
tunity to meet and talk with rep
resentatives from other unions.
Many ideas could be discussed
and shared in order to aid each
school build a strong union pro
gram.
One of the deepest impres
sions we brought back was the
need for a balanced union pro
gram.
By this, I mean the need for a
check against developing a gigan
tic "play palace," offering only
social or recreational facilities.
Of course, I also realize that
we do not want to create a library
out of our union.
My point is that we must main
tain a program and building that
will augment and enhance the
entire social, cultural, recrea
tional, and intellectual programs
for our campus.
Another purpose of our trip
was to visit as many other un
ions along our way as possible.
This enabled us to view and
study first hand the organiza
tional and physical structures
of various unions.

Included in our tour of unions,
we visited ihe University of Ore
gon, Oregon State College, Port
land State College, Whitman Col
lege, University of Idaho, and
Washington Slate University.
Peculiar or unique situations
confront each of these schools
and their unions. Conditions
such as location of the institu
tion, needs of the campus com
