## Look at the Competition

When Stanford's track team loses to Southern California, Oregon,
Occidental and San Jose State, critics say "what a poor season that
was." But name mo one school outside of Kansas who is going lo
come close to beating any of those teams in a dual meet.
Coach I'ayton Jordon ranked last year's Indian track squad sixth
in the nation dual meet-wise, despite the fact that it scored only
one major victory over 18-point favorite 1(1,A. And it is with an
aura of confidence and satisfaction that Jordan predicts next track
sters to be even hotter.
"Few people even realize that Stanford had I\vo track All-Ameri
cans last year—Ernie Culiffe and John Kelly, Jordan says. "If a
single school had two football All-Aniericans it would be all over

t li«* papers."
The fine showing this fall of
the Tribe cross-country team
points up the strength that Stan
lard is going to have next spring
in the middle and long distances.
"We're finally starting to run like
a team," Jordan says. "A kid in
t rack is out there alone —hut they
still count up the points by
teams." Last Saturday, Stanford
outdistanced Cal, San Jose and
UCLA in a cross-country meet,
although Huh Mon/.ingo's fifit h
place finish was the highest in
dividual showing for the Cards.
It has been Ihe fine supple
mentary running of Rrnie Cun
liffe, Bert i I Ltindh and John
North way that has been racking
up the team victories for the
Tribe.
( unliffe, with the ultimate in
determination is a coach's run-

ner and his dedicated attitude, along with that of such stars as
Kelly, Dan Moore and Don Bell is being reflected in the entire
Card team this year. Norm Lloyd, the great English runner who
smashed school records two years ago but was an extremely dis
appointing preformer last year "is doing his best running since he's
l>een here," reports Jordan.
Lundli, much more settled down now after a year in this country,
can be expected to almost equal his European hosts next spring.
Bertil had a 4:01 clocking in the mile and 1:47 in the 880 in Europe
never really neared those marks last year.
So Stanford's 880, mile and two mile strength could bo the
greatest in collegiate history. It was already pretty tough last year.
