# Greatest-Ever Fleet?
## 
### 
Stack this 880 fleet against any you can find: Cunliffe, Lloyd,
Lundh and Dirk Lassen (all under 1:52), plus co-frosh record holders
Jeff Beaubier and Rick Klier (1:54.5). In the mile â€” Cunliffe, Lloyd,
Lundh, Monzingo and Keith Wallace.
Wallace, a brilliant second in the Pacific Coast conference cross
country meet last year, has been plagued by minor injuries since
last spring and has yet to hit the peak so many expected of him.
The Indians will be loaded in a few other events, such as the
broad jump. Five 24-footers will be around: Kelly, Dan Moore,
Brooks Townsend, Chuck Bartli, and Norweigan find Andus Offen
berg. Moore was the nation's freshman champion last year, and
along with the clutch-jumping Kelly is a definite threat to break the
25-foot barrier before he is through. In addition, the Salem, Ore.,
sophomore has shaved his high hurdle time to 14.6, a good prospect
for the future.
Stanford may beat its all-time in the discus. Big Don Bell, the
country's No. 2 frosh discus ace last year, is backed by veterans
Archie Schmitt and Harlan Limmer.
Why all the noise about a sport still months away? Because it
looks as if Stanford is finally coming around under Jordan with the
attitude and desire to be world-beaters.
