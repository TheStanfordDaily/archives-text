# Greatest-Ever Fleet?
## 
### 
Stack this 880 fleet against any you can find: Cunliffe, Lloyd,
Lundh and Dirk Lassen (all under 1:52), plus 00-frosh record holders
Jeff Beau bier and Hick Klier (1:54.5). In the mile Cunliffe, Lloyd,
Lundli, Monzingo and Keith Wallace.
Wallace, a brilliant second in the Pacific Coast conference cross
country meet last year, has been plagued by minor injuries since
last spring and has yet to hit the peak so many expected of him.
The Indians will be loaded in a few other events, such as the
broad jump. Five 24-footers will bo around: Kelly, Dan Moore,
Brooks Townsend, Chuck Bartli, and Norweigan find Andus Offen
berg. Moore was the nation's freshman champion last year, and
along with the clutch-jumping Kelly is a definite threat to break the
25-foot barrier before ho is through. In addition, the Salem, Ore.,
sophomore has shaved his high hurdle time to 14.6, a good prospect
for the future.
Stanford may boat its all-time in the discus. Rig Don Bell, the
country's No. 2 frosh discus ace last year, is backed by veterans
Archie Schmitt and Harlan Limmcr.
Why all the noise about a sport still months away? Because it
looks as if Stanford is finally coming around under Jordan with the
attitude and desire to be world-beaters.
