# What a Home Schedule

Next spring's Stanford track fare for Bay Aryans should be the
greatest ever.
The final Olympic trials, of course, will he held at Stanford
stadium in late June. Earlier in the month, the stadium will host
the California state high school moot.
But this isn's enough. Jordan is now awaiting acceptance from
the powerful Kansas team to participate in a triangular with Stanford
and San Jose State. Kansas and San Jose were one-two finishers in
last year's NCAA meet. Thus plus dual meets with UCLA, Californ
ia, Olympic Club, Santa Clara Youth Village (paced by a sprinter
named Hay Norton), and San Jose.
As for frosh track stars, Stanford came up with a good nucleus
this year with the usual absences due to schools with a little more
money.
Ken Enianuels, a big lad who won the Washington 440 and 100-
yard dash title (48.5 in the quarter) could be a great one before he's
through. Other prize frosh are football playing shot-putter Charles
Buehler (6-s'u, 245) who put the high school shot 59 feet; Oakland
broad jumper-hop step star Sheridan Downey; Wichita, Kan., half
miler Boh Holngerson who was a member of the 1059 prep All -
American two-mile relay and cross-country teams (his high school
teammate, Archie San Ramoni Jr., ran a 4:09.5 mile); I'hil While,
Carmel pole vaulter. and Larry Stalling, Wliittier javelin thrower.
I may be out of season -but things otherwise aren't going so
good -and the track future looks bright. (You might say: if you
cant' say anything good about something, don't say it. So to speak.)
