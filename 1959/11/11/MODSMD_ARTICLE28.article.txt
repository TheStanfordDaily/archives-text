# Indians Ready for OSC
## Daily Sports 
### 
If the Stanford Indians didn't 1
see enough of the single-wing of- j
fense last week against UCLA,
they will have another chance to
put up with the same thing again
from Tommy Prothro's Oregon!
State Beavers this weekend in j
Corvallis.
The Beavers do not have the
same offensive potential that the
Bruins displayed in beating the
Indians 55-13, but they will have j
a better defense according to Card
mentor Jack Curtice.
The season's statistics will bear
Curtice out on this point. The
only team to score more than 20
points against the Beavers was
powerful USC, which ran up 27
markers against the Oregon Stat
ers.
The Beavers have won only two
games in the 1959 season. They
rolled over helpless Idaho, 66-18,
in their greatest show of often
sive power. The other win was a
24-20 victory over the hapless Cal
ifornia Bears.
Last week the Beavers showed
a strong defense against the
Washington Huskies, but their
mistakes cost them the win. A
fumble on the Washington 35 end
ed a drive that could have brought
the Corvallis crew victory.
Other than Ihe great offensive
show over Idaho, the Beavers
have no) shown much on offense
all season. If you leave out the
66 in (he Idaho game, the Oregon
Staters have scored only 63 points
in seven other contests.
The Beavers are nol the strong

team that beat the Cards 24-16!
last year. Oregon State lost 15
lettermen to graduation, one be- j
ing All - American tackle Ted
Bates. Bates was the mainstay of
the line that handled the Cards)
last year.
Along with Bates went All-
Coast selections Nub Beamor, j
pile - driving fullback, and Jim!

Brack ins, 258-pound guard. The
loss of those men has hurt the
powerful Beavers. But Tommy
Prothro's men do have one top
lineman on the squad in Ed Kao
helaulii, the 6 3. 220-pounder who
i is the ironman of the Beaver line.
Prothro will be looking for his
: tenth win a row over Bay Area
schools. He has never been boat
en by either' the Indians or Cal in
his four years at Oregon Stpte.
! The Beavers have already taken
| the measure of Cal and will be
, looking to keep Prothro's record
intact.
