## 
### Vic Affolter 
Freshman basketball fans can look forward to an exciting brand
of play this season as coach Rill Turner intends to use plenty of
speed and sharp shooting to off-set his team's lack of size. The
Stanford freshmen, who have been working out in the gym since
mid October, have less than three weeks to prepare for their season

opener with the University of|
San Francisco frosh on the first j
December.
The frosh squad will have to
concede a decided height advant
age to their opponents this sea
son as only two players measure
over 6-3. This will give the op
position a definite advantage in
rebounding and ball control.
Coach Turner hopes the speed
and shooting accuracy his team
has exhibited in practice will
counter their height disadvantage.
A number of players on this
year's freshmen team compiled
commendable records in high
school competition. Bob Summers,
