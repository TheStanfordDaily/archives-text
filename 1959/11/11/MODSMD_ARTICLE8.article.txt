# Berlin Student Gives Opinion
## 
### Friedrich Hiiske 
The Daily has given me this
opportunity to introduce myself
to my fellow Stanford students.
I am an ASSU Scholar sponsored
by the exchange pr o g r a m be
tween Stanford's lIR and the
"Freie Universitat Berlin." I am
studying economics and will re
ceive my degree from Berlin when
I return.
As the initial difficulties in
adapting to your more directed
way of study are now over, I am
enjoying this experience very
much.
The relationship between our
two universities is very good.
The fact that your exchange stu
dents join the "Stanford Komitte"
in Berlin, and that we join the
Berlin Affiliation Committee at
Stanford, brings about a spirited
exchange of ideas.
Stan 112 or d University is very
highly esteemed in Berlin and the
Free University is proud of her
position as the German univer
sity represented at Stanford.
Stanford students going to Ber
lin to see the divided capital of a
divided country would be heartily
welcomed by members of the
"Stanford Komitee" there.
