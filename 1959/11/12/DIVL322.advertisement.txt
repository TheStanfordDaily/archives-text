Teen-age Marriages
Where are
they sleeping
tonight?
They just got married this
morning. Where will then sleep
tonight? It hadn't crossed their
minds. What will then do for
money? They hadn't thought
of it. Are they in lore? Oh yes.
Violently. Passionately.
Whut's in their future? Lone
liness and tragedy. Who is to
blame? YOU! No social prob
lem in America today is more
frightening than the rapid
rise in teen marriages. No
family is exempt from the
bitter consequences. The cur
rent issue of McCall's tells
why teen-agers marry, why
their marriages fail, how to
avoid premature marriages or
save them when they become
a reality. Now, today, read
the incredible, documented
facts in November McCall's.
