# Federal Steel Panel Recalled
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — President Eisenhower, trying to head
off renewal of the crippling steel strike this winter, recalled his
fact finders yesterday and ordered them to help find a peace
formula.
White House press secretary James C. Hagerty said Eisenhower

"trusts that both sides will recog
nize their responsibilities to the
United States and will continue
negotiations and reach a settle
ment as soon as possible."
The three-man fact-finding
panel was instructed to cooperate
with the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service. It appeared
the groups would get going in
about two weeks.
Mills Busy Again
The President took the step as
steel mills gradually returned to
normal under an 80-day truce or
dered by the federal courts.
More than half of the 500,000
steelworkers were back at work
under a Taft-Hartley law injunc
tion. The rest were expected on
the job by the weekend.
In related developments:
• Secretary of Labor James P.
Mitchell said all America expects
the United Steelworkers Union
and the steel producers to settle
their differences and sign a con
tract without a renewed strike in
January. Until stopped by court
order last Saturday, the strike
had lasted 11(5 days.
Support Steelworkers
• AFL-CIO President George
Meany urged his federation's 13 I L*
million members to keep up con
tributions to support the Stecl
! workers Union "until the hour the
strike is settled."
• The union's 40-man Executive
Board and its 171-member Wage
Policy Committee prepared to
meet today in New York. Union
President David J. McDonald, in
calling the meetings, said Mon
day the purpose was to give a
situation report.
GM Stalled
Meanwhile, General Motors,
which has facilities to build al
most 2000 cars per hour, stopped
auto production yesterday because
it hasn't enough finished steel to
build even one complete car.
Normally at this time of year
GM's five carmaking divisions
would be turning out upward of
80,000 units a week.
Assembly of Chevrolet Corvette
sports cars stopped at St. Louis
during the day. The final line
scheduled to close was at Willow
Run, just outside Detroit—home
plant of tlie new little Chevrolet
Corvair.
Lengthy Shutdown
Most GM lines have been down
for 10 days and production was
curtailed even before then by
parts shortages. Total GM lay
offs run about 220,000 hourly em
ployes from a normal work force
of 120,000.
The shutdown will last until
enough steel can bo obtained, and
parts processed, to fill supply
lines at the assembly plants. GM
has declined to estimate how long
this might be. Industry sources
expect the shutdown to last about
four weeks.
