# The
						Scratch Sheet
## 
### 
A PROPOSAL to institutionalize the Scratch Sheet is scheduled to
go before Legislature for approval tonight. If passed, the Scratch
Sheet would asMime a position similar to that of other campus
publications.
We approve of the idea of a Scratch Sheet and urge passage
of litis institutionalizing measure.
Several Scratch Sheets have been published during the past
two vears, and current samples of student opinion indicate inter
est in more Scratch Sheets.
If, then, interest exists in a Scratch Sheet, we believe it should
be provided with a permanent organizational basis.
Previous Scratch Sheets have bad the disadvantage of no con
tinuity. Kstablislunent of a permanent Scratch Sheet would al
low future editors to first gain experience in the ranks before
taking over the publication. On a one-time-only basis, the Scratch
Sheet cannot cover courses as completely because it cannot gather
opinion from more than the previous quarter.
Previous Scratch Sheets have also had the nature of a "closed
corporation." In a permanent set-up, more students would be
able to contribute their time and elVort.
The hi ggest argument against institutionalization is fear that
there will be insufficient staff and that poor editors may come
along.
\\ e cannot guarantee against either of these events, lint we
think the only way the Scratch Sheet can at least have the oppor
tunitv to grow into a worthwhile regular publication instead of a
semi-fl\-by-night, irregular organization, is for it to be housed
within a structure of permanent organization.
If, then, you favor a Scratch Sheet at all, we think you should
favor a permanent Scratch Sheet.
