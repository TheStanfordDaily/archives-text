No American—unless it be John
Foster Dulles—has earned such
venomous criticism and been the
target of such ferocious attack
by the Soviet Communists as
Walter Reuther.
This is not new. It has l>een
going on for some time, al
though the latest outburst
against the American trade un
ion leader by "Trud," Moscow's
"trade union" newspaper, seems
particularly virulent.
Why this extreme, unrelenting
hostility to Mr. Reuther, a hos
tility far more concentrated and
in excess of anything Mr. Miko
yan or Premier Khrushchev or
any of the other Communists
have ever directed at any U.S.
business leader? Why this con
stant indictment of him as an
"enemy of tlie workers"?
Certainly those who know him
best, as vice president of the A.F.
of L.-C.1.0. and as head of the
United Automobile Workers —
whether they like him or dislike
him—know that Walter Reuther
is not, as tiie Communists charge,
a "lackey of the monopolists." lie
is not even a lackey of the non
monopolists.
There must be some reason
for this unending Communist
abuse of this American politi
cal-labor leader whom some
U.S. politicians vehemently crit
icize for exactly the opposite
reasons. It could be because
Mr. Reuther lias proved him
self such a vigorous anti-Com
munist.
It could be because he, like
A.F. of L. President George
Meany, effectively led the cru
sade to free the American labor
movement from Communist in
filtration. It could be because he,
more pointedly and penetratingly
than anyone else, talked back to
Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Miko
van when they were in the United
States.
We can be sure that, the cool
and calculating Soviet Commu
nists do not select their principal
enemies on any whimsical or per
sonal basis. They hated and
sought to destroy Kerensky be
cause he stood for democratic
represent ative government.
They hated and sought to de
stroy Tit a because be stood —
and stands —for a political con
cept which, if it were embraced
by the Communist leaders in
other countries, would make it

impossible for the Soviets to
use Communism as an instru
ment of Soviet imperialism.
Tito holds that there should be
equality among the Communist
parties and sovereignty among
the Communist countries. This is
a doctrine which the Kremlin can
not abide if there is to be one
leader of the Communist bloc and
that leader the Soviet Union.
But Moscow seems to find Mr.
Reuther as distasteful as Keren
sky and Tito, though for differ
ent reasons. I doubt if the rea
sons relate only or even prima
rily to his role as an anti-Commu
nist American labor leader.
I suspect that Moscow sees
Mr. Keutlier as a massive sym
bol of a political and social
philosophy which they want to
weaken and undermine at ev
ery opportunity among their
own people as well as else
where.
That philosophy is that our in
dustrial, competitive - enterprise
society is capable of continuous
reform and adaptation by peace
ful, democratic, un-revolutionary
change. That philosophy is that
Western capitalism is dynamic
and reformist, able to retain both
freedom and enterprise while in
creasingly discharging its social
responsibilities to all the people.
Communism rests on the propo
sition that the government of the
nation and the government of the
masses must be held tightly in
the hands of the few, in the hands
of the "elite." in the hands of the
party hierarchy.
Mr. Reuther knows that such
a philosophy means the de
struction of representative gov
ernment and the destruction of
free labor unions—as both were
extinguished the day Lenin and
his followers drove the Keren
sky government from office by
force in 1917.
As we and the whole free world
face the formidable productive
competition with regimented
Communism in Russia, it is well
to bear in mind that the compari
son and the choice which Mr. K.
is inviting the world to make is
not between which society can
produce more but between pro
ductivity in a totally regimented
nation and productivity within a
framework of freedom and repre
sentative government based on
the consent of the governed.
