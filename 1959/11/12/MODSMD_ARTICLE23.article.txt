# Student Ideas Sought For Tresidder Union
## 
### Sherry Welch 
"Building Tresidder Union is
going to he a partnership propo
sition students and staff work
ing together," said Director
Chester A. Berry when describ
ing his plans for the building of
the $2 million Tresidder Memo
rial Union.
Berry, who is also president of
the Association of College
Unions, is in charge of co
ordinating all phases of operation
in the construction of ihe new
Stanford union. Immediately upon
his arrival at Stanford he out
lined an industrious 18 point
plan for tho building of Tresidder.
Goal Two Vears
The first step is a statement of
the definition of a union; the sec
ond calls for a statement concern
ing authority for the construction.
The necessary steps continue to
the dedication, which Berry has
ambitiously set for two years
from now.
Berry feels that there has been
a delay in building a new student
union here because "Stanford
doesn't know what a student un
ion is." Thus his third step, which
he is effecting now, is the educa
tion of students and the deter
mination of student opinion.
Student Opinions
"If we don't make it the kind
of place students want to use, we
are defeating our own purpose,"
said Berry, stressing the import
ance of student participation in
the organizing of the plans. "We
could build a fair union without
consulting anyone," continued
Berry, "but the more opinions,
the better it will turn out."
Berry is linked with the stu
dents through the ASSI.J ad hoc
Committee on Tresidder Memo
rial. Eventually this committee
will evolve into the Union Board
in charge of Ihe equipment, poli
cy and staff of the union.
Three Commissions
The committee has three main
commissions â€” Activities, Food
Services and Other Services
which are in turn divided into
subcommissions.
The commissions are open to
all students interested in helping
plan the union. The initial recom
mendations will be made to the
Union Committee once the com
missions have obtained campus
opinion concerning these possi
ble facilities.
Varied Activities
Already the commissions have
compiled a list of over 200 possi
ble activities and services which
the union might provide. These
range from book reading to exam
time cartoon shows, to a free
speech podium, to chess, billards,

shuffleboard, bowling, all types of
dances, circulating art libraries,
jewelry making, puppetry, pho
tography darkrooms, jam ses
sions, record listening, barber
shops, a bank, kitchenettes, and
numerous food services.
The original list was taken
from a doctoral thesis survey of
college unions throughout the
country. Obvious changes and
additions have been made so that
the list will be suitable for Stan
ford.
Berry is now having meals and
holding informal discussions at
as many different living groups
as possible, trying to acquaint
the students with their part in
this project.
Preliminary Work
Nov. 24 the ad hoc committee
will meet with the Union Commit
tee and go over and synthesize the
ideas for the union, preparing a
preliminary summary on Dec. 4.
The first week in December

] Ihe commiltee is sponsoring a
| movie of the University of Wis
consin's Union, one of the out
standing in the country, and
hopes to show it as many times
as possible.
The architects will then he con
sulted, uses will be found for ex
isting union buildings, the budget
will be planned, and the prelimi
nary drawings made.
Ground-Breaking
With these steps completed,
final approval of the plans will
be made, bids prepared, contracts
made, and step 16, the ground
breaking, will be effected. Finally
the staff will be organized and
as step 18, the new union will be
dedicated.
"If I have my way the students
will be in the middle of the thing
right through step 18," said
Berry. "We have no preconceived
ideas. It's up to the students. We
can change things as long as
I there are lines on paper."
