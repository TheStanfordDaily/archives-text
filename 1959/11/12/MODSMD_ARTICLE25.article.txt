## ONE OPINION 
### 
About this time in every quar
ter 1 can't get away from the
thought: "Where has all the time
gone?" and its natural corollary:
"Where's the needed time going
to come from?"
This is normally the time. 1
think, when people in a hole be
gin long eulogies to other people
who si art early, manage to do a
little every day, and never seem
to get behind anywhere.
There definitely is a system
available to lose mid-quarter
blues. It's just that it involves
more time than I'm willing to
spend. Si m p 1 y worded, it is:
STUDY.
It all begins back about two or
three days before classes. You
come back to campus early, buy
your books, get a course reading
list, take 48 hours out of your
busy social lives, and get about
two weeks ahead.
Then, in the flays that follow,
you read a chapter a day in ev
ery course.
Of course, this plan is designed
for those who know they won't
keep up the schedule. Thus,
while such a plan would actually
put you ahead of yourself in any
course, the days in which you
have kissed off will average out
so that you are where you should
be.
I know, I know, any old fool
can give advice, but worse yet,
this one can't even follow it after
he's given it. So I resort to the
often-held wish that I could sus
pend time for everyone but my
self, get busy and catch up, and
then turn time on again. Dream
or!!!!

Senior classmen and classwom
en might start sharpening up
their hooks. The Heritage Fund
Drive for Class of 'GO gets under
way soon with tryouts coming
sooner.
This year's seniors have a cut
out job ahead must top '59's
$16,000 collection for the sake of
prestige. The money, in case you
don't know, goes into a scholar
ship fund awards from which are

based on the value of leadership
shown by grant applications . . .
life is NOT all grades. Who says?
Clark $wanson heads this big
push with $cott Richmond a$ as
sociate director.
