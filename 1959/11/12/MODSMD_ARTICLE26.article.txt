Basketball Season
Believe it or not, the basketball season is only three weeks away.
The first varsity basketball game will be on Tuesday, Dec. 1, with
the University of San Francisco invading the Stanford I'avilion to
meet the hoopsters of Coach Howie Dallmar.
This year the Stanford Athletic Department has installed a new
plan for basketball tickets somewhat similar to the way the football
ticket sale was run.
According to Assistant Ahlctie Director Chuck Taylor the tickets
to the nine winter quarter home games in which Stanford plays its
old rivals from Pacific Coast Conference days, will he sold in ;i sea
son booklet.
The price of the nine game ticket hook will be $1 or approximately
45 cents per game. This price will save season ticket purchasers
f>o cents from what they would have had to pay if they purchased
each game individually at the old 50 cent price.

The season booklet does not in
clude the first three games of the
season; the San Francisco game,
Dec. 1, the San .lose game, Dec. 3,
or the St. Mary's game, Dec. !5.
The season tickets will go on
sale next Monday, Nov. !<!, at the
Department of Athletics ticket
office, and will be sold through
Wednesday, Nov. 25. There will
be additional sales of season
tickets at the beginning of winter
quarter, Jan. 4 through <> pro
vided there are leftovers from
the November sales.
Tickets for the three December
games will be available to stu
dents and faculty at the Athletic
Department ticket office Nov. I(!
through 25 at 50 cents each.
To the basketball fan who pre
fers to attend only a few of the
games, this ticket policy poses a
problem. However, if he is a
gambler and doesn't mind which
game or games he sees, there is
still a possibility that he could
buy his tickets at the door. The

reason for this lies in the fact that alter the season ticket sales to
students have been completed next January, ihe remaining seats
for each game will be offered to alumni and friends of the University.
If these seats are not sold out, then there will he tickets available at
the door the night of the game.
It is not t<»o likely, however, that any of the better games such as
the California games Jan. J) and March f>, or the USC games Feb. 13
and 26, will have any empty seats remaining come the night of the
game.
One feature of the new plan that makes it a little more bearable
to the casual fan is the transferability of the tickets. Any student or
faculty member can use tlie tickets from any book. In this case a
dormitory or fraternity house could purchase a few books and then
have tickets around for anyone who wanted to use them. Of course,
most fans will be interested in the better games and fewer will want
the tickets to the lesser attractions.
Why I lie New Plan?
The reason for the new ticket policy is mainly so that the Athletic
Department can have some idea of how many people will be at the,
games. Why is it that this year suddenly the Athletic Department
needs to know how many are going to attend games when in all the
years previous they were content to let sales for each game run
individually?
The answer to that is simply that the Athletic Department has
to earn more money from basketball than they have in the past if
the sport is going to be able to survive at the caliber it has reached
in the last decade. Guarantees to opponents went up (ill per cent this
year. In previous years visiting teams only had to be guaranteed i
$750, a sum which the Pavilion receipts barely cleared. This year the
guarantee has been upped to $1250.
By selling season tickets, the Athletic Department can judge how
much of the $1250 they will be able to make for each game.

Talking about basketball, it looks like Cal is again going to be
the team to beat out on the West Coast. I)arial Imliott' is back at
center for the Bears. The 6-10 Imhoft' who has always boon noted
for his defensive prowess is, according to sources at Cal, going to do
a lot more scoring this year. Hill McClintock, <>-"), will tie at forward
for Cal, and <>-7 Stan Morrison will probably hold down the other
forward spot. Gone trom last year's NCAA championship team are
guard Denny Fitzpatriek and Al Buch. But the Bears are counting
on Jerry Mann, Far I Seluiltz, and Bob Wendell to fill in at guard.
Fitzpatriek, incidently, will be around to coach his replacements.
He's an assistant coach at Cal now.

The first varsity basketball game will be on Tuesday, Dec. 1, with
the University of San Francisco invading the Stanford I'avilion to
meet the hoopsters of Coach Howie Dallmar.
This year the Stanford Athletic Department has installed a new
plan for basketball tickets somewhat similar to the way the football
ticket sale was run.
According to Assistant Ahlctie Director Chuck Taylor the tickets
to the nine winter quarter home games in which Stanford plays its
old rivals from Pacific Coast Conference days, will he sold in ;i sea
son booklet.
The price of the nine game ticket hook will be $1 or approximately
45 cents per game. This price will save season ticket purchasers
f>o cents from what they would have had to pay if they purchased
each game individually at the old 50 cent price.

The season booklet does not in
clude the first three games of the
season; the San Francisco game,
Dec. 1, the San .lose game, Dec. 3,
or the St. Mary's game, Dec. !5.
The season tickets will go on
sale next Monday, Nov. !<!, at the
Department of Athletics ticket
office, and will be sold through
Wednesday, Nov. 25. There will
be additional sales of season
tickets at the beginning of winter
quarter, Jan. 4 through <> pro
vided there are leftovers from
the November sales.
Tickets for the three December
games will be available to stu
dents and faculty at the Athletic
Department ticket office Nov. I(!
through 25 at 50 cents each.
To the basketball fan who pre
fers to attend only a few of the
games, this ticket policy poses a
problem. However, if he is a
gambler and doesn't mind which
game or games he sees, there is
still a possibility that he could
buy his tickets at the door. The

reason for this lies in the fact that alter the season ticket sales to
students have been completed next January, ihe remaining seats
for each game will be offered to alumni and friends of the University.
If these seats are not sold out, then there will he tickets available at
the door the night of the game.
It is not t<»o likely, however, that any of the better games such as
the California games Jan. J) and March f>, or the USC games Feb. 13
and 26, will have any empty seats remaining come the night of the
game.
One feature of the new plan that makes it a little more bearable
to the casual fan is the transferability of the tickets. Any student or
faculty member can use tlie tickets from any book. In this case a
dormitory or fraternity house could purchase a few books and then
have tickets around for anyone who wanted to use them. Of course,
most fans will be interested in the better games and fewer will want
the tickets to the lesser attractions.
Why I lie New Plan?
The reason for the new ticket policy is mainly so that the Athletic
Department can have some idea of how many people will be at the,
games. Why is it that this year suddenly the Athletic Department
needs to know how many are going to attend games when in all the
years previous they were content to let sales for each game run
individually?
The answer to that is simply that the Athletic Department has
to earn more money from basketball than they have in the past if
the sport is going to be able to survive at the caliber it has reached
in the last decade. Guarantees to opponents went up (ill per cent this
year. In previous years visiting teams only had to be guaranteed i
$750, a sum which the Pavilion receipts barely cleared. This year the
guarantee has been upped to $1250.
By selling season tickets, the Athletic Department can judge how
much of the $1250 they will be able to make for each game.

Talking about basketball, it looks like Cal is again going to be
the team to beat out on the West Coast. I)arial Imliott' is back at
center for the Bears. The 6-10 Imhoft' who has always boon noted
for his defensive prowess is, according to sources at Cal, going to do
a lot more scoring this year. Hill McClintock, <>-"), will tie at forward
for Cal, and <>-7 Stan Morrison will probably hold down the other
forward spot. Gone trom last year's NCAA championship team are
guard Denny Fitzpatriek and Al Buch. But the Bears are counting
on Jerry Mann, Far I Seluiltz, and Bob Wendell to fill in at guard.
Fitzpatriek, incidently, will be around to coach his replacements.
He's an assistant coach at Cal now.

The first varsity basketball game will be on Tuesday, Dec. 1, with
the University of San Francisco invading the Stanford I'avilion to
meet the hoopsters of Coach Howie Dallmar.
This year the Stanford Athletic Department has installed a new
plan for basketball tickets somewhat similar to the way the football
ticket sale was run.
According to Assistant Ahlctie Director Chuck Taylor the tickets
to the nine winter quarter home games in which Stanford plays its
old rivals from Pacific Coast Conference days, will he sold in ;i sea
son booklet.
The price of the nine game ticket hook will be $1 or approximately
45 cents per game. This price will save season ticket purchasers
f>o cents from what they would have had to pay if they purchased
each game individually at the old 50 cent price.

The season booklet does not in
clude the first three games of the
season; the San Francisco game,
Dec. 1, the San .lose game, Dec. 3,
or the St. Mary's game, Dec. !5.
The season tickets will go on
sale next Monday, Nov. !<!, at the
Department of Athletics ticket
office, and will be sold through
Wednesday, Nov. 25. There will
be additional sales of season
tickets at the beginning of winter
quarter, Jan. 4 through <> pro
vided there are leftovers from
the November sales.
Tickets for the three December
games will be available to stu
dents and faculty at the Athletic
Department ticket office Nov. I(!
through 25 at 50 cents each.
To the basketball fan who pre
fers to attend only a few of the
games, this ticket policy poses a
problem. However, if he is a
gambler and doesn't mind which
game or games he sees, there is
still a possibility that he could
buy his tickets at the door. The

reason for this lies in the fact that alter the season ticket sales to
students have been completed next January, ihe remaining seats
for each game will be offered to alumni and friends of the University.
If these seats are not sold out, then there will he tickets available at
the door the night of the game.
It is not t<»o likely, however, that any of the better games such as
the California games Jan. J) and March f>, or the USC games Feb. 13
and 26, will have any empty seats remaining come the night of the
game.
One feature of the new plan that makes it a little more bearable
to the casual fan is the transferability of the tickets. Any student or
faculty member can use tlie tickets from any book. In this case a
dormitory or fraternity house could purchase a few books and then
have tickets around for anyone who wanted to use them. Of course,
most fans will be interested in the better games and fewer will want
the tickets to the lesser attractions.
Why I lie New Plan?
The reason for the new ticket policy is mainly so that the Athletic
Department can have some idea of how many people will be at the,
games. Why is it that this year suddenly the Athletic Department
needs to know how many are going to attend games when in all the
years previous they were content to let sales for each game run
individually?
The answer to that is simply that the Athletic Department has
to earn more money from basketball than they have in the past if
the sport is going to be able to survive at the caliber it has reached
in the last decade. Guarantees to opponents went up (ill per cent this
year. In previous years visiting teams only had to be guaranteed i
$750, a sum which the Pavilion receipts barely cleared. This year the
guarantee has been upped to $1250.
By selling season tickets, the Athletic Department can judge how
much of the $1250 they will be able to make for each game.

Talking about basketball, it looks like Cal is again going to be
the team to beat out on the West Coast. I)arial Imliott' is back at
center for the Bears. The 6-10 Imhoft' who has always boon noted
for his defensive prowess is, according to sources at Cal, going to do
a lot more scoring this year. Hill McClintock, <>-"), will tie at forward
for Cal, and <>-7 Stan Morrison will probably hold down the other
forward spot. Gone trom last year's NCAA championship team are
guard Denny Fitzpatriek and Al Buch. But the Bears are counting
on Jerry Mann, Far I Seluiltz, and Bob Wendell to fill in at guard.
Fitzpatriek, incidently, will be around to coach his replacements.
He's an assistant coach at Cal now.
