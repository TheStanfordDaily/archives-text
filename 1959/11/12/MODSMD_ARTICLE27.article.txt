### Chack Bischoff

hall team wound up its season
last Saturday with a record of
two victories and two defeats
rgainst AAWU opponents. The
I'apooses split two games with
the California Bear Cubs, win
ning 40 to 34 and losing 14 to 7
in their first and last games. In
between they downed (JSC's Tro
babes 27 to 21 and fell to the
lirubabes of UCLA by 27 to 13.
At the last meeting of the
team, the players selected left
guard Starr Hounds as the win
ner of the outstanding player
trophy. Hounds, who stands 6-2
and weighs 215 pounds, was sec
ond on the team in total time
played, lie showed up as a strong
all-around football player, even
though the guard position was
completely new to him.

Hounds was selected primarily
because of his great team play.
He demonstrated this early in fall
practice when he gladly shifted
from first string left tackle to
■ I

second string center in order to
help the team. But Hounds could
not be kept off the first string
and won a starting job at guard.
Player Named Captain
Right guard Steve Player was
also honored by his teammates
who elected him team captain.
Although Player weighs only
about 190 pounds, he made up for
it in desire and played the guard
position like a big man. Player

was especially good at pulling out
of the line and leading the down
field interference.
Unfortunately, Steve was not
i able to play a single complete
i game because of in juries. First

il was an ankle injury which
was often reaggravated, and then
against Cal he suffered a chest
injury.
Coach Kates Potential
When asked to single out the
best prospects for the varsity
squad next year, Coach Homer
Smith declared, "Everyone on this
squad has varsity potential de
pending on what they do with it
in tlie next two or three years."
However, he did name several
players as being most valuable
next year. Ends Chris .lessen and
Tom Fetherston should help to
replace Hit 1 many varsity ends
lost through graduation. A good
deal depends on how well .lessen
recovers from a recent knee
operation.
The addition of 220 pound right
tackle C. B. Simons as well as
Rounds and I'layer should bols
ter the interior line. The running

attack of the varsity will he
helped by the addition of Ed Cum
mings and Mick Doherty. And
quarterback John Power, a fine
team leader as well as passer,
will he a candidate to crash the al
ready deep ranks of Stanford
quarterbacks.
Team Shows Spirit
Coach Smith stated that "my
biggest concern at the beginning
of the season was with the team
play and spirit of the squad."
But after the first game the
team showed that it was not lack
ing in these essentials.
The rushing attack, led by the
hard running of Doherty and
Cummings showed up very well.
The passing, done mostly by
Power, was more polished than is
usual for a freshman team, espe
cially in the first few games be
fore the top receivers were hurt.
However, Smith was not so
pleased with the defense. He said
that his greatest disappointment
was in t he serious lapses made in
individual positions on defense.
"There was a lack of understand
ing of what it takes to play good
defensive football an 11 man ef
fort on every play," stated Smith.
The coach was also disappointed
that the Papooses did not defeat
Cal a second time. He picked
this game as the best perform
ance turned in by the Frosh but
explained, "we beat ourselves."

Coach Kates Potential
When asked to single out the
best prospects for the varsity
squad next year, Coach Homer
Smith declared, "Everyone on this
squad has varsity potential de
pending on what they do with it
in tlie next two or three years."
However, he did name several
players as being most valuable
next year. Ends Chris .lessen and
Tom Fetherston should help to
replace Hit 1 many varsity ends
lost through graduation. A good
deal depends on how well .lessen
recovers from a recent knee
operation.
The addition of 220 pound right
tackle C. B. Simons as well as
Rounds and I'layer should bols
ter the interior line. The running

attack of the varsity will he
helped by the addition of Ed Cum
mings and Mick Doherty. And
quarterback John Power, a fine
team leader as well as passer,
will he a candidate to crash the al
ready deep ranks of Stanford
quarterbacks.
Team Shows Spirit
Coach Smith stated that "my
biggest concern at the beginning
of the season was with the team
play and spirit of the squad."
But after the first game the
team showed that it was not lack
ing in these essentials.
The rushing attack, led by the
hard running of Doherty and
Cummings showed up very well.
The passing, done mostly by
Power, was more polished than is
usual for a freshman team, espe
cially in the first few games be
fore the top receivers were hurt.
However, Smith was not so
pleased with the defense. He said
that his greatest disappointment
was in t he serious lapses made in
individual positions on defense.
"There was a lack of understand
ing of what it takes to play good
defensive football an 11 man ef
fort on every play," stated Smith.
The coach was also disappointed
that the Papooses did not defeat
Cal a second time. He picked
this game as the best perform
ance turned in by the Frosh but
explained, "we beat ourselves."

Cal a second time. He picked

STAKE HOUNDS
Great Team Play
Tho Stanford freshman fool
hall team wound up its season
last Saturday with a record of
two victories and two defeats
rgainst AAWU opponents. The
I'apooses split two games with
the California Bear Cubs, win
ning 40 to 34 and losing 14 to 7
in their first and last games. In
between they downed (JSC's Tro
babes 27 to 21 and fell to the
lirubabes of UCLA by 27 to 13.
At the last meeting of the
team, the players selected left
guard Starr Hounds as the win
ner of the outstanding player
trophy. Hounds, who stands 6-2
and weighs 215 pounds, was sec
ond on the team in total time
played, lie showed up as a strong
all-around football player, even
though the guard position was
completely new to him.

Hounds was selected primarily
because of his great team play.
He demonstrated this early in fall
practice when he gladly shifted
from first string left tackle to
■ I

second string center in order to
help the team. But Hounds could
not be kept off the first string
and won a starting job at guard.
Player Named Captain
Right guard Steve Player was
also honored by his teammates
who elected him team captain.
Although Player weighs only
about 190 pounds, he made up for
it in desire and played the guard
position like a big man. Player

was especially good at pulling out
of the line and leading the down
field interference.
Unfortunately, Steve was not
i able to play a single complete
i game because of in juries. First

il was an ankle injury which
was often reaggravated, and then
against Cal he suffered a chest
injury.
Coach Kates Potential
When asked to single out the
best prospects for the varsity
squad next year, Coach Homer
Smith declared, "Everyone on this
squad has varsity potential de
pending on what they do with it
in tlie next two or three years."
However, he did name several
players as being most valuable
next year. Ends Chris .lessen and
Tom Fetherston should help to
replace Hit 1 many varsity ends
lost through graduation. A good
deal depends on how well .lessen
recovers from a recent knee
operation.
The addition of 220 pound right
tackle C. B. Simons as well as
Rounds and I'layer should bols
ter the interior line. The running

attack of the varsity will he
helped by the addition of Ed Cum
mings and Mick Doherty. And
quarterback John Power, a fine
team leader as well as passer,
will he a candidate to crash the al
ready deep ranks of Stanford
quarterbacks.
Team Shows Spirit
Coach Smith stated that "my
biggest concern at the beginning
of the season was with the team
play and spirit of the squad."
But after the first game the
team showed that it was not lack
ing in these essentials.
The rushing attack, led by the
hard running of Doherty and
Cummings showed up very well.
The passing, done mostly by
Power, was more polished than is
usual for a freshman team, espe
cially in the first few games be
fore the top receivers were hurt.
However, Smith was not so
pleased with the defense. He said
that his greatest disappointment
was in t he serious lapses made in
individual positions on defense.
"There was a lack of understand
ing of what it takes to play good
defensive football an 11 man ef
fort on every play," stated Smith.
The coach was also disappointed
that the Papooses did not defeat
Cal a second time. He picked
this game as the best perform
ance turned in by the Frosh but
explained, "we beat ourselves."
