# OSC Single Wing Attack Poses Puzzle for Cards
## 
### 
The Stanford Indians faro a
momentous task this week. First
of all, they must improve their
defense against a single wing at
tack, a defense that allowed 55
points to the single winging
IJCLA Bruins, and secondly, they
must put together an offensive
attack to score on the defense
minded Oregon State Beavers.
The defense has drawn the
major part of the efforts of the
Indians in practice this week.
But they are going to have to do
without the services of two of
their top guards, Tom Walsh and
Don Peter. Peter underwent
surgery oil his knee, hut Walsh
is expected to he back for Big
Game.
Ilraced at Guard
Ron Fernandes and Larry
Lacey will handle the guard spots
for the Red and White. Inci
dentally, Fernandes wears two
knee braces and Lacey wears one.
Both have been troubled with
knee injuries this season, but are
in top shape now.
One bright spot for the Indians
is the return to full duty of tackle
Phil Burkland. Burkland pulled
a muscle in his thigh two weeks
ago and then injured a shoulder
a week ago. Both injuries are
cured and the big tackle has been
going full steam in practice all
week.
Another tackle. Trev Grimm,

has been counted out of the Cor
vallis trip, and Jack Gordon,
who filled in for Ilurkland, in
jured his hack hut is expected
to be ready come Saturday.
Bowers Returns
Dick Bowers, slowed for two
weeks with a pulled hamstring
muscle, is ready for full duly and
will start at the halfback slot
against the Beavers.
The offense has also had to do
some work, since it was able to
score only 13 points against the
Bruins. The main reason for this
was a disappointing performance
by quarterback Dick Norman.
Norman's passing in practice
has been sharp, but it will take
more than Norman's fine passing
to dain the Beavers. The Indians
are going to have to put handles
oti the ball or something. Last
week the Cards lost the ball on
fumbles three times, and it cost
them the ball game.
