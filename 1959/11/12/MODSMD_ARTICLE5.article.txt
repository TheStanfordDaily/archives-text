# Cardinals Up Floating Fund
## 
### 
Cardinals decided Tuesday to
raise the percentage of the con
tributions they will take from
WHS, Winter Drives and Con
Homo Drive for this year's AS
SU floating charity fund.
In previous years when the
Drive Commission has been in
charge of the floating fund, 2
per cent of the intake from each
of the drives has gono into it.
This year Cardinals will take 3
per cent from both WHS and Con
Homo and 6 per cent from Win
ter Drives.
This money goes into the float
ing fund and is used for token
gifts to other charities which ap
proach the Associated Students
for contributions throughout the
year. The raise in percentage will
increase tho total fund from $150
to $600 and make it possible for
the Legislature to give more sig
nificant gifts to these charities.
Bookstore rebate money and
contributions made to the differ
ent drives after their books have
i been closed make up the rest of
| the floating fund.
