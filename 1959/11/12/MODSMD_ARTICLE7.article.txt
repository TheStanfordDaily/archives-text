# Stanford Graduate Claims Solution to Smog Problem
## 
### 
"Smog" may soon be an answer
on an ancient history exam ques
tion. A Stanford man announced
an invention yesterday that elimi
nates 60 per cent of the smog pro
ducing hydrocarbons from auto
mobile exhausts.
The inventor, Ralph M. Heintz,
confided that not only has it re
duced the smog from his 1956
Chrysler but after installation
his gas mileage shot from 15 to
22 miles per gallon.
Heintz' invention converts en
gines to diesel operation. He has
been burning regular gas, diesel
fuel, kerosene, and alcohol in his
modified Chrysler engine. "Of
course," Heintz said, "what works
best is jet aircraft fuel.

"Where can I get your inven
tion put on my car?" a reporter
asked at a press conference yes
terday. "Nowhere,' 1 replied
Ileintz.
The Detroit automobile corpora
tions have not shown any inter
est, stated the inventor, but sev
eral "unnamed" organizations are
planning to look at the new sys
tem.
Test engines employ continuous

fuel injection with combustion oc
during in two interconnected
chambers a small pre-eombus
tion chamber fitting into the
spark plug well, and a main firing
chamber. This produces diesel
like combustion in the presence of
plenty of oxygen.
( ar Smog:
William C. Thuman of the
Stanford Research Institute said
from 70 to 90 per cent of Los
Angeles smog is due to hydro
carbons from auto exhausts. This
means smog there could be cut in
half using Henitz' invention.
Scientists meeting in Los An
geles Tuesday testified that smog
elements from cars can cause
serious respiratory and pulmo
nary malfunctions if not kept at
a low level.
Heintz, a 1920 alumnus with a
Chemistry degree, is a retired
partner in a Cleveland aircraft
equipment firm, lie developed
his "Ram Straticharge Combus
tion System" as a hobby during
the last six years.
The inventor presently resides
in Los Gatos.
