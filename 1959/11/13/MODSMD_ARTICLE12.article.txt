# Newton Right, Orbit Wrong
## 
### 
An attempt to initiate a
"Stanford-in-Orbit" project tail
ed yesterday morning when the
rocket misfired and broke a
window.
Demonstrating Newton's third
law to a Physical Sciences i
class about 9:30 a.m., Dr. Al
varez-Tostado fired a com
pressed-air powered roc k e t
which failed to follow its plan
ned trajectory and punctured
a window in Room 370.
Ably assisted by his class,
Dr. Tostado laughed off the ac
cident, commenting: "It's the
first time . . ."
