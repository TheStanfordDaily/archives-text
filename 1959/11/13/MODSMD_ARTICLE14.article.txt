### Anne Cowen 
"The Vienna Youth Festival was not a political gathering, but
lather one that emphasized peace and friendship among nations."
That statement was made by James Morrison, in an address to
the YWCA Public Affairs Luncheon group yesterday. Morrison, a
graduate student in political science, attended the Festival this sum-

mer. 17,000 young people from
i 102 nations were there.
Focus on Culture
Morrison described t lie focus of
, the Festival as "chiefly cultural."
1 The delegates received tickets to
, Vienna theaters, and saw per
formances of opera, ballet, and
theatrical companies of many na
tions. Folk dancing and music
i were also presented.
Morrison stated that the West
\ ern press issued distorted reports
J of the Festival. "Any Communist
; propaganda there was very sub
tle." he said. "There were no
; speeches. There was no denuncia-
I tion of the West."
In many instances the U.S. dele
; gation made an unfavorable im
pression, Morrison noted. "The
j Communists had financed the
Festival and arranged the cul
tural exhibits. They set the tone.
U.S. Kude, Critical
"In contrast, Ihe U.S. delega
tion contributed little. It was often
rude and critical. Beside subtle
Russian propaganda, '.soapbox'
! demonstrations by U.S. delegates
were ineffective and antagonistic.
They appeared to repudiate the
Festival theme of peace and
friendship."
