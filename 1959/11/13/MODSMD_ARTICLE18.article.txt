## Corker Wins In 8 Recount Frosh Race 
### 
Overcoming a 300-vote deficit
in the primary elections, Phil
Huyck won the position of head
yell leader with 1069 votes to
Taffy Symonds' 893.
Huy c k told The Daily, "Of
course I'm surprised. Anyone
who was down 300 votes in the
primaries is bound to be sur
prised.
"I plan to utilize a five-man
cheerleading team, each man
sharing the work equally. As to
whether my approach will be sim
ilar to Kartozian's, it is hard to
say. Kartozian's activities have
been geared to football, where en
tertainment is more important
than the cheers themselves.
Own Style
"But basketball season is a dif
ferent thing, where straight yells
are more appropriate. And, of
course, each individual haÂ« His
own style."
In the race for Class of '63 pres
ident, Steve C o rker beat Pete
Hoagland with 430 votes to 423,

required before both candidates
wore satisfied.
