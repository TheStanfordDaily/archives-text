A god fell last week. Hard.
The sound of the fall was
perhaps loudest in the ears of
college and university cam
puses throughout the country.
The New York Times' head
lines told the story: "Van Doren
Admits Lying; Says TV Quiz Was
Fixed; Loses His Columbia Post."
And pictures of the god crying
on his wife's shoulder were on
the front pages of almost all of
the nation's papers.
But the reaction in the uni
versities was mainly on the
editorial page: "Hoax," "Big
gest Fraud of All," "Ignorance
Is Strength."
From the Cornell Daily Sun,
irony. "Mark Van Doren, father
of the prodigal son, welcomed
him back after his testimony be
fore the House Committee with
open arms: 'I fee] wonderful. This
is the happiest day of my life,' he
observed. Everyone present, con
gressmen . . . lawyers, friends;
all of the deluded now enlightened
flocked around the repentent sin
ner, offering praise for his extra
ordinary moral fortitude in ad
mitting his guill when there was
no longer any doubt of it. . . .
"Where does (such a man)
go? What does he do? 'I want
to live very much,' he said. He
remarked that he might go to
Brazil. We wish him luck there.
We hope we have seen the last
of him here. For, in his own
words, 'i have done a disserv
ice to all of them.' Heaven pro
tect us from any more such
•disservices.'
"Judging from past perform
ances, there is little if any moral
responsibility connected with
sponsoring a television program,
at least not in the sweet-smelling
rank of Revlon, Inc."
The Daily Kansas had this to
say:
"The television disgrace has
pierced the flimsy armor that
long has sheltered Our Way of
Life. . . .
"We will be vulnerable to the
future designs of liars, cheats,
and petty dictators until the day
we snap out of our complacency
and earn our freedom."
The Connecticut Daily Campus:
"The very nature of the quiz
show was deceiving. To think
that an excellent memory for
facts, names and dates con
stitutes a well-educated and in
telligent person is a miscon
ception. To exalt this kind of

intelligence is dishonest in it
self and to put it on parade
in an isolation booth with
soupy music in the background
is to completely debase the na
ture of intelligence. . . .
"The professor stands in front
of his classroom as a paragon
of this virtue of honesty, a qual
ity of which everyone has some
universal idea. . . .
"Van Doren has been receiving
letters from people all over the
country sympathizing with him.
He said about these letters, along
| with his students at Columbia,
'They have been just wonderful
to me, just wonderful.' It would
seem that the American public
doesn't mind being defrauded."
In a two-sided view of the
situation, the Michigan Daily
said, "Van Doren's chief value
as television property lay in the
cleverly constructed illusion
that here was a man of honor
accumulating wealth through
sheer exercise of his mental
resources.
"In this context, commercialism
doesn't look cheap. With this gim
mick, intellectualism can be sold
on the level of the average view
er.
"Van Doren is identified in the
public's mind with the American
intellectual. He has given the
newspapers reason to assert that
an outstanding member of this
group has confessed to being "a
liar, a cheat and a coward—moti
vated by greed for money."
Professors of SC termed the
whole episode "A sad example
of American society's prostitu
tion of the intellectual."
They maintained that whenever
a society rewards intellectual ac
complishments by putting dollar
signs on them, perjury as exem
plified by Van Doren will exist.
The most positive point came
from the Michigan Daily's pro
side of the argument.
"The issue of the man is not
of prime importance here.
There is the possibility that
Van Doren's deception and sub
sequent confession may yield
something wortliwile yet. If
controls on television are
tightened, some programs with
honesty and educational value
worth more than $04,000 could
emerge and fill the gaps."
At any rate, there is a good
English professor reading the
want ads now.
