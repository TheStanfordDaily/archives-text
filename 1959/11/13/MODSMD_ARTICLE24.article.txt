# As I See It

The time has come to destroy
an idol. We have knell before the
image of conservatism long
enough. Because we have hesi
tated so long in destroying this
god we have lost the leadership
of the freedom-loving peoples of
the world.
Because we still worship him
our penal system is medieval,
our government moves at the
pace of a gopher in cement,
and worst of all, our educa
tional system is 20 years behind
the times. Educators are still
groping with the question of
whether it is advisable to re
place home economics and
driver education with science
and history.
The question then is not should
we change, it is how and in what
direction we should change. The
local opponents of this philosophy
are obviously aware of the history
of their conservatism. They quote
from it rather freely.
But they haven't really learned
a damn thing from all their
searchings. They haven't learned
history's most poignant and sig
nificant lesson, which is simply
that the conservative and stag
nant society dies and is replaced
by a liberal and energetic one.
To remind them of this let
them recall that the Czars were
removed by the Bolsheviks,
the French Royalists by the Re
public, Batista by Castro, and
lest we all forget, the European
colonial powers in this country
by a bunch of revolutionaries
led by the greatest liberals of
their time: Washington, Jeffer
son and Madison and many
others.
A parable might help to eluci
date the effects of excessive con
servatism.
Let's assume for a minute that
there were once two societies liv
ing on opposite sides of the earth.
The people of one of these so
cieties became emotionally ma
ture at the age of 15.
At this age they were con
servative in their businesses
and amusements, (rowdiness
was something engaged in only
when in granunar school); they
were orthodox in their religion
and reactionary in their polities.
By the age of 20 these people
were apathetic about life and they
considered the ethical progress of
civilization to be a dream. As
generations passed, the vigor of
this society steadily declined.
Most people were too depressed
to reproduce and this activity was
left to the mentally inferior.

The other group of men fared
much better. These people ma
tured later, and usually didn't
develop conservative attitudes
j until they were MO or 40.
The young people of this so
ciety thought that life was
worth living and they were even
optimistic enough to work and
hope for changes that would
bring peace and brotherhood.
As we can see, it is this latter
group that has survived. The
other civilization, which was
characterized by premature dis
illusionment and cynicism, is no
longer here to tell its own story.
What is the significance of all
this? First it shows us that lib
eralism and idealism are probably
assets of our species. And that
without I hem we might lose the
ability to change and thus end up
keeping the dinosaurs company.
Secondly it demonstrates lhat,
while conservatism in everyone
could cause a rigidity that could
not adapt to changing conditions,
a certain amount of conservatism
might have some value.
I readily acknowledge lhat
anarchy and confusion would
result if the idealism and en
thusiasm of youth were allowed
to romp unfetered.
We need a balance, some point
of equilibrium between complete
conservatism and uncontrolled
liberalism. Either alone is not
satisfactory. The history of liv
ing things shows us that the
species which have put all their
eggs in one adaptive basket, that
is, concentrated their adaptive
capabilities along narrow paths,
have not survived.
It is very clear that variability
is an absolute necessity in a
cftangin.g environment The
course of the social evolution is
one of the best examples of this
principle.
We would be committing so
cial suicide if we all adopted
conservatism. When the youth
accept unconditionally and with
out question the institutions of
their fathers, even if these in
stitutions appear to function
adequately, we will be facing
our extinction.
The world about us is chang
ing. We not only should change,
we must change. The only altern
ative is to be changed. Which are
1 you learning, Russian or Chinese?
