Book Display
Editor, The Daily:

I should like to present to your
readers the results of an inquiry
into the reasons for the display
in the library on "The World's
' Press on a Day of Crisis" â€”
I Suez.
Around the I Centre M-lc-lm
Warner said that people did not
understand the gravity of the;
si t u at i on ; Han M-r-v-tz was
I heard to mutter "Egyptum in ties
partes divisum sit;" J-hn -nil
; blamed Standard Oil who were
, trying to distract attention from
I Saudi Arabia; the s-c-l-st c--c-s
j was unsure of its position and !
i wished to debate the issue . . .
The D-ght-rs -112 th- -m-r-c-n
: R-v-lt-t-n wore shocked to see
anything printed in a foreign
I language on display; the Kl- Kl-x
i Kin accused the J-ws of attempt
ing to gain sympathy.
A spokesman for the Br-t-sh
C-ns-l-t- said that much water had
! flowed under the bridge since
| then; The Fr-nch C-ns-1 was happy
| as long as people were not dis
cussing -lg-r-; and -sr-1- spokes
j man declared the next fund-rais
ing dinner would be at the end of
the month; the -g-pt-n C-ns-1 was
advertising for Canal pilots.
Around the faculties, opinions

varied from the H-sp n-c -m-r-c-n
St-d-s which N-ss-r was the great
est revolutionary leader since
Sm-n B-l-v-e-, to P-l-t-c-1 Sc--nc
which thought American Foreign
policy had been wrong.
The -r-b students pleaded the
fifth amendment.
Incidentally, whose idea was it
to set this propaganda on display?
