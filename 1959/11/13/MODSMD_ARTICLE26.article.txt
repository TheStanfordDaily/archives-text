# Indians to Meet Beavers
## 
### Stan Hulett 
Saturday, an Indian will go Beaver hunting. Rut 1 his is not a
tale of the "Wild West." The Indian will go armed with a football
rather than bow and arrows. The Beaver will bo dressed like a
football player for the occasion.
But the game may resemble the "Wild West." The Indian will be

using his fine passer, Dick Nor
man to shoot the Beaver. The
Beaver will counter with a de
fense to handle the shooting In
dian. But in all seriousness, the
Indians are going to have their
hands full when they meet the
single-winging Oregon Staters.
Last week the Indian firing
squad missed their target. But
they have been working 112 ir into
the night all week to improve
their markmanship. But the In
dians will have to more than shoot
at the Beaver, for these Beavers
have been known to shoot back,
and unfortunately for the Indians,
they use the same kind of gun
as the Bruin that almost killed
the Indians last week.
Injuries have hurt the Tribe.
Don Peter and Tom Walsh, both
standout guards, will be out for
this hunting trip. Also Trev
Grimm will be among the missing
when the Tribe journeys into the
North country.
The Beavers have, been working
hard and long this week to try to
put a stop to the leading passing
attack in the nation. The Indians
have averaged better than 205
yards a game through the air.
Stanford has not beaten the

Beavers since 1953, but hold the
series edge, IS-8. Lasi year, Ihe
Beavers look the measure of the
Indians 25-16. The Beavers were
iti hopes of a shot at the Rose
Bowl, but tho Cards could not
I beat the Bears and give the
Beavers a chance.
The weather could be a factor
in the hunt. If the usual wetness
prevails it could do much to
hinder the shooting of the In
dians. The ground game of the
Beavers would not be hurt to
much by the slippery ball, but it
could slow it somewhat.
But the Indians are determined
to break the Northern .jinx. As
one Indian put it, "We've got to
! get this one, we need this win
bad." And if the Indians can hang
onto the ball and not give it to
the Beavers on fumbles, they
could easily break the jinx and
give Jack Curtice his third win
of the 1959 season.
The Beavers on the other hand
will l)e looking to keep Tommy
Prothro's record of never losing
j to a Bay Area team intact. So
here we have the makings of a
wild game, with both teams hav
i ing nothing to lose.

Beavers would not be hurt to
much by the slippery ball, but it
could slow it somewhat.
But the Indians are determined
to break the Northern .jinx. As
one Indian put it, "We've got to
! get this one, we need this win
bad." And if the Indians can hang
onto the ball and not give it to
the Beavers on fumbles, they
could easily break the jinx and
give Jack Curtice his third win
of the 1959 season.
The Beavers on the other hand
will l)e looking to keep Tommy
Prothro's record of never losing
j to a Bay Area team intact. So
here we have the makings of a
wild game, with both teams hav
i ing nothing to lose.

Saturday, an Indian will go Beaver hunting. Rut 1 his is not a
tale of the "Wild West." The Indian will go armed with a football
rather than bow and arrows. The Beaver will bo dressed like a
football player for the occasion.
But the game may resemble the "Wild West." The Indian will be

using his fine passer, Dick Nor
man to shoot the Beaver. The
Beaver will counter with a de
fense to handle the shooting In
dian. But in all seriousness, the
Indians are going to have their
hands full when they meet the
single-winging Oregon Staters.
Last week the Indian firing
squad missed their target. But
they have been working 112 ir into
the night all week to improve
their markmanship. But the In
dians will have to more than shoot
at the Beaver, for these Beavers
have been known to shoot back,
and unfortunately for the Indians,
they use the same kind of gun
as the Bruin that almost killed
the Indians last week.
Injuries have hurt the Tribe.
Don Peter and Tom Walsh, both
standout guards, will be out for
this hunting trip. Also Trev
Grimm will be among the missing
when the Tribe journeys into the
North country.
The Beavers have, been working
hard and long this week to try to
put a stop to the leading passing
attack in the nation. The Indians
have averaged better than 205
yards a game through the air.
Stanford has not beaten the

Beavers since 1953, but hold the
series edge, IS-8. Lasi year, Ihe
Beavers look the measure of the
Indians 25-16. The Beavers were
iti hopes of a shot at the Rose
Bowl, but tho Cards could not
I beat the Bears and give the
Beavers a chance.
The weather could be a factor
in the hunt. If the usual wetness
prevails it could do much to
hinder the shooting of the In
dians. The ground game of the
Beavers would not be hurt to
much by the slippery ball, but it
could slow it somewhat.
But the Indians are determined
to break the Northern .jinx. As
one Indian put it, "We've got to
! get this one, we need this win
