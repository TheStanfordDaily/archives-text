# Harriers Go At San Jose
## 
### 
Stanford's cross-country squad
will take a six man team to an
all-comers meet at San Jose to
day for an affair which will bring
together the best runners in
Northern California.
Starting time is 4 p.m. at the
San Jose course.
The Indians are looking for
ward to this one, according to
Coach Payton Jordan, because it
will be an opportunity to picjt up
some trophies and medals.
Bob Mon/ingo, Bertil Lundh,
Ernie Cunliffe, John Northway,
Kim Maxwell and Rich Klier will
face entrants from nearly all the
Bay Area schools including Cal,
San Jose State, COP and San
Francisco State.
Maxwell will be making his first
start in several weeks as he has
been showing up better in practice
and is expected to start producing
up to his capabilities.
Mon/ingo will lead the Stan
ford hopes but it will probably
be good team running which wiil
keep the Indians in this one.
