## Daily Sports

A first division spot in the
Western Soccer Conference is at
stake Saturday, when Stanford
journeys to San Jose State to
meet the powerful Spartans.
The Indians have a 3-2 record
and San Jose is only one game
behind with a 2-2-1 tally. The com
parative scores favor the Spar
tans. Their loss to USF was only
1-0, as compared to Stanford's 4-
1 deficit. They also beat San
Francisco State 10-0, while the
Indians managed a 7-1 victory.
San Jose's main strength is
their forward line, which plays
rough. Center forw a r d Bo b
Meyers does virtually all of their
scoring from close shots, while
the other forwards are taking
care of the defensive team's back
field.
Stanford's defensive back lino
figures to bo able to take care of
itself. Such as fullbacks Dan
Farthing, Miklos Totossy, and
Tom Lief, and goalies Hunt Bas
com and Dick Viako are all big
boys and can handle anything
that comes their way.
Stanford's two Ail-American
candidates, Wolfgang Storch and
Bernie Knaggs, could solidify
their high ranking with their
usual excellent performances.
Storch has been moved to so
many different positions that
there is the question of which

posit ion is his best. He now is
playing teft half, but ho also has
played center half, inside loft
and center forward.
Knaggs is not a spectacular

player, even though when ho
played in Canada he was one ol
the highest scorers in his league
He was switched to inside whet
he came to Stanford. Inside or
the Stanford soccer team if
primarily a play-making position
So far this season, Bernie has at
assist for one out of two Stanforr
goals.
