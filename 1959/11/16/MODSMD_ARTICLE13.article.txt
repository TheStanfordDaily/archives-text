# GIVES 'NEEDED DISCUSSION'
## Rockefeller Tour Leaves State Republicans Baffled 
### Barnes Riznik 
Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller said in San Francisco Friday that his
reconnaissance of powerful Nixon-oriented Republican camps in Los
Angeles and San Francisco provided "needed discussion and con
troversy . . . we certainly don't want a monolithic party."
He reminded many Republicans that they do have a free choice

at an open convention next sum
mer and that the power to nomi
nate is t heir's, not the vice presi
dent's.
Come and Gone
New York's governor has come
and gone and everyone is still
confused about his candidacy.
Most perplexed of all are Bay
Area Young Republicans who are
pledged to Nixon's candidacy but
who mobbed the governor and
wound up the day parading with
"Rocky for President" placards.
It is understandable if Rocke
feller left California mildly ex
asperated.
In making the trip, Rockefeller
obviously chose to meet rank and
file Republicans and their leaders
halfway; but halfway may not be
far enough. As of now only two
major California Republicans,
former Lt. Gov. Harold Powers
and State Sen. John F. McCarthy
i(R- San Rafael) have declared
active support of Rockefeller's
candidacy against Nixon.
Policy Speeches
Rockefeller continued to give
policy speeches, on his swing
through Western states, outlining
his position on specific issues
which he wants discussed in the
campaign. In both Los Angeles
and in his Commonwealth Club-
Press Club address last week he j
came down hard on his interna- j
tional policy ideas.
He said that he does not believe j
Soviet Premier Khrushchev can j
"reveal values other than con
quest." Furthermore, the threat i
of Soviet imperialism is only one
challenge to American policy.
New Nations
Others, Rockefeller said, are
the need to help new nations "find
their rightful place in the inter
national community;" the prob
lem of strengthening and imple
menting the North Atlantic Com
munity, and "how to give hope to
struggling peoples, how to combat
misery and disease."
He asserted that the post-war
era has ended and that Western
Europe has reached a peak of;
prosperity which enables it to
join the United States in helping j
tackle problems of development j
in Africa and Asia.
Rockefeller added that the "con
cept of self sufficient nation
states cannot be the essential in
strument of the future."
NATO-Type Groups
He called for the growth of
regional groupings of nations
such as the Organization of Amer
ican States, NATO and the Euro
pean Economic Community.
At his newsmen's conference,
Rockefeller was pressed on this J
point and asked to elaborate on 1
problems of individual national I
state sovereignty.
He replied that all regional;
groupings depended entirely on i
"how much sovereignty each na-!
tion wanted to surrender." He;
also commented that in a forth-1
coming speech before the Foreign â– 


GOV. ROCKEFELLER, SECOND I RO.M LEFT, AT STANFORD-OREGON STATE GAME
Hi* was guest of Oregon Gov. Mark Halfk'W after San Francisco appearance
Trade Council in New York, he
will discuss this matter in more
detail.
Answers With Candor
In San Francisco, Rockefeller
answered all questions at his
speech and press conference with
candor. When he was asked which
qualifications best suited a man
for the presidency,, he named in
tegrity first.
Rockefeller spoke comfortably,
in detail, on matters concerning
New York state taxes, public ed
ucational problems, and political
corruption. At his lunch, he pro
tested that some questions which
were selected for him from the
overflow crowd were too general.

On the subject of reclamation |
and water-power, Rockefeller im
mediately confessed he was not
well-prepared to give a statement, j
To Decide in January
Rockefeller said he thinks he
will be able to decide by the end
of January if he will challenge
Nixon's claim to the Republican,
nomination in the round of spring
primaries.
Rockefeller looked fit and seri- !
ously intent upon his task of
finding out if he should try for
the nomination. During his day

I in San Francisco, Rockefeller ac
tively generated the politics him
self, often faced with noncom
mittal faces of the professional
partymen.
Some Strain
It was obviously some strain
for him to carry the initiative
| constantly. Climbing up the stairs
j of the Press Club he sought out
hands to shake his. Some of the
i onlookers, standing at the top of
the stairs, hesitated and retreated
a step, astonished by his vigor
and desire.
