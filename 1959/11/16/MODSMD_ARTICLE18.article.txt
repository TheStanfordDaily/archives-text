Institutionalization
of lho Scratch Sheet was recom
mended to this year's Legislature
in last spring's Legislature report.
But if "enough interest isn't
shown next fall so that it (the
Scratch Sheet) might be estab
lished as a full fledged publica
tion on its own—then we have no
other recommendation to make
except 1o let it appear sporadically
as it has in the past," another of
last spring's Legislature reports
on the Scratch Sheet said.
This year senior Stan John
son lias come to Legislature,
apparently with all the qualifi
cations and interest, and said
that he wants to edit a Scratch
Sheet. Legislature, faced with
two years of contused and am
biguous Scratch Sheet reports,
has been trying to unravel the
problem of what to do with
the Scratch Sheet for two
weeks now.
Johnson has explained that the
problem of putting out a Scratch
Sheet is much greater if it is not
institutionalized. "It's a lot bet
ter if you can tell your staff that
the sheet is a going concern and
that there is a chance to move up
through the ranks," Johnson
said.
"This way the editor can train
someone for the next year. People
won't have to jump into it cold,"
explained Johnson. And for a job
like the Scrtach Sheet, where one
has to take polls and handle op
inions and try to come up with
fair evaluations, one should have
an opportunity to get some ex
perience on the staff before be
coming editor.
"The best way to get a good
Scratch Sheet," Johnson said,
"is to set it up permanently
with continuity, a tradition and
an established scientific method
for taking samples."
Scientific sampling methods
should be developed, Johnson ex
plained, because we want to
"avoid someone taking it as a
soap box.
"Either now or in the future,"
Johnson emphasized, "the Scratch
Sheet should be set up on a per
manent basis if it is going to be
good."
Larry Grace, chairman of
Legislature's public relations
committee, explained that his
committee feels strongly that
it is worthwhile to institutional
ize the Scratch Sheet to give it
a solid foundation. "That will
give it something to build on —
a permanent organization. Then
they won't have to start over
again each year."
The Scratch Sheet constitution
was sent to Publications Board
last week for recommendations,

and Pub Board reported negative
ly. The Board found the financial
provisions in the constitution in
adequate, and the Board recom
mended that the Scratch Sheet
shouldn't be forced to publication
three times each year, that it
should only come out when people
are interested enough to do a
good job.
The Pub Board report also
recommended that the Scratch
Sheet not be placed on Pub
Board. "There is no value to
having the Scratch Sheet on
Pub Board," Chairman Bob d'-
Alessio explained, "their prob
lems are different than ours."*
D'Alessio gave his personal
views on some of the drawbacks
to institutionalizing the Scratch
Sheet:
"The most important thing in
producing the Scratch Sheet is
to get someone as editor who is
really interested in it, and insti
tutionalizing does nothing toward
this," d'Alessio said. "Institu
tionalizing is not going to give it
a strong permanent organization.
The Quad and Sequoia are insti
tutionalized, and have a lot more
organization than the Scratch
Sheet ever will, and they don't
have great continuity."
ASSU business manager Bob
Best commented that it seemed
to him that the best way to set
up the Scratch Sheet is to make
it an organization with a con
stitution under the ASSIJ and
put it under control of Publi
cations Board.
Assistant Business Manager Ed
Cutter agreed with Best that the
Scratch Sheet shouldn't be made
a permanent publication. lie
thought that Legislature ought to
let Stan Johnson reactivate the
Scratch Sheet as a club.
"Setting the Scratch Sheet up
as a publication under the ASSU
is not going to guarantee that it
will be good," Cutter said. "I
don't want to see the ASSU sanc
tion it. It is a job for students, but
not for the Associated Students.
"If people are interested
enough to come to Legislature
for approval, they may, and
Legislature can let them pub
lish a Scratch Sheet," Cutter
continued.
"But the student body should
have some control over the
Scratch Sheet. There is nothing
worse than a bad Scratch Sheet,
and one bad one can undo all the
work of a dozen good ones.
"Actually the Scratch Sheet is
worthless," Cu 11 e r continued.
"People read it out of curiosity,
but I doubt if many actually
change their programs because of
the evaluations of the Scratch
Sheet."
