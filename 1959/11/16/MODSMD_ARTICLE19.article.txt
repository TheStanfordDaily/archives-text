## Vienna Festival 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I feel that I must attempt to
correct the rather misleading im
pression which The Daily gave
about the Vienna Youth Festival
when it covered my talk last
Thursday. Small errors of quota
tion and quotations out of context
seriously changed the meaning of
what I said. I will restate briefly
some of my observations:
The Festival was clearly spon
sored, financed, and directed by
the communists. The motivation
for holding the Festival was un
doubtedly largely political. The
goal was apparently to give the
Festival delegates a positive
image of the communist world—
its economic and social progress,
its cultural achievements, its con
cern for youth, and its desire for
international peace and friend
ship.
The strategy chosen by the
Festival sponsors for achieveing
these goals, however, was one
which greatly de-emphasized po
litical issues, particularly the is
sues between East and West.
The focus of the Festival was
fun and culture with an empha
sis on the importance of inter
national peace and friendship. The
10-day Vienna gathering was
loosely organized and was built
around voluntary gatherings of
small groups for fun-making,
dancing, drinking, movie-view
ing, theatergoing, sports, and a
24-hour-a-day program of just
plain conversation.
The communist delegations
came prepared to provide the best
in cultural entertainment for the
non-communist delegates. The

serious meetings were neither
numerous nor well-attended and
were moderate in their criticisms
of Ihe West. The communists re
lied on the more subtle, overall
effect of the Festival.
It should be noted that most of
the delegates from non-communist
countries were not communists,
although many were critical of
Western politics and economics.
Most of the delegates (including
those from the communist world)
were not particularly interested
in political issues, were politically
naive, uninformed, and very
young and impressionable.
It was easy for them to chant
the Festival theme of peace and
friendship without asking "What
kind of peace?" or "How do we
go about getting it?"
The Festival presented a curi
ous dilemma for the West. In
order to reduce the prestige of the
Festival in the eyes of the world,
most Western governments and
youth organizations discouraged
groups from sending delegates
and tried to l<ccp individuals from
attending. }
This policy, however, left the
propaganda field to the commun
ists at the Festival, giving the
delegates a chance to see the
best of the communist world with
out having a chance to compare
it with the best of the non-com
munist world.
The minority of informed, anti
communist Westerners who were
there were often ineffective be
cause they went crusading around
the Festival grounds, praising
capitalism and denouncing com
munism in a manner which an
tagonized many and converted
few. James F. Morrison

Editor, The Daily:
I feel that I must attempt to
correct the rather misleading im
pression which The Daily gave
about the Vienna Youth Festival
when it covered my talk last
Thursday. Small errors of quota
tion and quotations out of context
seriously changed the meaning of
what I said. I will restate briefly
some of my observations:
The Festival was clearly spon
sored, financed, and directed by
the communists. The motivation
for holding the Festival was un
doubtedly largely political. The
goal was apparently to give the
Festival delegates a positive
image of the communist world—
its economic and social progress,
its cultural achievements, its con
cern for youth, and its desire for
international peace and friend
ship.
The strategy chosen by the
Festival sponsors for achieveing
these goals, however, was one
which greatly de-emphasized po
litical issues, particularly the is
sues between East and West.
The focus of the Festival was
fun and culture with an empha
sis on the importance of inter
national peace and friendship. The
10-day Vienna gathering was
loosely organized and was built
around voluntary gatherings of
small groups for fun-making,
dancing, drinking, movie-view
ing, theatergoing, sports, and a
24-hour-a-day program of just
plain conversation.
The communist delegations
came prepared to provide the best
in cultural entertainment for the
non-communist delegates. The

serious meetings were neither
numerous nor well-attended and
were moderate in their criticisms
of Ihe West. The communists re
lied on the more subtle, overall
effect of the Festival.
It should be noted that most of
the delegates from non-communist
countries were not communists,
although many were critical of
Western politics and economics.
Most of the delegates (including
those from the communist world)
were not particularly interested
in political issues, were politically
naive, uninformed, and very
young and impressionable.
It was easy for them to chant
the Festival theme of peace and
friendship without asking "What
kind of peace?" or "How do we
go about getting it?"
The Festival presented a curi
ous dilemma for the West. In
order to reduce the prestige of the
Festival in the eyes of the world,
most Western governments and
youth organizations discouraged
groups from sending delegates
and tried to l<ccp individuals from
attending. }
This policy, however, left the
propaganda field to the commun
ists at the Festival, giving the
delegates a chance to see the
best of the communist world with
out having a chance to compare
it with the best of the non-com
munist world.
The minority of informed, anti
communist Westerners who were
there were often ineffective be
cause they went crusading around
the Festival grounds, praising
capitalism and denouncing com
munism in a manner which an
tagonized many and converted
few. James F. Morrison
