## Activities Now 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
According to The Daily, (Nov.
12) the dedication of the proposed
Tresidder Union has l>een "am
bitiously set for two years from
now."
This "ambitious" lime limit
and perhaps even the "ambitious"
program of activities are com
mendable. For Stanford certainly
needs a Union alone with lines
outlined by Chester Berry.
But does the director and ASSU
have any immediate plans for Ihe
present "Union." Is there any rea
son why some of the director's
ideas might not be used now, even
if conditions are not ideal?
For example, a few procedural
and structural changes would
certainly facilitate food service
in the Cellar for the next twoâ€”
or more years.
Joe Thompson
