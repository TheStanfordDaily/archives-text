## Stamp-Out Time? 
### 
Kriitor, TliÂ»* Daily:
It's surprising that no civic
minded group has gotten around
! to forming a Help Stamp Out
| Little Old Ladies League. For
again those self-appointed protec
tors of the American Moral Ethic
j have, with a zeal that would
shame a Calvin, launched them
selves on a campaign to Save
America from Inward Decay.
The current crusade is directed
against that Communist-inspired
plot (you can't have a plot these
days without it being Communist
(inspired) to rot America's young
, lings with smut.
The forces of prudery have ex
j posed a danger, surely enough.
The danger is the ladies them
selves. And it is also that no one
bothers to take them seriously.
We're 100 young to remember
j Prohibition (save that we have
I the brooding ghost of Mrs. Stan
ford to remind us of the forces of
sweetness and light).
Congre.sswoman Granahan and
her hapless minions are quite
capable of putting their condom
; nations into law, and mainly be
cause no one takes their asinine
dogmatism seriously. Filth and
pornography there is, and there
is plenty.
The hovering giant is smut,
which is not only filth but a good
deal of quality fiction as well.
Smut contains many works of
literary art great novels, poetry.

But these can go by the boards,
according to the Little Olds, no
matter how iho author said what
ho did or what purpose he had in
saying it. They would confine our
reading to the DAR Journal and
weekly Sunday School papers.
Makes a fellow want to hide
his grandma's epsom salts.
