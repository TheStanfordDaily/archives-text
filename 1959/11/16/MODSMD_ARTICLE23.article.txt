# Tribe Traps
## Cards Beat OSC 39-22; Third Win 
### Stan Hulett 
CORVALLIS, Ore.â€”The hunting trip was a success. The Stan
ford Indians came here in search of Beaver and came through with
one of iheir finest games of the year in beating the Oregon State
Beavers 39-22.
The Indians put on quite a show for a visiting dignitary, New

York Governor Nelson Rocke
feller, who was a guest of Oregon
Governor Mark Hatfield. "Rocky"
had a Red and Orange blanket,
OSC's colors, but it didn't help
the Beavers at all.
It was a tremendous team ef
fort as the Indians played up to
their potential and outdid the
Beavers in all departments. Skip
Face versatile Indian fullback
p,cored 27 points, three touch
downs, a field goal, a two point
conversion, and four one point
conversions.
Dick Norman showed the Ore
gon State fans why he is the total
offense leader in the nation as he
gained a total of 286 yards rush
ing and passing. Norman took
to the ground and showed that
he could run the ball as he rolled
49 yards on the ground.
Good Blocking
The fine blocking of Ben Rob
inson and Mac Wylie opened up
the ground game of the Indians.
Robinson gave Norman the blocks
he needed on his rambles. And
Wylie, well he was his usual
devastating self blocking on the
pitchout, the pitchout that the
Indians employed on four of their
five TD's. Wylie threw the key
blocks on two of Face's three
scores.
Wlyie also ate up largo chunks
of yardage for the Cards. The
junior halfback was also a key
man in the defensive effort, which
held the single-winging Beavers
1o 186 yards on the ground.
And Chris Burford was his usual
self, catching passes, blocking,
and tackling all over the field.
The cold weather, the tempera
ture at game time was 48, did
not seem to bother the great end
as he pulled flown seven Norman
aerials for 131 yards and one TD.
Braced Guards
And the braced up guards, Ron
Fernandes and Larry Lacey, both
played great games in the Tribe
foryyard wall. Fernandes took
quite a beating, but was in the
game all the way. As Coach Jack
Curtice said after the game.
"They were playing for their
lives."
The Tribe defense was good,
but the offense was even greater.
The Indians capitalized on all the
breaks and made few mistakes of
their own. The Cards only lost
the ball on fumbles once, and
once on an interception.
The offense rolled up 415 yards
second only to the 509 yards in
the San Jose game. The first
three times the Indians got the
ball they scored, and they looked
unstoppable.
At the start of the game how
ever, it looked like the Beavers

were going to roll light over the
Indians.
Stanford kicked off to the
Beavers and speedy Ron Miller
returned the ball to the OSC 32.
Don Kasso, the Berkeley soph,
hit right end for eight, passed to
Aaron Thomas for 12, banged
through center to the Card 37 and
a first down. OSC picked up
another first on the Stanford 29,
and here the Beaver drive faltered
and the Indians look over.
No Time Wasted
Stanford wasted no time as the
Indians drove 77 yards in 13 plays
for the score. Norman hit for 60
yards in this drive, Dick Bowers,
Robinson, and Burford on the re
ceiving end. Bowers made a fine
leaping catch to give the Cards a
first down on the OSC 20.
Then Wylie and N'orman alter
nated on the runs to give the
Cards a first on the Beaver 7.
Then Norman kept and smashed
forward to the four. Norman
called the touchdown play, the
pitchout, and Face started around
end. got a good, block by Wylie
and danced into the end zone for
the score. He converted and the
Indians led, 7-0 with 5:01 left in
the first quarter.
Errol Scott kicked off for the
Indians to the OSC 22, with Earl
Harbin returning to the 3.3, where
he was hit hard by John Bessey,
fumbled and Gil Dowd was right
there to recover for the Tribe.
Turning Point
This was the turning point of
the game. The Indians went right
iti for the score and were not
seriously threatened again.
Norman hit John Bond at the
23 for the first down. Norman
was almost trapped, but slipped
away and tossed to Bond. Dowd
hit tackle for six, Norman kept
for 9, and a Card first on the
OSC nine.
Two passes went incomplete,
boih to Robinson who had trouble
hanging onto the cold pigskin,
but Norman hit Burford on the
three and from there it was Face
on the pitchout at right end for
the score.
Again Face kicked the point
after and the Indians led 14-0,
with two minutes left in the first
period of play. And the Cards
were long gone.
Stanford kicked off and held
the Beavers for four downs and
the OSC had to punt. The Cards
had their hands on the pigskin
again and were on their way. On
the second play, Wylie darted off
left tackle for a first down on
the Stanford 34.
Norman passed to McMillan on
the OSC 40, where Bowers wiped
