Lindores put 1 he ball past his own
goalie early in the second quarter
to knot the score at 1-1.
Right outside Rune Engebrett
sen, back in the Stanford line up
after a week's absence, scored next

with the aid of a perfect pass from

cleared the goalie's head and wenl
into the nets with only four min
utes left in the half.
The third quarter was scoreless,
but State's Bob Meyers closed the
gap to 3-2 early in the fourth pe

emerged from a melee in front of
the goal and scored. Dick Bait let)
ended the scoring when he re
ceived Wolfgang Storch's pass
and tapped the ball in with twenty
seconds left in the game.

play of goalie Dick Voake, who

fullback Dan Farthing, who
played despite an injury, half
backs Henry Vierra, and Rusty
Williams, and inside Bernie
Knaggs.
Stanford defeated the San Jose
Spartan soccer team 5-2 at San
Jose last Saturday, in weather
conditions that would make a
Eskimo wince.
The temperature was under the
50 mark, and the players in their
shorts and T-shirts were unbear
ably cold, but they turned their
best game of the 1959 season.
The victory assured the Indians
of a first division berth in the
Western Soccer League. USF
clinched the league championship
with a victory over California.
San Jose opened the scoring
with just ten seconds left in the
first quarter on Joe Battaglini's
perfect shot. The Spartans scored
next, but unfortunately for them,
it was for Stanford. Fullback Colin
Lindores put 1 he ball past his own
goalie early in the second quarter
to knot the score at 1-1.
