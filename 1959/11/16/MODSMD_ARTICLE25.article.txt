# Beaver in Big Northern Hunt
## Daily Sports 
### 
out a would-be tackier and it was
first and ten to go on the OSC
33. Norman kept for four, and
passed to Bowers at the 25.
Bowers cut back inside and drove
forward to the 19. And then the
Indians railed the pitchout play
again.
The only difference this time
was that it was McMillen with
the ball. McMillen took the ball
on the 20 .went wide around right
end, got good blocks from Bur
lord and Wylie, and drove in for
the score. McMillen was hit hard
on the eight yard line by Kasso,
but kept his feet and tightroped
down the sideline and into the
end zone.
Face split the uprights and the
Indians led, 21-0. Then on the
kickoff, the crowd of some 10,000
was electrified by an 85 yard
kickoff return by OSC speedster
Ron Miller.
85 Yards
The fleet Miller hauled in
Face's kickoff on the 15. sprinted
up the middle, cut over to the
right sideline at the OSC 40, and
outdistanced the Indians to the
goal line. Dowd had the last shot
at the flashy halfback, but could
not grab him and the Beavers
had their first score of the after
noon.
The try for the extra point
failed and the Indians had a 21-6
halftime lead.
Many Guns
After the halftime ceremonies,
which included a many gun salute
for Governor Rockefeller, the In

dians went back to work. After
an exchange of punts, the Cards
drove to the OSC nine, but could
not get through for the TD.
Then it was Face's turn again
as the versatile junior split the
posts with a field goal, and the
Cards led it 24-6, with five min
utes left in the third period.
For the first time in the game
the Beavers got rolling, when late
in the third quarter they marched
66 yards in 11 plays, with Kasso
smashing over from the two for
the score. Kasso then ran the
same play for the two point con
version.
And then the Indians got
another break, as an attempted
onside kick failed, and the Cards
had the pigskin on the Beavei;46.
The Tribe went right to work
with Norman hitting Robinson for
19 yards. Norman and Face
rambled through the line eating
up better than five yards at a
crack, and it was Face again for
the TD and the kicked extra point.
Struck Back
But the Beavers struck right
back, going 60 yards in ten plays
for the score with Kasso scoring
his second TD. Miller ran the
conversion for two and the In
dian lead was whittled to nine
points, 31-22.
The Indians wanted to sew this
one up, and sew it up they did,
on a beautiful 57 yard pass play.
Burford went down the sideline
and turned as to catch a hook
pass, but when the defender
moved up, he reeled and raced

| goalward, snared the Norman
! aerial, and zig-zagged into the
j end zone for the final score. Face
: went around end for the PAT on
j his favorite play and the Cards
! had it going away, 39-22.
The Indians suffered no serious
I injuries, except center Chris
! Cottle who banged up a shoulder.
| The game was just what the
| Tribe needed to give them a good
; drive for Big Game.
