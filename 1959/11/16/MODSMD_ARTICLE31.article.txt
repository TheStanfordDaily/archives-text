THE RCARLET LETTER
by Nathaniel " Swift y" Hawthorne
This is a heart-rending storv of a humble Xcw England lass
named Hester Prynne who is so poor that she does not have
what to eat nor a roof to cover her head, lint she is a brave,
brawny girl and she never complains, and by and by her
patience is rewarded: in the summer of 1859 she wins a football
scholarship to Alabama.
Hard-working Hester soon wins her letter and everyone says
she is a shoo-in for All-Conference honors, but along comes the
War Between the States and football, alas, is dropped for the
duration.

Poor Hester goes back to New England. It is a bitter cold
winter and poor 1 Tester, alas, does not have any warm clothing
except for her football sweater from Alabama, but that, alas,
lias a big searlet "A" on the front of it and she can hardly wear
such a thing in New England where Union sentiment runs so
high.
Poor Hester, alas, freezes to death.
LITTLE WOVEN
by Louisa May "Bubbles" Alcott
The Marches are a very happy family—and for no discernible
reason. They are poor as snakes; they work from cockcrow to
evensong; their dear old father Philip is away with the Union
armies; and they can't do a thing with their hair.
Still, nothing can dampen the spirits of madcap Meg, jocular
Jo, buoyant Beth, animated Amy, and crazy old Marmee, as
the merry March girls laughingly call their lovable mother.
Well sir, one Christmas the March girls get an invitation to a
ball. They are dying to so because they never have any fun at
.-ill except maybe a few chuckles during the hog-rendering
season. Hut Beth reminds her sisters that they can hardly go
traipsing off to a ball and leave poor Marmee nil alone at
Christmas time. The sisters swear a lot, but they finally agree
with Beth.
Marmee, however, will not hear of it. "Land's sakes, little
women!" she cries. "You must go to the ball and have some
fun. There will be fruit punch and Toll House cookies and
Early American sandwiches. Best of all, there will be morris
dancing. Oh, how your father and T used to love that!"
"I never knew father could dance," cries Meg.
"Oh yeah?" cries Marmee. "You should have seen Philip
morris."
"Was Philip a good morriser?" cries .To.
"The best!" cries Marmee. "Philip could morris in soft pack
or flip-top box and was full of fine, fresh, natural mildness!"
The iiirls are cheered to hear this and go to the ball. Marmee
stays home alone, but soon gets a wonderful surprise: Philip
comes back from the war!
When the uirls return from tie ball, they find Marmee and
Philip morrising, and they cry "Iluzzah!" and throw their poke
bonnets in the air, where they are to this day.
• • •
And speaking of literature, in nnr hnnk the best selection of
cigarettes nn the market today comes from Philip Morris
Inc.—Marlboro filters; new AI pines, high filtration and light
menthol-and, of course, mild, un/iltered Philip Morris.

Marmee, however, will not hear of it. "Land's sakes, little
women!" she cries. "You must go to the ball and have some
fun. There will be fruit punch and Toll House cookies and
Early American sandwiches. Best of all, there will be morris
dancing. Oh, how your father and T used to love that!"
"I never knew father could dance," cries Meg.
"Oh yeah?" cries Marmee. "You should have seen Philip
morris."
"Was Philip a good morriser?" cries .To.
"The best!" cries Marmee. "Philip could morris in soft pack
or flip-top box and was full of fine, fresh, natural mildness!"
The iiirls are cheered to hear this and go to the ball. Marmee
stays home alone, but soon gets a wonderful surprise: Philip
comes back from the war!
When the uirls return from tie ball, they find Marmee and
Philip morrising, and they cry "Iluzzah!" and throw their poke
bonnets in the air, where they are to this day.

Today, as a service to students of American literature, tliis
column presents digests of two classic American novels:
THE RCARLET LETTER
by Nathaniel " Swift y" Hawthorne
This is a heart-rending storv of a humble Xcw England lass
named Hester Prynne who is so poor that she does not have
what to eat nor a roof to cover her head, lint she is a brave,
brawny girl and she never complains, and by and by her
patience is rewarded: in the summer of 1859 she wins a football
scholarship to Alabama.
Hard-working Hester soon wins her letter and everyone says
she is a shoo-in for All-Conference honors, but along comes the
War Between the States and football, alas, is dropped for the
duration.

Poor Hester goes back to New England. It is a bitter cold
winter and poor 1 Tester, alas, does not have any warm clothing
except for her football sweater from Alabama, but that, alas,
lias a big searlet "A" on the front of it and she can hardly wear
such a thing in New England where Union sentiment runs so
high.
Poor Hester, alas, freezes to death.
LITTLE WOVEN
by Louisa May "Bubbles" Alcott
The Marches are a very happy family—and for no discernible
reason. They are poor as snakes; they work from cockcrow to
evensong; their dear old father Philip is away with the Union
armies; and they can't do a thing with their hair.
Still, nothing can dampen the spirits of madcap Meg, jocular
Jo, buoyant Beth, animated Amy, and crazy old Marmee, as
the merry March girls laughingly call their lovable mother.
Well sir, one Christmas the March girls get an invitation to a
ball. They are dying to so because they never have any fun at
.-ill except maybe a few chuckles during the hog-rendering
season. Hut Beth reminds her sisters that they can hardly go
traipsing off to a ball and leave poor Marmee nil alone at
Christmas time. The sisters swear a lot, but they finally agree
with Beth.
Marmee, however, will not hear of it. "Land's sakes, little
women!" she cries. "You must go to the ball and have some
fun. There will be fruit punch and Toll House cookies and
