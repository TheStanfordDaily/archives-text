# Buildings Reflect Feelings Of Their Era, Architect Says
## 
### Patricia Falk 
"Architecture expresses history
probably more directly than any
of the other arts," said Sir George
Trevelyan at the opening of his
lecture. "Architectural Style as a
Key to History," given Friday
night at Cubberly Auditorium.
The distinguished educator, his
torian and architectural expert
spoke to a full auditorium, supple
menting his talk with slides of
interiors and exteriors from all
periods.
I'owers of Imagination
Asking his audience to use their
powers of imagination, he told
them to attempt the conception
of the spirit that moves men to
express themselves architectur
ally.
The feeling of an age is captured
by the buildings of that age in a
permanent form, and the aca
demic approach is. therefore, not
as important to the study of achi
tecture as allied to history as is
expression.
To Trevelyan t he evolution of
architectural style is an organic
and a living thing, changing and
metomorphisizing constantly.
Culture's Spirit
Basically, the spirit of a cult urn
is demonstrated in the horizontal
and vertical lines of its buildings,
the horizontal expressing gravity
and concern with the things of the
world, and the vertical expressing
levitation, a search for spiritual
things.
Selecting examples to demon

strate his theory, Trevelyan spoke
briefly on each of the numerous
slides that he showed. Correlating
the poise and serenity of the Par
thenon with the philosophical out
look of the Greeks, he contrasted
it with the heavy, powerful beauty
of the Roman Colliseum as an ex
pression of the military and politi
cal might of Rome.
