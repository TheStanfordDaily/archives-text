Fla., "We are disappointed but
we'll live up to the court's deci
sion. However, we will examine
each individual decision of the
monitors, and those which are
[not constitutionally acceptable to
jus we'll take back to Ihe court
for further consideration."

j challenges of their legal powers
jby Hoffa and the Teamsters.

faster and get this cleanup job
j over with," O'Donoghue told re
