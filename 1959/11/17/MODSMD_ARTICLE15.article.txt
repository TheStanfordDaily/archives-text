"In seeking to fight Russia with H Bombs, we are going to turn
Africa and Asia over to the Communist Camp," stated Arlo Tatum
in his talk last night at the Women's Clubhouse sponsored by the
Socialist Caucus of the Political Union.
Tatum, who is the general secretary of the War Resister's In-

ternational, discussed paciiist
movements in European countries
and Ihc United States. "The most
active peace movement of inde
pendent variety," he asserted, "is
in Great Britain."
'Living Issue'
Disarmament is a "living issue"
in Britain; as recent demonstra
tions against the building of new
missile bases prove. Britain's
greatest fear is that its American
bases will cause it to be the first
attacked in a conflict between
Russia and the United States. It
does not share the United Slates'
intense emotional fear of Russia.
In spite of active anti-war move
ment, conservative membership is
still increasing in England. "Mac
millan has succeeded in convinc
ing the British people that he has
shown initiative in decreasing
cold war tension," said Tatum.
Algeria Free Someday
Tatum referred to France as
the "embryonic nuclear power"
and admitted that he is prejudiced
against the French because he
doesn't understand their psychol
ogy. "Whatever party is in power,
11 he French hate it."
In the question period that fol
l lowed his talk. Tatum pointed out
j that the money spent on defense
keeps us from solving our most
pressing problem: the state of
the underprivileged countries. The
j only way these countries will bo
I able to increase Ihoir standard of
j living is to go Communist; and
i they will unless we help them.
