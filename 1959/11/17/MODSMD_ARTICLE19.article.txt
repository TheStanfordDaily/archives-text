# Chessman Case Basis of Talk
## 
### 
Caryl Chessman's defense at
torney, George T. Davis, will
speak at San Francisco Slate Col
lege in the main auditorium of the
Creative Arts Building on
Wednesday at noon.
His topic will be "Is Capital
Punishment Necessary â€” Exhibit
A. The Chessman Case." There
will be a question and answer ses
sion after his talk.
Davis has had a long history as
an attorney at law, starting with
the Mooney case. Mooney was
convicted of a bombing which
killed 11 people on Market Street
in 1916. Davis took the case in
1931 and in 1939 Mooney was re
leased with an unconditional par
don.
Davis also handled the case of
the first three Korean turncoats
to return from Red China.
Speaking of the Chessman case,
Davis says they want one of three
things: "Retrial, Release, or Re
moval."
