# Advisory Committee

### 
Tiie President's Student-Faculty Advisory Commiltee on Aca
demic Affairs lias begun its third year of work with a considera
tion of topics for study during the rest of the year.
The President's commiltee is composed of faculty members,
administrators and students. It holds no official powers of action,
but is instead designed as a vehicle of communication among
students, faculty and administration.
A review of last year's committee activities, presented at (lie
opening meeting, indicated one major shortcoming: student mem
bers sometimes made recommendations for changes without suffi
cient background knowledge—in some cases, knowledge which
would have made it apparant that certain of these recommenda
tions would not work.
Partially as a result of this, the committee attempted to outline
this year those problems which it can profitably explore, and then
tried to arrange these into a priority order.
The committee plans to first try to solve communications
problems connected with its work. Since a purpose is to help
bridge the gap between administration and students, there should
be some means of letting students in general know what is being
discussed. The 15 students on the committee will learn much of
Stanford operations, but there are many others who should also
share lliis knowledge.
Proceeding to the "meat" of discussions, the committee plans to
first take up the general question of where the University is
headed. A study recently presented to the Hoard of Trustees asks
and answers certain questions relating to the Stanford of 1965
and 1970.
In this area is the problem of admissions. W hat kind of indi
viduals does Stanford plan to accept in the next ten years? And
will the academic program envisioned be consistent with this type
of student?
This question leads to another: the role of Stanford in higher
education and the problem of whether or not the University
atmosphere is too intellectual when related to the need to prepare
students for adult life.
The general studies program, now in its fourth full year of
operation, will also come under scrutiny. Within this are ques
tions on expansion of honors programs, developments in advanced
placement, and possible conflicts between independent study and
general studies requirements.
Students indicated dissatisfaction with the present advisor
system: some claimed that graduate students conducting honors
program course work are too inexperienced to make such work
meaningful. These may be investigated.
The continuing problem of University housing was raised.
\\ hat is the role of the faculty? Should four-year integration be
started? \\ hat are the physical facilities needed to realize a well
rounded housing set-up?
There were other questions and topics raised by students for
possible consideration. Probably enough suggestions materialized
to keep the President's committee busy for several years.
hen the committee meets again November 30 to begin taking
up these problems, we believe it will face the opportunitv to let
students know something about just what goes on at Stanford.
We hope student members and students in general will view
the committee as a means of finding out more about what goes
on here. Too often, we believe, students have expected such a
committee to make over the University to the students' desires,
and have been disappointed when this doesn't happen.
There may be areas where student suggestions can be imme
diately incorporated into University operations—such was the
case with an investigation of library hours last year.
But, again, for students to expect to make over the University
through what is strictly an advisory committee will work against
the major purposes of the group.
Such a committee can serve a worthwhile purpose, particularly
in communications —we anticipate that its members this vear will
allow it to do so.
