Use Reactionary'
Editor, Tin* Daily:
If Michael Soul 6, in his article
of last Friday, has used the word
"reactionary" in place of "con
servative," or replaced it with a
word moaning "blind devotion to
the status quo," his writing might
have had some meaning.
But he committed the same sin
he attributes to conservatives â€”
that of not learning "a damn
thing" from history. If he had
approached the question of "What
is a conservative?" with an open
mind, he would have found that
conservatism does not equal re
action, any more than liberals
can be dismissed as communistic,
left-wing radicals.
A neat summation of the gen
eral conservative stand from the
pen of Dave Long appeared in The
Daily on Nov. 6. I recommend
this article to Mr. Soule if he is
sincerely interested in looking for
the meaning of conservatism.
However, I am constrained to

admit that Mr. Soule has come
upon a grain of truth when he
acknowledges "anarchy and con
fusion would result if . . . idealism
. . . were allowed to romp unfet
ted." It is not the romping most
conservatives are against, but the
lack of fetters.
Also, I am delighted at the in
clusion of Washington, Jefferson,
and Madison in the ranks of lib
eralism. Are their ideals, then,
the same as those of present day
liberals? Or, if they are not, is it
possible that liberals are claim
ing a tradition for this country
that does not, in fact, exist?
One closing observation: I
thought it was the so-called "pro
gressive" or "liberal" schools (led
by the disciples of John Dewey)
that replaced science and history
with home economics and driver
training in the first place.
Do you suppose all those re
actionary conservatives who re
jected the teachings of the great
Dewey were right all along?
