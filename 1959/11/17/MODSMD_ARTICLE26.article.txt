Dwight Eisenhower is climax
ing his eight years in office dif
ferently than anybody expected
when he undertook a second term,
fie is working longer and
harder. He is applying his en
ergies more exactingly, is a
fuller participant in the de
velopment of policy than many
believed likely. He is sparing
himself less than lie himself
forecast.
He is initiating and carrying
through an ambitious venture in
personal diplomacy which, in the

end, will make Franklin Roosevelt
and Woodrow Wilson look like
stay-at-homes.
In his nine-nation December
trip to Europe, the Middle East,
Africa, and Asia, he is, at no
small risk, expanding his
strength, not acting to hoard it.
He is maintaining, even in
creasing, his standing with the
American people and his au
thority with Congress, despite
the no-third-term amendment
and despite his part's losing
three consecutive and ever
larger Congressional defeats.
There are many who figured
that, all things considered, Mr.
Eisenhower would be spending a
good part of his last twelve
months packing his bags and rest
lessly marking time until ho could
escape to retirement.
Mr. Eisenhower may bo pining
to retire, but is doing the opposite
of marking time. He may be pack
ing his bags, but not to go to
Gettysburg; rather to go to Rabat,
Athens, Istanbul, Delhi, Kabul,
Teheran, Rome, Paris, Moscow,
and points east.
For the next twelve months
Mr. Eisenhower is going to be
doing what he most wants to
do, what he deeply believes he
would remiss if he didn't do —
namely, use the vast prestige of
the Presidency and the accumu
lated trust and goodwill, which
leaders and people on both sides
of the iron curtain have in him,
in a major new effort to cut
back the cold war in a way that
will strengthen, not weaken, the
cause of freedom.
This means that, far from let
ting his administration in its final
months wane and wither, the
President is dedicating it to a
mission which he hopes may be
its best achievement.
In the nineteen day trip he is
about to make, the President's
visit to India may prove most
significant of all.
It couldn't come at a better
moment.
For the past t<'ii years Prime
Minister Nehru has, with sin
cerity and forbearance, sought
to stand as a friend of Com
munist China, thrusting its
promises of peaceful co-exist
ence and turning the other way
when it abetted the war in
Indochina and crushed neigh
boring Tibet.
Rut now Chinese Communist
troops, after earlier intrusion
into Indian territory, have in

vaded northeastern Kashmir, at
tacking Indian border patrols,
killing nine and capturing five.
Mr. Nehru is face to face with
a difficult, anxious, and grim de
cision. Will he try to defend In
dian sovereignty with military
forces inferior lo those of Red
China in the hope that Poiping
will back down?
Will be affront educated In
dian opinion and risk losing his
grip on the Indian masses by
capitulating to the Communist
demands? Will be cast aside
the policy of neutrality as out
dated and inadequate and in
vite assistance from the West?
These are hard and harsh al
ternatives. It is not for us to
judge what is best for India. We
shouldn't forget that we were still
stalking about our isolation be
hind two oceans when the fleet
was sunk at Pearl Harbor. We
must not press our collective
security upon India, but we
should be ready and willing.
No one could have better
credentials to counsel with —if
not counsel —Mr. Nehru than
President Eisenhower.
He is going to Delhi at a crucial
hour in history. At stake is Mr.
Nehru's leadership of India. At
stake also is Premier Khru
shchev's leadership of the Com
munist bloc because Mr. Khru
shchev cannot remain simultane
ously an ally of Red Chinese
aggression and of the cause of
ending the cold war. He also
must choose.

Indochina and crushed neigh

forces inferior lo those of Red
China in the hope that Poiping

dian opinion and risk losing his

capitulating to the Communist

the policy of neutrality as out
dated and inadequate and in

These are hard and harsh al

judge what is best for India. We
shouldn't forget that we were still

Dwight Eisenhower is climax
ing his eight years in office dif
ferently than anybody expected
when he undertook a second term,
fie is working longer and
harder. He is applying his en
ergies more exactingly, is a
fuller participant in the de
velopment of policy than many
believed likely. He is sparing
himself less than lie himself
forecast.
He is initiating and carrying
through an ambitious venture in
personal diplomacy which, in the

end, will make Franklin Roosevelt
and Woodrow Wilson look like
stay-at-homes.
In his nine-nation December
trip to Europe, the Middle East,
Africa, and Asia, he is, at no
small risk, expanding his
strength, not acting to hoard it.
He is maintaining, even in
creasing, his standing with the
American people and his au
thority with Congress, despite
the no-third-term amendment
and despite his part's losing
three consecutive and ever
larger Congressional defeats.
There are many who figured
that, all things considered, Mr.
Eisenhower would be spending a
good part of his last twelve
months packing his bags and rest
lessly marking time until ho could
escape to retirement.
Mr. Eisenhower may bo pining
to retire, but is doing the opposite
of marking time. He may be pack
ing his bags, but not to go to
Gettysburg; rather to go to Rabat,
Athens, Istanbul, Delhi, Kabul,
Teheran, Rome, Paris, Moscow,
and points east.
For the next twelve months
Mr. Eisenhower is going to be
doing what he most wants to
do, what he deeply believes he
would remiss if he didn't do —
namely, use the vast prestige of
the Presidency and the accumu
lated trust and goodwill, which
leaders and people on both sides
of the iron curtain have in him,
in a major new effort to cut
back the cold war in a way that
will strengthen, not weaken, the
cause of freedom.
This means that, far from let

end, will make Franklin Roosevelt
and Woodrow Wilson look like
stay-at-homes.
In his nine-nation December
trip to Europe, the Middle East,
Africa, and Asia, he is, at no
small risk, expanding his
strength, not acting to hoard it.
He is maintaining, even in
creasing, his standing with the
American people and his au
thority with Congress, despite
the no-third-term amendment
and despite his part's losing
three consecutive and ever
larger Congressional defeats.
There are many who figured
that, all things considered, Mr.
Eisenhower would be spending a
good part of his last twelve
months packing his bags and rest
lessly marking time until ho could
escape to retirement.
Mr. Eisenhower may bo pining
to retire, but is doing the opposite
of marking time. He may be pack
ing his bags, but not to go to
Gettysburg; rather to go to Rabat,
Athens, Istanbul, Delhi, Kabul,
Teheran, Rome, Paris, Moscow,
and points east.
For the next twelve months
Mr. Eisenhower is going to be
doing what he most wants to
do, what he deeply believes he
would remiss if he didn't do —
namely, use the vast prestige of
the Presidency and the accumu
lated trust and goodwill, which
leaders and people on both sides
of the iron curtain have in him,
in a major new effort to cut
back the cold war in a way that
will strengthen, not weaken, the
cause of freedom.
This means that, far from let
ting his administration in its final
months wane and wither, the
President is dedicating it to a
mission which he hopes may be
its best achievement.
In the nineteen day trip he is
about to make, the President's
visit to India may prove most
significant of all.
It couldn't come at a better
moment.
For the past t<'ii years Prime
Minister Nehru has, with sin
cerity and forbearance, sought
to stand as a friend of Com
munist China, thrusting its
promises of peaceful co-exist
ence and turning the other way
when it abetted the war in
Indochina and crushed neigh
boring Tibet.
Rut now Chinese Communist
troops, after earlier intrusion
into Indian territory, have in

vaded northeastern Kashmir, at
tacking Indian border patrols,
killing nine and capturing five.
Mr. Nehru is face to face with
a difficult, anxious, and grim de
cision. Will he try to defend In
dian sovereignty with military
forces inferior lo those of Red
China in the hope that Poiping
will back down?
Will be affront educated In
dian opinion and risk losing his
grip on the Indian masses by
capitulating to the Communist
demands? Will be cast aside
the policy of neutrality as out
dated and inadequate and in
vite assistance from the West?
These are hard and harsh al
ternatives. It is not for us to
judge what is best for India. We
shouldn't forget that we were still
stalking about our isolation be
hind two oceans when the fleet
was sunk at Pearl Harbor. We
must not press our collective
security upon India, but we
should be ready and willing.
No one could have better
credentials to counsel with —if
not counsel —Mr. Nehru than
President Eisenhower.
He is going to Delhi at a crucial
hour in history. At stake is Mr.
Nehru's leadership of India. At
stake also is Premier Khru
shchev's leadership of the Com
munist bloc because Mr. Khru
shchev cannot remain simultane
ously an ally of Red Chinese
aggression and of the cause of
ending the cold war. He also
must choose.
