to take manpower cuts under the
new budget. He added that the i
Navy's second nuclear-powered

The White House announced
that Dr. T. Keith Glennon, head
of the National Aeronautics and
Space Agency, will confer with
Eisenhower this morning.
NASA has been put in charge
of the Saturn Project to develop
a rocketry system capable of get
ting a man into space. There have
been reports that the project may
be slowed down.
This year's military budget calls
for expenditures just short of -41
billion dollars, out of a budget of
79 billion. Speaking of the defense
portion, McElroy said: "It's going
to be very difficult to find a
budget level any lower than the
present spending level."
