... Is that there are only 20
more clays till finals.
However, there is one group of
courses which ordinarily does not
bring 1o mind visions of two to
four-hours of frantic pen-push
ing. These are the senior collo
quia.
Recently the Legislature in
structed its Academic Affairs
committee to search into possibili
ties of allowing B.S. candidates
greater freedom to take colloquia.
Meanwhile the suggestion of a
discussion of the colloquia re
quirement illicited only groans
from one group of women stu
dents at Lagunita.
Why the groans? And why
did 80 per cent of the women in
one rasa of Lagunita vote that
the colloquia requirement be
abolished? What are their
complaints? For example: The
discussion are unorganized and
poorly handled. The professor
lectures too much. The pro
fessor expects too much back
ground in the subject matter.
The subjects are poorly chosen.
Most of the women agree that
! the idea of a discussion group is
j desirable. But probably more
than half can cite unprofitable
experiences with colloquia for
! 1 ho above or other reasons.
The thought behind the re
quirement, as espoused by the
General Studies committee, is to
give students a chance, before
they have to leave the academic
atmosphere, to put together what
| they have learned in three-plus
I years and discuss it in terms of

some far-reaching concept, with
an expert in the field.
That the students are not in
the department of the colloquium
sometimes makes it difficult for
the professor to plan the course
of discussion. He is ordinarily
thoroughly familiar with the sub
ject matter. A superficial survey
is not desirable, so he either loads
on the reading or, as in ihe com
plaint, expects too much back
ground from the student initially.
The handling of discussions is
another problem. Some professors
lecture beautifully but cannot
lead a discussion, and the other
way around. Some professors
don't want to conduct colloquia
at all; subtle, or not so subtle,
pressures are brought to bear
on them.
The selection of subjects is
gradually being improved as
are colloquia titles, which some
time give no indication of the
quality of the colloquia. Stu
dents are learning to select
colloquia according to profes
sor.
far, all the blame for the
lack of stimulation in colloquia
seems to fall upon Ihe professor.
But how many students, many of
whom have attended only lecture
courses at Stanford, know how to
conduct themselves in a discus
sion group?
The professor who experiences
a closed-mouth group wants to
do something to get the ideas
across to the class. If they won't
talk, he will.
Colloquia are not designed to
be bull sessions among stu
dents; they are meant to have
direction; but neither are they
to be question and answer ses
sions.
It is unfortunale that the initial
requirement was two instead of
one colloquia. One required would
have allowed more time for pro
fessors and students to get used
to the idea (though colloquia
were offered last year to seniors).
This would also have given the
student more choice and eliminate
overcrowding and the rush for
certain colloquia. (Some are re
ported this quarter to have 20
or more students.) However, red
tape being what it is, a change
now of this type would be next
to impossible, if desirable.
As the Scratch Sheet is to be
come a more or less permanent
campus publication, perhaps as
an occasional supplement it could
"exaluate" the various colloquia,
if not the specific subjects, the
professors.

It is unfortunale that the initial

This would also have given the
student more choice and eliminate

lectures too much. The pro

fessor expects too much back
ground in the subject matter.
The subjects are poorly chosen.
Most of the women agree that
! the idea of a discussion group is
j desirable. But probably more
than half can cite unprofitable
experiences with colloquia for
! 1 ho above or other reasons.
The thought behind the re
quirement, as espoused by the
General Studies committee, is to
give students a chance, before
they have to leave the academic
atmosphere, to put together what
| they have learned in three-plus
I years and discuss it in terms of

some far-reaching concept, with
an expert in the field.
That the students are not in
the department of the colloquium
sometimes makes it difficult for
the professor to plan the course
of discussion. He is ordinarily
thoroughly familiar with the sub
ject matter. A superficial survey
is not desirable, so he either loads
on the reading or, as in ihe com
plaint, expects too much back
ground from the student initially.
The handling of discussions is
another problem. Some professors
lecture beautifully but cannot
lead a discussion, and the other
way around. Some professors
don't want to conduct colloquia
at all; subtle, or not so subtle,
pressures are brought to bear
on them.
The selection of subjects is
gradually being improved as
are colloquia titles, which some
time give no indication of the
quality of the colloquia. Stu
dents are learning to select
colloquia according to profes
sor.
far, all the blame for the
lack of stimulation in colloquia
seems to fall upon Ihe professor.
But how many students, many of
whom have attended only lecture
courses at Stanford, know how to
conduct themselves in a discus
sion group?
The professor who experiences
a closed-mouth group wants to
do something to get the ideas
across to the class. If they won't
talk, he will.
Colloquia are not designed to
be bull sessions among stu
dents; they are meant to have
direction; but neither are they
to be question and answer ses
sions.
It is unfortunale that the initial
requirement was two instead of
one colloquia. One required would
have allowed more time for pro
fessors and students to get used
to the idea (though colloquia
were offered last year to seniors).
This would also have given the
student more choice and eliminate
overcrowding and the rush for
certain colloquia. (Some are re
ported this quarter to have 20
or more students.) However, red
tape being what it is, a change
now of this type would be next
to impossible, if desirable.
As the Scratch Sheet is to be
come a more or less permanent
campus publication, perhaps as
an occasional supplement it could
"exaluate" the various colloquia,
if not the specific subjects, the
professors.
