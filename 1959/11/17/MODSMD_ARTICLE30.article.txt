Kiss-Off Week Kevins
It's here at last .... Bij; Game Week! Although certain San
Francisco sportswriters and disgruntled fans are claiming that
neither Stanford or C'al deserves to win next Saturday's grid classic,
students, players and fans of (he two Bay Area schools are gradually
getting worked up for probably the most exciting football game
and social weekend in the nation.
Certainly after the Cards fine showing against OSC, this writer
must favor the Old Home Squad figuring that seniors Hen Robin
son, Chris Bui-lord, Dick Bowers, Phil Burkland, etc., quarterback
Dick Norman and halfback Skip Face will be up for the Bears and

will continue their good play tor
the season's finale. However, of
course the Bi£ One is always close
and to use that worn expression,
"Anything can happen in the Big
Game."
As students make plans for
house decorations, overnights,
parties or writing that term
paper while everyone else is away
and the cheerleaders, under the
able leadership of Bill Kartozian,
plan their last stunts and cheers
for the year, the Rally Com
headed by Ed White is busy work
ing overtime to get their Rally
and Card stunts ready before the
Friday night deadline.
Most students - unless they
have had the "urge to serve"—
don't realize all the work it takes
to present a rally and halftime
show and the Rally Com, even
though they get a lot of "prestige"
plus have a lot of fun, put in a
great deal of effort to make the
Game as colorful, if not more
so, than in the Games gone by.

This year's halftime shows have boon handled exeeptionally well
and have provided Stanford grid fans that needed color to help Ihe
situation out when things aren't going too well for the players on
the field. Certainly Kd and his committee deserve a pat on the back
for a job well done. The general new look this season resulted from
the Hand under Harvie Hnndt's supervision, with ex-Daily sports edi
tor Steve Batfrey coordinating the whole show from behind the mike
in the Indian pressbox.
The Biggest Critic Section
Of course the Big Game is the most important job for the Rally
Com for 110 matter how the teams have done in the season 90,000
fans will file into the stands to view the action and so the halftime
show will have its biggest critic section of the year. Chairman White
related that his show and rally—which Steve Webster heads—takes
two weeks of work, plus a lot of pre-season planning. It also involves
meeting with Cal student leaders to try to agree on those famous
"non-agression pacts" which never seem to work out. Finally there is
that tedious stamping assignments for the Card section which Bob
Twist supervises. s 4 .
When pressed for comments about how his job lias gone this
year, White remarked that he thought that except for a few isolated
cases that student cooperation has been the best that he has ex
perienced in his four years at the Farm. After an early problem
with the Athletic Department selling the top five rows of the Card
section to season ticket holders—which assistance athletic director
Chuck Taylor assures will be remedied in future years—the year
has gone quite well.
When asked whether he though! that the fact that the Card's
are having another losing season has effected attendance any at the
rallies yes, there are those who atlend and in the card section, Ed
believed that there has been no change and also he hasn't had that
problem which caused a lot of uproar last year—rooters leaving the
cheering section after the third quarter ended.
Passing Show Crowd Pleasing
Certainly the fine passing show of Norman to Burford, Robinson,
Bond or Bovvers which still leads the nation has kept most of the
fans interested in Stanford football even though the Card defense
may rank the worst in Stanford history this year.
No one can explain why the Cal and Stanford stadiums fill up
year after year for the lii«- One. Perhaps it is the close series
between Cal and the Tribe with the Bears leading by one game now.
Maybe it is because the ballplayers are always up for the contest
and although perhaps football purists are right in that the best
football won't be seen in the Stanford Stadium, at least it will be
exciting. Quite possibly the reason for big crowds could be all the
traditions of the long series and sectional rivalry the Axe, etc.
and certainly the Rally Com does its best to holdup this theory with
promoting a fine rally and good cheering section for the game. So
at least Stanford rooters will always have a colorful show at the
end of the grid season win or lose.
