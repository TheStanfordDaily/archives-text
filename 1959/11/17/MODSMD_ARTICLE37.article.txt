# Americans Have Gigantic Nest Egg
## 
### 
The American people will go
into the decade of the 1960's with
$300 billion in accumulated long
term savings in life insurance
and other mediums of thrift, the
Institute of Life Insurance re
ported recently.
This vast sum represents indi
vidual "nest eggs" which "add to
the protection of the individual
and family, and increase their
sense of financial security."
But more important, the Insti
tute said, these savings perform
two other basic functions in re
spect to the economy as a whole.
The uninterrupted growth in
investments in insurance helps
greatly in increasing and balanc
ing capital formation. It also
serves as a potent weapon in anti
inflation and stabilization of buy
ing power, the Institute report
concluded.
