# FAKE LICENSES
## 16 Students Placed on Probation 
### 
Sixteen sophomores involved in
the faking of drivers' licenses
were placed on probation yester
day according to Dean of Men
William Craig. Further action
awaits a report by an investigat
ing agent of the State Department
of Motor Vehicles.
Probation means that the stu
dents will be expelled if any ques
tion of conduct should arise in
their remaining years at the Uni
versity.
Violation of State Law
The principal figure is George
A. Burkhardt, who allegedly
faked the licenses for the other
students. He was charged by the
State Department of Motor Ve
hicles with violating a state law
which prohibits false reproduc
tion of automobile operators'
licenses. The charge was filed in
the Palo Alto-Mountain View
Municipal Court.
Craig emphasized that the case
is still unfinished and that he is
currently waiting for the investi
gator's report. The case has not
been referred to Men's Council as
yet, he said.
A motor vehicle spokesman
said Burkhardt prepared forged
licenses with fake ages on trans
parent paper, photographed them
and sold them for from $1 to $5
each.
Four Licenses Recovered
Four of the false licenses have
been recovered, the spokesman
said, and the remainder were re
ported as destroyed by the stu
dents involved. He said the li
censes ranged from "crude" to
"pretty good" in quality.
Burkhardt reportedly told in
vestigators he prepared the li
censes to raise funds to meet
some personal obligations.
