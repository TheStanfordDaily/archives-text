# Chappies on Sale, Maybe
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
Because the Daily feels that
some news value does accrue to
nearly every happening on Quad,
we unhestitatingly announce that
the Stanford Chaparral will
probably be on sale today on
the corners of Quad.
II is a sad note to add to the
history of free, unbiased report
ing that the publishers of the
Chappie refuse to allow this re
viewer to see an advance copy of
their magazine, even in the in
terest of service to the consum
ing public.
Possible Reasons
There are only two reasons why
this should be done: <a> the last
devastating review from this
typewriter so neatly and cleverly
cut the heart of the last issue of
the humor mag that circulation
was greatly diminished; (b) the
copies to hit the stands tomorrow
are of such inferior quality to
even the Old Boy's previous ef
forts thai he is ashamed to lay
it open to comment in a respon
sible publication.
From the covers of the annual

I Big Game Edition which herald
j the Chaparral's sale around Quad,
jit is at least evident that the myth
of the "four professors" has been
! publicly exploded at last.
All tin' Professors
All of the professors appear on
; this issue's cover (as well as the
I third Foreign Legionnaire), thus
! explaining why it was possible
i for this same small group to hit
i the mark with their biting com
ments for these many years.
Additional thought: Is il possi
ble that no copy is available to
j the Daily because no copy will
I actually appear on the stands
today? Stanford may be the vic
tim of a hoax—an idea so akin to
the diabolic thoughts of the little
men of the Chaparral that we
•shudder to think of it.
But even though the Chappie
! is ornery and doesn't want a re
view, there is another fine pub
| lication coming out today that we
would rather review anyway, it
is the 1959 Frosh Book.
The Frosh Book is published
by the Quad staff, and they have
done a good job this year.

Some of the photography is
very good, and almost all of the
material is excellent, though
there isn't much in the first 1G
pages. However, Ashley Reed,
pictured on page 22. is outstand
ing. This reviewer also recom
mends Ann Mitchell, page 22. and
Toni Williamson, page 23.
limnncr Too
Meanwhile, back at Branner,
Charlotte Averill on page 18 and
Susan Laughlin, pictured on page
19, are top candidates. Kim Koch,
page 18. is also outstanding (she's
from Hawaii too).
The Frosh Book will be on sale
at the Quad Office between J) a.m.
and noon and between 1 and 5
p.m. today and tomorrow. The
price is $1.50.
But if you are a freshman and
still are interested in the Chap
pic. then this reviewer suggests
that you buy a copy, because,
when you are a junior or senior,
you can look back and say, "(Ice
but the Chappie used to be good."
The Chappie will be sold for 35
cents each at tables on all four
corners of Quad, the Cellar and
the Post Office.

is the 1959 Frosh Book.
The Frosh Book is published
by the Quad staff, and they have
done a good job this year.

Some of the photography is
very good, and almost all of the
material is excellent, though
there isn't much in the first 1G
pages. However, Ashley Reed,
pictured on page 22. is outstand
ing. This reviewer also recom
mends Ann Mitchell, page 22. and
Toni Williamson, page 23.
limnncr Too
Meanwhile, back at Branner,
Charlotte Averill on page 18 and
Susan Laughlin, pictured on page
19, are top candidates. Kim Koch,
page 18. is also outstanding (she's
from Hawaii too).
The Frosh Book will be on sale
at the Quad Office between J) a.m.
and noon and between 1 and 5
p.m. today and tomorrow. The
price is $1.50.
But if you are a freshman and
still are interested in the Chap
pic. then this reviewer suggests
that you buy a copy, because,
when you are a junior or senior,
you can look back and say, "(Ice
but the Chappie used to be good."
The Chappie will be sold for 35
cents each at tables on all four
corners of Quad, the Cellar and
the Post Office.
Because the Daily feels that
some news value does accrue to
nearly every happening on Quad,
we unhestitatingly announce that
the Stanford Chaparral will
probably be on sale today on
the corners of Quad.
II is a sad note to add to the
history of free, unbiased report
ing that the publishers of the
Chappie refuse to allow this re
viewer to see an advance copy of
their magazine, even in the in
terest of service to the consum
ing public.
Possible Reasons
There are only two reasons why
this should be done: <a> the last
devastating review from this
typewriter so neatly and cleverly
cut the heart of the last issue of
the humor mag that circulation
was greatly diminished; (b) the
copies to hit the stands tomorrow
are of such inferior quality to
even the Old Boy's previous ef
forts thai he is ashamed to lay
it open to comment in a respon
sible publication.
From the covers of the annual

I Big Game Edition which herald
j the Chaparral's sale around Quad,
jit is at least evident that the myth
of the "four professors" has been
! publicly exploded at last.
All tin' Professors
All of the professors appear on
; this issue's cover (as well as the
I third Foreign Legionnaire), thus
! explaining why it was possible
i for this same small group to hit
i the mark with their biting com
ments for these many years.
Additional thought: Is il possi
ble that no copy is available to
j the Daily because no copy will
I actually appear on the stands
today? Stanford may be the vic
tim of a hoax—an idea so akin to
the diabolic thoughts of the little
men of the Chaparral that we
•shudder to think of it.
But even though the Chappie
! is ornery and doesn't want a re
view, there is another fine pub
| lication coming out today that we
