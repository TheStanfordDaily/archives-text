## Herter: Europeans Must Help 
### 
WASHINGTON (A 3 )â€” Secretary
of State Christian A. Herter told
this country's European Allies
yesterday the time has come for
them to shoulder more of the
burden of aiding underdeveloped
areas.
Herter spoke out on what he
called "this critical area of world
leadership" in a speech before
legislators representing the North
1 Atlantic Treaty Organization
countries.
Fair Share
He pledged the United States
would continue to carry a fair
share of the economic burden
while also providing weapons and
dollars for military defenses
against the Soviet Union.
Ilerter's carefully prepare d
speech foreshadowed a deter
mined campaign by the Eisen
hower administration to persuade
prosperous European nations, as
well as Japan, Canada, Australia
anr New Zealand, to step up sub
stantially their spending in Afri
ca and Asia.
I '/ 4 Billion Dollars
At present, these nations are
giving about VA billion dollars
annually in such help. Ninety per
cent of this, however, goes to
their own overseas territories.
Top administration officials be
lieve these countries could add
perhaps a half a billion dollars
more to such programs without
strain.
Herter avoided naming any
countries he feels could do more.
He also called for continuing
emphasis on joint defense meas
ures until Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev backs up with specif
ic deeds his promises to President
Eisenhower to ease tensions.
