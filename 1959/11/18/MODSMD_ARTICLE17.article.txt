### Rich Sundeen ASSU President 
On this anniversary of the first
Rig Game, it seems appropriate
to make some comment on Home
coming, Big Game, and their re
lationship to the student body.
The year 1917 found Stanford
University's athletic situation at
a low mark. "Athletic relations
with tiie University of Californ
ia were suspended; Rugby foot
ball was the outstanding sport,
and the University of Santa
Clara the most important op
ponent."
The Associated Students were
bankrupt and the Board of
Trustees loaned the Association
$15,000 to pay the outstanding
bills. "The anticipated income
from all athletic sources was less
than $20,000 per year . . ."
During World War I, Stanford
turned its sports over to the Com
manding Officer of the Students'
Army Training Corps. In the fall
of 1918 he directed a game of
American football between Cal's
student team and Stanford's
Army unit. This game was never
considered a contest between the
respective student bodies.
After the war ended, in 1919
sports were resumed and plans
were made to meet the Univers
ity of California again. After
much mediation, tlie two schools
agreed to play a game of Amer
ican football on Nov. 22, 1919.
Thus, the inception of the mod
ern "Big Game" and consequently
one of the most, spirited rivalries
in intercollegiate athletics. And
this year, along with Big Game,
comes Homecoming.
Already, many alumni have re
turned to visit the campus and
see old friends. In a sense they
are reliving "the old davs." As
today's university students who
are rewarded for objective
thought, we many times scoff at

the mention of college memories
or an emotional feeling toward
the past.
Vet, perhaps we can learn
something from our "alums,"
their meinoriable experiences,
and their pride in being a con
tinuing member of the Stanford
Family. We inay tend to say,
"Times have changed, we are
in a new eat —the Sputnik era.
We can only appreciate the
future."
But our alumni have the ability,
from various points along a 67
year perspective, to observe our
university—its students, its fac
ulty, and its institutions and
traditions—and its progress and
setbacks.
In past years our alumni have
watched Stanford grow in stature
and respect within academic cir
les throughout the nation and
world. From their vantage point
the "alums" can watch the path
of our growth and development
toward "the cultivation and en
largement of the mind."
On occasion we have taken
one step backward and two for
ward. Nevertheless, many have
generously rendered their serv
ices toward the fulfillment of
this goal. For this, we are
greatly indebted to all of them.
I hope that as we meet alumni
on our campus throughout this
week, we can more fully apprec
iate their avid spirit for Stanford
University — a spirit emanating
not only from the memories of
the "old college rah-rah days,"
but from the continuity of the
Stanford Family and traditions
embraced in our academic and
social philosophy.
In so doing, perhaps we will
have an insight into why we will
some day be "old grads" inter
ested in the welfare of our Uni
versity.

this year, along with Big Game,
comes Homecoming.
Already, many alumni have re
turned to visit the campus and
see old friends. In a sense they
are reliving "the old davs." As
today's university students who
are rewarded for objective
thought, we many times scoff at

the mention of college memories
or an emotional feeling toward
the past.
Vet, perhaps we can learn
something from our "alums,"
their meinoriable experiences,
and their pride in being a con
tinuing member of the Stanford
Family. We inay tend to say,
"Times have changed, we are
in a new eat —the Sputnik era.
We can only appreciate the
future."
But our alumni have the ability,
from various points along a 67
year perspective, to observe our
university—its students, its fac
ulty, and its institutions and
traditions—and its progress and
setbacks.
In past years our alumni have
watched Stanford grow in stature
and respect within academic cir
les throughout the nation and
world. From their vantage point
the "alums" can watch the path
of our growth and development
toward "the cultivation and en
largement of the mind."
On occasion we have taken
one step backward and two for
ward. Nevertheless, many have
generously rendered their serv
ices toward the fulfillment of
this goal. For this, we are
greatly indebted to all of them.
I hope that as we meet alumni
on our campus throughout this
week, we can more fully apprec
iate their avid spirit for Stanford
University — a spirit emanating
not only from the memories of
the "old college rah-rah days,"
but from the continuity of the
Stanford Family and traditions
embraced in our academic and
social philosophy.
In so doing, perhaps we will
have an insight into why we will
some day be "old grads" inter
ested in the welfare of our Uni
versity.
On this anniversary of the first
Rig Game, it seems appropriate
to make some comment on Home
coming, Big Game, and their re
lationship to the student body.
The year 1917 found Stanford
University's athletic situation at
a low mark. "Athletic relations
with tiie University of Californ
ia were suspended; Rugby foot
ball was the outstanding sport,
and the University of Santa
Clara the most important op
ponent."
The Associated Students were
bankrupt and the Board of
Trustees loaned the Association
$15,000 to pay the outstanding
bills. "The anticipated income
from all athletic sources was less
than $20,000 per year . . ."
During World War I, Stanford
turned its sports over to the Com
manding Officer of the Students'
Army Training Corps. In the fall
of 1918 he directed a game of
American football between Cal's
student team and Stanford's
Army unit. This game was never
considered a contest between the
respective student bodies.
After the war ended, in 1919
sports were resumed and plans
were made to meet the Univers
ity of California again. After
much mediation, tlie two schools
agreed to play a game of Amer
ican football on Nov. 22, 1919.
Thus, the inception of the mod
ern "Big Game" and consequently
one of the most, spirited rivalries
in intercollegiate athletics. And
this year, along with Big Game,
comes Homecoming.
