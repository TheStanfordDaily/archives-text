# Rx Apathy Antidotes
## 
### Mary Lou McKinley 
Although this is the week when
campus apathy hits the yearly
low—when Big Game entertain
ment goes straight, through to
Sunday—there still may be sev
eral hardy souls who will demand
a few more things to do.
For the folk-song enthusiasts
who can tear themselves away
from the pagan flame Friday
night, I)ick Jaqua and Dave
Spence will present "An Eve
ning of Folk Songs" in the Palo
Alto High School Auditorium
at 8:30 p.m.
Spence, who came to the area
from Ireland a year ago. is pres
ently a rocket fuel technician at
SRI and specializes in traditional
songs. Jaqua, a Stanford graduate
who now is studying in the
Speech and Drama Department,
sings more of the straight folk
songs and will be remcmbere-d
for the excellent job he did in
The Stanford Players' production
of "lolanthe" last year. Bolh
singers are currently appearing
at the Pagliacci Playhouse on El
Camino.
Tickets for the Friday show,
which is being sponsored by the
Palo Alto Fair Play Council, may
be obtained from Bruce Anderson
at Los Arcos Club for $1.50.
In San Francisco at The
Lamplighters Theater, 236 Mc-
Allister Street, Gilbert anil Sul
livan's "Patience" will be pre
sented Friday and Saturday at
8:30 p.m.
The production, although rela
tively small (the theater seats
about 50) and with simple scen
ery is nonetheless well done and
very enjoyable—as all Gilbert and
Sullivan shows should be.
Memorable in t he cast is Leona
Guestavino, a riotous comedienne
with a Wagner-scaled voice and
frame to match, who plays the
Lady Jane.
The comic opera concerns a
"fleshy poet," Bunthorne, (writ
ten as a caricature of Oscar
YVHde), who is pursued by a
whole troop of love-sick ladies.
The role is played by Orva Hos
kinson, and some hilarious mo
ments ensue between him and
the "idyllic poet" Grosvenor,
played by 11. Clay Barnard.
Appearing through Saturday at

the Geary Theater, Yves Mont
and, France's popular entertainer
who has just finished a success
ful Broadway run, will give a
program of songs starting at
8:30 p.m. Tickets for the Friday
and Saturday shows run from
$3.20-$5.50 with slightly lower
prices for tonight and tomorrow
night.
Through Dee. (5, t !i<» Lyonel
Feininger Memorial Exhibition
will be on display at the San
Francisco Museum of Art, Vet
erans Building, in the Civic
Center.
The exhibition, the Museum's
major o.ne this fall, consists of 70
oils. 54 water colors, and 12 draw
ings and is the first major Fein
inger showing since his death in
19."56.
Born in New York in 1871,
Feininger spent 49 of his years
in Germany where he started to
paint at the age of 35. Beginning
in musical studies, he turned to
the visual arts and established
himself as an illustrator and car
toonist before devoting his full
time to painting in 1907. The
years from 1937 to the time of his
death Were spent in this country.
A key figure in the advance
of the 20th century modern
movement, Feininger felt that
music, which he always main
tained as a secondary interest,
was the deepest source in his
art. He had a profound belief
in the need for discipline, har
mony and clarity as a means
to the true universality in art,
and was absorbed in the phe
nomenon of light and optical
effects.
In Feninger's paintings the
viewer is challenged to see what
he has looked at before, but often
has not seen. The artist himself
said: "What we see has to go
through a process of transforma
tion and crystallization to become
a picture. I have to destroy na
ture before I can begin to build
her up again in my paintings."
Certainly an exhibition of im
portance and worth, the collection
was organized by the Cleveland
Museum of Art. Student tickets
are priced at 25 cents and the
Museum is open Tuesday-Friday
from noon to 10 p.m. and Satur
day-Monday from 1-6 p.m.
