# FAMED HISTORIAN. AUTHOR. TEACHER
## Guerard Was Versatile Professor 
### Jerry Rankin 
A willingness 1o speak his
mind, a talented, far ranging
pen and a dedication to world
peace through international
government marked the full,
active life led by Stanford's
late professor emeritus Albert
Leon Guerard.
When death claimed him
while he slept in his campus
home last week, Professor
Guerard had achieved fame as
a teacher, historian, author,
philosopher and defender of
free thought.
Throughout his 79 years, the
Paris-born educator was busy
at some project. Ho wrote
scores of books and articles.
Active Retirement
He retired in 1946 as a pro
fessor emeritus of General and
Comparative Literature, but
turned out 12 books, lectured
at several colleges and univers
ties and taught senior seminars
here during the next 13 years.
In one of his autobiographical
sketches, he described himself
as "a Frenchman by birth and
and American by choice, a
teacher of literature by profes
sion, a philosopher and his

torian by inclination, and a
staunch advocate of world gov
ernment by conviction."
In reviewing his autobiogra
phy, "Personal Equation," the
New York Times called him
"one of the most useful citizens
the U.S. has to show." He was
much respected for his clear,
forceful writing.
Wins Praise
Almost without exception, his
literary efforts consistently
were praised as top flight. He
was known as one of the fore
most historians of France. An
article he recently wrote about
Charles de Gaulle is scheduled
for February publication by the
Atlantic Monthly.
His liberalism and advocacy
of free thought were the trade
mark of a man who never
hestitated to express his opin
ions.
"All ideas are to some extent
inevitably subversive. If I am
told that I must be free on the
lines prescribed by the Attorney
General, I can only shrug my
shoulders; this is too absurd to
deserve discussion," he once
wrote.
His free thinking apparently
tied in well with the atmosphere

he found at Stanford. "As long
as 1 have known Stanford it
has been a citadel of freedom,"
he noted.
Professor Guerard was a
member of the select, 2. r)0-mem
ber National Institute of Arts
and Letters, the highest honor
society of arts in the nation.
"If we want peace, we must
achieve it through . . . liberty,
equality, fraternity," he said
in asserting that World War 111
could only be averted by the
formation of an international
government.
His deep belief in such a
united world administration led
to his appointment in 1948 to a
panel of distinguished inter
national who drew up
a draft constitution for a world
government.
Community Interest
A steady writer of letters to
newspaper editors, Professor
Guerard had an intense interest
in community affairs. He was
respected in this country and in
France for his imaginative city
planning proposals.
His sincerity and clarity in
pulting forth his ideas caused
the New York Herald-Tribune

to commont about him in this
manner:
"That a man ran argue so . ..
reasonably smack in ihe middle
of a violently unreasonable age,
and do it without wrath and
with only charity in his heart,
is the best measure of the suc
cess- for him, and so perhaps
for many others — of his ap
proach to living."

much respected for his clear,
forceful writing.
Wins Praise
Almost without exception, his
literary efforts consistently
were praised as top flight. He
was known as one of the fore
most historians of France. An
article he recently wrote about
Charles de Gaulle is scheduled
for February publication by the
Atlantic Monthly.
His liberalism and advocacy
of free thought were the trade
mark of a man who never
hestitated to express his opin
ions.
"All ideas are to some extent
inevitably subversive. If I am
told that I must be free on the
lines prescribed by the Attorney
General, I can only shrug my
shoulders; this is too absurd to
deserve discussion," he once
wrote.
His free thinking apparently
tied in well with the atmosphere

he found at Stanford. "As long
as 1 have known Stanford it
has been a citadel of freedom,"
he noted.
Professor Guerard was a
member of the select, 2. r)0-mem
ber National Institute of Arts
and Letters, the highest honor
society of arts in the nation.
"If we want peace, we must
achieve it through . . . liberty,
equality, fraternity," he said
in asserting that World War 111
could only be averted by the
formation of an international
government.
His deep belief in such a
united world administration led
to his appointment in 1948 to a
panel of distinguished inter
national who drew up
a draft constitution for a world
government.
Community Interest
A steady writer of letters to
newspaper editors, Professor
Guerard had an intense interest
in community affairs. He was
respected in this country and in
France for his imaginative city
planning proposals.
His sincerity and clarity in
pulting forth his ideas caused
the New York Herald-Tribune

to commont about him in this
manner:
"That a man ran argue so . ..
reasonably smack in ihe middle
of a violently unreasonable age,
and do it without wrath and
with only charity in his heart,
is the best measure of the suc
cess- for him, and so perhaps
for many others — of his ap
proach to living."
A willingness 1o speak his
mind, a talented, far ranging
pen and a dedication to world
peace through international
government marked the full,
active life led by Stanford's
late professor emeritus Albert
Leon Guerard.
When death claimed him
while he slept in his campus
home last week, Professor
Guerard had achieved fame as
a teacher, historian, author,
philosopher and defender of
free thought.
Throughout his 79 years, the
Paris-born educator was busy
at some project. Ho wrote
scores of books and articles.
Active Retirement
He retired in 1946 as a pro
fessor emeritus of General and
Comparative Literature, but
turned out 12 books, lectured
at several colleges and univers
ties and taught senior seminars
here during the next 13 years.
In one of his autobiographical
sketches, he described himself
as "a Frenchman by birth and
and American by choice, a
teacher of literature by profes
sion, a philosopher and his

torian by inclination, and a
staunch advocate of world gov
ernment by conviction."
