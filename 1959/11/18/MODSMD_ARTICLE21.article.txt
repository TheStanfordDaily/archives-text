Censorship
Editor, The Daily:
Were I to grant the principle of
censorship (and I do not I I would
merely shake my head in sadness
over the misguided action taking
Playboy off the stands rather
than striking at the truly porno
graphic material produced and
distributed "underground."
But perhaps the most ridiculous
aspect of this "smut" episode is
the fact that the very pictures to
which the "censors" took offense
were immediately published in
the newspapers!
A frightening picture flashes
to mind: petty officials and self
styled "protectors" peering at
newstands, challenged. . .
