Those Short Football Memories
Now we are supposed to be worrying about whether or not Stan
ford can put two pood games together and handle a California team
that is certain to be "up" for Bin - Gume, You can be sure of that
latter fact, anyhow: Cal will be up as usual.
This has been a rare year for Stanford's football "supporters."
1 guess the followers of any up-and-down team characteristically
change colors in midstream nine or ten times a season. Stanford's
faithfuls certainly have been true to form this year.
The hopeful optimism that accompanied our narrow opening
losses to national powers Oregon and Wisconsin was reduced to
the worst sort of fatalism by the time of the Washington State loss,
has been restored to unbounded confidence by the Southern Cali
fornia game and by last week (following the 55-13 collapse before
CCI.A i the fans were resigning themselves to the fate that never
again would the Cardinal rise.
There's a wonderful thing about being a football, or sports,
fanatic. Bad memories vanish so quickly.
Sometimes it appears that the good ones do, too.
Monday Jack Curtice was on the receiving end at the annual
Big Game press luncheon and got a few salvos like this: "Can Stan
ford play well two weeks in a row?" "Can Dick Norman put two
good weeks together?" Etc.
Now. in retrospect, 1 would say that Stanford has played only
one really bad game this year. That, of course, was against CCI.A.
The Washington State game was a fairly good offensive day for us
but the Cougars were at their season's peak. The Washington
game looks fairly good in retrospect (it looked O.K. at the time, de
fensively). Nobody lias been doing much better against the Huskies
t han we did.
As for the losses to Oregon, Wisconsin and Southern Cal, those
were those nice old "moral victories" and almost constitute high
points in the season.
So just because of the UCLA game, everybody's memory seems
to be clouded into thinking that all the games before that must
have been the same old stuff. This Oregon State game must have
been a big-unexpected, out-of the-blue, surprisingly decent perform
ance.
Polish Thai Air Defense, Cal
Dick Norman can. has and will put two good games together.
Norman has had two bad days this fall Washington and CCI.A.
Tloth "bad days" were partially helped by slippery fingered receivers.
Against WSC, Dick almost tore the Cougars apart in the first
quarter but didn't get much of a chance after that because Stanford
didn't see much of the football after that.
I']) until that Washington game. Norman had put five straight
great (not just good) games together. That counts the osc and Cal
games of last year and the Oregon, Wisconsin and College of the
Pacific games of this season.
Then wo have the bad against the Huskies; decent day against
WSC; great days against CSC and San .lose state and then that
lovely CCI.A game.
So, well-meaning but short-memoried friend who wanted to
know if Norman could put two good ones together consult the
record books and see for yourself.
ABOCT THIS NEXT GAMIC. As for this Big Game we have
Saturday, a Stanford victory is not only a strong possibility, but it
should be a probability. If we lose, we're going to have to beat our
selves.
This, as we all know, has been known to happen.
Rut the facts are also: if Stanford plays its best game Saturday
and if Cal does, too, then we should win by some large amount. The
Bears just don't have the offense (that was a non-existent quality
against Washington last week) or the explosiveness to outscore the 1
Indians. And when we win we usually do ii by outscoring. So Stan
ford by 29-S (we'll play it cagy and get one two-pointer, too).

Tloth "bad days" were partially helped by slippery fingered receivers.
Against WSC, Dick almost tore the Cougars apart in the first
quarter but didn't get much of a chance after that because Stanford
didn't see much of the football after that.
I']) until that Washington game. Norman had put five straight
great (not just good) games together. That counts the osc and Cal
games of last year and the Oregon, Wisconsin and College of the
Pacific games of this season.
Then wo have the bad against the Huskies; decent day against
WSC; great days against CSC and San .lose state and then that
lovely CCI.A game.
So, well-meaning but short-memoried friend who wanted to
know if Norman could put two good ones together consult the
record books and see for yourself.
ABOCT THIS NEXT GAMIC. As for this Big Game we have
Saturday, a Stanford victory is not only a strong possibility, but it
should be a probability. If we lose, we're going to have to beat our
selves.
This, as we all know, has been known to happen.
Rut the facts are also: if Stanford plays its best game Saturday
and if Cal does, too, then we should win by some large amount. The
Bears just don't have the offense (that was a non-existent quality
against Washington last week) or the explosiveness to outscore the 1
Indians. And when we win we usually do ii by outscoring. So Stan
ford by 29-S (we'll play it cagy and get one two-pointer, too).
Those Short Football Memories
Now we are supposed to be worrying about whether or not Stan
ford can put two pood games together and handle a California team
that is certain to be "up" for Bin - Gume, You can be sure of that
latter fact, anyhow: Cal will be up as usual.
This has been a rare year for Stanford's football "supporters."
1 guess the followers of any up-and-down team characteristically
change colors in midstream nine or ten times a season. Stanford's
faithfuls certainly have been true to form this year.
The hopeful optimism that accompanied our narrow opening
losses to national powers Oregon and Wisconsin was reduced to
the worst sort of fatalism by the time of the Washington State loss,
has been restored to unbounded confidence by the Southern Cali
fornia game and by last week (following the 55-13 collapse before
CCI.A i the fans were resigning themselves to the fate that never
again would the Cardinal rise.
There's a wonderful thing about being a football, or sports,
fanatic. Bad memories vanish so quickly.
Sometimes it appears that the good ones do, too.
Monday Jack Curtice was on the receiving end at the annual
Big Game press luncheon and got a few salvos like this: "Can Stan
ford play well two weeks in a row?" "Can Dick Norman put two
good weeks together?" Etc.
Now. in retrospect, 1 would say that Stanford has played only
one really bad game this year. That, of course, was against CCI.A.
The Washington State game was a fairly good offensive day for us
but the Cougars were at their season's peak. The Washington
game looks fairly good in retrospect (it looked O.K. at the time, de
fensively). Nobody lias been doing much better against the Huskies
t han we did.
As for the losses to Oregon, Wisconsin and Southern Cal, those
were those nice old "moral victories" and almost constitute high
points in the season.
So just because of the UCLA game, everybody's memory seems
to be clouded into thinking that all the games before that must
have been the same old stuff. This Oregon State game must have
been a big-unexpected, out-of the-blue, surprisingly decent perform
ance.

has been restored to unbounded confidence by the Southern Cali
fornia game and by last week (following the 55-13 collapse before
CCI.A i the fans were resigning themselves to the fate that never
again would the Cardinal rise.
There's a wonderful thing about being a football, or sports,
fanatic. Bad memories vanish so quickly.
Sometimes it appears that the good ones do, too.
Monday Jack Curtice was on the receiving end at the annual
Big Game press luncheon and got a few salvos like this: "Can Stan
ford play well two weeks in a row?" "Can Dick Norman put two
good weeks together?" Etc.
Now. in retrospect, 1 would say that Stanford has played only
one really bad game this year. That, of course, was against CCI.A.
The Washington State game was a fairly good offensive day for us
but the Cougars were at their season's peak. The Washington
game looks fairly good in retrospect (it looked O.K. at the time, de
fensively). Nobody lias been doing much better against the Huskies
t han we did.
As for the losses to Oregon, Wisconsin and Southern Cal, those
were those nice old "moral victories" and almost constitute high
points in the season.
So just because of the UCLA game, everybody's memory seems
to be clouded into thinking that all the games before that must
have been the same old stuff. This Oregon State game must have
been a big-unexpected, out-of the-blue, surprisingly decent perform
ance.
Polish Thai Air Defense, Cal
Dick Norman can. has and will put two good games together.
Norman has had two bad days this fall Washington and CCI.A.
Tloth "bad days" were partially helped by slippery fingered receivers.
Against WSC, Dick almost tore the Cougars apart in the first
quarter but didn't get much of a chance after that because Stanford
didn't see much of the football after that.
I']) until that Washington game. Norman had put five straight
great (not just good) games together. That counts the osc and Cal
games of last year and the Oregon, Wisconsin and College of the
Pacific games of this season.
Then wo have the bad against the Huskies; decent day against
WSC; great days against CSC and San .lose state and then that
lovely CCI.A game.
So, well-meaning but short-memoried friend who wanted to
know if Norman could put two good ones together consult the
record books and see for yourself.
ABOCT THIS NEXT GAMIC. As for this Big Game we have
Saturday, a Stanford victory is not only a strong possibility, but it
should be a probability. If we lose, we're going to have to beat our
selves.
This, as we all know, has been known to happen.
Rut the facts are also: if Stanford plays its best game Saturday
and if Cal does, too, then we should win by some large amount. The
Bears just don't have the offense (that was a non-existent quality
against Washington last week) or the explosiveness to outscore the 1
Indians. And when we win we usually do ii by outscoring. So Stan
ford by 29-S (we'll play it cagy and get one two-pointer, too).
