# OFFENSIVE RATTLE
## Cal Plans Strong Rush for Indians 
### 
To the student of football of
fenses, Saturday's Big Game
clash between the Golden Bears
of California and the Indians of
Stanford will provide a field day
of empirical evidence of the com
parative values of the forward
pass as opposed to a sound run
ning game.
Stanford as has been the case
for the last several years will
enter with a fine passing aggrega
[ tion the best in the nation for
| passing yards per game.
California on the other hand
will try to counter with its Split-T
ground attack.
Bears Rush Well
The Bears have next to USC
Ihe best rushing attack on the
I Coast. In nine games this season
! the Bears have averager! 203.4
: yards per game on the ground.
Seven California runners have
' gained over 100 yards rushing,
| four over 200 and two over 300
! yards.
The two members of Cal's "300"
club are Steve Bates and Walt
Arnold. Bales, unfortunately for
Cal. was declared out for the sea
son when he was the victim of a
: USC elbow three weeks ago.
Arnold, however, the Bears top
rusher will be in at fullback Sat
j urday. So far this year Arnold has
ground out 328 yards in 71 carries
1 for a -4.02 average.
Garvin Speedy
G rover Garvin, heralded as
Cal's big rushing threat in pre
season reports, has had a number
of injuries which have slowed
him down this year. However, the
I speedy Garvin has still managed
to roll up 219 yards in -12 carries
for a 5.21 average. Along with
Garvin and Arnold, Stanford will
have to face halfbacks Jerry Scat
! tini, Billy Pat ton. Alex Jamile,
and a fine running quarterback in
Wayne Crow.
Pat ton who was moved to half
back from fullback last week
| when Cal lost Bob Wills due to
injury, is a devastating blocker
and also a threat carrying the
I ball. Patton has gained 202 yards
, on the ground this year.
Crow, a halfback converted to
quarterback, is a top runner. He
has had a little trouble learning
| to direct Cal's difficult split-T
offense. But even Cal's Joe Kapp.
who became one of the best split-T
quarterbacks, had a lot of trouble
his first year as a split-T signal
caller.
Crow has a lot of natural savy
and like his brother Linden Crow,
now with the pro New York

Giants, is a top defensive back.
His passing leaves a little to be
desired but his poor record in
that department this year is par
tially due to a lack of any real
good receivers at Cal. Crow has
hit on 17 of 54 pass attempts for
221 yards.
Cal's Line Fast
Cal's line which is a big factor
in the Bear's rushing attack is
light but fast. Guards Pete Do
mot o and Don Piestrup are both
experienced and quick. Pat New
ell, probably the smallest tackle
in bigger collegiate circles at 195
pounds, is also extremely fa-st.
Stanford's rushing defense
which has allowed an average of
237 yards per game will probably
get one of its toughest workouts
in their final game of the 1959
season.
