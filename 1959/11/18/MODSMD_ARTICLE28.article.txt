# Water Poloists Improve: Top Veterans to Return
## 
### Rick Walker 
An early season and tlie lack
j of any college water polo expo '
! rience among the team members)
j combined to give the Indians a
one win seven loss record for
| their first polo season in four
, years.
If comparative scores are any
indication, the* Indians did im
prove as the season commenced, j
for Cal scored six less times in
their second game against Stan
ford, while the Cards scored the
| same number of points as in their
i first encounter.
Tribe Tops Uclans
Stanford coped their only win
against UCLA in their second en-
I counter by a substantial margin,
19-8. Improved teamwork and a
new lineup seemed to shoot new
spirit into the Card squad, while
; UCLA appeared demoralized and
listless throughout tho game.
Coach Tom Haynie appeared
pleased with the season despite
1 the win-loss deficit, for as he put
it, "We were getting the feel of
an almost new sport at the Uni
versity this year. Next season the
boys will know the rules and what
is expected of them, and should
give the top teams a real battle."
Spence Scorer
Scoring leader for the team was
Bob Spence, with a season total
of 21. The El Segundo sophomore
turned in an outstanding year in
the forward slot, where his strong
arm and good eye added valuable
points to the team's total.
Behind Spence in total scoring
; came Andy Schwa rz whose 17
points gave him top scoring hon
ors in two of Stanford's eight
games. His great variety of shots
made him a hard man to stop
once he got the ball in close range
j of the goal.
Throughout the season Stan
ford was plagued by an over
abundance of fouls, resulting!

mostly from lack of familiarity
with the game. By their sixth
meet, with San Jose, they had
conquered this problem to a great
extent, so that only two men
fouled out against UCLA, and no
one had to leave the final game
against Cal.
Harrison Returns
Almost the whole team will re
turn next year, with the exception
of Andy Schwarz, Craig Smith,
and Bill Evans, all of whom are
seniors. This means that the
team's first and third scorers. Bob
Spence and George Harrison, will
return. Also Bob Lorton and Bob
Owen who tied for fourth in scor
ing with six each.
Both goal guards, John Bates
and Rich Gregory will be back
next season to tend goal for the
Indians.
