## Adenauer, Macmillan Negotiate 
### 
LONDON (/Pi Prime Minister
Harold Maemillan and Chancellor
Konrad Adenauer began talks
I yesterday lo setlle their differ
ences. But the signs were that
: Britain was standing firm,
j Flanked by advisers, Ihe two
1 long-bickering Allied leaders con
ferred at Macmillan's residence
five hours after Adenauer's plane
landed.
About 1300 Londoners wit
nessed the Chancellor's arrival in
j virtual silence. There were no
! flags, no flowers, no fuss. There
| were warm handshakes from Mac
| millan and other government
I ministers.
New Possibility
As the talks began, one new
possibility was reported by in
formed diplomats. Maemillan and
Adenauer may discuss the future
of Alfried Krupp's huge coal-steel
empire in Western Germany.
Under a 1933 Allied agreement,
Krupp was ordered to divest him
self of 74 per cent of his holdings.
This was to insure against the
resurrection of a combine that
had helped build Hitler's war ma
chine.
An American, British, French
and West German commission is
weighing whether to grant a re
quest by Adenauer that Krupp be
allowed to keep his multibillion
dollar interests.
Krupp Sell-Out
The United States seems lo
share Adenauer's belief that an
enforced sell-out by Krupp would
dislocate European economy to
the Allied disadvantage.
Another development was the
announcement that illness forced
Sir Winston Churchill to cancel
an appointment with the Chancel
lor.
Official spokesmen said Mae
millan and Adenauer ranged over
the main topics of the timing and
agenda for an East-West summit
conference, economics and dis
armament.
