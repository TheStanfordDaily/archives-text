# New "post-grad" program helps engineers move ahead at Western Electric
## 
### 
Careers get off to a fast start —and keep on
growing —at Western Electric.
One big help is our new Graduate Engineer
ing Training Program. 1 his unique full-time,
oIV-thc-job study program starts soon alter you
join Western Electric . .. continues throughout
\our career. Students are ollered courses in vari
ous fields including semiconductors, computers,
feedback control systems, and problem solving
techniques. What's more, they study methods
for improving skills in communicating technical
information and the art of getting ideas across.
You'll find the work at Western Electric
stimulating, too. As manufacturing and supply
unit of the Bell System, we pioneered in the pro
duction of the transistor, repeatercd submarine
cable, and the provision of microwave telephone
and television facilities spanning the country.
Engineering skills can't help developing—careers
can't help prospering — in the lively, exciting
technical climate at Western Electric.
Western Electric technical fields include mechanical, elec
trical, chemical, civil and industrial engineering, plus the
physical sciences. For more information pick up a copy
