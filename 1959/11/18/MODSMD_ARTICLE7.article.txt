## Theologian Calls Religion In US 'Uneasy, Unnatural' 
### Daryl Glenney 
"Religion in America is something uneasy and unnatural some
thing dangerous which may lead to a misunderstanding," Erik von
Kuehnelt Leddihn, noted teacher, philosopher and author, told the
Tuesday Evening Series audience last night. Von Kuehnelt-Leddihn's
topic was "A European Christian Looks at American Religion."

While tho Catholic nations of
the world are a product of the
Renaissance, the rise of Protes
tantism in America has produced
an essentially medieval religion,
von Kuohnelt-Leddihn said.
"Catholic-Protestant relations in
America are difficult because
Protestants are deeply encrusted
in old myths suggesting some as
sociation between Catholic ideas
and anti-American principles."
Von Kuehneld-Leddihn also
cited other major problems of the
American Catholics â€”a lack of re
ligion in the educational system,
a relatively small intellectual con
tribution, and a concentration on
marginal rather than central prin
ciples of the Catholic faith.
"Christianity is entering a new
phase now in Europe and soon in
America," von Kuehnelt-Leddihn
stated. He expressed great hope
in Protestant-Catholic discussions
to unite the Christian faith, as
serting that there must be an
equal change on both sides. .
"We Catholics must learn to
recognize, accept, and even love
other forms of Christianity, be
cause recognition, acceptance, and
love can build bridges. The time

for the rally of authentic Christ
ianity has come, not only in the
old world of Europe, but in the
conservative American world as
well," he concluded.
