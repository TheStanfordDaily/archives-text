# Watch for the Remarkable Fables in the Big Game Issue
## Gaieties Music, Cast Acclaimed 
### Mary Lou Mckinley 
With tlu* production of this year's Big Game Gaieties in Memorial
Auditorium, Ram's Head has taken a step forward in bringing its
campus shows toward a higher level of polished and quality enter
tainment.
Although the first half of the nearly-three-hour show is slow and

| somewhat flat due perhaps to the
| material the second half makes
j up for its deficiencies and moves
I along at a brighter pace. In areas
j where the show has fallen down
in past years, this year's Gaieties
! has improved considerably.
One of the most pleasant sur
j prises is the polished work of
the singing choruses -on-key, to
gether, and, with few exceptions,
| excellent.
j With more music than I've
heard in a Gaieties show before,
| the arrangements are pleasing
and interesting although few
tunes are really outstanding.
Fine Orchestration
From the overture on, the
orchestra, under the direction of
j Russ Betts. does a generally fine
job. However, as per usual, the
lyrics are lost in several num
| bers.
Instead of the crowded, often
; sloppy dance sequences of past
| shows, director - choreographer
! Ford Oehne clears the stage in
most of the musical numbers and
lets the few really good dancers
I show what they can do.
Although the show's first dance
sequence, "I'll Take the Farm
1 Over the City," is a bit ragged and
slow, "The Clyde Beatty Cha-
Cha," also in the first half, is a
clever, well-done number.
Hit of livening"
The second act's song and
i dance number, "That Kind of a
Guy," is unquestionably the hit
of the evening. This is profes
sional entertainment, with dancers
j Chris Lindsay, Cookie Kason,
! Cally Tanner and uncommonly
good male dancers Peter Haskell
i and Oehne doing top-rate work.
Soloist in the number is out
; standing vocalist Hoddy Guittard,
| and although he sings in several
other scenes, this number espe-
I daily gives his fine voice the
| material it deserves.
Introducing the numbers, Colin
Higgins as the "Old Boy" does a
I fine job. However, his appear
ances in the first act lack the
| spark and humor of those in the
