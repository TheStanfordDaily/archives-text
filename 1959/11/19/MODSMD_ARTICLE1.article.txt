# Watch for the Remarkable Fables in the Big Game Issue
## Gaieties Music, Cast Acclaimed 
### Mary Lou Mckinley 
With tlu* production of this year's Big Game Gaieties in Memorial
Auditorium, Ram's Head has taken a step forward in bringing its
campus shows toward a higher level of polished and quality enter
tainment.
Although the first half of the nearly-three-hour show is slow and

| somewhat flat due perhaps to the
| material the second half makes
j up for its deficiencies and moves
I along at a brighter pace. In areas
j where the show has fallen down
in past years, this year's Gaieties
! has improved considerably.
One of the most pleasant sur
j prises is the polished work of
the singing choruses -on-key, to
gether, and, with few exceptions,
| excellent.
j With more music than I've
heard in a Gaieties show before,
| the arrangements are pleasing
and interesting although few
tunes are really outstanding.
Fine Orchestration
From the overture on, the
orchestra, under the direction of
j Russ Betts. does a generally fine
job. However, as per usual, the
lyrics are lost in several num
| bers.
Instead of the crowded, often
; sloppy dance sequences of past
| shows, director - choreographer
! Ford Oehne clears the stage in
most of the musical numbers and
lets the few really good dancers
I show what they can do.
Although the show's first dance
sequence, "I'll Take the Farm
1 Over the City," is a bit ragged and
slow, "The Clyde Beatty Cha-
Cha," also in the first half, is a
clever, well-done number.
Hit of livening"
The second act's song and
i dance number, "That Kind of a
Guy," is unquestionably the hit
of the evening. This is profes
sional entertainment, with dancers
j Chris Lindsay, Cookie Kason,
! Cally Tanner and uncommonly
good male dancers Peter Haskell
i and Oehne doing top-rate work.
Soloist in the number is out
; standing vocalist Hoddy Guittard,
| and although he sings in several
other scenes, this number espe-
I daily gives his fine voice the
| material it deserves.
Introducing the numbers, Colin
Higgins as the "Old Boy" does a
I fine job. However, his appear
ances in the first act lack the
| spark and humor of those in the
second half, probably due to loss
support from the script as well
as from the numbers.
Notable Moment
A notable moment in the first
half of the show comes when the
"Spirit of Stanford," played by
Judy Shraeder in the form of an
angel, is lowered from the clouds
and tells how Leland Stanford de
cided to create a farm.
The biggest blow to the first
act is the overly-long "Indian in
a Gray Flannel Suit" skit, which,
although containing a few clever
lines, in this opinion could be
dropped from the show with little
loss.
But "Without Reservation," the
final number in the production, is
all a grand finale should be and
features a huge, lowered axe
outlined in blinking lights.
Bright Scenery
Another bright aspect of the
show is the simply but cleverly
designed, scenery, which, though
effective and colorful, comple
ments instead of overshadowing
the performers. The lighting ef
fects also are good, and effective
use is made of travel spots.
Because Gaieties is toned down

from the brassy spectacle campus
audiences are used to and cen
tered around Big Game this year,
some of the spark and life may
seem to be missing in parts. But
it's a new Gaieties, and this
should be remembered when
watching it.
A few tickets for tonight's and
tomorrow night's performances
are on sale at the box office, DA
3-0665. Show time is 8:30 tonighl
and 9:30 p.m. tomorrow.

From the overture on, the
orchestra, under the direction of
j Russ Betts. does a generally fine
job. However, as per usual, the
lyrics are lost in several num
| bers.
Instead of the crowded, often
; sloppy dance sequences of past
| shows, director - choreographer
! Ford Oehne clears the stage in
most of the musical numbers and
lets the few really good dancers
I show what they can do.
Although the show's first dance
sequence, "I'll Take the Farm
1 Over the City," is a bit ragged and
slow, "The Clyde Beatty Cha-
Cha," also in the first half, is a
clever, well-done number.
Hit of livening"
The second act's song and
i dance number, "That Kind of a
Guy," is unquestionably the hit
of the evening. This is profes
sional entertainment, with dancers
j Chris Lindsay, Cookie Kason,
! Cally Tanner and uncommonly
good male dancers Peter Haskell
i and Oehne doing top-rate work.
Soloist in the number is out
; standing vocalist Hoddy Guittard,
| and although he sings in several
other scenes, this number espe-
I daily gives his fine voice the
| material it deserves.
Introducing the numbers, Colin
Higgins as the "Old Boy" does a
I fine job. However, his appear
ances in the first act lack the
| spark and humor of those in the
second half, probably due to loss
support from the script as well
as from the numbers.
Notable Moment
A notable moment in the first
half of the show comes when the
"Spirit of Stanford," played by
Judy Shraeder in the form of an
angel, is lowered from the clouds
and tells how Leland Stanford de
cided to create a farm.
The biggest blow to the first
act is the overly-long "Indian in
a Gray Flannel Suit" skit, which,
although containing a few clever
lines, in this opinion could be
dropped from the show with little
loss.
But "Without Reservation," the
final number in the production, is
all a grand finale should be and
features a huge, lowered axe
outlined in blinking lights.
Bright Scenery
Another bright aspect of the
show is the simply but cleverly
designed, scenery, which, though
effective and colorful, comple
ments instead of overshadowing
the performers. The lighting ef
fects also are good, and effective
use is made of travel spots.
Because Gaieties is toned down

from the brassy spectacle campus
audiences are used to and cen
tered around Big Game this year,
some of the spark and life may
seem to be missing in parts. But
it's a new Gaieties, and this
should be remembered when
watching it.

With tlu* production of this year's Big Game Gaieties in Memorial
Auditorium, Ram's Head has taken a step forward in bringing its
campus shows toward a higher level of polished and quality enter
tainment.
Although the first half of the nearly-three-hour show is slow and

| somewhat flat due perhaps to the
| material the second half makes
j up for its deficiencies and moves
I along at a brighter pace. In areas
j where the show has fallen down
in past years, this year's Gaieties
! has improved considerably.
One of the most pleasant sur
j prises is the polished work of
the singing choruses -on-key, to
gether, and, with few exceptions,
| excellent.
j With more music than I've
heard in a Gaieties show before,

and interesting although few
tunes are really outstanding.

Soloist in the number is out

other scenes, this number espe-
I daily gives his fine voice the

Introducing the numbers, Colin

second half, probably due to loss

Notable Moment
A notable moment in the first
half of the show comes when the
"Spirit of Stanford," played by
Judy Shraeder in the form of an
angel, is lowered from the clouds
and tells how Leland Stanford de
cided to create a farm.
The biggest blow to the first
act is the overly-long "Indian in
a Gray Flannel Suit" skit, which,
although containing a few clever
lines, in this opinion could be
dropped from the show with little
loss.
But "Without Reservation," the
final number in the production, is
all a grand finale should be and
features a huge, lowered axe
outlined in blinking lights.
Bright Scenery
Another bright aspect of the
show is the simply but cleverly
designed, scenery, which, though
effective and colorful, comple
ments instead of overshadowing
the performers. The lighting ef
fects also are good, and effective
use is made of travel spots.
Because Gaieties is toned down

from the brassy spectacle campus
audiences are used to and cen
tered around Big Game this year,
some of the spark and life may
seem to be missing in parts. But
it's a new Gaieties, and this
should be remembered when
watching it.

With tlu* production of this year's Big Game Gaieties in Memorial
Auditorium, Ram's Head has taken a step forward in bringing its
campus shows toward a higher level of polished and quality enter
tainment.
Although the first half of the nearly-three-hour show is slow and

| somewhat flat due perhaps to the
| material the second half makes
j up for its deficiencies and moves
I along at a brighter pace. In areas
j where the show has fallen down
in past years, this year's Gaieties
! has improved considerably.
One of the most pleasant sur
j prises is the polished work of
the singing choruses -on-key, to
gether, and, with few exceptions,
| excellent.
j With more music than I've
heard in a Gaieties show before,
| the arrangements are pleasing
and interesting although few
tunes are really outstanding.
Fine Orchestration
From the overture on, the
orchestra, under the direction of
j Russ Betts. does a generally fine
job. However, as per usual, the
lyrics are lost in several num
| bers.
Instead of the crowded, often
; sloppy dance sequences of past
| shows, director - choreographer
! Ford Oehne clears the stage in
most of the musical numbers and
lets the few really good dancers
I show what they can do.
Although the show's first dance
sequence, "I'll Take the Farm
1 Over the City," is a bit ragged and
slow, "The Clyde Beatty Cha-
Cha," also in the first half, is a
clever, well-done number.
Hit of livening"
The second act's song and
i dance number, "That Kind of a
Guy," is unquestionably the hit
of the evening. This is profes
sional entertainment, with dancers
