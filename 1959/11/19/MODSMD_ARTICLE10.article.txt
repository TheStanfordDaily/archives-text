# Stauffer Chemistry Building Work Starts
## 
### Judy Sklar 
Site preparation for the John Stauffer
Chemistry building which will house the
organic research program was begun last
week in a field west of the present chemistry
building by Campus Drive.
It will be equipped with some of the most
advanced tools for molecular studies on two
floors of five- and 10-man research labora
tories and offices.
The new building, named for the late John
Stauffer, founder of the Stauffer Chemical
Co., was made possible by a $600,000 gift
from his son, John Stauffer, senior vice
president and secretary of the company.
I'ail oi Program
The annex is part of a total program to
relieve the present chemistry building of re
search work. It will include the later build
ing of two other units, a physical chemistry
building and a chemical engineering building.
The three buildings will lie tied by a free
standing arcade, which will also connect Ihe
present organic building with the Stauffer
building.

Research will be under (lie direction of
Professors William S. Johnson and Carl
Djerassi, two of the nation's leading scientists
in steroids, antibiotics and other natural
products, who will join the Stanford faculty
next year. Each will direct a research team
of about 20 men.
Johnson to Head
Johnson, currently at the University of
Wisconsin, will be head of the Department
of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. He
is noted for synthesis of various sex and
adrenocortical hormones which regulate
body mechanism and which are related to
arthritis, heart trouble, and cancer.
Djerassi, of Wayne State University, took
part in synthesizing cortisone and is co
inventor of the antihistamine pyribenza
mine. He has isolated and identified various
antibotics, two of which are in use in
medicine.
The reinforced concrete structure with
red tile roof will provide 20,000 square feet
of floor space.

A $210,000 grant from the U.S. Public
Health Service will permit finishing the base
ment completely, as well as installation of
additional facilities on the upper floors. The
plans call for a full basement with outside
light wells to be used for research in physi
cal chemistry.
Architects are Clark, Stromquist, Potter
and Ehrlich of Palo Alto. Wagner and Mart
inez arc doing the building.
I'laniled Last Spring
Plans for the building were made last
spring, but a program for a new building has
been under consideration for the last 10
years. The preliminary plans were approved
by the Board of Trustees in July.
Portions of the old chemistry building
will undergo renovation as the first stage
of a three-stage renovation and alteration.
The lecture room, associated preparation
rooms and office space will be redone.
II was erected in 1902 with funds pro
vided by Mrs. Leland Stanford. It survived
the 1906 earthquake and is still used for
teaching and research.
