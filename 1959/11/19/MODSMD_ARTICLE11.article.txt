# Oski Fate Decided In Axe Day Flans
## 
### 
Oski (he Bear goes to hi* final reward today as the Axe Society stages a preview of anticipated
events in Saturday's Big Game in the annual "Bury the Bear" ceremony, the principal feature of Axe
Day. Construction of the bonfire by freshman men also begins this morning.
Axe Day festivities will start in the dewy dawn as a blood-thristy Tribesman chases the ill-fated
Golden Bear from one corner of Quad to another, said Axe Society Publicity Chairman Don Roemer.

The chase will culminate at Inner
Quad where the fleetfooted In
dian will give Oski The Axe—
right in the neck, undoubtedly—
to set the stage for noon
"Bearial."
At 11:50 a.m. a funeral pro
cession will leave Inner Quad for
the Post Office. Axe Society mem
bers will act as pallbearers for
the casket. The pom-pon girls
and cheerleaders will march with
the "mourners" as the Stanford i
band plays appropriate dirges.

The Hoover Tower carillon will
play Indian fight songs in the!
background, Roemer added. "Beat
Cal" buttons will be distributed
along the route by the Axe So
ciety.
Head cheerleader Bill Kartozian |
will be in the parade to the P.O.
clad in an undisclosed costume. !
In his mystery garb, he will
eulogize the slain bear in a per- j
formance which, according to
Roemer, may rival Marc
Anthony's over the body of.
Caesar.
Following the ceremony the |
Axers, headed by Axe Day Chair- 1
man Hal Green and President Bill
Sellgren, will remove the bear
cadaver from Quad for intern
ment.
Freshmen will be spurred on to |
their greatest effort tonight as
they work on the bonfire, by a
short rally at the fire site in the
bed of Lake Lag, according to
Chairman of Rallies Steve Web
ster. The rally will be at about
iO p.m., so freshmen girls may
participate, he said.
