Joshua Nkomo, president of the
African National Congress of
Southern Rhodesia, has been

American Committee on Africa.
His talk at Stanford is within the
auspices of the Political Union

Relations.
Before being elected to his
present position in 1954, Nkomo
was president of the African Rail
way Workers Union of South
Africa. In 1952 he was invited by
the Prime Minister of Southern
Rhodesia to attend talks in Lon
don on the establishment of the
Central African Federation. His
views were opposed to those of
the other members, and he was
dropped from the delegation.
In 1953, at the request of the
African people of Southern Rho
desia, he returned to London to
campaign against the Federation.
Last year in December, he at
tended the All African People's
Conference and was elected to its
steering committee.
