# Halftime Plans Unveiled; Bear Bested, As Usual
## 
### 
Theme of "U.S.A. Today" com
bined with some pointed satires
of the Stanford-California football
game will comprise the halftime
entertainment Saturday. This is
the fourth of the original coor
dinated shows produced by the
Stanford band and Rally Com
this season.
The show begins with the card
section spelling out the theme as
the band forms a jet airliner. The
band will "fly" its airliner, com
plete with simulated exhaust
trails, down the field to the tune

of the "Air Force March." When
it reachs the 50-yard line, the
band will break into a television
set formation. (Watch carefully
as letters appear on the screen.)
As the band salutes this year's
TV rating leaders, the westerns,
with "I'm an Old Cowhand," the
card section will flash a channel
test pattern for the "Cal" station.
But the pattern will fade and
show static interference, so the
card section will switch to the
"clear-channel" station, "Stan
ford."
A salute to show business and
the entertainment it provides the
"U.S.A. Today" will be the theme
of the next stunt. The band moves
into a little brown jug, playing an
arrangement of "Little Brown
Jug" which recalls the Glenn
Miller style. The card section will
use the jug formation with the
brand name "Cal" across the
front of the jug.
It is found that the jug contains
something less potent than the
traditional "Corn Likker," as the
brand name changes to "Calso."
Two goal posts flanking a foot
ball player appear on the field as
the attention turns to outside en
tertainment. As the band plays
"Mr. Touchdown U.5.A.," one of
the goal posts changes into a foot
ball shoe and "kicks" the football
over the other goal post.
Bombed Bear
Card section will use the foot
ball theme to portray a Bear
rooter who meets a tragic fate as
at Stanford cannon blows his head
off.
The automobile plays an impor
tant part in the "U.S.A. Today"
and the band symbolises this role
as it forms an intricate freeway
interchange. As the band plays
"In My Merry Oldsmobile" the
pom-pon girls play the role of
cars and "whiz" along the free
way.
The cards show an ambulance
rolling across the section both as
a reminder of the dangers of driv
ing and also to carry away the
fatally wounded Bear of the pre
ceding stunt.
Jazz Salute
Jazz, America's own music
form, will be saluted next by the
band as it plays the "Wabash
Blues" and forms a drum set. The
card section will cite the home
coming week's theme of "Cards
Hold Clues to Pete Elliott's
Blues." as they spell out "Elliott's
Blues" and flip to a football with
a big "S" on it.
Hopeful that coach Elliott's Big
Game experiences will be un
happy ones, the card section then
forms a huge tear drop and spells
out "Sob."
As their last formation of the
afternoon and of the season, the
band and card section will present
their traditional salutes: the
band's "Queen Anne's Salute"
and the card section's "Expand
ing 'S'."
