Nearly everyone I know is
pretty certain we are going to
listen to almost uninterrupted po
litical eyewash from here to
November next while we go
through the process of picking
the next President of the United
States.
1 can't think of anything
more hurtful, more harmful —
and more perilous at a time we
are in the middle of a contest
with Communism for keeps—
a Khrushchev Communism
bursting and bounding with
energy, a contest which we
ought to consider made to order
if we are ready and willing.
We won't be ready and willing
to meet this Soviet challenge if
we are going to waste the next
twelve months listening to soft
words and soft soap from Presi
dential candidates.
Past precedents are not en
couraging. Harding campaigned
on normalcy and it didn't last
long. Hoover campaigned on
prosperity and i! didn't last long.
Roosevelt campaigned 011 a bal
anced budget and cutting Federal
expenditures and that didn't last
long.
Truman campaigned against
a "do nothing" Republican
Congress and s<»t a "do noth
ing" Democratic Congress.
Eisenhower campaigned with a
promise to end "crisis govern
ment" and we got eight years
of unending crisis.
What can be done to overcome
this soporific vice?
The only thing T can think of
right now is to form a club with
out dues, without by-laws, with
out officers, a voluntary club
whose members will never meet
collectively.
The purpose will be to build
up wi bin ourselves and among
our friends such a visible re
sistance to soft words and soft
soap from politicians that in
this pre - convention, election
campaign period the candidates
v. ill talk sense, talk honestly,
and talk candidly — or soon
learn that they are not going to
be listened to.
We will need some guide-lines,
some ways of screening out the
eye-wash and double talk, not
whether a candidate is right or
wrong, but whether he is worth
listening to. No doubt some useful

tests will occur to you; if so, let
me know and I'll pass them on to
fellow members. Meanwhile, here
is a beginning.
Candidates Nol Worth Listen
ing To —Ignore these like poi
son:
• The candidate who suggests
that if you elect him. everything
will be all right, that you can sit
back and relax.
• The candidate who devotes
most of his time to attacking the
opponent or criticizing what's
being done.
• The candidate who is very
forthright about stating the prob
lem but tongue-tied about saying
what needs to be done.
• The candidate who thinks
Communism is a horrible danger
but says we can't afford to do
what is necessary to deal with it.
• The candidate who neglects
the big issues and speaks out de
cisively only on the minor ones.
Candidates Worth Listening
To —When you find tliem, listen
to them, write to them, give
them encouragement. Tell them
that, while you may not have
yet made up your mind for
whom you are going to vote,
you want to hear more of what
they have to say.
• The candidate who says that
the future and safety of the
United States rest in our own
hands.
• The candidate who tells us
what sacrifices we are going to
have to make to counter the
Khrushchev challenge of competi
tive co-existence.
• The candidate who says the
same tiling to both labor and
management, that there must be
voluntary discipline in today's
kind of world or there'll be com
pulsory discipline.
• The candidate who is deter
mined 1o deal with the nation's
problems, not neglect them with
the sly suggestion that some other
arm of the government ought to
do the job.
It seems to me that so far sev
eral Presidential candidates have
talked quite a bit of sense. But
we are going to need to encourage
them because if we don't, we'll
lose this contest-for-keeps with
Communism without ever quite
getting into it.
