## ONE OPINION 
### 
Unknown In most of you, no
doubt, is the fact that there's a
very special, wide-eyed guest on
the Stanford campus this week.
And though few of you will get
to moot him, I have a supicion
that in the days to come many of
you will be humming his songs.
He is Frank Underwood, ami
his songs (20 of them) are the
heart of this year's Big Game
Gaieties show.
Frank is not a Stanford man;
in fact he's a graduate of Rollins
College in Florida. But he is an
associate of Gaieties director
Ford Oehne, and this is the rea
son his music is available for this
.year's show.
Available is probably a bad
word, for most of the numbers
were written especially for the
'59 production. And this is the fact
at which I marvel.
Writing music, I hear, is not
the world's easiest task. And
writing for a show and a school
that you know nothing about
would seem, to me anyway, to
lie a frightening experience.
And 1 gather that it was to
Frank, too, for lie sat through
Gaieties rehearsals during the
last week in concentration as deep
as any monk gets into.
But after assurances from many
sides, and after Tuesday night's
opening, I notice a glow on his
face which proves he has realized
that his music fits right into the
swing of this festive Big Game
week.
Frank is in Ins early 20's,
currently in the Army, and sta
tioned with the band and gle*»
club at \Wst Point. He learned
all he knew about Stanford
from two letters of scant de
scription sent him by Oehne.
He's here on leave to see the
first major production of his

work. Other shows he and Oehne
have done were of a smaller na
ture, sans big budget, sans large
orchestra.
Opening night jitters are out
of tempo with college reviews. It
seems a little follish to worry i
about writing how the nervous'
cast sat backstage in a worried
frenzy. For everybody concerned,
the object is fun—not the critics'
stamp of greatness.
But In Frank's case, the situa
tion was a little different. For
a guy who wants to do (his for
a living, Tuesday night was a
very nervous night, and reviews i
from Wednesday and Thursday '
papers mean quite a bit.
Frank's songs, "I'll Take Ihe|
Farm Over the City," "A Little
Drunk But Lovable," "Looking
for a Girl," "We Haven't Got the
Time," "Here's a World" and so
on down the list have a distinctive
style and class which makes me
think that the name Frank Under
wood will someday be on Ihe lips
of many more than the 8000
people who will see the 1959
Gaieties before the curtain falls
tomorrow night.

COMPL A I N T S OF COM
PLAINS Here's where enemies
and friends line up on very dis
tinctive sides of the fence ex
cepting those, of course, who sit
on top of it.
Bicycle riders, take notice!
Those who peddle around on the
two-wheeled monster are subject
to the same rules of the road as
those who are transported in the
four-wheel, gas-driven kind.
Basically this means STOP
AT ALL STOP SIGNS, dammit!
Nothing burns me up more
that to be approaching a busy
intersection on this campus,
stop and wait your turn at the
red octagons, and see a bevy of
bicyclists, going all directions,
and not a one of them noticing
that there are traffic markers
in the area, and other people on
the road.
Granted, it's convenient as the
devil to have a bike close by for
trips to Quad, the Cellar, and etc.,
but I can't understand how this
bicycle necessity has generated
into a gross neglect of driving
courtesies.
Maybe it'll take a serious acci
dent to bring to all these bicy
clists' minds the fact that they
must share the road. And if it
ever comes about, I'm told, where
the bicyclist is at fault — even
partially—there'll be no come
back from insurance.
So . . . what is it they always
tritely say? ... A word to ihe
wise. ? ?
NOW TO THE ERRANT PE
DESTRIANS . . . well, ditto!
Volcano Still Active
HONOLULU (/P) — Kilauea
volcano spouted liquid fire 750
feet into the air yesterday in
creasing activity on its fifth day
of eruption.
Scientists declined to predict
just what's ahead.
