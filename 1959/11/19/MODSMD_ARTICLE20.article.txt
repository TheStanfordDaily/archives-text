WASHINGTON 1 f/P) â€” U.S. .
Adin. Jerauld Wright, who com-:
mands NATO forces in the Atlan
tic, said yesterday Soviet mis
sile-firing submarines will be a
significant threat to nations of 1
the Western alliance within a!
year.
Wright predicted that by 1963
the threat will become serious as
the Soviet fleet of ballistic mis
sile submarines grows.
Wright told representatives of
NATO parliaments:
"We have conclusive evidence
thai they (the Russians) are
showing an increased interest in
ihe east coast of North America,

I a key area and an industrial com
i pie of the first importance, not
only to America, but to our' NATO
alliance."
In this connection, Wright said
! Soviet fishing craft operating in
the North Atlantic probably are
j doing other things than fishing.
These Soviet fishing boat opera
| tions are a matter of great con
i cern to us," Wright said. lie
] spoke of the mounting Soviet mis
; sile sub menace in urging other
j countries of the 15-nation Allan
: tic Alliance to pitch in with more
i help in defending ihe sea link be
tween North America and Ku-
I rope.
