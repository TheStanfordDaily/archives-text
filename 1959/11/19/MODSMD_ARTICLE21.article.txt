# Sports with Schwarz
## The 						Finale 
### 
This Saturday's football finale between Stanford and California
has been billed in most of the pregame reports as a battle between
a top passing team and a sound running aggregation. Stanford, na
-lurally, has been touted as the top passing team as they lead the
nation in yards per game through passing with a 208 average. Cali
fornia, on the other hand, is the number two team in AAVVU rush
ing statistics averaging barely over 208 yards per game on the
ground.
The story of a Big Game showdown between a Stanford passing
squad and a Cal running attack, however, is nothing new to fol
lowers of previous Big Gaines. Last year the same story prevailed as
Stanford had Bob Nieolet and Dick Norman, the PCC's top two
passers, and (al featured the running of Jack Hart and Joe Kapp.

In 1957 Stanford had Jack
Douglas at the passing helm and
again was considered a top aerial
brigade. Cal with the same pair
of backs as in 1958, Joe Kapp and
Jack Hart, were basing their
hopes on tlu* running game.
To go back still another year
one finds a Stanford team led by
the nation's number one passer
John Brodie facing a Cal team
with hard runners Herb Jackson,
.>la\ Male, and, in his first year,
Kapp.
On two of these three occasions,
1957 and 1956, Stanford got its
most potent offensive attack, odd
ly enough, out of its ground
game, just exactly the opposite
of the way the experts had figured
it.
In the 1956 game Stanford full
back Lou Yalli came off with one
of the best afternoon's in Big
(郊마nte history as he rolled up 209
yards rushing. The same after
noon quarterback Brodie was
only able to engineer 93 yards

through the air, one of his worst afternoons of his college career.
In 57 Yalli's replacement Clinch Shea spent the day moving
around, through and over the Cal line to ihe tune of 155 yards gained
l ushing. All tolled Stanford picked up 270 yards rushing that after- j
noon to Cal's 195.
The Cards passing attack that day was good for only (50 yards as
Douglas hit on X of 1!) attempts. Just to add a little more irony to
the situation .Joe Kapp, always noted for his running, did a little
more passing than usual. The solid Bear signal caller picked up 121
yards via the air route including a 11 yard touchdown pass to end
Steve Clogola.

-lurally, has been touted as the top passing team as they lead the
nation in yards per game through passing with a 208 average. Cali
fornia, on the other hand, is the number two team in AAVVU rush
ing statistics averaging barely over 208 yards per game on the
ground.
The story of a Big Game showdown between a Stanford passing
squad and a Cal running attack, however, is nothing new to fol
lowers of previous Big Gaines. Last year the same story prevailed as
Stanford had Bob Nieolet and Dick Norman, the PCC's top two
passers, and (al featured the running of Jack Hart and Joe Kapp.

In 1957 Stanford had Jack
Douglas at the passing helm and
again was considered a top aerial
brigade. Cal with the same pair
of backs as in 1958, Joe Kapp and
Jack Hart, were basing their
hopes on tlu* running game.
To go back still another year
one finds a Stanford team led by
the nation's number one passer
John Brodie facing a Cal team
with hard runners Herb Jackson,
.>la\ Male, and, in his first year,
Kapp.
On two of these three occasions,
1957 and 1956, Stanford got its
most potent offensive attack, odd
ly enough, out of its ground
game, just exactly the opposite
of the way the experts had figured
it.
In the 1956 game Stanford full
back Lou Yalli came off with one
of the best afternoon's in Big
(郊마nte history as he rolled up 209
yards rushing. The same after
noon quarterback Brodie was
only able to engineer 93 yards

through the air, one of his worst afternoons of his college career.
In 57 Yalli's replacement Clinch Shea spent the day moving
around, through and over the Cal line to ihe tune of 155 yards gained
l ushing. All tolled Stanford picked up 270 yards rushing that after- j
noon to Cal's 195.
The Cards passing attack that day was good for only (50 yards as
Douglas hit on X of 1!) attempts. Just to add a little more irony to
the situation .Joe Kapp, always noted for his running, did a little
more passing than usual. The solid Bear signal caller picked up 121
yards via the air route including a 11 yard touchdown pass to end
Steve Clogola.
