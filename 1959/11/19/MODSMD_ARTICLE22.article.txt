Could this odd turn of events happen again this year? Most every
body whose has seen either of the two teams play would probably
say no. The defenses of the two teams alone, even more than of
fenses, could keep this year's contest in its predicted groove. Cal has j
proved on several occasions almost helpless against anyone who could i
throw a forward pass. Ten touchdowns have been scored against
the Bears through the air and opposing passers have been able to
complete close to 50 per cent of their tosses against Cal. Why should
a team with a passer like Norman and receivers galore even want to
attempt much of a ground game with a defense as pourous to passing
as Cal s?
On the other hand Stanford has not proved to have the most
efficient defense against a rushing attack. Enemy teams have gained
a mighty 237 yards per game against the Indians on the ground
alone. Should Cal take to the air when they probably could gain
at will with their highly touted runners?
A couple of statistics, however, that slip by most observers are
the passing defense figures of Stanford and the rushing defense
figures of Cal.
Stanford has proved even more inadequate against passing this
season than has Cal. The Indians have allowed 124 yards per game
passing (9 more per game than Call and have had opponents hit on
53 per cent of their passes.
Cal against rushing attacks has not faired to well either. The
Bears have allowed 240 yards per game (3 more per game than
Stanford).
