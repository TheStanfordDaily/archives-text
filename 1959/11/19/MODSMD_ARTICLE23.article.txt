# Not So Ridiculous
## 
### 
With these weaknesses brought to light maybe it might not be
too ridiculous an idea for one of the two teams to pull a surprise
in their offensive attacks.
Stanford certainly could come out of the game with a strong
afternoon on the ground. Several of the Card backs, although not
consistent, have had good days when they've looked almost unstopable.
With a little Big Cianie inspiration Skip Face, Kick McMillen, Mac
Wylie, or <-il I)owd might just sprakle into prominence. McMillen,
for one, has shown that given the right conditions he can roll up
a pretty good sum of yardage on the ground. The Stanford halfback
fullback gained a mere 185 yards in a game with Washington last
year.
Cal, on the other hand, could come up with a surprise passing
game. The Bears have a third string quarterback named Fete Olson
who has shown plenty of signs to the effect that he can throw a
pretty good pass. Most of Olson's troubles, as have Cal's, have come
from a lack of good receivers. Cal uses halfbacks to do he main part
of their pass catching and have not found too many who could do
the job this year. However, a soph back named Jerry Scattini could
be a real sleeper as a receiver.
