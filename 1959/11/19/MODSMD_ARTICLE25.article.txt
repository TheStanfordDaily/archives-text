## Harriers in Big Victory Over Cal 
### 
Their usual excellent team run
ning and four best-times-ever over
Stanford Golf Course ground
gave the Stanford cross-country
runners a 25-33 triumph over Cal
Tuesday.
Although Alan Gaylord and Bill
Covington grabbed off the first
two places for the Bears, the
Tribe took the next five places to
sweep the meet.
Winning Time
Gaylord's winning time was
21:13 with Covington five seconds
behind and Stanford'* Hob Mon
zingo just off the pace at 21:20.
John Northway, Bertil Lundh,
Ernie Cunliffc and Rich Klier all
turned in times which were better
than any of their previous clock
ings over the four mile course.
Northway was a full 30 seconds
under his old mark with a 21:26
time. However, the afternoon's
biggest surprise, and a pleasant
one at that, came in the person
of Klier.
2 Minute Drop
The lanky sophomore registered
a 21:59 race, nearly two minutes
better than any of his previous
times.
Still in the record department,
the total team time was 1:48:30
which is the third best team time
ever clocked by a Stanford squad.
After taking the weekend off
the harriers will host the West
Coast Cross-Country Champion
ships Nov. 28.
Squads from Southern Cal,
UCLA, Cal, Idaho and possibly
Oregon State and Washington are
expected.
Idaho Tough
With SC's reign in the long dis
tance event seemingly at an end
a possible successor may turn up
in the Idaho team.
As an example Frank Wyatt,
who took third in last year's PCC
championships held on the Farm,
is no better than third man on
this year's Vandal squad.

2 Minute Drop
The lanky sophomore registered
a 21:59 race, nearly two minutes
better than any of his previous
times.
Still in the record department,
the total team time was 1:48:30
which is the third best team time
ever clocked by a Stanford squad.
After taking the weekend off
the harriers will host the West
Coast Cross-Country Champion
ships Nov. 28.
Squads from Southern Cal,
UCLA, Cal, Idaho and possibly
Oregon State and Washington are
expected.
Idaho Tough
With SC's reign in the long dis
tance event seemingly at an end
a possible successor may turn up
in the Idaho team.
As an example Frank Wyatt,
who took third in last year's PCC
championships held on the Farm,
is no better than third man on
this year's Vandal squad.
