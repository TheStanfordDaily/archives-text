## Curtice Designs Plans for Bears 
### 
Stanford Conch Jack Curtice has once again gone to his drawing
board to come up with some new surprises for the California Rears
whom his team takes on this Saturday in the 1959 edition of Big
Game.
The biggest surprise to Ihe Bears, as well as everyone else, would

probably result if Curtice is wiz
ard enough to get his team's de
fensive unit up enough to hoi tic
up Cal's highly touted running
attack.
The last two days Curtice and
his aggregation of Indian grid
ders have spent the afternoon be
hind closed gates working on
some new material to try out on
the Bears.
Last year Curtice played the
role of innovator and came up
with a reverse pass play that al
most spelled defeat for the highly
favored Californians. But last
year Curtice was nursing a weak
offense that had had several frus
trating afternoons trying to move
the football and needed some
extra spark. This year things have
changed and Curtice's high scor
ing Indians have moved the ball
well, bul have been defensively
penetrable by everything that has
faced it.
Moral Support
As a bit of moral support as
well as physical support, Curtice
learned that guard Tom Walsh,
injured against UCLA, probably
will be ready to see action the
closing game of the season Sat
urday. Walsh, a sophomore, es-'
tablished himself as one of the
Indians top guards early in the
season and had been starting up
until his injury.
The guard position is the line
post where the Indians have been
weakened the most lately with
three of the top men out with
injuries the last two weeks. Be
sides Walsh, guards Gary Leahy
and Don Peter have been shelved
with injuries. Neither Peter or
Leahy will be available for the
Cal game.
Starters?
As of now there still seems to
bo some question in the Card
mentor's mind as to who will start
Saturday at center and at flank
erback. John Bond and Dick Bow
ers. both seniors, have been
shifted in and out of the first
team at the back position.
Bowers has been bothered with
injuries off and on this year and
Bond has played some excellent
football in the absence of Bowers.
At center John Thomas and
Doug Purcell are both candidates
to be on the field at kiekoff time

Saturday. Thomas, a senior, will
probably got ihe nod.
Stanford's Indians were cheered
to find out that Card quarterback
Dick Norman and end Chris Bur
ford continued to lead the nation
in passing and pass receiving this
week. Norman who also is the
total offense leader has topped
Ihe nation all year long in both
passing and total offense.
Skip Face, Card fullback, who
scored 21 points last week is now
second in ihe nation in the scor
ing department with SO points.
