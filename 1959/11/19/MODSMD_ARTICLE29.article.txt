# Cards Meet Cal Saturday To Close Soccer Season
## 
### Glenn Alford 
This year's soccer match be
tween Stanford and California
will be more than just a tradi
tional rivalry. This year third
place in the Western Soccer
League will be at stake.
The Bears have won four, lost j
to tISF, and tied CCSF. Stanford i
has also won four, and has also '
lost to USF, but was beaten by !
CCSF.
11 Starting Time
Some of the color has been
taken out of the "Big Soccer
Game" with ihe switching of it
from Stanford Stadium to the
regular soccer field. This is the
first time in quite a while that
this has been done. The game will
start at 11:00.
California is primarily a defen-1
sive team. They don't score much,
but neither do their opponents.
They fought CCSF, one of the
highest scoring teams in the
league to a scoreless draw. Cal's
goalie, Fred Becker, was an All-
American last year, having tied
Stanford's departed goalie, Bill
Dittman, in the number of votes. I
Not I'tinchless
Cal is by no means punchless. j
Center forward Alex Kersevan is :
a frequent scorer. The entire front '
line is extremely dangerous.
Stanford will counter with its
own powerful defense. Goalies
Dick Voake and Hunt Bascom are
adept a 1 keeping a stray ball out
of the nets. Fullbacks Tom Lief,
Dan Farthing, and Miklos Totossy
and halfbacks Jan Achenbech and
Henry Vierra have managed to
keep opposing forwards from get
ting too close to the goal, and
there is no reason for them to
start getting careless now.
Stanford is not offense minded,
but the whole forward wall has
been shaken up, and is due for a
big effort. Bernie Knagg's and
Wolfgang Storch's passes to
Adam Bianchi, Dick Bart let t. and

Rune Engebretson arc worthy of
special notice.
