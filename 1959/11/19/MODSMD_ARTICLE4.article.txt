# Macmillan Abandons Arms Plan
## 
### 
LONDON (/P> Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan bowed to
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer yes
terday by finally abandoning Mac
millan's pet plan for an experi
mental disarmament zone in
central Europe.
The Macmillan plan, endorsed
by Soviet Premier Nikita Khru
shchev but assailed by the West
Germans, envisaged a zone on
both sides of the Iron Curtain in
mid-Europe where armaments
and armies would be limited.
Instead, diplomatic sources
said, the British and West Ger
man leaders agreed to stick to
this compromise formula: Any
such zone covering German terri
tory should not be a separate
arrangement - as Macmillan
urged - but part of a wider East-
West disarmament program.
British Concession
In a domestic political sense
the British concession appeared
to be a considerable one. Last
month in their electoral mani
festo, Macmillan's Conservatives
pledged cautiously to work for
"the inspection and reduction of
armaments in areas to be agreed."
Macmillan's ideas of disengage
ment in central Europe was one
of the main sources of West Ger
man distrust of his policy of con
ciliation with the Soviet Union.
Adenauer feared a process of
Western withdrawal that would
leave West Germany exposed to
Soviet pressure.
Agenda Agreement
Officials on each side reported
broad agreement on the agenda
that should be proposed to Presi
dent Eisenhower and President
Charles de Gaulle of France.
This is the agenda Macmillan
and Adenauer agreed upon:
• Disarmament.
• The problem of Germany, in
cluding Berlin.
• East-West relations in gen
eral.
