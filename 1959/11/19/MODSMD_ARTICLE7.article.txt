# Axe Will Enter Big Game With Exciting Background
## 
### Greg Hopkins 
The long and stirring tradition
of the Stanford Axe is upheld
today by the activities of the Axe
Society, which thinks of itself as
the "spiritual descendant of the
Immortal 21."
Forged in 1899, the Axe became
a trophy sought after by both
California and Stanford two days
after its unveiling, when it was
snatched from Indian rooters fol
lowing a baseball game won by
Cal. Stanford retaliation attempts
followed, but were unsuccessful
in regaining the Axe.
The rivalry continued unabated,
and the Axe was not touched
again by Stanford hands until the
spring of 1930. At that time, a
group of 21 engineering students
perpetrated what stands as tlie
"Crime of the Century" in the
eyes of Cal and Stanford grads
and followers.
Aw Recaptured
The men, soon to become the
Immortal 21. set out for Berkeley
to recapture the Axe on the occa
sion of Cal's annual Axe Rally,
held before the schools met on the
baseball diamond.

Through a fantastic series of j
| dupes of Axe guards, the 21 {
grabbed the Axe from California j
I hands at the door of Ihe bank to j
j which it was being returned for j
another year, and spirited it back >
to the Farm.
Two years later, against much I
Stanford student opposition, the J
rival universities agreed to make i
the Axe a symbol of football su-!
premaey. II was decided in 1933 j
that the Axe would go to the j
school which won the Big Game |
and would remain in its hands, |
only to be risked at the next meet- 1
ing of the old enemies on the |
football field.
Several Thefts
The Axe has actually been
i stolen and restolen several times
! since it became an oficial trophy,
but has always been recovered in
time for presentation at the end
of the Big Game to the victorious
university.
After a long absence from pub
lic view for fear of loss to Call
ruffians, last fall the Axe was
installed in a display case in the
Cellar which presently is empty
as a result of Stanford's loss in
the 1958 Big Game.
The Axe Society stands ready,
says President Bill Sellgren, io
escort this ancient, symbol of
Stanford spirit safely to the
Cellar following the 62nd renewal
of the transbay gridiron rivalry
Saturday afternoon.
