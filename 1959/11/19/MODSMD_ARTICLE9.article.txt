# '59 Reunion Set For Tomorrow
## 
### 
"Coat and tie and an 1.D." are
the only requirements for the
alumni-sponsored Senior Reunion
scheduled for Rickey's Studio Inn
tomorrow, according to Dick
Sayles, senior class excom mem
ber.
An added attraction of the cock
tail hour will be the presence of
the Stanford band and five pom
pon girls. The reunion will run
from 3:30 to ;"5:30 p.m.
One purpose of the reunion will
be to build alumni-senior rela
tions, and Sayles urges those
planning to attend to mingle with
the grads.
