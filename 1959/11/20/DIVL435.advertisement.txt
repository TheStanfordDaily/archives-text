How to plan
a post-graduate
SECURITY
PROGRAM!
Making big plans for the
years ahead? Then it's a
£ood idea to remember that
basic financial security
should be part and parcel of
those plans.
There's no better time than
riffht now—while you're still
young and can take advan
tage of lower premium rates
—to set up your lifetime
security program through
life insurance. New York
Life's new AVhole Life policy
pives your present (or fu
ture) dependents a minimum
of .$lO,OOO protection. It
builds high cash values
steadily. It can provide you
with a monthly income
when you retire. Yet the
premiums are in line with
modest budgets. Why not get
the facts and think it over?
