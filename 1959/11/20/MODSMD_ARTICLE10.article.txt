## So You'll know What's What

Our apologies to (lie freshmen (who've never see one before),
and to the old grads (who thought tlicy might like to see another
one), but we just couldn't bring ourselves to produce another of
those monotonously standard Big (ianie issues.
At first, we were going to reprint verhatum (with necessary
date changes) last year's issue and see if anybody noticed. Then
realizing what a really fantastic, rousing football season this had
been, we decided that nothing would he belter than to cap it off
with this rather different Big (iame issue.
Before going further, it would be wise to advise the gullible
that not everything within these 12 pages is to be eaten up a-. red
hot, true-to-life fact.
Before getting too excited about the stories on page seven, just
try to imagine what really would happen to a modern-day Immortal
21. (Calfornia, by the way still has the axe, safe and sound.)
Prince Lightfooi, of course, hasn't been going around knock
ing off Oskies. It might he nice to get rid of that Bear, but as far
as the stories in our second section are concerned, it just ain't so.
We assume they're ridiculous enough to defy belief. (And besides,
a straight, houest-to-goodness truthful story on this page tells
how our law-abiding, non-jailed Prince Light foot will he at the
rally tonight.)
As for the rest of our Remarkable Fables of Big Game, we
think you'll know which are fiction, which are fact, and which are
just a nice, friendly chop at one thing or another.
For the whole thing, perhaps we can coin a proverb: "If yo;i
can't get a few good laughs out of anything, you're a deadhead."
So we've gone ahead and had a few laughs at Big Game's expense,
deadheads be hanged.
"Large" game, as our rooting t'lihrer calls it. is one of the na
tion's truly great collegiate rivalries. We think it's a strong
enough institution to take a good-natured, old-fashioned ribbing.

ing off Oskies. It might he nice to get rid of that Bear, but as far
as the stories in our second section are concerned, it just ain't so.
We assume they're ridiculous enough to defy belief. (And besides,
a straight, houest-to-goodness truthful story on this page tells
how our law-abiding, non-jailed Prince Light foot will he at the
rally tonight.)
As for the rest of our Remarkable Fables of Big Game, we
think you'll know which are fiction, which are fact, and which are
just a nice, friendly chop at one thing or another.
For the whole thing, perhaps we can coin a proverb: "If yo;i
can't get a few good laughs out of anything, you're a deadhead."
So we've gone ahead and had a few laughs at Big Game's expense,
deadheads be hanged.
"Large" game, as our rooting t'lihrer calls it. is one of the na
tion's truly great collegiate rivalries. We think it's a strong
enough institution to take a good-natured, old-fashioned ribbing.
Our apologies to (lie freshmen (who've never see one before),
and to the old grads (who thought tlicy might like to see another
one), but we just couldn't bring ourselves to produce another of
those monotonously standard Big (ianie issues.
At first, we were going to reprint verhatum (with necessary
date changes) last year's issue and see if anybody noticed. Then
realizing what a really fantastic, rousing football season this had
been, we decided that nothing would he belter than to cap it off
with this rather different Big (iame issue.
Before going further, it would be wise to advise the gullible
that not everything within these 12 pages is to be eaten up a-. red
hot, true-to-life fact.
Before getting too excited about the stories on page seven, just
try to imagine what really would happen to a modern-day Immortal
21. (Calfornia, by the way still has the axe, safe and sound.)
Prince Lightfooi, of course, hasn't been going around knock
ing off Oskies. It might he nice to get rid of that Bear, but as far
as the stories in our second section are concerned, it just ain't so.
