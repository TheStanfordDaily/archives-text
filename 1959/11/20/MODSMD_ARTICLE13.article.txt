# Seniors to Play Last Game for Big Red
## 
### Stan Hulett 
When game time rolls around
tomorrow 11 Stanford Indians
will don their Red and White uni
forms for the last time. These 13
are the graduating seniors; six
of them will be in the starting
lineup.
But these 13 do not leave Stan
ford without first leaving their
mark on Indian football history.
Names like Chris Burford, Ben
Robinson, and others will not
soon be forgotten.
John Bond, Phil Burkland, Dick
Bowers, Irv Nikolai, Rick Mo
Mi lien. Sid Garber, Trev Grimm,
Cap Ingham, Bill Donohue, John
Thomas, and Larry Lacey have
all contributed heavily to Stan
ford football in their collegiate
careers.
Top Memories
It is impossible for a man to
play iwo or more years of college
foot ball, and not have some inci
dent of his career standout above
tho others. Several of Stanford's
current crop of seniors have had
many such incidents.
After the Big Game, one of the
finest ends in Stanford history
will end his collegiate career.
Chris Burford, 1959 team captain
and outstanding All-American
candidate, will be donning the
familiar number 88 for the lasi
time.
Burford's career in collegiate
football has been nothing short
of sensational. Last year Burford
caught 45 passes and led the In
dians in playing time. This year
he has snared 49. a Stanford rec
ord. The likeable end is also a
top pro prospect and would like
nothing better than to play in the
professional ranks.
Eye on Pros
As Burford put it, "I'd like to
play pro ball, but not on a team
with 85 fast ends." "Burf" was
rated the top lineman by the
Northern California Football
Writers two years running and
undoubtedly will be an early
draft choice of one of the Na
tional Football League's teams.
The Indians will lose another
fine end tomorrow through grad
uation in Ben Robinson. Back this
season after an injury sidelined
the big boy last year, Ben has
come back strong and has been
one of the big cogs in this year's
Card passing attack.
Robinson said his greatest thrill
in Stanford football was catching
a touchdown pass from John
Brodie in the 1936 game against
USC. Stanford was trailing 14-0
at the time, and later went on to
defeat the Trojans 27-19, Jon Ar
nelt and all.
Robinson was also a hard-hit
ting outfielder for the Indian

baseballers. He plans to go into
the Marines in July.
This seems to be the year to
lose ends, as two more pass
catchers will leave the Inrliar
ranks, Irv Nikolai and Bill Dono
hue. Nikolai was the seventh
leading pass receiver in the na
tion last year, but has seen
limited duty this Fall, mostly be-;
cause of having to play behind j
Burford. Nikolai said the thing j
lie would remember most about .
his playing days is the number j
of passes that he hauled in last j
year.
Donohue transferred to Stan
ford from Sierra College last year i
and has been used mostly on de- j
fense. Last year Donohue filled i
in at the halfback slot as well :
when injuries plagued the Tribe
it that position.
The backfield ranks will also
k> depleted by graduation as four '
backs will be in a Stanford uni
form for the last lime. Rick Me-
Millet), Dick Bowers, Sid Garber |
:ind John Bond will be playing 1
heir last games.
Tore Up Huskies
McMillen, who would like to j
i>lay pro football if he had the i
chance, will be remembered most
of all by Stanford fans for his i
great running against Washing
on last season. The hard-driving
ullback rushed for 183 yards in
hat game and looked to be on his
,vay to ;i great season, only to
have an ankle injury sideline him
for several weeks.
McMillen has enjoyed playing
he wide open football that Stan

ford employs, because, "It lets
the quarterback use a lot of
imagination."
"I really liked this brand of
ball too," says halfback Dick
Bowers, the smallest man on the
Indian squad. Bowers, despite his
size, has been a key man in the
Stanford offense and defense this
season. He has been used mostly
as a pass receiver, operating at
the flankerback spot.
Bowers hopes to continue his
schooling at Stanford after grad
uation in the Graduate School of
Business.
Biggest Day
Garber, the energetic halfback
quarterback, -said that Stanford
football has been "really great."
Garber will be remembered hv
Stanford followers as the man
who set the UCLA Bruins back
on their heels in leading the Cards
to a victory over the Bruins last
year in Los Angeles.
Another last gamer is John
Bond, the man who threw that
now famous pass in last year's
Big Game. This was the reverse
pass that almost turned the tide
for the Indians in their upset try.
The film of this play is now used

by a local sports show as a pre-1
lude to its weekly Â«how. Bond |
admits that this was his biggest!
thrill at Stanford. He plans to go j
to the Business School after grad- j
nation.
The line also will lose its share j
with five men leaving. Phil Burk-'
land, Larry Lacey, Cap Ingham. j
Trev Grimm and John Thomas
will all graduate.
Top Tackle
Burkland is now the number
one Stanford tackle, but has been
plagued with injuries throughout
his varsity career. The USC game
this year was Burkland's biggest
thrill, but losing it was rather de
pressing. The big tackle has been
the mainstay of the Indian line
this year, Injuries and all.
Burkland plans to go into the i
service sometime next summer
afier his wife is through teach
ing-school in Palo Alto in June.
Larry Lacey, a transfer from
Stockton College, has moved into
lhe number one guard spot and
has done an admirable job of fill
ing the hole at that spot. Lacey
said he "learned a great deal here
at Stanford and enjoyed the expe
rience greatly."

Lacey, who called last year's
Big (lame his biggest thrill, is
planning on attending Law School
next Fall.
Cap Ingham had no intention
of playing football when he first
came to Stanford, but decided to
play for the fun of it. He has been
a valuable reserve at tackle this
year. Ingham plans to go to Med
School after graduation.
John Thomas, has been ihe real
utility man on the Stanford squad
this season. Originally Thomas
was a center, but was shifted to
tackle to bolster that position.
Last year he laid out because of
illness.
Trev Grimm, reserve tackle this
year, will be through with Stan
ford football after tomorrow. The
husky tackle, also top boxer on
the Stanford boxing team, will
enter law school next fall.
