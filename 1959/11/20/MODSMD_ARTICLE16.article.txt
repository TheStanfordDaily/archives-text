# ANYBODY SEEN A NICE, WET AXE?
## Theft-Battle on Bridge Result in Loss of Trophy 
### 
A well-organized group of 21 Stanford students stole the Axe
from Calfornia early last night -but promptly lost it in San Fran
cisco Bay during a wild melee less than an hour later.
Apparently disguised as newspaper photographers and Cal stu
dents, the group lifted the Axe, a 61-year-old athletic trophy, follow-

ing a Big Game rally in Berkeley.
Seemingly having escaped pur
suers in a wild ride down East
shore Freeway, the S t a n f o r d
£ang suddenly ran into a fresh
horde of Calfornia students on
the Dumbarton Bridge.
During the half - hour brawl
which ensued before law enforce
ment officers could control the
situation, the Axe got thrown
over the side of the bridge into
the 45 - foot - deep channel under
he span.
Police officials said late las'
night they had taken virtually all
of the b r a w 1 e r s into custody.
They refused to release any
names of either the Stanford or
Calfornia students.
No Comments
Word of the Axe-stealing came
to The Daily in a series of anony
mous telephone calls during the
evening. Virtually all authorities,
when contacted later last night,
refused to be quoted until learn
ing full facts of the case.
From assorted bits of informa
tion and rumors which have cir
culated in the first few hours,
however, this fragmented account
of the theft, chase and brawl has
been pieced together:
The group of 21, heard to have
called itself by t he improbable i
title of "The Immortal 21," went
to Calfornia in several cars in
| the late afternoon.
They split into smaller groups, j
land posed as Cal students during
| a series of pre Big Game events
| on the Berkeley campus. This in
| eluded a large rally at Cal's Greek
Theater, during which the Axo
was displayed to all in attend
| a nee.
Fake 1'liologs
Following the rally, an Axe- 1
, guard of Cal freshmen was to
j take the trophy by car and amidst
la procession of students back to
! its vault in the American Trust
Company.
When the car and its guard ar
rived at the bank door, five of
i the 21, posing as photographers,
j asked the frosh to move away so
; p i c t urc s of the Axe could be j
j taken.
The freshmen obliged. But
I when the "photographers" shot.
| they shot blinding white powder
I at the Axe custodian. Others of
the 21, still posing as Cal stu
dents and strategically surround-:
I ing the car, wrested the Axe from
I its bearer.
The t r o p h y was apparent ly
I passed through several hands be
fore being carried to a waiting!
car. The car had been driven
onto the scene by (he masquerad
| ing photographers.
Smoke Bombs
As |he car sped away, smoke I
j bombs weiv thrown into the)
l crowd to facilitate escape. Others I
of the 21 remaining with the Cal
students then yelled for the Ber
keley's to run to the Campanile
and organize a chase party. This
ruse worked, and pursuit was
ftn t her delayed.
These others of the 21 appar
ently then slip p c d out of t lie |

crowd to other near-by cars and
followed the Axe - carrying ve
hicle.
Probably to throw possible pur
suers off the trail, all the Stan
ford cars followed a route past
the Claremont Hotel in Berke
lay, down the Warren Freeway,
through East Oakland and on to
the Eastshore Freeway at High
Street.
The party rolled down East
shore, then across to Dumbarton.
Halfway across the "lift" portion
of the bridge, the lead car spot
ted a bridge attendant waving
the group back. But by that time,
it was too late to avoid the block
