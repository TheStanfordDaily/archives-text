There are many who call Big Game (Calfornia vs. Stanford)
America's greatest collegiate football rivalry. This of course is con
tested, even by some of the claimants.
However, there is unanimity among those who claim that Big
Game is an excuse for some of America's greatest blowouts, drunks,

overnights and rousing functions.
Because it is.
The game in itself is always ex
citing. There are those, of course,
who insist that tlie most excite
ment comes from six to 12 hours
after the football game is all
over. If you have any luck at all.
So the age - old question is
posed: What makes Big Game
great? Perhaps this year it is
ihe sparkling records of the two
squads participating.
When there isn't an out stand

ing favorite, Big Game usually is
an uninteresting show. After all.
what is the point in having a
great gridiron rivalry if you can't
have upsets? The experts seem
to agree that the 1921. 1917, 1953
ancl 1958 games were the most
exciting of them all. All of those
were near-upsets two of ihem
(1924 and 1953) were inspired ties
by Calfornia of a favored Stan
ford team.
It must be granted that the
1924, 1947, 1953 and 1958 games
were exciting. But that certainly
isn't the whole story.
The most excitement generated
last year was not over Stanford's
last-minute touchdown that al
most kicked poor Cal out of the
Rose Bowl; it was the concern
over whether or not official Butch
Simas would get out of the sta
dium alive.
Butch booted one that day.
Nice Call
While Butch was trying his
darnedest to keep on his feet,
Stanford's Irv Nikolai caught a
two • point conversion pass that
would have meant a 17-1 (> victory
for the Tribe. But by the time
poor old Butch got himself
straightened up, N i k o 1 a i had
rolled out of the end /one. So
Butch decided Cal had held.
Actually, he made the call be
cause he hated Calfornia. He
wanted to see the Golden Ones
trampled in the Hose Bowl. (They
were.)
This all brings to mind the
classic struggle in 1902. Calfor
nia's mighty eleven captured that
one, 16-0. Not all was well with
the whistle-tootrrs in those days,
either. The Daily Palo Alto re
ports:
Dudley Was Fair
"Although Stanford perhaps
was deprived of no points by the
work of the officials, she suf
fered sever a 1 times from deci
sions resulting from poor judg
ment. The work of Mr. Dudley,
of Yale, can be mentioned only
in the most praiseworthy terms,
lie was impartial and painstak
ingly accurate in his decisions.
Referee Oliver's judgment (on the
other hand) was so untrustwor
thy that his decisions were pa
tent to the bleachers and sidelines
as unfavorable to the Cardinal.''
A deplorable situation even in
those days.
Not all was bad back then,
however. The Cardinal came up
with a few sterling squads, crafty
as ever. After a tie in 1903, Stan
ford struck back to score an 18-0
win in 1904.
M. J. Wellcr of I'kiah was quite
a fullback. According to the
I >I'A: "Wellcr at full-back showed
