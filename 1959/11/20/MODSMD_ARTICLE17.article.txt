# BG Weekend Always Gives Lots of Thrills

### 
There are many who call Big Game (Calfornia vs. Stanford)
America's greatest collegiate football rivalry. This of course is con
tested, even by some of the claimants.
However, there is unanimity among those who claim that Big
Game is an excuse for some of America's greatest blowouts, drunks,

overnights and rousing functions.
Because it is.
The game in itself is always ex
citing. There are those, of course,
who insist that tlie most excite
ment comes from six to 12 hours
after the football game is all
over. If you have any luck at all.
So the age - old question is
posed: What makes Big Game
great? Perhaps this year it is
ihe sparkling records of the two
squads participating.
When there isn't an out stand

ing favorite, Big Game usually is
an uninteresting show. After all.
what is the point in having a
great gridiron rivalry if you can't
have upsets? The experts seem
to agree that the 1921. 1917, 1953
ancl 1958 games were the most
exciting of them all. All of those
were near-upsets two of ihem
(1924 and 1953) were inspired ties
by Calfornia of a favored Stan
ford team.
It must be granted that the
1924, 1947, 1953 and 1958 games
were exciting. But that certainly
isn't the whole story.
The most excitement generated
last year was not over Stanford's
last-minute touchdown that al
most kicked poor Cal out of the
Rose Bowl; it was the concern
over whether or not official Butch
Simas would get out of the sta
dium alive.
Butch booted one that day.
Nice Call
While Butch was trying his
darnedest to keep on his feet,
Stanford's Irv Nikolai caught a
two • point conversion pass that
would have meant a 17-1 (> victory
for the Tribe. But by the time
poor old Butch got himself
straightened up, N i k o 1 a i had
rolled out of the end /one. So
Butch decided Cal had held.
Actually, he made the call be
cause he hated Calfornia. He
wanted to see the Golden Ones
trampled in the Hose Bowl. (They
were.)
This all brings to mind the
classic struggle in 1902. Calfor
nia's mighty eleven captured that
one, 16-0. Not all was well with
the whistle-tootrrs in those days,
either. The Daily Palo Alto re
ports:
Dudley Was Fair
"Although Stanford perhaps
was deprived of no points by the
work of the officials, she suf
fered sever a 1 times from deci
sions resulting from poor judg
ment. The work of Mr. Dudley,
of Yale, can be mentioned only
in the most praiseworthy terms,
lie was impartial and painstak
ingly accurate in his decisions.
Referee Oliver's judgment (on the
other hand) was so untrustwor
thy that his decisions were pa
tent to the bleachers and sidelines
as unfavorable to the Cardinal.''
A deplorable situation even in
those days.
Not all was bad back then,
however. The Cardinal came up
with a few sterling squads, crafty
as ever. After a tie in 1903, Stan
ford struck back to score an 18-0
win in 1904.
M. J. Wellcr of I'kiah was quite
a fullback. According to the
I >I'A: "Wellcr at full-back showed

And Recalling Memories of Last Year's Big Game
that ho is no longer a novice at
football by the clever use which
he made of his great strength.
By falling his entire length for
ward every rime he was tackled
he materially increased the num
ber of yards which he gained ev
ery time he was given the ball."
; Unfortunately for Jack Curtice,
! M. J. has used up his eligibility.
Those days were full of good
spirit, as well. Captain G. H.
Clark of Stockton made Big
Game history in 1904: "At loft
end Captain Clark played a
I matchless game, and before the
tend of the contest he did the fin
lest thing of the day by retiring
in favor of Butt erf ield, that the
latter might get the sweater he
so well deserved."
It has not been verified wheth
er or not Butterfield got that
| sweater.
Rughy Yet
Big Game, from 1906 to 1914,
I was a rugby game. The reason
| for this idiotic change has been
lost in history, but it is .just as
well. Stanford hasn't beaten Cal
fornia in rugby since 1953.
There was a good deal of ex
citement generated in 1920 when
there seemed to be a chance that
Stanford would not show. Calfor
nia had its Wonder Teams in
those days. Stanford, however,
did show and put up a tremen
dous battle until the game start
ed. At that point, the Cards wei-e
victims of a steady stream of bad
breaks and were nudged, 38-0.
The 1924 game was the one that
saw Cal take a 20-7 lead and Stan
ford roar back to tie it up. Un
fortunately, Stanford was sup
posed to win.
Look at Us
Things got much happier after
I that. The tables were turned in
i 1926 when it appeared Cal might
I not put in an appearance. The
Bears lost 41-6. In 1930 they again
put up a fine battle before losing
41-0.
Yes, son. this is history.
The thirties were fine years
first for Stanford and then for
Cal. The Vow Boys picked up
three straight wins for the Cardi
nal from 1933 to 1935. Then the
Plow Boys took over and Cal
racked up four straight triumphs
—the last in 1939. This, natural
ly, brought about the Wow Boys,
who scored a 13-7 win in 1940.
Pappy Arrives
Then Pappy came to Berkeley.
Pappy Waldorf, that is, took
over as coach at Calfornia. Al
though tied twice, he didn't lose
a game to Stanford until 1955.
And then in his last game as Bear
coach, in 1956, he finished it all
off by upsetting a substantially
favored Tribe, 20-18. Those were
the days of no conversions, let
alone two-pointers.
Last year Stanford accom
plished an amazing feat. The
Tribe scored two touchdowns and
a field goal while Cal was manag
ing only two touchdowns. But
Cal won.
So now we arrive at Big Game.
1959. This has been an exciting
season all the way. Calfornia
has compiled an impressive
string of losses and Stanford has
put together one of the nation's
most humpty-dumpty seasons.
There was a bit of worry this
•year as to whether or not Cal
would be able to carry out its
part of Big Game. First, it was
the Notice Dame game—sort of a
free-for-all in the last quarter.
Then there was the McKeever
game (or, rather, Southern Cal).
Old Elbows himself disabled two

Bears and was trying for a third
when finally flagged down. Libs
(for short) really isn't a through
and-through Hate Cal boy, how
ever. A week earlier he had done
his best to disable Stanford, too.
This is the 62nd Big Game. Cal
has won 26, Stan 112 or d , 25, and
there have been 10 lies. In other
words, the time is here again to
EVEN THE SCORE.
Literally, it would take a 70-0
Stanford win to even the score.
In Big Game history, Cal has
scored 744 points and Stanford
674 a revolting turn of events.
Last year, we had a chance 1o
even things by winning 69-0; but
we blow it.
