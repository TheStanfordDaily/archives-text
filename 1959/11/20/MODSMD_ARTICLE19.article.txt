# Thieves Facing Trouble; Many Charges Expected
## 
### 
Though official wheels were
not expected to move into high
gear until later this morning, it
quickly became obvious last nighl
that the 21 Stanford students who
stole and then lost the Axe will
face severe action from a host of
concerned organizations, institu
tions and agencies.
All or most of the 21 were ar
rested and taken to San Mateo
County Jail in Redwood City,
along with many of the Calfornia
students who met them on Dum
barton Bridge.
Neither names nor c li a rges
were released by the police or
sheriff's office, but it is antici
pated the 21 may face counts of
disturbing the peace, theft, incit
ing a riot, resisting arrest, litter
ing a public waterway and a wide
range of motor vehicle violations.
The University was m a king
t en t a t iv e steps to "throw the
book" at the 21. One administra
tion spokesman said it was doubt
ful that any move would be made
to try to alleviate the law's han
dling of t he sit nation.
Suspension Likely
"Certainly I'd expect us to
pre ss for suspension," the spokes
man added. "After all we've ne
gotiated agreements to try to pre
\enl this sort of thing."
Men's Council and Fundamen
tal Standard Commission, upon
hearing of the theft, noted that it
was ;i Fun Stan violation. Action,
they said, was likely, "it there's
anvone left for us to act against."
Officials ot the Calfornia Toll
Bridge Authority were up in arms
over the interruption of bridge
service. Indications were that
they would leave legal action up

to ot her agencies, though one
nameless spokesman said he'd
recommend that the bridge au
thority "at least press to collect
the 35 cents toll from all those
cars that were there for the
fight."
Officials Involved
One difficulty in prosecution
of the case could come from the
fact that several police and sher
iff's offices are involved in vari
ous of the charges. Thus, juris
dictional disputes might slow de
velopments for some time.
Other campus action might be
taken by Interfraternity Council.

One house president said if five
or more of the 21 were from any
one house, -sanctions might be im
posed.
Few students knew of the inci
dent by last midnight, though ra
dio stations had picked it up by
112) o'clock and one television sta
tion had gotten films of a portion
of the theft.
But those who learned of it
weren't very excited. The limited
consensus of opinion was "nice
try, but why did they let them
selves get caught?"
