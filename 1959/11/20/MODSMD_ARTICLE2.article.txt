## Curtice Already Creates Stanford Legend 
### Ken Dery 
One year has elapased since last I
Big Game and by l p.m. tomor-1

row the long awaited revenge of
Cactus Jack Curtice and his In
dian charges will have been either
achieved or thwarted. What sort
of man is this Curtice who in one
short year at Stanford could have
already started a legend.
Jack Curtice, considered one of
the most successful and colorful
men in his profession, was ap
pointed Head Football Coach at
Stanford in January of 1958. Al
though his first year's team won
but two of its ten games, Curtice
presented an interesting and en
tertaining eleven which employed
the wide open offense for which
he is famous. All of Curtice's
teams have used the forward pass
as their favorite weapon.

Jack, whose appointment is for I
I five years, resigned his position I
lof Athletic Director and Head i
Coach at the University of Utah
S to come to Stanford. In his eight
years at Utah, he had the top
record of any coach in the Sky
line Conference, winning thirty
j three league games against ten
i losses and two ties. His teams
won four titles, finished second
twice, and never were worse than
j fourth.
Noted nationally as one of the
keenest and most astute coaches
in the game, Curtice is known al
most as well for his sparkling wit
and seemingly endless stock of
anecdotes and stories, which he
tells in an inimitable manner.

His entry into the coaching pro
fession is an excellent example of
his audacity and vigor. He had
planned to be a lawyer, but in the
spring of his senior year at
Transylvania College, Lexington,
Kentucky, he got a call from a
small Kentucky high school in
viting him to be interviewed for a
coaching position.
Borrowed Car
After borrowing a car ho was
soon talking with the members of
the school board. Things seemed
to be going pretty well until the
brash young Curtice asked:
"If I do well the first year, will
you give me a twenty-five dollar
per month raise the second?"
That broke up the party and Jack
returned to school not knowing
where he stood.
Somewhat to his surprise he
was handed a telegram a few days
later. It read: Wo have decided
that anyone who has the confi
dence and the nerve 1o ask for a
raise while he is being inter
viewed for a job must be the man
we want. (It might be added that
his first grid team had an 8-2 rec
ord and Curtice received his
twenty-five dollar raise.)
Jack graduated from Transyl
vania College in 1930 with a B.A.

in Business Law and Economies
after a spectacular athletic career.
He won All-Conference honors in
football and basketball and also
made letters in baseball and track.
In his junior year, Curtice led
the nation in forward passing,
connecting on no less than twenty
three scoring aerials.
The Indian mentor has de
veloped many outstanding players
throughout the years including
Lee Grosscup, the passing great
and two-year All-American from
Utah.
Curtice's philosophy of football
is very simple and obviously very
effective â€” his career record of
ninety victories, fifty-seven de
feats, and seven ties speaks for
itself. The first rule is that in
order to play the game well, a boy
must enjoy football and have fun
both in practice and on the days
of games. The second is the factor
of good conditioning. A player
must be in top shape to be able
and willing to put everything he
has into the game. Coach Jack
has brought a great number of
special agility drills to Stanford
which are designed to put his
players into this peak physical
shape.
Not a Pessimist
Curtice does not classify as an
incurable optimist, but certainly
he cannot be called a pessimist,
for, by his own admission, he
never enters a game without
thinking his team has a chance
of winning. This is true in the
case of this year's clash with
powerful USC. His spirit must
have touched the players for they
came up with their finest per-'
formance of the season after a !
dull loss the week before.
Cactus Jack is married and the
father of two sons and a daugh
ter. A skilled ice skater and
golfer, he can be seen in action

on the golf course on many a 1
spring day, usually accompanied
by his caddie, Stanford Golf 1
Coach Bud Finger.
