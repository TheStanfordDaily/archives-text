# Axe Is Symbol of Big Rivalry; Its History Is a Wild One
## 
### 
Stanford's famous axe, now
subjoi't of 1 ho most amazing turn
of events in the history of colle
giate rivalries, was born April 13,
1899.
The axe was fashioned from a
rusty 10-pound broadaxe that had
;i 13-inch blade and makeshift
handle. Veil leader Billy Erb
made the axe to symbolize Stan
ford's new axe yell, written in
1896 by Will Irwin and Chris
Bradley COlt. At the time, the
axe was hoped to bolster the spir
its of the "99 Stanford baseball
team, suddenly facing a three
game series against California
without the services ot its star
player.
The axe led a wild life in the
first few weeks uf its infancy, but

wound up at Berkeley and re
mained there until 1930.
Cal made the big move to steal
the axe on the day of the base
ball game, in San Francisco, and
only after several terrific skir
mishes with Stanford defenders
both in San Francisco and Ber
keley was the axe successfully
stolen.
A week after the theft. Stan
ford students, led by Will Irwin,
successfully made off with Cal's
"Senior Fence." This at first
seemed to be just retribution but
things were dampened a bit when
it was discovered that Cal appar
ently had planned tu tear the
thing down anyway.
