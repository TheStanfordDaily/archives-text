# Skinny, Scrawny, Anemic Campanile Is Big Thing on Calfornia Campus
## 
### 
Until its granite walls started
falling apart 30 years ago, Sath
er Tower was big stuff for the
folks at the State University. But
it always has been a scrawny
anemic, skinny thing.
Sat her Tower, more widely
known as the Campanile because
it is supposed to be designed af
ter some European tower, wr»f
proudly built in 1915 to look ove*
the Calfornia campus. In 1925
an astute State University geolo
gist boasted that the Campanile', l "
granite walls would withstand
weathering for 1000 years. I?"
1927, the granite slabs starte
f umbling off the walls. A sorr
case indeed.
lias Iscl!s Yet
The Campanile is still an inter
esting sight, however. It has bell
(an original idea for a tower
and is one of the tallest towers i'
the world. This latter fact coulr'
be disputed by some, but Sathiv
Tower's true height seems to br
a well-guarded secret. Strange!'
enough, it always seems to be
about a foot higher than any oth
er college tower that challeng- ■
it.and at least three or four fee'
higher than Stanford's Hoovei
Tower.
Calfornia's campus is "nestled"
into a bunch of hills and canyons
known a j Berkeley. It is not cer
tain which was there first, Berke
ley or the university.
Such things as p a r k in g and
"easy walking distance" are non
existent things on the Berkeley
campus. Perhaps this helps ex
plain the fine condition of Calfor
nia's athletes.
It would be far simpler if the
university were to prohibit cars
The Calfornia handbook boasts of
special near-campus parking lots
with capacity for "about 500"
cars. Considering an average of
about 40 people per car, this cer
tainly should be sufficient to han
dle Cal's student body.
Going to football games in Ber
keley can really get to be an ex
perience in itself. Taking a bi

?yole with your car is a recom
mended practice. The police close
ill of the streets to traffic and
parking, charge ridiculous fines
for violation and make what was
at best a terrible situation abso
lutely unspeakable.
Hut that's typical.
The city of Berkeley supports
itself from year to year on fines
paid at Rig Games by* Stanford
students.
Cal's Memorial Stadium is in
the midst of a gaping hole known

as Strawberry Canyon, which ac
tually makes things quite conven
'ent for the typical Calfornia foot
ball fan. In other words, the
lides of Strawberry Canyon are
■sometimes correctly referred to
\s "freeloaders' hill." They pro
'ide an excellent, although rather
listant, view of Cal gridiron ac
tivities.
I<'s Worth It
In general, however, this admis
ion - free distant view is well
vorth the trouble, since Cal foot
ball is seldom worth paying mon
'y to see anyway.
Another original idea is found
ugh above the Cal campus. That
is a big concrete "C" which ap
arently stands for Calfornia,
This was built about 1907 and
minted dark gold. Some red-hots
m campus are supposed to try to
eep the thing gold; the fresh
nan class occasionally tries to
oaint it green and some rival
school has even been known to
try to paint it red.
Because of 1 his latter threat,
Cal cleverly posts a heavy-duty,
lay-and-night guard on the "C"
during Big Game week.

SATHEII TOWER
Cal's Crumbling Symbol
Until its granite walls started
falling apart 30 years ago, Sath
er Tower was big stuff for the
folks at the State University. But
it always has been a scrawny
anemic, skinny thing.
Sat her Tower, more widely
known as the Campanile because
it is supposed to be designed af
ter some European tower, wr»f
proudly built in 1915 to look ove*
the Calfornia campus. In 1925
an astute State University geolo
gist boasted that the Campanile', l "
granite walls would withstand
weathering for 1000 years. I?"
1927, the granite slabs starte
f umbling off the walls. A sorr
case indeed.
lias Iscl!s Yet
The Campanile is still an inter
esting sight, however. It has bell
(an original idea for a tower
and is one of the tallest towers i'
the world. This latter fact coulr'
be disputed by some, but Sathiv
Tower's true height seems to br
a well-guarded secret. Strange!'
enough, it always seems to be
about a foot higher than any oth
er college tower that challeng- ■
it.and at least three or four fee'
higher than Stanford's Hoovei
Tower.
Calfornia's campus is "nestled"
into a bunch of hills and canyons
known a j Berkeley. It is not cer
tain which was there first, Berke
ley or the university.
Such things as p a r k in g and
"easy walking distance" are non
existent things on the Berkeley
campus. Perhaps this helps ex
plain the fine condition of Calfor
nia's athletes.
It would be far simpler if the
university were to prohibit cars
The Calfornia handbook boasts of
special near-campus parking lots
with capacity for "about 500"
cars. Considering an average of
about 40 people per car, this cer
tainly should be sufficient to han
dle Cal's student body.
Going to football games in Ber
keley can really get to be an ex
perience in itself. Taking a bi

?yole with your car is a recom
mended practice. The police close
ill of the streets to traffic and
parking, charge ridiculous fines
for violation and make what was
at best a terrible situation abso
lutely unspeakable.
Hut that's typical.
The city of Berkeley supports
itself from year to year on fines
paid at Rig Games by* Stanford
students.
Cal's Memorial Stadium is in
the midst of a gaping hole known

as Strawberry Canyon, which ac
tually makes things quite conven
'ent for the typical Calfornia foot
ball fan. In other words, the
lides of Strawberry Canyon are
■sometimes correctly referred to
\s "freeloaders' hill." They pro
'ide an excellent, although rather
listant, view of Cal gridiron ac
tivities.
I<'s Worth It
In general, however, this admis
ion - free distant view is well
vorth the trouble, since Cal foot
ball is seldom worth paying mon
'y to see anyway.
Another original idea is found
ugh above the Cal campus. That
is a big concrete "C" which ap
arently stands for Calfornia,
This was built about 1907 and
minted dark gold. Some red-hots
m campus are supposed to try to
eep the thing gold; the fresh
nan class occasionally tries to
oaint it green and some rival
school has even been known to
try to paint it red.
Because of 1 his latter threat,
Cal cleverly posts a heavy-duty,
lay-and-night guard on the "C"
during Big Game week.
