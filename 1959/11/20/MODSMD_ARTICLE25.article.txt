# COPIED, OF COURSE
## Cal Has a Fire, Too Weeks Activity Bottom Drawer 
### 
Tho two tilings generally asso
ciated with Stanford and Dig
Game (the football game with
the University of Calfornia's Ber
keley campus) are a bonfire and
an old axe. Both, naturally, aro
Stanford originated.
Most schools in Cal's position
would be ashamed to openly copy
such fine slunts, but Cal seems to
do it with a sort of pride.
The axe, for in stance, was
made by S t a n 112 or d and is well
known as The Stanford Axe. Cali
fornia admits right in its hand
book that the axe "was forged b\
Stanford to go along with its fa
mous axe yell." And now Cal
has gone so far as to oven copy
f he yell.
They Stole 11 First
How the axe ever got to be a
Big Game "trophy" is uncertain.
Cal did steal it first and in the
past decade or so ha-; had posses
sion of it far more than Stanford,
but what is the Stanford Axe
ever doing on the Cal campus?
Maybe it will be besl if it is
never found, beneath Dumbarton
Bridge.
As for the bonfire, Calfornia
has never even competed with
S t a n 112 o i'd and should really be
ashamed to even build one. In
comparison with the one built
each year at Lake Lagunita. the
pile of kindling heaped by Cal in
its Greek Theater looks like a
cozy little campfire.
The bonfire has always been
a source of a certain amount of
excitement around Stanford. The
freshman class is entrusted to
build it each year and in the past
the "guarding" of the fire has
turned out to be a real indoctrina
tion into the qualities of beer,
booze and other of the finer
things of college life.
Rousing Fire
The class of 1960, today's sen
ors, liked the bonfire idea so well
hat it built two of them. After
epelling numerous all ac k s of
high school hoods,upperclassmon
nd Men !o College simpletons
with heroics unprecedented in
oeacetime history, the fire was
lurned down about IS hours
'-head of schedule. This was an
;wered by the rebuilding of the
entire affair all Thanksgiving
Day.
Steady hands prevailed after
the hectic 19oti affair and the
"preparation time" for the bon
fire was reduced from two weeks
to two days. However, wood has
been piling up in Lake Lag for
several weeks now and in fact
some of it was sent up in flames
three weeks ago.
The job was probably done by
some Cal student tremendously
impressed with his spunk at "get
ting" the bonfire so early.
At any rate, Stanford's Big
Game bonfire is one of Ihe na
tion's biggcsl if not the biggest
— and is an annual event that
draws thousands of Peninsulans
to the campus to watch Oski,
wimp that he is, burn up.
Cal can never hope to be any
thing but second best when it
comes to bonfires.
"Monday" Is Theirs
The State University, once
again copying the Farm, has its
equivalent to Stanford's nation
ally famous Hig Game Gaieties in
its correspondingly insignificant
Axe-stravaganza.
Notice, again, the liberal use of
Stanford's axe.
But Calfornia must be given
some credit. There is the institu
tion of Blue Monday the Mon
day of Big Game week when
anybody caught wearing red on
campus is treated with barbaric
means. There have been attempts
!o try similar "Red Tuesdays" nt
Stanford (after all. Tuesday i.s
Reds' Tomales Day) but the idea
never has materialized because of
its ridiculousness and tin 1 fact
that Stanford never copies Cal.
All of the thinkers go here.

hat it built two of them. After
epelling numerous all ac k s of
high school hoods,upperclassmon

with heroics unprecedented in
oeacetime history, the fire was
lurned down about IS hours
'-head of schedule. This was an
;wered by the rebuilding of the
entire affair all Thanksgiving
Day.
Steady hands prevailed after
the hectic 19oti affair and the
"preparation time" for the bon
fire was reduced from two weeks
to two days. However, wood has
been piling up in Lake Lag for
several weeks now and in fact
some of it was sent up in flames
three weeks ago.
The job was probably done by
some Cal student tremendously
impressed with his spunk at "get
ting" the bonfire so early.
At any rate, Stanford's Big
Game bonfire is one of Ihe na

— and is an annual event that
draws thousands of Peninsulans
to the campus to watch Oski,
wimp that he is, burn up.
Cal can never hope to be any

comes to bonfires.
"Monday" Is Theirs
The State University, once

equivalent to Stanford's nation

Axe-stravaganza.
Notice, again, the liberal use of
Stanford's axe.
But Calfornia must be given

day of Big Game week when
anybody caught wearing red on
campus is treated with barbaric
means. There have been attempts

Cal did steal it first and in the
past decade or so ha-; had posses
sion of it far more than Stanford,
but what is the Stanford Axe
ever doing on the Cal campus?
Maybe it will be besl if it is
never found, beneath Dumbarton
Bridge.
As for the bonfire, Calfornia
has never even competed with
S t a n 112 o i'd and should really be
ashamed to even build one. In
comparison with the one built
each year at Lake Lagunita. the
pile of kindling heaped by Cal in
its Greek Theater looks like a
cozy little campfire.
The bonfire has always been
a source of a certain amount of
excitement around Stanford. The
freshman class is entrusted to
build it each year and in the past
the "guarding" of the fire has
turned out to be a real indoctrina
tion into the qualities of beer,
booze and other of the finer
things of college life.
Rousing Fire
The class of 1960, today's sen
ors, liked the bonfire idea so well
hat it built two of them. After
epelling numerous all ac k s of
high school hoods,upperclassmon
nd Men !o College simpletons
with heroics unprecedented in
oeacetime history, the fire was
lurned down about IS hours
'-head of schedule. This was an
;wered by the rebuilding of the
entire affair all Thanksgiving
Day.
Steady hands prevailed after
the hectic 19oti affair and the
"preparation time" for the bon
fire was reduced from two weeks
to two days. However, wood has
been piling up in Lake Lag for
several weeks now and in fact
some of it was sent up in flames
three weeks ago.
The job was probably done by
some Cal student tremendously
impressed with his spunk at "get
ting" the bonfire so early.
At any rate, Stanford's Big
Game bonfire is one of Ihe na
tion's biggcsl if not the biggest
— and is an annual event that
draws thousands of Peninsulans
to the campus to watch Oski,
wimp that he is, burn up.
Cal can never hope to be any
thing but second best when it
comes to bonfires.
"Monday" Is Theirs
The State University, once
again copying the Farm, has its
equivalent to Stanford's nation
ally famous Hig Game Gaieties in
its correspondingly insignificant
Axe-stravaganza.
Notice, again, the liberal use of
Stanford's axe.
But Calfornia must be given
some credit. There is the institu
tion of Blue Monday the Mon
day of Big Game week when
anybody caught wearing red on
campus is treated with barbaric
means. There have been attempts
!o try similar "Red Tuesdays" nt
Stanford (after all. Tuesday i.s
Reds' Tomales Day) but the idea
never has materialized because of
its ridiculousness and tin 1 fact
that Stanford never copies Cal.
All of the thinkers go here.

Tho two tilings generally asso
ciated with Stanford and Dig
Game (the football game with
the University of Calfornia's Ber
keley campus) are a bonfire and
an old axe. Both, naturally, aro
Stanford originated.
Most schools in Cal's position
would be ashamed to openly copy
such fine slunts, but Cal seems to
do it with a sort of pride.
The axe, for in stance, was
made by S t a n 112 or d and is well
known as The Stanford Axe. Cali
fornia admits right in its hand
book that the axe "was forged b\
Stanford to go along with its fa
mous axe yell." And now Cal
has gone so far as to oven copy
f he yell.
They Stole 11 First
How the axe ever got to be a
Big Game "trophy" is uncertain.
