Unfortunately for legions of
Stanford and Calfornia followers,
only 90,000 seats are available for
tomorrow's Big Game here. But
those who are shut out still have
Friday night for Big Game cele
brating along with the 90,000
More specifically, they have
Friday night in The City. And
also Saturday night, for those who
neglect to note that Saturday
morning and afternoon and.he
game have come and gone.
Big Game nights and eves date
all the way back to the first Big
Game, when "the University boys
were at the Bush-street Theatre."
Lots of Girls!
According to reports of the
time, "There were a lot of pretty
girls coming and going on the
stage, and the college boys were
very, very much taken with

them." ill sounds like a burly-q
from here. >
Most ol' The City action nowa
days centers around the alumni,
over since that time a couple of
yeArs ago when some Stanford
people decided it was too danger
ous to have a full-fledged, official
type rally at Union Square on
Friday night.
But there was an unofficial
rally last year and (hint, hint), it
wouldn't surprise anyone a bit if
there was another one at about
11 p.m. on the Powell-Stockton
corner of the square this time
around.
Parties Aplenty
The pattern of alumni parties
is for every class to have a re
union on its sth, 10th, 15, etc., an
vniversaries. For Stanford men
who marry Stanford women from
the right classes, this works out
great two functions every five
years instead of .just one.
Granted there's lots of activity
in Iho downtown hotels (at the
alum parties), one still shouldn't
overlook cable cars as a source
of amusement. 'Cause they're
sometimes the best.
Like when half the crowd is
Calfornia and half is Stanford
and a few friendly comments fly
back and forth. And a few elbows
start to swing. And somebody
takes over the controls from the
motorman. And a brawl begins.

Unfortunately for legions of
Stanford and Calfornia followers,
only 90,000 seats are available for

Friday night for Big Game cele
brating along with the 90,000
More specifically, they have
Friday night in The City. And
also Saturday night, for those who
neglect to note that Saturday
morning and afternoon and.he

alum parties), one still shouldn't
overlook cable cars as a source
of amusement. 'Cause they're
