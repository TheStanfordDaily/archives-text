Arrested Thursday
The Chief was arrested early
Thursday morning at Channing
Circle, (the intersection of Chan
ning Way and Piedmont Avenue
in the heart of Calfornia's fra
ternity row) where he and 220
members of the Yurok tribe had
built a ritual fire and were con
ducting sacrificial rites to Bac
chus. their tribal god.
A Calfornia undergraduate, re
portedly a member of the Oski
Society was tied to a stake in the
center of Channing Circle. Two
trucks loaded with Washington
State cranberries were parked
nearby. The men of the tribe were
forcing the student to eat the
cranberries, whole cases at a time,
when the authorities intervened.
Berkeley Police Inspector
James Halgaard told the strange
tale of an Indian uprising in the
Calfornia campus area.

"It started at about 8 p.m.," the
police officer began, "when we
received report s of Indians
dressed in their native clothes
and wearing war paint. Reports
said that they were tearing down
fences, porches and garages and
carrying the lumber to Channlng
Circle.
"At 9:15 p.m. we dispatched a
mobile unit to Channing Circle
lo investigate the reports. The car
hasn't been seen since, but resi
dents of Phi Gamma Delta fra
ternity house, which faces on the
circle, reported smelling burning
rubber and said that they saw In
dians carrying bumpers and fend
ers from the circle. We are in
vestigating the possibility of foul
play.
"Then, at approximately 11
p.m., a runner from the Psi Up
silon house, 1815 Highland Place,
arrived at the police station to
report that that fraternity house
was being sieged by Indians and
that his fraternity brothers had
barricaded themselves in the
building. The Psi Upsilon house
fell at 11:40, and senior Barry
Gold, rumored to be the last liv
ing member of this year's Oski
Society, was reported missing
soon after.
"At this time we dispatched
another officer to the scene.
Out of Hand
"Finally, at 1 a.m., things got
out of hand. The Indians had
two cranberry trucks parked for
nearly an hour in the 20 minute
parking zone around the circle.
"This was the last straw," the
officer continued, "This flagrant
disregard for the rights of others
could not be ignored like their
other pranks and we were forced
to sent 12 police cars to the scene.
The Calfornia Highway Patrol,
University police and the Ala
meda County Sheriff's office were j
also alerted."
The police arrested all but 12 !
of ihe Yurok Indians and placed j
them into the Alameda County ,
jail overnight. Yesterday all of J
Light foot's tribesmen were re j
leased, but Lightfoot was held as j
the instigator of the disturbance.
"He's a troublemaker," one
policeman was overheard saying,
"Anyone knows that eating a
carload of cranberries like he was
trying to make that student do
could have damaging effects."
Fellows With Feathers
"That fellow with all the feath
ers was the only one we had any !
trouble with," said another of
ficer."He seemed to have some
kind of axe to grind."
The Daily contacted Lightfoot
in his jail cell late yesterday
afternoon. "That fellow Gold, was
the only tough one," he said.
"1 had to get rid of Oski before
the game this year, I felt that
I owe it to Stanford.
"The first nine Oski's weren't i
too tough, but Gold was real
hard. I didn't want to do it pub
licly I got rid of all the others
quietly. But time was running
out, and the only way I could get
him was with the help of some of
my friends, and they insisted on j
this way.
"I'm not sorry about it, 1 hough, i
It had to be done," Lightfoot con- j
eluded.


WIPE THAT SMILE OFF VOI R FACE
Cal's Fake Bear Runs From llis Fate
Light foot explained that Oski.
Calfornia's rowdy mascot, is ac-'
Jually ten persons. "A secret |
society, made up of ten acrobats, !
are Oski. and they take turns on
the field." "That's so that no one j
knows who to sue or arrest when
Oski gets in trouble," a Cal
spokesman explained.
"They've tried to lock up Oski
several times," the unidentified
spokesman from the University
of Calfornia's Dean's Office went
on, "but they've never caught all
of them. This Indian of yours did
a real good .job, he got all but
one, and I think that we can
handle that fellow now. Seem.s
that he is having hallucinations
and a stomach ache."
