# Kids Plot Seizure of Stadium
## 
### 
Entertaining the fervent hope
that they can repeat their all time
performance in the last Big Game |
held at Stanford, those residents
of the end zone, 10,469 kids and
their dogs held a clandestine
meeting in the Cow Palace this j
weekend to plan their strategy.
For those new to Stanford al-!
low us to bring you up to date
as to the significance of this j
event.
In 1957 Stanford quarterback j
Jack Douglas dove into the area
around the end zone and was sur
prised to be tackled by about
seven players wearing Calfornia !
uniforms and about a quarter of
a million kids in the six to four
teen age bracket.
We Hate Tliem
Fifteen minutes later when
Douglas was able to dig himself
out of the pile and be helped off
the field he came up with what i
has since been the motto and
favorite cheer of Stanford rooters
ever since, "I hate kids."
N'ot; to be denied though the
kids have organized this year in
order to prevent a recurrence of
this type of happening and thus
they all got together.
A Daily reporter dressed in his
knickers which he hadn't used for
15 years managed to sneak into
the meeting and here is his report
as to what the kids' plan of at
tack is this year.
Their theme for- the game is
"lis no passeront," (They stole
this, we think) and apparently
their obpect is to seriously im
pair Dick Norman's passing at
tack.
Blow guns are to be the order
of the day and every time a Nor
man pass takes off the plan is to
puncture the football with a dart
while in mid-air.

One representative from the
younger set of San Jose, at the
rally to pick up some pointers for
next year's San Jose-COP game,
brought up the point that the of
ficials might run out of footballs.
He was quickly hissed down with
the cry that, "they can always
buy some during the halves."

order to prevent a recurrence of
this type of happening and thus
they all got together.
A Daily reporter dressed in his
knickers which he hadn't used for
15 years managed to sneak into
the meeting and here is his report
as to what the kids' plan of at
tack is this year.
Their theme for- the game is
"lis no passeront," (They stole
this, we think) and apparently
their obpect is to seriously im
pair Dick Norman's passing at
tack.
Blow guns are to be the order
of the day and every time a Nor
man pass takes off the plan is to
puncture the football with a dart
while in mid-air.
Fans for Themselves
One representative from the
younger set of San Jose, at the
rally to pick up some pointers for
next year's San Jose-COP game,
brought up the point that the of
ficials might run out of footballs.
He was quickly hissed down with
the cry that, "they can always
buy some during the halves."
Entertaining the fervent hope
that they can repeat their all time
performance in the last Big Game |
held at Stanford, those residents
of the end zone, 10,469 kids and
their dogs held a clandestine
meeting in the Cow Palace this j
weekend to plan their strategy.
For those new to Stanford al-!
low us to bring you up to date
as to the significance of this j
event.
In 1957 Stanford quarterback j
Jack Douglas dove into the area
around the end zone and was sur
prised to be tackled by about
seven players wearing Calfornia !
uniforms and about a quarter of
a million kids in the six to four
teen age bracket.
We Hate Tliem
Fifteen minutes later when
Douglas was able to dig himself
out of the pile and be helped off
the field he came up with what i
has since been the motto and
favorite cheer of Stanford rooters
ever since, "I hate kids."
N'ot; to be denied though the
kids have organized this year in
order to prevent a recurrence of
this type of happening and thus
they all got together.
