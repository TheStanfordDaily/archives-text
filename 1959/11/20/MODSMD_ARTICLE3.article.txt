# Calfornia's Golden Bears
## Indians Battle Calfornia 
### John Schwarz, Sports Editor 
At 1:30 tomorrow afternoon Stanford and Calfornia will lake to the gridiron to oppose each other
lor the 62nd time in the history of two schools in the 1959 edition of the classic Big Game.
A total of 3,205,800 people have turned out to see the 61 previous Big Games and an additional
90,000 are expected to pack Stanford Stadium tomorrow to see this year's game.
The history of the Big Game has been sprinkled with stories of inspired underdog teams rising to
colossal heights against heavily favored traditional rivals.
To name a few there were the 1929, 1947, 1948, 1950 and 1958 games in which heavy under
dog Stanford teams played above their heads and either defeated, lied, or threw a tremendous scare
into the Bears of Calfornia.
The Bears too have had afternoons when they were counted out before game time only to play a re-

markable game thrilling a crowd of awed onlookers. The 1934
game or llie 19-11 affair or I lie 1951 or 1956 games are good
examples.
This year, however, for one of the rare limes in 15ig (»aine
history the two opponents will enter the game on almost even
gronnds. Neither team has had a very successful season. Stanford
has lost six while only winning three games this year. The Bears
of Calforniu have had even worse Inck picking up only one \sin
in nine games.
Neither team could reall\ he called much of a favorite even
though the local oddsmakers have installed Stanford as a four
point choice. I'erhaps the host way to look at the game is the way
one San Francisco sportswriter mentioned, "Both teams should
enter this one as underdogs."
But the records of the two teams have not been completely in
dicative of their play this season. Both clubs have had several
frustrating one, two and three point losses which, of course, are
listed in the records the same as the 20 point beatings.
Stanford dropped its opener to Rose Bowl contender Oregon by
a mere point 28-27. The following week ihe Indians lost to the Big
i Ten leaders, Wisconsin, by two points 16-14. Later in the year USC,
' the fourth ranked team in the nation, were only able to squeak out
| a two point win over the Indians 30-28.
j Calfornia, likewise, has had amongst its losses several frustrat
! ing encounters. The Bears were edged by UCLA the fifth week of
the season 18-12, followed by a 24-20 loss to Oregon State, a 1 1-7
i defeat to USC. and a last minute 20-18 loss to Oregon.
If either or both of the two teams take out a little of this
j frustration on their opponents tomorrow, the 90,000 spectators may

The legendary Cal Jackie Jen

in the 1947 Big Game is the long

get more than their money's
worth of exciting football.
Calfornia has one of the best
running backfields on the West
Coast. Grover Garvin, Wayne
Crow, Billy Patton, and Walt
Arnold are four sound running
backs. Unfortunately, two of them
are fullbacks and two are half
backs, and a backfield needs a
quarterback as well if it is going
to function properly. Crow, an
outstanding football player but
definitely a halfback, has tried to
fill the vacancy at quarterback
for the Bears. He has had only
varying success this year but is
the best the Bears have had.
With Crow at quarterback and
halfbacks Steve Bates, and Bob/

Wills out with injuries, Patton, a
fullback by trade, has had to
move to halfback, Patton's switch,
however, is not as difficult as
his team mate Crow's.
Patton and Arnold produce the
power in the backfield, and Garv
in, plus reserves Jerry Scattini
and Alex Jamile produce iho
speed.
The Cal line has had its ups
and downs this year. Thv>y put in
one of the best line efforts of the
year against USC including a
brilliant goal line stand in which
they held the Trojans for lour
downs on the two yard line.
Against Washington, lowa,
Texas, and Notre Dame, however,
the line was thoroughly out
! played.
J Guards Pete Domoto and Don

Piestrup are two extremely fast
linemen.
Pal Newell, at 195 pounds and
co-captain of the Bears, plays one
of the tackle spots with Frank
Sally, 220, at the other.
End spots have given Bear
Coach Pete Elliott fits all year
with Skip Huber, Dave George,
Gael Barsotti, Tom Bates, Dave
Maggard, and others all having a
chance to play.
Stanford has also had its up
and down days this year. One
week the Indians look like world
beaters by rolling up 54 points in
a game, as they did aaginst San
Jose, and the next week they're
ripped apart by an underdog
UCLA team 55-13.
Most of Stanford's fortunes
have ridden on the arm of quar
terback Dick Norman, tho na
tion's leading offensive machine.
The machine, however, like
many of our modern mechanical
conveniences has broken down on
occasions and so have the In
dians.
Norman, although the import
ant cog, has by no means been
the only part of the Stanford
lineup that has contributed to
Stanford's football story in 1959.
The rest of the backfield in
cludes Mac VVylie, a powerful
blocker, tackier, and runner at
halfback with Skip Face, the na
tion's second leading scorer at
fullback. Either John Bond or
Dick Bowers, both speedy pass
receivers, will be at the flanker
back position.
Stanford's line which has had
a lot to trouble 111 is year on de
fense will have to be at its best
to stop Cal's runing game. Phil
Burkland and Gary Pike will be
manning the tackle posts tomor
row with Ron Fernandes and
Larry Lacey at guards. Either
Doug Pursell or John Thomas will
be at center.
Stanford's two ends, Ben Robin
son and Captain Chris Burford
are Ivyo of the nation's best.
All indications point to a high
scoring affair between the tradi
tional rivals. Like so many of
Stanford's encounters this year,
the final score may resemble
more that of a basketball game
than a football game.
