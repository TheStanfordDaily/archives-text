# Calfornia's Golden Bears
## Indians Battle Calfornia 
### John Schwarz, Sports Editor 
At 1:30 tomorrow afternoon Stanford and Calfornia will lake to the gridiron to oppose each other
lor the 62nd time in the history of two schools in the 1959 edition of the classic Big Game.
A total of 3,205,800 people have turned out to see the 61 previous Big Games and an additional
90,000 are expected to pack Stanford Stadium tomorrow to see this year's game.
The history of the Big Game has been sprinkled with stories of inspired underdog teams rising to
colossal heights against heavily favored traditional rivals.
To name a few there were the 1929, 1947, 1948, 1950 and 1958 games in which heavy under
dog Stanford teams played above their heads and either defeated, lied, or threw a tremendous scare
into the Bears of Calfornia.
The Bears too have had afternoons when they were counted out before game time only to play a re-

markable game thrilling a crowd of awed onlookers. The 1934
game or llie 19-11 affair or I lie 1951 or 1956 games are good
examples.
This year, however, for one of the rare limes in 15ig (»aine
history the two opponents will enter the game on almost even
gronnds. Neither team has had a very successful season. Stanford
has lost six while only winning three games this year. The Bears
of Calforniu have had even worse Inck picking up only one \sin
in nine games.
Neither team could reall\ he called much of a favorite even
though the local oddsmakers have installed Stanford as a four
point choice. I'erhaps the host way to look at the game is the way
one San Francisco sportswriter mentioned, "Both teams should
enter this one as underdogs."
But the records of the two teams have not been completely in
dicative of their play this season. Both clubs have had several
frustrating one, two and three point losses which, of course, are
listed in the records the same as the 20 point beatings.
Stanford dropped its opener to Rose Bowl contender Oregon by
a mere point 28-27. The following week ihe Indians lost to the Big
i Ten leaders, Wisconsin, by two points 16-14. Later in the year USC,
' the fourth ranked team in the nation, were only able to squeak out
| a two point win over the Indians 30-28.
j Calfornia, likewise, has had amongst its losses several frustrat
! ing encounters. The Bears were edged by UCLA the fifth week of
the season 18-12, followed by a 24-20 loss to Oregon State, a 1 1-7
i defeat to USC. and a last minute 20-18 loss to Oregon.
If either or both of the two teams take out a little of this
j frustration on their opponents tomorrow, the 90,000 spectators may
