# IN JAIL NOW, THOUGH
## Stanford's Favorite Indian Recounts Campaign to Abolish That Wimpy Bear 
### 
Sitting in his cell on the 13th I
floor of Oakland's City Hall, Stan-!
ford's Yurok Indian mascot, Chief j
Timm Williams Lightfoot, told a
fantastic tale of his efforts to I
eliminate the ten members of i
Cal's Oski Society before tomor-!
row's Big Game.
Lightfoot explained how elimi- j
nating Cal's wiry mascot turned i
into a Homeric undertaking. Ten 1
persons in all are Oski. They are
the members of the secret Oski
Society and they take turns play
ing Ihe part of the rowdy plas
ticine mascot.
He Smokes
Still in his royal Yurok regalia)
in his cell, Lightfoot rubbed two |
sticks together to light a cigarette !
before beginning his strange tale
of intrigue.
The Chief took care of three!
Oskis in one stroke late in Sep
tember. Posing as a slate high
way patrolman on the San Fran
cisco Bay Bridge, he directed the
three Oskis, Boy Ryder, Vic de

Salvigio and Bob March, who
were driving in Ryder's Volks
wagen onto the lower deck of the
bridge between a diesel truck
and trailer and a Greyhound
Scenieruiser.
Three battered Volkswagen
hubcaps were found near Ihe
Yerba Buena Island tunnel, but
neither the three students nor
Ryder's car have been seen since.
Harrison Nipped
On Oct. 10 Lightfoot ran down
his next victim . . . literally. But
Stanford's mighty Yurok needed
all of his ingenuity before he
finally got Cal Sigma Chi Bill
Harrison.
Three attempts to dupe Harri
son into walking across the Gold
en Gate Bridge were unsuccess
ful, and an offer of free drinks at
the top of the Mark was rejected
by the wary Harrison.
But Harrison is no longer with
us. He attempted to cross El Ca
mino at Embarcadero on foot.
An anonymous Oski came to
the Stanford-UCLA game two
weeks ago. Captured and bound,
he was suited in a Stanford uni
form at halftime and sent into
the line during the third quarter.
He died before he could make it
to the sidelines.
Search Parties Sent
Posing as a Hoover Tower
guide, Chief Lightfoot directed
Oski Jim Fuller down Ihe emerg
ency exit from the observation

platform. Two days later search
parties wore organized to probe
iho unlit, winding 14 story
emergency exit. "We sent search
parties down eight levels, but
didn't find anything. If he went
further than that, there would be
no use looking," a county deputy
sheriff told reporters.
Showing off his new Renault
Dauphine, Oski Ben Roberts was
lost in a chuckhole on Searsville
Road near the stables.
"But," explained Light foot,
"the most nearly perfect case was
Oski number nine. He was work
ing as a student policeman for us
two weeks ago in the end zone
area.
"Usually we let the student po
lice go free at about two minutes
before the end of the game, but I
ordered him to stay to the end
and keep the kids off the field.
All that was found was some
bones and occasional pieces of
skin."
Lightfoot's tale of heroism and
undaunted devotion to Stanford
ended then; visiting hours were
over, and his lawyer was waiting.
