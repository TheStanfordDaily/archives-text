# King of Scalpers Will Miss Big Game
## 
### 
This year is another first in (he
long and colorful history of Big
Game. "Six-Buck" Sammy Score
now, king of the Big Game ticket
scalpers, will be among the miss
ing.
Since last Big Game Sammy
has gone into semi-retirement
only coming out of his room to
heat his wife or snarl at his
kids.
The Last
Sammy is the last of the hig
time scalpers. He is unanimously
credited by every scalper in t ho
business as having developed the
trade into an art.
How Sammy got his name is
one of the most interesting things

about him. Back around the turn
of the century when Sammy was
just breaking into the ranks of
the big time, Big (lame was al
ready the ultimate in scalping
possibilities. Every scalper in the
country journeyed to Northern
, Calfornia to get in on this color
ful and lucrative sports event.
Night in Jail
After the game they would all
i hold their own Big Game over
flight at either the Palo Alto or
Berkeley city jail (depending on
where the game was played) and
they would stay up all night
j trading stories on their after
i noon's take.
Back around this time Big

Game tickets only cost a dollar. J
Sammy's philosophy was always!
to operate on a low margin of i
profit and Sammy provided tick j
ets to the unfortunates who had j
to patronize scalpers for a low,
low two dollars. His nick-name
at the time was, of course, "Two-
Buck" Sammy.
In 191G the legitimate price for
Big Game tickets went up to two
dollars and Sammy's went up to
three. His nick-name rose ac
cordingly until finally in 1954 it
hit the level at which it has since
remained.
Elusive Lad
This constant changing of
names which Sammy had nothing
to do with (It became sort of a
tratition to baptize Sammy with
a bottle of red-eye every time
ticket prices rose) made it hard
for the gendarmes to keep track
of him and he holds the record
for the least time in the clink
per year. His lifetime T.C.Y. is
1.92 compared to which 4.23 is
about average.
So it is that the greatest scalper
ever to sell a ticket scalps no
more. All of Sammy's successors
say that they will always try to
live up to the ideal set by him.
