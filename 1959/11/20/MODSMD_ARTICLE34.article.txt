# READY TO DIE
## Oski Came Ten Years Before PL 
### 
The late Oski, or Oskies (plural)
came to Calfornia in 1041; Stan
ford got its present (or past)
mascot in 1952. Now the
may have to start all over again.
Cat's wimpy little phony Bear
mascot originated after two stu
dents had appeared at a 1941
game wearing hear masks. When
somebody, for some unknown
reason, shouted out "Oski!" the
name stuck and the "society"
grew to what il has been until
Price Lightfoot went on the war
path.
Ex-Indian Yet
At one time, a former Stanford
student acted as an "Oski." As he
put it,"I was just walking out of
class one day (at Cal, that is) and
two guys walked up and asked
me if I wanted to be Oski. I said

yes." This particular Oski hung
up the head, fortunately for him
self, several years ago after
climbing up an estimated 124
goal posts.
The Calfornia dean of men and
the members of the "society" (of
course) are supposedly the only
people who know the identities of
the Oski clan. In 1955, a 12-year
old Berkeley spectator tried to
sue the mascot ($50,000) but no
body knew who he was. The kid
was trampled in a stampede for
some ice cream Oski had thrown
into the stands.
Daily Cal Prolific
Cal's redoubtable college organ,
the Daily Calfornian commented
by saying glibly, "Who the hell is
Oski?"
Prince Light foot's first contact
with Stanford came in 1951 when
he was asked to dance at the Big
Game rally. In '52 he was taken
as the school's official mascot.
In the past he has traveled with
the football team to many of ils
away games.
Lightfoot was the first through
and-through Stanford mascot.
Around 1948 some students tried
to battle Oski by originating an
"Injun Joe" mascot but that idea
never really caught on.
Just who Stanford's next mas
cot will be is up to the Great
White Father.

mascot in 1952. Now the
may have to start all over again.
Cat's wimpy little phony Bear
mascot originated after two stu
dents had appeared at a 1941
game wearing hear masks. When
somebody, for some unknown
reason, shouted out "Oski!" the
name stuck and the "society"
grew to what il has been until
Price Lightfoot went on the war
path.
Ex-Indian Yet
At one time, a former Stanford
student acted as an "Oski." As he
put it,"I was just walking out of
class one day (at Cal, that is) and
two guys walked up and asked
me if I wanted to be Oski. I said

yes." This particular Oski hung
up the head, fortunately for him
self, several years ago after
climbing up an estimated 124
goal posts.
The Calfornia dean of men and
the members of the "society" (of
course) are supposedly the only
people who know the identities of
the Oski clan. In 1955, a 12-year
old Berkeley spectator tried to
sue the mascot ($50,000) but no
body knew who he was. The kid
was trampled in a stampede for
some ice cream Oski had thrown
into the stands.
Daily Cal Prolific
Cal's redoubtable college organ,
the Daily Calfornian commented
by saying glibly, "Who the hell is
Oski?"
Prince Light foot's first contact
with Stanford came in 1951 when
he was asked to dance at the Big
Game rally. In '52 he was taken
as the school's official mascot.
In the past he has traveled with
the football team to many of ils
away games.
Lightfoot was the first through
and-through Stanford mascot.
Around 1948 some students tried
to battle Oski by originating an
"Injun Joe" mascot but that idea
never really caught on.
Just who Stanford's next mas
cot will be is up to the Great
White Father.


PRINCE LIGHTFOOT
Stanford's Hero
The late Oski, or Oskies (plural)
came to Calfornia in 1041; Stan
ford got its present (or past)
mascot in 1952. Now the
may have to start all over again.
