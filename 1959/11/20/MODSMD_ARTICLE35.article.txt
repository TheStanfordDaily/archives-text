# AS YOU WOULD EXPECT
## Card Rooters First with Stunts 
### 
As would tie expected. Stanford
rooters are often credited with
being the first in the nation to
perform stunts in the bleachers
between halves of a football
game.
The man credited with starting
all this is Thomas Jewell, civil en
gineer from Burhank who was
a graduate student at Stanford
in 1904-05. "J saw a great blotch
of red in the bleachers, resulting
from the rioters' rod hats," Jew
ell says,"and it occurred to me
that il would be possible to work
out the block letter 'S' in white."
But the story of rooters' stunts
goes back to 1899 when 300 car
dinal vests were ordered for Big
Game. Rooters wearing the vests
constituted the front and nucleus
of the Stanford section.
Nice Try, Cal
Hoffman. Rothehild and Coe of
San Francisco, who made the car
dinal vests, were also approached
by representatives of the Univer
sity of Calfornia at Berkeley stu
dent body regarding an order
for blue and gold vests for their
rooting section. However", Cal's
attempt at "originality" was met
with failure. The firm refused to
enter into any contract with the
Berkeley stunents, and informed
them that the idea of wearing
college vests had originated .it
Stanford.

The true beginning of card
stunts was in i904 when Stanford
rooters formed a block white "S"
by rooters donning cooks' caps
and coat-s. Stanford also liber ated
snow-white pigeons with cardinal
ribbons streaming from their
legs.
Original Finally
The sum total of Cal's 1905
rooting stunts consisted of root
ers in dark blue hats with wide
yellow bands waving long -strips
of gold bunting.
Calfornia finally managed to
ge< an original idea in 1906 when
the extremely clever Bear rooters
sent up fireworks which released
paper balloons and parachutes.
Stanford had two homing pigeons
which flew around the field and
then returned to the Stanford
side.
Stanford advanced the progress
of card stunts a little further
when, in 1907, the letters "LSJU"
were formed by the white-draped
rooters in the middle of the Car
dinal i"ed. Cal tried to imitate us
when, in 1909, its rooters sat in
alternate rows of blue and yel
low. In 1910 the rooters formed
an axe in blue with a golden "C"
in the middle.
Stanford again outdid Cal in
1920. On a field of white appeared
a neat little coffin with a yellow
"C" while the band played a fu

l neral dirge. Then a giant crim
son axe was formed.
At the end of the first half,
after a series of whistles and
frantic instructions from the ri
val yell leaders, ihe two sections
got under way with their bleacher
i stunts. The Bears spelled out
their school's name in gold let
ters on a blue background, then
I flashed a replica of the Golden
Bear. It looked more like an ant
\ eater, said the Daily Palo Alto.
: but nobody minded.
A novel stunt by Cal in 193,3
; was a facsimile of the Daily Cal
fornian bearing the bold dreamer
"BEARS FAVORED." The Stan
ford Daily followed in facsimile
in the Stanford section and pro
! claimed: "CARDS WIN. RETAIN
' AXE."
Women!
i In 1939. for the first time in
history, women participated in
card stunts. The entire stunt sec
tion contained 2200 students. The
biggest innovation was a moving
stunt a large Stanford Indian
waving his hand in greeting to
Berkeley rooters.
In 1917 Cal rooters tore up two
rows of seats at Stanford sta
dium, disregarding a Stanford
cai'd stunt which pleaded "Win or
Lose. Leave Our Seats." Cal
promised in 1948 that rooter con
duct would improve. There was

oven a threat to "mix" Iho root
ing sections.
The year 1032 was a hectic one |
for Big Game rooters. Calfornia
winds ripped through the Stan-;
ford rooting section before the i
game, scattering instruction
sheets and cards like confetti. By
halftime the damage was so greal
that Stanford fans had to he con
icnt with throwing the cards up !
in the air a sorry ending to the:
2(i stunts originally planned. Cal
rooters were quick to take ad
va n tage of the Indians' woes.
From across iho stadium they
taunted. "No banner, no card
stunts, no football team."
Look W ho's Talking
Stanford replied. "Why aren't j
YOU in the Rose Bowl?"
Why weren't we. for that mat
tor?
"Boorishness by iho Calfornia
rooting -section is nothing new;
suffice il to say that the same :
old things are going on," said a j
195.i Stanford Review. During the ,
Axe presentation that year (Stan- j
ford's first victory in nine years) j
a sullen Cal rooting section
hurled a few milk cartons, apples,
empty beer cans, eggs and cards
into the Stanford ranks on the j
turf below.

tion this year?

TIIE FAMOUS EXPANDING "S" CARD STUNT — HALFTIME HIGH LIGHT
Stanford C Willi Originating Rooting Section Card Stunts
As would tie expected. Stanford
rooters are often credited with
being the first in the nation to
perform stunts in the bleachers
between halves of a football
game.
The man credited with starting
all this is Thomas Jewell, civil en
gineer from Burhank who was
a graduate student at Stanford
in 1904-05. "J saw a great blotch
of red in the bleachers, resulting
from the rioters' rod hats," Jew
ell says,"and it occurred to me
that il would be possible to work
out the block letter 'S' in white."
But the story of rooters' stunts
goes back to 1899 when 300 car
dinal vests were ordered for Big
Game. Rooters wearing the vests
constituted the front and nucleus
of the Stanford section.
Nice Try, Cal
Hoffman. Rothehild and Coe of
San Francisco, who made the car
dinal vests, were also approached
by representatives of the Univer
sity of Calfornia at Berkeley stu
dent body regarding an order
for blue and gold vests for their
rooting section. However", Cal's
attempt at "originality" was met
with failure. The firm refused to
enter into any contract with the
Berkeley stunents, and informed
them that the idea of wearing
college vests had originated .it
Stanford.

The true beginning of card
stunts was in i904 when Stanford
rooters formed a block white "S"
by rooters donning cooks' caps
and coat-s. Stanford also liber ated
snow-white pigeons with cardinal
ribbons streaming from their
legs.
Original Finally
The sum total of Cal's 1905
rooting stunts consisted of root
ers in dark blue hats with wide
yellow bands waving long -strips
of gold bunting.
Calfornia finally managed to
ge< an original idea in 1906 when
the extremely clever Bear rooters
sent up fireworks which released
paper balloons and parachutes.
Stanford had two homing pigeons
which flew around the field and
then returned to the Stanford
side.
Stanford advanced the progress
of card stunts a little further
when, in 1907, the letters "LSJU"
were formed by the white-draped
rooters in the middle of the Car
dinal i"ed. Cal tried to imitate us
when, in 1909, its rooters sat in
alternate rows of blue and yel
low. In 1910 the rooters formed
an axe in blue with a golden "C"
in the middle.
Stanford again outdid Cal in
1920. On a field of white appeared
a neat little coffin with a yellow
"C" while the band played a fu

l neral dirge. Then a giant crim
son axe was formed.
At the end of the first half,
after a series of whistles and
frantic instructions from the ri
val yell leaders, ihe two sections
got under way with their bleacher
i stunts. The Bears spelled out
their school's name in gold let
ters on a blue background, then
I flashed a replica of the Golden
Bear. It looked more like an ant
\ eater, said the Daily Palo Alto.

tion contained 2200 students. The
biggest innovation was a moving

rows of seats at Stanford sta

TIIE FAMOUS EXPANDING "S" CARD STUNT — HALFTIME HIGH LIGHT
Stanford C Willi Originating Rooting Section Card Stunts
As would tie expected. Stanford
rooters are often credited with
being the first in the nation to
perform stunts in the bleachers
between halves of a football
game.
The man credited with starting
all this is Thomas Jewell, civil en
gineer from Burhank who was
a graduate student at Stanford
in 1904-05. "J saw a great blotch
of red in the bleachers, resulting
from the rioters' rod hats," Jew
ell says,"and it occurred to me
that il would be possible to work
out the block letter 'S' in white."
But the story of rooters' stunts
goes back to 1899 when 300 car
dinal vests were ordered for Big
Game. Rooters wearing the vests
constituted the front and nucleus
of the Stanford section.
Nice Try, Cal
Hoffman. Rothehild and Coe of
San Francisco, who made the car
dinal vests, were also approached
by representatives of the Univer
sity of Calfornia at Berkeley stu
dent body regarding an order
for blue and gold vests for their
rooting section. However", Cal's
attempt at "originality" was met
with failure. The firm refused to
enter into any contract with the
Berkeley stunents, and informed
them that the idea of wearing
college vests had originated .it
Stanford.

The true beginning of card
stunts was in i904 when Stanford
rooters formed a block white "S"
by rooters donning cooks' caps
and coat-s. Stanford also liber ated
snow-white pigeons with cardinal
ribbons streaming from their
legs.
Original Finally
The sum total of Cal's 1905
rooting stunts consisted of root
ers in dark blue hats with wide
yellow bands waving long -strips
of gold bunting.
Calfornia finally managed to
ge< an original idea in 1906 when
the extremely clever Bear rooters
sent up fireworks which released
paper balloons and parachutes.
Stanford had two homing pigeons
which flew around the field and
then returned to the Stanford
side.
Stanford advanced the progress
of card stunts a little further
when, in 1907, the letters "LSJU"
were formed by the white-draped
rooters in the middle of the Car
dinal i"ed. Cal tried to imitate us
when, in 1909, its rooters sat in
alternate rows of blue and yel
low. In 1910 the rooters formed

sity of Calfornia at Berkeley stu
dent body regarding an order
for blue and gold vests for their
rooting section. However", Cal's
attempt at "originality" was met
with failure. The firm refused to
enter into any contract with the
Berkeley stunents, and informed
them that the idea of wearing
college vests had originated .it
Stanford.

The true beginning of card
stunts was in i904 when Stanford
rooters formed a block white "S"
by rooters donning cooks' caps
and coat-s. Stanford also liber ated
snow-white pigeons with cardinal
ribbons streaming from their
legs.
Original Finally
The sum total of Cal's 1905
rooting stunts consisted of root
ers in dark blue hats with wide
yellow bands waving long -strips
of gold bunting.
Calfornia finally managed to
ge< an original idea in 1906 when
the extremely clever Bear rooters
sent up fireworks which released
paper balloons and parachutes.
Stanford had two homing pigeons
which flew around the field and
then returned to the Stanford
side.
Stanford advanced the progress
of card stunts a little further
when, in 1907, the letters "LSJU"
were formed by the white-draped
rooters in the middle of the Car
dinal i"ed. Cal tried to imitate us
when, in 1909, its rooters sat in
alternate rows of blue and yel
low. In 1910 the rooters formed
an axe in blue with a golden "C"
in the middle.
Stanford again outdid Cal in
1920. On a field of white appeared
a neat little coffin with a yellow
"C" while the band played a fu

l neral dirge. Then a giant crim
son axe was formed.
At the end of the first half,
after a series of whistles and
frantic instructions from the ri
val yell leaders, ihe two sections
got under way with their bleacher
i stunts. The Bears spelled out
their school's name in gold let
ters on a blue background, then
I flashed a replica of the Golden
Bear. It looked more like an ant
\ eater, said the Daily Palo Alto.
: but nobody minded.
A novel stunt by Cal in 193,3
; was a facsimile of the Daily Cal
fornian bearing the bold dreamer
"BEARS FAVORED." The Stan
ford Daily followed in facsimile
in the Stanford section and pro
! claimed: "CARDS WIN. RETAIN
' AXE."
Women!
i In 1939. for the first time in
history, women participated in
card stunts. The entire stunt sec
tion contained 2200 students. The
biggest innovation was a moving
stunt a large Stanford Indian
waving his hand in greeting to
Berkeley rooters.
In 1917 Cal rooters tore up two
rows of seats at Stanford sta
dium, disregarding a Stanford
cai'd stunt which pleaded "Win or
Lose. Leave Our Seats." Cal
promised in 1948 that rooter con
duct would improve. There was

oven a threat to "mix" Iho root
ing sections.
The year 1032 was a hectic one |
for Big Game rooters. Calfornia
winds ripped through the Stan-;
ford rooting section before the i
game, scattering instruction
sheets and cards like confetti. By
halftime the damage was so greal
that Stanford fans had to he con
icnt with throwing the cards up !
in the air a sorry ending to the:
2(i stunts originally planned. Cal
rooters were quick to take ad
va n tage of the Indians' woes.
From across iho stadium they
taunted. "No banner, no card
stunts, no football team."
Look W ho's Talking
Stanford replied. "Why aren't j
YOU in the Rose Bowl?"
Why weren't we. for that mat
tor?
"Boorishness by iho Calfornia
rooting -section is nothing new;
suffice il to say that the same :
old things are going on," said a j
195.i Stanford Review. During the ,
Axe presentation that year (Stan- j
ford's first victory in nine years) j
a sullen Cal rooting section
hurled a few milk cartons, apples,
empty beer cans, eggs and cards
into the Stanford ranks on the j
turf below.
What about Cal's rooting sec
tion this year?
What rooting section?
