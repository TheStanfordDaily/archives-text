# Daily's Stout-Hearted Men Once Again Ready to Slaughter Cal in Ink Bowl Tilt
## 
### 
By taking a mere c u r so r y
glance at today's Daily you may
get the mistaken impression that
one or two staff members of the
Peninsula's Only Morning may
be even slightly interested in
what goes on in the Stadium to
morrow starting at about 2 p.m
However, should this idea have
come to mind, you would be oh
so sadly mistaken.
Tomorrow is the Big Game all
right . . . for the stalwart mem
bers of the Daily staff. Big-time
varsities be hanged; tomorrow is
the Ink Bowl!
At 10 a.m.. when the varsity is
downing a breakfast of steak and
eggs (sort of commanding a
meal type thing), the male mem
bers of the Daily staff will line
up in mortal combat against
whatever semblance of a football
team the newspaper representing
that school across the pond can
muster.
Daily Leads
Kindly allow us to run down
the modern history of that all
important event, the most hal
lowed in the annals of intercolle
giate competition.
Since 1952 the mighty men
from The Daily have stacked up
a formidable 5-2 record.
In '52 The Daily started its list
of wins with an 18-7 triumph over
the Bear scribes. Stanford's bruis
ing line thwarted Cal attempts

j again and again as the Indians
' tolled to an easy win.
Then came the tragic year of
1953. The Daily lost. Alumni |
i threatened to fire the coach. Har
; old Tribune, if he didn't start pro
> hieing. Coeds were reported to
I be jumping off I-loover Tower.
'Lake La g un i t a boiled over.
| Gloom reigned at the Farm.
Cowardly Cal
The next year, 1954, changed
j everything. The Daily won, 18-0.
; and there's no lelling what the
' score would have been had the
j cowardly cads from Cal not quit

at the end of the first half. The
Indians were just beginning to
| roll as the half ended. The first
game ever to see one team score
100 points was at hand, only to be
marred by the chickening out of
, the opponents.
In 1955 The Daily again massa
cred. the Calfornians by the gi

gantic score of 16-7. In '56 they
lost for the second and last time.
Stanford threatened to break off
athletic relationships between the
two organs of the press as Cal's
star guard "Dirty Dan" McElbow
was thrown out of the game for
puncturing the football. The pig
skin required skin-grafting and
13 stitche-s.
The issue was hotly discussed
in the papers with tlie final re
sult being that the guilty one was
watched closely in his final year
of eligibility. McElbow went on
to make the All-Publications team
and to a distinguished career in
'ho pro ranks with the Los Ange
les Looking Glass Times.
Return to Victory
In 1957, Stanford's mammoth
defense stopped Cal for a safety
and recorded a thrilling 8-7 home
field victory. Last season The
Daily prevailed again.
As Cal hid safely behind its
own rules for one half, Stanford
toyed with the outclassed foe.
Then a second-half explosion pro
pelled the Cardinal to a 13-7 vic
tory and only the merciful sound
ing of the final gun saved the
Daily Calfornian from what cer
â€¢ainly would have been the most
humiliating defeat in journalistic
history.
A crowd of 120,000 is expected
at the practice field tomorrow
morning to watch the eighth re
newal of the Ink Bowl. The game
has been a sell-out for weeks, but
the stadium seats only 500 so
there will be standing room for
all.
