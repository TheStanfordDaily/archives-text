# Bigwig and Barrister Bowls Help Show Card Superiority
## 
### 
The Bigwig Bowl and the Bar- j
rister Bowl head a list of more
that will be played this weekend
just as they are every Big Game
f han a dozen "little big games"
weekend.
And although Calfornia often
f riumphs over Stanford on the
field of varsity endeavor, Stan-j
ford has a fine margin of victory
on the student of "just plain stu
lent" endeavor—proving a point
)nce again.
Lawmakers Clash
The Bigwig Bowl is the annual ,
•lash between the legislatures of
he two universities. Stanford this
/ear will have the added advant-!
ige of having the editor of The
)aily on the roster. Last season,
he editor wanted to get into the
name, but NCAA rules wouldn't
dlow her to play.
The Barrister Bowl is the law
school game. This is an annual
slaughter — Stanford over Cal.
Partially responsible for this
happy state of affairs is the fact

lhat Stanford's team is usually
beefed up by former gridders.
In addition, a number of fra
ternities have games between
Stanford and Cal chapters, with
Ihe greater number of victories,
again, going to Stanford.
Tougher Students
You see, varsity games just
show which school has the most
money to pay its athletes. These
"little games" prove which has
students of the tougher stock.
A game that was destined to
become one of the classics of Big
Game day had to be cancelled this
year. That was a proposed clash
between the women of The Stan
ford Daily and of the Daily Cal
fornian.
Stanford had a tremendous
team lined up, including some of
the finest potential linewomen
on campus. Calfornia however
found only one volunteer for its
lineup. And she was pregnant.
