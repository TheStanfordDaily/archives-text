# Elliott High on Split-T
## 
### Art Robinson 
It is certainly no coincidence
that Calfornia's Bears use the
Split -T offense, for the Bear
coaching staff of Pete Elliott, Dee
Andros, Gene Stauber. Buck Mc-
Phail, Bill Taylor, Bobby Hern
don, and Mike White have been
well-schooled in its use through
out their careers.
Head Coach Pete Elliott is re
garded by many as football's
"young Bud Wilkinson," for El
liott firmly believes in the Split-T
that Wilkinson has made so popu
lar at Oklahoma and has faith
fully taught it at Calfornia.
Coached Nebraska
A great many of Elliott's fellow
coaches came with Pete to Calfor
nia from Nebraska, where he
coached the 1956 season for the
Cornhuskers.
The University of Oklahoma
seems to have been the spawning
ground of Elliott's Split-T notions
though, as he spent five years
coaching under the great Bud
Wilkinson.
More than half of the Cal staff
has at one time or another been
associated with Oklahoma, and
this is no doubt a primary reason
for the Bears sticking with the
difficult-to-install Split-T.
Youngest Ever
Pete Elliott has a long line of
football experience behind him,
but despite his long tour of duty
in the football wars, he is the
youngest head football coach in
the Bears' long history.
Elliott comes from a football

family, and it is only natural that
he should continue the family
tradition.
His father was a star athlete
at Illinois Wesleyan and was
later head basketball and assist
ant football coach at Northwest
ern University.
Elliott began where his father
left off and immediately became

: a star at hlete in high school.
After a hitch in the navy, Elliott
â– enrolled at the University of
Michigan, where he proceeded to
become the first twelve-letter man
in Michigan history, starring in
football, basketball, and golf.
In addition, Elliott was out
standing academically as he grad
uated from Michigan with honors
in 1949 and just missed being se
lected to Phi Beta Kappa.
After graduating, Elliott im
mediately went to Oregon State
as an end coach for two years.
Thereupon, he was called to Okla
homa and a five year apprentice
ship under Wilkinson.
To Nebraska
In 1906 Elliott was selected
head coach at Nebraska, where he
coached until coming to Calfornia
in 1957. It was at Nebraska that
Elliott picked up most of his pres
ent coaching crew.
Dee Andros was one of the first
men Elliott brought with him to
Calfornia. and is presently the
line coach for the Bears.
Andros starred in football at
Oklahoma from 1946 through
1949 and was an honorable men
tion All-American his last year.
He put in coaching tours at Texas
Tech, Kansas, and Nebraska be
fore he came to the Bears with
Pete Elliott.
Gene Stauber is the Bears'
chief scout and defensive back
field coarh. An alumnus of the
University of Toledo. Stauber
graduated in 1947 after starring
at fullback for three years.
Before coming to Calfornia. he

saw coaching duty at Toledo,
Delaware, Idaho, and Nebraska.
Buck McPhail, the offensive
backfield coach of the Bear staff,
has been called one of the bright
est football stars to ever come out
of Oklahoma. He was an All-
American selection his junior
year and lead the Sooners for
three years, 1950-1952.
After seeing service with the
Baltimore Colts, the Army, and
the Oklahoma coaching staff,
McPhail has settled at Cal.
Bill Taylor, Calfornia's end
coach, was a coaching "team
mate" of Elliott's at Nebraska.
After four years of football cam
paigning, Taylor stayed on to
coach at his Alma Mater and
moved to Calfornia with Elliott.
Rambler Coach
Bobby Herndon, the Bears' as
sistant coach, is in charge of the
Ramblers (the Calfornia JV team)
and assists with the varsity.
Another product of Oklahoma,
Herndon played halfback for
three years with the Sooners and
coached one campaign of frosh
football. Graduating in 1956, he
entered the Navy and afterwards
came to Calfornia.
Mike White is the sole home
grown member of the Bear
coaching staff. Called one of UC's
most versatile athletes, he let
tered in football, track, rugby,
and JV basketball.
