# Fearless Forecast Farm's Fall
## 
### 
Picking a winner in THIS Big
Game is really "guts ball." Of
course every one of these annuals
is usually anyone's guess, but
how do you pick a game which, in
the words of a big city journalist,
"neither team should win."
Nevertheless, the expert predic
tions men (and just a few who
aren't) have not let us down. With
some for the Red and some for
the blue and -some who would not
be pinned down, here are this
year's Big Game prognostications.
DICK FKIENDLM'II, San Fran
cisco Chronicle, "This pains me
muchly (the woes of being a
Farm grad after a lousy season),
but after UCLA, I have to. Cal
fornia 18, Stanford 14. Cal run
ners will have too much power
for the Indian defense, but In
dians will pass heap good."
DON SKI-BY, San Francisco
Kxajniner, ". . . expert opinion is
more worthless than usual this
year. Nonetheless ... I like Stan
ford by about 23-21; in this game
sentiment is as good a basis for
selection as any other." (The
woods are full of SU alums.)

SID ZIFF, Los Angeles Mirror-
News, "Stanford is resourceful
but without the semblance of a
defense. Calfornia is powerful
without the semblance of variety
. . . I wouldn't bet on Stanford
which forces me to pick Calfornia
and I shudder to back a team that
has no more variety in its offense
than Ihe Bears."
BILL K A KTOZI AN, well
known Stanford nmlergrad, "Fin
al score of the annual 'Large
Game'; Stanford 96, Calfornia 27.
J. E. WALLACE STERLING,
President of Stanford, Stanford
24, UC 16.
BUM I' ELLIOTT, Head Coach,
University of Michigan, ". . . due
to my relationship with the
coach of Calfornia (an outstand
ing brother act here) it would be
unfair to predict what the results
will be."
MAXWELL STILES, Los An
geles Mirror-News, "Calfornia:
19-13."
PAUL ZIMMERMAN, Los An
geles Times, "Stanford has the
finest passing combination in the
Nation and everything points to

a weak pass defense by Calfornia.
Stanford, on the other hand,
doesn't seem to be able to stop a
running attack which is all Cal
fornia has. Therefore, this should
be a high scoring football game
.. . probably about 35-28 in favor
of Stanford that is."
BILL BARNES, Head Football
Coach, UCLA, upon being in
formed that the game is being
played at Stanford. "1 guess I'll
have to lake Stanford." Pretty
charitable since his Bruins only
sneaked past the Bears 19-12
while giving the Indians their
worst pasting of the year.
HERB CAEN, San Francisco
Chronicle Columnist and man
about the city, says that Stanford
will win 20-7 unless Cal pulls its

out 14-13.
NANC Y YOUNG, red-hot Stan
ford ponvpon girl, "I think we'll
win. If Stanford plays up to po
tential . . . they will win 21-8."
It seems like the MeKeevers
aren't opening their mail these
days. As a mat er of fact neither
are many other football players.
The Washington State contin
gent came through, however, and
two of their stars see Big Game
like this:
KEITH LINCOLN, WSU
back, "Personally, I feel this
game should be rated a toss up,
but since you've pu ( me on the
spot, I see it . . . Stanford 20-
j Calfornia 14.
GAII, COG DILL, fleet Cougar

i end, "Stanford 28-Calfornia 14."
Picking a winner in THIS Big
Game is really "guts ball." Of
course every one of these annuals
is usually anyone's guess, but
how do you pick a game which, in
the words of a big city journalist,
"neither team should win."
Nevertheless, the expert predic
tions men (and just a few who
aren't) have not let us down. With
some for the Red and some for
the blue and -some who would not
be pinned down, here are this
year's Big Game prognostications.
DICK FKIENDLM'II, San Fran
cisco Chronicle, "This pains me
muchly (the woes of being a
Farm grad after a lousy season),
but after UCLA, I have to. Cal
fornia 18, Stanford 14. Cal run
ners will have too much power
for the Indian defense, but In
dians will pass heap good."
DON SKI-BY, San Francisco
Kxajniner, ". . . expert opinion is
more worthless than usual this
year. Nonetheless ... I like Stan
ford by about 23-21; in this game
sentiment is as good a basis for
selection as any other." (The
woods are full of SU alums.)

SID ZIFF, Los Angeles Mirror-
News, "Stanford is resourceful
but without the semblance of a
defense. Calfornia is powerful
without the semblance of variety
. . . I wouldn't bet on Stanford
which forces me to pick Calfornia
and I shudder to back a team that
has no more variety in its offense
than Ihe Bears."
BILL K A KTOZI AN, well
known Stanford nmlergrad, "Fin
al score of the annual 'Large
Game'; Stanford 96, Calfornia 27.
J. E. WALLACE STERLING,
President of Stanford, Stanford
24, UC 16.
BUM I' ELLIOTT, Head Coach,
University of Michigan, ". . . due
to my relationship with the
coach of Calfornia (an outstand
ing brother act here) it would be
unfair to predict what the results
will be."
MAXWELL STILES, Los An
geles Mirror-News, "Calfornia:
19-13."
PAUL ZIMMERMAN, Los An
geles Times, "Stanford has the
finest passing combination in the
Nation and everything points to

a weak pass defense by Calfornia.
Stanford, on the other hand,
doesn't seem to be able to stop a
running attack which is all Cal
fornia has. Therefore, this should
be a high scoring football game
.. . probably about 35-28 in favor
of Stanford that is."
BILL BARNES, Head Football
Coach, UCLA, upon being in
formed that the game is being
played at Stanford. "1 guess I'll
have to lake Stanford." Pretty
charitable since his Bruins only
sneaked past the Bears 19-12
while giving the Indians their
worst pasting of the year.
HERB CAEN, San Francisco
Chronicle Columnist and man
about the city, says that Stanford
will win 20-7 unless Cal pulls its

out 14-13.
NANC Y YOUNG, red-hot Stan
ford ponvpon girl, "I think we'll
win. If Stanford plays up to po
tential . . . they will win 21-8."
It seems like the MeKeevers
aren't opening their mail these
days. As a mat er of fact neither
are many other football players.
The Washington State contin
gent came through, however, and
two of their stars see Big Game
like this:
KEITH LINCOLN, WSU
back, "Personally, I feel this
game should be rated a toss up,
but since you've pu ( me on the
spot, I see it . . . Stanford 20-
j Calfornia 14.
