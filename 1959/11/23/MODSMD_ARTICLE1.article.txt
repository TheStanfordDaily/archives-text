# Cal Retains Axe with 20-17 Victory
## 90,000 See Time Run Out On Driving Indian Eleven Daily Sports 
### John Schwarz, Sports Editor 
Battling the clock, the University of California, and two million
little kids descending on the field, Stanford's 1959 football team lost
its season finale 20-17 to California's Golden Bears as a last minute
Card drive died on the Cal three yard line when the final gun
sounded. Needless to say the axe case in the Stanford Cellar will
emain empty for another year.
Trailing 20-17 with 3:30 to go in the game, Stanford's Indians
proceeded on a last ditch drive from their own 45 yard line which
was to see them reach Cal's three yard line only to have time run
out on them.
The closing minute of the game with Card gridders scrambling
;et off plays and Cal players trying desperately to halt the India
\iarges gave the 90,000 fans in Stanford Stadium a more spine ting
ng production of "beat the clock" than they'll ever see on 4 e'e
vision.
Card quarterback Dick Norman, who played one of the most
sensational games college football has ever seen, ironically was
stopped three yards short of the winning touchdown on the last play
of the game. Norman gained 366 yards total offense in the game
but it was three too few.
"The trouble with these Big Games," remarked assistant Stanford
football coach Dan Stavely after the Indian loss, "is that they're too
much like your wife's relatives—too close." However, Saturday's
Cal three point victory was practically a runaway scoreboardwise
compared to recent Big Games. In fact the three point margin was
the greatest in a Big Game since 1955 when the Indians led by John
Brodie defeated Cal 19-0. In 1956 the margin was two points 20-18, in
1957 the margin was also two points 14-12, and last year the spread
was a mere point 16-15.
Saturday's game turned out to be a seesaw battle with each team
gaining renewed every time it appeared doomed to defeat. As
Card halfback Rick McMillen put it "neither team seemed to play
well until it was placed in the underdog role."
Cal entered the game a four point underdog but with the accurate,
or perhaps its better to say near perfect passing, of quarterback
Wayne Crow and the sensational receiving of Gael Barsotti rolled
up a fourteen point lead in the first quarter and a half of play. Never
rated as much of a passing threat, Cal's Crow succeeded in fooling
the experts as well as the Stanford secondary and completed his
first nine passing attempts. He didn't throw an incomplete heave
until ten minutes had elapsed in the third quarter. Crow wound up
the day completing 9 of 13 for 158 yards and two touchdowns.
After falling behind by two touchdowns Dick Norman rallied
his Stanford teammates in their first sustained drive near the end
of the first half. The Indians took the ball on their own 37 after
Cal kicked off and headed goalward. However, with only a short time
remaining in the half and the sudden appearance of referees on the
scene, Stanford was doomed to frustration. The game turned into a
one against three battle with Stanford playing Cal, the clock, and the
referees.
Odd as it seems Stanford covered 132 yards in this first half
drive but only 60 of them made the record books. Four penalties
nullified the other gains. It took Stanford 15 trys to get one first
down in the drive. When all the penalties had been sorted out and
the clock came to rest at half time, Stanford was inside the Cal five
but were not able to score.
Once the Indians became definite underdogs as it appeared at
the start of the third quarter they bounced back to even the score.
Norman picked out one receiver after another and before Cal knew
what happened the score was tied.
The refs switched allegiance in the second half and became a
vital aid to Stanford's defense thwarting at least two Cal drives
with fifteen yard penalties.
The fourth quarter found Stanford still in command as the
