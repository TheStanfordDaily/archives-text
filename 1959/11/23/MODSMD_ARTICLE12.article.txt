# Curtice Praises Team For Not Accepting Tie
## 
### Roy Schmidt 
It was a matter of seconds and inches that denied Jack Curtice
and his Indians the joy of ending this rather lean season on a happy
note.
The Indians, who dropped the 62nd renewal of the traditional
Big Game spectacle 20-17 Saturday, found the stadium clock as

formidable an enemy as the in
spired Cal team. Father Time
caught the threatening Indians
on the Cal three yard line and
prevented what would certainly
have been the winning TD.
"I was proud of the boys for
going for it," praised Cactus Jack.
"That's what I believe in, for the
winner. Face could have kicked
that field goal backwards. It
would have been no gamble at
all."
Tried for Sideline
Quarterback Dick Norman ex
plained that fateful, game-ending
play in which he was nailed just
inches in bounds on the four yard
line. "It was basically a pass
with three possible receivers."
Seeing none of them open, the
big quarterback started around
l ight end and fought his way for
five yards. "I knew I couldn't
go all the way; I tried to get out
of bounds."
The rest is history. The team
lined up for a quick field goal
attempt, but the gun went off
before the ball was snapped.
The team ran themselves,"
said Curtice, "and they did a real
good job. Cal surprised me when
they came back after we went
ahead 17-14. I felt our defense
was going well and we could hold
them."
Curtice said he was proud of
his own boys for coming back the
way they did after trailing 14-0.
Everytime either team was be
hind they really fought to get
hack in the game, noted Indian
fullback Rick McMillen. Mc-
Millen, one of 14 Stanford seniors
who ended their collegiate foot
ball careers Saturday, was praised
by Curtice for his fine offensive
play.
The Indians were hurt badly
in the first half when they were
penalized 65 yards. Four of these
infractions came on one drive in
which Stanford ran 15 plays be
fore getting a first down.
Kef's Judgment
"You can penalize any team on
any play for illegal use of hands,"
commented Curtice. "It's merely
up to the referees' judgment. I
wouldn't say anything about an
official if we were penalized 750
yards. They try their best to give
everybody a fair shake."
California surprised the In
dians in the first half with its
sharp passing attack. Quarter
back Wayne Crow completed
eight for eight in the first half,
sparking his team to its early 14-0
lead.
"Everybody seems to get hot
passing aaginst us," noted Curt
ice. An adjustment in defense
stopped them in the second half,
he added. The statistics bear this
out, for Crow completed only one
of four in the second half, and
Ken Meade, a converted halfback
had his only attempt intercepted.
Norman Stars
Curtice was justifiably pleased
with his own quarterback's per
formance. Norman played his
greatest game as an Indian, break
ing the NCAA total passing yard
age record with 401. The tall
junior completed 34 of 39 for a
near perfect afternoon. "Dick did
all a fellow could do," Curtice
said. "Yes, I think he should be an
All-Ameriean."
Norman's 34 completions was
also a NCAA record. The old
mark was 33 set by Loyola's Don
Klosterman back in 1951. Kloster
man hit on 33 of 63. Norman's
.872 completion percentage was
the highest ever recorded by a
college passer with more than 20
passes in a .single game. The old
passing yardage record was held
by Ted Marchibroda of Detroit
who passed for 390 yards in a
game back in 1952.
"From the spectator standpoint
it was quite a game," commented
Cactus Jack. "I can see why we
draw 90,000. Maybe someday
we'll get on the other side of the
score," added the colorful coach
as he ran his hand through his
gray, thinning hair. Somehow it
seemed a little grayer and a little
thinner after this one.


SKIP FACE
Could lie have tied it?
