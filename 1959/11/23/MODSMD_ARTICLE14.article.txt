Random thoughts, brought on and grouped togetlier by Satur
day's Big Game:
• The biggest of possible congratulations to Bill Kartozian
for his brilliant job of veil-leading during the '59 football season.
He's the only yell-leader in our four years here (and probably
longer) who had the stands with him all the way. He's the onK
one we've known who could have gotten Stanford rooters to pro
duce the excellent display of sportsmanship and support seen
after Saturday's loss. True, there have been complaints—prin
cipally from alumni who don't like Kartozian as compared with
the golden a<j;e of yell-leading. But these persons should realize
that it's not the golden a<re of red-hot-ism at Stanford any more.
To have a yell leader who could get a non-red-hot school to pro
duce the kind of support Stanford has given this year is a stroke
of good fortune. Stanford was darned luck) to have Bill Kartozian
as its bead yell leader.
• It could hardly be called a great season. And a 3-7 record
doesn't even offer much justification for calling it a good season.
But Jack Curtice and Team certainly produced an interesting
and exciting year. Stanford will never have many winning seasons
as long as it competes on an unequal basis with the semi-pros and
pros. But we'd rather watch a flashy Stanford team in a spec
tacular loss than a four-yards-at-a-time midwest elephant team
that wins most of its games.
• We nearly choked when we read Art Rosenbauin's column
in Sunday's Chronicle. He said "The Cal students have taken a
beating through the years for improper language and, within
their own ranks, for apathy. No Cal section was as well behaved,
as happy, and as vocal as this one." Mr. Rosenhaum must not
have seen the steady barrage of flip cards, water bags, lunch sacks,
frozen orange cartons, and other assorted garbage that Cal stu
dents threw at Stanford season ticket holders in the next section.
Oddlv enough, this barrage got going full blast when Stanford
tied the game. Rosenbaum must not have seen the woman who
was taken from the stands with her eye damaged by a flying card.
And he also didn't see the group of Cal <iirls who, during one of
the morning "bowl" games, tried to start a brawl with a group of
Stanford women. Integration may have helped the Cal section a
bit—but as far as we're concerned, they have been, still are, and
probably will continue to be, one of the most obnoxious rooting
sections in collegiate football.
• The kids problem wasn't as bad at this Big Game as in 19r>7.
But there were still plenty of people on the field who didn't
belong there before the end of the game. After the game, we were
talking to some spectators who were seated right near the point
where Norman was stopped on the last play. We asked them how
the play looked, and they replied that they could hardly see it
because of all the people on the running track and edge of the
field. We ask again that the athletic department get into action
and clear up the end-of-game chaos that has become a trademark
of Stanford football.

To have a yell leader who could get a non-red-hot school to pro
duce the kind of support Stanford has given this year is a stroke
of good fortune. Stanford was darned luck) to have Bill Kartozian
as its bead yell leader.
• It could hardly be called a great season. And a 3-7 record
doesn't even offer much justification for calling it a good season.
But Jack Curtice and Team certainly produced an interesting
and exciting year. Stanford will never have many winning seasons
as long as it competes on an unequal basis with the semi-pros and
pros. But we'd rather watch a flashy Stanford team in a spec
tacular loss than a four-yards-at-a-time midwest elephant team
that wins most of its games.
• We nearly choked when we read Art Rosenbauin's column
in Sunday's Chronicle. He said "The Cal students have taken a
beating through the years for improper language and, within
their own ranks, for apathy. No Cal section was as well behaved,
as happy, and as vocal as this one." Mr. Rosenhaum must not
have seen the steady barrage of flip cards, water bags, lunch sacks,
frozen orange cartons, and other assorted garbage that Cal stu
dents threw at Stanford season ticket holders in the next section.
Oddlv enough, this barrage got going full blast when Stanford
tied the game. Rosenbaum must not have seen the woman who
was taken from the stands with her eye damaged by a flying card.
And he also didn't see the group of Cal <iirls who, during one of
the morning "bowl" games, tried to start a brawl with a group of
Stanford women. Integration may have helped the Cal section a
bit—but as far as we're concerned, they have been, still are, and
probably will continue to be, one of the most obnoxious rooting
sections in collegiate football.
• The kids problem wasn't as bad at this Big Game as in 19r>7.
But there were still plenty of people on the field who didn't
belong there before the end of the game. After the game, we were
talking to some spectators who were seated right near the point
where Norman was stopped on the last play. We asked them how
the play looked, and they replied that they could hardly see it
because of all the people on the running track and edge of the
field. We ask again that the athletic department get into action
and clear up the end-of-game chaos that has become a trademark
of Stanford football.
Random thoughts, brought on and grouped togetlier by Satur
day's Big Game:
• The biggest of possible congratulations to Bill Kartozian
for his brilliant job of veil-leading during the '59 football season.
He's the only yell-leader in our four years here (and probably
longer) who had the stands with him all the way. He's the onK
one we've known who could have gotten Stanford rooters to pro
duce the excellent display of sportsmanship and support seen
after Saturday's loss. True, there have been complaints—prin
cipally from alumni who don't like Kartozian as compared with
the golden a<j;e of yell-leading. But these persons should realize
that it's not the golden a<re of red-hot-ism at Stanford any more.
