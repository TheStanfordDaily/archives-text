# TALKING ABOUT
## Big Game Spirit 
### Doug Willis 
A lot of the old grads around
the campus this last weekend
have commented on the terrific
revival of school spirit at Stan
ford for this year's Big Game.
Two successful non-damaging
raids were conducted against the
Berkeley campus last week. One
made the "Big C" into a "Big S"
and the other draped a 100 foot
Beat Cal banner from the Campa
nile. The traditional Bearial, an
event that usually draws about 50
people drew closer to 300.
"There is more spirit this
year than I've seen since about
1950," commented one Stanford
alumnus during half-time.
Another alumnus observed that
Stanford's post game conduct was
"the finest thing I've seen at Stan
ford for many years. I was really
proud to see the rooters stay in
the stands so long after the
game."
There was a lot more spirit this
year, said many students, "but
the only thing that I can think of
that was different this year to
account for the great spirit is
Kartozian's leadership," explained
one. "Everyone will do what he
asks, so he can really put things
over."
"It was a really good game,
but one of the most exciting
spots was when Kartozian led
the Axe Yell," said a Roble
freshman. "I felt like it was
something really im;H>rtant
when he put on the head yell
leader's jacket."
A fra'ernity brother of yell
leader Bill Kartozian said that he
couldn't think of any other reason
for the success of Big Game Week
activities than Kartozian. "His
leadership made it,"he said. "Ac
tually, people don't know what a
job he had done. He isn't just
fooling around, he has taken the
job seriously and really been great
at it. He was really hurt when we
lost Saturday."

Lynne Cliatterton, the mem
ber of the "Immoral 12" who
smuggled a huge Boat Cal ban
ner up to the top of the Campa
nile Thursday, said that she
thought that the possibility of
getting the axe back this year
was the main reason for the
spirit.
"And at the game itself," Miss
Cliatterton continued, "Kartozian
was the reason for the great
spirit."
"It seems that everyone had a
lot of spirit this week," said an
other student, "The Big S at Cal
and the banner on the Campanile
were both great for school spirit,
and Kartozian did a great job all
along."
A university official com
mented that in many ways Kar
tozian has been the best yell
leader Stanford has had in
many years, but that "there is
a great gap between what he
considers good taste and the
ideas of the 'older generation.'
"He has caused us more grey
hairs than anyone in years," the
official continued, "but he also
deserves a good deal of credit for
the way he handled the rooters at
the Big Game and at the USC
game, where he did a wonderful
job of averting a possible riot.
"Kartozian has more ability in
terms of real yell leading ability
and controlling the rooters than
any yell leader we have had in
years."
Another student said that this
was the first time he had been
red-hot for Big Game in four
years. "The reason is that Kar
tozian has created such a great
atmosphere that everyone was
Interested in Big Game, even
though it was kind of meaning
less because both teams were
so bad."
"It was great this year because
of Kartozian," said another stu
dent, "but there will never be an
other Kartozian."

tually, people don't know what a
job he had done. He isn't just
fooling around, he has taken the
job seriously and really been great
at it. He was really hurt when we
lost Saturday."

Lynne Cliatterton, the mem
ber of the "Immoral 12" who
smuggled a huge Boat Cal ban
ner up to the top of the Campa
nile Thursday, said that she
thought that the possibility of
getting the axe back this year
was the main reason for the
spirit.
"And at the game itself," Miss
Cliatterton continued, "Kartozian
was the reason for the great
spirit."
"It seems that everyone had a
lot of spirit this week," said an
other student, "The Big S at Cal
and the banner on the Campanile
were both great for school spirit,
and Kartozian did a great job all
along."
A university official com
mented that in many ways Kar
tozian has been the best yell
leader Stanford has had in
many years, but that "there is
a great gap between what he
considers good taste and the
ideas of the 'older generation.'
"He has caused us more grey
hairs than anyone in years," the
official continued, "but he also
deserves a good deal of credit for
the way he handled the rooters at
the Big Game and at the USC
game, where he did a wonderful
job of averting a possible riot.
"Kartozian has more ability in
terms of real yell leading ability
and controlling the rooters than
any yell leader we have had in
years."
Another student said that this
was the first time he had been
red-hot for Big Game in four
years. "The reason is that Kar
tozian has created such a great
atmosphere that everyone was
Interested in Big Game, even
though it was kind of meaning
less because both teams were
so bad."
"It was great this year because
of Kartozian," said another stu
dent, "but there will never be an
other Kartozian."
A lot of the old grads around
the campus this last weekend
have commented on the terrific
revival of school spirit at Stan
ford for this year's Big Game.
Two successful non-damaging
raids were conducted against the
Berkeley campus last week. One
made the "Big C" into a "Big S"
and the other draped a 100 foot
Beat Cal banner from the Campa
nile. The traditional Bearial, an
event that usually draws about 50
people drew closer to 300.
"There is more spirit this
year than I've seen since about
1950," commented one Stanford
alumnus during half-time.
Another alumnus observed that
Stanford's post game conduct was
"the finest thing I've seen at Stan
ford for many years. I was really
proud to see the rooters stay in
the stands so long after the
game."
There was a lot more spirit this
year, said many students, "but
the only thing that I can think of
that was different this year to
account for the great spirit is
Kartozian's leadership," explained
one. "Everyone will do what he
asks, so he can really put things
over."
"It was a really good game,
but one of the most exciting
spots was when Kartozian led
the Axe Yell," said a Roble
freshman. "I felt like it was
something really im;H>rtant
when he put on the head yell
leader's jacket."
A fra'ernity brother of yell
leader Bill Kartozian said that he
couldn't think of any other reason
for the success of Big Game Week
activities than Kartozian. "His

tozian has created such a great
atmosphere that everyone was
Interested in Big Game, even
though it was kind of meaning
less because both teams were
so bad."
"It was great this year because
of Kartozian," said another stu
dent, "but there will never be an
other Kartozian."
A lot of the old grads around
the campus this last weekend
have commented on the terrific
revival of school spirit at Stan
ford for this year's Big Game.
Two successful non-damaging
raids were conducted against the
Berkeley campus last week. One
made the "Big C" into a "Big S"
and the other draped a 100 foot
Beat Cal banner from the Campa
nile. The traditional Bearial, an
event that usually draws about 50
people drew closer to 300.
"There is more spirit this
year than I've seen since about
1950," commented one Stanford
alumnus during half-time.
Another alumnus observed that
Stanford's post game conduct was
"the finest thing I've seen at Stan
ford for many years. I was really
proud to see the rooters stay in
the stands so long after the
game."
There was a lot more spirit this
year, said many students, "but
the only thing that I can think of
that was different this year to
account for the great spirit is
Kartozian's leadership," explained
one. "Everyone will do what he
asks, so he can really put things
over."
"It was a really good game,
but one of the most exciting
spots was when Kartozian led
the Axe Yell," said a Roble
freshman. "I felt like it was
something really im;H>rtant
when he put on the head yell
leader's jacket."
A fra'ernity brother of yell
leader Bill Kartozian said that he
couldn't think of any other reason
for the success of Big Game Week
activities than Kartozian. "His
leadership made it,"he said. "Ac
tually, people don't know what a
job he had done. He isn't just
fooling around, he has taken the
job seriously and really been great
at it. He was really hurt when we
lost Saturday."

Lynne Cliatterton, the mem
ber of the "Immoral 12" who
smuggled a huge Boat Cal ban
ner up to the top of the Campa
nile Thursday, said that she
thought that the possibility of
getting the axe back this year
was the main reason for the
spirit.
"And at the game itself," Miss
Cliatterton continued, "Kartozian
was the reason for the great
spirit."
"It seems that everyone had a
lot of spirit this week," said an
other student, "The Big S at Cal
and the banner on the Campanile
were both great for school spirit,
and Kartozian did a great job all
along."
A university official com
mented that in many ways Kar
tozian has been the best yell
leader Stanford has had in
many years, but that "there is
a great gap between what he
considers good taste and the
ideas of the 'older generation.'
"He has caused us more grey
hairs than anyone in years," the
official continued, "but he also
deserves a good deal of credit for
the way he handled the rooters at
the Big Game and at the USC
game, where he did a wonderful
job of averting a possible riot.
"Kartozian has more ability in
terms of real yell leading ability
and controlling the rooters than
any yell leader we have had in
years."
Another student said that this
was the first time he had been
red-hot for Big Game in four
years. "The reason is that Kar
tozian has created such a great
atmosphere that everyone was
Interested in Big Game, even
though it was kind of meaning
less because both teams were
so bad."
"It was great this year because
of Kartozian," said another stu
dent, "but there will never be an
other Kartozian."
