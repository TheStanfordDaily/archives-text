\\ illiam M. StifTlcr majored in mechani
ral engineering at Penn Stale University
— but he also liked economics. "I wanted
to apply engineering and economics in
business." he says, ''and have some ad
ministrative responsibilities."
Hill got bis B.S. degree in June. 1056,
and went to work with the Bell Telephone
Company of Pennsylvania at Harrisburg.
During bis first two years, he gained on
the-job experience in all departments of
the company. Since June. 1958. he's been
working on transmission engineering
projects.
Today, Bill is getting the blend of engi
neering and practical business-engineer
ing he wanted. "The economic aspects of
each project are just as important as the

technical aspects," lie says."The great
est challenge lies in finding the best solu
tion to each problem in terms of costs,
present and future needs, and new tech
nological developments.
"Another thing I like is that 1 get full
jol)-responsibilit\ . For example. 1 recently
completed plans for carrier systems be
tween Scranton and four other communi
ties which will bring Direct Distance
Dialing to customers there. The trans
mission phase of llie project involved
almost a half-million dollars—and it was
"my bab\ from terminal to terminal.
"Telephone engineering has evcrvthing
you could a*k for—training, interesting
and varied work, responsibility, and real
management opportunities."
