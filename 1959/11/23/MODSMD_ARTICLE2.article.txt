### Austin Scott 
Stanford Police Chief Gordon Davis said late yesterday that there
were no new developments concerning the death of John G. Opsahl.
The 19-year-old Stanford sophomore was run over outside his fra
ternity house late Friday night.
Police found the body at 12:16 a.m. Saturday, sprawled on the

steep, narrow driveway of
the Sigma Nu house. He was pro
nounced dead on arrival at Palo
Alto Hospital.
Stanf or d Police questioned
Stephen Crary, 20, of Tacoma,
Wash., also a Sigma Nu. Police
labeled him a "prime suspect."
Crary found Opsahl's body late
Friday and telephoned Palo Alto
police.
Crary Released
Crary has been released pend
ing further investigation. He has
admitted finding Opsahl and noti
fying police, but claims he does
not know whether or not he
actually ran over him.
The California Highway Patrol
found blood and bits of skin on
the undercarriage of Crary's car.
The white 1959 Ford has been
impounded pending further in
vestigation.
Chief Davis stated that no ar
rest or further announcement
would be made until the blood
stains and hair found under the
car are compared with those of
the victim. Samples have been
sent to the Santa Clara crime lab
in San Jose.
Together at Bonfire
Opsahl and Crary were together
at I he bonfire and the street dance
most of Friday night. Opsahl is
believed to have left the dance
about 11 p.m. and to have walked
alone towards the Sigma Nu
house. Crary drove home later.
Police theorize that Opsahl was
lying in the Sigma Nu driveway
about 50 feet up from its inter
section with Dolores Street, and
was hit by his friend's car. Crary
apparently turned into the drive
way and ran over Opsahl, break
ing his neck and .iavv.
The driver realized he had hit
someone or something and stop
ped, as indicated by three-foot

long skidmarks. Al'ler stopping ;
his car over the body, the driver !
backed up and then proceeded
around the body and up the road
way. A student in the nearby
Delta Tau Delta house said that
he heard brakes squeal about
11:45 p.m. and thought he saw a
white Ford or Chevrolet speed up
the hill.
A university spokesman said
Crary was vague about the de
tails, but had apparently driven
around the campus after the acci
dent and then returned to thej
fraternity house, where he called
police. At the time he called, he
did not say that he had run over
Opsahl. Police say the Crary had
been drinking.
Police have not yet determined
why Opsahl was lying in the
road. Indications are that he had
been drinking heavily. A search j
of his clothing revealed four driv-;
er's licences. He was arrested in !
September for purchasing beer I
under age.
