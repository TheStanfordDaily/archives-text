# ELLIOTT PRAISES INDIANS
## Stanford Passing Finest in Country' 
### Glen Alford 
The first thing that California football roach Pete Elliott said
, when he walked into the room filled with scribes of various news
! papers for the purpose of obtaining a postgame interview was,
"Gentlemen, this was probably one of the greatest games ever
played." Elliott continued, saying, "This was like last year's game,
! only more so." I â€”

Elliott was obviobsly referring
primarily to the closeness of the
score, but also to the fact that
in both this year's and last year's
Big Games, Stanford could have
played it safe and gone for the
sure tie since Skip Eace has
never missed the short conversion :
or field goal, but disdained it, and i
went for the victory.
High Praise
Elliott was lavish in his praise '
of Stanford. "Stanford is a good j
football team. No team in the
country can equal them in execu- j
lion of the forward pass. That
(Chins) Burford is a great play
er," Incidentally, Burford set a
national record with the 61 passes |
that he caught this year.
Elliott said more than a few
kind words for his own boys, lie
cited his new-found passing com
bination of Wayne Crow and Gael
Barsotti, and also sub-quarterback
Ken Meade, George Pierovieh,
sophomore fullback, Billy Pat ton,
right halfback, and tackle Erank
Sally.
Not a Surprise
California's fine passing wasn't
too much of a surprise to the
California football mentor. He
revealed that California had
worked up to half an hour a day
on the rollout pass on which
Barsotti and Pat ton caught most
of their passes. Barsotti's touch
down reception also came on a
new innovation.
The formation used by Cal
most of the game, the slot back
formation, was another innova-1
lion of the coaching staff, just ;
made expressly for Stanford.
The slotback formation was
used to enable Crow to open up '
the middle. Cal's opponents had
been closing up the center of the
line and st if fling their rushing
attack, so Elliott took precautions
to make sure it didn't happen
against Stanford.
Didn't Give l T p
The thing that made Elliott
most happy was the way his team
didn't give up after Face's field
goal. "The best thing about our
team was that when they had to j
get the last touchdown, they did
it. It gave them the confidence
they needed to withstand Stan
ford's last touchdown drive."
Now that Cal's football season
is all over, Elliott's plans include j
plenty of golf, a few shows, and i
no football.
