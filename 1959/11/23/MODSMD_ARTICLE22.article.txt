# Huskies in Rose Bowl: USS Beaten
## 
### 
In west coast football last week
end. Washington's Huskies, smell
ing roses in the air, clinched a
j bowl bid by trimming Washing
ton State 20-0 before a record
crowd of Husky supporters.
In other games, I JSC met their
! match in a stout UCLA Bruin de
fense and the officials as a pass
I interference penalty enabled the
! Uclans t-o score the only touch
down of the game and defeat the
Trojans, 10-3.
Oregon State's butter-fingered
Beavers spotted the Oregon Ducks
an early TD on a fumble and then
1 proceeded to upset the previous
j Rose Bowl minded Ducks, 15 to
j 7, at Eugene.
Schloredt Stars
Bob Schloredt, the one-eyed
Husky quarterback, passed and
ran for 1 209 yards and one touch
down to lead Washington into the
Rose Bowl against the probable
Big Ten champ, Wisconsin.
The largest football crowd in
Northwest history, 56,000. saw the
only two Washington State
threats fizzle out on an inter
! cepted pass and a missed field
| goal.
The Huskies could only mount
â–  one scoring drive in Hie first half
as one drive was ended by a Wash
ington fumble on the Cougar 20
yard stripe. But the Huskies came
back in the third quarter to score
two touchdowns and wrap up the
game.
At Los Angeles UCLA snapped
Trojan hopes for their first un
defeated, untied season since
1932 as the Bruins snapped an
eight game Trojan winning
streak.
In a highly debateable pass in
terference call, the officials gave
the Bruins the pigskin on the USC
seven yard line, and from there
fullback Ray Smith scored the
winning TD in three plays.
Tough Defenses
Neither team was able to pierce
the other's defense for more than
; a field goal until the Bruin touch
down in the fourth quarter.
Oregon State's Beavers almost
gave the Oregon Ducks a push
into the Rose Bowl as they fum
bled 'he first two times they got
the ball, but the Ducks weren't
! able to come through.
Don Kasso, the former Berke
ley High football star, led the
Beavers to their third victory of
the year by scampering IT yards
for one score and setting up
! another with a 27 yard jaunt.
