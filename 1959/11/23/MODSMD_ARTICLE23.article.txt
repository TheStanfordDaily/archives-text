# Daily Completely Outplays Weak Daily Cal in Ink Bowl
## 
### 
Only the late afternoon loss of
' Big Game dimmed the glory cast
! upon the Parm Saturday morning
j when The Stanford Daily clob
bered a hopelessly outclassed
team from the Daily Californian,
! 9-0, for its third consecutive Ink
| Bowl victory.
Tough Defense
A defense that would truly chal
lenge that of Syracuse University
completely stilled anything that
the Daily Cal optimistically at
j tempted.
First half receiving jitters by
J a group of rookie ends, over
whelmed by the magnanimity of
i the game in which they were
1 playing, were all that kept The
Daily from rolling up a huge
halftime lead and possibly caus
ing Cal to hang it up right there.
But in the second half, the ends
began to hang onto the pin-point
pitches of veteran tailback Roy
Lawson and it was a rout.
Weaver Stars
Fine catching and running by
i Parks Weaver and The Phantom
end (who must remain nameless
| at this time) kept The Daily in
Cal territory all through the sec

ond half. A disputed safety after
a pass intercept ion gave Stanford
a 2-0 load midway through the
half, and The Daily came right
back to score the clinching touch
downâ€”on a five yard pass from
Lawson to Vic Affolter.
True stalwarts of the game how
ever were The Daily's great de
fensive linemen Ray (Spider)
Harrington, Pete (Old Polks)
Grothe and Russ (What a Head)
Allen.
Allen deserves much extra men
tion for playing with a ferocious
hangover.
