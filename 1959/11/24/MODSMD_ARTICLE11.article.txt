## Cal President Amends Ruling 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (A 1 ) —
The U.N. Steering Committee
yesterday brushed aside Soviet
objections and overwhelmingly
approved a United States request
for full General Assembly debate
on conditions in Communist Hun
gary.
The Soviet Union contended
that another airing of the Hun
garian question here would de
stroy the "Spirit of Camp David."
This was a reference to the talks
last Scpterfiber between President
Eisenhower and Premier Nikita
Khrushchev on relaxation of East-
West tensions.
But U.S. Ambassador Henry
Cabot Lodge told the Assembly
nothing occurred at Camp David
"that requires us to pass by in
silence on the other side of the
street when a brutality is com
mitted.

"What is against the Spirit of
Camp David are acts which turn
a brave little country into a moan
ing colonialist slum."
Victory F< > res had owed
The vote in the powerful Steer
ing Committee was 15-3 in favor
of the U.S. proposal. The lopsided
vote foreshadowed victory when
the action comes before the 82-
nation Assembly for ratification.
Negative votes were cast by the
Soviet Union. Romania and Czech
oslovakia. Indonisia and Morocco
abstained.
Vasily V. Kuznetsov, Soviet dep
uty foreign minister, denounced
Sir Leslie Munro of New Zealand,
the U.N.'s special representative
on Hungary, as a puppet who was
performing dirty work for certain
Western circles desirous of keep
ing the cold war alive.
Special Report
Munro has prepared a special
report for the assembly on Hun
gary.
Kuznetsov described anti-Com
munists in and outside Hungary
as "monsters." He said they were
aligned with those who work
against a relaxation in interna
tional relations as evidenced by
the Eisenhower-Khrushchev talks.

Vasily V. Kuznetsov, Soviet dep
uty foreign minister, denounced
Sir Leslie Munro of New Zealand,
the U.N.'s special representative
on Hungary, as a puppet who was
performing dirty work for certain
Western circles desirous of keep
ing the cold war alive.

Munro has prepared a special
report for the assembly on Hun
gary.

tional relations as evidenced by
the Eisenhower-Khrushchev talks.
