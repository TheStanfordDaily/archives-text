## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — A key
Polish officer who may have in
side knowledge of Communist
spying operations around the
world has fled to the United
States with his family.
The State Department said yes
terday that Col. Pawel Monat
has asked asylum and that his
application to remain in
this country is being processed
in the usual manner. Officials
said Monat's request probably
will be granted.
Department Silent
Otherwise, the department was
silent about the defection of Mo
nat, who reportedly was intelli
gence chief of Polish military at
taches in embassies and other
diplomatic missions around the
globe.
In crossing over from the Com
munist world, Monat probably
brought with him considerable in
formation his strategic job gave
him about Polish military intelli
gence. Since the Soviet bloc works
so closely together, Monat may
also know much bearing on the
Soviet Union.
In acknowledging that Monat
and his family had arrived in this
country, State Deparment press
officer Lincoln White confirmed
a report carried by the N'ew York
Times yesterday.
Defection in Vienna
Writing from Vienna, Times re
porter A. M. Rosenthal said Mo
nat had turned himself over to
U.S. representatives in Vienna.
While the State Department
was vague about when Monat de
tected, .Rosenthal's story said it
happened last summer "at a time
when a crisis was brewing in Po
land."
Rosenthal wrote that Monat's
defection to the West was one of
the incidents that helped convince
Polish Communist chief Wlady
slaw Gomulka that "Communist
rule in Poland was rotting be
cause of lack of 'discipline' and
that tougher men and tougher
ways were needed."
Only recently, Rosenthal was
expelled as Times correspondent
in Poland on grounds, in the
words of a Polish official, "he had
probed too deeply into the in
ternal affairs of the country."

defection to the West was one of
the incidents that helped convince
Polish Communist chief Wlady
slaw Gomulka that "Communist
rule in Poland was rotting be
cause of lack of 'discipline' and
that tougher men and tougher
ways were needed."
Only recently, Rosenthal was
expelled as Times correspondent
in Poland on grounds, in the
words of a Polish official, "he had
probed too deeply into the in
ternal affairs of the country."
WASHINGTON (/P) — A key
Polish officer who may have in
side knowledge of Communist
spying operations around the
world has fled to the United
States with his family.
The State Department said yes
terday that Col. Pawel Monat
has asked asylum and that his
application to remain in
this country is being processed
in the usual manner. Officials
said Monat's request probably
will be granted.
Department Silent
Otherwise, the department was
silent about the defection of Mo
nat, who reportedly was intelli
gence chief of Polish military at
taches in embassies and other
diplomatic missions around the
globe.
In crossing over from the Com
munist world, Monat probably
brought with him considerable in
formation his strategic job gave
him about Polish military intelli
gence. Since the Soviet bloc works
so closely together, Monat may
also know much bearing on the
Soviet Union.
In acknowledging that Monat
and his family had arrived in this
country, State Deparment press
officer Lincoln White confirmed
a report carried by the N'ew York
Times yesterday.
Defection in Vienna
Writing from Vienna, Times re
porter A. M. Rosenthal said Mo
nat had turned himself over to
U.S. representatives in Vienna.
While the State Department
was vague about when Monat de
tected, .Rosenthal's story said it
happened last summer "at a time
when a crisis was brewing in Po
land."
Rosenthal wrote that Monat's
defection to the West was one of
the incidents that helped convince
Polish Communist chief Wlady
slaw Gomulka that "Communist
rule in Poland was rotting be
cause of lack of 'discipline' and
that tougher men and tougher
ways were needed."
Only recently, Rosenthal was
expelled as Times correspondent
in Poland on grounds, in the
words of a Polish official, "he had
probed too deeply into the in
ternal affairs of the country."
