# Crary Cleared in Opsahl Death: Lab Test Results In
## 
### Austin Scott 
Stanford Police received word at 4 p.m. yesterday that blood,
hair and flesh found underneath Steve Crary's car were those of a
rabbit. An analysis of the grease and dirt found on John Opsahl's
clothes after he was run over Friday night proved dissimilar to the
material under Crary's car.
Stanford Police Chief Gordon Davis said the new developments

mean Crary is completely exon
erated as far as his car is con
cerned. He commented that police
have no leads and will have to
start over again. The Santa Clara
County District Attorney will be
called into the case today.
Crary's family flew down from
Tacoma, Wash., yesterday and
have been notified of his clear
ance. His father said, "This is
just wonderful!" Crary was not
available for comment.
Crary Unsure
Davis said that Crary thought
all along that he had stopped be
fore he reached Opsahl, but was
not absolutely sure. According
to Davis, Crary said, "I didn't
think I did it, but it sure looked
like I must have."
According to Davis, the facts
in the case remain:
Opsahl was apparently killed by
a car traveling up the Sigma Nu
driveway. Because of the unusual
amount of traffic that night, and
the fact that Crary's car was
probably the first one up the
driveway after Opsahl was killed,
Davis estimates that Opsahl was
killed ten minutes 01* so before
Crary came along.
Opsahl was last seen at the
Big Game dance at 11:30 p.m. He
was supposed to go back to
Crary's car when he was ready to
go home.
Returns to Car
Shortly after 11:30, Crary re
tured to his car. He called out for
Opsahl, got no answer, and left.
Before going back to Sigma Nu,
he drove around campus and out
along Alpine Road.
Near midnight, a man was seen
staggering along Lasuen Street
and up Dolores Street towards the
Sigma Nu house. This man has
not been identified as Opsahl, but
could have been.
Crary returned home near mid
night. He turned into the drive
way, saw Opsahl's body and stop
ped, possibly leaving the skid
marks. A student in the nearby
Delta Tau Delta house heard
Crary's tires squeal. He looked
out and saw a white car at the
bottom of the hill.
Crary left the car where he had
stopped it and ran up the hill to
the Sigma Nu house. Police are
still puzzled by the 20-minute de
lay between the time the student
heard the tires squeal and the
time Crary called police.
Driver Knows
Davis said that he thinks who
ever struck and killed Opsahl
knows that he did it. There were
tire marks across Opsahl's chest,
and Davis thinks that there would
have been too noticeable a bump
to ignore.
In answer to the rumor that
Crary will not be allowed to re
turn to Stanford, Dean of Men
William Craig said yesterday
disciplinary action is under re
view against the fraternity and
the individuals involved for drink
ing in the house.
Services for Opsahl will be held
at 2:30 p.m. today in Calvary
Presbyterian Church, Silmore and
Jackson Streets, San Francisco.
Interment will be private.
