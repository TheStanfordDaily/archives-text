## 
### 
Fidel Castro's land reform and
personality, and Cuban-United
States relations were discussed by
a panel of four in Toyon Lounge

The participants were Martin B.
Travis, associate professor of
political science; Sir Harold Mitch
ell, lecturer in Spanish-American
studies; and Elenita Milbank and
Jose L. Guirao de Parga, graduate

Travis spoke first. His main
points were that Castro followed
the pattern of Latin-American
dictators in his basic desire to
stay in power and his amoral
methods of doing so.
Reform Mistakes
Mitchell then spoke on the basis
of 20 years' experience operating
a farm in Cuba. He discussed
Castro's agricultural reform pro
gram, saying that a basic mistake
was being made in divorcing the
sugar farms from the mills.
Elenita Milbank was next with
"The Castro Personality." She
said Castro has had a dominating
personality since school days, and
that "in politics he is a realist; in
economics, a Utopian."
Expression of Masses
De Parga summarized the
thinking about Castro among the
youth of Latin-America by saying
that this is the first revolution in
that area to be a true expression
of the masses and not just a pow
er struggle between small groups.
Presented by the Internal Con
ferences division of the ILR, the
discussion was moderated by
