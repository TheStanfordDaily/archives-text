Whenever something goes sour
somewhere in the world, there is
a tendency among some Ameri
cans to wring their hands and ex
claim: "What have we done
wrong? What can we do to cor
rect it?"
In Cuba the United States re
mains the target of the most
vicious anti-American attacks
deliberately inspired and spread
by the Castro government.
In the Republic of Panama,
where just about everybody is
getting ready to run for Presi
dent, the de La Guardia govern
ment permitted a mob to invade
the Canal Zone and do extensive
damage without raising a finger
to preserve order.
And some will ask: "What have
we done wrong? What can we
do to correct it?"
I am not suggesting that
every policy and every Ameri
can action is right, that we
don't make our fair quota of
mistakes. But I am suggesting
that everytime somebody else
gets sick, we don't need to rush
to the hospital.
The Castro revolution is sick
and there is no cure in Fidel
Castro's prescription that the
'nited States take the medicine.
Most Americans warmly wel
comed the overthrow of the Ba
tista dictatorship. We earnestly
hoped that Fidel Castro, a brave
and popular revolutionary, would
prove that he had more than the
ability to seize the government,
that he also had the ability to
govern—democratically and con
structively.
Jules Dußois, the veteran
Latin American correspondent
of the "Chicago Tribune," who
was close to Castro and who
covered the revolution from his
side, was convinced that Castro
was an idealist who believed
deeply in the democratic proc
ess.
Now Dußois is being spit up
on and Jjis life threatened by
Castro followers because he has
written that, now in power, the
Cuban leader has forgotten his
"ideals," is using many of the
methods of Batista, and is show
ing no evidence and no interest
in giving political freedom to the
Cuban people.
The Cuban economy is grinding
o a halt. Unemployment is

mounting. Havana's hotels are
nearly barren of tourists. The
regime has seized property with
out due compensation. Castro is
in serious difficulty.
Naturally lie blaities the
United States. He lias lost the
support and the respect of most
of the moderate, democratically
minded political leaders of other
Latin American countries, in
cluding the distinguished Presi
dent of Venezuela, It o 111 ti 1 o
Betancourt, who have been
grievously disappointed at what
has been happening.
Obviously Castro needs a
scapegoad and the bigger the
scapegoat the easier for him to
think he can escape responsibil
ity for his own misdeeds.
Eor his purposes there is little
to be gained from ranting at his
neighbors, but he can, for a time
at least, stir up the dust by rant
ing at big bad United States and
blaming us for the troubles he
has brought to Cuba and the dif
ficulties he has brought on him
self.
Perhaps we could make some
kind of accommodation with
Castro which might temporarily
•esult in cutting back his anti-
American propaganda. 15ut this
would be very short-sighted.
Better that we should stand,
as I believe we are standing, for
non-intervention in the internal
affairs of another country —
though our sympathies are with
representative democratic govern
ment.
Betler that we should demand
respect for property rights based
on international law (no seizure
without due compensation) and
demand, as we are demanding of
Panama, that a government dis
charge its duty of maintaining
law and or der.
What we should avoid and
what we are trying to avoid is
any action on our part which
will contribute to propping up
the Castro government or bring
ing it down other than by its
own weight.
Cuba is bigger than Castro and
we must keep in a position so
that, when the time comes, we
can demonstrate our friendship
for the Cuban people.
