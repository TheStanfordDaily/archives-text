Cellar Improvements
Editor, The Daily:

In answer to a recent letter
asking that something be done to
the present Cellar restaurant in
order to make it more attractive
for student use, we present these
ideas as food for thought.
Under the able direction of
Chester Berry, Stanford's new
Union Director, a committee com
posed from the Junior Class has
undertaken to make a few im
provements on the present Cellar
in order that the interium wait of
two years, until the new Cellar is
ready for use, will see positive
improvements in both the Cellar's
service and decoration.
To be featured Winter Quarter
will be the "new-look" Cellar. In
the back room there will be a juke
b(\\, room for dancing following
the replacement of several booths
with movable tables, re-decora
tion, and a featured snack bar
where all types of hot food will be
served nightly until closing at
10:30.
In the larger room, re-deeora
tion will be the keynote. High
lighting the program in this room
is a plan soon to be announced
which will bring more of the
Stanford tradition into the eyes of
the student body. Living groups
will submit trophies to the Cellar
which they feel will represent
some exploit or tradition of their
group.
Examples are in field, from
goal posts, paddles, to animal
heads, etc. These will be mounted
with the living group's name and
a short explanation of the sig
nificance of the items.
Already under way in the Cel
lar are better service policies in
stituted by Mr. Ben;y, and will
come into full realization Winter
Quarter. . .
All money possible is being di
rected towards the new student
union. Any short-run programs
to be instituted in the present
union are in no way, shape or
form designed to compete with
the sidewalk cafe, or take any
business from it.
It is merely an effort to make
the Cellar more "livable and serv
icable." Additional suggestions
would be welcomed from any di
rection. Contact: Junior Class
Ex-Com.

In Friday's Daily, the motto un
der the flag read: "The Penin
sula's Only Morning Newspa
pers." Where was Ihe news? On
those frequent occasions when
you find it necessary to suspend
Ihe reporting of all or almost all
news of national and international
interest, shouldn't you, strictly
speaking, call your publication by
another name?

the replacement of several booths
with movable tables, re-decora
tion, and a featured snack bar
where all types of hot food will be
served nightly until closing at
10:30.
In the larger room, re-deeora
tion will be the keynote. High
lighting the program in this room
is a plan soon to be announced
which will bring more of the
Stanford tradition into the eyes of
the student body. Living groups
will submit trophies to the Cellar
which they feel will represent
some exploit or tradition of their
group.
Examples are in field, from
goal posts, paddles, to animal
heads, etc. These will be mounted
with the living group's name and
a short explanation of the sig
nificance of the items.
Already under way in the Cel
lar are better service policies in
stituted by Mr. Ben;y, and will
come into full realization Winter
Quarter. . .
All money possible is being di
rected towards the new student
union. Any short-run programs
to be instituted in the present
union are in no way, shape or
form designed to compete with
the sidewalk cafe, or take any
business from it.
It is merely an effort to make
the Cellar more "livable and serv
icable." Additional suggestions
would be welcomed from any di
rection. Contact: Junior Class

In Friday's Daily, the motto un

those frequent occasions when
you find it necessary to suspend
Ihe reporting of all or almost all
news of national and international
interest, shouldn't you, strictly
speaking, call your publication by
another name?

Editor, The Daily:

In answer to a recent letter
asking that something be done to
the present Cellar restaurant in
order to make it more attractive
for student use, we present these
ideas as food for thought.
Under the able direction of
Chester Berry, Stanford's new
Union Director, a committee com
posed from the Junior Class has
undertaken to make a few im
provements on the present Cellar
in order that the interium wait of
two years, until the new Cellar is
ready for use, will see positive
improvements in both the Cellar's
service and decoration.
To be featured Winter Quarter
will be the "new-look" Cellar. In
the back room there will be a juke
b(\\, room for dancing following
the replacement of several booths
with movable tables, re-decora
tion, and a featured snack bar
