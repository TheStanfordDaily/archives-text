# The 						Trouble with Tuesday

.... Is thai it's the second j
morning' of pre-reg advising.
"My advisor doesn't help me at
all."
"My advisor doesn't know what
Iho general studies requirements
are."
"I know more about the re
quirements than my advisor does;
he's just confused."
Such are the comments one may
hear whenever the time comes
around for planning courses for
the coming year.
The University administration
is concerned that students may
not be getting the most air! and
advice from their advisors, and
probably even more concerned
are many of the students who feel
that they are not getting any aid
or advjce.
The student's program, espec
ially before he selects a major,
revolves around the General
Studies requirements and there
is no excuse far an advisor who
does not know those require
ments.
Each advisor receives a hand
hook which thoroughly discusses
the requirements, as well as the
role of the advisor. However, il
would appear that too many ad
visors read this handbook the
same way we read their text
books and retain .just about as
much.
Some of these advisors seem
not to care about their job as
advisor. Why they continue to
play the role is something of a
mystery because, at least in
theory, a professor does not have
to advise. There is apparently
some sort of social pressure or
stature connected with being an
advisor — perhaps its linked to
martyrdom; the prof feels he's
making a great sacrifice of time
and effort to serve as an advisor.
But, just as there is the other
side to Senior Colloquia, as
pointed out last week, there is
also give and take between ad
visors and advisees.
For instance, a complete Gen
eral Studies handbook is avail
able to all students. Here they
can discover what is required,
what fulfills certain requirements
and something of what to expect
in the courses.
The student who reads the
handbook carefully doesn't need
to depend on his advisor to tell
him what's what.
Some students apparently ex
pect the advisor to do all Ihe work
for them.
"I want 1o plan my four-year
schedule," they say. "What shall
I take?''

I N'ow how is an advisor sup
posed to know where a student's
interests lie? And perhaps it's a
little too much to expect for an
advisor to know all about all the
departments in the University.
Most of the General Studies ad
visors try not to prejudice a stu
dent in favor of their own de
partments, hence the student feels
the advisor isn't forceful enough.
Some advisors are willing to
spend time to talk to the stu
dent enough to know something
of what the student wants in
his Stanford education. But it
isn't always easy to draw the
student out, especially if he
hasn't taken any initiative in
the situation.
The student can talk to other
students part of the propa
ganda for integrating sopho
; mores, juniors, and senior women
i indicated such an exchange of ex
j perience. The student can talk
to profs in other departments,
audit a class or two. He can
thoroughly read the materials
available Courses and Degrees;
General Studies bulletin; depart
mental bulletins.
It was recently suggested that
| senior students in a department
■ serve as advisors. They can be
helpful to the underclassmen and
most would be willing to talk
things over unofficially, but their
I prejudices for and against de
partments and professors could
be more detrimental than the pro
fessors' seeming disinterested
ness.

is plagued by the flying beasts.
