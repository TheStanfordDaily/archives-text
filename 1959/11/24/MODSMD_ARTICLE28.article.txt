## PRESS BOX It's Quiet Now

All that's loft now is an empty stadium and groundskeepers mov
ing around trying to pick up the ton of paper left hy departing Big
Game fans. Yes, the rooters, teams, coaches, managers, yell leaders,
bands, hawkers and the kids have all departed after another Stan
ford - California classic.
Sure il might he considered a let-down to see our team beaten
by an inspired Bear team, the clock, perhaps the officials, and finally
of all things, the forward passes of the ill-regarded Cal passing

attack. Even Chuck Taylor, form
er Card coach and now assistant
athletic director, admitted that '"1
think we've just exhausted ways
to lose the Big dame." Neverthe
less it was a day for breaking
records as Card quarterback Dick
Norman and ends Chris Burford
and Ben Robinson forged their
way into Stanford and NCAA rec
ord books with an amazing pass
ing show.
Many rooters in both cheering
sections were unaware of Nor
man's performance during game
time until the public address sys
tem announced that he had 27
completions out of 30 attempts in
the fourth quarter, with two of
these incomplete coming from in
tentionally thrown balls- out of
reach of all receivers to save an
interception and one bouncing
off the hands of Robinson. Every
one realized that Dick was calling
a good game and a few bad breaks
and penalties cost the Tribe touch
downs in the opening stanza. The

gamp proved to bo certainly Norman's best here at Stanford, and
without a doubt the best individual effort of a Stanford quarterback
in our grid history. From all angles, in play calling, execution and
passing the junior quarterback surpassed his famous predecessors.
Of course his three record-breaking performances speak for this.
His 34 completions out of 39 attempts for 401 yards and a .HTI per
centage broke the old NCAA total completion record for one game of
Don Klosterinan of Loyola against Florida who had 33 out of 63 at
tempts. Norman also busted the old yardage mark for a single game
held by Detroit's Ted Marcliibroda of 390 yards made in the 1952
grid season. The best passing percentage in a single game 87.2 per
centâ€”is now also held by the able Card QB.
