# Norman Moves to Front

### 
Not only was this the best Big Game and single game performance
by a Stanford quarterback but Norman also surpassed the season rec
ords of ex-Tribe greats—All-Americans Bob Garrett and John Brodie.
Garrett really placed the Stanford passing game on the map in the
'52 and '53 season. In 1953 you might remember that the Card team
was leading the league with the Uclans—who featured Paul Cameron
and an improving sophomore fullback Bob Davenport and went
down to the wire only to tie Cal in the Big One and loose the Rose
Bowl bid. The Card team had Garrett throwing to ends Sam Morley
and John Steinberg and halfback Ron Cook against the Bears led
by Paul Larson and Matt Hazeltine at center. The result is history
with a 21-21 tie in the Big One.
Garrett finished up the season with a record breaking 1637 yards
for the season, a .578 completion average and passed for 17 Card TDs.
In 1956 John Brodie came along to further Stanford prominence
in the Nation's passing. Once again the Cards were considered a
Rose Bowl potential but a mid-season, one-point loss to Oregon
State—in the year which began the famous extra-point headaches of
Stanford coaches or Before Skip Face— kept the Tribe out of the
Bowl. Brodie topped Garrett's record by five yards—for a 1642 total
yard season—and hit for 12 TDs and a 57.9 per cent completion
average.
Both Garrett and Brodie had some top notch receivers. In 1953
Garrett completed 45 passes to Morley, 32 to Stain berg: and 29 to
Cook. Brodie threw 28 to Paul Camera and 25 to Carl Issacs.
