# Burford, Robinson Help

However now Norman leads them all with a season's total of
2018 yards gained—with 1963 coming from his pin-point passes.
Norman, only a junior, has a chance to beat it again next year hut
his 152 completions for 11 touchdowns and a 57.9 per cent average
makes the record almost out of reach.
Certainly the Card receivers led by captain Burford have helped
Norman's achievements. Burford holds the Card record for number
of receptions—6l—and most total yards with 757,. He also should
top the Nation in these departments this year and is definitely
destined for Ail-American ratings. Robinson's 34 receptions ranks
him third in all-time Card statistics.
It was a day for breaking records all right but surprisingly
enough the leading ground gainer wore neither blue or red but
rather the black and white stripes of the officials. Yes umpire Bob
Fischer led both teams by marching off over 135 yards on his favorite
play—the holding penalty. Both teams suffered equally in his fine
foot work. He showed himself equally as well in the Cal-Washinglon
game penalizing the Huskies for 150 yards in the first half. This
writer and many players and fans alike certainly admire consistency
in officiating but if Fischer is going to call them so close and where
the Home Team makes over 135 yards in one series of plays and
still can't score the officiating turns to worse than ridiculous.
