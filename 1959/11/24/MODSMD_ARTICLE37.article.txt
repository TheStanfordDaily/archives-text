# Cal Takes Soccer Win; 2-1 Thriller
## 
### Glen Alford 
The Stanford socccr learn closed out a somewhat disappointing
soccer season by losing to California 2-1 Saturday.
Stanford got off to a fast start and scored in the first fifteen
iminutes of the game on a goal by center forward Dick Bartlett
as the result of a perfect pass by halfback Rusty Williams.

The 1-0 Stanford lead stood up
for almost one quarter. Cal tied
the score midway through the
second quarter. Rick Prydz scored
from in close.
The goal that won the game
was a heart-breaker for Stanford.
Just twelve seconds after the be
ginning of the second half, Bill
Barreda took advantage of Stan
ford's having only ten men on the
field and drove in for a score. Dan
Farthing, Stanford's full b a e k
hadn't even moved off of the
sidelines for some unknown rea
son.
That score demoralized the In
dians, and Cal dominated the
third quarter. Stanford drove
back determinedly in the fourth
quarter but could not push the
ball past the back line of the
Golden Bear's defense.
Injuries played a big part in
Stanford's loss. Rune Enge
bretsen suffered a charleyhorse
and didn't even suit up for the
game. Fullback Tom Lief suf
fered a pinched nerve in his leg
and, even though he was in uni
form, didn't play.
After the game, both Cal coach
Bob Di Grazia and Stanford

mentor Fred Priddle pointer! out
the excellent work done by inside
left Bernie Knaggs and goalie
Dick Voake. Voake completely
outplayed highly-publicized All-
American California goalie Fred
Becker, despite the fact that Cali
fornia won.
Priddle was not happy at the
results of both the game and the
season, even though Stanford
took fourth place in the confer
ence with a 4-3 record. "I am
very disappointed. The team
didn't play as capably as they
can. What could have been our
best season turned out to be just
an average satisfactory one."
The soccer season will close
Tuesday night, with the annual
all-star game to be held at San
Francisco State soccer field at 8.

The goal that won the game
was a heart-breaker for Stanford.
Just twelve seconds after the be
ginning of the second half, Bill
Barreda took advantage of Stan
ford's having only ten men on the
field and drove in for a score. Dan
Farthing, Stanford's full b a e k
hadn't even moved off of the
sidelines for some unknown rea
son.
That score demoralized the In
dians, and Cal dominated the
third quarter. Stanford drove
back determinedly in the fourth
quarter but could not push the
ball past the back line of the
Golden Bear's defense.
Injuries played a big part in
Stanford's loss. Rune Enge
bretsen suffered a charleyhorse
and didn't even suit up for the
game. Fullback Tom Lief suf
fered a pinched nerve in his leg
and, even though he was in uni
form, didn't play.
After the game, both Cal coach
Bob Di Grazia and Stanford

mentor Fred Priddle pointer! out
the excellent work done by inside
left Bernie Knaggs and goalie
Dick Voake. Voake completely
outplayed highly-publicized All-
American California goalie Fred
Becker, despite the fact that Cali
fornia won.
Priddle was not happy at the
results of both the game and the
season, even though Stanford
took fourth place in the confer
ence with a 4-3 record. "I am
very disappointed. The team
didn't play as capably as they
can. What could have been our
best season turned out to be just
an average satisfactory one."
The soccer season will close
Tuesday night, with the annual
all-star game to be held at San
Francisco State soccer field at 8.
