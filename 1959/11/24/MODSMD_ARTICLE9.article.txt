ized labor rejected a Communist
bid yesterday and elected an all-
Castro slate as its ruling com
mittee.

confederation." This could de
velop into an effort by followers
of Prime Minister Fidel Castro to
report his labor policies through

ready have tried to sell his politi
cal program to his neighbors.

sion of the congress of the Cuban

ion workers—as secretary gen
eral.

for representation on the execu
tive committee.
Castro's Committee
