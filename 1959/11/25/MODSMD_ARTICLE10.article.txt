# Communist Leader Claims Civil Liberties in Danger
## 
### Bob Frank 
Albert J. Lima, Northern California organizer of the Communist
Party, discussed the threats to civil liberties and particularly to com
munists in the Smith Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act, yesterday in
the Women's Clubhouse.
Lima's argument against the Smith Act, and the one he used in

his defense when charged with
violation of the Act, was based on
a "right to advocate" and the ar
gument that conviction of conspir
ing to advocate the violent over
throw of the government would
provide a precedent for forbid
ding any and all advocacy in the
future.
The offensive provision of the
Landrum - Griffin Act provides
that officers of labor unions must
not have been members of the
Communist Party within the last
five years.
A third area of civil liberties
danger is in the loyalty require
ments for employment in govern
ment organiations.
Domestic Tensions
While Lima predicted an easing
of international tensions with
peaceful coexistence and competi
tion between capitalism and com
munism as economic systems, he
was distrubed by "tensions of the
domestic scene." Unions and em
ployers, he said, are more at odds
now than at any time since the
'20s. Civil liberties are en
dangered, and there is a "drive
against the Negro people."
Lima said that his immediate
objective is the abolition of mo
nopolies in the United States
which he defined as combinations
designed to control an industry,
citing the auto industry as an
example.
Majority Rule
The Communist Party, said
Lima, will help guide (lie Ameri
can people when the vast majority
of the people have decided in favor
of socialism, but it will be the
majority that decides.
Under questioning, Lima de
fended Ihe one-party system in
.Russia as part of that country's
tradition,
Lima said that he has a "right
to my opinion" about what took
place in Hungary in 19,">(i, thai tlie
revolution resulted from a Rus
sian mistake in pushing com
munism on Hungarians too fast,
and that the "counter-revolution"
grew out of t he general "cold war
situation."

While Lima predicted an easing
of international tensions with
peaceful coexistence and competi
tion between capitalism and com
munism as economic systems, he
was distrubed by "tensions of the
domestic scene." Unions and em
ployers, he said, are more at odds
now than at any time since the
'20s. Civil liberties are en
dangered, and there is a "drive
against the Negro people."
Lima said that his immediate
objective is the abolition of mo
nopolies in the United States
which he defined as combinations
designed to control an industry,
citing the auto industry as an
example.
Majority Rule
The Communist Party, said
Lima, will help guide (lie Ameri
can people when the vast majority
of the people have decided in favor
of socialism, but it will be the
majority that decides.
Under questioning, Lima de
fended Ihe one-party system in
.Russia as part of that country's
tradition,
Lima said that he has a "right
to my opinion" about what took
place in Hungary in 19,">(i, thai tlie
revolution resulted from a Rus
sian mistake in pushing com
munism on Hungarians too fast,
and that the "counter-revolution"
grew out of t he general "cold war
situation."

ALBERT J. LIMA
Communist organizer addressed Political Union group
Albert J. Lima, Northern California organizer of the Communist
Party, discussed the threats to civil liberties and particularly to com
munists in the Smith Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act, yesterday in
the Women's Clubhouse.
Lima's argument against the Smith Act, and the one he used in

his defense when charged with
violation of the Act, was based on
a "right to advocate" and the ar
gument that conviction of conspir
ing to advocate the violent over
throw of the government would
provide a precedent for forbid
ding any and all advocacy in the
future.
The offensive provision of the
Landrum - Griffin Act provides
that officers of labor unions must
not have been members of the
Communist Party within the last
five years.
A third area of civil liberties
danger is in the loyalty require
ments for employment in govern
ment organiations.
