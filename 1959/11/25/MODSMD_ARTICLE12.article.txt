WASHINGTON (/I 5 ) — Secre
; tary of State Christian A. Herter
| yesterday fired back at Dean
Acheson, former Democratic sec
j retary of state who has accused
j the Eisenhower administration of
I heading toward appeasement of
I the Soviet Union.
At a news conference, Herter
I said Acheson had no solid ground
for assuming the administration
i will make one-sided concessions
j to the Soviet Union to ease the
| danger of war over Berlin's fu
j tu re.
| "His assumptions were that tlie
Russians would be insisting still
j on the position they held a year
; ago last November when the crisis
was precipitated. Actually they
| have come a very long way,"
| Herter said.
Invitation
In a speech last Wednesday,
Acheson described any East-West
i talks about Berlin's future at this
time as an invitation for Soviet
Premier Nikita Khrushchev to
i cut the throat of the allies.
"The plain truth is that to ne
gotiate about Berlin with the in
tention of coming to terms is only
! a polite, misleading phrase for a
retreat and an acceptance of Rus
| sian terms," Acheson said.
In rebuttal, Herter said the So
j viets have abandoned threats in
demanding a new Berlin arrange
j ment. Further, Herter said, the
[Soviets have repeatedly acknowl
edged the legal right of the West
; crn Allies to remain in West Ber
: lin.
Struck Hack
Herter also struck back at Ache
son's claim that the Eisenhower
| administration has no foreign pol-
I icy except "locomotion"—moving
| President Eisenhower around in
I visits to foreign countries.
In his fourth news conference
1 since taking office last spring,
Herter said the Western powers
; will agree on a date for an East
| West summit meeting during
their conference in Paris begin
ning Dec. 19.
lie knows of no reason to sus-
I pert the East-West parley will be
j delayed until 1961, as London dis
i patches have speculated. A mid-
April date is reported under Al
lied consideration,
