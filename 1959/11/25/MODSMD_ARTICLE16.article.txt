# Rx Apathy Antidotes
## 
### Mary Lou McKinley 
For further convenience, this
column is divided into two cate
gories this week: for those stu
dents remaining on campus over
vacation, and for those too broke
after Big Game weekend to do
anything costly during the next
week.
If you're planning on spend
ing Thanksgiving around this
area, a good postlude to dinner
tomorrow evening would be the
Christopher Fry comedy, "A
Phoenix Too Frequent," playing
Thursday nights at 8:30 at the
Loft Theater, Emerson at Ham
ilton in Palo Alto.
Presented by The Improviso
Touring Theater Company, the
.show is a delightful example of
poetic comedy, polished and bril
liantly executed.
Although set in Asia Minor
during the ancient period of his
tory, Fry has incorporated con
temporary expressions and mod
ern phrasing into his comedy,
producing sparkling humor and
wit of timeless applicability.
With the reaffirmation of
life as its theme, the play has
only three characters: Dyna-

memo, a beautiful young wom
an who lias decided to join her
husband, Virilius, in the under
world by "fasting, thirsting, and
crying" to death; Doto, her
maid who feels that "death is
now interest in life . . . and I'm
fond of change;" and Tegeus, a
young soldier who enters the
tomb lo eat his supper.
A conflict arises when Dyna
mcne finds herself attracted to
the young man despite her deter
mination to join her husband,
while Tegeus, who has been
guarding the bodies of six ex
ecuted men, suddenly discovers
one has been stolen, and he is
faced with the prospect of a
court-martial.
But out of all of this, Dyna
mene realizes in the end that it
is far more important to live than
to seek death; and Tegeus' faith
in human nature and the world
is restored.
William Graham, Ilutli Hide
out- and Sandra Archer com
prise the cast, each doing an
excellent job. An informal dis
cussion of the play also is held
after each performance with
the cast and director Henry
Stein.
On campus this Saturday, a
staged dramatic reading of Sean
O'Casey'.s "I Knock at the Door"

will be given by Ihe Stanford
Players in the Little Theater at
8:30 p.m. Continuing Dee. 2-5,
the production is directed by Dr.
James Kerans. Tickets are priced
at $1.25 and $1.75, on sale at
Memorial Box Office. ,
Opening Monday for a week at
the Geary Theater, Jerome Kilty's
"Dear Liar" stars Katharine Cor
nell and Brian Aherne. Adapted
for the stage from the intimate
letter of Mrs. Patrick Campbell
and Bernard Shaw, tickets for the
show are priced at $2.10-$4.30
for the Monday - Thursday shows,
$2.65 - $4.85 for next Friday and
Saturday evenings, and from
$1.55-$3.75 for matinees next
Wednesday and Saturday.
Bayanihan, the Philippine
National Dance Theater, will
present five performances this
weekend at the Alcazar theater,
O'Farrell between Mason and
Powell in Ssin Francisco. Tick
ets for the shows, Friday at 8:30
p.m. and Saturday and Sunday
at 2:30 and 8:30 p.m., run from
$2.65 to $4.85.
At the Blackfriars Theater,
1850 Pierce Street in the City,
the professional West Coast pre
miere of Paul Claudel's miracle
play, "The Tidings Brought to
Mary," will open Friday at 8:30
p.m., Saturday performances are
scheduled for 6 and 9 p.m., with
Sunday's show starting at 7 p.m.
Seats are $1.25 and $2.50.
"Mark Twain Tonight," the re
markable one-man impersonation
of the great American humorist
by Hal Holbrook, is playing to
night through Sunday at the
Geary theater at 8:30 p.m. with
matinees Saturday and Sunday at
2:30 p.m.
Holbrook has been doing the
Twain characterization for more
than 10 years, but didn't hit the
real success road until his Broad
way opening last April.
Ancient records of Twain's
voice, old films and dusty manu
scripts have all contributed to
Holbrook's impersonation. It even
takes him three hours to make up
as he strives for as close an imita
tion of Twain as possible.
Since his New York opening,
Holbrook has been a hit wherever
he has played. Columbia Records
has issued a recording of parts of
the performance.
Now to the grouping which
should have widespread appeal
for Stanford students at this
time in the quarter—non-cost
items for passing time pleas
antly.
Through December 6, photo
graphs by Ferenc Berko and Al
bert Kihn will be on display at
the San Francisco Museum of Art,
open Tuesday - Friday from noon
to 10 p.m. and Saturday - Monday
from 1-6 p.m.
This exhibition demonstrates
;two approaches to the photo
graphic art: Berko explores the
expressive possibilities to be at
tained through manipulation of
the technical processes; Kihn,
through straight photography,
creates in a series of prints a
comprehensive photographic re
port of a place or living situation.
Also at the Museum, Claude
Monet's "Waterloo Bridge" is
on display as a part of the
Museum's Milestones of the
Modern Movement series which
brings in single great works
whose style is important in the
development toward the art of
today.
At San Francisco State College
Monday evening at 8:30, platform
readings of Jean Racine's 'Bere
nice" and Robinson Jeffer's
"Hungerfield" will be presented
free of charge by the Reader's
Theater in the Little Theater, 1600
Hoiloway Ave., San Francisco.

Holbrook has been doing the
Twain characterization for more
than 10 years, but didn't hit the
real success road until his Broad
way opening last April.
Ancient records of Twain's
voice, old films and dusty manu
scripts have all contributed to
Holbrook's impersonation. It even
takes him three hours to make up
as he strives for as close an imita
tion of Twain as possible.
Since his New York opening,
Holbrook has been a hit wherever

Loves wine in "Phoenix"
For further convenience, this
column is divided into two cate
gories this week: for those stu
dents remaining on campus over
vacation, and for those too broke
after Big Game weekend to do
anything costly during the next
week.
If you're planning on spend
ing Thanksgiving around this
area, a good postlude to dinner
tomorrow evening would be the
Christopher Fry comedy, "A
Phoenix Too Frequent," playing
Thursday nights at 8:30 at the
Loft Theater, Emerson at Ham
ilton in Palo Alto.
Presented by The Improviso
Touring Theater Company, the
.show is a delightful example of
poetic comedy, polished and bril
liantly executed.
Although set in Asia Minor
during the ancient period of his
tory, Fry has incorporated con
temporary expressions and mod
ern phrasing into his comedy,
producing sparkling humor and
wit of timeless applicability.
With the reaffirmation of
life as its theme, the play has
only three characters: Dyna-

memo, a beautiful young wom
an who lias decided to join her
husband, Virilius, in the under
world by "fasting, thirsting, and
crying" to death; Doto, her
maid who feels that "death is
now interest in life . . . and I'm
fond of change;" and Tegeus, a
young soldier who enters the
tomb lo eat his supper.
A conflict arises when Dyna
mcne finds herself attracted to
the young man despite her deter
mination to join her husband,
while Tegeus, who has been
guarding the bodies of six ex
ecuted men, suddenly discovers
one has been stolen, and he is
faced with the prospect of a
court-martial.
But out of all of this, Dyna
mene realizes in the end that it
is far more important to live than
to seek death; and Tegeus' faith
in human nature and the world
is restored.
William Graham, Ilutli Hide
out- and Sandra Archer com
prise the cast, each doing an
excellent job. An informal dis
cussion of the play also is held

Stein.

p.m., Saturday performances are
scheduled for 6 and 9 p.m., with

"Mark Twain Tonight," the re
markable one-man impersonation
of the great American humorist
by Hal Holbrook, is playing to
night through Sunday at the
Geary theater at 8:30 p.m. with
matinees Saturday and Sunday at
2:30 p.m.
Holbrook has been doing the
Twain characterization for more
than 10 years, but didn't hit the
real success road until his Broad
way opening last April.
Ancient records of Twain's
voice, old films and dusty manu
scripts have all contributed to
Holbrook's impersonation. It even
takes him three hours to make up
as he strives for as close an imita
tion of Twain as possible.
Since his New York opening,
Holbrook has been a hit wherever
he has played. Columbia Records
has issued a recording of parts of
the performance.
Now to the grouping which
should have widespread appeal
for Stanford students at this
time in the quarter—non-cost
items for passing time pleas
antly.

This exhibition demonstrates
;two approaches to the photo
graphic art: Berko explores the
expressive possibilities to be at
tained through manipulation of
the technical processes; Kihn,
through straight photography,
creates in a series of prints a
comprehensive photographic re
port of a place or living situation.
Also at the Museum, Claude
Monet's "Waterloo Bridge" is
on display as a part of the
Museum's Milestones of the
Modern Movement series which
brings in single great works
whose style is important in the
development toward the art of
today.

readings of Jean Racine's 'Bere
nice" and Robinson Jeffer's
"Hungerfield" will be presented
free of charge by the Reader's

For further convenience, this
column is divided into two cate
gories this week: for those stu
dents remaining on campus over
vacation, and for those too broke
after Big Game weekend to do
anything costly during the next
week.
If you're planning on spend
ing Thanksgiving around this
area, a good postlude to dinner
tomorrow evening would be the
Christopher Fry comedy, "A
Phoenix Too Frequent," playing
Thursday nights at 8:30 at the
Loft Theater, Emerson at Ham
ilton in Palo Alto.
Presented by The Improviso
Touring Theater Company, the
.show is a delightful example of
poetic comedy, polished and bril
liantly executed.
Although set in Asia Minor
during the ancient period of his
tory, Fry has incorporated con
temporary expressions and mod
ern phrasing into his comedy,
producing sparkling humor and
wit of timeless applicability.
With the reaffirmation of
life as its theme, the play has
only three characters: Dyna-

memo, a beautiful young wom
an who lias decided to join her
husband, Virilius, in the under
world by "fasting, thirsting, and
crying" to death; Doto, her
maid who feels that "death is
now interest in life . . . and I'm
fond of change;" and Tegeus, a
young soldier who enters the
tomb lo eat his supper.
A conflict arises when Dyna
mcne finds herself attracted to
the young man despite her deter
mination to join her husband,
while Tegeus, who has been
guarding the bodies of six ex
ecuted men, suddenly discovers
one has been stolen, and he is
faced with the prospect of a
court-martial.
But out of all of this, Dyna
mene realizes in the end that it
is far more important to live than
to seek death; and Tegeus' faith
in human nature and the world
is restored.
William Graham, Ilutli Hide
out- and Sandra Archer com
prise the cast, each doing an
excellent job. An informal dis
cussion of the play also is held
after each performance with
the cast and director Henry
Stein.
On campus this Saturday, a
staged dramatic reading of Sean
O'Casey'.s "I Knock at the Door"

will be given by Ihe Stanford
Players in the Little Theater at
8:30 p.m. Continuing Dee. 2-5,
the production is directed by Dr.
James Kerans. Tickets are priced
at $1.25 and $1.75, on sale at
Memorial Box Office. ,
Opening Monday for a week at
the Geary Theater, Jerome Kilty's
"Dear Liar" stars Katharine Cor
nell and Brian Aherne. Adapted
for the stage from the intimate
letter of Mrs. Patrick Campbell
and Bernard Shaw, tickets for the
