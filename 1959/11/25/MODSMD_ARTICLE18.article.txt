The United Slates is giving evi
dence in the United Slates that
she does not intend to enter any
summit conference seeking agree
ment for the sake of agreement.
One of the bitterest exchanges
in recent months between the
United States and the Soviet
Union occurred Monday as the
Communist bloc fought to pre
ve nt th e General Assembly
from taking up a report by the
special representative studying
the Hungarian matter.
The Communists claim condi
tions in Hungary, where observ
ers have reported the imminence
of additional executions, are an
internal affair not subject to tJ.N.
review.
Henry Cabot Lodge, U.S.
chief (lelegate, replied among
other things, that turning a
small country into a colonial
slum was really what violated
the spii'it of Camp Davis.

The United States won its fight
to place the special report on the
Assembly agenda.
The United States initiated an
other fight with the Communist
bloc by announcing she would ask
the Assembly to reaffirm its prin
ciples on reunification of Korea.
The U.N. has asked for a just
settlement and free elections.
Both of these are items on
which there has never been any
wavering by the General As
sembly.
Both are items on which re
newed expressions of public dis
approval of Communist actions
i will have no specific effect.
They do represent a reaffirma-
I tion by the United States, how
i ever, that as leader of the free
j world she has no intention of
I abandoning the Communist satel
| lites or of abandoning her prin
| ciples just for the sake of obtain
ing a cloak of sweetness and light
to cove up the cold war.
There has been fear in the
I satellites and in West Germany
that the United States and Bri
tain, seeking an accommodation
with the Soviet Union over the
Berlin prblein, and hoping for a
beginning on disarmament,
might gradually come to recog
nize the status quo—a prime
Soviet objective.
This fear has been heightened

among refugees from Eastern Eu
rope by West Germany's accep
tace, since Chancellor Konrad
Adenauer's talk with Prime Min
ister Harold Macmillan, that Ger
many has small chance of ever
recovering the Eastern territories
seized by Soviet arms and turned
over to Poland.
Germany is approaching' that
issue from the standpoint that
she cannot expect to get off
scot free from the legacy of the
Hitlerites, and recognizes there
are almost no Germans left be
yond the Oder-Neisse line in
what is now Poland.
The United States is reminding
that she has not forgotten the
satellites, and that she intends to
help them keep alive the will for
freedom.

The United Slates is giving evi

she does not intend to enter any
summit conference seeking agree

One of the bitterest exchanges
in recent months between the
United States and the Soviet
Union occurred Monday as the
Communist bloc fought to pre
ve nt th e General Assembly
from taking up a report by the
special representative studying
the Hungarian matter.
The Communists claim condi
tions in Hungary, where observ
ers have reported the imminence
of additional executions, are an
internal affair not subject to tJ.N.
review.
Henry Cabot Lodge, U.S.
chief (lelegate, replied among
other things, that turning a
small country into a colonial
slum was really what violated
the spii'it of Camp Davis.

The United States won its fight
to place the special report on the
Assembly agenda.
The United States initiated an
other fight with the Communist
bloc by announcing she would ask
the Assembly to reaffirm its prin
ciples on reunification of Korea.
The U.N. has asked for a just
settlement and free elections.
Both of these are items on
which there has never been any
wavering by the General As
sembly.
Both are items on which re
newed expressions of public dis
approval of Communist actions
i will have no specific effect.
They do represent a reaffirma-
I tion by the United States, how
i ever, that as leader of the free
j world she has no intention of
I abandoning the Communist satel

| ciples just for the sake of obtain
ing a cloak of sweetness and light
to cove up the cold war.
There has been fear in the
I satellites and in West Germany
that the United States and Bri
tain, seeking an accommodation
with the Soviet Union over the
Berlin prblein, and hoping for a
beginning on disarmament,
might gradually come to recog
nize the status quo—a prime
Soviet objective.
