# Influence of Darwin on Lit Shown

The influence of Charles Dar
win's theories of evolution on j
Victorian English literature was
traced last night by Professor j
William Irvine in his Tuesday!
Evening Series lecture.
The expert on the Victorian j
era from Stanford's English De-'
partment began his discussion;
with Tennyson and showed that
although he wrote before Dar
win's effect became as great as
it would eventually be, their writ
ings were related because of the
trend of English thought in gen
eral.
England had already begun to i
develop a scientific tradition and;
felt that nature was a kind of .
lesser revelation. "Tennyson did '
not thoroughly accept the "Origin I
of Species" but always wondered j
and so put down the ape and
tiger within him."
Evolution Equaled
Darwin held that in each gen-1
oration, a species devastates it - j
self by overpopulation and so a
selection of individuals arises, 1
"not only in hardihood, but in
basic structure," Irv in e said.j
Through this, he continued, "Dar-1
win strengthened the Victorian ;
faith in progress." This concept â– 
was shown largely in the works of
Spencer, who believed that evolu
tion and progress were much the |
same thing.
"Darwin had found his Paid in
Huxley," the professor related, j
After studying the "Origin of
Species," Huxley reduced every
thing to protoplasm and build j
Darwinish on the ruins of Gen
esis.
Natural and Moral Law
He then extended his ideas to J
conclude that natural law is j
cosmic and moral law is ethical. I
"Moral law has allowed man to !
dominate and live in harmony.!
but he still battles tigers within."
While Huxley had combined
religious values with evolution, i
Meredith tried to separate them
in his writings. He taught that j
"life is evolved from blood. |
through brain, to spirit." This
system was too strong for Hardy,
who, according to Irvine, is the
"almost classic example of the
evolutionary pessimist." The
climax of Victorian anxiety ap-:
pea red in Hardy when he wrote
that Men are a mistake in Dar-;
winism because they must suffer
too much.
Irvine concluded his talk by
showing that literature is not now
preoccupied with Darwin himself
but with the world which he
helped to form.
