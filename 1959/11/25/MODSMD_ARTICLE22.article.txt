TV OR NOT TV
The academic world lias in ado its first, tentative stops into
television—a few lectures, a few seminars, a few lab demonstra
tions—but colleges have not yet begun to use television's vast
capacity to dramatize, to amuse, to stir the senses, to unshackle
the imagination. Like, for example, the following:
AXXOUXCER: Howdy, folksies. Well, it's time again for
that lovable, laughable pair, Emmett Twonkey Magrudor,
Ph. D., and Felicia May Crimscott, M.A., in that rollicking,
roistering fun show, American History 101 ...And here they
are—the team that took the "hiss" out of "history"—Emmett
Twonkey Mngruder and Felicia May Crimscott!
DR. MACJRUDER: Ilowdy, folksies. A funny thing hap
pened to me on the way to my doctorate. A mendicant ap
proached me and said, "Excuse me, sir, will you give me '2.">
cents for a sandwich?" and 1 replied, "Perhaps I will, my good
man. Let me see the sandwich."

MTSS CRTMSCOTT: Oh, how droll, Dr. Magruder! TTow
delicious! You're a regular .Too Penner!... But enough of
badinage. Let us turn to our rollicking, roistering fun show,
American History 101.
DR. MAC.RUDER: Today wo will dramatize the taut and
tingling story of John Smith and Pocahontas. I will play
C'jiptain Smith and Miss Magruder will play Pocahontas.
ANNOUNCER: But first a message from our sponsor...
Folksies, have you tried Alpine Cigarettes yet? llave you
treated yourself to that fresh filtration, that subtle coolness,
that extra-long, extra-efficient filter? Have you? llinmm?
... If not, wake your tobacconist and get some Alpines at once!
.. . And now to our grim and gripping story. Picture, if you
will, a still summer night. An Indian maid stands by a moonlit
brook. Suddenly she hears a footstep behind her. She turns . ..
MISS CRIMSCOTT: Oh! John Smith! You-um startle-um
nie-um!
DR. MACiRUDER: Howdy, Pocahontas. What are you
doing by the brook?
MISS CRIMSCOTT: Just washing out a few scalps. But
what-um you-um want-um?
DR. MACIRUDER: I came to see the Chief.
MISS CRIMSCOTT: You-um can't-um. Chief is leaving for
Chicago.
DR. MAC.RUDER: On what track?
ANNOUNCER: And speaking of tracks, stay on the right
track with Alpines—the 4rack that leads straight to smoking
pleasure, to fun, to frolic, to sweet content. . . And now back
to those two gassers, Emmett Twonkey Magruder and Felicia
May (Yiniscott.
DR. MAC.RUDER: Well, folksies, that's all for today. See
you next week, same time, same channel.
MISS CRIMSCOTT: Stay tuned now for "William Cullen
Bryant—(iirl Intern."
ANNOUNCER: And remember, folksies, there was a time
when you needed to smoke two cigarettes to get what you get
from one Alpine —one cigarette for light menthol, one for high
filtration. Today you can get it all in a single Alpine, which means
you no longer have to go around smoking two cigarettes at a
time, causing your friends to snigger, and violating the fire laws.
