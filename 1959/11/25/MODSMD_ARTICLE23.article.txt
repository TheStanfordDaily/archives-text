Who's Worried?
I never pot close enough to chock faeos for sure, but f1 did
show up with its secret weapon Saturday.
Whether he was number 22 or number HO, I'm not quite sure, but
I do know that he had something to do with the forward pass.
If anyone bothering to read this column did not see last week's
Rig (iamc issue, I must sound more norisensir.il than ever. You see,
Cal revealed to us late last week that the Rears would unveil a
secret weapon at Rig Came, and

Rerkeley was so kind as to pro
vide us with publicity shots of the
lad.
That's him you see in the
column.
At this time I feel it fair to
advise potential skin-divers that
Friday's paper was sort of a
parody-type and that Cal really
does have the axe, so don't go
jumping off Dumbarton Rriilge.
1 must admit that sometimes
we don't always get through to
the older generation. The mother
of one Daily staffer phoned ex
citedly Sunday night to find out
if ( 1 ) Prince l.ighifoot made it to
the game, and (2) if her son had
really taken part in that brawl
on the Dumbarton Rridgc.
He assured her everything was
all right.
Friday, two girls were over
heard saying "if you can't believe
The Daily, what can you believe?"
I wasn't aware that we were
looked upon as such an organ
of truth.

All in all, wo arc satisfied that wo produced a Really Fine Rig
Game issue, and didn't tread on anyone's feet. If you were crushed,
please lot us know.
And we are also still trying to find the score of the Kishop-Leland
game to know if sports editor John Schwa i"/, or consensus is the of
ficial predictions champion, and to know if I finished one game or j
three games out of the lead. Went with Poland (any Stanfordite
had better), myself.
Acknowledgments must go to Mad Magazine and Kill Kartozian
(they're sort of similar anyway) for their innocent cooperation in
getting the 80.1 done.
And now, with I he post-Big Game issue mortems out of the way,
it would probably bo best to say something for a change.
Norman's Worst
All in all, it was a rousing game. Although wo must criticize
Dick Norman for throwing one poor pass. That was the rifle-shot
at the end of the first half that was a few feet wide of decapitating
the head linesman.
But l)ick was just giving the ball to the official, just as one is
supposed to do.
In addition to Norman's numerous passing records, I also sub
mit to the NCAA our IM2 yard drivo-that foll-short. And, as Russ
Allen pointed out yesterday, official Kill Fischer for a seasonal roe
ord for flags thrown.
There were more possible records, too. For instance, the number !
of newspaper stories that popped up Sunday complementing the ;
California rooting section for its lovely conduct. All this when the j
conduct was just as atrocious as ever, if not more so.
I understand that Axe Society, or some similar group, was selling
Stanford corsages at the alumni parties in the City Friday night.
I would recommend that next lime Kig Came is played at Stanford,
the Axe Society sell bricks, water bombs, axes and shields to alums
and season ticket-holders, so somebody will be able to throw some
thing back at the barbarians.
In all seriousness, I don't see how any of the "responsible" re
porters of the newspapers that commended Cal's cheering section
could have been at the game and write what they did.
But we have to put the morons somewhere. Kerkeley is a pleasant
town.
Just a !>uimllc
As long as we are trying to be reasonably light-hearted in the
aftermath of the disappointing season, let's turn to some real humor. >
I must admit to using good old hindsight ednoss, but it is at the
expense of one of those often-good for a laugh Southland sports edi
tors. This is the staunch defender of Trojans, the only lad who never
really reneged on his post-Steve Kates incident insistence that Mike
was guilty of absolutely nothing wrong.
Picking up one of his last week columns, I am confronted with
the headline, "SC Cels Kiun Kap in I'oll."
There is an element of truth in what he goes on to say, but only
for a while: "For a West Coast team to win national rating we must
not only win them all hut massacre 'em at the same time."
"That takes care ol' SC.
"The Trojans have the world's greatest manpower hut they would
probably have trouble scoring 10 points on Cal Tech." (A point never
really explained.)
Now we have the punch line. . . .
"SC has one chance left to top the lisf. If the Trojans can beat
I'CI,A by a bigger score than Syracuse does on Dee. ">, they might
make it, or at least score a moral victory."
Sort of a foregone conclusion that the Trojans would never lose
again ?
