"We'll have more height and
more depth this year, but we'll be
a little short on experience." This
is how Coach Howie Dalltnar
sums up Stanford's basketball
picture for the coming season.
The Indians have just three
weeks of practice remaining be
fore their first game against Uni
versity of San Francisco on Dec. I.
Dallmar refuses to name a start
ing lineup at this point saying
"1 have enough confidence in all
the boys to put them it. Every
body will play in the first few
games."
The tall coach will certainly
have difficulty finding replace
ments for ilie likes of Paul Neu
mann and Dick Haga, who
sparked last year's squad. Dall
mar does look forward to one ad
vantage lie did not have last year,
rebounding strength. Right now
it looks like at least half of the
12-man traveling squad will be
sophomores up from last year's
talented frosh team.
The Indians are especially
strong at center where John
Windsor and Neal Brockmeyer
are battling for the starting as
signment. Windsor, (i'K" sopho
more. was the leading scorer on
the frosh team last year. Brock
meyer is a <>'S" senior.
John Hendry, a first stringer
last year, seems certain to nail
down one of the forward spots.
Hendry, a 6'3" junior was fourth
in team scoring as a sophomore.
Other forward candidates in
clude Jim Bryan, G'.'V sophomore;
Jerry Thuesen. (5'7" senior, and
Al Simila ("5" sophomore.
John Arrillaga senior, ap
pears to have the inside track on
one of the guard spots off his fine
performance last year.

Bub Bowling, who Dallmar con
siders Iho most improved player
I on the squad, is leading candidate
for the other backeourt job. Bowl
ing is the shortest man on the
team at 5' 11
John Fontius and Phil K'elly are
| pushing these two for the start
ing berths. Kelly, a sophomore in
I his first year at Stanford, trans
ferred from Menlo Junior College.
The team received a stiff blow
early in the year when flashy
! sophomore Rich Hosley suffered
a neck injury in a surfing acci
dent. llosley, who was counted on
for additional board strength and
I scoring punch, will be out for the
season.
Windsor misser the first half
of practice with an attack of
mononucleosis and Font ins was
I sidelined temporarily with an
| ankle injury.
