### 
Stanford's puzzling Indians con
tinued to find themselves in a
strange paradox after ton weeks
in the football wars as they top
four of llie five individual sta
tistical categories and two of the
team divisions, yet they were un
able to win a single AAWIJ game.
Dick Norman, having himself
an exceptional Big Game, cinched
the leadership in total offon-so
with a total of 20IK yards and in
passing with 19(53 yards on 1.12
completions and II touchdowns.
Stanford's ends again dominate
the pass receiving statistics as
I hoy hold down five of the lop six
positions. Only UCLA's Marv
Luster interrupts the Indian
clique with 19 receptions. Chris
Burford leads the category with
(il receptions and 757 yards.
Skip Faco, the Indians' most
versatile footballer, has nearly
doubled the point output of his
nearest rival, Bob Sehloredt of
Washington, a-s he has racked up

1 ion points to lead the scoring col
umn.
With a big offensive splurge
t against the Cal Bears, the Cards
finally wrestled away the team
total offense leadership from IJSC
j with an average of .'-517 yards per
I game, but the Trojans still have
i a game left to make up the defi
cit.
Stanford has completely run
away with the passing offense
crown as they have more than
doubled their nearest opponent's
efforts with 17(5 completions and
{ 2270 yards.
