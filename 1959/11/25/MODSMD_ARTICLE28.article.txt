## 
### Ron Rapoport 
Stanford's cross-country season
will end with a flourish this week
end ;is the Indians again j>l«'»y host
to the West Coast Cross Country
Championships.
Teams from California, UCLA,
Idaho, San .Jose State, and a host
of Bay Area schools will line up ;it
the Stanford Golf ('nurse at 11 a.m.
Saturday is a meet bringing to-
I gether most of the best distance
runners on the Pacific Coast.
The meet figures to be a contest
between Stanford and Idaho for
team honors as the Indians have
beaten all of the California schools
while the Vandals have cleaned
up in I heir competition against
the Northern schools.
They are currently the North
western champions as tliey have
not been defeated so far this sea
son and have won several AAU
meets this year.
Idaho won the Pacific Coast
Conference championship two
years ago and finished fourth to
USC, Stanford and Oregon on
Stanford's course last year.
The Vandal squad contains four
Englishmen and a Norwegian all
of whom are pretty speedy boys.
Top man on the squad is Ray Mat
ton, a 2N year old Britisher, who
has mile times flown around 1:11
and two-mile clockings of about
; f>: 1 (). These are comparable to
j the be-st times turned in by Indian
runners Bob Mon/.ingo, Keith Wal
lace, Bertil Lundh and Ernie fun
. liffe.
After Hat ton comes Ray Allen,
i an ex-member of the RAP, and
J Frank YVyatt. Wyatt, only run
! ning as third man for Idaho, took
| no less than third place in the
| championships here last year.
I This gives an idea of just how
strong the Vandals are.
Stanford man Wallace has beat
en all the top men in this race,
except for Hat ton who didn't run
last year, but he has been having
his troubles as of late.

Again the thing that the Tribe
will have to count fin for a win
will be tight team running. By i
bunching four or five men up'
among Hie leader's they can offset
not taking one of the top spots.)
Some of the other top men in
the meet are Ken Riding from
UCLA, Alan (Jaylord of Cal and
Charley Clark running for San'
Jose State.

Stanford's Dick Norman was
selected Rack of the Week l>y tho
Associated Press for his perform
ance against Cal last Saturday.
