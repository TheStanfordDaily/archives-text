only Indian to be selected to the
Associated Press All-Coast team.

the NCAA record with 61 recep

by the AP. Washington's triple
threat quarterback Bob Sehloredt
edged him out in the balloting.
Southern California placed
three linemen on the first team,
leading all other AAWU schools.
Mike and Marlin McKeever, guard
and end respectively, and Ron
Mix, tackle, were the honored
Trojans.
The All-Coast backfield con
sisted of Sehloredt at quarter
back, Keith Lincoln of Washing
ton State and Willie West of Ore
gon, halfback; and Ray Smith,
UCLA fullback.
Linemen included McKeever
and Bui ford, ends; Mix and Frank
Sally of California, tackles; Mc-
Keever and Chuck Allen of Wash
ington, guards; and Bob Peterson
of ()regon, center.
