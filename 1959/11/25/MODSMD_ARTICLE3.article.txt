about the Stanford police and
Fire Department, you've got to
adm i t one tiling' — they're

Last night police got a call
that there was a Hashing light
in the Kally Com office on the
third floor of Union. Two po
lice cars and a fire truck re
sponded. Police had no key to
the Kally Com office, so they
entered the Foreign Scholar
ship office next door, crawled
20 feet along the six inch wide
third floor ledge and tried to
get in Kally Coin's window. No
soap.
Fire Chief Marston then pro
ceeded to hreak down the Kally
Com door, just like on TV.
What did they find? A flash
ing Falstalf beer sign hanging
on a closet door, with the elec
tric wire leading inlo the closet.
Closet was locked, so . . .
the lock was broken off, and
the wires ripped out, effectively
turning off the sign. A good
night's work, wouldn't you say?
