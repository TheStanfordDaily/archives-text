# Philosophy Program Is Altered
## 
### 
The Philosophy department has
introduced a new tutorial pro
gram for its 15 senior majors
which gives the students a greater
amount of independent work it
was reported today.
Professor John D. Goheen, head
of the department, and other
members of the philosophy staff
are sharing the tutorial duties
as part of their regular teaching
program.
During the year the students
report once a week with a written
paper on readings in four prin
cipal philosophers- one acient,
one medieval, and two from the
Renaissance to the end of the
19th century.
The short compositions are dis
cussed with emphasis on clear
writing and expression of ideas,
Goheen said. The papers form a
part of the student's record.
No quarter grades will be given,
but a final grade based on a com
prehensive examination at the
end of the year will determine the
student's grade.
These tutored courses represent
about one-third of the student's
full academic load.
Many of the majors in the pro
gram plan graduate work in such
diverse fields as medicine and
business, Goheen reported.
With the completion of the new
Tanner Philosophy Library, ideal
conditions for a tutorial program
will exist, Goheen said. The pro
gram will be extended lo juniors
for the 1960-61 academic year.
