## Man's Good Will Defeat Evil: Bristol 
### Barry Greenberg 
"In spite of the brutality ex
hibited by man throughout his
tory and particularly in the
twentieth century, I firmly believe
that people are basically good and
will eventually stop maiming and
killing each other."
So stated James E. Bristol,
member of the American Friends
Service Committee, last night in
Bowman Alumni House. He i;
also a member of the Philadel
phia Council of Conscientious Ob
jectors.
Inconsistent Means
"Fundamentally, people are try
ing to reach a peaceful end but
are using methods inconsistent
with that end," Bristol said. "A
crop of wheat cannot grow where
you plant dandelion seeds," he
said. "You can only reap what
you sow."
"Nazis, Communists and Amer
icans all seem to have three
things in common," Bristol
averred. "First, that their par
ticular ideology is right and that
all others are wrong. These wrong
people threaten that which is
right. Also, these wrong people
cannot be made to understand."
Preferably Peaceful
"Therefore, what must be done
must bo done. The wrong must be
shown the right way preferably
in peaceful manners but by fight
ing if necessary," Bristol said.
"Here we have the basic con
flict. Instead of trying to correct
the supposed evils in other so
cieties we must first improve the
good in ourselves."
"It basically comes down to the
old matter of good versus evil,"
Bristol continued. "Right now, the
evil in man is on top but that
doesn't mean that it must remain
so."
Pacifist Movement
"Throughout history there have
been movements which have
striven for a world without wars
and injustices," he said. "They
have always failed but it is quite
conceivable that some day a paci
fist movement will succeed. Peo
ple can't go on killing each other
forever."
"II is not enough, however, for
people to want good and it is not
enough to sit back and hope that
some day the good in man will
triumph," Bristol stated.
"It is vital that every individual
act. It is necessary that every
individual realize that self-im
provement will improve society.
Then, and only then, can we have
everlasting peace."
