# 'KNOCK AT DOOR'
## Irish Play Is Staged Successfully 
### Mary Lou McKinley 
Lower middle class life of the
late IKOO's in Dublin was recre
ated Saturday night in a fascinat
ing and extremely well-done pro
duction by the Stanford Players
of Sean O'Casey's "I Knock at the
Door" which will continue j
Wednesday through Saturday
nights of this week at 8:30 in the
Little Theater in Memorial Audi
torium.
Seated on stools placed on a
raised semi-circular platform on
the stage, the six actors are in
complete empathy with O'Casey
throughout the show and through
remarkable feeling and facial ex
pression, make each dramatic se- j
quence alive and meaningful.
"I Knock at the Door" appeared j
in 1939 as the first of a series of
autobiographical novels by
O'Casey and was adapted in 1956 j
by Paul Shyre into a sequence of
dramatic vignettes with a narra
tor, who is O'Casey thinly veiled,
as an organizing storyteller and j
scene-shifter.
Six Play 30 Holes
Shifting in and out of the 30- I
some roles, the six actors provide j
glimpses of life all over Dublin, !
and, however short, each char- j
acterization is clearly drawn and j
each flashback, polished and com- j
piete, with few rough spots to
mar the production.
Acting as the narrator through
out the play, Juris Svendsen does
an outstanding job, smoothly ty
ing the scenes together with feel
ing and a quiet respect for the
story of suffering, tempered with
recurring laughter, which he tells.
Playing Johnny Casside, the
young boy who is driven to pain
and near-blindnes in the name of
"saving him from growing up a
dunce," Paul Hennig does a gen
erally fine job, successfully con
veying the inquiring nature of a
child. Elizabeth Forest gives a
sensitive and excellent perform
ance as his mother.
Humorous Paris
Taking various roles, both ;
Steven Gilborn and Eugene Pey
roux do outstanding jobs, espe
cially with their humorous char
acterizations. Completing the cast,
Dinah Peyroux gives a sincere
portrayal of Ella, the sister, a> |
well as of Johnny's sweetheart ;
whom she also plays.
A major part in the production j
is played by the excellent light- 1
ing, designed by Paul Landry. I
Spot lights were utilized to con- j
centrate attention on the particu
lar people who were speaking in !
each dramatic scene, with close
to-perfect synchronization be- j
tween lighting cues and the fre-!
quent switches of attention be- j
tween narrator and the other |
characters.
Directing the play, James!
Kerans used a minimum of move
ment on the stage but skillfully
provided just enough action at the
right times to compliment the
characterizations, making the
show a play and not just a dra
matic reading.
Slow but Smooth
Although the second act seemed
to move slowly in parts, the cast
took the audience from one se
quence to the next smoothly and
without hesitation, holding their
attention all the way.
The scenery, too, was outstand
ing, adding another credit to do
signer Richard Hay's list of tri-!
limps.
Tickets for the production are
still on sale at Memorial Audi
torium Box Office at $1.25 and
$1.75.

acterization is clearly drawn and j
each flashback, polished and com- j
piete, with few rough spots to
mar the production.
Acting as the narrator through
out the play, Juris Svendsen does
an outstanding job, smoothly ty
ing the scenes together with feel
ing and a quiet respect for the
story of suffering, tempered with
recurring laughter, which he tells.
Playing Johnny Casside, the
young boy who is driven to pain
and near-blindnes in the name of
"saving him from growing up a
dunce," Paul Hennig does a gen
erally fine job, successfully con
veying the inquiring nature of a
child. Elizabeth Forest gives a
sensitive and excellent perform
ance as his mother.
Humorous Paris
Taking various roles, both ;
Steven Gilborn and Eugene Pey
roux do outstanding jobs, espe
cially with their humorous char
acterizations. Completing the cast,
Dinah Peyroux gives a sincere
portrayal of Ella, the sister, a> |
well as of Johnny's sweetheart ;
whom she also plays.
A major part in the production j
is played by the excellent light- 1
ing, designed by Paul Landry. I
Spot lights were utilized to con- j
centrate attention on the particu
lar people who were speaking in !
each dramatic scene, with close
to-perfect synchronization be- j
tween lighting cues and the fre-!
quent switches of attention be- j
tween narrator and the other |
characters.
Directing the play, James!
Kerans used a minimum of move
ment on the stage but skillfully
provided just enough action at the
right times to compliment the
characterizations, making the
show a play and not just a dra
matic reading.
Slow but Smooth
Although the second act seemed
to move slowly in parts, the cast
took the audience from one se
quence to the next smoothly and
without hesitation, holding their
attention all the way.
The scenery, too, was outstand
ing, adding another credit to do
signer Richard Hay's list of tri-!
limps.
Tickets for the production are
still on sale at Memorial Audi
torium Box Office at $1.25 and
$1.75.
Lower middle class life of the
late IKOO's in Dublin was recre
ated Saturday night in a fascinat
ing and extremely well-done pro
duction by the Stanford Players
of Sean O'Casey's "I Knock at the
Door" which will continue j
Wednesday through Saturday
nights of this week at 8:30 in the
Little Theater in Memorial Audi
torium.
Seated on stools placed on a
raised semi-circular platform on
the stage, the six actors are in
complete empathy with O'Casey
throughout the show and through
remarkable feeling and facial ex
pression, make each dramatic se- j
quence alive and meaningful.
"I Knock at the Door" appeared j
in 1939 as the first of a series of
autobiographical novels by
O'Casey and was adapted in 1956 j
by Paul Shyre into a sequence of
dramatic vignettes with a narra
tor, who is O'Casey thinly veiled,
as an organizing storyteller and j
scene-shifter.
Six Play 30 Holes
Shifting in and out of the 30- I
some roles, the six actors provide j
glimpses of life all over Dublin, !
