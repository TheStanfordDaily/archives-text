# Damage to Library Periodicals Increases
## 
### 
There has been a tremendous
increase in the mutilation of
bound library periodicals in the
past six months according to Dr.
G. A. Harrer, Assistant Library
Director.
Harrer stated that the increase
is almost 50 times what is nor
mally found. "Of course, there is
some damage to be expected.
Usually I hear of tine or two seri
ous mutilations a year, but I've
received word of almost 50 vvilh
in the past six months."
Cutting Long Articles
Magazines are usually bound
for the library in volumes com
prising six months or a year.
Harrer said that students are cut
ting entire articles running 8 to
12 pages out of the bound vol
umes, and they sometimes rip the
binding and remove an entire
issue.
Replacing such issues is time
consuming and expensive. Har
rer emphasized that if the issues
date back more than a few years,
it is often impossible to obtain
replacements. The missing pages
must be photostated, at a cost of
$l-$2 per page, reprinted and
then rebound, also an expensive
process.
Harrer also stressed the fact

that a person who mutilates a
periodical often deprives others of
its use for a period of years, for
il sometimes takes that long to
obtain replacements.
Brando, Capital Punishment
Harrer listed several examples
of recent mutilations. Most of
the articles of Marlon Brando
have been removed from recent
issues of several sets of periodi
cals. The same is true for recent
articles on capital punishment.
Therefore if anyone wanted to
write a paper on capital punish
ment, he would find no recent
articles on it in Stanford's library.
Ilarrer stressed that mutilation
of periodicals is a very serious
Honor Cole violation. Those
caught are usually expelled.
Duplicating Materials
Duplicating machines are avail
able in the library for the use of
anyone who would like to copy a
portion of an article. The ma
chines will copy single pages or
pages bound in volumes. Dupli
cating paper may be bought at
the Current Periodicals desk for
ten cents a sheet Harrer said that
other arrangements are some
times made if an article is urgent
ly needed.
