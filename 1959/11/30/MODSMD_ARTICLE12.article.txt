# This Doorbell Woke 'em All
## 
### 
('rothers liall residents have
found that their dorm is equip
ped with a "doorbell." and a
very effective one at that.
The discovery was made
Thanksgiving Day by a 72-year
old visitor who, not knowing
the room number of his law
student friend, proceeded to
page the RA by obeying the
sign, "Pull down handle, then
pull down lever."
He paged the RA, all right.
Also responding to the "door
bell" were four shiny red en
gines, Captain Midnight, Mrs.
Ermine Michaud, director of
the two Crothers dorms, and 10
sleepy law students.
