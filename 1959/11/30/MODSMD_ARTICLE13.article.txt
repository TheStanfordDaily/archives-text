'Dozens of Leads'
Stanford Police Chief Gordon
David said that police have been
tracking down "dozens of leads,"
mostly from people who think
they might have seen something
and have called police.
Opsahl was seen in the drive
way by two persons in a sports
car who drove past him Friday
The couple thought the
body was a dummy in a fraternity
prank. Schmidt said. When they
read about the death, they called
police.
Blood-Alcohol Tests
Schmidt stated that a blood
alcohol test run on Opsahl proved
that he was "close to unconscious
ness" at the time he was killed.
Opsahl's blood-alcohol level regis
tered .21. A level of .10 is consid
ered to put a person "under the
influence" and a .15 level is in
toxicating, Schmidt explained.
Police did not conduct a blood
alcohol test on Crary. He has
admitted that he and Opsahl had
been drinking heavily all that
niiiht.
Deputy District Attorney Ern
est Schmidt said last week that
additional blood and other ma
terials found on the front end of
Steve Crary's car arc now being
tested to determine whether or
not they could have come from
John Opsahl. He said that he ex
pects a report from the Santa
Clara County Crime Laboratory

the blood, hair and flesh found
underneath Crary's car were
those of a rabbit.
