Red Cina's Export-Import Corp.,
"was kidnaped by personnel of
the United States consulate gen
eral in Bombay at around 11 a.m.
on Nov. 26 and was detained in
the U.S. consulate general and
its building at the Bombay beach.
'Threats, Pressure'
"During this period, by apply
ing serious threats and crude
pressure, the personnel of the U.S.
consulate general forced Chang
Chien-yu to make a statement
against his will.
"At 7 a.m. on the 27th when the
American kidnapers were taking
Chang Chien-yu to Bombay city
by car and passing the vicinity of
the Chinese consulate general,
Chang Chien-yu managed to
escape and ran back to the Chi
nese consulate general.
Knife Chase
"Thereupon, the personnel of
the U.S. consulate general escort
ing him immediately chased him
with knife in hand.
"This was discovered by other
personnel. The Chinese consulate
general who, while stopping the
American from carrying out his
criminal intention and protecting
Chang Chien-yu, informed the In
dian police authorities in Bombay
by telephone. Soon after, the Bom
bay police authorities dispatched
persons who took away the Amer
ican."
U.S. Version
