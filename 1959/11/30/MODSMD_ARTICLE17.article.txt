# The 						Bike Problems
## 
### 
The rise ill Stanford's student population, increasing costs and
difficulties of operating a car here, and continuing expansion of
classroom facilities have combined to bring more and more bicycles
onto campus.
Concurrent with the rise in the number of bikes has been a rise
in the problems they create —but no such rise in action to cope
with the situation.
It is granted that hikes are a worthwhile convenience and in
some cases a virtual necessity, and that their presence probably
helps cut down on the car traffic problem on campus. But we
believe some restrictions and crackdowns on bikes and their
operators are needed in face of a mounting safety problem.
The number of bikes continually speeding through inner quad
has in some areas made it almost unsafe to walk. The problem is
particularly serious at the many blind intersections of foot and
bike flow, such as at the entrance to quad directly across from
the Main Library. What makes these areas unsafe is the tendency
of bike riders to get through as quickly as possible, regardless
of people in the way.
The ironic thing is that somewhere or other is a ruling that
hikes are not to he allowed on inner quad. We think this ruling
should be enforced. If bikes can be parked around outer quad,
this should be sufficiently convenient to classes.
Enforcing a iio-hikes-on-quad rule wouldn't be too difficult.
All that would he needed would be for the police or corporation
yard to bring in a pick-up truck at about 10:10 for a few morn
ings and pick up all the bikes parked on inner quad.
Moving from quad to the street, the principal problem is the
failure of bike riders to observe traffic controls. We'd be sur
prised if as many as one per cent of bike riders stop at stop signs.
Here, too, the situation could be helped if a few of Gordon
Davis* policemen spent their mornings giving out tickets to bike
riders instead of illegal parkers. Running stop signs can cause
accidents a lot easier than parking for an hour in a 40-minute
zone.
Hike parking poses a third problem. The area in front of
Cubberley Hall is a particularly vivid example, as hundreds of
bikes sprawl in a mishmash around a few inadequate hike racks.
The solution to this lies to a great extent in providing ample
racks. Locating such racks around the outside of quad would tie
in with enforcement of the no-bikes-on-inner-quad rule.
To many, these problems may seem inconsequential. But a
few bike riders knocked down after running stop signs or a few
more flying over the handlebars after hitting a pedestrian might
make them think about it a little more.
\\ e got one improvement a year ago when the hike paths were
improved. We ask now for further improvement with more racks,
tickets for traffic violators, and elimination of bikes from inner
quad.

operators are needed in face of a mounting safety problem.
The number of bikes continually speeding through inner quad
has in some areas made it almost unsafe to walk. The problem is
particularly serious at the many blind intersections of foot and
bike flow, such as at the entrance to quad directly across from
the Main Library. What makes these areas unsafe is the tendency
of bike riders to get through as quickly as possible, regardless
of people in the way.
The ironic thing is that somewhere or other is a ruling that
hikes are not to he allowed on inner quad. We think this ruling
should be enforced. If bikes can be parked around outer quad,
this should be sufficiently convenient to classes.
Enforcing a iio-hikes-on-quad rule wouldn't be too difficult.
All that would he needed would be for the police or corporation
yard to bring in a pick-up truck at about 10:10 for a few morn
ings and pick up all the bikes parked on inner quad.
Moving from quad to the street, the principal problem is the
failure of bike riders to observe traffic controls. We'd be sur
prised if as many as one per cent of bike riders stop at stop signs.
Here, too, the situation could be helped if a few of Gordon
Davis* policemen spent their mornings giving out tickets to bike
riders instead of illegal parkers. Running stop signs can cause
accidents a lot easier than parking for an hour in a 40-minute
zone.
Hike parking poses a third problem. The area in front of
Cubberley Hall is a particularly vivid example, as hundreds of
bikes sprawl in a mishmash around a few inadequate hike racks.
The solution to this lies to a great extent in providing ample
racks. Locating such racks around the outside of quad would tie
in with enforcement of the no-bikes-on-inner-quad rule.
To many, these problems may seem inconsequential. But a
few bike riders knocked down after running stop signs or a few
more flying over the handlebars after hitting a pedestrian might
make them think about it a little more.
\\ e got one improvement a year ago when the hike paths were
improved. We ask now for further improvement with more racks,
tickets for traffic violators, and elimination of bikes from inner
quad.
The rise ill Stanford's student population, increasing costs and
difficulties of operating a car here, and continuing expansion of
classroom facilities have combined to bring more and more bicycles
onto campus.
Concurrent with the rise in the number of bikes has been a rise
in the problems they create —but no such rise in action to cope
with the situation.
It is granted that hikes are a worthwhile convenience and in
some cases a virtual necessity, and that their presence probably
helps cut down on the car traffic problem on campus. But we
believe some restrictions and crackdowns on bikes and their
operators are needed in face of a mounting safety problem.
