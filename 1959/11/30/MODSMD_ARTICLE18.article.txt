## Drinking on Campus 
### Doug Willis 
Following the hit - run death
of Sigma Nu John Opsahl nine
days ago University officials and
the Alcoholic Beverage Commis
sion have shown concern over the
problem of campus drinking.
Dean of Men William Craig is
investigating the circumstances
under which drinking took place
prior to Opsahl's death, and the
Interfraternity Board will study
group behavior in relation to the
drinking problem and will prob
ably submit recommendations to
the University.
Student views of the problem
are varied:
Foreign scholar Ferruli De
mirmen of Turkey said that he
didn't think that the University
should place any restriction on
drinking on the campus.
"This is a University and stu
dents should have enough ma
turity to decide on drinking for
themselves," Demirmen said. "This
decision is a small responsibility
and students will have much larg
er responsibilities when they
graduate. If they can't handle
this one then they are defeating
the purpose of their college edu
cation."
An off-campus student ex
plained that drinking on campus
should not be a problem for the
University. "It is a violation of
the Fundamental Standard, so it
is a personal problem. But this is
not a problem that strict enforce
ment of the law will help."
A student living in a Uni
versity dormitory said that the
main reason that drinking on

campus is a problem is tlie in
consistent University policy.
"They say that liquor is for
bidden on campus, but everyone
knows that you can get away with
it. If they're going to forbid it,
then they ought to enforce it."
Two junior women, Donna
Lecrivain and Sharon Mattila,
said that drinking on campus is
made into a problem by the Uni
versity. "If drinking wasn't
stressed as something to get away
with, then there probably would
not be as much of it."
Freshman George Beinhorn
said, "I don't think that drink
ing on campus is a problem. I
haven't seen much of it in my
house and I think that the rules
on it are all right as they are."
Another freshman said that he
thought that it would be better
to allow drinking in the houses.
"We'll do it anyway, and it's
bettor not to have to drive back
to campus after drinking. I think
that it would be a lot safer and
more sensible to let us have beer
on campus."
A visiting student from the
University of Wisconsin com
mented that drinking on campus
is a problem on most campuses.
"But whatever is done, it will con
tinue to be a problem," she said.
"It should be stopped," an
other girl said, "because we are
not at Stanford to .just drink or
socialize. I think that the Dean
could stop it if he wanted to,
but now the University seems
to just ignore it as much as
possible."

Following the hit - run death
of Sigma Nu John Opsahl nine
days ago University officials and
the Alcoholic Beverage Commis
sion have shown concern over the
problem of campus drinking.
Dean of Men William Craig is
investigating the circumstances
under which drinking took place
prior to Opsahl's death, and the
Interfraternity Board will study
group behavior in relation to the
drinking problem and will prob
ably submit recommendations to
the University.
Student views of the problem
are varied:
Foreign scholar Ferruli De
mirmen of Turkey said that he
didn't think that the University
should place any restriction on
drinking on the campus.
"This is a University and stu
dents should have enough ma
turity to decide on drinking for
themselves," Demirmen said. "This
decision is a small responsibility
and students will have much larg
er responsibilities when they
graduate. If they can't handle
this one then they are defeating
the purpose of their college edu
cation."
An off-campus student ex
plained that drinking on campus
should not be a problem for the
University. "It is a violation of
the Fundamental Standard, so it
is a personal problem. But this is
not a problem that strict enforce
ment of the law will help."
A student living in a Uni
versity dormitory said that the
main reason that drinking on

campus is a problem is tlie in
consistent University policy.
"They say that liquor is for
bidden on campus, but everyone
knows that you can get away with
it. If they're going to forbid it,
then they ought to enforce it."
Two junior women, Donna
Lecrivain and Sharon Mattila,
said that drinking on campus is
made into a problem by the Uni
versity. "If drinking wasn't
stressed as something to get away
with, then there probably would
not be as much of it."
Freshman George Beinhorn
said, "I don't think that drink
ing on campus is a problem. I
haven't seen much of it in my
house and I think that the rules
on it are all right as they are."
Another freshman said that he
thought that it would be better
to allow drinking in the houses.
"We'll do it anyway, and it's
bettor not to have to drive back
to campus after drinking. I think
that it would be a lot safer and
more sensible to let us have beer
on campus."
A visiting student from the
University of Wisconsin com
mented that drinking on campus
is a problem on most campuses.
"But whatever is done, it will con
tinue to be a problem," she said.
"It should be stopped," an
other girl said, "because we are
not at Stanford to .just drink or
socialize. I think that the Dean
could stop it if he wanted to,
but now the University seems
to just ignore it as much as
possible."
