Opsahl Case

Editor, The Daily:
On Nov. 23, 1959, The Stanford
Daily accused Stephen A. Crary,
20, of the auto slaying of John G.
Opashl, 18, his friend and frater
nity brother.
The Daily refrained from label
ing Crary guilty in so many
words. The Daily described
Crary's intoxication at the time
of the accident and assasinated
his character with a reference to
an earlier "false 1.D." arrest.
The accusation came when The
Daily described in some detail
how Opsahl met his death under
a yet unidentified auto driven by
a presently unknown person. In
reconstructing the accident. The
Daily began its narrative with
the words: "Crary apparently. .
The word "apparently" does not
relieve The Daily of responsibility
for the ensuing description of how
Crary allegedly drove over his

friend's body, backed up, and then
fled the scene. The word "ap
parently" qualified the mechanics
of the crime the impact, brak
ing, backing and fleeing by plac
ing Crary at the wheel of the
death car, The Daily accused him.
No apology has been forthcom
ing.
None is expected from a news
paper staff so ignorant of news
ipaper custom, law and the stand
ard rules of decency.
M. R. Montgomery, Jr.
Editor's Note: If Mr. Mont
gomery will re-read the story
in question, lie will find no
mention of a "false 1.D." arrest
of anyone. There is no mention
of any previous arrests of
C'rary. Opsahl is noted as hav
ing been "arrested in Septem
ber for purchasing beer un
der age," but there is noth
ing to say that the use of
false identification was in
volved. The details of the

supposed mechanics of the acci
dent and flic supposition that
C'rary had driven the car were
all given by police accounts, as
the overall story makes evident.
In addition, analysis of evidence
which appeared to clear C'rary
in the case were told in The
Daily of Nov. 24 in a story
played more prominently than
was the initial story.

Daily described in some detail
how Opsahl met his death under
a yet unidentified auto driven by
a presently unknown person. In
reconstructing the accident. The
Daily began its narrative with
the words: "Crary apparently. .
The word "apparently" does not
relieve The Daily of responsibility
for the ensuing description of how
Crary allegedly drove over his

friend's body, backed up, and then
fled the scene. The word "ap
parently" qualified the mechanics
of the crime the impact, brak
ing, backing and fleeing by plac
ing Crary at the wheel of the
death car, The Daily accused him.
No apology has been forthcom
ing.
None is expected from a news
paper staff so ignorant of news

ard rules of decency.

Editor's Note: If Mr. Mont
gomery will re-read the story
in question, lie will find no
mention of a "false 1.D." arrest
of anyone. There is no mention
of any previous arrests of
C'rary. Opsahl is noted as hav
ing been "arrested in Septem
ber for purchasing beer un
der age," but there is noth
ing to say that the use of
false identification was in
volved. The details of the

supposed mechanics of the acci
dent and flic supposition that
C'rary had driven the car were
all given by police accounts, as
the overall story makes evident.
In addition, analysis of evidence
which appeared to clear C'rary
in the case were told in The
Daily of Nov. 24 in a story
played more prominently than
was the initial story.
Opsahl Case

Editor, The Daily:
On Nov. 23, 1959, The Stanford
Daily accused Stephen A. Crary,
20, of the auto slaying of John G.
Opashl, 18, his friend and frater
nity brother.
The Daily refrained from label
ing Crary guilty in so many
words. The Daily described
Crary's intoxication at the time
of the accident and assasinated
his character with a reference to
an earlier "false 1.D." arrest.
