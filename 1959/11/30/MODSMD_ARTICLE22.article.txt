# Eisenhower Asks Increase In Foreign Military Aid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) President
Eisenhower has decided to ask
| Congress for a new foreign aid
appropriation of slightly more
I than four billion dollars, includ
[ ing a substantial increase in funds
I for military assistance.
In essence it means a triumph
| for the State and Defense depart
ments' foreign aid planners in
I their struggle with the expense
trimmers , of the Budget Bureau
and the Treasury Department.
The decision also appears to re
flect a conviction on Eisenhower's
part that Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev's campaign for
"peaceful coexistence" and Eisen
hower's own drive to ease East-
West tension does not warrant
the slightest relaxation of effort
by the United States, its allies
and the other free nations it
helps.
Eisenhower's decision on the
new foreign aid appropriation
means that in the countries he
visits next month which rely on
substantial U.S. help for their
economic growth, the President's
commitment to a sustained aid
program will not be in question.
The appropriation schedule
now being developed is for pres
entation to Congress early in the
19G0 session. The aid total, of
ficials indicated, is to be about
J $4,100,000,000, divided almost
evenly between economic and mil
itary assistance.
At the last session of Congress

the Eisenhower administration re
quested a military aid appropria
tion of $1,600,000,000. Congress
voter! $1,300,000,000. Thus the
new total represents ;i consider
able increase as far as the ad
ministration's request goes.
Last session, the Pr e si d en t
asked Congres for $3,900,000,000
in new funds for economic aid.
Congress cut this by $700 million.
Eisenhower's expected release
of arms aid funds for Latin-Amer
ican countries will be based on
his finding that such assistance is
important to Western Hemisphere
defense.
