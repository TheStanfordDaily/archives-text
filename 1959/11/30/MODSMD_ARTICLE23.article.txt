# STANFORD SECOND
## Vandal Harriers Capture Crown 
### 
Favored Idaho, not-so-fresh
after a plane ride from Louis
ville, Kentucky, nonetheless came
on strong to win the first annual
Stanford West Coast cross-coun
try championships here Saturday.
The Vandals, led by 1-2 finishers
Ray Hatton and Ray Allen, scored
a low of 22 points to 28 for Stan
ford, 42 for UCLA, and 52 for
California.
Well Traveled Squad
It was the second good showing
in three days for Idaho, which
had taken a third in the National
AAU race Thursday in Louisville.
In that event, Hatton and Allen
ran 4-5.
Saturday's race was a five-man
affair most of the way. Hatton.
Allen, Alan Gaylord of Cal, Ken
Riding of UCLA and Keith Wal
lace of Stanford all moved to the
fore early. After a mile of the
4.2 mile run, the quintet had
opened up a sizeable gap over the
rest of the field.
Though Jhe five were within
about 10 yards of each other over
the first three miles. Hatton was
nearly always the leader. Wallace
ranged from fifth to second, al
ways falling back after moving
to second.
Allen and Gaylord kept up a
running battle for second when
ever Wallace fell back, while Rid
ing was primarily involved in
trying to get fourth away from
Wallace.
Hatton Pulled Away
Hatton finally pulled away over
the last 1.2 miles, and Allen
opened up a lead on Gaylord.
With 151) yards to go, Wallace
was pulling away from Riding
and appeared to have cinched
fourth. "But then the Bruin kicked
hard, and took the fourth spot
by a little over one second.
Hat ton's winning effort of
20:22.1 was the second-fastest
time ever registered on the Stan
ford course. USC's Max Truex
holds the record of 20:15.8, turned
in at last year's Pacific Coast
Conference title meet.
Making the team score differ
ence for Idaho was the late spurt
of Frank Wyatt. Wyatt was back
in about 20th place much of the
way, but rallied for an eighth
place finish that shoved the Van
dal score below Stanford's.
The Indians ran their usual
tight race, with their four scorers
in ihe top ten finishers. Bob
Monzingo came up with one of his
stronger finishes and took sixth.
Bertil Lundh was seventh and
Ernie Cunliffe tenth. Stanford's
other starters, John North way
and Rich Klier, finished 13th and
16th.
