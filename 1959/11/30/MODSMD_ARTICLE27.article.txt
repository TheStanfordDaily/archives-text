# Burford, Norman Highlight '59 Daily All-Coast Grid Choices
## 
### 
With the 19.19 football season
practically in the history books,
the Daily sports staff has come up
with its 1959 All Pacific Coast
fool ball squad.
This year's all star team in
cludes two players from Stan
ford, two from USC, two from
Washington State, two from
Washington and one each from
COP and Cal.
Chris Burford of Stanford and
Gail Cogdill of Washington State
were selected at ends, Bill Kin
nune of Washington and Frank
Sally of California made the tac
kle posts, Chuck Allen of Wash
ington and Mike McKoever of
USC were the guards chosen, Bob
Peterson of Oregon took Ihe nod
at center, and the backfield posi
tions went to Dick Norman of
Stanford, Keith Lincoln of Wash
ington State; Dick Bass of COP,
and Clark Holden of USC.
Five Juniors
Of the top eleven Kinnune,
Allen, McKoever, Norman, and
Lincoln are all juniors and have
one more year of college football.
The other six are seniors.
Burford and Cogdill represent
two of the best receivers in the
country. Burford led the nation
in pass receiving with 61 comple
tions, and Cogdill finished
amongst the nation's top 15 pass
snarers.
Kinnune and Sally have been
stalwarts of the Washington and
Cal lines respectively. Kinnune at
205 pounds was one of the main
reasons this year's Washington
Huskies were so strong up front.
Sally who began his career at
Cal as a guard reached his peak
as a tackle this past year and
was the only consistent lineman
Cal had.
McKeever's selection needs lit
tle explanation. Despite a few el
bow episodes McKoever distin
guished himself as the outstand
ing lineman on a tough USC for

ward wall. McKeever led his team
in tackles and combined with his
his brother Marlin marie nearly
one third of all SC tackles this
past year.
Two Time Winner
Allen, although not as heralded
in the press as McKeever, is in his
own right one of the best guards
in the nation. Named twice this
year as the AAWU lineman of the
week, Alien is Rose Bowl bound
Washington's top lineman.
Bob Peterson has been an out
standing center at Oregon all
three of his years on the varsity
team in Eugene. Both defensively
and offensively Peterson supplied
Oregon with a tremendous job.
Dick Norman, the nation's
leading passer and total offense
king, had a tough time beating
out Washington's Bob Schloredt
and Oregon's Dave Grosz for the
quarterback spot. However, Nor-

I man's strong finish was enough
to gain the rangy quarterback the
nod.
Keith Lincoln who does just
about everything there is to be
I done on a football field was the
top vote gainer among the backs.
Lincoln was Washington State's
i top runner, he threw several im
portant passes during the year, he
j did the Cougars punting, and he
played excellently on defense.
About the only thing Lincoln
didn't do was manicure the field
! between games.
Injury Trouble
Dick Bass, last year's scoring,
I rushing, and total offense leader,
I was bothered by several injuries
this year. However, the speedy
'COP halfback despite his injuries
ended up amongst the top five
rushers in the nation, and was
far_ahead of any other rusher on
| the Coast.
Clark Holden got the fullback
bid despite the fact that his team
! mate and also fullback, Jerry
j Traynham, outgained Holden.
Holden, however, was at his
, toughest when the chips were
down. Against Stanford Ihe
j chunky back had a sensational
day scoring four touchdowns and
| rolling up over 100 yards.
The second team which was
also selected consisted of Ben
Robinson of Stanford and Marlin
McKeever of USC at ends, tackles
Paul Oglesby of UCLA and Ron
| Mix of USC, A 1 Bansavage of USC
and Pete Domoto of Cal, guards,
Roy McKasson of Washington,
center, and Bob Schloredt, Wash
! ington, Willie West, Oregon, Skip

Faco, Stanford, and Henry Wal
lace. COP, in the backfield.

stalwarts of the Washington and

Sally who began his career at

was the only consistent lineman
Cal had.
McKeever's selection needs lit
tle explanation. Despite a few el

his brother Marlin marie nearly
one third of all SC tackles this

Two Time Winner
Allen, although not as heralded

Bob Peterson has been an out
standing center at Oregon all
three of his years on the varsity

Oregon with a tremendous job.
Dick Norman, the nation's
leading passer and total offense

out Washington's Bob Schloredt

to gain the rangy quarterback the
nod.
Keith Lincoln who does just
about everything there is to be
I done on a football field was the
top vote gainer among the backs.
Lincoln was Washington State's

j did the Cougars punting, and he
played excellently on defense.
About the only thing Lincoln
didn't do was manicure the field
! between games.
Injury Trouble
Dick Bass, last year's scoring,

I was bothered by several injuries
this year. However, the speedy
'COP halfback despite his injuries
ended up amongst the top five

far_ahead of any other rusher on
| the Coast.
Clark Holden got the fullback
bid despite the fact that his team
! mate and also fullback, Jerry
j Traynham, outgained Holden.
Holden, however, was at his
, toughest when the chips were

j chunky back had a sensational

to gain the rangy quarterback the
nod.
Keith Lincoln who does just
about everything there is to be
I done on a football field was the
top vote gainer among the backs.
Lincoln was Washington State's
i top runner, he threw several im
portant passes during the year, he
j did the Cougars punting, and he
played excellently on defense.
About the only thing Lincoln
didn't do was manicure the field
! between games.
Injury Trouble
Dick Bass, last year's scoring,
I rushing, and total offense leader,
I was bothered by several injuries
this year. However, the speedy
'COP halfback despite his injuries
ended up amongst the top five
rushers in the nation, and was
far_ahead of any other rusher on
| the Coast.
Clark Holden got the fullback
bid despite the fact that his team
! mate and also fullback, Jerry
j Traynham, outgained Holden.
Holden, however, was at his
, toughest when the chips were
down. Against Stanford Ihe
j chunky back had a sensational
day scoring four touchdowns and
| rolling up over 100 yards.
The second team which was
also selected consisted of Ben
Robinson of Stanford and Marlin
McKeever of USC at ends, tackles
Paul Oglesby of UCLA and Ron
| Mix of USC, A 1 Bansavage of USC
and Pete Domoto of Cal, guards,
Roy McKasson of Washington,
center, and Bob Schloredt, Wash
! ington, Willie West, Oregon, Skip

Faco, Stanford, and Henry Wal
lace. COP, in the backfield.

DICK BASS
Top coast rusher
With the 19.19 football season
practically in the history books,
the Daily sports staff has come up
with its 1959 All Pacific Coast
fool ball squad.
This year's all star team in
cludes two players from Stan
ford, two from USC, two from
Washington State, two from
Washington and one each from
COP and Cal.
Chris Burford of Stanford and
Gail Cogdill of Washington State
were selected at ends, Bill Kin
nune of Washington and Frank
Sally of California made the tac
kle posts, Chuck Allen of Wash
ington and Mike McKoever of
USC were the guards chosen, Bob
Peterson of Oregon took Ihe nod
at center, and the backfield posi
tions went to Dick Norman of
Stanford, Keith Lincoln of Wash
ington State; Dick Bass of COP,
and Clark Holden of USC.
Five Juniors
Of the top eleven Kinnune,
Allen, McKoever, Norman, and
Lincoln are all juniors and have
one more year of college football.
The other six are seniors.
Burford and Cogdill represent
two of the best receivers in the
country. Burford led the nation
in pass receiving with 61 comple
tions, and Cogdill finished
amongst the nation's top 15 pass
snarers.
Kinnune and Sally have been
stalwarts of the Washington and
Cal lines respectively. Kinnune at
205 pounds was one of the main
reasons this year's Washington
Huskies were so strong up front.
Sally who began his career at
Cal as a guard reached his peak
as a tackle this past year and
was the only consistent lineman
Cal had.
McKeever's selection needs lit
tle explanation. Despite a few el
bow episodes McKoever distin
guished himself as the outstand
ing lineman on a tough USC for

ward wall. McKeever led his team
in tackles and combined with his
his brother Marlin marie nearly
one third of all SC tackles this
past year.
Two Time Winner
Allen, although not as heralded
in the press as McKeever, is in his
own right one of the best guards
in the nation. Named twice this
year as the AAWU lineman of the
week, Alien is Rose Bowl bound
Washington's top lineman.
Bob Peterson has been an out
standing center at Oregon all
three of his years on the varsity
team in Eugene. Both defensively
and offensively Peterson supplied
Oregon with a tremendous job.
Dick Norman, the nation's
leading passer and total offense
king, had a tough time beating
out Washington's Bob Schloredt
and Oregon's Dave Grosz for the
quarterback spot. However, Nor-

I man's strong finish was enough
to gain the rangy quarterback the
nod.
