## 
### 
Interviews will continue through Friday at the IIR Shack from
2:30 to 4:30 p.m. to select members of the Stanford delegation to
the Model United Nations which will be held in Berkeley in early
April.
The ten delegates and three alternates will meet Wednesday

nights during Winter Quarter for
one unit of advanced seminar
credit in International Relations.
The purpose of these meetings
will be to discuss issues to be
brought up at the MUN and to
prepare resolutions and speeches.
Stanford, as a result of last
year's performance, got its first
choice of country assignment, the
United Kingdom, which means
thai it will have an important seat
in the Security Council.
From Thirteen Slates
Delegates from many univers
ities and colleges in 13 Western
slates will attend the MUN and
'each delegation will represent a
country in the United Nations.
Speakers from the U.N. will ad
dress the MUN General Assembly
and there will be national cover
age of the meetings.
Issues to be discussed include
Khrushchev's total disarmament
proposal, the Berlin question, and
nationalism in Britain's colonies.
The Stanford delegation will be
broken down to place one repre
sentative on the Security Council,
one on the International Court
of Justice and the rest on com
mittees of the U.N.
'I nvaluable Experience'
A member of last year's dele
gation has commented, "The ex
perience of caucasing in the mid
dle of the night, or trying to
swing the French delegation to
support a vital bill of yours, or
making a speech to the General
Assembly is an invaluable one
which can never be forgotten."
Delegates will be selected by
Bob Saylor, delegation chairman,
Jim Kurth, IIR vice president in
charge of conferences, and Julie
Beard, IIR director of external
conferences. Tryouts will be very
general, according to Saylor,
based mainly on knowledge of
British foreign policy. He has
encouraged members of all
classes to sign up at the IIR Shack
for interview times.
