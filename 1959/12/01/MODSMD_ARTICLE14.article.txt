# Sequoia Is Successful Effort'
## 
### Jerry Rankin 
Sequoia's twelfth issue is an
other in a series of successful
literary efforts by Stanford stu
dents. It is well edited, well writ
ten, makes tasteful use of its art
and is attractively laid out.
Probably the most interesting
contribution is the lead aiMicle,
"Moscow Looks at the U.S.A."
by Jane Gary. Miss Gary received
her A.B. in Russian from Stanford
in June and was one of 75 guides
at the American exhibition in
Moscow during the summer.
Her article describes the im
pressions she gathered during her
Soviet stay, and gives a first-hand
account of what the headline
making exhibition looked like to
typical Russian citizens.
Soviet Questions
It also gives an idea of how
little the average American really
thinks about this country, simply
by listing some of the questions
the Soviets asked guides.
How many Stanford students
for example, could give a clear,
immediate answer, backed by a

sound knowledge of their coun
try, to such questions as:
"You read your papers; you arc
here now. Tell me, please, how
many lies are told about us in
your country?"
"Why don't Americans like
' Negroes? Why is the Ku Klux
Klan a legal organization?"
More Questions
"Why is it that bread is 35 cents
a kilogram and sugar 25 cents a
kilo in the U.S.A.? Can sugar be
cheaper than bread?"
Miss Gary's report leaves the
reader wishing its nine pages
were 90.
Scottish student Robin Mae-
Donald's "A Talked-About Man"
! is a fine story. His use of Scottish
dialogue lends an authentic touch,
i although some readers may be
| able to guess the climax about
! two pages before the end.
Betty Kantor's "Stanford-in
-1 Germany: A Reappraisal" raises
; some points which certainly de-
I serve answers. She criticises sev-
I eral aspects of the "Burg" and
then otters her suggestions as to
what might be done to improve
the situation.

She writes of "parties at which
1 Germans talked to Germans be
, cause the Americans stuck to
: got her." She tells of one party
! where the Stanford students
I "were eager for the Germans to
leave so that the Americans
could got on with the party."
Miss Kan tor advocates, among
other things, moving the Burg to
I a university town or large city
so that the students could he near
German university students. The
shift could also help overcome
transportation and language dif
i ficulties, she says.
It would be interesting to see
a rebuttal by the University or
j by another Burg student of the
. same group as Miss Kan tor.
Host Fiction Work
Sequoia editor Frances Motv
| son's "New York Is a Summer
; Festival" is the best fiction work.
It is professionally done, with
i clever dashts of humor.
The last story, "Moonkillers,"
by Sheila Thorne Harper, is a
commendable first published ef
fort, although the reader must
contend with an overabundance
of adject ivos on every page.
