Stanford's new Interfraternity
Board yesterday deferred until
a week from Thursday any action
against the Sigma Nu fraternity
house on charges of alcohol corn
sumption within the campus resi
dence.
Reason for the deferment, ac
cording to Interfraternity Coun
cil President and Board Chairman
Cap Ingham,'' was incomplete ap
pointments td the new board.
Three fraternity appointments
are yet to be made to the student-
University officials Board, and
action without them was deemed
"unwise" at yesterday's meeting.
New Appointments
The three members were se
lected at last night's IFC meet
ing. Named to the council were:

During yesterday's 3 - hour

pledge officers and other Sigma
Nu representatives were ques
tioned about the fraternity's plans
and policies.
Action to be taken next week
will depend upon "the house's
plans for the future and the nai
ture of past activities," according
to Ingham.
