States in opening tlie party's first
Congress since the 19.36 uprising.
Kadar placed major blame for

the 1956 uprising on "internation
al imperialism headed by U.S. re

troops still garrisoned in Hun
gary. The Soviet leader is expect
ed to address the congress today.
A troop withdrawal would help
along Khrushchev's current cam

tention that living -standards are
up, the people are contented and
his regime is stronger than ever.

as a worker for peace and ad.ded:
"We are happy that he is now
among us and we heartily con

his trip to the United States."

to improve relations with the
United States but blamed Wash
ington for current difficulties.
"A considerable portion of the
125 million dollars appropriated
by the U.S. Congress for subver
sive purposes is used against
Hungary," Kadar said.

"A considerable portion of the
125 million dollars appropriated
by the U.S. Congress for subver
sive purposes is used against
Hungary," Kadar said.
