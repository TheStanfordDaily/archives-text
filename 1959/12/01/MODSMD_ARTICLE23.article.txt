# It's Our Loss

Yesterday's Daily reported a statement by llie assistant director
of Stanford libraries to the effect that vandalism and damage
to bound periodicals has increased nearly fifty times over the
past six months.
The sort of problems this poses are obvious —the library must
spend valuable time and already scarce funds to repair the dam
age, and other persons wishing to use the damaged material are
denied the opportunity to do so.
Unfortunately, the problems created are far easier to see than
the solutions whieh are needed.
There is need to prevent such acts from occurring at all, not
merely for punishment after the act.
Confronting the immature class of individuals who go around
tearing up the volumes with the threat that they are violating
Fundamental Standard can't be expected to help much, since this
type of person isn't likely to he very impressed with Fun Stan
in the first place.
The library could greatly limit access to periodicals or close
it off entirely—but this would hardly solve the problem in a
positive fashion.
Perhaps the problem will be alleviated somewhat simply by
the disclosure of what is going on. But in case this isn't sufficient,
il may help to stress that the unnecessary expenditures brought
about b\ such a situation come from just one place—your pock
ets and ours. And in the same vein, il is we and not the library
staff who need the damaged material to write term papers and
the like.
So why cut our own throats and pocketbooks by such ridicu
lous means as tearing up articles in the library?
