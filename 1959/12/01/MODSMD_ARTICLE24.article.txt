There is one thing we better
get clear right off -so that there
is no doubt about it:
The American government
and the American people do not
accept the Soviet proposition
that ending the cold war means
closing- off free speech.
We do not accept the proposi
tion that every time the Soviets
want to soft-pedal a past and con
tinuing crime and immobilize the
United Nations, all it has to do is
raise its hand in mock pain and
say: "Oh, no, you mustn't discuss
that matter, that would violate
the 'spirit of Camp David.' "
We do not accept the proposi
tion that, just because we wel
come Mr. K's taking the pledge
against future interference in the
internal affairs of other nations,
we thereby accept as fixed and
unchangeable the consequences
of Moscow's past interferences in
the internal affairs of other na
tions.
Mr. Khrushchev knows what
he's up to and we better be on
to it. What Mr. Khrushchev
wants is some tangible gesture
by which the U.S. appears to
accept as permanent the Soviet
domination of the satellite
states and, if he can't get that,
he aims to coax from us some
intangible gesture which he can
make over to look tangible and
use against ns so that whenever
we raise a voice in behalf of
freedom in the satellite world
he can accuse us of violating the
rules of "peaceful co-existence."
That isn't what peaceful co
existence means to us.
My own feeling is that Ambas
sador Henry Cabol Lodge bril
liantly and decisively nipped this
Soviet tactic in the bud at the
United Nations last week.
The whole incident was a very
goo:l case study of how the
Soviets aim lo turn "peaceful
co-ex isfenee" Into a massive
sleeping pill for the whole non-
Comniunist world.
Here is the way it went:
A year ago the U.N. directed
Sir Leslie Munroe, former Presi
dent of the General Assembly
and former head of the New Zea
land delegation, to gather infor
mation of what was transpiring
in Hungary in view of the fact
that the Communist regime in
Hungary had ignored all U.N. res
olutions and in view of the fact i
ha' executions, terror, and re-1

pression were known to be con
tinuing.
(Moscow and Budapest soberly
assured Sir Leslie that nothing
like this was taking place and so
confident were they of the truth
of their statements that they
wouldn't let him go and find out
for himself.)
Sir Leslie prepared his report
from a variety of displomatie
sources inside and o u t s id e
Hungary and from refugee and
intelligence sources. The prom
ised wit h d r a w a 1 of Soviet
troops has not taken place. Ex
ecutions continue and others are
in prospect, including teen-age
youths who have been im
prisoned for three years so that
when they are executed they
will be of age. (That will be
nice of them.)
Sir Leslie asked the General
Assembly to schedule a debate on
"the Hungarian question" in the
hope that it may stay the hand
of the executioner.
And what was the position of
the chief Soviet delegate to the
U.N., Vasily V. Kuznetsov? Well,
Mr. Kuznetsov showed how the
Soviets want to use "peaceful co
existence" as a means of quash
ing even peaceful discussion of
unpalatable Soviet actions.
He blandly argued that any
discussion of Hungary "would
be against the spirit of Camp
David," that it would "turn the
clock back" and "undo" the
good things Mr. Khrushchev
was doing to end the cold war.
Ambassador Lodge was not
taken in by this purposeful effort
to turn "the spirit of Camp David"
into American acceptance of So
viet agression in Hungary.
"Nothing happened at Camp
David" (the scene of the Eisen
hower-Khrushchev talks) he said,
"which requires us to condone
evil.
"Nothing happened at Camp
David which requires 11s lo pass
by in silence on the other side
of the street when a brutality
has been committed.
"Nothing happened at Camp
David to prevent us from acting
like human beings."
If the United Nations ever
swallowed the pill which the So
viet delegate was prescribing, it
would put the whole free world to
sleep like Rip Van Winkle.
