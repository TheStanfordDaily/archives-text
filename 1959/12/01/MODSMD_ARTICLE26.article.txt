# The 						Trouble with Tuesday
## 
### Barbara Hicks 
. . . Only 21 more shopping
days 'til Christmas.
That's not really such a trouble
—it's the first 14 of those days,
and their accompanying Sunday,
which will be so bad.
But in a way, the lack of Christ
mas cheer at Stanford, due to
dead week and finals, is a blessing.
We can wait until Christmas to
get into the "Christmas spirit"
and somewhat counteract the out
side world's commercial Christ
mas which starts early in Novem
ber.
Why, it won'l be long before
kids won't know if that guy in
the Santa Clans outfit is to tell
Christmas wants to or if lie's
just another one of flic gang
out trick-or-trealing for Hallo
ween.
In Fresno Friday there were
thousands of kids p a r a d in g
through the streets in the annual
Kids Christmas Parade. We think
we've got kids trouble!
Then there were the proud
parents lining the streets (the
Stanford alums, maybe). Some of
the kids had some pretty intri
cate entries and there were many
comments of how ingenious the
kirls were. I wonder how many
nights mom and dad lay awake
trying to plan their darlings'
entries.
1 don't know why I always
stand in the wrong places for
a parade. The bands NEVER
play where I can hear them.
Have you heard of the latest in
Christmas decorations? This year
we hark back to Grandma's day.
Take freshly contaminated cran
berries and string them into
chains for the Christmas tree, in
stead of eating them. Of course,
there's a commercial purpose to
this, too. You can help out the
poor cranberry farmers who are
stuck with their berries.
If the public ever becomes
alarmed enough about cigarette
smoking, perhaps the cigarette
industry can promote cigarettes
as decorations. They, too, could
be made into chains, or used as

artificial candles, unlit, of
course.
And if the Christmas tree farms
are ever contaminated, aluminum
Christmas trees are on the
market.
Thanksgiving evening Tennesse
Ernie decided to do something
different with his TV show.
Whereas other shows had been
wishing viewers a Happy Thanks
giving, Ernie wanted to be the
first to wish a Merry Christmas.
He wished so hard, I wonder what
he will do this week. Of course,
he could start in on Valentine's
Day greetings.
Although we joke and scoff
at some of the things which go
oil around us during the Christ
mas season, it's never too early
to meditate 011 the thoughtful
side of Christinas, whether you
are Christian or not.
As a more than welcome relief
from "Rudolph, the Red-Nosed
Reindeer," is the annual Christ
mas Carol Concert in Memorial
Church December 11. The beauti
ful carols, some familiar and some
not so familiar, are wonderful
to hear.
And as a parting thought for
Christmas, the story a "Moose in
the Hoose" selected by Clifton
Fadiman for one of the Sunday
magazines, may be entertaining
reading, but let's not place it
ahead of the tale told by a man
named Luke in the second chap
ter of his writing.

Day greetings.
Although we joke and scoff
at some of the things which go
oil around us during the Christ
mas season, it's never too early
to meditate 011 the thoughtful
side of Christinas, whether you
are Christian or not.
As a more than welcome relief
from "Rudolph, the Red-Nosed
Reindeer," is the annual Christ
mas Carol Concert in Memorial
Church December 11. The beauti
ful carols, some familiar and some
not so familiar, are wonderful
to hear.
And as a parting thought for
Christmas, the story a "Moose in
the Hoose" selected by Clifton
Fadiman for one of the Sunday
magazines, may be entertaining
reading, but let's not place it
ahead of the tale told by a man
named Luke in the second chap
ter of his writing.
. . . Only 21 more shopping
days 'til Christmas.
That's not really such a trouble
—it's the first 14 of those days,
and their accompanying Sunday,
which will be so bad.
But in a way, the lack of Christ
mas cheer at Stanford, due to
dead week and finals, is a blessing.
We can wait until Christmas to
get into the "Christmas spirit"
and somewhat counteract the out
side world's commercial Christ
mas which starts early in Novem
ber.
Why, it won'l be long before
kids won't know if that guy in
the Santa Clans outfit is to tell
Christmas wants to or if lie's
just another one of flic gang
out trick-or-trealing for Hallo
ween.
In Fresno Friday there were
thousands of kids p a r a d in g
through the streets in the annual
Kids Christmas Parade. We think
we've got kids trouble!
Then there were the proud
parents lining the streets (the
Stanford alums, maybe). Some of
the kids had some pretty intri
cate entries and there were many
comments of how ingenious the
kirls were. I wonder how many
nights mom and dad lay awake
trying to plan their darlings'
entries.
1 don't know why I always
stand in the wrong places for
a parade. The bands NEVER
play where I can hear them.
Have you heard of the latest in
Christmas decorations? This year
we hark back to Grandma's day.
Take freshly contaminated cran
berries and string them into
chains for the Christmas tree, in
stead of eating them. Of course,
there's a commercial purpose to
this, too. You can help out the
poor cranberry farmers who are
stuck with their berries.
If the public ever becomes
alarmed enough about cigarette
smoking, perhaps the cigarette
industry can promote cigarettes
as decorations. They, too, could
be made into chains, or used as

artificial candles, unlit, of
course.
And if the Christmas tree farms
are ever contaminated, aluminum
Christmas trees are on the
market.
Thanksgiving evening Tennesse
Ernie decided to do something
different with his TV show.
Whereas other shows had been
wishing viewers a Happy Thanks
giving, Ernie wanted to be the
first to wish a Merry Christmas.
He wished so hard, I wonder what
he will do this week. Of course,
he could start in on Valentine's
Day greetings.
