# Churchill Enjoys His 85th Birthday
## 
### 
LONDON (JP) - Sir Winston
Churchill refused to act his age
yesterday and celebrated his 85th
birthday with the vigor of a man
many years his junior.
The great man's day began as
it does nearly always â€” with a
long lime in bed reading the
newspapers and messages. The
messages made a weighty pile,
including congratulations from
all over the World, President
Eisenhower's among them.
He downed a hearty lunch and
topped it off with brandy.
