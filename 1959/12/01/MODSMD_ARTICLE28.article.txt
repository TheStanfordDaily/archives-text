## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (/P)
Tunisia urged France yesterday
to take up political matters as
well as a cease-fire in peace talks
with the Algerian rebels.
Mongi Slim, delegate from Tu
nisia regarded as the chief spokes
man here for the Algerians, said
all the rebels want is a chance
to discuss election guarantees and
safeguards that would permit Al
gerians to make a truly free
choice in determining their fu
ture.
Slim made the statement in a
mildly worded speech to the U.N.
Political Commiitce that praised
French President Charles de
Gaulle for opening the way to
reconciliation and peace in Al
geria.
But Slim also called on France

to end "dillydallying" over accept
ance of five imprisoned rebel
leaders as negotiators.
lie was the only speaker as the
| U.N. opened debate on how to end
the five-year-old rebellion in Al
geria. The French boycotted the
debate on the grounds that Al
geria is an internal issue whose
debate here for the fourth succes
sive year violates the U.N. Char
ter. Additional speakers will be
I heard today.
Slim said his delegation and
others mostly from the Asian-
African bloc would introduce a
resolution they hoped would con
tribute to a peaceful settlement.
Last year a resolution favoring
Algerian independence failed by
lone vote to win the required two
thirds majority.
