Aii All-Americau End
Well there was one good glimmer of light as an aftermath of a
rather dismal and confusing Stanford football season confusing in
that the Cards had their worst defensive showing of all-time Stanford
grid history but the top passer, receiver, leading total offensive
player and leading scorer in the Nation were in the Card ranks this
year. That glimmer of course Chris llurford selected to the first
string coaches All-American team. All of us here certainly believed
that Chris would be selected and certainly deserved the honor. Bur
ford joins a fine contigent of Indian modern-day ends which includes

such greats as Bill McColl, Carl
Isaacs and Sam Morley.
However, one thing wo noticed
was that his passing team mate
and leader in the nation in pass
ing and total offense Dick Nor
man—was selected as honorable
mention All-Coast at quarterback
behind the Host' Bowl bound
\Y asliin g to 11 Huskies' Hub
Scliloredt and Oregon's I)ave'
Grosz. Both boys are able leaders
and have good teams behind them.
However, this brings out the ter
rible problem in selection sec
tional and All-American teams.
Most of the time a lot of good
athletes are left out of the run
ning because: 11 i 4heir team does
not have a good year (2) don't
get as much pre-season publicity
which helps especially in tHe
heavily-populated East and Mid
west—and (3) these players are
victims of highly competitive sec
tionalism.
Perhaps Norman is a victim of
all three reasons- for it is the

opinion of The Daily that he certainly rates a first-string rating on
the All-Coast team irregardless of who is going to the Rose Bowl.
Certainly Dick, as a junior, did not gel as much advanced billing as
his senior teammate and favorite receiver—Bur ford—although of
course Dick didn't preform as consistently as the rangy end. Two,
Stanford didn't have as good a year as was expected it seemed near
ly every game the Cards were favored and perhaps the sportswriters
deem winning the game especially important in selecting a quarter
hack. Three, his bad games were against opponents on the Coast
and certainly writers who followed UCLA, Washington or WS.U had
no qualms in keeping him off the roster.
Everybody's Slill Mad
Last is that terrible problem of sectionalism found here on the
Coast and is especially evident in all those animosities formed after
the old Pacific Coast Conference split up. Everyone—except possibly
those from the Southland chuckles about the out-right favoritism
and extreme sectionalism from those writers from Smoggy L. A.
But I had the pleasure to meet that same variety—a writer from
Seattle on my trip North over the holidays. Of course he had noth
ing but high praise for Husky Scliloredt and spent most of his time
telling me why no other quarterback—especially Norman—should
be considered for the honor. So we find that in the four areas of
theCoast—L. A. favoring the USC and Uclan ballplayers; the Bay
Area boys touting Stanford and Cal players; Portland writers going
with the Oregon schools and those rabid Seattle fans and writers
who haven't had anything to cheer about since the days of Don Hein
rich and Hugh 3IcEIhenney>—of course favor Washington.
Well, it seems that even a top National performance and a rec
ord breaking performance against Cal weren't enough for our boy
Norman. At least the pros recognize his ability as he was drafted
by the Chicago Bears and has another year to go. We assure every
one that Dick .should get enough pre-season fanfare and should be
a definite All-American candidate next vear.
