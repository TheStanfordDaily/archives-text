# USF AT PAVILION
## Card Five Opens Schedule Tonight Daily Sports 
### Roy Schmidt 
Coach Howie Dallmar will un
j veil his '59 varsity basketball
! team tonight when the Indians
take on University of San Fran
cisco at the Pavilion. Game time
is 8 p.m.
The Indians are taller, faster,
and have more depth than last
year's squad, according to Dall
mar. He will open with John
Hendry and Jerry Thueson at for
i wards, John Arrillaga and Bub
Bowling at guards, and John
Windsor at center.
Hendry, a 6-3 junior was a
J starter last season, averaging 4.6
| points per game. Theusen, who
! stands 6-7, gets his first chance
I in a starting role as a senior.
Third in Scoring
Arrillaga, also a senior, was
j third in scoring last year when
j he was a starting forward. This
| year the 6-3 dead-eye gets the call
j at guard. Joining him in the back
| court will be Bub Bowling. This
."5-11 junior is considered by Dall
; mar to be the most improved
i player on the squad.
USF's basketball hopes were
; shaken recently when Coach Phil
I Woolpert announced that he
would take a leave of absence
| this year. His varsity coaching
: chores were left to long-time assit
| ant Ross Giudice. Woolpert indi
! cated that a painful back injury,
i which he received during the sum
j mer, and nervous tension prompt
ed him to leave.
Giudice inherited the club just
three days before the first game,
i To make matters worse his top
' scoring threat, Fred LaCour, 6-5
forward, was suspended early in
the season by Woolpert for aca
! demic reasons.
Two Fine Guards
Giudice has two line guards in
Ron Cox and Charlie Range. Cox.
a 5-11 junior, was a starter on
I last year's club. Range is getting
his first chance as a starter,
j With LaCour out of the picture
the forward spots have been
shared by George Jercich, 6-5
senior; Bob Ralls, 6-5 sophomore;
and Bill Gallagher, 6-5 sophomore.
Bob Amauric, 6-8 soph, and
Fred Breuner, 6-9 junior college
transfer, are slated to handle the
center chores.
USF, holder of the longest
J NCAA winning streak, 60 games,
S will lack its rebounding strength
i of past years. Giudice, schooled
! in Woolpert's style of play should

produce a strong defensive club.
USF will be trying to rebound
from its worst season in years
when they lost 20 of its 26 games.
The Dons won the NCAA cham
pionship in 1955 and 1956 under
YVoolpert.
