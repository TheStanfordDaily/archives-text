BUDAPEST, Hungary {IP) â€”
Soviet Premier Nikita Khru
shchev boasted again Tuesday of
enough nuclear rockets to raze
all his foes, and declared world
disarmament must be solved
along with tlie Berlin question.
The Soviet leader spoke at the
seventh congress of the Hungar
ian Communist party, Ihe first
since the 1956 revolution that
overthrew Communist rule only
to be crushed by Soviet tanks.
'Haze Enemies'
Declaring agreement on an
East-West summit meeting has
practically been reached, Khru
shchev said he agrees with West
German Chancellor Konrad Ade
nauer that disarmament is the
first order of business at such a
meeting.
The Soviet Union, he said,
wants universal disarmament
with "the most comprehensive
and profound control" and is will
ing to destroy a whole stockpile
of rockets with nuclear warheads
which he declared could "raze to
the ground all our potential ene
mies."
'No Ultimatums'
"But in order to have confi
dence on both sides, we must
settle the issue of West Berlin,"
he went on.
Repeating his proposal for a
free city in West Berlin, Khru
shchev said "we set no deadlines,
present no ultimatums" but if all
other means of settlement fail
the Soviet Union will sign a sep
arate peace treaty with East Ger
many.
