# SIGNED BY 12 NATIONS
## Antarctic Pact for Peace Meets Optimistic Reaction 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) —The Antarctic Pact—a pledge to keep the
great frozen continent at peace—was signed yesterday and greeted
as a sign of thaw in international relations.
Twelve nations, including the United States and the Soviet Union,
signed the trealy that bans war bases, nuclear explosions and missile

sites forever from a vast south
polar region covering five million
square miles.
It dedicates Antarctica, where
the Soviet Union and the United
States have been the most active
explorers, to peaceful uses.
'Inspiring Example'
President Eisenhower called the
2,500-word document "an inspir
ing example of what can be ac
complished by international co
operation in the field of science
and in the pursuit of peace."
For the Soviet, Deputy Foreign
Minister Vasili V. Kuznetsov said
it reflected "a definite improve
ment in international situations."
Australia's Ambassador How
ard Beale saw the treaty as a
possible model for other interna
tional agreements—not only re
lating to earth but "perhaps to
the outer maixhes of space itself."
International Inspection
One of the pact's most signifi
cant aspects, U.S. officials said,
is its provision for a revolutionary
system of international inspection
in Antarctica. It gives each of
the 12 nations the right, on mere
advance notice, to check the
other's installations, equipment,
ships and planes in the Antaractic
at any time.
The pact, negotiated in seven
weeks, requires U.S. Senate ap
proval and similar ratification
from governments or legislatures
of the other 11 nations before it
becomes official.
Any one of the 82 members of
the United Nations can join later.
But non-U.N. members must get
the unanimous vote of the 12
original signers.
