Stanford Bad, Too
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily generously con
demned the conduct of the Cal
rooting section at the Big Game
in an editorial on Nov. 23rd and
in a column on Nov. 25.
The Daily's eagle-eyed staff
was apparently so engrossed in
recording the activities across the
way that they somehow failed to
notice what was going on under
their own noses. I had the mis
fortune to sit in the last row of
Stanford's usually apathetic root
ing sec f ion and wish to report
the following:
Stanford's rooting section also
held forth with "a steady barrage
of flip cards, water bags, lunch
sacks, frozen orange cartons, and
other assorted garbage." The
Stanford students that overflowed
into the reserved seats did every
thing but start a fist fight when
the ticket holders showed up
(good old alums).
I low about the courteous shell
ing of ripe tomatoes and water
bags the Cal homecoming court
received? And what about the
mass of filth and obscenity that
greeted the poor newspaper pho
tographer who requested a picture
of "well behaved rooters?"
Perhaps the Cal section is in
deed "one of the most obnoxious
rooting sections in collegiate foot
ball," but Stanford is running a
close second, largely because of
a lack of numbers.

Editor, The Daily:
As a student of the same group
as Miss Kantor, I think her Se
quoia article is a very fair eval
uation of the bad points of the
Stanford in Germany program.
The early gatherings of the Bou
telsbachers and students were
friendly.
But, as stated by Miss Kantor,
by the second quarter relations
had changed. After the Spring
Sing the Americans were more
than eager for the Germans to
leave; they left them downstairs
in the Ratskeller to drink wine by
themselves, while a private stu
dent party was started upstairs in
the study room.
There were other instances of
this same attitude. In my opinion,
this break was caused by several
reasons. First, the Burg students
developed into a tightly knit
group interested in themselves.
Secondly, there is a very different
social, economic, and intellectual
background, beyond culture dif
ferences, between the typical
small village Beutelsbacher and
the Burg student.
I think that real friendships
between Germans and Americans
develop as they develop between
Americans in this country; be
tween people with the same inter
ests. Hence the isolation of Ihe
Burg from German student life
is an important defect of the
Stanford in Germany program.
Few of the Group II students
will deny that the Stanford in
Germany program is a valuable
thing; I think that most agree
that is has faults which should be
corected.

Burg from German student life
is an important defect of the
Stanford in Germany program.
Few of the Group II students
will deny that the Stanford in
Germany program is a valuable
thing; I think that most agree
that is has faults which should be
corected.

Stanford Bad, Too
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily generously con
demned the conduct of the Cal
rooting section at the Big Game
in an editorial on Nov. 23rd and
in a column on Nov. 25.
The Daily's eagle-eyed staff
was apparently so engrossed in
recording the activities across the
way that they somehow failed to
notice what was going on under
their own noses. I had the mis
fortune to sit in the last row of
Stanford's usually apathetic root
ing sec f ion and wish to report
the following:
Stanford's rooting section also
held forth with "a steady barrage
of flip cards, water bags, lunch
sacks, frozen orange cartons, and
other assorted garbage." The
Stanford students that overflowed
into the reserved seats did every
thing but start a fist fight when
the ticket holders showed up
(good old alums).
I low about the courteous shell
ing of ripe tomatoes and water
bags the Cal homecoming court
received? And what about the
mass of filth and obscenity that
greeted the poor newspaper pho
tographer who requested a picture
of "well behaved rooters?"
Perhaps the Cal section is in
deed "one of the most obnoxious
rooting sections in collegiate foot
ball," but Stanford is running a
close second, largely because of
a lack of numbers.

As a student of the same group
as Miss Kantor, I think her Se
quoia article is a very fair eval
uation of the bad points of the
Stanford in Germany program.
The early gatherings of the Bou
telsbachers and students were
friendly.
But, as stated by Miss Kantor,
by the second quarter relations
had changed. After the Spring
Sing the Americans were more
than eager for the Germans to
leave; they left them downstairs
in the Ratskeller to drink wine by
themselves, while a private stu
dent party was started upstairs in
the study room.
There were other instances of
this same attitude. In my opinion,
this break was caused by several
reasons. First, the Burg students
developed into a tightly knit
group interested in themselves.
Secondly, there is a very different
social, economic, and intellectual
background, beyond culture dif
ferences, between the typical
small village Beutelsbacher and
the Burg student.
I think that real friendships
between Germans and Americans
develop as they develop between
Americans in this country; be
tween people with the same inter
ests. Hence the isolation of Ihe
Burg from German student life
is an important defect of the
Stanford in Germany program.
