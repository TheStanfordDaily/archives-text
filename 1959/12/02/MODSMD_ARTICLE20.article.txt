Opsahl Accounts
Editor, The Daily:
Re the Editor's reply to M. R.
Montgomery, Jr.'s letter to the
Editor of Nov. 30, 1959:
We fail to see that The Daily
has justified its accusation of
Stephen Crary as the murderer
of John Opsahl. It' the accusation
was in fact made in the police re
ports though Peninsula and San
Francisco papers were careful to
report only that Crary was the
chief suspect—then The Daily
should have attributed the state
ment beginning "Crary apparently
..directly to the Chief of Police.
The Daily's second justification
—that a contradictory story ap
pearing in a subsequent issue was
greater emphasis is irrelevant;
the implication was made, and
The Daily must either justify it
or make an apology to Mr. Crary.
Furthermore, The Daily is, at
very least, obligated to apologize
for 1 the misunderstanding ensuing
from its presentation of the case.
