### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — Sen.
Clair Engle, D-Calif., -said yester
day United States should examine
possibilities of developing a more
flexible policy in Asia.
He said he was surprised to
note on his return to the United
States that a statement he re
leased in Hong Kong concerning
American relations with Commu
nist China "has been interpreted
to mean that I am in favor of
recognition of that government."
"I do not advocate recognition
of Red China," "Engle •said. "The
Communist government there has
yet to prove itself ready to live
up to its international obligations
in a way that would merit recog
nition."
