Rabbit or Hare?
Editor, Daily:
My apology for inserting Crary
for Opsahl in a letter given you a
week ago. In regards to your de
fense of the Opsahl story that the
". . . suppositions . . . were all
given by police accounts . .
I suggest that your responsibil
ity as a newspaper goes farther
han minmicking police reports.
No other area daily, if you will
do some re-reading, did as poor a
piece of reporting.
Your editorial inefficiency has
continued. One story notes that
Crary is cleared of suspicion, as
far as his car is concerned. It he
suspected in some other way?
Also, your publication is the
only one in the area to insist (or
say carelessly) that Clary's car
had struck a rabbit. In fact, it was
a hare. A small point, until you
remember that rabbits grow in
pens; hares are wild, and may be
struck by a car accidentally.
Your reply to my letter, by the
way, was much clearer than any
story you printed on I he subject
good work!
M. I{. Montgomery, Jr.
Editor's Note: Another point
involving < rary in the Opsahl
case of concern to some official
parties is the time lag between
his finding of Opsahl and his
calling of police. Webster's New
Collegiate Dictionary, under
hare," says"The American
forms are generally called rab
bits." And under "rabbit," says
"loosely, in America, any bare."

I ride a bicycle around campus,
i Practically every time 1 cross in
ner quad my path is obstructed
! at some point by countless pedes
| trians, slowing progress and mak-
I ing passage most difficult.
It is time our police, so busy
handing out parking tickets, did
| something about this dangerous
and annoying situation. The solu
tion is easy: pedestrians should

Rabbit or Hare?
Editor, Daily:
My apology for inserting Crary
for Opsahl in a letter given you a
week ago. In regards to your de
fense of the Opsahl story that the
". . . suppositions . . . were all
given by police accounts . .
I suggest that your responsibil
ity as a newspaper goes farther
han minmicking police reports.
No other area daily, if you will
do some re-reading, did as poor a
piece of reporting.
Your editorial inefficiency has
continued. One story notes that
Crary is cleared of suspicion, as
far as his car is concerned. It he
suspected in some other way?
Also, your publication is the
only one in the area to insist (or
say carelessly) that Clary's car
had struck a rabbit. In fact, it was
a hare. A small point, until you
remember that rabbits grow in
pens; hares are wild, and may be
struck by a car accidentally.
Your reply to my letter, by the
way, was much clearer than any
story you printed on I he subject
good work!

Editor's Note: Another point
involving < rary in the Opsahl
case of concern to some official
parties is the time lag between
his finding of Opsahl and his
calling of police. Webster's New
Collegiate Dictionary, under
hare," says"The American
forms are generally called rab
bits." And under "rabbit," says
"loosely, in America, any bare."
