# Equipment Unlocks Sun's Mysteries

### George Greenstein 
If one happens to glance at any
thing but the road on the way to
Rossotti's, one can look up and
see a large radar antenna staring
off into space. A little further
on is a weird assortment of what
might be television antennas on
a hill. In back of a farm there is
a series of 32 little radar dishes
arranged in a cross and pointing
at the sun.
These antennas and others like
them in the hills behind the cam
pus are operated by the Radio
Pr op a gat ion Laboratories, a
branch of Electronics Research
Laboratory. They are listening to
thunderstorms in South Ameri
ca, watching auroras over Alaska,
bouncing signals off the moon and
keeping close watch on the sun.
Changing Patterns
In various ways they are in
vestigating the constantly chang
ing patterns of electrical activity
that surround the earth—patterns
that scientists are just now be
ginning to realize are wholly de
pendent on the sun for their be
havior and very existence.
It has long been known that
the earth's magnetic field varies
very -slightly in direction and in
tensity in a manner directly re
lated to sunspots and flares on
the surface of the sun. Theories
have been advanced describing
auroras in terms of gigantic
clouds of ionized particles ex
ploding off the sun and hitting
the earth.
It is well known that there is
in the upper atmosphere an elec
trified layer of air called the
ionosphere, through which pon
derous "electrical winds" blow
twice daily.
Only Recently
Yet it has been only recently
that scientists have come to real
ize that all these phenomena and
many more are the results of one
fact: that we are literally im
bedded in the sun, that the sun's
atmosphere extends far beyond
earth's orbit and that this atmo
sphere itself is ionized and deli
cately responsive to solar activity.
Stanford's Radio Propagation
(Laboratories are currently en
gaged in a program the ultimate
aim of which is an understanding
of the complicated interrelation
ships between the sun, its atmo
sphere and the earth.
Myriad Activities
One section of the Laboratory's
program is concerned with the
myriad activities taking place in
our atmosphere. There are an
tennas busy charting the struc
ture of the ionosphere by bounc
ing signals off it and examining
what comes back, much as we in
vestigate an object by illumi
nating it with light and seeing
what comes back.
Another group operates a radio
link between hero and Alaska
which involves bouncing signals
off the moon and through the
auroras. From the received beams
they are learning things about the
mechanism that keeps these airy
curtains glowing and about the
structure of the "solar atmo
sphere."
There is a small area in South
America from which a parti
cular line of magnetic force
arches up into space and de

scends onto the Stanford cam
pus.
When there is a lightning stroke
in this South American area, it
•sends off a burst of radio noise
of all frequencies. This bur s t
flashes off along the magnetic
line, up through the ionosphere,
the Van Allen belts of radiation,
into the regions beyond and down
to Stanford.
Since the ultimate source that
keeps these phenomena going is
radiation from the sun. a large
part of the Laboratory's program
is concerned with the sun itself.
Activity Tabbed
Daily tabs are kept on its ac
tivity, and a gradual picture of
the sun is emerging in which we
find its surface to be a storming
mass of ionized atoms — vast
splotches of intense heat and
light covering billions of square
miles in which excessively strong
magnetic fields grow and fade
along with the sporadic forma
tion of sunspots, violent bursts of
radiation immensely stronger
than anything we can duplicate
in the lab which flare up and
vanish, and unbelievable flames
many times bigger than the
earth itself that fly out into
•space.
Professor Ronald N. Bracewell
is the man in charge of the radio
telescope. Students who are ob
serving and collecting data are:
Roger Colvin, G. Swarum, David
Cudaback. K. S. Yang, Jim Jack
son, and Ann Williams.
