## Negro Vote Plays Part In Politics 
### Bob Frank 
"At mid-century, the American
Negro is looking for economic
opportunity and social freedom, |
like every other American" As- 1
sistant Attorney General Frank
lin Williams told a Political Union :
audience yesterday.
The Negro now plays an im
portant part in politics both as a|
voter and as a party to the civil j
lights issue. Williams traced
Negro party loyalties from sup
port of the "liberating" Republi-!
cans in 18(35 through the switch!
to Democratic loyalties in the '20s j
and the improved Republican po-|
sition in Eisenhower's 1956 re
election.

Despite the "seeming legal mil-1
acles" of recent years in the j
courts, said Williams, more legis- ,
lation is needed. "We need a sta- i
tute compelling the government i
If) act when a citizen is deprived j
of a constitutional right."
The NAACP has a yearly bud-!
get of less than one million dol- i
lars and a p;iid staff of less than I
thirty, said Williams. Because it
is small it must concentrate on
legislation and adjudication as
means of solving the race problem
instead of trying first to change
people's attitudes. He said the
NAACP has tried to get better)
portrayals of Negroes in TV and j
movies, for instance picketing !
showings of "Birth of a Nation." i
Mack Parker Murder
Asked about the lynch-murder
of Mack Parker and subsequent !
trial of accused members of the l
mob. Williams said there should
be an anti-lynching law, and a
law requiring change of trial loca
tion in such cases.
