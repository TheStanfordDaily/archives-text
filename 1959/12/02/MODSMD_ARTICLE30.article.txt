## Passing Stats Dominate As Card Grid Year Ends 
### 
Stanford s Indians have stowed away their grid logs for another
season, but not before capping a somewhat disappointing campaign
by setting a bevy of new individual and team records.
The Indians' passing attack dominated the season statistics as
Dick Norman and Chris Burford combined to make the air game the

most potent in the n:ition.
All-America end Burford closed
out his varsity grid career by
establishing a new Stanford mark j
i for future pigskin snatchers of
j 61 receptions good for 757 yards.
Over a three year varsity ca-,
j reer. Bui ford has snagged 107
| passes for 12(52 yards and 9 touch
downs, thus ranking himself
among the best of Stanford's all
time grid greats.
Dick Norman, the "arm" of the j
! Indians aerial circus, has sol him
j self quite a target to shoot at for
! next season's campaign as he
| erased several national passing
1 marks as well as obliterating
1 many Indian bests.
During t lie past season, Nor
j man completed 152 passes out of
1263 attempts and .576 average
J good for 1943 yards and 14 TD's
I to sel a new Card record for pass
j completions.
The flashy quarterback set na
i tional single l game marks by com
! pleting 34 of 39 pass attempts for
! a .782 average, by passing for 401
I yards, and by completing 34
I passes, all against the Cal Bears
in the Big Game.
To top a near perfect season for
! Norman, he set a new Indian total
offense mark of 2018 yards,
which, added to last year's total
I of 638 yards, gives Norman a
I two year total of 2656 yards.
Skip Face, the Indians' most j

versatile gridder, lived up to his
title by capturing a flock of in
dividual- litles.
Highlighting Face's many ac
complishments was his scoring
mark. The hard working Indian
captured ihe national scoring
crown by scoring 100 points on 11
TD's. 3 field goals, 19 kicked extra
points, and 3 two point runs.
The Indian rushing laurels
also found themselves in Face's
hands as he ground out 373 yards
in 96 tries for 3.9 yards per carry
average.
The Indians closed out their
grid campaign with a not too
satisfactory 3-7 slate, holding
victories over COP, San Jose
State, and Oregon State.
The Cards were outscored by
1 heir opponents by the tune of 261
tallies to 232. In total offense
the edge again went to Ihe "bad
guys." 3608 yards to 3470.
But the Indians held an over
whelming leadership in pass of
fense, 2278 yards to 1280, leaving
the rushing crown to the op
ponents, 2328 yards to 1192.
