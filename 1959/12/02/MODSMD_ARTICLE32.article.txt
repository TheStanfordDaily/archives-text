## 
### Glenn Alford 
The North All-Star soccer team
defeated the South 3-2, despite
the fine efforts of all four of the
Stanford players participating for
the South.
The North is composed of City
College of San Francisco, San
Francisco State, and California.
USF could not compete in I he All-
Star game because its team had
just returned from the national
soccer finals in St. Louis and was
too tired to participate. The
South is composed of Stanford,

Santa Clara, San Jose State, and
the California Aggies.
The North got on the score
hoard within the first six minutes
of the game, as CCSF's all-league
forward Jim Lynch powered a
straight shot into the nets.
North Defenses
That was all the scoring in the
first half, but it looked as if the
North would score frequently,
only to have a last ditch South
move saved a goal. During this
period, Stanford's halfbacks
Henry Vi-erra and Jan Achenbach
played their finest to turn back
numerous Northern drives.
Late in the third quarter. Stan
ford's forward Wolfgang Storeh
made the most spectacular play
of the game, ;i 35 foot shot into
the corner of the net over 0-4
North goalie, Fred Becker, to tie
up the game.
At the beginning of the fourth
quarter, the South coaches made
ihe mistake of the game when
they removed their goalie, Jack
Legueu of the Aggies, in favor of
.Joe Foss of San Jose State. The
mistake wasn't apparent im
mediately as the Indian's Bernie
Knaggs put the South in front
with a squib kick as he emerged
from a tangle in front of the goal.
The North scored precisely 12
seconds after the South's goal.
Lynch did it again as he drove
pasl the dumbfounded goalie to
knot the game.
Cohen Wins It
Jose Cohen, of California and
the North, won the game with
nine minutes left, on a smash.
The South look out Foss, but by
then the damage was done.
All coaches were in accord that
the game was remarkably well
played considering lhat neilher
team had practiced with each
other.

first half, but it looked as if the
North would score frequently,
