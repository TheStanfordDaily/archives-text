## New Faces Everywhere 
### Bob Payne 
Don't ho too concerned if you don't recognize many of the names
on Pacific Coast basketball rosters this season. The way tilings are
shaping up now it will be the new names, not the old, that are going
to he making the headlines before long.
A look at the current crop of sophomores in West Coast school
leads one to believe that 1958 must have been a banner year for
high school basketball in these parts. From one end of the Coast to
the other, cage coaches are confidently pinning their hopes on a
gj'oup of sophs that may rank with the best-ever.
The situation is reportedly pretty rosy elsewhere around the
country, too. In fact, the Bay Area donated one of the nation's banner
sophs Jim lladnot, the 6-10 phenom from McClymonds of Oakland
who ended up at Providence College in Hhode Island.
Then there is Bill (die Hill) McGill, the former Los Angeles star

who now attends Utah. Strange
ca:-3 about Bill. He was nearly
seven feet U'll in high school (or
so they said), was (MO as a Utah
frosh last year; now all the mag.;;
list him as 69. Before long The
111:1 will be a speedy little guard
in tho backcourt.
However. . . .
The Coast seems not the least
bit daun'ed by those two that-got
away. There were plenty of big
boys left over.
Defending NCAA c h a m pi on
California is apparently the only
team of the old Pacific Coast
Conference schools not counting
on a banner yearling group. Bui
the Bears have (3-10 Darrall Imhoff
and that's good enough for a
start anywhere.
There is one newcomer in
Pelt 1 Newell's picture at Berkeley.
He's little Bobby Wendell, the 5-9
ball-handling whiz who used to
cavort for Menlo College.
Cal, despite all this noise you
hear about Southern Cal, is still

the team to beat says Stanford mentor Howie Dallniar. The Bears
lost, their guns, but they still have Imlioff, that tight defense and lots
of those big blond guys.
USC seems to be gelling where it is in the preseason mention by
virtue of its sophomore crop. There are two beauties down Figueroa
way: 6-7 Jolui Rudomatkin and guard Chris Appel.
That may be a small "crop," but both of those lads have reportedly
cracked the Trojan starting five; and this is the team that lost one
man out of its first 15 last season (Phil Dye, a third stringer>.
Kudoniatkin is a big. mobile individual generally rated as the best
junior college player in California last season. Appel, 5-11, put the
round thing through the hoop to an average of 21.3 points a game
on last year's Trolmbes.
Among coach Forrest Twogood's returnees, all-conference John
Werhas, >lini While, 6-5 Bob Hampton and good old 6-7 Jim Hanna,
last year's banner washout, are prominent.
