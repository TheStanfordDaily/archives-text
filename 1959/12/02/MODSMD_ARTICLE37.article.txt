# Husky Front Line Replenished
## 
### 
Washington had reason to feel itself fairly well routed by gradu
ation, but new coach John Grayson isn't crying too much in Seattle.
The Huskies lost 6-7 Doug Smart and 6-9 Bruno Boin through
graduation. And then 6-4 Karle Irvine got knocked out by grades. At
least this will serve to clear a path for Washington's towering soph
crew.
Last season, Dallniar called the Husky frosh "front-line" the
finest he's seen. Two of the big boys should be starting this year:
6-9 scoring machine Bill Hanson, and 6-6 Roger Niva. The third man
of that front line may be heard from later, too. He's 6-6. 230-pound
John .>leyers who is a starting football end for the Rose-Bowling
Huskies and won't be around until at the earliest mid-January.
With a few so-so veterans in the always-weak Husky backcourt.
another soph Lyle Bakken could be a key man, too.
Then we go to Oregon. Coach Steve Belko starts his fourth year
at Kugene and the steadily-improving Ducks may really spurt this
season.
Six-eight Glen Moore, one of those co-ordinated-like-a-guard
giants ihat come along every so often, is the chief source of joy for
the Green.
This isn't a one-man show in Eugene, however. Six-four Charley
Warren, a high school scoring machine, and 6-4 Indianan John Alack
are pressing for spots on ihe Duck squad. So last season's 6-5 froni
line trio of Dale Herron, Stu Robertson and Denny Strickland will
be sweating their jobs. Only Webfoot veteran seemingly intact is
guard Chuck Rask. But you never can tell.
