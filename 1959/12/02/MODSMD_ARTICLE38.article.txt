# More Tall Beavers, Too
## 
### 
Oregon State is doing all right by its sophomores, 100. The
Beavers look as tall as ever, if not taller, and 6-6 beanpole soph -fay
( arty is a wonderful shooter that figures prominently in Slats Gill's
plans. Another 6-6 stringbean soph is Tim Campbell.
In the way of veterans, OSC has 6-9 Karl Anderson, 6-5 Steve
Fly mi, 6-1 Jim Woodland, and 6-6 Ernie Johnson. How did Woodland
get in there?
And even Washington State is smelling prosperity. They're en
thusiastic in I'ullman as Marv Harsliman enters his second year as
Cougar coach and already is putting together one of the best WSIJ
squads since tJene Conley days. BIG >lAN there is 6-6 Charlie Sells,
a sophomore, of course. Sells high jumps 6-6 in the spring, I
might add.
Along with him ihey have 6-4 Dwiglit Damon, 6-2 Terry Ball, ."5-10
Doyle Wilson, 6 6 Kill McKenzie and 6-7 Neil Dirom all sophomores
threatening for starting jobs. Top returnee is 6-6 workhorse center
John Maras.
UCLA wasn't completely shutout when it comes to yearlings.
Coach John Wooden thinks he has a dandy in 6-5 Gary Cunningham,
who averaged a cool 20.7 with the Brubabes last season. But of all
things, the Bruins will be counting on 6-9 Warned (Hocking Feet)
Jones in the post.
Then we come to Stanford. Sophomores? Try 6-7 John Windsor,
6 1 John Fontious, 6-4 Jim Bryan and 6-5 Al Simila.
Windsor looks like a starter. Along with Rich Hosley (out this
season), he devastated I'apoose foes last year with grciit scoring and
rebounding. While the other lads are getting the big noise, Windsor
could be right in there as a top soph, too.
