# Ike Will Blast Steel Negotiators
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (JP) â€” Govern
ment officials passed the word
Tuesday that President Eisen
hower is getting ready to blast
both union and management for
not settling their steel industry
dispute.
Eisenhower was said to be
choosing stronger words than he
has used before, in his radio
television speech to the nation
Thursday night.
During a bargaining session,
the Steelworkers Union president,
David J. McDonald, accused the
industry of entering the talks in
bad faith.
The half-million steelworkers,
back to work now under a Taft-
Hartley Act injunction after a
116-day strike, will be free to
walk out again on Jan. 26 when
the injunction expires.
