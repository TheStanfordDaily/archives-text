A 20-point outburst by guard
John Arrillaga sparked the In
dians to a 55-49 overtime victory
over University ol" San Francisco
in their '59 debut last nigh I. It
was the Card hoopslers 16th
straight home victory.
The game was a see-saw battle
all the way, as both halves ended
with the score knotted. USF's
: red Brut;ner sent the game inlo
overtime when ho sank a free
throw will 35 seconds remaining
and the score favoring Stanford
by one point.
The Indians then called time
out to talk over the situation. Try
ing to run out I lie clock and get
the last good shot, Stanford
waited too long and'had to settle
for the overtime.
Windsor Scores
Center John Windsor sent the
Indians into the lead with a seven
foot jump shot early in the five
minute playoof. USF's spark-pluf
guard Ron Cox tied it up again
with a lay up.
Arrillaga then sent his team
into the lead to stay with a 20-
foot jump shot from the corner,
oments later he took advantage
of a screen to pot another long
one-hander. Now leading 51-47
Stanford was out of reach of the
pressing Dons. John Hendry and
Windsor added four more to ihe
Card total before the buzzer
sounded.
Arrillaga's 20-point output was
tops for the night followed by
Cox of USF who had 18. Stanford
.shot at a 38 per cent clip for both
hall's, but had trouble from the
free-throw line where they could
sink just 11 of 22.
The Dons were red-hot in the
first half hitting 53 per cent of
their attempts. They cooled off
in the second half to a 30 pet
cent pace.
Cox Topped Dons

stature lead the Dons in rebounds
with seven. Jerry Thuesen topped
Stanford with nine followed by
Arrillaga with seven.
Hendry scored first for the In
dians but Danny Drinon of USF
tied it at 2-2 with a 10-foot jump
shot from the side of the key.

the game—for the widest margin
between the two clubs in the first
half was just four points.
A short one-hander by Arrillaga
enabled the Indians to tie it up

at halftime. Trailing 25-23 with
