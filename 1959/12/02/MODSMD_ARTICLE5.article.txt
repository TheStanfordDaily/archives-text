### Jo A Nielsen 
"The purpose of the Stanford Research Institute is the advance
ment and practical application of knowledge." SRI Vice President
Weldon G. Gibson said last night at the Tuesday Evening Series
lecture.
Gibson and E. Fin ley Carter, president of SRI. gave a joint talk

i on the framework and philosophy
I of the Institute.
The non-profit organization's
purpose was said to he an exten
sion of the University's wish to
i promote public welfare. To illus
trate this, Gibson explained the
! affiliation of SRI to the Univer
sity. Although SRI operates in
dependently, the Board of Trus
tees exercises some control and
\ annually elects the president.
Four Major Fields
The international program is
one of the major ways to obtain
and, in turn, spread research in
j formation. The SRI has branch
offices throughout the U.S. and a
I European center office in Switz
erland besides working in all
parts of the world on research
projects. In their travels, the SRI
i scientists aid other countries in
i their scientific problems.
This research is done in four
major fields. In Engineering, one
! of the major projects now being
undertaken is the development
1 of a type of film that would have
; 100 million elements per square
j inch.
The Physical and Biological
! Sciences department is doing
; some most important work in
cancer research. The scientists
I working with shock waves and
i explosives are mainly concerned
j with missiles.
Economics research, the only
non-laboratory field, includes Ihe
| study of natural and human re
i sources.
Staff Quality Praised
Carter cited the SRl's greatest
asset as being its staff, which
understands the importance of
interdependency. World problems
I would be solved much more read
! ily if the whole community would
I realize the importance of interde
! pendency today. Carter said.
The quality of the staff was
praised again when Gibson ex
plained the rapid development of
j SRI. Besides this factor, one very
important reason was the time of
its founding, which coincided with
the end of World War If, when
| American research began its rapid
; increase.
Other factors he listed were the
i location, the solid backing from
industry, and the facilities avail
' able from the beginning.
