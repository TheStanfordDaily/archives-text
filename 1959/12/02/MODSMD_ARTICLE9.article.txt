# McElroy Resigns As Defense Chief
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — Neil H. McElroy, the first space age secretary of defense, resigned yester
day and Philadelphia banker Thomas Soveriegn Gates Jr. was promoted to the top Pentagon post.
He will be sworn in today at the White House.
The tall, athletic-looking McElroy is returning to the soap business after 26 months at the helm of
the Defense Department—a period which saw changes in military concepts more drastic than in any

comparable period of U.S. history.
In one of his last official acts,
McElroy announced the adminis
tration will ask Congress next
January for money to keep 852
long-range bombers aloft, on an
increased alert when the military
chiefs determine the Soviet Union
has a substantial lead in intercon
tinental ballistic missiles. At a
farewell news conference, McEl
roy conceded the United States
will trail the Soviets in big mis
siles for the next three years.
American Capability
Despite this, he spoke confi
dently of American capability to
deliver nuclear destruction against
any would-be aggressor.
As of today, he said, the Soviet j
Union and the United States have
about the same number of long-1
range missiles a number he de- |
scribed as quite small on both j
sides.
"It is our belief that we are j
prepared for either nuclear or |
nonatomie limited war," he de- j
clared.
Gales Will Take Over
Gates, an investment banker in j
private life, recently has been ■
serving as deputy secretary after |
a previous stint as Secretary of j
the Navy.
Ho moves into the defense
chief's job a little more than a
month before President Eisen
hower's new military budget goes
to Congress for an expected buf
feting from Democrats who want j
to spend more on missiles and,
other weapons.
No Surprise
McElroy's resignation — which !
is effective immediately — camc |
as no surprise. He indicated I
months ago he would step out
after the military budget for the
fiscal year starting next July 1
had been hammered into shape.
That job was pretty well finished
late last month, and the decision
reached at meetings with Eisen
hower—reportedly was to hold
military spending at about the
41-billion-dollar rate of this year.
Gates, 53, has been McElroy's
deputy since last june.
As civilian chief of the Navy,
he espoused the view that the
United States should devote more
money and effort to preparing for
possible limited warfare and that
less stress should be placed on
weapons of mass nuclear destruc
tion.
