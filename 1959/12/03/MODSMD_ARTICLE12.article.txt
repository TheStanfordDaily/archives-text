# Ike's Trip to Show U.S. 'Good Peace Partner'; Steel Action May Come
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (IP) — President Eisenhower declared yesterday
the major aim of his 22,000-mile visit to 11 countries, beginning
today, will be to prove to foreign peoples that the United States is
a "good partner" in the search for a just peace.
Eisenhower told a news conference that "such prestige and

standing as I have" will be used
during his last year in office to
carry out that theme.
The President is scheduled to
leave Washington after making a
broadcast to the nation about his
19-day journey. That trip will
take him, at its farthest point, to
four days of talks with Prime
Minister Nehru of India, then
bring him back to Paris for a
Western summit meeting Dec.
19-21.
Discussing the trip and other
foreign issues at his meeting with
newsmen, Eisenhower made these
points:
• He has received medical
clearance from his doctors who
found in a physical examination
three days ago that he was "ca
pable of doing it."
• Nehru is right in trying to
setlle the border dispute with Red
China by negotiation and that
China's leaders ane wrong in us
ing force.
• The President will be pre
pared to discuss the border issue
and other specific problems with
Nehru, including hopeful signs of
an improvement in relations be
tween Pakistan and India.
• He will discuss other specific
problems as he visits other cap
itals and everywhere will empha
sise the need to resolve issues by
negotiation rather than force.
• Prime Minister Nobusuke
Kishi of Japan will visit the Unit
ed States, probably in January.
Kishi's visit is expected to bring
completion of negotiations for a
revised U.S.-Japanese mutual de
fense treaty.
• Eisenhower is more hopeful
now than a few months back that
some constructive results will
emerge from U.S.-British nego
tiations with the Soviet Union for
a ban on nuclear weapons testing
backed up by an international in
spection system.
The brighter prospect evident
ly is due to the Soviet Union's
recent agreement to join in a sci
entific study, now under way, of
the problems of preventing sneak
underground explosions.

• Prime Minister Nobusuke
Kishi of Japan will visit the Unit
ed States, probably in January.
Kishi's visit is expected to bring
completion of negotiations for a
revised U.S.-Japanese mutual de
fense treaty.
• Eisenhower is more hopeful
now than a few months back that
some constructive results will
emerge from U.S.-British nego
tiations with the Soviet Union for
a ban on nuclear weapons testing
backed up by an international in
spection system.
The brighter prospect evident

underground explosions.
WASHINGTON (IP) — President Eisenhower declared yesterday
the major aim of his 22,000-mile visit to 11 countries, beginning
today, will be to prove to foreign peoples that the United States is
a "good partner" in the search for a just peace.
Eisenhower told a news conference that "such prestige and

standing as I have" will be used
during his last year in office to
carry out that theme.
The President is scheduled to
leave Washington after making a
broadcast to the nation about his
19-day journey. That trip will
take him, at its farthest point, to
four days of talks with Prime
Minister Nehru of India, then
bring him back to Paris for a
Western summit meeting Dec.
19-21.
Discussing the trip and other
foreign issues at his meeting with
newsmen, Eisenhower made these
points:
• He has received medical
clearance from his doctors who
found in a physical examination
three days ago that he was "ca
pable of doing it."
• Nehru is right in trying to
setlle the border dispute with Red
China by negotiation and that
China's leaders ane wrong in us
ing force.
• The President will be pre
pared to discuss the border issue
and other specific problems with
Nehru, including hopeful signs of
an improvement in relations be
tween Pakistan and India.
• He will discuss other specific
problems as he visits other cap
itals and everywhere will empha
sise the need to resolve issues by
negotiation rather than force.
