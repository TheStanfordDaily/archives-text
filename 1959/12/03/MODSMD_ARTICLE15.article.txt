# Hypnotism Advance
## 
### 
A significant new step in the
development of hypnotism as a
science has been taken by two
Stanford University psychologists.
Professors Andre M. VVeitzen
hoffer and Ernest It. Hilgard have
published a book called the "Stan
ford Hypnotic Susceptibility
Scale."
The scale is intended for use
with patients as well as in further
research on hypnosis, and is de
signed to measure an individual's
susceptibility by a series of tests.
This knowledge, according to
the two psychologists, can be of
great value in using hypnosis for
therapy, and is essential in some
psychoiogical research.
The manual's contents are
based on data obtained in studies
with 124 Stanford undergradu
ates, and the work was done in
the Laboratory for Human TV

velopmenl.
In the test, one-fourth of the
students were found to be highly
susceptible to hypnosis, 31 per
cent scored in the medium range,
and 45 per cent had low scores.
The author-inventors stated
that the manual must still be con
sidered experimental until it has
been tried out more. They also
hope people who use the scale
with groups will report their find
ings, so that the data can be made
available to other users of the
scale.
They said that other persons
such as psychiatrists, obstetri
cians and dentists using hypnosis
iti their practice could find the
scale useful.
They are now planning to write
a second manual or "depth scale"
to measure the degree of hypnotic
trance attained in a subject.
