So far the discussion of whether
an American President or other
elected official who is a Roman
Catholic would have the moral
right or the inclination to go
against the dictates of his church
on public policy is being con
ducted responsibly and fair
mindedly.
This is a notable improve
ment over the kind of public
debate and innuendo which
marked the A 1 Smith campaign
for the Presidency in 1928.
Then, instead of honest and
thoughful discussion, there was a
spate of emotional hostility to
the Democratic nominee, who, like
Sen. John F. Kennedy, was a
Roman Catholic, and there were
also charges that any raising of
the position of the Catholic church
on aspects of public affairs was,
per so, proof of bigotry against
the Catholic religion.
Many of us will recall the
whispering campaign which sug
gested that the very election of
A 1 Smith would mean that the
Pope could shortly be expected to
move his headquarters to the
United States.
That was poppycock for one
reason among many, since the
Pope is both the spiritual head
of the church and temporal
head of Vatican City, llis Holi
ness would hardly abandon the
headquarters where the church
and state are one, as in Vatican
City, and move it to a nation
whose constitution requires
separation of church and state.
On the other hand it was never
fair to raise the cry of bigotry
against those who honestly ques
tioned how strongly an American
Catholic official would consider
himself bound by the authorita
tive stand of his church on public
policy.
The climate of public debate in
this area has obviously improved
greatly since the unfairness and
irrelevancies of the A 1 Smith cam
paign.
The evidence of this im
proved climate, which should be
welcomed, is the calm and
germane discussion which has
followed the recent statement
by the governing hierarchy of
the Catholic church in the
United States opposing the use
of U.S. public funds to promote

artificial birth control anywhere
in the world.
While it is true that no U.S.
funds are now being used for this
purpose, the subject has been
considered particularly with ref
erence to countries whose ex
plosive birth rates are outrunning
anything which they or we are
trying to do to improve their
economic plight.
Following this statement by
the Catholic bishops, the Right
Rev. James A. Pike, Protestant
Episcopal Bishop of San Fran
cisco, replied that Catholic
policy would "condemn rapidly
increasing millions of people in
less fortunate parts of the world
to starvation, bondage, misery,
and despair," and then raised
the question whether the Catho
lic church statement was "bind
ing on Roman Catholic candi
dates for public office.'"
For the answer reporters na
turally wont to Sen. Kennedy
first. The Senator's answer was:
That as a Catholic he is per
sonally opposed to artificial birth
control.
That "it would be a mistake
for the United States to attempt
to advocate the limitation of
the population of under-devel
oped countries."
That, if he were President and
an agency of the Executive branch
advocated or Congress passed a
law recommending that foreign
aid be related to the willingness
of a country to keep its popula
tion within the range of its re
sources, he would base his de
cision on what he deemed to he
the interests of ihe United States.
Gov. Edmund P. Brown of Cali
fornia, running as a "favorite
son" candidate for the Demo
cratic nomination, was less re
sponsive. He declined to go be
yond the view that the U.S. oughl
not to try to impose birth control
on other nations, which is not
the point at issue.
Undoubtedly this subject, in
its broadest aspects, will be
with us for some time. What I
am seeking to say is that the
caliber of discussion which is
taking place is a far cry from
1928. There is, as there should
be, no animus in the discussion.

So far the discussion of whether
an American President or other
elected official who is a Roman
Catholic would have the moral
right or the inclination to go
against the dictates of his church
on public policy is being con
ducted responsibly and fair
mindedly.
This is a notable improve
ment over the kind of public
debate and innuendo which
marked the A 1 Smith campaign
for the Presidency in 1928.
Then, instead of honest and
thoughful discussion, there was a
spate of emotional hostility to
the Democratic nominee, who, like
Sen. John F. Kennedy, was a
Roman Catholic, and there were
also charges that any raising of
the position of the Catholic church
on aspects of public affairs was,
per so, proof of bigotry against
the Catholic religion.
Many of us will recall the
whispering campaign which sug
gested that the very election of
A 1 Smith would mean that the
Pope could shortly be expected to
move his headquarters to the
United States.
That was poppycock for one
reason among many, since the
Pope is both the spiritual head
of the church and temporal
head of Vatican City, llis Holi
ness would hardly abandon the
headquarters where the church
and state are one, as in Vatican
City, and move it to a nation
whose constitution requires
separation of church and state.
On the other hand it was never
fair to raise the cry of bigotry
against those who honestly ques
tioned how strongly an American
Catholic official would consider
himself bound by the authorita
tive stand of his church on public
policy.
The climate of public debate in
this area has obviously improved
greatly since the unfairness and
irrelevancies of the A 1 Smith cam
paign.
The evidence of this im
proved climate, which should be
welcomed, is the calm and
germane discussion which has
followed the recent statement
by the governing hierarchy of
the Catholic church in the
United States opposing the use
of U.S. public funds to promote

artificial birth control anywhere
in the world.
While it is true that no U.S.
funds are now being used for this
purpose, the subject has been
considered particularly with ref
erence to countries whose ex
plosive birth rates are outrunning
anything which they or we are
trying to do to improve their
economic plight.
Following this statement by
the Catholic bishops, the Right
Rev. James A. Pike, Protestant
Episcopal Bishop of San Fran
cisco, replied that Catholic
policy would "condemn rapidly
increasing millions of people in
less fortunate parts of the world
to starvation, bondage, misery,
and despair," and then raised
the question whether the Catho
lic church statement was "bind
ing on Roman Catholic candi
dates for public office.'"
For the answer reporters na
turally wont to Sen. Kennedy
first. The Senator's answer was:
That as a Catholic he is per
sonally opposed to artificial birth
control.
That "it would be a mistake
for the United States to attempt
to advocate the limitation of
the population of under-devel
oped countries."
That, if he were President and
an agency of the Executive branch

funds are now being used for this
purpose, the subject has been
considered particularly with ref
erence to countries whose ex
plosive birth rates are outrunning
anything which they or we are
trying to do to improve their
economic plight.
Following this statement by
the Catholic bishops, the Right
Rev. James A. Pike, Protestant
Episcopal Bishop of San Fran
cisco, replied that Catholic
policy would "condemn rapidly
increasing millions of people in
less fortunate parts of the world
to starvation, bondage, misery,
and despair," and then raised
the question whether the Catho
lic church statement was "bind
ing on Roman Catholic candi
dates for public office.'"
For the answer reporters na
turally wont to Sen. Kennedy
first. The Senator's answer was:
That as a Catholic he is per
sonally opposed to artificial birth
control.
That "it would be a mistake
for the United States to attempt
to advocate the limitation of
the population of under-devel
oped countries."
That, if he were President and
an agency of the Executive branch
advocated or Congress passed a
law recommending that foreign
aid be related to the willingness
of a country to keep its popula
tion within the range of its re
sources, he would base his de
cision on what he deemed to he
the interests of ihe United States.
Gov. Edmund P. Brown of Cali
fornia, running as a "favorite
son" candidate for the Demo
cratic nomination, was less re
sponsive. He declined to go be
yond the view that the U.S. oughl
not to try to impose birth control
on other nations, which is not
the point at issue.
Undoubtedly this subject, in
its broadest aspects, will be
with us for some time. What I
am seeking to say is that the
caliber of discussion which is
taking place is a far cry from
1928. There is, as there should
be, no animus in the discussion.

So far the discussion of whether
an American President or other
elected official who is a Roman
Catholic would have the moral
right or the inclination to go
against the dictates of his church
on public policy is being con
ducted responsibly and fair
mindedly.
This is a notable improve
ment over the kind of public
debate and innuendo which
marked the A 1 Smith campaign
for the Presidency in 1928.
Then, instead of honest and
thoughful discussion, there was a
spate of emotional hostility to
the Democratic nominee, who, like
Sen. John F. Kennedy, was a
Roman Catholic, and there were
also charges that any raising of
the position of the Catholic church
on aspects of public affairs was,
per so, proof of bigotry against
the Catholic religion.
Many of us will recall the
whispering campaign which sug
gested that the very election of
A 1 Smith would mean that the
Pope could shortly be expected to
move his headquarters to the
United States.
That was poppycock for one
reason among many, since the
Pope is both the spiritual head
of the church and temporal
head of Vatican City, llis Holi
ness would hardly abandon the
headquarters where the church
and state are one, as in Vatican
City, and move it to a nation
whose constitution requires
separation of church and state.
On the other hand it was never
fair to raise the cry of bigotry
against those who honestly ques
tioned how strongly an American
Catholic official would consider
himself bound by the authorita
tive stand of his church on public
policy.
The climate of public debate in
this area has obviously improved
greatly since the unfairness and
irrelevancies of the A 1 Smith cam
paign.
The evidence of this im
proved climate, which should be
welcomed, is the calm and
germane discussion which has
followed the recent statement
by the governing hierarchy of
the Catholic church in the
United States opposing the use
of U.S. public funds to promote

artificial birth control anywhere
in the world.
While it is true that no U.S.
funds are now being used for this
purpose, the subject has been
considered particularly with ref
erence to countries whose ex
plosive birth rates are outrunning
anything which they or we are
