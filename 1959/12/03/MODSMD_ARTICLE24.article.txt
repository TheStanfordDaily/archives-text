No Yell Leader
Editor, The Daily:
Plow come?
First basketball game of the
season, home court, good crowd.
Visitors: four yell leaders, one
band.
Stanford: zero yell leaders, no
band.
How come?
Barbara Cochrane, '27
Editor's No!*': We wondered
"how come?" too. The head yell
leader was I here, and even
wore his sweater during the
first half. Hut lie didn't lead
any yells. He may have been
deterred by not having any as
sistants yet. Itnt lie was elected
three weeks ago and it has been
known for some time that
basketball season would open
Dec. I. The band, when ques
tioned in the past about its
December absence from the
pavilion, lias claimed it does not
have time to organize between
the end of football season and
start of basketball and then get
in enough practice to do a repre
sentative job.

Spending or $335
Editor, The Daily:
Have you over wondered what
happens to your precious $335
after you leave the pavilion each
quarter? A good example was ob
served last week in front of Iho
E.E. Building.
It seems that it was necessary
to replace the signs saying "Park
ing for Authorized Vehicles Only"
with other signs saying "Parking
for Authorized Faculty and Staff
Vehicles Only." . . .
This operation was performed
by two workmen, using the serv
ices of a one-ton stake truck.
Somehow, these men devised a
method by which they could make
this a co-operative effort on a
job that could easily be done by
one man and a la-ton pick-up.
Although I recognize the fact
that Companionship and Togeth
erness are Necessities in modern
society, T don't think this justified
gross inefficiency in the spend
ing of my money.
