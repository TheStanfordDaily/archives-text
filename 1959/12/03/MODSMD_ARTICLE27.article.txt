## ONE OPINION 
### 
Let me tell you 'bout a story
of two guys from Stanford on a
tragic and fateful weekend. They
put their checkbook:-; in their
pockets, kissed the studies good
bye, and went to Reno-Tahoe.
Which is to say that I know
of two people 011 this campus
who don't recommend a trip to
the nix lit spots at Reno and
Lake Tahoe as apathy anti
dotes during' the closing weeks
of the quarter.
One of these is a roommate of
mine (Eric Nelte, by name) and
the other, I red-facedly admit, is
myself.
And while financially and sleep
wise the weekend was a total loss,
it turns out to be one of those
things you tell people about at
cocktails, or later give your sons
and daughters gas about doing
themselves.
Thanksgiving was a joyous
day; so joyous, in fact, 1 lint we
allowed ourselves to he talked
into a trip to the land of the
one-armed handits.
I can remember stuffing nickels
into a funny-looking machine at
3 a.m. last Friday. Quite a few,
in fact. And I can remember a
long, almost sleep-filled drive
from Lake Tahoe to Reno.
This comes after free breakfast
at Harrah's Club. And I feel like
I should say thanks for those free
donuts and that free coffee, ex
cept lhat 1 actually paid for mine
and everybody else's before I was
through.
And more nickels at Reno—and
little old ladies, pieir eyes filled
vviih determination, fighting to
keep two machines all to them
selves, and both going at one
time. And those 1-o-l's have the
sharpest elbows in the world, I
think.

And after a couple (if hours
of "ahh, sleep," 1 remember,
though vaguely, a plan to drop
a couple of coins at every club
in Reno to be able In say "I've
played 'em all."
j And most of all, I remember
not winning one penny for all my
J troubles. And my roommate re
members even more vividly, or to
a higher power, so to speak.
I am thoroughly convinced that
I slot machines are not the way to
make money at gambling estab
lishments these days, though T
am not thoroughly convinced that
lh;>re is any way at all.
And then, at 4 p.m. that Friday
I remember a trip up the moun
' tain between Carson City and
i Tahoe well, I almost remember
because we almost made it. But
| not quite.
Have you ever thought of
what you would do if your fuel
pump gave out halfway up a
mountain? In case you have
not, coasting down is one solu
t ion.
And if you end up a place
called Sagebrush Corral operated
by a loitering old codger likely
named Scrooge McGrouch. roll
over and die; you might as well.
But worse suppose you end up
: having to spend the in night in
| Carson City with barely enough
I t-ash to get a motel room and no
! money to pay for your car or to
I eat? This is really fun.
Carson City, even if it is in
j Nevada, is not the rip-snortingist
J town in the world. I fact I would
not even go so far as to call it a
town if it weren't the capitol of
Nevada.
Remember only one thing: to
check into the Aurora Motel
where they give free coupons
for free nickels at every club in
town. And owner "X" Oxoby
will tell you where your best
chances are.
And in one case—mine and
; that of a $10 jackpot he might
j be right.
Then try to recoup your losses
at roulette and craps try, I say.
for you never quite come back up
to what you started with. Unless
j you have enough brains to quit
1 when you're ahead.
What disturbs me most is to be
j sitting at a roulette table, calmly
I making piddling, but exciting,
liltle winnings, and to have the
wheel-spinner eye me sternly and
! say, "You could really make some
money tonight if you'd only use
your head."
Then, head for home —laugh-
ing all the way. For if you once
stop to think of the money you
110 longer ha\e, the time you
should have spent writing a
paper, the cost of the fuel
pump, the gas, and the $8 you
put into a motel instead of a
slot machine, you might start
to cry.
