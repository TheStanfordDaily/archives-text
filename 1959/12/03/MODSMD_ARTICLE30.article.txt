## 
### Sieve Baffrey Associate Editor 
Stanford's Intori'raternitv Coun
cil has set March 30-April 5 as
formal rushing week, according
to council Rushing Chairman
Dixon Arnett.
Open houses will be hold during
the first three days of the period,
March 30 and 31, and April 1.
Party dates have been set for
April I through 4, and formal
pledge card signing dinners will
bo held April 5.
"Additional open houses," Ar
nelt notes, "will be held during the
winter quarter Greek Week, but
the no-contact rule will surround
these dates. Also," Arnett says,
"the freshman orientation this
year will be held as a part <>112
(.reek Week rather than rushing
week."
Rush Utile Changes
IFC has made some changes in
the rushing rules for this year.
Major revisions among these in
clude the minus rule which this
year allows all freshman (minus
or not i to attend open houses, but
prohibits students who do not
have a 2.0 grade point average
from pledging a house.
Previously students who were
minus seven or below wore not
allowed to attend any part of
rushing week activities.
For business other than fra
ternity rushing, fraternity men
will now be individually allowed

U
I to enter Wilbur Hall and to en
gage in phone contact with fresh
man men. "This rule was adopt
ed," Arnett says, "to counteract
the unrealistic previous restric
tion of no contact whatsoever."
No-contact Changes
Additional changes have been
made in the no-contact rule for
i between-quarter vacations. Con
tact here is limited, however, 1o
"normal social contact between
individual friends." Arnett has
said that "No parties at this time
will be condoned."
The IFC rushing rules states
that it is the dual responsibility
of fraternity and pledge to ascer
tain the latter's eligibility.
Memorandum
No ol'f-campus social relation
ship will be condoned until the
j start of formal rush, according
to the rules. And fraternity men
will not be allowed in Wilbur Hall
during the final day of pledge
: card signing.
In a memorandum sent to all
fraternity houses Arnett has out
lined the action to be taken by the
IFC Judicial Committee in the
event of rules infractions.
Any rushoe convicted will not
be allowed to pledge a fraternity
for one year from the date of in
fraetion.
A fraternity convicted of a
rushing rule violation will be lim
ited in the number of pledges it
may accept for one full year.
