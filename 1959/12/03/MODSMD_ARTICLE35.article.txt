DALLAS, Tex. (/I 3 ) — The !
founder of the American Football
League said yesterday he isn't
worrying that the competing Na
tional Foot ball League has signed (
some of the top stars of the col
lege ranks.
"We're not interested in high
bidding for the name players,"
said Lamar Hunt, wealthy Dallas
oilman. "We want to build a solid
team."
He and his No. 1 executive, Don
Rossi, said they plan to tell the
college stars this:
The National Football League |
will have openings for only about
20 players from the new crop of
college players. The American
League will have 264.
"We'll put it to the kids that
way and it becomes a matter of 1
simple arithmetic to see which
way they'll go," said Rossi.
Thus Hunt and Rossi appeared
to rule out a financial fight for j
the top gridders, depending on
job security to lure players in a
I profession noted for the number j
of players who fail to make the
grade in the pro game.
The first-year draft of all men
signed since last December had
its first test Monday. The only j
way a club could protect a first-;
year man who played at least 90
days last sea-son was to advance
' him to the major league roster.
No less than 30 bonus babies
were moved up just for that rea
son.
