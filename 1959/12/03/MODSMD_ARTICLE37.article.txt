### Glenn Alford 
Arroyo Mouse intramural foot
ball fans and players are celebrat
ing one of the biggest upset in
Stanford Intramural history, fol
lowing Arroyo's defeat of Sigma
Chi, 14-8.
Sigma Chi was not without
bright spots in its defeat, for its
two tailbacks. Mike Filiee, who
was injured in the first series of
plays in the game, came back in
the second half to play a terrific
game. Tony Schraub. who shifted
to tailback when Filiee was in
jured was terrific both on offense
and defense. End Ed Kessler
caught five passes and intercepted
one on defense.
Strong Line
In the final analysis, it was the
Arroyo line and defensive back
field that made the difference in
the game. End Ed Ferry must be
singled out as Arroyo's individual
star, as he caught three passes,
one for a touchdown, and another
one for the following extra point.
Ferry intercepted two passes in
his own territory to stave off
Sigma Chi threats.
End Bill Teusch also caught a
touchdown pass, and its exlra
point, and played another of his
fine defensive games.
Tailback Sandy Pofahl aver
aged 7.2 yards per carry on six
rushes, and completed seven
passes for 67 yards.
Arroyo blocking was impene
tratable, as the blocking backs

Tom Condit, Steve Rose, and John j
Howden allowed few Sigma Chi
rushers to get through. John
Jones was a prime pass receiver
and a tough blocker. Bill Schroe
der played his best game of the
season at defensive halfback.

Pofahl threw three incomplete
passes, and Arroyo punted, but
they got the ball right back, as

minute left in the half for
