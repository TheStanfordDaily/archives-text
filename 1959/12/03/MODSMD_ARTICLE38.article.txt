# Hoopsters Prep For SJS Quintet

### 
San Jose State's Spartans, tabbed as a vastly improved team
this year and fresh off an opening game triumph, invade tho Pavilion
tonight to try to put an end to Stanford's two-season home winning
: streak.
The varsities battle at 8 p.m., after 4 and 6 p.m. preliminaries

between the Spartan and Card
JV and freshmen teams.
Stanford will be shooting for
number 17 in a row at home, try
ing to extend a string than goes
back to tho 1957-58 season and
last year including the last loss
suffered by national champion
California. If the dopesters have
it right, the Tribe may have a
tougher time handling the Spar
tans than last season's 57-40
season-opening romp.
No Trouble
In that one, the Indian first
stringers stormed to an easy 29-11
half time lead and then sat out
the second half as the inexperi
enced Spartans battled the re
serves. There isn't an abundance
of experience at San Jose this
year either hut the caliber of the
newcomers is rated high and
coach Walt McPherson lias said
unhesitatingly, 'we'll definitely
be stronger than lasl year."
San Jose opened its season
Tuesday night, running away
from -a San Francisco State five
in the second half for a 54-41 win.
Sophomore junior college trans
fer Vic Coi'l came off the bench

to ignite a Spartan rally in the
second half that quickly erased
the slim two-point halftime mar
gin.
Height is a major problem for
the Spartans—most of it coming
from two 6-5 newcomers, Dennis
Marc and Art Dalbey. Marc, a JC
transfer, scored seven points as
starting center against, SF State.
Dalbey, up from last season's fine
freshman squad managed only
two.
Key veterans in the attack are
6-4 Bob Chapman, 6-4 Jim Wheli
han and 5-10 Joe McGrath. All
collected 10 points Tuesday night,
sharing top honors with Corl.
Sophomore Gary Ryan is ex
pected to open at guard along
with McGrath, while Corl, Wheli
han and Chapman hold down the
forward spots. But there may be
trouble collaring many rebounds
against what is possibly Stan
ford's top rebounding five in
many seasons.
The Cards dominated Hie boards
Tuesday in the opener with the
University of San Francisco and

may have even more control
tonight.
Senior Jerry Thuesen paced the
Tribe on the boards, picking off
11 rebounds and gave indications
< that he would be no weak man
i underneath this year. The 6 7
| "vertical hyphen" and 6-8 sopho-

more John Windsor did a fine
job of controlling the boards
Tuesday, with big assists from
John Hendry, John Arrillaga,
Neal Brockmeyer and AI Simila.
Offensively, Arrillaga got off
to a great start for the season
with 20 points, and appears ready
to have the big year many have
hoped for him. Consistent scoring
in the 15-20 point bracket by
Arrillaga should go a long way
toward filling the scoring void
left by the graduated Paul Neu
mann.
Ji tiers
Windsor showed Ihe first game
jitters when it came 1o shooting,
but potentially is one of Ihe best
scoring big men Stanford has had
for many seasons.
In fact, improved seemed evi
dent all along the line for the
' Cards. Junior Bub Bowling was
a steady backcourt leader and
John Hendry potted four key
field goals in addition to his fine
board work.
Saturday, a strong St. Mary's
five comes to Ihe Pavilion. The
defending West Coast Athletic
Conference champions took some
heavy graduation losses, but still
have big Tom Meschery in the
post and are looking for another
banner season.

Backcourt ace
San Jose State's Spartans, tabbed as a vastly improved team
this year and fresh off an opening game triumph, invade tho Pavilion
tonight to try to put an end to Stanford's two-season home winning
: streak.
The varsities battle at 8 p.m., after 4 and 6 p.m. preliminaries

between the Spartan and Card
JV and freshmen teams.
Stanford will be shooting for
number 17 in a row at home, try
ing to extend a string than goes
back to tho 1957-58 season and
last year including the last loss
suffered by national champion
California. If the dopesters have
it right, the Tribe may have a
tougher time handling the Spar
tans than last season's 57-40
season-opening romp.
No Trouble
In that one, the Indian first
stringers stormed to an easy 29-11
half time lead and then sat out
the second half as the inexperi
enced Spartans battled the re
serves. There isn't an abundance
of experience at San Jose this
year either hut the caliber of the
newcomers is rated high and
coach Walt McPherson lias said
unhesitatingly, 'we'll definitely
be stronger than lasl year."
San Jose opened its season
Tuesday night, running away
from -a San Francisco State five
in the second half for a 54-41 win.
Sophomore junior college trans
fer Vic Coi'l came off the bench

to ignite a Spartan rally in the
second half that quickly erased
the slim two-point halftime mar
gin.
Height is a major problem for
the Spartans—most of it coming
from two 6-5 newcomers, Dennis
Marc and Art Dalbey. Marc, a JC
transfer, scored seven points as
starting center against, SF State.
Dalbey, up from last season's fine
freshman squad managed only
two.
Key veterans in the attack are
6-4 Bob Chapman, 6-4 Jim Wheli
han and 5-10 Joe McGrath. All
collected 10 points Tuesday night,
sharing top honors with Corl.
Sophomore Gary Ryan is ex
pected to open at guard along
with McGrath, while Corl, Wheli
han and Chapman hold down the
forward spots. But there may be
trouble collaring many rebounds
against what is possibly Stan
ford's top rebounding five in
many seasons.
The Cards dominated Hie boards
Tuesday in the opener with the
University of San Francisco and

may have even more control
tonight.
Senior Jerry Thuesen paced the
Tribe on the boards, picking off
11 rebounds and gave indications
< that he would be no weak man
i underneath this year. The 6 7
| "vertical hyphen" and 6-8 sopho-

more John Windsor did a fine
job of controlling the boards
Tuesday, with big assists from
John Hendry, John Arrillaga,
Neal Brockmeyer and AI Simila.
Offensively, Arrillaga got off
to a great start for the season
with 20 points, and appears ready
to have the big year many have
hoped for him. Consistent scoring
in the 15-20 point bracket by
Arrillaga should go a long way
toward filling the scoring void
left by the graduated Paul Neu
mann.
Ji tiers
Windsor showed Ihe first game
jitters when it came 1o shooting,
but potentially is one of Ihe best
scoring big men Stanford has had
for many seasons.
In fact, improved seemed evi
dent all along the line for the
' Cards. Junior Bub Bowling was
a steady backcourt leader and
John Hendry potted four key
field goals in addition to his fine
board work.
Saturday, a strong St. Mary's
five comes to Ihe Pavilion. The
defending West Coast Athletic
Conference champions took some
heavy graduation losses, but still
have big Tom Meschery in the

Backcourt ace
San Jose State's Spartans, tabbed as a vastly improved team
this year and fresh off an opening game triumph, invade tho Pavilion
tonight to try to put an end to Stanford's two-season home winning
: streak.
The varsities battle at 8 p.m., after 4 and 6 p.m. preliminaries

between the Spartan and Card
JV and freshmen teams.
Stanford will be shooting for
number 17 in a row at home, try
ing to extend a string than goes
back to tho 1957-58 season and
last year including the last loss
suffered by national champion
California. If the dopesters have
it right, the Tribe may have a
tougher time handling the Spar
tans than last season's 57-40
season-opening romp.
No Trouble
In that one, the Indian first
stringers stormed to an easy 29-11
half time lead and then sat out
the second half as the inexperi
enced Spartans battled the re
serves. There isn't an abundance
of experience at San Jose this
year either hut the caliber of the
newcomers is rated high and
coach Walt McPherson lias said
unhesitatingly, 'we'll definitely
be stronger than lasl year."
San Jose opened its season
Tuesday night, running away
from -a San Francisco State five
in the second half for a 54-41 win.
Sophomore junior college trans
fer Vic Coi'l came off the bench

to ignite a Spartan rally in the
second half that quickly erased
the slim two-point halftime mar
gin.
Height is a major problem for
the Spartans—most of it coming
from two 6-5 newcomers, Dennis
Marc and Art Dalbey. Marc, a JC
transfer, scored seven points as
starting center against, SF State.
Dalbey, up from last season's fine
freshman squad managed only
two.
Key veterans in the attack are
6-4 Bob Chapman, 6-4 Jim Wheli
han and 5-10 Joe McGrath. All
collected 10 points Tuesday night,
sharing top honors with Corl.
Sophomore Gary Ryan is ex
pected to open at guard along
with McGrath, while Corl, Wheli
han and Chapman hold down the
forward spots. But there may be
trouble collaring many rebounds
against what is possibly Stan
ford's top rebounding five in
many seasons.
The Cards dominated Hie boards
Tuesday in the opener with the
University of San Francisco and

may have even more control
tonight.
Senior Jerry Thuesen paced the
Tribe on the boards, picking off
11 rebounds and gave indications
< that he would be no weak man
i underneath this year. The 6 7
| "vertical hyphen" and 6-8 sopho-

more John Windsor did a fine
job of controlling the boards
Tuesday, with big assists from
John Hendry, John Arrillaga,
Neal Brockmeyer and AI Simila.
Offensively, Arrillaga got off
to a great start for the season
with 20 points, and appears ready
to have the big year many have
hoped for him. Consistent scoring
in the 15-20 point bracket by
Arrillaga should go a long way
toward filling the scoring void
left by the graduated Paul Neu
mann.
Ji tiers
Windsor showed Ihe first game
jitters when it came 1o shooting,
but potentially is one of Ihe best
scoring big men Stanford has had
for many seasons.
In fact, improved seemed evi
dent all along the line for the
' Cards. Junior Bub Bowling was
a steady backcourt leader and
John Hendry potted four key
field goals in addition to his fine
board work.

Conference champions took some
heavy graduation losses, but still

post and are looking for another
