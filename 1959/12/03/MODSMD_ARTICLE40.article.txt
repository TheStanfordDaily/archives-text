What's Left of Football
About all that's loft of college football this season is an after
noon by a television set come the first day of !!>(!(>. From all the looks
of things, this year's bowl games should provide a pretty good share
of excitement. The Bone Bowl, for one, appears to bo one of the
best matches that has been scheduled at Pasadena since the Big
Ten signed their half of the contract.
Usually the llig Ten team comes to Pasadena as the big favorite
and most of the lime goes home just as big a favorite. This year,
however, the Pacific Coast could have themselves one of their better
afternoons at the Hose liowl and its even very conceivable that the
Washington Huskies might garner one of those rare Pacific Coast
victories.
I was fortunate enough during the season to get a look at both
Washington and Wisconsin in action and from what I saw this year's
game should he extremely even.
Both teams have solid, well coached lines, perhaps the best in

their respective areas. Wisconsin
has one of the biggest lines in
the nation and also one of the
best. Two of the Badgers for
wards were chosen on the all Big
Ten squad and both of these two
players, tackle Dan l.unphear and
guard Jerry Stalcup, have been
given All-America mention. Lan
phear weighs in at 21.1 and Slai
cup is a pound lighter.
Right opposite Stalcup on New
Year's Day will be either Chuck
Allen tii Bill Kiniiiine. Both Allen
and Kinmiiic are among the line
men on the Coast. Allen has been
the mainstay of the strong Husky
forward wall this year. He was
the best lineman I saw during
the season.
Kinnune, sometimes tackle and
sometimes guard, is not too far
behind Allen. At 21"> pounds he
should he a very even match
for either Stalcup or Lanpliear de
pending on which spot in the line
Washington Coach Jim Owens
decides to use him. --

Both linos have plehty of depth as well. Wisconsin is loaded with
bi£ hungry guards and tackles. When Stanford was at Madison, a
tackle named Jim Heineke outshone both the highly rated Stalciip
and Lanphear. Because of the stiff competition, Gootcli Jenkins, a
230 pound tackle has had to man the bench this year after breaking
into the Wisconsin starting lineup last year.
Washington too has plenty of lineman ready to go. Kurt Gegner,
Roy McKasson, and Barry Billiard are first class forwards.
Both teams gang tackle to perfection something of the style
Ih;it made l-SC's "Chinese Bandit" line so well known last year.
Even Up Front
For one of the rare limes in recent Rose Bowl hi-story the lineplay
should be on equal grounds.
Both teams have an excellent quarterback as well. Wisconsin's
Dale llackbart, after an injury-ridden early season, came back to
cop the All Bit; Ten quarterback spot. Bob Scliloredt, Husky quarter
back, has been named on almost all the Pacific Coast All Star teams.
Hackbart is an exceptionally good runner for a quarterback but
can also pass if it's needed. Scliloredt fits practically the same de
scription. He's run a great deal this year but as an Oregon high
schooler, Scliloredt was one of the stale's best passers.
The thing that could spell the difference in Ihe game is speed,
and it is here where Washington has the definite advantage.
George Fleming, Don McKeta, Kay Jackson, and Joe Jones
give Washington a much speedier backfield than their opposing
Bargcr backs.
T\w Jimmy lirown School
All four of these backs look as if they have been designed after
the .Jim Brown school of running. They run hard like a fullback,
but give any of them a step and they have the speed to be gone.
Wisconsin's Iml Hart, Tom Weisner, Bob Zcman, Hon Steiner are
hard runners but have nothing better than average speed. The line
makes the holes and the Badger backs make thro: 1 and four yards
at a time.
That brings ius down to a prediction. 1 guess the first Rose Bowl
choice to be made this year. Anway, keep your eye glued to the
television set this NewYcar's for the Huskies to win by one touch
down.

For one of the rare limes in recent Rose Bowl hi-story the lineplay
should be on equal grounds.
Both teams have an excellent quarterback as well. Wisconsin's
Dale llackbart, after an injury-ridden early season, came back to
cop the All Bit; Ten quarterback spot. Bob Scliloredt, Husky quarter
back, has been named on almost all the Pacific Coast All Star teams.
Hackbart is an exceptionally good runner for a quarterback but
can also pass if it's needed. Scliloredt fits practically the same de
scription. He's run a great deal this year but as an Oregon high
schooler, Scliloredt was one of the stale's best passers.
The thing that could spell the difference in Ihe game is speed,
and it is here where Washington has the definite advantage.
George Fleming, Don McKeta, Kay Jackson, and Joe Jones
give Washington a much speedier backfield than their opposing
Bargcr backs.
T\w Jimmy lirown School
All four of these backs look as if they have been designed after
the .Jim Brown school of running. They run hard like a fullback,
but give any of them a step and they have the speed to be gone.
Wisconsin's Iml Hart, Tom Weisner, Bob Zcman, Hon Steiner are
hard runners but have nothing better than average speed. The line
makes the holes and the Badger backs make thro: 1 and four yards
at a time.
That brings ius down to a prediction. 1 guess the first Rose Bowl
choice to be made this year. Anway, keep your eye glued to the
television set this NewYcar's for the Huskies to win by one touch

About all that's loft of college football this season is an after
noon by a television set come the first day of !!>(!(>. From all the looks
of things, this year's bowl games should provide a pretty good share
of excitement. The Bone Bowl, for one, appears to bo one of the
best matches that has been scheduled at Pasadena since the Big
Ten signed their half of the contract.
Usually the llig Ten team comes to Pasadena as the big favorite
and most of the lime goes home just as big a favorite. This year,
however, the Pacific Coast could have themselves one of their better
afternoons at the Hose liowl and its even very conceivable that the
Washington Huskies might garner one of those rare Pacific Coast
victories.
I was fortunate enough during the season to get a look at both
Washington and Wisconsin in action and from what I saw this year's
game should he extremely even.
Both teams have solid, well coached lines, perhaps the best in

their respective areas. Wisconsin
has one of the biggest lines in
the nation and also one of the
best. Two of the Badgers for
wards were chosen on the all Big
Ten squad and both of these two
players, tackle Dan l.unphear and
guard Jerry Stalcup, have been
given All-America mention. Lan
phear weighs in at 21.1 and Slai
cup is a pound lighter.
Right opposite Stalcup on New
Year's Day will be either Chuck
Allen tii Bill Kiniiiine. Both Allen
and Kinmiiic are among the line
men on the Coast. Allen has been
the mainstay of the strong Husky
forward wall this year. He was
the best lineman I saw during
the season.
Kinnune, sometimes tackle and
sometimes guard, is not too far
behind Allen. At 21"> pounds he
should he a very even match
for either Stalcup or Lanpliear de
pending on which spot in the line
Washington Coach Jim Owens
decides to use him. --

Both linos have plehty of depth as well. Wisconsin is loaded with
bi£ hungry guards and tackles. When Stanford was at Madison, a
tackle named Jim Heineke outshone both the highly rated Stalciip
and Lanphear. Because of the stiff competition, Gootcli Jenkins, a
230 pound tackle has had to man the bench this year after breaking
into the Wisconsin starting lineup last year.
Washington too has plenty of lineman ready to go. Kurt Gegner,
Roy McKasson, and Barry Billiard are first class forwards.
Both teams gang tackle to perfection something of the style

their respective areas. Wisconsin
has one of the biggest lines in
the nation and also one of the
best. Two of the Badgers for
wards were chosen on the all Big
Ten squad and both of these two
players, tackle Dan l.unphear and
guard Jerry Stalcup, have been
given All-America mention. Lan
phear weighs in at 21.1 and Slai
cup is a pound lighter.
Right opposite Stalcup on New
Year's Day will be either Chuck
Allen tii Bill Kiniiiine. Both Allen
and Kinmiiic are among the line
men on the Coast. Allen has been
the mainstay of the strong Husky
forward wall this year. He was
the best lineman I saw during
the season.
Kinnune, sometimes tackle and
sometimes guard, is not too far
behind Allen. At 21"> pounds he
should he a very even match
for either Stalcup or Lanpliear de
pending on which spot in the line
Washington Coach Jim Owens
decides to use him. --

Both linos have plehty of depth as well. Wisconsin is loaded with
bi£ hungry guards and tackles. When Stanford was at Madison, a
tackle named Jim Heineke outshone both the highly rated Stalciip
and Lanphear. Because of the stiff competition, Gootcli Jenkins, a
230 pound tackle has had to man the bench this year after breaking
into the Wisconsin starting lineup last year.
Washington too has plenty of lineman ready to go. Kurt Gegner,
Roy McKasson, and Barry Billiard are first class forwards.
Both teams gang tackle to perfection something of the style
Ih;it made l-SC's "Chinese Bandit" line so well known last year.
Even Up Front
For one of the rare limes in recent Rose Bowl hi-story the lineplay
should be on equal grounds.
Both teams have an excellent quarterback as well. Wisconsin's
Dale llackbart, after an injury-ridden early season, came back to
cop the All Bit; Ten quarterback spot. Bob Scliloredt, Husky quarter
back, has been named on almost all the Pacific Coast All Star teams.
Hackbart is an exceptionally good runner for a quarterback but
can also pass if it's needed. Scliloredt fits practically the same de
scription. He's run a great deal this year but as an Oregon high
schooler, Scliloredt was one of the stale's best passers.
The thing that could spell the difference in Ihe game is speed,
and it is here where Washington has the definite advantage.
George Fleming, Don McKeta, Kay Jackson, and Joe Jones
give Washington a much speedier backfield than their opposing
Bargcr backs.
T\w Jimmy lirown School
All four of these backs look as if they have been designed after
the .Jim Brown school of running. They run hard like a fullback,
but give any of them a step and they have the speed to be gone.
Wisconsin's Iml Hart, Tom Weisner, Bob Zcman, Hon Steiner are
hard runners but have nothing better than average speed. The line
makes the holes and the Badger backs make thro: 1 and four yards
at a time.
That brings ius down to a prediction. 1 guess the first Rose Bowl
choice to be made this year. Anway, keep your eye glued to the
television set this NewYcar's for the Huskies to win by one touch
down.

About all that's loft of college football this season is an after
noon by a television set come the first day of !!>(!(>. From all the looks
of things, this year's bowl games should provide a pretty good share
of excitement. The Bone Bowl, for one, appears to bo one of the
best matches that has been scheduled at Pasadena since the Big
Ten signed their half of the contract.
Usually the llig Ten team comes to Pasadena as the big favorite
and most of the lime goes home just as big a favorite. This year,
however, the Pacific Coast could have themselves one of their better
afternoons at the Hose liowl and its even very conceivable that the
Washington Huskies might garner one of those rare Pacific Coast
victories.

Washington and Wisconsin in action and from what I saw this year's
