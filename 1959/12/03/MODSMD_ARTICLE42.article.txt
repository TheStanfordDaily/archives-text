### 
HOUSTON. Tex. (/P) Aging
Joe Brown again kept his world's
lightweight championship last
night as his fists slashed stubby
British challenger Dave Charn
i ley about the eyes, forcing a halt
in their battle after five rounds.
Ii was Brown's eighth defense
of the crown.
Brown, the Baton Rouge, La.,
Negro who has hold the title for
i more than three years, was lead
ling the Englishman on points
when the end came.
Opened Cut
Just before the fifth round was
over Brown lashed out with a left
hook that opened a deep cut over
Charnley's right eye.
Charnley weathered the round,
although staggering, and stum
bled to his corner. While his
handlers worked over the deeply
bleeding cut, Referee Jimmy
Webb of Houston raised Brown's
hand and called the fight at an
end.
Unintentional
C'harnley and his manager, Ar
hur Boggis, claimed it was an
unintentional butt and not a blow
that opened the cut and Boggis
said he asked the referee to stop
Iho fight.
Referee Webb said, however,
that it was not a butt but a blow
to the head.
It was obvious that Brown was
going to win the scheduled 15-
round bout anyway. He had car
ried every round on all except one
judge's card.
In the second round Brown's
flicking left and his 3'i*-inch
reach advantage was the big point
jin this fight had opened a slight
cut under Charnley's right eye. In
the third Brown had swarmed the
little man from Britain. But
Charnley gave indications of a
i comeback in ihe fourth.
By winning last night, Brown
! tied the all-time record for de
fenses of the title in this class.
Benny Leonard set it before re
tiring in 1925.

50-■■l6 for Brown under the 10-point
| must system. Judge Ernie Taylor
; had it 49-46 and Judtro W. IT. Cor
t nelius scored it 50-45.
