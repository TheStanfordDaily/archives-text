Nowhere in the United States is the economic "grass" greener
than in the great agricultural areas of our nation. New farm
equipment has increased productivity. New home conven
iences have brought a higher standard of living, and demands
grow for an even better way of life.
]'art of this better living has been the demand for more and
better Communications.
It follows that as these rural areas expand and prosper, so
docs General Telephone. For these are the areas we serve.
In Wisconsin, for instance, dairy farms are producing more
milk of better quality from fewer cows. Wisconsin country
homes are bright and up to date. Their standard of living is
equal to or better than that of their city brothers.
In this one state, Gen Tel plans to spend more than $:>0 mil
lion in the next few years improving and increasing telephone
services and facilities.
This is a typical example of how we strive not only to meet
today's communications needs-but to answer tomorrow's.
