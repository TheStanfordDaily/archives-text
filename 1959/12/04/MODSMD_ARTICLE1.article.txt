# Goldwater Talk Slated Friday
## 
### 
Arizona Republican senator Barry M. Goldwater. who considers
United Auto Workers' President Walter Reuther "more dangerous
than the Sputniks or anything the Russians might do," will speak
next Friday at 7:30 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium on "Conservatism
and the Labor Problem."
Only the second Republican senator in Arizona history. Gold-

water has a 254-page file on
Reuther and flips through it
whenever lie wants to ho stimu
lated.
Purely Philosophical
"My differences with Reulher
are purely philosophical," Gold
water says. "He's not a bad guy.
He's a churchman and good to his
Jamily. But I think he is a devoted
socialist. And 1 don't like what
ho is* doing with his union. I
don't like his taking dues money
from Republicans and Democrats
to help elect Democrats."
Reuther isn't exactly a Gold
water fan either. "He is this
country's number one political
fanatic, its number one anti
labor baiter and ils number one
peddler of class hatred."
Shoots front Hip
Goldvvater, whom one writer
calls a man who shoots from the
hip with both guns, doesn't like
big government or business
any more than he likes big labor.
"Too many Republicans have
adopted the Democratic principle
that the people of the U.S. should
be federally born, fedcrall y
housed, federally clothed, federal
ly educated, federally supported
in their occupations, and die a
federal death, thereafter to be
buried in a federal box in a fed
eral cemetery," he says.
'(Conservative's Conservative'
Considered a "conservative's
conservative," Goldwater is op
posed to foreign aid and the wel
fare state. He is in favor of
states' rights, drastic government
economy and lower taxes.
He says his critics ignore the
fact that he is just as opposed to
big business as he is to big gov
ernment and to big labor. "All
three are inherently dangerous to
a free-enterprise system," he
states.
Goldvvater is considered the
most versatile member of the
Senate. He is a brigadier general
and has taken off and landed in
nine of the Air Force's jet models.
During World War II he was a
ferry pilot in the Air Transport
Command and a participant in
the only trans-Atlantic flight of
single-engine fighter-aircraft.
Jazz Addict
A Dixieland Jazz addict. Gold
water can play the trombone,
saxophone, and clarinet. He is
an authority on Arizona's 90,000
native Indians among whom he
is variously known as "Barry
Sundust," "Barry One Salt," and
"Curly Head."
A Republican official says,
"Goldwater has more leadership
potential than any of the younger
men I saw on our side of the aisle
in 10 years. All he needs is more
maturity and not to let himself
get so riled by his adversaries."
Th e controversial senator's
talk is sponsored by the Repub
lican Caucus of the Political Un
ion in conjunction with the Stan
ford Area Young Republicans.
