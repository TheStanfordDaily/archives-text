# Christmas Intermezzo ‘Joyous’
## 
### JoAnn Healy 
An excellent program of Christ
mas music and readings was pre
sented in the Bender Room of the
main library yesterday. Unfor
tunately, only a few students were
able to hear it.
The program featured the Stan
ford Chorale in a selection of tra
ditional Christmas carols. The
music was characterized by joy
ousness and a feeling for the
spirit of Christmas. There was a
very pleasant absence of such
numbers as "Green Christmas" or
"Santa Baby." All the carols were
well done but especially good were
the harmonies in the German
"Taubelein Weiss" and the
sprightly Dong, Ding;
Merrily on High; Christmas Bells
Are Ringing."
Attractive Program
The program opened with "The
Holly and the Ivy."
For the first time a Cantata
was presented. It was Das Neuge
borne Kindelein, part of Ihe Ad
vent music which is sung before
Christmas. It was accompanied
by Birgitte Vinding, John Plant
ing. and Harold Schmidt, violins;
Erich Schwandt, harpsichord;
and Curtis Given, cello.
The audience gave a special
burst of applause to "Haeia Belen
Borrico," which featured living
Pearson as soloist.
Dr. Maruery Bailey was sched

ulotl Io read three selections from
Dickens: "Celebration with the
Fcz/.iwigs," "Celebration with Iho
Cralchits" and "Christmas Morn
ing." She did these in her usual
entertaining style, but she also
added other passages which filled
in the complete story and kept up
Ihe continuity. Her reading
brought out many highlights
which are usually slurred over in
presentations of Dickens.
Audience -loins In
The program closed with the
audience and chorale joining in
singing Silent As tho audi
ence left ihc library, the Hoover
Tower carillon played the Holly
and ihe Ivy. also the chorale's
closing number.
The program was marred by
one major drawback, however.
There was not nearly room
enough for the people who want
ed to come. Although the pro
gram was scheduled to start at
by 3:30 no more people were
admitterl. There were 250 people
in Ihe audience but not more than
50 students got in. The rest of the
audience was composed of visitors
from San Francisco and Palo Alto.
In the future, when such a good
program is being planned, it
should either, be repeated, with
one performance reserved for
Stanford faculty and students, or
it should ho held in a larger audi
torium.
