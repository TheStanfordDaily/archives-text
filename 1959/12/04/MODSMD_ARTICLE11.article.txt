# Ike's Goodwill Journey Begins; Rome Firs Stop
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) President Eisenhower took off on his unprecedented 22,000-mile 11-nation
goodwill mission last night.
He set out to proclaim across three continents "America's deepest desire" for a world that will
disarm in peace and freedom.
A military air transport jet liner bearing the chief executive and his party of 21 aids and assist-

ants roared into the night sky
shortly after he broadcast a de
parture speech from* his White
House office, setting the theme of
his historic journey.
'Mutual Disarmament'
"In every country," he said, "I
hope to make widely known
America's deepest desire â€” a
world in which all nations may
prosper in freedom, justice, and
peace, unmolested and unafraid."
The first requirement for re
ducing the tensions now dividing
the world, Eisenhower said, is a
start on mutual disarmament be
tween the western powers and the
Soviet Union.
But until that is achieved, he
declared in the nationwide radio-
TV broadcast, the United States
must maintain, in quality and
power, an adequate military
strength.
Steel Dispute
He said economic strength is
essential to the maintenance of
the nation's military power as
well as its prosperity. The steel
dispute must be settled, he de
clared, "or else, in due course"
the American people will see to it
that labor and management in
this case "act responsibly." This
sounded like a clear threat of
government intervention, if and
when Eisenhower decides it is
necessary.
Eisenhower also made an ap
peal for strong support of the for
eign program which, he said, pro
vides "a peaceful barrier, erected
by freedom, to the continuous
probing of predatory forces."
Summit Conference
The effect of the President's
words seemed to be that in a
Western summit conference at
Paris at the climax of his for
eign mission, Dec. 19-21, Eisen
hower will be in favor of giving
high priority to disarmament as
a subject for East-West summit
conference negotiation next year.
The President is due in Rome
today at noon, Rome time.
