# Future Stanford Sites

### 
The now flurry of controversy over Stuttgart, stirred by Betty
Kantor'i. appraisal in the latest Sequoia, should prove beneficial
to the overall Stanford-in-Germany program.
A principal recommendation coming out of this discussion is to
move thi' present silo near leading university and city in Germany
\\ bother or not this is desirable (and there are sound arguments
on both sides), the simple economics of the set-up make it
unlikely that there will be any moves made soon, if at all.
W bile solutions to shortcomings of the Stuttgart program
cannot always bo applied to Stuttgart, they can certainly be used
in planning future overseas Stanford sites.
The Florence branch appears to overcome the location criti
cism aimed at Stuttgart, simply due to its being in a city offering
cultural and intellectual stimulation.
We anticipate lh<> University will strongly consider arguments
in favor of city location before establishing further study centers
abroad. Stuttgart, as the first of the series, constitutes an experi
ment. The lessons it can teach should not, and we assuirie will not,
be ignored in the expansion of this program.
