Editor, The Daily:
I am not a student and there
fore have not been one of the
"Stnll garters," but as a German
I would like to give my opinion in
this discussion.
I agree wholeheartedly with
Betty Kantor's suggestion to
move "Stanford in Germany"
close to a German university;
especially one located in a bigger
city.
I do no see much sense in an
American stu lent colony formed
on a romantic Burg in a country
vide t ha provides much beauty
t har 'ly any intellectual stim
ulation.
it will only harden the one
ded, s ereotype image so much
lo\ed by American tourists of he
"gemutliche" German enjoying

| wine (or beer, for that matter),
i songfests and folk dances, and
wearing Lederhosen and Dirndl
j kleider.
Germany's youth of today is not
like that. Let your students live
close to German students, thus
giving them the possibility to
share their intellectual life, their
joys and their problems — and
their freedom! Give them a
chance to find out what life in
modern industrialized Germany is
really like!
I know very well how many
difficulties would have to be over
come to relocate the Stanford
Campus in Germany in the sug
gested way— but I definitely think
the effort is worth while for all
parties concerned.
