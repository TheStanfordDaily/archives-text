Loans of money sometimes end
! up in strange ways.
Especially if they are given
| with all kinds of strings attached.
Take the case of a little $500,000
I loan to Harvard and Yale by the
I United States government.
It has somehow found its way
back to the United Stales gov
ernment. And its journey was
no accident.
The money was granted in the
! form of student loans under the
National Defense Education Act
of 1958 to a great number of
colleges and universities through
out the country.
The strings involved are a
loyalty oath and a disclaimer affi
davit which requires a student
applying for a loan to swear that
he does not believe in, belong to,
or support "any organization that
believes in or teaches the over
throw of the U.S. government by
force or violence or by any illegal
or unconstitutional methods."
Harvard President Nathan M.
Pusey described the affidavit as
"misguided," and Yale President
A. Whitney Griswold called ii
"contrary to the classic principles
of our colleges and universities."
The Oberlin student body also
refused $35,0(H) in NDEA funds
in a campus-wide referendum.
A special committee of the
NDEA believes there should
"be no compromise of princi
ples involved in opposition to
the disclaimer affidavit. . . ."
Antioch is holding the funds
without using them until Con
gress repeals both ihe loyalty
oath and disclaimer clause. The
school considers the clause "a
threat of academic freedom."
Princeton Un iv e r si t y, Bryn
Mawr, Swart hmore, Haverford,
Wilmington and Reed colleges re
fused to participate in the pro
gram entirely because of the re
quirements.
Grinnell, St. John's, Goucher,
Bennington, Amherst and Sarah
Lawrence have also refused
i money.
This protest has had an ef
fect on a great many campuses
throughout the country.
SC loan oficials have given no
indication that they will protest
or withdraw from the program.
Minnesota, which received $250,-
000 worth of federal loan money
this year, is having no 1 rouble
getting rid of the money. But the
I University is working actively to
convince Congress to amend the
I NDEA to get rid of the loyalty
oath.
An editorial in the Minnesota
Daily put it tins way:
"The decision is up to the
individual in the meantime. He
may choose principle and pov
erty or cash and compromise.
"While the decisions of Harvard
and Yale are a very dramatic
way to point up feeling towards
the loyalty oath, Minnesota's ap
proach is as sensible as any."
An editor in the Cornell Daily
! Sun seems to agree with this
position.
"The university must oppose
the loyalty affidavit in the
strongest terms, working to
wards the eventual elimination
of this unfortunate legislation.

1 Kill unless the university can
provide* all its students with
sufficient financial aid, it must
continue to accept federal aid,
having the moral decision to
the students themselves. This
is the decision which Cornell
has made. It is essentially a
wise one, one of which there is
no reason to he ashamed."
But student letters at Cornell
i were a little more violent in their
; stands.
". . . Oberlin's position, and the
position of a member of other
"prestige" schools who have acted
similarly, seems to border on the
absurd. . . .
"In order to exist, a demo
cratic society must curtail free
doms in order that they be pre
; sen ed. . . .
"The loyally oath only makes
explicit a duty which exists im
: plicit ly."
"in imposing a loyalty oath,
i (he government is only asking
for the minimum assurance clue
to any creditor; and the student
always has the liberty of refusing
the loan and thus avoiding the
oath. But, due to the action of
the administrations of Harvard,
Yale, and Oberlin, their students
i no longer have ihis liberty."
The battle continues in letters:
"The paradox in preserving
freedom by curtailing it is ob
vious. What or who will deter
mine how much freedom should
I be curtailed?
"Federal aid is essential if
; higher education is to survive in
this country. Yet, we cannot ac
! cept it with a clause that negates
; the whole purpose of educa
i lion. . . ."
"i heartily feel that the Uni
versities were correct in their
action. One does not correct
abuses by ignoring them or tell
ing people to walk around them.
"Therefore, let Cornell Univer
sity follow the examples of its
peers, Yale, Harvard, and Oberlin,
land renounce aid from the 'stu
dent loan' act in the hope that its
abusive loyalty oath may then be
! eliminated."
Michigan State University plans
! continued utilization of NDEA
! funds.
University of Washington Presi
dent Charles Odegaard said he
agreed with Yale and Harvard

j presidents, but "in view of tlie
| very great need of our students
for this particular financial as
i sistance" Odegaard was "reluc-
I tant to recommend" that the Uni-
I versiiy drop out of the program.
A University of Oregon stu
dent commented, "As a grateful
recipient of a Defense Act loan
1 would like to state that sign
ing tlx* affidavit was no more
i distasteful to me than the four

years I spent in the Marines
including six months in Korea."
The Daily Californian came out
with this statement:
"At tlie risk of being branded
a black reactionary, we do not
feel the University should follow
the example of those schools
which have withdrawn from the
National Education Defense Act
loan program because of objec
tion to the loyalty oath provi
sion. . . .
"The University may dislike the
oath requirement. But why burn
the house down because you ob
ject to the garage?
At Ctd, the American Asso
ciation of University Professors
and the ASUC have objected to
the requirements.
And a student there feels that
accepting the money shows thai
"money is in the long run more
important than a full intellectual
integrity."
The University of Chicago Ma
roon put it this way:
"This provision is an obvious
and inexcusable insult to the
integrity of the students of the
United States. As has been often
stated, the oath is also function
less and superfluous. Moreover,
why shouldn't a student belong
to the organizations the attor
ney general disapproves of?
"Those schools which refused
the money are fine company;
University of Chicago should be
proud to be a member of this
group. The University of Chicago
should be a member of this
group."
And from Stanford University,
nothing but silence from every
quarter.

The Daily Californian came out
with this statement:
"At tlie risk of being branded
a black reactionary, we do not
feel the University should follow
the example of those schools
which have withdrawn from the
National Education Defense Act

"The University may dislike the

And a student there feels that
accepting the money shows thai

The University of Chicago Ma
roon put it this way:
"This provision is an obvious
and inexcusable insult to the
integrity of the students of the
United States. As has been often
stated, the oath is also function
less and superfluous. Moreover,
why shouldn't a student belong
to the organizations the attor
ney general disapproves of?
"Those schools which refused

University of Chicago should be

And from Stanford University,
nothing but silence from every

Loans of money sometimes end

Take the case of a little $500,000
I loan to Harvard and Yale by the

It has somehow found its way
back to the United Stales gov
ernment. And its journey was
no accident.
The money was granted in the
! form of student loans under the
National Defense Education Act
of 1958 to a great number of
colleges and universities through
out the country.
The strings involved are a
loyalty oath and a disclaimer affi
davit which requires a student
applying for a loan to swear that
he does not believe in, belong to,
or support "any organization that
believes in or teaches the over
throw of the U.S. government by
force or violence or by any illegal
or unconstitutional methods."
Harvard President Nathan M.
Pusey described the affidavit as
"misguided," and Yale President
A. Whitney Griswold called ii
"contrary to the classic principles
of our colleges and universities."
The Oberlin student body also
refused $35,0(H) in NDEA funds
in a campus-wide referendum.
A special committee of the
NDEA believes there should
"be no compromise of princi
ples involved in opposition to
the disclaimer affidavit. . . ."
Antioch is holding the funds
without using them until Con
gress repeals both ihe loyalty
oath and disclaimer clause. The
school considers the clause "a

Princeton Un iv e r si t y, Bryn

Wilmington and Reed colleges re

Grinnell, St. John's, Goucher,
Bennington, Amherst and Sarah
Lawrence have also refused
i money.
This protest has had an ef
fect on a great many campuses
throughout the country.
SC loan oficials have given no
indication that they will protest
or withdraw from the program.
Minnesota, which received $250,-
000 worth of federal loan money
this year, is having no 1 rouble
getting rid of the money. But the
I University is working actively to
convince Congress to amend the
I NDEA to get rid of the loyalty
oath.
An editorial in the Minnesota
Daily put it tins way:
"The decision is up to the
individual in the meantime. He
may choose principle and pov
erty or cash and compromise.
"While the decisions of Harvard
and Yale are a very dramatic
way to point up feeling towards
the loyalty oath, Minnesota's ap
proach is as sensible as any."
An editor in the Cornell Daily
! Sun seems to agree with this
position.
"The university must oppose
the loyalty affidavit in the
strongest terms, working to
wards the eventual elimination
of this unfortunate legislation.

1 Kill unless the university can
provide* all its students with
sufficient financial aid, it must
continue to accept federal aid,

the students themselves. This
is the decision which Cornell
has made. It is essentially a

". . . Oberlin's position, and the
position of a member of other
"prestige" schools who have acted

"In order to exist, a demo

"The loyally oath only makes

"in imposing a loyalty oath,

The battle continues in letters:

i money.
This protest has had an ef
fect on a great many campuses
throughout the country.
SC loan oficials have given no
indication that they will protest
or withdraw from the program.
Minnesota, which received $250,-
000 worth of federal loan money
this year, is having no 1 rouble
getting rid of the money. But the
I University is working actively to
convince Congress to amend the
I NDEA to get rid of the loyalty
oath.
An editorial in the Minnesota
Daily put it tins way:
"The decision is up to the
individual in the meantime. He
may choose principle and pov
erty or cash and compromise.
"While the decisions of Harvard
and Yale are a very dramatic
way to point up feeling towards
the loyalty oath, Minnesota's ap
proach is as sensible as any."
An editor in the Cornell Daily
! Sun seems to agree with this
position.
"The university must oppose
the loyalty affidavit in the
strongest terms, working to
wards the eventual elimination
of this unfortunate legislation.

1 Kill unless the university can
provide* all its students with
sufficient financial aid, it must
continue to accept federal aid,
having the moral decision to
the students themselves. This
is the decision which Cornell
has made. It is essentially a
wise one, one of which there is
no reason to he ashamed."
But student letters at Cornell
i were a little more violent in their

". . . Oberlin's position, and the
position of a member of other
"prestige" schools who have acted
similarly, seems to border on the

"In order to exist, a demo

; sen ed. . . .
"The loyally oath only makes
explicit a duty which exists im
: plicit ly."
"in imposing a loyalty oath,
i (he government is only asking
for the minimum assurance clue
to any creditor; and the student
always has the liberty of refusing
the loan and thus avoiding the
oath. But, due to the action of
the administrations of Harvard,
Yale, and Oberlin, their students
i no longer have ihis liberty."
The battle continues in letters:
"The paradox in preserving

vious. What or who will deter

I be curtailed?
"Federal aid is essential if

"i heartily feel that the Uni

"Therefore, let Cornell Univer

The Daily Californian came out
with this statement:
"At tlie risk of being branded
a black reactionary, we do not
feel the University should follow
the example of those schools
which have withdrawn from the

"The University may dislike the

At Ctd, the American Asso

And a student there feels that
accepting the money shows thai
"money is in the long run more

The University of Chicago Ma
roon put it this way:
"This provision is an obvious
and inexcusable insult to the
integrity of the students of the
United States. As has been often
stated, the oath is also function
less and superfluous. Moreover,
why shouldn't a student belong
to the organizations the attor

"Those schools which refused

Loans of money sometimes end

Take the case of a little $500,000
I loan to Harvard and Yale by the
I United States government.
It has somehow found its way
back to the United Stales gov

no accident.
The money was granted in the
! form of student loans under the
National Defense Education Act
of 1958 to a great number of
colleges and universities through
out the country.
The strings involved are a
loyalty oath and a disclaimer affi
davit which requires a student
applying for a loan to swear that
he does not believe in, belong to,
or support "any organization that
believes in or teaches the over
throw of the U.S. government by
force or violence or by any illegal
or unconstitutional methods."
Harvard President Nathan M.
Pusey described the affidavit as
"misguided," and Yale President
A. Whitney Griswold called ii
"contrary to the classic principles
of our colleges and universities."
The Oberlin student body also
refused $35,0(H) in NDEA funds
in a campus-wide referendum.
A special committee of the
NDEA believes there should
"be no compromise of princi
ples involved in opposition to
the disclaimer affidavit. . . ."
Antioch is holding the funds
without using them until Con
gress repeals both ihe loyalty

school considers the clause "a

The University of Chicago Ma
roon put it this way:
"This provision is an obvious
and inexcusable insult to the
integrity of the students of the
United States. As has been often
stated, the oath is also function
less and superfluous. Moreover,
why shouldn't a student belong
to the organizations the attor
ney general disapproves of?
"Those schools which refused
the money are fine company;
University of Chicago should be
proud to be a member of this
group. The University of Chicago
should be a member of this
group."
And from Stanford University,
nothing but silence from every
quarter.
Loans of money sometimes end
! up in strange ways.
Especially if they are given
| with all kinds of strings attached.
Take the case of a little $500,000
I loan to Harvard and Yale by the
I United States government.
It has somehow found its way
back to the United Stales gov
ernment. And its journey was
no accident.
The money was granted in the
! form of student loans under the
National Defense Education Act
of 1958 to a great number of
colleges and universities through
out the country.
The strings involved are a
loyalty oath and a disclaimer affi
davit which requires a student
applying for a loan to swear that
he does not believe in, belong to,
or support "any organization that
believes in or teaches the over
throw of the U.S. government by
force or violence or by any illegal
or unconstitutional methods."
Harvard President Nathan M.
Pusey described the affidavit as
"misguided," and Yale President
A. Whitney Griswold called ii
"contrary to the classic principles
of our colleges and universities."
The Oberlin student body also
refused $35,0(H) in NDEA funds
in a campus-wide referendum.
A special committee of the
NDEA believes there should
"be no compromise of princi
ples involved in opposition to
the disclaimer affidavit. . . ."
Antioch is holding the funds
without using them until Con
gress repeals both ihe loyalty
oath and disclaimer clause. The
school considers the clause "a
threat of academic freedom."
Princeton Un iv e r si t y, Bryn
Mawr, Swart hmore, Haverford,
Wilmington and Reed colleges re
fused to participate in the pro
gram entirely because of the re
quirements.
Grinnell, St. John's, Goucher,
Bennington, Amherst and Sarah
Lawrence have also refused
i money.
This protest has had an ef
fect on a great many campuses
throughout the country.
SC loan oficials have given no
indication that they will protest
or withdraw from the program.
Minnesota, which received $250,-
000 worth of federal loan money
this year, is having no 1 rouble
getting rid of the money. But the
I University is working actively to
convince Congress to amend the
I NDEA to get rid of the loyalty
oath.
An editorial in the Minnesota
Daily put it tins way:
"The decision is up to the
individual in the meantime. He
may choose principle and pov
erty or cash and compromise.
"While the decisions of Harvard
and Yale are a very dramatic
way to point up feeling towards
the loyalty oath, Minnesota's ap
proach is as sensible as any."
An editor in the Cornell Daily
! Sun seems to agree with this
position.
"The university must oppose
the loyalty affidavit in the
strongest terms, working to
wards the eventual elimination
of this unfortunate legislation.

1 Kill unless the university can
provide* all its students with
sufficient financial aid, it must
continue to accept federal aid,
having the moral decision to
the students themselves. This
is the decision which Cornell
has made. It is essentially a
wise one, one of which there is
no reason to he ashamed."
But student letters at Cornell
i were a little more violent in their
; stands.
". . . Oberlin's position, and the
position of a member of other
"prestige" schools who have acted
similarly, seems to border on the
absurd. . . .
"In order to exist, a demo
cratic society must curtail free
doms in order that they be pre
; sen ed. . . .
"The loyally oath only makes
explicit a duty which exists im
: plicit ly."
"in imposing a loyalty oath,
i (he government is only asking
for the minimum assurance clue
to any creditor; and the student
always has the liberty of refusing
the loan and thus avoiding the
oath. But, due to the action of
the administrations of Harvard,
Yale, and Oberlin, their students
i no longer have ihis liberty."
The battle continues in letters:
"The paradox in preserving
freedom by curtailing it is ob
vious. What or who will deter
mine how much freedom should
I be curtailed?
"Federal aid is essential if
; higher education is to survive in
this country. Yet, we cannot ac
! cept it with a clause that negates
; the whole purpose of educa
i lion. . . ."
"i heartily feel that the Uni
versities were correct in their
action. One does not correct
abuses by ignoring them or tell
ing people to walk around them.
"Therefore, let Cornell Univer
sity follow the examples of its
peers, Yale, Harvard, and Oberlin,
land renounce aid from the 'stu
dent loan' act in the hope that its
abusive loyalty oath may then be
! eliminated."
