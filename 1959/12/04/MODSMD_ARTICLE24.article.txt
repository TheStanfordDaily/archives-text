DECK THE HALLS
When you tllink Christmas crifts you naturally think of
Marlboro cigarettes, leading seller in flip-top box in all fifty
states—and if we annex Wales, in all fifty-one—and if we annex
Lapland, in all fifty-two. (This talk about annexing Wales and
Lapland is, incidentally, not just idle speculation. Client Britain
wants to trade Wales to the United States for a desert. (Iretit
Britain needs a desert desperately on account of the tourist
trade. Tourists are always coming up to the Prime Minister or
the Lord Privy Seal, or the Thane of fllamis, or like that and
saving, "I'm not knocking your country, mind von. It's very
quaint and picturesque, etc., what with Buckingham Palace and
Bovril and Scotland Yard, etc., but wherc's your desert?"

Before T forget, lot mo point out that Scotland Yard, Britain's
plain-clothos police branch, was namod after Wally Scotland and
Fred Yard who invented plain clothes. The American plain
clothes force is called the F. 8.1, after Frank B. Inchcliff, who
invented fingerprints. Before Mr. InchclifT's invention, every
body's fingers were absolutely glassy smooth. This, as you may
imagine, played hob with the identification of newborn babies
in hospitals. From 1701 until J!>o4 no American parent ever
brought home the right baby from the hospital. This later be
came known as the Black Tom Explosion.
(But T digress. England, I was saj'ing, wants to trade Wales
for a desert. Sweden wants to trade Lapland for Frank B.
Inchcliff. The reason is that Swedes to this day still don't have
fingerprints. As a result, identification of babies in Swedish
hospitals is so haphazard that Swedes flatly refuse to bring "
their babies home. There are, at present, nearly a half-billion
unclaimed babies in Swedish hospitals—some of them well over
eighty years old.)
But I digress. Marlboro is, of course, an ideal Christmas gift
for your friends and loved ones who enjoy filter cigarettes. If,
on the other hand, your friends and loved ones like mildness
but don't like filters, then you can't go wrong with a carton of
Philip Morris. If your friends and loved ones like a subtly
mentholated cigarette that combines refreshing taste with high
filtration, then buy a carton of Alpines. (Alpines, incidentally,
are named after the late Albert (!. Pine. A 1 Pine worked all his
life to invent a cigarette that would combine lijiht menthol and
high filtration, but alas he never succeeded. As by-products of
his research he did manage to invent the atom, the gooseneck
lamp and the cocker spaniel, but the lightly mentholated high
filtration cigarette, alas, never. Now this dream is realized,
and' what could he more fitting than to pay tribute to this gal
lant man by calling this cigarette Alpine?) u,.wm„,

ire think he is a funny I'elloir. II e think you'll think so tort,
if you look at his television aeries "THE MA\Y I.OYES
OF DOME UILLIS"—and read lirs latest hook, "I II I.S' 1
TEES- IdE DWARF."
