# Daily Defers To Ol’ GPA
## 
### 
So that everybody will have
plenty of time to study, and
because we feel that you have
to stop eating taeos sometime,
The Daily is suspending pub
lication for a few weeks.
Realizing that the typical
student spends a good part of
his day reading the journalistic
masterpieces of The Daily,
(while enjoying a taeo), we felt
i1 advisable to remove you front
the very temptation and en
courage a little scholastic en
deavor.
But . . . as an old soldier once
said, "we shall return."
The next Daily will appear
-lan. 5, the day after winter
quarter registration. So don't
panic when you can't find a
Daily on registration day. Com
plete registration instructions
can be found in, of all places,
your handy little registration
book —not The Daily.
On this festive note, we say
have a festive holiday season
and don't let that Mexican
heartburn get you down.
