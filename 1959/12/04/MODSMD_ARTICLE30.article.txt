## Now Have Two Wins 
### John Schwarz, Sports Editor 
Employing a tighl defense
against a terribly cold San Jose
basketball team, Coach Howie
Dallmar's Stanford Indians coast
ed home with a 69-31 victory
over the Spartans last night at
the Stanford Pavilion.
The game was one-sided from
the moment John Arrillaga
snared the opening tip off for
Stanford until Mike Ledgerwood
hooked in the Indians 69th point
with 10 -seconds remaining in the
game.
The most exciting feature of
the game to the spectator was
whether or not the San Jose
squad would break double figures
in the second half against the
tight Stanford defense. The Spar
tans didn't as they only picked up
eight markers in the final 20
minutes one field goal and six
free throws.
Opened Quickly
Stanford opened the game
quickly jumping into a five noth
ing lead as John Windsor and
Bub Bowling opened the scoring.
By midway through the first half
the Indians were rolling along to
the tune of a 17-7 lead with John
Arrillaga and Jerry Thuesen
joining Windsor and Bowling in
the score column.
It was evident at this point that
San Jose would be no match for
the more seasoned Indians and
Dallmar began substituting
freely.
With all five of Dallmar's
starters on the bench, San Jose
came to life and closer the first
half with five quick points. Jim
Embree and Joe McGrath picked
up a couple of quick baskets and
foul shot for the Spartans and
the teams left the court with the
Indians out in front 32-23.
Bowling Stars
The Indian first team back in
action at the beginning of the sec
ond half wasted no time in pour
ing it on the defenseless Spar
tans. The first ten minutes of the
second half saw Stanford drop
in 16 points to a mere five for
San Jose. The Spartans could not
penetrate Stanford's extremely
tight switching man to man de
fense and could not stop the hot
handed Indian -shooters.
Guard Bub Bowling's passing,
shooting, and all around court
brilliance in the opening minutes
of the second half was the spark
that set his team mates off on
their early moments scoring
spree.
The last seven minutes of ac
tion saw Dallmar insert first
Stanford's second squad and later
the third unit. Despite his many
substitutions the Indians still
managed to roll up baskets at
will.
Everybody Makes It
Neal Brockmeyer, Jim Bryan,
Phil Kelly, John Stahler and A1
Simila had first crack at the
Spartans with Mike Ledgerwood,
Nels Christensen and Tom Nord
land coming in for the final three
minutes.
The two second units threw in
ihe final IS Stanford points while
holding the Spartans to three
tallies.

basketball team, Coach Howie
Dallmar's Stanford Indians coast
ed home with a 69-31 victory
over the Spartans last night at
the Stanford Pavilion.
The game was one-sided from
the moment John Arrillaga
snared the opening tip off for
Stanford until Mike Ledgerwood
hooked in the Indians 69th point
with 10 -seconds remaining in the
game.
The most exciting feature of
the game to the spectator was
whether or not the San Jose
squad would break double figures
in the second half against the
tight Stanford defense. The Spar
tans didn't as they only picked up
eight markers in the final 20
minutes one field goal and six
free throws.
Opened Quickly
Stanford opened the game
quickly jumping into a five noth
ing lead as John Windsor and
Bub Bowling opened the scoring.
By midway through the first half
the Indians were rolling along to
the tune of a 17-7 lead with John
Arrillaga and Jerry Thuesen
joining Windsor and Bowling in
the score column.
It was evident at this point that
San Jose would be no match for
the more seasoned Indians and
Dallmar began substituting
freely.
With all five of Dallmar's
starters on the bench, San Jose
came to life and closer the first
half with five quick points. Jim
Embree and Joe McGrath picked
up a couple of quick baskets and
foul shot for the Spartans and
the teams left the court with the
Indians out in front 32-23.
Bowling Stars
The Indian first team back in
action at the beginning of the sec
ond half wasted no time in pour
ing it on the defenseless Spar
tans. The first ten minutes of the
second half saw Stanford drop
in 16 points to a mere five for
San Jose. The Spartans could not
penetrate Stanford's extremely
tight switching man to man de
fense and could not stop the hot
handed Indian -shooters.
Guard Bub Bowling's passing,
shooting, and all around court
brilliance in the opening minutes
of the second half was the spark
that set his team mates off on
their early moments scoring
spree.
The last seven minutes of ac
tion saw Dallmar insert first
Stanford's second squad and later
the third unit. Despite his many
substitutions the Indians still
managed to roll up baskets at
will.
