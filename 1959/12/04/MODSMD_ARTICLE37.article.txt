### 
LOS ANGELES (/P) — Fleeing
from the cold of the East, unde
feated and untied Syracuse flew
to sunny Southern California
yesterday, heavily favored to
whip UCLA in their nationally
televised game Saturday.
Upwards of 60,000 fans are ex
pected to witness the clash.
Syracuse Coach Floyd Schwartz
walder may lie a little anxious
about the outcome because the
squad had four days off last week
for the Thanksgiving holiday.
And he was able to drill the
team only two days, indoors, be
fore leaving Syracuse and its
snow.
Coach Bill Barnes said the
Bruins are in fair condition al
though he is still concerned with
the gimpy ankle of his star half
back. Bill Kilmer.
Kilmer's running was obviously
hampered against USC, nd he
was not much belter against Utah
last week. It was his passing that
won both games, but Barnes said
this one weapon won't bo enough
against Syracuse.
