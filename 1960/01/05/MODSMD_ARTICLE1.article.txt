# Strike Ends as Steelworkers Get Pay Boost
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (JP) â€” The worst steel labor dispute in the na
tion's history ended yesterday on terms recommended by the govern
ment.
The settlement was worked out by Vice President Richard M.
Nixon and Secretary of Labor James P. Mitchell as a peacemaking

team that may presage t heir
i nomination as the Republican
j choices for president and vice
president respectively.
Wage Boost
The agreement calls for a re
ported 40 cents an hour boost in
pay and benefits over a 30-month
period running to July 1, 1962.
Specific details were not an
nounced pending ratification by
; union and industry groups. How
i ever, it was clear that the terms
! exceeded the bounds of what the
industry had said would be nonin
flationary.
That seemed to foretell an in
crease in steel prices, although the
industry wasn't saying for the
time being. Magazine Steel said
price hikes will inevitably result.
No Leeway
The industry failed, too, to gel
the leeway it wanted to stream
line its work force. Instead, the
United Steelworkers Union mere
ly agreed to engage in a joint
study of the controversial work
rules problem.
The end of the eight-month dis
pute wipes out the threat of a
new steel strike later this month
when a Taft-Hartley law injunc
tion is due to expire.
This clears the economic skies.
After the news yesterday, stock
prices made sharp advances early,
but many lost their gains before
t the close. Steels and rails scored
the largest upturns.
