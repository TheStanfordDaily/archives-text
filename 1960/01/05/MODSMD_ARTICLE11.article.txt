# Campus in France Newest Stanford Venture Abroad
## First Group of 80 Students To Make Trip in Autumn 
### 
Stanford in France—the newest and largest of the University's
overseas campuses—is excepted to open in September with an in
augural class of 80 undergraduate students.
President Wallace Sterling disclosed that negotiations to establish
Stanford's campus at Tours, France are almost complete.

"We had hoped to inaugurate a
campus in France in 1961," Ster
ling said, "but the wonderful
cooperation of the French govern
ment has put us a whole year
ahead in our plans."
The second overseas Stanford
campus at Florence, Italy, will
open its doors for the first time
the same month as the one at
Tours.
The University plans to lease
a new,four-story, stone and con
crete building overlooking the
Loire River at the northern en
trance to Tours. The building is
owned by the French Ministry of
Education as a part of Tours'
Cultural Center, a branch of the
University of Poitiers.
Arrangements Discussed
Arrangements to allow Stan
ford students to eat with Poitiers
students, use their gymnasium,
and use other facilities are being
discussed.
The new building is next to the
Cultural Center library, within
a few blocks of the 12,000 volume
USIS library, and is a ten-minute
walk from the center of Tours.
The city, 145 miles southwest of
Paris, has a population of 85,000,
and is a center of the printing
industry and silk manufacturers.
Historical Landmark
History marks the Battle of
Tours, fought south of the city in
732 A.D., as a turning point of
Islam expansion through West
ern Europe.
As at Stanford's other European
campuses, at Stuttgart, Germany
and Florence, the Tours center
will observe regular class sched
ules Monday through Thursday
with long weekends encouraging
travel through France and other
nearby nations.
Willi the opening of the new
campus, 224 undergraduates will
study in Europe every six months.
Dr. .Robert A. Walker, director of
the Stanford overseas program,
points out that an opportunity for
studying abroad is now available
to a wider range of students than
in the past.
Competitive Selection
Acadcmic standing will still bo
a consideration. Dr. Walker said,
but selection will bo competitive
among applicants with no abso
lute standard.
When the three campuses are
in operation, more than 30 per
cent of Stanford's students will
have the opportunity to study
overseas at some time in their
undergraduate careers.
