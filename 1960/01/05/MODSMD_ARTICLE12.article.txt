The moving date for the Stan
ford Post Office to its new build
ing has been postponed until
approximately Feb. 1, according
to Palo Alto Postmaster Ralph
Evans.
Post Office officials explained
that they will use a duplicate box
number system for the next
month so that box holders will
receive their mail as usual at the
old post office.
Evans explained that, minor
work must still be done before
the new building can be approved
as complete by the real estate
section of the San Francisco Re
gional Post Office.
"As soon as the building is ap
proved, we will move in in four
or five days," Evans said.
The Stanford Post Office also
announced that as soon as the
post office is located in its new
quarters general delivery will be
discontinued for all but transients
remaining less than 30 days.
All persons now receiving mail
at general delivery who do not
have dormitory boxes will be re
quired to rent boxes in the new
post office. A c harge of 33 cents
per quarter will be made on all
post office boxes in Stern and
Crothers halls.
The Post Offiec also announced
that after July 1 the minimum
post office box charge will be
raised to $1.20 per Quarter.
