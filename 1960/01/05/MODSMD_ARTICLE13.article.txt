Applications for Stanford's
three overseas campuses will be
accepted in the Registrar's Office
throughout winter quarter.
For students with two quarters
of German, openings at Stanford
in-Germany's classes beginning
Jan. 1961 are available.
The other two campuses, at
Tours, France and Florence,
Italy, will open in September of
this year. The language require
ment for France will be one year
of French at Stanford or two
years of high school French. For
Italy, the requirement is one year
of a Romance language or Latin.
Students who will be sopho
mores, juniors or seniors at the
time of departure are eligible.
Freshmen are urged to apply, said
Professor Robert A. Walker, but
a substantial proportion of stu
dents attending the center are
expected to be juniors or seniors.
Dr. Walker stated that failure
to be selected for any one group
will not be a handicap in later
selections.
The program is part of the
General Studies Program at Stan
ford and is designed for students
from all fields, thus making stu
dents eligible regardless of major.
Courses taught at the centers
will fulfill General Studies re
quirements and are particularly
suited to the European setting,
Dr. Walker said. Increasing use
of European professors and in
tellectual leaders as visitors to the
centers and as special lecturers is
expected.
