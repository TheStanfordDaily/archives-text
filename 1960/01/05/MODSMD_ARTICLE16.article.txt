CHRISTMAS CAME to Stanford by way of France this year,
with announcement of arrangements to open a third Stanford
in-Furope site.
The interesting factor in the announcement from a time stand
point is that il almost immediately follows what was to date (lie
strongest criticism of the Stanford-in-Gerinanv program.
Points of contention were primarily the location and the lack
of contact with German students. The University position ap
peared lo he one carefully weighing the pros and eons of such
items as location of future campuses in large cities before secur
ing further sites.
Only a few weeks before announcement of Ihe new Tours
location, administration officials bad told a student group that
no third campus was contemplated in the very near future. Il
was explained that Stanford hoped to do the best possible jobs
at its Stuttgart and Florence sites rather than quickly expanding
just for expansion's sake.
In the new France branch, however, Stanford has found what
looks to be the best of the three European campuses. Location
in a town of some size overcomes, as does the Florence site, com
plaints against the isolation of Stuttgart.
But establishment of the branch at a local university provides
the best opportunity for cultural and ideological exchange with
intelligent natives of the country, and use of local resources.
Stanford is most fortunate to have so quickly located a site
which apparently overcomes major criticisms of tin' overseas
stiulv program, and at the same time has moved the timetable
for study in France at least a year ahead of schedule.
It is equally fortunate that Stanford was flexible enough to
take advantage of a suddenly-found opportunity.
