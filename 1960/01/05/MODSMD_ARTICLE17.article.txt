Although Mr. Nixon is now the
President's one and only heir,
there is a most important part of
the estate which he cannot in
herit. It has been Gen. Eisen
hower's unique achievement that
he has been able to place himself
as President above the party
battles, and to invest for the time
being the office with the attri
butes of a constitutional mon
archy.
This has enveloped him with
an aura of invulnerability such
as no other President in modern
tunes, if ever before, has en
joyed. Whatever has gone
wrong lias been blamed on his
ministers and he has moved
above it serene and untouched.
This exalted position is unique
ly Eisenhower's, and it cannot be
passed on to his successor. It is
entirely beyond Mr. Nixon's reach.
As a candidate, as a President if
he is elected, Mr. Nixon will be
down in the dust and the heat of
the battle, not above it in the clear
blue yonder.
In this critical respect there
could be no sharper contrast than
between Eisenhower and Nixon—
between the non-political world
famous soldier who was - drawn
into politics at the top and the
ambilious young man who clawed
his way up from obscurity.
The contrast is a warning that
a Nixon administration will not
be and cannot be a continuation
of the Eisenhower administra
tion. We shall find, 1 believe,
that the Eisenhower admini
stration lias been an Interlude
which cannot continue and will
not soon be repeated.
The party struggle which has
been throttled down under Eisen
hower is certain to break out
again under Nixon. Our present
situation—that of living under a
divided government with the Re
publicans in control of the Execu
tive branch and the Democrats of
the Legislative — has been made
workable by President Eisen
hower's prestige with which he
has over-awed the Democratic
Congressional leaders.
With Nixon the party struggle
would be bound to revive, and a
divided government would then
seem far less benign than it does
under the Eisenhower-Johnson
regime.
As a candidate, the immediate
question about Nixon is whether
he will be carried into office by
(he Eisenhower tide, or whether
he will have to fight for his
elect ion.
The Eisenhower tide is a strong
one, and it will continue to run

strongly if, as the economists say,
the business boom continues, and
if at the summit meeting in May
there is a prospect of some con
tinuing accommodation.
It is not easy to build up an op
position to Eisenhower. As a party
the Democrats have not yet been
able to make an effective case
against him, and Gov. Rockefeller
found that he could not make one
either.
Yet there is a case to be made,
and some fine day —perhaps not
yet in the 1960 elections —some-
one will make the case.
The case against Eisenhower's
prosperity is that we are not pro
ducing enough wealth of the right
kind. Our economic growth is
slower than is required by our
position in the world, which is
challenged as it has never been
challenged before.
And of the wealth we do pro
duce too large a proportion goes
into consumer goods which are
not necessities, and too small a
proportion into public necessities,
both military and civilian.
The case against the Eisen
hower administration on the
"peace" issue is not that he is
seeking an accommodation with
the Soviet Union. With the race
in nuclear armaments as men
acing as it is, it would be a
neglect of the President's duty
if he did not seek the accommo
dation.
The great charge to be made
against the Eisenhower admini
stration is that it has been fumb
ling the ball in the contest of
armaments with the Soviet Un
ion. Thus it has compelled us to
negotiate for the accommodation
from a second rate position.
Although, no doubt, military ex
penditures ought to be increased,
the primary source of the fumb
ling in the Pentagon is a feeble
leadership from the White House.
Thus, we are not meeting the
challenge of the Soviet Union.
It is a dual challenge—to nego
tiate and to compete, to reduce
the international tension and to
increase the national effort.
This is the case which, if I
have read the record rightly.
Rockefeller would have made
had the Republican contest been
an open one.
This is the case which the Dem
ocrats need to make if ever they
can unite behind a candidate who
understands the case and has the
eloquence to take it to the coun
try.

stration is that it has been fumb
ling the ball in the contest of
armaments with the Soviet Un
ion. Thus it has compelled us to
negotiate for the accommodation
from a second rate position.
Although, no doubt, military ex
penditures ought to be increased,
the primary source of the fumb
ling in the Pentagon is a feeble
leadership from the White House.
Thus, we are not meeting the
challenge of the Soviet Union.
It is a dual challenge—to nego
tiate and to compete, to reduce
the international tension and to
increase the national effort.
This is the case which, if I
have read the record rightly.
Rockefeller would have made
had the Republican contest been
an open one.
This is the case which the Dem

can unite behind a candidate who
understands the case and has the
eloquence to take it to the coun

Although Mr. Nixon is now the
President's one and only heir,
there is a most important part of
the estate which he cannot in
herit. It has been Gen. Eisen
hower's unique achievement that
he has been able to place himself
as President above the party
battles, and to invest for the time
being the office with the attri
butes of a constitutional mon
archy.
This has enveloped him with
an aura of invulnerability such
as no other President in modern
tunes, if ever before, has en
joyed. Whatever has gone
wrong lias been blamed on his
ministers and he has moved
above it serene and untouched.
This exalted position is unique
ly Eisenhower's, and it cannot be
passed on to his successor. It is
entirely beyond Mr. Nixon's reach.
As a candidate, as a President if
he is elected, Mr. Nixon will be
down in the dust and the heat of
the battle, not above it in the clear
blue yonder.
In this critical respect there
could be no sharper contrast than
between Eisenhower and Nixon—
between the non-political world
famous soldier who was - drawn
into politics at the top and the
ambilious young man who clawed
his way up from obscurity.
The contrast is a warning that
a Nixon administration will not
be and cannot be a continuation
of the Eisenhower administra
tion. We shall find, 1 believe,
that the Eisenhower admini
stration lias been an Interlude
which cannot continue and will
not soon be repeated.
The party struggle which has
been throttled down under Eisen
hower is certain to break out
again under Nixon. Our present
situation—that of living under a
divided government with the Re
publicans in control of the Execu
tive branch and the Democrats of
the Legislative — has been made
workable by President Eisen
hower's prestige with which he
has over-awed the Democratic
Congressional leaders.
With Nixon the party struggle
would be bound to revive, and a
divided government would then
seem far less benign than it does
under the Eisenhower-Johnson
regime.
As a candidate, the immediate
question about Nixon is whether
he will be carried into office by
(he Eisenhower tide, or whether
he will have to fight for his
elect ion.
The Eisenhower tide is a strong
one, and it will continue to run

strongly if, as the economists say,
the business boom continues, and
if at the summit meeting in May
there is a prospect of some con
tinuing accommodation.
It is not easy to build up an op
position to Eisenhower. As a party
the Democrats have not yet been
able to make an effective case
against him, and Gov. Rockefeller
found that he could not make one
either.
Yet there is a case to be made,
and some fine day —perhaps not
yet in the 1960 elections —some-
one will make the case.
The case against Eisenhower's
prosperity is that we are not pro
ducing enough wealth of the right
kind. Our economic growth is
slower than is required by our
position in the world, which is
challenged as it has never been
challenged before.
And of the wealth we do pro
duce too large a proportion goes
into consumer goods which are
not necessities, and too small a
proportion into public necessities,
both military and civilian.
The case against the Eisen
hower administration on the
"peace" issue is not that he is
seeking an accommodation with
the Soviet Union. With the race
in nuclear armaments as men
acing as it is, it would be a
neglect of the President's duty
if he did not seek the accommo
dation.

and some fine day —perhaps not
yet in the 1960 elections —some-
one will make the case.
The case against Eisenhower's
prosperity is that we are not pro
ducing enough wealth of the right
kind. Our economic growth is
slower than is required by our
position in the world, which is
challenged as it has never been
challenged before.
And of the wealth we do pro
duce too large a proportion goes
into consumer goods which are
not necessities, and too small a
proportion into public necessities,
both military and civilian.
The case against the Eisen
hower administration on the
"peace" issue is not that he is
seeking an accommodation with
the Soviet Union. With the race
in nuclear armaments as men
acing as it is, it would be a
neglect of the President's duty
if he did not seek the accommo
dation.
The great charge to be made
against the Eisenhower admini
stration is that it has been fumb
ling the ball in the contest of
armaments with the Soviet Un
ion. Thus it has compelled us to
negotiate for the accommodation
from a second rate position.
Although, no doubt, military ex
penditures ought to be increased,
the primary source of the fumb
ling in the Pentagon is a feeble
leadership from the White House.
Thus, we are not meeting the
challenge of the Soviet Union.
It is a dual challenge—to nego
tiate and to compete, to reduce
the international tension and to
increase the national effort.
This is the case which, if I
have read the record rightly.
Rockefeller would have made
had the Republican contest been
an open one.
This is the case which the Dem
ocrats need to make if ever they
can unite behind a candidate who
understands the case and has the
eloquence to take it to the coun
try.

Although Mr. Nixon is now the
President's one and only heir,
there is a most important part of
the estate which he cannot in
herit. It has been Gen. Eisen
hower's unique achievement that
he has been able to place himself
as President above the party
battles, and to invest for the time
being the office with the attri
butes of a constitutional mon
archy.
This has enveloped him with
an aura of invulnerability such
as no other President in modern
tunes, if ever before, has en
joyed. Whatever has gone
wrong lias been blamed on his
ministers and he has moved
above it serene and untouched.
This exalted position is unique
ly Eisenhower's, and it cannot be
passed on to his successor. It is
entirely beyond Mr. Nixon's reach.
As a candidate, as a President if
he is elected, Mr. Nixon will be
down in the dust and the heat of
the battle, not above it in the clear
blue yonder.
In this critical respect there
could be no sharper contrast than
between Eisenhower and Nixon—
between the non-political world
famous soldier who was - drawn
into politics at the top and the
ambilious young man who clawed
his way up from obscurity.
The contrast is a warning that
a Nixon administration will not
be and cannot be a continuation
of the Eisenhower administra
tion. We shall find, 1 believe,
that the Eisenhower admini
stration lias been an Interlude
which cannot continue and will
not soon be repeated.
The party struggle which has
been throttled down under Eisen
hower is certain to break out
again under Nixon. Our present
situation—that of living under a
divided government with the Re
publicans in control of the Execu
tive branch and the Democrats of
the Legislative — has been made
workable by President Eisen
hower's prestige with which he
has over-awed the Democratic
Congressional leaders.
With Nixon the party struggle
would be bound to revive, and a
divided government would then
seem far less benign than it does
under the Eisenhower-Johnson
regime.
As a candidate, the immediate
question about Nixon is whether
he will be carried into office by
(he Eisenhower tide, or whether
he will have to fight for his
elect ion.
The Eisenhower tide is a strong
one, and it will continue to run

strongly if, as the economists say,
the business boom continues, and
if at the summit meeting in May
there is a prospect of some con
tinuing accommodation.
It is not easy to build up an op
position to Eisenhower. As a party
the Democrats have not yet been
able to make an effective case
against him, and Gov. Rockefeller
found that he could not make one
either.
