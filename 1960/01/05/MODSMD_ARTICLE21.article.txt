Franco or FDR?
Editor, The Daily:
When Nikita Khrushchev, form
er Lord High Executioner of 2,-
000,00U Ukrainians and Acting
Jailor of All Ihe Russias, .jeered a
group of protesting Hungarians,
the sophisticated of San Francisco
smiled over their martini glasses.
Paradoxically, these same Lib
erals deprecated Eisenhower's
presence in Madrid. . . .
Commendable gentlemen, but
let us look at reality. Who else
offered to aid the Fallange in its
valiant struggle to expurge Spain
of Marxism? If Franco's accept
ance of Nazi support was morally
reprehensible, was it not equally
abominable for Roosevelt to give

aid and comfort to that great
humanitarian Joseph Stalin?
Any answer, short of Commu
nist apologetics, would either ex
pulcate Spain or incriminate
America. Moreover, while Franco
collaborated with Hitler to save
his people, we . . . created a
power vacuum in Eastern Europe,
divided Germany, and surrendered
China to the communists.
Whose voice bade the Hungar
ians to throw off the shackles of
slavery, and when they did, read
meaningless resolutions in the
U.N. and set up "smashing good"
soup kitchens for the refugees?
Who was the greater traitor to
the West? Franco or FDR?
