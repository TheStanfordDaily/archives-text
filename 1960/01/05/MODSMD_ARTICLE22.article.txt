"8:30 a.m. I meet with one of our Foremen at the plant garage
to discuss a cable-pressurizing job. We're putting all aerial
cable in Hutchinson under air pressure to keep out moisture
which causes cable failure and costly service interruptions."


"1:30 p.m. After lunch, I drive out to the new plant of a mobile
home manufacturer. My men are completing installation of a
new-type cordless switchboard. I discuss features of the new
equipment with the firm's Vice President and Plant Manager."


"10:15 a.m. My boss, District Plant Superintendent Randy
Barron, and I go over plans for an addition to our dial central
office. Several pieces of large and complex switching equipment
will have to be rearranged to tie in with the new facilities."


"3:00 p.m. At our toll center we'll soon be adding another
test desk to increase our facilities for 'trouble shooting' Long

over some of the board changes which will have to be made."
