Stanford basketball fortunes
took a dip during Iho Christmas
break as the Indians dropped
three contests, all on the road
against Wisconsin, GO-61, Mar
quette 71-58. and Oregon, 55-56,
in an overtime.
At Eugene, Saturday, the In
dians lost their sixth game in
nine this season, the loss being
only the second in nineteen en
counters with the Ducks.
The score was a 49-all lie at the
end of the regulation time limit,
but the Ducks jumped into a
quick overtime lead and man
aged to hold on to win.
Oregon's Rask sunk a free
throw to send the Ducks into a
short-lived lead which ihe Indian's
Jerry Thueson ended with a field
goal from the corner.
But two Oregon goals combined
with two free tosses put the
Ducks beyond the Indians' grasp
as the game ended with Oregon
nipping the Cards by one point.
The loss to Oregon gives the
Indians a three and six won-10-ss
record on the season with wins
against USF, San Jose State, and
Michigan and losses to St. Mary's,
Wisconsin' Marquette, West Vir
ginia. Illinois, and Oregon.
