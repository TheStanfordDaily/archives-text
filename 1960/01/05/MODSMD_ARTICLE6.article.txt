-1 ters ordered the "receivership,"
in effect putting the house on a
; national probation.
The IFB intends to make a
monthly review of house activi
ties. Violation of any of the con
ditions of the probation could
result in an IFB recommendation
of permanent dissolution of the
fraternity by University Presi
dent Wallace Sterling.
These conditions include that
: no individual be found guilty of
| an Honor Code violation or "any
J offense against public order,"
