# County Won't Press Case Against Crary
## 
### 
Deputy District Attorney Ern
est Schmidt announced Dec. 7
that Stanford student Stephen
Crary's car is the one that ran
over and killed his fraternity
brother John Opsahl Nov. 20, but
Crary will not be prosecuted for
Opsahl's death because he com
mitted no negligent act.
New tests run by the Santa
Clara County Crime Laboratory
detected human blood on the un
dercarriage of Crary's car. First
tests on the car showed that blood
and other material on it belonged
to a rabbit. But Schmidt ordered
further tests, which revealed the
human blood.
Crary's car did not contain
enough blood to permit it to be
matched to Opsahl's, but Schmidt
said he was "satisfied that Crary s
car is the one that struck Opsahl.
"There was no negligent act by
Crary that caused the death of
Opsahl." Schmidt said. He said
Crary "did everything he could
after the accident" by calling an
ambulance and police. "There will
be no criminal prosecution be
cause there was no crime."
Schmidt said.
Opsahl, 19-year-old Stanford
â€¢sophomore, died Nov. 20 when
he was hit by a car as he lay in
the Sigma Nu driveway.
