# Medics Transplant Dog Heart
## 
### Carl Oliver 
A new surgical technique pioneered by two
Stanford surgeons in an operation un a two and a
half year-old mongrel clog last Wednesday may
prove to be the first step toward the replacement
of injured human organs.
The heart from another mongrel dog was trans
planted into the circulatory system of a two and a
half year-old male dog named "Butch."
In similar operations earlier, dogs had survived
for only seven and a half hoursâ€”Butch remained
alive for eight days, then was put to death when
an internal infection was discovered.
Surgeons Doubtful
The surgeons, Dr. Norman Shumway and Dr.
Richard Lower, refuse to place too much faith
in their successful operation. They point out that
the same operation with only minor differences
was performed on five dogs before Butch but
that those animals died within a few hours.
The operation involves so many different vari
ables, the surgeons said, that they can't be abso
lutely sure why this operation was successful.
Only additional research will prove the technique.
The two major types of surgical research in
this area differ in that the heart pumps blood in
one but only receives nourishment from the
animal in the other.
Working Heart
Shumway and Lower transplanted the heart
as a working heart. The technique used differed
from previously reported techniques in that a
portion of the heart, including pnrts of the walls

of both atria and part of the atrial septum, were j
left in place in the receiving animal.
These portions of the heart receive all veins
leading to that organ. The technique eliminated
the need for sewing up the veins leading to the
heart, leaving only heart tissue and arteries to
be sewn.
"We have shown this procedure can be done
technically," Dr. Lower said, but ho pointed out
that technical accomplishment of the transplant
is only one of the three major obstacles lo success
ful organ transplantation.
Other Problems
Two other problems remaining to be solved
are how to store living organs so they are avail
able when needed by patients, and how to over
come the immunological reaction to foreign tissue
which causes the receiving animal's body to
eventually reject the donor tissue.
Butch lived until 2:25 p.m. Deo. 31, when he
was put to sleep by the surgeons, lie had do-1
veloped an internal inleelion which was expected
to kill him within a few days.
The heart was removed so lhat microscopic I
studies on the heart tissue could be made before
the infection obscured the real condition of the |
heart.
Shortly before Ihe dog died an electrocardio- j
gram showed thai he had an almost normal
heartbeat. Pleased with the results, l>r. Shumway
said, "I expect this experiment to be Ihe beginning
of a very fruitful study." I
