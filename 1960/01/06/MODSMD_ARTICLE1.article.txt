# Policy Institute Set Next Week
## 
### 
The third annual Foreign Policy Institute will begin one week
from today with a keynote address by Averell Harriman, former
governor of New York and ambassador to .Russia from 1943 to 1946.
Harriman v/ill give two speeches during the course of the Insti
tute, one Wednesday night and one Thursday afternoon. He will

discuss U.S. foreign policy in the
postwar years and give an evalua
tion of its effectiveness and faults,
particularly in regard to Russia
and the significance of the eco
nomic and political life of Russia
on U.S. policy.
In addition to the talks, there j
will be eight student discussion
groups led by Stanford professors 1
and student rapporteurs after
Harriman's speech- Wednesday.
These groups will review the is- j
sues which were brought up in '
the keynote address and discuss
the proposals which lie presents.
Signups
Signups for the seminars will
begin tomorrow at Engineering j
Corner and continue through I
Tuesday. Craig Murray, Institute
director, has urged students to
sign the lists as soon as possible'
in order to get in the group of
their choice since each group is j
limited to 15.
Many consul generals repre j
senting foreign countries at San
Francisco have been invited and
are expected to attend. They will
also sit in the seminars and con
tribute to the discussion.
'Cain Insight'
Murry, evaluating the work of
the Institute, said, "While it is
not anticipated that the Institute
will transform students into au
thorities on international affairs,
it is expected that by critical ex- j
amination of the ideas presented
by renowned experts in the field,
the students will gain insight into
international problems.
Beyond this it is hoped that the
members of this audience who do |
,
not subscribe to the Marxian view |
that all history is the product ol
blind economic and social forces i
will increase their desire to con
tinue to devote part of their time
to reading and learning about the i
domestic and international chal
lenges to this country's future.
Thus, they may add to an in
creasing volume of vocal and en
lightened public opinion upon
which the predicates of demo
cratic systems ultimately depend."
