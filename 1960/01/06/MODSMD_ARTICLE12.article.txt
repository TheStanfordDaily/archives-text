# Study, Freedom Center in 'Casbah'

"With the foundation of the
Center, Stanford has become a
I part of the biggest area for be
havioral science in the world,"
said Executive Head of the Psy
chology Department Dr. Robert
R. Sears in describing the import
ance the Center for Advanced
! Study in the Behavioral Sciences
j holds for Stanford.
"What does it mean to us? It
, means everything! Palo Alto is
now the focal point for all excite
-1 ment in the field," continued Dr.
Sears, who is also a member of
the Board of Directors of the
Center.

Each year a new group of 55
| scholars comes to the oak-shaded
modern redwood-and-glass build
ings sprawled on the Palo Alto
foothills behind the campus. They
come to enjoy the isolation, to re
lax in the sunshine, and to think.
In the five years since it was
founded by a Ford Foundation
! grant, 233 fellows have come to
the Center, initially-named the
Casbah. Fellows have come from
all over the world, representing
">2 institutions and II foreign
J countries.

Director Ralph Tyler, former!
dean of social sciences at the Uni
versity of Chicago, has 11 fellows
at Casbah this year. Studying!
there is former president of Smith
College. Political Scientist Ben j
jamin Wright. Allison Davjs, a
distinguished Negro education
professor, comes from the Uni- j
versity of Chicago.
The first Iron Curtain visitor, j
Sociologist Stefan Nowakowski
will come from the University of
Warsaw. Also at Casbah now is I
Takdir Alispahbana, philosopher
of culture at Indonesia's National
University, a gentle little man
"wandering up and down the uni- 1
verse, shopping for what he can
take home."
This year's scholars, also includ
ing three psychiatrists and two
law specialists, hail from univer
sities ranging from Harvard and:
Texas to Oxford and Amsterdam.
Kxclinngc of Ideas
The fellows take a year off from
their universities and come to
spend a year, at their regular
salaries, interchanging ideas, par
ticipating in a high level of in
formal interaction and meditating
in private studies. They do re
search and write or just talk and
think. •

"Here I need no library," said
Harvard Linguist Roman Jakob
son, "If I have a question in psy
chology, anthropology, sociology,
economics, literature, 1 just go
down a few doors and knock,
'May I come in?'"
When the Ford Foundation of
ferred the grant to build Casbah
in 1953, behavioral scientists were
asked three questions to deter
mine their opinion on the location
of the proposed Center: 1. Where
would you like to go? 2. Where
would your colleagues like to go?
3. Why?
Library facilities had to be
available and the choices included
such possibilities as Washington,
D.C. with the huge resources of
the Library of Congress. Yet the
Bay Region in California received
70'! of the votes. Why?
Freedom and Study
Because most of the scholars
lived in the East and wanted to
be as far away and free as possi
ble from their home universities.
Also the Bay Area's climate is
conducive to year-around study.
Finally if the scholars' families
were going to have to leave home
they would be excited to leave for
California.
Once the Bav Area was chosen,

Stanford offered the Foundation
the Lathrop Estate on the hills
overlooking the campus. Thus
Casbah is now a tenant on Stan
ford land and as Dr. Sears said
"Stanford now has 50 topnoteh
behavioral scientists living in the
area. Our best colleagues are right
next door."
For the University faculty this
means an opportunity to partici
pate in seminars and interchange
opinions with the top men in their
fields. Some faculty members
have also been Casbah fellows.
Graduate students have a su
perior caliber of scholars to speak
at weekly eolloquia or in some
cases to do research with. The
Casbah also supplies employment
opportunities for Stanford stu
dents who work as research as
sistants. librarians or hashers.
One fellow at the Center recalls
that his pre-Casbah world had
shriveled to six friends with the
same opinion. At his first Casbah
meal he sat next to a sociologist, a
historian and a literary critic.
"That first luncheon," he said,
"was likf* opening windows in a
stuffy room." This is the refresh
ing atmosphere of cross-fertiliza
tion to which Stanford has been
exposed,

One fellow at the Center recalls
that his pre-Casbah world had
shriveled to six friends with the
same opinion. At his first Casbah
meal he sat next to a sociologist, a
historian and a literary critic.
"That first luncheon," he said,
"was likf* opening windows in a

exposed,
"With the foundation of the
Center, Stanford has become a
I part of the biggest area for be
havioral science in the world,"
said Executive Head of the Psy
chology Department Dr. Robert
R. Sears in describing the import
ance the Center for Advanced
! Study in the Behavioral Sciences
j holds for Stanford.
"What does it mean to us? It
, means everything! Palo Alto is
now the focal point for all excite
-1 ment in the field," continued Dr.
Sears, who is also a member of
the Board of Directors of the
Center.

Each year a new group of 55
| scholars comes to the oak-shaded
modern redwood-and-glass build
ings sprawled on the Palo Alto
foothills behind the campus. They
come to enjoy the isolation, to re
lax in the sunshine, and to think.
In the five years since it was
founded by a Ford Foundation
! grant, 233 fellows have come to
the Center, initially-named the
Casbah. Fellows have come from
all over the world, representing
">2 institutions and II foreign
J countries.

Director Ralph Tyler, former!
dean of social sciences at the Uni
versity of Chicago, has 11 fellows
at Casbah this year. Studying!
there is former president of Smith
College. Political Scientist Ben j
jamin Wright. Allison Davjs, a
distinguished Negro education
professor, comes from the Uni- j
versity of Chicago.
The first Iron Curtain visitor, j
Sociologist Stefan Nowakowski
will come from the University of
Warsaw. Also at Casbah now is I
Takdir Alispahbana, philosopher
of culture at Indonesia's National
University, a gentle little man
"wandering up and down the uni- 1
verse, shopping for what he can
take home."
This year's scholars, also includ
ing three psychiatrists and two
law specialists, hail from univer
sities ranging from Harvard and:
Texas to Oxford and Amsterdam.
Kxclinngc of Ideas
The fellows take a year off from
their universities and come to
spend a year, at their regular
salaries, interchanging ideas, par
ticipating in a high level of in
formal interaction and meditating
in private studies. They do re
search and write or just talk and
think. •

"Here I need no library," said
Harvard Linguist Roman Jakob
son, "If I have a question in psy
chology, anthropology, sociology,
economics, literature, 1 just go
down a few doors and knock,
'May I come in?'"
When the Ford Foundation of
ferred the grant to build Casbah
in 1953, behavioral scientists were
asked three questions to deter
mine their opinion on the location
of the proposed Center: 1. Where
would you like to go? 2. Where
would your colleagues like to go?
3. Why?
Library facilities had to be
available and the choices included
such possibilities as Washington,
D.C. with the huge resources of
the Library of Congress. Yet the
Bay Region in California received
70'! of the votes. Why?
Freedom and Study
Because most of the scholars
lived in the East and wanted to
be as far away and free as possi
ble from their home universities.
Also the Bay Area's climate is
conducive to year-around study.
Finally if the scholars' families
were going to have to leave home
they would be excited to leave for
California.
Once the Bav Area was chosen,

Stanford offered the Foundation
the Lathrop Estate on the hills
overlooking the campus. Thus
Casbah is now a tenant on Stan
ford land and as Dr. Sears said
"Stanford now has 50 topnoteh
behavioral scientists living in the
area. Our best colleagues are right
next door."
For the University faculty this
means an opportunity to partici
pate in seminars and interchange
opinions with the top men in their
fields. Some faculty members
have also been Casbah fellows.
Graduate students have a su
perior caliber of scholars to speak

Stanford offered the Foundation
the Lathrop Estate on the hills
overlooking the campus. Thus
Casbah is now a tenant on Stan
ford land and as Dr. Sears said
"Stanford now has 50 topnoteh
behavioral scientists living in the
area. Our best colleagues are right
next door."
For the University faculty this
means an opportunity to partici
pate in seminars and interchange
opinions with the top men in their
fields. Some faculty members
have also been Casbah fellows.
Graduate students have a su
perior caliber of scholars to speak
at weekly eolloquia or in some
cases to do research with. The
Casbah also supplies employment
opportunities for Stanford stu
dents who work as research as
sistants. librarians or hashers.
One fellow at the Center recalls
that his pre-Casbah world had
shriveled to six friends with the
same opinion. At his first Casbah
meal he sat next to a sociologist, a
historian and a literary critic.
"That first luncheon," he said,
"was likf* opening windows in a
stuffy room." This is the refresh
ing atmosphere of cross-fertiliza
tion to which Stanford has been
exposed,
"With the foundation of the
Center, Stanford has become a
I part of the biggest area for be
havioral science in the world,"
said Executive Head of the Psy
chology Department Dr. Robert
R. Sears in describing the import
ance the Center for Advanced
! Study in the Behavioral Sciences
j holds for Stanford.
"What does it mean to us? It
, means everything! Palo Alto is
now the focal point for all excite
-1 ment in the field," continued Dr.
Sears, who is also a member of
the Board of Directors of the
Center.
Meditation
Each year a new group of 55
| scholars comes to the oak-shaded
modern redwood-and-glass build
ings sprawled on the Palo Alto
foothills behind the campus. They
come to enjoy the isolation, to re
lax in the sunshine, and to think.
In the five years since it was
founded by a Ford Foundation
! grant, 233 fellows have come to
the Center, initially-named the
Casbah. Fellows have come from
all over the world, representing
">2 institutions and II foreign
J countries.

Director Ralph Tyler, former!
dean of social sciences at the Uni
versity of Chicago, has 11 fellows
at Casbah this year. Studying!
there is former president of Smith
College. Political Scientist Ben j
jamin Wright. Allison Davjs, a
distinguished Negro education
professor, comes from the Uni- j
versity of Chicago.
The first Iron Curtain visitor, j
Sociologist Stefan Nowakowski
will come from the University of
Warsaw. Also at Casbah now is I
Takdir Alispahbana, philosopher
of culture at Indonesia's National
University, a gentle little man
"wandering up and down the uni- 1
verse, shopping for what he can
take home."
This year's scholars, also includ
ing three psychiatrists and two
law specialists, hail from univer
sities ranging from Harvard and:
Texas to Oxford and Amsterdam.
Kxclinngc of Ideas
The fellows take a year off from
their universities and come to
spend a year, at their regular
salaries, interchanging ideas, par
ticipating in a high level of in
formal interaction and meditating
in private studies. They do re
search and write or just talk and
think. •

"Here I need no library," said
Harvard Linguist Roman Jakob
son, "If I have a question in psy
chology, anthropology, sociology,
economics, literature, 1 just go
down a few doors and knock,
'May I come in?'"
When the Ford Foundation of
ferred the grant to build Casbah
in 1953, behavioral scientists were
asked three questions to deter
mine their opinion on the location
of the proposed Center: 1. Where
would you like to go? 2. Where
would your colleagues like to go?
3. Why?
Library facilities had to be
available and the choices included
such possibilities as Washington,
D.C. with the huge resources of
the Library of Congress. Yet the
Bay Region in California received
70'! of the votes. Why?
Freedom and Study
Because most of the scholars
lived in the East and wanted to
be as far away and free as possi
ble from their home universities.
Also the Bay Area's climate is
conducive to year-around study.
Finally if the scholars' families
were going to have to leave home
they would be excited to leave for
California.
