# New Session Of Congress Begins Today
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/I s ) —Congress tood the mark yesterday, set to
take off into an election-year session of politicking, legislating and
investigating.
The second session of the 86th Congress will get under way offi
cially at noon today with preliminary ceremonies in the Senate

and House.
The business of the year will
start on Thursday when President
Eisenhower goes before a joint
session and delivers his annual
State of the Union message. At
that time, Eisenhower will out
line what he would like the Demo
cratic-controlled Congress to do
in the last year of his two terms.
Eisenhower will send up his an
nual budget message on Jan. 18
and his economic report two days
after that.
Since there are no organizing
problems to be handled, the flow
of legislation to the Senate and
House likely will begin shortly
after these three messages are
out of the way.
Facing both houses early in the
year is a battle over civil rights
proposals — a battle that could
split the Democratic party and
incluence significantly the Demo
crats' chances of putting their
man in the White House.
The annual battle of the budget,
foreign aid, defense policy, aid to
education, help for economically
depressed regions—all these and
more lie ahead of Congres before
its hoped-for adjournment ahead
of the national nominating con
ventions next July.
When the new members are
seated, the Democrates will out
number the Republicans in the
House 281-153, with three vacan
cies, and in the Senate 65-35.
Laying the groundwork for the
session, Senate Republicans have
arranged a conference this after
noon.
