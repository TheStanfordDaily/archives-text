## 
### 
The Math 10 grade curve was
raised by four area high school
students who earned two A's and
two B's in a fall quarter experi
ment directed by Professor
George Forsythe.
The students, Ned Allen and
Gibbs Kinderman from Palo Alto
High School and Charles Stanton
and David Stroud from Cubberley
High School, took time off from
their regular work to attend
three classes a week at the Uni
versity.
High school assignments missed
had to be made up. "What's more,
the two A students led their class
through most of the quarter,"
said Forsythe. Two hundred sixty
Stanford students took the course.
If students and parents are still
willing, the experiment will prob
ably continue through the rest of
the school year, Professor For
sythe said.
Forsythe has applied for out
side financial support to expand
the program with more high
school students.
