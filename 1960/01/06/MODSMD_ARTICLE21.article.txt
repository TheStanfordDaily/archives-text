# Finances Top Problem Facing Schools in 1960

### G.K. Hodenfield, AP Education Writer 
1959 was a record year in higher education—
but the records are both good and bad.
Enrollments in public colleges anil universi
ties are at an all-time peak. So is the shortage of
classrooms and student housing.
There is more basic research, but an ever-grow
ing shortage of laboratories and equipment.
There is more emphasis on gifted students, but
more worry about poorly prepared high school
graduates.
There is increased attention to nuclear
science, hut the schools are waging a losing
battle to find and keep qualified faculty mem
bers.
There is bold new experimentation in programs
and teaching methods, but thosuands of qualified
students were turned away for lack of space,
facilities and teachers.
This picture of higher education's problems
and progress is drawn from a survey made by a
joint office representing the American Association
of Land Grant Colleges and State Universities, and
the State University Association. Sixty of the 93
member institutions replied to a questionnaire.
Over all, the (50 schools report an enrollment
increase of nearly five per cent over last year.
All expect the trend to continue, with the biggest
crush si ill four to five years away.
They report that at least 24,000 qualified stu
dents were denied admission. This, however, is a
tricky statistic.
There is bound to be considerable overlap. The
same students m;iy have applied at four schools
and been turned down at three of them. He would
have been counted three times as a qualified stu
dent turned away, although he is happily enrolled
in the fourth school.
Another complicating factor is that 18 of the
60 schools report they raised their admission
standards this year. Thousands of high school
graduates who might have been qualified appli
cants in 1948-49 thus were not qualified for
1959-60.

Thirty of the 60 schools increased their annual
fees and tuition. The average jump was from $211
to $229 for in-state students, and from $475 to $504
for out-of-state students. That represents an in
crease of about 8 per cent for residents, 8.7 per
cent for nonresidents.
Board and room charges were held pretty
close to last year's level, and average $547 a year.
Oniy 15 of the 60 schools reported increases, and
these were only about $59 a year.
Most schools report the increased tees had
little, if any, effect on the student body this year.
But they warn there will be trouble ahead if
costs continue to rise.
Fifty-two of the 60 schools are making special
academic provisions for superior students. The
most frequently cited programs are honors
courses, special seminars, advancement placement
—for freshmen who have taken college-level work
in high school and the waiver of certain required
courses after an examination.
At the other end of the academic scale, a num
ber of the reporting schools list inadequately pre
pared high school graduates as the source of some
of their thorniest problems.
The University of Wyoming puts it this way:
"Under our policy of admitting all graduates of
accredited Wyoming high schools, there will con
tinue to he a problem concerning the failure of
many students to do college work of acceptable
quality."
Far and away the most pressing problem fac
ing the colleges and universities is the general
question of adequate financing. Virtually every
responding school mentions low faculty salaries, a
lack of academic staff and facilities, and shortages
of housing, classrooms, laboratories and lab equip
ment.
On the brighter side, the public colleges and
universities are rapidly expanding their programs
of basic research, moving into the fields of nuclear
science and revamping their study programs to
meet the changed conditions of an ever-changing
world.
