"1959 was a record year in higher education,'" according; to
the summary of a national survey which appears above. Though
the study contains a bias by virtue of its being compiled onl\
from state colleges and universities, Stanford, a private institu
tion, still fits the general pattern of education progress and
problems in 11 it* year just completed.
Enrollment here hit a new peak in the fall, though our rate
of increase over the long haul is not as steep as that of state
institutions, particularly those in the west. Stanford, too, faces
classroom shortages. Students in certain English and political
science courses who have to explore their way to Schultz And
for classes can attest to this. Here, however, the continuing re
modeling of sections of the quad has provided improved and
greater class space. Freshmen who spent fall quarter in the
\ ill age know there is a housing shortage.
Stanford, too, reflects the general pattern of more emphasis
on gifted students. A gradual increase in departmental honors
programs and new steps in advanced placement for freshmen
stand out here. Stanford, however, does not appear to be forced
to share in increasing worry about poorly prepared high school
graduates.
Being a private institution, Stanford can set its own admis
sion standards and can be just as arbitrary as it pleases. With
Stanford skimming an ever-finer group off the lop of the ex
panding high school crop, there appears no danger of its getting
poorly-prepared students.
Stanford, perhaps even more than the state institutions, is
turning away more and more qualified candidates. Numbers of
high school graduates in California are skyrocketing far faster
than Stanford's slowly-rising enrollment, so of course more and
more good candidates are being turned down. Though this means
higher and higher quality in each succeeding class, it also poses
new problems for admissions officers, who must set the standards
(or choosing the best from among a highly competitive group
seeking admission.
Tuition and fees at Stanford naturally are higher than at the
state schools, though both are rising. At both levels, expanding
loan and aid programs are being used to help students on tight
budgets meet the pinch of higher costs.
If students think they have financial woes, however, their's
are small in magnitude compared to those of the institutions.
\\ hen it is seen how state schools are being caught without ade
quate financing, one can see the additional problem faced by
Stanford and other private schools, which cannot tap the public's
tax pocketbook.
A recent projective study indicates that Stanford will need
\ast sums of new money to operate successfully over the next
decade. Where this is going to come from constitutes probably
the biggest question Stanford faces at the start of 1960. From all
indications, its a question virtually every other college arid uni
versity must face--and answer —as well.

classroom shortages. Students in certain English and political
science courses who have to explore their way to Schultz And
for classes can attest to this. Here, however, the continuing re
modeling of sections of the quad has provided improved and
greater class space. Freshmen who spent fall quarter in the
\ ill age know there is a housing shortage.
Stanford, too, reflects the general pattern of more emphasis
on gifted students. A gradual increase in departmental honors
programs and new steps in advanced placement for freshmen
stand out here. Stanford, however, does not appear to be forced
to share in increasing worry about poorly prepared high school
graduates.
Being a private institution, Stanford can set its own admis
sion standards and can be just as arbitrary as it pleases. With
Stanford skimming an ever-finer group off the lop of the ex
panding high school crop, there appears no danger of its getting
poorly-prepared students.
Stanford, perhaps even more than the state institutions, is
turning away more and more qualified candidates. Numbers of
high school graduates in California are skyrocketing far faster
than Stanford's slowly-rising enrollment, so of course more and
more good candidates are being turned down. Though this means
higher and higher quality in each succeeding class, it also poses
new problems for admissions officers, who must set the standards
(or choosing the best from among a highly competitive group
seeking admission.
Tuition and fees at Stanford naturally are higher than at the
state schools, though both are rising. At both levels, expanding
loan and aid programs are being used to help students on tight
budgets meet the pinch of higher costs.
If students think they have financial woes, however, their's
are small in magnitude compared to those of the institutions.
\\ hen it is seen how state schools are being caught without ade
quate financing, one can see the additional problem faced by
Stanford and other private schools, which cannot tap the public's
tax pocketbook.
A recent projective study indicates that Stanford will need
\ast sums of new money to operate successfully over the next
decade. Where this is going to come from constitutes probably
the biggest question Stanford faces at the start of 1960. From all
indications, its a question virtually every other college arid uni
versity must face--and answer —as well.
"1959 was a record year in higher education,'" according; to
the summary of a national survey which appears above. Though
the study contains a bias by virtue of its being compiled onl\
from state colleges and universities, Stanford, a private institu
