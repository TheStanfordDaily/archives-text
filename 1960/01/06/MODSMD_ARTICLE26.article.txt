### Mary Lou McKinley 
Fall quarter, 1959. We dined at
the "Hit/ Old Poodle Dog," wildly
applauded Eva LeGallienne and
Signe Hasso in "Mary Stuart,"
visited the Lyonel Feninger Me
morial Exhibition at the Museum
of Art and saw the Actors' Work
shop production of "Epitaph l'or
George Dillon."
Vincent Price gave a mem
orable lecture in Memorial
Auditorium, Sean O'Casey's
boyhood was depicted by the
Stanford Players, Gaieties had
its face lifted and Kartozian
was an ideal.
Number one on last quarter's
entcrtainmoni calendar, however,
was ihe supurb production of
"The Visit." Alfred Lunt and
Lynn Fontanne gave electrifying
performances in the tense drama
which told how a small, poverty
stricken town falls prey to a
wealthy woman's proposition for 1
the life of its most respected citi
zen. Terrifying wilh macabre
overtones of humor, the show was
outstanding in every respect.
What's ahead for entertain
ment-seeking students in the
early weeks of the now decade?
For a royal start, the Actors'
Workshop will bring its San
Francisco production of John
to Memorial Auditorium to
night at 8:30. Student tickets
for the single performance are
priced at $1.75, on sale at DA
30665.
Another on-campus event is
scheduled for Sunday in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium where the New
York Pro Musica will present a
special concert. Admission is $2
for students, on sale at Dinkel
spiel Box Office.
Tonight at the Symphony,
French pianist Philippe Entre
mont will make his first appear
ance with the orchestra in a per
formance of Andre Jolivet's Con
certo for Piano and Orchestra.
The outstanding 25-year-old pian
ist premiered the Jolivet Con
certo in January of 1953 at New
York's Carnegie Hall and is cur
rently making his sixth tour of
this continent.
Entremont also will play
Franek's Symphonic Variations
for Piano and Orchestra.
Brahms' Academic Festival
Overture will open the pro
gram, which will conclude with
Tscbaikowsky's Symphony No.
2 in (' Minor.
Continuing through Saturday
at the Geary Theater in San Fran
cisco, "The Dark at the Top of
the Stairs" stars Joan Blondell.
Written by William Inge, the play
is peopled with warm and humor
ous characters and tells the story
of the Flood family and the dra
matic events which result from
the daughter's first party.

Especially notable in the cast is
Peggy Richards whose charac
terization adds considerably to
the merit of the play. Directed
by Elia Kazan, the drama begins
at 8:30 p.m. with 2:30 matinees
today and Saturday.
Fred Waring's "Stereo Fes
tival" will be presented at the
San Francisco Opera House
Saturday at 8:30 p.m. An en
tirely new musical variety show
featuring the Pennsylvanians,
the program will be highlighted
by special electronic effects
invented by Waring. The show
also will be given at the San
Jose Civic Auditorium Monday
at 8:30 p.m.
For after-theater entertain
ment, the Hungry i is currently
featuring The I.imeliters, sensa
tional folk-singing trio which lit
erally stole the show from the
headlined act at the Hungry i
last month. The group's reper
toire consists mainly of tradi
tional folk-songs presented in
new, remarkable ways. Comedian
Mickey Dean likewise has a good
act on the same program> It's a
sure bet for an enjoyable evening
with continuous shows from
9 a.m.
The spectacular to end all spec
taculars, "Ben Hur" is playing at
the Coronet in San Francisco.
Lasting a good three and a half
hours, the film spectacle had its
beginnings in 1880 when General
Lew Wallace completed his novel
and had it published.
Although almost too much of
a pageant with too much
"greatness," the acting is good,
the photography magnificent
ami the chariot race alone, re
markable, resulting in a not
able movie for Hollywood his
tory.
Currently playing at the Guild
theater in Menlo Park, "The
Horse's Mouth" starring the in
comparable Alec Guiness is one
you shouldn't miss. The story of
an artist who continually is
searching for his wall to paint,
the film is both touching and
amusing, including some very
hilarious scenes. Thoroughly en
joyable, the movie begins at
8 p.m. with previews, etc., at
about 7:30.

For after-theater entertain
ment, the Hungry i is currently
featuring The I.imeliters, sensa
tional folk-singing trio which lit

taculars, "Ben Hur" is playing at
the Coronet in San Francisco.
Lasting a good three and a half
hours, the film spectacle had its
beginnings in 1880 when General
Lew Wallace completed his novel
and had it published.
Although almost too much of
a pageant with too much
"greatness," the acting is good,
the photography magnificent
ami the chariot race alone, re
markable, resulting in a not
able movie for Hollywood his
tory.
Currently playing at the Guild
theater in Menlo Park, "The
Horse's Mouth" starring the in
comparable Alec Guiness is one
you shouldn't miss. The story of
an artist who continually is
searching for his wall to paint,
the film is both touching and
amusing, including some very
hilarious scenes. Thoroughly en
joyable, the movie begins at
8 p.m. with previews, etc., at
about 7:30.

performances in the tense drama
which told how a small, poverty
stricken town falls prey to a
wealthy woman's proposition for 1
the life of its most respected citi
zen. Terrifying wilh macabre
overtones of humor, the show was
outstanding in every respect.
