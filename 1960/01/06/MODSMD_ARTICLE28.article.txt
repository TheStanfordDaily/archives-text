Kditor, The Daily:
There is something admirable
about l he bourgeoisie, or, at least,
certain of them. It is their in
dependence. Having few needs,
they possess a confidence that is
attractive. . .
Many radicals despise ihe bour
geoisie for ihe very mannerisms
that I and most people find attrac
tive. They interpret these man
nerisms as betraying an attitude
of detachment, an attitude obliv
ious to the suffering of ihe masses
of the world's people.
But it is unjust to condemn
the bourgeoisie as a class for this,
for they are no more and prob
ably less oblivious lo the suffer
ing of the masses than the masses
are to the suffering of each other.
My conclusion is not that the
present state of human life should
continue. We must hate the poor
so much that poverty will he
abolished we could do it ii we
really wanted to, you know.
Among the poor, I number not
only those who are actually poor,
but also those who are made to
act as if they were poor by adver
tising that distorts the nature and
extent of human needs. Everyone
could have the security and free
dom of action that are now re
served for a few.
Howard Richards
P.S. "Of all things save the
doings of the heatl of a generous,
unpossessing. free heart, ample to
its own inclinations and needless
of every other, when a life is at an

end, o, of all things, save this
alone, what remains?" From
I'iM'iiiscapes, by Kenneth Patehen.
