### Steve Baffrey 
Coach Pete Newell's thunder
ing herd of highly-polished Gold
en Bears come to town Saturday
for Stanford's first home AAWU
basketball tussle, li gets under
way in the Pavilion at 8 p.m.
The Bears, twiee-prove NCAA
champions, bring a 112 1 a s h y ,
scrappy attack tested to wear
down almost any opposition.
Coach Howie Dallmar's Indians
will have to be bettor than their
best-to-date in order to come away
the winners.
Cal W on Title
Last March Cal downed West
Virginia's Mountaineers, with All
- Jerry West, by a single
point in the NCAA playoff in
Louisville. Last month the two
clubs met in the final round of the
Los Angeles Basket ball Classic
and the Bears pranced away 20-
point winners at 65- 15.
Cal looked unbeatable in the
victory. And in a second round
game against Southern .California
the day before, the Bears bounded
out of a 13-point hole to tie the
Trojans at game's end and go on
to take a 615-61 overtime win.
Riding on the strength of the
double win over the Mountain
eers, and backed up by the equally
impressive victory over strong SC,
the Bears can legitimately lay
claim to the title of the nation's
leading ball club. And their court
performances back up the claim.
The only mar on the face of
the Cal record is its AAWU-open
ing-game loss to t he same Trojans
it had spectacularly beaten. That
happened last Saturday night 65- 1
57. It was the end of a 25-game
winning streak for the Gold and!
Blue.
Imhoff Kates High
A big, 6-K) blond center by the I
name of Darrall Imhoff leads the
Cal attack, and his playing alone
is almost worth the price of ad
mission. Imhoff, an All-American
last season, was a unanimous
choice of sportswrilers and broad
casters for the "Player of the
Classic" title.
Imhoff is not always a high
in the scoring column when it
counts, and usually manages to |
be around the backboards all the
time.
But the big center is not the
only focus on the Cal club.

i Dangerously enough, there are
four more.
One of these is a good jump
scorer, but the big man turns up
i shot named Tandy Gillis. The 6-6
j forward is a real clutch player
j and does a fine job of handling
| the opposition. He held the Moun
taineers' West to a low X point
1 game.
Seliiiltz Good
Another Cal standout is a 6-4
junior guard, Earl Schultz. He
I is a real ball-hawk, and a real
i operator once he's got the ball.
Schultz maneuvers well, shoots
well, and draws fouls like Dick
Tracy characters draw flies.
A 23-point effort against West
I Virginia was enough to put 6-4
forward Bill McClintock on the
I list of those who'll have to be
j reckoned with. McClintock, a
great rebounder and follow-shot
| artist, took 21 balls off the boards
j against the Mountainers.
Guard Bog Wendell and for
wards Stan Morrison and Dave
Stafford also help in the Gold and
Blue attack, but then everybody
on the squad seems to pitch in
to help.
In dropping its game to SC. Cal
disclosed a deficiency at the free
throw line. This is about the only
loose screw in the Cal attack, for
everything else the club does
seems to be done to perfection.
Cal defends like real misers,
fast-breaks with the fastest, and
shoots with the ease and accuracy
of a club enjoying a pre-game
warm-up.
