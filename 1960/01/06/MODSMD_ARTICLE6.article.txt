### 
Off campus residents commuting to campus yes
terday morning were jolted into unusual states
of alertness when they found IS choice parking
places near the Physics Lecture Hall roped off
so that corp yard employees could remove a dead

eucalyptus tree. In general, however, the drivers
we.-e still vacation-happy and even managed io
smile at the grim humor of it all as they parked
their vehicles in far distant places. It's about
that timing, fellas.
