A colicge professor warns:
College cheating is
an American disgrace!
Why is cheating an accepted practice
in many of our colleges today? What
can we do to stop this scandalous
habit? In this week's Saturday Eve
ning Post, a college professor reports:
• about the ingenious ways students
cheat.
• how one college official admits
"1 out of 3 students cheats rather
regularly."
• why many professors know what's
going on—but do nothing to stop it.
Be sure to read the explosive re
port on our "American Disgrace:
College Cheating''—in this week's
Post.
