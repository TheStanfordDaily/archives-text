# Ford Foundation Sponsors Teacher Internship Program
## 
### Anne Cowen 
College graduates who have
taken no previous work in educa
tion can become qualified high
school and junior college teachers
through a 15-month program now
offered by the School of Educa
tion in cooperation with the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
The program is part of t he
Secondary Education Project, sup
ported by Ford Foundation's Fund
| for the Advancement of Educa
tion. Selected area high schools
and junior colleges are eooperat-
I ing in the plan, which is in the
j first of a five-year trial period at
: the University.
The 15-month plan involves
: two summer quarters of full-time
! University attendence, and an in
i tervening academic year of intern
ship teaching in public secondary
i schools.
| During I lie academic year, the

intern teaches three classes in his
major field, for which he is paid
between $2500 and $3000. Weekly
three-hour professional seminars
supplement close supervision of
interns by the School of Educa
tion, by advisers in the intern's
major field, and by the local
school board.
The completed program is
worth 50 quarter hours of grad
uate credit, and in most cases
fulfills the requirements for a
California General Secondary
Teaching Credential and a master
or arts degree.
Trainees are responsible for
regular University tuition for
each summer quarter, and pay
$146 per quarter during the reg
ular school year.
The program is open to those
who have been away from college
for many years, as well as to
recent graduates. "In this way we
hope to tap new sources of po
tential teachers," stated Dr. 11. N.

Bush, professor of education and
director of the secondary educa
tion project.
"The program differs from the
regular course in placing a great
er degree of emphasis on tho sub
ject matter the teacher is to
teach," Dr. Bush noted.
"The intern is exposed to prac
tical leaching under supervision
for a longer period of lime, and
the program helps him to relate
teaching theory and practice more
clearly."
The current group has 25 mem
bers. Next year, Dr. Bush stated,
il will be expanded to 10-1"). By the
fourth year this program is ex
pected to match the older one in
size, with 65-70 participants.
Applications for the program
beginning next summer will be
accepted until Feb. 15. Applica
tions and further information are
available at the Secondary Educa
tion Project Office, Room 38,
