# Civil Rights Fight Looms In Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/I 3 ) — The Ei
senhower administration was re
ported yesterday as looking with
disfavor on a proposal to use fed
eral voting registrars as a means
of overcoming discrimination
against Negroes.
Sources within the executive
department said key administra
tion officials had decided against
backing this highly controversial
recommendation of the Civil
Rights Commission.
Waving a Red Flag
In line with this report, Sen.
Everett M. Dirksen (R-lll.) told
newsmen at the start of the con
gressional session he does not
think President Eisenhower will
submit any additional civil rights
measures.
Dirksen, the Senate's Republi
can leader, compared the plan for
federal voting registrars to wav
ing a red flag in the face of
Southern foes who have de
nounced it as an unconstiutional
invasion of states' rights.
Rumblings
There were advance rumblings
of a battle over civil rights legis
lation even before the legislators
had settled into their seats.
Speaker of the House Sam Ray
burn (D-Tex.) told a news con
ference a bill can bo passed by Ihe
House within two weeks if enough
members want it.
A measure embodying most but
not all of Eisenhower's civil rights
proposals last year is bottled up
in the House Rules Committee,
dominated by a coalition of South
ern Democrats and Republicans.
Raybiirn Predicts
Rayburn said the easy way to
shake this bill loose and get it to
the floor would he for a majority
of the 137 House members to sign
a petition to take it away from
the Rules Committee.
Such a discharge petition is be
fore the House but lacks the re
quired 219 signatures.
Rayburn said he was not advo
cating this course and had never
signed a discharge petition him
self. He said he was just pointing
out how a bill could be brought
up if enough members want it.
He predicted that the House will
1 pass a civil rights bill of some
kind if the issue reaches the
! floor.
Senate Showdown
The civil rights issue is closely
linked to political maneuvering
this presidential election year.
Senate majority leader Lyndon B.
Johnson, who is being pushed by
Rayburn for the Democratic pres
idential nomination, recalled that
Senate leaders had agreed last
session to take up civil rights leg
islation by Feb. 1.3.
The real showdown will take
place in the Senate, where South
erners can make use of their tra
ditional filibuster weapon under
rules requiring a two-thirds ma
jority to shut off debate.

There were advance rumblings
of a battle over civil rights legis
lation even before the legislators
had settled into their seats.
Speaker of the House Sam Ray
burn (D-Tex.) told a news con
ference a bill can bo passed by Ihe
House within two weeks if enough
members want it.
A measure embodying most but
not all of Eisenhower's civil rights
proposals last year is bottled up
in the House Rules Committee,
dominated by a coalition of South
ern Democrats and Republicans.
Raybiirn Predicts
Rayburn said the easy way to
shake this bill loose and get it to
the floor would he for a majority
of the 137 House members to sign
a petition to take it away from
the Rules Committee.
Such a discharge petition is be
fore the House but lacks the re
quired 219 signatures.
Rayburn said he was not advo
cating this course and had never
signed a discharge petition him
self. He said he was just pointing
out how a bill could be brought
up if enough members want it.
He predicted that the House will
1 pass a civil rights bill of some
kind if the issue reaches the
! floor.
Senate Showdown
The civil rights issue is closely
linked to political maneuvering

Senate majority leader Lyndon B.
Johnson, who is being pushed by
Rayburn for the Democratic pres
idential nomination, recalled that
Senate leaders had agreed last
session to take up civil rights leg
islation by Feb. 1.3.
The real showdown will take
place in the Senate, where South
erners can make use of their tra
ditional filibuster weapon under
rules requiring a two-thirds ma
jority to shut off debate.
