## ONE OPINION 
### 
To my way of thinking, I never
quite hear enough of the stories
that tell of investigations into the
strange practices that go on be
hind the very iron-ish curtain of
safety and security that safe
guard the decision makers in our
military services.
-Inst when one series of check
ups is through, and I settle back
into a "That ought to fix 'em
for a while" complacency, I
manage to hear of a tale which
makes me cringe again, and call
for another disection.
The Christmas vacation turned
up another of these, and it's a
darned good example.
A young man I know served
with the Marines for approxi
mately two years, in that time be
ing stationed in Lebanon during
the mid-East trouble and later in
South America when the pot there
began to bubble over.
Alter this hitch, with an un
settled future before him, he
enlisted in the Army where he
was eventually put in charge of
training new recruits (more
likely draftees).
This is a difficult job; he knew
it, and I'm sure the Army knew
it. In fact, being quite young and
not inclined to this position, he
requested a transfer on the
grounds of an inability to cope
with the situation.
It wasn't granted. He became
less sure of himself, less sure of
his job, and even less able to cope
with his charges as time went on.
His next transfer request even
suggested he be shifted to an air
borne group, a hell-hole assign
ment which comparatively few
people seek.
Again, though, he was told to
stay with his trainees. Not told,
but rather ordered, with of
course no alternative.
His troops weren't happy, he
wasn't happy. He wasn't inclined

to mete out punishment for in
fractions of regulations which of
ficers "know" new troops commit,
but which are never obvious or
known to anyone but these same
officers.
In time, as he almost knew it
would, a discipline problem faced
him and, as he further knew
would happen, he was unable to
cope with it. The details are in
significant and unimportant, but
the result was considerable hard
ship for his troops and himself,
and eventuated in a Co ur t s
Martial.
This young man was given
the pleasant choice of request
ing the Army's only euphonious
Undesirable Discharge (I'D), or
being given its misnomered (at
least in this case) Dishonorable
Discharge (the familiar DD).
In any event, the choice was
leaving the service he wanted
to serve in any capacity in
which he was capable.
This story strikes me as terribly
wrong somewhere. I cannot un
derstand why this young fellow
was first forced to function in a
position in which he knew himself
to be incapable and second pushed
infamously out of a service for
what, all incidents considered, was
really not his fault or his doing.
Nor can I understand why our
Army allowed new troops to be
trained and handled by someone
who was not fit to handle them.
If these practices are allowed to
go unchecked during the little
but-battening lull of peacetime,
then what can we expect to dis
cover arising out of more hectic
times of emergency when there
isn't the time to be bothered with
smaller details, of which this is
surely one.
Perhaps you don't worry about
things of this nature; they keep
me awake at night.

manage to hear of a tale which
makes me cringe again, and call
for another disection.
The Christmas vacation turned
up another of these, and it's a
darned good example.
A young man I know served
with the Marines for approxi
mately two years, in that time be
ing stationed in Lebanon during
the mid-East trouble and later in
South America when the pot there
began to bubble over.
Alter this hitch, with an un
settled future before him, he
enlisted in the Army where he
was eventually put in charge of
training new recruits (more
likely draftees).
This is a difficult job; he knew
it, and I'm sure the Army knew
it. In fact, being quite young and
not inclined to this position, he
requested a transfer on the
grounds of an inability to cope
with the situation.
It wasn't granted. He became
less sure of himself, less sure of
his job, and even less able to cope
with his charges as time went on.
His next transfer request even
suggested he be shifted to an air
borne group, a hell-hole assign
ment which comparatively few
people seek.
Again, though, he was told to
stay with his trainees. Not told,
but rather ordered, with of
course no alternative.
His troops weren't happy, he
wasn't happy. He wasn't inclined

to mete out punishment for in
fractions of regulations which of
ficers "know" new troops commit,
but which are never obvious or
known to anyone but these same
officers.
In time, as he almost knew it
would, a discipline problem faced
him and, as he further knew
would happen, he was unable to
cope with it. The details are in
significant and unimportant, but
the result was considerable hard
ship for his troops and himself,
and eventuated in a Co ur t s
Martial.
This young man was given
the pleasant choice of request
ing the Army's only euphonious
Undesirable Discharge (I'D), or
being given its misnomered (at
least in this case) Dishonorable
Discharge (the familiar DD).
In any event, the choice was
leaving the service he wanted
to serve in any capacity in
which he was capable.
This story strikes me as terribly
wrong somewhere. I cannot un
derstand why this young fellow
was first forced to function in a
position in which he knew himself
to be incapable and second pushed
infamously out of a service for
what, all incidents considered, was
really not his fault or his doing.
Nor can I understand why our
Army allowed new troops to be
trained and handled by someone
who was not fit to handle them.
If these practices are allowed to
go unchecked during the little
but-battening lull of peacetime,
then what can we expect to dis
cover arising out of more hectic
times of emergency when there
isn't the time to be bothered with
smaller details, of which this is
surely one.
Perhaps you don't worry about
things of this nature; they keep
me awake at night.
To my way of thinking, I never
quite hear enough of the stories
that tell of investigations into the
strange practices that go on be
hind the very iron-ish curtain of
safety and security that safe
guard the decision makers in our
military services.

ups is through, and I settle back
into a "That ought to fix 'em
for a while" complacency, I
