Mr. Rogers, the Allorney Gen
eral, has replied 10 questions
which Ihe President put to him
w hen the television scandals
broke out: "Whether there were
any laws violated . . . whether
we should propose any new laws."
II is a fair inference from the
general tenor of Rogers' report
that ho knows quite well that not
much can be done by way of
regulations to improve the quality
of television programs.
My own view is that it is not
possible to define in the laws and
regulations standards of quality
which can be enforced. Nor do I
think it would bo desirable or
healthy to have the regulating
commission, which is essentially a
policeman, set up shop to advise
and even control the quality of
the programs.
What then? How about rely
ing upon voluntary sell' im
provement by the networks?
There appears to he some evi
dence that they would like to do
better than they have been do
ing, and that they would like to
recover the confidence and re
spect which they have lost.
More power to them. But we
must not forget that the economic
interest of the companies, which
require bigger audiences for big
ger revenues, is against any seri
ous and lasting effort to use tele
vision for its highest possibilities.
That will not be enough. This
country needs some television at
the best hours which, like schools
and universities, like art galleries,
like the parks, like research, is
not commercial, is produced not
because it yields private profits
but because it moves towards
truth and excellence.
I say "some television." We
could not and should not have
the government run the whole
television industry. What we
need is a competitor with com
mercial television, a competitor
who has a different motive and
can have, therefore, different
standards.
The non-commercial competitor
would have to be some kind of
public corporation or authority,
chartered by law. governed like a
university by trustees, and oper
ated by professionals. llow could
it be financed?
The best discussion of this ques
tion has, I think, come from Mr.
John Fischer who has been writ
ing in "Harper's" magazine. His
thesis is that since the air waves

are public property, Ihe govern
ment should charge rentals for |
them. This is quite feasible since !
the profits are large.
Moreover, rental could be
charged not only in money
which would finance the non
commercial company but also
in the form of time set aside lor
it on the commercial networks.
There is Utile doubt that some
non-commercial television could
be financed. It would be a very
good Ihing if an appropriate com
mittee of Congress would make a
report on the economics and the
finances of the television in
dustry.

the programs.
What then? How about rely
ing upon voluntary sell' im
provement by the networks?
There appears to he some evi
dence that they would like to do
better than they have been do
ing, and that they would like to
recover the confidence and re
spect which they have lost.
More power to them. But we
must not forget that the economic
interest of the companies, which
require bigger audiences for big
ger revenues, is against any seri
ous and lasting effort to use tele
vision for its highest possibilities.
That will not be enough. This
country needs some television at
the best hours which, like schools
and universities, like art galleries,
like the parks, like research, is
not commercial, is produced not
because it yields private profits
but because it moves towards
truth and excellence.
I say "some television." We
could not and should not have
the government run the whole
television industry. What we
need is a competitor with com
mercial television, a competitor
who has a different motive and
can have, therefore, different
standards.
The non-commercial competitor
would have to be some kind of
public corporation or authority,
chartered by law. governed like a
university by trustees, and oper
ated by professionals. llow could
it be financed?
The best discussion of this ques
tion has, I think, come from Mr.
John Fischer who has been writ
ing in "Harper's" magazine. His
thesis is that since the air waves

are public property, Ihe govern
ment should charge rentals for |
them. This is quite feasible since !
the profits are large.
Moreover, rental could be
charged not only in money
which would finance the non
commercial company but also
in the form of time set aside lor
it on the commercial networks.
There is Utile doubt that some
non-commercial television could
be financed. It would be a very
good Ihing if an appropriate com
mittee of Congress would make a
report on the economics and the
finances of the television in
dustry.

Mr. Rogers, the Allorney Gen
eral, has replied 10 questions
which Ihe President put to him
w hen the television scandals
broke out: "Whether there were
any laws violated . . . whether
we should propose any new laws."
II is a fair inference from the
general tenor of Rogers' report
that ho knows quite well that not
much can be done by way of
regulations to improve the quality
of television programs.
My own view is that it is not
possible to define in the laws and
regulations standards of quality
which can be enforced. Nor do I
think it would bo desirable or
healthy to have the regulating
commission, which is essentially a
policeman, set up shop to advise
and even control the quality of
the programs.
