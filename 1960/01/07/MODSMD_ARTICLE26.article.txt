# Indian Hoopsters Hope to Show Golden Bears Not so Unbeatable

What does a flub have to do to
boat the defending NCAA basket
ball champs California's Golden
Bears?
Looking ahead toward the In
dians' Saturday night encounter
with Hie Blue and Gold, Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar feels this
way:
"Mainly, we have to minimize
our mistakes and concentrate on
playing a good ball game."
Consistency Needed
Dallmar further noted that the
Tribe will have to come up with
some sort of shooting consistency.
"This is where we've let down so
far," the mentor, said. "In the
games that we've lost, we've been
down around 25 per cent."
Defensively, the Indian coach
feels his squad is just about set.
"We'll be watching out for Im
hoff naturally, (Cal's 6-10 cen
ter Darrall Imhoff) he's a threat
any way you look at him."
It's a cinch, ami even Dallmar
feels so, thai the Indians won't
get anywhere near the Bears on
Saturday if I hey fall into one of
their frequent 7-10 minute slumps.
This is a problem that has beset
the Tribe in many of its games
this season.
Still another trouble area, and

112 one in which Dallmar "can't tell"
, what the outcome will be, is the
Tribe's performance at the fret
, throw line. "We expect," Dallmar
says, "that we will improve in
this department as we eo along.''
• j Oregon Game
I In the Cards' most recent
; i games, Dallmar reports thai the
Indian loss to Oregon came as the
« result of a 23 per cent shooting
i mark and the loss of three men on
fouls.
) While snapping Oregon State's
, ! 9-game winning streak Monday
1 night, the club looked "real good,
offensively and off the boards."
, Just what will happen when
„ the so-so Indians meet the top-of
, Ihe-heap Bears on Saturday is a
real puzzlement, but the odds
makers aren't going for the Red
and White, that's for sure.
The season's schedules have
i pitied the clubs against three mu
tual opponents. San Jose State,
ihe University of San Francisco
1 Dons, and West Virginia.
Both San Jose and San Fran
cisco went down in defeat before
the Blue and Gold and Red and
While clubs. Cal lopped the Spar
tans 51-13 while Stanford clob
bered the fellow peninsulars
69-31.
Reversal
Against ITSF the story was re
versed. Cal breezed home a 20-
poini-plus winner while the Cards
went into overtime lo grab a 55-10
> decision.
In the recent L. A. Classic, both
' squads met the West Virginia
Mountaineers. Here Cal was an
other 20-poinl winner, 65-45, while
Stanford, after playing even ball
in the first half, lost out 66-47.
Neither side report's any serious
injuries for the Saturday tussle
(Cal meets UCLA in Berkeley on
Friday; the Indians are idle).
