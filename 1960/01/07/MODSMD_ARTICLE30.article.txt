# STANFORD POSTMEN
## Center Windsor Holds Card Key 
### 
One of the keys to the success
of this year's Stanford basketball
team is how successful sopho
more John Windsor fairs at the
center position. Windsor, a 6-8
native of Kansas City, Missouri,
was the leading scorer on last
year's Stanford freshman team.
llp carno to Stanford as one of
the most promising basketball
players in the nation, and in one
season and a half at Stanford
Windsor has shown signs of liv
ing up to his highly regarded po
tential.
In last Monday's surprise vic
tory over Oregon State, Windsor
played an important rolo throw
ing in five straight points late
in thp gamp to ice the Stanford
victory.
Very Mobile
Windsor is very mobile for a
man his size and drives pxtremely
well. Hp's doubly dangprous,
though, bpcausp of his well de
veloped shooting eyp that makps
him a thrpat from any spot on the
court. So far this year sophomore
inexperience has hindered him
some in court action.
Backing up Windsor at thp cen
tpr post this ypar are sonior Neal
Brockmpypr, and sophomorps Bob
Whelan and Mike Ledgprwood.
Brockmeyer at G-S is the samp
height as Windsor. Brockmeyer
is a real veteran having seen serv
ice with the varsity for the last
threp years. A left handed shooter
"Big Brock" has come up with a
badly needed hook shot this sea
son that might enhance his scor
ing ability. Brockmeyer hails
from La Canada.
Tallest Man
Boli Whelan at 6-9 is t hp team's
tallest player. Whelan was one
of the sparks on the freshman
team two year's ago. Last year
he did not play basketball and

therefore has two years left after]
this season.
If Whelan could put: on a little
more heft in the next two years
he could develop into a tough
boardman. Whelan's homo is Le-
Mars, lowa.
Mike Ledgerwood has shown
as much improvement as any
member of this year's basketball
team. Ledgerwood with his solid
6-7 height gives Stanford a strong
rebounder in reserve. Ledgerwood
has developed a scintillating hook
shot which he can throw from
spots where others shoot set
shots.
