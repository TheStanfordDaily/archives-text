# Fraternity Burglarized
## 
### 
A whistling burglar stole $130
from six Phi Sigma Kappa stu
dents before he was surprised b.\
a seventh and forced to floe aboul
3:30 a.m. yesterday.
Robert Swinth, a graduate stu
dent who lives at the house,
awoke to find someone shining a
flashlight in his face. Seeing
that Swinth was awake, the in
truder turned and calmly walked
out of the room and down the
hall, whistling as he left.
Swinth reported to Stanford
police that he got up and searched
for the burglar but could not
find him in the house. As he re
turned to his room, Swinth said,
he heard a car start and through
the window he saw a light colored
car, possibly a Plymouth, speed
away.
Six students reported losses:
Jerry Matthews, $28; Jim Col
leran, $15; James Sweet, $15;
Nicolas Nelson, $18; Robert
Sehulz, $2; Alan Rubendall, $22.
Police Chief Gordon Davis
alerted all fraternity houses to be
on the lookout for night intruders.
