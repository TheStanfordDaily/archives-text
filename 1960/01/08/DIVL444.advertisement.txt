ADVANCED GUIDANCE SYSTEMS DESlGN—Analysis and synrhesiL v\ uuvunceo guajn<-e systems for air
craft, ballistic missiles and space vehicles. Analysis and simulation of space navigation, space kine
matics and trajectories. ELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEM DESIGN AND APPLICATION —Analysis and design
of ultra-precision electromechanical and electro-optical systems. Specific experience in the design and
testing of guidance systems sensors such as gyros, accelerometers, and star trackers is desired. TRAN
SISTOR CIRCUIT DESIGN AND APPLICATION-Analysis and design of transistorized analog and digital
circuits and systems for application in inertial guidance systems. Excellent opportunities exist for engi
neers experienced in the design and application of transistor electronics to apply their knowledge to
the design of advanced guidance systems. SYSTEMS ENGINEERS —Analysis and mechanization of advanced
guidance systems for satellite stabilization, space guidance, and ballistic missile applications. Experi
