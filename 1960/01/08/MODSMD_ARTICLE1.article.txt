Eighteen bowling lanes with automatic pin sctters will be among
the facilities included in Stanford's proposed Tresidder Memorial
Union Building. This was just one of many pertinent facts about
Ihe union thai Chester A. Berry told his freshman audience in a
talk at Wilbur Hall Wednesday night.
Berry, the national president of student unions, is tlie director

of the top-priority project to give
Stanford an efficient union.
According to Berry, facilities
to be included were chosen
through the results of a student
.survey. An informal restaurant,
large meeting room, stage area,
game room, music room and a
library are but a few of the many
facilities planned.
The building would be used
mainly by student groups includ
ing clubs, living groups, service
organizations, and social groups
for activities ranging from in
formal talks to dances.
Campus Center
Berry described the union as
the future center of the campusâ€”
an organization which would
draw the students together. "Al
though the building itself is an
important part of the union,"
Berry remarked, "it is actually
only the tool to be used by an
association of students."
The building will be located be
tween Dinkelspiel Auditorium
and Bowman Alumni House. The
master plan calls for a complete
remodeling of the campus be
tween Bowman and Cubberley
Auditorium. The old book store,
the post office, and a few old
houses on Escondido Road are to
be razed; Escondido Road would
be blocked off at Cubberley Audi
torium; Santa Terresa Street
would be blocked off at the Shell
service station. The land between
these two points, must of which is
now Lasuen Street would be land
scaped and used as a plaza for the
campus center.
New Library
Long range plans call for the
construction of a new library be
hind Cubberley Auditorium and
connected to the old library. It
would contain a smaller number
of books and a larger studying
area for the use of undergrad
uates only. The old library would
be used by graduate students.
The Union building will house
the offices of the ASSU.
Berry's talk was sponsored by
Cedro House, Wilbur.
