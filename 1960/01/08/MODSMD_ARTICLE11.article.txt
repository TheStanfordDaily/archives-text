# Eisenhower Sees Prosperity Ahead
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — President Eisenhower yesterday forcast unmatched prosperity for the
United States, a debt-cutting surplus J'or its government and—if the Soviet Union cooperates—peace
with justice for all the world.
In a confidently optimist State of the Union message, Eisenhower told applauding members of
Congress that income should exceed outgo in the 1961 fiscal year by $4,200,000,000.

Despite a record peacetime
| spending proposal of nearly 80
; billion, the amount left over if Ei
! senhower is an accurate prophet
would be the highest since the
Truman administration found it
j self with an excess of almost B',i;
, billion in 1948.
Eisenhower, greeting Congress
'at tlie start of a presidential elec
i tion year, recommended that any
i such surplus be applied against
i the 29<)-bi 11 ion-dollar national debt.
Prosperous Year Predicted
As Republicans cheered and
Democrats reacted with mild ap
proval, Eisenhower said that once
' paying off part of the debt be
comes normal practice, the gov
ernment can proceed to reduce
taxes. He did not suggest when
that time would arrive. But for
the country at large, he declared,
j "1960 promises to be the most
prosperous year in our history."
With diplomats from other na
tions, including the U.S.S.R., pres
ent for for the packed joint ses
sion of House and Senate, Eisen
hower said recent Soviet deport
ment offers hope of "a somewhat
less strained period" in relations
betwen East and West.
Cycle Must Be Broken
"We must strive to break the
i calamitous cycle of frustrations
and crises which, if unchecked,
could spiral into nuclear disas
ter," Eisenhower told the nation
listening and watching via radio
and television. And this, he added,
would represent "the ultimate in
sanity."
He said no nation would risk
general war, and terrible retalia
tory losses, by attacking this
country "unless we should be so
foolish as to neglect" forces of
defense. These have acquired new
strength, lie said, as the Atlas in
tercontinental ballistic missile has
I reached the ready stage.
Atlas Firings Accurate
In 14 recent test firings, Eisen
j hower reported, the Atlas has
I been less than the distance of a
jet runway off bullseye at ranges
1 of more than 5,000 miles.
Eisenhower also said that in
creasing numbers of nuclear-pow
ered submarines, "impossible to
I destroy by surprise attack." will
enter the fleet. Some will be
| armed with 1,200-mile-range Po
; laris ballistic missiles.
But he held out hope that it
will not be necessary to use these
1 weapons.
Eisenhower called for harmony
between Ihe White House and
Congress by saying that the na
tion faces "what may be a turn
ing point in history" and said
precious time would he wasted in
the months ahead by "irrelevant
j interbranch wrangling."

Cycle Must Be Broken
"We must strive to break the
i calamitous cycle of frustrations
and crises which, if unchecked,
could spiral into nuclear disas
ter," Eisenhower told the nation
listening and watching via radio
and television. And this, he added,
would represent "the ultimate in
sanity."
He said no nation would risk
general war, and terrible retalia
tory losses, by attacking this
country "unless we should be so
foolish as to neglect" forces of
defense. These have acquired new
strength, lie said, as the Atlas in
tercontinental ballistic missile has
I reached the ready stage.
Atlas Firings Accurate
In 14 recent test firings, Eisen

I been less than the distance of a
jet runway off bullseye at ranges
1 of more than 5,000 miles.
Eisenhower also said that in
creasing numbers of nuclear-pow
ered submarines, "impossible to
I destroy by surprise attack." will
enter the fleet. Some will be

But he held out hope that it
will not be necessary to use these

WASHINGTON (/P) — President Eisenhower yesterday forcast unmatched prosperity for the
United States, a debt-cutting surplus J'or its government and—if the Soviet Union cooperates—peace
with justice for all the world.
In a confidently optimist State of the Union message, Eisenhower told applauding members of
Congress that income should exceed outgo in the 1961 fiscal year by $4,200,000,000.

Despite a record peacetime
| spending proposal of nearly 80
; billion, the amount left over if Ei
! senhower is an accurate prophet
would be the highest since the
Truman administration found it
j self with an excess of almost B',i;
, billion in 1948.
Eisenhower, greeting Congress
'at tlie start of a presidential elec
i tion year, recommended that any
i such surplus be applied against
i the 29<)-bi 11 ion-dollar national debt.
Prosperous Year Predicted
As Republicans cheered and
Democrats reacted with mild ap
proval, Eisenhower said that once
' paying off part of the debt be
comes normal practice, the gov
ernment can proceed to reduce
taxes. He did not suggest when
that time would arrive. But for
the country at large, he declared,
j "1960 promises to be the most
prosperous year in our history."
