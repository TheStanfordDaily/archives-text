President Wallace Sterling will take a look at the "State of the
University" this morning at 11 in Memorial Auditorium, and tell
what he hopes for Stanford in the years to come.
This speech, entitled "Stanford in Review and Prospect," kicks

University, and to give them an
insight into the problems and
activities of Stanford.
All 11 a.m. classes have been
canceled to enable students to
attend the talk which will last
about 40 minutes.
Sterling will view the institu
tion of the university president

a university is and should be. He
will examine the purposes, needs
and problems of universities and
give his impressions of Stanford
when he first came here.
Evaluation
Included in his talk will be an
evaluation of Stanford during the
past 10 years and a report on
Stanford in regard to its national
and international reputation and
how it compares with other uni
versities. He will also touch upon
Stanford's foreign campuses and
will reveal the results of a study
formulating the plans and pro
gram for the University's next
10 years.
While there will be no questions
presented from the floor, students
