# Realistic Approach
## 
### 
Stanford Today and Tomorrow begins its annual series of
discussions and lee lures this morning when President Wallace
Sterling addresses the student body.
ST&T, kevnoled b\ Dr. Sterling's speech, is designed to
acquaint students more thoroughl) with problems, policies and
actions of the I Diversity. It is fell lltal b\ having high-ranking
I nhersiiv officials meet with small groups of students, it will
be possiblt to let tliein know just what is going on here.
This i- <>l>\ ioush a desirable goal the more a student knows
about liis school, the belter he should be able to understand
the situations both lie and it encounter, and the more he can
gain from and gi\e to the I niversitv.
Despite the value of this goal and the hard work of both
si u den is and facult\, previous sessions of ST&T have sometimes
been criticized for reall) telling students nothing the\ didn't
already know.
Whether past ST&l's have said amthing or not isn't the
problem now, however. The question is whether this year's
ST&T series will sa\ anything. We suspect that for most people,
there will be some new information given.
I he situation ST&T faces is that it must talk lo persons who
have a wide \ariet\ of information about Stanford. W hat is news
10 main is old hal to some. Since this latter group learns nothing
new, it then claims that ST&T is worthless.
though perhaps il would he ideal for every student lo know
ever) little "behind-the-scenes" fact, all the skeletons in the.Stan
lord operational closet, and the inside stor\ on an\ and all feuds.
11 might just as well he realized that ST&T isn't going to come
out with tins information. I hose who expect to ln'hr this kind of
information or sonic set of radical new policies that will turn
Stanford upside-down are doomed to disappointment.
We believe SI &T has informational value more to some
persons than lo others. We think this value can best be realized
if listeners go into the series Inning a realistic idea of ihe kind
of information the\*re going to gel. and don't expect the kind
Ibex aren I going lo gel.
