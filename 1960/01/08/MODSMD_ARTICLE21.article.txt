## Workshop Production A Success 
### Mary lou McKinley 
Playing to a nearly full house
Wednesday night in Memorial
Auditorium, John Oborne's "The
Entertainer" bitterly at tacked
present day society in an excel
lent production by the Actor's
Workshop from San Francisco.
The three act drama, set in Eng
land during the Sue/, crisis of
1956, centers around a failing
music-hall comedian, Archie Rice,
who plays before "sad little
I drabs" and "by the reluctant
| agreement of thirty angry
I people."
I With many barbs at the Eng
lish government, the play is con
j cerned with the plight of the
lower and lower-middle classes.
For Osborne, as the Suez, crisis
I represents England's last ineffec
tive attempt to keep her power
from dying, so does the fading
music hall represent the last out
let for the lower classes.
'Music Hall Dying'
In a prefatory note he writes,
i"The music hall is dying, and,
with it, a significant part of Eng
land."
Especially notable perform
ances were given by Robert
Symonds as Archie, Shirley Jac
Wagner as his wife Phoebe, and
Robert Ilaswell who played Billie,
his father, described by another
| character as the only self-respect
ing member of the family.
Archie's failure was effectively
pointed out by Osborne's use of
j music hall numbers, complete
| with orchestra, set between the
main dramatic sequences.
Second Act Long
Although the second act was a
! little 100 long and repititious, it
I was indicative of the playwright's
! method for putting across a
| point drumming it in over and
! over with no let up.
Directed by Jules Irving, "The
j Entertainer" had force and vigor
j and, hopefully, made many people
aware of the top quality of Ac
| tor's Workshop productions. We
hope the group will bring more
of its shows to Stanford in the
future.

1956, centers around a failing
music-hall comedian, Archie Rice,
who plays before "sad little
I drabs" and "by the reluctant
| agreement of thirty angry
I people."
I With many barbs at the Eng
lish government, the play is con
j cerned with the plight of the
lower and lower-middle classes.
For Osborne, as the Suez, crisis
I represents England's last ineffec
tive attempt to keep her power
from dying, so does the fading
music hall represent the last out
let for the lower classes.
'Music Hall Dying'
In a prefatory note he writes,
i"The music hall is dying, and,
with it, a significant part of Eng
land."
Especially notable perform
ances were given by Robert
Symonds as Archie, Shirley Jac
Wagner as his wife Phoebe, and
Robert Ilaswell who played Billie,
his father, described by another
| character as the only self-respect
ing member of the family.
Archie's failure was effectively
pointed out by Osborne's use of
j music hall numbers, complete
| with orchestra, set between the
main dramatic sequences.
Second Act Long
Although the second act was a
! little 100 long and repititious, it
I was indicative of the playwright's
! method for putting across a
| point drumming it in over and
! over with no let up.
Directed by Jules Irving, "The
j Entertainer" had force and vigor
j and, hopefully, made many people
aware of the top quality of Ac
| tor's Workshop productions. We
hope the group will bring more
of its shows to Stanford in the
future.
