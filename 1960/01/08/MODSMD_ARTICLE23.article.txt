Freedom of speech and belief
i seems to be short all over these
j days.
Quote: a letter to the Univer
sity of Cincinnati News Record.
Subject: a folk concert.
"Don't go for (lie reaction that
! all Peter Seeger did was sin;?. . . .
"Folk songs can lÂ»<* a beach
head, and have been beach
heads in other communities for
the Communist apparatus. . . .
"Remember, Alger Hiss and
William Remington were more
charming,- dapper and suive than
Peter Seegar and fooled some in
| lelligent pet-sons."
The News Record promptly
stated editorially:
"The question of allowing an
artist to perform in spite of his
political beliefs or affiliations is
one that has been presented . . .
recently. The Circuit Riders As
sociation (a self-appointed, unof
; fical v e r si on of I ho congress
ional un-American activities com
mittee) has circulated pamphlets
entitled "Communism and the
i NAACP," which contain informa
tion about alleged communist as
i social ions of Peter Seeger.
. . We defend the right of

Peter Seeger to appear wliere
ever he is invited to appear and
the right of any publication to
take note of tins appearance. . . .
"These attempts to punish a
man in his profession because of
his political beliefs . . . should be
left to the FBI or some other of
ficial and appropriate branch of
the government, and not to vari
ous groups of private citizens.
"The Circuit Riders and
[American | Legionnaires are
now exhibiting the epitome of
hypocrisy, as not too lony ago
they were scolding the Soviet
L' nio ii for discrimination
against Boris Pasternak, and
are now hindering the perform
ances of Peter Seeger for the
same reasons that the USSR
denied Pasternak all that was
his due."
At (lie same time, Lehigh Uni
versity officials wore denying in
ternationally-noted Socialist lend
er Norman Thomas permission to
speak on campus.
The most widely-circulated re
port was that University Presi
dent Martin D. Whitaker voted
against Thomas' proposed visit on
ihe grounds that it might antago
nzie Lehigh alumni and thus ad
versely affect current fund drives.
Lehigh students are particu
larly sore about the decision,
and equally sore about the faet
that there has been no explana
tion offered the student body
by the administration.
The captain of a senior class
fund drive designed to raise
money for the university resigned
f''om his pogt, citing the Thomas
incident as "the last straw."
Fifteen graduate s t ud en t s ,
many of them instructors, hit the
university's "reprehensible moral
flabbiness" in an open letter.
And, at Long Island Univer
sity's < . W, Post College, a pro
fessor under fire for giving up
his American citizenship and be
coming a Nazi wartime propa
gandist <| it it his teaching post,
li was the third such job his
onetime Nazi convictions have
cost him.
At least six Long Island vet
eran's groups had protested his
retention, and a state assembly
man called for the professor's
suspension under threat of halt
ing state support for the school.

University President liicliard
L. Conolly, in announcing the
resignation, said it came "at a
time when I was engaged in re
i studying his suitability as a
faculty member."
Conolly said Sit tier resigned
; "in orded to relieve the college
and the university of embarrass
i meijt incident to the recent pub
| licity concerning his case."
