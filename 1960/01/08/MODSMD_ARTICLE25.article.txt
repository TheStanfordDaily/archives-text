# 'Home Away From Home' For Chinese
## 
### Fred Aw 
The only house of its kind on
campus, the Chinese House was
established to accommodate a
group of students from one par
ticular country. Since its origina
tion over thirty years ago, its
primary function has been to of
fer Chinese students from over
seas a special place of their own.
At the Chinese House, they can
find an atmosphere closer to
home.
If your staple diet had been rice
three times a day all your life,
how would you feel to have to
eat bread or potatoes at meal
time? At the Chinese House, the
students do their own cooking,
and they always serve their na
tional dishes at dinnertime chop
sticks and all.
Friendly Atmosphere
According to C. P. Wang, presi
dent of the house, there is a
friendly atmosphere among the
members. There are twelve Chi
nese students staying at the
house, and all of them are in
graduate schools. Most of them
are from Formosa or Hong Kong.
Apart from these twelve, there
is also an American student and
one from India.
Socially, the house members are
not very active. This is not bo
cause they are shy or unwilling
to mix. Like any other Stanford
student they like fun, but being
graduate students, they have very
little time to spare.
Problem
Although most of them speak
good English, the problem of con
versing with English-speaking
students still exists.
In the 1 past, members of tho
Chinese House have lectured to
local organizations and to student
groups. The students are always
pleased, commented Wang, to im
part Chinese culture to American
students who are interested. The
house takes much pride in that il
serves, in this way, as an organ
to promote understanding and
friendship between the two coun
tries.
