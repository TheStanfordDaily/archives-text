# Indians Host Powerful Bears
## Three Tribe First Stringers Ailing for Basketball Big Game Daily Sports 
### Steve Baffrey, Associate Editor 
The time has all but come when the Stanford basketball Indians
i will have to face the music and dance.
The music, undoubtedly, will be supplied by Cal's obnoxiously
i loud mouthed "Straw Hat Band."
This all happens tomorrow night at 8 when Stanford and Cal

meet in the Indians' first home
| AAWU game in the Pavilion.
Here in the Stanford camp, no
; body is quite sure whether the
! Tribe is ready for Cal or not.
Trainer Connie Jarvis reports
! that guard John Artillaga will
probably play the game without
ihe aid of a contact lense in his
irritated left eye.
"But," Jarvis is quick to add,
"John's played basketball 4 for
jyears without contact lenses, so
it probably won't affect him too
much. He made the Stanford club
without using them."
Arrillaga was accidently hit in
I the face during Monday night's
! game against Oregon State, and

the jar drove his lense up under!
| his eyelid.
The injured knee situations of
| both John I-lendry and Jerry
| Thuesen may have some bearing;
j on the game's outcome.
Hendry's knee was injured in
| ihe West Virginia game down in
L.A., but because of the continu-!
ling road trip has just this week
j come under the doctor's eye. It
isn't expected to keep him out
of the game, though lie's been |
given a couple of practice sessions I
| off to rest it.
In Thuesen's case, the injury
dates back to pre-season. The 6-7
forward had a little trouble on I

I lie l oad trip, and this is what
J caused the speculation that he
might not be in top form for
! Saturday's game, fie will play,
i however.
Stomach flu has caught one of
the Cards in its grip (so to speak)
and may lay him up for a while.
I Phil KelJey suffered from the
trouble on the road trip, and it
has bothered him since, so Jarvis
j and the doctors may hold him out
j of the contest.
Cul Ready
Meanwhile the fast-breaking,
defense-minded national ( ham
pions from Berkeley seem to be
i coming along in fine shape for the
(weekend tussle. They will tangle
with Johnnie Wooden's UCLA
| Bruins on Friday while the In
| dians take a rest.
On Dec. 2(5 the Bears sat atop
I the nation's defensive clubs, and
| while there might have been a
: slight change in the meantime,
| they're still mighty close to the
iop. Southern Cal's Trojans have
| since scored 61 and 65 points
against the Blue and Gold.
Who'll star in the Cal attack on
j Saturday is an interesting ques
tion. The plenty-of-talent. club
seldom has the same boy in the
spotlight for consecutive games.
Imliof'f C'ouid Star
II might well be the big 6-10
cenler Darrall Irnhoff, or 6-6 for
ward Tandy (lillis. Irnhoff draws
"oohs" and "abbs" wherever he
plays, though is often*equalled
and sometime overshadowed.
Gil!is was a bright spot in the
Cal sweep of the L.A. Classic, and
did well last weekend against the
Trojans.
And this is not to count out
Bill MeClintock, 6-4 junior for
ward, or 6-4 guard Earl Schultz.
McClintock is a terror from the
field when he's hot, and Schultz
is no slouch at any time.

Tomorrow night's basketball
game between Stanford and
Calilornia will be broadcasted
over station IiZSL' at X:of> p.m.
Don Liebendorfer Jr. will do the
play by play description, while
Jack Koch will do color.
The Stanford station will
broadcast all Indian home

The time has all but come when the Stanford basketball Indians
i will have to face the music and dance.
The music, undoubtedly, will be supplied by Cal's obnoxiously
i loud mouthed "Straw Hat Band."
This all happens tomorrow night at 8 when Stanford and Cal

meet in the Indians' first home
| AAWU game in the Pavilion.
Here in the Stanford camp, no
; body is quite sure whether the

Trainer Connie Jarvis reports

probably play the game without
ihe aid of a contact lense in his
irritated left eye.
"But," Jarvis is quick to add,
"John's played basketball 4 for
jyears without contact lenses, so
it probably won't affect him too
much. He made the Stanford club
without using them."
Arrillaga was accidently hit in
I the face during Monday night's
! game against Oregon State, and

the jar drove his lense up under!

The injured knee situations of
| both John I-lendry and Jerry

Hendry's knee was injured in

ling road trip has just this week
j come under the doctor's eye. It
isn't expected to keep him out
of the game, though lie's been |

In Thuesen's case, the injury
dates back to pre-season. The 6-7
forward had a little trouble on I

I lie l oad trip, and this is what
J caused the speculation that he
might not be in top form for
! Saturday's game, fie will play,
i however.
Stomach flu has caught one of
the Cards in its grip (so to speak)
and may lay him up for a while.
I Phil KelJey suffered from the

Play-miiking aw <»!' the NCAA champions
The time has all but come when the Stanford basketball Indians
i will have to face the music and dance.
The music, undoubtedly, will be supplied by Cal's obnoxiously
i loud mouthed "Straw Hat Band."
This all happens tomorrow night at 8 when Stanford and Cal

meet in the Indians' first home
| AAWU game in the Pavilion.
Here in the Stanford camp, no
; body is quite sure whether the
! Tribe is ready for Cal or not.
Trainer Connie Jarvis reports
! that guard John Artillaga will
probably play the game without
ihe aid of a contact lense in his
irritated left eye.
"But," Jarvis is quick to add,
"John's played basketball 4 for
jyears without contact lenses, so
it probably won't affect him too
much. He made the Stanford club
without using them."
Arrillaga was accidently hit in
I the face during Monday night's
! game against Oregon State, and

the jar drove his lense up under!
| his eyelid.
The injured knee situations of
| both John I-lendry and Jerry
| Thuesen may have some bearing;
j on the game's outcome.
Hendry's knee was injured in
| ihe West Virginia game down in
L.A., but because of the continu-!
ling road trip has just this week
j come under the doctor's eye. It
isn't expected to keep him out
of the game, though lie's been |
given a couple of practice sessions I
| off to rest it.
In Thuesen's case, the injury
dates back to pre-season. The 6-7
forward had a little trouble on I

I lie l oad trip, and this is what
J caused the speculation that he
might not be in top form for
