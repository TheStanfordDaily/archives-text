# Arrillaga, Bowling Top Indian Backcourt Men
## 
### 
With the graduation of Stan
ford guards Paul Neumann and
Doug Warren last June Head
Basketball Coach Howie Dallmar
had the tough job of developing
two new players to fill the back
court spots in this year's starting
hoop quintet.
John Arrillaga high scoring
forward on last year's team was
moved to the backcourt to assume
one of the starting positions and
Bub Bowling, captain of the 1958
freshman team and 1939 varsity
reserve, was placed at the other
starting guard position.
Top Scorer
Arrillaga has been a top scorer
ever since he broke into the Stan
ford varsity lineup two years ago.
His favorite shot, an over the
head fading jump shot, has made
him one of the AAWU's leading
scorers this year and the top
point man on this years Stanford
team.
Arrillaga is definitely the vet
eran on Dallmar's quintet having
seen full time action for two
years. His last second basket
against USF two years ago that
gave Stanford a one point upset
victory over the then high rank
ing Dons is one of Stanford's
greatest moments in sports.
Arrillaga comes from a sport
ing family with his brother Gabe
an ex-football and basketball star
at California.
Arrillaga. an Inglewood native,
has good size for a guard at ti-3.
Fine Haymaker
The other starting backcourt
man on this year's Stanford five,
Clayton "Bub" Bowling, is one of
the finest playmakers in recent
Indian basketball history.
Bowling is an excellent ball
handler who provides fans with
all the dessert sharp passes,
tricky moves, and extraordinary
speed. The 5-11 junior is espe
cially good at stealing the ball
on defense and going for an easy
two point drive.
Bowling was ihe leading scorer
on the freshman squad two years
ago and has .shown flashes this
year of becoming a top score)
again. He has a very unpredicta
ble jump shot that has been hot
on some occasions but very frigid
on others.
John Stahler, scrappy 5-7 sen
ior, provides Dallmar with a good
third guard. Stahler has seen ac
tion with the varsity for the past
three years. His speed and excep
tional dribbling ability have been
a valuable asset to the Indian
team.
Stahler has provided Coach
Dallmar with plenty of hustle on
tiie court and has thrown terror
into many opponents with liis
never tiring pursuit on defense.
Bench Strength
Along with Stahler. Tom Nord
land. Mace Byles, and Rich
Thompson give Stanford needed
bench strength at the guard post.
Nordland a junior from Minne
apolis, Minnesota, played some
with the varsity last year. The
(5-1 guard was teamed with Bowl
ing as a starting guard on the
1958 freshman team.
Rich Thompson and Mace Byles
are both seniors. Byles has boon
with the varsity for three years
but has only seen limited action
in that time. Thompson, a line
passer, has seen action with the
.TV's over the last two seasons.
John Fontius. promising sopho
more guard prospect, after fight
ing an ankle injury for several
weeks, decided to take this year
off from basketball in hopes that

his injury would heal completely
by next season.
Coach Da I! mar's backeourt men
will face the difficult,task of mak
ing the Stanford offense go to
morrow night against California.
The Bears, always noted for their
defense, are among the leaders in
that department again this year.
