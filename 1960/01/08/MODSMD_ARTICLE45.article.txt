If co-hosts SC and UCLA are
lucky enough to set up as fine a
set of basketball games in the
•oming couple of years as they
lid in 1959, their Los Angeles
basketball Classic may soon be
vome one of the nation's brightest
loop tournaments.
A rematch of the previous
year's NCAA playoff, another
game between long standing
•ross-town rivals, top name play
ers, and lesser games still full of
alent and excitement are all
needed to make a tournament
?reat, and the classic had all of
hese.
And if the arena is important
and it surely is then you'd
have to go a long way to top
the new Memorial Sports Arena
in the City of the Angels, where
seating capacity approaches 15,-
000.
Almost every seat in the beauti
ful as well as functional building
is a perfectly clear view of the
action. Almost every one, that is.
Mine had four pipes and a cement
staircase looming in front of it,
but it was an unfortunate acci
dent, I think.
The automatic attendance
counter in the Arena registered
over 45,000 persons during the
three-day affair. It was divided
into six sessions with two games
each in the afternoon and eve
ning parts.
The Classic was well "staged."

I A tournament of this sort should
' look" good while providing top
notch basketball. Organ music* or
lhe sounds of good Rose Bowl
Parade bands provided between
games and lime-out entertain
ment.
Even though the Big Ten repre
sentatives fared poorest of all the
squads in the tourney, their pres
ence, providing an opportunity to
so a different style of ball, was a
' good idea.
The Classic showed off individ
j uals such as the following All
Tournament first team: Tandy
(J ill is (Call, Jerry West (West
Virginia), Dan all Imhoff (Call,
John Werhas (USCi and Mannie
i Jackson (Illinois).
Sports writers all up and down
j the coast', ar.d across the country
for that matter, are interested to
I see what the 1060 Classic brings.

the new Memorial Sports Arena
in the City of the Angels, where
seating capacity approaches 15,-
000.
Almost every seat in the beauti
ful as well as functional building
is a perfectly clear view of the
action. Almost every one, that is.
Mine had four pipes and a cement
staircase looming in front of it,
but it was an unfortunate acci
dent, I think.
The automatic attendance
counter in the Arena registered
over 45,000 persons during the
three-day affair. It was divided
into six sessions with two games
each in the afternoon and eve
ning parts.
The Classic was well "staged."

I A tournament of this sort should
' look" good while providing top
notch basketball. Organ music* or
lhe sounds of good Rose Bowl
Parade bands provided between
games and lime-out entertain
ment.
Even though the Big Ten repre
sentatives fared poorest of all the
squads in the tourney, their pres
ence, providing an opportunity to
so a different style of ball, was a
' good idea.
The Classic showed off individ
j uals such as the following All
Tournament first team: Tandy
(J ill is (Call, Jerry West (West
Virginia), Dan all Imhoff (Call,
John Werhas (USCi and Mannie
i Jackson (Illinois).
Sports writers all up and down
j the coast', ar.d across the country
for that matter, are interested to
I see what the 1060 Classic brings.

lucky enough to set up as fine a
set of basketball games in the

lid in 1959, their Los Angeles
basketball Classic may soon be
vome one of the nation's brightest
loop tournaments.
A rematch of the previous
year's NCAA playoff, another
game between long standing
•ross-town rivals, top name play
ers, and lesser games still full of
alent and excitement are all
needed to make a tournament
