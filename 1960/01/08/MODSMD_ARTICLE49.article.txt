First Little Story
Once upon :i time a (lorman exchange student from old Iloidel
l>erg came to an American university. Ho lived in the men's
dormitory of the great American university. He was a fine,
decent your g man and all the other you mi men in the dt irmitory
of the great American university tried very hard to make
friend- with him, but, unfortunately, he was so shy that lie
r 'd all their imitations to join their bull sos-ions. After a
while his dormitory mates got tired of asking him and so the
poor (!erni.au exchange student, alas, spent every evening alone
in his room.
' hie • v.ht while sitting all alone in his room, he smclled the
ni" t delicious aroma coming from the room next door. Con
quering h: sliynes-', he walked to the room next door and there
lie saw a bunch of his dormitory mates sitting around and dis
cus-ing lit rature, art, culture, and like that. They were all
sin • kinu Marlboro cigarettes, which accounts for the delicious
aroma smclled by the German exchange student.

Timidly, he entered the room. "Excuse me," ho said, "but
what is that marvelous smell 1 smell?"
"Its our good Marlboro cigarettes," cried the men, who were
named Fun-loving Ned, Happy Harry, Jolly Jim, and Tol'ablc
1 )a\ id.
So the German exchange student took a Marlboro and en
joyed t hose bet t( r ma kin's, that finer filter, that smooth, heart y
flavor, and soon lie was comfortable and easy and lost his
shyness.
from that night forward, whenever lie smclled the good sunell
of Marll M>ro cigarettes, lie always went next door and joined
the bull session.

Miiskrat who had a squaw named Margaret Giggling Water.
Margaret was sort of a mes- but she sure could make beaded
moccasins. Every day she whipped up a brand-new pair of
beaded moccasins for Walter, which were so gorgeous that all
the I iid ia n maids on t ho rose rvat ion grow giddy with ad mi rat ion.

eyes at Walter and one night- they had a terrible quarrel.
Walt or flew into i rage and -lapped her on the wrist, w hereupon
si'O i:; led crying like all get-out and went home to her mother
and never came hack.
( iood riddance! said Walter, but alas, ho soon found out
how wrong he was, for the Indian maids wore not really in
terested in him, only in his moccasins, and when he stopped
showing up with a new pair even day tliev quicklv gave liini
