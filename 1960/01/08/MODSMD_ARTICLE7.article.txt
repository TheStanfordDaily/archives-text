# New Nuclear Reactor Unveiled at Ryan Lab
## 
### Ross Hermann 
A nuclear reactor, the largest
of its type to be installed at a
West Coast university, was un
veiled here yesterday at the Nu
clear Technology Laboratory.
The new reactor, with a capac
ity of 10,000 thermal watts, will
be used in teaching and experi
mental research. It was fully
tested last month and will bo put
into full operation next week. The
energy from the leactor is dis-
I sipated and will not be utilized.
The unit, costing $17.1,000. was!
financed partially by a $150,000
I educational assistance grant from
the Atomic Energy Commission
; and an additional $2.),000 from the
j C. F. Brown Trust of Alhambra, j
1 California. It was constructed by
i the Atomic Power Equipment De
t part men t of General Electric.
No Radiation Danger
| Experts have described the re
j actor as "fool-proof, student- j
i proof, and professor-proof." There j
j is no danger of radiation 1o per- j
sons operating the reactor and
J little chance that it could get out ;
I of hand. II is engineered to shut
; itself off automatically if the core |
! becomes too hot.
Even if the automatic safe
guard were to fail and the reactor j
run uncontrolled then u clear]
; energy released could do no dam-1
age, except maybe to the interior !
! of the reactor.
Stanford's new reactor is a I
General Electric version of the j
"swimming pool" type developed ,
originally by the Oak Ridge Na
tional Laboratory in Tennessee.
It is designed specifically for uni
versity teaching and research.
For Graduate Training
Beginning next week, four lab j
sessions with five graduate stu
dents each will be conducted in
which the 1 operation of the reactor !
will be intensively studied. There j
will be one undergraduate course
that will teach the most elemen
tary aspects of Ihe unit.
Research will be carried on in
the production of radioisotopes]
and the measurement of neutron
beams. The reactor unit will be
j used to test materials for their
ability to stop or transmit neu
trons that is to determine the,
usefulness of various substances
as shields.
The reactor is noted for its peak
I "thermal flux" the production of
! 100 billion neutrons per square
centimeter per second.
('oncrete Octagon
From the ground floor of the
laboratory, the reactor appears as
j a huge octagonal block of eon
i crete with walls rising to a height
; of 20 feet. At the base, the walls
are seven feet thick and diminish
to a thickness of a foot and a half
at the top. The base is 24 feet in
j diameter and 88 feet in circum- 1
! fere nee.
Contained inside the concrete
j walls is a pool of water 20 feet
| deep, at the bottom of which sits
I the core, consisting of a series
of uranium-aluminum "sand-1
i wiches" separated by several
blades.
The open top of the pool is
j spanned by a steel bridge on
which operators can work safely,
shielded from the radiation by
the deep water. The separating i
blades, made of boron steel, are
I suspended from the bridge and,
I are raised or lowered from the ,

nearby control panel on the lab
oratory balcony.
The blades absorb excess neu
trons and keep the reaction under
control. When they are removed,
the nuclear reaction reaches a
critical state, but the reactor is
kept Xrom exploding by automatic
controls.
Direct access to the core is pos
sible from the outside by means
of two "beam ports" and a "ther
mal column." These will be used
for inserting experimental mate
rial and producing radioisotopes.
The reactor is located at the
Harris J. Ryan High Voltage
Laboratory where many features
of power transmission lines were
developed. Nuclear engineering
facilities have been taking over
the structure in recent years.
Professors George Leppert,
Thomas J. Connolly, and Robert
A. Daane, all members of the
Mechanical Engineering Depart
ment. will direct the operation of
the reactor. Professor Leppert is
the director of the laboratory.

From the ground floor of the

j a huge octagonal block of eon
i crete with walls rising to a height
; of 20 feet. At the base, the walls
are seven feet thick and diminish
to a thickness of a foot and a half
at the top. The base is 24 feet in
j diameter and 88 feet in circum- 1
! fere nee.
Contained inside the concrete
j walls is a pool of water 20 feet
| deep, at the bottom of which sits
I the core, consisting of a series
of uranium-aluminum "sand-1
i wiches" separated by several
blades.
The open top of the pool is
j spanned by a steel bridge on
which operators can work safely,
shielded from the radiation by
the deep water. The separating i
blades, made of boron steel, are
I suspended from the bridge and,
I are raised or lowered from the ,

nearby control panel on the lab
oratory balcony.
The blades absorb excess neu
trons and keep the reaction under
control. When they are removed,
the nuclear reaction reaches a
critical state, but the reactor is
kept Xrom exploding by automatic
controls.
Direct access to the core is pos
sible from the outside by means
of two "beam ports" and a "ther
mal column." These will be used
for inserting experimental mate
rial and producing radioisotopes.
The reactor is located at the
Harris J. Ryan High Voltage
Laboratory where many features
of power transmission lines were
developed. Nuclear engineering
facilities have been taking over
the structure in recent years.
Professors George Leppert,
Thomas J. Connolly, and Robert
A. Daane, all members of the
Mechanical Engineering Depart
ment. will direct the operation of
the reactor. Professor Leppert is
the director of the laboratory.

! 100 billion neutrons per square
centimeter per second.
('oncrete Octagon
From the ground floor of the
laboratory, the reactor appears as
j a huge octagonal block of eon
i crete with walls rising to a height
; of 20 feet. At the base, the walls
are seven feet thick and diminish
to a thickness of a foot and a half
at the top. The base is 24 feet in
j diameter and 88 feet in circum- 1
! fere nee.
Contained inside the concrete
j walls is a pool of water 20 feet
| deep, at the bottom of which sits
I the core, consisting of a series
of uranium-aluminum "sand-1
i wiches" separated by several
blades.
The open top of the pool is
j spanned by a steel bridge on
which operators can work safely,
shielded from the radiation by
the deep water. The separating i
blades, made of boron steel, are
I suspended from the bridge and,
I are raised or lowered from the ,

nearby control panel on the lab
oratory balcony.
The blades absorb excess neu
trons and keep the reaction under
control. When they are removed,
the nuclear reaction reaches a
critical state, but the reactor is
kept Xrom exploding by automatic
controls.
Direct access to the core is pos
sible from the outside by means
of two "beam ports" and a "ther
mal column." These will be used
for inserting experimental mate
rial and producing radioisotopes.
The reactor is located at the
Harris J. Ryan High Voltage
Laboratory where many features
of power transmission lines were
developed. Nuclear engineering
facilities have been taking over
the structure in recent years.
Professors George Leppert,
Thomas J. Connolly, and Robert
A. Daane, all members of the
Mechanical Engineering Depart
ment. will direct the operation of
the reactor. Professor Leppert is
the director of the laboratory.

STANFORD'S NEW TEN-KILOWATT NUCLEAR REACTOR
"Fool-proof, student-proof and professor-proof"
A nuclear reactor, the largest
of its type to be installed at a
West Coast university, was un
veiled here yesterday at the Nu
clear Technology Laboratory.
The new reactor, with a capac
ity of 10,000 thermal watts, will
be used in teaching and experi
mental research. It was fully
tested last month and will bo put
into full operation next week. The
energy from the leactor is dis-
I sipated and will not be utilized.
The unit, costing $17.1,000. was!
financed partially by a $150,000
I educational assistance grant from
the Atomic Energy Commission
; and an additional $2.),000 from the
j C. F. Brown Trust of Alhambra, j
1 California. It was constructed by
i the Atomic Power Equipment De
t part men t of General Electric.
No Radiation Danger
| Experts have described the re
j actor as "fool-proof, student- j
i proof, and professor-proof." There j
j is no danger of radiation 1o per- j
sons operating the reactor and
J little chance that it could get out ;
I of hand. II is engineered to shut
; itself off automatically if the core |
! becomes too hot.
Even if the automatic safe
guard were to fail and the reactor j
run uncontrolled then u clear]
; energy released could do no dam-1
age, except maybe to the interior !
! of the reactor.
Stanford's new reactor is a I
General Electric version of the j
"swimming pool" type developed ,
originally by the Oak Ridge Na
tional Laboratory in Tennessee.
It is designed specifically for uni
versity teaching and research.
For Graduate Training
Beginning next week, four lab j
sessions with five graduate stu
dents each will be conducted in
which the 1 operation of the reactor !
will be intensively studied. There j
will be one undergraduate course
that will teach the most elemen
tary aspects of Ihe unit.
Research will be carried on in
the production of radioisotopes]
and the measurement of neutron
beams. The reactor unit will be
j used to test materials for their
ability to stop or transmit neu
trons that is to determine the,
usefulness of various substances
as shields.
