## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P> — Sens. John Marshall Butler <R-Md.) and
J. William Fulbright (D Ark.) accused the Eisenhower administration
officials yesterday of forcing an inflationary steel settlement.
Without naming Vice President Richard M. Nixon or Secretary
of Labor James P. Mitchell, Butler said the steel industry agreed to

I a new contract after it was
i "warned by certain high-placed
| men in government it otherwise
j might face punitive legislation."
Due Process
Butler, a member of the Senate-
House Economic Committee, said
in a statement: "Dizzy with vi
sions of labor votes, the adminis
tration interfered with due proces
ses of arbitration and forced a
settlement without serious consid
i eration of its ultimate cost and
i its cumulative assault on our na
j tion's market place."
Nixon and Mitchell were credit
i ed with laying down the terms
finally accepted by the companies
and the union.
Enhancing Chances
The result was viewed as en
hancing Nixon's chances for be
coming the Republican presiden
tial nominee and as pushing
Mitchell along toward possible
nomination as his vice-presiden
tial running mate.
Fulbright, who heads the Sen
ate Foreign .Relations Committee,
said in a speech prepared for Sen
ate delivery today, ho agrees with
estimates that the settlement rep
; resented "a political fix."
High Price
He said the price tag will be a
billion-dollar increase in steel
prices and that this is likely to
set off another inflation spiral.
Fulbright noted there were re
ports the steel companies had
agreed with Nixon and Mitchell
to forego any general price in
crease for several months. If this
happens Fulbright said it "ought
to be classified, under the Corrupt
Practices Act, as a campaign con
tribution to the Republican par
ty."
