# $182 Million Needed--Sterling
## 
### Steve Freidberg 
President Wallace Sterling, speaking at Mem
orial Auditorium Friday, announced that in the
next 10 years Stanford will need an additional
$182 million in order to retain its high academic
standards.
Sterling's talk on "Stanford in Review and
Prospect" initiated the 1960 Stanford Today and
Tomorrow program before a capacity crowd of
students and faculty.
In enumerating the goals for which Ihe added
$18 million a year will be used, he gave first
priority to a new undergraduate library, a student
union, higher faculty salaries, an improved resi
dent program and opportunities for students to
take more initiative in academic work. Some of
the increase will also go for the larger faculty and
expanded physical plant.
Turning to the means of acquiring funds, he
mentioned the three basic sources as land, alumni,
and tuition. There has been a "self-help" policy
initiated to develop resources with a direct Stan
ford connection More than one-half of the Uni
versity's land is a campus reserve, and only a
small part of the rest has been developed so far.
However, the income from this provides less than
3 per cent of Stanford's revenue, and never will,
according to Sterling, account for more than 5 per
cent.
The alumni have been tapped and have in-,
creased their contributions fivefold. In regard to
tuition, Sterling said that "other increases will
almost certainly come," but he declined to go
further on this point.

Using these llnce sources as a base, Stanford
has tried to attract more support from founda
tions, private gifts and from the government. The
income from these has gone from $2.4 million
eight years ago to $22.6 million last year. "This
placed Stanford second in the nation as a money
grubber," lie commented.
The last ten years have shown a prosperity
and growing concern for high education, both of
which Stanford has enjoyed, according to Sterling.
The faculty has increased about 50 per cent but
Stanford is not as well off now as ten years ago in
proportion of faculty to students. The quality of
faculty has at the same time improved, and salaries
have increased by 60 per cent, but he called this
"only a modest beginning."
The size of the student body has remaind con
slant, although the proportion of graduate to
undergraduates has increased. At Ihe same time,
the composition of the student body has become
more national, he said. The graduate schools
have improved, and as examples he cited the new
Medical School and its program, and the Business
School which has just received substantial finan
cial support o be announced soon.
In concluding. Sterling said that his presidency
has been for him 10 of the busiest, most interest
ing, and most gratifying years.
Stanford Today and Tomorrow will continue
tomorrow night after dinner in all the freshman
dorms, when 11 professors and administrators will
give talks and answer questions posed by students.
On Jan. 19 and 20, Ihe program will go to the
other campus living groups which have requested
speakers.

School which has just received substantial finan
cial support o be announced soon.
In concluding. Sterling said that his presidency
has been for him 10 of the busiest, most interest
ing, and most gratifying years.
Stanford Today and Tomorrow will continue
tomorrow night after dinner in all the freshman
dorms, when 11 professors and administrators will

On Jan. 19 and 20, Ihe program will go to the
other campus living groups which have requested

President Wallace Sterling, speaking at Mem
orial Auditorium Friday, announced that in the
next 10 years Stanford will need an additional
$182 million in order to retain its high academic
standards.
Sterling's talk on "Stanford in Review and
Prospect" initiated the 1960 Stanford Today and
Tomorrow program before a capacity crowd of
students and faculty.
In enumerating the goals for which Ihe added
$18 million a year will be used, he gave first
priority to a new undergraduate library, a student
union, higher faculty salaries, an improved resi
dent program and opportunities for students to
take more initiative in academic work. Some of
the increase will also go for the larger faculty and
expanded physical plant.
Turning to the means of acquiring funds, he
mentioned the three basic sources as land, alumni,
and tuition. There has been a "self-help" policy
initiated to develop resources with a direct Stan
ford connection More than one-half of the Uni
versity's land is a campus reserve, and only a
small part of the rest has been developed so far.
However, the income from this provides less than
3 per cent of Stanford's revenue, and never will,
according to Sterling, account for more than 5 per
cent.
The alumni have been tapped and have in-,
creased their contributions fivefold. In regard to
tuition, Sterling said that "other increases will
almost certainly come," but he declined to go
further on this point.

Using these llnce sources as a base, Stanford
has tried to attract more support from founda
tions, private gifts and from the government. The
income from these has gone from $2.4 million
eight years ago to $22.6 million last year. "This
placed Stanford second in the nation as a money
grubber," lie commented.
The last ten years have shown a prosperity
and growing concern for high education, both of
which Stanford has enjoyed, according to Sterling.
The faculty has increased about 50 per cent but
Stanford is not as well off now as ten years ago in
proportion of faculty to students. The quality of
faculty has at the same time improved, and salaries
have increased by 60 per cent, but he called this
"only a modest beginning."
The size of the student body has remaind con
slant, although the proportion of graduate to
undergraduates has increased. At Ihe same time,
the composition of the student body has become
more national, he said. The graduate schools
have improved, and as examples he cited the new
Medical School and its program, and the Business
School which has just received substantial finan
cial support o be announced soon.
