# Police Promise Crackdown On Bicycle Law Violators
## 
### 
A crackdown on cyclists fla
grantly violating provisions of
the California Motor Vehicle
Code which pertain to bicycles
was promised by the Traffic
Safety Committee after a Friday
afternoon meeting.
"In general," said C. Robert
Love, Director of Safety, "since
bicycles use campus streets, they
will be treated as cars."
The committee, composed of
representatives from Safety,
Business, Deans', Police, Plan
ning. and Buildings and Grounds
offices, recommended that Stan
ford Police begin issuing citations
to cyclists for certain offenses.
Violations
While not a "complete" list,
Love said, some of the violations
involved deal with observance of
stop signs, lights on hikes used
after dark and right-of-way ob
servat ion.
California requires that bi
cycles used after dark show a
strong white light to the front
and be equipped with a red re
flector visible from the rear.
Love said that police will issue
citations to bicycle riders who
violate laws at the time of acci
dents or near-accidents.

area'.
An earlier proposal to require
licensing of bicycles was rejected.

Thursday night, Sharon Gage
was struck by a car operated by
Sally Rystand at the intersection
of Lasuen and Campus Drive.
Miss Gage, knocked from her
bicycle to the street, received
first-aid at Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital, then was released.
Miss Rystand was cited for
failure to observe a stop sign.
Miss Gage reportedly was riding
an unlighted bike.
Not Cited
Though Miss Gage was not
cited at the time, Love said, under
the new policy, police are in
structed to issue tickets to per
sons under similar circumstances.
In other action, the committee
approved tentative plans for a
bicycle path between Campus
Drive and Escondido Village, par
allel to Escondido Road.
Also put under study were
plans for free distribution of
"Light-a-bike" kits, a planning
office survey of the requirement
for additional bicycle racks
