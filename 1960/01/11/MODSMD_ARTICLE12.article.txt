LONDON (/P) —Soviet Commu
nist leaders complained yesterday
the party propaganda machine
has poor mass impact, not enough
popular appeal and is often too
gray and dry.
The resolution called for better
treatment of ideological problems
by the press. It claimed oral and
printed propaganda was still not
"concrete and purposeful" enough
to get home to the Soviet worker.
"Propaganda speeches are gray
and dry at times," they added.
