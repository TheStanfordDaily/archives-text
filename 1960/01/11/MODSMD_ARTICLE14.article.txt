# Stanford Yesterday?
## 
### 
Dr. Sterling's speech to the Stanford student body Fr i<l a >
was most interesting. Interesting but for the most part not
containing the type of information we believe most persons arc
looking for in the Stanford Today and Tomorrow program,
wliicb the speech initiated.
This wasn't Dr. Sterling's fault. ST&T organizers asked him
to comment on the office of llniversit\ President, on the past
decade at Stanford, and finally on the future here.
Though portions of Dr. Sterling's talk did contain items of
information which were previousl\ unknown to some or all stu
dents, it was not until he reached the discussion <»(' Stanford's
future that we began to hear the sort of material we think
ST&T should be presenting.
In the final IS minutes of-his talk, Dr. Sterling touched pri
marily 011 the need for additional financial resources to imple
ment a program which will make Stanford the leader in the
western two-thirds of the nation.
Time, however, prevented his getting much past the generali
zation that this money is needed. How is this mone\ going to be
used? What new programs will begin? There are literally hun
dreds of questions, both specific and general, which arise from
the simple statement that Stanford needs $182 million in new
inonev. Perhaps most important in some respects where is the
money coining from and how will we go about raising it?
Again, we do not place am fault with Dr. Sterling lie spoke
as he was asked to speak.
Hut we hope the remainder of the ST&T program will help
answer questions raised h\ the final portion of his address. And
we hope ST&T remembers its name is Stanford Today and To
morrow, not Stanford Yesterday or ten years ago.
