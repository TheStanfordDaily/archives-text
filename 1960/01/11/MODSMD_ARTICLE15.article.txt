Ingmar Bergman, "poet with a
camera," has found sudden inter
national fame.
It comes mostly from two films
which have been in San Francisco
and Palo Alto art theaters in the
last several months: first "The
Seventh Seal," study of a Crusad
er's search for God, second, "Wild
Strawberries," story of a lonely
old man's self-analysis.
These films deal with the ques
tion which Bergman asks most
earnestly on the screen and in
his own life: that of man's rela
tion to woman and to God.
Bergman has directed 21 films,
13 of them from his own scripts,
but he controls all phases of the
production to some degree. He
instructs the set designer, the j
composer. He is partially his own 1
cameraman, he edits the film. The !
result is a highly provocative I
whole which reflects throughout 1
his own personality and outlook)
on life.
lie has been called "one of the
most peculiarly gifted and demo-1
niacal creative movie-makers of!
modern times," "the dominant j
einematographer today," and his j
films have earned praise as a few
of the great motion pictures of
our time.
A deep emotional experience
for their viewers, Bergman's films
make fantasy and symbolism ■
powerful weapons of expression.
Bergman demands that his audi-j
enee pay strict attention.
This, and his searching themes, j
may account for the fact that in i
Sweden (Bergman's home) sev
eral of his pictures have lost
money at the box office, oven
though they have been applauded
by the critics.
A believer tortured by doubts,
Bergman insists that any dra
matic work that avoids the rela
tionship of human being to God is
nonsense. He declares, "I will
never give up this discussion."
Born in 1918 in the university
town of Uppsala, he was brought
up strictly in a vicarage, which
later made him a rebel against j
organized religion. In 1937 he sat
what is known in Swedish as stu
dentexamen (the Swedish equivi
lent of the American 8.A.) and j
then went on to study literature
at the University of Stockholm. I

He finally left home and the uni
versity for the theater.
Svensk Filmindustri, Ihe oldest
and one of the most important
film producers in Sweden, hired
him as a member of the script
department in 1913.
In 1944 his first script was
made into the film "Torment,"
which was shown throughout the
world with great success.
The following year he had his
first chance to direct.
In 1948 came an important mile
stone, "Prison," the first all-Berg
man production. The next came
two years later with "Summer
Interlude," story of teen-age lov
ers' happiness and tragedy.
His first comedy came in 1952,
and the next year he wrote what
is perhaps his most "commercial"
film, "A Lesson in Love," a
comedy of manners.
"Smiles of a Summer Night"
was awarded the special prize by
the jury of the Cannes Film Fes
tival of 1956, and the next year
"The Seventh Seal" got the same
award.
In 1957 Bergman made "Wild
Strawberries," which received the
Golden Bear award at the Berlin
Film Festival in 1958. For this
film he persuaded Sweden's grand
old man of films, Victor Sjostrom
(who died at the age of 80 Jan.
3), to undertake the main part.
"Wild Strawberries," highly
symbolic and dream-like, was a
great success in this area. It
leaves its viewer with a strong
feeling of having seen a part of
life and a profit because of it.
The film does require a good deal
of its audience: the mind cannot
view it passively as it could strict
entertainment.
"Brink of Life" was also made
in 1957. The story of Ihroe pro
spective mothers is extremely
realistic, as opposed to the sym
bolistic "Wild Strawberries."
The last of Bergman's triumphs
to be seen in this country, "The
Magician," will be in San Fran
cisco in about a month.
Bergman uses a small group
of actors and actresses in almost
all his films.
Me despises camera tricks, and
refuses to use either color or the
wide screen.
He has also made a considerable
contribution to the Swedish thea
ter as playwright, producer, man
ager and artistic director of
Malmo Stadsteater, the Munici
pal Theater of Malmo, Sweden,
which is the largest theater in
northern Europe.

at the University of Stockholm. I

He finally left home and the uni
versity for the theater.
Svensk Filmindustri, Ihe oldest
and one of the most important
film producers in Sweden, hired
him as a member of the script
department in 1913.
In 1944 his first script was
made into the film "Torment,"
which was shown throughout the
world with great success.
The following year he had his
first chance to direct.
In 1948 came an important mile
stone, "Prison," the first all-Berg
man production. The next came
two years later with "Summer
Interlude," story of teen-age lov
ers' happiness and tragedy.
His first comedy came in 1952,
and the next year he wrote what
is perhaps his most "commercial"
film, "A Lesson in Love," a
comedy of manners.
"Smiles of a Summer Night"
was awarded the special prize by
the jury of the Cannes Film Fes
tival of 1956, and the next year
"The Seventh Seal" got the same
award.
In 1957 Bergman made "Wild
Strawberries," which received the
Golden Bear award at the Berlin
Film Festival in 1958. For this
film he persuaded Sweden's grand
old man of films, Victor Sjostrom
(who died at the age of 80 Jan.
3), to undertake the main part.
"Wild Strawberries," highly
symbolic and dream-like, was a
great success in this area. It
leaves its viewer with a strong
feeling of having seen a part of
life and a profit because of it.
The film does require a good deal
of its audience: the mind cannot
view it passively as it could strict
entertainment.
"Brink of Life" was also made
in 1957. The story of Ihroe pro
spective mothers is extremely
realistic, as opposed to the sym
bolistic "Wild Strawberries."
The last of Bergman's triumphs
to be seen in this country, "The
Magician," will be in San Fran
cisco in about a month.
Bergman uses a small group
of actors and actresses in almost
all his films.
Me despises camera tricks, and
refuses to use either color or the
wide screen.
He has also made a considerable
contribution to the Swedish thea
ter as playwright, producer, man
ager and artistic director of
Malmo Stadsteater, the Munici
pal Theater of Malmo, Sweden,
which is the largest theater in
northern Europe.

Ingmar Bergman, "poet with a
camera," has found sudden inter
national fame.
It comes mostly from two films
which have been in San Francisco
and Palo Alto art theaters in the
last several months: first "The
Seventh Seal," study of a Crusad
er's search for God, second, "Wild
Strawberries," story of a lonely
old man's self-analysis.
These films deal with the ques
tion which Bergman asks most
earnestly on the screen and in
his own life: that of man's rela
tion to woman and to God.
Bergman has directed 21 films,
13 of them from his own scripts,
but he controls all phases of the
production to some degree. He
instructs the set designer, the j
composer. He is partially his own 1
cameraman, he edits the film. The !
result is a highly provocative I
whole which reflects throughout 1
his own personality and outlook)
on life.
lie has been called "one of the
most peculiarly gifted and demo-1
niacal creative movie-makers of!
modern times," "the dominant j
einematographer today," and his j
films have earned praise as a few
of the great motion pictures of
our time.
A deep emotional experience
for their viewers, Bergman's films
make fantasy and symbolism ■
powerful weapons of expression.
Bergman demands that his audi-j
enee pay strict attention.
This, and his searching themes, j
may account for the fact that in i
Sweden (Bergman's home) sev
eral of his pictures have lost
money at the box office, oven
though they have been applauded
by the critics.
A believer tortured by doubts,
Bergman insists that any dra
matic work that avoids the rela
tionship of human being to God is
nonsense. He declares, "I will
never give up this discussion."
Born in 1918 in the university
town of Uppsala, he was brought
up strictly in a vicarage, which
later made him a rebel against j
organized religion. In 1937 he sat
what is known in Swedish as stu
dentexamen (the Swedish equivi
lent of the American 8.A.) and j
then went on to study literature
at the University of Stockholm. I

He finally left home and the uni
versity for the theater.
Svensk Filmindustri, Ihe oldest
and one of the most important
film producers in Sweden, hired
him as a member of the script
department in 1913.
In 1944 his first script was
made into the film "Torment,"
which was shown throughout the
world with great success.
The following year he had his
first chance to direct.
In 1948 came an important mile
stone, "Prison," the first all-Berg
man production. The next came
two years later with "Summer
Interlude," story of teen-age lov
ers' happiness and tragedy.
His first comedy came in 1952,
and the next year he wrote what
is perhaps his most "commercial"
film, "A Lesson in Love," a
comedy of manners.
"Smiles of a Summer Night"
was awarded the special prize by
the jury of the Cannes Film Fes
tival of 1956, and the next year
"The Seventh Seal" got the same
award.
In 1957 Bergman made "Wild
Strawberries," which received the
Golden Bear award at the Berlin
Film Festival in 1958. For this
film he persuaded Sweden's grand
old man of films, Victor Sjostrom
(who died at the age of 80 Jan.
3), to undertake the main part.
"Wild Strawberries," highly
symbolic and dream-like, was a
great success in this area. It
leaves its viewer with a strong
feeling of having seen a part of
life and a profit because of it.
The film does require a good deal
of its audience: the mind cannot
view it passively as it could strict
entertainment.
"Brink of Life" was also made
in 1957. The story of Ihroe pro
spective mothers is extremely
realistic, as opposed to the sym
bolistic "Wild Strawberries."
The last of Bergman's triumphs
to be seen in this country, "The
Magician," will be in San Fran
cisco in about a month.
Bergman uses a small group
of actors and actresses in almost
all his films.
Me despises camera tricks, and
refuses to use either color or the
wide screen.
He has also made a considerable
contribution to the Swedish thea
ter as playwright, producer, man
ager and artistic director of
Malmo Stadsteater, the Munici
pal Theater of Malmo, Sweden,
which is the largest theater in
northern Europe.
