# Hostels: Thought-Provoking Retreats
## 
### Daryl Glenney 
A learning situation in a so
eluded area; a small group of
enthusiastic' students retreating
from the rigors of campus life;
informal and engrossing discus- 1
sions with faculty members and
professional people; recreation j
and fellowship. A college stu-!
dent's drean. Not a dream at'
Stanford, where such a situation
exists under the Hostels Program.
Arranged and executed by tho
newly-created ASSU Hostels
Board, several thought-provoking
"retreats" are scheduled each
quarter, for groups of individuals
on student-faculty hoslels, and
for organizations and clubs on or- j
ganization hostels. Both plans are
dedicated to providing students !
with opportunities for intellectual
expansion impossible in the class
room.
Student-faculty hostels were

originated to create a quiet at
mosphere for fellow students to
ask questions through flexible
but directed programs and to talk
informally with people with ex
tensive backgrounds in specific
fields. The program provides an
exchange of views through dis
cussion, not lectures.
Second Purpose
A secondary purpose, which
naturally evolves from the ful
fillment of other purposes, is to
promote better student-faculty
relationships. In addition, the
hostels help undergraduates, par
ticularly freshmen, to meet sen
ior members of the faculty and,
often, outstanding community
figures.
A typical student-faculty hostel
begins around 6 p.m. on a Friday
evening, when 15 or so men and
women, both undergrads and
grads, clamor into three or four

cars and "head for the hills."
Although previous hostels have
been hold at Napa, this year's
hostels will be situated in tem
porary sites anywhere between
the campus and Big Sur until a
permanent site can be built.
After their arrival at the desig
nated site, they enjoy an evening
of informal discussion of selected
topics with two or three faculty
members or specialists in perti
nent fields. Students benefit from
similiar backgrounds provided
by study from reading lists rlis
tributed before the hostel session.
Dinner is provided by student
cooks, or even by the faculty.
Saturday morning's agenda fol
lows the same pattern, supple
mented by sports and recrea

tional activities. Students return
to campus about noon.
Organization hostels, conducted
in much the same manner, are
offered to allow groups to formu
late cohesive programs for the
year, as well as to become better
acquainted within themselves.
Program Here Unique
Although hostels are common
throughout Europe, and some
Eastern schools have a similar
plan for ski groups, the program
at Stanford is unique in the way

i in which it is oxocuted. The
1 Hostels Program was originally
j an outgrowth of the foreign stu
dent program. Only last year did
Legislature create ;i separate
I lostels Board, headed by grad
student John Nickerson.
Primarily a planning organiza
tion, the present hoard includes
only a chairman, a secretary
treasurer. and members in charge
:of faculty hostels, organization
hostels, food and general arrange
| meuts, and publicity.

Student-faculty hostels were

originated to create a quiet at
mosphere for fellow students to
ask questions through flexible
but directed programs and to talk
informally with people with ex
tensive backgrounds in specific
fields. The program provides an
exchange of views through dis
cussion, not lectures.
Second Purpose
A secondary purpose, which
naturally evolves from the ful
fillment of other purposes, is to
promote better student-faculty
relationships. In addition, the
hostels help undergraduates, par
ticularly freshmen, to meet sen
ior members of the faculty and,
often, outstanding community
figures.
A typical student-faculty hostel
begins around 6 p.m. on a Friday
evening, when 15 or so men and
women, both undergrads and
grads, clamor into three or four

cars and "head for the hills."
Although previous hostels have
been hold at Napa, this year's
hostels will be situated in tem
porary sites anywhere between
the campus and Big Sur until a
permanent site can be built.
After their arrival at the desig
nated site, they enjoy an evening
of informal discussion of selected
topics with two or three faculty
members or specialists in perti
nent fields. Students benefit from
similiar backgrounds provided
by study from reading lists rlis
tributed before the hostel session.
Dinner is provided by student
cooks, or even by the faculty.
Saturday morning's agenda fol
lows the same pattern, supple
mented by sports and recrea

tional activities. Students return
to campus about noon.
Organization hostels, conducted
in much the same manner, are
offered to allow groups to formu
late cohesive programs for the
year, as well as to become better
acquainted within themselves.
Program Here Unique
Although hostels are common
throughout Europe, and some
Eastern schools have a similar
plan for ski groups, the program
at Stanford is unique in the way

i in which it is oxocuted. The
1 Hostels Program was originally
j an outgrowth of the foreign stu
dent program. Only last year did
Legislature create ;i separate
I lostels Board, headed by grad
student John Nickerson.
Primarily a planning organiza
tion, the present hoard includes
only a chairman, a secretary
treasurer. and members in charge
:of faculty hostels, organization
hostels, food and general arrange
| meuts, and publicity.
A learning situation in a so
eluded area; a small group of
enthusiastic' students retreating
from the rigors of campus life;
informal and engrossing discus- 1
sions with faculty members and
professional people; recreation j
and fellowship. A college stu-!
dent's drean. Not a dream at'
Stanford, where such a situation
exists under the Hostels Program.
Arranged and executed by tho
newly-created ASSU Hostels
Board, several thought-provoking
"retreats" are scheduled each
quarter, for groups of individuals
on student-faculty hoslels, and
for organizations and clubs on or- j
ganization hostels. Both plans are
dedicated to providing students !
with opportunities for intellectual
expansion impossible in the class
room.
