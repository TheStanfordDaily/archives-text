## The
						Policy on Drinking 
### Doug Willis 
A news item appeared in last |
Tuesday's Daily reporting lhal
the Sigma Nu fraternity house
had been placed on indefinite pro- j
bation after an Interfraternity
Board investigation of the general
record of the house. The investi
gation was an outgrowth of t ho j
death of John Opsahl on Nov. 20
and resulted in the placing of the j
fraternity in the hands of an
alumni "receivership" eommilteei
and under a strict probation.
The Sigma Nu's will be permit
ted to rush, but they must face a
montidy review by the IFB and
they could bo permanently dis-1
solved for violation of any of the
conditions of the probation.
The death of John Opsahl
points out the seriousness of
the drinking problem at Stan
ford. Therefore we cannot
honestly argue that the Sigma
IV ii probation was too severe.
It is clear that drastic steps
were warranted.
However, we cannot help feel
ing sorry for the one unlucky
fraternity that has been stuck
with the responsibility for a prob
lem that exists in nearly every
living group on campus.
We would guess that the pres
sure of public (and rich alumni)
opinion forced drastic action
against the Sigma Nu's. But we
doubt that an inconsistent Uni
versity policy which ignores some
instances of drinking and gives
out severe penalties in other cases
will solve any problems.
Some University officials
have said off the record that
the University would prefer a
policy of moderation if it were
consistent with state laws, and
that, because of t lie problem of
enforcement, this is the only
policy that the University has
the means to put into effect.
Obviously, the University can
not stop every case of under-age
or on-campus drinking. But there
is a question: Should officials
tacitly allow illegal drinking and
take action only against extreme
offenders?
A policy of moderation, whether
tacitly understood or explicitly
stated by the University, appears
to be the only practical and en
forceable stand for Stanford on
the drinking question. But we j
feel that such a policy is incom- j
patible with Stanford's frequent !
sensitivity to public opinion.
We feel that Stanford must j
make its policy clear 011 drink- j
ing. And must do if in spite of 1
adverse reactions, whether with
in or outside of the University.
Most important, harsh punish
ments such as the Sigma Nu
house received should not be
made in response to public opin
ion alone.
We believe that if a policy of
moderation is supported by the
University, Ihen only violators of
this policy should be punished
and punished well.
This appears to be what has
happened this year to the Sigma
Nu house and last year following
the Los Altos Union Hall Party.
We only wish that this policy
were explicitly stated, so that we
all know where we stand and
what to expect.
A Stern K.A. gave us a criti
cal view of University policy:
"If you tacitly say that students
can drink," he said, "then you
must accept all of the responsi
bilities and the problems that
go with it because you have
postulated that it is basically
right.
"The cause of a lot of Stan
ford's drinking problems is that
the University has tried to apply
adult psyhcology to basically ado
lescent persons," the 11.A. con
tinued. "There is a relatively
large group at Stanford that is
socially sensitive. They are easily
convinced that drinking is socially
clever."
You cannot solve the drinking
problem of these persons by sup
porting a policy of moderation, he
explained, because, to them, Ihe
more you drink, the more you are
socially clever.
"The University has taken
the position, 'We didn't make I

the law, we aren't tfoing to en
force it.' I have heard Univer
sity persons tell my house in
Stern, 'We allow you to drink,
but if you get caught you will
get thrown out.'
"The only fair position is, 'You
may not drink.' Then you know
where you stand."
A comment from a former Uni
versity R.A. could aptly settle any
discussion of the drinking issue:
"There is nothing else we could
possibly do. No matter what the
right and wrong of drinking is, a
tact policy of moderation is the
only policy Stanford can enforce."
