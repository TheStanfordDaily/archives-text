After battling to ga»i a 25-24
halftime lead, Stanford's Indians
pocketed only 8 points in Ihe first
12 minutes of Hio second-half
play Saturday night and ended up
on th( v short end of a 52-43 de
cision to the» California Bears.

to warm up, the on-target Bears
had stuffed in 20 counters and
gotten to a position the Stanford

pour-it-on finish.

A packed house in the cracker
box saw the Bears apparently
break a Pavilion .jinx which
amounted to four losses in six
tries since Pete Newell took over
in Berkeley.
Stanford even started in a hole.
The Indians were 6 points behind
before they got on the score board
at all, and were down 13-3 before
they began to hit with any con
sistency.
Jump-shot artist Tandy Gill is
led the national champion Bear's
attack, and was high-point man
for the game, with 14 counters.
Stanford guard John Arrillaga,
with his eye recovered enough to
wear both contact lenses, hit for
13.

To gain their advantage over
the Bears, Stanford allowed the
visitors only one bucket in five
minutes while it bagged 10 points
to surge ahead at 21-19. Cal
traded leads once, but John
Hendry's 25-foot set shot with a
minute to go put the Cards in
t he lead.
Stanford did a good job of hold
ing down big center Darrall Im
hoff and equally dangerous for
ward Bill McClintock. Imhoff
added only 6 counters to the Cal
effort, McClintock gathered in
but 7.
The rest of the Cal club, includ
ing Gillis, was a little hotter, and
in fact couldn't seem to miss. The
jump shooter was 7 for 8; (5-2
guard Jerry Mann was 3 for 4;
and so on.
Overall the Bears were 21 for
53, averaging 41.2 per cent; Stan
ford bucketed only 16 shots in 52
tries for a 30.8 mark.
Stanford out-defensed the na

tional defense leaders on the way
to the halftime advantage, grab
bing 24 rebounds to Cal's 19. The
end-of-game mark was a 43-36
edge for the Bears.
