California Frosh Saturday.
Cal center, Camden Wall, a
doubtful starter because of an

offer. Guard Dick Smith scored
11 for Cal.
Clementson Leads
Don Clementson led Stanford's
attack with 15 points, and was
closely followed by Hob Sommers
with 14 and Chuck Wilson with
13. Sommers was switched from
forward to center to replace Stan
ford's regular 1 center, Roger Head,
ailing with brochitis. Wilson be
came the fifth starter when he re
placed Head in the starting line
up.

and rolled up a 6-0 lead before

the early spurt. The margin
widened to 16-6 as Darrell Suth
erland started to get hot for- the
first time this year. He hit six
quick points.

Wilson hit a jumper from the
corner and a free throw, to make
it 21-13. Then Clementson hit a
tipin and a jump shot, while
