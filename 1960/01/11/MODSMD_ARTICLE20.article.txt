## 
### 
In coast basketball action Satur-1
flay evening, tJSC nipped a hard
fighting Washington H u sky
squad, 69-68, on center Jim Man
na's last secon jump shot, and
Oregon's Ducks edged a pesky
Washington State team, 68-64.
At Seattle the Trojans handed
the Huskies their second straight
one-point loss. It marked the
fourth loss in the last four en
counters by a margin of only five
points for th unlucky Washington
team.
Neither loam was able to open j
a wide scoring margin, and the'
game was a see-saw affair!
throughout. The Huskies man
aged to scrape to a 39-38 half-time
lead by virtue of eGorge Grant's
two free tosses afler the buzzer.
The second period was much
like the first as both teams traded
ihe lead position until Washing
ton looked to be sure winners
when the Huskies big center Rill |
Hanson pumped in a shot from
the "field with only five seconds
remaining.
But then Hanna got the ball and
jumped high to sink the winning
counter and bag the contest for !
the Trojans.
