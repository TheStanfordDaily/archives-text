Professor Â«nd Mrs. Harry J.
Rathbun vvili speak tonight at 8 in
Cubberley Auditorium on the
topic "Men and Women: Prob
lems of the Sexes." The talk is
being sponsored by the Stanford
YWCA.
"This subject is always very
much in students' minds. Students
in college have two basic con
cerns: their vocation and their
marriage. This talk will explore
the second of these goals, and the
problems connected with it," said
Rathbun.
The talk will relate the current
ethical standards to those of the
past, and will consider the impact
of modern psychological thinking
on these standards, Rathbun
stated.
"We feel that there is a real
problem of loneliness on campus,
between men and women espe
cially. This discussion will help
us explore the problem and find
out how more people feel about
it," said Gail Stephens, YWCA
president.
Rathbun lias taught at Stan
ford for 30 years, and is Professor
of Law Emeritus. He is a Doctor
of Jurisprudence and holds a de
