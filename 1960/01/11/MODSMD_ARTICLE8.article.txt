complexity of modern business

Anderson also gave the advis
ors an idea of the kind of things
the School looks for in applicants

cation is desirable, he said. He
emphasized that an applicant
does not have to major in busi
ness while an undergraduate or
even take business courses, that
the desirable -student is one with
a broad background, in school
and outside.
