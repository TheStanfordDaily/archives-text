# KZSU to Return Officially Today
## 
### Austin Scott 
KZSU, Radio Stanford, 880 on
your AM dial, will return to the
air officially today for the first
time since September, 1958, ac
cording to Dave Lindgren, station
manager. The station will broad
cast from 5-11 p.m. Monday
through Friday.
Initially, only Toyon, Crothers,
Branner, Wilbur and Florence
Moore will be covered. KZSU is
building more transmitters and
plans to cover Stern, Union, Lag
unit a, Roble and the Kow as soon
as possible.
KZSU is under the jurisdiction
ol the Speech and Drama depart
ment, but is entirely student op
erated. Students will do all
writing, programming, and an
| nouncing, and design and build
; much of KZSU's equipment. Ac
i tivily credit is given for this
work.
Carrier Current
KZSU is a carrier-current sta
tion. It differs from a regular
broadcast station in that it does
not send its broadcasts through
the air from a central transmitter.
I Instead, it sends its signal through
| transmission lines to transmitters

located in each dormitory. The
transmitters feed the broadcasts
into the regular electricity wires.
These wires send out radio waves
for a very short distance, and the
waves are picked up by nearby
radios.
The station was conceived in
October, 1946, by a group of stu
dents interested in professional
radio experience. They built KSU,
as it was then called, over the
1946 Christmas holidays. KSU
first went on the air Jan. 6, 1947,
at 590 kilocycles, with only five
minutes to spare between the
installation of the last transmitter
and the first scheduled program.
Modest Start
Original equipment consisted of
one microphone, one borrowed
j control board, several spools of
i wire, two homemade turntables
i and a 12 by 12 studio in Stanford
J Village.
KSU moved to its present Mem
orial Hall studios in April, 1947.
In January, 1948, they switched to
a new frequency. In May, 1949,
they became KZSU. By March,
1947, KZSU had transmitters in
every campus dorm and in Stan
j ford Village.
Annoys FCC
In 1954, KZSU got into the first
of its scrapes with the University
and the FCC which resulted in
the shutdown of the station in
| September, 1958. Carrier current

stations do not come under tho
jurisdiction of the FCC, but they
must not interfere with the opera
tion 01 licensed broadcast stations.
The transmission wires running
through the dormitories were
found by the FCC during a rou
tine check to be "radiating" or
leaking radio waves into the air,
thus competing with the air
wave broadcasting of regular
radio stations. The FCC com
plained to the University, which
notified KZSU and proper adjust
ments were made.
Interference
But KZSU did not have equip
ment to check its signal strength.
Each time the station added a
transmitter, or made adjustments,
it ran the risk of interfering with
other stations. KZSU would
simply wait until the FCC com
plained to the University, and
then use FCC technical informa
tion to make the necessary ad
justments.
During 1957-58, the station was
plagued by breakdowns and thefts
of equipment. Bcause of this and
the trouble with the FCC, the Uni
versity decided to take KZSU
temporarily off the air in Sep
tember, 1958.
Since then, various proposals
have been made to remedy some

of KZSU's earlier troubles. The
one that has met with most favor
has been to turn KZSU into a
commercial FM station. This pro
posal is still under study.
New Equipment
KZSU has taken steps lo cor
rect some of the troubles that
plagued it during its last year of
operation. Most of the equipment
has been rebuilt or replaced. The
station has purchased the equip
ment necessary to measure signal
strength. The KZSU staff is
building new transmitters for
each dormitory, and will install
them as soon as they are com
pleted.
KZSU plans to expand its broad
cast day along with its coverage.
Programming this quarter will be
varied, with the emphasis on
music. There will be occasional
dramas, a show devoted to high
lights of old Gaieties shows and a
special show using tapes and rec
ords from the Music Department's
collection of recitals and concerts.
Music events will be taped and
broadcast at a later date.
KZSU will broadcast varsity
basketball games on Fridays and
Saturdays. There will be sports
news in addition to five-minute
newscasts and fifteen-minute
commentaries.

KZSU Station Manager Dave
Lindgren announces the follow
ing program schedule lor to
day:
5 p.m. "On the Brink"—music,
light classics to jazz.

KZSU'S 'STUDIO A'
Station returns to air today
KZSU, Radio Stanford, 880 on
your AM dial, will return to the
air officially today for the first
time since September, 1958, ac
cording to Dave Lindgren, station
manager. The station will broad
cast from 5-11 p.m. Monday
through Friday.
Initially, only Toyon, Crothers,
Branner, Wilbur and Florence
Moore will be covered. KZSU is
building more transmitters and
plans to cover Stern, Union, Lag
unit a, Roble and the Kow as soon
as possible.
KZSU is under the jurisdiction
ol the Speech and Drama depart
ment, but is entirely student op
erated. Students will do all
writing, programming, and an
| nouncing, and design and build
; much of KZSU's equipment. Ac
i tivily credit is given for this
work.
Carrier Current
KZSU is a carrier-current sta
tion. It differs from a regular
broadcast station in that it does
not send its broadcasts through
the air from a central transmitter.
I Instead, it sends its signal through
| transmission lines to transmitters

located in each dormitory. The
transmitters feed the broadcasts
into the regular electricity wires.
These wires send out radio waves
for a very short distance, and the
waves are picked up by nearby
radios.
The station was conceived in
October, 1946, by a group of stu
dents interested in professional
radio experience. They built KSU,
as it was then called, over the
1946 Christmas holidays. KSU
first went on the air Jan. 6, 1947,
at 590 kilocycles, with only five
minutes to spare between the
installation of the last transmitter
and the first scheduled program.
Modest Start
Original equipment consisted of
one microphone, one borrowed
j control board, several spools of
i wire, two homemade turntables
i and a 12 by 12 studio in Stanford
J Village.
KSU moved to its present Mem
orial Hall studios in April, 1947.
In January, 1948, they switched to
a new frequency. In May, 1949,
they became KZSU. By March,
1947, KZSU had transmitters in
every campus dorm and in Stan
j ford Village.
Annoys FCC
In 1954, KZSU got into the first
of its scrapes with the University
and the FCC which resulted in
the shutdown of the station in
| September, 1958. Carrier current

stations do not come under tho
jurisdiction of the FCC, but they
must not interfere with the opera
tion 01 licensed broadcast stations.
The transmission wires running
through the dormitories were
found by the FCC during a rou
tine check to be "radiating" or
leaking radio waves into the air,
thus competing with the air
wave broadcasting of regular
radio stations. The FCC com
plained to the University, which
notified KZSU and proper adjust
ments were made.
Interference
But KZSU did not have equip
ment to check its signal strength.
Each time the station added a
transmitter, or made adjustments,
it ran the risk of interfering with
other stations. KZSU would
simply wait until the FCC com
plained to the University, and
then use FCC technical informa
tion to make the necessary ad
justments.
During 1957-58, the station was
plagued by breakdowns and thefts
of equipment. Bcause of this and
the trouble with the FCC, the Uni
versity decided to take KZSU
temporarily off the air in Sep
tember, 1958.

first went on the air Jan. 6, 1947,
at 590 kilocycles, with only five
minutes to spare between the
installation of the last transmitter
and the first scheduled program.
Modest Start
Original equipment consisted of
one microphone, one borrowed
j control board, several spools of
i wire, two homemade turntables
i and a 12 by 12 studio in Stanford
J Village.
KSU moved to its present Mem
orial Hall studios in April, 1947.
In January, 1948, they switched to
a new frequency. In May, 1949,
they became KZSU. By March,
1947, KZSU had transmitters in
every campus dorm and in Stan
j ford Village.
Annoys FCC
In 1954, KZSU got into the first
of its scrapes with the University
and the FCC which resulted in
the shutdown of the station in
| September, 1958. Carrier current

stations do not come under tho
jurisdiction of the FCC, but they
must not interfere with the opera
tion 01 licensed broadcast stations.
The transmission wires running
through the dormitories were
found by the FCC during a rou
tine check to be "radiating" or
leaking radio waves into the air,
thus competing with the air
wave broadcasting of regular
radio stations. The FCC com
plained to the University, which
notified KZSU and proper adjust
ments were made.
Interference
But KZSU did not have equip
ment to check its signal strength.
Each time the station added a
transmitter, or made adjustments,
it ran the risk of interfering with
other stations. KZSU would
simply wait until the FCC com
plained to the University, and
then use FCC technical informa
tion to make the necessary ad
justments.
During 1957-58, the station was
plagued by breakdowns and thefts
of equipment. Bcause of this and
the trouble with the FCC, the Uni
versity decided to take KZSU
temporarily off the air in Sep
tember, 1958.
Since then, various proposals
have been made to remedy some

of KZSU's earlier troubles. The
one that has met with most favor
has been to turn KZSU into a
commercial FM station. This pro
posal is still under study.
New Equipment
KZSU has taken steps lo cor
rect some of the troubles that
plagued it during its last year of
operation. Most of the equipment
has been rebuilt or replaced. The
station has purchased the equip
ment necessary to measure signal
strength. The KZSU staff is
building new transmitters for
each dormitory, and will install
them as soon as they are com
pleted.
KZSU plans to expand its broad
cast day along with its coverage.
Programming this quarter will be
varied, with the emphasis on
music. There will be occasional
dramas, a show devoted to high
lights of old Gaieties shows and a
special show using tapes and rec
ords from the Music Department's
collection of recitals and concerts.
Music events will be taped and
broadcast at a later date.
KZSU will broadcast varsity
basketball games on Fridays and
Saturdays. There will be sports
news in addition to five-minute
newscasts and fifteen-minute
commentaries.

KZSU'S 'STUDIO A'
Station returns to air today
KZSU, Radio Stanford, 880 on
your AM dial, will return to the
air officially today for the first
time since September, 1958, ac
cording to Dave Lindgren, station
manager. The station will broad
cast from 5-11 p.m. Monday
through Friday.
Initially, only Toyon, Crothers,
Branner, Wilbur and Florence
Moore will be covered. KZSU is
building more transmitters and
plans to cover Stern, Union, Lag
unit a, Roble and the Kow as soon
as possible.
KZSU is under the jurisdiction
ol the Speech and Drama depart
ment, but is entirely student op
erated. Students will do all
writing, programming, and an
| nouncing, and design and build
; much of KZSU's equipment. Ac
i tivily credit is given for this
work.
Carrier Current
KZSU is a carrier-current sta
tion. It differs from a regular
broadcast station in that it does
not send its broadcasts through
the air from a central transmitter.
I Instead, it sends its signal through
| transmission lines to transmitters

located in each dormitory. The
transmitters feed the broadcasts
into the regular electricity wires.
These wires send out radio waves
for a very short distance, and the
waves are picked up by nearby
radios.
