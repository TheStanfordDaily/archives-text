"Love is widely encompassing.
It has been enunicated by reli
gious geniuses for 25 centuries.
Physchology seconds the view
that the basis for sound human
relationships is the giving and
taking of love."
In this way, Professor Harry
J. Rathbun introduced a discus
sion presented by himself and
Mrs. Rathbun on the topic, "Men
|and Women: Problems of the
j Sexes." Held last night in Cubber-
I ley Auditorium.
The Rathbuns' discussion con
sidered the nature of the love
j of God and man, the evolution of
! ethics, the role of masculinity and
| femininity, and the meaning of
i marriage.
Etliics and Consciousness
Rathbun said that eithics in
dicate the growing expansion of
! man's consciousness. "Man's func
i t ion is to grow up out of ignor
ance, and to find out more and
more about reality so that he
can deal with it,"he said.
"The key word is Love," stated
Rathbun defined the expression
of love for God as the recognition
of a force in control of the uni
] verse, encompassing law, life,
light, and love.
Mrs. Rathbun spoke on the
qualities of masculinity and fem
ininity. She stated that "A civili
zation is as strong as its women."
Male and Female Roles
"A woman's role is synthesis,
; and her aproach to life is emo-
I tional ancl artistic. Man's ap
proach is scientific and analytical.
Neither man nor woman is whole
i until each learns the qualities
jof the other and incorporates
i them into himself," she said.
Seminars on the subjects in
troduced by the Rathbuns will be
held on tho three coming Mon
days, according to Gail Stephens,
! YWCA president. They will be
led by Professor and Mrs. Edwin
; Goorl, Professor and Mrs. Nathan
i Maecoby, and Professor and Mrs.
; Jeffrey Smith.
