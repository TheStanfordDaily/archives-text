# U.S. Will Not Protest Soviet Rocket Tests
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — The United States—because of its own mis
sile and nuclear weapons tests in the Atlantic and Pacific—has
slight ground to protest Soviet plans to shoot test rockets into the
Pacific, two key members of Congress said yesterday.
U.S. diplomatic officials indicated this government will not pro-

test the Soviet lest plans. These
officials, too, noted the United
States is using the seas for mili
tary and scientific tests.
"What's sauce for the goose is
sauce for the gander," said Chair
man Overton Brooks (D-La.) of
the House Space Committee at a
news conference.
"If my understanding of the sit
uation is correct, what the Rus
sians propose to do is what we
have done," Sen. Francis Case (R-
S.D.) told the Senate. Case is a
member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
New Speculation
Brooks and Case spoke out amid
new speculation over what may
he behind the latest Soviet move.
There were suggestions the forth
coming Soviet rocket tests in the
central Pacific may signal a new
gambit in the missile diplomacy
the Soviet Union has used before.
Some U.S. officials noted ihe
tests are bracketed by the Soviets
in the month starting Friday—a
month that will see the signing of
a new 10-year security pact be
tween the United States and Ja
pan, and the start of a visit by
Soviet Premier Nikita Khru
shchev to Indonesia.
Achievements Fresh
Also, any spectacular new space
achievements the Soviets may
score would be fresh in mind when
diplomats begin a series of talks
pointed toward the East-West
summit conference in May and
President Eisenhower's expected
visit to the Soviet Union next
June.
Soviet Ambassador Mikhail
Menshikov visited Eisenhower
yesterday to deliver an oral good
will message from Khrushchev.
Questioned by newsmen when he
left the White House, Menshikov
said he and the President did not
discuss the Soviet plans to hold

slight ground to protest Soviet plans to shoot test rockets into the
Pacific, two key members of Congress said yesterday.
U.S. diplomatic officials indicated this government will not pro-

test the Soviet lest plans. These
officials, too, noted the United
States is using the seas for mili
tary and scientific tests.
"What's sauce for the goose is
sauce for the gander," said Chair
man Overton Brooks (D-La.) of
the House Space Committee at a
news conference.
"If my understanding of the sit
uation is correct, what the Rus
sians propose to do is what we
have done," Sen. Francis Case (R-
S.D.) told the Senate. Case is a
member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
New Speculation
Brooks and Case spoke out amid
new speculation over what may
he behind the latest Soviet move.
There were suggestions the forth
coming Soviet rocket tests in the
central Pacific may signal a new
gambit in the missile diplomacy
the Soviet Union has used before.
Some U.S. officials noted ihe
tests are bracketed by the Soviets
in the month starting Friday—a
month that will see the signing of
a new 10-year security pact be
tween the United States and Ja
pan, and the start of a visit by
Soviet Premier Nikita Khru
shchev to Indonesia.
Achievements Fresh
Also, any spectacular new space
achievements the Soviets may
score would be fresh in mind when
diplomats begin a series of talks
pointed toward the East-West
summit conference in May and
President Eisenhower's expected
visit to the Soviet Union next
June.
Soviet Ambassador Mikhail
Menshikov visited Eisenhower
yesterday to deliver an oral good
will message from Khrushchev.
Questioned by newsmen when he
left the White House, Menshikov
said he and the President did not
discuss the Soviet plans to hold
rocket tests in the Pacific.
