Stanford's Hostels program lias made a noticeable improve
ment this year, particular!) this quarter. Three programs in the
next four weeks dealing witli specific and controversial subjects
like "The (lollege Student in an Kra of Mass Education" 1 and
"Are Labor Unions Monopolies?" are prodding educational
opportunities which have been described in detail in articles
vesterdav and today.
What is not well known is the problem Hostels Hoard has
met in Irving to »et facullv members as discussion leaders.
In Irving to set up a full program for winter and spring
quarters, the board has contacted numerous I diversity personnel,
hut has been greeted with both valid and nol-so-valid excuses
much of the time.
Asa result, il has been necessar\ to go outside the University
to get inaiiN of the leaders who are scheduled to appear. (<er
lainlv there is nothing wrong with leaders from outside the
campus hut il does seem strange that Hostels Hoard is forced
to look elsewhere for help when there -liould lie plent\ available
right at home.
This is not intended as a blanket casligalion of professors or
administrators who have refused to lead hostels, ('.crtainlv many
have had legitimate reasons lor refusing other commitlmcnts,
publishers" deadlines approaching, and so forth. Some have said
tliev were not well-enough versed in the topic scheduled, and
others sav tliev are not effective fn small groups.
In inaiiv of the refusals, however, land about 'XI percent of
those approached refuse) there is evident disinterest in the pro
gram. Some frunklv admit this, or others do as one professor did
he said he must stav home week-ends to mow his lawn.
Interestingly enough, bv far the best response comes from
high-level administration. Dean W inbigler, for example, is co
leading this week-end's hostel. And President Sterling lias ex
pressed definite interest in leading a program. But from profes
sors, there lias been far less interest.
Potential leaders had complained in the past about spending
two nights on a hostel, or having to travel some distance to the
site. So hostels have been cut to one night, and are being held
closer to campus hut it doesn't seem to he doing much good.
It is significant to note that professors have often expressed
a desire to become more familiar with their students. The excel
lent opportunity presented bv the hostels program, however, is
neglected b\ many as a means of knowing students better. In
some eases, professors are so busy with conferences and other
hostels with off-campus groups that they have no time for the
program here at home.
Again, we do not mean to condemn I niversitv personnel as
a group. Many have legitimate reasons for avoiding hostels, and
Others, though they are fewer in number, are already cooperating
with the program. To the present Iv unresponsive and un interested
group, we recommend a careful perusal of the hostels program,
along with a hope lliat von will sec lit to take a more active
interest in il.

What is not well known is the problem Hostels Hoard has
met in Irving to »et facullv members as discussion leaders.
In Irving to set up a full program for winter and spring
quarters, the board has contacted numerous I diversity personnel,
hut has been greeted with both valid and nol-so-valid excuses
much of the time.
Asa result, il has been necessar\ to go outside the University
to get inaiiN of the leaders who are scheduled to appear. (<er
lainlv there is nothing wrong with leaders from outside the
campus hut il does seem strange that Hostels Hoard is forced
to look elsewhere for help when there -liould lie plent\ available
right at home.
This is not intended as a blanket casligalion of professors or
administrators who have refused to lead hostels, ('.crtainlv many
have had legitimate reasons lor refusing other commitlmcnts,
publishers" deadlines approaching, and so forth. Some have said
tliev were not well-enough versed in the topic scheduled, and
others sav tliev are not effective fn small groups.
In inaiiv of the refusals, however, land about 'XI percent of
those approached refuse) there is evident disinterest in the pro
gram. Some frunklv admit this, or others do as one professor did
he said he must stav home week-ends to mow his lawn.
Interestingly enough, bv far the best response comes from
high-level administration. Dean W inbigler, for example, is co
leading this week-end's hostel. And President Sterling lias ex
pressed definite interest in leading a program. But from profes
sors, there lias been far less interest.
Potential leaders had complained in the past about spending
two nights on a hostel, or having to travel some distance to the
site. So hostels have been cut to one night, and are being held
closer to campus hut it doesn't seem to he doing much good.
It is significant to note that professors have often expressed
a desire to become more familiar with their students. The excel
lent opportunity presented bv the hostels program, however, is
neglected b\ many as a means of knowing students better. In
some eases, professors are so busy with conferences and other
hostels with off-campus groups that they have no time for the
program here at home.
Again, we do not mean to condemn I niversitv personnel as
a group. Many have legitimate reasons for avoiding hostels, and
Others, though they are fewer in number, are already cooperating
with the program. To the present Iv unresponsive and un interested
group, we recommend a careful perusal of the hostels program,
along with a hope lliat von will sec lit to take a more active
interest in il.
Stanford's Hostels program lias made a noticeable improve
ment this year, particular!) this quarter. Three programs in the
next four weeks dealing witli specific and controversial subjects
like "The (lollege Student in an Kra of Mass Education" 1 and
"Are Labor Unions Monopolies?" are prodding educational
opportunities which have been described in detail in articles
vesterdav and today.
