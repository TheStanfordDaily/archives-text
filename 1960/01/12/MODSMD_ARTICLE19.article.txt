# The 						Trouble with Tuesday

### Barbara Hicks 
... Is that it starts so early
in the morning.
Overheard after President Ster
ling's "State of the University"
address Friday: "Ho didn't tell me
what I wanted to hear but I'm
not sure .just what it was I
wanted."
Many of us come away with
that same vague feeling whenever
we hear Dr. Sterling or another
member of the University admin
istration.
Often we do have specific ques
tions, but we realize the limita
tions of a 40-minute talk. And
sometimes our questions, if they
can be put specifically, have no
specific answers, at least not yet.
For example, in his speech
Dr. Sterling might have dis
cussed the policy toward fra
ternities. I have a bet with a
friend who says in five years
fraternities will be gone from
the campus or will be unrecog
nized as fraternities. What does
the University say?
One administration member
will say we should strengthen
fraternities; another says the
fraternities will have to prove
they can contribute to Ihe Uni
versity community; another ad
vocates immediate abolishment.
The general attitude conveyed by
the administration is that of
"we're waiting to see" yet the jest
of us while waiting can't help
but wonder if there aren't some
more definite thoughts as 1o what
future action will be.
Another example is the under
graduate library and other facil
ities. Dr. Sterling mentioned the
need for the library, hut he didn't
tell us when we'd tie moving in.
it asked about the library, ad
ministration officials say it will
be built when there is money

for if. So, says the student,
when will there he money for
it?
The leaders of Ihe University
I have pledged themselves to got
and spend $182 million above the
the present rate of attainment in
the next 10 years. All hough he
| specifically mentioned the union,
i Dr. Sterling outlined mainly gen
eral objectives for which the
money will be used. He indicated
in his talk that the undergraduate
library is a part of the improve
ment of Ihe undergraduate pro
gram. We can deduce from this
that the library will he built with-
I in 10 years.
Of course, this means it is
possible thai even this year's
freshmen will not be able to use
its facilities before they receive
their diplomas. Perhaps I'm
getting philosophical about time
because I've heard talk about
the union, the library and the
bookstore for three and a half
years and only now are any re
sults beginning to show, but a
10-year goal is heartening.
University officials tell students
there is no definite priority list
. for construction of such things as
the library; now needs do develop.
But officials must have some idea
of how important it is to have
the new library. Students can
i help increase the importance of it
1 in the minds of the officials by
j "talking il up."
We can't always gel all Ihe
: answers we'd like, but we can't
afford to stop asking the ques
tions. We may be listened to with
only tolerance as we look ahead
to Iwo or three or four years
while the University looks to 10
or 20, but they can't help but
j listen, and optimist that 1 am, I
! think they want to.
