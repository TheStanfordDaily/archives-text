# Hostels Board Decides Topics
## 
### Daryl Glenney 
The greatest task of Hostels
! Board is programming to reach
all segments of the student body.
For example, scheduled winter
I quarter topics span the fields of
journalism, economics, and educa
-1 tion. Spring quarter programs
: will probably be in the areas of
| history and sociology.
The general trend is toward ]
more specific topics without sac
rificing breadth. Future possibili
ties include a concentrated dis- J
cussion of the Russian satellite
projects, and some type of foreign I
student program.
Another programming respon
-1 sibility is in obtaining varied and
effective speakers. The board
seeks differences but not clashes
] in personality and presentation
in order to induce broader inter
est.
Sources outside of the Univer

sily have been utilized more this
year because of lack of time on
the part of faculty members. A
major goal of the program is to
increase faculty participation.
In developing this relatively
new activity at Stanford, ihe
hostels board is probing a wealth
of ideas for the future. One such
idea is to encourage Western
Civ instructors to join their in
dependent study groups on a
hostel, where discussion could be
stimulated by a more secluded
and informal atmosphere than in
their weekly campus meetings.
Such a plan could also tie carried
out by several students in a large
lecture class, providing an oppor
tunity to get to know the pro
fessor better and promoting
exchange of ideas among indi
viduals rather than an "en
masse" reception of the profes
sor's views.

Oilier possibilities include es
tablishing living group hostels
during which small dorm sections
could meet with their faculty as
sociates, or uniting two Stuttgart
groups on a hostel to compare
experiences. It is hoped that
eventually a ski hostel can be
organized, with an academic pro
gram to supplement the usual
"ski weekend" activities.
Presently under consideration
by the Hostels Board is a plan
whereby students would sign up
at the beginning of the year for
one hostel per quarter, saving a
relative amount by the purchase
of "season tickets." This would
stabilize the overall program and
help predict attendance.
Although still partly experi
mental, the Hostels Program at
Stanford is well on its way to
proving itself, aided by adminis
trative assistance, alumni sup

port, and student enthusiasm. A; j
the end of a five-year period ii
should be clear which students
and which groups would benefit
I most from the program, and
which aspects of the program
would most benefit the students.
The main problem now is to
stimulate interest. By widely pub
licizing the program and wel

coming student suggestions, The
board hopes to expand and im
prove both specific* hostels and
the program in general.
