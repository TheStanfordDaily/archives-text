The stool sti'iko lias boon called
off in a way which leaves the pub
! lie without any means of deter
| mining whether the result is just
jor unjust, wise or unwise. It is
I evident that the companies lost
the strike.
But there does not exist any
impartial and dependable report
on the issues which enables any-
I one from the President down to
know whether the companies
have conceded more than they
could afford to concede.
For the President has stead
fastly refused to countenance of
ficial fact-finding as the basis for
a settlement. As a result, no one
really knows what the Nixon-
Mitchell settlement means. '
The President, so he said last
July, has been acting on the no
tion that there must be no govern
ment intervention because "we
have got thoroughly to tost out
and use the method of free bar
gaining.
We have now had the test.
What happened in the test?
What happened was that the
government intervened in the
person of the Vice President.
He used the carrot for the un
ion and the stick for the com
panies. He coerced tiie com
panies into yielding not all but
most of what the union was
fighting for.
Moreover, it would appear, ho
induced them to agree that they
will not raise steel prices at least
until after the election. The strike
; was not settled by "free bargain
! ing." It was settled by a political
' fix.
The President, whose mind has
; no doubt been on other things,
I seems never to have realized that
|in this struggle the process of free
I bargaining was exhausted very
early in the day almost certainly
j by July when the strike actually
I began.
It was evident from the begin
ing that the two great monop
olies were committed to a test
of power, not to a process of
bargaining. The test was which
of them could hold out the
longer against the other.
In July when the strike began
I there were reasons for thinking
that the companies were the
1 stronger. Their customers had
large stockpiles. Labor unions
i were unpopular as a result of the
MeClellan exposures.
The public was opposed to an
other round of wage-price in
creases. And there was some
question whether Mr. McDonald
was in solid control of his union.
But as time went on the balance
of power began to favor the union,
chiefly because, I imagine, it was
increasingly evident that if Con
gress had to intervene to settle
I the strike, it would not be very
i tender with the companies.
It is significant that the Nix
on-Mitchell intervention suc
ceeded because they were able
to threaten the companies with
the certainty of Congressional
{ action.
So we have come 1o a crude
and embarrassing ending to an
I inglorious and mismanaged pol
| icy. I have reason to know that
| it is denied in official quarters
| thai the strike could have been
i settled any earlier.
But I think it is arguable from
the record that a settlement on
the Nixon-Mitchell terms could
have been had at any time. All
that was required was to give
labor the carrot of Ihe concessions
and then to do to the companies
what Mr. Nixon did to them, to
use the big stick of a threat of
special legislation in Congress
leading to some kind of com
pulsory arbitrat ion.
If the President had realized
that (lie period of free bargain
ing bad ended even before tin*
strike began, the second strike

could have been handled by
measures which were rational,
which protected (tie public in
terest, and enlightened public
opinion.
All in all, we can be glad that
ihe strike is not to be resumed.
But there is nothing else 1o be
glad about.

He used the carrot for the un
ion and the stick for the com
panies. He coerced tiie com
panies into yielding not all but
most of what the union was
fighting for.
Moreover, it would appear, ho
induced them to agree that they
will not raise steel prices at least
until after the election. The strike
; was not settled by "free bargain
! ing." It was settled by a political
' fix.
The President, whose mind has
; no doubt been on other things,
I seems never to have realized that
|in this struggle the process of free
I bargaining was exhausted very
early in the day almost certainly
j by July when the strike actually
I began.
It was evident from the begin
ing that the two great monop
olies were committed to a test
of power, not to a process of
bargaining. The test was which
of them could hold out the
longer against the other.
In July when the strike began
I there were reasons for thinking
that the companies were the
1 stronger. Their customers had
large stockpiles. Labor unions
i were unpopular as a result of the
MeClellan exposures.
The public was opposed to an
other round of wage-price in
creases. And there was some
question whether Mr. McDonald
was in solid control of his union.
But as time went on the balance
of power began to favor the union,
chiefly because, I imagine, it was
increasingly evident that if Con
gress had to intervene to settle
I the strike, it would not be very
i tender with the companies.
It is significant that the Nix
on-Mitchell intervention suc
ceeded because they were able
to threaten the companies with
the certainty of Congressional
{ action.
So we have come 1o a crude
and embarrassing ending to an
I inglorious and mismanaged pol
| icy. I have reason to know that
| it is denied in official quarters
| thai the strike could have been
i settled any earlier.
But I think it is arguable from
the record that a settlement on
the Nixon-Mitchell terms could
have been had at any time. All
that was required was to give
labor the carrot of Ihe concessions
and then to do to the companies
what Mr. Nixon did to them, to
use the big stick of a threat of
special legislation in Congress
leading to some kind of com
pulsory arbitrat ion.
If the President had realized
that (lie period of free bargain
ing bad ended even before tin*
strike began, the second strike

could have been handled by
measures which were rational,
which protected (tie public in
terest, and enlightened public
opinion.
All in all, we can be glad that
ihe strike is not to be resumed.
But there is nothing else 1o be
glad about.

1 stronger. Their customers had
large stockpiles. Labor unions
i were unpopular as a result of the
MeClellan exposures.
The public was opposed to an
other round of wage-price in
creases. And there was some
question whether Mr. McDonald
was in solid control of his union.
But as time went on the balance
of power began to favor the union,
chiefly because, I imagine, it was
increasingly evident that if Con
gress had to intervene to settle
I the strike, it would not be very
i tender with the companies.
It is significant that the Nix
on-Mitchell intervention suc
ceeded because they were able
to threaten the companies with
the certainty of Congressional
{ action.
So we have come 1o a crude
and embarrassing ending to an
I inglorious and mismanaged pol
| icy. I have reason to know that
| it is denied in official quarters
| thai the strike could have been
i settled any earlier.
But I think it is arguable from
the record that a settlement on
the Nixon-Mitchell terms could
have been had at any time. All
that was required was to give
labor the carrot of Ihe concessions
and then to do to the companies
what Mr. Nixon did to them, to
use the big stick of a threat of
special legislation in Congress
leading to some kind of com
pulsory arbitrat ion.
If the President had realized
that (lie period of free bargain
ing bad ended even before tin*
strike began, the second strike

could have been handled by
measures which were rational,
which protected (tie public in
terest, and enlightened public
opinion.
All in all, we can be glad that
ihe strike is not to be resumed.
But there is nothing else 1o be
glad about.
