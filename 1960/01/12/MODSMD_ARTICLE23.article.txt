Foolhall Etuis . . .
Certainly one week of sehool makes us all realize that the vaca
tion is over and Winter quarter is upon us. With all this rain we
turn to indoor sports and basketball reigns king at Stanford.
But before looking at the coming cage season a few post mortem
notes on football can be mentioned. Mere praise is not enough to
express our pleasure in seeing the Washington Huskies trounce
tlie visiting Wisconsin Badgers from the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl.
Of course the LA "experts" were giving the Huskies little chance
to win slightly reminiscent of before the VÂ»8 Rose Bowl which saw
Oregon Ducks late almost upset Ohio State. But when the Boh
Keliloredt-led team went over, through and around the Badgers to
whip them 41-8, and beating Wisconsin at their own power game,
most Western fans believed that top-notch football has again re
turned to the Pacific Coast.
One last noie about football. Currently in the sports news these

days is the proposed change of
1960 grid rules to bring back the
two-platoon substitution rule of
the early fifties. Then you may
remember, a change of the ball
brought in a completely new
change of teams, which gave the
big schools a decided advantage as
they could field 22 specialists, let
ting eleven rest at a time during
the game.
Of course there were many dis
advantages to this system and as
Card Couch Jack Curtice pointed
out in commenting on the pro
posed changes. "1 don't believe
in the two-platoon system be
cause it doesn't teach the player
the whole game. Naturally all
the linemen like defense while
the backs would prefer to play
offense. The two-platoon system
also hurts morale as the defen
sive unit never sees the ball and
consequently seldom has a chance
to scoie which almost leaves them
out of a victory effort."
This writer goes along w i th

roach Curtice and hopes that next year will see tho same wild
card substitution rule in effect, i.e., let individual players be sub
stituted during periods when the ball is dead and more gridders
substituted when lime is out.
I he Jinx Is Broken
Now let's look at Ihe basketball year. Well the Stanford cracker
box Pavilion jinx has been broken this year first by St. Mary's by
a 53-.') 1 score, and more decisively by the Cal Bears, 52 13 last week
end and Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers cannot again rely on the
almpst certain victory on the friendly home court. This year the
team has been hampered, to say the least, by injuries and also the
problem of filling in for the loss via graduation of Dick Haga,
Paul Neumann and Doug Warren last year's stars.
The loss of Kicli llosley before the season began and injuries to
-Ferry Thuesen, John Arrillaga, John Hendry and John Windsor's ill
ness ha\e certainl\ hurt the Tribe's chance. Windsor at 6-7, Tlniesen
at (i-7 and (iosley at (IS; and before his surfing accident, were all
counted on to provide one ot Ihe tallest Card teams in many sears.
However, the old injury bugaboo and inexperience has shown up in
Stanford's cage record to date
I his was ( - pociall\ evident in last Saturday night's loss lo the
Hears when the Tribe, led by Arriliaga, Bob Bowling, \c ;1 Brock
nieyer, Jim Bryan and Hendry held tho lead at half. The refreshed
Bears first team, who had waiter! out the last seven minutes of
' he first stanza on the bench, came in and quickly took charge of
weary, reserve less Cards. The C ards were out-hustled and out-shot
in the opening minutes and were forced to take many bad shots
by Cal the Nation's leading defense.
lirorkmeyer Improved Fasl
The one bright light in last Saturday's opening AAWU loss, was
the fine performance of reserve center, senior Neal Brockmeyer.
Neal has^ been playing behind the fine sophomore Windsor, who look
ed last Saturday like he would be much more at home at forward
than center, but against the Bears Brockmeyer came in and was out
iebounding C al tlash Darrall Imhotf as well as holding him down
in scoring.
Yes, that first half was quite a rare sight, seeing a Stanford team
out-rebound its tougher, taller opponents.
