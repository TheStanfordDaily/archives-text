# Indian Future Brightened By Sophomore Forwards
## Daily Sports 
### 
Youth is Ihe predominate fea
ture among the forwards on this
year's Stanford basketball team.
Of the six varsity forwards only
one is a senior, one is a junior,
and the other four are all sopho
mores.
Jerry Thuesen and John Hen
dry, the two regulars up front,
are the only veterans among the
forwards. Senior Thuesen in his
last year of varsity competition
will be the only forward not re
turning next year.
Oklahoman
The 6-7 Thuesen from Still
water, Okla., has been constantly
troubled with ill health and in
juries since joining the Stanford
varsity and this has hurt his
development greatly. Last year
Thuesen contracted mononucleo
sis midway through the season
just when it had appeared that
he was beginning to reach his
full potential. This year the lanky
forward has had constant trouble
with an injured knee.
Thuesen was one of the lop
scorers on the freshman team of
19.~7 mainly on the strength of
his excellent one hand push shot
and highly effective jump shot.
He has developed deadly accuracy
with shots from either corner and
his 6-7 frame give him an advan
tage over usually smaller op
ponents.
John Hendry, a junior, was a
real surprise last year when he
came from practically nowhere to
gain a starting berth on the In
dian squad. Hendry is only (5-3
but can jump as high as any mem
ber of the squad. His tremendous
spring made him a high jumper
on the track team earlier in his
Sranford athletic career.
Best on Defense
Hendry is probably Stanford's
best defensive player and usually
draws the assignment of guarding
an opponent's best scorer. Some
of those Hendry has been assign
ed to guard the last two years
include Jerry West of West Vir
g in i a , Tom Meschery of St.
Mary's, and Walt Torrenee of
UCLA.
If Hendrv's offensive skills
atch up with his defensive abili
ties, lie could become one of the
coast's best forwards.
Backing up Thuesen and Hen
dry and seeing quite a bit of ac
lion this year has been 6-3 Jim
Bryan. Bryan is gifted with
I rrmend'>us spring, somewhat like
Hendry, and also has a fine jump
shot.
Bryan has amazed several on
lookers this year by outhattling
players four and five inches taller
to score on tap in plays. The 6-3

sophomore comes to Stanford
from Mission, Kansas.
Al Siiriila, a 6-5 sophomore, has
also seen several minutes of play

in the young 1900 season. Simila
is a rugged rebounder and de
fensive man. He played with the
freshman team of but stayed
out of basketball last year.
Phil Kelly, (i-2 sophomore, has
given Stanford Coach Howie Dall
mar still another good young for
ward prospect. Kelly transfered
to Stanford from Menlo
where he was a team mate of
Citl's Bobby Wendell and Oregon
State's Jim Woodland.
Up from lasi year's freshman
learn is (5-3 Nels Christensen.
Christensen with a very good eye
has been doing heavy scoring
duty with the Stanford Braves
this season. If he can keep his
ankles from giving out on him,
Christensen will be a definite
threat to break into the starting
lineup in'the next two years.
