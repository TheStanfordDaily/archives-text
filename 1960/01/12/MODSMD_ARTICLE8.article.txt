## 
### 
BONN, Germany (/Pi Chan
cellor Konrod Adenauer declared
yesterday that West Germany's
anti-Semitic activity must be
stopped.
"One must clearly understand
that such incidents will be utilized
by the enemies of Germany and
as you know, Germany still has
very many enemies who will say
that the Germans are the same
as they used to be."
Those who paint swastikas and
anti-Jewish slogans should be
thrown into prisons or locked up
in lunatic asylums, he told a meet
ing of the Hamburg Overseas
Club.
There was an appeal through
the United Nations for action to
stop anti-Jewish incidents in the
world "lest they result in dis
aster."
