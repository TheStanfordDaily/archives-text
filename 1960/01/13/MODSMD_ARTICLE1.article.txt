# ST & T Speakers Foresee Raise In Tuition-Possibly by 1961
## Also See Rise In Enrollment, More Faculty 
### 
Financial matters including a
possible 1961 tuition hike topped
the list of topics discussed by 10
Stanford administrators and pro
lessors at informal discussions in
lreshman dorms last night.
Other prime subjects touched
on by the speakers as part of the
Stanford Today and Tomorrow
program were a rise in student
and staff population, a burgeon
ing construction program and stu
dent drinking.
At Junipero lounge in Wilbur
Hall, Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler foresaw a probable
tuition increase in the fall of 1961.
He noted, however, that the hike
is only a possibility; no final de
cision has been made. He did say
there will be no increase next fall.
Financial Aid Increase
James Triolo, associate director
of development, told Roble Hall
listeners that rising costs as in
dicated by present figures will
bring tuition to $1,300-1,800 with
in 10 years. With such a boost,
though, scholarships and financial
aid will increase accordingly.
Dr. Alexander Miller, professor
of religion, in predicting the tui
tion rise, as did all speakers, said
Stanford is 35th in the national
tuition scale, yet offers an educa
tion which is ranked among the
nation's top 10.
Also at Hoble, Dr. Howard
Brooks, director of the summer
session, said Stanford will have
an enrollment of 11,000 by 1970.
He outlined the University's $182
million expansion program, say
ing the money is aimed largely,
in terms of student population, at
the graduate level. The student
increase will be mainly graduate.
Profs Get More Pay
Stanford will have 30 per cent
more instructors by 1970, and
they will receive a two-third
larger paycheck than presently,
Frederick O. Glover, executive as
sistant to President Sterling, said J
at Soto lounge.
He also predicted completion of
the undergraduate library by 1963, !
a new physics building by 1962, :
a faculty club-completion date un
known, and a complete Tresidder
Union within two years.
Most of the speakers predicted j
work will start on Tresidder some \
time in the next 8-10 months.
Liquor Law Crackdown
Winbigler noted that if the!
drinking situation on campus does !
not improve there is a definite
threat of stiff enforcement of the j
law by police and state officials.
Enforcement of the liquor rules is ,
in students' hands, he said.
Brooks stated that the Univer-,
sity's Committee on Policy last
week appointed a student-faculty
study group to make a close
survey of the situation.
Glover and Winbigler sa if I they I
think there will be a Stanford-in-1
Tokyo in a few years, probably
a graduate setup.

At Junipero lounge in Wilbur
Hall, Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler foresaw a probable
tuition increase in the fall of 1961.
He noted, however, that the hike
is only a possibility; no final de
cision has been made. He did say
there will be no increase next fall.
Financial Aid Increase
James Triolo, associate director
of development, told Roble Hall
listeners that rising costs as in
dicated by present figures will
bring tuition to $1,300-1,800 with
in 10 years. With such a boost,
though, scholarships and financial
aid will increase accordingly.
Dr. Alexander Miller, professor
of religion, in predicting the tui
tion rise, as did all speakers, said
Stanford is 35th in the national
tuition scale, yet offers an educa
tion which is ranked among the
nation's top 10.
Also at Hoble, Dr. Howard
Brooks, director of the summer
session, said Stanford will have
an enrollment of 11,000 by 1970.
He outlined the University's $182
million expansion program, say
ing the money is aimed largely,
in terms of student population, at
the graduate level. The student
increase will be mainly graduate.
Profs Get More Pay
Stanford will have 30 per cent
more instructors by 1970, and
they will receive a two-third
larger paycheck than presently,
Frederick O. Glover, executive as
sistant to President Sterling, said J
at Soto lounge.
He also predicted completion of
the undergraduate library by 1963, !
a new physics building by 1962, :
a faculty club-completion date un
known, and a complete Tresidder
Union within two years.
Most of the speakers predicted j
work will start on Tresidder some \
time in the next 8-10 months.
Liquor Law Crackdown
Winbigler noted that if the!
drinking situation on campus does !
not improve there is a definite
threat of stiff enforcement of the j
law by police and state officials.
Enforcement of the liquor rules is ,
in students' hands, he said.
Brooks stated that the Univer-,
sity's Committee on Policy last
week appointed a student-faculty
study group to make a close
survey of the situation.
Glover and Winbigler sa if I they I
think there will be a Stanford-in-1
Tokyo in a few years, probably
a graduate setup.
