# Medicine Is Art – Science

### Daryl Glenney 
The medical world today is in
volved in a confusing controversy
between the doctor as a man of
science and the doctor as an
artist, Dr. Robert Alway, Medical
School dean, told the Tuesday
Series audience las* night. Alway
spoke on "Medicine — Art or
Science?"
"Science is observation, collec
tion and classification of facts
Art is the application of this ac
cumulated skill," said Alway.
"Thus the question of art versus
science suggests a division which
is entirely false."
"Scientific medicine seem too
frequently to be in rather ill
repute," Alway continued, in ex
plaining the popular misconcep
tion that modern medicine is cold
and unsympathetic. "The most
essential responsibility of a doc
tor is still to administer hope and
courage," he asserted.
In enumerating the qualities of
the ideal doctor, the Medical
School dean cited desire for or
ganized knowledge, sound judg
ment, and wise application as
goals of modern medicine. "The
ideal doctor varies with the times,
as docs his function," he said.
Preconceived notions of the
public, induced by naive press and
radio •TV commercials extolling
miracle drugs, hinder medical
progress, claimed Alway. Because
of these, patients are obsessed
with the ultimate cure, ignoring
the doctor's time and wisdom.
"I beilevc that medicine today,
more than ever, must be an art
and a science," Alway concluded.
"Even with extensive scientific
research, medicine is in its highest
form will continue to be an art,"
he said.
