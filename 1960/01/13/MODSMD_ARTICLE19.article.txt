The 1950s will be remembered as the decade of Elvis I'resley,]
compact cars, and payola. It will also go down in histor\ as the
era of the Korean War, F.iscnhower Republicanism, and the end
of colonialism. Kill, ahove all, these last ten years will he noted
as the time when the two greatest powers the world has ever
known came face to (ace in a simple which will largel\ decide
the course of tlx' next ten vears and possibly of the next century. |
The United States entered the "50*s as the undisputed major
nation of the globe, ami it emerged equalled and surpassed l>\
Russia in many areas where it earlier had no rival.
This struggle has alread\ profoundly affected every facet o(
American life and will continue to do so in the next decade. The j
diplomat and politician are striving to win the favor of uncom
mitted lands and to devise programs of possible co-existence. The \
scientist is concentrating on producing new and better means of
defense, and the economist is faced with a growing Russian pros
perity which threatens the vers basis of American economic
society. These are just a few examples of the influence of the!
*50* sand the rise of Russia.
Since the American of the Y)o's will have to contend even
more with I lie Communist menace, it is difficult to see how he
can afford to remain uninformed or onl\ partial!) informed about
Russia and its threat to the I nited States. Toda\ and tomorrow I
Stanford students will have the opportunity to learn about the!
Soviet Union an opportunity of the sort that conies rarely. On
these two days, the Institute of International Relations will pre
sent the third annual Foreign Polie\ Institute with Averell Harri
man as guest speaker.
Harriman is quite well qualified to discuss the topic of I nited
States foreign polie\ toward Russia. In addition to being past
governor of New York, lie was ambassador to Russia for four
years and served on numerous delegations dealing with various
aspects of U.S.-Russian relationships.
Harriman will not present any new radical proposals for co
existing with Russia nor will he give in a nutshell the answer as to
how we can win this race for supremacy. Instead he will tell of
problems the U.S. faces ami evaluate efforts of this country to
combat the Russian threat, and he will offer a program by which
the I .S. can improve its chances to win the contest for economic
and political superiority.
The student who takes advantage of the Foreign Policy Insti
tute h\ attending the speeches, discussion groups, and informal
question and answer period with Harriman will find himself far
better informed about Russia and United States foreign policy
toward it. lie will also he better prepared to meet the challenge
of the Soviet Union in the 1960'5. We strongly commend the lIR
for its efforts in bringing such a pressing issue before the Stan
ford campus. We hope every student will avail himself of this
opportunity to hear a leader of our times speak on this vital
subject.
