# ‘TIGHT MONEY'
## President Urges Removal Of Bond Interest Ceiling 
### 
WASHINGTON (/Pi President
Eisenhower reopened his tight
money battle with Congress yes
i terday in a brief, almost curt,
| -special message demanding re
moval of the interest ceiling on
t government bonds.
Loading Taxpayers
Congressional inaction on re
moving the 4 1 1 per cent ceiling
| last session, Eisenhower said, has
had the effect of loading taxpay
ers with interest rates on the na
tional debt at the highest levels
in several decades.
"I deem it imperative, therefore,
j that this restrictive ceiling be re
moved," Eisenhower's three-para
graph message said.
Urgency
It was the first special White
House message of the new ses
| sion, attesting to the urgency
j which Eisenhower attaches to the
measure left languishing in a
House committee when Congress
! adjourned last summer.
Widespread opposition in Con
gress is ascribed to the unwilling
ness of the Democrats—who
I oppose the administration's tight
money policy—to vote for any
increase in interest rates.
Ceiling Outdated
Eisenhower gave notice he is
asking Secretary of the Treasury
Robert B. Anderson to transmit
proposed legislation that would
| take away "this archaic restric
tion on flexible debt manage-
I ment." The ceiling dates back to
j the Liberty Loan drives of World
! War I.
It forbids the Treasury to pay
more than 4 '» per cent on securi
ties maturing in five years or
more. In the recent sustained and
general upsurge of interest rates,
the Treasury has been forced to
rely on more frequent, shorter
term borrowings. These are con
| sidered inflationary.
The President said this practice
has brought about a much more
rapid increase in short term debt
j then would otherwise have oc-1
I cur red.

As short-term borrowings be
come an increasingly heavier por
tion of the 290-billion-dollar fed
eral debt, interest charges bulk
larger in the federal budget. In
terest charges now cost the tax
payers more than $9 billion a
year, or $11 out of every $100 the
government spends.
