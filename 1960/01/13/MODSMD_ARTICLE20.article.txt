Fifth Amendment
Editor, The Daily:
On Friday I asked three people
living on my floor at Cedro
whether they believed that a per
son should be compelled to statel
or write anything that could be I
used to incriminate him.
I had planned to get the signa
tures of a hundred names and
their reactions to the statement.
My purpose was to show that
there existed at Stanford at least
that many who believed in the
Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Con
stitution.
When I asked these first three,
they first asked what I was up to.
I evaded their questions, and they
evaded me. One of them said he
would not sign my questionnaire
because "I might use it to incrim-|
inate him." His words summed up :
the others' feelings.
The point: they would not sign
because they feared I might in
criminate them.
Since they believed this, I feel'
that they resent the Stanford]
Honor Code pledge as printed on i
the blue books. My inference, un- J
proven, is that they believe that i
writing a signature to the pledge'
"I have observed the Honor Code"
(i.e.—"l have not cheated") is
against the Fifth Amendment.

Wine—Un Aliment'
Editor, The Daily:
In many European countries no
law prevents a baby from drink
ing a beer. Thus alcohol has no
thrill of secrecy there. French
people say: "Levin n'est pas
d'alcool, c'est un aliment."
Now to the point: we foreign
students would appreciate very
much if we were allowed to enjoy
a glass of wine (as California has
some good ones) when socially
gathering on campus. In fact only
very few foreigners have cars to
go to El Camino for a drink and
being guests here, they have a lot
of scruples to violate the Funda
mental Standard.
If it is not possible to liberate
ihe graduate dorms (as at M.1.T.)
I would suggest giving the I-Cen
ter a kind of an exterritorial
status. There are served many
national specialities which are
half spoiled without the proper
drink. It would up to the host
couple and the alien students to
keep a good reputation and to
show that mature people can en
joy alcohol without excess.
At the end a question to the
Men's Council: Is it an offense
against the F. S. to have some hot
tea and rum to fight a cold or
tequila to cure an upset stomach?
