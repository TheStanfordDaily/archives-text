# 'PEACE WITH RUSSIA?'
## Harriman: Competition Inevitable, but Not War 
### Joel Meister 
Editor's Note: The following
review of "Peace With Russia"
is written by Joel Meister, lilt
Political Analyist.

"l have never believed and do I
not believe now that war is in-!
evitable in our struggle to thwart
the march of Communism." So
says Averell Harriman in his re
cently published book, (Peace
with Russia?). Mr. Harriman is
no doubt qualified to make such a
statement, having been negotia-j
tor, ambassador to Russia, aide
on Russian affairs to Presidents
Roosevelt and Truman, and hav- 1

ing recently returned from an
18,000-mile trip through the Soviet
Union.
What is perhaps most inter
esting" i»i (Peace with Russia?)
is (tie clear distinction made be
tween the Communist Party
leadership and the Russian
masses in current attitude and
cherished goals. The people
want a higher living standard,
all politics aside. The craving
for peace free from tension "ob
sesses every Soviet citizen."
Rut, Mr. Harriman cautious,
listen to the leaders and not to
the people.
Khrushchev is a devout be

liever/n Marxist doctrine; there
lore, lie accepts the Hieory of the
inevitability of Communism's vic
tory. Moreover, his plans for de
veloping "Russia for the Rus
sians" are subordinate to the
main goal of world revolution.
The people, who apparently could
not care less about world revolu
tion, have no real influence in
the Kremlin on issues of this
magnitude.
The people, however, are in a
heultliier position today than
ever before. Famines are at an
end; police terror is at an end;
housing conditions are improv
ing; more luxuries are avail
able; and education is no long
er a luxury. Nevertheless, in
creasing demands lor consumer
goods and higher living stand
ards are not so pressing as to
force reductions in heavy in
dustrial investment.
The Russian people also have
the conviction that the United
States is the greatest threat to
j peace in the world today. The
Soviet propagandists who dis
| pense world news internally arc
| powerful and effective.
In listening to the Russian lead
ers, Mr. Harriman hears little to
comfort him. Khrushchev ex
pressed to him the willingness to
maintain a peaceful status quo.
But to Khrushchev that peace in
cludes Communism's progress to
ward world domination.
What, then, is Mr. Harriman's
peace? He urges us to "dismiss
as a pleasant daydream any
thought of Mr. Khrushchev's
peaceful co-existence" and to
apply ourselves to an all-out
competitive coexistence —"com-
petition for survival." Yet, isn't
that exactly the essence of 3lr.
Khrushchev's co-existence?
Peace with Russia? Militarily,
J yes, maybe; socially and economi
cally, no. definitely. It is a "com
petition for survival," and that
simply is not peace. But, after
all, this situation rapidly has been
becoming a contemporary fact of
life, to which Mr. Harriman's
conclusions do no more than lend
credence. Perhaps he and Mr.
Khrushchev, who seem to be in
complete agreement on co-exis
tence, can be at peace.
