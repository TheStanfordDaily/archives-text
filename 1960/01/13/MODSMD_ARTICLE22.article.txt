If you ever wore a fan of Ihe
brothers Grimm, if the tales of
Hans Christian Anderson ever
hold the place of honor on your
j bookshelf, or if you just feel like
: escaping reality for an evening,
! Comedia's production of "The
Thirteen Clocks" is sure lo trans
| port you into the world of beauti
! ful princesses and wicked dukes
| for a delightful two hours.
I' laying Sunday evenings,
7:30 p.m. at the Loft Theater
I in Palo Alto, James Thurber's
musical fantasy takes place "in
and around the castle of the
| cold Duke Diehard, ages and
ages ago," and is highlighted by
charming music and unforget
table phrases.
Although several of the actors
underplayed their roles and failed
to fit in completely with the
fairy-tale setting, Thurber's wit
was complimented by Philip
| Schultz's excellent characteriza
| tion of the Duke who had stopped
I all the 13 clocks in the castle at
ten minutes to five many years
ago.
Another notable job was done
by Eric Silins who played the
| whimsical Golux, a wizzard who
| could never remember if he had
merely made up a story or if il
was true. And, playing the
prince, Shapleigh W. Howell's
j fine voice carried beautifully
j such songs as "A Prince of a
. Minstrel."
One of the most fanciful
i characters in the play was
played by Dorothy Wyman as
Ilagga, tin* enchanted woman
who once cried .jewels but now
could only laugh gems which
lasted a fortnight.
Humorous and clever, "The
Thirteen Clocks" is a play for all
'ages. Tickets are priced at $1.85
and $2.50, available at DA 6-8317.
Conductor for 17 years of the
San Francisco Symphony Orches
stra, Pierre Monteux returns to
! the Opera House tonight to guest

| No. 3; Wagner's "A Siegried
i Idyl"; Debussy's "La Mer" and
j Brahams' Symphony No. 1 in C

■ that he was not retiring and came

ductor with the Boston Sympony

San Francisco Opera productions.
Now almost 85, Monteux is the
oldest active conductor on the
j American scene and has such suc-
I cesses to his credit as the tri
umphant 1952 performance of
; Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" in
