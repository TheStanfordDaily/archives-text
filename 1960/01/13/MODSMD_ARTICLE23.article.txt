Anti-Semitic Display
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing this letter to the
Stanford Daily in the hope that it
I will be printed as a public protest
against the current Audio-Visual
display on the A-V bulletin board
! in Cubbeiley. It is clearly anti-
Semitic in character, and as such
1 is a disgrace to the University,
and a strong comment on the
! sentiments of those responsible
j for the display.
Placing a swastika-covered syn
agogue next to the little red
schoolhouse and the American
'flag, with merely the heading
i "Symbols Have Meaning" written
above, indicates at best a neutral
ity toward vicious minority-group
prejudice, and at worst a condon
1 ing of religious intolerance as
! "American." It is quite significant
1 that the little boy is looking not
j at the flag or at the schoolhouse,
but at the defacement of a house
I of worship.
The writer has informally
polled several fellow students,
| and some faculty members, one
of whom succinctly summed up
j the unanimous opinion: "It's a
disgrace. I think il -should be
! taken down."
i Symbols have meaning, yes, but
what is their meaning in this dis
! play? The meaning seems to be
: plainly one of condoning violent
overt prejudice against a minority
group, and as such reflects the
i bad taste, poor judgment, and
I questionable competence of those
1 responsible for the display. These
individuals should receive public
censure for their implicit con
doning of a political philosophy
i that led to the slaughter of six
! million innocent men, women, and
j children in one country alone dur
ing the Second World War. The
individuals responsible for this
| display simply do not belong in a
university, or in any other place
where individual freedom is a
positive value.

i bad taste, poor judgment, and
I questionable competence of those
1 responsible for the display. These
individuals should receive public
censure for their implicit con
doning of a political philosophy
i that led to the slaughter of six
! million innocent men, women, and
j children in one country alone dur
ing the Second World War. The
individuals responsible for this
| display simply do not belong in a
university, or in any other place
where individual freedom is a
positive value.
