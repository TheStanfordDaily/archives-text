A Hangover in Texas
The New Year had a few sour notes at its beginning notes which
good ol' Sports Illustrated aplly lagged "Hangovers."
This has nothing to do with Stanford's inauspicious start in basket
ball; which came, I might add, against possibly the toughest going
a Tribe team has had to face in many a season. And likewise
nothing to do with the hangover that must still exist in our Dairy
State after Washington's little New Year's Day celebration.

The University of Texas, for
one, brought about a hangover.
The Longhorns made themselves
Lone Star heroes and national
bums with their behavior in the
Cotton Bowl. Texas' performance,
looiball-wi.se, was an admirable
one against the nation's No. 1
powerhouse, Syracuse. But the
excellence ended with the foot
fall proficiency. The Longhorns
came out somewhal wanting in
the sportsmanship department.
Personally, I think the incidents
of racial name-calling were pretty
much just ihe product of being
too-fired-up. Emotions sort of get
the best of the athletes. Never
theless, the incidents were a dis
grace. I understand the Texans
were later indignant because Syra
cuse called them "dirty white."
Too bad.
No! 100 surprisingly, Syracuse's
three Negro stars were not al
lowed to attend the after-game
awards banquet at one of Dallas'
more fashionable hotels. Gen e

Ward of the Now York Daily News said it . . . "and lliis would have
been their finest hour."
All this recalls the Sugar Howl incident with Pittsburgh Negro
fullback Bobby Fpps of several years back. The Sugar Bowl has
since turned into an all-South battle. Maybe it would be just as
well if the Cotton Bowl did the same. Luckily for the Sugar Bowl,
there was a "natural" this year) although the game turned out
most uninteresting). Last year, Louisianans were upset because top
ranked I,SU had to play "so-so" Cleinson in the Sugar Bowl. But
what Northern teams are going to play in that tense atmosphere?
Rio Dan Is Back
Just as big a hangover was perpetrated by an old hand at the
business, everybody's friend, Dan Ferris.
Dan heads the Amateur Athletic Union. His latest exercise of
misguided authority was to ban the Swedish National Basketball
team from playing any American amateurs. All because he said the
Swedes' tour had been arranged by a professional promoter.
So the Swedes arrived in New York and received a fine display of
American hospitality but no games. I did see that they played a
game with some Canadian semipros the other day. •
The crux of this matter is Ferris' personal feud with Jim Mc-
Gregor, an American basketball coach who has been in l£urope for
some years. Nobody, but Ferris, is even sure that McGregor is a "pro
fessional promoter." And the fact that McGregor's connection with
the trip was merely the suggestion of it. The Swedes did tlie actual
arranging.
dim McGregor has done as much as any man to make basketball
an international sport traveling all over Europe teaching and en
couraging the sport. He has coached national teams in a number of
countries. 1 am now surprised that friend Dan didn't forbid the
playing of 7-3 Frenchman Jean Claude Lefevbre at Gonzaga two
years ago. Jean Claude got to the U.S. at McGregor's suggestion.
So the Swedes are in the country, with no games to play. Some
one might ask Dan Ferris about some of the football bowl games
anr umpteen holiday basketball tournaments. 1 doubt if the pro
fessional promoters are absent here. But maybe they asked "Dan,
may I?"
West Gets Westernized
West Virginia's enthusiasts had a hangover even before the New
Year started when the Mountaineers were blown out of Los Angeles
by a "weakened" California team. 65-45.
Fdgar O. Barrett, the West Virginia publicity director, sent this
paper tons of information on Jerry West, the brilliant Mountaineer
who for two years has been locked (by the press)' in a battle with
Cincy's Oscar Robertson for "tops in the nation" honors. Included
are quotes from 63 sportswriters, coaches and players dispensing
praise on the fabulous Mr. West. Reading the quotes, one gets the
impression there is no way possible to stop the guy.
Bob Rule of the Houston Press was quoted: ".'Marty Blake (pro
scout) in appraising West said he couldn't be defensed — and it
sounded like a strong statement."
Marty Blake, whoever he is, didn't consult California, and forward
Tandy Gillis in particular. On the night of Dec. 30, West was held
to eight points scoring his first field goal with just four minutes
left in the game.
However, seeing that it was the first time in West's career that
ne had been held out of double figures, and that otherwise the Moun
taineers are doing pretty well, I won't be one to quibble.
Of the 63 quotes all about West, perhaps the best came from the
Big O himself. Robertson, who right now is enjoying a season almost
beyond description said: (What do you think of Jerry West.) "He's
tough, man. Everybody knows that." iDo you think he's the sec
ond best player in the country?) "lie might be the first, baby."

Personally, I think the incidents
of racial name-calling were pretty
much just ihe product of being
too-fired-up. Emotions sort of get
the best of the athletes. Never
theless, the incidents were a dis
grace. I understand the Texans
were later indignant because Syra
cuse called them "dirty white."
Too bad.
No! 100 surprisingly, Syracuse's
three Negro stars were not al
lowed to attend the after-game
awards banquet at one of Dallas'
more fashionable hotels. Gen e

Ward of the Now York Daily News said it . . . "and lliis would have
been their finest hour."
All this recalls the Sugar Howl incident with Pittsburgh Negro
fullback Bobby Fpps of several years back. The Sugar Bowl has
since turned into an all-South battle. Maybe it would be just as
well if the Cotton Bowl did the same. Luckily for the Sugar Bowl,
there was a "natural" this year) although the game turned out
most uninteresting). Last year, Louisianans were upset because top
ranked I,SU had to play "so-so" Cleinson in the Sugar Bowl. But
what Northern teams are going to play in that tense atmosphere?
Rio Dan Is Back
Just as big a hangover was perpetrated by an old hand at the
business, everybody's friend, Dan Ferris.
Dan heads the Amateur Athletic Union. His latest exercise of
misguided authority was to ban the Swedish National Basketball
team from playing any American amateurs. All because he said the
Swedes' tour had been arranged by a professional promoter.
So the Swedes arrived in New York and received a fine display of
American hospitality but no games. I did see that they played a
game with some Canadian semipros the other day. •
The crux of this matter is Ferris' personal feud with Jim Mc-
Gregor, an American basketball coach who has been in l£urope for
some years. Nobody, but Ferris, is even sure that McGregor is a "pro
fessional promoter." And the fact that McGregor's connection with
the trip was merely the suggestion of it. The Swedes did tlie actual
arranging.
dim McGregor has done as much as any man to make basketball
an international sport traveling all over Europe teaching and en
couraging the sport. He has coached national teams in a number of
countries. 1 am now surprised that friend Dan didn't forbid the
playing of 7-3 Frenchman Jean Claude Lefevbre at Gonzaga two
years ago. Jean Claude got to the U.S. at McGregor's suggestion.
So the Swedes are in the country, with no games to play. Some
one might ask Dan Ferris about some of the football bowl games
anr umpteen holiday basketball tournaments. 1 doubt if the pro
fessional promoters are absent here. But maybe they asked "Dan,
may I?"
West Gets Westernized
West Virginia's enthusiasts had a hangover even before the New
Year started when the Mountaineers were blown out of Los Angeles
by a "weakened" California team. 65-45.
Fdgar O. Barrett, the West Virginia publicity director, sent this
paper tons of information on Jerry West, the brilliant Mountaineer
who for two years has been locked (by the press)' in a battle with
Cincy's Oscar Robertson for "tops in the nation" honors. Included
are quotes from 63 sportswriters, coaches and players dispensing
praise on the fabulous Mr. West. Reading the quotes, one gets the
impression there is no way possible to stop the guy.
Bob Rule of the Houston Press was quoted: ".'Marty Blake (pro
scout) in appraising West said he couldn't be defensed — and it
sounded like a strong statement."
Marty Blake, whoever he is, didn't consult California, and forward
Tandy Gillis in particular. On the night of Dec. 30, West was held
to eight points scoring his first field goal with just four minutes
left in the game.
However, seeing that it was the first time in West's career that
ne had been held out of double figures, and that otherwise the Moun
taineers are doing pretty well, I won't be one to quibble.
Of the 63 quotes all about West, perhaps the best came from the
Big O himself. Robertson, who right now is enjoying a season almost
beyond description said: (What do you think of Jerry West.) "He's
tough, man. Everybody knows that." iDo you think he's the sec
ond best player in the country?) "lie might be the first, baby."

Always a first time
A Hangover in Texas
The New Year had a few sour notes at its beginning notes which
good ol' Sports Illustrated aplly lagged "Hangovers."
This has nothing to do with Stanford's inauspicious start in basket
ball; which came, I might add, against possibly the toughest going
a Tribe team has had to face in many a season. And likewise
nothing to do with the hangover that must still exist in our Dairy
State after Washington's little New Year's Day celebration.

The University of Texas, for
one, brought about a hangover.
The Longhorns made themselves
Lone Star heroes and national
bums with their behavior in the
Cotton Bowl. Texas' performance,
looiball-wi.se, was an admirable
one against the nation's No. 1
powerhouse, Syracuse. But the
excellence ended with the foot
fall proficiency. The Longhorns
came out somewhal wanting in

there was a "natural" this year) although the game turned out
most uninteresting). Last year, Louisianans were upset because top
ranked I,SU had to play "so-so" Cleinson in the Sugar Bowl. But
what Northern teams are going to play in that tense atmosphere?
Rio Dan Is Back
Just as big a hangover was perpetrated by an old hand at the
business, everybody's friend, Dan Ferris.
Dan heads the Amateur Athletic Union. His latest exercise of
misguided authority was to ban the Swedish National Basketball
team from playing any American amateurs. All because he said the
Swedes' tour had been arranged by a professional promoter.
So the Swedes arrived in New York and received a fine display of
American hospitality but no games. I did see that they played a
game with some Canadian semipros the other day. •
The crux of this matter is Ferris' personal feud with Jim Mc-
Gregor, an American basketball coach who has been in l£urope for
some years. Nobody, but Ferris, is even sure that McGregor is a "pro
fessional promoter." And the fact that McGregor's connection with
the trip was merely the suggestion of it. The Swedes did tlie actual
arranging.
dim McGregor has done as much as any man to make basketball
an international sport traveling all over Europe teaching and en
couraging the sport. He has coached national teams in a number of
countries. 1 am now surprised that friend Dan didn't forbid the
playing of 7-3 Frenchman Jean Claude Lefevbre at Gonzaga two
years ago. Jean Claude got to the U.S. at McGregor's suggestion.
So the Swedes are in the country, with no games to play. Some
one might ask Dan Ferris about some of the football bowl games
anr umpteen holiday basketball tournaments. 1 doubt if the pro
fessional promoters are absent here. But maybe they asked "Dan,
may I?"
West Gets Westernized
West Virginia's enthusiasts had a hangover even before the New
Year started when the Mountaineers were blown out of Los Angeles
by a "weakened" California team. 65-45.
Fdgar O. Barrett, the West Virginia publicity director, sent this
paper tons of information on Jerry West, the brilliant Mountaineer
who for two years has been locked (by the press)' in a battle with
Cincy's Oscar Robertson for "tops in the nation" honors. Included
are quotes from 63 sportswriters, coaches and players dispensing
praise on the fabulous Mr. West. Reading the quotes, one gets the
impression there is no way possible to stop the guy.
Bob Rule of the Houston Press was quoted: ".'Marty Blake (pro
scout) in appraising West said he couldn't be defensed — and it
sounded like a strong statement."
Marty Blake, whoever he is, didn't consult California, and forward
Tandy Gillis in particular. On the night of Dec. 30, West was held
to eight points scoring his first field goal with just four minutes
left in the game.
However, seeing that it was the first time in West's career that
ne had been held out of double figures, and that otherwise the Moun
taineers are doing pretty well, I won't be one to quibble.
Of the 63 quotes all about West, perhaps the best came from the
Big O himself. Robertson, who right now is enjoying a season almost
beyond description said: (What do you think of Jerry West.) "He's
tough, man. Everybody knows that." iDo you think he's the sec
ond best player in the country?) "lie might be the first, baby."

Always a first time
A Hangover in Texas
The New Year had a few sour notes at its beginning notes which
good ol' Sports Illustrated aplly lagged "Hangovers."
This has nothing to do with Stanford's inauspicious start in basket
ball; which came, I might add, against possibly the toughest going
a Tribe team has had to face in many a season. And likewise
nothing to do with the hangover that must still exist in our Dairy
State after Washington's little New Year's Day celebration.

The University of Texas, for
one, brought about a hangover.
The Longhorns made themselves
Lone Star heroes and national
bums with their behavior in the
Cotton Bowl. Texas' performance,
looiball-wi.se, was an admirable
one against the nation's No. 1
powerhouse, Syracuse. But the
excellence ended with the foot
fall proficiency. The Longhorns
came out somewhal wanting in
the sportsmanship department.
Personally, I think the incidents
of racial name-calling were pretty
much just ihe product of being
too-fired-up. Emotions sort of get
the best of the athletes. Never
theless, the incidents were a dis
grace. I understand the Texans
were later indignant because Syra
cuse called them "dirty white."
Too bad.
No! 100 surprisingly, Syracuse's
three Negro stars were not al
lowed to attend the after-game
awards banquet at one of Dallas'
more fashionable hotels. Gen e

Ward of the Now York Daily News said it . . . "and lliis would have
been their finest hour."
All this recalls the Sugar Howl incident with Pittsburgh Negro
fullback Bobby Fpps of several years back. The Sugar Bowl has
since turned into an all-South battle. Maybe it would be just as
well if the Cotton Bowl did the same. Luckily for the Sugar Bowl,
there was a "natural" this year) although the game turned out
