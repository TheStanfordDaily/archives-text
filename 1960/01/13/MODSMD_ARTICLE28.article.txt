# Huskies Next for Cards
## Daily Sports 
### Ken Dery 
Friday night's clash with the Huskies from Washington promises
lo bo one of the outstanding battles of the year. The Indians, anxious
to rebound after their Saturday night loss to Cal. will certainly
have their hands full with the invaders from the north.
Washington arrives after having defeated Oregon State Monday

night 57-51. However the Husky
five is still smarting from the
frustrating distinction of having
lost their four games preceding
the Oregon State contest by a
total of five points.
This will be the Card's first
look at new head coach John
Grayson, who replaced Tippy Dye
when the latter took the position
(jf athletic director at tlie Uni
versity of Wichita. An immense
ly successful and popular man,
Grayson has compiled a lifetime
record of 404 victories against
onlj ST losses in his years
of coaching.
Huskies Move Fast
The Huskies' new offense can
best be described as a "perpetual
motion machine" with either
three or four men constantly
changing floor positions, depend
ing on whether a single or double
pivot is used. Defensively, Wash
ington has been using the man
for-man style.
At the present moment, sopho
more center Bill Hanson is lead
ing the Husky scoring. He has
averaged 15.4 points per game
thus far, and his field goal per
centage of .456 also tops his team.
Hanson, a big boy at (s'B" and 220
pounds stepped light into the
Washington lineup in an attempt
to fill the void left by the gradua
tion of J 959 All-Coast selections
Doug Smart and Bruno Boin.
In Grayson's free-wheeling of
fense the center handles the ball
a great deal both in shooting
and in feeding teammates —and
the outcome of the game might
greatly depend on how well this
nineteen year old is contained.
Right behind Hanson in scor
ing is George Grant, a 6' guard
who is averaging 13.4 points per
game. lie is a topnotch ball
handler, tough on defense, and
possesses good speed and reac
tions.
Names Other Guard
Grant's partner in crime is 6'l"
Clint Names. One of the nation's
leaders in free throw accuracy
with a percentage of .897, he is
the team's third leading scorer.
He is considered a very dangerous
outside shooter, and his accuracy
in games thus far has prevented
opposing defenses from collaps
ing on center Hanson.

Another sophomore, Roger
Niva, has broken into the Husky
starting lineup. The G'G" forward
is exceptionally fast for a big
man and is hard to block out on
rebounds. He can be counted on
to give some trouble for he is
averaging close to ten points a
game.
Bakken Defense Star
Rounding out the starting five
is yet another sophomore, Lyle
Bakken. One of the brightest
basketball prospects to hit Wash
ington in sometime, Bakken is
tremendously strong and fast. He
is the team's outstanding defense
man, and it will be interesting to
see if Bakken, who plays forward,
will come out to guard the In
dians' leading scorer. John Arril
laga, who plays guard.
This young Washington team
is determined as it invades the
Pavilion, and the Cards will have
lo be al their best to out scrap the
boys from Seattle. The game
promises to be a thriller, and
ought not to be missed.

total of five points.
This will be the Card's first
look at new head coach John
Grayson, who replaced Tippy Dye
when the latter took the position
(jf athletic director at tlie Uni
versity of Wichita. An immense
ly successful and popular man,
Grayson has compiled a lifetime
record of 404 victories against
onlj ST losses in his years
of coaching.
Huskies Move Fast
The Huskies' new offense can
best be described as a "perpetual
motion machine" with either
three or four men constantly
changing floor positions, depend
ing on whether a single or double
pivot is used. Defensively, Wash
ington has been using the man
for-man style.
At the present moment, sopho
more center Bill Hanson is lead
ing the Husky scoring. He has
averaged 15.4 points per game
thus far, and his field goal per
centage of .456 also tops his team.
Hanson, a big boy at (s'B" and 220
pounds stepped light into the
Washington lineup in an attempt
to fill the void left by the gradua
tion of J 959 All-Coast selections
Doug Smart and Bruno Boin.
In Grayson's free-wheeling of
fense the center handles the ball
a great deal both in shooting
and in feeding teammates —and
the outcome of the game might
greatly depend on how well this
nineteen year old is contained.
Right behind Hanson in scor
ing is George Grant, a 6' guard
who is averaging 13.4 points per
game. lie is a topnotch ball
handler, tough on defense, and
possesses good speed and reac
tions.
Names Other Guard
Grant's partner in crime is 6'l"
Clint Names. One of the nation's
leaders in free throw accuracy
with a percentage of .897, he is
the team's third leading scorer.
He is considered a very dangerous
outside shooter, and his accuracy
in games thus far has prevented
opposing defenses from collaps
ing on center Hanson.

Another sophomore, Roger
Niva, has broken into the Husky
starting lineup. The G'G" forward
is exceptionally fast for a big
man and is hard to block out on
rebounds. He can be counted on
to give some trouble for he is
averaging close to ten points a
game.
Bakken Defense Star
Rounding out the starting five
is yet another sophomore, Lyle
Bakken. One of the brightest
basketball prospects to hit Wash
ington in sometime, Bakken is
tremendously strong and fast. He
is the team's outstanding defense
man, and it will be interesting to
see if Bakken, who plays forward,
will come out to guard the In
dians' leading scorer. John Arril
laga, who plays guard.
This young Washington team
is determined as it invades the
Pavilion, and the Cards will have
lo be al their best to out scrap the
boys from Seattle. The game
promises to be a thriller, and
ought not to be missed.
