HAIL TO THE DEAN!
Today let us examine that much maligned, widely niisunder-
I. grossly overworked, wholly dedicated campus* figure—
the dean.
The dean (from the Latin (haven—to expel) is not, as many
think, primarily a disciplinary officer, lie is a counselor and
guide, a haven and refuge for the troubled student. The dean
(from the Greek dcanos- t<> skewer) is characterized chiefly by
sympathy, wisdom, patience, forbearance, and a fondness for
homely pleasures like barn-raisings, gruel, spelldowns, and
Marlboro Cigarettes. The dean (from the German deangcmacht
— to poop a party) is fond of Marlboros for the same reason that
all men of good will are fond of Marlboros—because Marlboro
is an honest cigarette. Those better makin's are honestly better,
honestly aged to the peak of perfection, honestly blended for
the host of all possible flavors. The filter honestly filters.
Marlboro honestly comes in two different containers—a soft
pack which is honestly soft, and a flip-top box which honestly
flips. You too will flip when next you try an honest Marlboro,
which, one honestly hopes, will be soon.
But 1 digress. We were learning how a dean helps under
graduates. To illustrate, let us take a typical case from tlie files
of Dean S of the University of Y .. (Oh. why
he <o mysterious? The dean's name is .Sigafoos and the Univer
sity is Yutah.)

Wise, kindly Dean Sigafoos was visited one day by a fresh
nian named Walter Aguincourt who came to ask permission to
marry one I iiniiui lilcnheim, his dormitory laundress. To tho
dean the marriage seemed ill-advised, for Walter was only 18
and Emma was 01. Walter agreed, hut said he felt obligated to
g<> through with it because Emma had invested her life savings
in a transparent rain hood to protect her from tho mist at
Niagara Falls where they planned to spend their honeymoon.
W hat use, asked Walter, would the poor woman have for a rain
hood in Vutah? The wise, kindly dean pondered briefly and
came up with an answer: let Walter punch holes in the back of
Emma's steam iron: with steam billowing back at the old lady,
she would find a rain hood very useful — possibly even essential.
Whimpering with gratitude, Walter kissed the dean's Phi
Beta Kappa key and hastened away to follow his advice which,
it pleasures me to report, solved matters brilliantly.
Today Knuna is a happy woman singing lustily, wearing her
rain hood, eating soft-center chocolates, and ironing clothes —
twice as happy, to be candid, than if she had married Walter.
. . . And Walter? lie is happy too. I 4 'reed from his liaison with
Knuna, he married a girl much nearer his own age—Agnes
Yucca, 7'J. Walter i« now the proud father— .s7r/>fiithor, to be
perfectly accurate of three fine healthy boys from Agnes's first,
marriage Kverett, oS; W illem, 4.'>; and Irving, and when
Walter pu<> the boys in Kton collars and takes them for a stroll
in the park on Sunday afternoons, you may be sure there is not
a dry eye in \ utali. . . . And I )ean Sigafoos? Ile too is happy —
happy to spend long, tiring days in his little ofliee, giving counsel
without >tint and without complaint, doing his hit to set the
young, uncertain feet of his charges on the path to a brighter
tomorrow. (L 1900 Mi* Shulmim

and Emma was 01. Walter agreed, hut said he felt obligated to
g<> through with it because Emma had invested her life savings
in a transparent rain hood to protect her from tho mist at
Niagara Falls where they planned to spend their honeymoon.
W hat use, asked Walter, would the poor woman have for a rain
hood in Vutah? The wise, kindly dean pondered briefly and
came up with an answer: let Walter punch holes in the back of
Emma's steam iron: with steam billowing back at the old lady,
she would find a rain hood very useful — possibly even essential.
Whimpering with gratitude, Walter kissed the dean's Phi
Beta Kappa key and hastened away to follow his advice which,
it pleasures me to report, solved matters brilliantly.

rain hood, eating soft-center chocolates, and ironing clothes —

HAIL TO THE DEAN!
Today let us examine that much maligned, widely niisunder-
I. grossly overworked, wholly dedicated campus* figure—
the dean.
The dean (from the Latin (haven—to expel) is not, as many
think, primarily a disciplinary officer, lie is a counselor and
guide, a haven and refuge for the troubled student. The dean
(from the Greek dcanos- t<> skewer) is characterized chiefly by
sympathy, wisdom, patience, forbearance, and a fondness for
homely pleasures like barn-raisings, gruel, spelldowns, and
Marlboro Cigarettes. The dean (from the German deangcmacht
— to poop a party) is fond of Marlboros for the same reason that
all men of good will are fond of Marlboros—because Marlboro
is an honest cigarette. Those better makin's are honestly better,
honestly aged to the peak of perfection, honestly blended for
the host of all possible flavors. The filter honestly filters.
Marlboro honestly comes in two different containers—a soft
pack which is honestly soft, and a flip-top box which honestly
flips. You too will flip when next you try an honest Marlboro,
which, one honestly hopes, will be soon.
But 1 digress. We were learning how a dean helps under
graduates. To illustrate, let us take a typical case from tlie files
of Dean S of the University of Y .. (Oh. why
he <o mysterious? The dean's name is .Sigafoos and the Univer
sity is Yutah.)

Wise, kindly Dean Sigafoos was visited one day by a fresh
nian named Walter Aguincourt who came to ask permission to
marry one I iiniiui lilcnheim, his dormitory laundress. To tho
