# Ike to Send Congress Request For $500 Million Postal Hike
## 
### 
WASHINGTON iA 3 ) President Eisenhower again will ask Con
gress to increase postal rates a request that was turned down last
year, Rep. Charles A. Halleck of Indiana said yesterday.
One high official, who declined to be quoted by name, said ear
lier that the proposed boosts would total $500 millions a year.

Last year's rejected request
would have brought in an esti
mated extra $355 millions. The
proposal would have boosted post
age on a first-class letter to five
cents, and on air mail to eight
cents.
Postal rates went up Aug. 1,
1958- first-class letters to four
cents an ounce and air mail to
seven. Since then, the Post Office
says there have been increases in
salary and retirement payments
for postal workers and in trans
portation costs.
Aside from the general postal
rate increase that was turned
down last year, Congress did ap
prove a bill raising postal rates
on third-class matter of odd size
and shape by half a cent to 3'â€¢>
cents.
And on Feb. 1 this year, parcel
post rates will be boosted an
average of 17.1 per cent and bring
in an extra $88 millions a year.
This rate, however, is controled
by the Interstate Commerce Com
mission rather than by Congress.
