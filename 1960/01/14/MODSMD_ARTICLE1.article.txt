# Harriman: We Must Take Initiative
## Demo to Win Presidency-Harriman 
### Steve Freidberg 
Averell Harriman said yester
day lhal al tliis time he has no
personal preference for the Demo
cratic presidential candidate to be
nominated this summer, although
he probably will be prepared to
support someone before the con
vention begins.
Harriman, speaking in an in
formal interview on tlie way from
the San Francisco Airport to
Stanford, commented that he is
â€¢satisfied that the next president
will be a Democrat.
Any of the five prospective
Democratic candidates will give
Vice-President Nixon a good
race, he added. Nixon's main
handicap, he said, is that he's a
Republican.
Religion No Issue
Harriman felt that the religious
questions will not enter the cam
paign at all. He said that he voted
for Al Smith, and that in this day
and age he cannot believe that
there will be religious prejudice
in a Presidential race.
Harriman said that he does not
intend to take political -soundings
while he is in California, since
he did that in November when he
was here. He mentioned that he
will be a delegate to the Demo
cratic convention.
Opposes Disclaimer
When questioned about the dis
claimer affidavit which students
accepting government aid under
the National Defense Education
Act must sign, he said that Yale
and Harvard have refused the aid
under these conditions and that
he is very much opposed to such
a requirement.
He attributed it to the whole
business which started with Mc-
Carthy and which ho called ab
horrent. He said that this govern
ment delving into private life and ;
belief must stop.
Turning to the international
scene, Harriman said he is all for !
Eisenhower'* trip to Russia. Eis- 1
enhower is well known in Russia
from his leadership in World
War II as a general, although j
Franklin Roosevelt is the real
American hero to the Russian!
people, the former ambassador to I
Russia and one-time governor of.
New York said.
Russians Want Peace
"The Russian people want i
peace more than anything, and i
many of them will believe Eisen- j
hower when he says the Ameri-'
cans want peace; they will ques
tion the propaganda Russian ;
leaders give them that we are
aggressors.
"Eisenhower by his trip will j
undo a lot of damage he has done '
in the world. Much of the harm '
was created by leaving things to
Dulles."
Talked With Khrushchev
Harriman said that when he
talked with Khrushchev in Russia
recently, he told the Russian |
leader that the U.S. economy was
not dependent on defense produc-!
lion. He cited the minimum of I
difficulty the U.S. had in chang-j
ing from arms production to a
peacetime economy after World j
War 11. The government, how-1
ever, would have to take strong!
policies to accompany the change
over.
He believes that Khrushchev is
sincere in wanting a reduction
of Russia's defense spending in
order to enable him to build up
other parts of the economy.
