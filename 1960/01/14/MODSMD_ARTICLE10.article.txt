# Stanford Gives Presbyterians Med Facilities
## 
### 
i Stanford's old hospital and med
ical facilities in San Francisco
will become the City's new Pres
j byterian Hospital and Medical
j Center this April.
The land, buildings and equip
ment which the San Francisco
Presbytery acquires as a result
of the agreement were vacated by
Stanford last summer when the
Medical School moved to its new
j campus home.
The agreement, reached after
two years of negotiations, in
j volves turning over the entire Uni
versity hospital facility all
equipment and real estate •— to
a non-profit corporation of the
church formed to own and oper
ate the hospital.
Church Plans Modernization
The church will attempt to
raise $3 million needed to modern
ize the facilities immediately, and
an additional $12 million to make
it a major national center for
medicine.
Though entirely separate opera
tions, both sides hope to continue
a close association in which the
University could use the San
Francisco center for postgraduate
training of medical specialists.
The property, valued by Stan
lord at more than $3 million, in
cludes the Stanford and Lane
Hospital buildings, the old Medical
School structure, and a medical
accelerator building.
In addition the Presbytery will
receive the old School of Nursing,
Ruth Lucie Stern Research Lab
oratory, Lane Medical Library,
and several frame buildings.
New Research Structure
A new Stern research structure
will be built on campus to per
petuate the benefactor's 1939 gift
of research facilities.
The agreement was worked out
by John Russell Little for the
church and Board of Trustees
Chairman David Packard for the
University. It goes to the Board
for final approval Jan. 21. The
group approved it in principle,
awaiting Presbyterian confirma
tion, last Dec. 17.
