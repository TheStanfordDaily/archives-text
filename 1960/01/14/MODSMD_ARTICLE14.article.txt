On Sunday on "Meet the Press"
Sen. Symington refused to accept
the challenge which Sen. Ken
nedy had issued the week before.
The challenge was to meet him in
some Presidential primaries.
This challenge was based on
the new and strange doctrine
that no one deserves to be taken
seriously by the nominating con
vention who has not entered and
won a few primary elections.
To this challenge Son. Syming
ton has replied, quite fightly it
seems to rue, that his own state.
Missouri, does not have a Presi
dential primary, that in fad only
about one-third of all the states
have them, and that less than 10
per cent have primaries in which
the delegates are bound to a par
ticular candidate.
Thus if Sen. Kennedy's rule
is to become the unwritten law
of politics, the convention is
bound to nominate not the
choice of the delegates hut the
winner in two or three primary
fights. This amounts to saying
that the convention is not to lie
a deliberative body. It is a de
mand that the convention sur
render its judgment and abide
by the outcome of hand-shak
ing contests in a few widely
separated and arbitrarily se
lected states.
The Presidential primary was
invented with good intentions.
It was to limit the power of the
state bosses and to give the voters
a greater say in the nomination
of candidates. But since 1905,
when the Presidential primary
was first used in Wisconsin, it
has been adopted only in a few
states and in various complicated
forms.
It has never been adopted even
by a bare majority of the states.
In the states that do have pri
maries only a minority of them
provide for binding instructions

on lh<> delegates whom the regis
tered voters elect.
As a result, according to
Edwin S. C'orwin, there has
been «<» convention at which
the number of pledged dele
gates amounted to a majority
required to nominate a candi
date. Yet Sen. Kennedy's theory
is that it' Sen. Humphrey and
lie are the only candidates who
enter the Presidential primar
ies, no one else, not Symington,
not Johnson, not Stevenson,
not Bowles, is entitled to seri
ous consideration.
Why, we may ask, if the Presi
dential primary is all thai impor
tant and significant, do so few
states have serious primaries to
choose pledged delegates? For a
number of reasons, no doubt,
which have to do with the inter
ests of the party machines.
But a good and sufficient pub
lic reason is 1 hat the Presidential
primary is an extensive and ex
hausting ordeal which cheapens
the quality of the discussion of
national issues and puts an ex
cessive premium on the arts of
demagogy.
Sen. Symington has done the
country a service by rejecting
the idea that the candidate of the
Democratic party should be
chosen in two or ihree Presiden
tial primaries.
At the best, these scattered
and haphazard primary elec
tions should he regarded, it'
and when the votes have been
thoroughly analyzed, as sam
ples of public opinion to assist
the convention in making its
final judgment. They should
never, as Sen. Kennedy pro
poses, be treated as decisive.
For those who know politics
know only too well what can be
done in a primary by money and
by organized block voting,
