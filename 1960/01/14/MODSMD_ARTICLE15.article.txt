## ONE OPINION 
### 
Starting next Monday, and con
tinuing all next week, the Stan
ford Interfraternity Council will
sponsor its second annual Greek
Week. It's a week during which
the design is to bring a sharp i
focus on the very positive aspects i
of campus fraternity life.
Too often, and particularly in
recent years, very little has
been publicly said about the
merits of these Greek social
organizations. Unfortunate in
cidents, such as those that have
occurred at Southern Californ
ia, C.'al, and even here at Stan
ford, tend to blot out the good
marks on the record.
But these good marks do exist,
and they should be brought up
every so often. And along with
them, the work of Ihe ruling body
on most campuses, the Interfra
ternity Council, should he spot
lighted too.
Here at Stanford one of the
University's groat educators has j
stated that "man for man there
is more leadership, character and
alii lily on the row than anywhere
else on the campus." Fraternities,
ho went on, have had a great j
hand in producing this realization j
of potential.
Other men, speaking about
the positive worths of fraterni- j
ties, have intimated that there
is a something "irreplaceably
special" about the value of hav
ing participated in the "decid
edly different" social and liv
ing experiences that the Greeks
offer.
The mode of current opinion
is such that people these days
tend only 1o see the negative
aspects of fraternity life and ac
tion. That may bo because the
positive side is seldom publicized
or, as is most often true, people j
tend not 1o remember a compli
ment when it is paid, but seem to
always remember complaints.
Fraternities serve an important
housing, feeding and social func
tion on this campus as on any
other. For each of these valuable
aspects there is. not surprisingly,
a criticism.
For instance, socially, they
are criticized for "cliqueish
ness," but this too often carries t
the overtones of a bitter out
sider. Why is it unreasonable

to assume that an organization
set up tor social reasons, and
fairly selective in its member
ship, should keep its ('unctions
basically to itself?
Stanford fraternities sponsor
and helped create a "big brother
program" known as the Stanford
Area Youth Plan. This project is
directed at helping potential .ju
venile trouble-makers find ways
to fit into a law-abiding society.
Also, the houses sponsor Greek
Week which, while designed to
focus attention on the fraternity
system, nonetheless prov i d os
some campus excitement through
the open houses, chariot races and
the Queens' Games.
Individual projects of each
house, too numerous to men
tion, and the Kids' Day part of
Creek Week are also praise
worthy plans carried on by the
system. Kids' Day is devoted to
making youngsters realize how
important continuance of their
education and participation in
activities, such as athletics,
really are.
As a governing council, the IFC
functions with greater dispatch
and efficiency than any other
group on this campus. After hav
ing watched the ASSU Legisla
tures, Cardinals Board, and vari
ous other committees stumble
blindly through their businesses,
it was a pleasure to learn of one
group that knew where it was
going . . . and took the shortest
way lo it.
And the IFC has a history of
concrete, soundly based decisions.
From the sound metering out of
punishments to such profound
conclusions as the recent "re
ceivership" solution in the case
of a house's needed general re
birth, wise decisions of capable
and thoughtful and immerged
governors show through.
9ii the face of these actions,
and, hopefully, this look at the
fraternity system, perhaps some
of you will erase the red marks
that are visible on the "gen
eral impression" ledger when
ever the idea "fraternity" ap
pears.
Here is a system in which many
of its members justly find enjoy
ment, worth, and pride.
