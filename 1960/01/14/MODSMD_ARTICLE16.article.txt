# Salinger Talk Explodes Myth
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
Don't look now but a favorite
Farm myth exploded this year.
It's thai oft-discussed word which
only yesterday was the campus
motto. Apathy.
First came Kartozian. Over
night the football rooting section
changed from a small uncon
cerned body to a large happy or
ganization that actually booed
anyone who dared to leave before
the game was over.
It seems that this was only
the beginning./
Monday night William Wieg
and of the English department
gave an informal talk at Bow
man Alumni House on writer
J. I). Salinger. It was handled
by sophomore 1-es Roos and
junior Karen Krauskopf, mem
bers of the Student-Faculty
( ommittee.
Roos set up 30 chairs in the
main room of Bowman and was
fervently hoping that they would
be filled and save all concerned

from the acute embarrassment of
a small turnout.
Fully 200 people showed up
at H o'clock on that wet night.
This was the night, by the way,
that some fascinating little
talk on sex relationships was
being given in Cub her ley.
Wiegand gave his talk, read
some selections from Salinger
then opened up for a question
and answer session, while Roos
and probably Wiegand himself
had a hard time getting over
their bewilderment at the size
of the crowd.
The talk was excellent and the
questions and answers perceptive.
The significance of the event,
however, goes far beyond a cou
ple hundred people interested in
Salinger coming to hear one of
the best Salinger authorities
around. It lies rather in the fact
that nobody was able to foresee
how great the turnout would be.
The question now is: are there
other men at Stanford who

could bring out similar crowds
to informal gatherings simply
by talking about their special
ties? It takes less than a mo
ment's consideration to come
up with au undeniable affirma
tive.
For instances, how many peo
ple would come to hear Professor
William MeCord talk on the time
he spent as a consultant at San
Quentin and a boys' reformatory
in Massachusetts?
Mow many would come to hear
Professor Thomas Andrew
Bailey, one of the top historians
in the country, talk on his spe
cialty, Woodrow Wilson?
How many would come to
hear Nobel laureates Felix
Bloeh or Arthur Kornberg
speak? How about Wallace
Stegner, Richard Scovvcroft or
Wiegand oil what one has to go
through to get a book pub
lished? James T. Watkins IV
on international relations? Wil
bur Schramm on modern mass
communications? Richard I.a
Piere with something from bis
new book? The possibilities are
endless.
That, then, is the idea. From
here it looks 100 good to pass
up. Also the machinery to do the
job already exists: the Student-
Faculty Committee.
The Wiegand talk proved that
the interest exists. The proper
advantage s√üould be taken of
this interest and Stu-Fae Comm
is the organization that should
handle it.
This is not to knock them foi
not doing more in 1 his lino up to
now. They didn't know any more
than any of the rest of us how

well Wiegand would go over
They do now, however.
We only hope that they havt
more than 30 chairs for the nex
one.
