Kditor, The Daily:
NO! NO! NO! The A-V board is
not anti-Semitic, I'm sure! I my
self am Jewish and tend to notice
things that are anti-Semitic, and
when I saw the A-V board show
ing a little boy looking at the
defaced synagogue and the school
with the American flag, my feel
ing was that the board was rather
a model of the opposite of anti-
Semitism.
I felt that the person designing
the board was saying, "How can
we expect our children to believe
our spoken ideals (symbols: the
American flag, the schoolhouse)
when they see around them other
symbols (the defacement of a
synagogue with swastikas) that
show that their elders don't really
mean what ihey say."
I felt the "Symbols have mean
ing" part was making the point
that American children see all
of America's symbols, the bad as
well as the good, and that chil
dren won't be as sure that as
Americans they stand for religi
ous freedom when the symbols
they see on iho way home from
school teach them that America
includes hatred of Jews and de
facement of synagogues.
I was happy to see Mr. Wert
heim's strong opposition to what
he felt was anti-Semitism, but it
was a great surprise to me to
realize that the board should be
thought of an anti-Semitic at all.

We, the undersigned, in an ef
fort to establish a defense against
I he daily threat to our health and
sanity, and in order to make the
entire campus of Stanford Uni
versity a safer place in which to
live, do hereby declare war on
our hated aggressor, the two
wheeled, chain-driven menace
the bicycle.
We have been splashed on,
rolled over by, skidded at, and
narrowly missed by these ma
chines. We have found the camp
us roads blocked by spokes and
handlebars. We have found park
ing places (for which we pay $10
a year and seldom, if ever, find)
filled by dozens of bicycles.
Whenever we attempt to drive
over the campus roads, we as
sume the risk of a lawsuit.
If we are lucky, and do arrive
•safely at our destination, and
find a place to park, we then
take our lives in our hands by
attempting to walk across Quad
to our classes.
It is then that we meet our
enemy face to face, wheel to in
step. and in I he encounter with
the hordes of bicycles, it always
we, the pedestrians, who come
out second best. In short, bicycles
are a menace to our lives and
property.
Ultimately, we seek the ban of
bicycles on this campus. How
ever, realizing that this is at the
present time impossible, we in
tend to do everything within our
power to stamp out the barbaric
practice of bicycle-riding.
Therefore, take heed, bicyclists!
The next time you ride down the
middle of a campus street, or
the next time you run that stop
sign, or the next time you park in
front of a doorway, or the next
time you try to see "how close
you can come to that guy," re
member we are at war with you.
All is fair in war.

Concerning the 18 bowling

I lanes, I have some questions:
! Why? Did a majority of students
i desire that money be allocated
: for this purpose? I should think
that some sport involving less
initial and continuing investment,
such as playing cards or ping
pong, would provide just as con
{ vivial and exciting a ,pastime in
the new Union. If we want to run
and jump we still have the play
ing fields at the men's and worn

Concerning the 18 bowling

I lanes, I have some questions:
! Why? Did a majority of students
i desire that money be allocated
: for this purpose? I should think
that some sport involving less
initial and continuing investment,
such as playing cards or ping
pong, would provide just as con
{ vivial and exciting a ,pastime in
the new Union. If we want to run
and jump we still have the play
ing fields at the men's and worn
; en's gyms.

NO! NO! NO! The A-V board is
not anti-Semitic, I'm sure! I my
self am Jewish and tend to notice
things that are anti-Semitic, and
when I saw the A-V board show
ing a little boy looking at the
defaced synagogue and the school
with the American flag, my feel
ing was that the board was rather
a model of the opposite of anti-
Semitism.
I felt that the person designing
the board was saying, "How can
we expect our children to believe
our spoken ideals (symbols: the
American flag, the schoolhouse)
when they see around them other
symbols (the defacement of a
synagogue with swastikas) that
show that their elders don't really
mean what ihey say."
I felt the "Symbols have mean
ing" part was making the point
that American children see all
of America's symbols, the bad as
well as the good, and that chil
dren won't be as sure that as
Americans they stand for religi
ous freedom when the symbols
they see on iho way home from
school teach them that America
includes hatred of Jews and de
facement of synagogues.
I was happy to see Mr. Wert
heim's strong opposition to what
he felt was anti-Semitism, but it
was a great surprise to me to
realize that the board should be
thought of an anti-Semitic at all.

We, the undersigned, in an ef
fort to establish a defense against
I he daily threat to our health and
sanity, and in order to make the
entire campus of Stanford Uni
versity a safer place in which to
live, do hereby declare war on
our hated aggressor, the two
wheeled, chain-driven menace
the bicycle.
We have been splashed on,
rolled over by, skidded at, and
narrowly missed by these ma
chines. We have found the camp
us roads blocked by spokes and
handlebars. We have found park
ing places (for which we pay $10
a year and seldom, if ever, find)
filled by dozens of bicycles.
Whenever we attempt to drive
over the campus roads, we as
sume the risk of a lawsuit.
If we are lucky, and do arrive
•safely at our destination, and
find a place to park, we then
take our lives in our hands by
attempting to walk across Quad
to our classes.
It is then that we meet our
enemy face to face, wheel to in
step. and in I he encounter with
the hordes of bicycles, it always
we, the pedestrians, who come
out second best. In short, bicycles
are a menace to our lives and
property.
Ultimately, we seek the ban of
bicycles on this campus. How
ever, realizing that this is at the
present time impossible, we in
tend to do everything within our
power to stamp out the barbaric
practice of bicycle-riding.
Therefore, take heed, bicyclists!
The next time you ride down the
middle of a campus street, or
the next time you run that stop

time you try to see "how close
you can come to that guy," re

Therefore, take heed, bicyclists!
The next time you ride down the

Why Bowling?
Editor, The Daily:
Concerning the 18 bowling

I lanes, I have some questions:
! Why? Did a majority of students
i desire that money be allocated
: for this purpose? I should think
that some sport involving less
initial and continuing investment,
such as playing cards or ping
pong, would provide just as con
{ vivial and exciting a ,pastime in
the new Union. If we want to run
and jump we still have the play
ing fields at the men's and worn
; en's gyms.

Symbols
Kditor, The Daily:
NO! NO! NO! The A-V board is
not anti-Semitic, I'm sure! I my
self am Jewish and tend to notice
things that are anti-Semitic, and
when I saw the A-V board show
ing a little boy looking at the
defaced synagogue and the school
with the American flag, my feel
ing was that the board was rather
a model of the opposite of anti-
Semitism.
I felt that the person designing
the board was saying, "How can
we expect our children to believe
our spoken ideals (symbols: the
American flag, the schoolhouse)
when they see around them other
symbols (the defacement of a
synagogue with swastikas) that
show that their elders don't really
mean what ihey say."
I felt the "Symbols have mean
ing" part was making the point
that American children see all
of America's symbols, the bad as
well as the good, and that chil
dren won't be as sure that as
Americans they stand for religi
ous freedom when the symbols
they see on iho way home from
school teach them that America
includes hatred of Jews and de
facement of synagogues.
I was happy to see Mr. Wert
heim's strong opposition to what
he felt was anti-Semitism, but it
was a great surprise to me to
realize that the board should be
thought of an anti-Semitic at all.

Declaration of War
Kditor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned, in an ef
fort to establish a defense against
I he daily threat to our health and
sanity, and in order to make the
entire campus of Stanford Uni
versity a safer place in which to
live, do hereby declare war on
our hated aggressor, the two
wheeled, chain-driven menace
the bicycle.
We have been splashed on,
rolled over by, skidded at, and
narrowly missed by these ma
chines. We have found the camp
us roads blocked by spokes and
handlebars. We have found park
ing places (for which we pay $10
a year and seldom, if ever, find)
filled by dozens of bicycles.
Whenever we attempt to drive
over the campus roads, we as
sume the risk of a lawsuit.
If we are lucky, and do arrive
•safely at our destination, and
find a place to park, we then
take our lives in our hands by
attempting to walk across Quad
to our classes.
It is then that we meet our
enemy face to face, wheel to in
step. and in I he encounter with
the hordes of bicycles, it always
we, the pedestrians, who come
out second best. In short, bicycles
are a menace to our lives and
property.
Ultimately, we seek the ban of
bicycles on this campus. How
ever, realizing that this is at the
present time impossible, we in
tend to do everything within our
power to stamp out the barbaric
practice of bicycle-riding.
Therefore, take heed, bicyclists!
The next time you ride down the
middle of a campus street, or
the next time you run that stop
sign, or the next time you park in
front of a doorway, or the next
time you try to see "how close
you can come to that guy," re
member we are at war with you.
All is fair in war.
