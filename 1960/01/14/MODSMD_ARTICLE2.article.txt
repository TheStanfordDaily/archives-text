# PLAN FACULTY INCREASE
## Ford Foundation Gives Business School $1½ Million to Begin Ten-Year Program 
### 
Stanford's Graduate School of Business has been given a $1,.300,000 grant from the Ford Founda
tion, an early step toward a newly-formulated $28,800,000 ten-year development program, ii was an
nounced yesterday.
Half of the grant will be used to add senior faculty members, Ernest C. Arbuckle, dean of the school,
said.
A research professorship will get about $250,000 and $500,000 is to be spent during the next ten

years on faculty research pro
jects in business administration.
Four-Front Advances
The school's development plan
aims for important advances
along four fronts, Arbuckle said:
• An enriched two-year program
of professional education for
management leading to the
M.B.A. degree, with enrollment
gradually increasing from the
present 400 to 650 students.
• Vigorous research to expand
knowledge of administrative prob
lems and processes.
• A stepped-up doctoral program
to prepare specially qualified stu
dents for teaching and high level
research in business and govern
ment. Ph.D. candidates would in
crease from 10 tf> 100.
• Expansion of continuing educa
tion for mature advanced mana
gers in both short- and long-course
training.
Costs to Soar
Pointing out thAt the $28,800,-
000 figure is a cumulative figure
through 1970, Arbuckle noted that
annual operating cost for the
school will soar in the decade

from its present $898,000 to j
i $2,052,000.
Divisions of the ten-year cumu- i
lative price tag are $8,400,000 for
faculty and administrative salar
ies; $5,000,000, student aid; $2,000,-
000, secretarial, supplies, etc.;:
; $900,000, library, and $200,000,
i development of case teaching pro
gram.
The Ford money will be put to j
work in this area. So will the in
! come of a plan just being |
! launched called "Affiliates of the
Stanford University Graduate I
i School of Business" under which
; individuals and companies sub- j
scribe to annual memberships.
The goal for the program is 500
I members.

The school ireeds new office, j
classroom, conference and dormi- j
tory facilities. The school is now j
cramped into a building which
was remodeled from an auditor
ium 23 years ago.
"Our goal is to raise $3,000,000
in time to have ihe classroom and
office unit ready for occupancy in
1961," the dean declared.
Nearly $2,000,000 in endowment i
and bequests is already in hand ;
or committed.
"This is a tremendous task we
have for ourselves but our fac
ulty feels that we can and must
meet the challenges that face
business education," Arbuckle
said.
Different Business World
"Today's students will have to
be equipped to meet substantially
different business worlds in the
decades ahead. They will have
productive professional careers
beyond the year 2000. This fact
alone causes our faculty to ap
proach its task with awe."
In giving greater emphasis to
environmental and human ele- 1
merits of administration. Business
School students will take more
classes in other departments of |
the University, such as sociology
and psychology, besides business j
courses.
