True Meaning
Editor, The Daily:
In answer to yesterday's letter
In The Daily on the subject of the
"anti-Semitic display" in the edu
cation building, 1 wish to point
out something. One of the three
persons involved in conceiving
and setting up the display is a
Jew.
In the light of this fact, I sug
gest to Mr. Wertheim that he go
back, look a! the display, and con
sider the true meaning.
