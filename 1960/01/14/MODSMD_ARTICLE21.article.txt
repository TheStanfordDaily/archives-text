The lii" Man
An interesting subject which came up in various places including
Jimmy Jemail's Answer Box column in Sports I Must rated over the
Christmas vacation was the effect the big man a la Wilt Chamber
lain is having on basketball.
Several of the players and coaches were interviewed by Jeniail
and asked if they thought the ascension of the Chamberlains, Kill
Russells, (eic. > was ruining the game of basketball by turning it into
a battle of the giants.
Most of the players and coaches believed that the "Big Man," if
anything, was helping the game. However, IJolph Schayes, high scor
ing forward on the Syracuse Nats, had a novel idea which he thought
might reduce the importance of the giant and put a little more out
side shooting back in the game.
Schayes proposed that a range bo made somewhere around 20

feet away from the basket from
behind which all baskets sunk
would bo worth three instead of
two points. By giving the extra
bonus point for a shot from
further away, long sot shots
would most probably be encour
aged.
If this plan could be practically
introduced it sounds to me like
the best of many recent proposals
which have been put forth to try
to bring the game of basketball
out of the key.
The other proposals such as
the raising of the basket from its
current height of ten feet to a
new level of twelve doesn't appear
to really be a solution to the prob
lem. The raising of the basket
might eliminate the easy dunk
lay in or the half hook which has
become popular with the taller
sot, but it still does little to elevi
ale the problem of the relative
advantage of the big man. The
big man is still nearer to the
basket and should still bo able
to dominate.

With tho bonus point in effect, teams might try to rely on one
good outside shot rather than the gigantic center. An even better
some games might turn into a battle of the big man versus tho little
outside shooter.
Perhaps tho most important advantage of a bonus point rule
would be the fact that it would put, and 1 use-this term loosely,
skill back in basketball. More emphasis would be shifted to shooting
proficiency rather than working iho ball to some giant who, after
fighting eight opponents off his back, sinks a layup.

More Conducive to Good Shooting
Not that is doesn't take a certain amount of skill to thhow a crew
of defensive men off one's back, hut somehow basketball just seems
to bo a game that is conducive to good shooting not just good plovv
manship.
Imagine the increased value a shot like John Arrillaga would
lake on under the new rule.
Of course, the big drawback in the now plan is finding a practical
way to put the rule into effect. There probably would be many
disputes as to whether the shot was taken from in front, behind, or
right on, the arbitrary line. And how about a follow through that
brings the shooter across the 20 foot range. Perhaps some mechanical
device could bo rigged up with electric eyes to administer the new
rule, but could every YIVICA gymnasium in the nation supply such a
machine for the benefit of all the weekend hoopsters?
Anyway it's a good idea if anyone ran come up with a practical
way of applying it.
Incidently anyone interested in seeing I he effect of the Wilt Cham
berlains on pro basketball should plan on going up to the Cow Palace
on the 31st of this month. Wilt and his Philadelphia team mates
will be in Sail Francisco to take on the Minneapolis Lakers and Elgin
Baylor.
Winning Streaks
Talking about home court winning streaks Stanford's season and
a half streak was broken earlier this season look at the one rolled
up by St. Bonavciitlire's.
The Bonnies beat Niagara in Olean Armory, their home floor,
twelve years ago and since that time they're rolled up 90 straight
wins at Olean. Maybe Bonnie Coach Ed Donovan ought to arrange
an exhibition game with the NBA All-Stars to be played at Olean?

Schayes proposed that a range bo made somewhere around 20

feet away from the basket from
behind which all baskets sunk
would bo worth three instead of
two points. By giving the extra
bonus point for a shot from
further away, long sot shots
would most probably be encour
aged.
If this plan could be practically
introduced it sounds to me like
the best of many recent proposals
which have been put forth to try
to bring the game of basketball
out of the key.
The other proposals such as
the raising of the basket from its
current height of ten feet to a
new level of twelve doesn't appear
to really be a solution to the prob
lem. The raising of the basket
might eliminate the easy dunk
lay in or the half hook which has
become popular with the taller
sot, but it still does little to elevi
ale the problem of the relative
advantage of the big man. The
big man is still nearer to the
basket and should still bo able
to dominate.

With tho bonus point in effect, teams might try to rely on one
good outside shot rather than the gigantic center. An even better
some games might turn into a battle of the big man versus tho little
outside shooter.
Perhaps tho most important advantage of a bonus point rule
would be the fact that it would put, and 1 use-this term loosely,
skill back in basketball. More emphasis would be shifted to shooting
proficiency rather than working iho ball to some giant who, after
fighting eight opponents off his back, sinks a layup.

More Conducive to Good Shooting
Not that is doesn't take a certain amount of skill to thhow a crew
of defensive men off one's back, hut somehow basketball just seems
to bo a game that is conducive to good shooting not just good plovv
manship.
Imagine the increased value a shot like John Arrillaga would
lake on under the new rule.
Of course, the big drawback in the now plan is finding a practical
way to put the rule into effect. There probably would be many
disputes as to whether the shot was taken from in front, behind, or
right on, the arbitrary line. And how about a follow through that
brings the shooter across the 20 foot range. Perhaps some mechanical
device could bo rigged up with electric eyes to administer the new
rule, but could every YIVICA gymnasium in the nation supply such a
machine for the benefit of all the weekend hoopsters?
Anyway it's a good idea if anyone ran come up with a practical
way of applying it.
Incidently anyone interested in seeing I he effect of the Wilt Cham
berlains on pro basketball should plan on going up to the Cow Palace
on the 31st of this month. Wilt and his Philadelphia team mates
will be in Sail Francisco to take on the Minneapolis Lakers and Elgin
Baylor.
Winning Streaks
Talking about home court winning streaks Stanford's season and
a half streak was broken earlier this season look at the one rolled
up by St. Bonavciitlire's.
The Bonnies beat Niagara in Olean Armory, their home floor,
twelve years ago and since that time they're rolled up 90 straight
wins at Olean. Maybe Bonnie Coach Ed Donovan ought to arrange
an exhibition game with the NBA All-Stars to be played at Olean?

An interesting subject which came up in various places including
Jimmy Jemail's Answer Box column in Sports I Must rated over the
Christmas vacation was the effect the big man a la Wilt Chamber

Several of the players and coaches were interviewed by Jeniail
and asked if they thought the ascension of the Chamberlains, Kill
Russells, (eic. > was ruining the game of basketball by turning it into
a battle of the giants.
Most of the players and coaches believed that the "Big Man," if

lay in or the half hook which has
become popular with the taller
sot, but it still does little to elevi
ale the problem of the relative
advantage of the big man. The
big man is still nearer to the
basket and should still bo able
to dominate.

With tho bonus point in effect, teams might try to rely on one
good outside shot rather than the gigantic center. An even better
some games might turn into a battle of the big man versus tho little
outside shooter.
Perhaps tho most important advantage of a bonus point rule
would be the fact that it would put, and 1 use-this term loosely,
skill back in basketball. More emphasis would be shifted to shooting
proficiency rather than working iho ball to some giant who, after
fighting eight opponents off his back, sinks a layup.

More Conducive to Good Shooting
Not that is doesn't take a certain amount of skill to thhow a crew
of defensive men off one's back, hut somehow basketball just seems
to bo a game that is conducive to good shooting not just good plovv
manship.
Imagine the increased value a shot like John Arrillaga would
lake on under the new rule.
Of course, the big drawback in the now plan is finding a practical
way to put the rule into effect. There probably would be many
disputes as to whether the shot was taken from in front, behind, or
right on, the arbitrary line. And how about a follow through that
brings the shooter across the 20 foot range. Perhaps some mechanical
device could bo rigged up with electric eyes to administer the new
rule, but could every YIVICA gymnasium in the nation supply such a
machine for the benefit of all the weekend hoopsters?
Anyway it's a good idea if anyone ran come up with a practical
way of applying it.
Incidently anyone interested in seeing I he effect of the Wilt Cham
berlains on pro basketball should plan on going up to the Cow Palace
on the 31st of this month. Wilt and his Philadelphia team mates
will be in Sail Francisco to take on the Minneapolis Lakers and Elgin
Baylor.
Winning Streaks
Talking about home court winning streaks Stanford's season and
a half streak was broken earlier this season look at the one rolled
up by St. Bonavciitlire's.
The Bonnies beat Niagara in Olean Armory, their home floor,
twelve years ago and since that time they're rolled up 90 straight
wins at Olean. Maybe Bonnie Coach Ed Donovan ought to arrange
an exhibition game with the NBA All-Stars to be played at Olean?
