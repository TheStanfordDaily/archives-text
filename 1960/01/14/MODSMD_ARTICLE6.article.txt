# U.S. Should Not Let Fear of Inflation Cut Security, Economic Aid Budgets
## 
### Sieve Freidberg 
Averell Harriman emphasized last night to a capacity crowd in Memorial Auditorium that the
| United States is engaged in an all-out competition with Soviet Russia, the outcome of which will
determine whether American freedom and democracy survives; but he said that if this country as
summes initiative and gets over its fear of inflation, there is no doubt in his mind who the winner
I will be.
Harriman, who will speak again today at 4:15, said that the coexistence Khrushchev advocates is

not the kind of peace that we
want but is peace that will en
able him to spread the Commu
nist system to the rest of the
world without military force but
with economic and political
methods. The United States must
accept this fact and fight back
with all the resources of a free
society, not sit back and worry,
letting the fear of inflation re
duce spending for security, eco
nomic aid, and an expanded econ
omy.
World Revolution
Khrushchev is still determined
to further world revolution, Har
riman concluded as a result of
several talks with the Russian
leader. Khrushchev is confident
that he will succeed as a result
of the great economic develop
ment in Russia since the war. He
honestly believes that Russia's
development will enable it to bury
the United States, in the histori
cal sense, and that his country
will surpass the U.S. in every
field of endeavor within a matter
of a few decades.
He admitted to Harriman that
America "would be among the
last to succumb to Communism,"
but he firmly thinks that the un
der-developed countries represent
fertile fields for Communism.
Immediate Cliallange
This, according to Harriman, is
the immediate challenge the U.S.
faces and it must be met with
leadership and cooperation.
Harriman cited one of Russia's
weaknesses as an underestima
tion of the abilities of the U.S.
He said numerous Russian econo
mists told him they didn't believe
America could expand more than
two per cent. "I told Khrushchev
to fire them and get some new
economists."
A second weakness is lack of
consumer goods, as Russia ex
pends 20 per cent of its national
product for defense, as compared
to ten per cent for the U.S.
Confidence
Harriman expressed confidence
in the American brand of educa
tion and said he does not possibly
see how we can lose the race with
the type of student who is now in
the universities and colleges of
this country. He compared the
U.S. system to the Russian meth
of of turning out students like an
assembly line with a lack of edu
cational freedom, although he did
say that the highest rewards in
the Soviet society are for intelee
tual contribution.
Harriman will meet this morn
ing with the student rapporteurs
of the discussion groups which i
followed his talks, and he will
hold a press conference at 2:30
this afternoon. After his speech
this afternoon there will be a re-j
ception and question and answer
period in his honor at 8 p.m. in
Toyon Hall, to which the public
is invited.

several talks with the Russian
leader. Khrushchev is confident
that he will succeed as a result
of the great economic develop
ment in Russia since the war. He
honestly believes that Russia's
development will enable it to bury
the United States, in the histori
cal sense, and that his country
will surpass the U.S. in every
field of endeavor within a matter
of a few decades.
He admitted to Harriman that
America "would be among the
last to succumb to Communism,"
but he firmly thinks that the un
der-developed countries represent
fertile fields for Communism.
Immediate Cliallange
This, according to Harriman, is
the immediate challenge the U.S.
faces and it must be met with
leadership and cooperation.
Harriman cited one of Russia's
weaknesses as an underestima
tion of the abilities of the U.S.
He said numerous Russian econo
mists told him they didn't believe
America could expand more than
two per cent. "I told Khrushchev
to fire them and get some new
economists."
A second weakness is lack of
consumer goods, as Russia ex
pends 20 per cent of its national
product for defense, as compared
to ten per cent for the U.S.
Confidence
Harriman expressed confidence
in the American brand of educa
tion and said he does not possibly
see how we can lose the race with
the type of student who is now in
the universities and colleges of
this country. He compared the
U.S. system to the Russian meth
of of turning out students like an
assembly line with a lack of edu
cational freedom, although he did
say that the highest rewards in
the Soviet society are for intelee
tual contribution.
Harriman will meet this morn
ing with the student rapporteurs
of the discussion groups which i
followed his talks, and he will
hold a press conference at 2:30
this afternoon. After his speech
this afternoon there will be a re-j
ception and question and answer
period in his honor at 8 p.m. in
Toyon Hall, to which the public
is invited.
Averell Harriman emphasized last night to a capacity crowd in Memorial Auditorium that the
| United States is engaged in an all-out competition with Soviet Russia, the outcome of which will
determine whether American freedom and democracy survives; but he said that if this country as
summes initiative and gets over its fear of inflation, there is no doubt in his mind who the winner
I will be.
Harriman, who will speak again today at 4:15, said that the coexistence Khrushchev advocates is

not the kind of peace that we
want but is peace that will en
able him to spread the Commu
nist system to the rest of the
world without military force but
with economic and political
methods. The United States must
accept this fact and fight back
with all the resources of a free
society, not sit back and worry,
letting the fear of inflation re
duce spending for security, eco
nomic aid, and an expanded econ
omy.

Khrushchev is still determined
to further world revolution, Har
riman concluded as a result of
several talks with the Russian
leader. Khrushchev is confident
