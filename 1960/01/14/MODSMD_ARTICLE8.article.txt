## Soviet Union Abolishes Dept. of Internal Affairs 
### 
MOSCOW (/Pi — The Soviet Union yesterday announced Ihe
abolition of tlie Ministry of Internal Affairs and the transfer of its
functions to the nation's various republics.
The move means decentralization of the state police assigned
to deal with ordinary crime.
The powers of the once dreaded ministry, the MVD which con-

I trolled the secret police and con
ducted the purges of the Stalin
days, gradually have been vvhit
! tied away since the emergence of
the leadership of Premier Nikita
S. Khrushchev.
Propaganda Action
The abolition of the Ministry of
Internal Affairs suggests more
I than .just diffusion of authority,
j Associated Press news analyst
[ William L. Ryan noted.
Ryan noted the action could
i have a far more important mean
ing in terms of propaganda both
j in the Soviet Union and abroad
! as a sign that the last remnants
jof the Stalinist era have been
eliminated.
The writer added that the So
j viet Union is about to launch a
! massive worldwide propaganda
; campaign to increase the prestige
of the Soviet Union and increase
the respectability it won in 1959
by Khrushchev's visit to the Unit
ed States, and that abolition of
the ministry could be a blow in
that campaign.
'Related Factors'
Word that the ministry had
been abolished came a few hours
after the news that Alexi I. Ki
richenko, a protege of Khrush
chev, was being moved to an ob
scure post on the Rostov-on-Don
district. The announcements in no
way connected the two actions.
But observers speculated there
might have been some related
factors. It was suggested Kiri
chenko may have been moved
from the Moscow limelight be-
I cause he opposed the ministry's
j abolition.
Kirichenko, a member of the
party Presidium, often has been
; mentioned abroad as heir appar
ent to Khrushchev himself.
These moves also coincided with
another switch in high level So
viet jobs. An announcement by
the official news agency Tass dis
closed that Jacob Malik, veteran
diplomat, has been relieved of his
job as ambassador to London.

Propaganda Action
The abolition of the Ministry of
Internal Affairs suggests more
I than .just diffusion of authority,
j Associated Press news analyst
[ William L. Ryan noted.
Ryan noted the action could
i have a far more important mean
ing in terms of propaganda both
j in the Soviet Union and abroad
! as a sign that the last remnants
jof the Stalinist era have been
eliminated.
The writer added that the So
j viet Union is about to launch a
! massive worldwide propaganda
; campaign to increase the prestige
of the Soviet Union and increase
the respectability it won in 1959
by Khrushchev's visit to the Unit
ed States, and that abolition of
the ministry could be a blow in
that campaign.
'Related Factors'
Word that the ministry had
been abolished came a few hours
after the news that Alexi I. Ki
richenko, a protege of Khrush
chev, was being moved to an ob
scure post on the Rostov-on-Don
district. The announcements in no
way connected the two actions.
But observers speculated there
might have been some related
factors. It was suggested Kiri
chenko may have been moved
from the Moscow limelight be-
I cause he opposed the ministry's
j abolition.
Kirichenko, a member of the
party Presidium, often has been
; mentioned abroad as heir appar
ent to Khrushchev himself.
These moves also coincided with
another switch in high level So
viet jobs. An announcement by
the official news agency Tass dis
closed that Jacob Malik, veteran
diplomat, has been relieved of his
job as ambassador to London.

abolition of tlie Ministry of Internal Affairs and the transfer of its
functions to the nation's various republics.

I trolled the secret police and con
ducted the purges of the Stalin
days, gradually have been vvhit
! tied away since the emergence of
the leadership of Premier Nikita
S. Khrushchev.
