# Harriman Says U.S. Students Should Study Russian Theory
## Stresses U.S. Responsibility To Foreign Aid Programs 
### Steve Freidberg 
Averell Harriman, guest lecturer for the 1960 Foreign Policy
Institute, said yesterday afternoon that it should bo compulsory for
college students to take a course in Communist philosophy.
Harriman, giving his concluding speech of the Institute, ex
plained his statement by saying that "We should know what they
(the Russians) are thinking about and what they are after."
He said that the purpose of Russian education is to develop
people who will conform with the ideas of Lenin and Stalin. History
books are even rewritten to accomplish this aim. and Mark Twain
is given a Communist interpretation, he mentioned.
The attempt to produce the "communal man" has been unsuc
cessful in the last 40 years, as is evidenced by efforts at individuality

in building private homes differ
ent from others and by the fer
ment which is beginning to evolve
among students. "Our objective
is to develop the inquiring mind;
Soviet education doesn't do this,"
Harriman commented.
Turning to the fear of inflation I
which he mentioned in his speech j
Wednesday, Harriman said that!
a superlative job has been done j
by the Republican Administration
n terrifying the people of infla
'ion; even more than of the
tomic bomb or a world war. He
said that in advocating a program
to curb inflation, President Eisen
hower has paid more attention to
his budget director than to his
economic and foreign aid advis
! ors.
Foreign Responsibility
Harriman stressed that he was
| firmly opposed to inflation, but
I he didn't think that efforts to
| combat it should interfere with
j greater needs. "We should not be
i afraid to do those things that are
j necessary for our foreign respon
i sibility."
He claimed that the tight
j money policy has not done what
it was intended to do, although
it has succeeded in reducing
growth without which it is im
possible to have a good security
and foreign aid program. "1 place
growth in the economy of para
! mount importance, with the re
duction of inflation in second
place."
Harriman said that a good
foreign aid program should be
approached in the same manner
as was the Marshall Plan, and that
the undeveloped countries can ab
sorb three billion dollars a year
ever the five billion which is now
given from all sources. He
guessed about half of this in
crease would be contributed by
the U.S.
Three Reasons
Three reasons the Marshall plan
succeeded, according to Harriman,
are:
• The,aid-receiving countries as
sisted in the plan and decided up
on division of the funds;
• It was financed over a period
of time, four years;
• It was adequately financed.
Any present plan for the un
derdeveloped countries should
have the same provisions.
The formation of such a plan
; could be done either by an inter
national organization such as the
| United Nations, or on a regional
basis as was the Marshall Plan,
but in any case it should include
Russia's aid. Once a country gets
a good start, it can carry on its
economy with its own resources
land through normal borrowing
< hannels, he said.
Harriman cited India as being
close to this point, and said that
with about a billion more dollars
supplied from the outside, India's
Five Year Plan starting next year
j will be successful in attaining a
| healthy econimy. The other Asian
countries are looking at India and
j the battle between China and
India in economic expansion, and
the results will have profound af
fect on Asia, he said.
Agricultural Surpluses
The United States' agriculturalj
surpluses should be used, as they
I are essential to some countries
so their people can work and their '
{industry and agriculture * can |
grow, and so not all their, re-1
sources are used for the produc
tion of food.
The gifts of surplus food should j
I not he considered a disposal,
j which Harriman likened to a swill |
I pail, but should rather be called
i a valuable usage of this food.
Harriman indicated that no
; congressman will vote for foreign 1
; aid since no foreigner can vote, 1
| but the only way to get foreign
aid through Congress is to have
I the President impress upon the j
people the importance of foreign j
aid. The people should decide
; what is the right thing to do and i

demand it of the public leaders, |
he said.
Although the Communist lead
ers make il appear so, the real
conflict in the world is not he-!
tween capitalism and comma-1
nism, Harriman stated; it is be
tween ideological concepts. The |
word "capitalism" in the Far East
is synonomous wtih "imperial-!
ism," and it will be impossible
to change this effect of the word, j
he insisted.
The U.S. must not fall into the!
trap of pitting communism
against capitalism, when the
struggle is really among those j
countries that believe in the free-!
dom of the individual and human 1
dignity and those that believe in
the Communist dictatorship.
Manpower Reduction
Harriman said that the Russian :
arms and manpower reduction an-!
nouneed yesterday is not a sin-!
cere start at disarmament. He ex
plained the move as a change on
Khrushchev's part in his military
concept. The Russian leader feels |
he will got more military capabil-!
ity by concentrating his strength I
in several areas and reducing it i
in others.
Also, Khrushchev wants to re- i
lease some men to work in in-1
dustries, as there is a manpower |
shortage in Russia resulting from j
World War 11. Harriman pointed i
out that he hopes Khrushchev's
announcement does not cause a
further let down in effort for this
country.
In concluding, Harriman stated
that Americans should take great j
pride in the welcome which the
President got on his recent trip; j
however, he said I hat the political I
issues in the campaign depend on
what Eisenhower does this winter.
If he doesn't develop a better
foreign program of broad vision,
there will be disillusionment in
many of the countries he visited.
Red China
At a press conference yester
day afternoon, Harriman said he
was not sure Red China would ac
cept recognition from the U.S. |
without being given Formosa. He :
commented that the best plan for ;
the time being is to let the matter i
alone and watch developments in j
Asia between China and other
countries. Then the U.S. should
talk to friendly count l ies in Asia
tc find out their ideas.

Manpower Reduction
Harriman said that the Russian :
arms and manpower reduction an-!
nouneed yesterday is not a sin-!

plained the move as a change on
Khrushchev's part in his military
concept. The Russian leader feels |
he will got more military capabil-!
ity by concentrating his strength I
in several areas and reducing it i
in others.
Also, Khrushchev wants to re- i
lease some men to work in in-1
dustries, as there is a manpower |
shortage in Russia resulting from j
World War 11. Harriman pointed i
out that he hopes Khrushchev's
announcement does not cause a
further let down in effort for this
country.
In concluding, Harriman stated
that Americans should take great j
pride in the welcome which the
President got on his recent trip; j
however, he said I hat the political I
issues in the campaign depend on
what Eisenhower does this winter.
If he doesn't develop a better
foreign program of broad vision,
there will be disillusionment in
many of the countries he visited.
Red China
At a press conference yester
day afternoon, Harriman said he
was not sure Red China would ac
cept recognition from the U.S. |
without being given Formosa. He :
commented that the best plan for ;
the time being is to let the matter i
alone and watch developments in j
Asia between China and other
countries. Then the U.S. should
talk to friendly count l ies in Asia

HARROVIAN: "A SUPERLATIVE JOB HAS BEEN DONE
by (lie Republican Administration in terrifying the people of in
flation . . . President Eisenhower has paid more attention to his
budget director than to his economic and foreign aid advisors."
Averell Harriman, guest lecturer for the 1960 Foreign Policy
Institute, said yesterday afternoon that it should bo compulsory for
college students to take a course in Communist philosophy.
Harriman, giving his concluding speech of the Institute, ex
plained his statement by saying that "We should know what they
(the Russians) are thinking about and what they are after."
He said that the purpose of Russian education is to develop
people who will conform with the ideas of Lenin and Stalin. History
books are even rewritten to accomplish this aim. and Mark Twain
is given a Communist interpretation, he mentioned.
The attempt to produce the "communal man" has been unsuc
cessful in the last 40 years, as is evidenced by efforts at individuality

in building private homes differ
ent from others and by the fer
ment which is beginning to evolve
among students. "Our objective
is to develop the inquiring mind;
Soviet education doesn't do this,"
Harriman commented.
Turning to the fear of inflation I
which he mentioned in his speech j
Wednesday, Harriman said that!
a superlative job has been done j
by the Republican Administration
n terrifying the people of infla
'ion; even more than of the
tomic bomb or a world war. He
said that in advocating a program
to curb inflation, President Eisen
hower has paid more attention to
his budget director than to his
economic and foreign aid advis
! ors.
Foreign Responsibility
Harriman stressed that he was
| firmly opposed to inflation, but
I he didn't think that efforts to
| combat it should interfere with
j greater needs. "We should not be
i afraid to do those things that are
j necessary for our foreign respon
i sibility."
He claimed that the tight
j money policy has not done what
it was intended to do, although
it has succeeded in reducing
growth without which it is im
possible to have a good security
and foreign aid program. "1 place
growth in the economy of para
! mount importance, with the re
duction of inflation in second
place."
Harriman said that a good
foreign aid program should be
approached in the same manner
as was the Marshall Plan, and that
the undeveloped countries can ab
sorb three billion dollars a year
ever the five billion which is now
given from all sources. He
guessed about half of this in
crease would be contributed by
the U.S.
Three Reasons
Three reasons the Marshall plan
succeeded, according to Harriman,
are:
• The,aid-receiving countries as
sisted in the plan and decided up
on division of the funds;
• It was financed over a period
of time, four years;
• It was adequately financed.
Any present plan for the un
derdeveloped countries should
have the same provisions.
The formation of such a plan
; could be done either by an inter
national organization such as the
| United Nations, or on a regional
basis as was the Marshall Plan,
but in any case it should include
Russia's aid. Once a country gets
a good start, it can carry on its
economy with its own resources
land through normal borrowing
< hannels, he said.
Harriman cited India as being
close to this point, and said that
with about a billion more dollars
supplied from the outside, India's
Five Year Plan starting next year
j will be successful in attaining a
| healthy econimy. The other Asian
countries are looking at India and
j the battle between China and
India in economic expansion, and
the results will have profound af
fect on Asia, he said.
Agricultural Surpluses
The United States' agriculturalj
surpluses should be used, as they
I are essential to some countries
so their people can work and their '
{industry and agriculture * can |
grow, and so not all their, re-1
sources are used for the produc
tion of food.

is to develop the inquiring mind;
Soviet education doesn't do this,"
Harriman commented.
Turning to the fear of inflation I
which he mentioned in his speech j
Wednesday, Harriman said that!
a superlative job has been done j
by the Republican Administration
n terrifying the people of infla
'ion; even more than of the
tomic bomb or a world war. He
said that in advocating a program
to curb inflation, President Eisen
hower has paid more attention to
his budget director than to his
economic and foreign aid advis
! ors.
Foreign Responsibility
Harriman stressed that he was
| firmly opposed to inflation, but
I he didn't think that efforts to
| combat it should interfere with
j greater needs. "We should not be
i afraid to do those things that are
j necessary for our foreign respon
i sibility."
He claimed that the tight
j money policy has not done what
it was intended to do, although
it has succeeded in reducing
growth without which it is im
possible to have a good security
and foreign aid program. "1 place
growth in the economy of para
! mount importance, with the re
duction of inflation in second
place."
Harriman said that a good
foreign aid program should be
approached in the same manner
as was the Marshall Plan, and that
the undeveloped countries can ab
sorb three billion dollars a year
ever the five billion which is now
given from all sources. He
guessed about half of this in
crease would be contributed by
the U.S.
Three Reasons
Three reasons the Marshall plan
succeeded, according to Harriman,
are:
• The,aid-receiving countries as
sisted in the plan and decided up
on division of the funds;
• It was financed over a period
of time, four years;
• It was adequately financed.
Any present plan for the un
derdeveloped countries should
have the same provisions.
The formation of such a plan
; could be done either by an inter
national organization such as the
| United Nations, or on a regional
basis as was the Marshall Plan,
but in any case it should include
Russia's aid. Once a country gets
a good start, it can carry on its
economy with its own resources
land through normal borrowing
< hannels, he said.
Harriman cited India as being
close to this point, and said that
with about a billion more dollars
supplied from the outside, India's
Five Year Plan starting next year
j will be successful in attaining a
| healthy econimy. The other Asian
countries are looking at India and
j the battle between China and
India in economic expansion, and
the results will have profound af
fect on Asia, he said.
Agricultural Surpluses
The United States' agriculturalj
surpluses should be used, as they
I are essential to some countries
so their people can work and their '
{industry and agriculture * can |
grow, and so not all their, re-1
sources are used for the produc
tion of food.
The gifts of surplus food should j
I not he considered a disposal,
j which Harriman likened to a swill |
I pail, but should rather be called
i a valuable usage of this food.
Harriman indicated that no
; congressman will vote for foreign 1
; aid since no foreigner can vote, 1
| but the only way to get foreign
aid through Congress is to have
I the President impress upon the j
people the importance of foreign j
aid. The people should decide

he said.
Although the Communist lead
ers make il appear so, the real
conflict in the world is not he-!
tween capitalism and comma-1
nism, Harriman stated; it is be
tween ideological concepts. The |
word "capitalism" in the Far East
is synonomous wtih "imperial-!
ism," and it will be impossible
to change this effect of the word, j
he insisted.
The U.S. must not fall into the!
trap of pitting communism
against capitalism, when the
struggle is really among those j
countries that believe in the free-!
dom of the individual and human 1
dignity and those that believe in
the Communist dictatorship.
Manpower Reduction
Harriman said that the Russian :
arms and manpower reduction an-!
nouneed yesterday is not a sin-!
cere start at disarmament. He ex
plained the move as a change on
Khrushchev's part in his military
concept. The Russian leader feels |
he will got more military capabil-!
ity by concentrating his strength I
in several areas and reducing it i
in others.
Also, Khrushchev wants to re- i
lease some men to work in in-1
dustries, as there is a manpower |
shortage in Russia resulting from j
World War 11. Harriman pointed i
out that he hopes Khrushchev's
announcement does not cause a
further let down in effort for this
country.
In concluding, Harriman stated
that Americans should take great j
pride in the welcome which the
President got on his recent trip; j
however, he said I hat the political I
issues in the campaign depend on
what Eisenhower does this winter.
If he doesn't develop a better
foreign program of broad vision,
there will be disillusionment in
many of the countries he visited.
Red China
At a press conference yester
day afternoon, Harriman said he
was not sure Red China would ac
cept recognition from the U.S. |
without being given Formosa. He :
commented that the best plan for ;
the time being is to let the matter i
alone and watch developments in j
Asia between China and other
countries. Then the U.S. should
talk to friendly count l ies in Asia

Averell Harriman, guest lecturer for the 1960 Foreign Policy

Harriman, giving his concluding speech of the Institute, ex

He said that the purpose of Russian education is to develop

is given a Communist interpretation, he mentioned.
The attempt to produce the "communal man" has been unsuc

word "capitalism" in the Far East
is synonomous wtih "imperial-!
ism," and it will be impossible
to change this effect of the word, j
he insisted.
The U.S. must not fall into the!
trap of pitting communism
against capitalism, when the
struggle is really among those j
countries that believe in the free-!
dom of the individual and human 1
dignity and those that believe in
the Communist dictatorship.
Manpower Reduction
Harriman said that the Russian :
arms and manpower reduction an-!
nouneed yesterday is not a sin-!
cere start at disarmament. He ex
plained the move as a change on
Khrushchev's part in his military
concept. The Russian leader feels |
he will got more military capabil-!
ity by concentrating his strength I
in several areas and reducing it i
in others.
Also, Khrushchev wants to re- i
lease some men to work in in-1
dustries, as there is a manpower |
shortage in Russia resulting from j
World War 11. Harriman pointed i
out that he hopes Khrushchev's
announcement does not cause a
further let down in effort for this
country.
In concluding, Harriman stated
that Americans should take great j
pride in the welcome which the
President got on his recent trip; j
however, he said I hat the political I
issues in the campaign depend on
what Eisenhower does this winter.
If he doesn't develop a better
foreign program of broad vision,
there will be disillusionment in
many of the countries he visited.
Red China
At a press conference yester
day afternoon, Harriman said he
was not sure Red China would ac
cept recognition from the U.S. |
without being given Formosa. He :
commented that the best plan for ;
the time being is to let the matter i
alone and watch developments in j
Asia between China and other
countries. Then the U.S. should
talk to friendly count l ies in Asia
tc find out their ideas.

HARROVIAN: "A SUPERLATIVE JOB HAS BEEN DONE
by (lie Republican Administration in terrifying the people of in
flation . . . President Eisenhower has paid more attention to his
budget director than to his economic and foreign aid advisors."
Averell Harriman, guest lecturer for the 1960 Foreign Policy
Institute, said yesterday afternoon that it should bo compulsory for
college students to take a course in Communist philosophy.
Harriman, giving his concluding speech of the Institute, ex
plained his statement by saying that "We should know what they
(the Russians) are thinking about and what they are after."
He said that the purpose of Russian education is to develop
people who will conform with the ideas of Lenin and Stalin. History
books are even rewritten to accomplish this aim. and Mark Twain
is given a Communist interpretation, he mentioned.
The attempt to produce the "communal man" has been unsuc
cessful in the last 40 years, as is evidenced by efforts at individuality

in building private homes differ
ent from others and by the fer
ment which is beginning to evolve
among students. "Our objective
is to develop the inquiring mind;
Soviet education doesn't do this,"
Harriman commented.
Turning to the fear of inflation I
which he mentioned in his speech j
Wednesday, Harriman said that!
a superlative job has been done j
by the Republican Administration
n terrifying the people of infla
'ion; even more than of the
tomic bomb or a world war. He
said that in advocating a program
to curb inflation, President Eisen
hower has paid more attention to
his budget director than to his
economic and foreign aid advis
! ors.
Foreign Responsibility
Harriman stressed that he was
| firmly opposed to inflation, but
I he didn't think that efforts to
| combat it should interfere with
j greater needs. "We should not be
i afraid to do those things that are
j necessary for our foreign respon
i sibility."
He claimed that the tight
j money policy has not done what
it was intended to do, although
it has succeeded in reducing
growth without which it is im
possible to have a good security
and foreign aid program. "1 place
growth in the economy of para
! mount importance, with the re
duction of inflation in second
place."
Harriman said that a good
foreign aid program should be
approached in the same manner
as was the Marshall Plan, and that
the undeveloped countries can ab
sorb three billion dollars a year
ever the five billion which is now
given from all sources. He
guessed about half of this in
crease would be contributed by
the U.S.
Three Reasons
Three reasons the Marshall plan
succeeded, according to Harriman,
are:
• The,aid-receiving countries as
sisted in the plan and decided up
on division of the funds;
• It was financed over a period
of time, four years;
• It was adequately financed.
Any present plan for the un
derdeveloped countries should
have the same provisions.
The formation of such a plan
; could be done either by an inter
national organization such as the
| United Nations, or on a regional
basis as was the Marshall Plan,
but in any case it should include
Russia's aid. Once a country gets
a good start, it can carry on its
economy with its own resources
land through normal borrowing
< hannels, he said.
Harriman cited India as being
close to this point, and said that
with about a billion more dollars
supplied from the outside, India's
Five Year Plan starting next year
j will be successful in attaining a
| healthy econimy. The other Asian
countries are looking at India and
j the battle between China and
India in economic expansion, and
the results will have profound af
fect on Asia, he said.
Agricultural Surpluses
The United States' agriculturalj
surpluses should be used, as they
I are essential to some countries
so their people can work and their '
{industry and agriculture * can |
grow, and so not all their, re-1
sources are used for the produc
tion of food.
The gifts of surplus food should j
I not he considered a disposal,
j which Harriman likened to a swill |
I pail, but should rather be called
i a valuable usage of this food.
Harriman indicated that no
; congressman will vote for foreign 1
; aid since no foreigner can vote, 1
| but the only way to get foreign
aid through Congress is to have
I the President impress upon the j
people the importance of foreign j
aid. The people should decide
; what is the right thing to do and i

he said.
Although the Communist lead
ers make il appear so, the real
conflict in the world is not he-!
tween capitalism and comma-1
nism, Harriman stated; it is be
tween ideological concepts. The |
word "capitalism" in the Far East
is synonomous wtih "imperial-!
