MOSCOW (/P) —Premier Nikita
Khrushchev declared yesterday
the Soviet Union is so strong it
can cut the number of men in its
armed forces by almost a third
and rely upon the grestest fire
power—rockets and Interconti
nental Balistic Missiles—ever pos
sessed by any nation.
And more awesome power is to
come, the Soviet Premier told
1,300 deputies of the Supreme
Soviet, or Parliament.
Formidable Weapons
"The Central Committee of the
Communist party and the Soviet
government can inform you, com
rade deputies, that though the
weapons we have now are formid
able weapons, the weapon we
have in the hatching stage today
is even more perfect, even more
formidable." Khrushchev said.
"The weapon which is to be de
veloped is, as they -say in the
portfolio of our scientists and de
signers, a fantastic weapon."
Khrushchev did not elaborate
on the "fantastic" weapon in his
address, but he said that "now it
is quite clear that the United
States of America is not the
world's most powerful military
power."
Propose Armed Forces Cut
Khrushchev spoke for three
hours and five minutes, with a
half hour break, before a special
session of Supreme Soviet depu
ties from all parts of the vast
country which occupies a sixth
of the earth's land surface.
He proposed — and automatic
parliamentary approval is certain
—a cut of 1,200.000 men in the
armed forces, reducing the total
to 2,423,000, the lowest figure
since 1937. But at the same time
he told the deputies Soviet mili
tary fire power exceeds anything
known in history and that Soviet
defense never has been so strong.
