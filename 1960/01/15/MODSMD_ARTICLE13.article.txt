# EPIDEMIC THREATENS
## Flu Shots Availible Free At Student Health Service 
### 
The student health Service will give flu shots to all students
requesting them, according to Health Service Director George Houck.
Students who have previously had shots, or have had the flu
eariler, will need only one shot. Others should have two at weekly
intervals.
The shots are designed to immunize against the flu that is cur-

renily sweeping central Califor
nia. This virus has been found to
contain strains of the Asian type
two influenza virus that struck
two years ago, according to State
Health Director Malcom Merrill.
The virus is spreading north
ward through the San Joaquin
Valley. No serious epidemic has
been reported in the San Fran
cisco Bay Region, but State
Health Director Merrill urged all
California residents to consider
vaccination.
San Francisco Health Director
Ellis Sox reported an increasing
incidence of respiratory and "flu
like'' illnesses in San Francisco.
He said that with the disease
spreading throughout the state,
it is probable that it will reach
here sooner or later.
The virus strain that swept Los
Angeles has not yet been identi
fied. but it, too, is believed to be
of the Asian variety. An estimated
half-million persons in the city are
ill.
So far. 100 students have been
to the Health Service for shots.
Houck said that Hie Health Serv
ice has on hand enough vaccine
for 1000 students.
