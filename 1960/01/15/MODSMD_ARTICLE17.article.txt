Averell Harriman raised our particular kex <|tieBli»ii \\ ednes
day night in his keynote address at the Foreign I'olicx Institute:
how is the I nited Slates to go about taking the initiative in ai<l
to underdeveloped nations.
Ilarriniau repealed throughout his talk that this country must
lake the initiatixe, hut he left many of his listeners, including
us, unsatisfied when he failed to detail any method to bring this
about, save to say it would involve eliminating preoccupation
with budget balancing.
In a press conference early yesterday afternoon, hoxvever,
(Governor Harriman began to gel nearer the heart of how to help
these nations. He may have moxed to even greater detail in his
talk yesterday afternoon and in the evening question and answer
period, hut editorial deadlines restrict comment on these sessions
until Monday.
Harriman said all sources of aid are currently pouring fixe
billion dollars per year into underdeveloped nations. Studies
indicate another three billion per year could be profitably
absorbed into these countries.
Though he said \\ ednesday that increased western initiative
would bring these countries nearer our side in the cold war,
Harriman said yesterday he thought multi-lateral administration
of aid was best, and that the Soviet Union should be in on such
administration.
Long a strong adxocalc of the Marshall Plan, Harriman said
many ol its methods should be used again, To a question as to
whether direct payments, technological aid, inachinerv, or anx
other item constituted the best use of aid dollars, lie said that
only a country-by-country study could furnish the answ-T.
\o one formula can do for all nations, he added, and aid
should be administered on a regional basis.
Harriman says U.S. farm surpluses can also be used in aid
programs. Though he cautions that any such plan would have to
avoid economic chaos, and that il would best be done on a long
range rather than hand-to-mouth basis, Harriman thinks the
idea can work to benefit both this country and the empty stom
achs of the world.
We hope in his remaining sessions late yesterday that Harri
man further answered this question and others his talks have
raised. One thing was evident from his press conference, hoxv
ever: he isn't a man who is pinned into answering a question he
doesn't want to answer.
Regardless of how 1 fully he has answered Stanford's questions,
Governor Harriman has nevertheless stirred much thought here
on the problem of cold war foreign policy—thought with which
he himself has been greatly impressed.
We xvisli to restate the announcement made in the news col
umns earlier this xveek that The Daily xvill print a group of
selected critical articles on Harriman's appearances here. Articles
should be in the range of 300-400 words, and should be submitted
to The Daily shack by Sunday at 3 p.m.

Harriman says U.S. farm surpluses can also be used in aid
programs. Though he cautions that any such plan would have to
avoid economic chaos, and that il would best be done on a long
range rather than hand-to-mouth basis, Harriman thinks the
idea can work to benefit both this country and the empty stom
achs of the world.
We hope in his remaining sessions late yesterday that Harri
man further answered this question and others his talks have
raised. One thing was evident from his press conference, hoxv
ever: he isn't a man who is pinned into answering a question he
doesn't want to answer.
Regardless of how 1 fully he has answered Stanford's questions,
Governor Harriman has nevertheless stirred much thought here
on the problem of cold war foreign policy—thought with which
he himself has been greatly impressed.
We xvisli to restate the announcement made in the news col
umns earlier this xveek that The Daily xvill print a group of
selected critical articles on Harriman's appearances here. Articles
should be in the range of 300-400 words, and should be submitted

indicate another three billion per year could be profitably
absorbed into these countries.
Though he said \\ ednesday that increased western initiative
would bring these countries nearer our side in the cold war,
Harriman said yesterday he thought multi-lateral administration
of aid was best, and that the Soviet Union should be in on such
administration.
Long a strong adxocalc of the Marshall Plan, Harriman said
many ol its methods should be used again, To a question as to
whether direct payments, technological aid, inachinerv, or anx
