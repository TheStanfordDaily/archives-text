"Two UCLA deans, boldly chal
lenging the old assumption that
drinking exceeds thinking on
many campuses, believe that the
college guzzler is out of date."
Newsweek.
"Students still drink enough to
cause a great many problems."
Dartmouth's Dean Joseph Mc-
Donald.
So it appears.
At Duke University, three
fraternities were recently penal
ized strongly for drinking,
whereupon the Duke Chronicle
attacked the school's regula
tions as putting three segments
of the University in a com
promising position.
"The studentry, the vast ma
jority of which drinks and sees
no evil therein, will either blithly
ignore the rule and indulge, or
abstain to watch their friends. . . .
". . . Chaperons will ignore
their noses and avert their eyes
to bo able to sign their statements
that they saw no drinking. . . .
"The Administration involved
in punishing an insignificant per
centage of those guilty of drink
ing at functions will sentence the
violators fully realizing the pen
alties are inappropriate for the
offense and neither preventative
nor corrective.
"Inequitable enforcement of
th e obv ! ously unenforceable
places the Administrators and
student judges in a more hypo
critical position than the num
erous students and faculty
breaking the rule. . . .
"Liquidating one fraternity or
all of them will not prevent drink
ing at approved University func
tions."
Students at Cornell also believe
that existing regulations are un
fair and in many cases unneces
sary. v
The general argument offered
in opposition centers around three
fundamental points.
"In the first place, students
view themselves as responsible
members of a mature commun
ity. . . .
"Students living in men's dorm

itories maintain that the prohibi
tion on alcohol discriminates
against them; for students living
in either apartments or fraternity
houses are free to have liquor in
their living units and partake
thereof at any time.
"Finally, students demand the
right of gentlemen if they are lo
be held responsible for the obliga
tions of gentlemen. . .
In a recent directive al Oc
cidental (he regulations govern
ing the possession and consump
tion of alcoholic beverages were
re-stated.
"They are: 'possession and or
consumption of liquor, in any
form, on college property or in
a fraternity house is forbidden,
and a person returning to campus
under the influence is considered
to have violated college policy.'
The consequence of ihese actions
is 'suspension.'
"The present Oxy regulations
are obviously unenforceable.
Those who are unlucky enough to
be caught will be made examples,
some might obey, but the rest will
merely resort to hiding bottles
in cars. There must be a better
solution than this.
"But if we continue to equate
alcohol with evil we will never
find a workable, realistic an
swer. If we don't have a policy
that can be enforced then we'll
stay on the double standard.
A few will be punished for flic
many. . .
The Michigan Daily, in an edi
torial "... I Want a Shot," put
the case for drinking in Ann
Arbor this way.
"Support of the 'wet' proposal
should come from the student
body sick of being considered
adolescents incapable of downing
a highball without 'corrupting
their morals. . . .'
, "The days of Prohibition,
speakeasies and hip pocket
flasks faded with the Model A
Ford. It's time for a 'dry' Ann
Arbor fo wake np and realize
that being 'wet.' isn't so hail
after all."
