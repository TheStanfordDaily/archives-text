Bishop James A. Pike will be al :
Stanford Sunday evening to speak j
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on the
subject of Christian Unily. His
remarks at that time may well
shed an interesting light on his
statements in Life magazine (Pec. j
21, 19f)9) regarding the advisabil
ity of electing a Roman Catholic-
President of the United States. i
There are two central issues 1
to he dealt with concerning this
question as it presents itself in
the current debate: (1) the can
didate's mor a 1 responsibility '
and (2) the correctness of his
beliefs, in particular the official
doctrines of the church of which
lie is a member, on crucial polit
ical issues.
All meaningful societies, I
churches included, claim some de
gree of authority over thsir mem
bers. It is a working relationship
of authority and commitment thai j
Constitutes them as meaningful
or effective, in a categorical
sense.
Bishop Pike says the modern
Roman Catholic is restricted in !
making political decisions. Of
course he is. He is restricted by
external pressures, yes, but in the j
United States ho is restricted i
primarily by his conscience.
Thus he is restricted ,jus< as
we would hope any conscien
tious milti would he restricted.
Any man not so restricted
would surely l»e a conscience
less opportunist and, as such,
totally undesirable.
Bishop Pike points out that in
the face of official and binding
pronouncements by Ihe Holy See:
(1 ) Father Murray says the Amer
ican Catholic may believe in the
American brand of religious free
dom including, presumably, separ
ation of church and state, <2>
Senator Kennedy states that
"whatsoever one's religion in his
private life may be, for Ihe of-1
fical nothing takes precedence
over his oath of office, and (3)
there has been no talk of ex
communication.
Senator Kennedy's statement
may lead us to brand him as
morally irresponsible, or it may ;
be that all three cases are simply
instances of a kind of political
expediency made necessary when
ever a Roman Catholic minority
exists in any country and, hence,
are not morally reprehensible
from the standpoint of responsi
bility alone.
This leads one to examine
Ihe second central issue: the
correctness of the candidate's
beliefs «»ii crucial political is
sues. Bishop Pike, it seems, be
lieves thai Protestants niusl op
pose Catholics on the follow-

A column of
non-staff opinion
in# points: (I) official U.S.
representation at the Vatican,
(2) federal subsidies to paro
chial schools, (3) censorship,
(4) freedom in the distribution
of .contraceptive .information,
and (5) certain matters of
foreign p o I i c y involving the
Roman Catholic Church.
(1> Is this really an important
issue? If it is, the P.O.A.S.C.S. and
other like-minded persons will
have to decide whether the Vati
can is a church or a state. One
can perhaps advocate the deporta
tion of Cardinals who voted for
the Pope or advocate declining to
send an official representative to
the Vatican but not both.
(21 Most Protestants needs to
do a great deal of rethinking of
their stand in this area. Indeed
from the standpoint of religious
freedom some national rethinking
may be in order.
(3) Although American think
ing on this issue is muddy the
notion of no censorship at all is
'always intruding still, this may
bo a point of valid dissension.
(4) The whole question of birth
control may be a real issue.
(5) These seem relatively triv
ial.
As to .Senator Kenedy's state
ment (above) we may reflect,
on second thought, that it rep
resents more than just moral
expediency under the Catholic
moral understanding, indeed
that it represents an advocacy
of majority rule sis a principle
of legitimacy which, as Kishop
Pike suggests, is scarcely good
doctrine at all.
It is in the light of these con
siderations that we must make
our choice. The interesting ques
tion from (lie standpoint of Bishop
Pike's talk on Christian Unity, is
whether lie really believes Protes
tants and Catholics need be as far
apart, on questions of practical
politics as he seems to suggest.
This is a lecturer and a lecture
that should be well worth hearing.
