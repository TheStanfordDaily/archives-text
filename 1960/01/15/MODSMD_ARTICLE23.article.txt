The Answer?
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Wertheim, I read with the
traditional interest your touch
ing reaction to that anti-Semitic
display in the Education Building.
(One is surprised that these bril
liant disciples of John Dewey ever
heard of Naziism. >
But, as a courageous young
Liberal, you must not seriously
I advocate that the display be su
j pressed. Since no man has ex
clusive possession of the Truth.
! the whole Truth, and nothing but
j the Truth, so help us, John Stuart
I Mill, such an act would be on par
with (I hate to pronounce these
I vile words) the firing of Com
munist professors.
Us Liberals all got open minds.
We keep them open so that we
may, true to the Stanford tradi
tion, let the wind of freedom blow
into them and echo about the
j corners of our cerebrums.
Mr. Wertheim, may I ask you
a personal question: Have you
; seriously considered IVa/.iism as
| the answer?
