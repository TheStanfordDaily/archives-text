hilitor, The Daily:
As a motorist, I say thank
Heaven for the bicycle riders.
Traffic flow entering anfl leav
ing the University is none too
smooth as it is, and parking is
always a problem.
If as few as 25 per cent of the
bicyclists started driving cars, 1
believe the •situation would soon
become unbearable. Although
there are bicyclists whose man
ners could undoubtedly improve,
I find the same is true oi pedes
trians.
It is not good manners or good
sense to siep into the street with
out looking. The pedestrian law
may protect you legally, but it
does lit)I* 1 to slop a car going 20
m.p.h.
If we are to discuss laws on
campus, I'm sure lhat you will
find that there is a rule against
jaywalking and walking on the

grass. As far as bicyclists are con
cerned, 1 suggest that we do not
disturb the status quo.
