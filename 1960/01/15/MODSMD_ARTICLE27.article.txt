# "ADVISE AND CONSENT'
## Drury's Capital Novel Superb Story; But Could Be More Critical of Senate 
### Robert Horn 
Editor's Note: This review of
Advise and Consent lias heen
written for The Daily by Rob
ert Horn, Associate Professor
of Political Science.

Although Allen Drury's Advise
and Consent was published in
19.39 (Doubleday and a Book-of
thc-Month Club selection) it is
even more appropriate reading
for I960, which is both a Presi
dential election year and the year
of our decennial census.
Mr. Drury, a member of the
New York Times Washington
staff, a Stanford graduate, Class
of 1940, and former Daily staffer,
has written a novel of politics
which naturally reminds us that
it succeeds on the best-seller list
another political novel also writ
ten by a Stanford alumnus,
Eugene Burdick's (Class of 1941 >
The Ninth Wave.
Each book has a mythical Stan
ford alumnus as its protagonist
—hero, unless in the sense of the
Greek tragic hero, would be too
strong a word.
Superb Storytelling
All newspapermen supposedly
yearn to write the "great Ameri
can novel." but never quite suc
ceed in committing one to paper.
Allen Drury demonstrates in his
first novel a gift for superb story
telling.
His main story line is classi
cally simple: a briliant and attrac
tive young United States Senator
opposes Senate confirmation of a
nominee for Secretary of State of
the United States because he dis
trusts the man's past subversive
associations and present equivo
cations, only to be forced to self
destruction when information of
a brief homosexual aberation
buried in his own past falls into
the hands of his opponents, chief
of whom is the President who
nominated the Secretary.
If there is any flaw in the
novel, it is in a slightly melo
dramatic expansion of this story.
Brigham Anderson, although a

Senator from Utah, was nurtured
—through law school—on The
Farm. The President who triggers
his suicide is a former California
governor.
The other chief characters,
aside from a Supreme Court
Justice, are members of the Sen
ate, to which the book is dedi
cated.
Don't Guess
Some readers have been tempt
ed to play at guessing their iden
tities. The effort is misdirected.
Mr. Drury's book is a novel, not
current history, and his charac
ters are at most very composite
adaptations of some recently
prominent political figure-s.
Far more interesting to a Cnli
fornian and a watcher of politics
are the implications about Cali
fornia politics which Advise and
Consent suggests, as The Ninth
Wave made explicit. Both picture
our state's politics as utterly
ruthless and almost sadistically
violent, although in a sophisti
cated rather than raw way.
The bad old days before Hiram
Johnson may be something of a
myth themselves. The Southern
Pacific and (be it said) Leland
Stanford contributed to Califor
nia's greatness in a way Artie
Samish could not even imagine.
And Artie reigns no more, if he
ever did in the current era.
On the Way
If Drury and Burdick are light
about California politics, the rest
of the country had better worry
both about Ihe 1960 election and
the 1960 census, which will show
us far on the way to becoming
the most potent political entity
in the Union.
But the California politics they
suggest seems also fiction. For
decades and under both parties
California has, with the possible

exception of New York, had a
high quality of state government
unmatched in the country. And
the political scandals that have
•shocked or titillated most of the
other leading states have, on the
whole, heen remarkable for their
absence in California.
Perhaps instead Californians
should worry that as the rest of
the country copies our patios we
may go too far in copying their
politics.
In another way Mr. Drury in
vites comparison with William
White, of the New York Herald-
Tribune, whose recent book The
Citadel hymns a reverence for the
United States Senate more •sol
emn than Advice and Concent
intones.
Alternating Role
The Senate has had a strangely
alternating role as villain or hero
of American politics. Perhaps it
is no accident that in 1960, when
every avowed, and most as-yet
i unavowed candidates for the
| Presidency sit in or preside over
! the Senate, that body has again
reached a summit of approbation.
Senators (and a few Vice Presi
dents) have always been politi
cians' politicians. Insofar as these
books combat thoughtless public
disdain for all politics as dirty,
they are pedagogic-ally valuable.
But why, at a time which puts
the legislative process to its sever
est tests and reveals dangerous
I inadequacies should there be this
upsurge of almost mystical adula
tion for the Senate? This reviewer
finds the phenomenon as puzzling
as it is interesting.
And with all respect for that
institution he suspects that un-
I critical praise is no favor to the
j Senate just now. Mr. Drury's
j praise is critical but perhaps not
I sufficiently so.

Each book has a mythical Stan
ford alumnus as its protagonist
—hero, unless in the sense of the
Greek tragic hero, would be too
strong a word.
Superb Storytelling
All newspapermen supposedly
yearn to write the "great Ameri
can novel." but never quite suc
ceed in committing one to paper.
Allen Drury demonstrates in his
first novel a gift for superb story
telling.
His main story line is classi
cally simple: a briliant and attrac
tive young United States Senator
opposes Senate confirmation of a
nominee for Secretary of State of
the United States because he dis
trusts the man's past subversive
associations and present equivo
cations, only to be forced to self
destruction when information of
a brief homosexual aberation
buried in his own past falls into
the hands of his opponents, chief
of whom is the President who
nominated the Secretary.
If there is any flaw in the
novel, it is in a slightly melo
dramatic expansion of this story.
Brigham Anderson, although a

Senator from Utah, was nurtured
—through law school—on The
Farm. The President who triggers
his suicide is a former California
governor.
The other chief characters,
aside from a Supreme Court
Justice, are members of the Sen
ate, to which the book is dedi
cated.
Don't Guess
Some readers have been tempt
ed to play at guessing their iden
tities. The effort is misdirected.
Mr. Drury's book is a novel, not
current history, and his charac
ters are at most very composite
adaptations of some recently
prominent political figure-s.
Far more interesting to a Cnli
fornian and a watcher of politics
are the implications about Cali
fornia politics which Advise and
Consent suggests, as The Ninth
Wave made explicit. Both picture
our state's politics as utterly
ruthless and almost sadistically
violent, although in a sophisti
cated rather than raw way.
The bad old days before Hiram
Johnson may be something of a
myth themselves. The Southern
Pacific and (be it said) Leland
Stanford contributed to Califor
nia's greatness in a way Artie
Samish could not even imagine.
And Artie reigns no more, if he
ever did in the current era.
On the Way
If Drury and Burdick are light
about California politics, the rest
of the country had better worry
both about Ihe 1960 election and
the 1960 census, which will show
us far on the way to becoming
the most potent political entity
in the Union.
But the California politics they
suggest seems also fiction. For
decades and under both parties
California has, with the possible

exception of New York, had a
high quality of state government
unmatched in the country. And
the political scandals that have
•shocked or titillated most of the
other leading states have, on the
whole, heen remarkable for their
absence in California.
Perhaps instead Californians
should worry that as the rest of
the country copies our patios we
may go too far in copying their
politics.
In another way Mr. Drury in
vites comparison with William
White, of the New York Herald-
Tribune, whose recent book The
Citadel hymns a reverence for the
United States Senate more •sol
emn than Advice and Concent
intones.
Alternating Role
The Senate has had a strangely
alternating role as villain or hero
of American politics. Perhaps it
is no accident that in 1960, when
every avowed, and most as-yet
i unavowed candidates for the
| Presidency sit in or preside over
! the Senate, that body has again
reached a summit of approbation.
Senators (and a few Vice Presi
dents) have always been politi
cians' politicians. Insofar as these
books combat thoughtless public
disdain for all politics as dirty,
they are pedagogic-ally valuable.
But why, at a time which puts
the legislative process to its sever
est tests and reveals dangerous
I inadequacies should there be this
upsurge of almost mystical adula
tion for the Senate? This reviewer
finds the phenomenon as puzzling
as it is interesting.
And with all respect for that
institution he suspects that un-
I critical praise is no favor to the
j Senate just now. Mr. Drury's
j praise is critical but perhaps not
I sufficiently so.

dramatic expansion of this story.
Brigham Anderson, although a

Senator from Utah, was nurtured
—through law school—on The
Farm. The President who triggers
his suicide is a former California
governor.
The other chief characters,
aside from a Supreme Court
Justice, are members of the Sen
ate, to which the book is dedi
cated.
Don't Guess
Some readers have been tempt
ed to play at guessing their iden
tities. The effort is misdirected.
Mr. Drury's book is a novel, not
current history, and his charac
ters are at most very composite
adaptations of some recently
prominent political figure-s.
Far more interesting to a Cnli
fornian and a watcher of politics
are the implications about Cali
fornia politics which Advise and
Consent suggests, as The Ninth
Wave made explicit. Both picture
our state's politics as utterly
ruthless and almost sadistically
violent, although in a sophisti
cated rather than raw way.
The bad old days before Hiram
Johnson may be something of a
myth themselves. The Southern
Pacific and (be it said) Leland
Stanford contributed to Califor
nia's greatness in a way Artie
Samish could not even imagine.
And Artie reigns no more, if he
ever did in the current era.
On the Way
If Drury and Burdick are light
about California politics, the rest
of the country had better worry
both about Ihe 1960 election and
the 1960 census, which will show
us far on the way to becoming
the most potent political entity
in the Union.
But the California politics they
suggest seems also fiction. For
decades and under both parties
California has, with the possible

exception of New York, had a
high quality of state government
unmatched in the country. And
the political scandals that have
•shocked or titillated most of the
other leading states have, on the
whole, heen remarkable for their
absence in California.
Perhaps instead Californians
should worry that as the rest of
the country copies our patios we
may go too far in copying their
politics.
In another way Mr. Drury in
vites comparison with William
White, of the New York Herald-
Tribune, whose recent book The
Citadel hymns a reverence for the
United States Senate more •sol
emn than Advice and Concent
intones.
Alternating Role
The Senate has had a strangely
alternating role as villain or hero
of American politics. Perhaps it
is no accident that in 1960, when
every avowed, and most as-yet
i unavowed candidates for the
| Presidency sit in or preside over
! the Senate, that body has again
reached a summit of approbation.
Senators (and a few Vice Presi
dents) have always been politi
cians' politicians. Insofar as these
books combat thoughtless public
disdain for all politics as dirty,
they are pedagogic-ally valuable.
But why, at a time which puts
the legislative process to its sever
est tests and reveals dangerous
I inadequacies should there be this
upsurge of almost mystical adula
tion for the Senate? This reviewer
finds the phenomenon as puzzling
as it is interesting.
And with all respect for that
institution he suspects that un-
I critical praise is no favor to the
j Senate just now. Mr. Drury's
j praise is critical but perhaps not
I sufficiently so.
Editor's Note: This review of
Advise and Consent lias heen
written for The Daily by Rob
ert Horn, Associate Professor
of Political Science.

Although Allen Drury's Advise
and Consent was published in
19.39 (Doubleday and a Book-of
thc-Month Club selection) it is
even more appropriate reading
for I960, which is both a Presi
dential election year and the year
of our decennial census.
Mr. Drury, a member of the
New York Times Washington
staff, a Stanford graduate, Class
of 1940, and former Daily staffer,
has written a novel of politics
which naturally reminds us that
it succeeds on the best-seller list
another political novel also writ
ten by a Stanford alumnus,
Eugene Burdick's (Class of 1941 >
The Ninth Wave.
Each book has a mythical Stan
ford alumnus as its protagonist
—hero, unless in the sense of the
Greek tragic hero, would be too
strong a word.
Superb Storytelling
All newspapermen supposedly
yearn to write the "great Ameri
can novel." but never quite suc
ceed in committing one to paper.
Allen Drury demonstrates in his
first novel a gift for superb story
telling.
His main story line is classi
cally simple: a briliant and attrac
tive young United States Senator
opposes Senate confirmation of a
nominee for Secretary of State of
the United States because he dis
trusts the man's past subversive
associations and present equivo
cations, only to be forced to self
destruction when information of
a brief homosexual aberation
buried in his own past falls into
the hands of his opponents, chief
of whom is the President who
nominated the Secretary.
