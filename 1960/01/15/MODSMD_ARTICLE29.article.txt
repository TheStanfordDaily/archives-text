The Weak Link
Editor, The Daily:
Mrs. Rathbun's statement, "A J
civilization is only as strong as
its women," obviously refers to
the saying, "A chain is only as
strong as its weakest link."

Get a Bike
Editor, The Daily:
This is in answer to Messers
Bing, Mann, Meese, and Osborn, j
who are declaring war on hi-1
cycles: In the bad old days of ;
knights in shining armor, it was j
not considered a fair battle if one i
man was on a horse and the other '
on foot. Why don't you got hi- j
cycles yourselves?

Why War?
Editor, The Daily:
Those fortunate young men'
who can attend Stanford in style !
have expressed their disdain for
the means of transportation em
ployed by a few less fortunate
than they.
Unless those who possess auto-j
mobiles are willing to be at all
times at the disposal of the lowly
hundreds who must resort to the
two-wheeled vehicle, we suggest i
that they refrain from condoning
unreservedly the complete aboli
tion of the bicycle from the Stan
ford campus.
If the cyclists fail to stop at
stop signs, they are wrong. If j

they insist on riding about at
night without lights, they are
wrong.
If they leave their wheels in $10
parking places, they are blame
worthy. If they transgress the
arches of Inner Quad and of the
pedestrians within, they are
wrong.
But it seems strange that the
pedestrian commands more re
spect at a stop sign lhan does a
cyclist â€” that the bike-rider, to
cross an intersection without
jeapordizing his life, although he
is on the right-of-way street, must
either stop and wait for the cars ;
sliding through their stop sign
or get down from bicycle and
walk.
If the "car-drivers" have reason
to request the banishment of the
bicycle, the "bike-riders" have j
reason to request the banishment
of the automobiles.
Both of which requests are ab
solutcly ridiculous and imprac

ticable, and, in short, will get us
all absolutely nowhere.
Why war? Why not a little
more concern on both sides for
the other side a good definition
of common courtesy.
