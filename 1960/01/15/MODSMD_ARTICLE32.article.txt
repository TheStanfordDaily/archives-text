# Stanford Frosh to Battle Santa Clara, Menlo Fives
## 
### 
The Stanford frosh, off to a
good start in the early stages of
the hoop season, carry a 3-1 rec
ord into weekend engagements
with two other peninsula area ball
clubs, Menlo J.C. and the Santa
Clara frosh.
Tonight the Papooses host
Santa Clara as a preliminary to
the varsity encounter with Wash
ington. The Broncos are rated
as the top frosh team in the area,
an opinion that is backed up by
an 11*0 record.
Coach Bill Turner and his boys
will certainly have th<>ir work cut
out for them when they go up
against the likes of Santa Clara's
Joe Wiesse, a high scoring for
ward, Leroy Jackson, an agile
6-5 post man, and Gene Shield, a
6-8 forward. The Papooses will
obviously have the height stacked
against them. Coach Turner
hopes to use agressiveness and
hustle to overcome this disadvan
tage.
It was this brand of ball that
gained the Stanford frosh a vic-

I tory over the taller, highly rated
California frosh team last week
' end. Stanford managed to grab
i the majority of rebounds in this
| game.
Coach Turner will have all five
of his regular starters back into
I action this weekend. Roger Mead,
J 6-5 center who missed action
I against California, will be back
I in the lineup. •
Bob Summers, 6-4, who leads
! the frosh in scoring so far this
[ season, will be at one forward
position, while Darrell Suther
land. 6-3, will play the other. The
(Momentson twins Don and Doug,

both of whom stand 6*l, will start
at the guard positions.
Chuck Wilson, who saw a lot
of action and garnered a large
share of the rebounds against
California, will bo sure to see
plenty of action in the game.
Saturday night the Papooses
will round off their weekend
•schedule with neighboring Menlo
Park J.C. The players to watch
on this ball club are Bruce Loft
ner, a 6*5 center, Vein Under
wood, a 6-2 forward, and Tom Pol
hemus, a speedy guard.
The Papooses own victories
over the University of San Fran
cisco frosh, the San Jose frosh,
and the California frosh, while
their single lose was to St. Mary's
frosh, Ihe other undefeated frosh
team in the area along with Santa
Clara.
The Stanford frosh can add to
their record and prestige with
twin victories this weekend. They
must be considered as one of the
stronger teams in the area due
to their past performances.
