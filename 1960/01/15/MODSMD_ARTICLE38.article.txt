Washington Huskies in for a j
game tonight and the Washington
State University Cougars here to
morrow.
Tonight's contest with the
Huskies will be a battle for the
bottom spot in the AAWU. !

Stanford Radio, KZSU, 880 on
the dial, will broadcast tonight's
Stanford - Washington basket
ball game at 8 p.m. It will also
air tomorrow night's clash be
tween tlie Indians and Wash
ington State at 8.

the tough Cal Bears, and the
Seattle crew lost two to USC and
two to UCLA, all by a total of five
points.
Both Bfal Beavers
Both teams hold victories over
Oregon State. Washington took
the measure of the Beavers, 57-51,
while the Indians downed the Cor
vallis lads. 13-38.
The big gun for the Huskies is
(vcS, 220 pound Bill Hanson, who
is averaging better than 15 points
per game thus far in the 1959-60
season. Hanson is only a soph, but
has done much to fill Ihe shoes of
All-Coasters, Bruno Boin and
Doug Smart, lost to graduation.
Ho will be the main problem for
the Indian defense currently fifth
in the nation, for in Ihe Washing
ton offense the center handles
the ball on most plays.
Sharp Shooting Guards
Two sharp shooting guards
could give ihe Indians trouble.
George Grant and Clint Names
arc considered two of the best ball
handlers in the North, and both
are spoe ly and shoot well from
1 he outside.
The other two men on the front
line for the Huskies are two
sophs, Lyle Bakken and Roger
Niva, both of whom are good
scorers and fine rebounders.
Bakken has drawn the tough
assignment of guarding the
Card'-; leading scorer, John Ar
rillaga.
The Huskies have a real job on

; their hands Saturday night after
| their Friday game at Stanford as
they travel to Berkeley to take
on the NCAA Champion Califor
nia Bears.
Soph Loaded
Saturday night will see a soph
loaded WSU team invade the Pa
vilion. The Washington State Cou
! gars will start three sophs,
I Charlie Sells, Dwight Damon, and
| Terry Ball.
Sells is the kingpin of the Cou-

gar five. He is averaging almost
13 points per game to lead the
team in thai department. Tie also
leads the Cougars in rebounding
and free throw shooting.
Another soph was slated for
duty in I ho Cougar haekcourt. Jim
Hepton. But the speedy Spokane
guard slipped on some ice earlier
this week, and won't make the
trip to the Bay Area with 1 ho
team.
Demoted
The fact that Duano Rannigor
has been demoted to second string

demonstrates the potency of the
sophs in the Washington State
lineup. Ranniger was one of the
leading scorers on last year's
team which finished tiie season
with a 10-16 mark.
The big problem that the In
dians face is improving their
shooting percentage. They are
hitting at a 34.9 average in 11
games, which has netted them
only four wins.
Arrillaga's eye, which was
scratched by his contact lens over
a week ago, is now all right and
the sharp shooting guard will be
at full strength for the weekend
action.
