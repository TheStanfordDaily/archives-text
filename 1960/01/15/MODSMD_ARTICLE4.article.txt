## 
### Doug Willis Associate Editor 
A lively debate on loyalty oaths
and abridgements of freedoms
highlighted lasl night's Legisla
ture meeting. Touched off by a
report on the National Defense
Education Act, tlie debate ended
when a 12-4 Legislature vote
tabled the issue until next week's
meet ing.
In other Legislature business, a
discussion of restricting bicycles
on the Quad was sent to the Tradi
tions and Services Committee for
study, and a proposal to study the
establishment of an on-campus
hostel site was sent to the Aca
demic Affairs Committee.
Called for Resolution
The debate on ihe National De
fense Education Act was opened
by a report by Chairman Scotty
Thompson of Legislature's Public
and International Affairs Com
mittee. Thompson called for Leg
islature to pass a resolution sup
porting University policy urging
the repeal of the disclaimer affi
davit in the Act.
The Act has eligibility stipula
tions for both a loyalty oath,
which is a postive statement of
allegiance only, and a disclaimer
affidavit by which the student as
serts that he floes not believe in
or teach the overthrow of the
United States government by il
legal or unconstitutional means.
Singles Out People
Thompson asserted that the Act
singles out teachers and students
as suspicious characters because
other persons receiving govern
ment aid are not required to sign
such affidavits.
Ed Cutter pointed out that any
person or organization has the
right to put any stipulation it
wishes on money it loans, and
Bob Best suggested that signing
the affidavit distained the right to
believe.
Sahsa Lanz argued against a
resolution opposed to the A'-t be
cause he believed that any loyal
citizen should be willing to sign
the affidavit.
Thompson explained that Stan
ford received $68,000 under the
Act last year and will probably
receive better than $150,000 this
year. Rich Sundeen added that if
a Stanford student refuses to
sign the oath and afidavit the
University attempts to make the
loan itself, but that funds for this
are limited.
Union Report
Legislature also heard a report
by Tony Paap of the Ad Hoc
Committee on the proposed new
Union. Paap presented a program
for preliminary planning for the j
union and he told Legislature
that over 100 Ad Hoc Committee
members had interviewed over!
2,000 persons before compiling the
preliminary building program. :
Paap estimated that plans fori
the union may be completed dur-1
ing spring quarter and that build
ing might begin as soon as the
beginning of next fall quarter.
