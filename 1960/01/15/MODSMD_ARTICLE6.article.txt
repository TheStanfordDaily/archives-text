# Alpha Delta Phi Rush Restricted
## 
### 
Stanford's Alpha Delta Phi fra
ternity was yesterday limited to
ID in the number of pledges it can
lake in for the nexl year.
The limitation was set by the
Interfraternity Council's Judicial
Committee after it found the
house guilty of "illegal rushing"
in the form of a "specific invi
tation to a freshman to attend a
Greek Week open house."
The limitation of two pledges
for the "isolated case" was sol
upon I he average of 21 pledges
per year established over the last
five years. Judicial Committee
Chairman Pete Bedford an
nounced the decision at I he IFC
meeting last night.
Charges against two other
houses were dropped when no
evidence was presented to sup
port them.
