### 
The pros and cons of such
union facilities as a 1 ravel agency,
I a ballroom, a browsing room and
various kinds of food services
were discussed yesterday at the
ad hoc student committee meet
ing for the new Tressider Union.
The meeting, led by Chairman
Tony Paao. with Union Director
Chester Berry answering ques
i tions, was a discus don of the 40-
page report published earlier this
1 year.
The committee favored having
; a travel agency and a browsing
! room where people can read cur
rently popular books and maga
zines, but thought that the ball
room could be eliminated if it
could not be fitted into the
] budget.
