## 
### 
ALBANY. Ga. (/1 J ) President Eisenhower will make a 10-day
visit to Hit 1 Soviet Union beginning June 10 to apply more thawing
heat to the? cold war ice.
The tour is a follow-up to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev's
historic visit to the United States last September. The dates June

10-19 were announced simultane
ously Sunday in Moscow and at
Eisenhower's weekend holiday re
treat here.
Moscow First Stop
The President, who has ex
pressed the hope his visit will
help melt East-West tensions, will
go to Moscow first.
Announcement of the time of
Eisenhower's tour came at a
point when Khrushchev is push
ing a new pressure campaign in
tended to force llie President and
other Western leaders to abandon
their protection of West Berlin.
I'aris Summit Talks
The next big effort at dealing
with thai situation is almost cer
tain to come at the Paris East-
West summit conference starting
May 1 (i. The talks there will bring
together Khrushchev and these
Western allies: Eisenhower,
French President Charles de
Gaulle and Britain's Prime Min
ister Harold Macmillan.
So Eisenhower will be arriving
in the Soviet Union probably
something less than three weeks
after the Paris attempt to resolve
knotty differences. The Western
leaders do not look for Khru
shchev to do any about-face at
the summit meeting but there is a
feeling he may avoid any out
wardly tough attitude in order to
build a cordial atmosphere for
the Eisenhower visit.
No Cold War Debate
The forthcoming Eisenhower
lour isn't likely to be marked by
the public debate over cold war
issues which punctuated the
Khrushchev visit to the United
States and Vice President Richard
M. Nixon's stay in the Soviet
Union last year. Eisenhower is
understood to have expressed the
view that such give and take in
public would not be in keeping
with the dignity of his office.
