LONDON (A J ) â€” A massive
five-deep column of silent people
marched t h r ough the half
deserted streets of London Sun
day protesting anti-Semitic out
bursts in West Germany.
They marched from Hyde Park
to Belgrave Square and their lead
ers handed in a letter to the West
Germany Embassy.
The demonstration, which
stretched miles, was organ
ized by a Jewish veterans associa
tion and was one of the biggest
ever seen in the capital, it in
cluded many non-Jews.
The letter described the demon
stration as a reflection of British
public opinion "which holds anti-
Semitism in abhorrence."
