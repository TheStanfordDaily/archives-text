Stanford's third annual Foreign Policy Institute lias now con
cluded and is to be judged, we believe, far more successful than
last year's venture.
Paradoxically. (Gardner Patterson, the keynote speaker last
year, is thought by many to have made more informative and
provocative statements than did Averell Harriman. Huf Patterson
drew audiences ranging from mediocre to poor, while Harriman
attracted interest on a large scale, and had no trouble filling
Memorial Auditorium.
Many have expressed disappointment with Harriman—they
say lie didn't tell them anything not already known, lie was
interesting, run the comments, hut not informative enough.
Kven granting this opinion, we believe Harriman did a job
which succeeded in fulfilling the major aim of the Foreign
Policy Institute: to broaden interest in problems of foreign policy
and foreign relations.
Certainly it is impossible for a two-day series of speeches and
discussions to (urnish a complete education in foreign policy.
Hut il (.AN introduce one to the subject and provide an impetus

I<oreign Policy Institute laces a peculiar problem in securing
a keynoter. Someone like Patterson, who may have the better
ideas, does not draw interest. A big name, like Harriman, draws
interest but may be disappointing in his presentation.
In another sense, the problem is to gel someone who will
present ideas and draw interest without being 100 academic and
thus losing interest, as shown by last year's experience.
From the standpoint of focusing interest on foreign policy,
however, we congratulate this year's Instil. it< ' on a job well done.
