## The 						Death of Camus 
### Judy Sklar 
A frowning man with a ciga
rette dangling from his lips won't
he arouncl Paris cafes anymore.
And there will be no new
words from perhaps the greatest
moralist of our time because Al
bert Camus, Nobel prize winner
at 43, was killed in an automobile
crash about 80 miles southeast of
Paris Jan. 4.
Francois Mauriac called his
death one of the greatest losses
that could strike the world of
French literature and France it
self.
Someone else said, "His death
at the age of 46 ... is a horrible
and shattering tragedy, both be
cause it is untimely and because
it has crippled the intellect of Eu
rope. He was one of the few in
dispensable men in the world, and
there is no one to take his place."
Everywhere people have felt
the shock of the absurd, of the
irony of the death of the man
who fought death.
When he accepted the Nobel
Prize for Literature, Camus
said, "Probably every genera
tion sees itself as charged with
remaking the world. Mine, how
ever, knows that it will not re
make the world. But its task
is perhaps even greater, for it
consists in keeping the world
from destroying itself."
To Camus revolt establishes
value. It is under pressure that
human values arise, that there is
a spark of consciousness and dig
nity. To deny life by suicide or by
murder, is a contradiction. Suicide
is a positive act, for in despising
life, man has an ideal of what it
should be. Murder cannot be con
doned; man has established a
value, and he cannot keep it en
tirely to himself.
The body insists on living,
and man must attempt to live
with pride.
Camus' revolt means con
sciousness. He says, "Man is
the only creature who refuses
to be what he is." He protests
against the absurd, he protests
against murder.
Camus was the first figure of
literary importance to come out
of French North Africa. His first
major work. The Myth of Sis
yphus (1942), compares life to
1 he mythological character Sis
yphus who continually pushes a

stone up a hill. Tension is the
ultimate value.
In his first novel, The Stranger
(1942>, Camus saw life as a suc
cession of events without mean
ing. As he is about to be executed
for murder, the main character
remarks, "How could I fail to see
that nothing was more important
than an execution . . . and that
it was even, in a way, the only
really interesting thing for a
man."
By 1947, when "The Plague"
was published, C a m ii s h a d
changed his attitude. Here he
protests against mass murder.
The doctor who fights the
plague says,"It is an absurd
situation, but we do what we
can."
In The Rebel, 1951, Camus saw
man as an independent revolu
tionary subject to no revolution
ary discipline but his ownâ€”a man
who paraphrased Descartes by
saying "I rebel, therefore we are."
And it was. here that Camus
parted with Sartre.
Albert Camus was born in 1913
in Algeria into a working class
family. His father was killed in
the Battle of the Maine in 1914.
His mother, who was Spanish,
was hard of hearing and inarticu
late, and she and Camus had a
strange, unspoken relationship.
Camus worked his way
through the University of Al
giers, then fought a battle with
tuberculosis.
When France fell to the Nazis
in World War 11, Camus joined
the Resistance in North Africa
and eventually made his way to
Paris. There he secretly edited
the Resistance newspaper Com
bat.
In 1956 he wrote The Fall and
in 1957 Exile and the Kingdom.
"Caligula," a play, is sched
uled to be produced in New
York in the middle of February.
"Camus has forced man to
the mirror. Good! Tor so long as
he writes, there will be no rest,"
one critic wrote in 1957. Rest is
precisely what is dangerous, for
without a fight, slavery and
death will be unstoppable. And
without Camus to urge the fight,
man must pay attention. It is
much too easy to give in in the
face of problems the size of those
today.
