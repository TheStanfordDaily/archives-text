## Averell Not Frightened Any Longer 
### Bill Odell 
Editor's Note: This is the
first of several non-staff com
mentary articles to he published
concerning Averell llarrinian's
visit here last week. Articles
written by other interested
persons will continue to be ac
cepted at The Daily through
tomorrow afternoon.

In his two public addresses last
week, Averell Harriman express
ed a widely changed attitude
toward Russia as compared to his
frightening and rather frightened
statements made after returning
from extensive talks with Soviet
Premier Khrushchev in Moscow
last June.
Harriman said then that his
talk* with the Russian boss had
been "terr ifying, shocking, worse
than Stalin." Certainly, he should
be able to compare anyone with
Stalin, as he served as Ambassa
dor to Russia from 1943 until 1946
and attended all but one of the
top level meetings between Roose
velt, Stalin, and Churchill.
l?ut last week Harriman in
deed did not appear to be terri
fied or shocked, nor did he seem
to regard Khrushchev as a
worse villian than Stalin.
Instead, he expressed great con
fidence in America and the demo
cratic system. "I recry people who
say we can't do things. We can
respond," he said.
Harriman also said he was par
ticularly impresed with the pres
ent young student generation. "I
have more confidence in this
generation of students than ever
before," he stated.
He further indicated that the
young generation is a sign of
"where the country is going."
Indeed, it is reassuring and re
freshing to know that it might
not be going to the dogs after
all.
One interesting point that
Harriman brought out was the
differences between the Ivvo polit
ical parties in the United States.
During his talks with Khrushchev
last June, Harriman was chal
lenged to name one difference
between the parties.
Harriman replied that the Dem
ocratic Party would -spend more
money on defense and would not
worry about a balanced budget.
If this is the only difference
that Democrat Harriman could
find to recite, it certainly ap
pears that the differences be
tween the two parties are fast
becoming only a matter of
degree.
But perhaps the most enlighten
ing and wisest statement that
Harriman made was the opening
remark of his Wednesday evening
address. He said then that it is
impossible to predict the happen
ings of the Soviet Union.

remark of his Wednesday evening
address. He said then that it is
impossible to predict the happen
ings of the Soviet Union.
Editor's Note: This is the
first of several non-staff com
mentary articles to he published
concerning Averell llarrinian's
visit here last week. Articles
written by other interested
persons will continue to be ac

tomorrow afternoon.

In his two public addresses last
week, Averell Harriman express
ed a widely changed attitude
toward Russia as compared to his
frightening and rather frightened
statements made after returning
from extensive talks with Soviet
Premier Khrushchev in Moscow
last June.
Harriman said then that his
talk* with the Russian boss had
been "terr ifying, shocking, worse
than Stalin." Certainly, he should
be able to compare anyone with
Stalin, as he served as Ambassa
dor to Russia from 1943 until 1946
and attended all but one of the
top level meetings between Roose
velt, Stalin, and Churchill.
l?ut last week Harriman in
deed did not appear to be terri
fied or shocked, nor did he seem
to regard Khrushchev as a
worse villian than Stalin.
Instead, he expressed great con
fidence in America and the demo
cratic system. "I recry people who
say we can't do things. We can
respond," he said.
Harriman also said he was par
ticularly impresed with the pres
ent young student generation. "I
have more confidence in this
generation of students than ever
before," he stated.
He further indicated that the
young generation is a sign of
"where the country is going."
Indeed, it is reassuring and re
freshing to know that it might
not be going to the dogs after
all.
One interesting point that
Harriman brought out was the
differences between the Ivvo polit
ical parties in the United States.
During his talks with Khrushchev
last June, Harriman was chal
lenged to name one difference
between the parties.
Harriman replied that the Dem
ocratic Party would -spend more
money on defense and would not
worry about a balanced budget.
If this is the only difference
that Democrat Harriman could
find to recite, it certainly ap
pears that the differences be
tween the two parties are fast
becoming only a matter of
degree.
But perhaps the most enlighten
ing and wisest statement that
Harriman made was the opening
remark of his Wednesday evening
address. He said then that it is
impossible to predict the happen
ings of the Soviet Union.
