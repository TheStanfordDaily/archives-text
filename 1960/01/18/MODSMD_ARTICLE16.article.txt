Affected as Meant
Editor, The Daily:
Being less perspicacious than
Mi'. Wertheim, I was affected by
the display in Cubberley as the
designer m°ant one to be affected.
At first sight, the swastikas re
pulsed me, and I identified myself
with the American flag.
The point was driven home:
symbols do have meaning; they
embody ideals which do or do not
appeal 1o us. We must exploit
this fact by constantly stating our
ideals in the presence of our flag
and great documents.
We want our children to revere
their flag and what it stands for,
not to be drawn to a despicable
but significant smybol splattered
on a house of worship.
It is commendable that a com
fortable American can feel such
compassion for the slaughtered
millions of Europe. But he ought
to cultivate respect and under
standing for living men. as well.
We should know by now lhat
we cannot fight the ideologies we
hate by bandying about libelous
statements.
