## A 						Poll on Drinking 
### Doug Willis 
We were surprised last week
I when we started gathering in
! formation for this column be
| cause we didn't get the answers
i we expected when we started ask
| ing questions.
The question of the week was
| "What would you do if the Uni
versity firmly enforced rules
| against on-campus and under-age
I drinking?" Actually the replies
didn't just surprise us- -"aston
ish" is a better word.
Only two students questioned
said that it would make any dif
ference to them. One said that
he would just have to keep bis
door locked when he drank, and
the other £aid that the Univer
sity just couldn't stop it in his
house unless they kicked every
man there out of school.
The most popular answer to
our question was that it wouldn't
[make any difference whatsoever.
'One student, a senior from the
Row whf) admitted being a rela
tively frequent drinker, said that
| he would prefer 1 -strictly banning
drinking on campus.
"Even moderate drinking on
1 campus is bad," he said, "because
|it creates a bad atmosphere. It
would be easier to study in the
house if there was never liquor
around."
A Roble girl suggested that
there might be a disadvantage
to forcing people to drink off
campus and then drive back
after drinking. "But Opsahl's
death shows that it's probably
just as bad if it's done on cam
pus."
Two Wilbur freshmen took a
popular stand: "I don't care too
j much what the policy is, just so
long as it's clear."
If percentages mean anything
working with small samples, then
jwe came up with a surprising
one: better than 60 per cent said
that they wouldn't be affected by
J any policy change.
"I'd like an excuse not. to

I drink," explained a Stern sopho
! more.
A student suggested
what might happen it' a strict
no drinking on campus policy
were put into effect tomorrow:
"For the first month or two
students wouldn't believe that
the University was going to en
force it. Hut after a few got
caught ami suspended or some
how punished, they would prob
ably accept the policy because
not enough care to get popular
< resistance.
j "For the few who are made
examples of at the first it is too
i had, and not completely fair, but
| it is probably best in the long
j run."
The most important parts of
I any poll are the conclusions you
I can draw from it. And even if our
; poll is only 10 per cent reliable,
we come up with some important
conclusions.
First: The popular picture of
student attitudes on drinking
isn't true. Quite a few students
would prefer a strict drinking
policy, and mass resistence to
strict enforcement isn't as cer
tain as we thought.
A second conclusion would bo
good for a new question of the
week: "Has our thinking on drink
ing on campus been led for many
years by a vocal and convincing
minority?"

The most popular answer to
our question was that it wouldn't
[make any difference whatsoever.
'One student, a senior from the
Row whf) admitted being a rela
tively frequent drinker, said that
| he would prefer 1 -strictly banning
drinking on campus.
"Even moderate drinking on
1 campus is bad," he said, "because
|it creates a bad atmosphere. It
would be easier to study in the
house if there was never liquor
around."
A Roble girl suggested that
there might be a disadvantage
to forcing people to drink off
campus and then drive back
after drinking. "But Opsahl's
death shows that it's probably
just as bad if it's done on cam
pus."
Two Wilbur freshmen took a
popular stand: "I don't care too
j much what the policy is, just so
long as it's clear."
If percentages mean anything
working with small samples, then
jwe came up with a surprising
one: better than 60 per cent said
that they wouldn't be affected by
J any policy change.
"I'd like an excuse not. to

I drink," explained a Stern sopho

A student suggested
what might happen it' a strict
no drinking on campus policy
were put into effect tomorrow:
"For the first month or two
students wouldn't believe that
the University was going to en
force it. Hut after a few got
caught ami suspended or some
how punished, they would prob

The most important parts of
I any poll are the conclusions you
I can draw from it. And even if our

conclusions.
First: The popular picture of
student attitudes on drinking
isn't true. Quite a few students
would prefer a strict drinking
policy, and mass resistence to
strict enforcement isn't as cer
tain as we thought.
A second conclusion would bo
good for a new question of the
week: "Has our thinking on drink
ing on campus been led for many
years by a vocal and convincing
minority?"

I when we started gathering in

I drinking?" Actually the replies
didn't just surprise us- -"aston
