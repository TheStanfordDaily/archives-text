A.BR.SU.
lid it or, The Daily:
We, the founders of the As
sociated Bicycle Riders of Stan
ford University, do gladly
aeknowlelge the declaration of
war presented by Messrs. Bing,
Mann, Meese, and Osborn. To
t these gentlemen, who represent
the masses of humanity who pre-
I vent safe bicycle riding, we must
' with all due respect for the honor
of warring peoples, give the warn
ing that in this conflict we will
accept nothing but unconditional
â€¢surrender.
Bicycle riders at Stanford have
1 been very tolerant of llvese people
who make traveling by bicycle on
campus a dangerous occupation.
As the Stanford police have sided
with these ignorant barbarians
(i.e. pedestrians), we will assume
all the privileges of motor ve
j hides.
Tf we are to be ticketed for
speeding, boulevard stops, and
lack of lights, we will expect
from pedestrians the respect ac
corded to automobiles.
If they continue to jaywalk and
ignore marked crossings at in

| tersections we will not lake the
responsibility for the unavoidable
accidents they cause.
Fellow bicycle riders unite! Be
! not afraid of this numerous foe
who hides behind new while
Fords with blinking red lights.
United we ride; divided we fall.
