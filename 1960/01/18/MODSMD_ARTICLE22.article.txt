# Indians Trip Tough UW
## 
### Ken Dery 
The Stanford Indians gave the
hometown fans a little extra
something lo cheer about last
Friday night as they staged a
come-from-behind rally that car
ried them to a 58-55 victory over
the invading Washington Huskies.
The big victory at the Pavilion
evened the Cardinal record at 1-1
in Big Five play, while frustrated
Washington suffered its fifth
straight setback. Husky coach
John Crayson must be an un
happy man about this time for his
first five losses were by a total of
eight points.
Started Slowly
The game strated rather slowly
as Washington displayed a tight
man-for-man defense with center
Bill Hanson and forwards Roger
Niva and John Douglas skillfully
clogging the center lane.
The halftime score fo 32-26 in
favor of Washington shows pretty
well that Howie Dallmar's boys
were outplayed in the opening
stanza.
Six foot eight inch Hanson was
most of the story in the first half
as he scored 17 points on a variety
of close-in maneuvers.
Stanford forward John Hendry,
who played his finest game ever,
scored 10 points in the first half,
and guard John Arrillaga added
nine to keep the Indians in con
tention.
62 Per Cent
In the first half Washington
made 13 out of 21 shots for a fine
62 per cent from the field. Stan
ford hit on 9 of 26 for 35 per cent.
The -second half seemed to bo
following the .same pattern as the
first, when with 6:20 remaining,
and the Huskies leading 52-43, the
big break came. Roger Niva, 6-6
forward committed his fifth per
sonal foul and was forced to re
tire for the evening. Although
Niva scored only five points he
was very strong on the boards
and had made himself a gen
eral nuisance to Stanford with his
fine feeding and tough defense.
Full Court Press
The Indians seemed lo sense
this new chance and immediately
went into a successful full court
press. Hendry, Neal Brockmeyer
and Phil Kelly cleared the boards,
and Bub Bowling led the all-out
effort on tiring Washington.
Arrillaga hit a jump shot,
Brockmeyer followed with an
other jumper, Kelly made a free
throw, Hendry hit on another
long shot, Arrillaga canned a
beauty from the head of the key.
and when Hendry pushed through
two clutch foul -shots with 1:30 j
remaining Stanford led 55-54.
Clint Names came right back ;
with a free throw for the boys
from Seattle, but Bowling count
ered for the Indians. Bowling ;
then iced the game with two more
charity tosses.
A special word should be said
about center Neal Brockmeyer
who took some important re- j
bounds and did a fine defensive I
job on Hanson in the second half
holding him to five points.

Three Cards have Cougars Mar as (55) and Reed blocked off
The Stanford Indians gave the
hometown fans a little extra
something lo cheer about last
Friday night as they staged a
come-from-behind rally that car
ried them to a 58-55 victory over
the invading Washington Huskies.
The big victory at the Pavilion
evened the Cardinal record at 1-1
in Big Five play, while frustrated
Washington suffered its fifth
straight setback. Husky coach
John Crayson must be an un
happy man about this time for his
first five losses were by a total of
eight points.
Started Slowly
The game strated rather slowly
as Washington displayed a tight
man-for-man defense with center
Bill Hanson and forwards Roger
Niva and John Douglas skillfully
clogging the center lane.
The halftime score fo 32-26 in
favor of Washington shows pretty
well that Howie Dallmar's boys
were outplayed in the opening
stanza.
Six foot eight inch Hanson was
most of the story in the first half
as he scored 17 points on a variety
of close-in maneuvers.
Stanford forward John Hendry,
who played his finest game ever,
scored 10 points in the first half,
and guard John Arrillaga added
nine to keep the Indians in con
tention.
62 Per Cent
In the first half Washington
made 13 out of 21 shots for a fine
62 per cent from the field. Stan
ford hit on 9 of 26 for 35 per cent.
The -second half seemed to bo
following the .same pattern as the
first, when with 6:20 remaining,
and the Huskies leading 52-43, the
big break came. Roger Niva, 6-6
forward committed his fifth per
sonal foul and was forced to re
tire for the evening. Although
Niva scored only five points he
was very strong on the boards
and had made himself a gen
eral nuisance to Stanford with his
fine feeding and tough defense.
Full Court Press
The Indians seemed lo sense
this new chance and immediately
went into a successful full court
press. Hendry, Neal Brockmeyer
and Phil Kelly cleared the boards,
and Bub Bowling led the all-out
effort on tiring Washington.
Arrillaga hit a jump shot,
Brockmeyer followed with an
other jumper, Kelly made a free
throw, Hendry hit on another
long shot, Arrillaga canned a
beauty from the head of the key.
and when Hendry pushed through
two clutch foul -shots with 1:30 j
remaining Stanford led 55-54.
Clint Names came right back ;
with a free throw for the boys
from Seattle, but Bowling count
ered for the Indians. Bowling ;
then iced the game with two more
charity tosses.
A special word should be said
about center Neal Brockmeyer
who took some important re- j
bounds and did a fine defensive I
job on Hanson in the second half
holding him to five points.

The Stanford Indians gave the
hometown fans a little extra
something lo cheer about last
Friday night as they staged a
come-from-behind rally that car
ried them to a 58-55 victory over
the invading Washington Huskies.
The big victory at the Pavilion
evened the Cardinal record at 1-1
in Big Five play, while frustrated
Washington suffered its fifth
straight setback. Husky coach
John Crayson must be an un
happy man about this time for his
first five losses were by a total of
eight points.
Started Slowly
The game strated rather slowly
as Washington displayed a tight
man-for-man defense with center
Bill Hanson and forwards Roger
Niva and John Douglas skillfully
clogging the center lane.
The halftime score fo 32-26 in
favor of Washington shows pretty
well that Howie Dallmar's boys
were outplayed in the opening
stanza.
Six foot eight inch Hanson was
most of the story in the first half
as he scored 17 points on a variety
of close-in maneuvers.
Stanford forward John Hendry,
who played his finest game ever,
scored 10 points in the first half,
and guard John Arrillaga added
nine to keep the Indians in con
tention.
62 Per Cent
In the first half Washington
made 13 out of 21 shots for a fine
62 per cent from the field. Stan
ford hit on 9 of 26 for 35 per cent.
The -second half seemed to bo
following the .same pattern as the
first, when with 6:20 remaining,
and the Huskies leading 52-43, the
big break came. Roger Niva, 6-6
forward committed his fifth per
sonal foul and was forced to re
tire for the evening. Although
Niva scored only five points he
was very strong on the boards
and had made himself a gen
eral nuisance to Stanford with his
fine feeding and tough defense.
Full Court Press
The Indians seemed lo sense
this new chance and immediately
went into a successful full court
press. Hendry, Neal Brockmeyer
and Phil Kelly cleared the boards,
and Bub Bowling led the all-out
effort on tiring Washington.
Arrillaga hit a jump shot,
Brockmeyer followed with an
other jumper, Kelly made a free
throw, Hendry hit on another
long shot, Arrillaga canned a
beauty from the head of the key.
and when Hendry pushed through
two clutch foul -shots with 1:30 j
remaining Stanford led 55-54.
Clint Names came right back ;
with a free throw for the boys
from Seattle, but Bowling count
ered for the Indians. Bowling ;
then iced the game with two more
charity tosses.
A special word should be said
about center Neal Brockmeyer
who took some important re- j
bounds and did a fine defensive I
job on Hanson in the second half
holding him to five points.
