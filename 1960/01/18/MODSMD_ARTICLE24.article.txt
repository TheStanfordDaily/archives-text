### Vic Affolter 
The Stanford frosh out dc
fensed and out rebounded visit
ing Menlo College in the Pavilion
Saturday night to score a 53 to
34 victory. The winners were
paced by 6-3 Darrell Sutherland
with 14 points.
The Papoose ran up a quick
lead in the early stages of the
game behind the scoring and ball
handling of Sutherland and the
Clementson twins, Don and Doug,
and coasted to a 30 to 18 lead at
half time.
At one point in this stanza the
score was 26 to 9 in favor of
Stanford. The visiting Oaks
closed the gap considerably near
the end of the half as coach Bill
Turner benched his starters and
gave some of his reserves a
chance to see action.
In the second half the visiting
Oaks traded baskets with the
Papoose five until the score
board read 43 to 31, and then the
Stanford frosh dropped in four
straight buckets to ice the game.
Sutherland added 7 more points
in this half mostly on tip ins to

reach his 14 point total. Ho was
followed in scoring for Ihe eve
ning by teamates Doug Clement
son with 10 and Boh Summers
with 8. Chuck Wilson scored 6
points for the frosh.
Postman Bruce Loughner led
the losers with 10 points followed
by forward Tom Inman with 9.
The Papoose relying on a de
cided height advantage, con
stantly maintained control of the
boards. They were able to take
innumerable shots. The Menlo
Oaks found themselves facing a
wall of up-raised arms whenever
they tried to take aim on the
basket and were forced to take
most of their shots from the out
side.
The Papoose managed to hit
only 30 per cent from the field on
24 for 79. Menlo hit 13 for 41 or
32 per cent of their shots. Stan
ford hit a dismal 39 per cent from
Ihe foul line, while Menlo man
aged to hit 47 per cent.
The Papoose, who now sport a
4-2 record, will go up against Di
ablo Valley College next Friday
night at the Stanford Pavilion.
