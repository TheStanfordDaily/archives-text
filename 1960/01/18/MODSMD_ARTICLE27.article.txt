## 
### Glenn Alford 
Santa Clara, one of the better I
frosh basketball teams in the
United States, beat Stanford's
frosh 60-57 in a game played
Friday night in the Pavilion.
Bob Sommers, a good bet for a
first string varsity berth next
year, put on a scoring show and
accumulated 23 points on 11 field
goals and a free throw, but he:
alone could not stem the balanced !
Santa Clara attack. Don Clement
son and Roger Head chipped in
with 11 and 9 respectively, but
they were overpowered by the
huge front line of Santa Clara.
Gene Shields and Joe Weiss, I
forwards, hit 15 points each, and
Joey Meagher, a guard, scored 12. :
The game started with Som-'
mers hitting two 30 foot set shots, :
but Santa Clara came back with I
everybody in the lineup chipping j
in at least two points to get a
17-8 lead.
Stanford moved back into con- j
tention with Don Clementson
hitting a pair of 25 foot jumpers !
to make it 14-18, and closed the j
score to 30-32 at the half.
In the second half, Stanford
was hampered by traveling and i
foul calls, and fell behind 35-43. J
Then Sommers got hot, and j
made eight of Stanford's next ten
points, with Sutherland getting
the other two on a long jump.

Roger Head hit three free ;
throws and a short jumper, while
Sommerfe hit a follow up miss \
following another steal. Don J
Clementson hit a free throw and :
Santa Clara could just counter |
with a Weiss layin and center <
Leroy Jackson's pair of charities ;
to make il 57-58 with a minute!
left.
Sutherland was called for foul- \
ing Meagher and went out with
five personals. Meagher made
both shots. Then the Broncos
stole the ball and stalled their |
way to victory.
