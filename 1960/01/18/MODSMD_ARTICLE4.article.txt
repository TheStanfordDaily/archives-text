# Blast May Be Set Off By France
## 
### 
PARIS (A') France yesterday
restricted air traffic over the
Sahara Desert amid indications
she is ready to trigger a blast
showing that she has joined the
atomic club.
The Defense Ministry said that
beginning today airliners should
stay clear of the zone around
Reggame, one of the Touat oases
in central Algeria about 600 miles
from the nearest Mediterranean
coast and about the same distance
from the nearest point on the
Atlantic.
Restrictions
Over the rest of the French
Sahara, commercial flights were
advised to remain above 10,000
feet, avoid certain other areas and
keep in radio contact with French
authorities. Airlines flying over
the Sahara mostly French and
British were warned on Dec. 31
that the restrictions could be ex
pected on 12 hours notice.
'Exercises'
The communique made no ref
erence to atomic explosions. It
said only that "a certain number
of exercises" would take place in
the desert. However, there have
been indications that France was
about ready to test an atomic
device and thus join the atomic
powers Britain, the United
States and the Soviet Union.
The French announcement said
the new regulations over the
Sahara would be in effect "for the
months to come."
There was no indication when
the test would come, but there
was speculation the French were
waiting only for favorable weath
er.
The French government has as
sured the world, especially Afri
cans, that the test would be car
ried out under such conditions as
to minimize the dangers of radio
active fallout.
After Soviet Warning -
The French announcement was
made four days after Khrushchev
warned of "the consequences if
any state resumed nuclear tests."
The French warning came 10
days after the Soviet Union an
nounced she will be firing power
ful new rockets, built to reach dis
tant planets, into an area of the
Central Pacific southwest of the
Hawaiian Islands.
The Soviet announcement Jan.
7 said the first tests of these mis
siles minus the final stage
could be expected in the month
beginning Jan. 15.
Britain, the United States and
the U.S.S.R. have been observing
a moratorium on nuclear tests for
more than a year while negotia
tions at Geneva went on for a
treaty banning them. In an effort
to put pressure on the Russians
to agree to controls, however,
President Eisenhower announced
at the yearend that the United
States is free to resume tests at
any time after due notice.

After Soviet Warning -
The French announcement was
made four days after Khrushchev
warned of "the consequences if
any state resumed nuclear tests."
The French warning came 10
days after the Soviet Union an
nounced she will be firing power
ful new rockets, built to reach dis
tant planets, into an area of the
Central Pacific southwest of the
Hawaiian Islands.
The Soviet announcement Jan.
7 said the first tests of these mis
siles minus the final stage
could be expected in the month
beginning Jan. 15.
Britain, the United States and
the U.S.S.R. have been observing
a moratorium on nuclear tests for
more than a year while negotia
tions at Geneva went on for a
treaty banning them. In an effort
to put pressure on the Russians
to agree to controls, however,
President Eisenhower announced
at the yearend that the United
States is free to resume tests at
any time after due notice.
PARIS (A') France yesterday
restricted air traffic over the
Sahara Desert amid indications
she is ready to trigger a blast
showing that she has joined the
atomic club.
The Defense Ministry said that
beginning today airliners should
stay clear of the zone around
Reggame, one of the Touat oases
in central Algeria about 600 miles
from the nearest Mediterranean
coast and about the same distance
from the nearest point on the
Atlantic.
Restrictions
Over the rest of the French
Sahara, commercial flights were
advised to remain above 10,000
feet, avoid certain other areas and
keep in radio contact with French
authorities. Airlines flying over
the Sahara mostly French and
British were warned on Dec. 31
that the restrictions could be ex
pected on 12 hours notice.
'Exercises'
The communique made no ref
erence to atomic explosions. It
said only that "a certain number
of exercises" would take place in
the desert. However, there have
been indications that France was
about ready to test an atomic
device and thus join the atomic
powers Britain, the United
States and the Soviet Union.
The French announcement said
the new regulations over the
Sahara would be in effect "for the
months to come."
There was no indication when
the test would come, but there
was speculation the French were
waiting only for favorable weath
er.
The French government has as
sured the world, especially Afri
cans, that the test would be car
ried out under such conditions as
to minimize the dangers of radio
active fallout.
