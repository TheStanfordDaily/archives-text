## 
### Lynn DeLargey 
A new variety of content has
been included in "The Bridge,"
making it into "a magazine of
cosmopolitan outlook." The win
ter issue, which goes on sale to
day, includes pictures, poetry, and
short narrative pieces as well aw
articles on topics of international
interest.
For those who are unfamiliar
wit h th is publication, "The
Bridge" is published by Ihe IIR

as a bridge to international under-1
Standing!
It is the only campus publica- 1
tion which is specifically reserved
for foreign students or for Amer- 1
icans who have traveled and
studied abroad, who wish to share :
their impressions. Future issues
will each have one article pub
lished in a foreign language.
Vienna Youth Festival
The lead article is an excellent 1
factual report on the Vienna !
Youth Festival, written by gradu- j
ate student Jim Morrison, who,
was a delegate rather than a re-!
porter or an ordinary tourist. He :
gives an inside view of the struc
ture and quality of the American 1
delegation to the Communist-J
sponsored gathering and corrects
press reports of the Festival at
several points.
Noting that the effect of ex
tensive cultural competition (en
tertainment, free booklets, dis
plays, etc.) and "subtle goodwill
building" was an appreciable gain
for the Communists, Morrison
makes several positive sugges
tions as to how to counteract this
effect by means outside the Festi- j
val.
'Peace and Friendship'
Peter Grothe's vignette of the]
opening ceremonies of the Festi
val shows how "all of the world's
problems were reduced to such |
simple terms" for the benefit of
the 15,000 young people shouting
"Peace and Friendship" in the
stadium at Vienna.
"Cruelty or Courage?" is the]
question asked of the spectator of
the bullfight in Barcelona, de
scribed by Ray Couchman, who
explains * the almost - religious

I significance which the "corrida"
holds for the Spanish.
The sense of tlie past is very
vivid in "The Immigrant," Alan
{Rosenthal's sketch about a refu
gee who is about to discover his
homeland which he has loved for
many years but never seen.
Two poems, both by Evan
i Jones, appear in this issue: one is
|a short indictment of isolationism
in "an American University." The
other, "A Dream of Barricades,"
;is made up of the opening stanzas
of a narrative poem on a fictitious
I revolution in an unnamed coun
try, tlio selection ending with the
j moment the narrator has a
glimpse of the disaster to follow.
New Asian Freedom
In an article "Taiwan View
! point: Survival of the Far East?"
Godwin Chu suggests some ways
the United States can reinforce
the will of the southeast Asians
to defend their new-found free
dom.
A page of nothing-in-particular
by Averell Harriman begins the
magazine.
At the end of "The Bridge" are
some "Sahl - Marxisms" (might
one call them Marxims?) of
which this is a sample: "Marx
ism is the opium of the marxists."
On the whole "The Bridge" is a
good magazine concealed by a
rather amateurish cover.
