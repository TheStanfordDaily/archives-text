# Computer Replaces Arithmetic

"Our IBM 650 computer can be considered Hie
electronic analogy of a 12-year-old child," began
J. C. Herriot. "All il knows how lo do is add,
subtract, multiply and divide, but more ac
curatcly than most 12-year-olds."
Herriot, a math professor, supervises the crew
of four graduate students and a key punch opera
tor who daily put the collection of wires, buttons
and winking lights through its paces.
Solves Complicated Problems
The computer, located behind a door marked
"Computation Center" in a corner of the Electron
ics Laboratory, is used primarily to solve com
plicated problems in physics and engineering, espe
cially those whose solutions require a great deal
of tedious arithmetic.
Problems in antenna design, predictions of
electron trajectories under conditions which will
be produced in the Mark IV linear accelerator
and interpretation of data compiled from explora
tion of the ionosphere are tasks commonly as
signed the computer.
Stores .Much Information
The machine's value stems from its ability
to store a great deal of information, such as ex
perimental data, and then rapidly perform many
simple calculations according to instructions prev
iously submitted to the memory unit.
Both the numerical data and the instructions
are submitted to the machine on cards, similar
to class cards, which pass through a reading de

vice. This device employs a brush which passes
over the card, detecting the positions of the holes
electrically.
The information submitted on the card is now
in the form of pulses of electric current which
are led to the computer's memory unit where it
is stored as magnetic spots on a cylinder.
The information thus stored has an "address"
on the memory cylinder where it may be located
by the machine whenever the instructions of the
operator require it.
For example, the computer might be instructed
lo add the number of address 1 131 to the number
al address 0362. The numbers corresponding to
these addreses would then be added, and their
sum would be available for further computation.
Problems Require .Many Computations
Many computer problems require 1,000 or more
such computations. An example of an operation
requiring many calculations is the use of Simp
son's Ride lo perform approximate integration.
The IBM 650 computer has been in operation
here since 1956. The commercial rental rate is
about $1,000 a month, but Ilerriot stated that the
University receives ;i "substantial reduction"
which he caller! an "educational contribution" from
IBM.
Ilerriot said that Stanford plans to install
another electronic computer in the spring. Built
by Burroughs Corp., the new machine will lie
faster and will have a capacity of 8,000 words
(information unitsi compared with the present
computer's 2,000,
