# Churches Differ in Tradition, Not Belief, Says Bishop Pike
## 
### 
"The passion of my life is to
find unity where we are, as near
to the legal edge as we can get,"
Bishop James A. Pike said in his
talk at Dinkelspiel last night.
Mutual Learning
Pike stressed thai the way In
Christian unity is not through
wanting "unity on our terms"
nor through saying "it really
doesn't matter what you believe."

The right way to unify I he church
is to have each denomination
learn from each other. This way,
"all is conserved, nothing is lost."
Bishop Pike said that the rea
son that Christians come in so
many varieties is because they
differ in tradition and personal
ity, not in substance. Each group
has something to offer; the
Lutherans, grace through faith;
the Congregationalists. the priest
hood of believers; the Baptists,
the Christians separation from
the rest of the world; the Catho
lics, concern for religion; the
Episcopalians, the present value
of faith; and the Methodists, the
zeal for Christ.
lltiwillingnesss of Officials
Bishop Pike lamented the un
willingness of some of the high
church officials lo join other
chruches. lie said that "when you
are doing well you don't want to
merge."
College students have before
them a marvelous opportunity to
exchange opinion and to grow
closer together in their various
beliefs, said Bishop Pike. He
stressed that the first require
ment for a student is to know his
own tradition well, so that he
is able to give a reason for the
faith he has. Then he must listen
to other traditions with an open
mind, finding the best that is in
each of them.
