# 'Ben-Hur' Time In Greek Week
## 
### Steve Baffrey, Associate Editor 
Questions leading to information about formal rushing still
more than two months awayâ€”dominated all that were posed to
fraternity representatives at Freshman Orientation Talks last night
in the eight lounges of Wilbur Hall.
The talks were the opening activity of the Interfraternity Coun-

| cil's second annual Greek Week
which continues through this Sat
j urday night.
Today's docket will find 24
j candidates for the title of Greek
, Week Queen going to the post at
; the reins of entries in the Chariot
I Races to be held on Campus Drive
I in front of Florence Moore Hall.
All entries will participate in
i the preliminaries at noon, and
I the houses scoring the four top
i times will appear in the finals
at 3 p.m.
In the event of rain the races
will be held on Wednesday in the
I same location and at the same
times. If necessary, signs an
nouncing the decision to postpone
the event will be posted on
I campus.
Open Houses
Open houses will be held in the
24 fraternities today from 3:30
to 5:30 p.m.
All of today's events are all
campus activities.
In last night's discussions, the
role of fraternities in the aca
demic facet of Stanford life was
also deeply explored by question
ing freshmen.
Consensus answer to the most
asked questions was:
"Greek Week is not synony
mous from formal rushing, and
this is not a purpose of these
Orientation Talks. Greek Week is
designed to provide an informal
introduction to the Stanford fra
| ternity system, but not as a rush
] ing function."
Academic Question
On I he academic question, Sig
ma Chi president Rich Thompson
told a Junipero House audience,
I "You are not here for a good so
cial time, and this is not basically
what fraternities are here for
either."
Thompson cited the "increasing
and impressive academic improve
ment" among fraternities over
the past years. "Many times," he
| told the group, "fraternities have
'instilled and helped a desire to
study" within the membership.
Delta Kappa Epsilon President
Duncan Bronson, chairman of the
Orientation Talks, told the same
audience, "Fraternities exist for
the benefit of their members, not
the members for the houses."
Additional Benefits
Bronson also cited the group
social benefits of the system and
the quarterly costs "which aver
age under University housing and
boarding fees."
Additional topics brought out
by questioning included the no
contact rule, pledge duties, for
mal bids, and the proposed quad
rangle housing plans for the fra
ternities.
Additional open houses will be
held tomorrow from 3:30-3:30
p.m. and on Saturday from 1:30-
3:30 p.m.
The Queens' Games are set for
Friday at Rosotti's on Alpine
Iload. Queen candidates will com
pete in three events, and the
Pacific Coast Jazz Band will en
tertain.
