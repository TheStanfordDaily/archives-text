# School Planning Lab Promotes Efficiency
## 
### Marie Prior 
Because of the critical need for
communities to provide adequate
educational facilities for then
schools, Stanford initiated the
School Planning Laboratory, the
only one of its kind in the nation.
Now in its 10th year, the School
Planning Laboratory, located in
Cubberley basement, maintains
an active curriculum to anticipate
school planning needs. Participa
tors in the program are school
administrators who have returned
to Stanford for advanced gradu
ate study.
Facility Improvements
Through the laboratory these
doctoral candidates study ways of
improving present school facili
ties. and investigate school needs
to help the architect design not
only a beautiful school but also
an efficient one.
In addition, these men learn
ways of promoting systemized
planning through economical
measures of advanced site selec
tion and acquisition, research in
school finance and improved
means of forecasting population
growth.
The School Planning Labora
tory also stresses the importance
of incorporating all the talents of
the community into the planning
program. In this way the under

staffed school districts can be
compensated for, and valuable
and necessary support can be at
tained.
Regional ('enter
Because of its outstanding
work in school planning, the lab
oratory was chosen as the west
ern regional center for Educa
t ion a 1 Facilities Laboratories.
Incorporated.
Established in 1958 by the Ford
Foundation, ihe two primary pur
poses of EFL are to stimulate
research and experimentation de
signed to improve school and col
lege facilities, and to implement
the broad dissemination of in
formation on educational facili
ties. A major step in this direc
tion was a grant to Stanford's
School Planning Laboratory.
Dr. James I). MacConnell, Pro
fessor of Education, is head of
the School Planning Laboratory
and director of Ihe western
regional center for EFL. Ray
Sneider. research associate, is as
sistant director.
These men estimate that at
least $10 billion must be devoted
to United States schools in the
next decade in order to keep
abreast with the continuing in
crease in population. The School
Planning Laboratory's .job is to
help discover how the money may
most wisely be spent.
