# Ike Unveils New Budget; Record High--$79 Billion
## Boost Taxes, Build Surplus, Eisenhower Tells Congress 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — President Eisenhower proposed in a $79.-
810,000,000 budget yesterday that a skeptical Congress boost some
taxes, build a big surplus, and whittle defense spending while the
world still teeters "on the edge of disaster."
The odds appeared to be definitely against his getting his way.

Spending bills for missiles and
Navy ships would ba 1 rimmed a
hit, and the one for military air
planes somewhat more, in this
record peacetime budget. It cov
ers the 1961 fiscal year starting
July 1, 1960.
As Eisenhower laid it down, the
government will take in a record
84 billion dollars in revenue in
the next fiscal year, on the ex
pectation of a prospering econo
my which will pass the half-tril
lion-dollar mark. It will spend
§79,816,000,000. This would leave a
$4,184,000,000 surplus which the
President said should be applied
to the vast national debt.
Surplus Tliis Year
In comparison, receipts for the
current fiscal year ending June
30 now are figured at $81,156,000,-
000, spending at $79,354,000,000.
and the surplus at 217 millions.
The President has alloted 57
cents of every dollar to be spent
to major national security. This
is by far the biggest item in the
budget and it would be down 82
million dollars from this year's
level, to $45,568,000,000.
Major national security includes
the military program of the De
fense Department, the atomic en-

ergy program, defense stockpiling
and military aid to friendly na
tions.
Congress may be of a mind 1o
go considerably beyond what Ei
senhower envisions, even though
he told a news conference last
wek that he thinks he probably
knows more about defense than
almost anybody in the country.
National defense already is
tabbed for a careful combing over
on Capitol Hill.
Prudent, Says Ike
Eisenhower told the legislators
his budget is a prudent one and
provides both for "maintaining
required military strength and
enhancing the national welfare."
Doubting Thomases immediate
ly began speaking up. Democrats
cried out about what they called
guessing and playing politics with
finances.
They appeared to be bent on
kicking the props from under Ei
senhower's plan to raise gasoline
and postal rates and pile up $4,-
200,000,000 surplus in the Treas
ury a surplus the administration
figured might lead to a general
reduction in taxes next year.
And they may mount a success
ful drive for more spending on
defense and the conquest of space
than the President wants along
with more for such things as
housing, health and education.
So as Sen. Mike Mansfield <D-
Mont.), puts it, "ifs, ands and
huts" beset the budget and the
projected surplus. Some key Re
publicans had to agree.

810,000,000 budget yesterday that a skeptical Congress boost some
taxes, build a big surplus, and whittle defense spending while the
world still teeters "on the edge of disaster."
The odds appeared to be definitely against his getting his way.

Spending bills for missiles and
Navy ships would ba 1 rimmed a
hit, and the one for military air
planes somewhat more, in this
record peacetime budget. It cov
ers the 1961 fiscal year starting
July 1, 1960.
As Eisenhower laid it down, the
government will take in a record
84 billion dollars in revenue in
the next fiscal year, on the ex
pectation of a prospering econo
my which will pass the half-tril
lion-dollar mark. It will spend
§79,816,000,000. This would leave a
$4,184,000,000 surplus which the
President said should be applied
to the vast national debt.
Surplus Tliis Year
In comparison, receipts for the
current fiscal year ending June
30 now are figured at $81,156,000,-
000, spending at $79,354,000,000.
and the surplus at 217 millions.
The President has alloted 57
cents of every dollar to be spent
to major national security. This
is by far the biggest item in the
budget and it would be down 82
million dollars from this year's
level, to $45,568,000,000.
Major national security includes
the military program of the De
fense Department, the atomic en-

ergy program, defense stockpiling
and military aid to friendly na
tions.
Congress may be of a mind 1o
go considerably beyond what Ei
senhower envisions, even though
he told a news conference last
wek that he thinks he probably
knows more about defense than
almost anybody in the country.
National defense already is
tabbed for a careful combing over
on Capitol Hill.
Prudent, Says Ike
Eisenhower told the legislators
his budget is a prudent one and
provides both for "maintaining
required military strength and
enhancing the national welfare."
Doubting Thomases immediate
ly began speaking up. Democrats
cried out about what they called
guessing and playing politics with
finances.
They appeared to be bent on
kicking the props from under Ei
senhower's plan to raise gasoline
and postal rates and pile up $4,-
200,000,000 surplus in the Treas
ury a surplus the administration
figured might lead to a general
reduction in taxes next year.
And they may mount a success
ful drive for more spending on
defense and the conquest of space
than the President wants along
with more for such things as
housing, health and education.
So as Sen. Mike Mansfield <D-
Mont.), puts it, "ifs, ands and
huts" beset the budget and the
projected surplus. Some key Re
publicans had to agree.
