# ATLAS READY
## ICBM Set For Use, Says Ike 
### 
WASHINGTON (^P) â€”The Unit
ed States now has the first Atlas
intercontinental ballistic missiles
ready for use and by 1965 is ex-
I pected to have four strategic
rocket weapons systems in opera
tion, President Eisenhower told
Congress yesterday.
He put these views into his
$40,996,000,000 military budget
j recommendations, transmitted to
j a Congress in which leading Dem
ocratic members have been sharp
ly critical of what they call the
lagging missile program.
Eisenhower assured Congress
that additional quantities of Air
Force Atlas and Titan missiles
and Navy Polaris rockets will be
procured next year.
The four rocket weapons sys
tems 1o be in use by 1965, his
message said, are the Atlas, the
Titan both liquid fuel ICBMs.
the Minuteman solid-fuel ICBM
and the Polaris 1,200 mile range,
solid-fuel rocket designed for fir
ing from submerged submarines.
The budget message made no
reference to any completely new
co nce p t of weapons, although
there were references to some
new designs.
Eisenhower mentioned "a new
configuration of the Titan mis
sile," which would be ready for
| quick firing from underground
launching "silos," without the
need for frequent changes in fuel.
Once more, he sought to have
Congress approve a cutback in the
size of the National Guard and
reserve forces. Congress has re
jected that idea before.
He would leave the strength of
I the regular military establish
| ment at its present level of 2,489.-
000, instead of continuing the pro
gressive reduction in manpower
which has occurred for several
years and which has been chal
lenged in some congressional
quarters.
