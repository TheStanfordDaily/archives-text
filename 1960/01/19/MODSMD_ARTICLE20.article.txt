Mr. Dillon, the Under Secretary
of State, is in Pari-s for a meeting
which is concerned with a subject
lhat has not yet interested Amer
icans very much.
It is, however, one that in
terests Europeans passionately.
This is the division of almost all
of Western Europe into two
large trading groups, which are
known as the Inner Six and the
Outer Seven.
The Inner Six call themselves
a "community," which is in itself
significant. They have organized
a common market within a cus
toms union and they are in the
process of developing other com
mon financial and administrative
institutions.
The Outer Seven call them
selves by ihe looser name of an
"association." They are pledged
to grant free trade to each other.
But as regards the rest of the
world they have no common
tariff.
The Inner Six consists of
France, West Germany, Italy,
:md the three Low Countries.
The Outer Seven consists of the
United Kingdom, the three
Scandinavian countries, Swit
zerland, Austria, and Portugal.
There are five oth-?r non-Com
munist nations which do not be
long to either group. They are
Iceland, Ireland, Spain, Greece,
and Turkey.
Each of the two groups will
have preferential tariff discrim
ination in favor of its own mem
bers and against not only the
other groups, but against all the
outsiders. At present and for Ihe
foreseeable future the tariff
around the Inner Six will be con
siderably higher than the average
of the tariffs of the Outer Seven.
The Inner Six, with their com
mon market and their growing
agreement to harmonize their
internal affairs, must he re
garded as the nucleus of a new
European power. It is correct
to say, I believe, that the con
ception of the European com
munity was born at the end of
the war out of the dramatic
lessons taught by the war.
One lesson was that Ihe Franco-
German feud, which had produced
three wars in seventy years, was
suicidal and that it must be ended.
The other lesson was that the

[greatness of Europe in the world
could never be restored by the |
European nations separately, and
i that if they were to count among
11ho great powers of the earth,
i they would have to unile.
In their push towards a greater
i European unity, towards some
kind of confederation, the plan
ners and strategists of the Inner
Six have relied upon the energy
of vested interests in the larger
[market to overcome local and na- !
tional obstructions.
They have been eminently
successful. But the methods
they are usin»- to integrate the
Inner Six are making it more
difficult to bring a greater unity
into Europe as a whole. This is
the point which calls for sophis
ticated examination in Wash
ington.
The integration of the Inner
'-Six essentially of France and
West Germany has called into
being the loose defensive associa
tion of the Outer Seven.
This division of Europe is not,
i however, incurable and ominous, !
once France can be persuaded to
[permit the common market to
adopt a low tariff policy.
Hut for the longer run there
is something more serious in
the way the Inner Six are de
veloping their community. As
they intensify the integration
of West Germany with France,
they make it increasingly dif
ficult to reunify Germany.
The East German economy
cannot be integrated with the I
West German except very slowly
land very gradually. That is why i
is no enthusiasm for re
| unification, far from it, in the
inner circles of the common
; market community.
The community of the Inner,
'Six is a good thing. But it has
I grown to a point where what it
! needs in the governments at i
I Washington is not so much a I
! sentimental uncle as a candid
j friend.
This candid friend would be 1
concerned not only with the dis
crimination of the customs union
i but also with the larger problems
of unity -of the unity of the two
Germany, of the unity of the At-1
j lantie community, and of Ihc
i unity of all of Europe.

Mr. Dillon, the Under Secretary
of State, is in Pari-s for a meeting
which is concerned with a subject
lhat has not yet interested Amer
icans very much.
It is, however, one that in
terests Europeans passionately.
This is the division of almost all
of Western Europe into two
large trading groups, which are
known as the Inner Six and the
Outer Seven.
The Inner Six call themselves
a "community," which is in itself
significant. They have organized
a common market within a cus
toms union and they are in the
process of developing other com
mon financial and administrative
institutions.
The Outer Seven call them
selves by ihe looser name of an
"association." They are pledged
to grant free trade to each other.
But as regards the rest of the
world they have no common
tariff.
The Inner Six consists of
France, West Germany, Italy,
:md the three Low Countries.
The Outer Seven consists of the
United Kingdom, the three
Scandinavian countries, Swit
zerland, Austria, and Portugal.
There are five oth-?r non-Com
munist nations which do not be
long to either group. They are
Iceland, Ireland, Spain, Greece,
and Turkey.
Each of the two groups will
have preferential tariff discrim
ination in favor of its own mem
bers and against not only the
other groups, but against all the
outsiders. At present and for Ihe
foreseeable future the tariff
around the Inner Six will be con
siderably higher than the average
of the tariffs of the Outer Seven.
The Inner Six, with their com
mon market and their growing
agreement to harmonize their
internal affairs, must he re
garded as the nucleus of a new
European power. It is correct
to say, I believe, that the con
ception of the European com
munity was born at the end of
the war out of the dramatic
lessons taught by the war.
One lesson was that Ihe Franco-
German feud, which had produced
three wars in seventy years, was
suicidal and that it must be ended.
The other lesson was that the

[greatness of Europe in the world
could never be restored by the |
European nations separately, and
i that if they were to count among
11ho great powers of the earth,
i they would have to unile.
In their push towards a greater
i European unity, towards some

icans very much.
It is, however, one that in
terests Europeans passionately.
This is the division of almost all
of Western Europe into two
large trading groups, which are
known as the Inner Six and the
Outer Seven.
The Inner Six call themselves
a "community," which is in itself
significant. They have organized
a common market within a cus
toms union and they are in the
process of developing other com
mon financial and administrative
institutions.
The Outer Seven call them
selves by ihe looser name of an
"association." They are pledged
to grant free trade to each other.
But as regards the rest of the
world they have no common
tariff.
The Inner Six consists of
France, West Germany, Italy,
:md the three Low Countries.
The Outer Seven consists of the
United Kingdom, the three
Scandinavian countries, Swit
zerland, Austria, and Portugal.
There are five oth-?r non-Com
munist nations which do not be
long to either group. They are
Iceland, Ireland, Spain, Greece,
and Turkey.
Each of the two groups will
have preferential tariff discrim
ination in favor of its own mem
bers and against not only the
other groups, but against all the
outsiders. At present and for Ihe
foreseeable future the tariff
around the Inner Six will be con
siderably higher than the average
of the tariffs of the Outer Seven.
The Inner Six, with their com
mon market and their growing
agreement to harmonize their
internal affairs, must he re
garded as the nucleus of a new
European power. It is correct
to say, I believe, that the con
ception of the European com
munity was born at the end of
the war out of the dramatic
lessons taught by the war.
One lesson was that Ihe Franco-
German feud, which had produced
three wars in seventy years, was
suicidal and that it must be ended.
The other lesson was that the

[greatness of Europe in the world
could never be restored by the |
European nations separately, and
i that if they were to count among
11ho great powers of the earth,
i they would have to unile.
In their push towards a greater
i European unity, towards some
kind of confederation, the plan
ners and strategists of the Inner
Six have relied upon the energy
of vested interests in the larger
[market to overcome local and na- !
tional obstructions.
They have been eminently
successful. But the methods
they are usin»- to integrate the
Inner Six are making it more
difficult to bring a greater unity
into Europe as a whole. This is
the point which calls for sophis
ticated examination in Wash
ington.
The integration of the Inner
'-Six essentially of France and
West Germany has called into
being the loose defensive associa
tion of the Outer Seven.
This division of Europe is not,
i however, incurable and ominous, !
once France can be persuaded to
[permit the common market to
adopt a low tariff policy.
Hut for the longer run there
is something more serious in
the way the Inner Six are de
veloping their community. As
they intensify the integration
of West Germany with France,
they make it increasingly dif
ficult to reunify Germany.
The East German economy
cannot be integrated with the I
West German except very slowly
land very gradually. That is why i
is no enthusiasm for re
| unification, far from it, in the
inner circles of the common
; market community.
The community of the Inner,
'Six is a good thing. But it has
I grown to a point where what it
! needs in the governments at i
I Washington is not so much a I
! sentimental uncle as a candid
j friend.
This candid friend would be 1
concerned not only with the dis
crimination of the customs union
i but also with the larger problems
of unity -of the unity of the two
Germany, of the unity of the At-1
j lantie community, and of Ihc
i unity of all of Europe.
