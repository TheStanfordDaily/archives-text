To the 3,700 students who
packed Memorial Auditorium to
hear facts about Russia it must
have come as a distinct surprise!
that a large part of Governor
Ilarriman's comments wore about j
the American sidr» of tlie world ;
struggle.
Yet it was his insight into Unit
ed States policy that was by far
the most challenging part of
Harriman's talk.
In his comments on foreign aid
Harriman said Ihat he decried
"those in this country who say
we are only capable of doing so
much." In a proper and long
overdue blasting of the Adminis
tration's penchant for the busi
nessman's balanced budget he
said that it wasn't our job to
decide ihe least we could do, but
how much.
He was talking about economics
and foreign aid. of course, but his I
insight throws some challenging'
criticisms to all parts of U.S.
foreign policy.
A very fitting term for the pol- i
icy Governor Harriman was talk- !
ing about is "cheap security"—a I
quest for a kind of bargain deal
where for a minimum of personal
sacrifice on our part we can ob
tain a maximum of protection.
This concept does a much better
job of explaining recent United
States policy than the hypocriti
cal American assumptions that
we're interested in containing
Russia because of our idealistic
concern for the small nations in
the world community.
For example, Europe had just
weathered World War I when
America promised Russia that
armed agression would be met by
"massive retaliation." It was un
important to us that such a re
tailiation would have exploded an
atomic cataclysm over Europe
that would have made the rec-ent
war look like a backyard fight.
Little wonder that European
nations protested the obvious un
fairness of this policy: instead of
a guarantee that America would
sacrifice money and troops to pro
tect their homeland, they were
told instead that they were merely
the "trip wire" which would send
off the SAC fi'om a safe spot in
America, and that ultimately they
would be vaporized for their
trouble right along with the ag
gressor.
Harriman's hinting at cheap
security brings into light our es
sential failing: as the protector of
the free world we can't set our
selves behind the inner wall of
defense, prepared to sacrifice our
friends to avoid the personal
sacrifices of heavier taxes, un- j
balanced hudgets and bigger
armies. |

told instead that they were merely
the "trip wire" which would send
off the SAC fi'om a safe spot in
America, and that ultimately they
would be vaporized for their
trouble right along with the ag
gressor.
Harriman's hinting at cheap
security brings into light our es
sential failing: as the protector of
the free world we can't set our
selves behind the inner wall of
defense, prepared to sacrifice our
friends to avoid the personal
sacrifices of heavier taxes, un- j
balanced hudgets and bigger
armies. |

To the 3,700 students who
packed Memorial Auditorium to
hear facts about Russia it must
have come as a distinct surprise!
that a large part of Governor
Ilarriman's comments wore about j
the American sidr» of tlie world ;
struggle.
Yet it was his insight into Unit
ed States policy that was by far
the most challenging part of
Harriman's talk.
In his comments on foreign aid
Harriman said Ihat he decried
"those in this country who say
we are only capable of doing so
much." In a proper and long
overdue blasting of the Adminis
tration's penchant for the busi
nessman's balanced budget he
said that it wasn't our job to
decide ihe least we could do, but
how much.
He was talking about economics
and foreign aid. of course, but his I
insight throws some challenging'
criticisms to all parts of U.S.
foreign policy.
A very fitting term for the pol- i
icy Governor Harriman was talk- !
ing about is "cheap security"—a I
quest for a kind of bargain deal
where for a minimum of personal
sacrifice on our part we can ob
tain a maximum of protection.
This concept does a much better
job of explaining recent United
States policy than the hypocriti
cal American assumptions that
we're interested in containing
Russia because of our idealistic
concern for the small nations in
the world community.
For example, Europe had just
weathered World War I when
America promised Russia that
armed agression would be met by
"massive retaliation." It was un
important to us that such a re
tailiation would have exploded an
atomic cataclysm over Europe
that would have made the rec-ent
war look like a backyard fight.
Little wonder that European
nations protested the obvious un
fairness of this policy: instead of
a guarantee that America would
sacrifice money and troops to pro
tect their homeland, they were
told instead that they were merely
the "trip wire" which would send
off the SAC fi'om a safe spot in
America, and that ultimately they
would be vaporized for their
trouble right along with the ag
