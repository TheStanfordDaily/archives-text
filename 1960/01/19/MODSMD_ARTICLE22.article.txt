. ... Is that it comes every
week.
The question of the disclaimer
affidavit in the National Defense
Education Act, which is once
again before the Legislature,
raises two fundamental problems
for modern America.
The first, of course, is Ihat of
defense against Communism.
Since Communism became a pow
erful rival to democracy our de
fenses have taken many forms.
The schools and books have been
especially subject to the zeal of
the protectors.
For instance, in Indiana when
McCar thy was in his height, it was
proposed to remove Robin Hood
from the public schools. Robin
Hood, said its opponents, advo
cates robbing the rich to give to
the poor. "That's the Communist
line."
Textbooks have been "ad
justed" in some cases where the
author has dared to criticize
anything in American life.
In another case, in Texas, a
woman, backed by the American
Legion, sought to brand as "dis
loyal" books such as Moby Dick
and Canterbury Tales because
they had been illustrated by an
artist on the Attorney General's |
list.
And then there is the Purdue
University study of opinions of
high school students, revealing
"ignorance about our historic
freedoms, and an alarming will
ingness to give them up."
It is possible that the two are
related in a direction opposite to
that first supposed. Perhaps the
high school students are ignorant
and willing because they have not
been confronted with the facts.
It is argued that if we are going
to fight Communism we must
know about it. Our ignorant high
school students may not realize
what they might be substituting
if they give up the freedoms.
This freedom to learn and
think is the second of our prob
lems.
The United States was not
originally founded on such free
dom. The various groups came
for freedom alright, but it was
freedom for themselves, not nec
essarily for anyone else. But as !
we united we became tolerant of
other views and have since prided
ourselves in that tolerance.
Tolerance does not extend to
the overthrow of the government,:
only to the intellectual under-1
standing of those views which 1
advocate overthrow.
We have even been relatively i
tolerant of those who hold such

views, providing Ihey don't pet
too active.
One question then, regarding
the loyal affidavit, is will it weed
oul those who wish to overthrow
the government? it is well known
that Communists can he as de
voutly "American" as anyone
when it serves their purpose.
Or wo could hope that an op
portunity for further education
would enlighten the would-be
Communist and bring him to our
side instead.
The latter thought failing,
can we expect that affidavit to
be any more effective than tak
ing "Robin Hood" from the
hands of the youth?
On the other hand is it not a
dangerous limitation on our lib
erties those very liberties in fact
which zealous Congressman
thought they were protecting
through the act to place students
and teacher's arbitrarily on the
suspect list?
The argument that any loyal
citizens should be willing to sign
the affidavit is weak if we con
sider not jusl loyalty to the gov
ernment but to what the govern
ment stands for.
And Ed Cutter should be one
of the first to recall that his state
ment that any organization can
put any stipulation it wishes on
money it loans just "ain't nec
essarily so."

line."
Textbooks have been "ad
justed" in some cases where the
author has dared to criticize
anything in American life.
In another case, in Texas, a
woman, backed by the American

And then there is the Purdue
University study of opinions of
high school students, revealing
"ignorance about our historic
freedoms, and an alarming will
ingness to give them up."
It is possible that the two are
related in a direction opposite to
that first supposed. Perhaps the
high school students are ignorant
and willing because they have not
been confronted with the facts.
It is argued that if we are going
to fight Communism we must
know about it. Our ignorant high
school students may not realize
what they might be substituting
if they give up the freedoms.
This freedom to learn and
think is the second of our prob
lems.
The United States was not
originally founded on such free
dom. The various groups came
for freedom alright, but it was
freedom for themselves, not nec
essarily for anyone else. But as !
we united we became tolerant of
other views and have since prided
ourselves in that tolerance.
Tolerance does not extend to
the overthrow of the government,:
only to the intellectual under-1
standing of those views which 1
advocate overthrow.
We have even been relatively i
tolerant of those who hold such

views, providing Ihey don't pet
too active.
One question then, regarding
the loyal affidavit, is will it weed
oul those who wish to overthrow
the government? it is well known
that Communists can he as de
voutly "American" as anyone
when it serves their purpose.
Or wo could hope that an op
portunity for further education
would enlighten the would-be
Communist and bring him to our
side instead.
The latter thought failing,
can we expect that affidavit to
be any more effective than tak
ing "Robin Hood" from the
hands of the youth?
On the other hand is it not a
dangerous limitation on our lib
erties those very liberties in fact
which zealous Congressman
thought they were protecting
through the act to place students
and teacher's arbitrarily on the
suspect list?
The argument that any loyal
citizens should be willing to sign
the affidavit is weak if we con
sider not jusl loyalty to the gov
ernment but to what the govern
ment stands for.
And Ed Cutter should be one
of the first to recall that his state
ment that any organization can
put any stipulation it wishes on
money it loans just "ain't nec
essarily so."

week.
The question of the disclaimer
affidavit in the National Defense
Education Act, which is once
again before the Legislature,
raises two fundamental problems
for modern America.
The first, of course, is Ihat of
defense against Communism.
Since Communism became a pow
erful rival to democracy our de
fenses have taken many forms.
The schools and books have been
especially subject to the zeal of
the protectors.
For instance, in Indiana when
McCar thy was in his height, it was
proposed to remove Robin Hood
from the public schools. Robin
Hood, said its opponents, advo
