Language Lack
Kditor, Till* Daily:
In his Thursday speech. Mr.
Harriman entreats all Americans
to study communist theory in
order that they may understand
[ the Russians by finding out "what
they are thinking about and what
they are after."
It is somehow disquieting to
realize that the author of this
statement, a former advisor on
Russian affairs to two U.S. presi
dents and for four years United
States ambassador to the Soviet
Union, has never considered it

sufficiently deserving of his time
lo learn the Russian language.
