Has Iho Stanford basketball loam como of ago? Certainly this
question is in Coach Howie Dallmar's and many i ard cage fans'
minds after the first weekend sweep of the season by the Indians
over Washington and \VSU. After starting slowly the Indians came
from behind to whip a talented but inexperienced Husky crew on
Friday night and followed up by polishing off the W'SU Cougars
Saturday.
The deriding factor in the Husky game was forwar I John Hendry.
Hendry's rebounding and defensive ability never has been found
lacking by the Cards but last Friday night he certainly put on his
best shooting show of the season, making a variety of shots and
ending with 17 points for high point man of the game.
All hough perhaps hampered by a sore knee, Hendry hit for six
more points Saturday against the Cougars to place him fourth in
Card scoring for the season with 9(5 points and his rebounding
this weekend produced a season total of 71 and second in that de
partment for the Tribe.
A Coach' Dallmar change in lineup gave the Indians a victory

Saturday. Dalhnar started Neal
ltroekineyer at center and moved
John Windsor to forward, which
when Jerry Tluiesen was substi
tuted for lleudry, gave the Tribe
an impressive b-S average for
ward line. The throe big men
collected 32 of the Tribe's 57
points. Windsor probably played
one of his best games so far this
year, collecting 16 points high
for the game and six rebounds.
It certainly appeared that he
looked a lot more at home at the
forward spot.
The added height shoidd aid
the Indians immensely this sea
son because as evidenced by
their out rebounding the Cougars
under the Card offensive boards
the added rebounds will cer
tainly give the Indians more
shots. If the "Rig Four" —Hendry,
Windsor, Broeknieyer and Tluie
sen can hold up for the rest of
the season, we may see Stanford
consistently out - rebounding its
opponents which would certainly
be a rarity.

Of course the two fine guards for the Indians Bub Bowling' and
John Arrillaga definitely will aid the Tribe in the rest of the sen
son as they seem to improve every game. Arrillugu is the leading
scorer this; year with a 13.2 points per game average and his
accurate jump shots from 20 to 30 feet out serve quite a bit to
demoralize the opposition. Bowling is the Card's playmaker and
third leading scorer. The two guards' ball-handling and ball-hawk
in,U have kept the opposition honest.
Now It's llie East vs. West
One of the most interesting items to come out of the NCAA
basketball stats is the fact that of the top eighteen teams on defense
in the Nation, ten are from the Pacific Coast and only three Duke,
Toledo and Providence are eastern teams. Stanford with its .">3.1
point per game average given to opponents is third or fourth in
the Nation and. of course. Cal still leads in this department.
There are two obvious differences in western and eastern basket
ball and the arguments as to the best have raged back and forth for
quite some time. The eastern critics claim that their fast-breaking,
high-scoring basketball is the best, whereas the western fan favors
the slow, deliberate, set-the-play-up type of offense. These two dif
ferent styles are evident in cage stats which always see Ihe YV<'«.t
tops in defense while the Kast leads in offense.
Another Argument
r-
Another argument is in the type of team play by the two sec
tions. This year the East seems to feature the good big man as per
Oscar Robertson for Cincinnati and Jerry West for West Virginia
and the team's victory depends on how many points these super
stars score. Bradley, currently the number two ranked by A.P.
learn is the only exception.
However, although the wire polls place Bradley and Cincinnati
from the East over the Cal Bears of the West, the real test will
come in the play-offs and so far the West at least Cal has shown
that their type of ball is best.

tions. This year the East seems to feature the good big man as per
Oscar Robertson for Cincinnati and Jerry West for West Virginia
and the team's victory depends on how many points these super
stars score. Bradley, currently the number two ranked by A.P.

JOHN HFNDRY

Has Iho Stanford basketball loam como of ago? Certainly this
question is in Coach Howie Dallmar's and many i ard cage fans'
minds after the first weekend sweep of the season by the Indians
over Washington and \VSU. After starting slowly the Indians came
from behind to whip a talented but inexperienced Husky crew on
Friday night and followed up by polishing off the W'SU Cougars
Saturday.
The deriding factor in the Husky game was forwar I John Hendry.
Hendry's rebounding and defensive ability never has been found
lacking by the Cards but last Friday night he certainly put on his
best shooting show of the season, making a variety of shots and
ending with 17 points for high point man of the game.
All hough perhaps hampered by a sore knee, Hendry hit for six
more points Saturday against the Cougars to place him fourth in
Card scoring for the season with 9(5 points and his rebounding
this weekend produced a season total of 71 and second in that de
partment for the Tribe.
A Coach' Dallmar change in lineup gave the Indians a victory

Saturday. Dalhnar started Neal
ltroekineyer at center and moved
John Windsor to forward, which
when Jerry Tluiesen was substi
tuted for lleudry, gave the Tribe
an impressive b-S average for
ward line. The throe big men
collected 32 of the Tribe's 57
points. Windsor probably played
one of his best games so far this
year, collecting 16 points high
for the game and six rebounds.
It certainly appeared that he
looked a lot more at home at the
forward spot.
The added height shoidd aid
the Indians immensely this sea
son because as evidenced by
their out rebounding the Cougars
under the Card offensive boards
the added rebounds will cer
tainly give the Indians more
shots. If the "Rig Four" —Hendry,
Windsor, Broeknieyer and Tluie
sen can hold up for the rest of
the season, we may see Stanford
consistently out - rebounding its
opponents which would certainly
be a rarity.

Of course the two fine guards for the Indians Bub Bowling' and
John Arrillaga definitely will aid the Tribe in the rest of the sen
son as they seem to improve every game. Arrillugu is the leading
scorer this; year with a 13.2 points per game average and his
accurate jump shots from 20 to 30 feet out serve quite a bit to
demoralize the opposition. Bowling is the Card's playmaker and
third leading scorer. The two guards' ball-handling and ball-hawk
in,U have kept the opposition honest.
Now It's llie East vs. West
One of the most interesting items to come out of the NCAA
basketball stats is the fact that of the top eighteen teams on defense
in the Nation, ten are from the Pacific Coast and only three Duke,
Toledo and Providence are eastern teams. Stanford with its .">3.1
point per game average given to opponents is third or fourth in
the Nation and. of course. Cal still leads in this department.
There are two obvious differences in western and eastern basket
ball and the arguments as to the best have raged back and forth for
quite some time. The eastern critics claim that their fast-breaking,
high-scoring basketball is the best, whereas the western fan favors
the slow, deliberate, set-the-play-up type of offense. These two dif
ferent styles are evident in cage stats which always see Ihe YV<'«.t

There are two obvious differences in western and eastern basket
ball and the arguments as to the best have raged back and forth for
quite some time. The eastern critics claim that their fast-breaking,
high-scoring basketball is the best, whereas the western fan favors
the slow, deliberate, set-the-play-up type of offense. These two dif
ferent styles are evident in cage stats which always see Ihe YV<'«.t
tops in defense while the Kast leads in offense.
Another Argument
r-
Another argument is in the type of team play by the two sec
tions. This year the East seems to feature the good big man as per
Oscar Robertson for Cincinnati and Jerry West for West Virginia
and the team's victory depends on how many points these super
stars score. Bradley, currently the number two ranked by A.P.
learn is the only exception.
However, although the wire polls place Bradley and Cincinnati
from the East over the Cal Bears of the West, the real test will
come in the play-offs and so far the West at least Cal has shown
that their type of ball is best.

Arc I ribc (lane Fortunes Rising?
Has Iho Stanford basketball loam como of ago? Certainly this
question is in Coach Howie Dallmar's and many i ard cage fans'
minds after the first weekend sweep of the season by the Indians
over Washington and \VSU. After starting slowly the Indians came
from behind to whip a talented but inexperienced Husky crew on
Friday night and followed up by polishing off the W'SU Cougars
Saturday.
The deriding factor in the Husky game was forwar I John Hendry.
Hendry's rebounding and defensive ability never has been found
lacking by the Cards but last Friday night he certainly put on his
best shooting show of the season, making a variety of shots and
ending with 17 points for high point man of the game.
All hough perhaps hampered by a sore knee, Hendry hit for six
more points Saturday against the Cougars to place him fourth in
Card scoring for the season with 9(5 points and his rebounding
this weekend produced a season total of 71 and second in that de
partment for the Tribe.
A Coach' Dallmar change in lineup gave the Indians a victory

Saturday. Dalhnar started Neal
ltroekineyer at center and moved
John Windsor to forward, which
when Jerry Tluiesen was substi
tuted for lleudry, gave the Tribe
an impressive b-S average for
ward line. The throe big men
collected 32 of the Tribe's 57
points. Windsor probably played
one of his best games so far this
year, collecting 16 points high
for the game and six rebounds.
It certainly appeared that he
looked a lot more at home at the
forward spot.
The added height shoidd aid
the Indians immensely this sea
son because as evidenced by
their out rebounding the Cougars
under the Card offensive boards
the added rebounds will cer
tainly give the Indians more
shots. If the "Rig Four" —Hendry,
Windsor, Broeknieyer and Tluie
sen can hold up for the rest of
the season, we may see Stanford
consistently out - rebounding its
opponents which would certainly
be a rarity.

Of course the two fine guards for the Indians Bub Bowling' and
John Arrillaga definitely will aid the Tribe in the rest of the sen
son as they seem to improve every game. Arrillugu is the leading
scorer this; year with a 13.2 points per game average and his
accurate jump shots from 20 to 30 feet out serve quite a bit to
demoralize the opposition. Bowling is the Card's playmaker and
third leading scorer. The two guards' ball-handling and ball-hawk
in,U have kept the opposition honest.
Now It's llie East vs. West
One of the most interesting items to come out of the NCAA
basketball stats is the fact that of the top eighteen teams on defense
in the Nation, ten are from the Pacific Coast and only three Duke,
Toledo and Providence are eastern teams. Stanford with its .">3.1
point per game average given to opponents is third or fourth in
the Nation and. of course. Cal still leads in this department.
