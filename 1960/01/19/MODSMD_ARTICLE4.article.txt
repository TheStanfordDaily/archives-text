# Socialism Reduced to Plumbing
## 
### Bob Frank 
H. N. Simon of Palo Alto pic
tured the choice between Social
ism and Capitalism as a "life and
death issue" last night before the
Political Union Independent
Caucus at Bowman Alumni
House.
A member of the Slate Execu
tive Committee of the Socialist
Labor Party, Simon is a Marxist.
He said that there never has been
and is not now a socialist society
such as Marx describes.
Simon said I hat he has accepted
the Marxist view because only ii
"explains the problems of capital
ism and offers the answers."
Marx has been blamed for in
venting the materialist interpre
tation of history, the classic
struggle, and the law of value,
said Simon, but he only dis
covered them.
Simon claimed that the prob
, lems of capitalism are caused by
the laborer's creating more value
;than he is compensated for, and
being unable to buy goods equal
:in value to the value he has
j created.
Using buckets drawn on a
1 blackboard, Simon showed that
j this came down to a problem of
I plumbingâ€”what to do with the
overflow of production over con
| sumption. He said that this has
1 been temporarily solved by in
creasing consumption (wars) or
decreasing production (unemploy
ment), but the answer is public
ownership of the buckets so that
! everything produced can go di
i rect to the consumer.
