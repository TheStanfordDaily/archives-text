# Year's Deepest Book?

WASHINGTON (/P) — Just to look at President Eisenhower's
budget is a sobering experience.
It's something like a metropolitan phone book, although not
so exhilarating. It weighs lour pounds; has 952 pages, phis a 78-
page introduction; costs $5.50; and presents statistics scampering
everywhere, in tiny print.
Eisenhower sent the budget to Congress yesterday and two ob
servations can be made immediately:
1. Any—well, almost any —college-trained economist could un
stand it.
2. Probably no more formidable book will be published Ibis
year.
I'iven its first sentence is discouraging to one who loves and
would like to protect the English language from govermental harm.
"Pursuant to the provisions of the Budget and Account Act 31
U.S. ('. 1-24 and other applicable laws," it begins gaily, "the budget
for the fiscal year 1961 contains the President's recommendations
for the work program and financial program of the government
for the 12 months beginning July 1, 1966, and ending June 30, 1961."
Despite these portents, anyone who has the patience will find
it wortli-while to plow resolutely through the budget.
The hugeness of the government is shown on almost any page.
Open the big book anywhere. Here's Page 396, and news from
the general counsel's office at the Agriculture Department.
It will cost $3,358,815 to give legal advice to this one depart
ment. By contrast, our first attorney general worked part-time,
since in all the departments of government there wasn't enough
work to keep one lawyer occupied.
