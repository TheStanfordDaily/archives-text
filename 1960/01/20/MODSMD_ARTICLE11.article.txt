## 
### Ross Hermann 
Censorship constitutes a danger
to civil liberties, John Henry
Merryman, Stanford professor of
1 law, warned last night in a debate
with Mrs. Molly Minudri, chair
man of the San Francisco League
for Decent Literature. The debate,
.'nl it led "Pornography and the
j Law," was the second of the Tues
day Evening Series.
lie said in opposing the censor
ship of obscene or pornographic
literature that "one man's sex is
! another's obscenity."
Assuming that obscene litera
ture is a problem, it was Merry
man's view that it cannot be con
trolled by law. lie said, however,
that it has never been sufficiently
demonstrated that "dirty" books
necessarily lead to "dirty" acts.
According to a Harvard study
' there does not seem to be any cor*
i relation.
Record Poor
He noted that in the past Ihc
record of censors has been poor,
1 and censorship has generally been
I irrational and abritrary.
To demonstrate the inherent
weakness and inefficiency of cen
sorship. he cited the fact that
"Tom Sawyer" by Samuel Clem
ens, "Confessions" by Rousseau,
"Candidc" by Voltaire, and tho
"Grapes of Wrath" by John Stein
heck were at one time banned by
overzealous censors.
In the main of her presenta*
j tion, Mrs. Minudri stated that it
is not the desire of her commit
tee to ban or censor, but it is
their purpose to bring about a
greater public awareness of the
"trash" to which American youth
! is being exposed. She said that
the committee, acting upon the
| principle of free speech, is only
; trying to appeal to the "inherent
law of decency in all of us."
Admits Censorship
Merryman concurred with Mrs.
j Minudri that this purpose is
legitimate but warned that it
must remain within these limits,
j Under specific questioning from
Merryman, Mrs. Minudri admit
ted, however, that she is in favor
of censorship. She said that 35
cent pocket-sized "trash" has no
value as literature, is written only
for its sensational qualities, and
should be banned.
She failed, however, to answer
the question of how the line is
If) he drawn between literature
and trash and who is qualified to
i make the distinction.
