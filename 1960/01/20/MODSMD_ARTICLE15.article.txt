l.ovaltv affidavits tied to student loans l>\ the federal gov

General student interest appears up, and Legislature is again
considering the question, though no significant new developments
have transpired since last spring.
In the spring, Legislature went on record as opposing the
oaths this time, Legislature is expected to approve taking posi
tive action to make known student opposition to the affidavit.
Such action, it is assumed, would take the form of a letter
to (lon gross.
The I niversity position on the affidavit has been known for
some time: it opposes the oath in principle, hut will not prevent
students from accepting the federal grants. Furthermore, this j
poliev has remained consistent throughout, although some stu
dents seem to feel tlx l oath question is something brand new. I
rather than something which was battled out nearly a year ago. j
Our position has been and continues to be one of opposition
to the oaths. I lie academic side of the question can be argued at
some length, chicflv on grounds of au individual's right to believe
versus the government's right to gi\e money only to those it feels
like giving it to.
Though not as principled a point as that of right to believe.!
we think probably the strongest practical argument against the
affidavit is tiiat it just won't work. Any Communist worth his
salt would feel no qualms about signing the oath. There just
plain isn't am point to the thing so why impinge on one's right
to believe for no purpose whatsoever.
We cannot, however, agree with those who want to see Stan-:
ford ban students from accepting these government grants ifL
there is no objection to signing the oath. It would seem to us that
Stanford's telling a student whose grant he can take would be j
nearlv as grave an offense as the government putting strings on
the grant in the first place.
