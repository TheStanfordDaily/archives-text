## 'Act One' Humorous, Entertains 
### Mary Lou McKinley 
Steadily holding the top posi
tion on the best seller list, Moss
Hart's "Act One" (Random
j House, 1959> is an entertaining
and humorous account of how the
famous playwright-director final
ly achieved his lifelong desire to
enter show business.
Filled with familial' names
(Max Siegel, Alfred Lunt, Cary
Grant, to name a few) as well as
with less known but none the less
memorable characters, the auto
j biography provides a vivid pic
ture of Broadway, the Bronx
(where Hart spent his childhood)
I and the subway on which the
author rode to reach his first job
! in the storage vault of a large
wholesale furrier.
Cool, Anyway
This tedious job, although not
on Broadway, did have its com
pensations, relates Hart, as it was
' cool inside, provided him ample
time to read and furnished him
[with space on the subway once
he had learned to take advantage
of Ihe smell of uncirred skins
j which hung over him during the
two and a half years of his job
there.
Written with candor and an
almost-strict adherance to fact,
the fast-reading book is neither
: self-confessional nor applause
j seeking. The tone is fresh and
delightful with easy, straightfor
i ward prose which continues to
hold ihe reader's attention
•■through the last chapter and the
j production of "Once In A Life
j time," Halt's first Broadway sue-
I cess.
Lots of Stories
"Act One" tells of George S.
Kaufman's "awful fudge" which
appeared from bureau drawers
during all-night rewrite sessions,
of the author's theater-oriented
Aunt Kate who was "a touching
combination of the sane and the
ludicrous" and describes his hilar
ious experiences as social director
for numerous summer camps
where he "did a wonderful Fanny
Brice, an impeccable Charleston,
played the ukulele and 'made fun'
on the dining-room steps."
The book is definitely a success
story, for today Moss Hart is one
of the brilliant figures on the
American theater scene. Along
with George Kaufman he has
written such successes as "You
Can't Take It With You" and
"The Man Who Came to Dinner"
as well as directing his own and
others' plays and musicals, the
latest of which being the now
legendary "My Fair Lady."
