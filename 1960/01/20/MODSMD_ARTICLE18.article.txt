### Rich Sundeen ASSU President 
Editor's Note: Rich Sundeen
lias asked Scotty Thompson,
Wilbur representative and
chairman of Legislature's Pub
lic and International Affairs
Committee, to write this week's
Presidential Comments.
Before borrowing funds under
the National Defense Education
Act, a student must:
• file an affidavit that he
"does not believe in, and is not a
member of, and does not support
any organization that believes in
or teaches, the overthrow of the
: United States Government . .."
• take the oath "I do solemnly
I swear that 1 will bear true faith
and allegiance to the United
States..."
Arguing in favor of the affi
davit, one might say the govern
ment may put any restrictions it
pleases on money it lends, and
that one so fortunate to receive
such airi should be thankful
enough to state that he doesn't
believe in overthrowing the coun
t ry.
On the other hand, no one will
i say Congress doesn't have the
1 right to impose these restrictions,
i A resolution coming before Legis-
I lature tomorrow will ask mem
j hers simply to request Congress
i to remove the negative affidavit
| for the following reasons:
• The disclaimer does not pro
j tect us from Communist use of
| I he money. By the nature of Corn
i munism, a member would only lie
j encouraged to lie to use American
funds for his education. Further
more, according to the national
administration, this sworn state
ment would never be used in ar
resting a Communist; the Smith
Act covers the same ground more
thoroughly and effectively.
• The affidavit infringes on a
shadow zone of the individual's
personal freedom, and sets a dan-

I gerous precedent. Directing peo
| pie what not to believe is against
j the spirit of our Constitution.
• The disclaimer singles out
students as a group worthy of
suspicion; Congress, in granting
funds, tells few other groups
what to believe The affidavit
implies that the very group it
wishes to help is unworthy of its
trust an ironic implication, with
education supposedly our only
hope to retain world leadership.
• Countless students can not
co n sci entio u si y accept such
j money. There is no question what
soever of iheir loyalty, because of
; their willingness to sign the oath
I of allegiance. They only feel that
j our country's security comes
from the strength of individuals
freely supporting this democracy,
without being told what to be-1
lieve, even if they do believe such ■
on that particular issue.
In this sense, the affidavit i«
j worse than futile. In its very na-
I ture it prevents qualified people)
'from obtaining aid, at the same j
time protecting us from no one. \
1 T t could almost be dangerous, put- i
: ting in a false sense of security.
The administration of Stanford,
and that of nearly every other [
college, as well as the incumbent
i national administration, is thor-i
oughly opposed, on record, to ihe
affidavit for those preceding rea
sons. Stanford, though, must con
tinue to accept the money, as it
hasn't sufficient funds to replace
i the $154,000 involved. But it con
tinues to use all its power in the
proper channels to bring pressure
upon Congress to remove the
' affidavit.
But broad student action will be
; necessary for Congress to see the
concern. Thus, Legislature will
vote whether it should do as the
Administration has done, and.
| through the proper channels, rec
ommend that the affidavit be
dropped, as it accomplishes no
i posit ive purpose.
