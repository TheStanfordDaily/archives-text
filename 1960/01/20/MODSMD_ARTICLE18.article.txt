### Rich Sundeen ASSU President 
Editor's Note: Rich Sundeen
lias asked Scotty Thompson,
Wilbur representative and
chairman of Legislature's Pub
lic and International Affairs
Committee, to write this week's
Presidential Comments.
Before borrowing funds under
the National Defense Education
Act, a student must:
• file an affidavit that he
"does not believe in, and is not a
member of, and does not support
any organization that believes in
or teaches, the overthrow of the
: United States Government . .."
• take the oath "I do solemnly
I swear that 1 will bear true faith
and allegiance to the United
States..."
Arguing in favor of the affi

administration, this sworn state
ment would never be used in ar
resting a Communist; the Smith
Act covers the same ground more
thoroughly and effectively.
• The affidavit infringes on a
shadow zone of the individual's
personal freedom, and sets a dan-

I gerous precedent. Directing peo
| pie what not to believe is against
j the spirit of our Constitution.
• The disclaimer singles out
students as a group worthy of
suspicion; Congress, in granting
funds, tells few other groups
what to believe The affidavit
implies that the very group it
wishes to help is unworthy of its
trust an ironic implication, with
education supposedly our only
hope to retain world leadership.
• Countless students can not
co n sci entio u si y accept such
j money. There is no question what
soever of iheir loyalty, because of
; their willingness to sign the oath
I of allegiance. They only feel that
