ICditor, The Daily:
Mr. Harriman's ideas on educa
tion are somewhat "underdevel
oped." In his first talk he revealed
a peculiar complacency toward
the American educational syslem
in comparison to Russia. Has not
Russia produced the results?
Within a matter of years her
scientists have sprung to the fore
ift such diverse fields as radio
electronics and geology, and of
course, rocket research.
Yet even today many of Amer
ican top men are imported brains.
Mr. Harriman's remarks about a
"rounded student" hardly ap
proach the problem. Would it
not be better to admit that busi
ness and other fields attract the
thinking people, and ihe scientist
here is regarded as an "egghead."
More pernicious, however, was
Mr. Harriman's suggestion that
it should be compulsory for col
lege students to take courses in
communist philosophy. What lev

els of indoctrination is lie pro
pared lo sink to?
The suggestion that any Uni
versity course should be compul
sory is a violation of traditional
western standards of academic
freedom.
The suggestion that commun
ism should he such a subject re
veals a mad purpose, under the
guise of "free thought" to inun
date prejudices just as the Rus
sians are accused of doing under
their system.
Communist philosophy, like
any other ideas, should be taught
in colleges. Let it be the subject
matter for interested inquiring
minds, not for "canned" students
with intellectual tetanus.
