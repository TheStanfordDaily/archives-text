MOSCOW (/P) â€” Soviet use of
the central Pacific as a rocket
proving ground may lead to a shot
at Mars and a new drive to the

moon.
Strong indications of this have
been given by Soviet astronomers
in interviews and in articles in
Soviet newspapers and scientific
magazines. It apparently adds up
to something besides talk.
Steer Clear
The Soviet government e a r 1 y I
this month warned all shipping I
and planes to steer clear, from j
Jan. 15 to Feb. 15, of a 45,000-
square-miles zone southwest of
Hawaii while it conducted experi
ments with powerful new rockets.
It said heavy first or second
stages might fall in the area.
This followed publication in the
last 1959 issue of the Soviet Acad
emy of Sciences Bulletin of an
article detailing what would be
needed in new moon projects and \
what might be done about photo
graphing Mars through a tele
scope on a satellite.
Announcements Rare
The Soviet Union rarely an
nounces in advance what it i-s
planning to do, but the scientists'
talk appears to point to a possible
double project before the end of
the test period Feb. 15.
