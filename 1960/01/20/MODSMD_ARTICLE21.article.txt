# BY EMERITUS PROFESSOR
## New Book Tells History, Anecdotes About Stanford 
### Jim Fitch 
A new book has appeared at i
, the Stanford Bookstore, appro
priately entitled Stanford, The
Story of a University, by Edith R.
Mirrielees, Professor of English,
Emeritus.
Prof. Mirrielees is well quali
fied to relate Stanford's history.
She was graduated here in 1907 i
anrl returned to teach in 1910.
Reasons for Success
Perhaps the outstanding attri
butes of the book are its earlier;
chapters which give, along with I
' the standard facts of history, an ;
adequate outline of the reasons
for Stanford's early and continu
ing success as a university.
David Starr Jordan is placed at
tlie top of this list of reasons fori
success.
Prof. Mirrielees' description of
Jordan has him as but little short
of a superman, yet she makes j
him quite human and alive.
It is told how Jordan, on the i
J first day of his appointment as
president, issued what has been j
called a "Magna Carta for West
ern college professors" the pol-;
icy that Stanford's faculty would
be provided with research mate
: rials, time for research, anrl pro
vision for publications of their
findings.
Credit to Stanford
Prof. Mirrielees sees the intel
ligence which Senator and Mrs.
Stanford showed in maintaining
a policy of non-interference with '
' Jordan as another important fac
tor.
She is not at all harsh in her
judgment of Senator Stanford's
business methods before the
founding of the University, since
she maintains that a man "must
be judged by the standards of his
own times."
After describing the founda
tions of Stanford's growth in the
opening chapters, Prof. Mirrielees
proceeds in chronological order to

relate the University's history to
present day.
Her bonk would appear to have
a stronger beginning than end
ing but this is, in part', at least,
justifiable. It is much easier to
pin down the results and conse
quences of events of 50 years
ago, whereas it is more difficult
to pinpoint and foretell the out
come of the present.
