Berlin Rally
Editor's Note: The following
letter, received this week, was
written Jan. J) l>y two Stanford
men who are presently study
ing at the Free University in
Berlin.
Editor, The Daily:
Last night we took part in a
protest march of the Berliner j
youth against the recent flare-up
of anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi inci
dents in Germany. The spectacle
was heartening thousands of
students, members of youth
groups and trade unions, and pri
vate citizens marching to show
their disgust with the occurrences
and their readiness to fight any
new growth of prejudice.
The demonstration was spon
taneous. The only preparation for
the rally consisted of placards
posted during the day around the
Free University and elsewhere in
Berlin announcing the time and
place.
The turnout was overwhelm-!
ing in spite of the cold. The news- i
paper estimates ranged from I
10,000 to 40,000 participants.!
Many were carrying torches or ;
banners with slogans. The pro-1
cession led to Steinplatz, where
the Memorial to the Victims of
National Socialism stands. There i
several student leaders and Sen- ;
ator Lipschitz from the Berlin
government delivered short
speeches, which were enthusias-1
tically received by the crowd.
The main points they expressed
were:
1. An insult directed against a
Jew or any member of a minority
group is in reality an insult
against the whole German people. !
2. Parents, teachers and profes
sors should give up their inclina
tion to forget what happened be
tween 1933 and 19415, and instead
should describe and condemn the
horrors of the Nazi regime.
3. The demonstration was not !
a result of fear of resurgent j
Naziism but rather of anger
against those who retain the Nazi
ideas and who through anti-
Semitic acts attempt to discredit
West Berlin and the Federal Re
public.
4. The sternest measures should
be taken against those taking part
in the neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic j
activities. (Two days ago an ex-
Army officer was sentenced to 17
months in prison for expounding
Na/.i ideas in a bar here in Ber
lin.)
5. The free democracy in West
Berlin and West Germany does
not need the help of the Com
munists to stamp out the linger
ing remnants of Naziism and anti-
Semitism. The free and demo
crate Weimar Republic fell be
cause of the attack from two
sides- the Nazi side and the Com

munist side. Both these forms of
totalitarianism must be fought
for democracy to survive.
6. The anti-Semitic actions must
be combat ted not simply for
political reasons, but on humani
tarian grounds, as any threat to
the rights and peace of our fel
low men should be fought.
At the end of his speech Sena
tor Lipschitz mentioned that it
was a Jewish holiday. At his sug
gestion the crowd filed silently
into the Fasanenstrasse and past
the new synagogue there to re
assure those praying inside that
there will be no repetition of the
crimes of the Nazi period.
As we passed the synagogue we
noticed the arch over the en
trance and a column were of dif
ferent stone. They are all that
remain of the old synagogue de
stroyed under the Nazi regime.
The entiie demonstration had
an atmosphere of calmness and
sincerity and, in our opinion,
showed the genuine determina
tion of the people of West Berlin
to combat any resurgence of dis
crimination.

ST&T Correction
Editor, The Daily:
1 should like to clarify Ihe im
pression that may have been con
veyed in the Jan. 13th issue of
The Daily in the report on my
remarks during the Stanford
Today and Tomorrow program at
Roble the previous evening.
In stating that I outlined the
$182 million expansion program,
the report on to say, "the
money is aimed largely, in terms
of student population, at the
graduate level." This report is
most unfortunate and quite inac
curate, since I made no statement
at all as to how the funds would
ho divided between undergraduate
and graduate programs.
.Moreover, I took considerable
pains to emphasize the fact that
the University is heavily com
mitted to a vigorous strengthen
ing of undergraduate education,
and that a very high priority has
been assigned this task.
Any impression that the $182
million is largely for the graduate
program is quite inaccurate.
