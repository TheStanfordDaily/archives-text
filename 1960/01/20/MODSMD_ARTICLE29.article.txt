APPAREL OFT PROCLAIMS THE MAN
The hounds of spring arc on winter's traces. Soon we will bo
shedding our nuikluks and union suits and putting on our
spring finery. And what does Dame Fashion decree for the com
ing season?
(Dame Fashion, incidentally, is not, as many people believe,
a fictitious character. She was a real Englishwoman who lived
in Klizabetlwn times and, indeed, England is greatly in her debt.
During the invasion of the Spanish Armada, Dame Fashion —
not yet a Dame but a mere, unlettered country lass named
Reeky Sharp—during the invasion, 1 say, of the Spani li
Armada, this dauntless girl stood on the white cliffs of DoAer
and turned (lie tide of battle by rallying the sagging morale of
the British fleet with this stirring poein of her own composition:
Don'l be gutless,
Men of Britain.
Siring nour cutlass,
MY ain't quittin'.
Smash (he Spanish,
Sink their boats,
Make 'em vanish,
Like a horse makes oeits.
For flood Queen Bess,
(loorl sirs, you gotta
Make a mess
Of that A rmada.
You won't fail!
Knock 'em flat!
Then we'll drink ale
A nd stuff like that. / \/

As a reward for these inspirational verses Queen Elizabeth
dubbed ber a Dame, made her poet laureate, and u;alier the
Western I lemispbere except Duluth. But this was not tbe ex
tent of Dame Fashion's services to queen and country. In 1 ">BO
slic invented tbe egg. In !">{)(), alas, she was arrested for poach
ing and imprisoned for thirty years in a butt o! malmsey. '111 is
later became known as Ciny Fawkes Day).
Hut I digress. Let us pet back to spring fashions.
Certain to he popular again lliis year is the cardigan (which,
curiously enough, was named after Lord Cardigan, who com
manded the Knglish fleet against the Spanish Armada. The
sweater is only one product of this fertile Hriton's imagination.
He also invented the ball-peen hammer, the gerund, and the
molar, without, which chewing, as we know it today, would not
be possible).
Hut 1 digress. The cardigan, T say, will he hack, which is
cause fur rejoicing. Why? Hecause the cardigan has nice big
pockets in which to carry your Marlboro Cigarettes—and that,
good buddies, is ample reason for celebration. Do you think
flavor went out when filters came in? If so, you've got another
smoke coming. I mean Marlboros —all the rich, smooth flavor
of prime tobaccos plus a filter that really filters. So slip into
your cardigan and hie yourself to your tobacconist for some
good Marlboros. They come in soft pack or flip-top box. Cardi
gans come in pink for girls and hlue for boys. <• io<wi simim™

If you're a filler smoker, try Marlboros. If you're a non
filler smoker, try Philip Morris. If you're a television nalelier
