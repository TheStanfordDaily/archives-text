# Cougars, Huskies Again Card Hoop Opponents
## Daily Sports 
### 
Stanford's finally rolling bas
ketball team, fresh from a double
win last weekend over the Wash
ington Huskies and the Washing
ton State Cougars, will have a
chance to pull a repeat perform
ance this weekend as the Indians
travel to Washington to meet
both of the northwest teams for
a second time.
Saturday night the Indians will
be in Seattle to play the hard
luck Huskies and will have a
two day rest before facing the
Cougs on Monday night.
Cave In
The Huskies who had lost their
first five league games by a total
of eight points before meeting
Cal last weekend, finally had the
entire roof of Ihe gymnasium
cave in on them at Berkeley
Saturday.
The Golden Bears, hungry to
regain the national title which
they held last ye-ir, chewed the
Husky defense to bits and com
pletely caged the Washington of
fense as the Cal team won 79-39.
This was quite a difference
from the one, two, and three point
losses that the Huskies absorbed
at the hands of UCLA, USC, and
Stanford earlier in the year.
Embarrassing Encounter
The Cal loss besides being such
an embarrassing encounter prac
tically cinched the AAWU cellar
for the Huskies. Their record to
date in league play is now 0-0.
Their nearest competitor for
cellar honors are the Stanford
Indians who are currently at 1-1
in league play.
A defeat at the hands of the
Indians Eriday night would make
it official and John Grayson, in
his first year of coaching at
Washington, would have the dis
tinction ol finishing last in the
first year of AAWU basketball
play.
Owens Lost Some Too
Grayson can be cheered to
know that Jim Owens, new ath
letic director at Washington and
coach of this year's Rose Bowl
winners, had two floundering
seasons before he finally came
into prominence this year.
The ironic part of the Husky
downfall this year is the fact that
the first time in recent Husky

history the Seattle men have
found some sharp shooting
guards.
The Huskies, always tough at
home, may give the Indians a
surprise in Seattle on Saturday.

Without an iota of pressure left
on them they should he consid
erably looser than they were last
! Friday when the Indians over
came an eight point lead late in
I tho game and watched the Husk
i ies choke away their chances.
Same Lineup
The Huskies figure to start vir
tually the same, lineup that took
the floor last Friday with Bill
Hanson, who hit 22 last week
against the Indians a 1 center, Rog
Niva and John Douglas at for
wards, and Clint Names and
George Grant at guards.
The Indians will be in better
j physical shape than they've been
: in since the season opened. Every
! body is in good shape and will be
:at full strength against the
Huskies.
