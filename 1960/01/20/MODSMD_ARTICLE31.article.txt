The Stove Is Warming Up
Unless one watches closely, one might lose sight of the fact
that this really is basketball season.
The "hot stove league" (which, I think, is supposed to be purely
a baseball term but which I will make sort of all-encompassing for
the moment) is at its hottest this winter; and, of course, the Winter
Olympics are close at hand, pressing for the headlines. And in
spite of it all, basketball is enjoying possibly its finest season ever
college and professional.
But before elaborating on this great hoop season, let's digress
to the hot stove league ....
Billy Cannon seems to bo its hottest numbpr, Billy, Louisiana

State's two - time All • American,
Heisman trophy winning half
back, is suddenly sort of a "test
case" as the proposed American
Football League starts whal may
be a long war with the old Na
tional Football League.
Cannon is supposed to have
signed some sort of contract with
the Los Angeles Rams on Nov. SO
of last year (which right there
should have made him ineligible
for the Sugar Bowl); Cannon
definitely did sign a contract with
the Houston Oilers .lan. I, in the
romatic setting of beneath the
Sugar Bowl goalposts (after the
game).
The cast sort of explains itself
right there. As well, the New
York Giants (NFL) and Los An
geles Chargers (AFL) may do
battle over Cannon's .Mississippi
rival, Charley Flowers.
One of San Francisco's redoubt
able columnists confided Monday
that he wouldn't give a thin dime
for either the AFL or the Con-

tinental league, baseball's third "major" league. Now I must say T
go along with him as far as the Continental League is concerned
but the fact that such stars as Cannon, Flowers, Stanford's Chris
Burford and Dan Meredith of Southern Methodist, have already said
they were headed for the AFL indicates that this league will succeed.
For one thing, there is a need for another professional football
league. Generally, you can count on the finders of one hand the num
ber of rookies that make each NFL club. And if the AFL is pulling in
such a branner crop of rookies right now, think what the league will
be in three or four years.
The AFL seems to have copious gobs of money (its strongest
feature right now). If it gets off its feet next fall I see nothing
but success.
Billy Could Start a Flood
If Cannon really did sign a Rains contract, then he may be pro
hibited from keeping his Houston pact, although he says if he plays
professional, it will be with Houston. But if the M'L gets in Ihe.se
disputes too far, it may -suddenly find itself smack in the middle of
anti-trust actions.
Billy Cannon didn't exactly tear up in the Sugar Bowl, but neither
did his LSU team, whose two-line-smashes-and-punt football sort of
gave me an uninspiring New Year's morning. But I won t be one to
contest Billy's ability, for upon three times seeing films of his regular
•season 89-yard punt return that beat Mississippi, I must say that this
was one of the greatest runs in the history of football.
Carried away? Well. LSD was down. 3-0, in that one, in the last
quarter, putting a two-year unbeaten skein on the line. ( annon took
the closing-minute boot, was hit no less than eight times in the first
20 yards by the usually sure-tackling Rebels, and then sped 011 down
the sideline in his 9.5 form and won for LSU what was supposed to be
the "game of the year." A fair clutch performance.
So if the AFL lands the Heisman trophy winner in its first try
(why shouldn't they, offering him $100,000?) the gates may open
and the NFL will, in a few years, have real competition. But. the
league had better find its eighth member pronto, and right now I
can't see Oakland supporting a football franchise any more than I
can see an Oakland baseball team rivaling the Giants.
The Cow Palace Scores
Now, about that great basketball . . . any alert Farm resident can
get right next to it, if lucky.
The Cow Palace, approximately 30 miles north, will house some of
it within a week and a half and
For instance, the NCAA finals are in San Francisco late in March
(right after finals week ). And. in a week and a half Wilt Chamberlain
and his Philadelphia Warriors professional mates will be there.
No doubt about it—the National Basketball Association get tougher
and bigger every year, with the addition of more Chamberlains and
Elgin Baylors (with Oscar Robertson and Jerry West 011 the way for
next year).
This, of course, goes unnoticed by San Francisco's fleet of tele
vision stations. The NBA games-of-the-week are still bypased for
cartoons and old western movies. Anyone enterprising enough can
pick up, through snow and static, the Sunday game via Salinas, or
the Saturday game via Sacramento. Sunday, I barely managed to see
Wilt pour in 43 points against Boston (he's averaging 38). But from
the free throw line, Wilt shot a wretched 5-for-17. Nobody's perfect.
As for collegiate basketball, the four teams that finally make it
to the NCAA finals in March should be dandies. Most likely, they
will be West Virginia, Ohio State, Cincinnati and California (last year's
cast, except for Ohio State). None of these really great powers are
still unbeaten, and the season is less than half over. And at least three
of them claim best-ever teams. As for Cal . . . wait until March.

No doubt about it—the National Basketball Association get tougher
and bigger every year, with the addition of more Chamberlains and
Elgin Baylors (with Oscar Robertson and Jerry West 011 the way for
next year).
This, of course, goes unnoticed by San Francisco's fleet of tele
vision stations. The NBA games-of-the-week are still bypased for
cartoons and old western movies. Anyone enterprising enough can
pick up, through snow and static, the Sunday game via Salinas, or
the Saturday game via Sacramento. Sunday, I barely managed to see
Wilt pour in 43 points against Boston (he's averaging 38). But from
the free throw line, Wilt shot a wretched 5-for-17. Nobody's perfect.
As for collegiate basketball, the four teams that finally make it
to the NCAA finals in March should be dandies. Most likely, they
will be West Virginia, Ohio State, Cincinnati and California (last year's
cast, except for Ohio State). None of these really great powers are
still unbeaten, and the season is less than half over. And at least three
of them claim best-ever teams. As for Cal . . . wait until March.

The Stove Is Warming Up
Unless one watches closely, one might lose sight of the fact
that this really is basketball season.
The "hot stove league" (which, I think, is supposed to be purely
a baseball term but which I will make sort of all-encompassing for
the moment) is at its hottest this winter; and, of course, the Winter
Olympics are close at hand, pressing for the headlines. And in
spite of it all, basketball is enjoying possibly its finest season ever
college and professional.
But before elaborating on this great hoop season, let's digress
to the hot stove league ....
Billy Cannon seems to bo its hottest numbpr, Billy, Louisiana

State's two - time All • American,
Heisman trophy winning half
back, is suddenly sort of a "test
case" as the proposed American
Football League starts whal may
be a long war with the old Na
tional Football League.
Cannon is supposed to have
signed some sort of contract with
the Los Angeles Rams on Nov. SO
of last year (which right there
should have made him ineligible
for the Sugar Bowl); Cannon
definitely did sign a contract with
the Houston Oilers .lan. I, in the
romatic setting of beneath the
Sugar Bowl goalposts (after the
game).
The cast sort of explains itself
right there. As well, the New
York Giants (NFL) and Los An
geles Chargers (AFL) may do
battle over Cannon's .Mississippi
rival, Charley Flowers.
One of San Francisco's redoubt
able columnists confided Monday
that he wouldn't give a thin dime
for either the AFL or the Con-

tinental league, baseball's third "major" league. Now I must say T
go along with him as far as the Continental League is concerned
but the fact that such stars as Cannon, Flowers, Stanford's Chris
Burford and Dan Meredith of Southern Methodist, have already said
they were headed for the AFL indicates that this league will succeed.
For one thing, there is a need for another professional football
league. Generally, you can count on the finders of one hand the num
ber of rookies that make each NFL club. And if the AFL is pulling in
such a branner crop of rookies right now, think what the league will
be in three or four years.
The AFL seems to have copious gobs of money (its strongest
feature right now). If it gets off its feet next fall I see nothing
but success.
Billy Could Start a Flood
If Cannon really did sign a Rains contract, then he may be pro
hibited from keeping his Houston pact, although he says if he plays
professional, it will be with Houston. But if the M'L gets in Ihe.se
disputes too far, it may -suddenly find itself smack in the middle of
anti-trust actions.
Billy Cannon didn't exactly tear up in the Sugar Bowl, but neither
did his LSU team, whose two-line-smashes-and-punt football sort of
gave me an uninspiring New Year's morning. But I won t be one to
contest Billy's ability, for upon three times seeing films of his regular
•season 89-yard punt return that beat Mississippi, I must say that this
was one of the greatest runs in the history of football.
Carried away? Well. LSD was down. 3-0, in that one, in the last
quarter, putting a two-year unbeaten skein on the line. ( annon took
the closing-minute boot, was hit no less than eight times in the first
20 yards by the usually sure-tackling Rebels, and then sped 011 down
the sideline in his 9.5 form and won for LSU what was supposed to be
the "game of the year." A fair clutch performance.
So if the AFL lands the Heisman trophy winner in its first try
(why shouldn't they, offering him $100,000?) the gates may open
and the NFL will, in a few years, have real competition. But. the
league had better find its eighth member pronto, and right now I
can't see Oakland supporting a football franchise any more than I
can see an Oakland baseball team rivaling the Giants.
The Cow Palace Scores
Now, about that great basketball . . . any alert Farm resident can
get right next to it, if lucky.
The Cow Palace, approximately 30 miles north, will house some of
it within a week and a half and
For instance, the NCAA finals are in San Francisco late in March

cartoons and old western movies. Anyone enterprising enough can

the Saturday game via Sacramento. Sunday, I barely managed to see
Wilt pour in 43 points against Boston (he's averaging 38). But from
the free throw line, Wilt shot a wretched 5-for-17. Nobody's perfect.
As for collegiate basketball, the four teams that finally make it
to the NCAA finals in March should be dandies. Most likely, they
will be West Virginia, Ohio State, Cincinnati and California (last year's
cast, except for Ohio State). None of these really great powers are
still unbeaten, and the season is less than half over. And at least three
of them claim best-ever teams. As for Cal . . . wait until March.

Unless one watches closely, one might lose sight of the fact
that this really is basketball season.
The "hot stove league" (which, I think, is supposed to be purely
a baseball term but which I will make sort of all-encompassing for
the moment) is at its hottest this winter; and, of course, the Winter
Olympics are close at hand, pressing for the headlines. And in
spite of it all, basketball is enjoying possibly its finest season ever
college and professional.
But before elaborating on this great hoop season, let's digress
to the hot stove league ....
Billy Cannon seems to bo its hottest numbpr, Billy, Louisiana

State's two - time All • American,
Heisman trophy winning half
back, is suddenly sort of a "test
case" as the proposed American
Football League starts whal may
be a long war with the old Na
tional Football League.
Cannon is supposed to have
signed some sort of contract with
the Los Angeles Rams on Nov. SO
of last year (which right there
should have made him ineligible
for the Sugar Bowl); Cannon
definitely did sign a contract with
the Houston Oilers .lan. I, in the
romatic setting of beneath the
Sugar Bowl goalposts (after the
game).
The cast sort of explains itself
right there. As well, the New
York Giants (NFL) and Los An
geles Chargers (AFL) may do
battle over Cannon's .Mississippi
rival, Charley Flowers.
One of San Francisco's redoubt
able columnists confided Monday
that he wouldn't give a thin dime
for either the AFL or the Con-

tinental league, baseball's third "major" league. Now I must say T
go along with him as far as the Continental League is concerned
but the fact that such stars as Cannon, Flowers, Stanford's Chris
Burford and Dan Meredith of Southern Methodist, have already said
they were headed for the AFL indicates that this league will succeed.
For one thing, there is a need for another professional football
league. Generally, you can count on the finders of one hand the num
ber of rookies that make each NFL club. And if the AFL is pulling in
such a branner crop of rookies right now, think what the league will
be in three or four years.
The AFL seems to have copious gobs of money (its strongest
feature right now). If it gets off its feet next fall I see nothing
but success.
Billy Could Start a Flood
If Cannon really did sign a Rains contract, then he may be pro
hibited from keeping his Houston pact, although he says if he plays
professional, it will be with Houston. But if the M'L gets in Ihe.se
disputes too far, it may -suddenly find itself smack in the middle of
anti-trust actions.
Billy Cannon didn't exactly tear up in the Sugar Bowl, but neither
did his LSU team, whose two-line-smashes-and-punt football sort of
gave me an uninspiring New Year's morning. But I won t be one to
contest Billy's ability, for upon three times seeing films of his regular

was one of the greatest runs in the history of football.
