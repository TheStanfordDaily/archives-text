# SWINGING HAMMER
## 'The City' Target of Chappie; Shake Strongly Before Using 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
The Old BfJy swings his ham
mer again today and live target
is San Francisco.
Some parts of this ambitious
attack show a glimmer of wit;
others smell of the trite come
backs so favorer! by Los Angeles
natives when confronted with the
obvious superiorities of the City.
But considering how many of the
smug smogites are at Stanford,
this, aproach may help Chappie
circulation (which probably needs
help).
Sliake Vigorously
When you purchase your issue,
assuming you make such an
initial mistake, grasp it by the
corner and shake vigorously.
However, don't do this over a
mud puddle, as you will want to
read the insert which flies out.
This bonus is entitled "Herbert
Chicanery's N e w Guide to
'Frisco," and everyone will get a
lot of laughs out of it. The last
laugh will probably go to Herb
and his lawyers.
Luff-Getter
In the magazine proper (or im
proper, as happens now and then!
the first sure-fire, laff-getter is
"This Month in the City," a Jan
uary calendar of ridiculous and
improbable events like I'&B night
al Opus One, featur ing Fats Dom

t ino; Aleatraz Ditch-Day; and
1 Chappie Day.
The suffering reader is next
i edified with a history, or lega.
of San Francisco. This may some
day be required reading in YVest
j ern Civ. Someday. Maybe. This
lis the last chapter in the decline
and fall of history itself.
Odd Scenes
"The Circa t Earthquake," a
photographic essay, put some new
| captions on old scenes. This is
I swiftly followed up with the
Chappie's advice, evidently drawn
from personal experience, on how
to spend the Compleat San Fran
| cisco Evening.
1 thought the funniest part of
this lugubrious tale was when the
Volkswagen burnt out a clutch on
a hill. This may be because 112
; drive a Renault.
But the ending's a real tear
jerker just look for a dry eye
i anywhere when the hero gets his
date in ten hours late and "duti
fully obtains the fifty dozen
I roses."
Well, that's another Chappie.
Those who tastes are for finer
things than the jejune humor
will enjoy the center section, as
usual. And if the Chappie staff
: has been taking payola from the
LA Chamber of Commerce, ol'
Ellington is not surprised.
