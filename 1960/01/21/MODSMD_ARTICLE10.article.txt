# Quad Gate Closed In Safety Effort
## 
### 
The c a mpus bike - pedestrian
battle took a turn in favor of the
pedestrians yesterday with the
announcement that the iron gate
across from the Library will be
closed from 8:15 to 10 this morn
ing.
The action is an experiment
only, and was taken due to num
erous complaints about accidents
and near accidents between pedes
trians and bicyclists at the spot,
which is the south entrance to
the path through the center of
Inner Quad.
Legislature's Committee Invest
igating Bicycle Safety, with per
mission granted by Robert Love
of the Stanford Safety Dept., is
responsible for the move.
The committee said that this
and similar measures may possi
bly become permanent.
