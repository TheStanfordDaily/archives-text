# Ike Foresees $750 Billion Yearly Output
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) President Eisenhower drew a glowing
picture yesterday of a future America — increasingly prosperous,
over flowing with well-being, leaping to a 750-billion-dollar economy
in the decade ahead.
An annual national output of three quarters of a trillion dollars

would be "half again what it is |
today," Eisenhower said, "and j
this performance could be bet- 1
tered if "
Eecau.se of the if, the President |
coupled his predictions with calls
for precautions in his annual eco
nomic report to Congress.
Eisenhower said, too, that con
tinuing efforts must be put forth i
by consumers, labor, management j
and government to fend off infla- :
tion, speculative excesses, and re- i
cessions.
Urged Congress
And. as in his State of the Un- i
ion and budget messages, he once ;
more urged Congress to heed his
advice to balance the budget, put
a hefty $4,200,000,000 surplus in
the Treasury till, and lift the 4'-
per cent lid on interest on long- j
term government bonds.
Then, he said, an expansion in
production, employment and in- j
come business and personal
"will be extended through 1960. ;
And there are good grounds fori
belief that, with appropriate pub-1
lie policies and private actions,
the expansion can continue well
beyond thep resent year."
Wage Boosts
He urged labor and manage
ment to hold wage boosts within
the bounds of productivity boosts
in order to stabilize prices and
check inflation.
The President proposed that "a
well-informed and vigilant public
opinion" ride herd on "attempts
arbitrarily to establish prices or
wages al levels that are inconsist
ent with the general welfare."
He said it would be a grave mis
take to substitute legislation or
controls for the effects of a broad
ened public understanding that
rising wages and prices must be
related to rising productivity.

tered if "
Eecau.se of the if, the President |
coupled his predictions with calls
for precautions in his annual eco
nomic report to Congress.
Eisenhower said, too, that con
tinuing efforts must be put forth i
by consumers, labor, management j
and government to fend off infla- :
tion, speculative excesses, and re- i
cessions.
Urged Congress
And. as in his State of the Un- i
ion and budget messages, he once ;
more urged Congress to heed his
advice to balance the budget, put
a hefty $4,200,000,000 surplus in
the Treasury till, and lift the 4'-
per cent lid on interest on long- j
term government bonds.
Then, he said, an expansion in
production, employment and in- j
come business and personal
"will be extended through 1960. ;
And there are good grounds fori
belief that, with appropriate pub-1
lie policies and private actions,
the expansion can continue well
beyond thep resent year."
Wage Boosts
He urged labor and manage
ment to hold wage boosts within
the bounds of productivity boosts
in order to stabilize prices and
check inflation.
The President proposed that "a
well-informed and vigilant public
opinion" ride herd on "attempts
arbitrarily to establish prices or
wages al levels that are inconsist
ent with the general welfare."
He said it would be a grave mis
take to substitute legislation or
controls for the effects of a broad
ened public understanding that
rising wages and prices must be
related to rising productivity.
