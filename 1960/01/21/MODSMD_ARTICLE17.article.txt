ll' the cause of literarv censorship can find 110 stronger argu
ments on which to stand than those of Mrs. Molly Mimulri, it
might just as well retire.
We suspect that few people would dispute her claim at
Tuesday Series that public tastes in literature should he raised.
()r that ill*' faiiiil\ is the place for taste elevation to begin.
Hut Mrs. Mimulri got herself in hot water everv time she
added that "35 cent trash with its purple passages" should he
banned.
As Professor Merrvman noted, what is one man's sex is another
man's obscenity. Ami who is qualified lo say which is which for
the entire population'<
Though Professor Merryman may have gone ;i hit overboard
in saying that what we need is more pornography, we agree lullv
with his position against am form of censorship.
Banning and censors hip in most cases appear to only heighten
interest and sales of a book hardly conducive lo a rise in general
tastes. In oilier words, il doesn't work.
Contrary lo the apparent opinion of pro-censorship believers,
il is not the case that "35 cent trash " is over in one corner ami
good literature is over in another corner. In terms of pornography,
all literature lulls somewhere on ;i continuum. Mrs. Mimulri was
asked lo locate the censorship point on llic continuum, or to
sav who was qualified to locale the point.
She didn't answer, because she couldn't. Neither can anyone
else sensibly and fairlv give the right answer.
To use positive means to raise public reading tastes is cer
tainly of value. Mill use of censorship not oulv fails in its aim,
bill may also harm pcrfecllv decent literature.
