There is no doubt that this
country is still much richer than
the Soviet Union. It may be,
although no one knows, not any
weaker than the Soviet Union.
But we have fallen behind and
are not holding our own in terms
of national power, in over-all
military capacity, in the competi
tion to pioneer in outer space, in
the comparative rate of economic
growth, and in education, which
is the life-giving principle of na
tional power.
Why has this happened? Why
are we challenged in this way
when, in fact, the Soviet Union
has a gross national product
which is less than half of ours
and a standard of living about
a. third as high as our own?
Why is this richer country
being pressed by a poorer coun
try?
The reason, at bottom, is that
in this period of cold war, the
President has adhered to a prin
ciple which would probably no
longer be suitable even in a time
of total peace.
He has adhered to a principle
which puts private comfort and
private consumption ahead of
national need. The President has
spent his seven years in office
reducing the share of the national
income devoted to public pur
poses.
The challenge of tbe Soviet
Union lias been demanding an
increase, not a reduction, of tbe
share of the national income
devoted to public purposes. VVe
are falling behind in the race
because we are not allowed to
run.
The Soviet economy is growing
at a late which, estimated con
servatively, is 6 per cent per
annum. Our economy has been
growing at a rate of less than
3 per cent.
The Soviet economy is half as
big as ours but it is growing
twice as fast. This means that this
year's increment of increase is
about $12,000,000,000 in the
U.S.S.R. and about $15,000,000,000
in the U.S.A.
But, as this is the crux of the
matter, the U.S.S.R. will use
most, not all, of the $ 12,000,000,-
000 increase for national pur
poses, for armaments, for pro
ductive investment, for foreign
aid, and for national education.
We, on Iho other hand, are
acting on the Eisenhower princi
ple, and are spending a greater
share of our $15,000,000,000 in
crease for private purposes, for
the making of consumer goods
and of the factories and facilities
connected with the making and
use of consumer goods.
That is why the national power
of the Soviet Union is forging
ahead of the national power of the
United States.
I have taken this analysis of

tbe figures from several
sources but chiefly from the
brilliant and notable testimony
before the Joint Committee of
Congress given last autumn by
Prof. W. W. Rostov of the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
The analysis is confirmed by
'the testimony of Mr. Allen W.
! Dulles based on the findings of
! the Central Intelligence Agency.
The concluding paragraph of
Mr. Dulles's statement is one that
!we must all ponder and take to
1 heart. It says,"The major thrust
| of Soviet economic development
and its high technological skills
| and resources are directed to
ward specialized industrial, mili
i tary, and national power goals."
A major thrust of our econ
omy is directed into the produc
tion of the consumer type goods
and services which add little
to the sinews of our national
strength. Hence, neither the size
of our respective gross national
product nor of our respective
industrial production is a true
yardstick of our relative na
tional power positions.
"The uses to which economic
resources are directed largely
determine the measure of na
tional power."
I have emphasized the last
sentence of Mr. Dulles's state
ment because it states, so it seems
to me, the fundamental issue
j which the country must meet.
The President's conlroling
principle —that tbe government
should spend a smaller share
of a growing national income—
lias as its consequence, in this
age of cold war and national
rivalry, that the country will
have a smaller position of in
fluence and power in the world.
I While it may be that the days
of our primacy, which were brief,
are ending, what must not be
allowed to end is our parity with
the greatest powers. For on it
depend many of the dearest hopes
of mankind.
Nobody can say as yet when the
! nation will become aroused to the
i realization that national fluty
1 must take precedence over private
indulgence, that il is not possible
to preserve our society by private
affluence and public complacency.
The voices that will serve
Ibis country, and indeed save
it, will be those ol stern men
demanding hard things. They
may not as yet do well in the
Gallup polls. They will be lis
tened lo sooner or later.
For they will shatter the belief,
now so prevalent among us, that
affluence is greatness. It is not.
In the history of human society
it has not seldom been the case
that when riches were devoted to
luxury it was the mark of their
decline.
