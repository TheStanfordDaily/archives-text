## ONE OPINION 
### 
THERE IS GREAT NEWS.IN
THE LAND!
Since Jan. 4 of this year Ihe
Shmoon are back.
Shmoon, in case you should
be so dumb as oof to know, are
I be plural of Sbmoo, by far tbe
nation's favorite and most
memorable cartoon character.
The creation by A 1 Capp, tbe
Shmoon beat Flyface, Little
Orphan Annie, and just about
every other comic stripper
hands down (but, of course it
has 110 bands).
Capp's new book, on the stands
since Jan. 4, is appropriately en
titled "The Return of the Shmoo."
In its few pages the Shmoon (who
are too good for humanity and
have io be killed) live again, and
return the memories of the happy
era of 1948 when they were born.
Politically, Capp is as sharp
in "The Return . . ." as he was
in the development and later
disposition of the Shmoo back
in '4X. Basically, Shmoon are
bad because they are too good.
They obviate war, strife, any
thing bad.
Shmoon love life, are always
happy, do anything they can for
mankind. If you want Ihem to en
tertain, they're better than TV;
if you're hungry, and look at them
accordingly, they roll over and
die with pleasure.
As must be expected, the
Shmoon are done away with
again, but the $1.00 investment in
the latest Capp fantasy is one
way to keep the little creatures
around a little longer.
Since Daily staff member Ron
Rapoport first pointed out the
latent interest on this campus in
top-notch speakers informally dis
cussing their favorite topics, the
subject has come up a number of
limes.
Stanford's Sigma Nil bouse
yesterday announced a Sunday
Night Speakers program which
lias been in the works since Hie
beginning of the quarter.
The program, under the direc
tion of Hoddy Guittard, includes
four speech-discussions and a
movie program on Japan.
The discussions will last, from
6:30 to 7:30 p.m. Sunday evenings,
and are open to anyone who de
sires to attend. Because of space
limitations, those planning to at
tend are asked to call the house in
advance, however. Approximately
80 people can be accommodated
each night.
This Sunday night Dean of
Humanities and Sciences I'hilip
11. Rhinelander will discuss
"The Intellectual in the Com
munity."
Politicians and politics get the
once-over on Sunday, Jan. 31
when Political Science professor
Robert Horn takes on "The Ele
phant and the Donkey, 1960."
On Feb. 14 a "Journey to the
Moon" will be conducted by Rus
sel Von Eshleman of the Elec
trical Engineering department.
Another journey, this one
"Inside Russia," will be flic
topic on Feb. 21. History profes
sor Anatole Muzour is Hie
speaker.
March 6 is the Japanese Em
press' birthday, and in the spirit

lof the occassion the Sigma Nil's
I will present Japanese exchange
I student Hisao Shinohara and a
movie program on Japan.
Why it took so long for people
to catch onto these speakers pro
grams is probably unexplainable,
J but the fever has caught on, and
I some of the most worthwhile out
side activities on anybody's social
calendar have come out of it.
The Sigma Nil program looks
good, and should lie well worth
missing part of the Sunday
night flicks for, if not passing
them up all together . . . no
offense meant to the Flicks
Mgr.

Stanford's Sigma Nil bouse
yesterday announced a Sunday
Night Speakers program which
lias been in the works since Hie
beginning of the quarter.
The program, under the direc
tion of Hoddy Guittard, includes
four speech-discussions and a
movie program on Japan.
The discussions will last, from
6:30 to 7:30 p.m. Sunday evenings,
and are open to anyone who de
sires to attend. Because of space
limitations, those planning to at
tend are asked to call the house in
advance, however. Approximately
80 people can be accommodated
each night.
This Sunday night Dean of
Humanities and Sciences I'hilip
11. Rhinelander will discuss
"The Intellectual in the Com
munity."
Politicians and politics get the
once-over on Sunday, Jan. 31
when Political Science professor
Robert Horn takes on "The Ele
phant and the Donkey, 1960."
On Feb. 14 a "Journey to the
Moon" will be conducted by Rus
sel Von Eshleman of the Elec
trical Engineering department.
Another journey, this one
"Inside Russia," will be flic
topic on Feb. 21. History profes
sor Anatole Muzour is Hie
speaker.
March 6 is the Japanese Em
press' birthday, and in the spirit

lof the occassion the Sigma Nil's
I will present Japanese exchange
I student Hisao Shinohara and a
movie program on Japan.
Why it took so long for people
to catch onto these speakers pro
grams is probably unexplainable,
J but the fever has caught on, and
I some of the most worthwhile out
side activities on anybody's social
calendar have come out of it.
The Sigma Nil program looks
good, and should lie well worth
missing part of the Sunday
night flicks for, if not passing
them up all together . . . no
offense meant to the Flicks
Mgr.

Since Jan. 4 of this year Ihe
Shmoon are back.
Shmoon, in case you should
be so dumb as oof to know, are
I be plural of Sbmoo, by far tbe
nation's favorite and most
memorable cartoon character.
The creation by A 1 Capp, tbe
Shmoon beat Flyface, Little
Orphan Annie, and just about
every other comic stripper
hands down (but, of course it
has 110 bands).
Capp's new book, on the stands
since Jan. 4, is appropriately en
titled "The Return of the Shmoo."
In its few pages the Shmoon (who
are too good for humanity and
have io be killed) live again, and
return the memories of the happy
era of 1948 when they were born.
Politically, Capp is as sharp
in "The Return . . ." as he was
in the development and later
disposition of the Shmoo back
in '4X. Basically, Shmoon are
bad because they are too good.
They obviate war, strife, any
thing bad.
Shmoon love life, are always
happy, do anything they can for
mankind. If you want Ihem to en
tertain, they're better than TV;
if you're hungry, and look at them
accordingly, they roll over and
die with pleasure.
As must be expected, the
Shmoon are done away with
again, but the $1.00 investment in
the latest Capp fantasy is one
way to keep the little creatures
around a little longer.

Why it took so long for people
to catch onto these speakers pro
grams is probably unexplainable,
J but the fever has caught on, and
I some of the most worthwhile out
side activities on anybody's social
calendar have come out of it.
The Sigma Nil program looks
good, and should lie well worth
missing part of the Sunday
night flicks for, if not passing
them up all together . . . no
offense meant to the Flicks
Mgr.
