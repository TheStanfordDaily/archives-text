No Incrimination
Editor, The Daily:
J have carefully studied Iho
argument advanced in David
Caldwell's letter of Jan. 13
(Wednesday). I disagree with the
conclusion that David's three
friends resent the Honor Code

pledge as contrary to the Fifth
Amendment.
My inference, likewise nnprov
en, is that they believe that sign
ing the pledge "I have observed
the Honor Code" will not incrim
inate them.
Terry Rents
