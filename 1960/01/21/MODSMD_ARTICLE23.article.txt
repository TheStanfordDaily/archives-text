Would You Believe ll?
From looking at ihe records of this year's Stanford football and
basketball teams, one would hardly suspect that this year's senior
class had one of the most successful freshman athletic years that
any class at Stanford could boast of.
The class of '60 had an undefeated freshman football team, a
basketball team which concluded the season with a 14-3 record, and
a baseball team which also had a very formidable record.
What happened to suddenly turn these highly -successful fresh
men athletes into losers as seniors? Frankly, thÂ° problem is one
which has beset many classes at Stanford the players who started
as freshmen are simply no longer at Stanford, or if they are some
thing has prevented their continuing to participate in varsity sports.
Some find the academic grind too difficult to cope with, others

who are married find that mar
ried life and school are incom
patible and, therefore, drop out of
school to support a family, and
still others run into physical dis
abilities which prevent their con
tinuing.
The freshmen football team of
1956 mauled over what were sup
posed to be good teams from IJSC
and Cal by the scores of 36-13
and 33-13 respectively. In the
use game Stanford's freshmen
rolled up over 500 yards as the
I'apoose line completely over
powered t heir Trobabe opponents.
What has happened to the stars
of that line?
The personnel of the line con
sisted of Chris Burfonl and Jerry
Winters at ends, Ron Fernandes
and John Luke at tackles, Kay
Harrington and Neil Langhlin at
guards, and Harlan Liminer and
Kill Stivers split the center chores.
Of these eight men only two
played on last year's varsity.

The two who competed were
Chris Bnrford who got All-American recognition and Ron Fernandes
who, after battling knee trouble for awhile, was shiJted to guai d
where he performed ably.
Of the others only Winter, Limmer, and Stivers are still at
Stanford. Winters, who throws the shot for the track team, was
moved to tackle in his sophomore year and earned his letter doing
a great job. Since that time, however, Winters has not played foot
ball. Rumors have it that he may try to make a comeback next
season.
Limmer and Stivers both had a series of concussions which caused
them to give up football or risk serious damage 1<> their health.
Limmer still competes at Stanford in athletics as a discus thrower
on the track team. Stivers helped coach last year's Stanford fresh
man football team.
Slill in Local Area
Of those who are no longer at Stanford all are still in the local
area. Laughlin who has grade and financial problems, starred on
last year's undefeated San Francisco State team.
Harrington, like Stivers and Limmer, had concussion troubles
and had to give the game up. Being married with two children, a
Stanford education became too expensive for Harrington and he now
is at San Jose State where he is football manager. Lately Rays
athletic activities have been restricted to chasing thiefs in liquor
stores. Last month the ex-Stanford ace went in pursuit ol a thief
who had robbed an Last Palo Alto liquor store. Just as the fireplug
ex-guard was set to throw a tackle on the robber the thief pulled a
gun and Harrington beat a hasty retreat.
John Luke flirted with the idea of attending UCLA for awhile
but is now living wih his wife in Menlo Park. He hopes 1o return
to Stanford next year but his football days are over.
The backfield of that squad wasn't hit as hard as the line but
the one superstar of the team's backs left Stanford and is now play
ing football at the Naval Academy. Jim Honeywell, the team s lead
ing rusher, decided on a naval career after two years at Stanford. He
averaged over 8 yards a carry in that smashing defeat of USC. Last
year Honeywell played behind Joe Belli no and did an adequate job
when he played.
The rest of the first string backfield of the 19.16 freshman team
were all members of last year's varsity. Mac Wylie was called bv
Coach Jack Curtice his best all around back and Dick Bowers held
down a first string job. Quarterback Sid Garber was shifted to full
back where he finished out his football career.
The Lyle Gross Case
Perhaps the most ironic case involved in that team was the case
of Lyle Gross. Gross, a 240 pound monster tackle, stayed at Stanford
one day and then decided he couldn't support his two children and
wife and still play football at Stanford.
The basketball team that year also has some faces that are no
longer around anymore. Ken Balling-, a 200 pound, 6-3, guard is no
longer at Stanford. Dean Prince the preseason star of the team lasted
two games and never could survive scholastic-ally after that.
Baseball was also hard hit by the disappearance of ace fresh
men from the class of 1960. Steve Watson a hard-throwing pitcher
was signed as a freshman by Cincinnati and never saw varsity action.
Ed Seda, a slugging infielder, left Stanford after a quarter and even
tually was signed by Pittsburgh out of San Diego State. Dick Wil
liams, a sensational outfielder and pitcher, saw a year's varsity action
and found studies too tough.
