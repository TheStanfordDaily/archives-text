# Cards Have Big Chance To Win 2, Break Even
## 
### 
A double win over Washington
and Washington State this week
end by the Stanford basketball
team would push the sometimes
hot, sometimes cold, Indians
above the .500 mark for the first
time since early in December.
The Cards record now stands at
six wins and seven losses.
After first colliding with the
Washington Huskies on Saturday
night the Indians get a day's rest
and then move to Pullman, Wash
ington, where they will meet the
Washington State Cougs on Mon
day night.
The Cougars started the 1959-
6(1 basketball season like a herd
of wild horses running opponents
into the ground and rolling up
scores in the eighties and nineties
on occasions. However, their scor
ing prowess didn't come to light
too brightly in their tour of Ihe
Bay Area last weekend. Against
Cal the Cougs were checked with
only 43 points as they lost 54-43.
The following night the Cougs
could manage only 14 points in
the first half and finally went
down to defeat at the hands of
Stanford, 57-44.
The main reason why the Cougs
attack was stalled last weekend
was that they were not able to
control the boards as they had
been able to do in the past. Center
John Maras who has an easy time
off the boards on occasions was
put under wraps by Cal's Darrall
Imhoff and Stanford's Neal
Brockmeyer-John Windsor com
bination.

If Jim Hepton, Washington
State's number one outside shot,
can walk next Monday night, the
Cougs stand a good chance of
breaking up the Cards defense
with a little outside shooting.
Last week Hepton saw about a
minute's action, but was taken
out when it became apparent a
badly bruised knee kept the
speedy guard down to a slow
j limp.
A combination of Hepton and
the hot handed Terry Ball (Ball
! had 14 against Stanford last Sat
urday) might be able to pull the

Stanford defense out from around
center Maras.
Nick August, two hand shooting
hustling guard, could also pose
a threat from the outside.
The Coug lineup should have a
few minor changes in it from last
weekend. Maras will go at center
with Charlie Sells and Frank
Reed at forwards with Terry Ball
and Nick August at guards.

6(1 basketball season like a herd
of wild horses running opponents
into the ground and rolling up
scores in the eighties and nineties
on occasions. However, their scor
ing prowess didn't come to light
too brightly in their tour of Ihe
Bay Area last weekend. Against
Cal the Cougs were checked with
only 43 points as they lost 54-43.
The following night the Cougs
could manage only 14 points in
the first half and finally went
down to defeat at the hands of
Stanford, 57-44.
The main reason why the Cougs
attack was stalled last weekend
was that they were not able to
control the boards as they had
been able to do in the past. Center
John Maras who has an easy time
off the boards on occasions was
put under wraps by Cal's Darrall
Imhoff and Stanford's Neal
Brockmeyer-John Windsor com
bination.

If Jim Hepton, Washington
State's number one outside shot,
can walk next Monday night, the
Cougs stand a good chance of
breaking up the Cards defense
with a little outside shooting.
Last week Hepton saw about a
minute's action, but was taken
out when it became apparent a
badly bruised knee kept the
speedy guard down to a slow
j limp.
A combination of Hepton and
the hot handed Terry Ball (Ball
! had 14 against Stanford last Sat
urday) might be able to pull the

Stanford defense out from around
center Maras.
Nick August, two hand shooting
hustling guard, could also pose
a threat from the outside.
The Coug lineup should have a
few minor changes in it from last
weekend. Maras will go at center
with Charlie Sells and Frank
Reed at forwards with Terry Ball
and Nick August at guards.

A double win over Washington
and Washington State this week
end by the Stanford basketball
team would push the sometimes
hot, sometimes cold, Indians
above the .500 mark for the first
time since early in December.
The Cards record now stands at
six wins and seven losses.
After first colliding with the
Washington Huskies on Saturday
night the Indians get a day's rest
and then move to Pullman, Wash
ington, where they will meet the
Washington State Cougs on Mon
day night.
