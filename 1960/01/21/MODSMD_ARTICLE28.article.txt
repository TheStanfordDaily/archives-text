# Basilio's Mad
## 
### 
SYRACUSE. N.Y. </P) Car
men Basilio yesterday called Na
tional Boxing Association leaders
"self-appointed phonies" for mov
ing to wipe out his proposed wel
terweight title bout with cham
pion Don Jordan.
Basilio. believed through with
fighting as a middleweight, said
he thinks he deserves a crack at
Jordan's crown on his past record.
So does Syracuse promoter Nor
man Rothschild, who hopes to
stage the bout here June 10.
