# Speakers Say: Costs Will Rise
## 
### 
Stanford students can expect an increase in room and board
bills in the fall of 1961, following a probable announcement of such
this fall, Dean of Men William Craig told a Stanford Today and
Tomorrow audience at the Theta Delta Chi house last night.
It thus appears probable that the autumn quarter of 1961 will
——— sec a hike in tuition, room and

j board fees. ST&T speakers last
week predicted a tuition boost in
the very near future, probably in
1961.
The long-awaited bookstore will
open this spring, if all goes well,
mathematics professor Harold
j Bacon said to his Los Areos
listeners.
Book •Supermarket'
He described it as a "super
market" of literature with open
shelves and self-service. The old
j bookstore won't be razed or
abandoned, and there is a possi
bility it may be the next home of
; the Western Civ library.
Bacon also pointed out plans to
j build more married student hous
ing. Other most-likely construc
tion to come, according to all of
| the ST&T speakers, will include
theTresidder Union, a top-priority
; undergraduate library and a phys
ics building.
The undergrad library is in
tended to end the problems of the
j RBR, since it will be organized on
: the open stack plan.
Dean of Students H. Donald
: Winbigler, speaking at El Tigre,
; predicted many special fringe
benefits for faculty members.
Smart Students
Also noting the "more intel
i leetual type of person" now being
attracted to Stanford, Winbigler
; quoted some sobering college apti
tude test scores.
In 1954, for instance, men got
| a 77 on the math part; in 1939,
i they scored a 91 percentile. Worn
men went from 50 to 84 percentile
in the same period.
Men's verbal scores rose from
157 to 84, and women's from 72
j to 89 on the tests during the five
i years.
