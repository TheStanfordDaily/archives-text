# New Poetry Has Message, Need, Says Spiegelberg
## 
### Daryl Glenney 
"So-called Beatniks today are conducting a tremendous search
for new meanings in life because ihe old meanings have been watered
down," Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg of the Asian Languages Depart
ment told his audience in Toyon Lounge last night. "You can't put
new wine in old barrels; thus, the need for a new type of poetry

to express this search.'
An authority on modern poetry,
Dr. Spiegelberg initiated the
Breakers' Speakers Program with
a discussion of "Metaphysical Im
plications of Present Day Neo-
Existentialist Poetry."
The term "Boat" is actually a
misnomer, a journalistic attempt
at sensationalism to identify the
new writers' movement with out
casts of society, he contended.

"I prefer i<» call them Neo-Ex
istenialists." lie said, "because,
while still more interested in
1 existence itself than in any aspect
of existence, they do not reflect
the hopeless despair of the Ex
! istentialists of 20 years ago."
It is always those who break
away that produce great things,
said Spiegelberg in citing Jesus of
Nazcreth, reformists of the Mid
dle Ages, and Bohemians as
others who have achieved success
through protesting. "Neo-Existen
tialists are protesting against
the demand to conform to aver
age standards which keep man
nailed down," he said.
The civilization to which we
must conform, continued Spiegel
berg, emphasizes materialism, ra
tionalism, and smug intellect ual
ism. "Worst of all," he said, "is
the pattern of behavior which
doesn't admit emotion. This
makes all other literary expres
sions outdated.
"This modern poetry faces the
problem of existence as a whole—
I Why are we here? Where are we
from? Where are we going?"
Spiegelberg explained. Although
iit expresses a great deal of
nostalgia and dissatisfaction, we
I find actual theology, great emo
| tion, and unexpected humor in
! the poetry, he added.
"Although English literature
critics may not find the poetry of
this movement good literature,"
; Spiegelberg concluded, "it has a
1 message and it has a need."

for new meanings in life because ihe old meanings have been watered
down," Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg of the Asian Languages Depart
ment told his audience in Toyon Lounge last night. "You can't put
new wine in old barrels; thus, the need for a new type of poetry

to express this search.'
An authority on modern poetry,
Dr. Spiegelberg initiated the
Breakers' Speakers Program with
a discussion of "Metaphysical Im
plications of Present Day Neo-
Existentialist Poetry."
The term "Boat" is actually a
misnomer, a journalistic attempt
at sensationalism to identify the
new writers' movement with out
casts of society, he contended.

"I prefer i<» call them Neo-Ex
istenialists." lie said, "because,
while still more interested in
1 existence itself than in any aspect
of existence, they do not reflect
the hopeless despair of the Ex
! istentialists of 20 years ago."
It is always those who break
away that produce great things,
said Spiegelberg in citing Jesus of
Nazcreth, reformists of the Mid
dle Ages, and Bohemians as
others who have achieved success
through protesting. "Neo-Existen
tialists are protesting against
the demand to conform to aver
age standards which keep man
nailed down," he said.
The civilization to which we
must conform, continued Spiegel
berg, emphasizes materialism, ra
tionalism, and smug intellect ual
ism. "Worst of all," he said, "is
the pattern of behavior which
doesn't admit emotion. This
makes all other literary expres
sions outdated.
"This modern poetry faces the
problem of existence as a whole—
I Why are we here? Where are we
from? Where are we going?"
Spiegelberg explained. Although
iit expresses a great deal of
nostalgia and dissatisfaction, we
I find actual theology, great emo
| tion, and unexpected humor in
! the poetry, he added.
"Although English literature
critics may not find the poetry of
this movement good literature,"
; Spiegelberg concluded, "it has a
1 message and it has a need."
