SIX EASY LISTENS WITH CAPITOL RLCORDS
HERE 8:07 PM There aren't enough ashtrays. Put out a few more and put
AY^ATNT' on l ' ie ncw a '^ um by the Kingston Trio; it should help things get
fib * , under way without too much trouble. Introduce people. Genially slap
. %>' / a few backs when the banjos in A Worried Man get going. Grin con
tagiously at the whimsical Unfortunate Miss Bailey. One thing: He
H careful with San Miguel. It's a bit sad and, this early, could depress
shyer guests if they're not distracted while it's playing.
a winter 8:44 PM Start the Dean Martin. Tentative dancing should begin
Dean now. Smile at late arrivals. The songs, with chorus,
H* Martin# & are cheerful, easy-going, mostly sentimental. Canadian Sunset is up
tempo, diverting. Ones like Baby, It's (. 'okl Outside and I've Got My
*' _ #• '• ]|jfv : ' : Love To Keep Me Warm tend to stimulate general sociability and
■ cheer. Dean's mellow voice suggests a certain glow, too.
9:30 PM Serious dancing gets under way. I \tremely hard, short of
5 " demolishing the phonograph, to go wrong with this album. Glen Gray
and 1960 stars like Pete Candoli, Plas Johnson and Nick I-a tool have
re-created, in the presence of Capitol's world-of-tomorrow recording
fag** equipment, swing classics of the '40's. Very true to the originals, more
or less IN: Kenton's Intermission Rill. Herman's Apple Honey,
■jf&|SL T. Dorsey's Opus Aa. /.nine morc.(lfyeu do demolish the phonograph,
remove glass tubes first.)

3|Wf|h || 10:44 PM Very danccable. The party has been going on for some
time and it may be well to turn down some lights to conserve power.
WgmimZmM Hear what the Shearing Quintet's latin tempos can do for home
grown standards like All Or frothing At All. Dearly Beloved and It's
II Cosy To Remember. Then there's Afro §4. Mambo Balahu and things
that are supposed to sound that way. Be considerate; this is the time
J- 1 IE when guests will wish to strengthen friendships, consolidate social
ij| gains. After all, they're only human.
11:30 P\l Play a couple of the Glen Grays again, then put on the
J|Pjj||!Gleason. If there arc older chaperons, they will probably be growing
tired and will appreciate being shown to a quiet room where they can
Wjjf read. The Gleason album should be well received. It employs two
orchestras (strings and btass), is curiously pleasant, and contains
JACKII OlfASufl highly romantic Gleason originals plus ballads you know like She's
• ( I■/! Tunny That Way and Yesterdays. The meaning of the album title
(a French phrase) is obscure. Good luck.
