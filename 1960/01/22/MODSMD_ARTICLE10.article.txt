## 
### 
OMAHA, Neb. (/P) —- Son. John F. Kennedy (D-Mass.) announced yesterday he will enter the March
S Nebraska presidential preference primary.
He flew here to make the announcement only a few hours after disclosing in Milwaukee his de
cision to stake his presidential - hopes on an admittedly hazardous battle with Sen. Hubert H. Hum
phrey (D-Minn.) in the Wisconsin Democratic prrimary.
The Nebraska primary, unlike the April 5 test in Wisconsin, is a popularity contest only. There-

sults are not binding on Nebras
ka's 1G Democratic convention
delegates.
Humphrey Undecided
Humphrey has visited Nebras
ka twice in recent months but re
mained undecided about entering
the primary. The Minnosotan ex
pressed doubts he v/ill have the
financial or physical resources to
compete both in Wisconsin and
Nebraska.
Kennedy is the first of either
party to enter the Nebraska pri
mary.
Kennedy, in making his an
ouncement he would enter the
Wisconsin primary, agreed to
! stake his presidential hopes on an
admittedly "hazardous" b a 111 e
with Sen. Humphrey.

gage in what ho called "a very
tough fight" indicated he hopes

| vention floor in July.
"1 am fully aware of the risks
and difficulties thi; course in
; volves." Kennedy told a news con
ference announcing his entry into

I Wisconsin primary will have a de-
I cisive effect — the winner will
! have an extremely strong position
Sat the convention, and deservedly
•so."
Johnson llopelu)
Kennedy said he regards John
i son as his principal adversary at
! presnt. Ho based this, he said,
jon reports that the Democratic
j floorleader in the Senate has con-
I trol of some 400-odd convention
j votes.
The boyish-appearing, 12-year
! old junior senator from Massa
chusetts took a slap at Johnson
and other presidential hopefuls in
his party.
"Even though my chief compet
itors in the convention remain
safely on the sidelines, hoping to
gain the nomination through ma
nipulation of .the convention, 1
cannot follow the advice of those
urging mo not to enter this or
other representative primaries,"
