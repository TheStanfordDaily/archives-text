Stanford seniors Infill a unique annual project Monday when
solicitations for the Heritage Fund gel underway.
\ arious colleges and universities around I lie nation earn on
fiift programs whereby graduating classes donate funds to the
school. Hut Stanford's Heritage Fund is the only program known
whereby the graduating class solicits and then donates monc)
for the express purpose of furnishing scholarships to other stu
dents already at Stanford.
Heritage Fund this year hopes to raise more tlum $17,000
enough for 17 one-year scholarships.
Faeli of these scholarships is given in I lie name of the busi
nessman or merchant who has given the money to Heritage
Fund. Values received from these scholarships have in some
cases gone beyond merely the \ear's free Initio*.
Perhaps the greatest added benefits were received hv one
student who became quite familiar with his donor, and was sub
sequently put through business school by him.
In times of rising costs, it becomes ever more important to
make available scholarship funds for qualified students. We
salute Heritage Fund for its work, and wish it success in exceed
ing its goals next week.
