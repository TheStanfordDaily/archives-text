Campus pedestrians ami general safet\ stuck a fool in the
door of the bike problem yesterday when one entrance to quad
was experimentally elosed to hike traffic. Such a limited test
cannot be expected to yield conclusive results, hut the comments
we heard from numerous students indicated their pleasure at the
move.
Vie have no objection to bikes—but we believe they should
be restricted to the outer side of quad, and should be provided
with adequate parking facilities throughout the points of campus
where they are used.
One further word to cyclists: we know von like to keep vour
bikes dry, but bear in mind that Ihe arcades of quad are intended
for foot traffic, not as a parking place for hikes. On rains days,
the point has been reached where parked hikes often leave onlv
a single lane for pedestrians near the math and journalism depart
ments —and sometimes there's a bike coming down that one
lane, as well.
