Look into A-V Aids
Editor, The Daily:
That Audio-Visual Aids depart
ment over at Cubberley really
ought to be looked inlo. Last
week they stepped on a few toes,
but this week they've gone too
far.
I'm not referring to the "Inspire
to Inquire" display; I don't un
derstand that one. Bui (he other
board presents a menace to the
whole American way of life. If
you haven't seen it, then you'll
know what I mean when I tell
you that its purpose is stated in
these three slogans: "Don't Con
fuse the Issue," "Come to the
Point," and "Be Precise."
Such rank heresy obviously
undercuts our most cherished in
stitutions. What would happen if
Congress was forced to behave
as these radical educators pro
pose ?
The display is clearly timed to
disparage and degrade political
democracy.
This is the beginning of a presi
dential election year, yet these
subversive old school teachers
would make the entire campaign
a farce by advocating precision,
which, as anyone knows, is about
the least likely way to win an
election there is.
I hope that this small group of
educators who have more power
(over display area) than sense,
will stop their attempt at remak
ing our blessed country and will
devote their time and energies to
glorifying the American heritage.
Their display is in bad taste, if
nothing worse, and I hope they
will take it down without delay.

This is my fourth year at the
University, but until now I have
had no contact with the Chemistry
Department whatever, although I
am concerned about the quality
of instruction and research in ihe
sciences at Stanford.
I had occasion to enter the
Chemistry building for the first
time Ihe other day, and I sincere
ly feel that this dilapidated struc
ture constitutes a disgrace to the
University. If the powers-that-be
arp so interested in spending
money to improve Stanford's
buildings and facilities, why don't
they do somthing about this eye
sore?

I hope that this small group of
educators who have more power
(over display area) than sense,
will stop their attempt at remak
ing our blessed country and will
devote their time and energies to
glorifying the American heritage.
Their display is in bad taste, if
nothing worse, and I hope they
will take it down without delay.

This is my fourth year at the
University, but until now I have
had no contact with the Chemistry
Department whatever, although I
am concerned about the quality
of instruction and research in ihe
sciences at Stanford.
I had occasion to enter the
Chemistry building for the first
time Ihe other day, and I sincere
ly feel that this dilapidated struc
ture constitutes a disgrace to the
University. If the powers-that-be
arp so interested in spending
money to improve Stanford's
buildings and facilities, why don't
they do somthing about this eye
sore?

Look into A-V Aids
Editor, The Daily:
That Audio-Visual Aids depart
ment over at Cubberley really
ought to be looked inlo. Last
week they stepped on a few toes,
but this week they've gone too
far.
I'm not referring to the "Inspire
to Inquire" display; I don't un
derstand that one. Bui (he other
board presents a menace to the
whole American way of life. If
you haven't seen it, then you'll
know what I mean when I tell
you that its purpose is stated in
these three slogans: "Don't Con
fuse the Issue," "Come to the
Point," and "Be Precise."
Such rank heresy obviously
undercuts our most cherished in
stitutions. What would happen if
Congress was forced to behave
as these radical educators pro
pose ?
The display is clearly timed to
disparage and degrade political
democracy.
This is the beginning of a presi
dential election year, yet these
subversive old school teachers
would make the entire campaign
a farce by advocating precision,
which, as anyone knows, is about
the least likely way to win an
election there is.
