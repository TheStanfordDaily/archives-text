What comes out in Audio-Visual
bulletin boards at Stanford comes
out in enraged letters to the editor
and editorial comment elsewhere.
The San Jose Spartan:
"The swastika bandwagon was
too much for somebody, who had
to get out the paintbrush and
dress up some public property
with the Nazi symbol.
"It's too had. ( aught in the
right mood you can smile at
.... other fads. But there's
nothing funny about Hitler's
Nazism or its symbol."
A letter to the editor of the
Cornell Daily Sun looked to Germ
any. "Six years ago a British
government survey showed that
between 38 to 50 per cent of adult
Germans were willing to articu
late anti-Semitic sentiments . . .
The people . . . have never and do
not now accept the guilt and re
sponsibility for the offenses and
atrocities of Nazism . . .
. . The Nuremberg trials
had (he unfortunate effect . . .
of convincing many Germans
that since a few leaders hud
atoned for their crimes, the
people could go free of guilt. . ..
"The Adenauer government has
made some attempts, in part sin
cere, to atone for' German guilt.
Occasionally there have been pros
ecutions of neo-Nazi movements.
And reparations have been paid
to Israel ....
"... If the Adenauer cabinet
were really concerned with stop
ping anti-Semitism, i' would take
firm steps to make those changes
in the German educational sys
tem, and especially in the teach
ing of 20th century history, which
would revive the process of denaz
ification. A planned program to
similarly re-educate adults, by
means of the mass media, is also
urgently needed . .
A writer in the Michigan
Daily turned his eye on Jews in
America.
. . The Jews themselves
[must] realize that they may
consciously or unconsciously
provoke ill will by many things
they do or say.
"The biggest area of conflict is
I the concept of a 'Jewish Commun
ity' existing in this country . . . .
Jews tend to isolate themselves
in certain areas of cities they
live in. . . .
"Large numbers of Jews in this
country will refuse to mix socially
with non-Jews; country clubs of

one ethnic orientation are a most
pronounced example.
"Jewish parents will prevent
their children from having so
cial contacts with those of an
other religion. Besides request
ing roommates of the same re
ligion. men and women later
consolidate into predominantly
Jewish fraternities and sorori
ties. . . .
Adherence to religion fand cul
ture) requires a certain separa
tion from live gentile community.
To maintain the religion and pie
vent assimilation, the Jew must
consolidate and resist cultural in
doctrination. . . .
"It must be recognized that
Jews sustain group practices
which antagonize the rest of the
community."
This column brought a huge
onslaught of letters attacking the
writer vigorously.
". . . For the Jews to . . . re
nounce their ethnic-cultural ident
ity (impossible anyway) . . .
would be to deny . . . much to
which the Jews hold to so tenaci
ously that they have submitted
to their own slaughter rather
than renuonce that identity . . ."
"In the confines of the ghet
tos grew up a cultural heritage
which lias long made important
contributions to many societies.
Now this cultural and ethnic in
tegrity is probably the most im
portant force that preserved the
Jewish people at all . . ."
"Jews have been denied the
application of democracy to its
fullest and complete extent. Many
medical schools in the United
States still impose on qualified
Jewish applicants the restriction
based on the per cent of Jews in
ihe general population. In many
localities Jews are restricted from
living in certain places. And as
for Jewish fraternities and sorori
ties, these arose as a consequence
to the non-admittance of Jews to
ihe already established 'fraterni
ties.' "
"Certainly we can do away
with strife between Jews and
Gentiles by simply doing away
with the differences that exist
between Jew and Gentile . . .
and thus effectively do away
with Jews. It has been my un
derstanding, however, that it is
the Jew's right to conduct him
self differently from Gentiles,
or in any other reasonable way,
that the United States has long
fought to protect."
