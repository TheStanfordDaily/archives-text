Nice Going, Pete
Editor, The Daily:
May I be allowed to thank you
| for your inclusion into Friday's
Daily of another genuinely mov
ing letter by Peter Ericksen. May
we proudly acknowledge thaV
| Peter Ericksen, I he campus's
1 most perceptive political wit, has
I successfully knitted together once
again a typically relevant and
uniquely lucid commentary on a
| campus issue.
j My! But it did this old heart
good to sec, amid the apathy of
this campus, an expression such
as this, of true white and blue
! traditional enlightened Ameri-
I can ism!
But. I must admit to having
j been just a little bit bothered by
| Peter's suggestion. Peter, my boy,
! as a worlds to conquer (in the
name of democracy, of course),
■ bright-eyed (although downcast
I to best choose the more well

worn path), young (old school),
conservative, you just can't really
ho serious in proposing (even in
jest) a .national SOCIALISTIC
movement as an answer to any
thing!
By gosh, that might bo counter
to the western tradition (shud
der) and what's worse, this chap
Wertheim ootald by chance not be
of the Arian-White-Protestant
Übermenxch (Ericksen) stuff to
rale it.
No, Peter. If us is to continue
in the goode olde conservative
tradition we must flush these dis
gusting radical concepts out of
our thoughts and actions (in puh
lie at least) and concentrate our
efforts on more useful (safer)
pursuits such as letting people in
on the real truth about the red
influence in the Democratic party
or the agnostic influences in
Stanford's Western Civ program.
Gosh, Peter, who can tell but
with a little effort you might
really succeed in becoming the
only man on campus (since Wil
moore Kendall's departure) to suc
cessfully develop Wilmoore Ken
da il as an ego ideal.

No, Peter. If us is to continue
in the goode olde conservative
tradition we must flush these dis
gusting radical concepts out of
our thoughts and actions (in puh
lie at least) and concentrate our
efforts on more useful (safer)
pursuits such as letting people in
on the real truth about the red
influence in the Democratic party
or the agnostic influences in
Stanford's Western Civ program.
Gosh, Peter, who can tell but
with a little effort you might
really succeed in becoming the
only man on campus (since Wil
moore Kendall's departure) to suc
cessfully develop Wilmoore Ken
da il as an ego ideal.

Nice Going, Pete
Editor, The Daily:
May I be allowed to thank you
| for your inclusion into Friday's
Daily of another genuinely mov
ing letter by Peter Ericksen. May
we proudly acknowledge thaV
| Peter Ericksen, I he campus's
1 most perceptive political wit, has
I successfully knitted together once
again a typically relevant and
uniquely lucid commentary on a
| campus issue.
j My! But it did this old heart
good to sec, amid the apathy of
this campus, an expression such
as this, of true white and blue
! traditional enlightened Ameri-
I can ism!
But. I must admit to having
j been just a little bit bothered by
| Peter's suggestion. Peter, my boy,
! as a worlds to conquer (in the
name of democracy, of course),
■ bright-eyed (although downcast
I to best choose the more well

worn path), young (old school),
conservative, you just can't really
ho serious in proposing (even in
jest) a .national SOCIALISTIC
movement as an answer to any
thing!
By gosh, that might bo counter
to the western tradition (shud
der) and what's worse, this chap
Wertheim ootald by chance not be
of the Arian-White-Protestant
Übermenxch (Ericksen) stuff to
rale it.
