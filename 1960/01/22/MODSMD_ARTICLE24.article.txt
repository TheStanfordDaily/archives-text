One of the favorite spare-time
activities in the rickety old Daily
shack is volume-flipping.
That's what we call going
through the ancient back issues
of The Daily that sit on six
shelves by the sports desk. It's
often just "another way to kill
time, bid sometimes useful in
formation is derived therein.
For instance: once The Daily
ran their own version of Confi
dential. Big black headlines said
"THESE PLACES SERVE LIQ
UOR TO MINORS." Below were
huge pictures of some well-known
campus spots. (We have il on
good authority that they are
somewhat more strict in their
alcohol dispensing lately, so you
needn't mob us.)
A real find turned up yester
day, though.
in the Oct. 6, 1940 edition sits
a picture of a fellow named Jack
Kennedy ". . . late of the London
School of Economics and Har
vard, now of the Stanford School
of Business . . ." Seems this fellow
had just had a book published
called "Why England Slept."

Lately, of course, Jack has
i gone on to bigger and better
I things and there is even talk
j that he may soon move into a
1 large house on Washington's
J Pennsylvania Avenue.
Jack said that he came out here
because of the climate and good
J football team (those were the
: days) and like that.
His father, at the time, was U.S.
ambassador to the Court of St.
| James and Jack said "... I under
stand they're calling Dad 'Amer
! ica's most bombed Ambassador'
! now. That's a helluva title, isn't
i it?"
He also seemed pretty pleased
with Stanford's crop of women.
"At Harvard, whenever t hey ask
for undergraduate opinion on
what would improve the school,
i about 80 per cent of the sugges
i lions are to make the school co
-1 educational.
Always thinking of helping out
he said, "I think I'll have one of
my sisters come here."
Jack never did get his Stanford
degree, however. Another Daily
' two weeks later tells the story.
Again the same picture of Ken
nedy is in the paper, but this time
on the front page. He was one of
j.the first Stanford men to be
drafted into World War 11.
A distinguished war career fol
lowed and Jack never made it
i back to The Farm.


JACK KENNEDY
Here? For football?
