As Barbara Hicks attempted to
point out in her recent considera
tion of the loyalty oath loyalty
affidavit issue, there are two
major questions involved.
Opponents of the oath and
affidavit argue that representa
tives of the people of the United
States have no business in
fluencing in any way the be
liefs of any citizen.
This is a legitimate question
hut it has been lumped with an
erroneous understanding of the
second question (i.e., does the
affidavit do what it was intended
to do) to throughly muddle the
issue.
Sample from The Daily's edi
torial of last Wednesday: "The
academic side of the question can
be argued . . . chiefly on grounds
of an individual's right to believe
versus the government's right to
give money only to those it feels
like giving it to."
The individual's "right to be
lieve" (whatever that is) would
seem to be a completely dif
ferent question than the gov
ernment's right lo attach such
stipulations as it deems to be
in the interest of the United
States to the money it loans.
To say they are the same ques
tion i-s to assume that students
have a right to be loaned money
by the government.
The argument that the affidavit
does not protect us from Commu
nist use of the money is right—
but it completely misses the
point. Our legislators are not so
naive as the college students who
so earnestly belabor this issue.
The loyalty affidavit provides
a method of punishing people
who perjure themselves to re

ceive aid l'rom a government, a
society really, (hat they would
destroy. The American people
obviously have no obligation to
support such individuals. It is a
simple matter to sign a piece of
paper. It is another to conceal
perjury indefinitely.
The affidavit provides a means
of punishing those who take aid
from a government they are bent
on destroying. Surely no one
would argue that some such pro
tection is not justified. To say
that laws against murder do not
prevent murder is no argument
for repealing such laws. . . .
I am sure, can attest to the truth
of this statement.
Seotty Thompson states that
the disclaimer singles out stu
dents as a group worthy of sus
picion. Our government has a
habit of doing this, it seems,
