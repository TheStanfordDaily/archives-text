# Letter Provokes Fund-Raising Query
## 
### Austin Scott 
A recent Stanford graduate, ob
viously unhappy with a Univer
sity fund appeal, expressed his
dissatisfaction in a latter, repro
duced below, to Stanford and to
The Daily.
To determine whether his com
plaints were an isolated case or
whether they express ideas fre
quently directed at Stanford's
fund raising activities, The Daily
checked with the Stanford Fund.
According to Warren Good
rich, Associate Director of De
velopment, the Stanford Fund is
responsible for' soliciting funds
from over 60,000 Stanford alum
ni. Fund appeals start the Sep
tember after graduation and con
tinue over a four month period.
New Approach
The Stanford Fund is inagurat
ing a brand-new approach. This
is the first year that the class
agent and Creative Committee
system has been used extensively.
The idea is to differentiate the
appeal with respect to graduating

classes. One member of each class
is appointed class agent. He
writes fund appeals to the mem
bers of his class.
The first appeal this year con
sisted of a letter from the class
agent and an information booklet
giving a general, overall picture
of the University's need for funds.
Each alumnus received a copy of

the booklet, and a letter from his
class agent. The agents are left
free to put into the letters what
they see fit.
Repeated Attacks
If a person failed to donate
after the September appeal, ho
received another letter from the
agent in October. A third was
sent in November to those who
failed to respond to the first two.
All those who failed to respond
after three appeals, received a
"change of pace" appeal in De
cember. This year's "change of
pace" is reproduced above. Good
rich said it is designed to provide
"a light touch," something that
alumni won't "toss in the waste
basket"-if they've gotten in the
habit of doing that to letters from
the Stanford Fund.
The "change of pace" appeals
are designed by the Stanford
Fund's Creative Committee, a
newly set up organization com
posed of 35 San Francisco alumni
in advei'tising and tin 1 written
media;

"We are trying to be different," I
Goodrich told The Daily. "If you !
try humor, you're bound to got |
conflicts. I'll admit some of these, I
like 'Happy New Moons,' get
pretty cornball."
Goodrich said that out of 60,000 j
alumni appealed to last year, 338
sent back written replies. Only
nine of these letters expressed
irritation of any sort. These nine
ranged from mild annoyance the
University got the class or ad-!
dress wrong- to extreme irrita-1
tion.
Goodrich explained that stu-j
dents are solicited as soon as they j
graduate, "While Stanford is still i
fresh in their minds. We don't |
want them to forget the financial !
problems of the University."
"There is a huge mechanical |
problem involved in making a i
differentiated appeal" he contin-j
ued. "We can't sort out those in i
business, those in graduate school i
and those in the army. We must I
make blanket appeals.

"We are working on circulars
for next year that will explain to
those in graduate school, or the
army, who can't afford to donate,
that il' they can't, it's alright, but
they'll continue to get letters .just
to keep Stanford in their minds."
Goodrich said that as a result
of this new approach, Stanford
is about fifth in the country in
total alumni funds, while it ranks
well below that in total number
of alumni.
"This year's drive has brought
in $9;") 1,000 so far," Goodrich said.
"If donations keep pace with last
year's, the total will be over $1
million, a new record. We feel
pretty good about the whole
thing."

A recent Stanford graduate, ob
viously unhappy with a Univer
sity fund appeal, expressed his
dissatisfaction in a latter, repro
duced below, to Stanford and to
The Daily.
To determine whether his com
plaints were an isolated case or
whether they express ideas fre
quently directed at Stanford's
fund raising activities, The Daily
checked with the Stanford Fund.
According to Warren Good
rich, Associate Director of De
velopment, the Stanford Fund is
responsible for' soliciting funds
from over 60,000 Stanford alum
ni. Fund appeals start the Sep
tember after graduation and con
tinue over a four month period.
New Approach
The Stanford Fund is inagurat
ing a brand-new approach. This
is the first year that the class
agent and Creative Committee
system has been used extensively.
The idea is to differentiate the
appeal with respect to graduating

classes. One member of each class
is appointed class agent. He
writes fund appeals to the mem
bers of his class.
The first appeal this year con
sisted of a letter from the class
agent and an information booklet
giving a general, overall picture
of the University's need for funds.
Each alumnus received a copy of

the booklet, and a letter from his
class agent. The agents are left
free to put into the letters what
they see fit.
Repeated Attacks
If a person failed to donate
after the September appeal, ho
received another letter from the
agent in October. A third was
sent in November to those who
failed to respond to the first two.
All those who failed to respond
after three appeals, received a
"change of pace" appeal in De
cember. This year's "change of
pace" is reproduced above. Good
rich said it is designed to provide
"a light touch," something that
alumni won't "toss in the waste
basket"-if they've gotten in the
habit of doing that to letters from
the Stanford Fund.
The "change of pace" appeals
are designed by the Stanford
Fund's Creative Committee, a
newly set up organization com
posed of 35 San Francisco alumni
in advei'tising and tin 1 written
media;

"We are trying to be different," I
Goodrich told The Daily. "If you !
try humor, you're bound to got |
conflicts. I'll admit some of these, I
like 'Happy New Moons,' get
pretty cornball."
Goodrich said that out of 60,000 j
alumni appealed to last year, 338
sent back written replies. Only
nine of these letters expressed
irritation of any sort. These nine
ranged from mild annoyance the
University got the class or ad-!
dress wrong- to extreme irrita-1
tion.
Goodrich explained that stu-j
dents are solicited as soon as they j
graduate, "While Stanford is still i
fresh in their minds. We don't |
want them to forget the financial !
problems of the University."
"There is a huge mechanical |
problem involved in making a i
differentiated appeal" he contin-j
ued. "We can't sort out those in i
business, those in graduate school i
and those in the army. We must I
make blanket appeals.

"We are working on circulars
for next year that will explain to
those in graduate school, or the
army, who can't afford to donate,
that il' they can't, it's alright, but
they'll continue to get letters .just
to keep Stanford in their minds."
Goodrich said that as a result
of this new approach, Stanford
is about fifth in the country in
total alumni funds, while it ranks
well below that in total number
of alumni.
"This year's drive has brought
in $9;") 1,000 so far," Goodrich said.
"If donations keep pace with last
year's, the total will be over $1
million, a new record. We feel
pretty good about the whole
thing."

viously unhappy with a Univer
sity fund appeal, expressed his
dissatisfaction in a latter, repro
duced below, to Stanford and to
The Daily.
To determine whether his com
plaints were an isolated case or
whether they express ideas fre
quently directed at Stanford's
fund raising activities, The Daily
checked with the Stanford Fund.
According to Warren Good
rich, Associate Director of De
velopment, the Stanford Fund is
responsible for' soliciting funds
from over 60,000 Stanford alum
ni. Fund appeals start the Sep
tember after graduation and con
tinue over a four month period.
New Approach
The Stanford Fund is inagurat
ing a brand-new approach. This
is the first year that the class
agent and Creative Committee
system has been used extensively.
The idea is to differentiate the
appeal with respect to graduating

classes. One member of each class
is appointed class agent. He
writes fund appeals to the mem
bers of his class.
The first appeal this year con
sisted of a letter from the class
agent and an information booklet
giving a general, overall picture
of the University's need for funds.
Each alumnus received a copy of

the booklet, and a letter from his
class agent. The agents are left
free to put into the letters what
they see fit.
Repeated Attacks
If a person failed to donate
after the September appeal, ho
received another letter from the
agent in October. A third was
sent in November to those who
failed to respond to the first two.
All those who failed to respond
after three appeals, received a
"change of pace" appeal in De
cember. This year's "change of
pace" is reproduced above. Good
rich said it is designed to provide
"a light touch," something that
alumni won't "toss in the waste
basket"-if they've gotten in the
habit of doing that to letters from
the Stanford Fund.
The "change of pace" appeals
are designed by the Stanford
Fund's Creative Committee, a
newly set up organization com
posed of 35 San Francisco alumni
in advei'tising and tin 1 written
media;

"We are trying to be different," I
Goodrich told The Daily. "If you !
try humor, you're bound to got |
conflicts. I'll admit some of these, I
like 'Happy New Moons,' get
pretty cornball."
Goodrich said that out of 60,000 j
alumni appealed to last year, 338
sent back written replies. Only
nine of these letters expressed
irritation of any sort. These nine
ranged from mild annoyance the
University got the class or ad-!
dress wrong- to extreme irrita-1
tion.
Goodrich explained that stu-j
dents are solicited as soon as they j
graduate, "While Stanford is still i
fresh in their minds. We don't |
want them to forget the financial !
problems of the University."
"There is a huge mechanical |
problem involved in making a i
differentiated appeal" he contin-j
ued. "We can't sort out those in i
business, those in graduate school i
and those in the army. We must I
make blanket appeals.

"We are working on circulars
for next year that will explain to
those in graduate school, or the
army, who can't afford to donate,
that il' they can't, it's alright, but
they'll continue to get letters .just
to keep Stanford in their minds."
Goodrich said that as a result
of this new approach, Stanford
is about fifth in the country in
total alumni funds, while it ranks
well below that in total number
of alumni.
"This year's drive has brought
in $9;") 1,000 so far," Goodrich said.
"If donations keep pace with last
year's, the total will be over $1
million, a new record. We feel
pretty good about the whole
thing."
