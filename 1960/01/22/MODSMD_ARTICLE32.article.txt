# Immature Approach?

Editor, The Daily:
While still an undergraduate at
Stanford, I very often fell am
bivalent about the University. . . .
It seemed to me that they of
fered an unique opportunity for
the highest form of intellectual
stimulation and satiation. . . .
If includes students who all
find the acquisition of knowledge
and discovery of the interrelations
between the branches of knowl
edge an absorbing and primary
task (or better, joy); it includes
a faculty who feed 1 his mood,
share it, and have a rich and
friendly environment in which to
do so.
Sometimes 1 thought I saw this
at Stanford. More often I thought
I didn't. . . .
I left with the impression that
the administration was probably
sympathetic at heart, but hope
lessly tangled up in intrigue, pri
marily financial, but also due in
part to internal politics and mis
perceived social pressures from
without.
Now when I say hopelessly,
gentlemen, I mean .just that.
Since coming to Yale for the first
time (for graduate study ) 1 have
seen, at work in a large under
graduate body, the sort of absorp
tion and enthusiasm I mentioned
previously, and I have talked with
some of the numerous Stanford
graduates here and found many
who seem to share my view
point. . . .
But the other day your office
reached me with another of its

frequent pleas for financial aid.
(11 I count right, I have received
three since graduation last June.)
Despite all my regrets about
Stanford, my enthusiasms still
outweigh these regrets and so
theoretically the task of getting
mo to donate to Stanford is far
from hopeless.
Because your efforts have been
having just the opposite of their
intended effect, let me hasten to
advise you how to successfully
get donations from me.
First, while in graduate school,
1 find tuition, room, and board
take all my money. Thus, when
ever I receive a notice from your
office, 1 am developing the habit
of discarding it without opening
it. 1 suggest, since you will prob
ably find that the whole class of
'59 doesn't start really donating
until 1965 or so, that you just
stop sending requests for money
until I and my fellow classmates
are in a position to seriously con
sider your requests.
If you feel you must write,
then who not write an interesting,
newsy, adult letter which will
help develop the habit of looking
forward to your correspondence.
1 use the word adult here be
cause that is precisely where your
most recent circular failed. In
fact it boomeranged. I still picture
Stanford as a seat of intellectual
learning with a sober and de
dicated administration.
But when I am told by this
administration that I should be
a "new, Stanford Red, king of
Indian giver," that "wampum
given to Stanford is (leductible,"
and thai I should thus "pop (my)

I check in the envelope below," I
am reminded of all the anti-in
tellectual shadows 1 thought 1
j saw at Stanford. . . .
Gentlemen, when it comes time
1 to ask me for money, they key to
success is to be adult, and to scare
me, Tell me that without mv do
nation you will accept federal
! assistance (and control ) or that
J more effort will soon go into
fielding a better football team and
| other financially profitable ath
] letic teams, or that you will be
j forced to cancel the appointment
|of some controversial but dis
j tinguished member of the faculty.
Give me some hope that my
I donation will help attract schol
ars, both matured and green, to
i Stanford. Give me some hope
I that there will continue to be
| alumni, who, like myself, are dis
satisfied with the way Stanford
was when they left it.
If you follow these suggestions,
! my power to resist will be hope
i lessly weak.
