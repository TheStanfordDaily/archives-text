# Stanford Five Healthy For Washington Teams
## Daily Sports 
### 
With everybody all of a sudden
healthy, Stanford basketball
Coach H<>wie Dallmar is suddenly
faced with the problem of who
to start where in this weekend's
basketball games in the North
west .
The Indians travel to Washing
ton this weekend to play the
University of Washington on Sat
urday and Washington State Uni
versity the following Monday.
For the first lime since the day
the season began Dallmar ha;
everyone of his players in sound
health and ready to play. To add

I o his problems, if they can be
•onsidered problems, Dallmar has
had some fine fill-in performances
rem reserves who have replaced
injured starters, and now has to
decide who are his reserves and i
vho are his regulars.
The most obvious case is tha'
of Neal Brockmeyer. Brockmeyer,

nild-mannered and previously
•.eldom -playing reserve center,
uiddenly came to life in a game
against Cal two weeks ago, and
has shown so much fight in the
ast two games, that there seems
to way to stop his playing.
Windsor Gets Hot
However, as soon as Brock
meyer appeared to have wrested
he starting job avvav from sopho
more John Windsor, Windsor
•ame up with one of his best per
formances of the year. Windsor
replaced Brockmeyer against
Washington State last Saturday
and before Brockmeyer had a
chance to slip on his jacket and
sit down on the bench Win Isor
had rolled up a series of baskets
and looked to bo regaining a
starting berth.
Windsor to Forward
Later in the game Dallmar had
Windsor at forward and Brock
meyer back in at con er. This
would be fine, except which for
ward should be benched? Last
weekend forward Jerry Thueson,
out with injuries against Cal, re
turned to !!;''• lineup to have one
of his hottest evenings against
WSU picking up 11 points in the
first half and practi ally single
handedly keeping the Indians
ahead that stanza.
Biff Front Line
A forward wall of 6-7 Windsor.
6-7 Thuesen, and 6-8 Brockmeyer
would give the Indians one of
their biggest front lines in years.
However, one of the team's top
rebounders and best defensive
player John Ilendry can hardly
be overlooked for a starting berth.
Hendry, who has always been
regarded as a great defensive
man but poor shooter, left a few
of his critics in awe last weekend
as the 6-2 forward hit with deadly
accuracy in both weekend con
tests. The only case for keeping
the high jumping Hendry out of
the lineup in the past was his
pooi- shooting record, bill now he
seems to have overcome this de
ficiency.
Hendry to Guard?
Why not move Hendry to a
guard? He has the type shots
that are conducive to this spot
and is an adequate ball handler.
With Hendry at guard though,
either ace playmaker Bub Bowl
ing or Ihe team's leading scorer
John Arrillaga would have to
eome out.
A team with Stanford's low
scoring habits has to play for
every point it can get, and to take
the high scoring Arrillaga out
might be suicide. Bowling on the
other hand has one of those in
tangible qualities called hustle
that has sparked his teammates
on several occasions. The best ex
ample being last Friday's Wash
ington game in which Bowling
rallied a seemingly doomed squad
with frequent steals and clutch
foul shooting to bring them back
from a sure defeat to a victory.
Maybe Dallmar should just
agree with opposing coaches
Grayson of Washington and
Harshman of WSU to use six
men at a time this weekend.
