# East Favored To Whip West In NBA Clash
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (/P) The
East rules a slight favorite to
night in the All-Star game of the
National Basketball Assn.
Veteran Bob Cousy, of the
world champion Boston Celtics,
gives the East a stronger back
court because of his smooth ball
handling and tricky passing. He
is a good scorer, too, but his
shooting ability is sometimes
overshadowed by his ball han
dling.
Wilt Chamberlain, the 7-1
rookie giant of the Philadelphia
Warriors, will be an excellent
target for Cousy's passes in the
keyhole. Me shows promise of
smashing virtually all records.
For outside shooting strength,
the Easl can rely on Dolph
Schayes of Syracuse. Last week
he became the first player in
NBA history to reach 15,000
points.
The other two starters for the
East will bo Paul Ari/.in of Phila
delphia at forward and Richie
Guerin of New York at guard.
The VVest, however, has four
Iprrifie scorers in forwards Jack
Twyman of Cincinnati, Bob Pet tit
and Cliff Hagan of St. Louis and
Elgin Baylor' of Minneapolis.
Walt Dukes of Detroit will start
at center for the West. His job
will bo to stop Chamberlain but
he'll have help from throe others
since the West is expected to use
a sagging defense.
