*/
MOSCOW (/I 1 ) A Soviet test
rocket fired from a third of Ihe
way around the world missed its
target in mid-Pacific by only a
little over a mile, the Russians
announced yesterday.
The shot into a normally Amer
ican-controlled bull's-eye area
about 1.000 miles southwest of
Hawaii was fired from a distance
of about 7,760 miles, said Tass,
the official Soviet news agency.
It was billed [lere as the firsl
of a series of multistage ballistic
missiles intended for flights to
ward such planets as Venus and
Mars.
Early Guesses Oil
The announcement, about 24
hours after U.S. military authori
ties had disclosed detection of Ihe
shot, contradicted early specula
tion by Washington officials that
it apparently had missed by hun
dreds of miles.
Tass said the dummy nose cone
had hit the water only 1.24 miles
from"the predetermined point"
at 12:05 p.m. EST Wednesday
after the next to last stage had
disintegrated and burned in the
atmosphere about 50 miles up.
Dramatic Counter
The claim was a dramatic coun
ter to the disclosure by President
Eisenhower in his State of the
Union message that 14 U.S. Atlas
missiles had scored hits less than
two miles from their targets at a
range of 5,000 miles.
Washington military officials
said yesterday their later informa
tion indicated the Soviet missile
did fall within the target area, a
zone of 31 800 square miles.
Speculation in Washington was
that the rocket was fired from
Tyura Tam, in the area of the
Aral Sea in the southern part of
the Soviet Union.
