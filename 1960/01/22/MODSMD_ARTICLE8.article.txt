j Monday in search of donations
j to the 1960 Heritage Fund.
I This year's goal, according to
j chairman Clark Swanson and co-
I chairman Scott Richman, is
: $17,500, which is $2500 over what
j was collected in last year's drive.

scholarships for freshmen* and
sophomores who show leadership
j capabilities.
The Heritage Fund was inau
i gurated by the Class of '55, who
j were dissatisfied with the usual
; class gifts of a drinking fountain
! or a bench for Inner Quad. They
| decided instead to seek the sup-
I port of Peninsula merchants for
j a gift which would have more
I long-range results.
