the State Department.
Ambassador Bonsai refused to
answer any questions. "I have
spoken my piece yesterday,"he
said, referring to airport state
ments he made in New York and
Washington.
Bonsai said during a brief stop
over in New York that U.S.-Cuban
relations were "seriously deteri
orating." lie added in Washing
ton he had "no intimation at all"
of any Cuban desire for concilia
tion.
Though all three officials were
extremely cautious in what they
•said after yesterday's conference
their unsmiling attitude seemed
to convey that Bonsai's report
had presented a grim picture of
the Cuban situation.
That Bonsai should be called to
Herter's home was taken as un
derscoring the gravity of U.S.
concern over developments dur
ing the past week.
Anti-American outbursts in Cu
ba have been in the focus of dis
cussions between the White
House, Congress and the State
Department for the past several
days.
