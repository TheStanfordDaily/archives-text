# Report Passed On New Union
## 
### 
After much debate over the
various facilities to be included
in the new Tresidder Union, the
Ad Hoc Committee last Wednes
day passed the 40 â€¢ page report
published on Jan. 5.
The ballroom-banquet room was
discussed at great lengths until
it was decided to leave it as an
alternate with the deciding factor
being the cost of the other fa
cilities.
About $3,000 worth of film
showing equipment is anticipated.
This equipment will be for the
use of small groups, including
possibly cartoons during dead
week, but will rival the Cubberley
showings.
In addition to the 14-lane bowl
ing alley, the committtee ap
proved 10 billiard tables and 10
ping-pong tables. All of these ac
tivities will bring in revenue to
the union, as there will be fees
for each.
The report will now go to the
Union Committee Board, com
prised of both students and fac
ulty, for approval. Members of
the Ad Hoc Committee will now
become members of more special
ized sections to discuss the de
tails of the facilities.
