# U.S.-Japan Differences Noted

### Vicki Nicol 
Hisao Shinohara, better known
as "Sam," is one of this year's
ten ASSU foreign scholars. Since
he has been in the U.S.. Sam has
noticed several very distinct dif
ferences between the Japanese
way of life and that of (he Amer
icans.
Americans, he says, especially
American students, are disre
spectful of authority. This he at
tributes to their* history of stress
ing the idea of the equality of
men. The Japanese custom is al
most a direct opposite. Their his
tory has stressed tho idea of
respecting authority.
Americans are very, v e r y
practical, Sam notes, and have a
tendency to judge things only
from their practical results. For
this reason, they often seem to
judge things superficially, only
considering the results. But. Sam
thinks, this practical outlook is
often an advantage.

Another outstanding factor that
Sam finds characteristic of Amer
icans is their superiority complex.
This he finds a good thing, for
he thinks it is very important
that a country should have con
fidence in itself.
Sam feels that it is especially
valuable to the U.S. and to
Japan to know and understand
each other. For this reason he
and another student in Japan
have arranged to invite 10 Stan
ford students to Japan this sum
mer, to acquaint them with Japa
nese customs and ways of think
ing. He will begin interviewing
people for this trip in February.
The Japanese school system is
exactly I lie same as that of the
U.S. This is because the U.S.
initiated many colleges and
universities in Japan after
the war. There too. they follow
a General Studies program, and
are also plagued by the problem
i>f student apathy.
