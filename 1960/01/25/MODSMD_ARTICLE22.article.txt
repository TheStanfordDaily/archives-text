## Problems With Bicycles 
### Doug Willis 
"The trouble with bicycles," ex
plained a transfer student, "is
that they can get at you any
place. As a pedestrian you're at
their mercy, and they are a haz
ard when you are driving."
A report before Legislature last
Thursday night divided the bi
cycle problem into four areas:
bicycles on the streets violating
the vehicle code, insufficent light
ing of bicycles at night, bicycle
riding 011 quad or "bike-pedestrian
interaction" and bicycle parking.
There has been a good deal
of discussion lately about these
four problems, and now the
University Safety Committee
under Hob Love and a Legisla
ture committee are studying to
find what can be done about
the bicycle problems.
Here is a point that we would
like to consider: the problem isn't
whal to do but how to get people
to do it.
The first two problems — bi
cyclist:-; violating traffic laws and
insuffieently lit bicycles at night
- can be solved simply if bi
cyclists obey the state vehicle
code.
As for bicycles on Quad,
probably most of lis have for
gotten that there are already
rules against (his. Many of us
can remember a time, not more
than three years ago, when this
rule was strictly enforced.
The bicycle parking problem
shouldn't be a problem either. We
can appeal to the University Safe
ty Committee to install additional
bicycle racks and to cyclists to
.'■how courtesy. Courtesy should
keep people from parking bicycles
in walkways and under the ar
cades, where they aren't permit
ted anyway.
We need to consider the prob
lem of how to got bicyclists to
cooperate with existing laws and
regulations.
It would be impossible for the
Stanford Police (o enforce the
vehicle code against bicycle
riders if they didn't cooperate.
Too many thousands of bicy
clists run stop signs every day

for Stanford's small police force
to handle them alone. And
there aren't enough ticket hooks
on campus to tag - every unlit
bicycle that travels at night on
campus.
Sasha Lanz, chairman of lire
Legislature committee studying
bicycles, suggested that the only
solution is an integrated propa
ganda campaign. This is probably
true. At least we hope that ex
plaining to Stanford students that
they endanger themselves when
lhey violate the vehicle code is
enough to inspire a little modera
tion from the flagrant violators.
Stanford will help in a bicycle
safety campaign. The University
Safety Committee reports that the
University will purchase and dis
tribute free "Lite-A-Bike" kits of
reflector tape.
But how can we successfully
apply propaganda to curb bicycles
on Quad? We can't point out the
personal danger to. cyclists be
cause it is the pedestrian who is
taking the risk.
However, until about three
years ago there were only a few
bicycles on Quad. Entering stu
dents were told in their orienta
tion talks that bicycles were
strictly prohibited on Quad and
persons were occasionally re
minded.
Since then, bicycle rules have
been stated .jokingly in orienta
tion talks. We heard of one pre
reg talk in which freshmen
were told, ". . . hut then you
aren't supposed to smoke 011
Quad either." And individual re
minders are ineffective when
we conscientiously park our
own bicycle off Quad and then
climb over about 200 bicycles on
Quad in front of our classroom.
The Safety Committee plans to
install bicycle racks of a new de
sign "that no one should object
to." A teaching assistant sug
gested where to put the first new
racks: ". . . in the gateways to
Quad in front of the Library and
the Physics Lecture Hall, then it
would kill two birds with one
stone.

Too many thousands of bicy
clists run stop signs every day

for Stanford's small police force
to handle them alone. And
there aren't enough ticket hooks
on campus to tag - every unlit
bicycle that travels at night on
campus.
Sasha Lanz, chairman of lire
Legislature committee studying
bicycles, suggested that the only
solution is an integrated propa
ganda campaign. This is probably
true. At least we hope that ex
plaining to Stanford students that
they endanger themselves when
lhey violate the vehicle code is
enough to inspire a little modera
tion from the flagrant violators.
Stanford will help in a bicycle
safety campaign. The University
Safety Committee reports that the
University will purchase and dis
tribute free "Lite-A-Bike" kits of
reflector tape.
But how can we successfully
apply propaganda to curb bicycles
on Quad? We can't point out the
personal danger to. cyclists be
cause it is the pedestrian who is
taking the risk.
However, until about three
years ago there were only a few
bicycles on Quad. Entering stu
dents were told in their orienta
tion talks that bicycles were
strictly prohibited on Quad and
persons were occasionally re
minded.
Since then, bicycle rules have
been stated .jokingly in orienta
tion talks. We heard of one pre
reg talk in which freshmen
were told, ". . . hut then you
aren't supposed to smoke 011
Quad either." And individual re
minders are ineffective when
we conscientiously park our
own bicycle off Quad and then
climb over about 200 bicycles on
Quad in front of our classroom.
The Safety Committee plans to
install bicycle racks of a new de
sign "that no one should object
to." A teaching assistant sug

racks: ". . . in the gateways to
Quad in front of the Library and
the Physics Lecture Hall, then it
would kill two birds with one
stone.
"The trouble with bicycles," ex

that they can get at you any

A report before Legislature last
Thursday night divided the bi
cycle problem into four areas:
bicycles on the streets violating
the vehicle code, insufficent light
ing of bicycles at night, bicycle
riding 011 quad or "bike-pedestrian
interaction" and bicycle parking.
There has been a good deal
of discussion lately about these
four problems, and now the
University Safety Committee
under Hob Love and a Legisla
ture committee are studying to
find what can be done about
the bicycle problems.
Here is a point that we would
like to consider: the problem isn't
whal to do but how to get people
to do it.
The first two problems — bi
cyclist:-; violating traffic laws and
insuffieently lit bicycles at night
- can be solved simply if bi
cyclists obey the state vehicle
code.
As for bicycles on Quad,
probably most of lis have for
gotten that there are already
rules against (his. Many of us
can remember a time, not more
than three years ago, when this
rule was strictly enforced.
The bicycle parking problem
shouldn't be a problem either. We
can appeal to the University Safe
ty Committee to install additional
bicycle racks and to cyclists to
.'■how courtesy. Courtesy should
keep people from parking bicycles
in walkways and under the ar
cades, where they aren't permit
ted anyway.
We need to consider the prob
lem of how to got bicyclists to
cooperate with existing laws and
regulations.
It would be impossible for the
Stanford Police (o enforce the
vehicle code against bicycle
riders if they didn't cooperate.
