## Dylan Thomas—A Feeling 
### 
"I was born in a large Welsh
industrial town at the beginning
of the Great War: an ugly, lovely
town (or so it was, and is, to met,
crawling, sprawling, slummed, un
planned, jerry-villa's, and smug
suburbed by the side of a long
and splendid-curling short where
truant boys and sandfield boys
and old anonymous men, the tat
ters and hangovers of a hundred
charity suits, beachcombed, idled,
and paddled, watched the dock
bound boats, threw stones into
the sea for the barking, outcast
dogs, and, on Saturday summer
afternoons, listened to the mili
tant music of salvation and hell
fire preached from a soap-box."
This is Dylan Thomas talking
of his childhood. It is Thomas
poetry in prose, his character
istic compound words, the feel
ing and rhythm of feeling, the
pulse and flow of poetry.
Thomas' "Under Milkwood," a
play for voices, is also poetic, but
it is more than that. It is the feel
ing of a small Welsh town, the
people there, the way they live.
The play is tragic and witty at
once. Its three acts are morning,
noon and night; its setting, a
crazy town; its characters, the
population of the town, dead and
alive. Everything is in the play
but drama as such. Instead it is
simply life.
"Under Milkwood" was first
done as a radio play after
Thomas' death in 1953. The
Stanford Players are doing it
this weekend in Memorial Audi
torium.
I saw a reading of it at UCLA's
Schoenberg Hall this summer. II
was extremely well done by a
professional group and its impact
on Ihe audience was tremendous.
Five people took all the parts

the result was a reading similar
to that of "I Knock at the Door"
here last quarter.
If the Players are able to do
half the job of the UCLA group,
it will be a performance well
worth seeing. The play is very
moving and very beautiful. Per
haps it's because its characters
1 are frank, warm, flesh and blood
■ people. Or because the words of
Thomas are so exciting, so evoca
tive.
"To begin at the beginning:
"it is spring, moonless night
in the small town, starless and
bible-black, the cobbles! reels
silent and Hie hunched, eourl
ers'-and-rabbils' wood limping
invisible down to Ihe sloe-black,
slow, black, erowblack, fishing
boat-bobbing sea."
The effect is a feeling, an
I atmosphere, which Thomas fol
lows with an intense melancholy
| and an intense gladness. Songs
jdo a great deal t;o express the
deepest feelings. And there is the
sense that life and time go on.
Thomas died in New York in
1953 at the age of 89. His most
important work is his poetry
but his prose has poetic quality
and a content which will make
it stay around for qnife a while.
"Under Milkwood" has been
published in paperback, and
Thomas himself has made a re
! cording of it.
Someone has called the play "as
new and vital and excellent in
itself as anything written for
literary broadcasting during the
last 25 years."
i Here's hoping the Stanford
Players do ihe play and Thomas
justice. If they do, it will be an
unforgettable experience for all
I concerned.

industrial town at the beginning
of the Great War: an ugly, lovely
town (or so it was, and is, to met,
crawling, sprawling, slummed, un
planned, jerry-villa's, and smug
suburbed by the side of a long
and splendid-curling short where
truant boys and sandfield boys
and old anonymous men, the tat
ters and hangovers of a hundred
charity suits, beachcombed, idled,
and paddled, watched the dock
bound boats, threw stones into
the sea for the barking, outcast
dogs, and, on Saturday summer
afternoons, listened to the mili
tant music of salvation and hell
fire preached from a soap-box."
This is Dylan Thomas talking
of his childhood. It is Thomas
poetry in prose, his character
istic compound words, the feel
ing and rhythm of feeling, the
pulse and flow of poetry.
Thomas' "Under Milkwood," a
play for voices, is also poetic, but
it is more than that. It is the feel
ing of a small Welsh town, the
people there, the way they live.
The play is tragic and witty at
once. Its three acts are morning,
noon and night; its setting, a
crazy town; its characters, the
population of the town, dead and
alive. Everything is in the play
but drama as such. Instead it is
simply life.
"Under Milkwood" was first
done as a radio play after
Thomas' death in 1953. The
Stanford Players are doing it
this weekend in Memorial Audi
torium.
I saw a reading of it at UCLA's
Schoenberg Hall this summer. II
was extremely well done by a
professional group and its impact
on Ihe audience was tremendous.
Five people took all the parts

the result was a reading similar
to that of "I Knock at the Door"
here last quarter.
If the Players are able to do
half the job of the UCLA group,
it will be a performance well
worth seeing. The play is very
moving and very beautiful. Per
haps it's because its characters
1 are frank, warm, flesh and blood
■ people. Or because the words of
Thomas are so exciting, so evoca
tive.
"To begin at the beginning:
"it is spring, moonless night
in the small town, starless and
bible-black, the cobbles! reels
silent and Hie hunched, eourl
ers'-and-rabbils' wood limping
invisible down to Ihe sloe-black,
slow, black, erowblack, fishing
boat-bobbing sea."
The effect is a feeling, an
I atmosphere, which Thomas fol
lows with an intense melancholy
| and an intense gladness. Songs
jdo a great deal t;o express the
deepest feelings. And there is the
sense that life and time go on.
Thomas died in New York in
1953 at the age of 89. His most
important work is his poetry
but his prose has poetic quality
and a content which will make
it stay around for qnife a while.
"Under Milkwood" has been
published in paperback, and
Thomas himself has made a re
! cording of it.
Someone has called the play "as
new and vital and excellent in
itself as anything written for
literary broadcasting during the
last 25 years."
i Here's hoping the Stanford
Players do ihe play and Thomas
justice. If they do, it will be an
unforgettable experience for all
I concerned.
