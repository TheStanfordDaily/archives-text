Violation of 5th?
Editor, The Daily:
If there be any interested in
improving Stanford, I write to
him.
If Stanford wanted to require
applicants to state which race
they belonged to, it could. If Stan
ford asked all Lutherans or Greek
Orthodoxans 1o leave, it could. If
Stanford declared no student
would be allowed to state his
views on President Sterling's
deeds, it could. Stanford is a pri
vate institution, and therefore
has the right to do what it wishes.
But would you not be less proud
of Stanford if it did these things?
Perhaps some of you might even
withdraw, because you value free
dom of religion, toleration, and
thought.
If you sign the Honor Code, you
agree to "neither receive nor give
unpermitted aid." Stanford, as a
private institution, has the light
to ask you this.
But don't you find this objec
tionable? If you don't sign, your
test will not be graded. You are
being discriminated against for
refusing to sign or state some
thing which could be used to in
criminate you (your right, accord
ing to the U.S. Constitution).
You've heard the statement
used by gangsters: "I refuse to
answer on grounds it may in
criminate me." Angry as our in
vestigating committees get, they
cannot deprive these gangsters of
this right. Why then should we
deprive ourselves?
Sure, Stanford can make us
sign it. oi 1 face withdrawal. But
why not improve the Honor
Code? Substitute the words: "Do
not receive or give unpermitted
aid." No signed statement will be
asked. N'o discrimination can be
made.
If you oppose what T believe,
write to Rick R'ule, chairman of
the Honor Code Commission and
tell him what you think. His ad
dress is P.O. Box 60. He is in
vestigating the matter.
