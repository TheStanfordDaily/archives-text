Re: Friday's editorial where il
was stated that it might be best
if bicycles were not parked on
the arcades of the quad on rainy
j days.
I park my bike in the shelters
so that my brakes will not gel
| wet. Wot brakes do not work
and I might hit some poor pedes
i Irian thereby denting my fender.
I agree that the entrance to the
quad across from the library pre
sents a problem and 1 think that
1 this could best bo alleviated by

putting gales across tho side
walk nnd stopping pedestrian
travel at that point.
There are relatively few en
trances to iho quad for bicycle
riders in the first place, so why
make less. Pedestrians, on the
other hand, do not have this
problem.
