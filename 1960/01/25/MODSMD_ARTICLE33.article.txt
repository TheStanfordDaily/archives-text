# Another Rose Bowl Pact?
## 
### 
CHICAGO I/P) The Big Ten
Athletic Conference indicated yes
terday (he possibility of another
playing contract in the Rose Howl
football game.
At a joint meeting of athletic
directors and faculty representa
tives, the Big Ten decided to vote
again on the Rose Bowl matter at
its March meetings.
The mere fact the Rose Bowl
question was revised showed the
Big Ten is not willing to drop out

of the picture.
Last spring the conference fell
into a 5-5 deadlock vote on the
question of further league partici
pation. Since a majority was
needed, the tie killed chances of
further conference participation.
The spring meeting at which
the Rose Bowl question finally
will be resolved will be held
March 3-5 at Ohio State Univer
sity in conjunction with the in
door track meet.
