# PLACED IN HOMES
## Students Get Opportunity To Live in Foreign Lands 
### Jerry Isenberg 
The Experiment in International Living, a unique opportunity
for American college students to become acquainted with life in
a foreign country, will offer 1,500 young people the chance to
travel to some 29 countries this summer.
Students live with a family in the country of their choice foi

eight weeks. During this time
they are exposed to life in the
foreign community as it is quite
unknown to the casual tourist.
In loosely-knit groups of about
a dozen, students are usually
placed in homes in a small town
where they see as much or as
little of each other as they want.
Emphasis is placed on the de
velopment of sound personal re
lationships with the student's
adopted family. Friendships often
outlast the student's stay in the
country.
Leaders
Accompanying each group is a
leader, usually a teacher, from
25-30 years old. Leaders have legal
responsibility for students in
their group, but, according to
Stanford spokesman for the Ex
periment, Lynn Shafer, "you see
him only when you need him."
Leaders as well as students
are being sought for the upcom
ing summer program. Admission
to the Experiment is selective,
based on the applicant's academic
performance, recommendations
from professors and former Ex
perimenters, a physical examina
tion and several -short esavs.

Last year 17 Stanford students
participated in the Experiment, of,
' whom two received $500 scholar
ships. Usually, the student pays
the cost of his trip which varies
; between $350 and $1,200. Scholar
; ships are available for qualified
applicants who can demonstrate
I need.
Language requirements vary
I according to the student's choice
jof country. Competency in
French, Italian, German and
; Spanish must be at the level of
two years current college study
for •students wishing to live in
! countries where these languages
are spoken. There is no language
! requirement for any other nation.
The Experiment includes the
European countries, South Amer
ica, the Near East, Japan and
Russia. This summer for the first
time a group will go to Poland.
Tour of Country
After their scheduled stay with
their adopted family, members of
each group join together with a
member of the family with whom
they have been Jiving to make a
three-week tour of the country.
This tour is the climax of the
•student's Experiment, designed to
teach him a great deal about a
small part of another culture.
Deadline for applying for the
j Experiment this summer is

All students interested in the
Experiment have been invited to
