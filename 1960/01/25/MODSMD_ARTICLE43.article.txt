# Valuable Book Leaves for Cal
## 
### 
The unique and valuable first
edition of Theqdore Dreiser's
first novel, "Sister Carrie," was
presented by Stanford to James
D. Hart, Vice-Chancellor and Pro- i
lessor of English at Berkeley,
who in turn presented it to the
Bancroft Library at Cal.
Because of its full page inscrip
tion by Dreiser to Frank Norris, j
California's famous novelist, J. j
Terry Bender, chief of the division
of special collection of the Stan
ford University Libraries, felt |
that the book belonged in the
Bancroft Library, which is con
sidered to have the most out
standing collection of Norris'
manuscripts, correspondence and j
other personal documents in 1
America.
Bender said the book came to |
Stanford about four years ago as |
a gift from Kathleen Norris, the
sister-in-law of Frank Norris.
