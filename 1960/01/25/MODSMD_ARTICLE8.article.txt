# Saltonstall No Large Missile Gap
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/1 J Â» Taking
issue with some of his colleagues,
Sen. Leveret I Saltonstall (R-
Mass) declared yesterday,"I do
not agree that there is this great
missile gap."
Saltonstall, the senior Republi
can on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, thus gave support to
the new Pentagon view that there
is "no deterrent gap" in over-all
U.S. military strength as com
pared to the Soviet Union.
Ahead or Russians
"We are ahead of the Russians
in the general opinion on certain
parts of the missile problem,"
he said. "Where they are ahead
of us is in the question of thrust.
Now they have a greater thrust
than we have because they went
at it sooner."
In a taped radio interview, the
Massachusetts senator backed
most of the administration's de
fense plans as outlined in the new
budget for the fiscal year start
ing July 1. But Saltonstall criti
cized what he described as a
slight neglect in keeping this
country prepared to deal with
limited war.
There have been complaints
that not enough planes are avail
able to fly sufficient troops quick
ly to trouble spots. And protests
have been raised over attempts to
cut down the size of the? active
reserve, particularly since eight
of the 14 Army combat divisions
are deployed overseas.
No Proof
Saltonstall did not say what
the basis was for his belief that
there is no great missile gap be
tween the United States and the
Soviet Union. Nor did lie indicate
whether he agreed with the
method by which Secretary of
Defense Thomas S. Gates Jr. con
eluded that "there is no gap in
U.S. capability to deter Russia
from starting a general war."
Gates surprised Congress mem
bers last week when he said prior
estimates of Soviet missile and
military power had been revised
downward by basing them on
"what the Soviet Union probably
would do, as opposed to former
estimates which were made on
what they arc capable of doing."
