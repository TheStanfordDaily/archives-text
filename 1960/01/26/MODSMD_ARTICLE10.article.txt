# Behavior Studied at Owen House
## 
### Lois Root 
"You might say we want to find rules
of human behavior."
With this purpose as a communal basis
for their work, an informal group of faculty
members, graduate students and undergrad
uate students bring their ideas to luncheon
at Owen House, a division of the Laboratory
of Human Development, and leave the table
with more hypotheses to apply to their re
search in the child psychology field.
Owen House, primarily concerned with
child development, was established with Ford
Foundation funds by Dr. Robert Scars and
Dr. Ernest Hilgard in the fall of 19.16. Vari
ous teachers interested in child psychology
established offices in Owen House, and grad
ually more people found their way into the
group.
While research and discussion is carried
out to some extent at Owen House, group
members do most of their observation work
at the Stanford Village Nursery School,
which is directed by Dr. Edith Dowley, and
in various public schools in nearby towns.
Most clinical research is concerned with the
personalities of normal children in ordinary
sit uat ions.
Nursery School Behavior
The first project of the laboratory was
written up and published hy Sears, Dr.
Eleanor Maceoby and Professor 1 Harry Levin;
their book, "Patterns of Child Rearing," was
compiled from data they collected at Harv
ard. There they observed a group of nursery
children and related their upbringing to their
behavior.
As a sequel. Sears, Mis. Maccoby and
staff members at the Laboratory of Human
Development at Harvard observed the same
group of children in the sixth grade, five
years late. A compilation of this material
may be published in monograph form this
summer. Comparison of the two reports may
clarify some changes in behavior occurring

from early childhood to middle childhood, ac
cording to Mrs. Maccoby.
In another area of child psychology. Dr.
Lucy Ran, Sears, and Dr. Richard Alport,
now at Harvard, collected data by observing
children at summer nursery school; they
looked for manifestations of the identifica
tion behavior process in which, for example,
one child might assume an adult role while
playing with dolls, taking for himself the
qualities he admires in his parents.
Another enthusiast. Dr. Albert Bandura,
has been studying cases of .juvenile delin
quency.
Intellects of Monkeys
A new member to Stanford's faculty is
Dr. Karl Pribram, who has been investigat
ing the relationships between the develop
ment of the intellect in monkeys. He is now
making comparative studies of the same
type with young children.
In another' branch of child psychol
ogy, Dr. Patrick Suppes and Mrs. Maccoby
have observed grade school children in the
Ravenswood School District for effects of
early introduction of mat hematic training
on the children's intellectual development.
For example, the observers wonder if geom
etry will help second graders reason more
clearly in other areas of learning. They are
it tempting to discern which children will
profit from such a program. They are also
looking for any negative features such
courses might produce.
Another recently developed field involves
the present-day interest in psychoanalysis;
laboratory members have observed nursery
school children to look for manifestations of
masculinity and femininity, and to see under
what conditions sex typing becomes notice
able.
In all their areas of research, the ob
servers are testing several theoretical points

of view; psychological theories are used to
guide, but are not dogmatically followed.
In addition to faculty members, some
graduate students and undergraduate stu
dents serve as research assistants.
Not all who work in the Owen House
group are in the psychology department.
Mrs. Pauline Sears. Associate Professor of
Education; is a member because of her in
terest in teacher-child relationships. She is
trying to see if creativity and learning can
be encouraged by the way the teacher reacts
to her students' successes and failures, and
by the way she manages her classes.
Also interested in child psychology, but
not a laboratory member, Dr. Pribram hopes
to establish a primate laboratory here.
Dr. Kimball llomney, Assistant Professor
of Anthropology, Dr. Nathan Maccoby, Pro
lessor of Mass Communications, and Dr.
Wilbur Schramm, Professor of Communica
tions and Journalism, are working on a
project of Communication of Information on
Child Rearing to Parents. Funds for this
project were granted by the National In
stitute of Mental Health.
Analysis Over Interest
Although methods of research differ, all
laboratory workers realize that on each proj
ect they must, set aside their natural in
terest in informing, encouraging and helping
people in order to remain analytical. They
"want to know what leads to what and
state the answer scientifically.''
No definite procedure has been estab
lished: the members follow their own in
terests and have found that one experiment
usually suggests many more. Through such
projects, the group's growing enthusiasm
lias led to the expansion of the laboratory
into almost all fields of study dealing with
the childhood development of human be
havior,
