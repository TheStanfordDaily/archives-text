# Tours to Aid International Understanding
## 
### 
j Stanford faculty and graduate
students will have an opportu
nity to contribute to international
; understanding this summer by
[ guiding groups of American stu
i dents in one of 29 different eoun
; tries through tho Experiment in
! International Living.
Experience in the country visi
ted is divided between 10 weeks
spent in individual homes and
three weeks traveling t<> broaden
| the students' understanding of
the host country. A leader be
tween the ages of 25 and 45 ac
companies each group of ten stu
! dents.
Promote Understanding
While technical details are a
I part of the responsibility of the
leader, his primary responsibility
; is to help the American students
I develop an ability to understand
| their hosts from the viewpoint of
J their own culture. This repre
j sents a dimension in international
! understanding which many stu
dent travelers find quite difficult
[ to grasp.
The leader, along with a co
leader in the community abroad,
is responsible for visiting the
homes where the experimenters
are living, to plan group meetings
and programs in the local com
munity, and to plan and carry
out the informal trip around the
country which follows the home
stay.
Group Supervision
Other major functions of the
leader are to assume responsibil
ity for the orientation of the
group, the safety, health, and
welfare of the individuals in the
group, and to help make the be
havior of the group a credit to
; the United States and to the Ex
j periment.
While it' is desirable for a
leader to know the language of
the country, this is not always
necessary.
The leaders do not receive a
salary, but receive full expenses
; and a travel allowance. When
leaders serve in successive years,
i compensation is increased. Mar
ried couples may lead a group,
| but each must submit a separate
application.
Training Conferences
This year's leaders will be
| selected after a series of leader
| ship training conferences are
i held. On the West Coast Ihe
' leader's weekend will be held Feb.
! 19-21 in San Francisco.
Those interested in a leader
ship position with the Experi
ment in International Living may
see William H. Allaway, Assist
ant Dean of Men; or Leighton
Rollins, West Coast Director of
the Experiment, who will be at
i the I-Center tomorrow at 7:15 p.m.
