With the Economic Report,
which has just Inon transmitted
to Congress, the President has
completed what was begun in ihe
address on the Stale of the Union
and the mess;'.go accompanying
the Budget.
lie has described our situa
tion as he sees it. He has out
lined his program. And lie has
sketched in his general ideas.
All is well in that the govern
ment will ask nothing more of
the people, and there is a prospect
that it will ask less.
For il is iho President's view
1 hat the country is secure. II is
prosperous. And insofar as il is
challenged by the rise of the So
viet Union, Ihe country can rest
assured and tranquil that because
of our devotion to individual liber
ty we arc destined to win tho
competition.
Is all this self-satisfaction
justified? Are we entitled to do
what these three messages
unite in telling us to do? Are
we entitled to concentrate our
energies on our private affairs,
confident that our national in
terests are secure and well
taken care of?
For myself I do not think so. I
think the President's satisfaction
with our situation is based on a
short and a small view of Ihe
historic competition in which we
are challenged.
I lis view of the Soviet challenge
is short and small because lie
does not distinguish between priv
ate prosperity, measui-ed in tho
total production of goods and
services for private use, and na
tional power, which is measured
not only in terms of armaments
but also in terms of wealth di
rected to education, to public
health, to the conservation and
development of tho natural and
the man-made resources of this
(ountry.
What is happening is that
under the leadership of the
President we are promoting
private prosperity at the ex
pense of national power. As a
result the influence of the
United States as a world power
is declining. That is why a

' growing number among us do
not share the President's satis
faction and are worried about
the future.
Given our situation in the world
today, these three messages bo
tray a dangerous complacency.
This complacency derives from
iho deep fallacy of believing that
in an era of cold war il should be
the policy of tho national govern
ment "to reduce tho share of tho
national income which is spent by
ihe government."
This fallacy can best bo under
stood in tho light of some testi
mony given a year ago by tho
chairman of tho President's Coun
cil of Economic Advisors. "As I
understand an economy," ho said,
"its ultimate purpose is to pro
duce more consumer goods. This
is Ihe object of everything we are
working at: to produce things for
customers."
Then the chairman went on
to say that "if you take total
gross national production, you
find that growth in recent years
has lagged. But if you look at
consumption—the thing which,
as I say, I regard myself as be
ing commissioned to maximize
—you find that we are doing
better."
There precisely is tho root of
our trouble. Our goal is to maxi
mize consumption. That is a very
low national goal, and altogether
unworthy of a great nation which
has a groat part to play in human
affairs. The object of our econ
omy is not to become fat with
consumer goods.
It is to use tho wenllh and the
power which tho economy can
produce to support iho national
purposes which we so frequently
proclaim. There is nothing more
convincing or inspiring in loving
our "liberty" lo enjoy consumer
goods so much that we cannot
afford to educate our children.
If wo really believe in Iho
ideals and tho spiritual aims
about which so much is said, we
have something else to do besides
maximizing the enjoyment of con
sumer goods.
