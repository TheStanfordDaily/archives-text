Error Claims
Kditor, The Daily:
I should like iho opportunity!
of correcting a few error's which
crept into Bob Frank's otherwise
clever digest of Ihe talk I gave
before the Independent Caucus.
Horn 1: Your headline writer
indicated thai I had reduced So
cialism to a matter of "plumb
ing." However, what I did reduce
to plumbing was capitalism. This;
is Ihe system of overflowing!
buckets, so to speak, which
periodically and with increasing!
intensity paralyzes the economic!
system with consequences too
well known to repeat here. So-!
cialism would replace the cap-!
italis! system of plumbing with
its human appendages with an in
telligent order in which human
relationships would be on a truly
civilized level.
Item 2: Mr. Frank erred when
lie reported that the Socialist
Labor Party advocates "public
ownership" of the buckets. We
advocate the collective ownership
of the means of production and
distribution by the working class.

| Public ownership means turning
the affairs of some unwieldly en
terprise in tho bureaucratic con
trol of the state. True Socialism
would be administered by repre
sentatives elect democratically
from each major occupational
subdivision. In short, the society
of the future abolishes geograph
ical (political) representation in
favor of industrial representation,
using the word industrial in its
broadest sense, (e.g., educators
elect educators; doctors elect
medical men; agricultural work
ers elect agricultural workers;
etc.)
Item 3: Ts probably a lypo
' graphical error. Socialists recog
nize the existence of a "class
struggle," not a "classic" one. The
I phrase is a summary of the fact
that the interests of workers and
capitalists (despite claims to the
contrary) are mutually exclusive.
Item 4: May sound like a seman
tic quibble, but I consider it im
portant. Nowhere in my talk did
I refer to "laborers.". The term
has an exceedingly narrow con
notation. It is the working class

'as a whole, some 90 per rent of
i ho population (including uni
versity professors) which is vic
timized by our present system.
The mer e fact that labor power is
a commodity, no maiter how
skilled, and therefore subject to
the same vicissitudes as all other
commodities, indicates the hypo
crisy of the present concern for
the "dignity of man."
The restoration of this dignity
of man remains for the Socialist
society to accomplish, particular
ly for realization of the program
i advocated by the Socialist Labor
j Party of America.

Drew Pearsonism?
Mditor, The Daily:
1 comment on Ron Costell's
rash of Drew Pearsonism, not be
cause he had attacked me. but
rather because he had maligned
!))•. Kendall, who ill in Madrid, is
not hen £io defend himself.
Words oft proclaim the man!
Since Mr. Costell, character
istically, avoids excessive de
mands on his readers, it should
not be difficult to construct a
MiddlHowii of his intellect.
I lo misspelled Dr. Kendall's
Christian name and my surname.
This oversight unmasks either in
al tent ivencss or a sloppy men
tality. But Ron is vary attentive.
He argues- 1 hat one must not
"be serious in proposing (even
in jestt a National SOCIALIST
movement . . ." because:
(a) The proposal would violate
itie "western tradition."
Mr. Costell fails to grasp the
elementary distinction between
i he serious and Ihe non-serious.
To offer my proposal seriously is
to mean it, and therefore, deny
the western tradition. But to offer
the same proposal in a jest is not
lo mean it, and thei-efore, in the
context used, is to defend that
tradition. Either Costell is a
slanderer or a very sick boy. Let
us be charitable and assume that
he is the latter.

(b) Wethoim may be Jewish
i Inarticulate premise: Jews must
not he objective I.
The purpose of my letter ob
viously was to demonstrate the
intellectual dishonesty of those
Liberals who squealed about free
dom of speech when McCarthy at
tacked the pro-Communists and
today, when the anti-Semites are
persecuted, lift nary a one of their
mighty pens in protest.
Let us not be too harsh on poor
Ron. The eruption of the inferno
within each of us which denied
him the uscendacy of reason, was
perhaps only temporary. This is
understandable; after all, "the
heart has reasons. . .
: My apologies to M. Pascal; my
compliments to the Duchess of
Windsor.

Raise Those Fees
Editor, The Daily:
On reading the accounts of the
ST <£r T talks, we were dismayed
to discover that Stanford ranks
only 3.~>th in the nation in amount
of tuition charged. Now we all
know that this is one of the very
best schools in the country, and
with just a little positive thinking
we could go right up to the top of
the heap in any category, includ
ing costliness!
We will never be content until
Stanford is twice as expensive as
them snooty Ivy League schools,
and twice as snooty.
