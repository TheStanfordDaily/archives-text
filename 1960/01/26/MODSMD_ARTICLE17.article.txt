In one of I ho Sunday magazines
lhero was a noble plea for schools
| lo allow more lime for teaching.
The author, a high school leach
or, listed just a few of the non
teaching duties of the public
school teacher such as collecting
money for milk and being in
surance salesmen.
According to I ho article some
teachers figure ahoul an hour of
I hoir teaching day is spent in
such activities and in schools
which set aside an activities hour
| during the school day for club
meetings, tho lime lost for leach
ing is oven greater.
The university professor, at
least here at Slanford, fortunate
ly doesn't have to soli milk and
j insurance. 11 is non-leaching duties
have a closer relationship to
leaching, but they still take time
Which could be spent with stu
| dents, who, while they can learn
much from the books, came to
Stanford to study under the pro
i fessor.
For instance, Iho professors
like to have some say in the
policies of the University, and
rightly so. Hut tins will mean
usually at least one committee.
Some teachers are helpful ad
visors and the student can learn
from them in advising confer
ences. But this cuts down the
time teachers can devote to those
who want to pursue special sub
ject matter.
Then there is tho expectation
I that professors will publish ar
ticles. While research and writing
may help professors in their
| teaching preparation, il may also
J diminish the time they can spend
with students who are seeking to
learn from Ihem.
The proposed increase in the
j number of graduate students at
I Stanford is likely lo decrease Ihe
contact the undergraduate has
with Ihe faculty, no matter how
much the University spends to
j improve the undergraduate pro
' gram.
The graduates require special
conferences with the leading
professors. The undergraduates
increasingly find themselves
taught by the graduates.
No one would insist that Ihe
| members of the faculty devote
every minute of their lives to stu
dents. We still hold a certain rev
erence for the family and do not
j ask our professors to turn lo
! celibacy.
Wo deplore the refusal of so
many of Iho faculty to participate
in the hostel program. Most, ac
cording to the report, could offer
no special excuse. Yet perhaps if
I hose who refused are not those
involved in many of the abovo
| mentioned activities, they had in
j mind those of their colleagues
| who are.
.lust as we are distrubed to see
the businessman who is deeply

entangled in his business to the
exclusion of family and recrea
tion, we would be disturbed to
see our professors so caught.
On the other side, students
often ignore ihe opportunities
which are available. Professors
tell of holding office hours day
! after day with no students ap
j pea ring.
This does not overshadow the
fact, however, that for many pro
fessor's a rebalancing of time may
I be in order'.
