Basketball I logs l lie Limelight
Look around anywhere in the sports world and you'll see news
about basketball. Up in Sail Francisco two nights ago ex-Stanford
star Paul Neumann made the news pages with a picture of him driv
ing for a basket with Akron guard George Sw.vers jumping on his
back in anger after the top-flight Investor guard stealing the ball
away. Neumann and teammate ex-Card Dick Haga have aided
the Investor comeback in the National Industrial League as colleague
Ken Dery reveals on this page today.
Also Stanford's re-vitalized Indian cagers went after Iheir fourth
win in a row against Washington State last night and face the Oregon
State Beavers and the Oregon Ducks this weekend at The Farm.
The Oregon Ducks, picked by most as the outstanding team from

the Northwest, will be no easy
tilt for the improved Indians. The
Ducks edged Stanford in oxer
time in their last encounter in
Eugene but their star sophomore
center Glen Moore tabbed by
Indian coach Ilowie Dallmar as
the outstanding freshman on the
coast last year was out with an
injured ankle. With 6-7 Moore in
the lineup the Webfoots should
be a real tough club and more
than make up for the famous
Stanford home advantage.
Moore was probably one of the
all-time Oregon prop stars and
ranks with John Hudoniatkin of
USC as the top sophomores on
the coast this year. Moore played
with the state champion Klamath
Falls team in 1958. That team was
a very interesting team to watch
from a spectator standpoint as it
consisted of Moon . 6-7 at center;
two 6-6 forwards and 6-4 and 5-2
guards. Moore and the shorl
guard for Klamath Falls would
bring the ball down, which was

certainly a comical sight, or Moore would initiate a one-man stall
dribbling around the whole opposing team.
Warren Tough
Besides Moore, Oregon boasts another tall sophomore star in (5-4
Charlie Warren at forward. Warren is currently third place in
Duck scoring this season potting an'eleven point per game average.
Warren made the Far Western Classic, a winter tourney at Cor
vallis, Ore., All-Star first team.
The Ducks have some fine "old men" to back up their sopho
mores in center or forward Dale Herron 6-f> senior who is the
fourth Duck scorer and guard Chuck Rask another senior who is
probably one of the top guards in the West. Both these boys are
also home-staters as will be found on the majority of all the North
west cage teams.
The Northwest seems to be over-loaded with 'young talent this
year although certainly they don't have a corner on the market be
cause good sophomores and juniors may be found on all California
teams and is highly indicative of Western basketball fortunes.
Washington's center liill Hanson, the current league scorer, is a
good example of this, year the Huskies will field an identical
five which saw action against the Indians in Hanson, Lyle Bakken
and Roger Niva. both sophomores at forwards, and Clint Names
and Dick Reiten at guards.
Oregon State will also be tough next year as once again they
should field an experienced tall team which includes Karl Anderson
(5-9 at center; Jay Carty 6-6 !L> and Krnie Johnson (5-6 at forwards; and
Hob Niles and Bob Jacobscn, both around (5-6 at guard. The big prob
lem next year for these teams will be leadership, especially at guards
for all may develop as the Washington Huskies have come close to
winning and show spots of brilliance but then fade before the
final gun to unsuccessful or average seasons.
Ex-Car<l Athletes in \ews
The Card â€¢sports alumni has been extremely active of late as
Art von Wronski a catcher and pitching star for the Indians last
year signed with the Baltimore Orioles last month. Von Wronski
led the Card baseballers to second place in CIBA league action last
year and was one of the top long-ball hitters for the Indians. Art
was assigned to Vancouver of the Pacific Coast league and will
probably be used at catcher but could will in practically anywhere
on the team as he has done in the past for diamond coach Dutch
Fehring.
Also making the news was Jim Pollard, an ex-teammate of cage
coach Howie Dalhnar on the NCAA chanmpion Stanford basketball
team in 1012. Pollard took over as coach of the NBA Minneapolis
Lakers early this month when John Castellini resigned in mid-sea
son. Pollard is a former Laker star and can be seen on the side
lines when the Lakers play the Wilt Chambcrlin-led Philadelphia
Warriors this Sunday afternoon at the Cow Palace.
