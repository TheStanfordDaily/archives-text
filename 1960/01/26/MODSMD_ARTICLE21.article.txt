Few Bay Area basketball fans
realize it, but there is another fine
team other than the University
o!' California which plays right in
San Francisco.
The San Francisco Investors,
one of nine teams playing in the
National Industrial Basketball
League, are worth seeing. The
players in the league are consid
ered just one step below the pros
in ability, but many of them are
potential professional players.
The teams in the league are
spread from New York to Seattle
and represent such companies as
Phillips Oil and the Sweeney Pipe
Company of Cleveland. The fran-

Stanford's basketball team de-
Tented the Washington State
Cougars in overling tonight
67-58 for its fourth consecu
tive victory of the 195JMJ0 cam
paign.

chise of the first-year San Fran
cisco Investors is owned by the
Allen J. Lefferdink Company,
The squad is loaded with local
talent including former Stanford
stars Paul Neumann and Dick
Haga, and USF great Fred La
cour.
Neumann, certainly capable of
playing in any league, is enjoying
the security of working for a
large company such as Lefferdink
and still gets his chance to play
basketball. Paul is blessed with
all the tools of the truly great
baekcourt man: speed, shooting
ability, defensive skills, and poise.
Captain of the Investors and aver
aging 18 points per game he is
the one they look to when the
going gets tough.
At one forward is 6-5 Dick
Haga, who came to the Investors
this year from Stanford along
with Neumann.
Certainly one of the most popu
lar members of the team is for
ward Fred Lacour. A player of
definite professional potential,
Lacour would have probably been
an All-American this year, but he
was ruled ineligible because of
grades. He has returned to school,
but luckily for coach Jim Walsh,
he is still an Investor.
Playing guard alongside Neu
mann and giving the team what
many consider "the best pair of
guards in the league" is last

year's Illinois captain Roger Tay
lor.
.Rounding nut the squad arc
centers Pearl Pollard and .Too
Leone and 11k 1 versatile Dick
Welsh.

Few Bay Area basketball fans
realize it, but there is another fine
team other than the University
o!' California which plays right in
San Francisco.
The San Francisco Investors,
one of nine teams playing in the
National Industrial Basketball
League, are worth seeing. The
players in the league are consid
ered just one step below the pros
in ability, but many of them are
potential professional players.
The teams in the league are
spread from New York to Seattle
and represent such companies as
Phillips Oil and the Sweeney Pipe
Company of Cleveland. The fran-

Stanford's basketball team de-
Tented the Washington State
Cougars in overling tonight
67-58 for its fourth consecu
tive victory of the 195JMJ0 cam
paign.

chise of the first-year San Fran
cisco Investors is owned by the
Allen J. Lefferdink Company,
The squad is loaded with local
talent including former Stanford
stars Paul Neumann and Dick
Haga, and USF great Fred La
cour.
Neumann, certainly capable of
playing in any league, is enjoying
the security of working for a
large company such as Lefferdink
and still gets his chance to play
basketball. Paul is blessed with
all the tools of the truly great
baekcourt man: speed, shooting
ability, defensive skills, and poise.
Captain of the Investors and aver
aging 18 points per game he is
the one they look to when the
going gets tough.
At one forward is 6-5 Dick
Haga, who came to the Investors
this year from Stanford along
with Neumann.
Certainly one of the most popu
lar members of the team is for
ward Fred Lacour. A player of
definite professional potential,
Lacour would have probably been
an All-American this year, but he
was ruled ineligible because of
grades. He has returned to school,
but luckily for coach Jim Walsh,
he is still an Investor.
