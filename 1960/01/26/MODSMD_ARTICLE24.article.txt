The foreign student population
of Stanford has increased 40 per
cent in the last five years; this
year there are 425 foreign stu
dents enrolled in the University.
As a result of this growth, sev
eral groups have been organized
1o deal with foreign affairs and
foreign students.
The Institute of International
Relations is probably the largest
and oldest of these groups. It was
initiated by a petition to the Ex
ecutive Committee of the ASSU
in 1946 to "increase the knowl
edge, interest, and usefulness of
the students on the campus in in
ternational affairs."
The lIR has three divisions:
Ilio education division, which in
cludes the Affiliations Dept.,
maintaining affiliations with the
Free University of Berlin and
with Keio University in Tokyo;
the conference division, dealing
wilh (lie World Affairs Council
and other conference groups; and
the social division, the division
most concerned with the foreign
students on campus. The host de
partment of the social division
organizes a pre-reg orientation
program, tours and various func
tions for the foreign students.
Last quarter it was in charge of
the weekly informal firesides at
the International Center.
The International Club is an
other department of the social
division of the lIR, but it func
tions more independently, elect
ing its own president, who is Das
Lathi from India, and planning
most of its own programs. These
programs include informal coffee
hours, panel discussions and
dances.
A majority of the programs of
the I-Club take place in the In
ternational Center, the remodeled
faculty residence on the Lower 1
Row. It is supervised by the Com
mittee for Foreign Visitors and
Students, administered jointly by
the coordinator of the Office for
Foreign Visitors and the Foreign
Student Advisor, members of the
staff of the Dean of Students.
The Community Committee for
International Students is a group
of local citizens which works for
the International Center, answer
ing the phone and doing services
for the foreign students.
In order to prevent confusion
and overlapping among all these

associations an International Ac
tivities Coordination Board was
organized, made up of representa
tives of all the groups dealing
with foreign students. The chair
man of this board is A 1 Kahn,
president of the lIR.
Several other organizations
sponsor scholarships for foreign
students. Such groups include the
ASSU Foreign Scholarship Com
mission, Cap and Gown, and the
YVVCA.
