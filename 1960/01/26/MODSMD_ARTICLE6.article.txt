"Eucalypto quasi-seceded
from Lagunita Court followed
by Granada and Adelpha. This
is a symbolic gesture of our
refusal to vote on a constitu
tional revision of Court offi
cers." Last night three Lag
easas, irrate over voting pre
cedure used to ratify the Lag
constitution, played Confeder
ates and seceded from the
Court. A demonstration will be
held tonight at 10 p.m. in the
Court. Anyone who wishes to
defend the Court system is
challenged to speak. Reasons
for seceding will be presented.
