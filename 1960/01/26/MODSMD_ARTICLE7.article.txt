# Coffin Asks for Belief in Value of Unique Individual
## 
### Keem Stassen 
The Iragcdy of our society is
! that "everyone is eager for a
badge of belonging to someone,
i somewhere and no one is sure
what that badge is," said Rev
: erend William Coffin who spoke
on the topic "Beat, Bothered, and
Bewildered" in Cubberlcy Audi
j torium last night.
The United States has hundreds
jof external fraternities and
groups, but no one seems to
realize that "what we have in
, common is our individuality" and
j that we should form "a unique
fraternity of individuals" said the
Chaplain of Yale,
Human Separation
"Each of us seems to be con
vinced that we are not good
i enough," and as a result, "hu
; mans do not meet, they just bump
j masks."
"There is only one exit. In the
deepest part of human relation
! ship we give each other a sense of
value through love. It it not be
: cause we have value that we are
loved, but because we are loved
! that we have value."

Reverend Coffin then asked
"why don't we leap to accept
love?" lie answered his question
in two ways. First, we are too
proud to love which demands
humility. More important, "we
don't want forgiveness and love
because to be forgiven means to
become responsible. We feel we
must do for others what has al
ready been done for us."
Responsibility of Love,
What does it mean when we
j accept the responsibility of love?
"We no longer have to prove our
selves, we have only to express
ourselves. If wo are a student,
love means that we must study
; very hard.
"For all this you don't need
j God," Reverend Coffin said. "I
hate premature affirmations of
faith. It is not easy for Ihe un
derprivileged rich to become
Christians, and I don't want to
; make it seem easy."
Reverend Coffin did affirm
that there is a God. and that "we
need courage to put religion bc-
I fore our security and before our-
I selves."
