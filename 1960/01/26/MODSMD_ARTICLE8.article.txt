# Other Sites Considered For Linear Accelerator
## 
### 
The Atomic Energy Commission is considering two alternate
sites at Moffett Field and in the East Bay for the two-mile linear
accelerator originally proposed for Stanford, Ellison Shute, man
ager of the San Francisco office of the AEC announced yesterday.
The Stanford site is still under consideration, however, Shute
said the cost of building the huge atom smasher may be susbstan
tially lower at the alternate sites, and they lend themselves to a
cover type of construction rather than the deep tunnel proposed at
Stanford.
Professor Edward Leonard Ginzton, Stanford Professor of

Applied Physics and/ Electrical
Engineering, stated that there are
I other sites on Stanford property
which are equally as suitable as
the proposed tunnel site.
Stanford lias not yet considered
whether thoy will be willing to
reserve land for the project in
sites other than the one originally
chosen for the accelerator. The
decision is up to the Board of
Trustees.
Gin/ton said that the important
thing was to have the accelerator
research facilities near the Uni
versity so Stanford's scientists
can participate in the project
without obstructing their normal
academic life.
Shute said the AEC is firmly
committed to building the linear
accelerator at or near Stanford
because Stanford's scientific team
is believed to be the only one in
the nation with the technical
know-how to operate the huge
atom smasher.
The AEC will submit a com
plete cost and site analysis, to
gether with a recommendation of
a specific site, within the next
few weeks.
The report will go to the joint
â– Sen a t e - House Committee on
Atomic Energy, which later will
submit a recommendation of its
own to Congress. It will be up to
Congress to appropriate funds
for the project.
