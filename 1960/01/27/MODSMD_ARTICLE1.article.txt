# Baran Says Disarming Nesessary
## 
### Ross Hermann 
Disarmament is the key to the
future of competition between
capitalism and socialism, Paul A.
Baran. Stanford professor of eco
nomics, claimed last night before
a large audience in Memorial
Auditorium.
His talk, the third of the Tues
day Evening Series, was entitled
"East and West: the Competition
Between Two Economic Sys
tems."
He said that the outcome of the
economic competition might be
an amalgam in the form of a
world socialistic commonwealth.
Such a development depends,
however, on the maintenance of
peace, which can only be assured
through disarmament.
Socialism Can Work
In answer to a question, Baran
said in effect that it would be
advantageous for the United
States to adopt a socialist econ
omy.
Throughout his talk Baran at
tempted to demonstrate that so
cialism can work. He refuted the
widespread view, held by Max
Weber, that socialism is but a
"Utopian mirage."
He admitted that history has
been cruel to most economic
theories but said that it has been
equally as devastating to this
view. The survival of the Soviet
economy during World War II
and its subsequent creation of the
"world's most powerful" military
machine has shown that socialism
can succeed.
Economies Must Grow
Baran said that in the com
petition of socialism and capital
ism the niceties of life and civili
zation seem to be irrelevant. The
important tiling is the capacity of
the economy "to grow and to
grow rapidly." he said that
growth is more likely to take
place under socialsim because
planning leads to efficiency.
To support these statements he
cited the figure that Soviet gross
national product, has increased
four to five per cent a year in the
last 10 years. He said that this is
five times greater than tiro United
States.
Teachers 'Baby Sitters'
He claimed also that socialism
is functioning better in the field
of education. Teachers are a
scarcity and many are nothing
more than "glorified baby sitters,"
while some subjects are being
neglected.
On the other hand, Russia has
virtually wiped out the wide
spread illiteracy of pre-revolu
tionary days and has attained an
academic level in its schools that
is comparable to the upper class
secondary schools of Western
Europe.

Teachers 'Baby Sitters'
He claimed also that socialism
is functioning better in the field
of education. Teachers are a
scarcity and many are nothing
more than "glorified baby sitters,"
while some subjects are being
neglected.
On the other hand, Russia has
virtually wiped out the wide
spread illiteracy of pre-revolu
tionary days and has attained an
academic level in its schools that
is comparable to the upper class
secondary schools of Western
Europe.


FALL A. BARAN
An Amalgam
Disarmament is the key to the
future of competition between
capitalism and socialism, Paul A.
Baran. Stanford professor of eco
nomics, claimed last night before
a large audience in Memorial
Auditorium.
His talk, the third of the Tues
day Evening Series, was entitled
"East and West: the Competition
Between Two Economic Sys
tems."
He said that the outcome of the
economic competition might be
an amalgam in the form of a
world socialistic commonwealth.
Such a development depends,
however, on the maintenance of
peace, which can only be assured
through disarmament.
Socialism Can Work
In answer to a question, Baran
said in effect that it would be
advantageous for the United
States to adopt a socialist econ
omy.
Throughout his talk Baran at
tempted to demonstrate that so
cialism can work. He refuted the
widespread view, held by Max
Weber, that socialism is but a
"Utopian mirage."
He admitted that history has
been cruel to most economic
theories but said that it has been
equally as devastating to this
view. The survival of the Soviet
economy during World War II
and its subsequent creation of the
"world's most powerful" military
machine has shown that socialism
can succeed.
Economies Must Grow
Baran said that in the com
petition of socialism and capital
ism the niceties of life and civili
zation seem to be irrelevant. The
important tiling is the capacity of
the economy "to grow and to
grow rapidly." he said that
growth is more likely to take
place under socialsim because
planning leads to efficiency.
To support these statements he
cited the figure that Soviet gross
national product, has increased
four to five per cent a year in the
last 10 years. He said that this is
five times greater than tiro United
States.
