# SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS
## Three Lagunita Houses Secede From Dormitory 
### Marilyn Moore 
Cries of "Secession!" and the slogan "Sic Semper Tyrannis" are
echoing throughout half of Lagunita Court whore women are pro
testing against a unified dormitory. It's "East" vs. "West" rather
than "North" against "South" as the women of Adelpha, Eucalipto,
and Granada join forces in attempting to establish individual gov-

ernments rather than remain part
of Lagunita.
At house meeting Monday it
proposed revisions of the Lagu
nita constitution were presented,
which included the elimination of
two court officers instead of
abolishing I hem all as the "West
erners" favored. The necessity of
passage was stressed as officers
had to be elected by Feb. 13 in
accordance with plans of the As
sociated Women Students.
Though the constitution was
passed in five houses, the resent
ment towards "railroading" was
strong. The spirit of rebellion
grew when women in the sixth
house, Eucalipto, unanimously re
fused to vote on (he proposed re
visions. When residents in Gra
nada and Adelpha heard of this
action they joined in. After an
evening of excited caucuses, a
"protest march" began in Gra
nada to the strains of "Battle
Hymn of the Republic."
Parliamentarian Rules
Yesterday, by a ruling from
ASSU Parliamentarian John Bas
sett, the Eucalipto refusal to vote
was treated as an abstention, and
each vote was counted "as if on
the prevailing side." The revisions
were thus passed by the required
two-thirds majority, and went to
the AWS Excom for approval
yesterday afternoon.
Due to the dissention within
the Court, President Lynne
Berthiume asked that the AWS
Excom take no action, allowing
time for alternate proposals to
be studied.
'Up to Girls'
This desire for unity is in ac
cord with the University policy
of independent house, said Di
rector Dorothy Wright, emphasiz
ing that the issue was "entirely
up to the girls."
No one seems to consider what
might happen if no new plans are
presented. Maybe that would be
the signal for the "scalleywags"
and "carpetbaggers" to take over.
