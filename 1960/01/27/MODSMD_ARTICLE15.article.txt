Hdi tor's Note: In answer to
several inquiries about letters,
there is at present a large
backlog which prevents their
being published as soon as re
ceived. Letters remaining at the
end oI this Daily volume (Fri
day) will of course be turned
over to the succeeding volume.
Long Range Notice
ICditor, The Daily:
This letter concerns the possi
ble rise in tuition discussed in
ST & T. The reasons for raising
the tuition may be sound 1 won't
discuss them in this letter. But I
object to the relatively short no
tice the administration gives on
matter's of expense to students.
On both tuition and room and
board matters, it is very possible
(and has happened to most stu
dents now at Stanford) for a stu
dent to have attended Stanford
for a year* or more, so that he has
a monetary and other stake in a
Stanford education, and then to

I be informed that his last year or
two at school will cost him con
siderably more than he had plan
! Ned on.
1 feel that Stanford has an obli
gation to adopt some policy such
as the following:
Every year, in each pamphlet
which discusses costs, to state
| plainly the University's planned
j or realistically estimated changes
I in tuition, room and board, and
: other costs, for the next tour or
five years; and then to consider
| this statement as more or less
! binding. Vague statements about
raised scholarships aren't enough
: I o solve a problem which affects
all Hie students in the University.
Until the policy is in force, I
also suggest that the present
: freshmen and sophomores be
I spared this pr oblem by making
next year's freshman class the
! first to pay more than the pres
ent tuition at any time dining
their years here they will be
prepared for it.
