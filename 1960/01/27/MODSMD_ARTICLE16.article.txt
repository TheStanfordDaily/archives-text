on one program: The Clod, Ways
and Means and Bedtime Story.
The theater is located at 642
High Street, in the same build
ing, same floor and adjacent to
the coffee house - night club

so playing in Palo Alto this week
end at the Palo Alto Community
Theater. Middleficld and Melville,
Friday and Saturday nights.
If you're in ihe mood (and
chips) for dinner before the show,
an excellent place to go would
be Vieux Carre, 4361 El Camino.
Specializing in New Orleans and
Southern dishes, the restaurant is
open daily except Tuesdays, din
ners served from 5 to 10 p.m.
But if you must know the
prices before ordering, plan on
having to make a telephone call
— the phone's in the kitchen
and the price list is posted next
to it. It's the only way you'll
find out. Actually, the prices
are pretty reasonable ($4 for a
New York cut steak with most
other dinners priced at $2.50
and $3). Food and service are
excellent.
Tomorrow night at Ihe Opera
House at 8:30, Johnny Green will
conduct Ihe San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra in the first of
lour special evening concerts.
Soprano Mary Costa will be
Green's guest artist for the eve
ning and will sing highlights
from both opera and Broadway
productions.
Orchestral works will include
Nicolai's Overture to "The Merry
Wives of Windsor," Strauss'
waltzes from "Dor Rosenkava
lier" and Tschaikowsky's Capric
cio Italien. Tickets, priced from
$2 to $3, are available at the S. F.
Opera-Symphony Box Office and
at Bay Area ticket agencies.
Cornelia Otis Skinner and
Cyril Ritchard open at the
Geary Theater in San Fran
cisco tonight. The play? "The
Pleasure of His Company"
written by Samuel Taylor in
conjunction with Miss Skinner.
Including tape recordings of
log horns in the Bay, the
comedy is set in San Francisco
and is about a father who re
turns home after an absence of
15 years and subsequently dis
rupts the household on the eve
of his daughter's wedding to an
earnest young rancher.
Leo J. Carroll and Conrad

Nagel have tire principal support
ing roles. Directed by Ritchard,
the production will play nightly
except Sunday with matinees on
Wednesday and Saturday after
noons.
Beginning Friday evening at
the Opera House, ihe famed Bal
let Russe de Monte Carlo will
give five performances featuring
Alicia Alonso and Igor Youske
vitch. Friday night's program will
include the ballet "Gisell;" Satur
day's matinee, "Sylphides;" and
in the performances Saturday and
Sunday nights and Sunday after
noon, "Swan Lake" will be pre
sented. Tickets range from $2 to
$■4. The Ballet will also give one
performance at the San Jose
Civic Auditorium Monday night.
"Voyage to the Moon,'' Offen
bach's opera based on a story
written by Jules Verne, will be
presented Monday, 8:30 p.m.,
at the W'ar Memorial Opera
House in the City by the Boston
Opera Company.
Tickets for the performance,
which marks the annual fund
raising theater party for the P"x
periment in International Living,
are priced from $2 to $4. Tickets
may be reserved by calling Dr.
William Allaway, Assistant Dean
of Men, who is a member of the
Board of Directors for the Bay
Area of the Experiment, at Wil
bur Hall, or at DA 6-2006.
The Peninsula Lit lie Theater of
the' College of San Mateo is cur
rently presenting The Warrior's
Husband at the Hillbarn Theater,
1800 El Camino Real, San Mateo.
Written by Julian Thompson,
the three-act play takes place in
and around the Amazonian court
of Hippolyta where the women
go off to war and the men stay
in the background and keep
house.
Whereas other authors and
playwrites have delightfully
suceeeded with the device of in
serting contemporary language
and ideas into an ancient set
ting, Thompson's attempt at
this failed.
Perhaps if the production had
been better staged (the playing
area of lire quaint but small
theater just isn't made for the
20-somo actors who crowded it in
several scenes) perhaps if the
performers had shown more
stage presence and a knowledge
of what they were supposed to
be doing (Patricia Taylor as Hip
polyta was one of the few excep
tions to the latter) or perhaps if
it had been directed more judici
ously. . . .
The play has a few entertain
ing moments, but, unfortunately,
(in tins opinion anyway) not
much else. You can see for your
self on Friday and Saturday
nights at 8:30, however.

Whereas other authors and

suceeeded with the device of in
serting contemporary language
and ideas into an ancient set
ting, Thompson's attempt at
this failed.
Perhaps if the production had
been better staged (the playing
area of lire quaint but small
theater just isn't made for the
20-somo actors who crowded it in
several scenes) perhaps if the
performers had shown more
stage presence and a knowledge
of what they were supposed to
be doing (Patricia Taylor as Hip
polyta was one of the few excep

it had been directed more judici

this failed.
Perhaps if the production had
been better staged (the playing
area of lire quaint but small
