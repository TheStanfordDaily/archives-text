### Rich Sundeen ASSU President 
On the first weekend of this
quarter, Legislature went to Big
I Sur for its annual hostel. Several
i problems faced in not only ASSU
activities, but by this generation
of students in general, were dis
cussed. Legislature also formu
lated various ideas and projects
to be carried out throughout the
year.
One of the needs of our Univer
sity community as seen by Legis
lature is a permanent hostel site,
j easily accessible from the cam
pus, yet somewhat isolated. The
advantages of such a central loca
; tion are multifarious.
The site could serve as a means
by which students, faculty, and
1 non-university personnel can meet
on an informal basis and ex
change ideas from their diverse
backgrounds. Ji was felt that the
site, if close enough to campus,
would lie constantly utilized for
all-campus hostels and even more
readily for student organization
i hostels.
Since the Legislature hostel,
! Hostels Board formulated a pro
posal for a hostel site to be built
on Stanford lands within a year.
Of course, much work and prep

aration must be done before any
concrete plans can be presented.
This has already started with
ihe formation of an ad hoc com
mittee of Legislature in order
to commence necessary planning.
This year's hostel program, un
der the capable leadership of
John Nickerson, has been success
! ful. Thus, it is appropriate that
j at this time this step be made to
ward expanding the program, so
that in future years hosteling will
j become one of the cenlral cam
pus activities of academic orienta
t ion.
A second Legislature item of
interest to students is Senior Col
loquia. This is the first year that
| Senior Colloquia have been re
quired for all A.R candidates.
t Various opinions have been voiced
lon the program throughout Ihe
last year.
The Legislature has under
taken a study of the Senior Col
loquia in hopes of presenting
i some conclusions and recommen
dations to the General Studies
| Office.
Anyone wishing 1o present
j criticisms or suggestions should
contact his or her Legislature
| representative. Hal Green, Toyon
representative and Ralph Dudley,
Off-Campus representative, are in
charge of this study.
