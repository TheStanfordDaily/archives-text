this year's campaign, which is
headed by Rich Guggenhime and
Becky Schaaf of the Cardinals'

year's drive will surpass last
year's total of $1800. This was
collected from an undergraduate
enrollment of about .1000. 1
Collections in Living; Groups
Collections will take place in
living groups with either the pres
ident of each group or his ap
pointed agents doing the actual
collecting. Special recognition will
go to those groups which come

more than 42 health, welfare and
youth agencies it serves.
Money gathered also will go to
ward fighting the country's num

extensive, important research and

fied Negroes to obtain admission

total enrollment at non-segregated
colleges and universities is Negro,
yet over 10 per cent of the na
tion's population is Negro.

Negro Fund
The Negro fund enables quali
fied Negroes to obtain admission
and scholarship assistance at the
institutions of their choice by
providing counseling and other
services.
The need for the fund is re
flected in statistics which show
that less than one per cent of the
total enrollment at non-segregated
colleges and universities is Negro,
yet over 10 per cent of the na
tion's population is Negro.
Stanford students will be asked
to dig into their wallets and coin
purses Monday and donate some
thing to the annual Winter Drive,
the only major charity contribu
tion requested of students during
the school year, the Cardinals an
nounced yesterday.
Starting Monday and ending
next Friday, the drive will benefit
the Santa Clara County United
Fund, the Heart Association and
the National Scholarship Service
and Fund for Negro Students.
"Dollar Days" is the theme of
this year's campaign, which is
headed by Rich Guggenhime and
Becky Schaaf of the Cardinals'
Drives Committee.
Guggenhime said he hopes this
year's drive will surpass last
year's total of $1800. This was
collected from an undergraduate
enrollment of about .1000. 1
