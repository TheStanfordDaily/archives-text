Supports Oath
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to go on record as vio
lently disagreeing with your edi
torial cartoon that was published
in the Stanford Daily, 19 January
1960. Since when is a loyalty oath
to the United States to be corn
par* d with a grubby hug that one
may find in his soup?
Many lives have been given for
the United States and our way of
life. Countless millions have suf
fered to preserve the freedoms
that we have today. . . .
Is it too much to ask of to
day's students to say that they
are loyal, that they support, that
they want this form of govern
ment? Is it too much to ask of a
person to say under oath that he
will support the government, the
same government that is willing
to loan him money to continue
his schooling?
1 should hope not. When the
day comes that we, as Americans,
are afraid to stand up and say
that we are proud of this country,
that we support our way of life
and our form of government, and
that we are willing to stand up to
anyone or any country that
threatens to destroy our ideals,
then, gentlemen, Ihe battle for
freedom is lost.
Then is the time that the com
munists can stand up and rejoice
over their victory. That day will
be an infamous blot on the pages
of American history forever.

Monday morning an article ap- !
peared stating that tickets to the
Andrew Segovia concert were to
be on sale at 1 o'clock that after
noon. Interested people were ad
vised to get to the Nit cry early
because there were only 75

The interested people arrived
50 strong by 12:30. But they didn't
get the tickets! The first three
purchasers bought 60 of the 75,
and the last tickets were sold
to the ninth person in line.
There is one obvious and ab

torial cartoon that was published
in the Stanford Daily, 19 January
1960. Since when is a loyalty oath
to the United States to be corn
par* d with a grubby hug that one
may find in his soup?
Many lives have been given for
the United States and our way of
life. Countless millions have suf
fered to preserve the freedoms
that we have today. . . .
Is it too much to ask of to
day's students to say that they
are loyal, that they support, that
they want this form of govern
ment? Is it too much to ask of a
person to say under oath that he
will support the government, the
same government that is willing
to loan him money to continue
his schooling?
1 should hope not. When the
day comes that we, as Americans,
are afraid to stand up and say
that we are proud of this country,
that we support our way of life
and our form of government, and
that we are willing to stand up to
anyone or any country that
threatens to destroy our ideals,
then, gentlemen, Ihe battle for
freedom is lost.
Then is the time that the com
munists can stand up and rejoice
over their victory. That day will
be an infamous blot on the pages
of American history forever.

Monday morning an article ap- !
peared stating that tickets to the
Andrew Segovia concert were to
be on sale at 1 o'clock that after
noon. Interested people were ad
vised to get to the Nit cry early
because there were only 75
ticket:;.
The interested people arrived
50 strong by 12:30. But they didn't
get the tickets! The first three
purchasers bought 60 of the 75,
and the last tickets were sold
to the ninth person in line.
There is one obvious and ab
solutely necessary remedy to the
situation. Set a limit of two tick-1

ots por customer. Those who
won't wait in line won't attend!
