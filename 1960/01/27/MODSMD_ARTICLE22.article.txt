# Hot Tribe Cagers Set for Beavers
## 
### Glen Alford 
The Oregon State Beavers are out for revenge when they invade
The Farm on Friday night. Stanford beat OSC 43-38 in a game early
in the season.
Stanford goes into the game with a four game winning streak
that has pulled them to third place in the AAYVU. Despite the third

place in the standings, Stanford
has lost no more games than Cali
fornia, the conference leader, in
league play.
Indian coach Howie Dallmar
will probably go with the starting
lineup he used in beating Wash
ington State on Monday. At
guards will he John Arrillaga,
loading Stanford scorer, and Bub
Bowling, the Stanford playmaker
all season. Arrillaga at 6-3 will
lend height that Stanford will
need, as the Indians are fully an
inch -shorter than the Beavers in
the front line.
A 1 center, Neal Brockmeyer
will probably start over Jo h n
Windsor, who started the Wash
ington State game at forward.
The forward position will pose a
problem to Dallmar. He has to
decide who will be hot.
.Windsor and John Hendry
started against Washington State,
but Jerry Thuesen put in six
points in the overtime period, so
it is anybody's guess who will
start.
Againsl Stanford, Oregon Stale
will probably go with Jim Wood
land and Bill Wold at the guards,
Jay Carty and Steve Flynn at

forward, and Karl Anderson at
center. All five of the Beaver
starters hail from California,
with of them from the Bay Area.
Flynn, 6-4, is from Mountain
View, Woodland is from San
Francisco, and Karl Anderson
the team's leading scorer is
from Oakland.
The Beavers' big strength is
their balanced scoring. Anderson,
Carty, and Woodland are virtual
ly neck and neck for top honors.
Anderson can pull down plenty of
rebounds, and it will be Brock
meyer's job to stop him. "Brock"
and Hendry are tied for fifith
place in AAWU statistics for re
bounds.
The Indian's scoring threat of
Arrillaga will be Stanford's chief
hope to stop Oregon State, along
wiih the new found scoring power
of Neal Brockmeyer and any of
the forwards that Dallmar
chooses to start.

the forwards that Dallmar
chooses to start.
The Oregon State Beavers are out for revenge when they invade
The Farm on Friday night. Stanford beat OSC 43-38 in a game early
in the season.
Stanford goes into the game with a four game winning streak
that has pulled them to third place in the AAYVU. Despite the third

place in the standings, Stanford
has lost no more games than Cali
fornia, the conference leader, in
league play.
Indian coach Howie Dallmar
will probably go with the starting
lineup he used in beating Wash
ington State on Monday. At
guards will he John Arrillaga,
loading Stanford scorer, and Bub
Bowling, the Stanford playmaker
all season. Arrillaga at 6-3 will
lend height that Stanford will
need, as the Indians are fully an
inch -shorter than the Beavers in
the front line.
A 1 center, Neal Brockmeyer
will probably start over Jo h n
Windsor, who started the Wash
ington State game at forward.
The forward position will pose a
problem to Dallmar. He has to
decide who will be hot.
.Windsor and John Hendry
started against Washington State,
but Jerry Thuesen put in six
points in the overtime period, so
it is anybody's guess who will
start.
Againsl Stanford, Oregon Stale
will probably go with Jim Wood
land and Bill Wold at the guards,
Jay Carty and Steve Flynn at

forward, and Karl Anderson at
center. All five of the Beaver
starters hail from California,
with of them from the Bay Area.
Flynn, 6-4, is from Mountain
View, Woodland is from San
Francisco, and Karl Anderson
the team's leading scorer is
from Oakland.
The Beavers' big strength is
their balanced scoring. Anderson,
Carty, and Woodland are virtual
ly neck and neck for top honors.
Anderson can pull down plenty of
rebounds, and it will be Brock
meyer's job to stop him. "Brock"
and Hendry are tied for fifith
place in AAWU statistics for re
bounds.
The Indian's scoring threat of
Arrillaga will be Stanford's chief
hope to stop Oregon State, along
wiih the new found scoring power
of Neal Brockmeyer and any of
the forwards that Dallmar
chooses to start.
