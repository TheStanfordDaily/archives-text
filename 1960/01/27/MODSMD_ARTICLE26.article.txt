Oil Takes lis Time
Our friends across the* Bay are having a helluva lime finding a
now head football coach and now it's beginning to look like the
new man is harclly going to be named before spring practice starts.
Pete Elliott, who must have more friends than any man alive, is
off for Illinois.
Remember when Pete came on the scene at Berkeley three years
ago? Seniors might remember anyway. The San Francisco press
and University of Cuifornia hailed his appointment as sort of tanta
mount to instant football supremacy. Sure enough, Pete had the
Bears in the Kose Bowl by IDSS (one of the West Coast's biggest
farces).
That Kose Bowl year represents the only decent season on
Flliotfs record. No doubt tic is

an immensely popular man and
gets along fine everywhere he
goes, but .just why he is such a
red-hot coaching prospect has al
ways been sort of a mystery.
In four years of head coach
ing, Hlliott put together a scintil
lating 14-27 record. That's 4-(i ;it
Nebraska, and 1-9, 8-4 and !i-X at
C'al. Without Joe Kapp's inspiring
presence in 1958 all four of those
seasons might have been losers.
Cal apparently isn't the hot
coaching haven one would think
it is or there ought to be ;i new
coach up there by now. Any
school with 20,000 students has
potential. The Bears are turning
out a brilliant succession of bas
ketball teams; but are never any
thing spectacular in track; have
had only occasional successes in
baseball, and are wretched in the
minor sports.
Anyway, Cal is keeping the
press on its toes. Things were so

confused last week that the Ex
aminer had Eddie Erdelatz in the job, the Chronicle had !><><> Andros
ready to take over, and the News-Call Bulletin said there would be
no announcement for a month. All this was printed on the same
day, yet.
Of course, as usual, the City press continues to emphasize what
rugged entrance requirements C'al has probably the most rugged in
these parts. Athletes have to have something upstairs to make it
into C'al. Maybe we can run a few IQ tests on Stanford vs. C'al ath
lete and see what happens.
Arrillaga Fills the Hole
The Card basketball team is back today from what must he con
sidered a highly successful trip to the Northwest. Saturday night,
the Indians ran all over a Washington team that they had really
struggled to beat down here. Monday they tinned on the power in
the clutch and got by a sophomorish Washington State team that can
be pretty potent on some occasions.
So now Stanford edges above the .500 mark and is beginning to
make what was supposed to be a dreary season pretty bright. John
Arrillaga, the senior guard who was supposed to carry most of the
scoring load this season, has come through in fine style.
Arrillaga unfortunately has had to fill the shoes of one Paul
Neumann in the Indian baekcourt. He is no Neumann when it comes
to pure natural talent jumping, -speed, etc. But Arrillaga HAS been
providing the Tribe with that needed backcourt scoring punch. He
has shot better than 40 per cent from thef loor (outstanding for a
distance-shooting guard) and his free throw shooting definitely has
been along the lines of Neumannâ€”great.
'lolin s one bad moment this season may have come in Hie St.
Mary's game in December when he missed a jumper 12 seconds
befoie the gun and the score tied. The Gaels got the rebound and
won the game as the final buzzer sounded.
But Monday he sort of atoned for that with his great clutch play
in Pullman. And up against the toughies, he's shown plenty of
class. In the Los Angeles Classic during the holidays, he had 1(5
against West Virginia, 19 against Michigan and 23 against Illinois.
