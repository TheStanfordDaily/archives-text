# De Gaulle Blasts Algier Blockades
## 
### 
PARIS '(/P) President Charles de Gaulle was reported far ahead
J of other French government leaders last night in his resolve to
remove barricades from the streets of Algiers.
While censored dispatches told of general strikes and demonstra
tions of varying sizes in all major Algerian cities, De Gaulle con-

j ferred with top colleagues on the
j uprising of French settlers
j against his policy of self-deter-
I mination for Algeria.
It was De Gaulle's insistence on
the right of the Algerian people
a million European settlers and
nine million North Africans to
; choose their own future that led
i to the Algerian uprising Sunday
j in which 24 persons were killed.
Wants Dictatorial Powers
The order in which the Presi-
I dent called his colleagues to his
office indicated he might be con
sidering the constitutional provi
sion allowing him to assume dic
tatorial powers if lie feels
! France's integrity is threatened.
Premier Michel Debre, Defense
| Minister Pierre Guillaumat and
I Jacques Chaban Delmas. presi
dent of the National Assembly,
| were on his list of visitors at the
presidential palace. De Gaulle
I canceled a scheduled Cabinet
i meeting.
The desire to end the deadly
impasse without further blood
shod between the French insur
gents and the troops that ring
their barricades appeared to be
the aim of almost everyone in
j Paris.
Censorship Imposed
In Algiers private scources
said the government halted all
unofficial communications vester
| day at 3:30 p.m. No government
official would comment, but the
informants said only official dis
patches were moving. Several
hours after, censored press copy
began arriving in Paris again.
A censored dispatch from Al
giers indicated the morale of the
I insurgents was high.
"We're winning everywhere,"
! declared one insurgent in the
khaki uniform of the territorial
l militia. "We don't give a damn for
politics."
The insurgent leaders are Pierre
Lagaillarde, 28, a fiery former
j paratrooper with a black goatee
! and what he considers a mission
to keep Algeria French, and Jos-
I eph Ortiz, 47, a cafe owner and
j rightist political organizer.
