# Disease, Tension Related?

Is there a possibility that man's
social environment, the stresses
and strains of life, contribute to
diseases as much as bacilli and
viruses?
Edmund Volkhart, associate
professor of sociology who spoke
last night, thinks there is a def
inite relationship between disease
and social stress.
"There has long been the
theory, know as the germ theory,
that the human organism is in
conflict with microorganisms
which attack the body," Volkhart
said. "However, there are certain
factors recently discovered which
indicate that the germ theory is
not always valid."
Epidemic Immunity
"For instance, how is it that
during epidemics the whole popu
lations is not wiped out ? And how
come certain people carry around
dangerous bacilli but never break
down with the disease?"
The answers might lie with so
cial factors. Volkhart believes.
"There is the possibility that hu
mans suffer less physically when
their society is in comparative
equilibrium," Volkhart maintains.
"For instance, at the outbreak of!
World War I cases of tuberculosis
in Western Europe rose sharply,
then diminished when the war
ended."
Post-War Problems
"However, in 1922 when the
Germans were suffering from eco
nomical and social problems due
lo post-war problems, tuberculosis
again rose sharply," he continued.
"The fact also exists that
people between the age of 10 and
20 have the highest tuberculosis
rate. It is well known that tho i
adolescent years are times of
great social stress.
"Maybe it is this social stress
theory which can explain why
certain people succumb during
epidemics and others don't. Maybe
this explains why certain people
only carry dangerous bacteria
and others break down with the
disease," Volkhart said.
One thing is certain. Volkhart
said. The fields of medicine and ;
social science will have to work
more closely in the future to dis
cover all of the reasons for the j
diseases that plague man.
