# No Intervention In Cuba, Says Ike
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/I 3 ) - President Eisenhower yesterday laid down a policy of no intervention
and no reprisals at this time against Cuba despite what he called Communist intrigues and unwar
ranted attacks on the United States by Fidel Castro.
But Eisenhower left the way open fur a tougher stand and specific action later on, if he sees a
need. And, in what amounted to a solid rebuke of Castro, as a diplomatic language goes, he drew a

distinct line between the Cuban
Prime Minister and the Cuban
people.
Also at the conference, the
President defended new intelli
gence estimates cited by Penta
gon leaders in claiming there is
no gap in U.S. power to deter the
Soviet Union from attacking.
But Chairman Richard B. Rus
sell (D-Ga.) of the Senate Armed
Services Committee told news
men "I think we are woefully be
hind in the missile program."
Eisenhower backed up his secre
tary of defense, Thomas S. Gates
Jr., who has been under running
attack by some congressional
Democrats.
What aroused the Democrats
was Gates' statement last week
that intelligence evaluations now
are based on what U.S. officials
believe the Soviets probably will
do. rather than what they are ca
pable of doing.
Demos Misleading
This change, the Democrats
contend, puts this country's de
fense position in a better light
than is warranted.
The President contended that
both intention and capability
must be taken into consideration
in making any intelligence esti
mate.
Cuba however was the number
one topic. It was the subject, too,
of a formal presidential restate
ment of U.S. policy handed to
newsmen as they left the con
ference room.
The policy statement wound up
the conference going further in a
single sentence than the adminis
tration ever has before in spelling
out a belief among Eisenhower
adbisers that some Cuban leaders
sympathize with communism and
embrace its views.
Trust in People
"I should like only to add," Ei
senhower said, "that the United
States government has confidence
in the ability of the Cuban people
to recognize and defeat the in
trigues of international commu
nism which are aimed to destroy
ing democratic institutions in Cu
ba and the traditional and mu
tually beneficial friendship be
tween the Cuban and American
peoples."
The President's position on Cu
ba was set out following two days
of conferences among Eisen
hower, Secretary of State Chris
tian A. Herter and the U.S. am
bassador to Cuba, Philip W. Bon
sal.
Deep Concern
Eisenhower said all three have
been deeply concerned for many
months at a steady deterioration
of relations with Cuba, as reflect
ed especially in recent statements
by Castro and his government.
Bonsai was summoned back
from Cuba after Castro, in a TV
broadcast last week, accused the
U.S. Embassy of collaborating
with foes of his government. He
also denounced Vice President
Richard M. Nixon.

of relations with Cuba, as reflect

WASHINGTON (/I 3 ) - President Eisenhower yesterday laid down a policy of no intervention
and no reprisals at this time against Cuba despite what he called Communist intrigues and unwar
ranted attacks on the United States by Fidel Castro.
But Eisenhower left the way open fur a tougher stand and specific action later on, if he sees a
need. And, in what amounted to a solid rebuke of Castro, as a diplomatic language goes, he drew a

distinct line between the Cuban
Prime Minister and the Cuban
people.
Also at the conference, the
President defended new intelli
gence estimates cited by Penta
gon leaders in claiming there is
no gap in U.S. power to deter the
Soviet Union from attacking.
But Chairman Richard B. Rus
sell (D-Ga.) of the Senate Armed
Services Committee told news
men "I think we are woefully be
hind in the missile program."
Eisenhower backed up his secre
tary of defense, Thomas S. Gates
Jr., who has been under running
attack by some congressional
Democrats.
What aroused the Democrats
was Gates' statement last week
that intelligence evaluations now
are based on what U.S. officials
believe the Soviets probably will
do. rather than what they are ca
pable of doing.
Demos Misleading
This change, the Democrats
contend, puts this country's de
fense position in a better light
than is warranted.
The President contended that
both intention and capability
must be taken into consideration
in making any intelligence esti
mate.
Cuba however was the number
one topic. It was the subject, too,
of a formal presidential restate
ment of U.S. policy handed to
newsmen as they left the con
ference room.
The policy statement wound up
the conference going further in a
single sentence than the adminis
tration ever has before in spelling
out a belief among Eisenhower
adbisers that some Cuban leaders
sympathize with communism and
embrace its views.
Trust in People
"I should like only to add," Ei
senhower said, "that the United
States government has confidence
in the ability of the Cuban people
to recognize and defeat the in
trigues of international commu
nism which are aimed to destroy
ing democratic institutions in Cu
ba and the traditional and mu
tually beneficial friendship be
tween the Cuban and American
peoples."
The President's position on Cu
ba was set out following two days
of conferences among Eisen
hower, Secretary of State Chris
tian A. Herter and the U.S. am
bassador to Cuba, Philip W. Bon
sal.
