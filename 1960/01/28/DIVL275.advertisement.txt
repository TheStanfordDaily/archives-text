ITS WHATS UP FRONT THAT COUNTS
This filter, be it e'er so pure and white
Must needs give flavor too, full clear and bright
Else would the trusting smoker, filled with hope
Again be dashed, dejected be ... and mope.
And thus we come to Winston's obvious truth
It's what's up front that counts — and 'tis, forsooth
In that the fine tobaccos, in the end
Are by exclusive process —Filter-Blend —
Become the tastiest taste that e'er hath played
Across your dancing taste-buds, man or maid!
Be ye not slow, therefore, to test the wit
Of what we say: that Winston, friend, is it;
For that with ev'ry smoke ye do delay
Ye are not gath'ring rosebuds while ye may!
"We arc advertised by our loving friends.."
