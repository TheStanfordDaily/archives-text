# SRI Report Notes U.S. Problems
## 
### 
Scientific development is like
ly lo create or intensify problems
of United States foreign policy
unless new measures are taken,
according to a Stanford Research
Institute report to the U.S.
Senate.
In a study of possible nonmili
tarv scientific developments and
their potential impact on foreign
policy problems requested of SRI
by the Senate, the institute bases
its pessimistic conclusion on the
current imbalance of research.
Eugene Stanley and Guy Ben
eveniste believe the overemphasis
on the physical and biological
sciences is cause for grave con
cern, since foreign policy prob
lems are mainly problems in hu
man relations which need psycho
logical and social science treat
ment.
Interesting Predictions
Predictions made by the two
include the use of new drugs to
heighten the suggestibility of a
population or to cure mental ill
ness; the application of motiva
tional research techniques to
foreign policy programs; and the
use of synthetic coffee to expand
international trade.
The establishment of a United
Nations university system on the
graduate level with campuses
throughout the world was anoth
er suggestion.
The report also pointed out the
world's booming rise in popula
tion, noting that the death rate
dropped in the past few years
while the birth rate continues its
steady spiral upward.
International Problems
Thus, "World hunger and popu
lation control . . . present major
long-term international policy
problems to the United States and
to the other nations of the world."
A "possible approach would be
for the United States government
to study . . . the possibility of
providing research funds to cer
tain foreign agencies and labora
tories for the large-scale human
testing of" contraceptive or birth
control devices.
This testing could be done with
other governments, through the
U.N., or bilaterally.
Help Poorer Nations
Th e SRlnvestigators also
wrote: "Can economic and social
development be speeded up
enough to bring real improve
ment and hope to poorer nations
and to rescue the world from the
threat of a calamitous political
drift?"
It is the duty of U.S. foreign
policy to aid the efforts of the
poorer nations to improve them
selves, they said. This can be done
with the aid of "a new, and more
positive, creative use of science
and technology."
