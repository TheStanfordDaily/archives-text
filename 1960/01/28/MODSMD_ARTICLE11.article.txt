NEW HAVEN', Conn. (/P>
! Twenty tense Yale students were
convicted yesterday of sexual mis
conduct with a 14-year-old girl.
Their fines ranged from $25 for
! 17 to $50 each for the others.
Acting City Court Judge Fred
j crick L. Grecnberg accepted pleas
of no contest to charges of las
civious carriage. The charge cov
; ers a variety of sex misdemeanors
! in Connecticut.
"It was an unfortunate inci
i dent" involving Yale's "stupid ele
ment," lie said in a soft voice as
the students stood with heads
bowed.
The parents of some of the stu
dents were in the courtroom,
crowded to its 300-person capac
ity. The young girl, member of a
highly respected family from
nearby Hamden, was not present.
The fines were recommended
by Prosecutor Vincent Villano,
who said in the 20-minute hearing
that the case involved five inci
dents, some in Yale dormitories,
some outside.
Villano stressed that "actually
no sexual intercourse occurred."
The students could have been
sentenced to six months in jail
and fined $100 each.
A spokesman at Yale said 12
of the students already have re
signed "and disciplinary action
will take place forthwith" with
the "cases of the other eight, now
the court trial has been con-
I eluded."
