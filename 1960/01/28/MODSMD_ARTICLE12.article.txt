In response to protests and
threats of secession additional
time has been granted Lagunita
women lor investigation of possi
ble plans of government before
voting on dormitory officers.
Dissension was based on the
so-called "railroading" of Consti
tutional revisions. Behind the dis
satisfaction is a desire for inde
pendent house unity by the abol
ishment of dormitory officers.
Special house meetings were
called last night to elect repre
sentatives to form a committee to
study the constitutions and offi
cer systems in other women's
living groups. The committee is
scheduled to report its findings
on Monday.
After hearing suggestions from
the women, the committee will

i The following day voting wll take
place by secret ballot in Lagunita
lobby. A proposal must receive a
j two-thirds majority to be passed.
