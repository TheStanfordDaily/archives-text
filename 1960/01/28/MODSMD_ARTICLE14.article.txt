# UNDER GOP ADMINISTRATION
## America Is World's Greatest Power, Eisenhower Claims 
### 
LOS ANGELES (/P) — President Eisenhower opened the election
year Republican campaign last night with an assertion that under
his administration America i-s the strongest power on earth, both
militarily and economically.
The President hit back hard at Democratic criticism of the way

he has led the nation in both
those broad fields.
As for the defense and econom
ic programs, Eisenhower said:
'Strongest on Earth'
"Because of our insistence on
adequacy and efficiency, militar
ily and economically our country
is, over-all, the strongest power
on earth."
The President plugged once
more for his proposed balanced
budget with a surplus, and swat
ted at critics in this manner:
"To pay for costly and highly
publicized panaceas for all our
problems, many politicians seem
to believe that money by the bale
can be printed without shrinking
—a kind of sanforized dollar!"
In Washington yesterday, Sen.
Stuart Symington iD-Mo.) ac
cused the Eisenhower administra
tion of juggling intelligence data
"so the budget books may be bal
anced.
'.Missile Gap'
"The facts are that a very sub
stantial missile gap does exist,
and tiie administration apparent
ly is going to permit this gap to
increase," he declared.
Symington, a former Air Force
secretary and longtime foe of ad
ministration military policy, con
tended the U.S. deficit in inter
continental missiles has widened
to more than the 3-1 edge he said
defense officials conceded to the
Soviet Union last year. Counting
shorter range rockets, he said,
"the Soviet advantage would be
greater."
