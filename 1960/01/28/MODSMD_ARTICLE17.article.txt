# The 						Outside View

### 
The picture which a I Diversity presents to the "outside world
should be a matter of great importance lo 1 lie school. How
accurately (his picture portrays the institution will in many
ways he reflected by opinion of and good will toward the school,
and. especially in the case of a private one like Stanford, the
financial support it receives.
In general, the picture of a I niversitv stands to he good when
the positive aspects of its program and situation are seen. Too
often, however, only negative tilings like student disorders or
fraternity suspensions- are seen b\ the outsider. At oilier times,
the outsider draws his impressions of the school from informa
tion like iliis opening paragraph of a letter which was sent b\
I lie Mother's elul> of Stanford to every mother of a Stanford
si udent:
"'I lie holidays are over and the students are hack on the
campus. W inter quarter is dull in comparison to fall and spring
quarters. The weather is often rainv or eloudv; the students will
have colds and there will he more sickness; some skiers will have
casts; classes will he routine, dome spring, life is again won-
I /' I
urn ill.
After reading something like lliis, il's no wonder others think
college life is all fall football games and spring beach parties.
What about the full calendar of excellent speakers this quarter'/'
Certainly the best we've seen in four years here.
What about the improved hostel program this quarter? How
about the Foreign Policy Institute? And even in the spoils ami
social realm, what's so dull about skiing ami basketball?
How about that business that "classes will be routine." IK
routine do they mean ordinary? What's more ordinary about a
w inter class than one in fall or spring? Or do tliev mean that since
il's raining a liltle, there won't be anything lo do hut go to those
mean ol nasty classes. If going to classes isn't a significant part
of the purpose in being here, we'd like to know what is.
To belabor this perhaps-well-meaning but misguided effort
at letting mothers know about their little darlings isn't the real
purpose of this discussion.
The greater purpose is to show how easy it is for the public to
miss out on a true picture of a great I niversity, and to stress that
it is up to everyone here to do his part in making the true picture
more commonly known.
