## ONE OPINION 
### 
This is the beginning of the
end.
Not that it's terribly sad, but
this columnist retires today—and
so young, too!
Being a columnist is an in
teresting experience. Granted
it's one that seems to have
much inherent excitement, hnt
it's also one that has recurring
headaches.
Week after week a columnist
faces the problem: What to write
about? Or maybe: "Which friend
to please (or nix) today? Then,
too, there comes the time to de
cide where to tread lightly, and
where one may stomp without
fear.
But this boils it all down to too
simple a proposition. For above
all, above topic, crusade, affilia
tion, there exists a very important
responsibility to write what is in
teresting, and what is column ma
terial.
No columnist can expect to
please every reader every time.
Most don't even try. Others
never intend to. But somewhere
between the "let's please every
body" and "here's for a few"
theories there lies the correct
approach.
It manifests itself in thoughts
which take a "subject with more
than limited appeal" line, and also
include, most of the lime, a
"worth the lime and thought"
clause.
Further, although it seems not
so to those who seek a mention
here and there, no columnist can
or should be required to tackle
anything that comes along and
should go in a column some
where.
There's a very entertaining
treatise 011 columnists some
where, and it goes something
like this:
A columnist is a person who
knows a little bit about a lot of
things, and continues to know less
and less about more and more
until he knows nothing about
cveryt hing.
Or, a columnist is a person who
knows an awful lot about a little
bit, and continues to know more
and more about less and lessi
until he knows everything about 1
nothing.
Something about those state
ments makes me think they
were penned by somebody who
doesn't like the group. Not he

, ing of that particular inclina
tion, I pass lightly over it. for
fear I will agree (thus mak
ing myself and cohorts boobs)
or disagree (and face the pros
pect of seeming too all-mighty).
One thing is true of columnists,
112 know. You either face the pros
pect of writing your column with
little or nothing on the line, or
j else you have too much to write
I about, are forced to leave some
material out, and then the rest
gets too old to get back to.
For instance, the following
columns will never be written at
j least not by mo.
In general the switchboard
operators at female dorms on
this campus are the most nasty,
curt, inconsiderate, impolite,
and discourteous people it has
ever been my misfortune to
have to deal with.
1 The Stanford administration
probably has good plans based
on sound reasons for the future
of this University. Still, when dis
cussing any aspect of them, ihese
rnon are so secretive, so clouded
in mystery, and so evasive that I
tend always to wish they wouldn't
| say anything at all.
If the ASSU Legislature would
stop all this silly business of
"play government" and sit down
to really bite into a topic, J
' doubt there's anythjng they
couldn't solve. But as ii is, al
most every representative to the
body goes to meetings to hear
himself talk.
Why does it seem to be that
the Alpine Beer Garden 011 Al
pine Road (which will probably
always be Rosolti's despite new
ownership) is on the ABC
blacklist, when other coll e ge
hangouts in this area go scot
free? Ah fair democracy! Ah
payola!
Lastly, an "unforgettable char
acter" I met and worked for this
summer, Jack Allen by name, tells
a tale about dad Ben S., class of
'06, who got so into the hair of
then President David Starr Jor
dan as Editor of the Daily, that
he finally got booted out. Ben S.
still talks about freedom of ihe
press.
Well, like material, time oc
casionally runs out, too. Thanks
for your cards, letters and
spoken comments about columns
in the past; they were (mostly)
all appreciated.
This is the end of the end.

Week after week a columnist
faces the problem: What to write
about? Or maybe: "Which friend
to please (or nix) today? Then,
too, there comes the time to de
cide where to tread lightly, and
where one may stomp without
fear.
But this boils it all down to too
simple a proposition. For above
all, above topic, crusade, affilia

responsibility to write what is in

terial.
No columnist can expect to
please every reader every time.
Most don't even try. Others
never intend to. But somewhere
between the "let's please every

theories there lies the correct
approach.
It manifests itself in thoughts
which take a "subject with more

anything that comes along and

There's a very entertaining
treatise 011 columnists some
where, and it goes something
like this:
A columnist is a person who
knows a little bit about a lot of
things, and continues to know less
and less about more and more
until he knows nothing about
cveryt hing.
Or, a columnist is a person who
knows an awful lot about a little
bit, and continues to know more
and more about less and lessi
until he knows everything about 1
nothing.
Something about those state
ments makes me think they
were penned by somebody who
doesn't like the group. Not he

tion, I pass lightly over it. for
fear I will agree (thus mak
ing myself and cohorts boobs)
or disagree (and face the pros
pect of seeming too all-mighty).
One thing is true of columnists,
112 know. You either face the pros
pect of writing your column with
little or nothing on the line, or
j else you have too much to write
I about, are forced to leave some
material out, and then the rest
gets too old to get back to.
For instance, the following
columns will never be written at

In general the switchboard
operators at female dorms on

No columnist can expect to

There's a very entertaining
treatise 011 columnists some
where, and it goes something
like this:
A columnist is a person who
knows a little bit about a lot of
things, and continues to know less
and less about more and more
until he knows nothing about
cveryt hing.
Or, a columnist is a person who
knows an awful lot about a little
bit, and continues to know more
and more about less and lessi
until he knows everything about 1
nothing.
Something about those state
ments makes me think they
were penned by somebody who
doesn't like the group. Not he

One thing is true of columnists,
112 know. You either face the pros

little or nothing on the line, or
j else you have too much to write
I about, are forced to leave some
material out, and then the rest
gets too old to get back to.
For instance, the following
columns will never be written at

In general the switchboard
