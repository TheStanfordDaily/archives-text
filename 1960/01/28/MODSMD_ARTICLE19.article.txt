The argument about our de
fenses, which is now raging, re
volves around what used to he
! called the "missile gap" and is
now called the "deterrent gap."
The gap in either version is dur
ing the next few years when the
Soviet Union will have in opera
lion perhaps three times as many
long range missiles as we have.
In this period of time the
Soviet Union will be able, says
Gen. rowers, the Commander of
the Strategic Air Command, to
"virtually wipe out our entire
nuclear (retaliatory) strike
capability within a span of
thirty minutes." Theoretically
then, the Soviet Union would
no longer be deterred since it
could knock us out before we
could answer back.
The Administration's view is
that this is an abstract theoretical
equation Gen. Powers called i!
"a mathematical probability" —
which in fact, and in reality Hie
Soviet Union could not and would
not act upon.
For the total retaliatory power
of the United States and its allies
is to bo measured not only in mis
siles but in manned bombers
which can he kept in the air, and
by other strategic weapons such
as submarines and mobile missile
bases.
On the nearer issue of wheth
er we shall soon be at the mercy
of the Soviet Union, the Admin
istration lias, it seems to me, a
good case.
No doubt Gen. Powers is right
to insist upon the "mathematical
probability" that 150 long range
missiles and another 150 medium
range missiles could in half an
hour destroy the 100 installations
and facilities from which we can
launch a nuclear reply.
But while this is a good and
sufficient reason for strengthen
ing our retaliatory force and of
spending the money to protect it.
there is a bigger issue which we
need to ponder and to discuss.
The deep weakness in the
Administration's position is not
that we cannot deter the Soviet
Union in 1963. It is that in the
general field of rockets and the
exploration of space we are not
even holding our own.
We are falling behind. The Ad
ministration case, although good
enough on the risks of war in
19G3, contains within it a great
and quite unfounded assumption.
This assumption is that al
though the Soviet Union is now
ahead of us, we are in the process
of catching up. This supposes
that we are now moving faster
than the Soviet Union is moving.
There is no reason to think that
this is true. Almost certainly Ihe
truth is that they are moving
faster than we are.
This is the most serious of all
the gaps. It is that despite the
genius and talent available our
science and technology are less
good than that of the Soviet
Union.
We have all asked ourselves
why. My own view, for what it
may bo worth, is that our second
rateness stems from a false con
ception of the whole matter and
from a fundamentally wrong de
cision.
The false conception is the
President's belief that there are
two separate and distinct fields
one for military weapons and the
other for the exploration of space.
From this fallacy stems the

decision to leave the develop
ment of the missiles to the mili
tary services and to treat the
exploration of space as a form
of boon-doggling, of no concern
to our safety and with no seri
ous claims on the budget.
From this comes, so I am con
vinced, the fact that the armed
services find it very hard to re
cruit and to hold on to the very
best scientific minds of the coun
| try.
The very first rate men will not
devote their lives to making a
weapon that will soon be obsolete.
These same men are often not re
cruited for the space exploration
because the whole effort there is
starved for money.
The second-rateness of our
performance is due to the fact
that our programs — military
and for space —do not invite
and encourage the very first
rate minds.
I am afraid that the reason
| why the Soviets are ahead of us
| is that their military weapons and
their space rockets are under the
control, not of the soldiers and
not of the factory managers, but
of the scientists.
Men of genius cannot do what
they are capable of doing if, as is
the case today, they are herded
into separate compartments and
told to devote themselves to
limited aims.
They will respond best if they
can believe that they are part
of a great inquiry and experi
mentation into the nature of
the universe. In all the flour
ishing periods of discover and
invention the air men breathed
stimulated them to look beyond
the horizon.
There is no such favoring
climate today. Instead we have a
Philistinism which supposes that
the most original and first rate
minds can he hired for any job
that the boss chooses for them.
And we have a materialism
which regards the exploration of
space, and indeed the exploration
of the unknown, as less important
than the multiplication of con
sumer goods.
Such philistinism and material
ism are the attributes of a declin
ing and second-rate power, and
i hey are our real cause for con
cern.

volves around what used to he
! called the "missile gap" and is
now called the "deterrent gap."
The gap in either version is dur
ing the next few years when the
Soviet Union will have in opera
lion perhaps three times as many
long range missiles as we have.
In this period of time the
Soviet Union will be able, says
Gen. rowers, the Commander of
the Strategic Air Command, to
"virtually wipe out our entire
nuclear (retaliatory) strike
capability within a span of
thirty minutes." Theoretically
then, the Soviet Union would
no longer be deterred since it
could knock us out before we
could answer back.
The Administration's view is
that this is an abstract theoretical
equation Gen. Powers called i!
"a mathematical probability" —
which in fact, and in reality Hie
Soviet Union could not and would
not act upon.
For the total retaliatory power
of the United States and its allies
is to bo measured not only in mis
siles but in manned bombers
which can he kept in the air, and
by other strategic weapons such
as submarines and mobile missile
bases.
On the nearer issue of wheth
er we shall soon be at the mercy
of the Soviet Union, the Admin
istration lias, it seems to me, a
good case.
No doubt Gen. Powers is right
to insist upon the "mathematical
probability" that 150 long range
missiles and another 150 medium
range missiles could in half an
hour destroy the 100 installations
and facilities from which we can
launch a nuclear reply.
But while this is a good and
sufficient reason for strengthen
ing our retaliatory force and of
spending the money to protect it.
there is a bigger issue which we
need to ponder and to discuss.
The deep weakness in the
Administration's position is not
that we cannot deter the Soviet
Union in 1963. It is that in the
general field of rockets and the
exploration of space we are not
even holding our own.
We are falling behind. The Ad
ministration case, although good
enough on the risks of war in
19G3, contains within it a great
and quite unfounded assumption.
This assumption is that al
though the Soviet Union is now
ahead of us, we are in the process
of catching up. This supposes
that we are now moving faster
than the Soviet Union is moving.
There is no reason to think that
this is true. Almost certainly Ihe
truth is that they are moving
faster than we are.
This is the most serious of all
the gaps. It is that despite the
genius and talent available our
science and technology are less
good than that of the Soviet
Union.
We have all asked ourselves
why. My own view, for what it
may bo worth, is that our second
rateness stems from a false con
ception of the whole matter and
from a fundamentally wrong de
cision.
The false conception is the
President's belief that there are
two separate and distinct fields
one for military weapons and the
other for the exploration of space.
From this fallacy stems the

decision to leave the develop
ment of the missiles to the mili
tary services and to treat the
exploration of space as a form
of boon-doggling, of no concern
to our safety and with no seri
ous claims on the budget.
From this comes, so I am con
vinced, the fact that the armed
services find it very hard to re
cruit and to hold on to the very
best scientific minds of the coun
| try.
The very first rate men will not
devote their lives to making a
weapon that will soon be obsolete.
These same men are often not re
cruited for the space exploration
because the whole effort there is
starved for money.
The second-rateness of our
performance is due to the fact
that our programs — military
and for space —do not invite
and encourage the very first
rate minds.
I am afraid that the reason
| why the Soviets are ahead of us
| is that their military weapons and
their space rockets are under the
control, not of the soldiers and
not of the factory managers, but
of the scientists.
Men of genius cannot do what
they are capable of doing if, as is
the case today, they are herded
into separate compartments and
told to devote themselves to
limited aims.
They will respond best if they
can believe that they are part
of a great inquiry and experi
mentation into the nature of
the universe. In all the flour
ishing periods of discover and
invention the air men breathed
stimulated them to look beyond
the horizon.
There is no such favoring
climate today. Instead we have a
Philistinism which supposes that
the most original and first rate
minds can he hired for any job
that the boss chooses for them.
And we have a materialism
which regards the exploration of
space, and indeed the exploration
of the unknown, as less important
than the multiplication of con
sumer goods.
Such philistinism and material
ism are the attributes of a declin
ing and second-rate power, and
i hey are our real cause for con
cern.

! called the "missile gap" and is
now called the "deterrent gap."
The gap in either version is dur
ing the next few years when the
Soviet Union will have in opera
lion perhaps three times as many
long range missiles as we have.
In this period of time the
Soviet Union will be able, says
Gen. rowers, the Commander of
the Strategic Air Command, to
"virtually wipe out our entire
nuclear (retaliatory) strike
capability within a span of
thirty minutes." Theoretically
then, the Soviet Union would
no longer be deterred since it
could knock us out before we
could answer back.
The Administration's view is
that this is an abstract theoretical
equation Gen. Powers called i!
"a mathematical probability" —
which in fact, and in reality Hie
Soviet Union could not and would
not act upon.
For the total retaliatory power
of the United States and its allies
is to bo measured not only in mis
siles but in manned bombers
which can he kept in the air, and
by other strategic weapons such
as submarines and mobile missile
bases.
On the nearer issue of wheth
er we shall soon be at the mercy
of the Soviet Union, the Admin
istration lias, it seems to me, a
good case.
No doubt Gen. Powers is right
to insist upon the "mathematical
probability" that 150 long range
missiles and another 150 medium
range missiles could in half an
hour destroy the 100 installations
and facilities from which we can
launch a nuclear reply.
But while this is a good and
sufficient reason for strengthen
ing our retaliatory force and of
spending the money to protect it.
there is a bigger issue which we
need to ponder and to discuss.
The deep weakness in the
Administration's position is not
that we cannot deter the Soviet
Union in 1963. It is that in the
general field of rockets and the
exploration of space we are not
even holding our own.
We are falling behind. The Ad
ministration case, although good
enough on the risks of war in
19G3, contains within it a great
and quite unfounded assumption.
This assumption is that al
though the Soviet Union is now
ahead of us, we are in the process
of catching up. This supposes
that we are now moving faster
than the Soviet Union is moving.
There is no reason to think that
this is true. Almost certainly Ihe
truth is that they are moving
faster than we are.
This is the most serious of all
the gaps. It is that despite the
genius and talent available our
science and technology are less
good than that of the Soviet
Union.
We have all asked ourselves
why. My own view, for what it
may bo worth, is that our second
rateness stems from a false con
ception of the whole matter and
from a fundamentally wrong de
cision.
The false conception is the
President's belief that there are
two separate and distinct fields
one for military weapons and the
other for the exploration of space.
From this fallacy stems the

decision to leave the develop
ment of the missiles to the mili
tary services and to treat the
exploration of space as a form
of boon-doggling, of no concern
to our safety and with no seri
ous claims on the budget.
From this comes, so I am con
vinced, the fact that the armed
services find it very hard to re
cruit and to hold on to the very
best scientific minds of the coun
| try.
The very first rate men will not
devote their lives to making a
weapon that will soon be obsolete.
These same men are often not re
cruited for the space exploration
because the whole effort there is
starved for money.
The second-rateness of our
performance is due to the fact
that our programs — military
and for space —do not invite
and encourage the very first
rate minds.
I am afraid that the reason
| why the Soviets are ahead of us
| is that their military weapons and
their space rockets are under the
control, not of the soldiers and
not of the factory managers, but
of the scientists.
Men of genius cannot do what
they are capable of doing if, as is
the case today, they are herded
into separate compartments and
told to devote themselves to
limited aims.
They will respond best if they
can believe that they are part
of a great inquiry and experi
mentation into the nature of
the universe. In all the flour
ishing periods of discover and
invention the air men breathed
stimulated them to look beyond
the horizon.
There is no such favoring
climate today. Instead we have a
Philistinism which supposes that
the most original and first rate
minds can he hired for any job
that the boss chooses for them.
And we have a materialism
which regards the exploration of
space, and indeed the exploration
of the unknown, as less important
than the multiplication of con
sumer goods.
Such philistinism and material
ism are the attributes of a declin
ing and second-rate power, and
i hey are our real cause for con
cern.
