Editor, Tin* Daily:
I am wri ing in reply to Phyllis
Lepon's I^ll rM- about tickols to the
Andres Segovia concert. She com
plains that although she and other
"interested people" arrived at
12:30 p.m., all hie tickets were
sold in blocks to th: 1 first nine
people in line.
Because I am a member of a
fraternity which bought one such
block, and because I am sure
there are many othe s who feel
as gypped as she docs, I think
some answer is needed.
She arrived at 12:30, half an
hour before tickets went on sale.
What she does not realize is that
representatives of our fraternity,
unbelievably eager to hear Se
govia, had been waiting in line
since one o'clock in the morning.
We took turns holding the first
place in line for twelve hours
Not a single ticket wa.s distrib
uted to anyone outside our fra
ternity. Miss Lepon can rest as
sured that all those who see the
concert from these special seats
will be interested, bona fide Stan
ford students.
It is unfortunate that many stu
dents who would like to attend
the concert will be unable to. But
I do not see that they have any

greater claim on the available
tickets simply because they are

loss organizod.
