## A 						Successful Reign 
### 
For 1 lio last four years Pete Newell has had more than just
average success as live baskelball coach at llie University of Cali
fornia. The greying 45-year-old mentor has rolled up seasons of
17-8, 21-."), 19-9, and 25-4. He has won three PCC titles in those four
years and one NCAA crown.
What has made Newell's career so successful, in my mind, has
been his ability to put the word team back in basketball, a game
that is fast becoming a battle of individuals.
Never has Newell had on his teams any one player that could
be classified as a one man team.

Every crucial victory in New
ell's campaign to the national
championship last year seemed to
bring a new player to light as
hero of the day. Being able to
rely on any member of the team
as well as the team unit itself is
to me the essence of champion
ship quality.
The same story seems to be re
occurring this year in Cal's win
studded schedule. One game its
Dai'rull linhoff who stars, the
next day its Karl Shultz, or Tandy
(iillis, or Bob Wendell, or liill Me*
Clintock.
Stanford, Too?
Stanford's recent surge back 1o
the winning column of the bas
kelball record book also has been
generated by a sudden flare for
team effort. Every member of the
squad is capable of playing pres
sure basketball, and now that
they seem to realize it, Stanford
may have increased success over
the last weeks of the campaign.

Against Washington two weeks ago an inspired Bub Bowling led
the team from what appeared certain defeat to a last minute victory.
The next night Jerry Tlmcsen, after several days rest due to a
knee injury, returned to the lineup to spark a first half scoring
spree that insured the Indians a victory over Washington State.
Last Monday night John Arrillaga with numerous steals and
clutch shooting led Stanford from 11 points down in the second
half to an overtime victory at Washington State.
Coach llowie Dallinar is never sure where his star is going to
appear from next. Neal Broekmeyer. a reserve center at the start
of the season (a position he'd held for 2 ! - years!, suddenly turned
into an ace defensive postman and laled showed he could -score
as well.
John Windsor, benched for erratic play at center, returned to
the lineup at forward and broke into double figures with startling
consistency.
John liondry, strong rebounder and defensive man, with a near
2.1 per cent shooting average, all of a sudden couldn't miss with a
devastating jump shot against Washington two weeks ago.

consistency.
John liondry, strong rebounder and defensive man, with a near
2.1 per cent shooting average, all of a sudden couldn't miss with a
devastating jump shot against Washington two weeks ago.

For 1 lio last four years Pete Newell has had more than just
average success as live baskelball coach at llie University of Cali
fornia. The greying 45-year-old mentor has rolled up seasons of
17-8, 21-."), 19-9, and 25-4. He has won three PCC titles in those four
years and one NCAA crown.
What has made Newell's career so successful, in my mind, has
been his ability to put the word team back in basketball, a game
that is fast becoming a battle of individuals.
Never has Newell had on his teams any one player that could
be classified as a one man team.

Every crucial victory in New
ell's campaign to the national
championship last year seemed to
bring a new player to light as
hero of the day. Being able to
rely on any member of the team
as well as the team unit itself is
to me the essence of champion
ship quality.
The same story seems to be re
occurring this year in Cal's win
studded schedule. One game its
Dai'rull linhoff who stars, the
next day its Karl Shultz, or Tandy
(iillis, or Bob Wendell, or liill Me*
Clintock.
Stanford, Too?
Stanford's recent surge back 1o
the winning column of the bas
kelball record book also has been
generated by a sudden flare for
team effort. Every member of the
squad is capable of playing pres
sure basketball, and now that
they seem to realize it, Stanford
may have increased success over
the last weeks of the campaign.

Against Washington two weeks ago an inspired Bub Bowling led
the team from what appeared certain defeat to a last minute victory.
The next night Jerry Tlmcsen, after several days rest due to a
knee injury, returned to the lineup to spark a first half scoring
spree that insured the Indians a victory over Washington State.
Last Monday night John Arrillaga with numerous steals and
clutch shooting led Stanford from 11 points down in the second
half to an overtime victory at Washington State.
Coach llowie Dallinar is never sure where his star is going to
appear from next. Neal Broekmeyer. a reserve center at the start
of the season (a position he'd held for 2 ! - years!, suddenly turned
into an ace defensive postman and laled showed he could -score
as well.
John Windsor, benched for erratic play at center, returned to
the lineup at forward and broke into double figures with startling
consistency.
