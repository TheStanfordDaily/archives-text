# Backstrokers and Defensive Linemen
## 
### 
Coach Tom Haynie of the Stanford swimming team has suddenly
found a need for a backstroker. Jack Howell, one of the nation's
best backstrokers, has reportedly decided to give up swimming this
season. If Howell does quit, Stanford's last hopes for NCAA chain
ionship contention may leave the pool with him.
Starting with Monday's issue of The Daily, the sports page
will be under the helm of Knss Allen. Having worked with Allen for
quite some lime, 1 can definitely assure everyone that the sports
page will be in top hands. Allen is an old defensive lineman from
Portland, Ore., who is the only football player to my knowledge
who's played an entire game with a biting hangover.
Working with Allen as assistant sports editor and writing a
weekly column will be Ron Rapoport. The Bleaeherite (sounds like
a frustrated Jaundrymant will be Rapoport's column.
