# Surprising Oregon at Pavilion For Saturday Tilt With Cards
## Daily Sports

Victory or defeat Saturday
j night should greatly show how
much the Stanford basketball
team has improved this season.
Led by the highly-touted Glenn
Moore, the University of Oregon
Ducks invade the Pavilion in an
attempt to improve their fine 13-
j 1 record in a non-league game.
Oregon has been a tremendous
j surprise in the Northwest this
year, mainly because of the de
velopment of their 6'7" center.
The adjectives on Moore have
i been many, and to give one an
! idea as to his supporting cast, the
j Webfoots edged our Indians
j earlier this year, when Moore was
j out with an ankle injury.
Outstanding Frosh
Called by many the outstanding
freshman on ihe coast last sea
ls on , th e surprisingly - poised
youngster stepped right into a
j lineup featuring six returning
I lettermen.
Glenn is leading his team in
scoring at the moment with an
'average of 16.3 points per game.
A good shooter and top rebounder,
tough Mr. Moore has the agility
to move around and keep the de
fense honest.
Another fine sophomore who
has cracked the starting lineup is
6'l" Charlie Warren. He was all
i state twice as a prep and illness
] cost him a shot at a third such
j rating.
11 Point Average
The second high scorer on the
squad with an 11-point average,
j Warren has exceptionally fast
hands and has played a large
part in the Webfoot's rebuilding
plan. Right behind Moore in re
bounding, he can hurt an op
ponent in a lot of ways.
Captain Chuck Rask. a two-year
letterman, leads the guards, and
no one who saw his personal duel
with Paul Neumann in last year's
game will have forgotten him.
A fiery floor leader, his pass

ing has surprised and entertained
many. "Sneaky" fast, the 6'l" sen
ior can hit from either inside or
outside, but a look at an Oregon
boxscore never tells the complete
story.
In games when Rask ha« scored
only six or seven points, his all
round play oftentimes has led the
Ducks lo a convincing win.

Rask's running mate at guard
is Denny Strickland. A surprise
shift by coach Steve Belko which
I has paid off well sent Strickland
j from forward to guard earlier in
the season. A 6-5 guard just isn't
seen everyday, and when a big
man can drive a small defensive
man into the pivot he has a great
scoring advantage.

Rounding out Iho starting five
is forward Dale Herron, a two
year letterman also. Possessor of
a fine jump shot, Herron i« capa
ble of fine basketball and always
plays hard.
