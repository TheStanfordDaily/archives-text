"The European cries of separa
tion and the African cries of
equality in Africa are false goals,"
William Jacobson, a graduate of
the Union of South Africa's Cape
town University said last night
at Cubherley Auditorium in a do
bate with British Laborite Fenner
Brockway.
"They are false goals because
multi-racial Africa needs plural
goals for a plural society. The
wide cultural gaps between the
European and the African neces
s i t a t e separate development."
Jacobson said, in the debate on
Africa's multi-racial states.
Brockway returned. "Separa
tion is impossible because 1 he eco
nomic inter - dependence brings
Africans into European society
and these Africans will not toler
ate the humilations to which the
Europeans now subject them.
Kihl White Domination
"Two-thirds of Africa will have
freedom by the end of the year.
This feeling for indepedence from
white domination is sweeping
over Africa and South Africa
will not be able to stop it."
Brockway continued. ''What
many consider to be the multi
racial problem in Africa is really
the African problem. The African
nations are predominantely Afri
can and the minority groups, in
eluding the whiles, must accept

this fact and adjust to it."
Jacobson stated that South
Africa must allow the Africans
to participate more in the gov
ernment, but that they cannot
i allow them control because the
rights of the minority must be
protected as well as the rights of
the majority developed.
African Government I nstable
He felt that if the government
was under African control, the
; rights of the white and other
minority groups would be vio
lated and the government would
| be unstable.
In contrast, Brockway stated
! that the Africans who would be
in power would be willing to re
spect the rights of the whites, if
Ithe whites would not want too
many privileges.
He stated that the situation can
not remain as it is now. African
labor is developing the "wonder
fid" feeling of self-reliance which
will not tolerate its present sub
jection.
Jacobson recognized the eco
nomic development of the Afri
leans but felt, that the growth of
the middle class, who would want
stable government, will help to
solve the problem in the future,
j However for the present the eco
nomic and cultural differences
are too great to allow the equality
which one-man, one-vote policy
i would i t eate.
