## 
### 
PARIS (A 1 ) — President Charles de Gaulle's top representatives in Algeria broadcast appeals yes
terday for an end to tlie French settlers' uprising. In often placating terms, civil and military chief
tains called for a return to work.
The insurgent foes of De Gaulle's policy of self-determination for Algeria showed no signs of
obeying.
Instead, they reinforced their barricades and kept weapons at hand in the streets of Algiers,

where supporting crowds made
idle by a four - day - old general
strike sang the Marseillaise and
shouted, "Algeria is French!"
Street Clashes
There were street clashes in Mo
staganem, the first such outbreak
since rioting in Algiers Sunday
claimed 26 lives. Mostaganem is
a Mediterranean port of 50,000
about 200 miles west of Algiers.
The French Press Agency said
gunfire burst out during a count
er demonstration after a throng
of several hundred townspeople,
mainly Moslems, had marched on
the City Hall to ask for a re
sumption of work. The marchers
shouted, "Long live De Gaulle!
Long live the army!" and "Down
with Massu!"
The last referred to the para
troop general De Gaulle relieved
from command in the Algiers dis
trict for criticizing his policy.
Six persons were injured dur
ing the march. The Press Agency
gave no details as to casualties in
the shooting that followed.
Party Support
In Paris, French political [jar
ties from the far left to the mod
erate right strengthened De
Gaulle's hand with pledges re
affirming their support. The dom
inant Union for the New Republic
backed him without reserve and
condemned the insurgents as
"maniacs of conspiracy."
De Gaulle called his Cabinet to
gether again at Elysee Palace,
guarded now by several truck
loads of blue-clud Paris police in
addition to the normal comple
ment of a half dozen men.
It was announced the Cabinet
had heard a report from Premier
Michel Debre, who visited Algiers
secretly Monday night, and ap
proved instructions given to the
military and civil commanders in
Algeria.
Appeals Broadcast
The Cabinet statement indicated
the broadcast appeals—by Dele
gate General Paul Delouvrier, the
civil administrator, and Gen. Mau
rice Challe, commander in chief
of the armed forces—were ap
proved in general, if not in exact
wording by the government.
Challe hinted that the army
would never favor autonomy or
independence for the North Afri
can territory. He said the army
had fought five years against the
nationalist Algerian rebels and
would continue to fight "so that
Algeria remains definitely French
territory."
