# Anti-De Gaullists Raided in France
## French Police Hit Rightists Across Nation 
### 
PARIS i/\') French police yes
; terday staged nationwide raids
against rightists supporting anti-
I De Gaulle insurgents in Algeria.
Striking at dawn, armed police
I raided rightist homes and head
quarters in such widely separated
areas as Paris, Marseille, Bor
deaux, and a dozen other cities.
The raids apparently were
aimed at keeping the rightists off
balance. Although there has been
| no such wave of sympathy for the
Algerian insurgents as was dis
played in May, 19.18, during the
last similar outbreak, the police
showed no sign of lowering their
I guard.
Planning: Obvious
With a precision that betrayed
long planning, the police moved
in on big and little fish alike.
The biggest fish were rightist
Deputy Jean-Marie le Pen and
retired air force Gen. Lionel
Chassin both vocal opponents of
De Gaulle and his Algerian poli
cies and both figures in the 1958
' Algerian rightists revolt that
toppled the weak Fourth Repub
j lie.
The police were armed with 80
search warrants sworn out quiet
ly Wednesday night by Judge
Robert Magnin. Although these
were not warrants for arrest,
several rightists were taken to po
lice headquarters for questioning.
Appeal to Moslems
In Algiers, ' President De
Gaulle's government exhorted the
Moslems to demonstrate faith in
him as the savior of their free
dom.
The French President's chief
civil representative urged the
nine million Moslems to rise and
demonstrate their support of De
Gaulle before the very eyes of the
dissident French settlers who
want to maintain French rule
here at all costs.
"March in parades, freely and
spontaneously cry, 'De Gaulle,
vive De Gaulle,' " Delegate Gen.
Paul Delouvrier urged. "You are
going to aid in resolving this ter
rible trial that we are going
through. It is for your real liber
ation."
Do Gaulle has been moving to
ward a policy of self-determina
tion for Algeria. When he fired
Gen. Jacques Massu, one of the
Europeans' main hopes, they
showed they had enough of this
course. The insurgent settlers
took effective control of Algiers,
and 26 persons died Sunday as
fighting went forward across
street barricades.
Police Silent
The widespread raids in France
] turned up a mass of literature,
1 but police said nothing about any
| thing else they may have found.
The display of force was empha
sized in Paris when President De
Gaulle made a formal trip
! through the city to the musty
i building where the Council of
I Stale meets.
He was cheered by several
hundred people, and among them
were plain-clothed police in large
I numbers. The route he took
1 through town was only about
i three-quarters of a mile, but it
| was lined every 20 feet with
I police, and more stood on the roof
tops eyeing the crowds. De Gaulle
I seemed unconcerned. He was sol-
I emn and didn't acknowledge the
1 cheers.

Appeal to Moslems
In Algiers, ' President De
Gaulle's government exhorted the
Moslems to demonstrate faith in
him as the savior of their free
dom.
The French President's chief
civil representative urged the
nine million Moslems to rise and
demonstrate their support of De
Gaulle before the very eyes of the
dissident French settlers who
want to maintain French rule
here at all costs.
"March in parades, freely and
spontaneously cry, 'De Gaulle,
vive De Gaulle,' " Delegate Gen.
Paul Delouvrier urged. "You are
going to aid in resolving this ter
rible trial that we are going
through. It is for your real liber
ation."
Do Gaulle has been moving to
ward a policy of self-determina
tion for Algeria. When he fired
Gen. Jacques Massu, one of the
Europeans' main hopes, they
showed they had enough of this
course. The insurgent settlers
took effective control of Algiers,
and 26 persons died Sunday as
fighting went forward across
street barricades.
Police Silent
The widespread raids in France
] turned up a mass of literature,
1 but police said nothing about any
| thing else they may have found.
The display of force was empha
sized in Paris when President De
Gaulle made a formal trip
! through the city to the musty
i building where the Council of
I Stale meets.
He was cheered by several
hundred people, and among them
were plain-clothed police in large
I numbers. The route he took
1 through town was only about
i three-quarters of a mile, but it
| was lined every 20 feet with
I police, and more stood on the roof
tops eyeing the crowds. De Gaulle
I seemed unconcerned. He was sol-
I emn and didn't acknowledge the
1 cheers.
PARIS i/\') French police yes
; terday staged nationwide raids
against rightists supporting anti-
I De Gaulle insurgents in Algeria.
Striking at dawn, armed police
I raided rightist homes and head
quarters in such widely separated
areas as Paris, Marseille, Bor
deaux, and a dozen other cities.
The raids apparently were
aimed at keeping the rightists off
balance. Although there has been
| no such wave of sympathy for the
Algerian insurgents as was dis
played in May, 19.18, during the
last similar outbreak, the police
showed no sign of lowering their
I guard.
Planning: Obvious
With a precision that betrayed
long planning, the police moved
in on big and little fish alike.
The biggest fish were rightist
Deputy Jean-Marie le Pen and
retired air force Gen. Lionel
Chassin both vocal opponents of
De Gaulle and his Algerian poli
cies and both figures in the 1958
' Algerian rightists revolt that
toppled the weak Fourth Repub
j lie.
The police were armed with 80
search warrants sworn out quiet
ly Wednesday night by Judge
Robert Magnin. Although these
were not warrants for arrest,
several rightists were taken to po
lice headquarters for questioning.
