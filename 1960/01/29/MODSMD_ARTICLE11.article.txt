# Players Effectively Show Thomas' Amazing Talent
## 
### Mary Lou McKinley 
The unmalehable prose of Dylan Thomas was effectively brought
to life last night in Memorial Auditorium when the Stanford Players
opened the three-night run of "Under Milkwood." It wasn't so much
tlie east and the director who succeeded, however, but Thomas'
amazing gifts for characterization and poetic expression which made

the show enjoyable.
Although few of the 23-member
cast were outstanding, most of
the 60-so me characterizations
came across clearly and humor
ously as the author intended.
IJoss Excellent
An excellent job was done by
Alec Ross as the first narrator
whose performance added a good
deal to the production. Showing
a real feeling for the play, he
seemed to delight in every word
of it and made the tumbling, ad
jective-filled prose come alive
without loosing its naural lyric
quality.
Unfortunately, the second nar
rator', Gordon Adams, seemed in
adequate for the role. Although
the lines were given clearly and
distinctly, his speeches suffered
from an excess of dramatic ges
ture and he seemed to lack some
of the feeling for the prose which
Ross displayed.

One of the most laudable points
|of (ho production is that cues
I were picked up promptly with no
awkward pauses to break the
continual flow of wordsâ€”a diffi
cult thing to achieve, especially
with so many cast members and
the many lines which bounce back
j and forth between narrators and
characters, oftentimes broken in
; the middle of a sentence.
Good Sequences
Several sequences were very
i well done, with notable character
izations by Luke Vania as the
philandering Mr. Waldo and the
i baker Dai Bread, Edward Staats
as Captain Cat and Colon Brown
as the Rev. Eli Jenkins.
The setting, by Richard Hay,
i gave the impression of a huge jig
saw puzzle which wasn't com
pletely put together yet. Built
out over the orchestra pit, the
pattern of platforms and outlines
of houses was done in half a
dozen colors, piece-work fashion.
A little distracting at first but
j none-t he-less effective, it reflect
led the quality of the play and
.showed an ingenious use of levels.
Lighting Too Abrupt
The lighting, which showed the
passage of time from night to
dawn and day and then to dusk
and night again, was too abrupt,
however, although good use was
made of travel spots.
It's well worth the tickets
i priced at $1.25 and $1.75 for re
maining shows tonight and to
morrow night at 8:30 in Memo
rial Auditorium.
