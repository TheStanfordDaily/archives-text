### 
"Too many people today am
: asking 'Whore is technology load- j
ing us?' Not enough are asking
I'Where shall wo lead technol-1
ogy?' " said Dr. E. Finley Carter,
: President of Stanford Research
Institute, to the Senate Commit
; 100 on T'oreign Relations yester- j
i day.
Carter appeared before the
committee to present views in
amplification of the Institute's
recent report on the "Possible
Impact of Nonmilitary Scientific
and Technological Developments
on Foreign Policy."
"I would like to make a frank |
pica for a correction in the tie-:
mendous imbalance which pres
ently exists between Ihe use of
science to produce the material
of war and conflict on the one
i hand, and its use in advancing the
causes of peace, prosperity and
freedom on the other," Carter
| said.
The Department of Defense, j
plus (wo other defense-orientedl
agencies, will spend nearly 7 bil- !
lion dollars in 1960, while the
largest non-defense spender will
be allocated only $250 million for
research and development.
The government has been
I forced into research programs in
the physical sciences in Ihe past,
said Carter, but today the nation
must face threats in the field of j
ilium.-in sciences.
