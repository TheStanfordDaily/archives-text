To anyone who has read many hack volumes of The Daily, it
must seem a foregone conclusion that 99 per cent of nil outgoing
editors write a final editorial that contains la) a lengthy reminis
cence of anything that lias happened during the previous \olunie,
and (1)) words of advice to his successor.
Today, \ on are to be spared. Daily editors have come and gone
for 136 volumes to all 1 >111 perhaps a few, their names and what
thev did or didn t do are quickly forgotten. But the press in the
hack room keeps grinding away and the distribution boxes on
Quad are still full ever) morning. So I frankly can't sec much point
in making a big fuss about what is in most inerel\ an end-of-
January change in the masthead.
Before leaving, there are several "wants for Stanford" which
I d like to list. These aren't the money-oriented projects like a
new undergraduate library, a pavilion seating 8000, and higher
salaries for the faculty. Those are things everyone wants, and
which wail onlv until the appropriate financial support is secured.
\\ hat I refer to are those things which more involve changes in
thinking, system or action.
• An advising system that really advises, based on year-long
course planning and comprehensive discussion, rather than thrice
a-year course-signing and ten-minute checks to see if requirements
are being met.
• An open campus to freshmen men so they would know the true
story, good aspects and had, of fraternity life, instead of the pres
ent situation where one plans his next three years of living based
on false-front open houses and a few parties. The adjustment
might lake a year or two, hut I honestly believe the fraternities
could, if they wanted to, abolish the no-contact rule without, in
turn, setting up rushing parties every night for two quarters.
• An overall campus attitude toward drinking which plays up
moderation (for those who wish to drink at all) and plays down
the attitude of what I believe is a vocal minority group, who sets
a standard which says you're a nobody until you're stoned out of
your mind, and the devil may care if you happen to pass out in
your driveway.
• An expansion and continuance of a trend this quarter toward
the discovery that there are some persons on this campus who arc
darned interesting and well worth an hour or two of iime in a
small informal group meeting.
• An academic planning program which bears in mind what
kind of students the admissions office is going to admit to Stan
ford, and adopts its program to these students. This, however,
should he coupled with an admissions program which recognizes
in face of rising applications and standards that it still lakes more
than straight A's in high school and 770's on college boards to
make a person a potential leader in his field.
These five things are far from a full list. ou and I can all
think of many more, but these do form a small representative
sample.
Thanks for your time —I'll be next heard from back home on
the sports page, in The Finish Line.

darned interesting and well worth an hour or two of iime in a
small informal group meeting.
• An academic planning program which bears in mind what
kind of students the admissions office is going to admit to Stan
ford, and adopts its program to these students. This, however,
should he coupled with an admissions program which recognizes
in face of rising applications and standards that it still lakes more
than straight A's in high school and 770's on college boards to
make a person a potential leader in his field.
These five things are far from a full list. ou and I can all
think of many more, but these do form a small representative
sample.

To anyone who has read many hack volumes of The Daily, it
must seem a foregone conclusion that 99 per cent of nil outgoing
editors write a final editorial that contains la) a lengthy reminis
cence of anything that lias happened during the previous \olunie,
and (1)) words of advice to his successor.
Today, \ on are to be spared. Daily editors have come and gone
for 136 volumes to all 1 >111 perhaps a few, their names and what
thev did or didn t do are quickly forgotten. But the press in the
hack room keeps grinding away and the distribution boxes on
Quad are still full ever) morning. So I frankly can't sec much point
in making a big fuss about what is in most inerel\ an end-of-
January change in the masthead.
Before leaving, there are several "wants for Stanford" which
I d like to list. These aren't the money-oriented projects like a
new undergraduate library, a pavilion seating 8000, and higher
salaries for the faculty. Those are things everyone wants, and
which wail onlv until the appropriate financial support is secured.
\\ hat I refer to are those things which more involve changes in
thinking, system or action.
• An advising system that really advises, based on year-long
course planning and comprehensive discussion, rather than thrice
a-year course-signing and ten-minute checks to see if requirements
are being met.
• An open campus to freshmen men so they would know the true
story, good aspects and had, of fraternity life, instead of the pres
ent situation where one plans his next three years of living based
on false-front open houses and a few parties. The adjustment
might lake a year or two, hut I honestly believe the fraternities
could, if they wanted to, abolish the no-contact rule without, in
turn, setting up rushing parties every night for two quarters.
• An overall campus attitude toward drinking which plays up
moderation (for those who wish to drink at all) and plays down
the attitude of what I believe is a vocal minority group, who sets
a standard which says you're a nobody until you're stoned out of
your mind, and the devil may care if you happen to pass out in
your driveway.
• An expansion and continuance of a trend this quarter toward
the discovery that there are some persons on this campus who arc
darned interesting and well worth an hour or two of iime in a
small informal group meeting.
• An academic planning program which bears in mind what
kind of students the admissions office is going to admit to Stan
ford, and adopts its program to these students. This, however,
