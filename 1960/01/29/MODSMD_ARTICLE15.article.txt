Basic Objections
Editor, The Daily:
Recent letters by David Cald
well have suggested that some
students might "represent the
Stan lord Honor Code pledge as
printed on the blue books" be
cause signing it "is against Ihe
Fifth Amendment."
I have been wondering if there
are not more basic reasons for
objecting to this requirement. On
one of the last quarter's finals I
wrote ihe following: "After sign
ing this statement several times,
I have come to question its funda
mental wisdom.
"Does it not resemble the loyal
ly oath against which Stanford is
not known to be an outstanding
opponent? When one comes to
Stanford it is with the under
standing he will abide by the
honor system of conduct. Why is
it necessary lo reaffirm this posi
tion with each examination?
"Does the administration hope
to indite students for perjury?
Perhaps a more satisfactory
method would be to restate the
honor code at appropriate times
without demanding the signa
ture."
A briefer objection on another

I exam brought a curt professorial
comment which concluded as fol
: lows: "This has to do with hon
: esty, not loyalty." Perhaps. Per
i haps it would also be wise to
extract the following of govern
ment officials once each month:
"In recognition of and in the
â€¢ spirit of the Constitution, I certify
; that I will commit no treasonable
act this month and that I will
| report, to the best of my ability,
all such crimes observed by me."
Just as Stanford's system has
| eliminated cheating, this would
purge the government of Com
munists without provoking such
J staunch opponents of loyalty
i oaths at the ACLU.
To be sure, most loyalty ("hon
esty") oaths are in and of them
selves only small compromises.
It is the psychology they breed
which should concern us all. How
many Stanford graduates have
i gone on to sign one oath after
I another, not realizing the inevit
able consequences of their be
! havior?
Looking at not too distant Cali
; fornia history, one must assume
"too many." One wonders how
many have thought twice about
i signing their blue books.
