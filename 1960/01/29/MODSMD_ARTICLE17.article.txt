All universities seem to bo
wandering around on the +>ottom
of the depths of the great finan
cial world (witness Stanford's
$182-million problem). Faculty
members suffer accordingly.
But at Columbia, where stu
dents will pay $1,450 in tuition
and fees next year, faculty sal
aries are at long last on the way
up.
As a matter of fact, "the ac
tion [the new tuition rate| has
as its compelling reason the
imperative need for increases
in salaries for faculty mem
bers."
The minimum salary, effective
July 1, has been increased for in
structors by $.100 to $5,500; for
assistant professors by $1,000 to
$6,500; for associate professors
by $1,500 to $8,000; and for full
professors by $1,000 to $11,000.
The University of Michigan
Daily reports that more than 80
per cent of the requested uni
versity budget for 1960-1 will be
earmarked for faculty salaries.
This percentage is about the
same as for the past decade, hut
the actual amounts of money
have increased: in 1959-60, $85
million out of $13 million was
given to salaries, while the pro
posed budget allots $41 million
out of $50 million.
The requested increases would
over a new nine per cent raise
for faculty members similar to
this year's, when there was an in
crease of almost 10 per cent.
Five per cent of the new raise
will go to make up the deficiency
between past faculty salary
boosts and raises in the income
of the average American work
er, and four per cent will go to
"meritorious" individuals to keep
pace with economy's present rate
of expansion.
Faculty salaries have in
creased far less than the na
tional faculty average. Faced
with faculty competition from
other universities, and competi
tion also from industry, the uni
versity must raise faculty sal
aries.
At present, salaries range from
a low $4,400 per year for some
instructors to a high of $19,000
for a few veteran professors.
Faculty-wide average is $9,276.

Teaching- fellows at Harvard !
earn more than some University j
of Michigan instructors. The aver- i
age of the university is $300
below the Harvard minimum.
The instructor minimum at
the New York City colleges is
also above the university aver
age by $200.
The comparison shows similar
results at higher levels.
Since 1989, real income of the
national labor force has risen
by 60 per cent, while university
faculty members have received
only 10 per cent more.
A bill now before the Kansas
State Senate would allow seven
per cent raises for administrators
and faculty of the University of
Kansas.
None the less, the university,
ranked sixth among 14 selected
state-supported universities, in a
comparative report in amount of I

The University of Michigan
Daily reports that more than 80
per cent of the requested uni

earmarked for faculty salaries.
This percentage is about the
same as for the past decade, hut
the actual amounts of money
have increased: in 1959-60, $85
million out of $13 million was
given to salaries, while the pro
posed budget allots $41 million
out of $50 million.
The requested increases would
over a new nine per cent raise
for faculty members similar to
this year's, when there was an in
crease of almost 10 per cent.
Five per cent of the new raise
will go to make up the deficiency
between past faculty salary
boosts and raises in the income
of the average American work
er, and four per cent will go to
"meritorious" individuals to keep
pace with economy's present rate
of expansion.
Faculty salaries have in
creased far less than the na
tional faculty average. Faced
with faculty competition from
other universities, and competi
tion also from industry, the uni
versity must raise faculty sal
aries.
At present, salaries range from
a low $4,400 per year for some
instructors to a high of $19,000
for a few veteran professors.
Faculty-wide average is $9,276.

The University of Michigan
Daily reports that more than 80
per cent of the requested uni
versity budget for 1960-1 will be
earmarked for faculty salaries.
This percentage is about the
same as for the past decade, hut
the actual amounts of money
have increased: in 1959-60, $85
million out of $13 million was
given to salaries, while the pro
posed budget allots $41 million
out of $50 million.
The requested increases would
over a new nine per cent raise
for faculty members similar to
this year's, when there was an in
crease of almost 10 per cent.
Five per cent of the new raise
will go to make up the deficiency
between past faculty salary
boosts and raises in the income
of the average American work
er, and four per cent will go to
"meritorious" individuals to keep
pace with economy's present rate
of expansion.
Faculty salaries have in
creased far less than the na
tional faculty average. Faced
with faculty competition from
other universities, and competi
tion also from industry, the uni
versity must raise faculty sal
aries.
At present, salaries range from
a low $4,400 per year for some
instructors to a high of $19,000
for a few veteran professors.
Faculty-wide average is $9,276.

Teaching- fellows at Harvard !
earn more than some University j
of Michigan instructors. The aver- i
age of the university is $300
below the Harvard minimum.
The instructor minimum at
the New York City colleges is
also above the university aver
age by $200.
The comparison shows similar
results at higher levels.
Since 1989, real income of the
national labor force has risen
by 60 per cent, while university
faculty members have received
only 10 per cent more.
A bill now before the Kansas
State Senate would allow seven
per cent raises for administrators
and faculty of the University of
Kansas.
None the less, the university,
ranked sixth among 14 selected
state-supported universities, in a
comparative report in amount of I
state support it receives, ranks
13th in the amount it pays in
salaries.
KU faculty salaries average
$6,963, or $1,733 under the top
reported average of $7,685.
