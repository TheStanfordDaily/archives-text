Personal Controversy
Editor, The Daily:
Although the columns of the
"Stanford Daily" should not be
used endlessly to hash over what
it rapidly becoming a personally
oriented sort of controversy,
neither should the malicious dia
tribes of the intellectually irre
sponsible be allowed to go un
answered.
Mr. Erickson, after columns of
obscure paragraphs "and mis
spelled names, finally tells us
what he is talking about, when he
asserts that "freedom of speech"
should be extended to anti-Se
mites, since such freedom has
been extended to pro-Communists
and other dissenting groups.
I will not reply in Mr. Erick
son's own language of the sly
barb and the obscured meaning.

with the suppressed giggle of Ihe
outworn reactionary. Rather I
wish to remind Mr. Erickson, and
any others who hold with his
views (can there be many?) that
there is a great difference be
tween freedom and license, that
"freedom of speech" doesn't allow
one to yell "Fire" in a dark and
crowded theater. . . .
Let us remember that it is the
business of laws to maximize the
social good, which business can
be abetted by allowing the honest
expression of ideas by every man,
and also by assuring that murder
ers and their defenders do not go

unpunished. . .
