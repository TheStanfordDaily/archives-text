### Marion Crowley 
The renovation of (he center
section of Encina, begun in the
summer of 1958, will be com
pleted next month, according lo
M. S. F. Post, Assistant Business
Manager.
Estimated at a cost of $1,370,-
000, the remodelling includes such
features as an elevator servicing
the basement and four floors, im
proved lighting, forced ventila
tion, movable partitions which
will allow flexibility of office
space, and, most important, mod
ern features for the prevention
and control of fire.
The fifth floor of the center
section has been removed entirely.
It is planned that the wings will
undergo similar improvements in
the future, as soon as sufficient
funds are available.
The machine section of the Con
troller's Office has already moved
to the basement of Encina.
The remaining portion, along
with the offices of Business Af
fairs, News and Publications,
Residence and Dining Halls Direc
tors. the General Secretary, the
Cashier, Personnel and Financial
Affairs, plan to begin moving
about Feb. 1 and will be located
in the first three floors.
Research units for the Econom
ies and Sociology departments
will move into the fourth floor
area in about a month.
When construction is finished (
and the workmen move out, Kn j
cina will look quite different than ]
it did when il opened with the
University in 1891. Since that time
it has housed 61 Freshman
classes and has been home to such
distinguished people as Herbert
Hoover, Maxwell Anderson, John
Steinbeck and Bob Mat bias.
It was the all campus men's !
dorm until 1923. Then il housed
only freshmen until 1955 when it
was retired. But in the Fall of |
1956 it was needed once more.
Florence Moore Ilall, a new
women's dormitory, had not been j

completed in time for all the
women to move in, so for two
and-a-half weeks, Encina was a
female residence for the first time
in its history. Moore's completion
ended Encina's career as a dorm,
but not its usefulness.
Many old gratis objected to tear
ing down t he building, for senti

mental reasons; thus it was de
cider! to completely reconvert the
inside, leaving the exterior un
touched.
The building is in a strategic
position for administrative offices
and their relocation will provide
valuable academic space in the
heart of the quad.
