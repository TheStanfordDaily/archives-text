# As I See It
## A 						column of non-staff opinion 
### David Lomax 
Now that the major institutions
involved in the case have made
their decisions it is possible to
examine clearly the Opsahl-Crary
incident (the affair of Sigma
Nu). Two questions concerning
this should be asked.
The first is, "On what
grounds was the fraternity pun
ished, and what purpose is sup
posed to be served by the pun
ishment?" The second, "Are we
to presume that the police and
Stanford University now have
no intention of enforcing the
laws concerning drinking by
minors, and drinking on
campus?"
It appears to me quite unrea
sonable to hold the other mem
bers of the fraternity in any way
responsible for what occurred;
on communal functions such as
fraternity parties it is justified to
enforce collective responsibility
—but the concept has no meaning
outside a limited range of activi
ties; there is no justification for
holding the house responsible to
the administration for the private
lives of its members.
If a fraternity member is a
burglar, his house is not held
responsible for his doings. If a
brother has a road accident in his
home town his house is not held
responsible.
That the accident occurred on
fraternity grounds is not a
cause of responsibility; who
would hold the university re
sponsible for accidents taking
place on its property? The pun
ishment meted out to Sigma Nu
is wholly unjustified unless the
house was run so much differ
ent than the other houses that
correction was inevitable, and
the Opsahl event merely accel
erated it. This I doubt.
The punishment itself spoiling
the social life of the students, who
for various reasons pledged Sig
ma Nu, for an indefinite period
is unjust to the members of the
house, and being based on the
attitude of the university admin
istration to the house reminds one
of punishments issued by dicta
torial regimes where a person
would be held at the discretion of
the government.

What place does administrative
discretion play in a democratic
judiciary? This punishment is not
likely to inculcate a sense of jus
tice in the house members nor
can it be expected to cause any
permanent change in the fratern
ity's conduct, if one is needed.
It is difficult to administer
laws which do not command
popular respect, such as the
California and campus drinking
laws. However it might be ap
propriate to consider the meth
od used by the California High
way Patrol for administering
the old speeding law.
One was allowed to exceed the
limit, but if one broke the law
excessively the law was adminis
tered to the letter. This method of
administering laws to the letter
if their spirit is broken is simple,
easily understood, and maintains
respect for the intention of the
law.
From reading the press reports
I conclude that no charge at all
has been preferred against
Stephen Crary. Quite clearly man
slaughter and all that is pot
relevant. What I am concerned
with are the drinking laws.
I wish to conclude by stating
the questions a different way.
What respect can individuals have
for the system of laws, if collec
tive punishment with its corollary
implication of minimization of in
dividual responsibility, is applied
to fraternity offenses?
And secondly what justice and
rationale is there behind the use
of collective punishment? The
cynical conclusion that it can be
used effectively to shield persons
from the consequences of their
own acts is—l hope—too cynical.

ishment meted out to Sigma Nu
is wholly unjustified unless the
house was run so much differ
ent than the other houses that
correction was inevitable, and
the Opsahl event merely accel
erated it. This I doubt.
The punishment itself spoiling
the social life of the students, who
for various reasons pledged Sig
ma Nu, for an indefinite period
is unjust to the members of the
house, and being based on the
attitude of the university admin
istration to the house reminds one
of punishments issued by dicta
torial regimes where a person
would be held at the discretion of
the government.

What place does administrative
discretion play in a democratic
judiciary? This punishment is not
likely to inculcate a sense of jus
tice in the house members nor
can it be expected to cause any
permanent change in the fratern
ity's conduct, if one is needed.
It is difficult to administer
laws which do not command
popular respect, such as the
California and campus drinking
laws. However it might be ap
propriate to consider the meth
od used by the California High
way Patrol for administering
the old speeding law.
One was allowed to exceed the
limit, but if one broke the law
excessively the law was adminis
tered to the letter. This method of
administering laws to the letter
if their spirit is broken is simple,
easily understood, and maintains
respect for the intention of the
law.
From reading the press reports
I conclude that no charge at all
has been preferred against
Stephen Crary. Quite clearly man
slaughter and all that is pot
relevant. What I am concerned
with are the drinking laws.
I wish to conclude by stating
the questions a different way.
What respect can individuals have
for the system of laws, if collec
tive punishment with its corollary
implication of minimization of in
dividual responsibility, is applied
to fraternity offenses?
And secondly what justice and
rationale is there behind the use
of collective punishment? The
cynical conclusion that it can be
used effectively to shield persons
from the consequences of their
own acts is—l hope—too cynical.
Now that the major institutions
involved in the case have made
their decisions it is possible to
examine clearly the Opsahl-Crary
incident (the affair of Sigma
Nu). Two questions concerning
this should be asked.
The first is, "On what
grounds was the fraternity pun
ished, and what purpose is sup
posed to be served by the pun
ishment?" The second, "Are we
to presume that the police and
Stanford University now have
no intention of enforcing the
laws concerning drinking by
minors, and drinking on
campus?"
It appears to me quite unrea
sonable to hold the other mem
bers of the fraternity in any way
responsible for what occurred;
on communal functions such as
fraternity parties it is justified to
enforce collective responsibility
—but the concept has no meaning
outside a limited range of activi
ties; there is no justification for
holding the house responsible to
the administration for the private
lives of its members.
If a fraternity member is a
burglar, his house is not held
responsible for his doings. If a
brother has a road accident in his
home town his house is not held
responsible.
That the accident occurred on
fraternity grounds is not a
cause of responsibility; who
would hold the university re
sponsible for accidents taking
place on its property? The pun
ishment meted out to Sigma Nu
is wholly unjustified unless the
house was run so much differ
ent than the other houses that
correction was inevitable, and
the Opsahl event merely accel
