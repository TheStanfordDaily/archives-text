Allen Drury.
Interesting guy, Allen Drury.
He graduated from the Farm
in 1940 and his efforts for The
Daily make some interesting
reading.
For instance he was The Daily's
review editor in his frosh and
sophomore years and after seeing
Garbo in "Camille" said "There
may still be people in the world
who are not convinced tHat Garbo
is the greatest actress ... in a
long, long time." It seems that A1
wasn't one of them.

Not wishing to be accused of
letting his better judgment in
these things get away from him,
he managed to take Marlena
Dietrich to task for her part in
"Garden of Allah." He thought a
lot more of Charles Boyer.
Al's talents were not confined
to this sort of trivia, however. He
wrote a little thing about the
names carved in the desks of his
poli sci 23 class. Talk'about lost
arts . . .
As a junior A1 was an Associate
Editor, one of The Daily's elite,
and took over the job of war
reporter.
On Sept. 28, 1938, Allen Drury's
by-line appeared on the front page

over a quote from a Dr. Graham
Stuart of the Poli Sci department.
Stuart said, "If Britain and
France stand firm, Hitler won't
fight. Germany can't win now
against a major power and Hitler
knows it."
Two days later the Munich Con
ference had ended and the man
who wouldn't risk a fight rolled
into Czechoslovakia without one.
We had peace in our time.
Such are the talents of the man.
He has further shown his versa
tility by becoming a top Washing
ton correspondent and by writing
the best-selling book in the coun
try.

—from the book jacket of
"Advise and Consent" by
Allen Drury.
Interesting guy, Allen Drury.
He graduated from the Farm
in 1940 and his efforts for The
Daily make some interesting
reading.
For instance he was The Daily's
review editor in his frosh and
sophomore years and after seeing
Garbo in "Camille" said "There
may still be people in the world
who are not convinced tHat Garbo
is the greatest actress ... in a
long, long time." It seems that A1
wasn't one of them.

Not wishing to be accused of
letting his better judgment in
these things get away from him,
he managed to take Marlena
Dietrich to task for her part in
"Garden of Allah." He thought a
lot more of Charles Boyer.
Al's talents were not confined
to this sort of trivia, however. He
wrote a little thing about the
names carved in the desks of his
poli sci 23 class. Talk'about lost
arts . . .
As a junior A1 was an Associate
Editor, one of The Daily's elite,
and took over the job of war
reporter.
On Sept. 28, 1938, Allen Drury's
by-line appeared on the front page

over a quote from a Dr. Graham
Stuart of the Poli Sci department.
Stuart said, "If Britain and
France stand firm, Hitler won't
fight. Germany can't win now
against a major power and Hitler
knows it."
