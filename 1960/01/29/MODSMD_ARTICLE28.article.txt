## COMMITTEES: AN AGONIZING REAPPRAISAL 
### 
[Author of "I TFas a Teen-age Dwarf","The Many
Loves of Dobie Gillis", etc.)

To those of you who stay out of your student government
because you believe the committee system is just an excuse for
inaction, let me cite an example to prove that a committee,
properly led and directed, can be a great force for good.
Last week the Student Council met at the Duluth College of
Veterinary Medicine and Relles-Lettres to discuss purchasing a
new doormat for the students union. It was, I assure you, a
desperate problem because Sherwin K. Sigafoos, janitor of the
students union, threatened flatly to quit unless a new doormat
was installed immediately. "I'm sick and tired of mopping
that dirty old floor," said Mr. Sigafoos, sobbing convulsively.
(Mr. Sigafoos, once a jolly outgoing sort, has been crying almost
steadily since the recent death of his pet wart hog who had been
his constant companion for 22 years. Actually, Mr. Sigafoos is
much better off without the wart hog, who tusked him viciously
at least once a day, but a companionship of 22 years is, I sup
pose, not lightly relinquished. The college tried to give Mr.
Sigafoos a new wart hog—a frisky little fellow with floppy ears
and a waggly tail—but Mr. Sigafoos only turned his back and
cried the harder.)

But I digress. The Student Council met, discussed the door
mat for eight or ten hours, and then referred it to a committee.
There were some who scoffed then and said nothing would ever
be heard of the doormat again, but they reckoned without
Invictus Millstone.
Invictus Millstone, chairman of the doormat committee, was
a man of action— lithe and lean and keen and, naturally, a
smoker of Marlboro Cigarettes. Why do I say "naturally"?
Because, dear friends, active men and active women don't have
time to fuss and fumble and experiment with cigarettes.'They
need to be sure their cigarettes will never fail them—that the
flavor will always be mild and mellow—that the filter will
always filter—that the pack will always be soft or flip-top. In
short, they need to be sure it's Marlboro—dependable, con
stant, tried and true Marlboro. Smoke one. You'll see.
Yell sir, Invictus Millstone chaired his doormat committee
with such vigor and dispatch that, when the Student Council
met only one week later, he was able to rise and deliver the
following recommendations:
1. That the college build new schools of botany, hydraulic
engineering, tropical medicine, Indo-Ciermanic languages, and
millinery.
2. That the college drop football, put a roof on the stadium,
and turn it into a low-cost housing project for married students.
3. That the college raise faculty salaries by $5OOO per. year
across the board.
4. That the college secede from the United States.
5. That the question of a doormat for the students union be
referred to a subcommittee.
So let us hear no more defeatist talk about the committee
system. It can be made to work! <?. loeo MaxShuiman
* * *
You don't need a committee to tell you how good Marlboros
are. You just need yourself, a Marlboro, and a match . . . Or
if you like mildness but you don't like filters, try Marlboro's
sister cigarette—Philip Morris.

time to fuss and fumble and experiment with cigarettes.'They
need to be sure their cigarettes will never fail them—that the
flavor will always be mild and mellow—that the filter will
always filter—that the pack will always be soft or flip-top. In
short, they need to be sure it's Marlboro—dependable, con

Yell sir, Invictus Millstone chaired his doormat committee
with such vigor and dispatch that, when the Student Council
met only one week later, he was able to rise and deliver the
following recommendations:
1. That the college build new schools of botany, hydraulic
engineering, tropical medicine, Indo-Ciermanic languages, and
millinery.
2. That the college drop football, put a roof on the stadium,
and turn it into a low-cost housing project for married students.
3. That the college raise faculty salaries by $5OOO per. year
across the board.
4. That the college secede from the United States.
5. That the question of a doormat for the students union be

are. You just need yourself, a Marlboro, and a match . . . Or

To those of you who stay out of your student government
because you believe the committee system is just an excuse for
inaction, let me cite an example to prove that a committee,
properly led and directed, can be a great force for good.
Last week the Student Council met at the Duluth College of
Veterinary Medicine and Relles-Lettres to discuss purchasing a
new doormat for the students union. It was, I assure you, a
desperate problem because Sherwin K. Sigafoos, janitor of the
students union, threatened flatly to quit unless a new doormat
was installed immediately. "I'm sick and tired of mopping
that dirty old floor," said Mr. Sigafoos, sobbing convulsively.
(Mr. Sigafoos, once a jolly outgoing sort, has been crying almost
steadily since the recent death of his pet wart hog who had been
his constant companion for 22 years. Actually, Mr. Sigafoos is
much better off without the wart hog, who tusked him viciously
at least once a day, but a companionship of 22 years is, I sup
pose, not lightly relinquished. The college tried to give Mr.
Sigafoos a new wart hog—a frisky little fellow with floppy ears
and a waggly tail—but Mr. Sigafoos only turned his back and
cried the harder.)

But I digress. The Student Council met, discussed the door
mat for eight or ten hours, and then referred it to a committee.
There were some who scoffed then and said nothing would ever
be heard of the doormat again, but they reckoned without
Invictus Millstone.
Invictus Millstone, chairman of the doormat committee, was
a man of action— lithe and lean and keen and, naturally, a
smoker of Marlboro Cigarettes. Why do I say "naturally"?
Because, dear friends, active men and active women don't have
time to fuss and fumble and experiment with cigarettes.'They
