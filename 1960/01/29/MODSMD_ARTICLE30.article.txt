Oregon forward to play here tomorrow
Boasting better than a .500 record for the first lime in many
weeks, the Stanford basketball team goes into battle this weekend
against the University ot' Oregon Ducks tomorrow night at Sand the
Beavers of Oregon State College tonight at the same starting time.
The present 8-7 win-loss record has been a hard one to achieve

and the tribe has played some
fine ba-sketball in the last two
weeks to do it. Successive week
end sweeps in games with Wash
ington and Washington State
have brought the season from a
long, lifeless drag to a high point
in interest and anticipation.
Bright Spark
The brightest spark in the Stan
ford attack all year has come
from senior guard John Arrillaga.
Fresh from a brilliant 20 point

effort in the overtime victory at
Pullman, Monday, Arrillaga is
ready and so had belter be Oregon
State and Oregon.
The leading scorer since the
opening game, Arrillaga has been
receiving increasing help every
week.
Sophomore John Windsor, since
switched to forward, has been
scoring at a fine clip and as long
as this 6-7 youngster stays in
there, ihe tribe should score some
points.
