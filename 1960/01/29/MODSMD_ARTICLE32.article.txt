## 
### Vic Affolter 
The Stanford frosh will have
their hands full this weekend as
they take on Moffett Field, to
night, and San Jose City Col
lege, tomorrow night. These are
both home games and will start at
6 o'clock. Both teams are rated
as rugged opponents by Stanford
Frosh Coach Bill Turner. San
Jose City College especially fits
into this category as they have
run up a 14-2 record «o far this
season. •
The Papoose's troubles are mul
tiplied by the fact that their top
i scorer 6-4 Boh Sommers is out for
sure tonight and possible tomor
row night with a bad back.
San Jose will start Jack Sear
foss at center. Searfoss, (3-7, is
their leading scorer to date. 6-4
Jim Liedster and 6-3 Kent Sim
mons will start at the forward
positions. Two six footers, Benny
Brown and Roy Gilbert, will hold
down the two front court posi
tions. These boys are all noted to
he good rebounders and depend
largely on the fast break to over
power I heir opponents.
Stanford will use 6-0 Chuck
j Wilson at forward in place of the
! injured Sommers. Wilson has
i seen a lot of action as a reserve
this season and has scored and
rebounded 112 a i r 1 y consistently
while he has been in action. Stan
ford may suffer from the stop
down in height, however, as Som
mers is 6-4.
Darrell Sutherland, who has

boon playing up to his fine po
tential in recent games, will start
at the other forward position.
Roger Head, who may have found
himself when he dropped in 16
points against Diablo Valley last
Saturday night, will start at cen
ter. Stanford's two pesky guards,
the Clemetson twins, Don and
Doug, will round out the starting
five.
Little is known about tonight's
opponent. Moffett Field, except
that the Stanford Junior Varsity
defeated them by 1.1 points earlier
this season.

he good rebounders and depend
largely on the fast break to over
power I heir opponents.
Stanford will use 6-0 Chuck
j Wilson at forward in place of the
! injured Sommers. Wilson has
i seen a lot of action as a reserve
this season and has scored and
rebounded 112 a i r 1 y consistently
while he has been in action. Stan
ford may suffer from the stop
down in height, however, as Som
mers is 6-4.
Darrell Sutherland, who has

boon playing up to his fine po
tential in recent games, will start
at the other forward position.
Roger Head, who may have found
himself when he dropped in 16
points against Diablo Valley last
Saturday night, will start at cen
ter. Stanford's two pesky guards,
the Clemetson twins, Don and
Doug, will round out the starting
five.
Little is known about tonight's
opponent. Moffett Field, except
that the Stanford Junior Varsity
defeated them by 1.1 points earlier
this season.
The Stanford frosh will have
their hands full this weekend as
they take on Moffett Field, to
night, and San Jose City Col
lege, tomorrow night. These are
both home games and will start at
6 o'clock. Both teams are rated
as rugged opponents by Stanford
Frosh Coach Bill Turner. San
Jose City College especially fits
into this category as they have
run up a 14-2 record «o far this
season. •
The Papoose's troubles are mul
tiplied by the fact that their top
i scorer 6-4 Boh Sommers is out for
sure tonight and possible tomor
row night with a bad back.
San Jose will start Jack Sear
foss at center. Searfoss, (3-7, is
their leading scorer to date. 6-4
