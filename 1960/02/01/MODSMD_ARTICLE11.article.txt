# HOUSE, TOO?
## Horn Says Demos Will Keep Control of Senate 
### 
The only two practical cer
tainties of the current national
election year are that "Nixon will
lie th.> Republican candidate for
president" and that "The Demo
crats will continue to control the
U.S. Senate." according to Robert
Horn, Professor of Political
! Science, who presented a talk cn
i it led "The Donkey and the
Elephant in 1960" last night at
the Sigma Nu Fraternity house.
Horn, admitting that ho was
i 'out on a limb' to be making any
predictions at all this early in
the year, went on to say that a
Democratic victory in the House
' of Representatives is also highly
probable.
The Democratic nomination for
president is not very certain, but
'several tendencies in the making

of this choice are obvious, ac
cording to Horn.
He cited what he called the
"Changing of the Guard" â€” the
voters' tendency to look for men
who started their ri-se to promi
nence during World War II as
an important factor in picking a
candidate. Consequently, Profes
sor Horn picked the two stand
ards Kennedy and Humphrey
as being the two real candidates.
Horn would only conditionally
predict the final outcome of the
Presidential race. He based his
prediction on what he called the
"Pleateau Phenomenon" in Presi
dential elections. Horn maintains
that this phenomenon has been a
fact in ihe past, and occurs only
when there is a substantial in
crease in the number casting pop
ular votes, as is tlie case this year.
When such a condition exists,
it is the candidate who can cap
lure the large majority of this
increase who wins the election
and whose party continues to
win the election for a time after
that, thus riding on a "Plateau"
of support, like Eisenhower in
1952 and 1936.
