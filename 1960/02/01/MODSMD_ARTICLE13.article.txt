# AIR MACHINE
## Stanford Lab Develops New Smog Detector 
### 
New techniques are being de
vised at Stanford's Aerosol Lab
oratory to make it easier to de
•ect smog and other contaminants
in the air.
The laboratory's scientists have
developed an air sampling ma
chine called the "Rotorod Sam
pler" which, by moving through
air, can collect particles as small
as 20 microns in diameter.
Nearly 2,000 of the Samplers
are now in use. Since no manu
facturer is producing them yet,
all have been specially built under
the direction of the laboratory.
The Rotorod Samplers are be
ing used primarily for smog and
pollen studies now, but Stanford
experts say that the Sampler will
prove especially promising in
studying the spread of rust and
blight.
The laboratory has also de
veloped an extremely fine flno
; rescent powder to trace air move
ments through an area.
A few pounds dispersed by a
blower can yield easily measured
samples collected from the air
many miles away, since the grains
fall very slowly—about one yard
an hour in perfectly still air.
Since the powder glows a bril
liant yellow under ultra violet
light, it can be easily distin
guished from other solid particles.
The fluorescent powder tracer
technique has been used in nu
merous studies of air currents,
| especially in the Los Angeles
I Basin.
Initial tests there gave such
| surprising results that at first
I the experts would not believe
j them, until further tests proved
I the results to be correct.
