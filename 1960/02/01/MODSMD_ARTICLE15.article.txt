There is mueh to he said in favor ol modern journalism.

Oscar Wilde, I In- ( rilic as irlisl
A responsible newspaper, like a large political party, niiisl tr\
to halance a wide range of interests and pressures. Failing to
heed the hasic requicement ol diversity, the newspaper becomes
a mere reflection of the opinions and interests of a small, de
tached group of people.
But varietv for its own sake leads quickly to refined chaos.
In order to rise above the level of discriminating diversitv it is
necessarv for an editorial staff to give its newspaper some sense
of direction and purpose.
For a college newspaper the presentation of national and
international as well as campus news should not he an end in
itself.
Ideally, the facts are given not for a passive absorption but as
a starting point for the formulation of individual opinion. There
fore, a college newspaper should combine a comprehensive pres
entation of the facts with a clear restatement of tlicin after thev
have been woven into the fabric of student opinion. -
Although student opinion to a great extent is formulated
independently of the printed page on which it is reflected, il is
often guided hv the emphasis of one news area over another.
And il is in this question of emphasis wherein lies the power and
responsihilitv of an editorial board.
In a time w hen anv thing about which there is more than one
(dear opinion is termed an "issue" or a "controversy," it is rea
sonable to assume that the editorial board of a college news
paper should be concerned with "controversial issues.** And in a
lime when education is one of the nation's more important prob
lems, educational "controversies'" are ohviouslv within the area
of editorial emphasis.
The coals of educational "eontrov ersv * should he raked, hut
not simplv toenjov the flames. Ihev should he raked in llie hope
thai the resulting heal will provide enough energy to clear away
the ignorance, inaction, and disinterest which so often block
improvement of education.
The editorial hoard of Volume 137 of The Dailv hopes lo put
out a paper covering a wide range of interest hut with the under
lying emphasis on reflecting and stimulating student opinion on
the more immediate problem, our own education. Although The
Daily may reflect the opinions of the uneducated, we hope lo
indicate lhal the ignorance of the communilv is not complaccnt.
