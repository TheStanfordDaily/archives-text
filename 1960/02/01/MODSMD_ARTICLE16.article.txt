# News and Letters
## 
### 
As \ olunie 137 begins with today's issue, we feel that we
should state what the polic\ of llie new editorial hoard will he
in regard to the presentation of news and the formulation of
Letters to the Kditor.
Due to the laek of space it is impossible lo print all the letters
which are written lo the Kditor. and, therefore, some sort of limi
tation must he established. I he selection \\ ill be made b\ editorial
board on a basis of pertinence and interest to the student hod v.
\<> personal feuds will he sanctioned in the Letters to the Kditor
column, and any form of personal slander will he rejected.
Ihe (act that an\ letters hold a viewpoint opposite lo that
of editorial board will not enter into their consideration, and
choice will he made on a fair and impartial basis. Because of
the problem of space, the shorter the letter, the better will be
its chances of being printed, and genera 11\ no letter over 200
words will be ace< â€¢pled.
I he Once Around the Quad column will be expanded to en
compass many of the short articles and announcements which in
the past ha\e appeared on the front page. The object is lo gain
space on page one for more important news and lo give belter
and longer coverage to events which warrant il. There will also
be an increase in the amount of national and international news
and news analysis in The Dailv.
We therefore encourage l)ail\ readers lo look in Once Around
the Quad lo find announcements which pre\iousl\ were on page
one. We hope that this new polie\ will enable The l)ail\ to
present a more complete survey of the major happenings both
on campus and off and also lo fulfill one of ils functions in
reporting meetings and lalks.
Another innovation of Volume 137 is the cartoon "T'amilv
Portraits" which appears on page four today. This will alternate
with '"Little Man on (lanipus" and will bring, we feel, a new
element of humor, and perhaps culture, lo the campus.
