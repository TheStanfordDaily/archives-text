Cryptic Letters
Kditor, The Daily:
May I make a few requests of
those who in the future might
commence upon huffy little feuds
via the Letters to the Editor col
umn. ire: The recent Erickson
reply to the Cost ell reply to the
Erickson letter.)
1. Please, if you consider this
letter exchange necessary for
publication, make the points of
debate clear and refrain from
cryptically wording references to
these points and tlion hiding the
references between sentences of
exaggerated scorn.
(a) From Erickson's last letter:
"Either Costell is a slanderer or
a very sick boy.
(b) Wertheim may be Jewish,
No explanation as to the original
point either precedes or follows
this abrupt statement.

2. If deduct ions arc used, make
them logical.
"Ho misspelled Dr. Kendall's
Christian name and my surname
(Erickson's). This oversight un
masks either inattentiveness or a
sloppy mentality."
Aside from noting the narrow
ness of the two conclusions, I
would like to call attention to the
points that WillmooiT 1 Kendall's
Christian n;imo is quite difficult
to spell without checking last
year's university directory and
that there are at least five varia
tions in spelling Erickson: Erick
son, Ericsen, Eriksen, Erikson,
and Eriksson.
Please make ihe letters con
vey messages other than personal
insult such as: "it should not he
difficult to construct a Middle
town of his (Mr. Costell's) intel -j
leet." . . .
