## Feathered Delight at Bookstore

Tops on the list of Valentine
gifts for the Stanford co-ed is the !
useful little volume recently re
released by the Stanford Press: |
Familiar Birds of the Stanford
Campus, by biologist John B.
I Price. The new illustrated edition
features sixteen actual photo- j
l graphs of birds common in the
! campus vicinity, and the photos i
provide a ready air! in rapid 1
identification of local warblers.
The purpose of the book, states j
i the author in his Preface, is "to;
i help Ihe person interested in birds 1
I to learn the. names of the more |
icommon ones at Stanford and to!
i encourage him to pursue the sub
ject further." To this end, Mr. 1
I Price has arranged the 70-page j
i manual into convenient chapters.
Index
An index of more than 20 cam
pus birds comprises the bulk of
the work: the friendly Brewer's
Blackbird of the Union court, the
easily spotted California Quail,
and the enigmatic Plain Titmouse
are a few of the birds which can
be found by even an unpracticed
[eye. Mr. Price's description of the i
birds are thorough without being |
heavy in scientific terminology; i
the birds are listed by their com-j
mon names, and elaborate specifi
cation has been omitted.
A brief and informal summary
of the habits of each bird follows
the concise descriptions. The text!
is spiced with personal observa
tions of the author, gleaned from
his experiences with student bird
I classes.
Bird Student
In a chapter "Method of Bird I
Study," Price suggests helpful
equipment for the Stanford bird
student. Price recommends the
, morning hours as the most prof
itable time for bird-watching. It
was a surprise to this reviewer
to learn that "birds do not fear!
cars and many can often be seen
from an automobile parked on
1 some quiet road."
A quick "Key to Common Cam-!
pus Birds" accompanies the index ;
and classifies the birds by size -
only three "Birds Over Two Feet j
j in Length" are commonly found,
contrasted to the 15 birds "About
the Si/.e of a Blackbird."
Bird Walks
To further aid the Stanford stu
dent, Price suggests plans for,
: three possible campus birr! walks:
I "Through the Arboretum,"
"Along San Francisquito Creek" j
| and"The Birds of Lagunita."
Chapters on "Bird Banding at j
] Stanford" and "A Bird of the Salt
Marsh" Ihe soon extinct Cali
fornia Clapper Kail complete
the work.
Price's prose is lively through
out, and readability is insured by
his incorporation within the text
jof direct quotes from bird stu
dents "Oh, look what a long bill
j that California towhee has!", ex
claimed one misinformed student,
spotting a California thrasher.
Mistakes like this are natural
for the inexperienced Stanford
bird-watcher to make. With
Price's small book, however, such
j errors can be avoided. Easily;
within the means of any Stanford
student, Ihe volume sells in Ihe
j General Book Department of the j
j Stanford Bookstore for $1.50.
