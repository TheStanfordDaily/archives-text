# 'LOOK BACK IN ANGER'
## Film Hits With Fury 
### 
The rebellious fury of the char
acters of John Osborne who
"Look Back in Anger" comes
through with special clarity on
the screen.
The film-goer who has been
disappointed all too often by a
series of splashy but insipid
farces posing as film adaptations
of important works will find that
in this instance, "adaptation" is
not synonmous with "emacula
tion."
The British film company pro
ducing "Look Back in Anger" has
captured tire spirit of the original
stage play with integrity, and has
had the courage to present ii in
effective black and white.
Co-scripte<l
Fortunately, author Osborne
himself has co-scripted the film
production, and written all addi
tional dialogue. The result is a
drama in which the protagonists,
once confined to a single drab
room in the play, are now fre
quently released into the out-of
doors, only to find that they are
still confined, this time by the in
sensitivity of other people.
Although the original cast of
five has now been supplemented
with mobs of new faces, neverthe
less, each addition serves a pur
pose, and displays a highly per
ceptive characterization in the
film.
Slow Start
Before the movie really gets
under way, however, it suffers
from the handicap of a very slow
start. The scene changes are too
choppy, and the lengthy prelude
to the first spoken word becomes
monotonous. When stars Richard
Burton and Claire Bloom first ap
pear, they are slightly mechanical
and unconvincing. Yet after some
initial fumbling, during which
time they as well as the audience
try to get into the proper mood
of anger, the tone is finally set
and remains unbroken.
One of the high points of the
film is the death scene of the old

woman, Mrs. Tanner, shows ad
mirable restraint on the part of
the director and superb acting by
Edith Evans. Paralyzed by a
stroke and unable to move her
lips, she delivers a lengthy speech
during which her mumbled and
strained words are thoroughly
unintelligible. Yet it is precisely
because this speech has been un
hindered by words that it achieves
its remarkable effect.
Sensitive direction, competent
acting, and excellent dramatic
photography all contribute to the
effectiveness of this adaptation
of Osborne's play. Stanford stu
dents who were disappointed in
John Osborne as the author of
the overly-long production "The
Entertainer" would do well to
give him a second chance by view
ing "Look Back in Anger."

start. The scene changes are too
choppy, and the lengthy prelude
to the first spoken word becomes
monotonous. When stars Richard
Burton and Claire Bloom first ap
pear, they are slightly mechanical
and unconvincing. Yet after some
initial fumbling, during which
time they as well as the audience
try to get into the proper mood
of anger, the tone is finally set
and remains unbroken.
One of the high points of the
film is the death scene of the old

woman, Mrs. Tanner, shows ad
mirable restraint on the part of
the director and superb acting by
Edith Evans. Paralyzed by a
stroke and unable to move her
lips, she delivers a lengthy speech
during which her mumbled and
strained words are thoroughly
unintelligible. Yet it is precisely
because this speech has been un
hindered by words that it achieves
its remarkable effect.
Sensitive direction, competent
acting, and excellent dramatic
photography all contribute to the
effectiveness of this adaptation
of Osborne's play. Stanford stu
dents who were disappointed in
John Osborne as the author of
the overly-long production "The
Entertainer" would do well to
give him a second chance by view
ing "Look Back in Anger."

The rebellious fury of the char
acters of John Osborne who
"Look Back in Anger" comes
through with special clarity on
the screen.
The film-goer who has been
disappointed all too often by a
series of splashy but insipid
farces posing as film adaptations
of important works will find that
in this instance, "adaptation" is
not synonmous with "emacula
tion."
The British film company pro
ducing "Look Back in Anger" has
captured tire spirit of the original
stage play with integrity, and has
had the courage to present ii in
effective black and white.
Co-scripte<l
Fortunately, author Osborne
himself has co-scripted the film
production, and written all addi
tional dialogue. The result is a
drama in which the protagonists,
once confined to a single drab
room in the play, are now fre
quently released into the out-of
doors, only to find that they are
still confined, this time by the in
sensitivity of other people.
Although the original cast of
five has now been supplemented
with mobs of new faces, neverthe
less, each addition serves a pur
pose, and displays a highly per
ceptive characterization in the
film.
Slow Start
Before the movie really gets
under way, however, it suffers
from the handicap of a very slow
start. The scene changes are too
choppy, and the lengthy prelude
to the first spoken word becomes
monotonous. When stars Richard
Burton and Claire Bloom first ap

and unconvincing. Yet after some
