a very sad wookond.
A convincing 77-61 win over the
University of Oregon Ducks, with
a 13-.") record, pushed the Indian
seasonal mark to 9-8 and again
showed that tho team is capable
of some line basketball.
Tribe Hot
The fans at tho Pavilion saw
Ihe Tribe display its best offense
of the season with impressve
shooting percentages of 53 from
the floor and 72 from tho foul line.
The two teams battled on oven
terms for the first eight minutes
and it looked like a replay of the
overtime thriller won by Oregon
earlier in the season. It looked
that way, that is. until sophomore
forward Windsor began hitting on
long .jump shots. A watchful eye
might have seen an indication of
John's finest game when ho
cleanly out jumped the highly
touted (ilenn Moore on the open
ing tipoff.
At any rate the Cards ran the
score to 23-18 when two jump
shots by Duck forward Charlie
Wai ren and a free throw by
Captain Chuck Rask evened the
game again.
The first half was just about
ending in a tie when Windsor
scored with a jumper, two fouls,
and a driving layup on a brilliant
pass by Bub Bowling.
Tho stan/.e ended 35-30 in favor
of Stanford with Windsor having
contributed 16 points.
Returns
A tremendous cheer from the
crowd opened the second half as
captain John Arrillaga. still limp
ing slightly from an injured
ankle, reported for duty.
Windsor opened with a long
jumper from the corner and
Arrillaga hit his first two field
goal tries as the beginning of tho
end began for Oregon.
With fourteen, minutes remain
ing the Tribe stretched the score
to 19-38 and appeared ready to
handle the last-ditch Oregon
rally that was to fllow. A groat
drive by Charlie Warren that pro
duced three points was as close
as the Ducks over came the
score was 16-19 Stanford.

University of Oregon Ducks, with

Tribe Hot
The fans at tho Pavilion saw
Ihe Tribe display its best offense
of the season with impressve
shooting percentages of 53 from
the floor and 72 from tho foul line.
The two teams battled on oven
terms for the first eight minutes
and it looked like a replay of the
overtime thriller won by Oregon
earlier in the season. It looked
that way, that is. until sophomore
forward Windsor began hitting on
long .jump shots. A watchful eye
might have seen an indication of
John's finest game when ho
cleanly out jumped the highly
touted (ilenn Moore on the open
ing tipoff.
At any rate the Cards ran the
score to 23-18 when two jump
shots by Duck forward Charlie
Wai ren and a free throw by
Captain Chuck Rask evened the
game again.
The first half was just about
ending in a tie when Windsor
scored with a jumper, two fouls,
and a driving layup on a brilliant
pass by Bub Bowling.
Tho stan/.e ended 35-30 in favor
of Stanford with Windsor having
contributed 16 points.

Windsor opened with a long
jumper from the corner and
Arrillaga hit his first two field
goal tries as the beginning of tho
end began for Oregon.
With fourteen, minutes remain
ing the Tribe stretched the score
to 19-38 and appeared ready to
handle the last-ditch Oregon
rally that was to fllow. A groat
drive by Charlie Warren that pro
duced three points was as close
as the Ducks over came the
score was 16-19 Stanford.
