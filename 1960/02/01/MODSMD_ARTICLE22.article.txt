# Frosh Beat Moffett Field With Balanced Scoring
## 
### Glenn Alford 
The Stanford Papoose basket
ball team, despite playing without
its leading scorer, Bob Summers,
ran all over a helpless Moffet
Field S3-.11, Friday nighi.
The Tribe used amazingly bal
anced scoring in trampling the
Airmen. No Indian garnered over
12 {joints. Chuck Wilson got the
12 while hitting on all six of his
shols for a 1.000 shooting percent
age. Three other Indians all broke
into double figures. Don Clement
son, Lin Lamme, and Darrell
Sutherland all scored 10, and
Doug Clemenlson and Pele Rowe
made 8.
What is all the more amazing
about tlie Tribe's scoring feat,
is that they made only 7 free
throws. Their 39 field goals must

set some kind of a frosh record.
Stanford ran up a 38-22 first
half lead without the benefit of a
free throw. The first string ran
up a 2KO lead and Coach Bill
Turner put in the reserves for
the last ten minutes of the half.
The first string started the
second half, and pulled the mar
gin to f)."i-29 with fifteen minutes
left. Again the second string
came in, and some fantastic shoot
ing by Lamme and Rowe made it
67-32, before the third string came
in with nine minutes left.
Dave Robertson pulled the
score up to 71-3(> with a tipin and
a pair of free throws. Keith Las
son made the 80th point on a I
short .jump shot. Larry Morrison i
made the final bucket to end the |
slaughter.
