Stanford's ruggers found the high powered Athens C Inn ol Oak
land too fast for them as the Indians ended up on the short end
of a 9-3 score Saturday on the Card rugby field.
The Oaklanders opened the scoring mid-way through the first
half when they managed to make a long scoring drive good foi a

tr\ and three points. The try for
the conversion was no good as the
lack was wide.
The two clubs battled evenly
for the rest of the first period
and the half ended with the -score
Athens Club,3-Stanford. 0.
The Indians opened the second
period in spectacular fashion
when they evened the score with
a try of their own. Sid Gather
set up the score from his •'« posi
tion on a brilliant run into Athens
territory where he passed to his
teammates who in turn passed to
Skip Face who powered over the
I goal to score.
I

i ne try lor ine convei aon was
wide, but the Indians were back
in the game.
The Athens Clubbers came back
to take the lead a third of the*
way throtiL'h the second half on
a try, but missed the conversion.
Stanford battled to knot the
score, but were unable to pierce
the Athens goal line.
With time running out the In
dians mounted a desperate* scor
ing drive, but it fizzled out when
the Cards lost the ball in a lino
out.
Athens scored once more to
run the score to 9 to 3 and finish
the day's point making.
The Oaklanders were too fast
and experienced for Coach Pete
Kmetovic's Indian ruggers. The
Cards were often out-scrummed
and had difficulty in getting ihe
ball during a line oul, especially
when they needed it.
This was the Indians' second
match of the still young season
The next match for ihe Stan
ford Ruggers will come next
Saturday, Feb. 0, against the
UCLA Bruins on the Indian rugbv
