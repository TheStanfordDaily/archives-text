# Kerala State Votes Today
## 
### 
TRIVANDRUM, India </P)
About six million Indians vote
today in special elections to de
termine whether Kerala state will
be governed by Communists or
non-Communists.
Prime Minister Nehru's Con
gress party is the largest of three
parties joining forces against the
Communists, and the choice boils
down to one between communism
and democracy.
Voters will choose a new 126-
member Assembly, but the out
come may affect policy for Com
m un is t sand non-Communists
throughout India and influence
Indian politics for many years to
come,
The last time Kerala voted in
19.37 the Communists took con
trol of the Legislature by winning
60 seats and backing live inde
pendents sympathetic to commun
ism.
