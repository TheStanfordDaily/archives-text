# Lab to Raise Accelerator Energy Peak
## 
### 
When the 90 foot extension
now under construction is com
pleted sometime this spring,
Stanford's Mark 111 accelerator
will he able to operate ;it a peak
of one billion electron volts.
According to Professor Robert
Mosley, Hanson Laboratory, this
extension will enable many new
experiments to be performed.
The Mark 111 is the only high
energy linear accelerator in oper
ation in the country. The tube
is 220 feet long, and operation
of the machine requires 300 mil
lion watts at 3,000 megacycles.
An electric field in the tube
pro dn ee s an electromagnetic
wave controlled in speed to stay
with the particle accelerated.
As particles approach the-speed
of light they increase in mass,
sometimes becoming as much as
1.100 times heavier than normal.
At present the accelerator attains
energies of 700 million electron
volts.
The accelerator, locate d in
Hanson High Energy Physics
Laboratory, is used only at night.
During the day a maintenance
crew works on it to get it in order.
Research with the accelerator,
built in 11>53l l >53 under a government
contract, is done under the direc
tion of Professors W. K. 11. Pnnof
sky and Robert Kofstadter.
