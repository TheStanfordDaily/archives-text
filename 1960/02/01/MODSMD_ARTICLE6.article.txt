Sponsored by the student Coun
cil of Religious Affairs, Rev.
Reynolds' talk will explore the
changes in Protestant theology in
the past half-century.
"Many people don't realize the
extent to which the liberal theol
ogy, accepted doctrine until about
1930. has been re placer! by a neo
orthodoxy. The change has been
influenced by such forces as
depth psychology and existential
ist philosophy. Externally, the
change was brought about by the
Depression and World War 11.
These forces brought about a re
appraisial of Christian Ortho
doxy."
