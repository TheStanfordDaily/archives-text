### 
MONTEREY, Calif. (/Pi Dr.
| Linus Pauling, nB-year-ol(l Nobel
prize-winning chemist, was res
j cued unharmed yesterday from a
treacherous ledge on which he
; had been trapped for nearly 24
i hours.
The outspoken foe of nuclear
, bomb tests was in excellent con
: dition but excited when a searcher
led him from his sea-cliff perch
overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
| He had started out for a walk
! Saturday morning from his near
by two-room cabin and followed
ia deer trail until he became lost,
j He was on a steep cliff rising
; from the shore of the Pacific
j about 80 miles south of Monterey.
"I got the jitters," Dr. Pauling
j said simply. "I decided to stay
i there until I was found."
