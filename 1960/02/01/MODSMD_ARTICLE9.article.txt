# Algerian Soldiers Leave Barricades to Civilians
## Four Killed, Twenty Hurt By Explosion 
### 
ALGIERS </P) Territorial
troops, the backbone of the
j French insurgents, abandoned the
barricades yesterday, leaving only
j about 2,000 civilians behind to
! defy President Charles de Gaulle.
Despite the stunning blow, in
surgent leader Joseph Ortiz took
| to the loudspeakers to announce:
"We are the refuge of liberty. We
will fight to the dealh!"
Before the departure of the
Territorial national guard units,
several hundred ' Fre n eh me n
broke past army lines und joined
j the insurgents.
Tightens Noose
But then the Army tightened
the noose with reinforcements of
paratroopers, F or e i g n Legion
naires, and trucks thrown across
streets bumper to bumper. Rebel
calls for the citizens to break
through and form a human wall
before the barricades were un
availing.
Not even a terrorist bomb
which killed four soldiers flus
tered the disciplined troop cor
dons. The bomb exploded on a
j side street near the barricades.
Police said it was held by a M<
lem nationalist who was killed.
Twenty others were wounded.
Severe Setback
Failure of the thousands of
Frenchmen milling outside the
Army lines to respond to the in
surgent calls and the departure
of Ihe territorials handed the in
surgents their first severe set
i back since their uprising Inst Sun
: day.
j The tide appeared to have been
'running against the French set
tlers who oppose de Gaulle's
policy of self-determination for
Algeria since Friday night. At
| that time de Gaulle ordered the
Army to restore order in Algiers
land called the insurgent leaders
liars and conspirators.
Since then general strikes and
'demonstrations in other parts of
Algeria have collapsed, and all
the top Arm y commanders
pledged their loyalty to de Gaulle.
Gracieux Replaced
Another blow to the insurgents
| may have been the abrupt re
placement of Brig. Gen. Jean Gra
j cieux as the tactical commander
inside Algiers. Under him. troops
in the city had openly sympha
thized and fraternized with the
i insurgents.
Gracieux was sent back to the
'countryside to fight the Moslem
rebels, in revolt against France
for five years. He was replaced by
an associate, Brig, Gen. Kleber
Toulouse.
"I can assure you," Gracieux
said to the insurgents before be
-1 ing relieved of his post, "that no
| order has been given to the army
1 to attack."
