# U.S. Power Adequate Gates Says
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (A 1 ) Secretary
of Defense Thomas S. Gates Jr.
yesterday disputed as unrealistic j
the Strategic Air Command's esti- !
mate that the Soviet Union could j
demolish U.S. strike-back ability
in 30 minutes with 300 missiles, j
The estimate, made by Gen. j
Thomas S. Power, SAC com- i
mander, in a recent speech, was j
thrown before Gates by Sen. |
Stuart Symington (D-Mol while I
the defense chief was being ques
tioned by a Senate Appropriations
subcommittee about the new
$39,335,000,000 military budget.
Gates Disagrees With Tower
Symington, who contends the :
Eisenhower administration is let
ting the Soviet Union pull steadily
out front in missiles, wanted to
know why the Pentagon was ask
ing for only 15 per cent of what
Gen. Power declared would be i
needed to keep some of his long
range nuclear bombers aloft and
ready at all times.
Gates told Symington that
Power's views were thoroughly \
considered by the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and the chiefs do not agree
with the SAC commander.

Airborne Alert Unnecessary
"I don't want to be disparaging
of (lon. Power," the defense secre
tary said, "but we do believe his
estimate of mathematical prob
ability is unrealistic in relation to
the facts."
The Joint Chiefs do not feel it
necessary now to start an air
borne alert. Gates said and noted
the budget contains J)() million
dollars to get ready for such a
round-the-clock bomber alert, if
and when needed.
U.S. Can Deter Soviets
Power also has been much I
more drastic in his estimates of i
probable Soviet missile strength
in the years ahead. Last week
the Strategic Air Command chief
said it was conceivable the Soviet ;
Union could have enough long- j
range rockets in two years to per- |
mit a massive attack on the
United States.
In his statement to the appro- [
priations group Monday, dates 1
gave assurances as he has be- i
fore that the Soviet Union would
have only a moderate numerical
superiority in long-range missiles
during the next three years, lie
said anew that over-all U.S. retali
atory capability will be enough to :
deter the Soviet Union from any ,
sane decision to attack.
Johnson Assaults Gates
But even as dates was testify- i
ing, Senate Democratic Leader)
Lyndon 13. Johnson of Texas un- j
loosed a new assault on Gates'
optimistic public statements of
recent weeks, including the one
about Soviets having only a mod
crate (numerical edge in intercon
tinental missiles into 1962.
In a statement, Johnson said
Gates' claims do not square with
secret testimony intelligence offi
cials and others have given his
Senate Space Committee and Pre
pa red ness su bcom mi t tee.

Lyndon 13. Johnson of Texas un- j
loosed a new assault on Gates'
optimistic public statements of
recent weeks, including the one
about Soviets having only a mod
crate (numerical edge in intercon
tinental missiles into 1962.
In a statement, Johnson said
Gates' claims do not square with
secret testimony intelligence offi

WASHINGTON (A 1 ) Secretary
of Defense Thomas S. Gates Jr.
yesterday disputed as unrealistic j
the Strategic Air Command's esti- !
mate that the Soviet Union could j
demolish U.S. strike-back ability
in 30 minutes with 300 missiles, j
The estimate, made by Gen. j
Thomas S. Power, SAC com- i
mander, in a recent speech, was j
thrown before Gates by Sen. |
Stuart Symington (D-Mol while I
the defense chief was being ques
tioned by a Senate Appropriations
subcommittee about the new
$39,335,000,000 military budget.
Gates Disagrees With Tower
Symington, who contends the :
Eisenhower administration is let
ting the Soviet Union pull steadily
out front in missiles, wanted to
know why the Pentagon was ask
ing for only 15 per cent of what
Gen. Power declared would be i
needed to keep some of his long
range nuclear bombers aloft and
ready at all times.
Gates told Symington that
Power's views were thoroughly \
considered by the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and the chiefs do not agree
with the SAC commander.

Airborne Alert Unnecessary
"I don't want to be disparaging
of (lon. Power," the defense secre
tary said, "but we do believe his
estimate of mathematical prob
ability is unrealistic in relation to
the facts."
The Joint Chiefs do not feel it
necessary now to start an air
borne alert. Gates said and noted
the budget contains J)() million
dollars to get ready for such a
round-the-clock bomber alert, if
and when needed.
U.S. Can Deter Soviets
Power also has been much I
more drastic in his estimates of i
probable Soviet missile strength
in the years ahead. Last week
the Strategic Air Command chief
said it was conceivable the Soviet ;
Union could have enough long- j
range rockets in two years to per- |
mit a massive attack on the
United States.
In his statement to the appro- [
priations group Monday, dates 1
gave assurances as he has be- i
fore that the Soviet Union would
have only a moderate numerical
superiority in long-range missiles
during the next three years, lie
said anew that over-all U.S. retali
atory capability will be enough to :
deter the Soviet Union from any ,
sane decision to attack.
