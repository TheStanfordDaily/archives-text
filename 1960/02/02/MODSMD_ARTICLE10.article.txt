# AT PRESS HOSTEL
## ASSU Hostel Discusses 'Responsibility of Press' 
### Austin Scott 
Fight Stanford students and
two professional journalists dis
cussed the question "The I-tespon
sibilit > of I ho American Press" at
last weekend's hostel.
Paul Edwards, former district
manager and chief editorial writer
for the Xcripps Howard papers
and Boyd Maighl, managing edi
tor of the Palo Alto Times, led
the hostel, held Friday and Sal to
day at the San Francisco YMCA
camp tie ir La I Jonda.
Discussion started with the
(]uestion of how much a news
paper should undertake on its
own should it sit back and ac
cept publicity handouts or should
it do its own sleuthing?
The 'group concluded that the
press should ferret out news. They
thought that newspapers have a
responsibility to uncover facts
;ui(i inform the public.
I'ress Is Own Censor
The members thought that the
press should have the final say as
to what il prints. No other organ
ization should have the right to
tell it what and what not to pub
lish.
(>n the question of bias, opin
ions split. Should a newspaper
print both sides of an issue, even
if il disagrees with one of them?
The general opinion was yes.
People depend on papers for in
formation. A paper may take any
stand il wished on the editorial
pa !'< ;. but news should be

[straight, factual and lair to ail
sides.
To I lie question "What makes a
good newspaper?" Edwards re
plied :
"A good newspaper should be
like a good neighbor. It should
tell me the little things going on
in the neighborhood, just like ;i
goorl neighbor might. It should
tell me what's going on in the
world, just like a good neighbor.
;I! should give me its opinion on
important issues, and it should
do all this in a friendly and en
tertaining fashion, just like ;i
good neighbor."
Newspaper Problems
Ilaight emphasized that today's
i newspapers are in a financial
squeeze. Costs are rising faster
than revenue. Specialization is
'also a problem. So much progress
is being made in certain fields
| science, for instance that papers
must specially train reporters to
interpret the consequences of a
development.
Ilaight said another problem is
high turnover. Good men are
ra pld I y leaving the newspaper
field to seek better paying jobs in
industry and elsewhere.
The group concluded that the
freedom of the press depends on
the responsibility of the press.
The public has placed its trust in
the papers. In return for this
trust, papers must make all ef
fort to present the public with
i accurate, fair news.

Fight Stanford students and
two professional journalists dis
cussed the question "The I-tespon
sibilit > of I ho American Press" at
last weekend's hostel.
Paul Edwards, former district
manager and chief editorial writer
for the Xcripps Howard papers
and Boyd Maighl, managing edi
tor of the Palo Alto Times, led
the hostel, held Friday and Sal to
day at the San Francisco YMCA
camp tie ir La I Jonda.
Discussion started with the
(]uestion of how much a news
paper should undertake on its
own should it sit back and ac
cept publicity handouts or should
it do its own sleuthing?
The 'group concluded that the
press should ferret out news. They
thought that newspapers have a
responsibility to uncover facts
;ui(i inform the public.
I'ress Is Own Censor
The members thought that the
press should have the final say as
to what il prints. No other organ
ization should have the right to
tell it what and what not to pub
lish.
(>n the question of bias, opin
ions split. Should a newspaper
print both sides of an issue, even
if il disagrees with one of them?
The general opinion was yes.
People depend on papers for in
formation. A paper may take any
stand il wished on the editorial
pa !'< ;. but news should be

[straight, factual and lair to ail
sides.
To I lie question "What makes a
good newspaper?" Edwards re
plied :
"A good newspaper should be
like a good neighbor. It should
tell me the little things going on
in the neighborhood, just like ;i
goorl neighbor might. It should
tell me what's going on in the
world, just like a good neighbor.
;I! should give me its opinion on
important issues, and it should
do all this in a friendly and en
tertaining fashion, just like ;i
good neighbor."
Newspaper Problems
Ilaight emphasized that today's
i newspapers are in a financial
squeeze. Costs are rising faster
than revenue. Specialization is
'also a problem. So much progress
is being made in certain fields
| science, for instance that papers
must specially train reporters to
interpret the consequences of a
development.
Ilaight said another problem is
high turnover. Good men are
ra pld I y leaving the newspaper
field to seek better paying jobs in
industry and elsewhere.
The group concluded that the
freedom of the press depends on
the responsibility of the press.
The public has placed its trust in
the papers. In return for this
