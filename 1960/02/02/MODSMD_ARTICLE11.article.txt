## Die-Hards Routed By Army Dictate 
### 
ALGIERS (/Pi The French in-;
surrection in Algiers ended in
gloriously yesterday with one of;
the two leaders in custody and
the other in flight.
The last die-hards marched out
of the barricades after getting a
harsh army dictate to form a unit j
with the French Foreign Legion '
to fight Algeria's Moslem rebels'
jor go home and face possible
| trial for subversion.
Moving firmly to end the eight
day uprising, President Charles
de Gaulle's government laid down
the unbending alternatives. They
were relayed to the insurgentsj
by a para troop colonel at a meet
ing behind the barricades Sunday
night.
Special Unit
A government spokesman said (
120 of the insurgents who surren
dered with their goateed military
| leader, Pierre Lagaillarde, agreed
to serve with the Legion as a spe
cial unit. Gen. Jean Crepin, Al
giers corps commander, said
they would fight the Algerian
i nationalists who have been in re
' volt against French rule for live |
I years.
Lagaillarde, 2f>, a deputy in the j
I French Parliament, was in the
; hands of the authorities, and his,
' fate apparently will be considered
: separately.
Joseph Arti/, the saloon keeper
; who was political boss of the in-1
surrection, fled as his comrades
filed out of the barricades to sur- I
i render. The spokesman had no ,
news of his whereabouts.

Investigations Faced
The spokesman said all the men
| with Lagaillarde had been told
they could return to their families
but that if they did so they faced
investigations.
These investigations would be
j made by authorities sent from
{ Paris, not local officials who
: might be sympathetic. Those in
surgents would be tried who were
J found to have participated in an
j "attack on the internal security
of the state," the spokesman said.
The investigations also appar
ently apply to all the men who
j were in Ihe barricades at one
time or another during the up
! rising.
Settlers' Rising
The settlers' rising that began !
Jan. 24 with a street battle in
which 21 died collapsed without
another shot fired.
The insurgents were loaded into
army trucks and taken to a camp
near Algiers.
Down came the insurgents' bar- '
ricades of paving stone and rub- I
ble-bristling symbols of their de-!
fiance of President de Gaulle's
policy of self-determination for
Algeria's nine million Moslems.
Overwhelming Force
After de Gaulle's speech Friday
commanding the army to restore
order, the Algiers generals]
brought up overwhelming force j
Sunday. They cordoned off the
insurgent camp in the center of j
the city from direct support of the
civilian population.
When the showdown came, tho j
screaming mobs who had cheered
the insurgents with cries of "Al
geria is French" were nowhere in
sight.
