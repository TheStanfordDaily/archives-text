PARIS (/Pi The French gov
ernment decided yesterday I<> ask
lor broad special power's to clean
Up tin? aftermath of Hie Algerian
rebellion. Parliament was called
into an emergency one-day ses
| sion today to approve the request.
The call for practically unlimit
ed authority which will be
(vested in the Cabinet, not in the
personal hands of .Pre si dent
Char les de Gaulle came quickly
on the heels of the collapse of the
revolt. But De Gaulle dominates
the Cabinet.
Legislation by Decree
' The special powers would give
the government the right to legis
late by decree lor a limited pe
riod, probably abo u t. thr e e
months. One observer said it

I'AIJIS (/p) — I'ierre Lagail
larde, defeated leader of the Al
giers insurgents, was flown to
Paris last night and put in
prison.
Lagaillarde arrived h< re in a
military plane.
The paratroop reserve lieu
tenant and <1 ep u I y in th e
French National Assembly was
taken to the grim Sante Prison
under heavy guard.
A policeman told Lagaillarde
at the airport thai an order for
his arrest had been issued by
Algiers courts, charging him
with an attack on the security
of the state.

: would be "like a state of seigc,
j without the formal proelama
■ tion."
A communique published after
a Cabinet meeting gave not the
.slightest hint of why the govern
ment thinks it. needs the special
I powers or what it intends to do
with them.
It was generally believed, how
ever, that De Gaulle and the gov
ernment intend to move quickly
and firmly against civil and mili
tary chiefs in Algeria who let the
right-wing extremist elements get
out of hand.
Ciles < onstitution '
Parliament will be presented
with a short bill which cites Ar
ticle 38 of the French Constitu
tion. This article says:"The gov
| eminent can, for execution of its
i program, ask Parliament for au
thorization to take by decree,
during a limited time, measures
which normally are the domain of
Hie legislature."
De Gaulle's prestige got anoth
er big boosl yesterday when prac
tically all France stopped work
for an hour between 11 a.m. and
noon. In an almost unheard-of
show of unanimity, all labor un
ions backed the strike call to show
support for the President and de
fiance of the Algerian dissidents.
To Solidify Nation
The strike, which had been or
ganized with the tolerance of the
government, was intended to sol
idify the nation behind the Presi
dent's leadership in the crisis.
With this solid show, Parlia
ment is not likely to quibble about
granting special powers. A big, en
thusiastic majority is assured in
the National Assembly. The Sen
ate. which is further to the right
than the Assembly an,d does not
have a solid core of personal fol
lowers of 1 )e Gaulle, may bo more
hesitant. It is unlikely, however,
that it will refuse.
