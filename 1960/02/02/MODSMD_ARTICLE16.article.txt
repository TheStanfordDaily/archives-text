Listener - supported KPFA-FM
has a heretical philosophy: it be
lieves that the members of its
audience are intelligent, sensitive
and cultivated.
It broadcasts no commercials,
and it lives on $12 a year subscrip
tions from approximately two per
cent of the FM set owners in the
Bay Area.
KPFA in Berkeley is run by
a nonprofit organization called
the Pacifica Foundation which
several months ago established
a similar station, KPFK, in Los
Angeles, and has just taken
over the operation of station
W BAI in New York.
In the words of Pacifiea's presi
dent, Harold Winkler, their kind
of noncommercial station means
that they "will be free to do the
type of broadcasting that cannot
be done by a station beholden to
commercial sponsors, to a govern
ment agency, or, for that matter,
even to some big, established uni
versity. We're completely inde
pendent, so we don't ever have to
succumb to the temptation to play
safe. We thrive fin controversy,
intelligent controversy. We can
—and, in fact, we do take the
First Amendment seriously, deem
ing it important that unpopular,
minority viewpoints should have
an opportunity to be heard. With
none of the usual ogres to inhibil
us, we have nobody to blame but
ourselves if'we don't do a good
job."
Tonight at 10:30 KPFA will
carry a recording by Radio Mos
cow, part of a new exchange
project, on Moscow Today.
Saturday morning Alan
Watts will talk on Philosophy
East and West. Next week
there will be readings from
Leaves of Grass, a panel dis
cussion of Darwin and our
Century with Ahlous Huxley
as moderator, a recording of
the 1 Warsaw Festival and
an address by Dr. Robert M.
Ifutchins, President of the Fund
for the Republic.
Past years have been filled with
unabridged performances of plays
by authors ranging from Aeschy
lus to Sartre and including most
of Shakespeare (a good many of
these performances, by distin
guished casts, have been put on
through the courtesy of the
British Broadcasting Corpora
tion's Third Programme, with
which the station has a consid
erable affinity).
KPFA is probably the only sta
tion in the country whose panel
of regular political commentators
includes both a Marxist (Herbert

! Apt heller) and a reactionary
: (Russell Kirk).
The station's concept in pro
gramming contains five main
categories:
• Music, including ethnic and
folk music and studies in the
jazz genre, but with the prin
cipal emphasis 011 serious
music. Popular dance music
of the day is not used. The
analysis of music forms and
history is part of this category.
• Public Affairs, through indi
i vidual commentaries and group
discussions incorporating as broad
an opinion spectrum as possible,
and with deliberate intention of
enabling minority views on im
portant issues to be heard in due
proportion alongside the more
orthodox.
• Literature and Drama, again
with particular attention to con
temporary work in these fields,
but drawing also upon the excel
lent work of the BBC in classical
drama. The station aims to func
tion as a direct outlet for new
poetry and the presentation of
contemporary poets. Reviews and
lectures are included.
• Philosophy and Sciences, the
latter view also in its philo
sophical ramifications. Techni
cal lectures in science are not
part of the format, but con
siderable emphasis was given
the relationship of modern sci
entific thought to traditional
western philosophies.
• Programs for children.
In the 10 years KPFA has been
in the San Francisco area, it has
amassed 7,500 subscribers. The
station requires roughly $125,000
a year to support the present
level of operations.
It puts out a bi-weokly Folio
listing programs for its subscrib
ers, and is on the air from 7 a.m.
to midnight Monday through
Friday and 9 a.m. to midnight
Saturday and Sunday.
Its audience is believed to
consist of an individual, whose
intention is to listen. The listen
er is assumed to have an alert
ness, an intelligence, an interest
and an attention-span commen
surate with those of the people
preparing and airing the pro
gram.
The opening of WBAI-FM with
Pacifica in New York last month
drew a great flea 1 of attention
from many quarters.
Governor Nelson Rockefeller
hailed the listener-supported sta
tion as "a timely and courageous
innovation" in broadcasting.
The New Yorker took happy
note. So did the Saturday Review.
For those fortunate few with
FM sets here, the listening can be
nothing but joyous.
