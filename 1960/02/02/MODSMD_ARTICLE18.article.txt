Pornography
Editor, The Daily:
In the fifth paragraph of your
editorial, "Who Draws ihe Line,"
you state that I say we need
more pornography. This is irre
sponsible in the extreme and is a
further example of the sort of
thing thai tries Ihe patience of
those most sincerely dedicated to
freedom of ihe press.
I ask that you retract at once
and in full. If you would care
to consult the record, I will supply
you with a copy of my speech.
As with previous speeches at
Stanford I had with me an extra
copy for use by the press if they
wished it. As on previous occa
sions no one on your staff asked
for a copy. Consequently, as on
previous occasions, your report
ing and editorializing has been
inaccurate. This is what I mean
by irresponsibility.
John Henry Merryman
Professor of Law
Editor's note: Since the edi
torial referred to was written
by the editor of Volume l.'Jfi,
Dick Barnes, he will answer
the letter.
Taken from context, Profesor
Merryman's <• o 111 me nt that
"perhaps what we need is more
pornography" could be miscon
strued, and for this I apoligize.
Professor Merryman had cited
several studies showing that
certain types of social offenders
had not been influenced by
pornography.
Pornography was also shown
to be in ways a release for some
tensions, thus perhaps substi
tuting for certain crimes rather
than inciting them. Professor
Merryman then noted that "per
haps what we need is more
pornography." This quote was
also attributed to liini in a Stan
lord Law School student period
ical.

Juke Box
Kditnr, The Daily:
i May we call an exciting and '
i dynamic innovation to your at
tention. A fine specimen of lhat
instigator of fun and good times
-—the juke box has found its way
' into the Collar. Wc would like to
extend our heartiest congratula
. tions to The Cellar Today and To- i
i morrow together with some sug
gestions for additional improve
ments:
1. With the advent of the juke
t>t>x the center booths in the back
room are to be replaced with a
large folding table, easily re
i movable, for purposes of post-1
i prandial dancing. Wc propose
j abolition of one o'clock classes;
I such revelry should be available
j to everyone.
2. The C.T. & T. has also estab
lished a policy whereby two
people are no longer able to sit 1
alone in a booth between the
hours of 12 and 1. We suggest the
following additional restriction:
No person shall gain admittance
I to the dining area of the Cellar
; if it can be -shown that he has
j more than a nodding acquaint
ance with anyone already pres-
I ent.
3. Tuesday noon a delightfully
, wailing verson of "God Bless
: America" was played at least
seven times during the hour.
[Clearly, this is background music
j of a functional variety. Perhaps
the C.T. & T. could commission!
Pat Boone to record ''The Star- i
Spangled Banner." This recording
i could be played promptly at one
o'clock fluting the table retire
i ment ceremonies.
4. Dick Clark should be notified
; immediately. One or more of his
programs could originate at the
j Cellar.
5. Better food could be served. \
