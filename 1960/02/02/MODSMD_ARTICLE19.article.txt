## New, Unauthorized Biography of Nixon Raises Question on Political Dealings 
### 
•ftiior reading "ine hacrs ADout
Nixon An Unauthorized Biog
raphy" by William Costello (Vik
ing Press, 340 pp., $3.95), one
indeed has many new thoughts
regarding the national political
scene.
Richard Nixon has beon such a
controversial political figure since
his arrival in Washington that
numerous articles and now that
ho is a presidential possibility
books have boon written analyz
ing and evaluating his career. Cos
tello's book thus is one of a series
trying to present the public with
opinions on Nixon.
Jerry Voorliis
Nixon started his active politi
cal life in 1946 with the election
campaign for the 80th Congress,
when he ran against five-term
Congressman Jerry Voorhis. Un
der tho direction of Murray
Chotinor, Nixon introduced a new
type of campaign into California;
Madison Avenue had arrived. Ad
vertising slogans, slick innuen
does, and indirect accusations; all
of these were characteristic of
N'ixon's campaigns in 1916, 19.10,
and 1952.
Nixon in his short legislative
career on the whole supported the
conservative Republicans excepl
in his votes for foreign aid pro
grams such as the Marshall Plan.
He was one of the leading fig
ures in the dramatic fight against
the "grave internal Communist
danger" which hid behind every
tree and inside every little red
schoolhouse. However the Alger
Hiss case is perhaps the best re
membered of the "Communist"
scares. 11 was Nixon who did most
of the preliminary work before
the Hvo trials which finally con

victor! Hiss of perjury.
In 1952 the California delega
tion went to the Chicago Repub
lican Convention officially
pledged to Governor Earl Warren
who hoped a deadlock would arise
between the Eisenhower and Taft
forces.
Deadlock
Nixon however realized that
this deadlock would not occur,
and to insure his nomination for
the Vice Presidency maneuvered
the delegation into support of
Eisenhower. His plans succeeded,
and he was nominated by accla
mation for t he second position.
Nixon's primary use in both
Presidential campaigns has been
to do the dirty work for Eisen
hower. The name calling and
political charges have all been
delegated to Nixon, and in both
1952 and 1956, ho resorted lo at
tacks on iho patriotism of the
opposition.
Potential Voters
Never was Iho loyalty of the
Democratic party itself chal
lenged, for its members were po
tential voters. Only the leaders
were accused of betraying the
principles of their party and the
people who supported them.
Nixon's desire was to alienate
the voters from the party organi
zation and thereby split the Demo
crats.
Costello brings the book to a
conclusion on the theme, "Can
we trust Nixon?" The Vice-Presi
dent who campaigned vehemently
against Helen Gahagan Douglas
on the basis of her "pro-Commu

nisi" sentiments now professes
views that are extremely similar
to hers and describes the 1950
Senatorial election as an unfor
tunate incident.
Nixon, who after his election to !
the House worked vehemently for i
the Taft-Hartley Law and was de- j
scribed as an active opponent of
the power of labor, helped to give
the Steel Union an extremely j
favorable settlement in the recent
strike.
In 1956 Nixon ridiculed Steven
son's idea of ending H-bomb tests,
yet the Eisenhower administra
tion carried through the same
plan only two years later.
The Nixon record is certainly
not a picture of all out devotion
to a set of principles unless these
be the increase of Nixon's popu
larity itself.
Gyrations
Costello indicates that Nixon's
ideological gyrations have not
been effective in increasing his
public appeal. People can respect
a solid rock of either liberalism or 1
conservatism, but the man who
changes beliefs at any convenient
moment has very little stature in
American politics.
Nixon has become even more !
disliked for his campaign tactics
of linking his opponent by innu
endo to all the enemies of Amer- j
ica.
Thus as the 1960 elections draw ■
near the question the Republicans i
ask is, "Can wo elect Nixon?" \
and Ihe question of the American
people it, "Can we trust him?"

Nixon started his active politi
cal life in 1946 with the election
campaign for the 80th Congress,
when he ran against five-term
Congressman Jerry Voorhis. Un
der tho direction of Murray
Chotinor, Nixon introduced a new
type of campaign into California;
Madison Avenue had arrived. Ad
vertising slogans, slick innuen
does, and indirect accusations; all
of these were characteristic of
N'ixon's campaigns in 1916, 19.10,
and 1952.
Nixon in his short legislative
career on the whole supported the
conservative Republicans excepl
in his votes for foreign aid pro
grams such as the Marshall Plan.
He was one of the leading fig
ures in the dramatic fight against
the "grave internal Communist
danger" which hid behind every
tree and inside every little red
schoolhouse. However the Alger
Hiss case is perhaps the best re
membered of the "Communist"
scares. 11 was Nixon who did most
of the preliminary work before
the Hvo trials which finally con

victor! Hiss of perjury.
In 1952 the California delega
tion went to the Chicago Repub
lican Convention officially
pledged to Governor Earl Warren
who hoped a deadlock would arise
between the Eisenhower and Taft
forces.
Deadlock
Nixon however realized that
this deadlock would not occur,
and to insure his nomination for
the Vice Presidency maneuvered
the delegation into support of
Eisenhower. His plans succeeded,
and he was nominated by accla
mation for t he second position.
Nixon's primary use in both
Presidential campaigns has been
to do the dirty work for Eisen
hower. The name calling and
political charges have all been
delegated to Nixon, and in both
1952 and 1956, ho resorted lo at
tacks on iho patriotism of the
opposition.
Potential Voters
Never was Iho loyalty of the
Democratic party itself chal
lenged, for its members were po
tential voters. Only the leaders
were accused of betraying the
principles of their party and the
people who supported them.
Nixon's desire was to alienate
the voters from the party organi
zation and thereby split the Demo
crats.
Costello brings the book to a
conclusion on the theme, "Can
we trust Nixon?" The Vice-Presi
dent who campaigned vehemently
against Helen Gahagan Douglas
on the basis of her "pro-Commu

nisi" sentiments now professes
views that are extremely similar
to hers and describes the 1950
Senatorial election as an unfor
tunate incident.
Nixon, who after his election to !
the House worked vehemently for i
the Taft-Hartley Law and was de- j
scribed as an active opponent of
the power of labor, helped to give
the Steel Union an extremely j
favorable settlement in the recent
strike.
In 1956 Nixon ridiculed Steven
son's idea of ending H-bomb tests,
yet the Eisenhower administra
tion carried through the same
plan only two years later.
The Nixon record is certainly
not a picture of all out devotion
to a set of principles unless these
be the increase of Nixon's popu
larity itself.
Gyrations
Costello indicates that Nixon's
ideological gyrations have not
been effective in increasing his
public appeal. People can respect
a solid rock of either liberalism or 1
conservatism, but the man who
changes beliefs at any convenient
moment has very little stature in
American politics.
Nixon has become even more !
disliked for his campaign tactics
of linking his opponent by innu
endo to all the enemies of Amer- j
ica.
Thus as the 1960 elections draw ■
near the question the Republicans i
ask is, "Can wo elect Nixon?" \
and Ihe question of the American
people it, "Can we trust him?"

in his votes for foreign aid pro
grams such as the Marshall Plan.
He was one of the leading fig
ures in the dramatic fight against
the "grave internal Communist
danger" which hid behind every
tree and inside every little red
schoolhouse. However the Alger
Hiss case is perhaps the best re
membered of the "Communist"
scares. 11 was Nixon who did most
of the preliminary work before
the Hvo trials which finally con

victor! Hiss of perjury.
In 1952 the California delega
tion went to the Chicago Repub
lican Convention officially
pledged to Governor Earl Warren
who hoped a deadlock would arise
between the Eisenhower and Taft
forces.
Deadlock
Nixon however realized that
this deadlock would not occur,
and to insure his nomination for
the Vice Presidency maneuvered
the delegation into support of
Eisenhower. His plans succeeded,
and he was nominated by accla
mation for t he second position.
Nixon's primary use in both
Presidential campaigns has been
to do the dirty work for Eisen
hower. The name calling and
political charges have all been
delegated to Nixon, and in both
1952 and 1956, ho resorted lo at
tacks on iho patriotism of the
opposition.
Potential Voters
Never was Iho loyalty of the
Democratic party itself chal
lenged, for its members were po
tential voters. Only the leaders
were accused of betraying the
principles of their party and the
people who supported them.
Nixon's desire was to alienate
the voters from the party organi
zation and thereby split the Demo
crats.
Costello brings the book to a
conclusion on the theme, "Can
we trust Nixon?" The Vice-Presi
dent who campaigned vehemently
against Helen Gahagan Douglas
on the basis of her "pro-Commu

nisi" sentiments now professes
views that are extremely similar
to hers and describes the 1950
Senatorial election as an unfor
tunate incident.
Nixon, who after his election to !
the House worked vehemently for i
the Taft-Hartley Law and was de- j
scribed as an active opponent of
the power of labor, helped to give
the Steel Union an extremely j
favorable settlement in the recent
strike.
In 1956 Nixon ridiculed Steven
son's idea of ending H-bomb tests,
yet the Eisenhower administra
tion carried through the same
plan only two years later.
The Nixon record is certainly
not a picture of all out devotion
to a set of principles unless these
be the increase of Nixon's popu
larity itself.
Gyrations
Costello indicates that Nixon's
ideological gyrations have not
been effective in increasing his
public appeal. People can respect
a solid rock of either liberalism or 1
conservatism, but the man who
changes beliefs at any convenient
moment has very little stature in
American politics.
Nixon has become even more !
disliked for his campaign tactics
of linking his opponent by innu
endo to all the enemies of Amer- j
ica.
Thus as the 1960 elections draw ■
near the question the Republicans i
ask is, "Can wo elect Nixon?" \
and Ihe question of the American
people it, "Can we trust him?"

indeed has many new thoughts
regarding the national political
scene.
Richard Nixon has beon such a
controversial political figure since
his arrival in Washington that
numerous articles and now that

books have boon written analyz
ing and evaluating his career. Cos

opinions on Nixon.
Jerry Voorliis
Nixon started his active politi
cal life in 1946 with the election
campaign for the 80th Congress,
when he ran against five-term
Congressman Jerry Voorhis. Un
der tho direction of Murray
Chotinor, Nixon introduced a new
type of campaign into California;
Madison Avenue had arrived. Ad
vertising slogans, slick innuen
does, and indirect accusations; all
of these were characteristic of
N'ixon's campaigns in 1916, 19.10,
and 1952.
