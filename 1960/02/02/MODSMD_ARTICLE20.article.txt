### 
From IVessbox to Sports Desk
Well, as former sports editor John Scliwarz has indicated a new
regime has taken over on the sports page and I hope I can con
tinue t he fine work as John and my predecessors have accomplished.
New things to be seen on the sports page this winter and spring
will be: a new column by Hon Rapoport who will undoubtedly give
us a Big Ton influence as Ik 1 resides at North Muskegon, Mich.; Dick
Karnes will return with his old standby, The Finish Line, which will
feature Track and especially plans for the Summer Olympics; and
John Schwarz will return with Raqneteering and the inside dope
on tennis.
Now a few notes from the weekend ports news. Last night
after seeing the pro game up in San Francisco, Wilt Chamherlin
certainly showed that he can do a lot to simplify basketball with
his defense, rebounding and scoring as lie led his Philadelphia War
riors over' the Minneapolis Lakers, 111104. Perhaps of more local
interest was the pre-game show between the 49ers, a squad which
starred K. C. Owens and John Thomas, and the Old Pros which
featured Stanford cage coach Howie Dalhnur at center.
Although Dallmar got raked over the coals by Sail Francisco
Lxaminer reporter Bob Brachman for his supposed awkwardness

and inability to shoot due to his
long lay-off, Dallmar certainly
baffled the 4f)ers with his decep
tive passes and team play. Dall
mar looked in pretty good shape
considering he has been out of
active competition for at least
fifteen years and certainly was a
crowd pleaser at the game.
Alter the weekend Stanford
basketball games we're left in
somewhat a bewildered state.
How will the Cards fare against
the southern powerhouses USC
and UCLA? Against OSC, Bub
Bowling looked very good at
guard and his passing was cer
tainly something to behold, Phil
Kelly looked good in spots al
though he had a much better
game against Oregon but cer
tainly the team was hurt without
captain John Arrillaga. the only
consistent shot on the team.
Against Oregon it was a dif
ferent story as John Windsor had
one of his better games and Ar
rillaga returned in the second half

to take up the slack against the highly touted Ducks. However, USC
is definitely belter than Ihe Oregon schools and I'd.A is not weak
either so the Tribe must look forward to tough contests both nights
in L.A.
Outlook Good ill Spring
Taking a look at the two major spring sports baseball and
track it is safe to say that the coaches Dutch Fehring, for the base
bailers, and Payton Jordon, for the thinelads. are at least optimistic
as to their season prospects.
Mickey Holzman speaking for Dutch, and giving the baseball
outlook, says the C'IBA will be better this season than in years
past and figures that perhaps S(' and Santa Clara will give the
Indians their toughest battles. Stanford was hit very lightly by
graduation last year as they lost only two outfielders ilarry Kodda
and Kick Defahio and two infielders Art von Wronski and Joel
Newkirk and pitchers John (Jillis and Roy l.awson won't he
back this year. This makes the Cards look very strong in nearly
all positions. For the first time in many years the Tribe will be able
10 field an experienced infield .
On the track side, Jordan said that his men are extremely con
fident this year and a rc\al test may come for the cindermen in their
triangle meet with San Jose Slate and Kansas the one, two teams
in the NCAA finals last year. He stated that Stanford should have
lour or maybe five performers in the Olympics this summer i.e.
Krnie Cunliffe, Beriil Lundh, John Kelly, Norman Lloyd and Keith
Wallace and these five are working hard to get into shape. The
Olympic trials will be at Stanford in July so the trackmen have
an added incentive to get ready for the season.
\\ liafs Happening at BAC?
We at The Daily always appreciate the fine support from the
Athletic Department and especially from Don Liebendorfer and
< buck Taylor but we would like to make one small inquiry into
the selection of senior managers. As has been the custom in years
past the managers would work up in the major sports as assistants,
then take over their senior year with two or three years of experi
ence. However, sometimes a junior takes the job when no -seniors
are available as was the case with Hal Lovell last year for baseball
and Jerry Otcliis this year in football. Both managers did good jobs
and were recommended to return and Lovell did so for for baseball.
Now it seems that there is an equally old rule or tradition that a
senior manager can't succeed himself and although Otcliis certainly
did a good job and has lots of valuable experience all of us on the
sports staff come into contact with the football managers on trips
he was not asked to return. This old rule of non-succession was
given as the reason.
Now we can only ask ourselves, what's fair for the 'baseball
manager is not for the football manager? Certainly both boys
did a good job and should be permitted to return for the athletic
department's own good. We can only inquire but would like to
know what is happening in the manager-choosing department over
at the BAC?

Although Dallmar got raked over the coals by Sail Francisco
Lxaminer reporter Bob Brachman for his supposed awkwardness

and inability to shoot due to his
long lay-off, Dallmar certainly
baffled the 4f)ers with his decep
tive passes and team play. Dall
mar looked in pretty good shape
considering he has been out of
active competition for at least
fifteen years and certainly was a
crowd pleaser at the game.
Alter the weekend Stanford
basketball games we're left in
somewhat a bewildered state.
How will the Cards fare against
the southern powerhouses USC
and UCLA? Against OSC, Bub
Bowling looked very good at
guard and his passing was cer
tainly something to behold, Phil
Kelly looked good in spots al
though he had a much better
game against Oregon but cer
tainly the team was hurt without
captain John Arrillaga. the only
consistent shot on the team.
Against Oregon it was a dif
ferent story as John Windsor had
one of his better games and Ar
rillaga returned in the second half

to take up the slack against the highly touted Ducks. However, USC
is definitely belter than Ihe Oregon schools and I'd.A is not weak
either so the Tribe must look forward to tough contests both nights
in L.A.
Outlook Good ill Spring
Taking a look at the two major spring sports baseball and
track it is safe to say that the coaches Dutch Fehring, for the base
bailers, and Payton Jordon, for the thinelads. are at least optimistic
as to their season prospects.
Mickey Holzman speaking for Dutch, and giving the baseball
outlook, says the C'IBA will be better this season than in years
past and figures that perhaps S(' and Santa Clara will give the
Indians their toughest battles. Stanford was hit very lightly by
graduation last year as they lost only two outfielders ilarry Kodda
and Kick Defahio and two infielders Art von Wronski and Joel
Newkirk and pitchers John (Jillis and Roy l.awson won't he
back this year. This makes the Cards look very strong in nearly
all positions. For the first time in many years the Tribe will be able
10 field an experienced infield .
On the track side, Jordan said that his men are extremely con
fident this year and a rc\al test may come for the cindermen in their
triangle meet with San Jose Slate and Kansas the one, two teams
in the NCAA finals last year. He stated that Stanford should have
lour or maybe five performers in the Olympics this summer i.e.
Krnie Cunliffe, Beriil Lundh, John Kelly, Norman Lloyd and Keith
Wallace and these five are working hard to get into shape. The
Olympic trials will be at Stanford in July so the trackmen have
an added incentive to get ready for the season.
\\ liafs Happening at BAC?
We at The Daily always appreciate the fine support from the
Athletic Department and especially from Don Liebendorfer and
< buck Taylor but we would like to make one small inquiry into
the selection of senior managers. As has been the custom in years
past the managers would work up in the major sports as assistants,
then take over their senior year with two or three years of experi
ence. However, sometimes a junior takes the job when no -seniors
are available as was the case with Hal Lovell last year for baseball
and Jerry Otcliis this year in football. Both managers did good jobs
and were recommended to return and Lovell did so for for baseball.
Now it seems that there is an equally old rule or tradition that a
senior manager can't succeed himself and although Otcliis certainly
did a good job and has lots of valuable experience all of us on the
sports staff come into contact with the football managers on trips
he was not asked to return. This old rule of non-succession was
given as the reason.
Now we can only ask ourselves, what's fair for the 'baseball
manager is not for the football manager? Certainly both boys
did a good job and should be permitted to return for the athletic
department's own good. We can only inquire but would like to
know what is happening in the manager-choosing department over
at the BAC?


COACH lIOWIK DALLMAR
Returns to action?
From IVessbox to Sports Desk
Well, as former sports editor John Scliwarz has indicated a new
regime has taken over on the sports page and I hope I can con
tinue t he fine work as John and my predecessors have accomplished.
New things to be seen on the sports page this winter and spring
will be: a new column by Hon Rapoport who will undoubtedly give
us a Big Ton influence as Ik 1 resides at North Muskegon, Mich.; Dick
Karnes will return with his old standby, The Finish Line, which will
feature Track and especially plans for the Summer Olympics; and
John Schwarz will return with Raqneteering and the inside dope
on tennis.
Now a few notes from the weekend ports news. Last night
after seeing the pro game up in San Francisco, Wilt Chamherlin
certainly showed that he can do a lot to simplify basketball with
his defense, rebounding and scoring as lie led his Philadelphia War
riors over' the Minneapolis Lakers, 111104. Perhaps of more local
interest was the pre-game show between the 49ers, a squad which
starred K. C. Owens and John Thomas, and the Old Pros which
featured Stanford cage coach Howie Dalhnur at center.

is definitely belter than Ihe Oregon schools and I'd.A is not weak
either so the Tribe must look forward to tough contests both nights
in L.A.
Outlook Good ill Spring
Taking a look at the two major spring sports baseball and
track it is safe to say that the coaches Dutch Fehring, for the base
bailers, and Payton Jordon, for the thinelads. are at least optimistic
as to their season prospects.
Mickey Holzman speaking for Dutch, and giving the baseball
outlook, says the C'IBA will be better this season than in years
past and figures that perhaps S(' and Santa Clara will give the
Indians their toughest battles. Stanford was hit very lightly by
graduation last year as they lost only two outfielders ilarry Kodda
and Kick Defahio and two infielders Art von Wronski and Joel
Newkirk and pitchers John (Jillis and Roy l.awson won't he
back this year. This makes the Cards look very strong in nearly
all positions. For the first time in many years the Tribe will be able
10 field an experienced infield .
On the track side, Jordan said that his men are extremely con
fident this year and a rc\al test may come for the cindermen in their
triangle meet with San Jose Slate and Kansas the one, two teams
in the NCAA finals last year. He stated that Stanford should have
lour or maybe five performers in the Olympics this summer i.e.
Krnie Cunliffe, Beriil Lundh, John Kelly, Norman Lloyd and Keith
Wallace and these five are working hard to get into shape. The
Olympic trials will be at Stanford in July so the trackmen have
an added incentive to get ready for the season.
\\ liafs Happening at BAC?
We at The Daily always appreciate the fine support from the
Athletic Department and especially from Don Liebendorfer and
< buck Taylor but we would like to make one small inquiry into
the selection of senior managers. As has been the custom in years
past the managers would work up in the major sports as assistants,
then take over their senior year with two or three years of experi
ence. However, sometimes a junior takes the job when no -seniors
are available as was the case with Hal Lovell last year for baseball
and Jerry Otcliis this year in football. Both managers did good jobs
and were recommended to return and Lovell did so for for baseball.
Now it seems that there is an equally old rule or tradition that a
senior manager can't succeed himself and although Otcliis certainly
did a good job and has lots of valuable experience all of us on the
sports staff come into contact with the football managers on trips
he was not asked to return. This old rule of non-succession was
given as the reason.
Now we can only ask ourselves, what's fair for the 'baseball
manager is not for the football manager? Certainly both boys
did a good job and should be permitted to return for the athletic
department's own good. We can only inquire but would like to
know what is happening in the manager-choosing department over
at the BAC?


COACH lIOWIK DALLMAR
Returns to action?
From IVessbox to Sports Desk
Well, as former sports editor John Scliwarz has indicated a new
regime has taken over on the sports page and I hope I can con
tinue t he fine work as John and my predecessors have accomplished.
New things to be seen on the sports page this winter and spring
will be: a new column by Hon Rapoport who will undoubtedly give
us a Big Ton influence as Ik 1 resides at North Muskegon, Mich.; Dick
Karnes will return with his old standby, The Finish Line, which will
feature Track and especially plans for the Summer Olympics; and
John Schwarz will return with Raqneteering and the inside dope
on tennis.
Now a few notes from the weekend ports news. Last night
after seeing the pro game up in San Francisco, Wilt Chamherlin
certainly showed that he can do a lot to simplify basketball with
his defense, rebounding and scoring as lie led his Philadelphia War
riors over' the Minneapolis Lakers, 111104. Perhaps of more local
interest was the pre-game show between the 49ers, a squad which
starred K. C. Owens and John Thomas, and the Old Pros which
featured Stanford cage coach Howie Dalhnur at center.
Although Dallmar got raked over the coals by Sail Francisco
Lxaminer reporter Bob Brachman for his supposed awkwardness

and inability to shoot due to his
long lay-off, Dallmar certainly
baffled the 4f)ers with his decep
tive passes and team play. Dall
mar looked in pretty good shape
considering he has been out of
active competition for at least
fifteen years and certainly was a
crowd pleaser at the game.
Alter the weekend Stanford
basketball games we're left in
somewhat a bewildered state.
How will the Cards fare against
the southern powerhouses USC
and UCLA? Against OSC, Bub
Bowling looked very good at
guard and his passing was cer
tainly something to behold, Phil
Kelly looked good in spots al
though he had a much better
game against Oregon but cer
tainly the team was hurt without
captain John Arrillaga. the only
consistent shot on the team.
Against Oregon it was a dif
ferent story as John Windsor had
one of his better games and Ar
rillaga returned in the second half

to take up the slack against the highly touted Ducks. However, USC
is definitely belter than Ihe Oregon schools and I'd.A is not weak
either so the Tribe must look forward to tough contests both nights
