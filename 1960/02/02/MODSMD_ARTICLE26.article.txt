# Too Much Snow?
## 
### 
SQUAW VALLEY. Calif. (/P) -
A blizzard hit the Sierra yester
day but Winter Olympics officials
faced more serious, complex prob
lems than snow.
A landslide on transcontinental
U.S. Highway 10 blocked west
bound traffic, which was rerouted
over windy two-lane state high
way 20 in the heart of the moun
tain country. Eastbound traffic
on the divided highway was not
affected.
