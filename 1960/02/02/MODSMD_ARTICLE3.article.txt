# HITS TARGET AREA
## Soviet Concludes Rocket Test With 2nd Successful Missile 
### 
MOSCOW (/!') The Soviet
Union wound up its mid-Pacific
rocket tests yesterday with the
announeemen! that a second mis
sile had landed in its ocean target
area. Unlike the first one, there
was no hint of how close it came
1o any bull's-eye staked out in ad
vance.
"Measurement data again con
firmed the high precision of the
rocket flight guidance," the offi
cial announcement proclaimed.
Tass distributed the bulletin
around the world, and Moscow
Radio broke into its programs
with trumpet flourishings and
stirring march tunes.
The bulletin, coinciding with

the start of a top-level Commu
nist-bloc meeting here for maxi
mum political effect, showed one
major difference from Ihe an
nouncement of the first test held
Jan. 21).
That announcement said the
first rocket had landed only 1.24
miles from its predetermined tar
get after a flight of 7,760 miles.
Top speed was listed as 16,250
miles an hour.
Such information was omitted
Monday, and there was no indica
tion why.
Site Unknown
Moscow has never disclosed the
launching site of its mid-Pacific
rockets. It is believed to bo east
of the Caspian Sea, however,
whence similar range missiles
could reach almost any point in
the United States.
Tass said that the second rock
et, fired Sunday night, landed "in
the target area in the Pacific."
The announcement did not say
whether it had hit a pinpoint tar
gel, if there was one. The entire
target range covered 4'1,000
square miles, about 1,000 miles
southwest of Hawaii.
Tass reported that Sunday's
firing "completed the present
stage of development work."
I'lanets Next Target?
A Soviet rocket expert told Tass
Ihe Pacific tests had proved "the
exceptional dependability and ac
curacy" of the automatic rocket
guidance system developed by So
viet scientists.
Prof. Goorgy Pokrovsky said
Soviet rockets are capable of an
escape velocity of 12 kilometers
7 1 Li miles per second "quite
enough for flights to the planets
nearest the earth,"
