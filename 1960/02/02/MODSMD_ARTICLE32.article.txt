THREE WHO PASSED IN THE NIGHT
I .ust year, as everyone knows, 1,210,(114 undergraduates dropped
out of college. 250,080 flunked; 1500,050 got married; .'{75,021
ran out of money; and 300,254 found jobs, As you have, of
course, observed, this accounts for only 1,210,011 out of
1,210,014. W hat happened to the other three?
Well sir, to find the answer, 1 recently completed :i tour of
American campuses where I interviewed -10 million students
and sold several subscriptions to Tin Open Road for Hot/a, and
it pleases me to report that I can now account for those three
elusive undergraduates.
The first was an LSI* junior named Fred (laugin. lie was
extremely popular, always ready with a smile, fond of folk
dancing and pralines, and last semester his (hi I 'si brothers
unanimously elected him t rcasurer of the fraternity. This proved
an error, (laugin, alas, promptly absconded with the money
and went to Tahiti to paint. The fraternity is bending every
effort to extradite (laugin, but Tahiti, alas, is currently observ
ing the feast of Dipthong, the Sun-(!od, a five-year ceremony
during which all the islanders wear masks, so nobody, alas, can
say for certain which one is (laugin.

The second missing undergraduate is \\ illiatn ( ullen Sigafoos,
Oregon State freshman, who went one day last fall to a dis
reputable vendor named A. M. Sashweight to buy a pack of
Marlhoros. Mr. Sashweight did not have any Marlhoros be
cause Marlhoros are only sold by reputable vendors. I lowever,
he told Sigafoos that he had another brand which was just as
good, and Sigafoos, being but an innocent freshman, believed
Well sir, you and I know there is no other brand as good as
Marlhoros. That fine filter, that flavorful flavor, that pleasure,
that joy, that fulfillment are Marlboro's and Marlboro s alone.
All of this was quickly apparent to young Sigafoos and lie
flew into a terrible rage. "As good as Marlhoros indeed! lie
shrieked, kicking his roommate furiously. "I am going right
back to that mendacious Mr. Sashweight and give him a thrash
ing he won't soon forget!" With that he seized his lacrosse bat
and rushed out.
Mr. Sashweight heard him coming and started running. Now
Mr. Sashweight, before he became a disreputable vendor, had
taken numerous prizes as a cross-country runner,and he thought
he would soon outdistance young Sigafoos. Hut he reckoned
without Sigafoos's stick-to-itiveness. At last report the two
of them had passed Cleveland. When they reach the Atlantic
Seaboard, bad Mr. Sashweight will ct his lumps from Sigafoos,
you may be sure, and I, for one, am glad.
The third missing undergraduate, also named Sigafoos, is a
Bennington sophomore named Celeste Sigafoos and, ironically,
she never intended to leave college at all. She was merely going
home for Christinas on the Natchez, Mobile, and Boise Kail
road, and during the night, alas, her upper berth slammed shut
on her. Being a Bennington girl, she naturally did not wish to
make an unseemly outcry, so she just kept silent. Ihe next
morning, alas, the railroad went bankrupt, and Miss Sigafoos
today is lying forgotten on a siding near \alparniso, Indiana.
Fortunately she has plenty of Marlhoros with her.

The second missing undergraduate is \\ illiatn ( ullen Sigafoos,
Oregon State freshman, who went one day last fall to a dis
reputable vendor named A. M. Sashweight to buy a pack of
Marlhoros. Mr. Sashweight did not have any Marlhoros be
cause Marlhoros are only sold by reputable vendors. I lowever,
he told Sigafoos that he had another brand which was just as
good, and Sigafoos, being but an innocent freshman, believed
Well sir, you and I know there is no other brand as good as
Marlhoros. That fine filter, that flavorful flavor, that pleasure,
that joy, that fulfillment are Marlboro's and Marlboro s alone.
All of this was quickly apparent to young Sigafoos and lie
flew into a terrible rage. "As good as Marlhoros indeed! lie
shrieked, kicking his roommate furiously. "I am going right
back to that mendacious Mr. Sashweight and give him a thrash
ing he won't soon forget!" With that he seized his lacrosse bat
and rushed out.
Mr. Sashweight heard him coming and started running. Now
Mr. Sashweight, before he became a disreputable vendor, had
taken numerous prizes as a cross-country runner,and he thought
he would soon outdistance young Sigafoos. Hut he reckoned
without Sigafoos's stick-to-itiveness. At last report the two

Seaboard, bad Mr. Sashweight will ct his lumps from Sigafoos,
you may be sure, and I, for one, am glad.
The third missing undergraduate, also named Sigafoos, is a
Bennington sophomore named Celeste Sigafoos and, ironically,
she never intended to leave college at all. She was merely going
home for Christinas on the Natchez, Mobile, and Boise Kail
road, and during the night, alas, her upper berth slammed shut
on her. Being a Bennington girl, she naturally did not wish to
make an unseemly outcry, so she just kept silent. Ihe next

The first was an LSI* junior named Fred (laugin. lie was
extremely popular, always ready with a smile, fond of folk
dancing and pralines, and last semester his (hi I 'si brothers
unanimously elected him t rcasurer of the fraternity. This proved
an error, (laugin, alas, promptly absconded with the money
and went to Tahiti to paint. The fraternity is bending every
effort to extradite (laugin, but Tahiti, alas, is currently observ
ing the feast of Dipthong, the Sun-(!od, a five-year ceremony
during which all the islanders wear masks, so nobody, alas, can
say for certain which one is (laugin.

The second missing undergraduate is \\ illiatn ( ullen Sigafoos,
Oregon State freshman, who went one day last fall to a dis
reputable vendor named A. M. Sashweight to buy a pack of
Marlhoros. Mr. Sashweight did not have any Marlhoros be
cause Marlhoros are only sold by reputable vendors. I lowever,
he told Sigafoos that he had another brand which was just as
good, and Sigafoos, being but an innocent freshman, believed
Well sir, you and I know there is no other brand as good as
Marlhoros. That fine filter, that flavorful flavor, that pleasure,
that joy, that fulfillment are Marlboro's and Marlboro s alone.
All of this was quickly apparent to young Sigafoos and lie
flew into a terrible rage. "As good as Marlhoros indeed! lie
shrieked, kicking his roommate furiously. "I am going right
back to that mendacious Mr. Sashweight and give him a thrash
ing he won't soon forget!" With that he seized his lacrosse bat
and rushed out.
Mr. Sashweight heard him coming and started running. Now
Mr. Sashweight, before he became a disreputable vendor, had
taken numerous prizes as a cross-country runner,and he thought
he would soon outdistance young Sigafoos. Hut he reckoned
without Sigafoos's stick-to-itiveness. At last report the two
of them had passed Cleveland. When they reach the Atlantic
Seaboard, bad Mr. Sashweight will ct his lumps from Sigafoos,
you may be sure, and I, for one, am glad.
The third missing undergraduate, also named Sigafoos, is a
Bennington sophomore named Celeste Sigafoos and, ironically,
she never intended to leave college at all. She was merely going
home for Christinas on the Natchez, Mobile, and Boise Kail
road, and during the night, alas, her upper berth slammed shut
on her. Being a Bennington girl, she naturally did not wish to
make an unseemly outcry, so she just kept silent. Ihe next
morning, alas, the railroad went bankrupt, and Miss Sigafoos
today is lying forgotten on a siding near \alparniso, Indiana.
Fortunately she has plenty of Marlhoros with her.
