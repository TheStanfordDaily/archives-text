### Keem Stassen 
"The American liberal art col
lege made its way by sealing off
theology into special seminaries,"
Dean Levering Reynolds of Pa
cific University said in Cubber
ley Auditorium last night.
Reynolds went on to describe
changes in Christian thought in
the last half century, emphasiz
ing the effect it has had on the
liberal arts college.
At the turn of the century "New
Theology" came from Germany
and was accepted by much of the
I United States, according to
Reynolds. People began to have
"a new approach to the Bible,"
beginning "to see Jesus as a per
j son." Evolution was becoming ac
cepted by many of the thoughtful
j people of t he time.
Christians were faced with the
problem of "bringing Christianity
to terms witli social concepts,"
Reynolds said. They began to be
lieve that "the Kingdom of God
was not the church, but was the
society of people as God intended
j them to be."
Fundamentalism
In 1910 liberal theology broke
with the conservative group and
Fundamentalism began. People
who said that the Bible could not
"be criticized on a scholarly level"
and that "Darwinism is atheism"
protested the new theology.
Liberals were shut out of many
churches, and conservatives were
shut out of college. According 1o
Reynolds, "no liberal art college
in the United States would teach
conservative theology." As a re
sult Bible schools and colleges be
gan to develop.
Modern Kmpliasis
Much of the modern emphasis
on liberal arts comes from the
liberal theologians of the early
twentieth century, said Reynolds.
These theologians based their
religion on such things as philos
ophy, psychology of religion, com-1
parative religion, and science in-!
stead of on the Bible.
Reynolds is an ordained con
gregational minister. His lecture'
was sponsored by the student
Council on Religious Affairs. j
