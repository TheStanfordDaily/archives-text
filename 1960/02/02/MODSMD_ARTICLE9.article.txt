# WORLD THREAT
## High Birthrate Explained in Science Talk 
### 
Dr. Carey Croneis challenged
mankind to look to the future
in a talk yesterday afternoon on
"Mankind in Scientific Perspec
tive" at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Dr. Croneis, the author of sev
| oral texts and current provost
i and professor of geology at Rice
Institute was the fifth speaker
in a series presented by the
j School of Mineral Sciences.
Referring to man's creation of
lethal atomic weapons, Dr.
Croneis said, "Man's mastery of
physics and biology could be his
; undoing."
j Overpopulation and rapidly in
creasing energy requirements
| are two of the greatest problems
man faces today, he said. A theory
has been proposed that explains
a high birthrate as the result of
insufficient protein in the diet.
| "This would mean that starva
tion is the cause of overpopula
tion," Croneis remarked.
Even if no new industries were
introduced, man's energy needs
one hundred years from now will
be 20(H) times what they are today.
Croneis cited solar energy and
deuterium in sea water as likely
sources to meet the demands.
Croneis's lecture ranged from
religious considerations to ge
netic mutation. Croneis will speak
again tonight at the Tuesday
Evening series in Cubberley Aud
itorium at 8 p.m. He will discuss
"South America People, Re
sources and Problems."
