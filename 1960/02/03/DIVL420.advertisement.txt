Put the Eur-Cal
Tours against any
you want to — the
deluxe ones, the
short ones, the
"bike" ones. See
if you can match
the "let s see ALL
of Europe" itiner
aries, the epicur
ean dining, the ex
tras, the unhurried
pace, the tour
leaders. See if you
can find more dol
lar-for-dollar trav
el value, better
planning, or more
real fun. Go ahe£d.
Compare your
head off. Then see
us. We've got the
real thing. An il
lustrated brochure
describing Eur-
Cal's four tours
<one even visits
Russia!) is yours
for the asking —
just drop us a post
