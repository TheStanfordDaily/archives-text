# Tresidder Plan Needs Assent
## 
### 
The 40-page report of I tie plans for Tresidder Union, published
Jan. 5, has been approved by the Ad Hoc Committee and is now
waiting for approval by the Stanford Union Committee.
Chester Berry, Director of the Union, who hoped last October
'o have the union ready in two years, stated that the union is

progressing faster than he had
anticipated. The next steps for
bringing the union into reality
will be more specialized studies
of individual areas and the draw
ing of preliminary blueprints of
the union.
Thinners Goal
The report states that the goal
toward which the planners are
'driving is to make Tresidder "a
place where friends are made and
ideas challenged, where both
bowling shoes and art prints are
rented, where hamburgers and
good books are consumed, where
jazz combos and string quartets
are both welcome."
The social center of Tresidder,
which is expected to be the
busiest place on campus, will be
the grillroom. This area of 3,900
•square feet will contain three
counters— short order, fountain
and cafeteria, plus a self-service
in which there are separate lines
lor each counter, thus avoiding
the problem of a person dashing
in for a snack having to wait for
someone getting a full meal.
Grillroom Facilities
The grillroom will also contain
alcoves, providing for small
1 un c h e on meetings, discussion
groups and get-togethers of 20-50
people. For larger groups there
will be a dining room, seating
about lot) persons, and available
for luncheon and supper meet
ings.
Outside the grillroom will be a
large terrace, located between
and Bowman which will lend it
self to dining, large dances,
alumni reunions and similar ac
tivities.
Two comfortable and fairly
quiet lounges, each of 2,000 square
feet, are planned to be used for
both organized and unorganized
activities. In addition to being
places for relaxation, they will be
used as areas for lectures, jam
sessions and innumerable other
activities which rfeed an area ac
commodating up to 300 people.
Specialized Quiet Areas
Many other more specialized
quiet areas are planned including
a music lounge with a grand
piano, a browsing room with
newspapers, magazines and cur
rently popular books, music lis
tening rooms with stereophonic
record playing equipment, a
games lounge for bridge and
chess tables, and eight conference
and meeting rooms.
The 14 lane bowling alley will
be the principal part of the games
area and will provide spectator
seating for 11 persons per lane.
Billiards and table tennis are two
other activities included in the
games area. Rather than being
an expense, this area is expected
to provide income which will be
needed in tl\e whole union opera
tion.
Variety of Shops
Shops such as a barber shop,
travel agency, shoe repair store,
and bicycle shop will also be an
integral part of the new Tresidder'
Union.
The union will also encompass
the ASSU facilities, furnishing
spa c e s for offices, meetings,
storage, and a general work area
for campus organizations.
At the heart of this busy build
ing will be the offices for the
union administration. Incorpo
rated in this complex will be an
information center, surrounded by
schedules and bulletin boards,
helping people to be aware of the
numerous activities taking place
at the union.
