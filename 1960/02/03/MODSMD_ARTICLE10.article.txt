# Von Braun, Power Say U.S. Lags Behind Russia
## Speeded-Up Space Program Still Behind Soviet Union 
### 
WASHINGTON (/I 1 ) — The speeded-up U.S. space program is still
not moving fast enough to catch the Soviet Union, rocket expert
Wernher von Braun said yesterday.
Before the years ends, the German-born space scientist added,
the Soviets may well have put a man into orbit around the earth

and dropped a package of live in- '
struments on tlic moon.
Addition to Budget
Present plans call for the
United Slates to boost its first I
Mercury astronaut into orbit in
1961 and to land instruments on
the moon in 1963.
Von Braun's testimony before
the House Committee on Science ;
and Astronautics began in an at -1
mospherc of optimism generated
by President Eisenhower's addi- J
tion of 113 million dollars to his j
new budget to speed up the U.S. I
rocket booster program.
Nearly all the money is for von
Braun's pet project, Saturn, a
mighty booster designed to en
able the United States to put into
orbit 25,000 pound objects—about

A power-packwl Titan passed
its most critical flight test
Tuesday and took a significant
step in its development as
America's farthest-ranging mili
tary rocket.
The 91-foot giant soared into
a clear sky and two minutes
later its big second stage ig
nited with a burst of flame and
carried a dummy warhead to
an Atlantic target 2,000 miles
away.
The upper st ige, which pours
out 80,000 pounds of thrust, is
the biggest and most powerful

United States. This is the first
time it has been fired.

25 times what it can achieve now.
Von Braun said the added
money would bring Saturn into
operation in early 1961, a full
year ahead of the original sched
ule. But the optimism evident at
the hearing vanished when he was
asked how this would leave the
United Slates in the space race
with the Soviet Union.
National Effort. Needed
"The Russians are definitely
several years ahead of us," he
replied, "and we shouldn't expect
wonder."
Von Braun said the United
States has the money, manpower
and resources to capture and
maintain the lead in space. But
a concerted national effort is re
quired, he added.
