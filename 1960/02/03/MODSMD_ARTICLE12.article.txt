Ivise of Neo-Nazism
Dr. Steiner argues that the
blame for the rise of Neo-Nazism
does not lie with the German
people and that all Germans are
not Nazis. He also believes that
the U.S. has helped this rise and
i should have adopted another pol
icy toward the problem.
Dr. Schorske, formerly profes
sor of history at Wesleyan Uni
versity, is now a fellow of the
Ford Foundation. At the end of
World War II he was a member
of the OSS and worked on the
revival of German political par
ties. He will discuss who is to
blame for the rise of Neo-Nazism
and whether this revival is perma
nent or temporary.
