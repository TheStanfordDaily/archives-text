Much has been said recently about the disclaimer affidavit
of the National Defense K.diieation Act; however, there are a few
things which remain to he said before it is dismissed to the halls
of Congress and hopefully to its repeal.
I he article appearing on page two of today's paper reveals
some of the historical background of ihe debate on the affidavit
and shows the danger which such threats pose to ci\il rights and
academic freedom.
The affidavit alone would not have necessitated the great
amount of controversy which has arisen, hut it has become repre
sentative of mam attempts h\ bigoted or unthinking lawmakers
to sequester their own belief* from any competition in the arena
of ideas.
Averell llarriman, during his recent \ iil at Stanford, termed
the disclaimer affidavit "'a hangover from Mc(larthyism," cer
tainly au era of American history which e\ery student of freedom
would like lo forget.
This era ushered in government intervention into the private
lives and thoughts of American citizens iu a measure previously
unknown. Its effect was not onlv to limit subversion action, but
also to stifle any liberal thought or speech which might appear
the least bit questionable lo the self-appointed crusaders.
Such measures as the affidavit also attempt lo do ibis, although
not as effectivelv as did the McCarthy sub-committee.
One standard argument of ihe pro-affidavit followers is that
it seems unreasonable or even abhorrent for ihe government to
give money' to educate students who believe iu any organization
which wishes lo overthrow that same government.
In fact, logically just the opposite argument is valid. By
educating these students and exposing them lo democratic train
ing, thev may compare their own beliefs w illl tenets of democracy,
enabling ihein lo see some of the misconceptions and weaknesses
of th eir beliefs.
Denving them an education merely lends to strengthen their
convictions against the American system of government.
Numerous universities have protested against the inclusion of
the affidavit in ihe JNDKA by r refusing to join the scholarship
program or bv withdrawing from it.
( hie of ihe main reasons for tliei r object ions is that t he require
ment of the oath as a prerequisite to receiving federal funds dis
criminates against students.
Croups such as farmers and pensioners are given money with
out an affidavit: whereas universities, long defenders of academic
freedom, are apparently regarded by some congressmen as centers
of subversion.
The Stanford administration has expressed disfavor with the
requirement to sign: however, it continues to give tacit approval
by administering the Act and conlributing the I Diversity's funds
in the proportion of one lo nine with government funds.
The University has expressed two reasons for refusing to with
draw from the program. The first is that the administration does
not feel it should make the choice for the students to accept or
reject llie money. Secondly, Stanford students will receive
Si.") 1,000 ibis year under the Act, a sum which would be difficult
to procure elsewhere.
Many students have no choice whether lliev wish to accept
1 lie money or not; for without il, they would be unable lo remain
in school. If the administration is actually opposed to the affi
davit, it could assist in finding other funds for those students
who unwillinglv must take the government scholarship.
Moreover, the I niversity cannot assume a passive role in the
controversy, because, in reality, il assumes an active role in the
distributing of the funds and the supplementing of the govern
ment's conl ribut ions.
Although the raising of $154,000 to lake the place of the
NDKA money is not an easv chore, the question of principle
involving academic 1 freedom far overshadows the difficulties
which might arise here. Such universities as Harvard. ale.
Swartlunore, and Oberlin have taken it upon themselves to pro
vide the funds lost when they left the government program.
Recognizing the seriousness of the principle involved, the
Legislature of the ASSU has circulated petitions among the
student body protesting the disclaimer affidavit, but we feel the
most effective way for students lo express their opinion is bv
direct correspondence with their own congressmen.
However, the petitions should be recognizeed as a healthy
sign of student interest and concern; and we regret that this same
concern has not been reflected in the I niversilv's actions.
