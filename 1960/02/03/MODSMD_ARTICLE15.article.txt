Loyalty Oath
Editor, Tin* Daily:
After reading Mr. Chrissinger's
letter in your issue of Jan. 27, I
wonder if he has ever really
studied the loyalty oath. His (lis
agreement with The Daily and
criticism of those opposed to the
Oath are hacked by statements
with which I feel sure we would
all agree.
However, the essentials making
up our pledge to the flag, which
he uses as arguments to defend
his stand, and the provisions mak

! ing up the loyalty oath involve
! two different approaches. The
I former embodies a positive state
i ment which any loyal American
| should he proud to make at any
j time. The latter sets up a nega-
J tive aspect to (he idea of loyalty
! which implies an assumption of
I subversive guilt on the part of
| good citizens unless they are
willing to swear otherwise.
The loyalty oath, a product of
I early cold war hysteria still pre-
I vailing in some quarters, should,
| in my opinion, he scrapped.
