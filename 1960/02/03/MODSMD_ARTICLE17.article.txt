# NDEA CONTROVERSY
## Disclaimer Affidavit's Historical Study Indicates Relation to Views on Security 
### Mike Gordon 
Petitions protesting the contro
versial loyally oath-disclaimer af
fidavit section of ihe National
Defense Education Act (NDEA)
are now being circulated among
Stanford students. Yet are we
really certain we understand what
we are being asked to sign?
Contrary to what some recent
articles in The Daily and else
where have claimed, the original
question of controversy only in
cidentally concerns either a lib
era! or a conservative stand.
Neither does it primarily concern
a stand for or against the Con
stitution or for or against loyalty.
It is rather a question funda
mentally involving two conflict
ing approaches to the welfare and
security of this country with rela
tion to higher education. And
these two approaches are more
clearly understood in the histori
cal context of the origin and de
bate of the National Defense
Education Act.
The Principle
Although Congress officially
passed the NDEA on Sept. 2.
1958, the principle of federal aid
to education has been a center of
hot, but indecisive debate for a
half-century.
But in autumn 1957 the Ameri
can people, who for a decade had
hardly bothered themselves about
Johnny could read, were
first shocked, later embarrassed,
to learn that a group of Russian
scientists had beaten American
scientists in the satellite race into
space.
There was an immediate de
mand for federal action. But since
the education bill was largely
stimulated by security needs, why
not, some of the lawmakers ar
gued, make the bill contain secur
ity measures. Thus the bill as it
passed Congress and came to the
students contained both a loyalty
oath provision and a disclaimer
affidavit requirement.
Security Provision
The security provision of the
NDEA reads as follows: Title X.
Section 1001 (fi,
"No part of any funds appro
priated or otherwise made avail
able for expenditure under
authority of this Act shall be used
to make payments or loans to any
individual unless such individual
(1) has executed and filed with
the Commissioner an affidavit
that he does not believe in, and is
not a member of and does not
support any organization that be
lieves in or teaches, the over
throw of the United States Gov
ernment by force or violence or
by any illegal or unconstitutional
methods, and (2> has taken and
subscribed to an oath or affirma
tion in the following form: 'I do
solemnly swear (or affirm) that
I will bear true faith and alle
giance to the United States
against all its enemies, foreign
and domestic....' "
Protested
As the year passed a consid
erable number of organizations,
both academic and service, pro
tested this affidavit and sought
its repeal. Princeton University
and seven liberal arts colleges
even went so far as to reject the
NDTA because of the implica
tions embodied in the disclaimer
affidavit. In autumn 1959 Harvard
and Yale joined the group.
The protesting colleges and uni
versities thought that they and
their students were being discrim
inated against. These institutions
questioned the relevancy of the
oath of allegiance as a require

ment for educational loans. They
pointed to distinctions between
officials assuming public office
or trust and students applying
for a business transaction be
tween the government and them
selves.
The negative disclaimer affi
davit came under the most severe
attack. By holding out federal
grants in return for signing the
disclaimer, many colleges argued,
the government was in effect reg
ulating personal beliefs. More
over, they questioned the prin
ciple of loyalty by disavowal,
pointing out that neither the affi
davit nor the loyalty oath would
prevent actual subversive ele
ments from exploiting the govern
ment's offer.
Clark-Kennedy Kill
Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare Fleming, joined the
side of the dissenters. With this
hacking, Senators Clark and Ken
nedy introduced to the Senate
Committee on Labor and Public-
Welfare a bill repealing section
1001 (112 i. The bill left the commit
tee and came onto the Senate
floor, where after two days it
bogged down in sharp conflict.
In his article in The Nation
Kevin Sullivan analyzed the
loyally debate into four major
issues.
Four Issues
• The relation of "education" to
defense in the NDEA
• The distinction between a dis
claimer affidavit and a loyally
oath
• The Mundt "little Smith Act"
amendment
• The discriminatory implica
tions in Ihe act.
From the debate it became clear
that many Senators, far from
wanting to improve American
education for its own sake, had
originally supported the NDEA
simply for the purpose of de
fense. Perhaps in the long run
this was the only way to get a
bill giving federal aif 1 to educa
tion.
As opposition to the Kennedy-
Clark bill of repeal rallied, Sena
tor Javits, in an effort lo salvage
it, proposed an amendment to
retain the loyalty oath and strike
oid only the disclaimer affidavit.
This amendment, designed to pac
ify the opposition, barely passed
with a 46-45 vote.
Alarming Fact
As debate continued, however,
an alarming fact now became evi
dent: many senators were unable
to distinguish between a , dis
claimer affidavit and a loyalty
oath. Even when it was proposed
to retain ihe loyalty oath, Senator
Mundt and his supporters fearing
insufficient security measures,
sought to substitute for the dis
claimer affidavit a condensed
version of an earlier government
security act.
However, Kennedy immediately
perceived the essential nature of
the Mundt amendment and lab
eled it a "little Smith Act." Clark
then outlined the legal implica
tions the "little Smith Act" would
entail if adopted. A student who
had already been receiving aid
under the bill, but who would now
be forced to disqualify himself,
would in effect be admitting his
liability to tlie "big" Smith Act.
And this, Clark said, would be
a flagrant violation of the fifth
amendment.
Security Risks
The advocates of the Kennedy-
Clark bill found their most effec
tive argument in the discriminat
ing effects of the disclaimer affi
davit on students. Students in
need of financial aid would, as a
class, be singled out as possible
security risks.
Senator Clark argued that the
main result of the bill has been
to insult the integrity of Ameri
can students. To press his point
he offered to amend the original
bill of repeal and to retain the dis

elaimer affidavit provided that
farmers receiving price supports
and businessmen subsidies would,
like the students, sign a similar
affidavit.
Senator McCarthy of Minne
sota, continuing Senator Clark's
humor, carried the logic of the
affidavit supporters to its ridicu
lous extremes by urging the legis
lators not to forget the affidavit's
applicability to school children
who receive free lunches!
i 'ollapsed
Although the Mundt amend
ment finally collapsed in Con
gress, the Kennedy-Clark bill
faired no better. It went back to
the committee for more discus
sion and compromise. There it has
remained and will remain until it
comes before the floor again this
session.
Since, however, President Eisen
hower has unequivocally come
out in favor of the affidavit's
repeal, it now appears that Sena
tors Clark and Kennedy will be
able to count on more support
in the next round of discussion.
