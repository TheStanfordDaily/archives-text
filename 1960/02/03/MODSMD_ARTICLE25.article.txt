# Candlelight Services Peaceful

### Keem Stassen 
Ever since Stanford's four be
whiskered professors have been
running across Quad, Stanford
students have been running too.
The Wednesday night Candlelight
Service is one place where stu
dents can stop hurrying to get
something done and start wonder
ing what they are doing.
Fourteen years ago. a senior
from Portland, Oregon, decided
that students needed some time
to be quiet. He asked the Chap
lain if there could be a service in
Memorial Church that was for
personal inspiration more than
for group worship.
The Chaplain told him he could
use the church as long as the
service was completely student -
run. Every Wednesday night that
year about ten students met to
listen to readings from the Bible
and to think, in the candlelit
church.

One evening several years ago
two alumni happened to be in
Memorial Church. They sat near
the front of the church and saw
their first Stanford candlelight
service. Both agreed it was an
inspiring service. Both wondered
why so few people were there.
When they turned to leave, they
saw dozens of students leaving
too, students who entered so
quietly that the alumni didn't
think they were there.
Candlelight service has changed
since Walter Pendergrass first
got the Chaplain's permission to
use the church. More than two
hundred people now attend the
service that ten once attended.
Students still plan the entire
service, still ring the bells which
tell people in the libraries that the
service is about to begin, ami stu
dents still play the organ and read
the lesson. Candlelight service

still fills the need for a quiet time
when students can stop rushing
and start wondering.
