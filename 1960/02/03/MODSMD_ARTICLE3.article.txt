"Americans tend to romanticize !
a great deal." observed Birgitte
Vinding, Danish student current- j
ly attending Stanford.
Birgitte, an AASU scholar, says
she came to the United States not
only to experience living and
studying in a foreign country, hut
also to find out whether Ihe cur
rent European notions concerning
Americans are true.
American tourists, according to
Birgitte, impress Europeans as a
people who are always rushing
somewhere, trying to accumulate
more "things" with little regard
to their worth. She now feels this
is not necessarily true for "well- j
educated" Americans.
A political science major with
a special interest in underdevel
oped countries, Birgitte hopes to
work for UNESCO. She came to
Stanford at the recommendation!
of her brother, an ASSU scholar
of 1053-54.
Asked to compare European
and American educational sys
tems, she said that the fewer
number of exams and other dead
lines forced more responsibility
on the European student for plan- ]
ning his study schedule.
On the other hand, she feels
that an opportunity for two,
three, or four years of higher j
education comparable to the |
American college education
should be added to most European
university systems, for many jobs
today do not demand the six to
seven years <>112 extensive study
which discourages many students
