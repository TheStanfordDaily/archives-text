The official statement on Cuba,]
which the President made ;it his
I press conference on last Tuesday, j
: is an approach to a problem of
I which no one can now know the
] solution. The problem is larger
than Cuba, li is the problem of
j what this country is to do about \
the revolutionary movement in
I Latin America, of which Castro's!
! is a spectacular but by no means ;
the only manifestation.
For what is going on in Cuba
is no mere palace revolution
at the top, in which one oli
garchy lias ousted another. This
is a social revolution involving
the masses of the Cuban peo
ple, and its aim is not to install
a new set of rulers but to work
out a new social order.
Our experiment, which began
with the Mexican revolution some!
forty years ago, has taught us i
that armed intervention or even
! economic coercion by blockade, |
embargo, and economic reprisals, \
| do little good and much harm, j
I They do not protect the legitimate
j American interests which are
jeopardized by the revolution and
they make it very difficult to !
come to reasonable settlements j
when the revolutionary fervor I
subsides, and the time of recoil- j
ri]ation and reconstruction ar- 5
rives.
In his press conference Ihe,
President said that "we are con
cerned, and more than thai, we
are perplexed" about the savage
attacks made upon us by Castro
and his government and the
Cuban press. Pnfortunately Iho
truth, though very unpleasant. I
is noi perplexing. Il is that to at
lack this country is popular, that
ii rallies mass support not only :
in Cuba but in many other conn- |
tries in this hemisphere. If we 1
really face it, we have to realize
that in our relations with Latin
America we have, with notable i
exceptions, identified ourselves!
with ihe support of the past and
as opponents of ihe future. The
chickens are coming home to
roost. To be anti-Yankee is to be
popular and progressive.

Thus, our ('ul)au policy in the
face of the exasperating provo
cations of ( astro involves our
relations with all the progres
sive popular movements iu (his
hemisphere, ( astro knows this
and is exploiting it fully.
The President and his advisors
appear to be fully aware of this,
and the attitude they have taken
is surely the finest and the most
responsible that is possible in the
circumstances. 11 is worthy of full
national support. They have un
derstood that much more is at
stake ihan some property and that
hard words are just hard words.
To convince our l.atiu Ameri
can neighbors of this will be, I
take it, the President's mission
in his coming trip to South
America. We should understand
that this is hy all odds flu- most
difficult trip lie has yet under
taken, and that the risks, the
political risks, are very con
siderable. These risks would
almost surely become prohibi
tive, owing to popular resent
ment in South America, if iu
his Cuban policy the President
had even flirted with the idea
of intervention or economic
coercion.

I press conference on last Tuesday, j
: is an approach to a problem of
I which no one can now know the
] solution. The problem is larger
than Cuba, li is the problem of
j what this country is to do about \
the revolutionary movement in
I Latin America, of which Castro's!
! is a spectacular but by no means ;
the only manifestation.
For what is going on in Cuba
is no mere palace revolution
at the top, in which one oli
garchy lias ousted another. This
is a social revolution involving
the masses of the Cuban peo
ple, and its aim is not to install
a new set of rulers but to work
out a new social order.
Our experiment, which began
with the Mexican revolution some!
forty years ago, has taught us i
that armed intervention or even
! economic coercion by blockade, |
embargo, and economic reprisals, \
| do little good and much harm, j
I They do not protect the legitimate
j American interests which are
jeopardized by the revolution and
they make it very difficult to !
come to reasonable settlements j
when the revolutionary fervor I
subsides, and the time of recoil- j
ri]ation and reconstruction ar- 5
rives.
In his press conference Ihe,
President said that "we are con
cerned, and more than thai, we
are perplexed" about the savage
attacks made upon us by Castro
and his government and the
Cuban press. Pnfortunately Iho
truth, though very unpleasant. I
is noi perplexing. Il is that to at
lack this country is popular, that
ii rallies mass support not only :
in Cuba but in many other conn- |
tries in this hemisphere. If we 1
really face it, we have to realize
that in our relations with Latin
America we have, with notable i
exceptions, identified ourselves!
with ihe support of the past and
as opponents of ihe future. The
chickens are coming home to
roost. To be anti-Yankee is to be
popular and progressive.

Thus, our ('ul)au policy in the
face of the exasperating provo
cations of ( astro involves our
relations with all the progres
sive popular movements iu (his
hemisphere, ( astro knows this
and is exploiting it fully.
The President and his advisors
appear to be fully aware of this,
and the attitude they have taken
is surely the finest and the most
responsible that is possible in the
circumstances. 11 is worthy of full
national support. They have un
derstood that much more is at
stake ihan some property and that
hard words are just hard words.
To convince our l.atiu Ameri
can neighbors of this will be, I
take it, the President's mission
in his coming trip to South
America. We should understand
that this is hy all odds flu- most
difficult trip lie has yet under
taken, and that the risks, the
political risks, are very con
siderable. These risks would
almost surely become prohibi
tive, owing to popular resent
ment in South America, if iu
his Cuban policy the President
had even flirted with the idea
of intervention or economic
coercion.
