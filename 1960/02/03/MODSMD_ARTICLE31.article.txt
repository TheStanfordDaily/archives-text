Berlin Youth Protest
Kilitor, The Daily:
The recent letter telling of the
protest march of the Berlin youth
against the frightening new-Nazi
incidents leaves one with the be
lief that there are West Germans
who are sincerely and utterly op
posed to anti-Semitism.
However, it is romantic non
sense to believe that "the entire
demonstration showed the genu
ine determination of the people of
West Berlin to combat any re
surgence of discrimination." The
German people have never ad
mitted or realized their guilt for
what happened during the time
when the same people who read
Goethe and listened to Beethoven
also could look with indifference
as human values floated into the
gutter of barbarism:
The evil of anti-Semitism still
hangs over the heads of the Ger
man people 1 because il has never
been faced. Various studies, such
as that of the U.S. High Commis
sioner's Office, have discovered
that anti Semi!ism is growing, not
declining.
To believe that the recent neo
Nazi outbreaks are either 'com
munist plots' or the a*.ions of
fanaticals and crackpots to dis
credit Adenauer is absurd, though

ii is in lino with present Arfteri
can policy.
Our absurd and extremely dan
gerous policy of re-arming West
Germany has given Neo-Nazis an
exeelleni opportunity of reestab
lishing themselves in power. Neo-
Nazis and those with Nazi sym
pathies once again command posi
tions of influence in the legal
system, in the military, and in the
schools.
Next to de Gaulle, Adenauer is
a threat to Kuropean peace: as
de Gaulle has Algeria as ihe basis
of his power, Adenauer has Berlin
which he can use as a justification
for Ihe return of German mili
tarism. Below the bubbling pros
perity and appatf ni democratiza
tion of West Germany lies some
thing dark and extremely dan
gerous, merely waiting for ihe
lime to burst forth once again.

Next to de Gaulle, Adenauer is
a threat to Kuropean peace: as
de Gaulle has Algeria as ihe basis
of his power, Adenauer has Berlin
which he can use as a justification
for Ihe return of German mili
tarism. Below the bubbling pros

thing dark and extremely dan

Berlin Youth Protest
Kilitor, The Daily:
The recent letter telling of the
protest march of the Berlin youth
against the frightening new-Nazi
incidents leaves one with the be
lief that there are West Germans
who are sincerely and utterly op
posed to anti-Semitism.
However, it is romantic non
sense to believe that "the entire
demonstration showed the genu
ine determination of the people of
West Berlin to combat any re
surgence of discrimination." The
German people have never ad
mitted or realized their guilt for
what happened during the time
when the same people who read
Goethe and listened to Beethoven
also could look with indifference
as human values floated into the
gutter of barbarism:
The evil of anti-Semitism still
hangs over the heads of the Ger
man people 1 because il has never
been faced. Various studies, such
as that of the U.S. High Commis
sioner's Office, have discovered
that anti Semi!ism is growing, not
declining.
To believe that the recent neo
Nazi outbreaks are either 'com
munist plots' or the a*.ions of
fanaticals and crackpots to dis
credit Adenauer is absurd, though

ii is in lino with present Arfteri
can policy.
Our absurd and extremely dan
gerous policy of re-arming West
Germany has given Neo-Nazis an
exeelleni opportunity of reestab
lishing themselves in power. Neo-
Nazis and those with Nazi sym
pathies once again command posi
tions of influence in the legal
system, in the military, and in the
schools.
Next to de Gaulle, Adenauer is
a threat to Kuropean peace: as
de Gaulle has Algeria as ihe basis
of his power, Adenauer has Berlin
which he can use as a justification
for Ihe return of German mili
tarism. Below the bubbling pros
perity and appatf ni democratiza
tion of West Germany lies some
thing dark and extremely dan
gerous, merely waiting for ihe
