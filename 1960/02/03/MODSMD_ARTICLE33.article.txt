Tilings Become a liil Tough
Now that we have the rest of the country out of the way, Stanford
will sottU 4 down and spend this month and next playing basketball
games with I (J,A, Southern C alifornia and California.
Not that I'm complaining about what at best can be described
as a unique schedule. But if we had any breathers lined up, they're
all behind us.
For instance, USC seems to have its h:\st team in quite a few
seasons; UCLA is not so highly touted, but certainly holding its
own; Cal may very well be headed to another NCAA championship.
Soooo ... it could be a hectic month.
John Arrillaga's play against Oregon State and Oregon was, to
say the least, inspiring. Espe-

cially against OSC. When the
Heavers were pulling away to
what looked like a pretty safe
lead, the hobbled captain came off
the bench and instantly made
things interesting again. Me tried
three shots from the floor all
three were perfect. The last two
of those were especially long
bombs that were '"musts."
But John didn't have enough
support in those waning mo
ments. Perhaps it would be more
accurate, however, to mark that
defeat off to one of the best ex
ecuted and most perfect stalls
ever put on in the Pavilion.
OSC has a bunch of big, strong
basket ball players. Big, strongs
boys are handy when a team is
stalling. The Beavers threw
enough cross-court passes! cardi-'
nal sins for most players to
make a more limid student of the
game cringe. But, in the stall
(which is important to us), every
one of those passes was success
ful. There was no way to stop it

This had to be one of Stanford's poorest efforts of Ihe season.
ArriMaga's dead-eye from far out was sorely missed. Neal Brock
ineyer was too mncli a one-man effort on the backboards. OSC.
worse than us in the scintillating 18-14 (our favor) first half, played
a vei*y good, errorless second half.

In a desire to single out the hi* scoring aces, sports writers j
often overlook some of the mose unspectacular heroes in a basket
ball game. "Unsung" heroes are a dime a dozen, but OSC had one
of the season's most spectacular Friday night.
This guy attracted immediate attention when he made his way!
onto the court late in the first half. It wasn't that he was 6-6; ii
was that ho weighed about 160 pounds and probably was the skin
niest thing that ever got into the Pavilion alive.
If I had to single out any one Beaver who killed the Tribe Friday
night. I'd take this weighty character sophomore Bob Jacohspn.
Me proved more than strong enough to last the last five minutes
of the first half and nearly all of the second half. He went in to
guard the Cards' 6-8 John Windsor, a pretty hot shooter last week
end, who had pumped in three straight field goals in the first half.
Windsor didn't score once after .lacobson came in and what's !
more, got off only two shots. And our skeleton friend scored eight
points, four of them on tight-spot free throws that hit nothing but j
the bottom of the net. Not that I own stock in his fellow, but it
was sort of like he had the last laugh. Or something like that.
iiears Are (#oin<* Overboard
It bothers me the way Cal keeps demolishing everything in its j
path. We have to close the season against the Bears, who most
surely won't be closing theirs, just picking up more and more
steam on the way to all sorts of NCAA playoffs.
Poor old Oregon came down here last week pretty smug about !
its 13-4 record (and two of those losses, to Portland and .Montana
Slate seem rather undistinguished'). The Bears blew the Ducks off
their court; then Stanford completed the sendoff with one of its I
most impressive wins of the season.
Cal blows everything off its court. Washington fell by a cool 40
points. OSC gave the Bears a little trouble and then was trampled
by 1!). Colorado 179-15), Wesl Virginia (65-45). UCLA and a few
others have also been jarred out of their boots by the Bears.
Frankly, it's frightening.
They've been resasonably great in ihe past few years, but now i
it's getting ridiculous.
KO.MANTIC NOTF: While looking for amusement several months
r)go, I ran across a trampled old copy of the Daily Trojan, which in
this case is the campus newspaper at USC.
Thought you might like to know that the All-Amcrican boy is
now engaged. To -Judy Primrose, as in lane, Judy is a physical
education major. Mike (McKeever) is, just as we suspected, major
ing in finance. He chose the right school.
