# Trojans Next Cage Foe
## Daily Sports 
### Russ Allen, Sports Editor 
Stanford eager* who have won live of their last six outings
travel South this weekend to take on the lough USC Trojans Fri
day night and UCLA on Sat urday nighl in Iho Los Angeles Sports
Arena.
Both teams will give the Indians a real test as UCLA is in second
place in the AAWU standings

while SC is in fourth place with
a 3-2 record. The SC Trojans
have the best season record at
13 wins 5 defeats, however.
The Trojans were picked by
many as the team which would
L,ive Cal a run for the money on
the Coast this year and they have
certainly proved it being the
only team to whip the Bears since
Stanford did it midway in '59.
USC' Tough
USC which has its best basket
ball material since 1954 when
they finished fourth in the NCAA
finals stands one and one with
Cal this year and are conceivably
the only team which has a chance
to replace the Bears in the NCAA
play-offs.
John Werhas, a 6-2 forward,
leads ihe Trojans and he has been
compared to Bill Sharman the
ex-Trojan with the Boston Celtics
in style and ability. Werhas was
an All American third baseman
lor I lie Men-of-Troy last year.
Werhas was also an All-Con
ference cage first - stringer last
year as he led the Troymen in
total points scored, with 373, and
was second in field goal percent
age and third in rebounds.
Rudomatkin Sharp
At the other forward spot is
John Rudomatkin, 6-6, picked as
the best junior college player in
California last year and is one
of the Nation's outstanding cage
sophomores. Rudomatkin has de
veloped into one of the Trojan's
top scorers and rebounders this
season.
Jim Hanna, a two year letter
man at 6-7, leads the Trojans at
the center spot. Hanna is seventh
in the Nation in field goal per
centage and looks like he has
finally come into his own as
his previous performances were
certainly spotty.
Right behind Hanna is Big Bill

Engesser who stands a mighty
seven feet tall. Engesser lacked
coordination last year because he
hadn't caught up to his growth
but has been improving every
game Tor SC this season.
At the guard spots we find

Chris Appol and Bill Bloom.
Bloom is another senior with two
years of experience with USC and
is the team playmaker. Appol is
a soph up from the topnoteh
Troybabe squad.
Strong' Bent'li
SC Coach Forresl Twogood also
has some great substitutes to call
on in forwards Steve Kemp, Bill
White, Lang Stanley and guard
Verne Ashby.
While, Kemp and guard Jerry
Pimm are two-year lettermen for
the Trojans but Coach Twogood
rates his sophomores Rudomatkin
and Appel as starters over ihe ex
perienced men. Probably the key
to the Trojan basketball strength
this year lies in their strong and
experienced bench.
