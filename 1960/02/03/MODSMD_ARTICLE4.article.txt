## 
### 
TRIVANDRIJM, India (/P) A
non-Communist alliance led by
Prime Minister Nehru's Congress
party won a smashing victory
Tuesday over the Reds in the
south Indian state of Kerala.
The stale has been run by the
Indian federal government since
last summer when the then rul
ing Communist regime was ousted
by presidential order for failing
to maintain order ant! safety dur
ing rioting.
Nonviolent Resistance
The disorders at the time fol
lowed a Gandhi-style campaign of
nonviolent resistance by anti-
Communists. Kerala was India's
only Red-ruled state.
The alliance took a majority of
65 seats in Kerala's 126-mcmber
legislative Assembly by the time
half the returns from Monday's
special elections had been count
ed.
21 Communist Seats
At this point the Communists,
who controlled the Assembly be
fore they were ousted, had only
21 seats.
, With the results of 92 of the
12(5 scats declared, Congress had
captured 43 seats, the Praja So
cialists 15 and the Moslem League
7.
The results of the remaining
seats are to be announced
Wednesday. It appeared likely the
Congress party alone would gain
enough seats to control the Legis
lature even though they put up
only 81 candidates.
The last time Kerala voted in
1957 the Communists took con
trol of the Legislature by winning
60 seats and backing 5 independ
ents sympathetic to communism.
