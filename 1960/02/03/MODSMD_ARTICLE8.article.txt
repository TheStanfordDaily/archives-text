# SRI Grows In Research
## 
### 
A $4 million increase in volume
of contract research highlighted
the 1959 annual report of opera
tion of the Stanford Research
Institute.
SRI reported a volume of more
than $22 million during the past
year as compared to an $18 mil
lion figure in 1958. About two
thirds of this research was per
formed under government spon
sorship; the remainder was fi
nanced by business, industry,
foundations, and individuals.
Report to Board
In transmitting the report to
the Board of Directors of SRI,
presided over by Stanford's Pres
ident Dr. J. E. Wallace Sterling,
E. Finley Carter, president of the
non-profit research center, dis
cussed the impact of technology
on international developments,
and urged the positive application
of science to world problems.
"The quest for answers . . .
leads to many areas of research,"
Carter stated. "Among them are
world relationships in trade, pro
duction, communications, arms
control, food supplies, disease,
poverty, population, living stand
ards, and human understanding.
There are many more. The oceans,
polar regions, the atmosphere,
and space are involved."
Expansion Underway
Building for the future, SPJ
broke ground last fall for the
second unit in the Institute's
permanent building program.
When completed in 1961, the
150,000 square-foot structure will
house several research groups in
engineering, the physical sciences,
and economics.
The Institute staff at year end
was about 1700, not including con
sultants and temporary employ
ees.
