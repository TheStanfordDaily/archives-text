# TWO PROPOSALS
## School Aid Voted Down By Senate 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — Th e
Senate took its first votes of 15)60
yesterday on aid to education
and quickly rejected two pro
posals.
First to go under were:
• A proposal that $200 million
of the tax money from cigarettes
be set aside for educational pur
poses. A voice vote killed this.
• A proposal that the federal
government supply $2,974,000,00(3
over the next 30 years for new
school buildings. A 71-18 roll-call
vote knocked that out.
Federal Aid
Sen. Norris Cotton (R-N.il. >,
offered the cigarette tax plan, but
said he knew all along it wouldn't
be adopted. It went too far to
suit some and not far enough to
suit others, he said.
Nevertheless, Cotton said some
federal aid for schools is justified.
"It is far more important," he
said, "than many other federal
activities we now have such as,
for instance, price supports for
peanuts."
'Serious Problem'
The second proposal defeated
was offered by Sens. John C.
Cooper (R-Ky.) and Jacob K.
Javits (R-N.Y.). Its 30-year total
of almost $3 billion would have
gone to meet one-half of the in
terest and principal payments on
$1 billion worth of bonds to be
issued by needy school districts.
This plan is much like a pend
ing administration bill, although
more costly.
