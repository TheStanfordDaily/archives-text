# New Post Office To Open Monday
## 
### 
Stanford's long-awaited now Post Office will open for business Monday morning at 9 o'clock,
marking the end of sixty years of faithful service at the little stone building across the street.
Palo Alto Postmaster Ralph Evans announced yesterday that the old building will close its
doors at noon Saturday. Stanford Branch Superintendent John Calahan and his staff will begin to
move the mail and equipment across Lausen Street to the new $200,000 structure.

Calahan said he expected the
moving to be completed sometime
Sunday.
Official dedication ceremonies
will be conducted at the new post
office at 11:30 a.m. next Thurs
day. Among the speakers will be
President Wallace Sterling, Post
master Evans, Post Office Re
gional Operations Director Ver
non Seoggins and a representa

office in Washington.
Boxes Rented
Rental rates are 35 cents a
quarter or 59 cents for the re
mainder of the year.
Boxes may be rented at win
dows one and three today, Friday
and Saturday morning. Students
who have rented boxes and have
not yet received their combina
tions may pick them up at win
downs one and three through Sat
urday and thereafter in the new
building.
"Students receiving mail now
should notify correspondents and
periodical firms immediately of
the change of address," said Cala
han. The Post Office will sort out
mail addressed to boxes in the old
building, seeing that they are put
in the appropriate new boxes un
til the double-address confusion
ends.
o;>eii 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Since all boxes open to the out
side of the building, the Post Of
lobby will be open only during
business hours, 9 to 5 weekdays
and 9 to noon Saturdays. All
transactions will be handled at
the main counter. There will be
no changes in pick-up or delivery
schedules at this time, Calahan
confirmed.
The building was financed by
the University and built to gov
ernment specifications by How
ard White Construction Co. along
â€¢with the new book store. The
budget for the Post Office was
$222,000, according to assistant
business manager S. F. Post.
Some interior work and landscap
ing remains to be done, Post said.
Construction began in March
1959 with the beginning of winter
quarter the planned opening date.
The five week delay was caused
by an error in laying the concrete
foundation for the boxes. The
first foundations had to be torn
out and replaced by wider con
crete bases.
'Only One of Kind'
Assistant Palo Alto Postmaster
Lloyd Reise said the mission style
architecture co m bine d with
arches and outside boxes make
Stanford's new Post Office "the
only one of its kind in the na
tion." Reise said the otuside boxes
were the very latest in Post Of
fice design.
The Stanford Post Office is a
branch of the main Post Office in
Palo Alto which leases the build
ing from Ihe University.
