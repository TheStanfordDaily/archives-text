## Panel Says Swastikas Not Direct Neo-Nazism Result 
### Dave Quarles Associate Editor 
Swastikas in Germany are a re
flection but not a direct result of
neo-Nazism a four-member panel
concluded last night in Cubberley
Auditorium.
The outbreak of neo-Nazism
and its anti-Semitic manifesta
tions was discussed by Adalbert
Korff, Dr. Carl Schorske, Dr.
Kurt Steiner and Christa von
Plot tenberg.
Miss von Plettenberg, an ASSU
scholar from Berlin, blamed the
swastika painting on "irrational
rowdyism," but traced its real
source to an unsolved guilt com
plex on the part of the German
public.
"The Bonn government under
standably has offered numerous
excuses for the outbreaks to save
the sacred reputation of the 'eco
nomic miracle'," she said. "But it

has failed to confront the adult
public with Ihe immediate past."
She quoted West Berlin Mayor
Willy Brandt as saying too many
German people live between yes
terday and tomorrow with no
clear idea of either.
Ignorance of Present
Korff, a graduate student from
the University of Lausanne,
agreed with Miss von Plettenberg
that the swastikas indicate not
only a warped sense of the past
but an ignorance of the present,
lie emphasized that a great many
Germans look upon democracy as
a gift without obligation. How
ever, ho felt that the outbreaks in
Germany are not nationally or
ganized.
Steiner, of the Political Science
Department, pointed out Ameri
can guilt in the German incidents.
"Although there is a tendency for
some Germans to forgive ex-
Nazis in government posts, our
own newspapers have failed to
concern themselves with ex-Nazis
in high positions from Bonn to
city governments."
Steiner said many Germans
have protested the ex-Nazis of
ficials, but that Americans have
been disinterested because they
tend to look at Germans as a
homogeneous group.
Referring to ex-Nazis in gov
ernmental positions, Steiner do
scribed the Bonn government as
morally tainted, and as such a
difficult thing for many young
people to identify themselves
with completely.
Not Direct Relation
Schorske, a follow at the In
stitute for Advanced Behavioral
Research, believed that the swas
tika painting in Germany is not
directly related to the real danger,
a revived pan-European Nazism.
The swastikas, according to
Schorske, in part reflect German
youth's reaction to a perspective
less world in which capitalistic
democracy, capitalistic totalitar
ianism. and communistic totali
tarianism are playing a game of
musical chairs.
"Although the neo-Nazis have
crawled out of tlie woodwork,"
he said, "as yet they have no real
mass basis. But if we have a de
pression and the pursuit of the
dollar or dcutsche mark becomes
impossible, then the ex-Nazis will
be a real danger."
