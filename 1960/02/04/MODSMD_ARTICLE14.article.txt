# Kepler Defines Pacifist Ideals

### Anne Cowen 
"Current concepts of peace are
abstract, static, and impractical,"
Roy Kepler, owner of Kepler's
Book Store, told the YWCA Re
ligious Affairs luncheon group
yesterday.
"There is no such thing as
peace, because peace is not a
thing. There is no 'way to peace,'
because peace is a way. Peace is
a process that begins here and
now with what we do today about
the problems we confront," Kep
ler said.
Kepler, a pacifist who was a
conscientious objector during
World War II and has been na
tional secretary to the War Re
sistors' League, spoke on "The
Case for Non-Violence."
"Peace depends upon the adop
tion of non-violent ways of grap
pling with problems. We can no
longer defend our way of life
with war."
Kepler said the elements of the
non-violent approach are love and
concern for others, resistance
that refuses to adopt the methods
of the system it opposes, and so
cial organization and awareness.
"There is no assurance of suc
cess in non-violence. You must bo
willing to risk suffering yourself
rather than inflict it upon
others," Kepler stated.
Citing the practical aspects of
non-violent resistance, Kepler
stressed the need for social organ
ization of the kind that promoted
the success of Gandhi's move
ment to free India and the Mont
gomery, Ala., bus boycott.
