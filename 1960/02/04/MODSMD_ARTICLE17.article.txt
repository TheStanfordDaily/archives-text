On August 10, 1915, Ihe Japa
nese Imperial Army surrendered,
thus bringing World War II to a
close. The Japanese leaders who
signed ihe treaty were probably
haunted by the anguished cries of
millions of their countrymen who
suffered the unbelievable torture
of an atomic attack.
We were too young to under
stand. The word "war" had no
significance. We were safe in our
parents' arms, far removed from
the poisonous mushroom.
Isnt today's Japanese college
student does understand. He
wasn't safe in his parents'
arms. He was lucky if lus par
ents were alive. The poisonous
mushroom was rearing its ugly
head right on his doorstep.
The Japanese collego student
of today probably remembers
people being burned alive or be
ing blown to pieces. Maybe ho
saw his parents suffer in angoniz
ing, tortuous death. And if ho
doesn't remember, all he lias to
do is to look around him and
notice tho many deformed people
who managed 1o live but did not
emerge unscathed from Ihe af
fects of radiation.
With so many memories about
the vicissitudes*of war, it is not
surprising that the Japanese stu
dent is obsessed with the hope of
everlasting peace. It is not sur
prising that the student news
paper of Keio University in Tokyo
devotes an entire page to the
discussion of peace.
The newspaper called upon
students <o define peace. The
definitions were basically the
same. "Peace is a state in which
we have no war and we all can
live together happily." "Peace
is when we have no war, not
even a conflict such as the 'cold
war,' for that isn't peace."
"It is the time when we have
no fighting and when it is
quiet."

I Tho editors point oul ihat these
| definitions are probably tho
same that American students
i might give except there is an
I essential difference: ihe Japanese
| student thinks of peace as mean
! ing a world free of conflict. Most
American students think of today
as a time of peace, even with the
| "cold war." Japanese students
| don't.
The editors fear that different
connotations surrounding such a
i significant word as "peace" might
load to conflict.
No ambiguity exists for the
Japanese student when it comes
to the meaning and significance
! of peace. He will not leave any
I margin tor error.
A hope for everlasting peace is
ian obsession with ihe Japanese
student and with tire generation
before him too. Part of their con
stitution says: "We, the Japanese
people, desire peace for all time
and are deeply conscious of ihe
high ideals controlling human re
lationship, and we have deter
mined to preserve our security
| and existence, trusting in the
[justice and faith of ihe peace
j loving peoples of Ihe world.
"Aspiring sincerely to an inter
national peace based on justice
and order, the Japanese people
; forever renounce war as a sov
ereign right of the nation and the
; threat or use of force as means
I of settling international disputes.
"In order to accomplish tin 1
aim of the preceding paragraph,
land, sea and air forces, as well
as other war potentials, will
never he maintained. The right
of belligerency of the state will
not he recognized."
The Japanese students of
Keio University, and other stu
dents like them want peace at
any cost, as do almost all of the
Japanese. They remember the
last days of World War 11. We
don't.

On August 10, 1915, Ihe Japa

thus bringing World War II to a

signed ihe treaty were probably
haunted by the anguished cries of
millions of their countrymen who
suffered the unbelievable torture
of an atomic attack.
We were too young to under

significance. We were safe in our

the poisonous mushroom.

student does understand. He
wasn't safe in his parents'
arms. He was lucky if lus par

mushroom was rearing its ugly
head right on his doorstep.
The Japanese collego student
of today probably remembers
people being burned alive or be

saw his parents suffer in angoniz
ing, tortuous death. And if ho
doesn't remember, all he lias to
do is to look around him and

who managed 1o live but did not
emerge unscathed from Ihe af

With so many memories about
the vicissitudes*of war, it is not
surprising that the Japanese stu
dent is obsessed with the hope of
everlasting peace. It is not sur
prising that the student news
paper of Keio University in Tokyo
devotes an entire page to the
discussion of peace.
The newspaper called upon
students <o define peace. The
definitions were basically the
same. "Peace is a state in which
we have no war and we all can
live together happily." "Peace
is when we have no war, not
even a conflict such as the 'cold
war,' for that isn't peace."
"It is the time when we have
no fighting and when it is
quiet."

I Tho editors point oul ihat these

as a time of peace, even with the
