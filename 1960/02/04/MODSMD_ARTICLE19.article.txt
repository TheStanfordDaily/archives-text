NDEA
Editor, The Daily:
Tho NDEA is intended for
exactly what ils title implies
j ihe defense of this country.. It
does not sanction general inter
vention by the federal govern
ment in tho field of education.
By what twisted logic did you
decide that Ihe willingness of tho
government to aid students in cer
tain fields (provided certain con
ditions are met) as a possible
! contribution to Ihe defense of this
; nation actually means that the
I government is dictating "what to
I believe" to all students?
The United States government
I took 20 per cenl of my income
last year, money which I badly
| need to finance my own educa
tion. If tho government should
loan this money to every Tom.
i Dick, and Harry without some
security measure to protect its
! investment in defense (which
| ultimately is for my benefit and
I yours), the government would bo
i acting in an utterly irresponsible
! manner.
Signing the oath and tho affi
davit would seem to bo a small
price to pay compared to one that
would bo exacted from us all if
communism should triumph.
The use of the disclaimer affi
davit is a calm and judicious use
of government power in response
I to a specific obligation. It is not
: a resurgence of "McCarthyism."
