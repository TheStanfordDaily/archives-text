Fditor, The Daily:
Recently the Stanford Publica-.j
tions Board <PB) has denied the
Inter Club Council (ICC) adver
tising privileges to finance its!
Rushing Manual this year. Rea- 1
sons given for the denial were as
follows:
1. Daily, Quad and Chappie can
not afford to lose advertising rev- j
enue to any source; 2. Three other '
applications for advertising rights
have already been denied this;
year; ahd 3. Fraternities don't 1
need advertising for their Man
ual, why should Clubs? In this
rationale, however, a number of
considerations have been neglect
ed.
1. Precedence. The ICC Manual :
has been published each year
with costs covered by advertising
for seven years. Knowing the fi
nancial plights of the ASSU Pub
lications las far back as last
Spring Quarter) and knowing
that ICC would be requesting ad
vertising privileges this year as
before, the PB should have noti
fied the ICC of possible denial of
advertising privileges no later
than last quarter. This was NOT
clone. The ICC cannot be held
financially responsible for an
error in PB policy execution.
2. The ICC Rushing Manual is
not a one shot publication. It is
a yearly function financed by 1
Club members' social dues as
well as advertising.
The Fraternity Manual doesn't
need advertising, true. But let us
not forget that there are over
1000 Fraternity men paying for!
the Fraternity Manual and only I
350 Club men whose social dues
are already on a per capita par j
with Fraternity social dues. It
would be unfair to raise Club j
dues any higher to cover costs

previously covered by advertis
ing.
3. To slate that by eliminating
the ICC Rushing Manual adver
tising that the ASSU publications
may eliminate their deficits or
reduce their losses for the year
is of doubtful logic. We have seen
no proof before LASSU that ad
vertising revenues "have decreased
for the three publications.
Besides, more things than rev
enue determine a profit or loss
rising costs of production, higher
overhead, non-recurring charges,
greater administrative costs, and
uncollected debts.
There is also no evidence which
indicates that a loss in advertising
revenue, if such exists, may not
be due to a reduction in ''real

product" guaranteed to adver
tisers by Stanford's Publications
in relation to other area news
papers, printed sports event pro
grams, FM and TV broadcasts,
and various other gimicks.
Therefore, the PR position is
wobbly. PB has made a decision
on emotion rather than careful
analysis. ICC will cooperate if
complete analysis shows that our
solicitations detract from the
1 > üblications' revenue.
By stalling now we could cer
tainly try to find new ways of
financing our Manual next year.
This year we must have adver
tising revenue.

2. The ICC Rushing Manual is
not a one shot publication. It is
a yearly function financed by 1
Club members' social dues as
well as advertising.
The Fraternity Manual doesn't
need advertising, true. But let us
not forget that there are over
1000 Fraternity men paying for!
the Fraternity Manual and only I
350 Club men whose social dues
are already on a per capita par j
with Fraternity social dues. It
would be unfair to raise Club j
dues any higher to cover costs

previously covered by advertis
ing.
3. To slate that by eliminating
the ICC Rushing Manual adver
tising that the ASSU publications
may eliminate their deficits or
reduce their losses for the year
is of doubtful logic. We have seen
no proof before LASSU that ad
vertising revenues "have decreased
for the three publications.
Besides, more things than rev
enue determine a profit or loss
rising costs of production, higher
overhead, non-recurring charges,
greater administrative costs, and
uncollected debts.
There is also no evidence which
indicates that a loss in advertising
revenue, if such exists, may not
be due to a reduction in ''real

product" guaranteed to adver
tisers by Stanford's Publications
in relation to other area news
papers, printed sports event pro
grams, FM and TV broadcasts,
and various other gimicks.
Therefore, the PR position is
wobbly. PB has made a decision
on emotion rather than careful
analysis. ICC will cooperate if
complete analysis shows that our
solicitations detract from the
1 > üblications' revenue.
By stalling now we could cer
tainly try to find new ways of
financing our Manual next year.
This year we must have adver
tising revenue.

Recently the Stanford Publica-.j
tions Board <PB) has denied the
Inter Club Council (ICC) adver
tising privileges to finance its!
Rushing Manual this year. Rea- 1
sons given for the denial were as
follows:
1. Daily, Quad and Chappie can
not afford to lose advertising rev- j
enue to any source; 2. Three other '
applications for advertising rights
have already been denied this;
year; ahd 3. Fraternities don't 1
need advertising for their Man
ual, why should Clubs? In this
rationale, however, a number of
considerations have been neglect
ed.
1. Precedence. The ICC Manual :
has been published each year
with costs covered by advertising
for seven years. Knowing the fi
nancial plights of the ASSU Pub
lications las far back as last
Spring Quarter) and knowing
that ICC would be requesting ad
vertising privileges this year as
before, the PB should have noti
fied the ICC of possible denial of
advertising privileges no later
than last quarter. This was NOT
clone. The ICC cannot be held
financially responsible for an
error in PB policy execution.
