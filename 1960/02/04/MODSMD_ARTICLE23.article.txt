## The 						Trouble in Oklahoma

"Oklahomans," Will KoÂ«ers used to say, "will vote for prohibition
as long as they can stagger to the polls."
No doubt that rope-spinning philosopher would have been as
surprised as anyone last year when the good citizens ol" the Pan
handle State staggered up and voted to make their alcohol con
sumption legal. No sooner, however, did Oklahoma rid itself of
this problem, than another one, perhaps even more crucial, appeared.
But to begin at the beginning.
You are well aware, no doubt, that up until recently the Uni
versity of Oklahoma always seemed, to possess the finest football
team in the country.
They had a winning streak of maybe eight or nine hundred games
in a row and, even though that

streak came crashing to an end
one fine Saturday, against a leam
from a school out of South Bend,
Ind., they have remained cham
pions of their conference.
At any rate the National Col
legiate Athletic Association at its
annual get-together early this
year decided that enough penal
ties for illegal recruiting and
overpaying athletes had been
awarded to the University of
Southern California and they
looked around for another target.
They found it in Oklahoma.
The specific charge had to do
with what is popularly referred
to as a slush fund which in this
case was said to be under the
sponsorship of a Sooner partisan
from Oklahoma City; one Arthur
L. Wood.
The penalties handed down by
the NCAA were among the
stiffest in memory. Indefinite
probation, a ban from post-sea
son bowl games and no televising
of any Oklahoma games.
