# Many Actors on the Stage

Hud Wilkinson, head Oklahoma coach, said that lie was "not
surprised, this is nothing new." The web of involvement has
spread all over the place with Bill -It'iinings, the University of Ne
braska's head coach, and Pete Elliott, late of Golden Bear Land and
now head coach at the University of Illinois, getting into the act.
Both Jennings and Elliott were assistants under Wilkinson at
Oklahoma and both were in charge of recruiting. Elliott, it seems,
wants to help his former employers with sworn statements and the
like, while Jennings motives seem less pure from Oklahoma's point
of view.
Just this Monday, the governor of the state got into the
act saying, after a talk with Wilkinson, that there doesn't seem to
be much that can be done to help the university get back into the
NCAA's good graces.
Bud agreed saying, "There have not been any developments and
I don't think there can be."
With a hope that perhaps a little more light could be shed
on the affair, contact was made with the local representative of ihe
Wilkinson family; Bud's oldest son, l'at.

boots.
