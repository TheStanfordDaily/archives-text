# 'I Get Hurt'
## 
### 
As might ho expected, Pat has played a lit 110 football himself.
Those days are probably over for him, however, since he seems
possessed of a jinx. To put it in his own words, "Every time I go
out I get hurt."
He played three sports in high school and went out for frosh
ball last year only to hurt his knee and spend tho season on the side
lines. He was all set to go in spring practice last -season, but the
day before uniforms were issued he injured the same knee.
Pat has had a couple of operations since then but will not play
football anymore.
Getting around to Oklahoma's present troubles, Pat couldn't
help much. "The thing that made us a little angry," he said, "was
that when dad and President Cross (George Cross, University of
Oklahoma president) found out what was going on they turned
themselves in. The NCAA didn't take that into account at all."
He said that a few of Oklahoma's more red-hot alumni are putting
the pressure on Wood to open his books. Wood doesn't seem par
ticularly anxious to do this.
Nobody knows what's coming next, but in the meantime Okla
homa's football ship sits in irons.
