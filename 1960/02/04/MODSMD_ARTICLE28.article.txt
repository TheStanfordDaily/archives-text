# Indians Clash With Bruins In Los Angeles Saturday
## 
### ken Dery 
The UCLA Bruins host our
Stanford Indians Saturday night
in a basketball game that could
very well go right down to the
final buzzer. Both teams possess
identical 9-8 won-loss records and
both lost to powerful California
by about the same score.
Despite the loss of graduated
all-coast guard Walt Torrence
and thre other starters, coach
John Wooden has built a solid
team that upset strong USC two
i weeks ago.
Pleasant Surprise
The most pleasant surprise in
the UCLA story this season has
been the tremendous development
of junior transfer John Berberieh
at center. Originally slated as a
second-stringer behind returning
letlerman Warnell Jones, the 6'B"
Berberieh is leading the team
both in scoring and rebounding.
Hitting at a 10.5 clip he meshed
29 points last weekend as the
Bruins split two games.
Perhaps the key to the outcome
! of the game is the sprained ankle
of Kent Miller. Now that Stan-
I ford captain John Arrillaga has
two healthy ankles to stand on,
jthe pressure is on UCLA. Miller
showed great promise last year

as a sophomore and was averag
ing better than ten points per
game at forward this season
when he sufferd ihe injury in
practice.
Starters a Question
Because of the heavy losses to
graduation and the relative in
experience of the squad, there is
always some question as to who
will start.
The guards will be either Bill
Hicks. Bill Ellis or John Green.
Green averaged twenty for the
frosh last year while Ellis is the
Bruin's third high scorer to date.
At the forward positions Pete

Blaekman and Gary Cunningham
will probably gel the call. Both
are adequate frontliners though
•short on experience.
