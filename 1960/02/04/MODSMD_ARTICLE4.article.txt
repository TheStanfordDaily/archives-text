## 
### 
JERUSALEM (l\>) â€” Isr a o ]
charged that Syrian gunners
poured new fire last night on an
Israeli settlement in a demili
tarized zone southeast of the Sea
of Galilee.
An Israeli army spokesman

said a Israeli guardsman was
wounded.
He said fire from automatic
weapons and mortars hit the Beit
Katzir settlement but that fire
was not returned from the Israeli
side.
Planned Aggression
The Israeli spokesman made
his report from Tel Aviv shortly
after an Israeli spokesman there
had reported that new firing
broke out earlier along the tense,
raindrenched Israol-S yri a n
border.
At U.N. headquarters in New
York, the United Arab Republic
last night accused Israel of plan
ned aggression. It charged Israeli
troops facing Syria are being con
tinuously reinforced in a move to
occupy their common border de
militarized zone.
Report Denied
The earlier report from Tel
Aviv claimed Syrians opposite the
southeastern shore of the Sea of
Galilee fired machine gun bursts
and rifle shots into Israeli terri
tory. The spokesman said the fire
was not returned.
There was no immediate confir
mation from the U.N. or other
sources.
The spokesman denied an ear
lier Damascus report that Syrian
soldiers had fired on an Israeli
patrol and Israeli machine-gun
ners fired back during the day.
'Decisive Test'
Israeli Prime Minister David
Ben-Gurion, speaking before a la
bor convention in Tel Aviv, made
no direct reference to the border
trouble but he said: "During the
next decade we are liable to face
a grave and perhaps decisive mili
tary test."
Israel meanwhile denied there
are any Israeli forces in the de
militarized zone where the U.N.
asked both sides to withdraw.
No Interest
Col. Raymond Pit-lot. Belgian
chairman of the Israeli - Syrian
Mixed Armistice Commission,
called on both sides Tuesday to
withdraw all armed forces, armed
civilians, and weapons from the
disputed zone.
Neithei showed any desire to be
first to respond.
In Egypt, Syria's partner in Ihe
U.A.R., radio Cairo broadcast a
statement that Syria i-s ready to
discuss the problem of the dis
puted zone within the Mixed Ar
mistice Commission.
The Israelis showed no interest
in such a debate.
