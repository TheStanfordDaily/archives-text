President Wallace Sterling ex
plained to his freshman audience
in a talk at Wilbur Hall last night
that he would like to see the dis
claimer affidavit of the National
Defense Education Act repealed
by Congress.
"Any protest Stanford will
make against the affidavit will be
based solely on the principle in
volved." lie labeled the affidavit
as "un-American," "discriminat
ing" and "unnecessary," and said
these were his greatest objec
tions.
Violates Principles
The affidavit is un-American
because it violates the principles
on which the United States was
built. It is discriminating because
it singles out students as a par
ticular group subject to special
regulation. "A farmer does not
have to sign an oath to receive
aid from the government," he
pointed out. It is unnecessary be
cause the oath of allegiance is
sufficient indication of a student's
loyalty. "We have a positive oath;
why do we require a negative
oath? .
('ooperation
"Stanford is working with the
federal government on the aid
program, because if she did not,
she would be depriving a student
of an education here because of
an opinion Stanford held." Ster
ling remarked. "The student him
self might not have any objec
tions.
"The affidavit may prove to be
an unfortunate precedent," he
concluded.
Sterling was presented by
Cedro House as a speaker in
Cedro's Fireside Lecture series.
He was asked to speak on the af
fidavit by Scotty Thompson, AS
SU representative from Wilbur
Hall, and primary figure back
of the move by LASSU to go on
record against the affidavit.
