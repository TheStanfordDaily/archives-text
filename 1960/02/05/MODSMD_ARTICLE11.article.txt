## De Gaulle and Algeria 
### Dick White Contributing Editor 
Franco's perennial colonial
problem since the conclusion of
the Indochinese war has been
Algeria. Billions of dollars have
been spent fighting the rebels in
a seemingly endless war.
Every effort to peacefully settle
the problem has brought outcries
from one side or the other. The
colonnes Frenchmen outnum
bered nine to one by Berbers
and Moslems, feel that only
through continued rule by France
will their interests be insured.
Attempts at a plebiscite
haw been violently rejected by
the colonnes who fear that
their electoral minority would
be trounced at the polls.
The policy of the Fourth Re
public, considered too lax by the
settlers, finally resulted in the
riots and demonstrations of 1958
which led to the establishment
of the Fifth Republic.
De Gaulle, as president of the
Republic with the greatly in
creased executive powers pro
vided by the new Constitution,
thought that the solution to the
Algerian question was not to be
found in weapons. On Sept. 1(>,
1959, he announced that before
the end of 1960, elections would
be held iti Algeria to determine
its future status with regards
to France.
The settlers and ultranational
ists were horrified. De Gaulle,
whom they had established in
power, had betrayed them.
Georges Bidault, 112 or in e r
Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister, bitterly denounced
the President and toured Al
geria in December speaking as
the head of the Rally of French
Algeria. In January Bidault ap
plied once again to lecture in
Algeria, but his request, was
denied.
Tire government further antag
onized the settlers by dismissing
Army General Massu. Massu in
a newspaper interview had threat
ened the government of France
with violent disobedience if it
carried out the Algerian program.
The colonnes, perhaps in
panic or perhaps in despair, be
gan a general strike and de
monstrations on Jan. 22.
Rioting citizens tore up cobbled
streets to build barricades in the
cities. They had hoped for Army
support or at least neutrality, and
indeed the paratroops made no
efforts to attack the fortified
barricades.
The government in Paris was
adamant. No compromises were

offered to the rebels, A par
linientary coalition of Guallists,
the Union of Democratic Forces
(pro-Mendes-France), and Com
munists solidly supported the
government's stand in opposing
the settlers.
The rebels in Algiers re
sponded with cries of "De
Gaulle to the Gallows," but
their cause was lost. The army,
up to this time neutral, shifted
its support to the government,
and although not attacking
rebel positions, lent them no en
couragement.
De Gaulle on Jan. 31 recalled
ihe paratroops from Algiers and
sent in "the Foreign Legion, com
posed primarily of Germans. The
rebels realized that whereas the
paratroops were sympathetic to
their cause, they could expect no
leniency from the Forcgin Legion.
Defeat was emminent, and
therefore they quickly surren
dered rather than face death.
Their leader Pierre Laguillarde,
29-year-old deputy to the Na
tional Assembly, was arrested
and taken to Paris to stand
trial.
However, the story does not
end here. De Gaulle, seeing in this
revolt an opportunity to further
his ends by decreasing the powers
of the National Assembly, called
on them to grant him emergency
authority to rule France by de
cree for one year.
These would be used, Prime
Minister Debre assured the As
sembly, only for the maintain
ance of internal peace and se
curity and the. prevention of
further Rightist revolts. The
government, however, would
not accept an amendment to ex
clude civil rights and labor
from control by the President.
The Assembly, more afraid of
further riots than of a loss of
freedom, granted De Gaulle these
powers.
I)e Gaulle lias thus turned
fortune to his advantage. The
revolt which threatened to top
ple his regime and his Repub
lic lias only served to strength
en iiis control over the govern
mental process. The Constitu
tion of the Fifth Republic
greatly limited the powers en
poyed by the Assembly under
the previous regime.
Not content with this, De
Gaulle now aims at still greater
control over France. Democracy
suffered a serious blow in France
in 1958 due to the rebels of Al
giers, and now Ihe reaction to
the rebels has still further weak
ened the democratic institutions
of France.

lic lias only served to strength
en iiis control over the govern
mental process. The Constitu
tion of the Fifth Republic
greatly limited the powers en
poyed by the Assembly under
the previous regime.
Not content with this, De
Gaulle now aims at still greater
control over France. Democracy
suffered a serious blow in France
in 1958 due to the rebels of Al
giers, and now Ihe reaction to
the rebels has still further weak
ened the democratic institutions
of France.
Franco's perennial colonial
problem since the conclusion of
the Indochinese war has been
Algeria. Billions of dollars have
been spent fighting the rebels in
a seemingly endless war.
Every effort to peacefully settle
the problem has brought outcries
from one side or the other. The
colonnes Frenchmen outnum
bered nine to one by Berbers
and Moslems, feel that only
through continued rule by France
will their interests be insured.
Attempts at a plebiscite
haw been violently rejected by
the colonnes who fear that
their electoral minority would
be trounced at the polls.
The policy of the Fourth Re
public, considered too lax by the
settlers, finally resulted in the
riots and demonstrations of 1958
which led to the establishment
of the Fifth Republic.
De Gaulle, as president of the
Republic with the greatly in
creased executive powers pro
vided by the new Constitution,
thought that the solution to the
Algerian question was not to be
found in weapons. On Sept. 1(>,
1959, he announced that before
the end of 1960, elections would
be held iti Algeria to determine
its future status with regards
to France.
The settlers and ultranational
ists were horrified. De Gaulle,
whom they had established in
power, had betrayed them.
Georges Bidault, 112 or in e r
Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister, bitterly denounced
the President and toured Al
geria in December speaking as
the head of the Rally of French
Algeria. In January Bidault ap
plied once again to lecture in
Algeria, but his request, was
denied.
Tire government further antag
onized the settlers by dismissing
Army General Massu. Massu in
a newspaper interview had threat
ened the government of France
with violent disobedience if it
carried out the Algerian program.
The colonnes, perhaps in
panic or perhaps in despair, be
gan a general strike and de
monstrations on Jan. 22.
Rioting citizens tore up cobbled
streets to build barricades in the
cities. They had hoped for Army
support or at least neutrality, and
indeed the paratroops made no
efforts to attack the fortified
barricades.
The government in Paris was
adamant. No compromises were

offered to the rebels, A par
linientary coalition of Guallists,
the Union of Democratic Forces
(pro-Mendes-France), and Com
munists solidly supported the
government's stand in opposing
the settlers.
The rebels in Algiers re
sponded with cries of "De
Gaulle to the Gallows," but
their cause was lost. The army,
up to this time neutral, shifted
its support to the government,
and although not attacking
rebel positions, lent them no en
couragement.
De Gaulle on Jan. 31 recalled
ihe paratroops from Algiers and
sent in "the Foreign Legion, com
posed primarily of Germans. The
rebels realized that whereas the
paratroops were sympathetic to
their cause, they could expect no
leniency from the Forcgin Legion.
Defeat was emminent, and
therefore they quickly surren
dered rather than face death.
Their leader Pierre Laguillarde,
29-year-old deputy to the Na
tional Assembly, was arrested
and taken to Paris to stand
trial.
However, the story does not
end here. De Gaulle, seeing in this
revolt an opportunity to further
his ends by decreasing the powers
of the National Assembly, called
on them to grant him emergency
authority to rule France by de
cree for one year.
These would be used, Prime
Minister Debre assured the As
sembly, only for the maintain
ance of internal peace and se
curity and the. prevention of
further Rightist revolts. The
government, however, would
not accept an amendment to ex
clude civil rights and labor
from control by the President.
The Assembly, more afraid of
further riots than of a loss of
freedom, granted De Gaulle these
powers.

sembly, only for the maintain
ance of internal peace and se
curity and the. prevention of
further Rightist revolts. The
government, however, would
not accept an amendment to ex
clude civil rights and labor
from control by the President.
The Assembly, more afraid of
further riots than of a loss of
freedom, granted De Gaulle these
powers.
I)e Gaulle lias thus turned
fortune to his advantage. The
revolt which threatened to top
ple his regime and his Repub
lic lias only served to strength
en iiis control over the govern
mental process. The Constitu
tion of the Fifth Republic
greatly limited the powers en
poyed by the Assembly under
the previous regime.
Not content with this, De
Gaulle now aims at still greater
control over France. Democracy
suffered a serious blow in France
in 1958 due to the rebels of Al
giers, and now Ihe reaction to
the rebels has still further weak
ened the democratic institutions
of France.
Franco's perennial colonial
problem since the conclusion of
the Indochinese war has been
Algeria. Billions of dollars have
been spent fighting the rebels in
a seemingly endless war.
Every effort to peacefully settle
the problem has brought outcries
from one side or the other. The
colonnes Frenchmen outnum
bered nine to one by Berbers
and Moslems, feel that only
through continued rule by France
will their interests be insured.
Attempts at a plebiscite
haw been violently rejected by
the colonnes who fear that
their electoral minority would
be trounced at the polls.
The policy of the Fourth Re
public, considered too lax by the
settlers, finally resulted in the
riots and demonstrations of 1958
which led to the establishment
of the Fifth Republic.
De Gaulle, as president of the
Republic with the greatly in
creased executive powers pro
vided by the new Constitution,
thought that the solution to the
Algerian question was not to be
found in weapons. On Sept. 1(>,
1959, he announced that before
the end of 1960, elections would
be held iti Algeria to determine
its future status with regards
to France.
The settlers and ultranational
ists were horrified. De Gaulle,
whom they had established in
power, had betrayed them.
Georges Bidault, 112 or in e r
Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister, bitterly denounced
the President and toured Al
geria in December speaking as
the head of the Rally of French
Algeria. In January Bidault ap
plied once again to lecture in
Algeria, but his request, was
denied.
Tire government further antag
onized the settlers by dismissing
Army General Massu. Massu in
a newspaper interview had threat
ened the government of France
with violent disobedience if it
carried out the Algerian program.
The colonnes, perhaps in
panic or perhaps in despair, be
gan a general strike and de
monstrations on Jan. 22.
Rioting citizens tore up cobbled
streets to build barricades in the
cities. They had hoped for Army
support or at least neutrality, and
indeed the paratroops made no
efforts to attack the fortified
barricades.
The government in Paris was
adamant. No compromises were

offered to the rebels, A par
linientary coalition of Guallists,
the Union of Democratic Forces
(pro-Mendes-France), and Com
munists solidly supported the
government's stand in opposing
the settlers.
The rebels in Algiers re
sponded with cries of "De
Gaulle to the Gallows," but
their cause was lost. The army,
up to this time neutral, shifted
its support to the government,
and although not attacking
rebel positions, lent them no en
couragement.
De Gaulle on Jan. 31 recalled
ihe paratroops from Algiers and
sent in "the Foreign Legion, com
posed primarily of Germans. The
rebels realized that whereas the
paratroops were sympathetic to
their cause, they could expect no
leniency from the Forcgin Legion.
Defeat was emminent, and
therefore they quickly surren
dered rather than face death.
Their leader Pierre Laguillarde,
29-year-old deputy to the Na
tional Assembly, was arrested
and taken to Paris to stand
trial.
However, the story does not
end here. De Gaulle, seeing in this
revolt an opportunity to further
his ends by decreasing the powers
of the National Assembly, called
on them to grant him emergency
authority to rule France by de
cree for one year.
