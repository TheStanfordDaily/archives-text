# 'SUDDENLY, LAST SUMMER'
## Film Version of Play Gives Human Emphasis 
### 
The movie version of Tennessee
Williams' "Suddenly, Last Sum
mer," which is currently playing
in Menlo Park, -shows a great im
provement over the play.
A number of people may well
remember the Actor's Workshop
production of the play which was
given at Stanford a year ago last
fall. The play was nothing but an
hour of subjective vehemence and
morbidity.
However, the movie gives the
audience a chance to see the main
characters as human beings rath
er than as mere traumatic or
psychological entities. Amplified
by a more intelligible interpreta
tion, Ihe movie follows the origi
nal story line of the play.
A fanatically doting mother
tries to prove that the young
woman who witnessed the inci
dent of her son's death and who
implied slander about him is in
sane.
The action centers on the girl's
treatment as a menial patient
and on the mother's at tempi to
bribe ihe girl's family and a doc
tor into consenting to a lobotomy,
which would silence the girl.
The girls finally tells a fantas
tic story of the young man being
eaten alive by a hoard of ravenous
children. This story was report
erly an obsession wilh Williams.
In ihe play he tries to tell us
Ihat this incident symbolizes a
world order of "man eats man."
But it obviously was some sort of
private wish fulfillment, and his
psychiatrist advised him to write
about it for therapeutic reasons.
The movie is perhaps a mark
of Williams' progress in psycho
analysis, which should be no

small relief to his audiences.
Due to rewriting and ihe direc
tion of Joseph Mankiewicz, the
film manages to go beyond a mere
statement of this bizarre obses
sion by clearly and carefully em
phasizing the need for a more
humane treatment of the men
tally ill.
It begins by showing the insane
iii a mass ward and then gradually
focuses on the yonug woman
who could potentially end her life
there.
When the doctor tries to cure
her by treating hoi' as a human
being instead of enclosing her in
a mass ward, the director of the
hospital exclaims "Bui that's un
orthodox." To which the doctor
replies, "So is insanity."
Montgomery Clift, as the doctor
who mediates between the suf
fering and tho insensitive, clearly
projects a quiet and incisive un
derstanding. Elizabeth Taylor, as
the mental patient, is unusually
successful in porl raying emo
tional instability, by making her
character constantly strive to ap
pear as normal as possible.
Katherine Hepburn, who plays
the complex part of the mother,
does absolutely nothing to adapt
herself to the role. She often
looks uncomfortable, rather than
unstable, but she is still credible
after her usual fashion.
"Suddenly, Last Summer" as a
play is a psychological horror
story. Because of a more inter
pretive emphasis on the fear and
treatment of insanity and the con
sistently believable acting, it is
an extremely moving and absorb
ing film.
