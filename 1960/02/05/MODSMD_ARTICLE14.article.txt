The big controversy about de
fense arises from the fact, which
nobody denies, that the Soviet
Union is several years ahead of
us in the production of missiles
and in tlie exploration of outer
space.
The Russians have more mis
siles. They have bigger missiles
capable of carrying bigger loads.
And judging by such fabulous ex
ploits as directing a satellite to
photograph the other side of the
moon, they are far ahead in the
whole art of guidance of missiles.
The controversy in Washing
ton is about the consequences
and the remedies, given the fact
that we have fallen behind in
the race of armaments, in this
controversy there are several
points.
The first, and obviously the
most immediately important, is
whether the Soviet Union's lead
in missiles is such that the Rus
sians are on the verge of achiev
ing decisive military superiority.
By decisive military superiority
is meant the power to attack with
out suffering serious retaliations.
In theory, the Soviet Union
will have this decisive superior
ity within the next two years
—if we do nothing more to off
set it than we are now planning
to do —if it has 150 long range
missiles, together with another
150 medium range missiles, in
place, aimed and ready to be
launched.
In theory, with one salvo of
such a missile force, the Soviet
Union could knock out and de
stroy all of our retaliatory forces.
After thai we would be helpless
and at Ihe mercy of the Soviet
Union.
Those who use Ibis theory in
their argument for greater arm
aments are, like Gen. Power of
the Strategic Air Force, quick
to add that there are several
things that we could do, espe
cially to keep a part of the Stra
tegic Air Force in the air where
it cannot be hit by a surprise
attack.
The Administration case, as I
understand it, starts from the
proposition, which everyone
agrees to, lhai neither side will
launch a nuclear offensive if,
after the offensive has been
struck, the other country still
possesses the power to retailiate.
The heart of the Administration
case is that it is not necessary,
though it would be desirable, to
have an equal number of missiles
in order to deter a Pearl Harbor
attack.
But the country which is at
tacked would not need an equal
number of missiles to retaliate

because it would not strike
against difficult (ai'n«'ts like
launching pads. It would strike
directly at tlie biggest cities
where, given the fearful wide
spread effect of modern weap
ons, no great accuracy is re
quired.
The peril is that in (lie race, not
only in armaments, but in overall
national power, ihe Soviet Union
is moving ahead faster than we
are. There is a misconception, so
it seems to mo, even in high and
responsible quarters, that the So
viets are ahead only because they
started a lew years earlier, and
that in a few years we shall be
oven with them again.
The real situation, which is
the source of 01 r peril, is that
because in this v;>st field the
Soviet Union has gotten its re
search and development effec
tively organized, and because
the Soviet I nion is allocating to
it all the resources that it re
quires, the gap is not becoming
narrower, it is becoming wider.
Not only did they have a head
start but they are now running
faster.
The Administration's specific
budget for 1961 may conceivably
be adequate but the philosophy
behind that budget is deadly and
will reduce this country to a sec
ond class power.
This does not mean that the
Soviet Union will soon or in the
foreseeable future achieve deci
sive military supremacy. I am
quite prepared to believe that
we shall be aide to de what (it n.
Power says we must do, that
"once we have reached the point
where a surprise attack can no
longer prevent or even minimize
retaliation," we shall have the
security of a nuclear stalemate.
Rut security, though it is cru
cial, is not sufficient and we can
not be satisfied to accept the posi
tion of second best.
Great peoples can bo put to
sleep. This can be done if the
peoples' leaflet's tell them to gn to
sleep, and not to listen to those
disturbers of their transquility
who toll them to turn away from
the little things and to worry
about iho big ones.
