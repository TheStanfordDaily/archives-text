## Clubs Told Pub Board Must Clear Advertising 
### Doug Willis 
Legislature voted I 1 - G last night to permit the Interclub Coun
eil to sell advertising in its rushing manual provided that the Council
clear its prospective advertising with Publication Board.
The action was a compromise between a previous Publications
Board decision refusing any advertising to the ICC manual and a

pica by ICC President Jack Griggs
for blanket approval of ICC's ad
vertising.
Griggs called Publications
Board, which has authority to
permit or deny advertising to
campus publications, a prejudiced,
monopolistic group thai has only
disregard for the facts. He said
that Pub Board cares only for
the interests of the publications
its members represent.
Cnrtail Scholars
Griggs presented arguments to
prove that the CC manual has a
precedence and need for adver
tising, that ICC should not be
forced to give up its advertising
to subsidize the all-campus pub
lications and that, the ICC would
have to curtail its foreign scholar
program if it were denied ad
vertising in its manual.
Publications Board Chairman
Bob d'Alessio pointed out the ICC
manual alone would not hurt the
publications, but that the Daily,
Quad and Chaparral could not
afford to open advertising to the
whole campus.
According to d'Alessio the Leg
islature decision would decide
whether or' not Pub Board should
limit advertising to the all-cam
pus permanent publications.
