The Stanford boxing team trav
els to Chico Saturday where they
will slug it out with Chico State.
This will be the first meei of the
1960 season for the Stanford
fighh rs.
.Coach Ray Lunny feels that
this year s Stanford team is the
finest he has had at Stanford. He
reports that all the boxers are in
top condition and expects a ban
ner season.
1 his year's Stanford team is the
experienced than any Lunny has
handled at the Farm, along with
being in top condition. The Indi
ans will be missing one of their
top boxers on the trip to Chico,
Talton Ray, talented lightheavy,
hurt his hand in workouts earlier
and will be unable to fight this
weekend.
liothman Substitutes
Lunin will call on Ed Rothman
1o handle the light-heavy chores
for the Cauls. Although inxperi
enced, Rothman handles himself
well, and his hard punching and
speed make up foi his lack ol
experience. Rothman is normally
a heavyweight, but will be fight
ing at the ITS pound weighl spot
to take up the slack left by the

loss of Ray.
Rothman will face Bob Jellison
of Chico. Jellison won and lost to
Cal's Kayo Hallinan last year, and
Kayo is rated one of the top light
heavies in the state.
In another top match, Stan
ford's hi g h I y regarded heavy
weight, Trev Grimm, will face
State's Daryl Talkin. Grimm had
been nursing a sore arm. but is
now in fine form and will give
the Chico entry a real battle.
