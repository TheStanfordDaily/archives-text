# Stanford Five to Battle Strong Southland Foes
## 
### Russ Allen Sports Editor 
Stanford cagers left yesterday
afternoon for the Southland and
crucial weekend encounters with
USC /uid UCLA Friday and Sat
urday nights in the L.A. Sports
Arena. However, Tribe hopes were
d i m m e d somewhat as forward
Jerry Thuesen was left behind
with a knee injury and A 1 Simila
remained here with the flu.
Thuesen's injury was fairly
serious, and it is possible that he
may be lost for the season to the
Tribe. Mike Legerwood "and Rich
Thompson will go in place of the
ailing Indians.
Things looked a little better for
Stanford as guard and top Stan
ford scorer John Arrillaga will
return in full form to the lineup
tonight against the Trojans.
Who Gets Werlias?
The big question in tonight's
contest will be which Indian will
guard SC's ace John Werlias. Wer
lias is picked lo repeat on the All-
Conference Five at the end of the
season by most experts and aver
aged 20 points in both games
against the Cards last year as a
junior.
Another Trojan which should
give the Tribe a lot of trouble will
be sophomore forward John Rude
mat kin. a ()-() rebounder and an
excellent shot.
Finally, the third big question
tonight will lie whether the Stan
ford cagers can keep big Jim
Hanna out from underneath and
hence cut down his rebounding
and scoring. The tough Trojan
center is one of the strongest and
most experienced big men on the
('oast.
Bruins Tough
Saturday night the Tribe faces a
big question mark, i.e., how good
are those UCLA Bruins? Their 9-N
record is identical with Stanford's
but they have twice beaten their
cross I own neighbors USC, which
was considered one of the top
western teams and are in second
place in the AAWU only one
half game behind Cal.
Center John Berberich is cur
rently leading the Uclan scoring
with a 10..1 point per game aver
age. The Sherman Oaks junior
leads an evenly balanced Bruin
team in scoring and is fol
lower! by I lie experienced Kent
Miller, who may miss the Stan
ford test flue to an injured ankle.
The Bruins rely heavily on their
baekcourt men guards Bill Ellis

and John Green for scoring as
these two are curenlly battling
the leaders in the team scoring
race.
Berberich and Miller are both
tough rebounders for the Bruins
and they use their (>-8 and (i (>
heights to the best advantage.
Another Uclan to watch will be
the other forward, Pete Black
man, who is the top free-throw
shot and hit for 20 points against
the Air Force Academy in the
last Bruin outing.
Both SC and UCLA come back
after a week layoff due to exams
so might be a bit rusty but cer
tainly the Indians expeel two
tough games this weekend.

Recordwi.se, S t a n for d an <
UCLA boast 3-1 marks, both hav
ing lost to powerful California.
