## Compromise Education Bill Passes 
### 
WASHINGTON (/Pi-The Sen
cilo voted Thursday to give I he
states 917 million dollars a year
for two years in federal mone\
for school construction and teach
er salaries.
It reached this compromise on
a 54-35 vote preliminary to the
expected quick passage of 1960's
first education legislation. A Pres
idential veto seemed likely if the
bill ever gels to the White House
carrying such a totalâ€”sl,Boo.-
000.
Ilill C ompared
Senators A. S. Mike Monroney
(D-Okla.) and Joseph C. Clark < D-
Pa.) worked out the compromise.
It compares with 500 million a
year for two years, &nd for con
struction only, which was pro
posed in the bill on which the
Senate began work Tuesday.
It also compares with a Clark
plan, defeated Wednesday night
with the aid of Vice President
Richard M. Nixon, to provide $1.-
100,000,000 a year indefinitely in
federal grants to aid construction
and teacher salaries.
Ma telling Funds
After accepting the compro
mise, the Senate adopted by voice
vote another Monroney amend
ment setting up what states
would have to do in the way of
matching the federal grants.
Under it, there would be no
matching requirement the first
year but in the second year states
would have to put up on the
average matching funds equal to
about one-fourth of the federal
grants.
However, the requirements for
individual states would vary
widely depending on their wealth.
