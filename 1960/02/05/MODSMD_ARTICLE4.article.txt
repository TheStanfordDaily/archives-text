drive against the right, some of
whose more vociferous members
are. opposed to democracy out
right. Between 30 and 40 right
ists were scoopcd up there in a
police dragnet for questioning on
the sources of last week's settlers,
insurrection.

passed that he would not attend
the Friday Cabinet session. The
Paris press assumed that means
he is out.
A spokesman at Soustelle's of
fice said he would never resign

De Gaulle would fire him."
