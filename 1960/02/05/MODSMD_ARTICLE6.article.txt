# STANFORD REACHES SUN!
## Scientists Bounce Radar Beam Off Sun's Surface 
### Jack Clumeck 
A scientific milestone achieved hy Stanford scientists direct
contact with the sun was announced at a campus press conference
by Professor Von R. Eshleman, Lt. Coi. Robert C. Bart hie, and Dr.
Philip Gallagher, collaborators on the Radioscience Laboratory's
project last April.
Provost Frederick Terman. former dean of the school of engineer-

ing, opened the press conference
with an introduction which high
lighted the significance of the
achievement as being "by far the
greatest distance man has sent
anything and gotten part of it
back." The sun is 93 million miles
from the earth.
Prof. Eshlcman explained the
radar antenna as consisting of
miles of wire, -spread over 1 1
acres of ground behind the isola
tion hospital, and a 40,000 watt
transformer. A coded pulse,
beamed at the sun. was sent
out in 30-second bursts to facili
tate its identity on the return trip
from the sun. The energy of these

pulses hit Iho gases around the
solar orb, was reflected, and re
turned to earth. After 6 months
of deciphering the recorded radio
"noise" of the sun following the
transmissions, a gift IBM-707
computer concluded that hidden
among the radio emissions of the
sun was, in fact, the coded pulse
sent out from Stanford. Charts
of the ideal shape of the fre
quency transmitted and those pre
sumably returned confirmed the
tabulations to a point of 99.999
per cent certainty.
Fast as Light.
Analogizing the radar energy
to light energy for simplicity, Dr.
Eshleman explained that the
radar waves travel at the same
speed as light (186,000 miles per
second), but at a different and
invisible wavelength. The sun was
"lit up" by the radar waves
there was a "flash" of energy on
tlie sun. Some 40,000 watts were
sent out, of which 100 watts
reached the sun because of atmos
pheric and spacial dissipation of
energy. The ret u r n energy
amounted to 10-16 (.000000000000-
00001 > watts. The decrease of
wattage was further likened to a
hypothetical case where, if all of
the electrical power generated in
the world were to be sent out, the
energy returned would "light a
flashlight bulb for one second."
Suns Radiation
The detection of this miniscule
amount of energy was compli
cated by the fact that the sun
itself radiates and emits vast
amounts of similar energy. Each
square inch of the sun, it has
been calculated, gives out 40,000
watts, which is imposed over the
reflected radiation of the Stan
ford transmitter, and recorded at
the Stanford receiver.
The recording was composed of
the various wavelengths of the
sun's radiation and was the pure
"color" of the Stanford transmis
sion. "We sent out only a single
frequency, which we could look
carefully for, ignoring the sun's
wavelengths." Eshleman explain
ed. though the "echo was 50,000
energy."
Predictions for the Future
Eshleman eoncludcd his open
ing explanation of the achieve
ment with some predictions for
the future. Further exploration
by radar telescopes, such as this
experiment, will be done to such
an extent that "all the rest of the
solar system will be within our
can in the next few years."
A question and answer period
followed in which Lt. Col Barlhle,
studying at Stanford for his Ph.D.
and writing his dissertation on
this project, assured the group of
reporters that the sun was really
contacted. "Because of size and in
spite of distance." The figure of
99.999 per cent certainty was
statistically derived and considers
the possibility that the echo indi
cation was cans e d by so I a r
'noise.' "
Dr. Gallagher explained that
the antenna used was designed by
the Stanford Research Institute
Laboratories, and that the Office
of Navy Research paid the $30,000
for construction of the rhombic
array, used mainly for iono
spheric research. As to the value
of radar astronomy, it was ex
plained that visual and radio
astronomy depend on natural ra
diations from the object being in
vestigated, while w i th rad a r
astronomy, the wavelength is con
trolled and reflected, making ex
aminations of "dead" and "cold"
spacial matter possible and more
exacting.
Time for Tests
Lt. Col. Bart hie then elucidated
on the time required for the radar
signal to reach and return. The
tests wise run,on April 7. 10. and
12 of last year, and the time
varied between 16 minutes 35 sec
onds to 16 minutes 28 seconds,
with 16:32 as the average. The
variance was probably caused by
the changing shape of the sun's
corona, composed of highly
ionized gases.
Periodic "storms" on the sun
and resulting alterations to the
corona, cause the solar flares and
similar violent eruptions thai
hurl streams of particles into
space. These particles, trapped in
the earth's magnetic field, form
the radiation belts which pose a
serious threat to space travel.

Their release from the sun is
usually followed on earth by vivid
displays of Northern Lights, mag
netic storms, and complete black
out of long-distance radio com
munications. Continual radar
surveillance of the sun would
make such phenomena predict
able.
Gaseous I'lasnia
Dr. Gallagher explained that
the low frequency of the signal
transmitted (25.6 megacycles)
was intended "to keep tho energy
from being absorbed by the 'soft'
target" of the gaseous plasma of
I he sun. "A higher frequency
would penertate further into the
corona and be absorbed, yet the
frequency was high enough so as
to go through the ionosphere."
Dr. Eshleman explained that
1 he experiment was conducted for
Hie three days only because the
dual-purpose transmitting and re
ceiving antenna is in a fixed posi
tion on the ground, being strung
among telephone poles in four
broadside diamond (rhombic) pat
terns of 800 by 725 feet each. At
the spring and fall equinoxes, the
sun rose exactly correctly with
respect to the antenna to permit
the experiment. An attempt at
the fall equinox in September of
1959 failed when certain antenna
components failed. The sun is in
the antenna beam for only about
30 minutes soon after sunrise on
a few days near each equinoctial
period.
Financing
Stressed throughout the con
lerence was the significance of
the inoperativeness of this scien
tific endeavor. Financing came
primarily from the Air Force
Cambridge Research Center, with
additional funds from the Office
of Naval Research, Wright-Pat
terson Air Force Base, the Penta
gon, the Army, and the National
Space Agency. Provost Terman
elaborated on this project as be

ing conducted in "an environment
and the result of a group of
people and apparatus; an inte
grated program of. scientific ac
tivity and tools." He concluded

that it was "a milestone in one
area of science a symbol of the
activity that has become quite im
portant here at Stanford and
throughout the scientific world."

A scientific milestone achieved hy Stanford scientists direct
contact with the sun was announced at a campus press conference
by Professor Von R. Eshleman, Lt. Coi. Robert C. Bart hie, and Dr.
Philip Gallagher, collaborators on the Radioscience Laboratory's
project last April.
Provost Frederick Terman. former dean of the school of engineer-

ing, opened the press conference
with an introduction which high
lighted the significance of the
achievement as being "by far the
greatest distance man has sent
anything and gotten part of it
back." The sun is 93 million miles
from the earth.
Prof. Eshlcman explained the
radar antenna as consisting of
miles of wire, -spread over 1 1
acres of ground behind the isola
tion hospital, and a 40,000 watt
transformer. A coded pulse,
beamed at the sun. was sent
out in 30-second bursts to facili
tate its identity on the return trip
from the sun. The energy of these

pulses hit Iho gases around the
solar orb, was reflected, and re
turned to earth. After 6 months
of deciphering the recorded radio
"noise" of the sun following the
transmissions, a gift IBM-707
computer concluded that hidden
among the radio emissions of the
sun was, in fact, the coded pulse
sent out from Stanford. Charts
of the ideal shape of the fre
quency transmitted and those pre
sumably returned confirmed the
tabulations to a point of 99.999
per cent certainty.
Fast as Light.
Analogizing the radar energy
to light energy for simplicity, Dr.
Eshleman explained that the
radar waves travel at the same
speed as light (186,000 miles per
second), but at a different and
invisible wavelength. The sun was
"lit up" by the radar waves
there was a "flash" of energy on
tlie sun. Some 40,000 watts were
sent out, of which 100 watts
reached the sun because of atmos
pheric and spacial dissipation of
energy. The ret u r n energy
amounted to 10-16 (.000000000000-
00001 > watts. The decrease of
wattage was further likened to a
hypothetical case where, if all of
the electrical power generated in
the world were to be sent out, the
energy returned would "light a
flashlight bulb for one second."
Suns Radiation
The detection of this miniscule
amount of energy was compli
cated by the fact that the sun
itself radiates and emits vast
amounts of similar energy. Each
square inch of the sun, it has
been calculated, gives out 40,000
watts, which is imposed over the
reflected radiation of the Stan
ford transmitter, and recorded at
the Stanford receiver.
The recording was composed of
the various wavelengths of the
sun's radiation and was the pure
"color" of the Stanford transmis
sion. "We sent out only a single
frequency, which we could look
carefully for, ignoring the sun's
wavelengths." Eshleman explain
ed. though the "echo was 50,000
energy."
Predictions for the Future
Eshleman eoncludcd his open
ing explanation of the achieve
ment with some predictions for
the future. Further exploration
by radar telescopes, such as this
experiment, will be done to such
an extent that "all the rest of the
solar system will be within our
can in the next few years."
A question and answer period
followed in which Lt. Col Barlhle,
studying at Stanford for his Ph.D.
and writing his dissertation on
this project, assured the group of
reporters that the sun was really
contacted. "Because of size and in
spite of distance." The figure of
99.999 per cent certainty was
statistically derived and considers
the possibility that the echo indi
cation was cans e d by so I a r
'noise.' "
Dr. Gallagher explained that
the antenna used was designed by
the Stanford Research Institute
Laboratories, and that the Office
of Navy Research paid the $30,000
for construction of the rhombic
array, used mainly for iono
spheric research. As to the value
of radar astronomy, it was ex
plained that visual and radio
astronomy depend on natural ra
diations from the object being in
vestigated, while w i th rad a r
astronomy, the wavelength is con
trolled and reflected, making ex
aminations of "dead" and "cold"
spacial matter possible and more
exacting.
Time for Tests
Lt. Col. Bart hie then elucidated
on the time required for the radar
signal to reach and return. The
tests wise run,on April 7. 10. and
12 of last year, and the time
varied between 16 minutes 35 sec
onds to 16 minutes 28 seconds,
with 16:32 as the average. The
variance was probably caused by
the changing shape of the sun's
corona, composed of highly
ionized gases.
Periodic "storms" on the sun
and resulting alterations to the
corona, cause the solar flares and
similar violent eruptions thai
hurl streams of particles into
space. These particles, trapped in
the earth's magnetic field, form
the radiation belts which pose a
serious threat to space travel.

Their release from the sun is
usually followed on earth by vivid
displays of Northern Lights, mag
netic storms, and complete black
out of long-distance radio com
munications. Continual radar
surveillance of the sun would
make such phenomena predict
able.
Gaseous I'lasnia
Dr. Gallagher explained that
the low frequency of the signal
transmitted (25.6 megacycles)
was intended "to keep tho energy
from being absorbed by the 'soft'
target" of the gaseous plasma of
I he sun. "A higher frequency
would penertate further into the
corona and be absorbed, yet the
frequency was high enough so as
to go through the ionosphere."
Dr. Eshleman explained that
1 he experiment was conducted for
Hie three days only because the
dual-purpose transmitting and re
ceiving antenna is in a fixed posi
tion on the ground, being strung
among telephone poles in four
broadside diamond (rhombic) pat
terns of 800 by 725 feet each. At
the spring and fall equinoxes, the
sun rose exactly correctly with
respect to the antenna to permit
the experiment. An attempt at
the fall equinox in September of
1959 failed when certain antenna
components failed. The sun is in
the antenna beam for only about
30 minutes soon after sunrise on
a few days near each equinoctial
period.
Financing
Stressed throughout the con
lerence was the significance of
the inoperativeness of this scien
tific endeavor. Financing came
primarily from the Air Force
Cambridge Research Center, with
additional funds from the Office
of Naval Research, Wright-Pat
terson Air Force Base, the Penta
gon, the Army, and the National
Space Agency. Provost Terman
elaborated on this project as be

ing conducted in "an environment
and the result of a group of
people and apparatus; an inte
grated program of. scientific ac
tivity and tools." He concluded

that it was "a milestone in one
area of science a symbol of the
activity that has become quite im
portant here at Stanford and
throughout the scientific world."

A scientific milestone achieved hy Stanford scientists direct
contact with the sun was announced at a campus press conference
by Professor Von R. Eshleman, Lt. Coi. Robert C. Bart hie, and Dr.
Philip Gallagher, collaborators on the Radioscience Laboratory's
project last April.
Provost Frederick Terman. former dean of the school of engineer-

ing, opened the press conference
with an introduction which high
lighted the significance of the
achievement as being "by far the
greatest distance man has sent
anything and gotten part of it
back." The sun is 93 million miles
from the earth.
Prof. Eshlcman explained the
radar antenna as consisting of
miles of wire, -spread over 1 1
acres of ground behind the isola
tion hospital, and a 40,000 watt
transformer. A coded pulse,
beamed at the sun. was sent
out in 30-second bursts to facili
tate its identity on the return trip
from the sun. The energy of these

pulses hit Iho gases around the
solar orb, was reflected, and re
turned to earth. After 6 months
of deciphering the recorded radio
"noise" of the sun following the
transmissions, a gift IBM-707
computer concluded that hidden
among the radio emissions of the
sun was, in fact, the coded pulse
sent out from Stanford. Charts
of the ideal shape of the fre
quency transmitted and those pre
sumably returned confirmed the
tabulations to a point of 99.999
per cent certainty.
Fast as Light.
Analogizing the radar energy
to light energy for simplicity, Dr.
Eshleman explained that the
radar waves travel at the same
speed as light (186,000 miles per
second), but at a different and
invisible wavelength. The sun was
"lit up" by the radar waves
there was a "flash" of energy on
tlie sun. Some 40,000 watts were
sent out, of which 100 watts
reached the sun because of atmos
pheric and spacial dissipation of
energy. The ret u r n energy
amounted to 10-16 (.000000000000-
00001 > watts. The decrease of
wattage was further likened to a
hypothetical case where, if all of
the electrical power generated in
the world were to be sent out, the
energy returned would "light a
flashlight bulb for one second."
Suns Radiation
The detection of this miniscule
amount of energy was compli
cated by the fact that the sun
itself radiates and emits vast
amounts of similar energy. Each
square inch of the sun, it has
been calculated, gives out 40,000
watts, which is imposed over the
reflected radiation of the Stan
ford transmitter, and recorded at
the Stanford receiver.
The recording was composed of
the various wavelengths of the
sun's radiation and was the pure
"color" of the Stanford transmis
sion. "We sent out only a single
frequency, which we could look
carefully for, ignoring the sun's
wavelengths." Eshleman explain
ed. though the "echo was 50,000
energy."
Predictions for the Future
Eshleman eoncludcd his open
ing explanation of the achieve
ment with some predictions for
the future. Further exploration
by radar telescopes, such as this
experiment, will be done to such
an extent that "all the rest of the
solar system will be within our
can in the next few years."
A question and answer period
followed in which Lt. Col Barlhle,
studying at Stanford for his Ph.D.
and writing his dissertation on
this project, assured the group of
reporters that the sun was really
contacted. "Because of size and in
spite of distance." The figure of
99.999 per cent certainty was
statistically derived and considers
the possibility that the echo indi
cation was cans e d by so I a r
'noise.' "
Dr. Gallagher explained that
the antenna used was designed by
the Stanford Research Institute
Laboratories, and that the Office
of Navy Research paid the $30,000
for construction of the rhombic
array, used mainly for iono
spheric research. As to the value
of radar astronomy, it was ex
plained that visual and radio
astronomy depend on natural ra
diations from the object being in
vestigated, while w i th rad a r
astronomy, the wavelength is con
trolled and reflected, making ex
aminations of "dead" and "cold"
spacial matter possible and more
exacting.
Time for Tests
Lt. Col. Bart hie then elucidated
on the time required for the radar
signal to reach and return. The
tests wise run,on April 7. 10. and
12 of last year, and the time
varied between 16 minutes 35 sec
onds to 16 minutes 28 seconds,
with 16:32 as the average. The
variance was probably caused by
the changing shape of the sun's
corona, composed of highly
ionized gases.
Periodic "storms" on the sun
and resulting alterations to the
corona, cause the solar flares and
similar violent eruptions thai
hurl streams of particles into
space. These particles, trapped in
the earth's magnetic field, form
the radiation belts which pose a
serious threat to space travel.

Their release from the sun is
usually followed on earth by vivid
displays of Northern Lights, mag
netic storms, and complete black
out of long-distance radio com
munications. Continual radar
surveillance of the sun would
make such phenomena predict
able.
Gaseous I'lasnia
Dr. Gallagher explained that
the low frequency of the signal
transmitted (25.6 megacycles)
was intended "to keep tho energy
from being absorbed by the 'soft'
target" of the gaseous plasma of
I he sun. "A higher frequency
would penertate further into the
corona and be absorbed, yet the
frequency was high enough so as
to go through the ionosphere."
Dr. Eshleman explained that
1 he experiment was conducted for
Hie three days only because the
dual-purpose transmitting and re
ceiving antenna is in a fixed posi
tion on the ground, being strung
among telephone poles in four
broadside diamond (rhombic) pat
terns of 800 by 725 feet each. At
the spring and fall equinoxes, the
sun rose exactly correctly with
respect to the antenna to permit
the experiment. An attempt at
the fall equinox in September of
1959 failed when certain antenna
components failed. The sun is in
the antenna beam for only about
30 minutes soon after sunrise on
a few days near each equinoctial
period.
Financing

lerence was the significance of
the inoperativeness of this scien
tific endeavor. Financing came
primarily from the Air Force
Cambridge Research Center, with
additional funds from the Office

A scientific milestone achieved hy Stanford scientists direct
contact with the sun was announced at a campus press conference
by Professor Von R. Eshleman, Lt. Coi. Robert C. Bart hie, and Dr.
Philip Gallagher, collaborators on the Radioscience Laboratory's
project last April.
Provost Frederick Terman. former dean of the school of engineer-

ing, opened the press conference
with an introduction which high
lighted the significance of the
achievement as being "by far the
greatest distance man has sent
anything and gotten part of it
back." The sun is 93 million miles
from the earth.
Prof. Eshlcman explained the
radar antenna as consisting of
miles of wire, -spread over 1 1
acres of ground behind the isola
tion hospital, and a 40,000 watt
transformer. A coded pulse,
beamed at the sun. was sent
out in 30-second bursts to facili
tate its identity on the return trip
from the sun. The energy of these

pulses hit Iho gases around the
solar orb, was reflected, and re
turned to earth. After 6 months
of deciphering the recorded radio
"noise" of the sun following the
transmissions, a gift IBM-707
computer concluded that hidden
among the radio emissions of the
sun was, in fact, the coded pulse
sent out from Stanford. Charts
of the ideal shape of the fre
quency transmitted and those pre
sumably returned confirmed the
tabulations to a point of 99.999
per cent certainty.
Fast as Light.
Analogizing the radar energy
to light energy for simplicity, Dr.
Eshleman explained that the
radar waves travel at the same
speed as light (186,000 miles per
second), but at a different and
invisible wavelength. The sun was
"lit up" by the radar waves
there was a "flash" of energy on
tlie sun. Some 40,000 watts were
sent out, of which 100 watts
reached the sun because of atmos
pheric and spacial dissipation of
energy. The ret u r n energy
amounted to 10-16 (.000000000000-
00001 > watts. The decrease of
wattage was further likened to a
hypothetical case where, if all of
the electrical power generated in
the world were to be sent out, the
energy returned would "light a
flashlight bulb for one second."
Suns Radiation
The detection of this miniscule
amount of energy was compli
cated by the fact that the sun
itself radiates and emits vast
amounts of similar energy. Each
square inch of the sun, it has
been calculated, gives out 40,000
watts, which is imposed over the
reflected radiation of the Stan
ford transmitter, and recorded at
the Stanford receiver.
The recording was composed of
the various wavelengths of the
sun's radiation and was the pure
"color" of the Stanford transmis
sion. "We sent out only a single
frequency, which we could look
carefully for, ignoring the sun's
wavelengths." Eshleman explain
ed. though the "echo was 50,000
energy."
Predictions for the Future
Eshleman eoncludcd his open
ing explanation of the achieve
ment with some predictions for
the future. Further exploration
by radar telescopes, such as this
experiment, will be done to such
an extent that "all the rest of the
solar system will be within our
can in the next few years."
A question and answer period
followed in which Lt. Col Barlhle,
studying at Stanford for his Ph.D.
and writing his dissertation on
this project, assured the group of
reporters that the sun was really
contacted. "Because of size and in
spite of distance." The figure of
99.999 per cent certainty was
statistically derived and considers
the possibility that the echo indi
cation was cans e d by so I a r
'noise.' "
Dr. Gallagher explained that
the antenna used was designed by
the Stanford Research Institute
Laboratories, and that the Office
of Navy Research paid the $30,000
for construction of the rhombic
array, used mainly for iono
spheric research. As to the value
of radar astronomy, it was ex
plained that visual and radio
astronomy depend on natural ra
diations from the object being in
vestigated, while w i th rad a r
astronomy, the wavelength is con
trolled and reflected, making ex
aminations of "dead" and "cold"
spacial matter possible and more
exacting.
Time for Tests
Lt. Col. Bart hie then elucidated
on the time required for the radar
signal to reach and return. The
tests wise run,on April 7. 10. and
12 of last year, and the time
varied between 16 minutes 35 sec
onds to 16 minutes 28 seconds,
with 16:32 as the average. The
variance was probably caused by
the changing shape of the sun's
corona, composed of highly
ionized gases.
Periodic "storms" on the sun
and resulting alterations to the
corona, cause the solar flares and
similar violent eruptions thai
hurl streams of particles into
space. These particles, trapped in
the earth's magnetic field, form
the radiation belts which pose a
serious threat to space travel.

usually followed on earth by vivid
displays of Northern Lights, mag
netic storms, and complete black
out of long-distance radio com
munications. Continual radar
surveillance of the sun would
make such phenomena predict
able.
Gaseous I'lasnia
Dr. Gallagher explained that
the low frequency of the signal
transmitted (25.6 megacycles)
was intended "to keep tho energy
from being absorbed by the 'soft'
target" of the gaseous plasma of
I he sun. "A higher frequency
would penertate further into the
corona and be absorbed, yet the
frequency was high enough so as
to go through the ionosphere."
Dr. Eshleman explained that
1 he experiment was conducted for
Hie three days only because the
dual-purpose transmitting and re
ceiving antenna is in a fixed posi
tion on the ground, being strung
among telephone poles in four
broadside diamond (rhombic) pat
terns of 800 by 725 feet each. At
the spring and fall equinoxes, the
sun rose exactly correctly with

I he sun. "A higher frequency
would penertate further into the
corona and be absorbed, yet the
frequency was high enough so as
to go through the ionosphere."
Dr. Eshleman explained that
1 he experiment was conducted for
Hie three days only because the
dual-purpose transmitting and re
ceiving antenna is in a fixed posi
tion on the ground, being strung
among telephone poles in four
broadside diamond (rhombic) pat
terns of 800 by 725 feet each. At
the spring and fall equinoxes, the
sun rose exactly correctly with
respect to the antenna to permit
the experiment. An attempt at
the fall equinox in September of
1959 failed when certain antenna
components failed. The sun is in
the antenna beam for only about
30 minutes soon after sunrise on
a few days near each equinoctial
period.
Financing
Stressed throughout the con
lerence was the significance of
the inoperativeness of this scien
tific endeavor. Financing came
primarily from the Air Force
Cambridge Research Center, with
additional funds from the Office
of Naval Research, Wright-Pat
terson Air Force Base, the Penta
gon, the Army, and the National
Space Agency. Provost Terman
elaborated on this project as be

ing conducted in "an environment
and the result of a group of
people and apparatus; an inte
grated program of. scientific ac
tivity and tools." He concluded

that it was "a milestone in one
area of science a symbol of the
activity that has become quite im
portant here at Stanford and
throughout the scientific world."

the distortion caused by hursts of radio noise from the sun and
interference with the signal's path through space. The broken

STANFORD RESKARCHERS WHO BOUNC KD RADAR OFF SI X

A scientific milestone achieved hy Stanford scientists direct
contact with the sun was announced at a campus press conference
by Professor Von R. Eshleman, Lt. Coi. Robert C. Bart hie, and Dr.
Philip Gallagher, collaborators on the Radioscience Laboratory's
project last April.
Provost Frederick Terman. former dean of the school of engineer-

ing, opened the press conference
with an introduction which high
lighted the significance of the
achievement as being "by far the
greatest distance man has sent
anything and gotten part of it
back." The sun is 93 million miles
from the earth.
Prof. Eshlcman explained the
radar antenna as consisting of
miles of wire, -spread over 1 1
acres of ground behind the isola
tion hospital, and a 40,000 watt
transformer. A coded pulse,
beamed at the sun. was sent
out in 30-second bursts to facili
tate its identity on the return trip
from the sun. The energy of these

pulses hit Iho gases around the
solar orb, was reflected, and re
turned to earth. After 6 months
of deciphering the recorded radio
"noise" of the sun following the
transmissions, a gift IBM-707
computer concluded that hidden
among the radio emissions of the
sun was, in fact, the coded pulse
sent out from Stanford. Charts
of the ideal shape of the fre
quency transmitted and those pre
sumably returned confirmed the
tabulations to a point of 99.999
per cent certainty.
Fast as Light.
Analogizing the radar energy
to light energy for simplicity, Dr.
Eshleman explained that the
radar waves travel at the same
speed as light (186,000 miles per
second), but at a different and
invisible wavelength. The sun was
"lit up" by the radar waves
there was a "flash" of energy on
tlie sun. Some 40,000 watts were
sent out, of which 100 watts
reached the sun because of atmos
pheric and spacial dissipation of
energy. The ret u r n energy
amounted to 10-16 (.000000000000-
00001 > watts. The decrease of
wattage was further likened to a
hypothetical case where, if all of
the electrical power generated in
the world were to be sent out, the
energy returned would "light a
flashlight bulb for one second."
Suns Radiation
The detection of this miniscule
amount of energy was compli
cated by the fact that the sun
itself radiates and emits vast
amounts of similar energy. Each
square inch of the sun, it has
been calculated, gives out 40,000
watts, which is imposed over the
reflected radiation of the Stan
ford transmitter, and recorded at
the Stanford receiver.
The recording was composed of
the various wavelengths of the
sun's radiation and was the pure
"color" of the Stanford transmis
sion. "We sent out only a single
frequency, which we could look
carefully for, ignoring the sun's
wavelengths." Eshleman explain
ed. though the "echo was 50,000
energy."
Predictions for the Future
Eshleman eoncludcd his open
ing explanation of the achieve
ment with some predictions for
the future. Further exploration
by radar telescopes, such as this
experiment, will be done to such
an extent that "all the rest of the
solar system will be within our
can in the next few years."
A question and answer period
followed in which Lt. Col Barlhle,
studying at Stanford for his Ph.D.
and writing his dissertation on
this project, assured the group of
reporters that the sun was really
contacted. "Because of size and in
spite of distance." The figure of
99.999 per cent certainty was
statistically derived and considers
the possibility that the echo indi
cation was cans e d by so I a r
'noise.' "
Dr. Gallagher explained that
the antenna used was designed by
the Stanford Research Institute
Laboratories, and that the Office
of Navy Research paid the $30,000
for construction of the rhombic
array, used mainly for iono
spheric research. As to the value
of radar astronomy, it was ex
plained that visual and radio
astronomy depend on natural ra
diations from the object being in
vestigated, while w i th rad a r
astronomy, the wavelength is con
trolled and reflected, making ex
aminations of "dead" and "cold"
spacial matter possible and more
exacting.
Time for Tests
Lt. Col. Bart hie then elucidated
on the time required for the radar
signal to reach and return. The
tests wise run,on April 7. 10. and
12 of last year, and the time
varied between 16 minutes 35 sec
onds to 16 minutes 28 seconds,
with 16:32 as the average. The
variance was probably caused by
the changing shape of the sun's
corona, composed of highly
ionized gases.
Periodic "storms" on the sun
and resulting alterations to the
corona, cause the solar flares and
similar violent eruptions thai
hurl streams of particles into
space. These particles, trapped in
the earth's magnetic field, form
the radiation belts which pose a
serious threat to space travel.
