# STANFORD REACHES SUN!
## Scientists Bounce Radar Beam Off Sun's Surface 
### Jack Clumeck 
A scientific milestone achieved hy Stanford scientists direct
contact with the sun was announced at a campus press conference
by Professor Von R. Eshleman, Lt. Coi. Robert C. Bart hie, and Dr.
Philip Gallagher, collaborators on the Radioscience Laboratory's
project last April.
Provost Frederick Terman. former dean of the school of engineer-

ing, opened the press conference
with an introduction which high
lighted the significance of the
achievement as being "by far the
greatest distance man has sent
anything and gotten part of it
back." The sun is 93 million miles
from the earth.
Prof. Eshlcman explained the
radar antenna as consisting of
miles of wire, -spread over 1 1
acres of ground behind the isola
tion hospital, and a 40,000 watt
transformer. A coded pulse,
beamed at the sun. was sent
out in 30-second bursts to facili
tate its identity on the return trip
from the sun. The energy of these

pulses hit Iho gases around the
solar orb, was reflected, and re
turned to earth. After 6 months
of deciphering the recorded radio
"noise" of the sun following the
transmissions, a gift IBM-707
computer concluded that hidden
among the radio emissions of the
sun was, in fact, the coded pulse
sent out from Stanford. Charts
of the ideal shape of the fre
quency transmitted and those pre
sumably returned confirmed the
tabulations to a point of 99.999
per cent certainty.
Fast as Light.
Analogizing the radar energy
to light energy for simplicity, Dr.
Eshleman explained that the
radar waves travel at the same
speed as light (186,000 miles per
second), but at a different and
invisible wavelength. The sun was
"lit up" by the radar waves
there was a "flash" of energy on
tlie sun. Some 40,000 watts were
sent out, of which 100 watts
reached the sun because of atmos
pheric and spacial dissipation of
energy. The ret u r n energy
amounted to 10-16 (.000000000000-
00001 > watts. The decrease of
wattage was further likened to a
hypothetical case where, if all of
the electrical power generated in
the world were to be sent out, the
energy returned would "light a
flashlight bulb for one second."
Suns Radiation
The detection of this miniscule
amount of energy was compli
cated by the fact that the sun
itself radiates and emits vast
amounts of similar energy. Each
square inch of the sun, it has
been calculated, gives out 40,000
watts, which is imposed over the
reflected radiation of the Stan
ford transmitter, and recorded at
the Stanford receiver.
The recording was composed of
the various wavelengths of the
sun's radiation and was the pure
"color" of the Stanford transmis
sion. "We sent out only a single
frequency, which we could look
carefully for, ignoring the sun's
wavelengths." Eshleman explain
ed. though the "echo was 50,000
energy."
Predictions for the Future
Eshleman eoncludcd his open
ing explanation of the achieve
ment with some predictions for
the future. Further exploration
by radar telescopes, such as this
experiment, will be done to such
an extent that "all the rest of the
solar system will be within our
can in the next few years."
A question and answer period
followed in which Lt. Col Barlhle,
studying at Stanford for his Ph.D.
and writing his dissertation on
this project, assured the group of
reporters that the sun was really
contacted. "Because of size and in
spite of distance." The figure of
99.999 per cent certainty was
statistically derived and considers
the possibility that the echo indi
cation was cans e d by so I a r
'noise.' "
Dr. Gallagher explained that
the antenna used was designed by
the Stanford Research Institute
Laboratories, and that the Office
of Navy Research paid the $30,000
for construction of the rhombic
array, used mainly for iono
spheric research. As to the value
of radar astronomy, it was ex
plained that visual and radio
astronomy depend on natural ra
diations from the object being in
vestigated, while w i th rad a r
astronomy, the wavelength is con
trolled and reflected, making ex
aminations of "dead" and "cold"
spacial matter possible and more
exacting.
Time for Tests
Lt. Col. Bart hie then elucidated
on the time required for the radar
signal to reach and return. The
tests wise run,on April 7. 10. and
12 of last year, and the time
varied between 16 minutes 35 sec
onds to 16 minutes 28 seconds,
with 16:32 as the average. The
variance was probably caused by
the changing shape of the sun's
corona, composed of highly
ionized gases.
Periodic "storms" on the sun
and resulting alterations to the
corona, cause the solar flares and
similar violent eruptions thai
hurl streams of particles into
space. These particles, trapped in
the earth's magnetic field, form
the radiation belts which pose a
serious threat to space travel.
