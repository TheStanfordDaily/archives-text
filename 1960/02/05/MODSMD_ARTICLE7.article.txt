# $10-15 BILLION MORE
## Ex-Army Chief Taylor Urges $10-15 Billion More for Defense 
### 
WASHINGTON (/Pi Gen Max
well I. Taylor, until last year the
Army's commander, declared
Thursday that from 1961 on the
military tide "will run against us
—unless we take heroic measures
now."
To pay for such measures, the
retired Army chief of staff esti
mated the nation could stand a
50-billion to 55-billion-dollar annu
al military budget. That would be
from 10 to 15 billion more than

President Eisenhower has been j
asking.
"To change the trend will re- !
'quire men, money and sacrifice,"
'' the veteran soldier told the Sen
ate Preparedness subcommittee
! and Space Committee.
"The alternative is military in
feriority— and there is no living;
with communism as an inferior."
In brief, he urged a complete i
j reappraisal of both short-range
| and long-range U.S. military poli- j
cy. In particular, he appealed for j
revamping of the high command
| and the creation of a single pow
erful chief of staff.
While Taylor was speaking in
this vein, Adm. Arleigh A. Burke I
I was telling a Senate Appropria
tions subcommittee U.S. armed
might is growing even more pow
erful.
Later some of Taylor's views j
I were challenged by Gen. Lyman |
' L. Lemnitzer, who succeeded him ;
as Army Chief of Staff.
| Defending the present com
mand organizations, Lemnitzer |

told the senators, "I think we
have a decision-making mecha
nism that can work and docs
work."
The present Army chief also
dispute d Taylor's skepticism
about U.S. ability to fight limited
wars.
"There is no doubt we could do
a very good job," Lemnitzer said,
"although probably not to the
degree some of us would like to
do.
"We have a considerable capa
city to fight a limited war even
if there are some areas we would
like to sec bolstered up."
