# Stravinsky 'Evolved' Says Critic

"In all the somersaults Stravin
sky is supposed to have taken, 1
have always found a logical evo
lution," stated composer-critic
Arthur Berger last night in his
lecture on "The Rapproachement
Between Stravinsky and the Scri
alist Composers."
In 1950, the two rival camps of
music fell away when, upon the
death of Schoenberg, the leader
of the scrialist school, Stravinsky
adopted the serial technique. This
event Berger called "one of the
most astonishing turning points
in the evolution of music. It was
"astonishing" because Stravin
sky's so-called neo-classic tech
nique was very different from
Schoenberg's Serial ism.
Didn't Attack
Berger emphasized the fact thai
Stravinsky never openly attacked
the 12-tone system, as many crit
ics contend. In fact, he asserted,
"serial composition began to man
ifest itself in Stravinsky's music
long before 1031."
1038 saw Stravinsky's first real,
complete use of the 12-tone sys
tem in his "Lamentations of .Jcre
mi;ih." His latest work. "Move
ment for Piano and Orchestra" is
his "most advanced work from
the point of view of structure"
according to Berger. In this com
position, Stravinsky uses what he
calls an "antitonal technique" or
a method which avoids tonality.
Second Power Art
"Stravinsky's merger with 12
tone is the culmination of a life
long process," continued Berger.
Stravinsky, in keeping with the
character of the century, has bor
rowed ideas from the past. This
basing works of ait on other
works of art Berger calls "Art
raised to the second power."
Therefore, as soon as 12-tone en
tered into music, it was natural
for Stravinsky to be interested
| in it.
"Stravinsky comes to serial mu
sic through his fascination with
Imitative devices." Stravinsky has
' always searched for models on
which to form his own compost
' lions.
