# Congress May Up Air Defense Funds-Mahon
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — Foreseeing a period of great peril for
the nation beginning in 1961, a key Democratic lawmaker indicated
yesterday that Congress will multiply funds to provide for an air
borne alert by U.S. bomber forces.
The chairman of the House Defense Appropriations subcommit-

tee, Rep. Geor.'e H. Mahon of j
Texas, said he thinks Congress
will authorize three or four times
the 85 million dollars asked by
President Eisenhower to prepare
for an airborne alert.
Such an alert would keep a sub
stantial portion of U.S. heavy
; bombers in the air at all times,
fully armed with nuclear weap-
I ons, safe from any sneak attack
on ground bases and in position
to strike at enemy targets imme
i diately after any atomic attack on
this country.
Appearing last night on CBS
TV's "Face the Nation." Mahon
agreed wit h administ ration
spokesmen that "this nation is
i stronger than any nation in the
world today" in overall striking
ability. But, he said, the country
is heading into a two- or three
year period, starting in 1961,
when the Soviet Union's superior
ity in intercontinental ballistic
missiles will present "the most
I frighteningly important situation
that we have ever been in in our
! lives."
Doubts Attack
Mahon said "any town in this
| country could be hit in the next
'30 minutes" by a Soviet ICBM
land we have no effective way of
i tending off such blows.
He expressed doubt that any
such attack would come soon but
foresaw a Soviet missile superior
ity of about 3-1 in the critical
period ahead and "no one in the
Pentagon, in Central Intelligence
or in or out of Congress knows"
what Soviet intentions will pro
duce in that period.
Administration's Position
The Texan saw no need for an
I immediate airborne alert but said
! "we may have to have it six
months or a year from now" to
J insure against having our major
1 retaliatory power wiped out by a
j sneak assault.
Mahon's comments were made
shortly before Secretary of the
Air Force Dudley C. Sharp reiter
ated the administration position
that total U.S. military power—
| bombers, missiles, Polaris sub
i marines and mobile task forces—
is adequate to discourage enemy
attack.
No Deterrance Gap
Secretary of the Air Force Dud
ley C. Sharp said yesterday this
country's total military power—
counting bombers, missiles, Po
laris submaries and mobile task
forces—is adequate to discourage
enemy attack.
"And, if we follow our plans as
; we propose to do, it will continue
j to be adequate," Sharp said.
Sharp conceded the United
States may be behind the Soviet
1 Union in missiles, but he said the
I important thing is over-all
strength. In this lie said there is
no "deterrance gap," or shortage
of power to deter attack.
This is a view, promoted by
the administration, that is expect
ed to undergo renewed attack
from critics as U.S. defense plans
face further congressional scruti
ny this week.
The star witness today will be
j the chief on naval operations,
Adm. Arleigh A. Burke, who will
make twin appearances. He goes
before a House committee this
morning and before Senate com
mittees this afternoon to answer
| questions about defense.

i stronger than any nation in the
world today" in overall striking
ability. But, he said, the country
is heading into a two- or three
year period, starting in 1961,
when the Soviet Union's superior
ity in intercontinental ballistic
missiles will present "the most
I frighteningly important situation
that we have ever been in in our
! lives."
Doubts Attack
Mahon said "any town in this
| country could be hit in the next
'30 minutes" by a Soviet ICBM
land we have no effective way of
i tending off such blows.
He expressed doubt that any
such attack would come soon but
foresaw a Soviet missile superior
ity of about 3-1 in the critical
period ahead and "no one in the
Pentagon, in Central Intelligence
or in or out of Congress knows"
what Soviet intentions will pro
duce in that period.
Administration's Position
The Texan saw no need for an
I immediate airborne alert but said
! "we may have to have it six
months or a year from now" to
J insure against having our major
1 retaliatory power wiped out by a
j sneak assault.
Mahon's comments were made
shortly before Secretary of the
Air Force Dudley C. Sharp reiter
ated the administration position
that total U.S. military power—
| bombers, missiles, Polaris sub
i marines and mobile task forces—
is adequate to discourage enemy
attack.
No Deterrance Gap
Secretary of the Air Force Dud
ley C. Sharp said yesterday this
country's total military power—
counting bombers, missiles, Po
laris submaries and mobile task
forces—is adequate to discourage
enemy attack.
"And, if we follow our plans as
; we propose to do, it will continue
j to be adequate," Sharp said.
Sharp conceded the United
States may be behind the Soviet
1 Union in missiles, but he said the
I important thing is over-all
strength. In this lie said there is
no "deterrance gap," or shortage
of power to deter attack.
This is a view, promoted by
the administration, that is expect
ed to undergo renewed attack
from critics as U.S. defense plans
face further congressional scruti
ny this week.
The star witness today will be
j the chief on naval operations,
Adm. Arleigh A. Burke, who will
make twin appearances. He goes

WASHINGTON (/P) — Foreseeing a period of great peril for
the nation beginning in 1961, a key Democratic lawmaker indicated
yesterday that Congress will multiply funds to provide for an air
borne alert by U.S. bomber forces.
The chairman of the House Defense Appropriations subcommit-

tee, Rep. Geor.'e H. Mahon of j
Texas, said he thinks Congress
will authorize three or four times
the 85 million dollars asked by
President Eisenhower to prepare
for an airborne alert.
Such an alert would keep a sub
stantial portion of U.S. heavy
; bombers in the air at all times,
fully armed with nuclear weap-
I ons, safe from any sneak attack
on ground bases and in position
to strike at enemy targets imme
i diately after any atomic attack on
this country.

TV's "Face the Nation." Mahon
