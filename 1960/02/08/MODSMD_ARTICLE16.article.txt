# Dollar Days
## 
### 
The complaints voiced in today's letters on the Winter Drive
are, in our opinion, legitimate ones, and the existence of such
grievances warrants a look at the ell'ecti\eness and merit ol last
\\eck's Dollar I)ays.
(lonlrilnitions given under social pressure arc neither as gen
erous nor as numerous as funds donated with a real desire to give.
That such was the ease in the recent drive is e\ ideuced bv the total
sum collected of $12,000, while the goal was $5.100.
One probable reason lor the lack of effective student partici
pation in the charitv campaign was that some people did indeed
resent the methods ol pressure used to obtain donations, although
such means were not intended l>\ the Drive s leaders.
However, the main reason, we feel, for reluctance to gi\e was
111 m l contributors have no opportunity to see the results of their
generosil\ and are themselves onl\ ver\ indirectly allected by the
organizations receiving the funds.
()l 111Â«' nionev given, onl\ a small percentage returns to the
campus, this coining through the Stanford 'i W (.A. one til the 12
organizations served I>\ the Santa (.lara I nited Imiiul which gets
50 per cent of the \\ inter Drive contributions.
Ilie other two recipients, the Heart Association and the Na
tional Scholarship Sen ice and Fund for Negro Students, also have
little connect ion with the I Diversity, although some Heart funds
are used for research at Stanford.
I liis does not mean to say that giving cannot he (lone in a spirit
of charitv with the knowledge that cont rilnit ions wi 11 be used for
a good purpose which in no way concerns the donor. But students
and their families are approached often enough at home and at
11 ie office for con t ri hut ions 100 remote, alt hough worthwhile, organ
i/atious, so thai charitable opportunities are provided in large
numbers and do not have to be present even time a -Indent opens
his pockclhook.
Winter Drive is not sulTicientlv effective or worthwhile to be
continued in ils present form. However, it can be a great asset to
the Stanford campus if ils purposes are rev ised and directed closer
lo the student hodv.
The nionev collected from the Drive could be used lo provide
a coiilinning book fund for an undergraduate library, or il might
be given to establish a record lihrarv in the music listening rooms
of the proposed student union. There are iiudoubledlv other sug
gestions on this same line which might be acceptable.
If such w ere I lie goals of W inter I )riv e, students won Id be donat
ing lo a cause whose results they could see, and, more important,
which would be of direct benefit to tlieni and lo lite I diversity.
In llii< situation, giving would certainly be more spontaneous
and generous than for the present Drive, and conl ribulions would
he donated more willingly and free Iv than under llie social [ires
sure vs Inch now exists.
