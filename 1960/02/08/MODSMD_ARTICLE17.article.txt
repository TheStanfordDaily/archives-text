It would ho quite inconceivable
to the American public if a group
of students should got together
and stage a demonstration on the
stops of Congress protesting the
passing of a specific bill, and the
recent student riots fire just as
perplexing to the Japanese people.
There are. however, several fac
tors which may point to, if not
explain, the reasons for such oc
currences.
1. Shortness of democratic his
tory. Contemporary Japanese
democracy can be said to have
begun after the Second World
War, a mere 15 years ago. Since
then, much progress has boon
made in the way of maintaining
political stability.
Meager Influence
Nevertheless, minority and
other dissenting g r o up s h a v e
meager influence on the govern
ment and find little expression of
their opinions through the press.
And since individual critics do
not carry much weight, a sort of
muted frustration results.
The Zongarkuren, which repre
sents the entire student body of
all the public universities in Ja
pan (including the University of
Tokyo), was a source of discon
tent during the post-war years.
It has since become controlled
by a nucleus of left-wingers who
think of themselves as the leaders
of student opinion.
2. Educational system. In Japa

nose universities, especially for
the freshman and sophomore
courses in humanities, the stu
dents are taught and graduated
in a "mass-produced" system.
That is, they attend lectures in
mammoth auditoriums and take
notes.
Not only are the students un
acquainted with their professors,
but there exists also a prevalent
feeling that 'the courses are so
abstract that ihe students find
themselves unprepared for ihe
political and economic realities.
On the other hand, it is inter
esting to note that students who
come into closer contact with pro
lessors in group seminars become,
at least politically, more moder
ate.
Marxian Thought
3. Student consciousness. It can
not be denied , that Marxian
thought has infiltrated to prac
tically every corner of the world.
Japan is no exception. Commu
nism, together with democracy,
was suppressed before the war.
Some dissenters even went to
prison for their convictions.
Now that political freedom is
restored, there is a discernible
tendancy, especially among the
lefiist intelligensia, to react
strongly against the govern
ment's policy, whose administra
tors are either unsympathetic to
wards or lacking in understand
ing of the intellectuals.
Divergence
This divergence between the in
telligensia and the political reali
ties of the day is reflected in the
mind of the •students and ex
aggerated by the Zongakuren. By
instigating the riots, it takes upon
itself the role of putting into
practice that which it believes.
The general opinion of the Jap
anese press is that both student
and political authorities are to bo
blamed for those incidents. Moan
while, a bill restricting riotous
demons) ration is being considered.

It would ho quite inconceivable
to the American public if a group
of students should got together
and stage a demonstration on the
stops of Congress protesting the
passing of a specific bill, and the
recent student riots fire just as
perplexing to the Japanese people.
There are. however, several fac
tors which may point to, if not
explain, the reasons for such oc
currences.
1. Shortness of democratic his

democracy can be said to have
begun after the Second World
War, a mere 15 years ago. Since
