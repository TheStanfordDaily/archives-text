# CORRUPTED CREDO
## Millions of Forgeries In Post Office Dept. 
### Dave Quarles Associate Editor 
The quizzes and payola recently
have replaced the omnipresent
communist as the focal point of
our legislators' investigative zeal.
I However, we would like to call
attention to the actions of a
multi-million dollar organization
which daily reaches down into
the life of every loyal American,
the Post Office Department.
The first inkling of trouble
| afoot came several years ago
when Thomas Jefferson's conserv
ative blue face was replaced by
a four cent Lincoln profile with
magenta hair and heard.
Although we don't like to play
presidential favorites, believing
that all American history is equal
ly good, we did prefer the Jet
ferson stamp. However, we over
looked this breech of philatilie
taste and attributed the change to

unseen inflationary pressures.
Rut just last year the Post Of
fice Department's literary battle
with 1). H. Lawrence and the I
Grove Press aroused our suspi- j
cion again. There was certainly
more than inflationary pressure!
behind the department's machina
tions.
This past week we have learned
that the Post Office Department
has been involved in a mammoth
forgery plot on the order of 120
million offenses. The pub 1 i c
spirited investigator in this case
was not Congress but Charles
Hamilton, a leading New York
autograph expert.
Credo Series
After spotting George Wash-1
ington's signature on one of 120
million new four-corners, the first
of six stamps which will comprise
the "American Credo Series,"!
Hamilton told tho press, "This is
forgery."
As ihe grimy details came to
lighl we learned that Washing- j
ton's signature did not meet the
present legibility standards of the
Post Office Department. The
signature had be en qui e 11 y
changed by a department artist,
Frank Conley. who upon being
questioned said that the depart
ment desired a signature that was
readable and that Washington's
was "not too legible."
Blue 'Jefferson
The question of a blue Jeffer
son or a magenta Lincoln is one ]
thing, "Lady Chatterley" is anoth- j
or, but meddling with George j
Washington is beyond all decent
restraint. In expert Hamilton's
words, "Washington's signature
is one of the most famous signa-;
tures in the world, and to tamper!
with it is sacrilegious."
As yet Postmaster General
Arthur- Summerfield has not
made any public statement con
cerning the Washington affair i
and other- doubtful actions of his j
department. However, we certain- !
ly expect some explanation for
tius recent chicanery which pro-j
mises to besmirch 120 million
American tongues.

The question of a blue Jeffer
son or a magenta Lincoln is one ]
thing, "Lady Chatterley" is anoth- j
or, but meddling with George j
Washington is beyond all decent
restraint. In expert Hamilton's
words, "Washington's signature
is one of the most famous signa-;
tures in the world, and to tamper!
with it is sacrilegious."
As yet Postmaster General
Arthur- Summerfield has not
made any public statement con
cerning the Washington affair i
and other- doubtful actions of his j
department. However, we certain- !
ly expect some explanation for
tius recent chicanery which pro-j
mises to besmirch 120 million
American tongues.
The quizzes and payola recently
have replaced the omnipresent
communist as the focal point of
our legislators' investigative zeal.

attention to the actions of a
multi-million dollar organization
which daily reaches down into
the life of every loyal American,
the Post Office Department.
The first inkling of trouble

when Thomas Jefferson's conserv
ative blue face was replaced by
a four cent Lincoln profile with

Although we don't like to play
presidential favorites, believing
that all American history is equal

looked this breech of philatilie
taste and attributed the change to

unseen inflationary pressures.
Rut just last year the Post Of
fice Department's literary battle
with 1). H. Lawrence and the I
Grove Press aroused our suspi- j

more than inflationary pressure!
behind the department's machina
tions.
This past week we have learned
that the Post Office Department
has been involved in a mammoth
forgery plot on the order of 120
million offenses. The pub 1 i c
spirited investigator in this case
was not Congress but Charles
Hamilton, a leading New York
autograph expert.
Credo Series
After spotting George Wash-1

million new four-corners, the first
of six stamps which will comprise
the "American Credo Series,"!
Hamilton told tho press, "This is
forgery."
As ihe grimy details came to
lighl we learned that Washing- j
ton's signature did not meet the
present legibility standards of the
Post Office Department. The
signature had be en qui e 11 y
changed by a department artist,
Frank Conley. who upon being
questioned said that the depart

readable and that Washington's
was "not too legible."
