# CHINATOWN
## Mouse Year Celebration Is Occidental 
### Fran Monson 
The Year of the Mouse opened
in Chinatown Friday night with
a modicum of oriental fanfare
and a rather ratty parade of occi
dental prosperity.
The rain - splattered crowd
along Grant Street was treated
to Army, Navy, Marine and Coast
Guard bands, not to mention a
Scottish brigade complete with
bagpipes and kilts.
In accord with ancient Chinese
tradition, there was a gigantic
aircraft carrier model sporting
two full-fledged Waves, who
waved and waved as their cara
van rolled along.
Rifle Team
There was also a tight-lipped
rifle team, which halted at appro
priate intersections to demon
strate an admirable facility at
shouldering and unshouldering
their rifles.
The Ford convertible was übi
quitous. and carried, among other
things, the officials of the Chi
nese Anti-communist League and
a somewhat harassed Miss Con
geniality.
San Francisco is indeed fortu
nate in having the largest Chi
nese settlement in the country,
and the Chamber of Commerce
has not been hesitant to adver
tise this distinction.
National Holiday
Hopefully, a national holiday
such as New Year \\*>uld be cele
brated in authentic Chinese tra
dition in Chinatown, but this was
not the case this year. The spirit
of the occasion was noticeably
diminished by such extraneous
phenomena as the United States
militia and the Scottish bagpipe
band.
Although I'm not exactly sure
what a traditional Chinese New
Year parade consists of, I'm still
dying to see one.
