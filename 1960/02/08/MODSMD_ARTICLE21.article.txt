Social Pressure
Kriitor, Tlu* Daily:
I am a freshman, idealistic, not
wealthy, and fed up with the Dol
lar Days charity campaign.
I live in a big. astonishingly
well-ordered dorm and so cannot
generalize for all of Stanford;
however, I think the campaign
I shoved down throats here is
worth looking at.
The campaign started at a Mon
day night house meeting where it
< was flatly stated that a dorm
quota must be satisfied and that
competition would be established
on a corridor-wide basis.
Students were contacted in their
rooms by corridor chairmen, a
dollar was asked for, in some
cases receipts were given, and in
all cases there was a chase until
everybody had been tracked down
and hit for money.
In one case, a girl said, "I have
no money;" and the response was,
"Oh, I've heard that one before,
too."
In another case, someone threw
in an extra dollar for a girl re
. fusing to contribute, and she felt
I constrained to repay the girl
though still as strong as ever
i against contributing.
This obviously isn't charity;
there is little altruism when some
one says, "give another dollar so
we can win," or when the whole
I thing is executed with all the

tools of business (receipts, lists,
etc. I.
Furthermore, and perhaps the
most objectionable part of the
campaign, is the social pressure
to give and the stigma if you
don't give.
My advice is to have the thing
done anonymously, spontaneous
ly, with boxes in the dorms and
the post office for contributions.
Of course, this kind of idealism
is presumably ineffectual at get
ling money out of people, and if
the drive must get money out of
people, let's quit pretending it's
charity and simply tack another
dollar onto winter quarter tui
t ion.

Act of Pride
Kditor, The Daily:
The recent "Dollar Days" drive

I
was naturally a great success. A
university quota, dorm quotas,
and corridor rivalry led to a
healthy spirit of competition.
Dormitory winners should bo
proud of their achievements. All
of Stanford should he proud; that
was the purpose of the drive.
I congratulate the leaders of
the drive for their efficiency.
They clearly stated the amount
each student was to give and de
vised effective social pressures to
insure the success of their worthy
cause.
It is unfortunate that somehow
the spirit of the drive was
ignored. Giving is not an act of
sincere concern when the charity
and amount are prescribed.
When organized, itemized, and
forced, giving is only an act of
pride.
