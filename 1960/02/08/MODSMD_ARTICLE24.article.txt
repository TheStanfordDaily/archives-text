UCLA's eratie Bruins failed to
be dismayed by Stanford's "panic
five" tactics and roared into un
disputed second place in the
AAWU baskelball race by breez
ing past the Inflians, 67-54, at Los
Angeles Saturday night.
Stanford, shooting for Ihe Big
Five second* spot ran into the
Bruins on a hot night and were
never in the game after the
Uelans took charge mid-way into
the first half.
The two teams left the floor at
the half time intermission of the
second half of a twin hill with
UCLA holding a 3(5-25 edge over
the Indians.
Trying the same tactics that
worked so well against the USC
Trojans the night before, the In
dians sent a new unit in to start
the second half.
But, the Bruins weren't to be
rattled. Disdaining the new In
dian team, they pushed into an
even greater lead.
Neal Brockmeyer, Stanford's
hard rebounding center, fouled
out for Ihe second night in suc
cession in a vain attempt to hold
down high scoring John Berberich
of UCLA.
While Brockmeyer was trying
to stop Berberich, the Bruins
were fattening their score by
feeding to Gary Cunningham and
Cliff Brandon, two sharp-shooting
UCLA forwards.
The leading scorers for the In
dians were guards John Arrillaga
and Phil Kelly with 12 counters
each.
John Windsor and Bui) Bowl
ing followed with eight and nine
markers respectively.
High for the game were Cunn
ingham with 16 points, followed
by Berberich and Brandon with 13
points each.
