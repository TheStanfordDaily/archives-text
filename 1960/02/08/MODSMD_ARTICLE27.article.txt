# FIRST CARD WIN
## Indian Ruggers Wallop UCLA 
### Art Robinson 
Stanford's Indian ruggers pow
ered to their first win of Ihe sea-}
son by inundating a band of in
experienced UCLA Bruins in a
llood of scoring, 19-3, Saturday j
on the Card rugby field.
The Bruins, playing only their
second contest and their second
in three days, had the misfortune
to meet a Stanford squad that
was to have their best day this I
yea r.
By the end of the match UCLA
was dog-tired and only the dili
gent whistle-looting of the referee j
kept the score from mounting!
even higher.
Reid Scores
Kyrk Reid, out to reinforce his
reputation as one of the league's
top kickers, opened Ihe scoring J
parade with only three minutes'

gone when he split the uprights
wilh a 40 yard penalty kick to
give the Indians a quick three to
nothing lead.
A third of the way through the
first half, Pete Bedford squirmed
over the goal line lo score his
first try of the yet young season.
Some < '(inversion
Reid then added a miraculous
conversion from a difficult angle
lo send the Cards into an eight
point lead.
The Uelans managed their only
score of the day when Ihe first
period was about half completed.
A swift Bruin back squirmed
across the goal stripe to bring
Ihe Bruins momentarily within
striking distance of the high fly
-1 ing Cards.
However, the conversion at
tempi was wide, and Ihe first
half ended with the Indians hold
ing an eight lo three edge.
In the second period UCLA
1 seemed to be holding its own with
the more experienced Stanford
j team.
Face Scores
But then Skip Face, playing
only I second rugby game of
his career, sent Ihe Indians into
a commanding lead with only 15
minutes remaining to play as he
scored on a dazzling dash into the
end zone.
The conversion try was wide.

but Stanford was clearly in com
ma net of I ho game.
There was no stopping Ihp
Cards now as Armand Jacques
took a pass and finessed his way
through the LICLA defense to
score the Indians' third try.
Reid added the conversion to
give the Indians an overwhelming
16-3 budge.
MeMillen Tallies
Hick MeMillen tallied the final
Card counters when he bulled his
way through, over, and around
the Bruin forward wall.
The try for the conversion was
missed, but the game ended
shortly thereafter with Stanford
on top of-a highly pleasing 19
to 3 score.
The smaller Bruins, who have
a reputation for out hustling their
opponents to win their matches,
met their matches in the hard
fighting Indians, who were as
sharp as sharp can be.
Second Game
Credit must be given the UCLA
team who had only one previous
game under their belts and that
only two days before, but the re
turn of Tom McDonald, absent
last week, the addition of Skip
Face, destined to be a bright spot
in the Indian rugby picture, and
the general all around excellence
of the Stanford squad Saturday
made them virtually unbeatable.
But as one witty Bruin was
heard to remark: "You can't
'Houyhnhnm' all."
In a preliminary game, the In
dian JV's were tied by the UCLA
junior varsity, (>-(>.
The next outing for Coach Pete
Kmetovic's Stanford ruggers will
be against the tough University
of Southern California Trojans,
Saturday on the Stanford Rugby
Field.
