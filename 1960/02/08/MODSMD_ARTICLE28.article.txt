## 
### Stan Hulett 
The Stanford boxing team lost
its first encounter of the season
to the Chico State Wildcats, s'j
-2'u, Saturday night in Chico.
The Indians s ho we d m a ny
bright spots on the evening. Bruce
Bellows, a 1.17 pounder, gave an
excellent account of himself, as
he easily decisioned Ken Jensen
of Chico. Bellows blocked almost
every punch his opponent threw
and countered well with a sharp
left.
Kotlunan Sharp
Eddie Rothman, who fought at
ITS pounds although normally a
heavyweight, looked impressive,
although losing, in his slugfest
with highly ranked Bob Jellison
of the Wildcats. Rothman doubled
his opponent up more than once
with sharp left hooks to the body,
but the decision went to the home
town fighter. This decision inci
dentally was not a popular one
with some of the fans and the
Stanford team.
This was not the only decision
thai the hometown fans felt was
a little out of line. Stanford's
Tom Logsdon lost in a close de
cision to State's Don Cruce, a de
cision that many of the ringsiders
felt should have gone the other
way.
In the 139 pound bout, Logsdon
hit his opponent with sharp body
and head shots, and seemed
strong at the finish, but the de
cision of the judges went in favor
of ("ruce, the local product.
Itriglit Spot
Another bright spot was the
sharp punching of Stanford's Jim
Tompkins, who decisioned Chico's
Ben Hoover. Thompkins showed a
fine array of body punches and
head shots and mixed them up
well, to completely outclass the
Wildcat fighter.
Steve Morris, Card 123 pounder,

started the Indians off on Ihe
right foot, as he came in with a
draw decision against State's
Elmer Arranda.
Stanford's Dave James ran into
more than he could handle with
Chico's George Daniels. Although
practically dead on his feet, the
Stanford 147 pounder stayed on
his feet until referee Mel Jones
stopped the bout midway in the
third round.
IVlacDoimld Loses
Card Bill Mac Donald lost a
close decision to Dave Bor.jon of
Chico.
In a featured heavyweight
match, Stanford's Trev Grimm
met his match in Stale's Daryl
Talkin, as the Stanford heavy
lost by a TKO in the second
round.
Next matches will be against
Gal Wednesday night at Berkelev.

Bill Rusell, former USF All-
American center, set a new Na
lional Basketball League rebound
ing record against the Syracuse
Nationals. Russell hauled in .~)1
rebounds to break his old record
of 49.
