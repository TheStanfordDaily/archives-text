# HERE FRIDAY
## Kennedy Hits Eisenhower on West Neglect 
### 
Senator John F. Kennedy, clue
to speak Friday in Memorial Aud
itorium, accused the Eisenhower
administration yesterday of a
shameful neglect of (he West.
In a speech at Albuquerque, he
said it had failed to meet (he chal
lenge of the sixties. "Any admin
istration which has forgotten the
West," lie said, "is an administra
tion which has neglected the na
tion."
Kennedy was invited to address
students and public by the Stan
ford political union. lie will be
on his way from Portland to
Fresno, where he will attend the
annual convention of the Califor
nia Democratic councils. His Stan
ford appearance will be the only
one in the Bay Area. Admission
is free.
Western Theme
The Massachusetts s en a to r,
campaigning for the Democratic
presidential nomination, empha
sized the western theme an a
speech prepared for a breakfast
talk with delegates to the Demo
cratic Western Conference.
The 13-state meeting earlier
heard Sen. Lyndon Johnson of
Texas, who said he isn't seeking
the nomination, and Sen Hubert
Humphrey of Minnesota, a de
clared candidate, but avoided any
endorsement.
Not Sure
Informal samplings indicated
the West as yet has no solid fav
orite for president and that a
heavy share of the delegates, with
a total of 172 votes, will go to the
party's national convention un
committed. The nomination will
require 761 votes.
