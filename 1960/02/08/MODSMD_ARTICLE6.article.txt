## 
### 
HAVANA (/P> Soviet Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan boasted
of Soviel missile might yesterday but told a rally of Cuban workers
his country wants only "peace forever."
The visiting Soviet bigwig got a thunderous ovation from the
meeting of the National Federation of Textile Workers when he was

called upon to speak, and he was j
repeatedly interrupted by api
plause.
Cites Peace Aim
"Those who talk of war," he!
declared, "know that if we can
send a rocket to the moon with
such precision that we can send
a rocket with the same precision ]
to any point on earth."
When the applause subsided, he
said, "War is against our wishes 1
we want peace, peace forever."
With him on the platform was
Ernesto Guevara, leftist president :
of the National Bank of Cuba.
Mikoyan turned up unexpected ]
ly at the rally, dropping his role
of the last 24 hours as the vanish-1
ing Armenian.
Officials had been silent about I
his activities since the Soviet Ar-j
menian wheeled out of his swank
s u b u rb a n residence Saturday
morning under heavy escort and
drove out of Havana.
Talk Trade Relations
It was generally believed the
Soviet Union's No. 1 salesman
had spent this period out of the
limelight in conversations witli
high officials on closer Cuban-
Soviet trade ties. He also was ex
pected to raise the question of re
sum in g diplomatic relations,
broken off in 1952.
The only clue to his where- ;
abouts in all that time was a re- |
port from an army officer in
Matanzas, 50 miles east of Hava
na. The offcer said he saw Miko
yan riding with Prime Minister
Fidel Castro's brother, Raul, min
ister of the armed forces.
A Tass dispatch from Moscow
said Mikoyan and Raul Castro I
visited the Cienaga de Zapata
swamps near Matanzas. These
will be drained and planted with
rice to cut down on Cuba's rice
imports.
Soviet Buys Sugar
While press and radio were
keeping silent about Mikoyan's
visit. Minister of Commerce Raul
Cepero Bonilla praised the Soviet
Union as "a firm and steady buy-!
er of Cuban sugar."
Cepero said the Soviet Union
has bought 345,000 tons of sugar, i
and with this sale Cuba has dis- j
posed of 65 per cent of its 1960
quota in the world market. This i
is but a fraction of the more than j
two millions tons sold annually
to the United States.
Mikoyan wil be guest at a re-i
ception tonight at the presidential
palace but beyond that the events !
of his visit are unannounced. It
still was not know how long ho j
plans to remain in Cuba.
Revolution 'Miracles'
Mikoyan's speech and the union
proceedings were carried over j
loval TV and a national radio;
hookup.
The deputy premier detailed
the rise of the Soviet Union to a
world power under communism 1
and told the cheering workers:
"The Cuban revolution can ac-j
compish miracles too."
He got another big ovation
when he wound up his speech
with these words in heavily ac
cented Spanish: "Long live the:
Cuban people!" He left the hall
immediately after the speech.
