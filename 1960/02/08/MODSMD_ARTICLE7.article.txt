# Wilbur Taboo To Fraternities
## 
### 
Fraternity men, if found in Wil
bur Hall, must now ho prepared
to prove that thoy are not violat
ing rushing regulations, accord
ing to a recent decision of the
Interfraternity Council Rushing
Committee.
In a bulletin to all house presi
dents anrl sponsors, the Council
said that it could envision no
legitimate reasons for the pres
ence of a fraternity man in Wil
bur Hall other than if he is visit
ing a friend or if both are
members of an extra-curricular
organization, and can prove that
they are conducting business of
that organization.
In the former case, the frater
nity man must be able to prove
that the friendship existed before
the freshman's matriculation to
Stanford.
The decision was handed down
in answer to a request from the
Wilbur sponsors for clarification
of the rushing rule limiting the
presence of fraternity men in
Wilbur.
Two recent violations of the
rule restricting the presence of
fraternity men in Wilbur, both
of which resulted in limiting the
number of pledges in the respec
tive houses can take this year,
brought the issue to light.
