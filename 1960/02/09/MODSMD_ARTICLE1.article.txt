# New Chem Building Rises
## 
### 
Construction workers began pouring concrete this week for the
second story of the $000,(MM) John Stuuffer Chemistry Building,
shown here. In the background is the 60-year-old present Chemistry
Building. The new structure, which will have two stories and a
hasement, is scheduled for occupancy by Sept. 1. It will be con
nected with the organic chemistry building, built in 1959, by a
glass enclosed arcade. Primarily designed for research, the new
building was designed by Birge M. Clark of Palo Alto, and will
provide space for some 40 researchers.
