# Navy Requests Billion More For Atom-Subs
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/I 1 ) The Navy, in a bid to build a missile
firing submarine fleet as soon as possible, will ask for 975 million
dollars to pay for six more of the craft than are currently planned.
Adm. Arleigh A. Burke, chief of naval operations, told this to a
Senate hearing yesterday, but he said he isn't sure the Defense De

partment will aprove the pro
posal.

If the request is relayed to Con
gross and passed there, the Po
laris submarine program would
be shoved forward by more than
a third. Al present 15 of the nu
clear-powered boats are on the
way, in one stage or' another.
Burke testified earlier that a
fleet of 45 such subs, equipped
with 16 missiles each to strike at
targets in the Soviet Union from
under the sea, would give the
United States a big enough re
taliatory force to keep the Soviets
at bay.
Burke Supports Ike
Questioned by Democratic sena
ators. Burke said he probably
would continue to support Presi
dent, Eisenhower 's budget even if
the President should turn down
the Navy's appeal for a stepup in
the Polaris program.
"If I didn't accept it, I wouldn't
remain in my present position,"
the Navy chief said.
Sen. Howard Cannon (D-Nov.)
pressed Burke for a yes or no
answer as to whether the adminis
tration defense budegt is "doing
enough to protect the safety and
security of this country at this
time."
Not Enough for Safety
"I can't answer it yes or no,"
Burke said.
But a resounding "no" came
from the other side of Capitol Hill
where the chairman of the power
fid House Appropriations Com
mittee declared the United States
has forfeited control over land,
sea and air by spending too little
for defense.
But about the time Cannon was
cutting loose with his blast, Burke
was making a strong argument:
for the submarine at least the
lype of submarine capable of fir
ing a Polaris missile, 1,200-1,500
miles from the safely of the
ocean depths.

Not Enough for Safety
"I can't answer it yes or no,"
Burke said.
But a resounding "no" came
from the other side of Capitol Hill
where the chairman of the power
fid House Appropriations Com
mittee declared the United States
has forfeited control over land,
sea and air by spending too little
for defense.
But about the time Cannon was
cutting loose with his blast, Burke
was making a strong argument:
for the submarine at least the
lype of submarine capable of fir
ing a Polaris missile, 1,200-1,500
miles from the safely of the
ocean depths.
WASHINGTON (/I 1 ) The Navy, in a bid to build a missile
firing submarine fleet as soon as possible, will ask for 975 million
dollars to pay for six more of the craft than are currently planned.
Adm. Arleigh A. Burke, chief of naval operations, told this to a
Senate hearing yesterday, but he said he isn't sure the Defense De

partment will aprove the pro
posal.
Fifteen Now oil Way
If the request is relayed to Con
gross and passed there, the Po
laris submarine program would
be shoved forward by more than
a third. Al present 15 of the nu
clear-powered boats are on the
way, in one stage or' another.
Burke testified earlier that a
fleet of 45 such subs, equipped
with 16 missiles each to strike at
targets in the Soviet Union from
under the sea, would give the
United States a big enough re
taliatory force to keep the Soviets
at bay.
Burke Supports Ike
Questioned by Democratic sena
ators. Burke said he probably
would continue to support Presi
dent, Eisenhower 's budget even if
the President should turn down
the Navy's appeal for a stepup in
the Polaris program.
"If I didn't accept it, I wouldn't
remain in my present position,"
the Navy chief said.
Sen. Howard Cannon (D-Nov.)
pressed Burke for a yes or no
answer as to whether the adminis
tration defense budegt is "doing
enough to protect the safety and
security of this country at this
time."
