# Cannon: U.S. Power Forfeited
## 
### 
WASHINGTON </P) Th e
chairman of the powerful House
Appropriations Committee de
clared yesterday the United States
: has forfeited control over land,
| sea and air by spending too little
. for defense.
Appeal for Increase
Chairman Clarence Cannon (D-
Mo.), who usually holds tight to
I the government pursestring. ap
> pealed for an increase in Presi
' den I Eisenhower's 41-billion-doliar
military budget.
i And he threw his considerable
influence behind moves to triple
j the money sought by Eisenhower
to prepare for a constant airborne
vigil by U.S. bombers.
Subject lo Attack
"Every city in the United States
is subject to direct attack and our
! enemy has the weapons to launch
such an attack now," Cannon told
the House.
"By 1963 he will be able to de
i stroy every major city on the face
j of the earth."
Republicans sprang lo their feet
and accused Cannon of trying to
"scare the American people to
! death."
Psychological Weapon
Rep. John R. Rhodes (R-Ai i/.)
said statements like Cannon's
hand Russia a potential psycho
logical weapon and deepen the
| danger that the Communists
might spark war by misjudging
U.S. strength.
Cannon joined equally influen
tial Chairman Richard B. Russell
(D-Ga.) of the Senate Armed
Services Committee in supporting
more spending for defense. In a
Georgia speech, Russell said the
administration's military policy
"involves an unnecessary gamble
with world peace and our national
security."
Accuses Navy
In his House speech, Cannon
aimed harsh words at the Navy,
accusing "the admirals" of blind
ly. obstinately refusing to recog
nize that technological advances
j had promoted the submarine to
j supremacy as a naval weapon.
Cannon avoided naming the ad
j mirals he was attacking. But he
must have included Adm. Arleigh
A. Burke, Chief of Naval Opera
j lions and thus the top admiral of
them all.
