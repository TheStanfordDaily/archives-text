The surrender of the rebels who
had barricaded themselves in Al
giers is only a magnificent be
ginning. Gen. de Gaulle has
crushed the rebellion by exerting
his authority and by imposing his
discipline upon the Army.
Thus Ik* has proved to (lie
French nation, to the Mosclm
nationalists, and to all the
world that lie meant what he
said last September when he
promised self-determination in
Algeria. But in asking the
French National Assembly for
special powers, lie has made it
clear that the resistance to his
Algerian policy is wider and
greater than the rebellion he
hind the barricades in Algiers.
The surrender on Monday morn
ing did not mean that this resist
ance has been liquidated. II
meant, rather, that Gen. de Gaulle
has commit tod himself and the
overwhelming majority of Ihe
French nation to the hard and
painful task of overcoming this
resistance.
For behind the young zealots
who manned the barricades
there are very powerful eco
nomic, political, and military in
terests which are determined t<>
nullify Gen. de Gaulle's promise
of self-determination.
They intend to nullify this
promise because they believe that
genuine self-determination in Al
geria must mean that Algeria will
become an independent Moslem
state in which the European set
tlors will be a weak and harassed
minority.
The situation is one in which
this country lias a part to play.
Before Gen. de Gaulle defined
his policy last September we
were in a quandry. For when
we undertook to form a policy
in the United Nations and
among the Arab and African
governments with whom we
are in communication, what we
got from Paris was only a de
mand that we give them uncon
ditional support in a war which
we believed could not be won.
But after the General spoke in
September, Ihere existed a real
alternative to the cruel and incon
clusive war. We had then every I
reason to support his offer of
self-determination, and last Nov
vember in the United Nations we
made a mistake, il seems to me,
in not giving Franco our positive!
support.
Now, the case for positive
support is even clearer. Until
the uprising in Algiers, it could
he said with some reason that
the General's policy was verbal,
and that it had not yet been
tested against the French oppo
sition.

I We might begin by making it
j known that we do not regard
i Hie problem of Algeria as primar
ily thai of liquidating colonialism
land ending imperialism.
Algeria d it' fe r s decisively
from Indian and Pakistan, from
Burma and Ceylon, from Kgypl
and Syria and Iraq, from Tu
nisia and Morocco, from Ghana
and Guinea. The difference is
that the Kuropean population is
a settled community, and al
though it is in a minority of
one-to-eight, this is a very large
minority.
The problem of France in Al
geria is essentially and in prin
ciple the same problem that ihe
I British face in all the African ter
ritories where ihe white settlers
are a strongly established com
munity.
It is the problem of construct
ing and governing a plural so
ciety. When the different com
munities are sharply different
owning to religion, race, or the
level of their development—as
in Ireland, Palestine, and the
old British India —the problem
of the plural society has rarely
been solved.
Having made il know that the
problem does not fit into the tra
dilional patlern of colonialism
and imperialism, we should rec
ognize that Gen. de Gaulle is com
mitted to an experiment which
must be given every chance to
succeed.
Wo should use our good of
fices in Tunisia and .Morocco,
and in other countries which
have befriended the Algerian
Nationalists, to persuade them
that this is the time, which if
missed may never return, to
collaborate with Gen. de Gaulle
in order to end the war and to
prepare for the process of self
determination. After the events
of the past ten days, Gen. de
Gaulle lias proved his good
faith, and he lias earned the
right to be supported.
All this does not mean thai we
should show our support in any
ostentations and embarrassing
way. There should be no thought
of any kind of intervention. Nor
should wo have any illusions of
grandeur about the weight of our
influence in this part of the
world. We should be quiet.
But we should be clear. We
should be clear about making
it known to those w ho are really
concerned that our hesitations
and abstentions during the
autumn have been replaced by
a policy of positive support.

The surrender of the rebels who
had barricaded themselves in Al
giers is only a magnificent be
ginning. Gen. de Gaulle has
crushed the rebellion by exerting
his authority and by imposing his
discipline upon the Army.
Thus Ik* has proved to (lie
French nation, to the Mosclm
nationalists, and to all the
world that lie meant what he
said last September when he
promised self-determination in
Algeria. But in asking the
French National Assembly for
special powers, lie has made it
clear that the resistance to his
Algerian policy is wider and
greater than the rebellion he
hind the barricades in Algiers.
The surrender on Monday morn
ing did not mean that this resist
ance has been liquidated. II
meant, rather, that Gen. de Gaulle
has commit tod himself and the
overwhelming majority of Ihe
French nation to the hard and
painful task of overcoming this
resistance.
For behind the young zealots
who manned the barricades
there are very powerful eco
nomic, political, and military in
terests which are determined t<>
nullify Gen. de Gaulle's promise
of self-determination.
They intend to nullify this
promise because they believe that
genuine self-determination in Al
geria must mean that Algeria will
become an independent Moslem
state in which the European set
tlors will be a weak and harassed
minority.
The situation is one in which
this country lias a part to play.
Before Gen. de Gaulle defined
his policy last September we
were in a quandry. For when
we undertook to form a policy
in the United Nations and
among the Arab and African
governments with whom we
are in communication, what we
got from Paris was only a de
mand that we give them uncon
ditional support in a war which
we believed could not be won.
But after the General spoke in
September, Ihere existed a real
alternative to the cruel and incon
clusive war. We had then every I
reason to support his offer of
self-determination, and last Nov
vember in the United Nations we
made a mistake, il seems to me,
in not giving Franco our positive!
support.
Now, the case for positive
support is even clearer. Until
the uprising in Algiers, it could
he said with some reason that
the General's policy was verbal,
and that it had not yet been
tested against the French oppo
sition.

I We might begin by making it
j known that we do not regard
i Hie problem of Algeria as primar
ily thai of liquidating colonialism
land ending imperialism.
Algeria d it' fe r s decisively
from Indian and Pakistan, from
Burma and Ceylon, from Kgypl
and Syria and Iraq, from Tu
nisia and Morocco, from Ghana
and Guinea. The difference is
that the Kuropean population is
a settled community, and al
though it is in a minority of
one-to-eight, this is a very large
minority.
The problem of France in Al
geria is essentially and in prin
ciple the same problem that ihe
I British face in all the African ter
ritories where ihe white settlers
are a strongly established com
munity.
It is the problem of construct

mand that we give them uncon
ditional support in a war which
we believed could not be won.
But after the General spoke in
September, Ihere existed a real
alternative to the cruel and incon
clusive war. We had then every I
reason to support his offer of
self-determination, and last Nov
vember in the United Nations we
made a mistake, il seems to me,
in not giving Franco our positive!
support.
Now, the case for positive
support is even clearer. Until
the uprising in Algiers, it could
he said with some reason that
the General's policy was verbal,
and that it had not yet been
tested against the French oppo
sition.

I We might begin by making it
j known that we do not regard
i Hie problem of Algeria as primar
ily thai of liquidating colonialism
land ending imperialism.
Algeria d it' fe r s decisively
from Indian and Pakistan, from
Burma and Ceylon, from Kgypl
and Syria and Iraq, from Tu
nisia and Morocco, from Ghana
and Guinea. The difference is
that the Kuropean population is
a settled community, and al
though it is in a minority of
one-to-eight, this is a very large
minority.
The problem of France in Al
geria is essentially and in prin
ciple the same problem that ihe
I British face in all the African ter
ritories where ihe white settlers
are a strongly established com
munity.
It is the problem of construct
ing and governing a plural so
ciety. When the different com
munities are sharply different
owning to religion, race, or the
level of their development—as
in Ireland, Palestine, and the
old British India —the problem
of the plural society has rarely
been solved.
Having made il know that the
problem does not fit into the tra
dilional patlern of colonialism
and imperialism, we should rec
ognize that Gen. de Gaulle is com
mitted to an experiment which
must be given every chance to
succeed.
Wo should use our good of
fices in Tunisia and .Morocco,
and in other countries which
have befriended the Algerian
Nationalists, to persuade them
that this is the time, which if
missed may never return, to
collaborate with Gen. de Gaulle
in order to end the war and to
prepare for the process of self
determination. After the events
of the past ten days, Gen. de
Gaulle lias proved his good
faith, and he lias earned the
right to be supported.
All this does not mean thai we
should show our support in any
ostentations and embarrassing
way. There should be no thought
of any kind of intervention. Nor
should wo have any illusions of
grandeur about the weight of our
influence in this part of the
world. We should be quiet.
But we should be clear. We
should be clear about making
it known to those w ho are really
concerned that our hesitations
and abstentions during the
autumn have been replaced by
a policy of positive support.

The surrender of the rebels who
had barricaded themselves in Al
giers is only a magnificent be
ginning. Gen. de Gaulle has
crushed the rebellion by exerting
his authority and by imposing his
discipline upon the Army.
Thus Ik* has proved to (lie
French nation, to the Mosclm
nationalists, and to all the
world that lie meant what he
said last September when he
promised self-determination in
Algeria. But in asking the
French National Assembly for
special powers, lie has made it
clear that the resistance to his
Algerian policy is wider and
greater than the rebellion he
hind the barricades in Algiers.
The surrender on Monday morn
ing did not mean that this resist
ance has been liquidated. II
meant, rather, that Gen. de Gaulle
has commit tod himself and the
overwhelming majority of Ihe
French nation to the hard and
painful task of overcoming this
resistance.
For behind the young zealots
who manned the barricades
there are very powerful eco
nomic, political, and military in
terests which are determined t<>
nullify Gen. de Gaulle's promise
of self-determination.
They intend to nullify this
promise because they believe that
genuine self-determination in Al
geria must mean that Algeria will
become an independent Moslem
state in which the European set
tlors will be a weak and harassed
minority.
The situation is one in which
this country lias a part to play.
Before Gen. de Gaulle defined
his policy last September we
were in a quandry. For when
we undertook to form a policy
in the United Nations and
among the Arab and African
governments with whom we
are in communication, what we
got from Paris was only a de
mand that we give them uncon
ditional support in a war which
we believed could not be won.
