## 'Mouse That Roars' Based On Old Joke 
### 
What ever happened to the old
fashioned basis for movie plots?
You knowâ€”books, plays, orig
inal scenarios. Lately the movie
makers on two continents are us
ing remarkably ingenious inspira
tions for some of their movies.
For instance, songs. Witness
| "Rock Around the Clock," "Gid-
Igcl" and"The Legend of Tom
' Dooley" all movies whose only
! basis seem to bo in a song.
Now a new one has turned up:
| old jokes. The case in point is
; "The Mouse That Roared," an
English flick, currently breaking
up audiences at the Guild Theater
in Menlo Park.
Actually the movie was based
on a book by Leonard YVibberly,
about whom you can find out
more elsewhere on this page.
A Joke
Whether or not Wibberly did
! base his book on a joke or not
remains unanswered, but this is
; the way we heard it:
The Israeli parliament was hold
ing an emergency session to dis
j cuss its financial plight. One
j bright hoy said that the tiny
country should declare war on the
United States and when they lost
this country would take care of
them like we take care of all
countries we defeat. At this David
Ben Gurion killed the idea by say
j ing. "Yeah, but with our luck we'd
, win."
In case you are interested, the
movie remains faithful to the
joke. As the prime minister of
Grand Fenwick, the penniless
! country in the movie, says, "We
declare war on Monday, sur
render on Tuesday and by Fri
day we will be repatriated beyond
our wildest dreams."
The movie combines this satir
ical situation with some fine gag
lines arid situations, all of which
is calculated to keep the viewer
in a continual state of mirth.
Three Parts
The lead is played by Peter
Sellers who is perfect for this
very Guinessian role. He plays
three parts, thus not quite match
ing Guiness' feat in "Kind Hearts
and Coronets," but Ihe effect is
the same.
Actually the comparison can be
pursued farther since each part
that he plays (the milquetoast
who defeats Ihe U.S. in hand-to
hand combat, the haughty prime
minister and the grand duchess
of Ihe country) is done wilh a
change in manner which is high
ly reminiscent of the master.
Jean Seberg, still trying to over
come her disastrous appearance a
few years ago as Saint Joan, is
getting better and has finally
found a role in which she fits,
but fortunately for the movie her
part is a minor one.
