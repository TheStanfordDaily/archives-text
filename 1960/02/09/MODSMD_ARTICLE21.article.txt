# SEVEN ARTS
## An Unusual Author 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
The Sea Serpent reporter for
the Rocky Mountain News is now
a public figure.
And all because of a mouse that
roared.
Leonard Wibberly, red-beard
ed author of the movie that has
people rolling in the aisles of
the Guild Theater, used to he a
reporter for the Los Angeles
Times. It was there that "The
Mouse That Roared" made its
debut as "The Day Manhattcn
Was Invaded."
The story's next appearance
was as a six-part serial in the
Saturday Evening Post. Now it's
been published in both hard and
paperback.
Wibberly is an impressive
character-in his late id's. He
has a loud resonant voice, an
erect carriage and a forthright
and uninhibited manner.
He hates prigs, stuffed shirts
and blue noses. He can commonly
be seen (if one happens to see
him at Hermosa Beach where ho
lives) wearing a green corduoroy
sports coat and sandals.
Married twice, lie lias seven
children. He traveled through
Europe with four of them and
bis pregnant wife. The fifth
child was born in Portugal, the
sixth in Santa Monica.
Wibberly says he must write
six books a year, under different
names, to earn a living. As a writ
er he is a satirist and a mystic.
He hates the hyprocrisies of mod
ern man.
"Excaliber" and"The Mouse
That Roared" are a reverse of
"A Connecticut Yankee in King
Arthur's Court." Arthur is in
the modern world to show up
its absurdities.

Born in Dublin. Ireland, Wib
berly, like most litery Irishmen,
is very anti-British. He is still an
Irish citizen, and he is still light
ing the Rebellion.
During part of World War li,
lie lived in Trinidad and with a
partner went into the shipping
business there. They ms<ml to
take turns captaining their ship.
It was submarined when the
other fellow was on it.
Wibberly has a great /est for
life. He thinks that people should
be decent, leave each other alone
and learn to have a good time
together.
About movies Wibberlye feels
that Hollywood errs in stress
ing romantic interest. Romance
is merely a safety factor for the
producer's investment.
"Producers are finding out,
however, that having something
to say is becoming more import
ant. This was the case several
decades ago. For quite a while the
movies shifted to sheer entertain
ment appeal, but now we're see
ing a revival in serious films.
"We're witnessing a huge
raising of the mental factor.
More people are going to col
lege and the calibre of the audi
ence is maturing."
