Lunatic Left
Krtitor, The Daily:
Regarding the loyalty oath-dis
claimer affidavit controversy,
this comes to my mind: 33,000
Americans died fighting commu
nism in Korea. Why should we
coddle it at home today? . . .
Alter all the semantical ex
ercises (principles, rights, etc. . . .
right to overthrow the govern
ment, maybe?) of the campus
anti-affidavit boys (and one won
ders just who put them up to it
and supplied ihem with their
language and arguments), these
I positive results remain to he got
I from the affidavit:
1. It serves, along with the oath,
j as a means of ritualistic re-af
firmation of our duties as Ameri
can citizens (one can conclude
, the academicians, of all groups,
need such re-afl'irmation).
2. Despite the opponents' argu
ments, it is going to help prevent
| communists and their sympathiz
ers from getting NDEA funds be
cause 3, it can open the door for
perjury prosecution of many who
can't be touched by the .Smith Act
(similar to the Hiss case).
Twenty years ago it was the
screwball Right; let's not relax
our efforts against the lunatic
Left of today.

Common Sense?
Kriitor, 'I'll*' Daily:
Shock and, Indeed, mystifica
tion; such is my reaction to the
petition for "broad student ac
tion" against the disclaimer affi
davit . . .
Do the "basic freedoms" al
luded to in the official exposition
of the petition by Scotty Thomp
son include a right to believe and
participate in the destruction of
whatever freedoms we, as Amer
icans might now enjoy, and to re
ceive federal scholarship aid to
boot ?
No one is being told "what to
believe" by Congress. The affi
davit involves simply eligibility to
the bursary aid made available to
assist the education of our future
leaders.
With this in mind and unal
loyed to farm subsidies and other
grants, . . . Congress decided not
to subsidize Communists.
This might be McCarthyism, or
it might be common sense.
