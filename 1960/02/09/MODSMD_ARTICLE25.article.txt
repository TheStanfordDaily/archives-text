A Basketball Player Lost
Once again it's time to look back at the weekend sports activities
around the Bay. Here at Stanford some bad news broke Thursday
when it was known that Tribe eager Jerry Thiiesen re-injured his
knee unci will have to undergo surgery and possibly never again
play basketball. Jerry, a good sixth man on the Stanford team,
certainly was destined to see a lot of action this year and it is a
shame after three years of hard work the tall forward will be out
a chance to really prove himself as one of Stanford's greatest basket
ball shots.
Many sports experts agreed that Thuesen's soft jumper had the
touch of ex-Tribe All-American Hank I nisetti behind it. Jerry's prob
lem was always minor injuries which would slow up his development
'til this year only to have his last opportunity go out when his
knee did.
Elsewhere around the Bay was the controversial hiring of New

.Mexico's Marv Levy as Californ
ia's football coach. It raised a
bit of commotion to say the least.
A bit of moving around was in
order and finally the popular
Bay Area sports writers includ
ing tho Chronicle's Bill Leiser,
who was mad because his paper
couldn't choose the coach were
all up in arms about his selection
with no one really coming out for
Levy. Even Mrs. Cevy was very
"giddy" about the whole thing.
This mass exodus started with
Pete Elliott to Illinois, closely fol
lowed by his faithful companion
and assistant Dee Andros. and
finally prep star and later Cal
frosh quarterback Dennis Sliay
showed up mysteriously at Illi
nois. Of course this brought on
the usual cry of pirating and
thievery against popular Pete and
apparently the City sportswriters
still need more copy material so
they are trying to fan a feud. Of
course we all hope that the visit
ing Levy has a football team to

work with next fall because we always enjoy watching the Bears in
the Big Game.
However to City sportwriters and Cal fans alike . . . One ques
tion: you kept hollering for a coach for so long, now that you
have one why not let him get to Berkeley, at least, before he is
hanged in effigy???
<;<> Away Rain
Back on the good side of the Bay we find that Old Man Winter
is certainly raising havoc with all the spring sports here on
The Farm. Pity the poor baseball coaches Dutch Feliring and
Mickey Ilol/man who have had only one practice outside this
quarter and their first game is less than two weeks away. The
trackmen also can't be expected to go out in our miserable Californ
ia liquid sunshine. Certainly the tennis team can't practice and the
netters are hurting equally bad because their Northern California
meet comes up soon this quarter.
The coaches haven't been sitting around inside moaning about
the weather entirely however. Ilol/man announced that a freshman
baseball league is in the making with the Bay Area and possibly
the CIBA school included which will give players, fans and coaches
alike a chance to see how the frosh diamondeers square up against
the rest of the freshmen. In the past, ihe frosh have been limited
to mainly games with surrounding high school teams with an oc
casional J.C. or Cal or San Jose game thrown in.

Another item in the news concerns the Stanford Athletic Assoc
iation Dance, Saturday night after the USC basketball game. Presi
dent Jim Bnrk announced that a special added attraction will be
featured at the dance John "Big Devil" Windsor, of Card cage
lame will be on hand to disc jocky the show.
Windsor is famous in his Kansas City home town area and also
may bo heard Thursday night taking Marty Mandles' spot on KZSU
at 6:45 to 7:30. Bnrk promised that Windsor will feature some of
his Kansas City style recordings—a la Joe Turner and should put
on quite a show. Another disc jock makes good, as Bnrk phrased it.
Sounds like a dance no one should miss.

Many sports experts agreed that Thuesen's soft jumper had the
touch of ex-Tribe All-American Hank I nisetti behind it. Jerry's prob
lem was always minor injuries which would slow up his development
'til this year only to have his last opportunity go out when his
knee did.
Elsewhere around the Bay was the controversial hiring of New

.Mexico's Marv Levy as Californ
ia's football coach. It raised a
bit of commotion to say the least.
A bit of moving around was in
order and finally the popular
Bay Area sports writers includ
ing tho Chronicle's Bill Leiser,
who was mad because his paper
couldn't choose the coach were
all up in arms about his selection
with no one really coming out for
Levy. Even Mrs. Cevy was very
"giddy" about the whole thing.
This mass exodus started with
Pete Elliott to Illinois, closely fol
lowed by his faithful companion
and assistant Dee Andros. and
finally prep star and later Cal
frosh quarterback Dennis Sliay
showed up mysteriously at Illi
nois. Of course this brought on
the usual cry of pirating and
thievery against popular Pete and
apparently the City sportswriters
still need more copy material so
they are trying to fan a feud. Of
course we all hope that the visit
ing Levy has a football team to

work with next fall because we always enjoy watching the Bears in
the Big Game.
However to City sportwriters and Cal fans alike . . . One ques
tion: you kept hollering for a coach for so long, now that you
have one why not let him get to Berkeley, at least, before he is
hanged in effigy???
<;<> Away Rain
Back on the good side of the Bay we find that Old Man Winter
is certainly raising havoc with all the spring sports here on
The Farm. Pity the poor baseball coaches Dutch Feliring and
Mickey Ilol/man who have had only one practice outside this
quarter and their first game is less than two weeks away. The
trackmen also can't be expected to go out in our miserable Californ
ia liquid sunshine. Certainly the tennis team can't practice and the
netters are hurting equally bad because their Northern California
meet comes up soon this quarter.
The coaches haven't been sitting around inside moaning about
the weather entirely however. Ilol/man announced that a freshman
baseball league is in the making with the Bay Area and possibly
the CIBA school included which will give players, fans and coaches
alike a chance to see how the frosh diamondeers square up against
the rest of the freshmen. In the past, ihe frosh have been limited
to mainly games with surrounding high school teams with an oc
casional J.C. or Cal or San Jose game thrown in.

Another item in the news concerns the Stanford Athletic Assoc
iation Dance, Saturday night after the USC basketball game. Presi
dent Jim Bnrk announced that a special added attraction will be
featured at the dance John "Big Devil" Windsor, of Card cage
lame will be on hand to disc jocky the show.
Windsor is famous in his Kansas City home town area and also
may bo heard Thursday night taking Marty Mandles' spot on KZSU
at 6:45 to 7:30. Bnrk promised that Windsor will feature some of
his Kansas City style recordings—a la Joe Turner and should put
on quite a show. Another disc jock makes good, as Bnrk phrased it.
Sounds like a dance no one should miss.

Once again it's time to look back at the weekend sports activities
around the Bay. Here at Stanford some bad news broke Thursday
when it was known that Tribe eager Jerry Thiiesen re-injured his
knee unci will have to undergo surgery and possibly never again
play basketball. Jerry, a good sixth man on the Stanford team,
certainly was destined to see a lot of action this year and it is a
shame after three years of hard work the tall forward will be out
a chance to really prove himself as one of Stanford's greatest basket
ball shots.
