# RUGGED COMPETITION SEEN
## Swim Team Strengthened Daily Sports 
### Rich Walker 
Improved competition, not a
poorer Stanford team, is expected
to be the key to the local swim
scene for the 19(><) season as the
Indians prepare for their short,
but rugged schedule. For despite
additional strength in the breast
stroke and butterfly events, the
Indians will he hard-pressed when
they meet SC in the new Californ
ia All-Comers Meet.
The brief season in which Stan
ford will participate in only four
dual meets, beginning Friday
with the SC meet, was explained
by Coach Tom Haynie thus:
"When you have a poor team,
even the high schools will swim
you, but come up with a series of
winning seasons and you can't
buy a meet. SC is having the
same problem."
Indians Unbeatable
In the breaststroke, however,
the Indians will lie unbeatable.
Based on performance so far this
year, top man in this department
will be junior Jim Cooper, who
placed second in the PCC last
year in both the 100 and 200 yard
events. Cooper's main competi
tion will come from last year's
PCC dual event breaststroke
champion, Stanford's Tom Peter
son.
Adding depth to the breast
stroke squad is sophomore Paul
Hait, who is presently recovering
from a slipped disc.
George Harrison is expected to
top last year's great performance
by becoming the number one
American U.S. Citizen swimmer
in the 440 yard and 1500 meter
free-style. Last year Harrison took
fourth in the NCAA 200 yard
butterfly and won the 200 yard
individual medley in 2:06.7, set
ting a new American, NCAA, and
meet record for the event.
Jurgensen Outstanding
Also outstanding in the butter
fly and free-style events is junior
John Jurgensen, who placed fifth
in the NCAA 100 yard butterfly.
In last year's PCC meet he took
second in the 200 yard individual
medley behind Harrison, won the
100 yard butterfly and placed
fifth in the 50 free-style.
Junior Mike Zcller, one of the
country's top free-stylers took a
third in the NCAA meet for Stan
ford in the 220. Zeller's PCC rec
ord last year gives him thirds
in the 50 and 220 and a timely
second in Ihe 100.
Top exclusive butterflier on the
team is expected to be team cap
tain Tim Timken who took third
in the 200 and second in the 100
fly last year in the PCC meet.
Although juniors and seniors

appear to dominate the club,,
sophomore Jim Lewis, a transfer
from Santa Monica JC. is ex- i
pected to give a good account of
himself in the 440 free-style and
200 fly this year. He set records 1
in both these events last year at
Santa Monica.
Diving chores will be taken ;
over by juniors Steve Jackson
and Pete Barnhisel. The latter
took two fourths in last year's !
PCC meet, while Jackson added a
sixth in the one meter event.

in the 200 and second in the 100
fly last year in the PCC meet.
Although juniors and seniors

appear to dominate the club,,
sophomore Jim Lewis, a transfer
from Santa Monica JC. is ex- i
pected to give a good account of
himself in the 440 free-style and
200 fly this year. He set records 1
in both these events last year at
Santa Monica.
Diving chores will be taken ;
over by juniors Steve Jackson
and Pete Barnhisel. The latter
took two fourths in last year's !
PCC meet, while Jackson added a
sixth in the one meter event.


TIM TIMKEN, COACH HAYNIE, TOM PETERSON
Plan Card swim strategy
Improved competition, not a
poorer Stanford team, is expected
to be the key to the local swim
scene for the 19(><) season as the
Indians prepare for their short,
but rugged schedule. For despite
additional strength in the breast
stroke and butterfly events, the
Indians will he hard-pressed when
they meet SC in the new Californ
ia All-Comers Meet.
The brief season in which Stan
ford will participate in only four
dual meets, beginning Friday
with the SC meet, was explained
by Coach Tom Haynie thus:
"When you have a poor team,
even the high schools will swim
you, but come up with a series of
winning seasons and you can't
buy a meet. SC is having the
same problem."
Indians Unbeatable
In the breaststroke, however,
the Indians will lie unbeatable.
Based on performance so far this
year, top man in this department
will be junior Jim Cooper, who
placed second in the PCC last
year in both the 100 and 200 yard
events. Cooper's main competi
tion will come from last year's
PCC dual event breaststroke
champion, Stanford's Tom Peter
son.
Adding depth to the breast
stroke squad is sophomore Paul
Hait, who is presently recovering
from a slipped disc.
George Harrison is expected to
top last year's great performance
by becoming the number one
American U.S. Citizen swimmer
in the 440 yard and 1500 meter
free-style. Last year Harrison took
fourth in the NCAA 200 yard
butterfly and won the 200 yard
individual medley in 2:06.7, set
ting a new American, NCAA, and
meet record for the event.
Jurgensen Outstanding
Also outstanding in the butter
fly and free-style events is junior
John Jurgensen, who placed fifth
in the NCAA 100 yard butterfly.
In last year's PCC meet he took
second in the 200 yard individual
medley behind Harrison, won the
100 yard butterfly and placed
fifth in the 50 free-style.
Junior Mike Zcller, one of the
country's top free-stylers took a
third in the NCAA meet for Stan
ford in the 220. Zeller's PCC rec
ord last year gives him thirds
in the 50 and 220 and a timely
second in Ihe 100.
Top exclusive butterflier on the
team is expected to be team cap
tain Tim Timken who took third
in the 200 and second in the 100
fly last year in the PCC meet.
