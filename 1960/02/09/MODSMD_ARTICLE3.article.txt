Professor Harold C. Urey, No
bel Prize winner in chemistry,
will discuss some of the chemical
problems relative to the origin of
the solar system tomorrow night
at 7:30 in Memorial Auditorium.
Urey, one of America's most
distinguished scientists, is cur
rently "professor al large in
chemistry" at the University of
California. He is noted for his
discovery of deuterium, a hydro
gen isotope also known as "heavy
hydrogen."
He was educated at the Uni
versity of Montana and received
his doctorate from UC. His work
in chemistry, especially in atomic
structure and the origin of the
earth, has made him world re
nowned.
Urey is the author of "The
Planets" an d co- a u I ho r of
"Atoms, Molecules, and Quanta."
His many honors include the Wil
liard Gibbs, Davy, and Franklin
medals and the President's Medal
of Merit, which he won for his
