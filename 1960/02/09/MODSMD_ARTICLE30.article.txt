## 
### 
The Stanford wrestling team
will be looking for its second
victory of the season and a repeat
of lasf year's great team win as
they meet the California Bears
tonight at 7:30 in the Encina
Gym.
Three Stanford wrestlers, Skip
Pew, heavyweight, Tom Snoke,
123 pounder, and Phil Murphy,
157 pounder, all have shown im
provement since their first out
ing and could give the locals an
edge, hut Card mentor Jack Me-
Kenna says it will take an all-out
team effort to defeat the Bears.
For the first time this season,
Stanford's Pew will not have to
give up a weight advantage to his
opponent, for Barry Davidson,
California's heavyweight, is not
too big.
Dick Denny will meet Cal's
Dick Rice in a featured 1(57 pound
match. Rice lacks experience but
may give Denny a good battle.
At 177, Stanford's Frank Redle
meets Bear Bert Hoffman. Hoff
man is strong, but doesn't have
the experience or speed of Redle.
At 157, Stanford will pit Phil
Murphy against A 1 Cunningham.
Cunningham is a top notch wrest
ler, and transferred to Cal this
year from Fresno Junior College.
Card Pete Barnhisel tangles
with Rich Marehado at 117. and
Lee Stephenson will wrestle Bob
Fescura of Cal in a 137 pound
bout.
In the lightweight divisions it
will be the Snoke brothers, Art
and Tom, doing the chores for

the Indians. Tom will fight Toby
Burnett at 123, and Art battles
Phil LaForce at 130.
