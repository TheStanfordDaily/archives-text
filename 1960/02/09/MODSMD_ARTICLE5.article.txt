# Soviet 'Nastiness' Anticipated

### 
BONN, Germany </P) West
ern officials said Monday they
expect the Soviet Union to grow
"noisier and nastier" in dealing
with the Berlin problem between
now and the summit meeting May
16.
Adenauer Target
These officials said the Soviets
are likely to aim increasingly
heavy verbal lire at German
Chanellor Konrad Adenauer. He
has been a prime Communist tar
get for the past month or so and
there is little sign of a letup.
Adenauer has been pictured as
a warmonger, the architect of the
cold war, and a villain fighting
efforts to bring harmony between
East and West.
Little Effect
So far this campaign by the
Soviet Union and Communist
East Germany appears to have
done little more than stiffen the
Western stand against conces
sions on Berlin.
President Eisenhower last week
told a news conference a grave
situation would exist if the So
viets were to try to limit Western
occupation rights in Berlin. The
Eisenhower state m on t was
cheered by political circles in
Bonn.
West Germans Agree
Adenauer, the Christian Demo
crat leader, has been working in
recent months to create a solid
front with Willy Brandt, the So
cialist mayor of West Berlin.
After a series of conferences, they
announced they were in perfect
agreement on a tough Western
position on Berlin.
Both parties strongly oppose
negotiations between West Ger
many and the East German re
gime.
