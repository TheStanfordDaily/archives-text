# Medieval Touch
## 
### 
The ih>\v Post Oi l ice opened today, complete with outside boxes,
new equipment, increased floor space, and moat. Students had
been duly prepared tor most of these modern conveniences, but
the last atmospheric touch came as an unexpected surprise.
Hundreds of students wended their way across the soggy narrow
bridge to the new structure for the first look in their boxes. First
impressions were favorable, though one would think that if we
go to all the trouble to buy a box someone could at least send
us some mail.
