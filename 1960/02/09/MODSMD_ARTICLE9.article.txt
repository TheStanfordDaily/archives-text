Winding up his toast. Khrush
chev suggested Gronehi become a
Communist.
"Ours is the most democratic
of all democratic regimes,"
Khrushchev said. "Under the cap
italistic regime, the man who has
more dollars is the most intelli
gent. Under the Socialist regime,
he is the most intelligent who
has more intelligence. Think
again on this and you'll become a
Communist.
The toast finished, Khrushchev
turned to Pella, saying:
"I asked the president to be

come a Communist, but I was
thinking of you too."
Pella replied: "It would be very
difficult for the president lo ac
cept your proposal."
Khrushchev: "But I always pro
pose difficult problems. And
moreover, I don't make proposals.
I invite you. I attract you. I
accept you and I wish you all the
best."
Gronchi: "I would like to pre
sent Premier Khrushchev with a
good wish. Maybe some day,
touched by divine grace, he will
enter the Christian Democrat
party."
Oilier (iiH'sts Listen

official started to intervene.
"I understand," Khrushchev
said as he motioned to the offi
cial, "the diplomats try to get
into the picture to detract us from
a dispute. They are doing their
job."

ROME (.4 1 ) -An Italian news agency reported Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev yesterday urged Italian President Giovanni Gron
chi to become a Communist and remain in the Soviet Union.
"Don't lose your time, don't go back and don't be preoccupied by
a question of political party," Khrushchev was quoted as telling

Gronehi.
The affair, as reported in a
Moscow dispatch carried by the
Italian news agency, Ansa, came
after toasts at an Italian Embassy
luncheon given by Gronehi for
Khrushchev and Soviet President
Klementi Voroshilov. Italian
newsmen in Moscow have been
reporting the visit there of Gron
ehi and Italian Foreign Minister
Giuseppe Pella without censor
ship.
Moscow-based Associated Press
correspondents reported th e i r
story of the luncheon was held
up by censorship.
Khrushchev Makes Suggestion
Ansa gave this account:
Winding up his toast. Khrush
chev suggested Gronehi become a
Communist.
"Ours is the most democratic
of all democratic regimes,"
Khrushchev said. "Under the cap
italistic regime, the man who has
more dollars is the most intelli
gent. Under the Socialist regime,
he is the most intelligent who
has more intelligence. Think
again on this and you'll become a
Communist.
