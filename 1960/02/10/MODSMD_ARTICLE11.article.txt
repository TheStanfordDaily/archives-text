# Twining Opposes Polaris Program
## Claims Present Sub Plans Supply Sufficient Defense 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — The nation's top military chief yesterday
opposed the Navy's now proposal to thrust the Polaris program
forward by building six more of the missile-firing submarines than
present plans allow.
At present 15 of the nuclear powered subs are on the way from

the paper work stage to com
pletion.
Gen. Nathan F. Twining, chair
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
rejected the plan only a day after
that proposal was disclosed by
Adm. Arleigh A. Burke, chief of
naval operations -and from the
same forum, a hearing of the Sen
ate Space Committee and Pre
paredness subcommittee.
Twining- Wants to Wait
Obviously not sold by advocates
of a big fleet of missile-launchers,
Twining endorsed the current
plan to build about three Polaris
boats a year.
"We should go along just about
as we are until we find out more
about it," Twining said of the
Polaris, an intermediate range
missile still in the test stage but
approaching combat readiness.
In rejecting pet projects of
some of his close associates,
Twining put on a stout defense of
Eisenhower's 41-billion-dollar de
fense budget.
Polaris Subs Invulnerable
Appearing before the Senate
groups Monday, A d m . Bur k e
claimed the Polaris subs will be
invulnerable weapons, able to deal
nuclear destruction to Soviet tar
gets from beneath ihe sea, up to
.1,500 miles away. The Navy chief
said 45 such craft would pack
enough firepower to destroy the
Soviet Union.
Sen. Norris Cotton (R-N.H.)
came to Burke's support, urging
President Eisenhower to accept
the admiral's proposal to spend
another $975 million to build six
additional Polaris subs.
"If you want terrific striking
power at minimum cost—this is
it," Cotton said in a speech for
the Senate.
Disagreed with Power
Under questioning T w in in g
testified he doesn't go along with
Gen. Thomas S. Power's view
that Power's force of long range
bombers should be put on 24-hour
airborne alert as soon as possible,
and that more money should be
spent now to get ready.
Twining contended the impor
tant thing is to be capable, of
mounting such an alert, if and
when a need arises. "What's in
the budget will take care of that,"
he said.
