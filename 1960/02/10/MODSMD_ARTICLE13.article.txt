# SOLAR SYSTEM
## Urey Says 4Â½ Billion Years Old 
### Ross Hermann 
Harold C. Urey, Nobel Prize
winning chemist, said last night
that the solar system may have
been formed about four and a
half billion years ago.
This belief was advanced as a
part of a general theory in the
fifth of the Tuesday Evening
Series entitled, "Some Chemical
Problems Relative to the Origin
of the Solar System."
The approximate date which
Urey presented was determined
thro u g h the argon-potassium
process of dating meteorites
found on the earth. The great
extent of the activity which
occurred at that time can be
presumed, according to Urey, to
mark the major events in the
formation of the solar system.
As the starting point for his
theory, Urey envisioned a solar
nebula, surrounded by a disk of
dust and gas. From the dust, ob
jects the size of the moon were
formed.
As the dissipation of gases con
tinued, the objects began to wob
ble in their courses and eventu
ally collided. Smaller objects may
have resulted from the collision
which eventually combined to
form the present planets.
Urey emphasized that no
smooth theory will ever be satis
factory because nature always
has a way of exceeding man's
capabilities.
