# Chappie Day Here Again!

The Chappie has threatened to
publish only seven times this year
and No. 4 comes out today — a
rank, "over-the-hump" issue if
ever I saw one. They have puffed
it up to 40 pages by putting in
as much stuff from other college
humor mags as they can, scroung
ing up lots of advertising and
inserting some skimpy satire of
those defenders of law, order and
40-minute parking spaces, the
Stanford Police Deparament.
The first attempt at prose and
photographic humor is "I Was
an Agent for the ABC." This,
like a hand with 13 spades, sort
of plays itself, right down to the
ending where the hero is won
over to the side of right, integrity
and alcohol.
The magazine ends with a
whimper as the Chappie presents
a "Hate-Cops Kit."
