# Lack of Space
## 
### 
Several incidents have recently occurred in the stacks at the
Main Library which, if repeated, nun result in the termination of
stack privileges for undergraduates.
Ihese incidents have arisen when students silting at tables in
the stacks have refused to leave when requested to do so l>\ faculty
members and graduates for whom the tables were reserved, thus
causing a disturbance.
The library director has explained that the I 1.1 tables are re
served at the beginning of each quarter for faculty and doctoral
and master candidates working on theses, who request and need
the space.
Students arc allowed to use the tables except when lliey are
needed by those persons to whom the\ have been given. These
graduate students and faculty members have the right to use the
tables whenever the\ wish, and other students are expected to relin
quish the space when asked.
It would be a great misfortune if the stacks had to be closed
to undergraduates because of a few people who either did not
know the rules about the tables or who were not considerate
enough to respect them.
Stanford should be proud of the fact that it is one of the few
universities having no undergraduate library that keep their main
stack open to students, and the advantages of such an arrangement
are evident.
However, the heart of lliis problem of tables lies in the lack of
available study space in the library.
The seriousness of this deficiency can be seen partieularl\
during periods of midterms and finals when all the places in the
library are taken and people are even silting on the floors and
steps in the stacks.
And during other times in the quarter, even if the library is
not completely filled, the three large rooms are not as conducive
to studying as are the stacks or as would he smaller areas.
In addition there are about I") carrels or small cubicles for
doctoral candidates in the entire librarv. and undergraduate stu
dents have no such facilities.
Although the students responsible for the recent incidents can
not be exempted from blame, the problem of lack of space will
not be rectified until better and larger facilities are pro\ided in a
new undergraduate librar\.
