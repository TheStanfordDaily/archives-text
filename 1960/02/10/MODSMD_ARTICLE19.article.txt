# 'DISCIPLE'
## Shaw's Play Has Moral Directness 
### 
Compared to so many modern
plays of energy without purpose,
Bernard Shaw's moral directness
becomes even more admirable.
"The Devil's Disciple," cur
rently playing at the Actors'
Workshop in San Francisco, is
no exception.
The play is set in the Puritan
colonies during the Civil War. It
is constructed with vigor and
variety and is one of Shaw's
most humorous.
But at the heart of all Shaw's
plays is a serious situation of
choice. The line of action reveals
the contrast between the hero
who sees only the course of sac
rifice which will result in his own
death and the man of practical
purpose who preserves life.
Hypocrisy
Dick Dudgeon, or the Devil's
Disciple who turns his unrelent
ing honesty on the hypocrisy of
religion, is played by Tom Rosqui
with all the expansive humor and
generosity of the character.
Joseph Miksak is quite good as
Reverend Anderson, who proves
to himself that he should be a
soldier instead of a parson and
proves to Dudgeon that practi
cality is better than death.
Myra Alexander Gilbert as
Dudgeon's mother and Robert
Symonds as General Burgone are
especially effective.
Stereotypes
The weaker members of the
cast are Robert Doyle as Christy
Dudgeon and Priscilla Pointer as
Mrs. Anderson who often seem
to ho playing stereotypes instead
of Shaw's types. But all the minor
roles of the town's people and
soldiers are extremely well done.
The sets and c os t u m e s are
simple but handsome. The block
ing patterns are natural yet
always well proportioned.
Director William Ball has cre
ated a unified and thoroughly de
lighifill show.
