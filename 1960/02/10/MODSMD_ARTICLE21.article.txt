The rains persist, the winds
howl, midterms continue, papers
fall due and Valentine's Day
draws near. The first can hardly
be considered commemoration
worthy. The last, however, often
calls for something special.
Something special, that is, in
the way of Valentine candy, flow
ers or cards. Why not something
special in the way of entertain
ment ?

suggestion — Sir Thomas Bee
chain guest-conducts the San
Francisco Symphony in a spe
cial matinee "Lollipops" concert
at 3 p.m. Sunday at the Opera
House.
The 80-year-old conductor uses
the term "Lollipops" to describe
the encore pieces he bestows upon
his audience after a concert, and
which he likens to "a species of
sweetmeat."
These "Lollipops," which are
usually light and soothing, to
contrast with the "grand bang
or explosion of sound" which
often marks the end of a concert,
were so well received that Sir
Thomas gathered a few into the
special "Lollipops Concert."
Between numbers, Sir Thomas,
who is famous for being both
witty and outspoken, will give
running commentaries on the
music. Tickets are available at
Sherman Clay and all Bay Area
agencies.
Valentine's Day over, enter
tainment specials will continue.

For another Valentine's Day
suggestion — Sir Thomas Bee
chain guest-conducts the San
Francisco Symphony in a spe
cial matinee "Lollipops" concert
at 3 p.m. Sunday at the Opera
House.
The 80-year-old conductor uses
the term "Lollipops" to describe
the encore pieces he bestows upon
his audience after a concert, and
which he likens to "a species of
sweetmeat."
These "Lollipops," which are
usually light and soothing, to
contrast with the "grand bang
or explosion of sound" which
often marks the end of a concert,
were so well received that Sir
Thomas gathered a few into the
special "Lollipops Concert."
Between numbers, Sir Thomas,
who is famous for being both
witty and outspoken, will give
running commentaries on the
music. Tickets are available at
Sherman Clay and all Bay Area
agencies.
Valentine's Day over, enter
tainment specials will continue.
Coming direct from 11 months
on Broadway, Geraldine Page
and Sidney Blackmer will open

atre in San Francisco.
And the Moscow State Sym
phony Orchestra, on its first
American tour, will appear in
two special concerts at the Civic
Auditorium on Saturday, Feb. 20,
and Sunday, Feb. 21.
The rains persist, the winds
howl, midterms continue, papers
fall due and Valentine's Day
draws near. The first can hardly
be considered commemoration
worthy. The last, however, often
calls for something special.
Something special, that is, in
the way of Valentine candy, flow
ers or cards. Why not something
special in the way of entertain
ment ?

swingin' concert garnished with
spectacular operatic' overtones.

town Center Box Office.
Opening today at the San Fran
cisco Museum of Art is "20th
Century Design: U.5.A.," the

For another Valentine's Day
suggestion — Sir Thomas Bee
chain guest-conducts the San
Francisco Symphony in a spe
cial matinee "Lollipops" concert
at 3 p.m. Sunday at the Opera
House.
The 80-year-old conductor uses
the term "Lollipops" to describe
the encore pieces he bestows upon
his audience after a concert, and
which he likens to "a species of
sweetmeat."
These "Lollipops," which are
usually light and soothing, to
contrast with the "grand bang
or explosion of sound" which
often marks the end of a concert,
were so well received that Sir
Thomas gathered a few into the
special "Lollipops Concert."
Between numbers, Sir Thomas,
who is famous for being both
witty and outspoken, will give
running commentaries on the
music. Tickets are available at
Sherman Clay and all Bay Area
agencies.
Valentine's Day over, enter
tainment specials will continue.
Coming direct from 11 months
on Broadway, Geraldine Page
and Sidney Blackmer will open

And the Moscow State Sym
phony Orchestra, on its first
American tour, will appear in
two special concerts at the Civic
Auditorium on Saturday, Feb. 20,
and Sunday, Feb. 21.
The rains persist, the winds
howl, midterms continue, papers
fall due and Valentine's Day
draws near. The first can hardly
be considered commemoration
worthy. The last, however, often
calls for something special.
Something special, that is, in
the way of Valentine candy, flow
ers or cards. Why not something
special in the way of entertain
ment ?
