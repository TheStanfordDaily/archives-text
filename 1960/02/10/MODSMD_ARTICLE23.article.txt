Indulgence
Editor, The Daily:
The editorial in Monday's Daily
voices two criticisms of the Win
ter Drive.
First, that social pressure and
quotas were used to secure do
nations.
Second, that the donations do
not result in immediate and con
crete benefits to ourselves.
The Daily suggests that the
reduction of pressure methods
and the selection of a charity
more direclly beneficial to the
University would result in more
generous giving.
We, the undersigned, agree
with the first proposal.
As to the second, we cannot
conceive that charity which de
mands tangible benefits for the
contributors could be in any sense
described as generous giving.
The perspective which consid
ers only Iho improvement of ils
ivory-tower community is narrow.
Students and faculty are mem
bers of a community larger than
the University, the needs of which
are greater and more basic than
the indulgence of establishing a
record library.
