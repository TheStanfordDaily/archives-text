Kriitor, The Daily:
The letter by Lawrence Shumm ;
is surprising as well as disgust
ing. Surprising because of the
confidence in his judgement, dis
gusting because of the incon
ceivable hate, which speaks out
of it.
As it is hard to answer this
letter as a German without speak
ing "pro domo," I am reproducing
part of an article, written by Dr.
Hendnk van Dam, the most prom
inent representative of the Jews
in Germany and published in the
last issue of "DIP" ZEIT." His
article deals with the recent anti
semitic events and among othei
things he writes: "
"Two assumptions are wrong
in any case.
"One is the assumption, tha
West German reaction, based on
the satiation of prosperity, is
completely passive, that there is
indifference to the course things
may take and that West Germans
are satisfied merely to trust the
reliability of tlie police.
"The seewnd assumption, which
is at least as false, is probably
'even dangerous.
"It is inherent in the prejudiced
attitude of some observers, who,
under all circumstances, want to
have confirmed whal they think
of the Germans collectively, or
those democratic defeatists, who,
in an almost morbid addiction to !
;i state of panic, consider it inevi
table that there will be a repeti
tion of January 30, 1933."
So far Dr. Hendrik van Dam.
I myself want to say that we
Germans can not undo what has

been done in these inferior 13
years by us in our country. All
we can do is to be seriously
ashamed of what happened and
to do the best and most we can
to make amends.
So we pay reparations up to
any amount calculated by Israel
and another Jewish Committee,
although we know that money
never ran repair the wrong done
by Nazism.
Shumm asserts that the Ger
man people wanted to get an
irmy again and that this return
of the army is comparable to a
comeback of Nazism.
Neithei is true. II a referendum
had been made on the question
of rearmament in Germany, we
never would have gotten one.
Adenauer agreed to the Ameri
can wish for a German army only
because he thinks that we have
to give our own share for the
defense of freedom of wo want
the Americans to defend us.
Furthermore, the German army
has never been a center of Na
zism; in the contrary, it opposed
Hitler extensively.
Although I understand that il
might be hard for some people
o believe that Germany has
changed, I ask you sincerely
please neither stick to a prejudice
nor condemn those who gave us
another chance.

So far Dr. Hendrik van Dam.
I myself want to say that we
Germans can not undo what has

been done in these inferior 13
years by us in our country. All
we can do is to be seriously
ashamed of what happened and
to do the best and most we can
to make amends.
So we pay reparations up to
any amount calculated by Israel
and another Jewish Committee,
although we know that money
never ran repair the wrong done
by Nazism.
Shumm asserts that the Ger
man people wanted to get an
irmy again and that this return
of the army is comparable to a
comeback of Nazism.
Neithei is true. II a referendum
had been made on the question
of rearmament in Germany, we
never would have gotten one.
Adenauer agreed to the Ameri
can wish for a German army only
because he thinks that we have
to give our own share for the
defense of freedom of wo want
the Americans to defend us.
Furthermore, the German army
has never been a center of Na
zism; in the contrary, it opposed
Hitler extensively.
Although I understand that il
might be hard for some people
o believe that Germany has
changed, I ask you sincerely
please neither stick to a prejudice
nor condemn those who gave us
another chance.

The letter by Lawrence Shumm ;
is surprising as well as disgust
ing. Surprising because of the
confidence in his judgement, dis
gusting because of the incon
ceivable hate, which speaks out
of it.
As it is hard to answer this
letter as a German without speak
ing "pro domo," I am reproducing
part of an article, written by Dr.
Hendnk van Dam, the most prom
inent representative of the Jews
in Germany and published in the
last issue of "DIP" ZEIT." His
article deals with the recent anti
semitic events and among othei
things he writes: "
"Two assumptions are wrong
in any case.
"One is the assumption, tha
West German reaction, based on
the satiation of prosperity, is
completely passive, that there is
indifference to the course things
may take and that West Germans
are satisfied merely to trust the
reliability of tlie police.
"The seewnd assumption, which
is at least as false, is probably
'even dangerous.
"It is inherent in the prejudiced
attitude of some observers, who,
under all circumstances, want to
have confirmed whal they think
of the Germans collectively, or
those democratic defeatists, who,
in an almost morbid addiction to !
;i state of panic, consider it inevi
table that there will be a repeti
tion of January 30, 1933."
