# New Post Office, Book Store Achieve Eclectic Romanesque Unity With Quad
## 
### Ross Johnson repairer 
Stanford's new post office has opened, and the now bookstore is nearing completion. Beyond
Ihe long-awaited improvements in mail service and bookselling, the new buildings themselves are
a major and pleasing addition to the Stanford campus.
Stanford's original successful eclectic Italian Romanesque style of architecture has confronted
architects > s "uv 1890 with the difficult challenge of creating contemporary structures that fulfill

architecture's goal of art while
harmonizing with the architec
tural environment of the campus.
The buildings constructed since
the 1890's stand as memorials to
both the difficulty of the chal
lenge and the lack of imagina
tion usually brought to face it.
Not only t he abortive attempts
of Ihe "Cubberley era," but most
of the later buildings, with the
notable exceptions of Florence
Moore, the medical school and
the Dinkelspiel facade, have in
their attempts to conform to the
original Quad architecture failed
to achieve that quality which
makes architecture more than en
gineering.
The architecture of the nearly
completed post office and book
store area, though certainly not
of the level of intention of Stone's
medical school, largely succeeds

in meeting the challenge the orig
: inal Stanford achitecture imposes.
Elements of the eclectic Ro
manesque are readily noticeable
in the tile roofs, colonnaded arch
ways, sandstone-colored material
and courtyard design; the build
ings belong on the Stanford cam-!
pus and not elsewhere.
It is easy to imagine these build- j
ings, with removal of the old post j
office, as part of a new quad-;
irangle not dissonant ly clashing
iwith the old.
.
Originality
Yet there is much in this arch-'
ilecture which little relates to the
rest of the campus at all; there is
much that would be original and
j effective outside the Stanford!
; setting.
In fulfilling the function of
j weather protection, the covered I
walkways provide a horizontal
unity to the complex that is rein
j forced by the roof of the book
store, truncated by the large sky
i light.
The walkways themselves, ex
tremely thin intersecting barrel
vaults resting on proportionally
high columns, impart an upward
thrust and an airiness and open
ness not found in Stanford's other
walkways.
The upward thrust is an effec
tive counterbalance to the gen
eral horizontal emphasis, and the
openness is utilized in relation to
1 the main enclosure of both post
office and bookstore in achieving
buildings that are more than the
familiar sandstone block with red
! tile roof.
Uniqueness
The walkways, again unlike any
other on campus, extend from the
buildings beyond the edge of the
sloping tile roofs, and this ex
tension. combined with the plenti
ful use of glass, as with Stone's
| screens, helps create a sense of
transition between outside and in-
I terior tjiat is completely lacking i
! in Stanford's "bunkers."
In spite of its general achieve-'

I ment, the most serious criticism
to be directed at this new Stan
ford architecture is the blaring
expanse of plain sandstone-colored
sheet that comprises both sides
of the bookstore, most noticeable
from the patio but no more ex
j cusable on the north side, sadly
; reminiscent of Dinkelspiel's rear
I flank and so many dormitories.
Utilization
The utilization in these sur
| faces, where openings are func
tionally eliminated, of some va
i riety through screen, mosaic, or
irregularity in the wall itself
would be a more effective comple
ment to the clear horizonal sweep
j and vertical thrust embodied in
the structures than a plain wall.
Final landscaping and interior
finishing will add much to the
architectural success of these new
buildings and will transcend such
particular failings. This creativ
ity, if continued in further con
struction. will -endow Stanford's
new activity quad with architec
! tural respectability.
