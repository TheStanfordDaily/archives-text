## THE 						Finish Line The 						West's Newest Sport 
### Dick Barnes 
Stanford takes its second crack at tho West's newest sport this
weekend at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. This newest sport really
only a new angle ol the world's oldest Is indoor track. Kunning
on the hoards has made a few sporadic appearances on the coast in
years gone by, but not until the past month has it appeared ready
to gain status as a permanent fixture.
Jan. 23, the Sports Arena put on an indoor show which drew top
spike talent from all over the nation, a capacity house ol 13,000
enthusiastic fans, and equally-enthusiastic post-meet comment from
all quarters. The upcoming meet will feature fewer lags in the
program, more relays, and even a few artistic devices like green
sawdust to simulate infield grass.
Indoor track is in many respects a quite different sport from
the outdoor variety. The closeness of the crowd and the smaller
track and field event areas create a far more intense atmosphere
one which is closely akin to a circus or carnival. 1 hough this will
never come to pass in the West, indoor track in New \ ork is a part
of city night-life to the point that tux and tails are standard for
the officials and the more elite of the spectators.
To get a trackman's view of the problems and differences en
countered in indoor track as opposed to the standard variety, 1
talked to Stanford half-miler Dick Lassen. Physically the strongest
of the outstanding stable of Indian BXO men, he looks ready to crack
the 1:50 mark come spring.
Lassen was a member of Payton Jordan's championship two-mile,
and distance medley relay teams last year, and ran on the two-mile
team at the first Los Angeles indoor meet.
