# A 						Different Running Experience
## 
### 
Lassen found his first effort at board running an almost dif
ferent type of running experience. The banked board track must
be circled 11 times to complete a mile, compared to four times for
the normal outdoor oval.
This creates a much tighter radius on the turns, which presents
new tactical problems. Lassen found the board surface no problem,
though of course he had to wear the shorter and slimmer 3/8 inch
spikes.
"I found 1 had to let off acceleration to take the corners," Lassen
explained. "There's a hit more lean required, but the main change
is in floating the corners.
"I had to use more tactical acceleration and deceleration. You
can't drive on the narrow turns, so you have to drive into the
straightaways."
As a result of the more continual acceleration changes and the
change in length of the track, Lassen found il more difficult to keep
his pace. He was helped, however, by being able to run off the
shoulder of tISC's Fernando Leon most of the way. Saturday, Lassen
hopes tf> be running in front, where he will be more reliant on his
own judgment to keep a pace.
Because of the short track and more frequent turns, Lassen
thinks it best to run a defensive race more willingly taking the
lead, and with it the advantage of the inside lane.
This way, he explained, the runner can force an opponent trying
to pass to go more to the outside and higher on the curves, thus
adding more to the distance lie must run than is the case on a 410-
yard track.
Psychologically, Lassen liked the indoor set-up. "I always enjoy
the intense atmosphere," he commented, "and the crowd was only
a bother before the race." Where eastern meets are plagued by heavy
and smoky air, Sports Arena officials enforce a no-smoking ban with
the result that while it was a bit warm in-side, the air was at least
clean.
Now, all we have to do is get Cow Palace officials on the ball so
that perhaps the Hay Area can get an indoor meet or two. Or better
yet, if Stanford ever gets around to building its pavilion, maybe it'll
have room to squeeze in a board track (even one of the smaller 14
laps-to-the-mile models) for an indoor meet here.
