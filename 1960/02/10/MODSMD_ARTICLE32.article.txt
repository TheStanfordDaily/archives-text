# A 						Cool Man Comes to Cal
## 
### 
Indoor track isn't tho only thing new to California ihe univer
sity of that name has itself a new football coach.
Marv Levy is his name, he comes from New Mexico, and there's
not a heckuva lot more anybody knew about him when C'al announced
his hiring. After his hiring, most everyone looked around to find
somebody who knew something about Levy. Via the grapevine, I
learned that Jack Bresenliani. graduate industrial engineering stu
dent here, had once played with Levy. It turned out this was true
Bresenham played guard at New Mexico in 1956, when Levy was
then chief assistant under head coach Dick Claussen.
I talked to Bresenliani. and here's what he had to say about Cal's
new head man: "lie's a real sharp boy —very calm, the cool man on
the sidelines; lie's a reserved, business-like coach."
I hough ( Innsscn was Ihe front man at New Mexico, Bresenhani
felt that Levy almost ran the club's operation. Interestingly enough,
the emphasis in '56 was a bit different from the long-gainer, double
win-T style of ball Levy says he'll teach at C'al.
New Mexico then used the Oklahoma-style split-T, with the empha
sis on possession ball. Despite this, however, Levy preferred the
quick, fast man rather than the big, slow man, according to Bresen
liani.
Ihe sound and fury is now dying down from the disgruntled
alums and sour-grapes San Francisco sportswriters who can't fig
ure out why Lririie Lrdelatz didn't get the job (maybe they don't
know the Erdelatz conditions for taking a coaching job).
The air seems to be clearing on a coach who'll teach some exciting
football at Cal my question is, when do Big Game tickets go on
sale?
