# 4-1 IN AAWU RACE
## Surprising UCLA Invades Friday 
### 
Those surprising UCLA Bruins
will be back in town Friday to
meet Coach Howie Dallmar's In
dians in the Pavilion al 8 p.m.
The Bruins, not considered a
serious threat for the AAVVU title
at the beginning of the season,
have been steadily improving and
now hold down second place in
the standings. Their 4-1 record is
second only to Cal's 5-1 mark.
UCLA put together perhaps its
best game of the year to whip the
Indians last week, 67-54, and
should be even stronger for this
week's clash. Veteran forward
Kent Miller, who stands 6-6, is
expected to return after missing
four games with a sprained ankle.
Ten Per Game
Miller, who has been averaging
an even ten points per game will
give the Bruins added board
strength and scoring punch. Mil
ler's return will send either Pete
Blackman or Gary Cunningham
to the bench.
Cunningham, a 6-5 sophomore,
was leading scorer on last year's
Bruin frosh team with a 20.7
average. He was also high-point
man against Stanford last week
with 16.
Blackman is also up from the
frosh where he was second to
Cunningham in scoring with a
19.1 average.
In the UCLA backcourt will be
6-3 Bill Ellis and 6-3 John Green,
both of whom came to Westwood
from junior colleges. Both are
averaging eight points per game
and are strong defensive players.
Usual Starters
Dallmar is' expected to open
with his now-usual starting line
up of John Hendry and John
Windsor at forwards. Bub Bowl
ing and John Arrillaga at guards,
and Neal Brockmeyer at center.
The Indians will be at full
strength with the exception of
Jerry Thuesen, who is lost for
the season with a knee injury.
"UCLA is always tough be
cause they make very few mis
takes," said Dallmar. "I hope we
can hit a better percentage of
our shots than we did last week."

cause they make very few mis
takes," said Dallmar. "I hope we
can hit a better percentage of
our shots than we did last week."


BRUINS' KENT MILLER
Back from ankle injury
Those surprising UCLA Bruins
will be back in town Friday to
meet Coach Howie Dallmar's In
dians in the Pavilion al 8 p.m.
The Bruins, not considered a
serious threat for the AAVVU title
at the beginning of the season,
have been steadily improving and
now hold down second place in
the standings. Their 4-1 record is
second only to Cal's 5-1 mark.
UCLA put together perhaps its
best game of the year to whip the
Indians last week, 67-54, and
should be even stronger for this
week's clash. Veteran forward
Kent Miller, who stands 6-6, is
expected to return after missing
four games with a sprained ankle.
Ten Per Game
Miller, who has been averaging
an even ten points per game will
give the Bruins added board
strength and scoring punch. Mil
ler's return will send either Pete
Blackman or Gary Cunningham
to the bench.
Cunningham, a 6-5 sophomore,
was leading scorer on last year's
Bruin frosh team with a 20.7
average. He was also high-point
man against Stanford last week
with 16.
Blackman is also up from the
frosh where he was second to
Cunningham in scoring with a
19.1 average.
In the UCLA backcourt will be
6-3 Bill Ellis and 6-3 John Green,
both of whom came to Westwood
from junior colleges. Both are
averaging eight points per game
and are strong defensive players.
Usual Starters
Dallmar is' expected to open
with his now-usual starting line
up of John Hendry and John
Windsor at forwards. Bub Bowl
ing and John Arrillaga at guards,
and Neal Brockmeyer at center.
The Indians will be at full
strength with the exception of
Jerry Thuesen, who is lost for
the season with a knee injury.
"UCLA is always tough be
cause they make very few mis
takes," said Dallmar. "I hope we
can hit a better percentage of
our shots than we did last week."
