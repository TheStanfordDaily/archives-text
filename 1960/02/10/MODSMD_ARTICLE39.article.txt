# Boxers Battle Bears; Wrestlers Fall, 20-13
## Denny, Stephenson, Pew Win-But So Do 5 Bears 
### 
The Stanford wrestling tram
suffered its fourth setback this
one at the hands of California
last night in Encina Gym, as the
Bears fame through with a 20-13
win.
Losses in the low weight divi
sions put the Indians behind and
they were not able to come back
in the heavier divisions.
Dick Denny, 167. gained the
only pin for the Indians as he
put the stops to Cal's Dick Rice
with only 1:40 left in the match.
Denny and Rice were nearly even
on points when the swift Stan
ford grappler slipped the pin to
Rice.
Stanford's other points came
from two decisions and a draw.
Stanford captain heavy Skip
Pew, outpointed Cal's Ken Men
zer to gain three points for the
Cards. Pew controlled the match,
but was unable to put on the
final pin.
In one of the closest matches of
season, Stanford's Lee Stephen
son came out on top of a 6-."5 de
cision against Hob Fescura in a
137 pound match.

The 147 pound class ended up in
a draw between Stanford's Pete
Barnhisel and Rich Machado.
Cal gained three pins on the
evening. Toby Burnett pinned
Card Tom Snoke in a 123 pound
bout, Cal captain, Phil LaFroce
stopped Art Snoke in the second
round, and 177 pounder Barry
Davidson pinned Stanford's Frank
Redle.
