# YWCA Lunch Will Feature Poetry Talk
## 
### 
Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg, Asso
ciate Professor of Indian Civili
zation, will speak today at the
YWCA Religious Affairs lunch
eon on "The Spiritual Implica
tions of Neo-Existentialist Po
etry."
Dr. Spiegel berg, who recently
lectured at The Breakers on the
subject, maintains that the poets
to whom he refers are not "Beat
niks."
"These poets are unpolitical.
They represent a self-expression
of our time, and they have a new
message with theological impli
cations," he stated.
Spiegelberg has suggested that
although some of the poetry may
not be good literature, it has a
deeper philosophical merit. "The
linguistic quality may be poor,
but the psychology goes under
ground," he said.
He added that many theologi
ans are now turning to the neo
existentialist poets for a new di
rection in religious expression.
Dr. Spiegelberg has been at
Stanford for 18 years, and previ
ously taught at the University
of Dresden. He received his doc
torate from the University of
Tubingen.
