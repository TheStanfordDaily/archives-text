Mr. Heinecke was well liked

yesterday for one-lime Stanford
football great Walt Heineeke.
He passed away over Hip week
end.
Mr. Heineeke, who played on
Pop Warner's great teams of
1927 Ihrough 1929, passed awny
Saturday of a heart attack at
the age of 53. He had operated
a gas station on campus for 2.")
years and in that time won

many friends with his chari
table, friendly manner.
Standing just ."V7 and weigh
ing 17!, Mr. Heinecke made up
for small size with a hard-hit
ling. hustling brand of football.
11 is greatest moment in a
Stanford uniform came in the
Rose Howl game of 1928 when
ho blocked a conversion attempt
to give the Indians a 7-6 vie
t< i ■ over favored Pittsburgh.
Heinecke played between two

All-American guards, Don
Robeswy and Seraphim Post,

by these two outstanding line
men. Grantland Rice chose him
on hi-s 1929 All-American team,
and he was later admitted to
Stanford's Hall of F me.
Towards the end of the 1929

Spud Lewis was switched to
halfback, and the signal-calling
duties were relegated to Iloin
eeke. Overall record for the
three years he played was
27-7-2.
"Pound for pound and inch
for inch he was perhaps the

best football player we ever
had," «aid Don Liebendorfer,
veteran publicity director and
close friend of the deceased.
"He typified the one thing that
a football player has to have
above all others desire."
Always an avid football fan,
Mr. Heinecke loved to talk of
the old days if asked, but
seldom brought up the subject
himself.
