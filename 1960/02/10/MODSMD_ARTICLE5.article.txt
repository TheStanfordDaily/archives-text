# Ike Farm Plan Dares Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON </P) President Eisenhower presented his elec
tion year farm program yesterday and challenged the Democratic
controlled Congress to come up with a better solution to the critical
wheat surplus problem than he proposed.
"I will approve any constructive solution," Eisenhower said. Thus,

as expected, he modified past ad
ministration insistence the wheat
crisis be met by lowering price
supports and eliminating produ
tion controls.
But in his special message, the
President stressed it is imperative
for Congress to move promptly to
deal with a situation that is cost
ing the government 1 1 million
dollars every day $1,000 a min
ute to stabilize wheat prices and
income.
Without prompt action by both
Congress and the government, he
said, "This entire program will
collapse under the pressure of
public indignation and thousands
of our farming people will be
hurt."
Eisenhower's message outlined
four recommendations outside his
solution to the wheat problem:
• A three-year extension of the
soil bank land retirement pro
gram and an expansion from the
present 28 million acres to 60 mil
lion acres. This program is de
signed to help curtail overproduc
tion.
Eisenhower said the secretary
of agriculture should have author
ity to direct the major expansion
to areas of greatest need. He pro
posed. too, ttiat the government
be permitted to make rental pay
ments on retired land in the form
of crop surpluses as well as cash.
• A vigorous advancement of the
government's food for peace pro
gram to combat hunger by mov
ing U.S. surpluses to needy areas
abroad.
• An aggressive research pro
gram to develop new markets and
new uses for farm products.
• An expansion of the rural de
velopment program to help low
income rural families find better
opportunity on and off the land.
