# Under the Gaslight Begins 3-Day Run
## 
### 
"Under the Gaslight," an 1867 melodrama writtenby Augustin
Daly, opens a three-night run in Memorial Auditorium tonight.
Curtain is at 8:30.
The "boo-the-viilain. curses-Xoiled-again" show is the winter pro
duction of the student adramatic group, Ram's Head. Audiences

arc reminded, however, that it is
impolite to hiss at any lady, no
matter how villainous or mali
l cious.
Ten olio acts are on the bill with
j the melodrama. The Claypipers
from Amador County and Stan
ford's well-known magician Dick
j Zimmerman are featured. Tine
Claypipers will perform in a com
edy duet and a banjo-strumming
trio.
Community Sing -
Zimmerman expects to do both
a comedy - mind - reading and an
"escape artist" sequence for the
show. Also featured will be a com
munity sing each night, led by
! faculty members and officials.
Girls from "society" and "pov
erty" who grow up with the wrong
impressions about their- begin
nings and how they react to "the
| truth" forms the major concern
of "Under the Gaslight." Compli-
I cations ensue when a snoopy
friend reads some very private
letters and reveals the true facts.

The "totally original and pic
turesque drama of life and love in
I the times," as it was described
! when first presented in 1867, stars
Susan Stoekbridge, Douglas John
| son, T h o m as Jolly, Russell
j Coombs and Sally Pence.
