# Spiegelberg Airs Views On Beatniks
## 
### 
Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg told
the YVVCA Religious Affairs
Luncheon group yesterday that
the protests of the so-called Beat
nik movement are comparable in
spirit to the messages of Jesus
and early Christian reformers.
Dr. Spiegelberg, Associate .Pro
fessor of Indian Civilization,
spoke on "The Theological Impli
cations of Neo - Existentialist
Poetry."
" 'Beatnik' is a misplaced title,"
Spiegelberg said. He has called
the movement 'Neo-Existentialist'
because he contends that il ex
hibits the dissatisfaction of the
earlier Existentialists, but not the
despair.
"I am not interested in the lite
rary or philological merit of Neo-
Existentialist poetry, but in its
message," Spiegelberg stated. He
cited the poets' concern with to
day's moral questions and their
portrayal of tlie transitory nature
of life.
"In any cult or movement, you
can't judge the people decently
belonging to it by the hangers
on," Spiegelberg said. He sug
gester that many people direct
their criticism of the 'Beatniks'
simply at their unconventional
actions and clothing.
"Protesters typically reject
forced conformity to average
standards," he said. "You can't
tell in advance how great such a
movement will bo. Rebels often
become the messiahs and saviors
of coming centuries."
