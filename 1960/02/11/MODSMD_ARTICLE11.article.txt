# Nuclear Sub Reaches Pole
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) The Navy
announced yesterday the fourth
trip by U.S. atomic submarines
to the North Pole.
The submarine Sargo broke
through the ice at the top of the
world Tuesday afternoon and
planted the state flag of Hawaii,
from which the nuclear boat had
sailed on Jan. IS.
The cruise to the pole, in the
midst of arctic winter, re-empha
sized the ability of American nu
clear submersibles including Po
laris missile subs to take posi
tion at any season in the inter
national waters above the Soviet
Union.
The Navy announcement on the
latest submarine polar trip re
fered only to the scientific as
pects of the voyage.
It said the Sargo. like the sub
marines Nautilus and Skate be
fore it, is engaged in collecting
oeeanographic data, including in
formation on the "physical struc
ture of the ocean bottom and
about sea and ice conditions in
the relatively unknown area.''
The direct line distance from
Pearl Harbor, the Sargo's home
port, to the North Pole is about
4,200 nautical miles. However, the
Sargo, in her explorations, trav
eled a longer course.
She was under the ice for 2.711
miles before arriving at the pole
1 1 days and 21 hours afler sub
merging at the edge of the pack
in the Bering Sea southwest of
Alaska.
The Nautilus, first nuclear sub
marine in the world, reached the
North PMe Aug. 3, 1958. On Aug.
11, the submarine Skate arrived
,it the pole,
