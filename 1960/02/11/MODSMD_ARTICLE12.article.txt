# Change Proposed In Accelerator Site
## Atomic Energy Commission To Consider Sand Hill Area 
### 
The Atomic Energy Commission has announced that it is con
sidering a new site for Stanford's two-mile linear accelerator.
The new proposed site is about one-half mile south of Sand Hill
Iload extending from a point near the Santa Clara County line to a
point near Searsville Lake.
An AEC spokesman confirmed that the recommended change was

included in a complete cost and
site analysis recently completed
by a San Francisco firm.
While details of the report were
not disclosed, the spokesman said
it discussed three other possible
sites for the project. They are
south of Junipero Serra Blvd. on
Stanford property, al M o ffe 11
Field and at Coyote Hill near
Newark.
The report went to the Senate-
House Committee on Atomic
Energy, which will submit its rec
ommendation to Congress when
that body votes on the estimated
$120 million appropriation for the
project.
Other Sites
Sites other than the original one
west of Junipero Serra Blvd., fav
ored by University officials be
cause of its accessibility to scien
tists, arc being considered because
the AEC feels it would cost con
siderably more to build one there
than at Moffett Field or at Coyote
Hill.
The reason was the rugged
terrain west of Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
The Sand Hill site in consid
ered to be a sort of compromise
close to the Stanford campus,
yet in a slightly hilly area where
construction cost-s might not be
much greater than at either the
flat. Moffett Field or Coyote Hill
sites.
Crosses Freeway
The atom smasher would cross
the proposed right of way of Juni
pero Serra Freeway which would
be constructed over the atomic
tunnel.
Extensive excavation is required
at rugged sites, increasing con
struction costs considerably. At a
flat site, the tunnel can be merely
covered with earth 35 feet thick
to protect adjacent areas from
radiation.
