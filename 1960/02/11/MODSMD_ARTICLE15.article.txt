# BAD PUBLICITY
## Big Political Banquets On Way Out 
### Barry Greenberg 
The days of the political party
$100 dollar dinners are numbered,
said Eugene G. Brenner, chair
man of the San Mateo County
United Republican Finance Com
mittee, last night.
"These lavish dinners are one of
the big reasons why the Repub
lican Party is called Ihe rich
man's organization," Brenner
said. "They give both parties a
lot of bad publicity, though," he
continued.
Alinight Dollar
However, they are good fund
raisers, Brenner thinks, and
money allows activities which in
turn produce more money. "There
is, of course, no substitute for a
lot of funds if a party is to be
succesful," Brenner said.
He also discussed the count
less number of arrangements that
must be made if a $100 a plate
dinner is to function smoothly.
There are such things as analysis
of timing, availability of speaker,
and records of past events. "It is
also necessary to appoint a chair
man who is not necessarily a good
worker but who likes to see other
people work," Brenner quipped.
Problems, Problems
One must also consider whether
or not ladies will be given dis
count prices, whether or not it is
wise to serve lobster, and how to
seat donors.
"The best way to get money
from people, including $100 din
ners, is to simply ask," Brenner
said. "There was one case of a
man who gave $100 each year to
the party. Someone asked him for
$2,000 and, believe it or not, he
gladly gave it."
