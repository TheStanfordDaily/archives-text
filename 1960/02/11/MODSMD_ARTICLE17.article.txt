\ll annoimccmcnl made bx a professor in llie historx depart
ment to one of his classes last week could lie ol greal significance
to t lie si uden I bo< Iv.
Speaking in reference to a forthcoming midterm, the professor
delineated the following polic\ :
I ) It is the student s prerogative whether or not he wishes to
appear for the midterm.
'2 I If alter writing the examination the student i» not satisfied
with his effort, the exam in a I ion need not he submit ted for grading.
I No grade <1 isadx ant age would res ult from fai I lire to lake the
examination, l inal grades would he determined on the basis of
midterm and final scores in the one instance or wliollx from the
final examination in the other.
We lolls endorse this polic\ as the logical step necessarx to
save the technical adxautages of the quarter system from being
outweighed bx its present academic disadvantages.
There are definite administrative advantages in vacations that
terminate rather than interrupt academic periods. Moreover, vaca
tion periods free from acadcniic pressure constitute ;i real advan
tage of the quarter svsleni from the student s standpoint.
Hot we find it rather ironic that 100 often the student s primarx
opportunitx for meditation and contemplation can be found onlx
between rather than within academic quarters. We cannot find in
adminisl rat ix e and student eonx'eiiience alone a justification for
the creative stagnation resulting from the combination ol a nian
datorx midterm svsleni and the short academic quarter.
The midterm svsleni often places more emphasis upon fact
finding than upon the interpretive or applicative aspects of course
material, breaking the conlinuitx of a ten-week course into arti
ficial halves or thirds puts the reflex nieinorx rather than the re
flective mind at a premium. Asa result I lie si mien t is often en eon r
aged merelx to gather information rather than develop under
standing.
A categorical dismissal of iutra-quarlcr tests max not be appli
cable in all departments. In courses where the comprehension of
each hours material is directlx dependent upon the preceding
hour, the periodic short quiz max be a valuable measure of the
ecectixeness of both the student's studving and the professor's
p resentat ion.
\\ e feel, however, that in no department is the niandatorv mid
term an academic necessitv. The poliev outlined above leaves the
system intact for those students xvho find periodic checks to their
advantage.
Hut the student who xvishes to evaluate and applx his knowl
edge in a 112 uller perspeel iv e should not he required to scurry 112 rom
examination to examination within the quarter.
I he quarter svsleni as it now stands needs cleaning up. We feel
that in general a reform on the order of the above is I'axored bx
the facultv as well as the student bodv.
I lie initiative has been taken. We hope the innovation will
become an institution.
