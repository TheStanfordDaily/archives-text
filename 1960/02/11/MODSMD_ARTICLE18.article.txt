Stanford has not escaped the
anti-Semitic outbursts that have
occurred on many of the nation's
campuses in the last month.
Someone has drawn a large Star
of David on a bulletin board hang
ing in the bathroom of one of the
men's dorms. Under the Star, the
person has written some obscene
words, cursing the Jews.
Where other similar incidents
have occurred, college newspaper
editors have vehemently attacked
them.
One such incident was at Bos
ton University where some stu
dents painted swastikas on one
of the dorms. The Boston I Di
versity News said: "There will
come a time for serious awak
ening on the pari of many I Di
versity students who hold the
insidious painting of the swas
tika to he a joke, and something
which should he laughed at, then
ignored.
"Can it he that these students
have not heard of World War II
and the millions of Jews who died
as the result of the sign of the
swastika?"
A large, black swastika was
painted on the front doors of the
Hillel Foundation at Ohio State
University. The Lantern, the
school's newspaper, was angry:
"At first thought, we would prob
ably credit this to the work of a
crackpot, or call him something
else that cannot be printed.
"Ilut on the other hand, it may
have been the work of a sane
person who meant it. And this
person is usually worse than all
the crackpots in the world."
"The painting of the swastika
here hurts. It upsets us. Some
thing like this shouldn't occur at
this University or any other cam
pus. We are supposedly in an in
tellectual community with intelli
gent people. So we hope the swas
tika was t he work of a stupid non
l Jniversity person. Why won Id any
intelligent individual want to re
live the rotten days of the Nazis?"
The Daily Universe of Brigham
Young University in Utah, where

another such incident occurred,
thought "the best medicine for
such lunk heads would be to take
them over and show them the gas
chambers and the burning ovens
where Hitler killed thousands of
Jews.
"If they ever s 111 e I Ie d the
stench of burning human flesh
or heard the screams of persons
scalding to death, they'd get sick
every time they saw a swas
tika."
The Daily Universe underesti
mated Hitler's efficiency. Actu
ally, six million Jews were exter
minated in one way or another.
Many starved or died of disease
in the many ghettos and concen
tration camps that pocked the face
of wartime Europe. Others died
after inexplicable torture.
Hitler even went so far as to
form a special "extermination
crew." comprised of the most sa
distic scientific minds in all of
Europe. They thought of many
interesting ways of "tricking" the
Jews to death.
One such method was 1o order
about .10 Jews into the back of a
truck and tell them that they were
going for a ride in the country.
After they had climbed in, the
lead door was shut and highly
poisonous gas pellets we r e
dropped into the crowd from an
opening in the top of the truck
which was also closed. They were
dead in a matter of minutes, after
horrible suffering.
Such is the mind of the person
who wears a swastika. Lot us not
forget also thai World War II did
more than kill six million Jews;
it also killed many Americans;
Jewish, Gen t i 1 e, White, Black,
Yellow.
As the last paragraph of the
Boston University News editor
ial says: "l( is up to the student
body of today to recognize the
threat these swastikas hold over
us, and to find methods of eliini
nating them. The sooner they
are gone, not only from sight
but primarily from mind, the
better off we will all be."
