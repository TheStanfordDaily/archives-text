Drinking
Editor, The Daily:
I feel it is long past time that
Iho drinking question he put in a
sane, sober, rational and realistic
light. There are basically three
questions of importance: what
have we got? what do we want?
and most important of all, what
can be done about the situation?
The first two answers are
simple. We have an official Uni
versity policy which unequivicall>
forbids drinking on campus, while
a vast majority of students would
prefer more liberal regulations.
To have drinking permitted on
campus, we would have to alter
the ASSU Constitution, a some
what involved process. Furl her.
with the consent of the Trustees
of the Stanford estate, a court
order would have to be obtained
to amend the conditions of the
S t a n 112 o rd will. The University
would be obliged to show some
very good cause why the will
should be altered. After all this,
alcoholic beverages could lie con
sumed on campus, but not sold in
the proximity under the Califor
nia State Law. Should anyone vol
unteer for this mammoth and
probably unsuccessful task, I wish
him well.
The obvious alternative is to
make the most of the situation
that exists. It seems to mo that
the University authorities, rather
than take stringent action, have,
in effect, invoked the Fundamen
tal Standard, thus placing the em
phasis on the individual and stu
dent conscience. This gives stu
dents a certain measure of free
dom and with it a certain meas
ure of responsibility; responsibil
ity to ensure that if there is drink
ing, it will be done quietly and in
moderation.
The fraternities are obviously
responsible for seeing that these
requirements are maintained on
their grounds by their members.
In this light we are better able to
judge the punishment meted out
to the Sigma Nit's, which David
liOmax decried in his article in the
Daily, in the light of failure to
uphold a common responsibility
rather than that of punishment
of the innocent.
If the living groups initiated
and strictly enforced a program
ostracizing their members, not
only for immoderate imbibing on
campus but also for returning to
campus very much the worse for
wear, the University would be con
siderably hotter for it.
The best way of obtaining more
freedom is to assume more re
sponsibility. This has always boon
the unwritten law of democratic
society and as such, may we see
more of it, on campus, in Ameri
ca, and in the world, now and for
ever more. Amen.
Neil Itruee
Union?
Editor, The Daily:
The expensive Tresidder Union
is approaching construction. The
only questions raised about it
seem to bo where exactly to locate
the intimate 20-f)0 person alcoves
and the 300 person relaxation
lounges.
Recently Lagunita Court expe
rienced a secessionist movement,
which was invited to die quietly.
Apparently some stray cases felt
the need for more independent
self-government.
Muir Wing of Stern attempted
earlier this year to have an inde
pendent constitution. It was voted
for overwhelmingly by the mem
bers of the wing, and then reject
ed by the LASSU.
Is there a basic relation between
those two actions? Unassoeiated
living units have felt some sort
of need for more self-government.
The question is whether more
benefit could bo derived from
spending money on founding a
house system or on a central
Uni on. An impersonal Union
might bo nice, but many people
fool that they are not deriving full
benefit from their Stanford ex
perience.
The emphasis toward a central
bureaucracy on campus one big
Union is perhaps being chal
lenged by living groups. Perhaps
the philosophy that the emptiness
of the vast concrete dormitories
must be tolerated is being chal
lenged. Perhaps a house system
is about due at Stanford.

simple. We have an official Uni
versity policy which unequivicall>
forbids drinking on campus, while
a vast majority of students would
prefer more liberal regulations.
To have drinking permitted on
campus, we would have to alter
the ASSU Constitution, a some
what involved process. Furl her.
with the consent of the Trustees
of the Stanford estate, a court
order would have to be obtained
to amend the conditions of the
S t a n 112 o rd will. The University
would be obliged to show some
very good cause why the will
should be altered. After all this,
alcoholic beverages could lie con
sumed on campus, but not sold in
the proximity under the Califor
nia State Law. Should anyone vol
unteer for this mammoth and
probably unsuccessful task, I wish
him well.
The obvious alternative is to
make the most of the situation
that exists. It seems to mo that
the University authorities, rather
than take stringent action, have,
in effect, invoked the Fundamen
tal Standard, thus placing the em
phasis on the individual and stu
dent conscience. This gives stu
dents a certain measure of free
dom and with it a certain meas
ure of responsibility; responsibil
ity to ensure that if there is drink
ing, it will be done quietly and in
moderation.
The fraternities are obviously
responsible for seeing that these
requirements are maintained on
their grounds by their members.
In this light we are better able to
judge the punishment meted out
to the Sigma Nit's, which David
liOmax decried in his article in the
Daily, in the light of failure to
uphold a common responsibility
rather than that of punishment
of the innocent.
If the living groups initiated
and strictly enforced a program
ostracizing their members, not
only for immoderate imbibing on
campus but also for returning to
campus very much the worse for
wear, the University would be con
siderably hotter for it.
The best way of obtaining more
freedom is to assume more re
sponsibility. This has always boon
the unwritten law of democratic
society and as such, may we see
more of it, on campus, in Ameri
ca, and in the world, now and for
ever more. Amen.

Is there a basic relation between

The question is whether more

the philosophy that the emptiness

order would have to be obtained
to amend the conditions of the
S t a n 112 o rd will. The University
would be obliged to show some
very good cause why the will
should be altered. After all this,
alcoholic beverages could lie con
sumed on campus, but not sold in
the proximity under the Califor
nia State Law. Should anyone vol
unteer for this mammoth and
probably unsuccessful task, I wish
him well.
The obvious alternative is to
make the most of the situation
that exists. It seems to mo that
the University authorities, rather
than take stringent action, have,
in effect, invoked the Fundamen
tal Standard, thus placing the em
phasis on the individual and stu
dent conscience. This gives stu
dents a certain measure of free
dom and with it a certain meas
ure of responsibility; responsibil
ity to ensure that if there is drink
ing, it will be done quietly and in
moderation.
The fraternities are obviously
responsible for seeing that these
requirements are maintained on
their grounds by their members.
In this light we are better able to
judge the punishment meted out
to the Sigma Nit's, which David
liOmax decried in his article in the
Daily, in the light of failure to
uphold a common responsibility
rather than that of punishment
of the innocent.
If the living groups initiated
and strictly enforced a program
ostracizing their members, not
only for immoderate imbibing on
campus but also for returning to
campus very much the worse for
wear, the University would be con
siderably hotter for it.
The best way of obtaining more
freedom is to assume more re
sponsibility. This has always boon
the unwritten law of democratic
society and as such, may we see
more of it, on campus, in Ameri
ca, and in the world, now and for
ever more. Amen.

Union?
Editor, The Daily:
The expensive Tresidder Union
is approaching construction. The
only questions raised about it
seem to bo where exactly to locate
the intimate 20-f)0 person alcoves
and the 300 person relaxation
lounges.
Recently Lagunita Court expe
rienced a secessionist movement,
which was invited to die quietly.
Apparently some stray cases felt
the need for more independent
self-government.
Muir Wing of Stern attempted
earlier this year to have an inde
pendent constitution. It was voted
for overwhelmingly by the mem
bers of the wing, and then reject
ed by the LASSU.
Is there a basic relation between
those two actions? Unassoeiated
living units have felt some sort
of need for more self-government.
The question is whether more
benefit could bo derived from
spending money on founding a
house system or on a central
Uni on. An impersonal Union
might bo nice, but many people
fool that they are not deriving full
benefit from their Stanford ex
perience.
The emphasis toward a central
bureaucracy on campus one big
Union is perhaps being chal
lenged by living groups. Perhaps
the philosophy that the emptiness
of the vast concrete dormitories
must be tolerated is being chal
lenged. Perhaps a house system
is about due at Stanford.
