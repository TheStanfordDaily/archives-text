## Two Views Tear Algeria

ing Science at Stanford.

Of the 10 million people of Al
geria, approximately So per cent
are Moslem and 15 per cent are
European. However, a European
minority of three per cent of the
total population possesses 31 per
cent of the arable land and an
even greater percentage of the
total wealth of the country.
These facts, and many others
of tho problem, can be interpreted
from opposite points of view.
The Moslem leaders consider
their people to be living under the
power of a foreign minority in a
system liltle removed from colo
nialism. They see Algeria as an
Arab land whose control is in the
hands of foreigners.
To its European inhabitants Al
geria is a land first economically
exploited and developed by their
fathers. Their ancestors settled
their families and spent their
lives and fortunes on Algerian
land. They cannot consider leav
ing now to start another life
elsewhere.
It is quite reasonable to think

that a large portion of Algeria's
European population would have
to leave following Algerian inde
pendence, as has been the case
in Morocco and Tunisia.
Only when one has considered
all sides of the conflict and the
partial validity of each can one
begin to understand the complex
ity of the problem. Perhaps Amer
icans should remember the prob
lems of their Civil War.
Of course, the situations are
different in many respects, but
some of the tragedies of Ameri
ca's Civil War are inherent in
our problem in Algeria.
It is not enough merely to re
proach any violence involved. One
should attempt to comprehend
the psychological and sociolog
ical as well as the economic na
ture of the problem as it encom
passes all sides. A comprehension
of the policy of pacification and
self determination is possible only
in the light of a fuller understand
ing of the many issues involved.
The press always plays an im
portant role in contributing to a
general comprehension of such
problems, and the American press
has been particularly fair to us
dining the Algerian demonstra
tions of the past few days.

In regard to ihe future the re
luctance of both Europeans and
Moslems to consider more than
their own respective position will
probably make a definite .solution
difficult in any case.

their people to be living under the
power of a foreign minority in a
system liltle removed from colo
nialism. They see Algeria as an
Arab land whose control is in the
hands of foreigners.
To its European inhabitants Al
geria is a land first economically
exploited and developed by their
fathers. Their ancestors settled
their families and spent their
lives and fortunes on Algerian
land. They cannot consider leav
ing now to start another life
elsewhere.
It is quite reasonable to think

that a large portion of Algeria's
European population would have
to leave following Algerian inde
pendence, as has been the case
in Morocco and Tunisia.
Only when one has considered
all sides of the conflict and the
partial validity of each can one
begin to understand the complex
ity of the problem. Perhaps Amer
icans should remember the prob
lems of their Civil War.
Of course, the situations are
different in many respects, but
some of the tragedies of Ameri
ca's Civil War are inherent in
our problem in Algeria.
It is not enough merely to re
proach any violence involved. One
should attempt to comprehend
the psychological and sociolog
ical as well as the economic na
ture of the problem as it encom
passes all sides. A comprehension
of the policy of pacification and
self determination is possible only
in the light of a fuller understand
ing of the many issues involved.
The press always plays an im
portant role in contributing to a
general comprehension of such
problems, and the American press
has been particularly fair to us
dining the Algerian demonstra
tions of the past few days.

In regard to ihe future the re
luctance of both Europeans and
Moslems to consider more than
their own respective position will
probably make a definite .solution
difficult in any case.

Of the 10 million people of Al
geria, approximately So per cent
are Moslem and 15 per cent are
European. However, a European
minority of three per cent of the
total population possesses 31 per
cent of the arable land and an
even greater percentage of the
total wealth of the country.
These facts, and many others
of tho problem, can be interpreted
from opposite points of view.
