OPTIMISM DKPARTMKNT (preseason division) Stanford
track coach Payton Jordan is a happy man.
Actually a better word might be fulfilled, because to a certain
extent it appears that the head track mentor -has nothing left to
live for.
The reason for all the joy over at the track office is actually two
told. The first is that, although the spike season doesn't officially
open until March 19, the track team is shaping up in such fine
fashion that Jordan can say that he has never felt more optimistic
about any team that he has ever coached.
The second factor is the schedule of events lined up for the
Stanford track this season. Everything from the California Hi«h
School Championships to t'he trials for the 19(50 Olympic Gaines are
set for the oval in the Stadium this year. Between the end of March
and the beginning of July most 01 the best trackmen in the nation
will compete on The Farm.
Take the high school meet on June 1 for instance. Among the

prep stars competing will be Dave
Boore of Los Altos, holder of the
2 mile record for high school
runners, Doug Sclioenwetter from
Fremont, who has thrown the
discus farther than any junior in
high school ever has, Mike Lehner
of Palo Alto, the state cross
country champ and his teammate
Mike C hilton who has run the
half-mile in 1:54.4. The list is
much longer and equally as im
pressive.
On April 9 the Tribe will meet
San Jose State. If it's stars you
want, try these on for size:
• Eri'ol Williams, the co-national
high jump champion who was on
the American team that competed
against Russia in Philadelphia
last July.
• Don Ramos. who ran for Sacra
mento JC last year and chalked
up a 46.9 quarter mile.
• Charlie Clark, who last year set
junior college records in both the
mile and 2 mile.
• Bobby Poynter, the frosting on

cake. Stanford frosh coach Jim Terrill says that Poynter is going
to make everybody forget about Kay Norton, who last year ran the
100 as fast as anybody ever did before. Terrill may be exagerating
slightly since the feat he mentions would be comparable to Dr. Finch
making people forget about Caryl Chessman, but his point is well
taken since Poynter ran only a whisker behind Norton all last year.
He has run the 100 in 9.4 and the 220 in 20.5, both virtually unbeat
able times.
Cal's Bijs Three
On May 7 is the Big Meet against gltess who. The Golden Bears
are spearheaded by a big three: Willie White, C'ebron Russ and Jack
Yerman. White has won the 100, 220 and the low hurdles against
the Tribe for two years running and will be out to repeat his triple.
Russ is a hurdler who broad jumps way over 25 feet just to keep
in shape. Yerman is a quarter-miler who also competed in ihe Phila
delphia meet against the Soviet Union.
The Olympics? Well, Perry O'Brien and Dallas Long will compete
against each other in the shot put and Boh Gutowski and Don Bragg
will go at it in the pole vault. Whoever wins these events may
very well have to set a world's record to do it. Norton, Poynter
and Bobby Morrow, the 1952 Olympic sprint star, will do battle in the
short ones and again a world's record may be in the making. Dyrol
Burleson, the 19-year-old sophomore from Oregon wh'o will soon be
the best miler in United States history, will lie one of a star-studded
field in the distance events. There are more, but you get the picture.
The dates are July 1 and 2.
The Tribe Looks Tough
Then there's the Stanford team. Led by co-captains John Kelly,
who is an Olympic broad jump and hop, step and jump prospect, and
half-miler Ernie Cunliffe, also with possibilities for Rome, the Tribe
is strong, very strong.
Dan Moore broad jumped farther than any freshman in the na
tion last year and has turned in magnificent times in the high
hurdles. Bob Martin, a junior, is possibly the best potential hurdler
who has ever come to The Farm. Don Bell, the best all around track
man in school, cracked Bob Mathias' frosh discus record last year
and was second in the country for freshmen plate throwers. This
is the cream of an exciting crop.
What has Payton Jordon got to live for? Well, maybe it's the
19th of March.

extent it appears that the head track mentor -has nothing left to
live for.
The reason for all the joy over at the track office is actually two
told. The first is that, although the spike season doesn't officially
open until March 19, the track team is shaping up in such fine
fashion that Jordan can say that he has never felt more optimistic
about any team that he has ever coached.
The second factor is the schedule of events lined up for the
Stanford track this season. Everything from the California Hi«h
School Championships to t'he trials for the 19(50 Olympic Gaines are
set for the oval in the Stadium this year. Between the end of March
and the beginning of July most 01 the best trackmen in the nation
will compete on The Farm.
Take the high school meet on June 1 for instance. Among the

prep stars competing will be Dave
Boore of Los Altos, holder of the
2 mile record for high school
runners, Doug Sclioenwetter from
Fremont, who has thrown the
discus farther than any junior in
high school ever has, Mike Lehner
of Palo Alto, the state cross
country champ and his teammate
Mike C hilton who has run the
half-mile in 1:54.4. The list is
much longer and equally as im
pressive.
On April 9 the Tribe will meet
San Jose State. If it's stars you
want, try these on for size:
• Eri'ol Williams, the co-national
high jump champion who was on
the American team that competed
against Russia in Philadelphia
last July.
• Don Ramos. who ran for Sacra
mento JC last year and chalked
up a 46.9 quarter mile.
• Charlie Clark, who last year set
junior college records in both the
mile and 2 mile.
• Bobby Poynter, the frosting on

cake. Stanford frosh coach Jim Terrill says that Poynter is going
to make everybody forget about Kay Norton, who last year ran the
100 as fast as anybody ever did before. Terrill may be exagerating
slightly since the feat he mentions would be comparable to Dr. Finch
making people forget about Caryl Chessman, but his point is well
taken since Poynter ran only a whisker behind Norton all last year.
He has run the 100 in 9.4 and the 220 in 20.5, both virtually unbeat
able times.
Cal's Bijs Three
On May 7 is the Big Meet against gltess who. The Golden Bears
are spearheaded by a big three: Willie White, C'ebron Russ and Jack
Yerman. White has won the 100, 220 and the low hurdles against
the Tribe for two years running and will be out to repeat his triple.
Russ is a hurdler who broad jumps way over 25 feet just to keep
in shape. Yerman is a quarter-miler who also competed in ihe Phila
delphia meet against the Soviet Union.
The Olympics? Well, Perry O'Brien and Dallas Long will compete
against each other in the shot put and Boh Gutowski and Don Bragg
will go at it in the pole vault. Whoever wins these events may
very well have to set a world's record to do it. Norton, Poynter
and Bobby Morrow, the 1952 Olympic sprint star, will do battle in the
short ones and again a world's record may be in the making. Dyrol
Burleson, the 19-year-old sophomore from Oregon wh'o will soon be
the best miler in United States history, will lie one of a star-studded
field in the distance events. There are more, but you get the picture.
The dates are July 1 and 2.
The Tribe Looks Tough
Then there's the Stanford team. Led by co-captains John Kelly,
who is an Olympic broad jump and hop, step and jump prospect, and
half-miler Ernie Cunliffe, also with possibilities for Rome, the Tribe
is strong, very strong.
Dan Moore broad jumped farther than any freshman in the na
tion last year and has turned in magnificent times in the high
hurdles. Bob Martin, a junior, is possibly the best potential hurdler
who has ever come to The Farm. Don Bell, the best all around track
man in school, cracked Bob Mathias' frosh discus record last year
and was second in the country for freshmen plate throwers. This
is the cream of an exciting crop.
What has Payton Jordon got to live for? Well, maybe it's the
19th of March.

told. The first is that, although the spike season doesn't officially
open until March 19, the track team is shaping up in such fine
fashion that Jordan can say that he has never felt more optimistic
about any team that he has ever coached.
The second factor is the schedule of events lined up for the
Stanford track this season. Everything from the California Hi«h
School Championships to t'he trials for the 19(50 Olympic Gaines are
set for the oval in the Stadium this year. Between the end of March
and the beginning of July most 01 the best trackmen in the nation
will compete on The Farm.
Take the high school meet on June 1 for instance. Among the

prep stars competing will be Dave
Boore of Los Altos, holder of the
2 mile record for high school
runners, Doug Sclioenwetter from
Fremont, who has thrown the
discus farther than any junior in
high school ever has, Mike Lehner
of Palo Alto, the state cross
country champ and his teammate
Mike C hilton who has run the
half-mile in 1:54.4. The list is
much longer and equally as im
pressive.
On April 9 the Tribe will meet
San Jose State. If it's stars you
want, try these on for size:
• Eri'ol Williams, the co-national
high jump champion who was on
the American team that competed
against Russia in Philadelphia
last July.
• Don Ramos. who ran for Sacra
mento JC last year and chalked
up a 46.9 quarter mile.
• Charlie Clark, who last year set
junior college records in both the
mile and 2 mile.
• Bobby Poynter, the frosting on

cake. Stanford frosh coach Jim Terrill says that Poynter is going
to make everybody forget about Kay Norton, who last year ran the
100 as fast as anybody ever did before. Terrill may be exagerating
slightly since the feat he mentions would be comparable to Dr. Finch
making people forget about Caryl Chessman, but his point is well
taken since Poynter ran only a whisker behind Norton all last year.
He has run the 100 in 9.4 and the 220 in 20.5, both virtually unbeat
able times.
Cal's Bijs Three
On May 7 is the Big Meet against gltess who. The Golden Bears
are spearheaded by a big three: Willie White, C'ebron Russ and Jack
Yerman. White has won the 100, 220 and the low hurdles against
the Tribe for two years running and will be out to repeat his triple.
Russ is a hurdler who broad jumps way over 25 feet just to keep
in shape. Yerman is a quarter-miler who also competed in ihe Phila
delphia meet against the Soviet Union.
The Olympics? Well, Perry O'Brien and Dallas Long will compete
against each other in the shot put and Boh Gutowski and Don Bragg
will go at it in the pole vault. Whoever wins these events may
very well have to set a world's record to do it. Norton, Poynter
and Bobby Morrow, the 1952 Olympic sprint star, will do battle in the
short ones and again a world's record may be in the making. Dyrol
Burleson, the 19-year-old sophomore from Oregon wh'o will soon be
the best miler in United States history, will lie one of a star-studded
field in the distance events. There are more, but you get the picture.
The dates are July 1 and 2.
The Tribe Looks Tough
Then there's the Stanford team. Led by co-captains John Kelly,
who is an Olympic broad jump and hop, step and jump prospect, and
half-miler Ernie Cunliffe, also with possibilities for Rome, the Tribe
is strong, very strong.
Dan Moore broad jumped farther than any freshman in the na
tion last year and has turned in magnificent times in the high
hurdles. Bob Martin, a junior, is possibly the best potential hurdler
who has ever come to The Farm. Don Bell, the best all around track
man in school, cracked Bob Mathias' frosh discus record last year
and was second in the country for freshmen plate throwers. This
is the cream of an exciting crop.
What has Payton Jordon got to live for? Well, maybe it's the
19th of March.
