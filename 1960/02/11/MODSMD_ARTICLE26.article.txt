### Glenn Alford 
Stanford's fast i m p roving
oagers will try to move up even
further on the AAVVU ladder with
a win over the fading USC Tro
jans. The Indians take on the
I Trojans Saturday night in the
; Pavilion.
Both the Tribe and the Trojans
have been struck by injuries.
Stanford's Jerry Thuesen will be
out for the rest of the season with
a knee injury. Indian Basketball
Coach Howie Dallmar said yes
terday that Thuesen would have
his knee operated on in March,
and that it is likely that he won't
play for the rest of the year.
USC's Johnny Werhas has a
bad back and probably will not
accompany his team on the road.
Trojan Coach Forrest Twogood
said that he wouldn't risk a major
injury to Werhas.
The USC starting unit will bo
composed of John Rudometkin
and Vein Ashby, who will replace
Werhas, at the forwards, Jim
i Hanna at center, and Jerry Pimm
land either Chris Appel or Steve
j Kemp the guards.
Whether Appel or Kemp starts
depends on Twogood's whim,
j Appel is the better offensive play

lor, but Kemp is better equipped
| to guard Stanford's John Arril*
laga.
Rudometkin is USC's top
threat with Werhas gone. 6-7 Jim
j Hanna i* a threat under the
board. His sub, 6-8 Kent Stanley
is just as dangerous. Pimm is a
late comer, having been promoted
to the starting five over Bill
Bloom.
Against them, Stanford will
counter with John Hendry and
John Windsor "at forwards, Neal
Brockmeyer ;it center, and Arril
-1 laga and Bub Bowling in the back
| court.
Stanford's panic five, Mike Leg
erwood, Phil Kelly, Tim Bryan,
{Tom Nordland and John Stahler,
| who save the first game with
USC. will be back to give a rest
! if the weary warriors need one.
For both teams, the game is a
must win. USC is sinking rapidly,
and, with a 3-4 record, needs to
pull itself up to a possible second
place finish.
Stanford still has a chance at
the league title, but it can't lose
any more games. It must take
I UCLA, USC and then beat Cal
■ in its two remaining games to
I cop the crown.

bad back and probably will not
accompany his team on the road.
Trojan Coach Forrest Twogood
said that he wouldn't risk a major
injury to Werhas.
The USC starting unit will bo
composed of John Rudometkin
and Vein Ashby, who will replace
Werhas, at the forwards, Jim
i Hanna at center, and Jerry Pimm
land either Chris Appel or Steve
j Kemp the guards.
Whether Appel or Kemp starts
depends on Twogood's whim,
j Appel is the better offensive play

lor, but Kemp is better equipped
| to guard Stanford's John Arril*
laga.
Rudometkin is USC's top
threat with Werhas gone. 6-7 Jim
j Hanna i* a threat under the
board. His sub, 6-8 Kent Stanley
is just as dangerous. Pimm is a
late comer, having been promoted
to the starting five over Bill
Bloom.
Against them, Stanford will
counter with John Hendry and
John Windsor "at forwards, Neal
Brockmeyer ;it center, and Arril
-1 laga and Bub Bowling in the back
| court.
Stanford's panic five, Mike Leg
erwood, Phil Kelly, Tim Bryan,
{Tom Nordland and John Stahler,
| who save the first game with
USC. will be back to give a rest
! if the weary warriors need one.
For both teams, the game is a
must win. USC is sinking rapidly,
and, with a 3-4 record, needs to
pull itself up to a possible second
place finish.
Stanford still has a chance at
the league title, but it can't lose
any more games. It must take
I UCLA, USC and then beat Cal
■ in its two remaining games to
I cop the crown.
Stanford's fast i m p roving
oagers will try to move up even
further on the AAVVU ladder with
a win over the fading USC Tro
jans. The Indians take on the
I Trojans Saturday night in the
; Pavilion.
Both the Tribe and the Trojans
have been struck by injuries.
Stanford's Jerry Thuesen will be
out for the rest of the season with
a knee injury. Indian Basketball
Coach Howie Dallmar said yes
terday that Thuesen would have
his knee operated on in March,
and that it is likely that he won't
play for the rest of the year.
