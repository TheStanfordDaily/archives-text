# GENTLY RISING
## Economist: Inflation Inevitable' 
### 
At a lecture before some 200
students yesterday, economist Ni
cholas Kaldor argued that some
inflation is inevitable if we have
economic growth, and that eco
nomic growth can be stimulated
by inflation.
Speaking of a "gently rising
price level" to avoid the connota
tions of "creeping inflation," Kal
dor rejected theories that infla
tion is due to monetary misman
agement or full employment poli
cies.
Growth Depends on Profits
Kaldor argued that economic
growth depends on expectations
of growing money profits and de
creasing real interest rates, and
that inflation causes both. If this
is so, continually increasing
money incomes may prevent
slumps.
On the other hand, rising
profits accompanying economic
growth stimulates new wage de
mands in "wage leader" indus
tries, and the rising money wages
"recharge the batteries" of infla
tion.
Theory Borne Out
The theory that rising produc
tion and rising prices must go
together in the national economy
is borne out by economic history,
with the notable exception of the
United States in the late nine
teenth century.
Kaldor explains this exception
by the facts that anticipated profit
growth offset the rise in the real
interest rate caused by falling
prices, and the plentiful supply of
labor and. lack of unions kept
wage earners from "recharging
the batteries."
