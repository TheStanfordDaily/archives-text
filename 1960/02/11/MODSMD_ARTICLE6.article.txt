# Tanker Towed Out to Safety
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (/P) The
crippled wine tanker Angelo Petri
was towed to safety in deep ocean
| waters yesterday after a 26-hour
j battering by a gale off the Golden
| Gate.
Three tugs pulled the wine
filled vessel to a position 10 miles
off the coast.
I The tugs planned to hold the
j seven - million - dollar ship there
; through the night and then bring
j her in on the flood tide at 8 a.m.
j today when the heavily laden
craft can have a relatively smooth
ride through the rough waters of
the Golden Gate.
The tanker needs repairs to its
! electrical system and rudder.
The gale which crippled the
ship has faded away. Seas still
: were too rough for an immediate
attempt to tow the ship back into
j San Francisco Bay.
The battle of sailors to save the
world's largest wine tanker began
! Tuesday when a wave cascaded
down her stack and ventilators,
flooding her engine room. Drift
ing without power, her anchor
finally caught bottom 3.7 miles
off the coast, directly west of
I Flelsh hacker Zoo.
The Coast Guard had evacuated
14 of the 40-man crew when Capt.
Fdward A. Lehn Jr. of San Mateo,
decided he might be able to save
his ship and cargo 2 1 2 million
gallons of bulk wine.
At one time, the Petri, with a
/{it toot draft, was in less than 40
i Icel nt water.
