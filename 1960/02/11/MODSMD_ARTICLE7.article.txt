# 'PERILS ZONING'
## Stanford's Plans For Industry Hit 
### 
Los Altos Hills officials yesterday accused Stanford of "jeopar- -
| dizing existing zoning and land development all along its bound-1
aries," through plans for industrial development of the foothill areas. ;
In a letter released yesterday and addressed to Alf E. Brandin, j
! vice president for business affairs, Mayor John Fowle and j

throe oiher Mills officials also
charged the University with be
ing the "only jurisdiction in our
area whose plans and action, in
their development stages are not
subject to public scrutiny."
Plans for an Ampex Corpora
tion research center on 80 acres
of the Stanford foothills were
specifically criticized, but the
letter also attacked the Univer
sity's broad plans for industrial
development of its property.
'Dismayed'
The letter stated that Hills of
ficials were "dismayed" by Stan
ford's proposed industrial de
velopment. It referred to Stan
ford's plans to increase develop
ment from."50 acres in 1953 to
2,300 acres, and called the increase
"extraordinary."
"You did not tell us what fresh
planning the University has done
in the light of this enormously
increased plan for factory de-1
velopment to provide for traffic. ;
or even to study where factory
workers in the new plants will
live," the letter states.
The Hills officials declared that
the proposed Ampex development
at Arastradero Road and W. Fre
mont Ave. could eventually con
tain an industrial complex of!
about 360 acres.
Land Changes
"The Ampex and similar foot
hill industrial sites will require
high capacity access roads" and
could require "drastic bulldozing" j
of surrounding area* to accom
modate the plant, the officials
continue.
"These are lands which all
planners have considered resi
dential reserve for the broad com
munity," the letter states.
After Brandin's conversation
on Stanford plans with Hills of
ficials, the letter continues, "We
were left with the impression that
the University has found it more
expedient and more profitable to
lease its lands to industry."

on Stanford plans with Hills of
ficials, the letter continues, "We
were left with the impression that
the University has found it more
expedient and more profitable to
lease its lands to industry."
Los Altos Hills officials yesterday accused Stanford of "jeopar- -
| dizing existing zoning and land development all along its bound-1
aries," through plans for industrial development of the foothill areas. ;
In a letter released yesterday and addressed to Alf E. Brandin, j
! vice president for business affairs, Mayor John Fowle and j

throe oiher Mills officials also
charged the University with be
ing the "only jurisdiction in our
area whose plans and action, in
their development stages are not
subject to public scrutiny."
Plans for an Ampex Corpora
tion research center on 80 acres
of the Stanford foothills were
specifically criticized, but the
letter also attacked the Univer
sity's broad plans for industrial
development of its property.
'Dismayed'
The letter stated that Hills of
ficials were "dismayed" by Stan
ford's proposed industrial de
velopment. It referred to Stan
ford's plans to increase develop
ment from."50 acres in 1953 to
2,300 acres, and called the increase
"extraordinary."
"You did not tell us what fresh
planning the University has done
in the light of this enormously
increased plan for factory de-1
velopment to provide for traffic. ;
or even to study where factory
workers in the new plants will
live," the letter states.
The Hills officials declared that
the proposed Ampex development
at Arastradero Road and W. Fre
mont Ave. could eventually con
tain an industrial complex of!
about 360 acres.
Land Changes
"The Ampex and similar foot
hill industrial sites will require
high capacity access roads" and
could require "drastic bulldozing" j
of surrounding area* to accom
modate the plant, the officials
continue.
"These are lands which all
planners have considered resi
dential reserve for the broad com
munity," the letter states.
After Brandin's conversation
on Stanford plans with Hills of
ficials, the letter continues, "We
were left with the impression that
