## 
### Jerry Isenberg 
Legislature voted last night to
transfer funds totalling $027.13,
credited to the now inactive Circle
and Block "S" society, to the ac
count of t lie newly-formed Stan
ford Student Athletic Assn.
A motion to place restriction on
the use of the funds was defeated.
Legislature also approved an
amendment to the ASSU consti
tution, in an effort to clarify the
duties and jurisdiction of Publica
tions Board. The amendment now
defines those publications subject
to Publications Board approval as
all publishing projects which con
tain advertising and by which an
individual or organization receives
income.
According to student financial
manager Bob Best, the amend
ment is intended to block the
attempt of any group to circum
vent Publications Board and
LASSU approval by dispersing
profits from publication through
salaries.
