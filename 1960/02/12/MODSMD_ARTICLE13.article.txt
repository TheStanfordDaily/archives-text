# SU's College Spirit Impresses Brazilians
## 
### Daryl Glenney 
Four Brazilian student leaders
visited the Stanford campus this
week, participating first-hand in
American college life and offering
thought - provoking views on
everything from South American
universities to world politics.
Carlos Rubens Assis, Mario
Ernesto Humberg, Farid Libos,
and Sergio Almeida Rodrigues, all
student body presidents of uni
versities in Brazil, are part of a
10-man group touring several
United States cities and univer
sities, at the invitation of the
State Department, to help pro
mote international understanding.
They were accompanied by Maria
Volanda Umburanas, a State De
partment interpreter.
Principal Complaint
A principal complaint against
America's foreign aid policy is
that it is executed for the in
terest of America rather than
Brazil, the students asserted.
Brazilians are critical of the
American Embassy for continued
interference in economic affairs,
threatening to stop American aid.
"Economically, Russia and the
United States are taking different
roads to the same place." one stu
dent asserted. He said that Brazil
would probably maintain a mid
dle course between the two.
In addition to touring the Medi
cal Central and other campus
sites, the Brazilian group visited
several classes and some student
, body organization meetings.

Wednesday night they had dinner
at the Theta Chi house and at
tended a fraternity party later
in the evening.
"We were immediately im
pressed by your college spirit,"
said one of the students, and the
others concurred that the pride
is justified at Stanford. They
visited Columbia. Harvard. Mass
achusetts Institute of Technology,
and several other Eastern uni
versities before coming to Cali
fornia.
Brazilian Schools
United States universities, are
quite different from those in
Brazil, according to the visitors.
Nearly all Brazilian schools are
state-supported; thus, tuition is
free and students must provide
only meals and housing. South
American university student
bodies are extremely powerful,
jokingly referred to as "the
fourth power of the Republic."
Supported by the government,
student bodies may effectively
control the schools through or
gan/.ed strikes.
Since the schools are state sup
ported, Brazilian universities all
offer the same curriculum and
are very much alike. The visiting
leaders were amazed at the di
versity among American colleges.
Although originally scheduled
to leave Stanford for San Fran
cisco Wednesday, the students
have eagerly extended their st;iy
until tomorrow.

America's foreign aid policy is
that it is executed for the in
terest of America rather than
Brazil, the students asserted.
Brazilians are critical of the
American Embassy for continued
interference in economic affairs,
threatening to stop American aid.
"Economically, Russia and the
United States are taking different
roads to the same place." one stu
dent asserted. He said that Brazil
would probably maintain a mid
dle course between the two.
In addition to touring the Medi
cal Central and other campus
sites, the Brazilian group visited
several classes and some student
, body organization meetings.

Wednesday night they had dinner
at the Theta Chi house and at
tended a fraternity party later
in the evening.
"We were immediately im
pressed by your college spirit,"
said one of the students, and the
others concurred that the pride
is justified at Stanford. They
visited Columbia. Harvard. Mass
achusetts Institute of Technology,
and several other Eastern uni
versities before coming to Cali
fornia.
Brazilian Schools
United States universities, are
quite different from those in
Brazil, according to the visitors.
Nearly all Brazilian schools are
state-supported; thus, tuition is
free and students must provide
only meals and housing. South
American university student
bodies are extremely powerful,
jokingly referred to as "the
fourth power of the Republic."
Supported by the government,
student bodies may effectively
control the schools through or
gan/.ed strikes.
Since the schools are state sup
ported, Brazilian universities all
offer the same curriculum and
are very much alike. The visiting
leaders were amazed at the di
versity among American colleges.
Although originally scheduled
to leave Stanford for San Fran
cisco Wednesday, the students
have eagerly extended their st;iy
until tomorrow.
