# Welcome Kennedy
## 
### 
Toda\ Stanford hears Senator John F. Kennedy, a lending con
tender for the Democratic noniinution for President. A series of
primarv elections, the convention battle. and the nationul election
all stand between kenncdv and the Presidency; yet it is well, espe
ciallv at this time, to consider his qualifications for the office and
his views on the important issues.
Kennedy is an extremely young man tÂ«> aim so high. At 12. lie
won Id he the voungesl President e\er elected: yet lie is an active
worker who as a Senator has performed main services for his
country.
The Labor Hill which he sponsored was notable in that it
neither punished ihe lahor movement for the corruption of a few,
nor condoned those who used the unions for their own advantage.
It is unfortunate that Kenned) and Humphrey are the only
announced candidates for the nomination. These men, hoth lib
erals, will have little to debate in the primaries, and little choice
will he presented In the people. The primaries promise to degen
erate into a popularity contest between these two.
Kennedy's plea for all interested candidates to enter the pri
maries is indeed well taken. It must he discouraging for a candi
date to devote his time and money to primary elections and be
defeated in the Convention by a machine nominee.
Let us hope that the Demorcatic primaries of 1960 will be con
clusive enough to eliminate the possibility of a darkhorse candi
date.
We are happy to welcome Kennedy to Stanford and hope that
more national political leaders vvill find the Stanford campus a
stimulating forum for their ideas.
