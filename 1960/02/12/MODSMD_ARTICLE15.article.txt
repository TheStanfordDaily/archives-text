Reform of Stanford's quarter system mav well begin with a
reappraisal of the midterm. But this is onl\ a start, and the revi
sion could easily be carried into the courses themselves.
The atomi/ation of the student's academic life reflected in the
midterm system is aggravated h\ the number of two- and three
unit courses offered each quarter.
Ten weeks is a comparatively short period in which to pain
an\ more than a superficial understanding of the material offered
in several low-unit courses.
The student's time would be more advantageously spent on
three five-unit courses per qutrter. Fxisting two- and three-unit
courses should he combined wherever possible with related sub
jects.
Such a condensation of subject matter would allow the student
to pain a much needed perspective and to relate the material
more elearlv to his previous academic experience.
One of the most important advantages to be gained from such
a revision would he a more organized and productive arrange
ment of the student's time. The usually wasted hours between
classes would he eliminated, and the student could plan for
larger uninterrupted blocks of study time.
Instead of being bombarded with perfunctory oral reports and
papers in addition to his regular exams, he would have adequate
time to research and prepare his most important papers.
Final examinations would he reduced in number and increased
in scope. The result would be the combining of fractions into a
more meaningful whole.
A quarter comprised of hut three classes should enable the
student to see more clearls where his education is leading. Faced
with fewer courses from which to choose, the student's efforts
would be more concentrated and directed and his academic life
more logically arranged.
The elimination of low-unit courses has inherent advantages
for the faculty and administration as well as for the students.
Many of the benefits for the faculty are similar to those for the
students.
Although a professor would be teaching the same number of
units, his efforts would he concentrated on fewer courses. A re
duction in the number of courses would allow a professor to
transfer the time spent preparing two sets of exams and hook
lists to the organization of a single .lecture series and student
conferences.
For the administration, organization and scheduling problems
would be great I) reduced and the grading system simplified.
Il might be argued that proposed revision would disrupt the
General Studies Program. However, since the program is intend
ed to provide the student with a broad, general background, it
would seem logical that an integrated pattern of comprehensive
courses would better suit the purpose of the program.
Man\ low-unit courses in the humanities and social sciences
could be profitably incorporated into the Senior (lolloquia pro
gram. Other courses incapable of either expansion or integration
would seem not worthwhile and conlribute'onl\ to the present
tendency toward intellectual dilettantism.
