## Icelandic Politics 
### Dick White Contributing Editor 
Iceland as a nation is relatively
remote to most Americans; yet
thousands were stationed there
| during World War 11, and at the
present time more than 5,000
army, navy and air force person
nel still remain. They maintain
the Keflavik Air Base and Radar
Station for the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
Iceland was a charter mem
ber of NATO, but having no*
army or navy must rely on for
eign troops to mail all of her
military installations. This is
the cause of most of her con
flicts with the United States.
Iceland's experiences in NATO
have been one series of embar
rassing events after another. Her
citizens have been humiliated,
and her sovereignty ignored. A
crisis in international politics has
arisen as a result of these inci
dents.
In 1956, the ruling Progressive
| Conservative coalition cabinet of
j Olafur Thors split over the ques
| tion of continued participation in
NATO. The Conservatives with
one-third of the seats in the Al
| thing, Iceland's parliament,
wanted to remain allied with
! NATO; the Progressives with
one-third of the seats called for
I withdrawal of all foreign troops
as did the Socialists and the
I Labor Party (Communists) each
i with one-sixth of the seats.
A cabinet crisis developed,
and a special election was called
for July, 1956. The results of
the voting gave the Conserva
tives 19 seats, the Progressives
17, the Socialists 8, and the
Labor Party 8.
The new coalition government
of Herman Jonsson, Progressive,
called for the withdrawal of
NATO forces. However, the Hun
garian Revolution of November
i 1956 caused the politicians to re
consider and ask for continued
American support. Only the Com
munists pressed for withdrawal
from all military alliances.
In 1957, the Althing passed an
income tax bill, the first in Ice
land's history. The people reacted
violently, not only by protesting
but also by refusing to pay. More
than 10 per cent of the income
from this source was spent col
lecting it. The Socialists who
originally favored the bill turned
against it, and in December, 1958.

Kmil Jonsson and the seven
other Socialist legislators form
ed a minority cabinet supported
only by (lie Conservatives and
scheduled elections for June,
1050, to vole on a constitutional
amendment. Iceland up to then
luid been ruled by legislators
elected from districts.
The amendment supported by
Conservatives, Socialists, and
Communists called for the estab
lishment of proportional repre
sentation in seven large districts
and enlargement of the Althing
to 60 members. It was aimed pri
marily at the Progressives whose
main strength was in the small
rural districts. The amendment
carried the popular vote and spec
ial elections were scheduled for
October to selecl members of the
newly designed Althing.
In this election, the Progres
sives and Communists called
for the withdrawal of all for
eign troops from Iceland and
continuance of the income tav,
while the Conservatives and So
cialists favored support of
NATO and elimination of the
income tax.
The election gave the Conserva
tive-Socialist coalition of Olafur
Thors a majority of seats. The
income tax was repealed, and
Iceland has remained, if some
what less than whole-hearted, a
member of NATO.
As may be seen from this short
analysis of current Icelandic
events, politics on this northern
island is indeed a series of shift
ing alliances. Conservatives and
Socialists work together in a

present. Democracy in Iceland
has a stable base in a people
with a long history and a

Iceland was a charter mem
ber of NATO, but having no*
army or navy must rely on for
eign troops to mail all of her
military installations. This is
the cause of most of her con
flicts with the United States.
Iceland's experiences in NATO
have been one series of embar
rassing events after another. Her
citizens have been humiliated,
and her sovereignty ignored. A
crisis in international politics has
arisen as a result of these inci
dents.
In 1956, the ruling Progressive
| Conservative coalition cabinet of
j Olafur Thors split over the ques
| tion of continued participation in
NATO. The Conservatives with
one-third of the seats in the Al
| thing, Iceland's parliament,
wanted to remain allied with
! NATO; the Progressives with
one-third of the seats called for
I withdrawal of all foreign troops
as did the Socialists and the
I Labor Party (Communists) each
i with one-sixth of the seats.
A cabinet crisis developed,
and a special election was called
for July, 1956. The results of
the voting gave the Conserva
tives 19 seats, the Progressives
17, the Socialists 8, and the
Labor Party 8.
The new coalition government
of Herman Jonsson, Progressive,
called for the withdrawal of
NATO forces. However, the Hun
garian Revolution of November
i 1956 caused the politicians to re
consider and ask for continued
American support. Only the Com
munists pressed for withdrawal
from all military alliances.
In 1957, the Althing passed an
income tax bill, the first in Ice
land's history. The people reacted
violently, not only by protesting
but also by refusing to pay. More
than 10 per cent of the income
from this source was spent col
lecting it. The Socialists who
originally favored the bill turned
against it, and in December, 1958.

liho Progressive-Socialist-Commu
| nisi coalition split and collapsed.
Kmil Jonsson and the seven
other Socialist legislators form
ed a minority cabinet supported
only by (lie Conservatives and
scheduled elections for June,
1050, to vole on a constitutional
amendment. Iceland up to then
luid been ruled by legislators
elected from districts.
The amendment supported by
Conservatives, Socialists, and
Communists called for the estab
lishment of proportional repre
sentation in seven large districts
and enlargement of the Althing
to 60 members. It was aimed pri
marily at the Progressives whose
main strength was in the small
rural districts. The amendment
carried the popular vote and spec
ial elections were scheduled for
October to selecl members of the
newly designed Althing.
In this election, the Progres
sives and Communists called
for the withdrawal of all for
eign troops from Iceland and
continuance of the income tav,
while the Conservatives and So
cialists favored support of
NATO and elimination of the
income tax.
The election gave the Conserva
tive-Socialist coalition of Olafur
Thors a majority of seats. The
income tax was repealed, and
Iceland has remained, if some
what less than whole-hearted, a
member of NATO.
As may be seen from this short
analysis of current Icelandic
events, politics on this northern
island is indeed a series of shift
ing alliances. Conservatives and
Socialists work together in a
I coalition government while a
; Communist is Speaker of the
! Lower Chamber, a Progressive
! the Speaker of the Upper one.
Political activity is conducted
on a high plane devoid of (lie
name calling and emotionalism
we experience in America. Is
sues are presented to the vot
ers; a decision is made; and life
continues. Friendships last even
though radical differences are
present. Democracy in Iceland
has a stable base in a people
with a long history and a
strong desire for freedom.
Iceland as a nation is relatively
remote to most Americans; yet
thousands were stationed there
| during World War 11, and at the
present time more than 5,000
army, navy and air force person
nel still remain. They maintain
the Keflavik Air Base and Radar
Station for the North Atlantic
