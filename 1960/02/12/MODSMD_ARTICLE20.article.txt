# KENNEDY
## Religion a Major Issue? 
### John Gustafson 
Massachusetts' Senator John
"Fighting Jack" Kennedy is at
Stanford today on part of a live
state speaking tour aimed at
helping his capture of the Demo
cratic Presidential nomination.
Because of his religion, man
ner and political strategy, this
man has been a topic of heated
political discussion for the past
year.
Kennedy's Senate record has
been generally that of a liberal
Democrat. He is for federal aid
to education, aid to underdevel
oped countries and public power.
He became well known for his
part in the investigations of
racketeering in labor union.
Roman Catholic
But what sets this Democratic
Senator apart from most is that
he is the first major Roman
Catholic candidate to try for the
presidential nomination since A 1
Smith in 1928.
Kennedy stated his view on the
relation between religious beliefs
and governmental d u t y 1 a s t
spring in an article in Look Mag
azine.
At that time he said, "What
ever a person's religion in private
life may be, nothing takes prece
dence over his oath to the Con
stitution.
One Catholic publication re
sponded, "Kennedy really doesn't
believe that. No religious man, be
he Catholic, Protestant, or Jew
holds such an opinion. A man's
conscience has a bearing on his
public as well as his private life."
Religious Criticism
Since the religious issue was
brought out Kennedy has been
criticized for his religious con
victions by both Catholics and
Protestants on such "issues" as
birth control and interfaith
chapels.
Will Kennedy's religion , hurt
hiin in his bid for President? This
question is almost impossible to

answer until the primary votes j
are in.
The predictions offered by
pollsters are inconclusive and con
fusing. For instance one major
news magazine pointed out that
one out of every four people
would not vote for Kennedy just
because he is Catholic.
Another magazine contended
that religion will only give
marked results in the strongly
Protestant South. Thus all we can
do is wait for the primaries.
It is with the primaries in
mind that Kennedy is making his
present campaign swing. At pres
ent he is squaring off against
Hubert Humphrey in West Vir
ginia, Oregon and Wisconsin and
against Stuart Symington in Ne
braska.
Kennedy wants to win the pri
maries more than other candi
dates because if he is going to
get the Democratic nomination he
must do it in the first few bal
lots of the Los Angeles conven
tion.
Needs Majority
The only way (hat he can win i
an early nomination is to bring
a near-majority delegation to the |
convention, and to do this he 1
must prove himself in the pri-;
maries.
Senator Kennedy must win in :
the first few ballots because he :
is not a compromise candidate.'
He has never been a man to
remain aloof on issues and this
has tended to make some power
ful groups wary of him.
His labor investigations and j
votes or? farm issues have not
alienated these groups, but they
have made live groups mad
enough that if Kennedy does not
win on an early ballot those dele
gates with farm and labor inter
est's may look for more moderate
company, like Missouri's Stuart
Symington.

This quest ionable supp or t
makes California even more im
portant to Kennedy. The Californ
ia delegation will he 81 strong.
If Kennedy enters the spring pri
mary and lands this delegation,
it would do much to help him to
an early presidential nomination.
Brown Supporters
However, the supporters of
Governor Brown would prefer
that Kennedy keep out of the pri
mary, and let favorite son Brown
bring the California contingent
to the convention.
But can Senator Kennedy af
ford not to enter the California
primary? He can use and may
need those SI votes to get the
nomination. Maybe his speech to
day will give us some hint of his
intent ions.
