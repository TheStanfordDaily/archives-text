# Indians Face Invasion Of Southland Powers
## Daily Sports 
### Roy Schmidt 
Stanford's hustling Indians set
their sights on second place to
night when they take on the
UCLA Bruins in the Pavilion at
H. The Cards are in for a rugged
weekend, with powerful South
ern California moving in for the
Saturday night encounter.
UCLA, which now boasts a 4-1
record, leads the Indians by a full
game, but a Stanford win tonight
would deadlock the two teams.
Bruins boast a well rounded at
tack and usually have Ihoir scor
ing evenly distributed among
several players.
Berberich Tops
Junior center John Berberich
leads in that department with a
10.9 average followed by Kent
Miller, with 10.
UCLA ended a three-game win

ning streak for the Indians last
weekend when they rolled to a 67-
54 victory. Coach John YVooden's
club should be oven stronger with
the return of Miller, who has
missed the last four games with
a sprained ankle. The 6-6 for
ward is one of the strongest
board men in the league and car
ries a big load in the UCLA at
tack.
The rest of the Bruin starting
lineup will be either Gary Cun
ningham or Pete Blackmen at the
other forward, and John Green
and Bill Ellis in the backcourt.
Winning Combo
Indian Coach Howie Dallmar
will undoubtedly stick with his
winning combination of John
Arrillaga and Bub Bowling ;it
guards, John Hendry and John
Windsor at forwards, and Neal
Brockmever at center.
Southern California invades the
Bay Area without the services of
its leading scorer, All-Coast for
ward John Werhas. The 6-3 sen
ior is suffering from a back ail
ment.
Asliby to Play
Werhas' corner position will be
filled by Vern Ashby, a 6-4 sopho
more with tremendous spring.
Seeing limited action this season.
Ashby has hit ."50 per cent of his
shots from the floor but has
tallied only 36 points in 14 games.
Big threat for the Trojans will
be 6-7 forward John Rudometkin,
a sophomore transfer from junior
college. Rudometkin is a good
boardman and has exceptional
touch.

In the backcourt the Trojans
will go wilh Jerry Pimm and
either Chris Appel or Steve
Kemp. SC will have an able re
servo in the backcourt with senior
Bill Bloom on the bench.
The Trojans have dropped their
last two in a row to Stanford and
Washington and now have a 3-4
record.

Saturday night encounter.
UCLA, which now boasts a 4-1
record, leads the Indians by a full
game, but a Stanford win tonight
would deadlock the two teams.
Bruins boast a well rounded at
tack and usually have Ihoir scor
ing evenly distributed among
several players.
Berberich Tops
Junior center John Berberich
leads in that department with a
10.9 average followed by Kent
Miller, with 10.
UCLA ended a three-game win

ning streak for the Indians last
weekend when they rolled to a 67-
54 victory. Coach John YVooden's
club should be oven stronger with
the return of Miller, who has
missed the last four games with
a sprained ankle. The 6-6 for
ward is one of the strongest
board men in the league and car
ries a big load in the UCLA at
tack.
The rest of the Bruin starting
lineup will be either Gary Cun
ningham or Pete Blackmen at the
other forward, and John Green
and Bill Ellis in the backcourt.
Winning Combo
Indian Coach Howie Dallmar
will undoubtedly stick with his
winning combination of John
Arrillaga and Bub Bowling ;it
guards, John Hendry and John
Windsor at forwards, and Neal
Brockmever at center.
Southern California invades the
Bay Area without the services of
its leading scorer, All-Coast for
ward John Werhas. The 6-3 sen
ior is suffering from a back ail
ment.
Asliby to Play
Werhas' corner position will be
filled by Vern Ashby, a 6-4 sopho
more with tremendous spring.
Seeing limited action this season.
Ashby has hit ."50 per cent of his
shots from the floor but has
tallied only 36 points in 14 games.
Big threat for the Trojans will
be 6-7 forward John Rudometkin,
a sophomore transfer from junior
college. Rudometkin is a good
boardman and has exceptional
touch.

In the backcourt the Trojans
will go wilh Jerry Pimm and
either Chris Appel or Steve
Kemp. SC will have an able re
servo in the backcourt with senior
Bill Bloom on the bench.
The Trojans have dropped their
last two in a row to Stanford and
Washington and now have a 3-4
record.
