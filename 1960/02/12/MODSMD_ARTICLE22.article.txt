# Stanford Rugby Team Set For Untried Trojan Squad
## 
### 
Stanford's Indian ruggers will
be out after the second win of
the yet young rugby season when
they take on the USC Trojans in
a non-league affair at two o'clock
Saturday on the Stanford rugby
field.
The Trojans are reviving rugby

this season for the first lime in
about fifteen years, and as yet
they are untried, so the Cards will
know little about the USC squad
they are to meet.
Appearing among the Trojans
is footballer A 1 Prukop, operating
from the center 3/4 position.
Other gridders on the USC
team are Marv Marinovich at
lock, Ben Rosen at a breakaway
spot, Carl Skarvarna at one 5/8
position, and Mike Bundra at a
I second team lock spot.
The Indians, who have yet to
win a league test, show a season
record of one win. one loss, and
one tie. The win came against
UCLA Bruins, the tie with the
Olympic Club of San Francisco,
and the loss to the Athens Club
of Oakland.
The Card Ruggers, under coach
Pete Kmetovie, will field a start
ing team including Kyrk Reid at
hooker, Rod Sears at fullback,
and Skip Face at one wing spot.
Others on the Indians starting
unit will be Cap Ingham, Don
Peter, Jon Brandon. Gary Pike,
Tom McDonald, Dick Takaki,
Rich Hearney, Dave Scholz, Sid
Garber, Armand Jaques, and
Rick McMillen.
