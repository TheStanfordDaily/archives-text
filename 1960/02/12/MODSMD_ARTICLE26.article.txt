# LA 						INDOOR GAMES
## Sinkers Go South 
### 
A substantial delegation from
the Stanford track squad will
journey south this weekend to
participate in the Los Angeles
Times Indoor games. The meet

I is set for Saturday in the new
I L.A. Sports Arena.
The Tribe will have contestants
in the mile, two mile, high hurd
les and the mile and two mile
: relay.
The two-mile relay may turn
; out to be a thriller, and its' just
possible that the world's indoor
! record will fall.
The Tribe's main competition
in this event will come from
the University of Michigan which
last year put together a team
that ran the relay in 7:39, just
six second off the world mark.
Stanford's fastest time outdoors
last year was 7:25.7. Both schools
have three of last year's men
back, so by giving each other
; the added push that stiff com
' petition often provides, the world
i indoor mark may be broken.
\ Going in the mile will be Bertil
Lundh, whose top time is 4:11.4,
second best in Stanford history.
In the two mile will be Bob Mon-
I zingo, whose clocking of 9:10.7

Martin will compete. Going in the
i mile relay are Norm Pease, Rich
I Parker, Christ Hungerland and
