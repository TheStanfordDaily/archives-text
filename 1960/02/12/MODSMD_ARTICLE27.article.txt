# Cards Travel South to Meet UCLA, Troy
## 
### 
Stanford's swim squad, top dog
for many years in the new extinct
PCC, travels south today to battle
the coast's present titan, Southern
Cal.
The meet will begin at 3:30 this
afternoon. As an anti-climax to
the Trojan meet, the Indians will
swim against UCLA, at West
wood at 10 Saturday morning.
The Trojans, ineligible for last
year's NCAA title, almost doubled
the second place team's points
in winning the AAU Men's Out
floor Swim Championships in
1959. Meanwhile the SC Frosh, a
synonym for Lance Larson who
scored all the points, were quietly
knocking off sixth place.
The only events in which Stan
ford appears to have a chance are
the breaststroke and individual
medley.
SC is almost completely lacking
in the breaststroke. The Indians
meanwhile have the one-l wo
places from last year's PCC meet
in Tom Peterson and Jim Cooper
respectively.
In the 200-yard individual med
ley, Stanford's George Harrison,
NCAA record holder for the event
at 2:25.7, is expected to edge out
Troy's Larson.
UCLA should provide no com
petition at all for the battle weary
Indians Saturday morning. The
Bruins showed little spark in cap
turing third place from Cal in last
year's PCC, and should be in
about the same shape this year.
