# Dedication Ceremonies Mark Opening of P.O.
## 
### 
The new Post Office, after its rather "amphibious opening"
on Monday, was formally presented lo the University yesterday
morning in a dedication and flag-raising ceremony held in front
of the structure.
Ralph T. Wills, Deputy Executive Assistant Postmaster General,
came from Washington, D.C., to make the official dedication. Em
phasizing the importance of the Postal Department, Wills said that
"the social structure of today relies heavily upon the speed and
efficiency of postal communications."
Wills said the Postal Department has effected many improve
ments in the past six years and the building of a new post office j
at Stanford is a "projection of the faith the United States govern- |
ment has in the wealth and prosperity of this district."
Commenting upon the architecture of the new building, Wills |

| said he had "never seen a build
ing which fitted more perfectly j
! with its locale."
President of the Board of
I Trustees David Packard also;
spoke. Recalling his days as a
i student here, Packard referred to
'the post office as a "symbol of'
i the close association of the hni-:
versity here with the country at
large, providing a continuing tie
I with home and loved ones."
i
Packard drew a series of com
parisons between a university and
a post office. Both he felt are
j taken too much for granted. He
stressed, however, that Stanford!
is recognizing the importance of
; the post office in the lives of the
students by placing it in the mid
: die of the heaviest campus traffic. 1
Next, Robert Fahs, Deputy
Regional Operations Director of
! San Francisco, read a letter from j
| the Postmaster General which
congratulated the citizens of Stan
ford and Palo Alto upon the dedi
cation and presented them with a j
flag to mark the occasion.
The flag was then raised by
members of the Stanford ROTC,
' ending the ceremonies.
Ralph Evans, Postmaster of
| Palo Alto, and John Callahan, |
Stanford Branch Superintendent,
I were also present.
