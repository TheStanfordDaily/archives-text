The Citizen's Committee for
Gassing Chessman (CCGC)
launched iis gigantic Stanford
campaign last night. Only they
decided not to gas him.
Before a restless mob of
nearly 60 people in front of the
Main I,ibo. an unidentified (?)
rabble-rouser reminded his fel
low Americans that we must
not let such a subversive char
acter run loose in San Quentin
and destroy the rugged individ
ualism of fellow inmates.
It was suggested, therefore,
that Caryl be set free to roam
about the other-directed society
as he gleefully did some years
back.
Swept up in the overwhelm
ing wave of public spirit, the
mob dispersed for the evening,
reportedly taking up a collection
to send Caryl a gas mask. Just
in case, you know.
