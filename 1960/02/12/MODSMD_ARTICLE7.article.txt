One of the two announced Democratic presidential-hopeful bandwagons rolls onto campus today,
bearing Sen. John F. Kennedy for a speech in Memorial Auditorium.
The talk is slated to begin as soon as Kennedy arrives from San Francisco International Airport,
sometime between 12:30 and 12:45 p.m.
Ted Hicks, president of the Stanford Political Union, which is sponsoring the appearance, said

yesterday that only students and
faculty members will be admitted
to Mem And before 12:30,
If any seats remain then, the
doors will open to the public.
Kennedy's Stanford talk will be
the only one he will deliver in the
Bay Area on a tour through the
1 West. He is on his way from a
! speech in Portland last night to a
meeting of the California Demo
! cratic Council in Fresno this
j afternoon.
The only other entrant in the
i donkey sweepstakes, Minnesota's
Sen. Hubert Humphrey, also will

I be in attendance at the Fresno
! conference.
It is expected that Kennedy's
extemporaneous address will last
i about 40 minutes.
The youthful (42t Massachu
! setts senator attended Stanford's
Graduate School of Business
1 briefly in 1940 before enlisting
I in the Navy.
Kennedy supporters expect his
•speech to be a highly political
! campaign talk.
j Political observers believe Ken-
I nedy will be taking soundings
! throughout his California swing
j on the extent of his support in
this state.
His findings will probably, to a
large extent, determine whether
Ihe enters the California Demo
| cratic primary against Gov. Pat
! Brown. He said earlier this week
! he will decide next month whether
! to oppose Brown.
Humphrey said Wednesday ho
i will not enter the California con
j test "unless somebody else does."
! That somebody else obviously is
I Kennedy.
