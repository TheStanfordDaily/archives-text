# MELODRAMA
## Gaslight Drama Is Lively, Entertaining 
### Camille de Campos 
"Under (he Gaslight" may not appear to modern audiences to
bo a "totally original and picturesque drama," as described by play
wright August in Daly in 1807. However, the Ram's Head winter
production does succeed in providing lively entertainment under
the direction of Judy Schrader.
Doug Johnson, as Byke, is the suavest villian to tread the boards

Men stage in a long time. He is a
thoroughgoing blackguard who
has neither money nor scruples.
Johnson's timing and range of
expression make his role the most
important one in the show.
Sue Stockbridge is properly
; heart-rending in the part of
Laura, who on several occasions
is required to cry out, "Only
Heaven can help mc now!" How
ever, she so capably overcomes
the vicissitudes which beset her
that it almost seems inconsistent
: with her tender character.
Heartless
Pearl, pretty but heartless, is
; played by Bonnie Baldwin. She is
a charming addition to the stage
settings, and her performance, a
little stilted at first, is adequate.
Trafford, the hero and one of
the New York "bloods," is played
by Tom Jolly. He handles the
character capably and in an ap
pealing manner.
On hand to aid the hero is Russ
■ Coombs who admirably plays the
part of Snorky in true melo
dramatic fashion. Sally Pence
performs as the bedraggled and
scheming villainess, Old Judas,
pouncing on her victims with an
j obvious zest for her evil tasks.
Both Sam Reis and Miles Win
-1 bigler do notable jobs in their
minor roles.
Notable Minors
On the debit side, however, the
show is long and tends to become
tedious. While it is melodrama,
I the performers occasionally lapse
j into serving too much ham but no
! meat.
"Under the Gaslight" is a period
piece and, as such, may suffer.
i But it also provides a type of fun
not often seen on modern stages.
Shows continue tonight and to
morrow night at 8:30.

settings, and her performance, a
little stilted at first, is adequate.
Trafford, the hero and one of
the New York "bloods," is played
by Tom Jolly. He handles the
character capably and in an ap
pealing manner.
On hand to aid the hero is Russ
■ Coombs who admirably plays the
part of Snorky in true melo
dramatic fashion. Sally Pence
performs as the bedraggled and
scheming villainess, Old Judas,
pouncing on her victims with an
j obvious zest for her evil tasks.
Both Sam Reis and Miles Win
-1 bigler do notable jobs in their
minor roles.
Notable Minors
On the debit side, however, the
show is long and tends to become
tedious. While it is melodrama,
I the performers occasionally lapse
j into serving too much ham but no
! meat.
"Under the Gaslight" is a period
piece and, as such, may suffer.
i But it also provides a type of fun
not often seen on modern stages.
Shows continue tonight and to
morrow night at 8:30.
"Under (he Gaslight" may not appear to modern audiences to
bo a "totally original and picturesque drama," as described by play
wright August in Daly in 1807. However, the Ram's Head winter
production does succeed in providing lively entertainment under
the direction of Judy Schrader.
Doug Johnson, as Byke, is the suavest villian to tread the boards

Men stage in a long time. He is a
thoroughgoing blackguard who
has neither money nor scruples.
Johnson's timing and range of
expression make his role the most
important one in the show.
Sue Stockbridge is properly
; heart-rending in the part of
Laura, who on several occasions
is required to cry out, "Only
Heaven can help mc now!" How
ever, she so capably overcomes
the vicissitudes which beset her
that it almost seems inconsistent
: with her tender character.
Heartless
Pearl, pretty but heartless, is
; played by Bonnie Baldwin. She is
a charming addition to the stage
settings, and her performance, a
little stilted at first, is adequate.
