## 
### 
BUENOS AIIIKS. Argentina (A J i An Argentina sea and air
task force stepped up its attacks yesterday on two mystery subma
rines believe lurking in Golfo Nuovo, indicating the climatic as
sault had begun.
Reports from the scene 650 miles southwest of Buenos Aires

said five warships opened up Sat
urday night with powerful new
depth bombs flown from the Unit
ed Stales. Planes joined in the
attack a.; daylight broke.
Navy officers said a second
submarine slipped daringly past
the heavily guarded mouth of the
gulf on Saturday to aid a com
rade submarine that apparently
was crippled by depth charges
from Argentine warships.
The navy believes this subma
rine is trying to distract attention
from the wounded submarine,
which may be undergoing repairs
in the hope of making a final
dash to the open Atlantic.
.Matter of Time
Rear Adm. Gaston Clement, the
navy secretary, predicted a cli
max "in a matter of hours" in
the grim 16-day-old game of hide
and seek.
Five warships began their
depth-charge assault yesterday
near Punta Piramide, along the
northern shores of the gulf.
Two big U.S. Globemaster trans
port planes flew in a cargo of
modern depth charges capable
of reaching the deepest parts of
the 20x40 • mile gulf Saturday
along with sonar detection gear
and flares. Argentine planes flew
the cargo on to Puerto Madryn on
the gulf.
Decisive Role
An Argentine naval source pre
dicted the U.S. equipment would
play a decisive role in the assault.
The sources said Argentine war
ships, some of which date back
to World War I.and planes have
been handicapped by outdated
equipment in the hunt for the
modern submalines.
The government and navy have
refused to speculate on the na
tionality of the submarines, but.
■some military and civilian offi
cials believe they are Soviet. Brit
ain and the United States say
i hey have no knowledge of any of
their submarines being in the
area.
Several pilots said they have
heard messages between the sub
marines and friendly craft pre
sumably other submarines wait
ings somewhere out in the Atlan
tic. Some messages are in code..
Pilots' Report
The pilots report other mess
ages are in what is supposed to
be Yankee slang. But they -say it
is poor slang and apparently is
used to try to confuse the hunt
ers. The United States says it has
no information of any of its sub
marines being in thrs area. The
Soviets have said nothing.
Navy sources here say the
speed of the first 'submarine,
whose propellers were believed
damaged by depth charges, has
dropped from 20 knots to about
nine.
