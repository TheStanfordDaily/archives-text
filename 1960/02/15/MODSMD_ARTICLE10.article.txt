### Fran Fisher 
A team of five Stanford pro
fessors, headed by Dr. William
Odell of the Stanford Department
of Education, has been helping
the Hawaiian school system in
the state's transition from terri
torial status to statehood.
In July 1956, Samuel W. King,
then Governor of Hawaii, ap
pointed Dr. Odell to examine the
Hawaiian Department (it Public
Instruction in view of Hawaii';
possibly becoming a stale.
Problems of organization, poli
tical control and enrollment in
creases faced Odell and his staff,
which included Stanford profes
sors Paul R. Hanna, J. Russell
Kent, James I). MaeConnell and
Henry B. Mac Daniel.
Unique System
Hawaii has a unique school sys
tem in which the state runs all
the schools. In this highly cen
irali/.ed system, no local school
boards exist as they do in other
stales; consequently there is little
11, ii tit i pa l ii in <iI l.iy |te( iple in I lie

j school system. Odell and his staff
i recommend more of the type of
decentralization whi eh would
, allow the people more control
over their schools.
The political party strife in
i Hawaii has penetrated into the
j school system, with Republicans
and Democrats battling over
credit for school improvements, a
j battle which "can easily result in
a stalemate in which the schools
I suffer needlessly," Odell's staff
stated in its report. They recom
mended thai the commissioners be
selected on a non-partisan basis.
Big Increases
i Tremendous enrollment increas
es have added to Hawaii's school
nroblems. Between 1910 and 19 .">(),
Hawaii's s c hool population in
creased 365 per cent, nearly nine
times the increase on the main
land. Because of Hawaii's rapidly
rising land prices, the research
slaff emphasized the need to ac
quire building sites as early as
possible to meet the needs of the
i expanding popttlal ion.

Numerous other recommenda
tions made by Odell's committee
pointed in the direction in which
they felt solution to these school
problems could be found.
Salary
Results of the recommendations
are already beginning to appear,
for substantial increases in fac
ulty salaries have occurred, a step
strongly advised because of the
large turnover of teachers and
principals in Hawaiian schools.
Other results have been found
in the added specialists in the
Department of Public Instruction
These people are able to give
more time than before to such
subjects as foreign languages, so
cial sciences, mathematics and
science.

Unique System
Hawaii has a unique school sys
tem in which the state runs all
the schools. In this highly cen
irali/.ed system, no local school
boards exist as they do in other
stales; consequently there is little
11, ii tit i pa l ii in <iI l.iy |te( iple in I lie

j school system. Odell and his staff
i recommend more of the type of
decentralization whi eh would
, allow the people more control
over their schools.
The political party strife in
i Hawaii has penetrated into the
j school system, with Republicans
and Democrats battling over
credit for school improvements, a
j battle which "can easily result in
a stalemate in which the schools
I suffer needlessly," Odell's staff
stated in its report. They recom
mended thai the commissioners be
selected on a non-partisan basis.
Big Increases
i Tremendous enrollment increas
es have added to Hawaii's school
nroblems. Between 1910 and 19 .">(),
Hawaii's s c hool population in
creased 365 per cent, nearly nine
times the increase on the main
land. Because of Hawaii's rapidly
rising land prices, the research
slaff emphasized the need to ac
quire building sites as early as
possible to meet the needs of the
i expanding popttlal ion.

Numerous other recommenda
tions made by Odell's committee
pointed in the direction in which
they felt solution to these school
problems could be found.
Salary
Results of the recommendations
are already beginning to appear,
for substantial increases in fac
ulty salaries have occurred, a step
strongly advised because of the
large turnover of teachers and
principals in Hawaiian schools.
Other results have been found
in the added specialists in the
Department of Public Instruction
These people are able to give
more time than before to such
subjects as foreign languages, so
cial sciences, mathematics and
science.

A team of five Stanford pro

Odell of the Stanford Department
of Education, has been helping
the Hawaiian school system in
the state's transition from terri
torial status to statehood.
In July 1956, Samuel W. King,
then Governor of Hawaii, ap
pointed Dr. Odell to examine the
Hawaiian Department (it Public
Instruction in view of Hawaii';
possibly becoming a stale.
Problems of organization, poli
