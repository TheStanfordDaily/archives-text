# Unneeded Chaos
## 
### 
Il was very unfortunate that only 2,(10(1 students ami faculty
were able to hear Senator John Kennedy"s speech on I' riday. (Iv er
1500 people were turned awa\ because of inadequate seating j
facilities in Memorial Auditorium.
The chaos which resulted from the large crowd clamoring to I
get iu was a result of the miscalculation of the prospective attend
ance b\ the sponsoring organization, Political I nion. Some provi
sion should have been made in ease of a large overflow.
Frost Amphitheater would have held a sufficient number,
although il would have meant silting on the wet ground, an in
convenience the 1500 people outside Mem Ami would have gladly
endured. In bad weather, the speech could have been moved in
side to the Pavilion and chairs set upon a canvas over the floor.
However, Political I nion should not receive the entire hlamc
for the situation which occurred. The student body also must
share some rcsponsihilily for the lack of space.
Other equallv important speakers have drawn relatively small
crowds which have not even filled Mem Ami. Some notable ex
amples of this year are Averell llarriman and Madame Pandit,
while earlier Kleanor Roosevelt, Paul Duller, and ( lenient \tllee
have not had startling attendance.
I 111 is il was quite difficult for Political I nion to predict the
size of the crowd when in the past student interest has not been!
so great Iv aroused for other speakers of comparable stature.
Moreover, Political Union merits some commendation for pro
curing Kennedy to talk here. The difficulties involved were nu
merous, and il took much time and many arrangements before |
Kennedv finallv stepped out on the stage Friday.
I lie fiasco at Mem And should serve ;is an example for any
organization which -ponsors an imporlaul public figure at Stan
ford.
Perhaps free tickets could be distributed ill Mem Ami and on
Quad the week preceding such events. These would be available
to students, faculty and interested outsiders, and even if thev were
not an accurate measure of attendance, they certainly could give
sonic idea of the size of facilities which would be needed.
.
Ihe fortunate 2,000 who managed lo find places in the audi
torium heard a speech which was provocative and entertaining,!
even if it did smack somewhat of a talk given bv Kennedy ;il the
University of Oregon last year.
The Senator presented an effective six-point program which,
although it will he more difficult to carry out than it was to say,
is a necesary step toward improving relations with the Latin Amer
ican countries.
Apparently Kennedy intends lo make the causes of anli-l .S.
feeling in South America a campaign issue, and undoubtedly, an
important issue, since the neglect until recentlv of the countries j
south of the border by the present government cannot be repudi- !
ated.
However, anv president elected in November will face the |
problem of obtaining money from'a reticent Congress lo carrv !
out a more fruitful program in this area without abandoning aid
to other parts of the world.
Another regrettable incident occurred when Kennedv appeared
in front of Mem And after his speech to talk to the wailing crowd.
He spoke for a few minutes and then was hit by a swarm of auto
graph seekers reminiscent of a group of teenagers at an Flvis I
Preslev show.
Kennedy was virtually forced lo fight his way through the
crowd, and upon reaching the car, he remarked that he never!
thought he would make it.
Although Kennedy undoubtedly appreciated the interest and
eagerness show n bv the crowd, he cerlainlv would have been more
impressed by the Stanford student body had thev spent the few
minutes available in asking intelligent questions rather than Irv
ing to get a souvenir lo out on the wall.
