# 200 OFFICERS
## AWS Leadership Group Discusses Student Needs 
### Nancy Fiske 
"The responsibilities of student
leadership require judgment and
experience," said Mrs. Opal David,
women's education authority, in a
group of 200 Associated Women
Students officers on Saturday.
A director on the American
Council of Education, Mrs. David
was keynote speaker in a half-day
leadership conference planned to
acquaint the recently elected offi
cers with the attitude and philoso
phy of student leadership at Stan
ford.
"A leader must therefore learn
the ground rules and play by ear,"
said Mrs. David; "she must recog
nize what kind of situations she
deals with and must suit her ac
tions to the individual situation,
but she must also 'think big'."
Each officer was urged to be
certain of which committee she
served, and to be thoroughly aware
of the functions of her committee.
Small group sessions followed
the address, in which problems of
the varying responsibilities of the
AWS officer were discussed. The
conference reconvened after lunch
to hear informal talks by Admin
istration leaders.
In one session at Jordan House,
Dean of Men Craig and Professor
Robert Walker presented their
views on the relationship between
the University and the living
group.

"Stanford isn't a very good uni
versity, but it's the best there is
around," laughed Walker, speak
ing of "the First Rate University"
Stanford is rapidly becoming. The
ideal of the "good university" de
mands an intellectual atmosphere
| difficult to find in a society whose
i common goals are rarely truth
and wisdom, he said.
An important slop in building
! this atmosphere at Stanford is a
| House System which unites the
classroom and the residence, ac
! cording to (.'raig.
Muir and Burbank houses are
j successful experiments of this
(type, particularly because they
offer a working research library
for residents only "Students
don't have to go to the RBR."
! The faculty resident gives stu
dents an "adult model" he can
test his maturity against mature
individuals, and he has constant
opportunity to participate in "the
I give-and-take of the intellectual
marketplace if ideas."
Sound student leadership is
'essential in the maintenance of the
intellectual atmosphere which is
j often elusive at Stanford. Yet the
AWS Conference left this officer
I with the feeling that leadership,
:as illustrated, primarily is an
affair of circumlocution. Ground
rules had best be learned else
where.

experience," said Mrs. Opal David,
women's education authority, in a
group of 200 Associated Women
Students officers on Saturday.
A director on the American
Council of Education, Mrs. David
was keynote speaker in a half-day
leadership conference planned to
acquaint the recently elected offi
cers with the attitude and philoso
phy of student leadership at Stan
ford.
"A leader must therefore learn
the ground rules and play by ear,"
said Mrs. David; "she must recog
nize what kind of situations she
deals with and must suit her ac
tions to the individual situation,
but she must also 'think big'."
Each officer was urged to be
certain of which committee she
served, and to be thoroughly aware
of the functions of her committee.
Small group sessions followed
the address, in which problems of
the varying responsibilities of the
AWS officer were discussed. The
conference reconvened after lunch
to hear informal talks by Admin
istration leaders.
In one session at Jordan House,
Dean of Men Craig and Professor
Robert Walker presented their
views on the relationship between
the University and the living
group.

"Stanford isn't a very good uni
versity, but it's the best there is
around," laughed Walker, speak
ing of "the First Rate University"
Stanford is rapidly becoming. The
ideal of the "good university" de
mands an intellectual atmosphere
| difficult to find in a society whose
i common goals are rarely truth
and wisdom, he said.
An important slop in building
! this atmosphere at Stanford is a
| House System which unites the
classroom and the residence, ac
! cording to (.'raig.
Muir and Burbank houses are
j successful experiments of this
(type, particularly because they
offer a working research library
for residents only "Students
don't have to go to the RBR."
! The faculty resident gives stu
dents an "adult model" he can
test his maturity against mature
individuals, and he has constant
opportunity to participate in "the
I give-and-take of the intellectual
marketplace if ideas."
Sound student leadership is
'essential in the maintenance of the
intellectual atmosphere which is
j often elusive at Stanford. Yet the
AWS Conference left this officer
I with the feeling that leadership,
:as illustrated, primarily is an
affair of circumlocution. Ground
rules had best be learned else
where.
