# Text of Kennedy's Speech

Kditor's note: The following: is
an excerpt from the speech given
by Senator John Kennedy at Me
morial Auditorium Friday. The
entire text of the speech and the
questions following' it were taped
by KZSI and may be heard over
that station this evening at 8:00.
There is mounting concern in
this country over the inadequacy
of our efforts in Asia, the deteri
oration of our posit ion in the
Middle East, the uncertainty of
our security in Europe and the
impoteney of our program for
Africa.
But no area deserves more al
ien! ion today than the vital area
known as Latin America an
area whose growing needs will be
highlighted during the President's
visit.
Prestige
No oilier area belter symbolizes
(he deterioration in American
prestige since the days of Frank
lin Roosevelt and Harry Truman.
No other area is more strategic
to our national security and our
economic progress. In no other
area has the work of anti-Ameri
can agitators been made more
easy by inconsistent, inconsider
ate and inadequate economic and
diplomatic policies.
In short, our government musl
make as one of iis first orders of
business Ihe adoption of a new
attilude new emphasis - a
new policy for Latin America.
We do not have much lime. The
gap between North America and
Latin America in terms of
living standards, economic stabil
ity and financial independence -
is growing greater every year.
Without stabilized trade and mar
kets, without investment capital
and foreign exchange resources,
without increasing their economic
growth faster lhan their popula
tion the economies of too many
Latin American countries will
flounder between the shoals of
extreme inflation and extreme
depression.
Communist Inspired
If we continue to take our West
ern Hemisphere friends for grant
ed- if we continue to assume
that all anti-American agitation
is Communist inspired if we
continue to believe that most
Latin Americans share our dedi
cation to an anti-Communist cru
sade lo save what we call free
enterprise then ihe tirrto is not
far off when we will learn thai
our enemies are not necessarily
their enemies that their con
cepts of progress are not yet their
concepts and lhal what we pa
tronizingly refer to as our own
"b acky a r d" may well pose a
threat to our security far greater
than that posed by any distant
corner of the globe.

I But despite the growing urgen
! cy of these problems, they have
i been given a very low priority in
| Washington. Latin America has
I been the stepchild in the Depart -
! men! of Stale. The OAS the
Qrganization of American States
has withered in a backseat role.
Many of our Latin American
embassies have been either left
vacant for prolonged periods or
used as a haven for second-rate
appointees. Only a tiny portion of
our foreign aid budget has gone
to this area which like South
east Asia and the Middle East
is also plagued by poverty, insta
bility, anti • Americanism and a
g row in g Communist economic
| offensive.
And too much of even this small
| bit of aid has been in the form of
military assistance, tightening the
grip of unpopular dictatorial gov
ernments and emphasizing the
role of the military in states
which want to be peace loving.
To he sure, during the last im
portant visit to Latin America
when the Vice President of the
United States was stoned, there
was a great deal of talk in Wash
ington about how much would be
done.
Promises
I There were a grea! many prom
i ises and assurances given. But as
I t ho crisis passed from the head
; lines, Ihe assurances were neg
! lected the promises delayed
and even the talk died down.
It will take a new approach to
meet these problems an aware
j noss that a small sum spent now
; could save us billions later a
realization that neither ihe Mon
roe Doctrine nor the old Good
Neighbor Policy of F. D. R. are
adequate for Ihe Latin America
of the next decade.
We need now a new policy
and as a member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee who
served on (he Special Subcommit
tee on Latin American Affairs, I
! would like to take this opportun
ity to recommend Ihe following
! six points:
1. First, the development of a
series of inter American economic
I agreements for the stabilization
i of commodity prices and markets;
! for the convertability of currency;
| and for a mutual adjustment of
i tariff duties and quotas.
2. Second, the enlargement of
I Latin American allocations in the
Development Loan Fund and
; the widest possible use of the new
! Inter-American Capital Develop
ment Bank.
3. Third, Ihe negotiation of in
dividual tax t real ie s, making
allowances for appropriate tax
forgiveness programs in order
| to encourage a greater flow of
! private investment to those Latin

I nations which need American
money, not only in oil and min
| but in the development of
! transportation, power, l'uel and
i water systems, and other indus
j tries.
i 4. Fourth, a new American atti*
I tude on dictators not influenc
' ing voters in their choice of gov
j ernments, hnt emphasizing our
hope that tliey will always bo
able to exercise such a choice
making it clear that we are not
indifferent to human rights and
thai we look with favor upon the
I emergence and continuance of
free governments.
Elevation
5. Fifth, an elevation in the -
role of ihe OAS by using its
i consultative machinery on major i
j world issues as well as routine
intra-homisphere matters.
6. Sixth and finally, a new em
phasis on education and technical ,
assistance including an increase
I in the exchange of students, un
dergraduates as well as gradu
ates, and a new series of inter-
American fellowships in medicine
j and public health, under the spon
sorship of the Pan American Sani-
I tary Bureau.
Let me emphasize that it would
| be a mistake to propose a new
"program for Latin America." On
| the contrary, our task is to work
out separate policies and pro
grams for each nation with the |
leaders of that nation for their
differences are great and their
feelings are understandably sensi
tive.
But it is my belief that these I
six basic proposals can be the
basis of a new approach to Latin i
America — a new approach to
greet the beginning of a new era
in Latin American relations.
