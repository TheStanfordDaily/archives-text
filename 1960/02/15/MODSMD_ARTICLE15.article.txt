## 
### 
WASHINGTON </P) Secre
tary of Agriculture Ezra Taft
Benson yesterday rejected a sug
gestion that the Eisenhower ad
minist rat ion's less rigid approach
to farm legislation is geared to
the election year.
Benson said President Eisen
i hower's farm message to Con
! gress last week "is a document
J based on sound economic prin
j ciples, representing our best judg
ment and recommendations."
Eisenhower's message dealt
principally with the critical wheal
surplus prob 1 e m. Eisenhower
offered a plan for removing pro
| duction controls from the wheat
] farmer. At the same time he ehal
| lenged Congress lo come up with
I a better plan.
