Protest
Friitor, The Daily:
We wish to protest the organi
zation and handling of Senator
Kennedy's speech last Friday.
The Stanford Political Union, it
would seem, should be the organi
zation which has the best knowl
edge of the size of the response
that stud en t s would give to a
Presidential candidate speaking at
Stanford.
Apparently this is not the case.
However, this- error in judgment
could have been corrected by mov
ing the event outdoors once the
good weather was apparent.
Even less excusable was the lack
of courtesy on the part of the
Political Union to inform the
crowd waiting outside after the
door's were closed that the audi
torium was filled.
II the Stanford Political Union
is incapable of handling situations
of this type, we suggest that some
other organization sponsor such
events.
