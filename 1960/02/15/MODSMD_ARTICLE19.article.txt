The Senate Foreign Relation
Committee has been holding hear
ings on a resolution which, curi
ously and remarkably enough,
was introduced by Sen. Humphrey
and has the ardent support of Vice
President Nixon. This, as Mr. K.
might say, is an instance where
a shrimp has whistled.
The Humphrey Resolution ha
the full backing of the Admini
stration and it is likely lo com
mand the support of the Demo
cratic leadership. There are, to be
sure, dissenters who are seriously
worried that the acceptance of tlie
resolution will be an abdication
of American sovereignty.
But they are a small minority
as compared with the huge non
partisan majority which in
cludes so many of the leading
lawyers of the country.
The 11 um p hrey Resolution
would repeal what is known as
the Connally Amendment to the
original Senate Resoltuion No.
196. This Resolution, which was
adopted in 1946, called for the
deposit of a declaration accepting
the compulsory jurisdiction of
the International Court of Justice.
This is the court set up under
the Chapter of the United Na
tions. The United States was per
haps its leading advocate. '
Before the Connally Amend
ment was adopted the 1946 Res
olution said that "in relation to
any other state accepting the j
same obligation" the United
States accepts the compulsory
jurisdiction of the International
Court of Justice "in all legal dis
putes" which come under four j
classes of cases.
In International Court is to
have compulsory jurisdiction in a |
dispute about (I) the interpreta-1
tation of a treaty, (2) any ques
tion of international law, (3> the;
existence of any fact which, if j
established, would constitute a i
breach of an international obliga-j
tion, and (4) the nature or extent j
of ihe reparation to be made for |
the breach of an international
obligation.
The HMO Senate Resolution
says expressly where the com- |
pulsory jurisdiction of th e j
Court shall not apply. Of these !
reservations, the important one
is that the Court shall not have
jurisdiction in a "dispute with
regard to matters which are es
sentially within the domestic

jurisdiction of the United
States."
The question was then raised
in Ihe Senate as to how it was to
J be decided whether a matter is or
: is not essentially within the do
mestic jurisdiction of the United
i States.
The Senate answered this
question in HMO by accepting
the Connally Amendment which
added six words to the original
text. Because of this amend
ment the question of whether
a matter is essentially within
the domestic jurisdiction of the
United States is to be "deter
mined by the United States."
This is the amendment that
both Sen. Humphrey and Vice
President Nixon want to repeal.
The question raised in Congress
now is whether our government
or the International Court itself
shall decide whether a matter is
! domestic. The dissenters, who be
| lieve that the Connally Amend
| ment must be retained, argue
that the Court might take juris
| diction in a dispute which chal
lenged our tariff laws, our immi
gration laws, our currency laws,
our administration of the Pana
ma Canal.
These fears, though under
standable, are groundless. 11
the Court took jurisdiction in
domestic matters, it would be
violating its own statute which
expressly limits its jurisdiction
to international legal disputes.
It is conceivable, although it is
in the highest degree unlikely,
that the Court might violate the
law which created it. But if it did
that", there would be a remedy.
We would have an indubitable
grievances and we would be en
titled, legally and morally, to chal
lenge the Court by political action
in the United Nations.
Indeed, in view of what is
happening in this hemisphere
to affect American property
abroad, we have an interest
that every property dispute, as
with Castro today, should be
decided by a Court and not be
left to propaganda, agitation,
coercion, and force. But if we
want to be able to go to Court
to protect our rights, we must
be willing to go to Court when
someone else lias a grievance
against us.

Indeed, in view of what is

abroad, we have an interest
that every property dispute, as
with Castro today, should be
decided by a Court and not be
left to propaganda, agitation,
coercion, and force. But if we

The Senate Foreign Relation
Committee has been holding hear
ings on a resolution which, curi
ously and remarkably enough,
was introduced by Sen. Humphrey
and has the ardent support of Vice
President Nixon. This, as Mr. K.
might say, is an instance where
a shrimp has whistled.
The Humphrey Resolution ha
the full backing of the Admini
stration and it is likely lo com
mand the support of the Demo
cratic leadership. There are, to be
sure, dissenters who are seriously
worried that the acceptance of tlie
resolution will be an abdication
of American sovereignty.
But they are a small minority
as compared with the huge non
partisan majority which in
cludes so many of the leading
lawyers of the country.
The 11 um p hrey Resolution
would repeal what is known as
the Connally Amendment to the
original Senate Resoltuion No.
196. This Resolution, which was
adopted in 1946, called for the
deposit of a declaration accepting
the compulsory jurisdiction of
the International Court of Justice.
This is the court set up under
the Chapter of the United Na
tions. The United States was per
haps its leading advocate. '
Before the Connally Amend
ment was adopted the 1946 Res
olution said that "in relation to
any other state accepting the j
same obligation" the United
States accepts the compulsory
jurisdiction of the International
Court of Justice "in all legal dis
putes" which come under four j
classes of cases.
In International Court is to
have compulsory jurisdiction in a |
dispute about (I) the interpreta-1
tation of a treaty, (2) any ques
tion of international law, (3> the;
existence of any fact which, if j
established, would constitute a i
breach of an international obliga-j
tion, and (4) the nature or extent j
of ihe reparation to be made for |
the breach of an international
obligation.
The HMO Senate Resolution
says expressly where the com- |
pulsory jurisdiction of th e j
Court shall not apply. Of these !
reservations, the important one
is that the Court shall not have
jurisdiction in a "dispute with
regard to matters which are es
sentially within the domestic

jurisdiction of the United
States."
The question was then raised
in Ihe Senate as to how it was to
J be decided whether a matter is or
: is not essentially within the do
mestic jurisdiction of the United
i States.
The Senate answered this
question in HMO by accepting
the Connally Amendment which
added six words to the original
text. Because of this amend
ment the question of whether
a matter is essentially within
the domestic jurisdiction of the
United States is to be "deter
mined by the United States."
This is the amendment that
both Sen. Humphrey and Vice
President Nixon want to repeal.
The question raised in Congress
now is whether our government
or the International Court itself
shall decide whether a matter is
! domestic. The dissenters, who be
| lieve that the Connally Amend
| ment must be retained, argue
that the Court might take juris
| diction in a dispute which chal
lenged our tariff laws, our immi
gration laws, our currency laws,
our administration of the Pana
ma Canal.
These fears, though under
standable, are groundless. 11
