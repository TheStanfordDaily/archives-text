# Kennedy Appearance Causes Bedlam; 2,000 Students Swarm into Mem Aud
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
Political Professor Hu
bert Marshall dismissed his 11
o'clock class at Dinkelspiel Fri
day by saying, "Well, you're all
free to go hear the next presidenl
of the United States." Not many
of them made it-
Anybody who arrived at Me
morial Auditorium around noon
to hear Senator John F. Kennedy
was greeted by the largest cam
pus mob that at least one Uni
versity policeman said he has
ever seen outside of a football
game.
Tower Falling
"My God, Hoover Tower is fall
ing." was one student's commept.
"Who ever said that this was a
Republican campus?"
The 11 o'clock biology class in
the auditorium had a spectacular
attendance until it was announced
that the student police were going
to clear the auditorium directly
after the lecture. Clear it they did,
including the nearly fifty people
hiding out in the rest rooms hop
ing to sneak back inside once the
doors were opened.
At 12:10 the doors were opened
and the people appeared from
every direction. They came from
the front, the back, the sides and
about twenty hardy souls even
crawled out onto the orchestra
pit from underneath the stage.
Nobody knows yet how they got
there.
Some of the more enterprising
people who didn't make it in went
to surprising extremes to correct
the situation.
They climbed in the windows,

banged on Ihe doors and, in one
case, they were led by an irate
profesor who, while trying to beat
a door in, invited everyone to join
him in his protest.
'Sorry, Sir'
Stanford President Wallace
Sterling had a tense moment find
ing a seat, since the front section
was filled by every member of
The Daily, the student legisture,
and the lIR, who could find his
membership certificate.
He sat down once in the center
section only to be told by an
intrepid usher that he would have
have to move because the seat he
was in was reserved. Undaunted,
Sterling found a seat on the side.
Assistant Dean of Men David
Larimer, surveying the bedlam
said, "Well, at least we're inside."
Jeff Littleboy, assistant direc
tor of News and Publications, ran
into several problems handling
the press corps. Even roping off
six rows of seats for the press
didn't prevent -several late arriv
ing newsmen from having to sit
on the floor.
One fellow, dressed in sandals,
a beard, a silk scarf and an ex
pensive sports jacket, swore that
he was covering the speech for
The Underhound, a San Francisco
beatnik magazine. Littleboy had
to let him, and his dirty-faced,
leotarded, stringy - hai re d girl
friend, into the roped-off •section.
Little Old Lady
One front roW seat went to a
little old lady without a pass.
Her only qualification for the seat
was that she was a member of
the class of '98.

Just before the speech a photog
rapher trolled up to a group of
students and said, "Will three
boys, three girls and any in-be
tweens come to have (heir pic
tures taken with the senator when
he comes in?" Two rows contain
ing about forty student emptied
in record time.
The audience was a typical
Stanford gathering. When Rich
Sundeen, student body president,
mentioned in his introductory re
marks that Ken edy had gone to
Harvard, there was a slight hiss.
Kennedy was quickly redeemed,
however, when Sundeen reminded
everyone that he had done part
of his graduate work on the
Farm.
Political Question
The senator's speech undoubt
ly cleared up the question that
two girls were heard to ask before
the speech. "Is Kennedy a Demo
crat or a Republican?" was the
query.
After his speech Kennedy went
out to the steps of the auditorium
to speak to the more than 1,000
people who couldn't get inside.
Kennedy signed one girl's stu
dent body card. She stared in dis
belief and swooned.
It took Kennedy over half an
hour to break away from the
crowd so he could keep his dates
in Fresno and New York.

hiding out in the rest rooms hop
ing to sneak back inside once the
doors were opened.
At 12:10 the doors were opened
and the people appeared from
every direction. They came from
the front, the back, the sides and
about twenty hardy souls even
crawled out onto the orchestra
pit from underneath the stage.
Nobody knows yet how they got
there.
Some of the more enterprising
people who didn't make it in went
to surprising extremes to correct
the situation.
They climbed in the windows,

banged on Ihe doors and, in one
case, they were led by an irate
profesor who, while trying to beat
a door in, invited everyone to join
him in his protest.
'Sorry, Sir'
Stanford President Wallace
Sterling had a tense moment find
ing a seat, since the front section
was filled by every member of
The Daily, the student legisture,
and the lIR, who could find his
membership certificate.
He sat down once in the center
section only to be told by an
intrepid usher that he would have
have to move because the seat he
was in was reserved. Undaunted,
Sterling found a seat on the side.
Assistant Dean of Men David
Larimer, surveying the bedlam
said, "Well, at least we're inside."
Jeff Littleboy, assistant direc
tor of News and Publications, ran
into several problems handling
the press corps. Even roping off
six rows of seats for the press
didn't prevent -several late arriv
ing newsmen from having to sit
on the floor.
One fellow, dressed in sandals,
a beard, a silk scarf and an ex
pensive sports jacket, swore that
he was covering the speech for
The Underhound, a San Francisco
beatnik magazine. Littleboy had
to let him, and his dirty-faced,
leotarded, stringy - hai re d girl
friend, into the roped-off •section.
Little Old Lady
One front roW seat went to a
little old lady without a pass.
Her only qualification for the seat
was that she was a member of
the class of '98.

Just before the speech a photog
rapher trolled up to a group of
students and said, "Will three
boys, three girls and any in-be
tweens come to have (heir pic
tures taken with the senator when
he comes in?" Two rows contain
ing about forty student emptied
in record time.
The audience was a typical
Stanford gathering. When Rich
Sundeen, student body president,
mentioned in his introductory re
marks that Ken edy had gone to
Harvard, there was a slight hiss.
Kennedy was quickly redeemed,
however, when Sundeen reminded
everyone that he had done part
of his graduate work on the
Farm.
Political Question
The senator's speech undoubt
ly cleared up the question that
two girls were heard to ask before
the speech. "Is Kennedy a Demo
crat or a Republican?" was the
query.
After his speech Kennedy went
out to the steps of the auditorium
to speak to the more than 1,000
people who couldn't get inside.
Kennedy signed one girl's stu
dent body card. She stared in dis
belief and swooned.
It took Kennedy over half an
hour to break away from the
crowd so he could keep his dates
in Fresno and New York.

and the lIR, who could find his
membership certificate.
He sat down once in the center
section only to be told by an
intrepid usher that he would have
have to move because the seat he
was in was reserved. Undaunted,
Sterling found a seat on the side.
Assistant Dean of Men David
Larimer, surveying the bedlam
said, "Well, at least we're inside."
Jeff Littleboy, assistant direc
tor of News and Publications, ran
into several problems handling
the press corps. Even roping off
six rows of seats for the press
didn't prevent -several late arriv
ing newsmen from having to sit
on the floor.
One fellow, dressed in sandals,
a beard, a silk scarf and an ex
pensive sports jacket, swore that
he was covering the speech for
The Underhound, a San Francisco
beatnik magazine. Littleboy had
to let him, and his dirty-faced,
leotarded, stringy - hai re d girl
friend, into the roped-off •section.
Little Old Lady
One front roW seat went to a
little old lady without a pass.
Her only qualification for the seat
was that she was a member of
the class of '98.

Just before the speech a photog
rapher trolled up to a group of
students and said, "Will three
boys, three girls and any in-be
tweens come to have (heir pic
tures taken with the senator when
he comes in?" Two rows contain
ing about forty student emptied
in record time.
The audience was a typical
Stanford gathering. When Rich
Sundeen, student body president,
mentioned in his introductory re
marks that Ken edy had gone to
Harvard, there was a slight hiss.
Kennedy was quickly redeemed,
however, when Sundeen reminded
everyone that he had done part
of his graduate work on the
Farm.
Political Question
The senator's speech undoubt
ly cleared up the question that
two girls were heard to ask before
the speech. "Is Kennedy a Demo
crat or a Republican?" was the
query.
After his speech Kennedy went
out to the steps of the auditorium
to speak to the more than 1,000
people who couldn't get inside.
Kennedy signed one girl's stu
dent body card. She stared in dis
belief and swooned.
It took Kennedy over half an
hour to break away from the
crowd so he could keep his dates
in Fresno and New York.

KENNEDY TALKS TO PART OF THE CROWD THAT C OULDN'T GET IN
The Senator spoke for a few minutes outside Memorial Auditorium
Political Professor Hu
bert Marshall dismissed his 11
o'clock class at Dinkelspiel Fri
day by saying, "Well, you're all
free to go hear the next presidenl
of the United States." Not many
of them made it-
Anybody who arrived at Me
morial Auditorium around noon
to hear Senator John F. Kennedy
was greeted by the largest cam
pus mob that at least one Uni
versity policeman said he has
ever seen outside of a football
game.
Tower Falling
"My God, Hoover Tower is fall
ing." was one student's commept.
"Who ever said that this was a
Republican campus?"
The 11 o'clock biology class in
the auditorium had a spectacular
attendance until it was announced
that the student police were going
to clear the auditorium directly
after the lecture. Clear it they did,
including the nearly fifty people
hiding out in the rest rooms hop
ing to sneak back inside once the
doors were opened.
At 12:10 the doors were opened
and the people appeared from
every direction. They came from
the front, the back, the sides and
about twenty hardy souls even
crawled out onto the orchestra
pit from underneath the stage.
Nobody knows yet how they got
there.
Some of the more enterprising
people who didn't make it in went
to surprising extremes to correct
the situation.
They climbed in the windows,

banged on Ihe doors and, in one
case, they were led by an irate
profesor who, while trying to beat
a door in, invited everyone to join
him in his protest.
'Sorry, Sir'
