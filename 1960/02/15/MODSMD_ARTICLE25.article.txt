Running their fast-breaking of
fense to perfection, the UCLA
Bruins whipped Stanford 58-52
Friday night. The win enabled
UCLA to maintain its hold on sec
ond place in ihe AAWU standings
and put Stanford well out of
reach in third place.
The Bruins, led by the deadly
outside shooting of sophomore
112 o rw a r d G a r y Cunningham,
rallied late in the first half to
build up an 18 point bulge by
half-time. The game started off
slowly with both teams playing
tight defense and forcing errors
from their opponents.
Then, after Indian center Neal
Brocqmeyer netted a free throw
to pull his teammates within one
point of the Bruins, UCLA went
on a rampage, scoring 22 points
while they held Stanford to five.
Off the Bench
Cliff Brandon came off the
bench to team with Bill Ellis in
the backcourt, and these two put
UCLA's potent Last break into
motion. Their exceptional speed
and tight defense cause numer
ous mistakes in Ihe Indian hack
court which led directly to
buckets.
With the beginning of the sec
ond half Stanford started whitt
ling away at that lead and with
just three minutes remaining, had
cut it to eight points at 46-54.
Stanford, using a pressing man
to-man defense, brought the
crowd to life as they began to
make a run at the coasting
Bruins. But with Brandon holding
the West wood ball club together,
the Indian effort was in vain.
Same Story
For Stanford it was the same
old story. The Indians just could
no I find the range from the out
side in the first half. A second
half spurt raised their game aver
age to a respectable 37 per cent,
but the damage had already been
done.
Leading scorer for the Bruins
was Cunningham with 14 points
followed by Pete Blackman with
11. The Bruins were without the
services of ace rebounder Kent
Miller, who was expected to be
ready but rode the bench through
out the contest.
Even without the 6-6 forward
UCLA dominated both back
boards, and were especially effec
tive on the offensive boards.
