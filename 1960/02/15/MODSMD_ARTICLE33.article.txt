Slow Start

three charities, and Arrillaga
made two while Broekmeyer con
tributed a hook shol and another
free throw.
Then Broekmeyer got hot, scor
ing Stanford's next seven points.
The lead never widened because

scorer for Ihe night with 17, made
a couple of long jumpers and

sense with a 12 foot jump shot,
and Windsor made a fielder from

ton layin. Then John Hendry,
Broekmeyer, and Windsor each
added a free Ihrow to give Stan
