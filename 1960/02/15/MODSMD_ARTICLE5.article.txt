# U.S. Policy on Latin America Hit by Kennedy as 'Inadequate'
## 
### Jerry Rankin 
Presidential hopeful Sen. John F. Kennedy jabbed sharply at the
Eisenhower administration's Latin American program and proposed
a new policy of his own in a speech Friday before a milling, turna
way throng of more than 4,000 persons at Memorial Auditorium.
The crowd had started gathering an hour and a half before

the Massachusetts Democrat ap
peared at 12:30 p.m. Just over
2,000 managed to shove their way
into the auditorium, while the
others were packed outside the
main doors, in the basement and
in the rear of the building.
Main point in Ihe Kennedy ad
dress was Ihe pressing need for
a new policy for Latin America.
Apparently this will bo one of the
planks in his campaign platform
should he be nominated for presi
dent at the July Democratic con
vention in Los Angeles.
Kennedy scored the Admini
stration for "inconsistent, incon
siderate and inadequate economic
and diplomatic policies" in Latin
America.
Possible Security Threat
It the United States doesn't
take action, he said, "our own
'backyard' may well pose a threat
to our security far greater than
that posed by an distant corner of
the globe."
He complained of Latin Ameri
can embassies "left vacant for
prolonged periods or used as a
haven for second-rate appointees."
He called Latin America"the
stepchild in the Department of
State," and brought forth a six
point proposal to meet the prob
lems:
» "The development of a series of
inter-American economic agree
ments.
• "The enlargement of Latin
American allocations in the De
velopment Loan Fund—and the
widest possible use of the new
Inler • American Capital Develop
ment Bank."
• Negotiation of individual tax
treaties to encourage a greater
flow of private investment to
Latin nations.
• "A new American attitude on
dictators," assuring Latin peoples
that Americans support only free
governments.
• A more important, expanded
role for the Organization of
American States.
• "A new emphasis on education
and technical assistance." and an
increase in student exchanges and
fellowships.
Jibes Republicans
The handsome front-runner for
the Democratic presidential nomi
nation frequently had the audi
ence laughing at his ad libs, and
at his jibes at the Republicans.
At one point, speaking of the
old European custom of giving
university students and graduates
more than one vote in elections,
the youthful •senator said he didn't
favor that system, "at least not
until more Democrats go to col
lege."
Kennedy stressed the United
States' responsibility in extending
a free society to the underde
veloped and unstable countries of
the world.
He saifl that "If we fail, the
cause of freedom fails; if we suc
ceed, the cause of freedom «uc
ceeds."
Basic Problem
Since our basic problem in the
next 40 years will be whether "a
free society can successfully com
pete against a communist so
ciety," both Republicans and
Democrats "must go to the people
to toll them . . . of the heavy
burdens they must bear," he con
tinued.
In a strong New England ac
cent. Kennedy declared Ihat the
"real question" that will face this
country is whether we or the
Communists are successful in
winning over the underdeveloped
nat ions.
Again touching on what is shap
ing up as a hot November cam
paign issue, the senator fired a
blast at the Eisenhower farm
policy in a short question-and
answer period.
He called for a farm program
with "better administration and
better knowledge" of farm prob
lems. ,
'Most Serious Problem'
The farm issue, lie predicted,
will be "the most serious, com
plicated domestic problem of the
1960 election."
Turning to the Far East, he ad
vocated recognition of Red China
by the United Stales and its ad
mission to the United Nations,
but only after the Communist
Chinese meet certain tests.
Such tests would include: Red
China showing concrete signs of
a willingness to live by inter
national rules of conduct as stated
in the U.N. Charter; its coming to
a fair agreement on Formosa;

SENATOR KENNEDY TALKS TO REPORTERS IN MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM
"No area deserves more attention today than the vital area known as Latin America"
j and freeing Americans now held
; in China.
However, he did not think rec
! ognition of Red China is war
ranted "under present condi
| lions."
Urges Political Activity
During the first part of his
speech, Kennedy urged students
"to give some of your life, time
and talent to, the field of self
government."
In calling for more participa
-1 tion and leadership in govern
! ment and politic by educated men
! and women, Kennedy recalled that
| America's "first great leaders
! were also the first great poli-
I ticians."
He noted that "politics is one
of the most neglected and abused
professions." and that this "dis
dain is intensified in academic in
stitutions."
"The world of scholarship and
practical politics have drifted far
apart," and "we are badly in need
of your talents today," lie told
the audicnce.
