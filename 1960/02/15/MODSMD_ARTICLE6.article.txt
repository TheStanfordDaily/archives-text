# 'Students Can Fight Affidavit'
## 
### Steve Freidberg, Editor 
Senator John Kennedy said Fri
day that the best way for stu
dents to combat the disclaimer
affidavit of the National Defense
Education Act is to write their
individual congressmen.
Kennedy in an interview after
his speech in Memorial Auditor
ium stated that the main prob
lem last year was that not enough
congressmen knew enough about
the affidavit to vote for repeal.
If enough letters are written
in protest so that the congress
men know the public is interested
in and opposed to the affidavit,
there is a good possibility it will
not survive this session of Con
gress, he said.
Co-Sponsoring
Kennedy, who is co-sponsoring
a bill with Senators Jacob Javits
and Joseph Clark to repeal the
affidavit, mentioned that the bill
was now out of committee but
that it faced a hard fight. He
thought that California Senators
Clair Engle and Thomas Kuchel
would vote for the bill.
He commented that a compro
mise might have to be effected
j with a hi 1] of Senator Barry Gold
| water which would make it a
! crime for a Communist to accept
J the money, but which would not
; require any sort of affidavit to be
signed.
The action by many universi
ties in refusing to accept money
under the NDEA because of the
affidavit is "very effective," he
said, and"the more universities
that turn the money down, the
more irrjpressive it will be."
Primary
Kennedy refused to state at
this time whether he would enter
the California primary but he
said he would make his decision
by March 10. At the moment, he
is not considering entering any
other primaries.
His toughest primary, he be
lieves, will be in Wisconsin, since
it is the first one where he will
meet Senator Hubert Humphrey.
He does not approve of the new
system of voting in the Wisconsin
primary because it will make it
possible for one candidate to ob
tain the majority popular vote
and have a minority of delegates.
More Candidates
A believer in the presidential
primary system, Kennedy said
that he wished more candidates
would take part in the primaries,
but so far only Humphrey is
opposing him openly.
He said he did not have anyone
in mind for his running mate
were he to be nominated by the
convention this summer. "I am
not yet in the happy situation
when 1 have to decide that," he
said.
He stated that he felt sure any
Democrat elected to the Presi
dency would offer Adlai Steven
son I lie position of Secretary of
State.
Turning to the steel strike, Ken
nedy thought that the administra
tion could have ended the strike
in July 1959 by means similar to
those used in January.
lie said that the effort was
made in January because of the
election year and the possibility
of the strike becoming a nasty
issue.
Talking about his days at Stan
ford in 1940, Kennedy said that
the lootball team was undefeated
that year and went to the Ilose
Bowl.
He also mentioned that the
legend of the homely Stanford
woman did not exist when he was
attending the Business School,
and he said he had seen many
attractive girls in front of
Memorial Auditorium after the
speech.
He added jokingly that the boys
were the ones he had wondered
about.
