## France May Ask Full Share Of West's Nuclear Knowledge 
### 
PARIS (/P) France, triumphant over an atomic test explosion,
i may now pu-sh its case for a share of the nuclear knowhow of the
: United States and Great Britain.
Two members of the French Atomic Energy Commission will
visit Washington later this week to meet officials of the U.S. Atom-

I ic Energy Commission.
Pierre Falquet of the French
commission's external affairs di
vision and Philippe Gordien of the
military applications division, in
sisted in New York their talks
i would be merely exploratory.
U.S. Reaction
I Reaction in Washington to the
I Frcnch test Saturday was that
one explosion does not entitle a
nation to full membership in
j atomic councils. But France's
President Charles de Gaulle is
! prepared to argue that mueh nu-
I clear information is already
known to the Soviet Union and
should not be kept secret from
; a friend.
I Most Frenchmen took the at
titude there is no reason why
| France should not have her own
I atomic weapons. Unconcealed
pride that France marie the tesl
: mingled with resentment she had
been denied help from her allies.
First Look
De Gaulle and other Frenchmen
got their first look yesterday at
| photographs of the explosion of
i the tower device, shot off Satur
-1 day in the Sahara. An army docu
i mentary film showing prepara
lions for the blast and the flower
ing of the awesome mushroom
cloud were flown to Paris. De
i Gaulle got a special showing at
his Elysee Palace.
Police guarded the French Em
bassy in Stockholm after anony
mous threats that "on Sunday we
will blow up the embassy." The
embassy has received hundreds of
letters protesting the test.
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrush
chev said in New Delhi, "All I
lean say is that we regret this
direction has been taken instead
ol a direction reducing such ex
i plosions."
