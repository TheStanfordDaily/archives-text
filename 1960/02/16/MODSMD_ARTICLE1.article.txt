## Yugoslav Minister Favors Coexistence 
### 
Yugoslavia is in favor of co-existence; it will cooperate with any
country that recognizes her rights as a free, Socialist state, Yugo
slavian Ambassador to the United States, Marko Nikezic, said yes
terday in Cubberley Auditorium as he spoke to a small crowd
on "Contemporary Yugoslavia and Her Foreign Policy."
"We also are, and plan to remain, neutral in the cold war and

hope that the United Nations can
play a more active role in its set
tlement," Nikezic* said.
On analyizing U.S. Yugoslavian
relations for the past 10 years,
Nikezic commented that he felt
relations have been excellent and
that the Americans he has spoken
to have felt the same way.
"We feel that our relations will
continue to improve, not only with
the U.S. but with all countries, as
neutral states begin to have a
more important place in world
affairs," he said.
Yugoslavia has been in the
limelight since 1948 when the Tito
regime disagreed on certain so
cialistic principles with the Stalin
regime.
"The Yugoslavian government
feels that because tlie customs
and traditions of various coun
tries are so greatly different, that
no one single pattern can spread
over the whole globe," Nikezic
said.
The Socialist system is work
ing out very well in Yugoslavia,
according to Nikezic. "In the last
five years, Yugoslavian industrial
output has increased 15-20 per
cent and 1958 was the first year
that we did not need wheat from
the U. 5.," Nikezic stated.
Nikezic pointed out, however,
that the power in Yugoslavia
rests mostly in the hands of
workers' councils as compared to
the strong centralization in Rus
sia. "Those who really do the
work should decide what should
be developed," he said.
He also pointed to Yugoslavia's
increased production under the
direction of workers as disproof
of the belief that the workers are
not capable of running a country.

terday in Cubberley Auditorium as he spoke to a small crowd
on "Contemporary Yugoslavia and Her Foreign Policy."
"We also are, and plan to remain, neutral in the cold war and

hope that the United Nations can
play a more active role in its set
tlement," Nikezic* said.
On analyizing U.S. Yugoslavian
relations for the past 10 years,
Nikezic commented that he felt
relations have been excellent and
that the Americans he has spoken
to have felt the same way.
"We feel that our relations will
continue to improve, not only with
the U.S. but with all countries, as
neutral states begin to have a
more important place in world
affairs," he said.
Yugoslavia has been in the
limelight since 1948 when the Tito
regime disagreed on certain so
cialistic principles with the Stalin
regime.
"The Yugoslavian government
feels that because tlie customs
and traditions of various coun
tries are so greatly different, that
no one single pattern can spread
over the whole globe," Nikezic
said.
The Socialist system is work
ing out very well in Yugoslavia,
according to Nikezic. "In the last
five years, Yugoslavian industrial
output has increased 15-20 per
cent and 1958 was the first year
that we did not need wheat from
the U. 5.," Nikezic stated.
Nikezic pointed out, however,
that the power in Yugoslavia
rests mostly in the hands of
workers' councils as compared to
the strong centralization in Rus
sia. "Those who really do the
work should decide what should
be developed," he said.
He also pointed to Yugoslavia's
increased production under the
direction of workers as disproof
of the belief that the workers are
not capable of running a country.
