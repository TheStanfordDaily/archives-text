# Nehru, Chou Meet In Border Dispute
## 
### 
NEW DELHI, India (#>) â€” Prime Minister Nehru has agreed
at last to meet with Premier Chou En-lai of Red China to discuss
their angry border dispute, as suggested by Chou three months ago.
Reversing his stand against a personal meeting without adequate
advance preparation, Nehru in a note made public yesterday invited

Chou to this capital. Chou has
suggested a meeting in China or
the neutral soil of Burma.
The Rod Chinese Premier said
he would consider an alternate
site, however. II he accepts Neh
ru's suggestion, the two big Asian
neighbors may'get their own sum
mit talk going next month. Nehru
proposed the last part of March
as a likely time.
No Common Ground
"For the moment," said Nehru's
note dated Feb. 5, "I do not see
any common ground between our
respective standpoints. Still. I
think it might be helpful for us to
meet."
Nehru's note was sent before
Nikita Khrushchev's arrival in In
dia, a visit that brought no out
ward indication the Soviet Pre
mier might intervene with his
Red Chinese ally as some Indians
had hoped.
Nehru may have been encour
aged to try a personal meet
ing with Chou by the example of
Prime Minister No Win of neigh
boring Burma. Win went to Pei
ping last month and within a few
days settled the main issues of a
bolder dispute older than the one
between India and China.
China Claims
A 1 issue between India and
China are 51,000 square miles of
tenitory on the Himalayan fron
tier. Red China claims 36,000
square miles on the northeast
frontier and 15,000 square milos in
the Ladakh area a thousand miles
to the west. New Delhi considers
both Indian territory.
Nehru's note was accompanied
by a detailed government letter
replying to one from Chou last
December. Both rejected Rod
China's suggestion that the two
nations negotiate the entire bor
der between India and Tibet.
There can be no negotiation on
that basis, said Nehru.
India to Negotiate
The letter said the Indian gov
ernment "is prepared for negotia
tions on specific disputes in re
gard to Ihe location of particular
places and to make frontier recti
fications by agreement."
