"A nuclear war would mean the end of civilization, but people
don't really believe it," Dr. Robert C. North, assistant professor of
political science, told a Seminar on World Peace Sunday night at
the Palo Alto First Methodist Church.
"Mankind is at a crossroads," he declared. "This is the time

when wo must decido whether
man will continue as a species
or not.
"It is hard for even mo to be
lieve this is really the case in
1960. I have to keep reminding
myself that if we do not make the
right decisions, my children will
not have children."
Dr. North said lie believed the
possibilities of escaping war are

better than they were a year ago.
North said he believed, instead
of laughing at Khrushchev's pro
posals. Americans should come
up with some serious, well
thought out counter-proposals.
He suggested as one U.S. pro
posal a bargain to transfer all
money saved by disarmament into
two funds. One half of the money,
he said, could go into a program
to reengineer the world as an
aid to underprivileged and under
developed nations.
The other half could be con
verter! into space exploration,
utilizing manpower present 1 y
used for missile production.
