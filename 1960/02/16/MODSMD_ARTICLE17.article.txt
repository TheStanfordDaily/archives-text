# France's A-Bomb
## 
### 
France lias now officially joined the Great Powers in I lie new
era of weapons. Last week she fired her (irsl atomic bomb in the
deserts of Africa. Furopcan and African politics must now change
to fit this new fact.
The African nations and colonies will of course he affected by
France's new feat. Relations between Tunisia and the \\ e>t will
probably be greatk strained. Tunisia has tried unsuccessfull\
both through international organizations and through diplomacv
to cancel the tests which took place in her own back vard.
The Algerian rebels will have to recognize the new situation.
I'ranee, whether or not sbe would consider the use of atomic
weapons in this region, holds this threat over the Moslems strug
gling for freedom.
They must now realise that the decisions of DeGaulle have
much more authority behind them than previouslv. Tliev should
seriously consider before rejecting liis planned referendum in
favor of more war and violence.
As a result ol Saturday s successful explosion, the nations of
southern Alrica have become still further removed from the
Western World, (rliana froze all French assets, and Nigeria has
expressed grave concern. I'll esc peoples regard tiiis misuse of
t liei r eont i net it as one I nil her \ iol.il ion of their rights b\ imperi
alism.
France's relations with her neighbor llalv will also be seri
ousK aflccted. Italian tow ns are cooled b\ Mediterranean breezes
originating on the African desert of France's lest. These people
are \il a 11 \ concerned with the effects of radiation, and stations
have been set up all over the country to inform them of an\
increase in aerial radiuactivitv.
The di sarmament talks will be set back b\ these new event
since Khriishche\ lias stated that all atomic powers must agree
to halt tests, and France lias shown but grudging acceptance of
this idea. DcGaulle lia> said that if a nuclear disarmament agree
ment is signed, France will abide h\ it, hut he will not work for
test suspension.
Ilius France's new accomplishment has grcatl\ complicated
world politics, yet we as Americans can certaink not protest a>
pious spectators. We, the inventors of the bomb, showed no desire
to suspend tests until a competitor had also discovered the secret.
We subjected foreign areas and innocent people to unnecessar\
radiation exposure l>\ our use of the South Pacific for our testing
center. Â»
Any protest on our pari would be sheer h\pocrisy. We have
set few examples in our use of atomic energ\ which could be
profitably followed b\ the world. It is Britain and not we who
has led the world in the peaceful use of the atom. It is 011K re
cent | \ that we ha\e begun to exploit the atom for its economic
and industrial value. Certaink we are not leaders in this field.
We can onk hope that France will soon realize that world
leadership is no longer based entirely on armies and bombs, but
that it has moved into a new era of economies and diplomacy.
In tli is new maturity of \ision, she would see that her knowledge }
has far more use in industrial processes than in the production
of bombs.
