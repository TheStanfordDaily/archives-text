## Revolution in Books 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
Paperback books, a student's
pocketbook's best friend, are, in
the words of one Bennett Cerf,
"the greatest thing since corn
flakes."
Dubious praise as this may
seem, he means it to be some
thing like "one of the greatest
things that has ever happened to
the book publishing business,"
which is what Harold E. Inble,
president of the American Asso
ciation of University Presses
called the colorful packages of
25 cent to $2.85 reading.
On the other hand some pub
lic and parochial school teach
ers have called them "trashy and
lurid," "cheap pulp material"
and "profanity." Police depart
ments in Chicago, San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles are bus
ily pat ruling newstands, ready
| <o seize any books with sus
! picious covers. Such people are
i obviously misinformed.
Or else they have not heard of
Jack Kerouac, David Riesman,
Jules Feifferf and D. T. Suzuki,
jail products of the paperback
book industry.
Prosperity, it that is any indica
tion of value, has come to the
American book industry via a
total of 300 million copies of 7,000
paperback titles sold last year.
Paperback sale accounted tor
close to one-halt' of all hooks
sold and nearly one-fifth the in
dustry's total dollar income,
now at an all-time high.
In 1957 13 per cent of all college
textbooks were paper-bound. The
Stanford bookstore stocks 500 to
1700 paperbook titles now, and
there will be 4,000 paperback titles
in the new store, in comparison
to 10,000 hard back titles, in the
general book department.
The entire back part of the
store, a floor area 90 by 20 feet
J containing four five-shelf racks
and five seven-row, 14-foot racks,
will he devoted to paperbacks.
The books will be arranged in
| categories and will all be self
j service in a special section headed
by William Kimball. Another
specialist in paperbacks has been
hired to help out in the section.
The foreign language paper
backs will have their own space
in the front of the store, and
there will probably also be a
separate section for art paper
backs.
There have been two paperback
"revolutions' 'in our time.
The first, started by reprinter
Robert F. De Graff, was the mass
market paperback revolution. To
get paper books into Ihe U.S.

■ similar to those long a part of
European publishing, He Graff
| dec ided to reprint previously pop
ular hard cover books.
In June, 1939, he put the Pocket
Book line, 25 cents each, on sale
ion newstands and drug stores,
i They were snatched up immedi
j ately.
By 1953 there were 2(1 paper
back publishers iu the U.S.,
most of them printing things
like "How to Win Friends and
Influence People" and "Kill Me
Deadly." It was in this period
that paperbacks picked up any
reputation which fits into the
raised eyebrows department.
The second revolution came at
the height of this raging, in April
1 of 1953.
I A Columbia graduate by the
j name of Jacob Epstein persuaded
! Doubleday that there were some
people, perhaps 10 to 15 per cent
of the population, who were in
; terested in serious books who
i could not get them at current
high prices for hard backs.
Anchor Books, the Doubleday
line, were distributed to book
stores, department stores,
school and college book shops
and other selected outlets where
people take an intelligent in
terest iu what they are selling.
He started a landslide. Almost
1 every publisher has established
a soft-cover department, and
! there are now 79 trade publishers
! and university presses in the
field.
Titles range from "Room at the
Top" to all of Dostevsky and
j Thomas Mann back to Salinger
! and Nabokov, to say nothing of
; "The Meaning of Jazz," Rous
; seau's "Confessions," Malcolm
Cowley's "Exile's Return," For
ster's "Aspect of the Novel," "Sex.
Literature and Censorship" by D.
H. Lawrence. "The Worldly Phi
losphers," "The Acquisitive So
ciety," "The Portable Gibbon.' 1
Best sellers of the last six
months are rather expected:
"Exodus," "Lady Chattel-ley's
Lover," "Lolita," "Anatomy of
i a Murder," "Catcher in the
Rye," "On the Road," "On the
Beach,'' "The Best of Every
thing," "Peyton Place" and
"Wake Up, Stupid," in that
order.
For ihe student paperbacks of
fer only one problem: how does
one stop buying them when prices
are so low and choices so large?
The solution seems to be to put
all texts in paperback. The money
: left over from the formerly $8.50
texts can go for a bigger and
better library.

In June, 1939, he put the Pocket
Book line, 25 cents each, on sale

j ately.
By 1953 there were 2(1 paper
back publishers iu the U.S.,
most of them printing things
like "How to Win Friends and
Influence People" and "Kill Me
Deadly." It was in this period
that paperbacks picked up any
reputation which fits into the
raised eyebrows department.
The second revolution came at
the height of this raging, in April
1 of 1953.
I A Columbia graduate by the
j name of Jacob Epstein persuaded

people, perhaps 10 to 15 per cent
of the population, who were in
; terested in serious books who
i could not get them at current
high prices for hard backs.
Anchor Books, the Doubleday
line, were distributed to book
stores, department stores,
school and college book shops
and other selected outlets where
people take an intelligent in

thing," "Peyton Place" and
"Wake Up, Stupid," in that
order.
For ihe student paperbacks of

The solution seems to be to put
all texts in paperback. The money

There have been two paperback
"revolutions' 'in our time.
The first, started by reprinter
Robert F. De Graff, was the mass
market paperback revolution. To
get paper books into Ihe U.S.

■ similar to those long a part of
European publishing, He Graff
| dec ided to reprint previously pop
ular hard cover books.
In June, 1939, he put the Pocket
Book line, 25 cents each, on sale
ion newstands and drug stores,
i They were snatched up immedi
j ately.
By 1953 there were 2(1 paper
back publishers iu the U.S.,
most of them printing things
like "How to Win Friends and
Influence People" and "Kill Me
Deadly." It was in this period
that paperbacks picked up any
reputation which fits into the
raised eyebrows department.
The second revolution came at
the height of this raging, in April
1 of 1953.
I A Columbia graduate by the
j name of Jacob Epstein persuaded
! Doubleday that there were some
people, perhaps 10 to 15 per cent
of the population, who were in
; terested in serious books who
i could not get them at current
high prices for hard backs.
Anchor Books, the Doubleday
line, were distributed to book
stores, department stores,
school and college book shops
and other selected outlets where
people take an intelligent in
terest iu what they are selling.
He started a landslide. Almost
1 every publisher has established
a soft-cover department, and
! there are now 79 trade publishers
! and university presses in the
field.
Titles range from "Room at the
Top" to all of Dostevsky and
j Thomas Mann back to Salinger
! and Nabokov, to say nothing of
; "The Meaning of Jazz," Rous
; seau's "Confessions," Malcolm
Cowley's "Exile's Return," For
ster's "Aspect of the Novel," "Sex.
Literature and Censorship" by D.
H. Lawrence. "The Worldly Phi
losphers," "The Acquisitive So
ciety," "The Portable Gibbon.' 1
Best sellers of the last six
months are rather expected:
"Exodus," "Lady Chattel-ley's
Lover," "Lolita," "Anatomy of
i a Murder," "Catcher in the
Rye," "On the Road," "On the
Beach,'' "The Best of Every
thing," "Peyton Place" and
"Wake Up, Stupid," in that
order.
For ihe student paperbacks of
fer only one problem: how does
one stop buying them when prices
are so low and choices so large?
The solution seems to be to put
all texts in paperback. The money
: left over from the formerly $8.50
texts can go for a bigger and
better library.
Paperback books, a student's
pocketbook's best friend, are, in
the words of one Bennett Cerf,
"the greatest thing since corn
flakes."
Dubious praise as this may
seem, he means it to be some
thing like "one of the greatest
things that has ever happened to
the book publishing business,"
which is what Harold E. Inble,
president of the American Asso

called the colorful packages of
25 cent to $2.85 reading.
