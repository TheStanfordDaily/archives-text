Optional Midterms
Editor, The Daily:
1 agree wholeheartedly that
midterm exams should be an op
tion to the student.
Students complain when they
have too many midterms or when
t heir whole grade depends on just
one exam. By making midterms I
optional the student can choose|
for himself whether he wants to
put all his eggs in one basket or
not.
As Stanford is a highly ranked
academic university, it should be
considered that students are ma
ture enough to decide for them
selves if it's to their advantage to
take a midterm.
Furthermore, I see nothing
wrong with a student being able
to take tho exam and not handing
it in at the end of tho period if he
feels he hasn't done well enough.
This is an advantage to the smart
student and an incentive to the
average student to take the exam
without pressure just to see how |
much he knows.
This plan to a small degree do
emphasizes grades and allows the
student a chance to relax and take
an exam to bring out how much
ho knows without the fear of do
ing poorly and paying for his ef
fort with a bad grade.
And also it will take away the
old complaint of the helter-skelter
quarter system.

Stolen Tests
Editor, The Daily:
Sari commentary on something:
Of the last three examinations
I have sustained, all were in blue
hook form, and all were graded
and returned to the bins in the
Sociology department to be picked
up. One was picked up by me.
The other two were stolen.
