At last il looks like a Stanford basket ball team will have <ome
tall men to be feared around the league. After Tribe center Neal
Brockmeyer and forward John Windsor ser\'ed up US(' to be slaugh
tered Saturday night, the rest of Stanford's cage opponents should
be forced to take any undue pressure off Card front men John
Arrillaga and Bub Bowling and concentrate on the tall men under
neath. Consequently we should see a strong balanced attack from
Stanford cagers.
Certainly no plaudits will suffice in praising Brockineyer's per
formance against the Trojans clearly the best of his cage career.
Brock's 22 points were high for the game and he made 8 out of 10
from the floor on a variety of jump and hook shots, lie did a great
job rebounding and held Trojan centers Hampton and Haiina to S
and 2 points.
Tribe spohomore forward Windsor gets better every game and

he certainly shined last Saturday
against the Troymen. Windsor
followed BrocUnieyer in Card
scoring with 17 points for the
winning cause and tied with SC
guard Jerry I'iinin lor game sec
ond high.
Windsor led the Cards rebound
ers with 11 and also hit eight
field goals. He also proved an all
around player as he held the
highly touted Trojan sophomore
John Kudonietkin to no field
goals and nine freethrows cer
tainly a great defensive effort.
Stanford has four remaining
games and still has an outside
chance for Iho Big Five title.
Currently the Indians hold a 4-3
mark two games behind Cal and
one behind the UCLA Bruins. II
the Cards can whip the IJeians
Friday and then knock off SC
again, the final two-game series
with Cal should be a thriller. We
can only hope that Cal will get
beaten once before the cage
finale and Ihen if . . . well a four

frame sweep isn't too far out of the picture because those three
teams can lie beaten by the Indians if they keep playing consistently.
Who'll Make 11?
As this basketball season draws to a close perhaps we can do
a little speculating as to who will be playing in the NCAA play
offs this year. Ii appears thai Cal has the inside track from the Big
rive. Also, cither I tali or Utah State should also make the Far West
playoffs with possibly Idaho State, Portland, Santa Clara or New
Mexico fighting for the other two berths.
As we move over the Rockies the competition gets a lot tighter.
In the crucial .Missouri Valley Conference we see Biff Oscar Robert
son leading Cincinnati against once-beaten Bradley to decide who
will advance to the NCAA playoffs. Also the winner of this rivalry
will have to face a tough Ohio State team which leads the Biff Ten
conference with a 17-2 season mark.
Going further east and south, two fine teams West Virginia and
Georgia Tech will battle for another playoff spot. Jerry West should
lead his powerful West Virginia offense ranked fourth in the Na
tion against a top eastern defensive team, the Tech Yellow,jackets
to decide who represents the East. Other teams which may give
eastern boys a tough fight for the playoff berths are Auburn and
North Carolina each has lost but thiee season games.
Texas AiKM Tonsil Team
From the Southwest and Biff Eight Conference tlie Kansas Jay
hawkers may return to post-season tourney play led by their ace
Wayne Hiffhower. Texas A\M seems to lie the cream of the South
west Conference and should prove a stumbling block to any southern
foes.
Of course this is all speculation and a lot of injuries and "ifs"
could change the schedule all around. No NCAA team should be
taken out of the running. Take Slippery Rock for example current
ly on a five game winning streak after having dumped Kdenhoro
96-87 last weekend- they were not figured for much this season
but have come along real fast. Yes, anything can happen in the
final fight tor the playoffs, Stanford could even all the way.
