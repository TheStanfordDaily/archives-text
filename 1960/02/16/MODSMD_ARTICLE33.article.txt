# More School Aid For Servicemen
## 
### 
Men who enlisted in the Armed
Forces after Jan. 31. 19."55, should
write their local Congressman to
see what educational benefits
they may he receiving with the
passage of the Teague Law.
At present "Cold War Veterans"
who enlisted after that date do
not receive governmental aid for
their education; the passage of
Teague Law may bring about a
change.
The House Committee on Vet
eran Affairs will begin hearings
next Tuesday for consideration of
passing this bill.
