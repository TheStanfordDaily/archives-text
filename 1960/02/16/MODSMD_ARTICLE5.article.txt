# Hunted Sub Disappears
## 
### 
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
(/Pi Accounts of a weird battle
against a submarine in the Golfo
Nuevo created a feeling here yes
teiday the hunted boat has
escaped from a sizable portion of
the Argentine fleet.
Some skepticism has been ex
pressed that a submarine was
there in the first place.
Defense Minister Justo Villar
conferred with President Arturo
Frondizi but declined to disclose
details of the talk.
17-Day Search
The minister said he did not
know if the submarine got away.
The 17-day search has engaged
pei haps a score of ships plus
planes.
There was no word on the
navy's "Operation Sinking," a
last-ditch attack presumably mak
ing use of deptli charges and elec
tronic equipment flown from the
United States.
Charges Ineffective
Argentine depth charges have
been effective only down to 262
feet, while U.S. depth charges can
reach 656 feet. The gulf floor
dips below 500 feet in spots, so a
submarine presumably could dive
below the range of the Argentine
depth charges.
Even though the 10-mile-wide
entrance to the 20-by-40-mile gulf
has been reported blockaded, an
Argentine navy captain just back
from the nautical game of hide
and-seek said the underwater in
truder had sufficient speed to
avoid capture by Argentina's war
ships.
lie insisted a submarine really
had been in the gulf, but rejected
speculation it was a Soviet Union
submarine, something the Soviet
Embassy here has already denied.
"If it were Russian it would try
to hide while observing military
centers in the Golfo Nuevo," he
said.
