# SAC Asks for Airborne Alert
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P> The Air
Force wants Congress to give the
President clear authority to put
the big bombers on continuing
airborne alert and spend Whatever
is needed to keep them there as
long as necessary.
The current defense budget pro
vides only 90 million dollars to
prepare the Strategic Air Force
for such an alert. Admittedly this
would be a drop in the bucket if
SAC were to attempt to keep a
significant portion of its bombers
in the air at all times, safe from
ground attacks, fully armed with
nuclear weapons and ready to re
taliate at once after an atomic
assault.
But Secretary of the Air Force
Dudley C. Sharp and Gene r a 1
Thomas D. White, Air Force chief
of staff, told the Senate Appro
priations Committee Monday that
the 90 million dollars is only part
of the story. Also in the bill is a
provision allowing the President
to spend whatever is necessary
to launch and maintain a full
scale airborne alert and come
back to Congress for the money
later.
General Thomas S. Power, SAC
Commander, said that an alert of
this type could be begun today
but probably could not be main
tained for any length of time be
cause of the heavy added wear
and tear on engines and other
parts.
