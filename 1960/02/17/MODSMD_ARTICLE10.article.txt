## Scientist Says No Single hissing Link in Evolution 
### Marcia Loer 
The role which the discoveries of tlie last twenty-five years have
played in answering the question of the "missing link" was a sub
ject of discussion at a talk given yesterday by Dr. Ronald Singer,
professor of Anatomy at the University of Capetown.
The discoverer of the famed Saldanha skull at Hopefield. South

Ainca spoke on the "Recent An
thropological discoveries in South
ern Africa." Ho brought out the
fact that there appears to be no
single missing link but rather a
large scries of them with whole
chains which diverge from the
central path of evolution.
Dr. Singer pointed out the sim
ilarity between the Neanderthal
type men all over the world. He
believes that the common prac
tice of giving a different species
name to skulls discovered in new
areas is often not correct since
many of these skulls have similar
features.
He cited the resemblance be
tween the Rhodesian and the
Saldanha skulls in South Africa
and the Neanderthal skull in
Germany as an example of this.
Dr. Singer's talk dealt specifi
cally with the Hopefield area of
Southern Africa where he has
done much of his work. He
pointed out that much of the use
fulness of fossils in the study of
the past climate of the area.
Dr. Singer is vice-president of
the South African Association for
Advancement in Science and hon
orary curator of human paleon
tology at the South African Mu
seum in Capetown.
The talk was sponsored by the
Stanford Anthropological Society
and the Committee on Public Ex
ercises.
