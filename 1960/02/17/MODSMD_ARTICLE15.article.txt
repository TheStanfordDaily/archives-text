Baghdad-by-t he-Bay, t heQueen of
the Pacific, she has lured English
men, Russians, Spaniards. Padre
Junipero Serra called her the City
of Saint Francis, to us she's just
"the City."
As others were lured, so are we,
and scores of students flock to
the tip of the Peninsula, to the
Golden Gate City, every Friday
and Saturday night. The idea of
a "big date" and a city date are
symonymous.
Yet Palo Alto-on-lhe-Penin
sula, admittedly less cosmopoli
tan, offers considerable, though
often neglected, opportunities
for culture.
The West Bay Opera Company
will again bring the best in
operatic entertainment to the area
with its presentation of Mozart's
"Marriage of Figaro" this week
end. The complete opera in Eng
lish will he performed at the Palo
Alto Community Theatre, Mel
ville and Middlefield Road. Fri
day at 8:1") p.m., Saturday at
1:30 and 8:15 p.m. and Sunday
at 2:30 p.m.
The opera is produced and di
rected by Gene Chesley, a grad
uate student in the Speech and
Drama Department. Music Di
rector Henry Ilolt, along with his
West Bay Opera work, also was
music director for last year's
Stanford Player's production of
"lolanthe."
There is a double cast with
Richard Grant and l)an Tail as
Figaro, Betty Apperson and
Betsy Allen as the Countess,
and James Standard and Alan
Cathcart as the Count. Tickets
which are $1.50 for both mat
inees and $2 for the evening
performances may be obtained
by phoning l)A 3-6472.
Providing cultural variety in
the area, Palo Alto's newest art
gallery, the Gallery Room of Oul
side at the Inside, will open for
the first time this Sunday with an
invitational showing of the paint
ings of Louis Frangione.
Frangione took his master's
degree at Stanford and won the
Stanford Humanities Award for
his paintings of California mis
sions. His oils and watercolors
of California a n d E u rope a n
scenes, ranging from the purely
representational toward the ab
stract of pure form and color
have won him acclaim as one of
America's most promising young
artists.

Each month there will he a
new show in tlie Gallery Room
which Manager Jerry LeGrand
says is "unusual in that visitors
will he ahle to sit comfortably
and take refreshments while
they View the paintings at their
leisure."
Elsewhere on the Peninsula,
Spanish dancer Jose Greco and
his company will appear at the
San Jose Civic Auditorium Mon
day at 8:30 p.m.
Before leaving on this his sev
enth consecutive tour of tire Unit
ed States, Greco covered Europe,
its concert halls, its opera houses,
Ihe Caves of Ronda and the Sac
romonte as well as the Spanish
coffee-houses, wine cellars and
music halls in quest of his com
pany of thirty or so dancers, sing
ers, and musicians who represent
the very foremost in the Spanish
dance field.
In San Jose also, box office
smash Shelley Berman is to
bring an evening of his sketches
and probingly satirical mono
logues to the Civic Auditorium
next Thursday, Feb. 25.
Complementing Ber men's
unique stool-perching brand of
"penetrating, hilarious observa
tions about the little human foi
bles and failings that we see all
about us," will be the "folk sing
ing for moderns" of the Gateway
Singers also on the program.
On the Farm itself, be the
atmosphere exceedingly less ro
mantically cosmopolitan than
that of the Pacific Queen to
the north, the Vienna Choir
Boys are appearing Sunday at
2:.'io p.m. in Memorial Auditor
ium and promise to charm all
listeners.
"The City" still casts its spell,
however, and Peninsulians will
continue to be lured to her. Once
there, they'll find the Moscow
State Symphony, ending its first
American tour with two concerts
at the Civic Auditorium Saturday
at 8:30 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m.
Tennessee Williams' "Sweet
Bird of Youth" starring Sidney
Blackmer with Geraldine Page
in the role which won her the
IHSK-59 Variety poll of the New
York drama critics for the best
performance of the year by an
actress opens tomorrow night
at the Curran.
And"The 100 Blows," with
Jean-Pierre Leaud, opens Friday
at the Clay Theatre. This new
French classic is winner of the
New York Film Critics Award.
