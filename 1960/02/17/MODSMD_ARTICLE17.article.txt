# Pre-Reg Week to Reflect New Orientation Attitude
## 
### Bill Sterling Pre-Reg Co-Chairman 
The Pre-Reg Commit toe for
j 1959-60 mot more than 1,300
freshmen. Half of thefte returned
the evaluation sheets which were
I given them. The uniformity of
the criticism and suggestion in
j the freshman response suggests
j that the evaluation sheets repre
sent correctly the frosh attitude
toward Pro-Reg Week.
Salad Tossing
The class of 1903 indicated that
the emphasis of Pre-Rcg Week
is above all social. Meeting class
mates is of first and often, it
would seem, of sole importance.
The week is a grand salad toss
ing of names, residences, and
majors, dressed by sophomore in
j trusions and arm-bands. Adminis
trative and geographical orienta
tion are of secondary importance.
There were two suggestions
' which nearly always seemed to
be prevalent among t ho freshmen.
First, more free lime is desir
able and not in scattered minutes
and hours throughout the week
but all at once -so that it can be
utilized.
Informality Preferable
Second, informality and free
dom of movement are preferable
j to the rigid trail-herding teehni-
I ques in which sponsors and pre
i reg-ers appear more as faithful
I Indian companions than as possi
bly helpful upperclassmen.
Activities sufficiently informal
can be expanded, and those where
herding and rigidity curtail com
fortable introductions elminated.
Co-Rec Day, the picnic, the
! song-fest, and the Jolly-Up were
all popular, but the attempt to
| orient students by means of slides
I has failed, and a return to the

previous method of small group I
tours seems advisable.
Rut if two wise and proper
goals of Pre Reg Week in the
past have been to provide incom
ing students with a social and
geographical introduction to the
university, a third goal may well
have been academic introduction.
But this goal seems to have been
incidental, unconscious, and in
general, a by-product. The over
tones have been social, and more
serious undertones have remained
inaudible.
There is in all this analysis,
however, the same unfortunate
dichotomy between classroom
and recreation so often lamented
in Pre Reg addresses. The light
and gay should be combined with
earnest and serious rather than
compart mented.
Indeed those activities where
communication and introductions
were easiest were those whose
purpose was not explicitly social.
Mixing and mingling is inevitable
until Stanford vows itself to the
Benedictine code, which is most
unlikely.
Three Questions
Social integration need not be
forced; it will happen. Pre-Reg
can simply see to it that within
its program there are opportuni
ties for getting.acquainted. But it
can do far more than merely this.
Three questions deserve to bo
asked, and their answers may
well serve as guides toward a
successful program.
What is the student seeking? !
What does ihe University offer? j
What is the most effective way J
to combine the objective of the
first with that of the second?
But success depends not so
much upon the answers which
Pre-Reg provides but rather first
upon the degree to which it raises
the same questions in freshman
minds and second upon the in
formation it provides so that a
freshman can answer the ques
tions himself.
Sincerely Offended
A collegiate career is eminently
individual. Most young under
graduates are sincerely offended
and resentful if one impugns that
they have acted in any conformist
or collective fashion.
It remains the chief duty of
Pre-Reg then to inform incoming
students what choices are before
them. The rationale behind Pre-
Reg is to suggest in what direc
tion student energy can release,
apply, nourish, or dissipate itself.
Pre-Reg can indicate the paths
of individual enterprise besides
the highways of mass action. Bui
it must insist in all cases that one
learns more by moving oneself
be that within a crowd or alone
through intellectual reflection or
athletics than by passively spec
fating.
