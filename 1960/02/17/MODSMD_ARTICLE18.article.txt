# ADMISSIONS POLICY
## Student Diversity Fostered By Geographic Distribution 
### Ross Johnson 
Stanford's student body is char
acterized by the great predomin
ance of Californians. Of a total
registration for Winter quarter of
8,460, California students account
for 5,460 or 65 per cent of the
total. 6,041 students, or 71 per
cent, are from the Pacific Coast
states.
Such an apparent provincialism
in student background may ac
tually be little greater than the
uniformity of background in priv
ate Eastern universities, which
draw a majority of their students
from several New England states.
Nevertheless, Stanford, as all
universities, professes to create
through the existence of a stu
dent body of wide interests and
differing backgrounds an atmos
phere conductive to intellectual
stimulation and personal develop
ment. A wider geographic distri
bution of students at Stanford
would he more likely to foster
such an atmosphere.
Stanford's present admissions
policy involves selection among

i applicants on the basis of their
! high school grades, College Board
scores, and personal recommen
dations, regardless of the part of
the country in which they live.
Such an admissions policy, in con-
I trast to those used at Princeton
and other schools whereby quotas
are established for each state,
does not discriminate against well,
qualified students who apply in
larger numbers from California.
The essence of Stanford's pol
icy should not be altered in sacri
ficing qualifications of applicants
merely for geographical distribu
tion. It would he difficult on the
I basis of present applications to
make a major change in the pro
portions of California and out-of
; state students.
Favors Nou-( alilornians
The present admissions policy ,
! reportedly favors out-of-state ap
plicants in the consideration for
admission of equally well quali
fied students. Closer examination
of applications with the hope oi
expall d in g such procedures
j should he undertaken in the fu
ture.
Major improvement, however,
lin obtaining a more geographi-1
really distributed student body as j
an important slop in the creation
i of a more diverse student opinion
1 without sacrificing student ability
must come through the en
couragement of increased applica
tions from other parts of the
j country.
I Expanded participation in high
| school "College Night" and simi
lar programs would make Stan
ford's opportunities furt her
: known. â€¢
Alumni Groups
Eastern universities make ex
tensive use of alumni groups in
encouraging qualified a p p 1 i c a -
I tions. Junior class awards such
|as the book awards given by
' Harvard and Columbia invite at
tention to these universities.
! Alumni help in extensive inter
| view programs.
While Stanford's alumni are j
neither as numerous nor as well
j organized outside of California as
those of some other universities,
these graduates could be doing
much more to encourage Stan
ford applications. Alumni could
participate in high school infor
: mat ion programs, hold parties for 1
prospective applicants .and con
duct personal interviews.
The percentage of out-of-state
| students at Stanford has slowly
increased in the past ten years. .
Increased emphasis on raising
this percentage should be one
; major effort to increase diverse
opinion among Stanford's student
I body.
