Lasting Peace
Kriitor, The Daily:
I refer to the controversy con-1
corning this year's budget and
the general problem of defense)
expenditure. It would appear that
America's desire to catch up with
the Soviet Union in the current
arms race in order to attain the
security of a nuclear stalemate is
an entirely false and fallacious I
goal.
An alternative is to take Hie
initiative and cease producing
weapons of destruction as soon as I
is practically possible. I
Perhaps 1 he time has come to J
realize that the concept of nu
cleai war is analyagous with mu
tual annihilation and should un
der no circumstances be condoned
or even anticipated by either
party . . .
If we are indeed sorry for those
people "suffering" under the yoke
of Communism perhaps it would
be more prudent for us to exp res*
our sympathy by putting Com- j
munism to the test by indicating
which side can utlimately procure
the better life for its peoples in
peace without fear.
It is surely only by means of
this radical about face in defense
and foreign policy that we shall
achieve the lasting peace without :
tension that the world so desires. â–
