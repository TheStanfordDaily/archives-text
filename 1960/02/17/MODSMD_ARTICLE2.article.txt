## Summit Meet In May Holds World Hopes 
### 
NEW DELHI, India (/P) — A
Soviet - Indian communique said
yesterday the hopes of all men
of peace are centered in the May
summit meeting.
The 1500-word document, signed
at the end of Soviet Premier Ni
kita Khruschchev's five-day visit
to India, reported there is a uni
versal wish that the Paris con
ference "will meet with a full
measure of success." ■
Tribute was paid to leaders of
the great powers, notably Khru
shchev and President Eisenhow
er, whose personal initiative and
coordinated efforts were termed
responsible for "recent favorable
trends in world affairs leading to
a marked lessening in interna
tional tensions."
Khruschchev's attacks on West
ern aid before he flew on to Bur
ma left some Indian officials a
bit unhappy. But they hid their
displeasure in statements express
ing satisfaction with the Soviet
leader's trip.
Many observers, both Indian
and foreign, felt his tour had
failed to come up to expecta
tions.
The communique, however, em
phasized points upon which Khru
shchev and Prime Minister Nehru
see eye-to-eye and said friendship
between India and the Soviet
Union has never been on a firmer
basis.
