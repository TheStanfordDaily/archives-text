rime Marches On
There are only four more basketball games left in the 19G0 Stan
lord season. Well, if this sounds frightening to a few prospective
graduating seniors try this one on for size stalling Saturday Stan
lord will officially open its 1960 tennis season. The net aggregatior
of Coach Bob Kenker has been practicing since early fall and
climaxed their practice period last Saturday with a win over the
California Tennis Club in an exhibition match, 5- 4.
Saturday, the Indians play the Olympic Club in San Francisco,

a team of old veterans that look
over the hill until one sees them
put their canes down on tlie side
of the court and pick up a racquet.
The average age of the Olympic
Club team must be close to forty,
but everyone of the players takes
advantage of a vast number of
years of experience. Leading the
Olympic Club is Tom Brown,
perennial member of tennis' top
ten in the forties and early fifties
and still a pretty fair netter. Two
years ago at the age of 30? Brown
was making short order of last
year's Wimbledon champ Alex
Olmedo.
Along with Brown the Olympic
Club also has Harry Likas one
time semifinalist in the National
Singles Championships il9 4S
year Panclio Gonzales won the
title), Jack Frost, entertaining
and efficient ex-Stanford star, Bill
Crosby, top area player, and other
talented oldsters.
Several of this year's tennis
matches will bring to Stanford

top flight individuals and anyone really interested in the sport will
get a lot to look at.
Besides the match in San Francisco this Saturday, there is anoth
er match scheduled between Stanford and the Olympic Club at Stan
lord. Early in April, Brown and company will he here.
The match which should promote the most local interest this sea
son is I he encounter with the San Diego Marines. Sounds kind of
stale at first until one looks at the San Diego roster. Included on
it Is one time Stanford football and tennis star and now legendary
god of Stanford tennis fans .lack Douglas. A natural would be a
match between Stanford's top man now, Dick Ogden, and the ex-Card
first singler Douglas. Ogden has been heard to say he'd like a shot
at Panciio Gonzales' world title, so here's a likely spot to start his
bid.
All Kinds of Players
Other exciting individuals who will make it to Stanford at one
time or another this season include Chris Crawford, Whitney Reed,
l.arry Nagler, Allan Fox, Bobby Delgado, Fd Atkinson, and Greg
Grant.
C rawford and Reed will be playing in the Northern California
Intercollegiate Championships starting here on the 25th of this
month. Heed, who's almost old enough to play for the Olympic Club
(not really he's 26). will be trying to regain the singles title he won
last year. He plays for San Jose. Crawford also will be out to re
capture a title he was last year's Freshman and Junior College
Champion. He's ;:i Menlo College and will he there at least the re
mainder of this season.
Nagler and Fox will make the scene when UCLA arrives in town
early in May. The Bruins for the umpteenth year in a row boast of
their greatest learn ever. Bruin Coach .1 I). Morgan, a man of many
superlatives, thinks his lineup of Naglar, Fox, Roger Werksnian,
Norm Ferry, Fd Sledge, Forrest Stewart, Mike Bouck. and* Bruce
Campbell (he attended USC a week and took a taxi across town to
enroll al UCLAi is better than his Mike Franks, Mike Green, Jon
Cranston, John Lescli team of two years ago.
USC's team is also slated as a best ever by tennis experts. If
everyone stays eligible (this is a constant problem at USC apparent
ly! it will be a challenge toUCLA's Los Angeles supremacy.
Greg Grant, part time movie star; Ed Atkinson, out last year
when being hit on the head with a bottle affected his playing; Bobby
Delgado, junior sensation of two years ago who plays alternate sea
sons for USC and LA City College; Rafael Asuna, Spanish speaking
sophomore; Fd Guzman, ditto, and Alan Tong who adds a little inter
national flavor to the team are the prospective stars. Rudy Hernando
and Dick Leach also may be on hand if school work doesn't become
overwhelming.

There are only four more basketball games left in the 19G0 Stan
lord season. Well, if this sounds frightening to a few prospective
graduating seniors try this one on for size stalling Saturday Stan
lord will officially open its 1960 tennis season. The net aggregatior
of Coach Bob Kenker has been practicing since early fall and
climaxed their practice period last Saturday with a win over the
California Tennis Club in an exhibition match, 5- 4.
Saturday, the Indians play the Olympic Club in San Francisco,

a team of old veterans that look
over the hill until one sees them
put their canes down on tlie side
of the court and pick up a racquet.
The average age of the Olympic
Club team must be close to forty,
but everyone of the players takes
advantage of a vast number of
years of experience. Leading the
Olympic Club is Tom Brown,
perennial member of tennis' top
ten in the forties and early fifties
and still a pretty fair netter. Two
years ago at the age of 30? Brown
was making short order of last
year's Wimbledon champ Alex
Olmedo.
Along with Brown the Olympic
Club also has Harry Likas one
time semifinalist in the National
Singles Championships il9 4S
year Panclio Gonzales won the
title), Jack Frost, entertaining
and efficient ex-Stanford star, Bill
Crosby, top area player, and other
talented oldsters.
Several of this year's tennis
matches will bring to Stanford

top flight individuals and anyone really interested in the sport will
get a lot to look at.
Besides the match in San Francisco this Saturday, there is anoth
er match scheduled between Stanford and the Olympic Club at Stan
lord. Early in April, Brown and company will he here.
The match which should promote the most local interest this sea
son is I he encounter with the San Diego Marines. Sounds kind of
stale at first until one looks at the San Diego roster. Included on
it Is one time Stanford football and tennis star and now legendary
god of Stanford tennis fans .lack Douglas. A natural would be a
match between Stanford's top man now, Dick Ogden, and the ex-Card

a team of old veterans that look
over the hill until one sees them
put their canes down on tlie side
of the court and pick up a racquet.
The average age of the Olympic
Club team must be close to forty,
but everyone of the players takes
advantage of a vast number of
years of experience. Leading the
Olympic Club is Tom Brown,
perennial member of tennis' top
ten in the forties and early fifties
and still a pretty fair netter. Two
years ago at the age of 30? Brown
was making short order of last
year's Wimbledon champ Alex
Olmedo.
Along with Brown the Olympic
Club also has Harry Likas one
time semifinalist in the National
Singles Championships il9 4S
year Panclio Gonzales won the
title), Jack Frost, entertaining
and efficient ex-Stanford star, Bill
Crosby, top area player, and other
talented oldsters.
Several of this year's tennis
matches will bring to Stanford

top flight individuals and anyone really interested in the sport will
get a lot to look at.
Besides the match in San Francisco this Saturday, there is anoth
er match scheduled between Stanford and the Olympic Club at Stan
lord. Early in April, Brown and company will he here.
The match which should promote the most local interest this sea
son is I he encounter with the San Diego Marines. Sounds kind of
stale at first until one looks at the San Diego roster. Included on
it Is one time Stanford football and tennis star and now legendary
god of Stanford tennis fans .lack Douglas. A natural would be a
match between Stanford's top man now, Dick Ogden, and the ex-Card
first singler Douglas. Ogden has been heard to say he'd like a shot
at Panciio Gonzales' world title, so here's a likely spot to start his
bid.
All Kinds of Players
Other exciting individuals who will make it to Stanford at one
time or another this season include Chris Crawford, Whitney Reed,
l.arry Nagler, Allan Fox, Bobby Delgado, Fd Atkinson, and Greg
Grant.
C rawford and Reed will be playing in the Northern California
Intercollegiate Championships starting here on the 25th of this
month. Heed, who's almost old enough to play for the Olympic Club
(not really he's 26). will be trying to regain the singles title he won
last year. He plays for San Jose. Crawford also will be out to re
capture a title he was last year's Freshman and Junior College
Champion. He's ;:i Menlo College and will he there at least the re
mainder of this season.
Nagler and Fox will make the scene when UCLA arrives in town
early in May. The Bruins for the umpteenth year in a row boast of
their greatest learn ever. Bruin Coach .1 I). Morgan, a man of many
superlatives, thinks his lineup of Naglar, Fox, Roger Werksnian,
Norm Ferry, Fd Sledge, Forrest Stewart, Mike Bouck. and* Bruce
Campbell (he attended USC a week and took a taxi across town to
enroll al UCLAi is better than his Mike Franks, Mike Green, Jon
Cranston, John Lescli team of two years ago.
USC's team is also slated as a best ever by tennis experts. If
everyone stays eligible (this is a constant problem at USC apparent
ly! it will be a challenge toUCLA's Los Angeles supremacy.
Greg Grant, part time movie star; Ed Atkinson, out last year
when being hit on the head with a bottle affected his playing; Bobby
Delgado, junior sensation of two years ago who plays alternate sea
sons for USC and LA City College; Rafael Asuna, Spanish speaking
sophomore; Fd Guzman, ditto, and Alan Tong who adds a little inter
national flavor to the team are the prospective stars. Rudy Hernando
and Dick Leach also may be on hand if school work doesn't become
overwhelming.
