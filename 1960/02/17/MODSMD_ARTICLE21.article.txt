Coach Dutch Fehring is busily
preparing his v a r si t y baseball
earn for its first game of the
960 season against Cat Poly on
r eb. 26.
Fehring will have to solve sev
eral problems before his team
vill be ready for league compe
tition. His biggest headache
ippears to be finding three re
placements for his three outstand
ng outfielders of last year, Rich
DeFabio, Ben Robin so n and
larry Rodda.
The only returning outfielder
rom last year's ball club is John
"lurlbul, a junior who saw limited
iction last year. Co-captain of the
,'rosh team in 1958, Hurlbut had
arm trouble and was forced to
switch from pitching to the out
field in high school. Last year for
he Stanford varsity he hit an
even .400 in five trips to the plate.
Filice io Outfield
To strengthen this vulnerable
position, Fehring has switcher!
•) 1 ay e r s from other positions.
Mike Filice, who was a reserve
infielder on last year's team, is
being given a chance in the out
field. The promising junior fin
ished the 7)9 season with a .133
batting average, but is an excel
lent glove man with good range.
Jim Covvart, a pitcher on last
year's JV team, will also try to
make the change to the outfield.
Cowart made only eight appear
ances at the plate for the varsit\
anrLfinished with a .250 average.
Another outfield possibility is
Lee Moench, the team's leading
hitter last year with a .368 aver
age. Moench played behind the
polished Joe Newkirk at first last
year, and Fehring is undecided as
to where he will play. Mike Berto
let is still another outfielder to
be considered.
.Moench at First?
If used at first, Moench might
be the answer to another of Feh
ring's problems finding a re
placement for Joel Newkirk,
whom he considers to have been
one of the best fielding first base
men in college ranks.
Behind the plate, the Indians
should be strong with Jay Win
ter returning. Winter shared the
catching chores with Art Von

Wronski last year and hit at a
.22-1 clip. His field was a respect
able .957.
The Indians have their two
leading pitchers from last year
returning, Warren Nelson and
Earl Russell. Nelson boasted ihe
best record on the varsity last
year with a 5-0 slate. The senior
right-hander c o m pile d a 3.40
earned-run average.
Russell was the winningest
pitcher on the '59 club with a 0-5
record. He was also the work
horse of the staff, having thrown
91 innings.
Uiideman Good KKA
Top left-hander this season
should be Terry Lindeman, a big,
strong junior with a good curve
and lively fast ball. Lindeman had
a so-so 3-3 record last year but
posted a fine 2.88 ERA.
Marv Mecklenberg, a four-game

| winner for the Indians, will also
return to bolster the mound
corps. Mecklenberg pitched 47
innings in '59 and had a 4.50
I ERA.
Other mound prospects include
Mark Miller, the leading hurler
for Coach Holt/man's frosh team
last year, and Jim Smith, who
did not play frosh ball but shows
promise.
Magee Returns
At second base the Cards will
j have Mike McGee, first-stringer
, from last year's squad. McGee,
I whom Eehring considers a fine
college hitter, compiled a .283
i average.
Hal Schultzmann, with his ex
ceptional range and strong arm.
will probably get the call at short,
although he can also play the out
field.
Rounding out the infield is Jim
Bulk at third. A senior, Bulk
| was third among Stanford hitters
I with a .289 average. He has a
fine arm and is a good man with
; a glove.

.Moench at First?
If used at first, Moench might
be the answer to another of Feh

placement for Joel Newkirk,
whom he considers to have been
one of the best fielding first base
men in college ranks.
Behind the plate, the Indians
should be strong with Jay Win
ter returning. Winter shared the
catching chores with Art Von

Wronski last year and hit at a
.22-1 clip. His field was a respect
able .957.
The Indians have their two
leading pitchers from last year
returning, Warren Nelson and
Earl Russell. Nelson boasted ihe
best record on the varsity last
year with a 5-0 slate. The senior
right-hander c o m pile d a 3.40
earned-run average.
Russell was the winningest
pitcher on the '59 club with a 0-5
record. He was also the work
horse of the staff, having thrown
91 innings.
Uiideman Good KKA
Top left-hander this season
should be Terry Lindeman, a big,
strong junior with a good curve
and lively fast ball. Lindeman had
a so-so 3-3 record last year but
posted a fine 2.88 ERA.
Marv Mecklenberg, a four-game

| winner for the Indians, will also
return to bolster the mound
corps. Mecklenberg pitched 47
innings in '59 and had a 4.50
I ERA.
Other mound prospects include
Mark Miller, the leading hurler
for Coach Holt/man's frosh team
last year, and Jim Smith, who
did not play frosh ball but shows
promise.

At second base the Cards will

, from last year's squad. McGee,
I whom Eehring considers a fine

At second base the Cards will
j have Mike McGee, first-stringer
, from last year's squad. McGee,
I whom Eehring considers a fine
college hitter, compiled a .283
i average.
Hal Schultzmann, with his ex
ceptional range and strong arm.
will probably get the call at short,
although he can also play the out
field.
Rounding out the infield is Jim
Bulk at third. A senior, Bulk
| was third among Stanford hitters
I with a .289 average. He has a
fine arm and is a good man with
; a glove.


STANFORD'S LEE MOEN< II
Slugging first sacker returns
Coach Dutch Fehring is busily
preparing his v a r si t y baseball
earn for its first game of the
960 season against Cat Poly on
r eb. 26.
Fehring will have to solve sev
eral problems before his team
vill be ready for league compe
tition. His biggest headache
ippears to be finding three re
placements for his three outstand
ng outfielders of last year, Rich
DeFabio, Ben Robin so n and
larry Rodda.
The only returning outfielder
rom last year's ball club is John
"lurlbul, a junior who saw limited
iction last year. Co-captain of the
,'rosh team in 1958, Hurlbut had
arm trouble and was forced to
switch from pitching to the out
field in high school. Last year for
he Stanford varsity he hit an
even .400 in five trips to the plate.
Filice io Outfield
To strengthen this vulnerable
position, Fehring has switcher!
•) 1 ay e r s from other positions.
Mike Filice, who was a reserve
infielder on last year's team, is
being given a chance in the out
field. The promising junior fin
ished the 7)9 season with a .133
batting average, but is an excel
lent glove man with good range.
Jim Covvart, a pitcher on last
year's JV team, will also try to
make the change to the outfield.
Cowart made only eight appear
ances at the plate for the varsit\
anrLfinished with a .250 average.
Another outfield possibility is
Lee Moench, the team's leading
hitter last year with a .368 aver
age. Moench played behind the
polished Joe Newkirk at first last
year, and Fehring is undecided as
to where he will play. Mike Berto
let is still another outfielder to
be considered.
.Moench at First?
If used at first, Moench might
be the answer to another of Feh
ring's problems finding a re
placement for Joel Newkirk,
whom he considers to have been
one of the best fielding first base
men in college ranks.
Behind the plate, the Indians
should be strong with Jay Win
ter returning. Winter shared the
catching chores with Art Von

Wronski last year and hit at a
.22-1 clip. His field was a respect
able .957.
The Indians have their two
leading pitchers from last year
returning, Warren Nelson and
Earl Russell. Nelson boasted ihe
best record on the varsity last
year with a 5-0 slate. The senior
right-hander c o m pile d a 3.40
earned-run average.
Russell was the winningest
pitcher on the '59 club with a 0-5
record. He was also the work
horse of the staff, having thrown
91 innings.
Uiideman Good KKA
Top left-hander this season
should be Terry Lindeman, a big,
strong junior with a good curve
and lively fast ball. Lindeman had
a so-so 3-3 record last year but
posted a fine 2.88 ERA.
Marv Mecklenberg, a four-game

| winner for the Indians, will also
return to bolster the mound
corps. Mecklenberg pitched 47
innings in '59 and had a 4.50
I ERA.
Other mound prospects include
Mark Miller, the leading hurler
for Coach Holt/man's frosh team
last year, and Jim Smith, who
did not play frosh ball but shows
promise.
Magee Returns
At second base the Cards will
j have Mike McGee, first-stringer
, from last year's squad. McGee,
I whom Eehring considers a fine
college hitter, compiled a .283
i average.
Hal Schultzmann, with his ex
ceptional range and strong arm.
will probably get the call at short,

field.
