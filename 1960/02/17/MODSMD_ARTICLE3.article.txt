# TEST INSPECTIONS
## Soviets Offer Concession In Geneva Nuclear Talks 
### 
GENEVA (/Hi The Soviet
Union offered a major technical
concession yesterday in rejecting
President Eisenhower's plan for
a partial nuclear test ban treaty.
Semyon K. Tsarapkin told the
three-nation talks the Soviet
Union will accept no treaty unless
all tests, whatever their size and
location, are outlawed simulta
neously.
Then he offered to allow a lim
ited number of mobile Western
inspection teams to go freely to
the site of virtually any earth
tremor in the Soviet Union to
check for possible test violations.
This was a complete reversal of
the previous Soviet position.
A U.S. spokesman said the new
Soviet proposal is unacceptable
in its present form.
Tsarapkin acknowledged his
concession was intended to cut
the ground from under Eisen
hower's Feb. 11 proposal. The
Eisenhower plan would restrict
the treaty to those nuclear tests
which can be policed with present
scientific knowledge. Small tests
underground and some tests in
outer space could continue under

the Eisenhower plan as long as
there was 110 known way of polic
ing them.
Tsarapkin said the American
plan was completely unacceptable
to the Soviet Union. But he sug
gested a three-year program of
joint East-West research to im
prove scientific knowledge of na
tural and artificial earth tremors.
Western officials said the catch
in Tsarapkin's counterproposal is
that many hundreds of inspec
tions would be needed every year
to probe the siie of a reasonable
proportion of natural earth trem
ors in the Soviet Union.
Despite pleas from U.S. Am
bassador James J. Wadsworth
and Britain's Sir Michael Wright,
Tsarapkin refused to be drawn
out on the annual quota of on
the-spot inspections .his proposal
would allow. The Western dele
gates said no realistic estimate
of the proposal could be made
without agreement on the quota.
