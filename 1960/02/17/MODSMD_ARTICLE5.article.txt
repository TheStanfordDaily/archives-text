### Daryl Glenney 
The development of the Mid-
I west as a central reflection of the
I change of twentieth ce nt u r y
i American ideas was described by
; author James T. Parrel), Tuesday
i Evening Series speaker, in Me
morial Auditorium last night.

' Dewey The Role of His Idea"

1 Auditorium.
Social Darwinism
Farrell, author of several novels
of middle class America and an
authority on Chicago and the Mid
west, discussed the attitude of
! "social Darwinism" prevalent in
j America in the late nineteenth
' century - "an attempt to trans
pose the 'survival of the fittest'
theory to the field of society."
The essence of social Darwin
ism, as defined by Farrell, is "the
; man who fails, fails because of
his own incapacity, and deserves
; his fate."
City Dominance
He attributed this economic
and social theory to the closing
of the frontier and the increasing
dominance of large cities over
small towns. "Social Darwinism
I was an attempt to justify irre
sponsibility toward the poor city
masses," Farrell contended,
j "With the growth of the Mid
! dlewest, however, came new pat
terns in the feelings of the
people." continued Farrell. He
cited the writings of Jane Adams
i about her work at Hull House as
the first sympathetic literature
S which hastened the downfall of
. social Darwinism.
In summing up, Farrell quoted
a contemporary writer who ex
claimed. "In our century happi
ness is a new idea." In the last
â–  two decades the Midwest has par
ticularly expressed this convic
tion of man's capacity, he said.
Farrell will also speak tomor
-1 row and Friday at 4:15 in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
