# Ike's Aid Request Strongly Opposed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON l/P) — President Eisenhower's $1,175,000,000 new foreign aid request went to an
election year Congress yesterday. As expected, it ran immediately into a cry of "too much money,
too little change in administration."
In his 5.000-word special message, Eisenhower said the mutual security program is essential to peace
and to world progress in freedom in the face of the "enormous power bloc of Communist imperial-

ism."
"Collective security is not only
sensible it is essential," he said.
The request for new funds was
divided into two billion dollars for
arms aid to America's Allies and
$2,175,000,000 for economic and
technical assistance for the fiscal
year starting next July 1.
The total is almost one billion
dollars more than Congress voted
after a hot debate last year.
The first volley in perhaps even
a stiller fight this year was fired
by Sen. Mike Mansfield of Mon
tana. the assistant Senate Demo
cratic leader. He made the re
mark about too much money and
too little change in administration
and said: "Where is the joint for
eign aid effort, with the other
free nations assuming their share
of the burden?
"Where are t lie plans for a pro
gressive reduction in grants as
distinct from loans? Where is the
progressive shift from military 10
nonmilitary emphasis? Where is
the drastic tightening up and
streamlining administration aid?"
