# INDUSTRIAL PARK
## Extension Explained 
### 
The reasons behind the deci
sion of the Stanford Board of
Trustees to extend the Stanford
Industrial Park were outlined
yesterday by board president Da
vid Packard at a joint Palo Alto
Rotary Club and Chamber of
j Commerce luncheon.
Packard said such an extension
I is of joint benefit to Stanford, to
llie Palo Alto area, and to local
; industry.
He pointed out that "were it
j not for tiie industrial and com
mercial developments on the
i Stanford lands, the Palo Alto
l schools would be in serious finan
, cial trouble today."
The industries themselves bene
fit by the nearness of Stanford
and the attractive environment
i of the Stanford lands.
Stanford profits from the ex
j change of personnel, the joint
j sharing of equipment, and other
advantages such as the proposed
General Telephone and Electron
! ics plant which, although not ac
| tually on the campus, is as val
j uable to the University as indus-
I tries on campus land.
