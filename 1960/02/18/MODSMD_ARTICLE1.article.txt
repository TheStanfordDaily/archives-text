# Congress Moving On Civil Rights
## 
### 
WASHINGTON </l J ) Con
gress moved two stops closer yes
terday toward passage of new
civil lights legislation, but the

end appeared to be weeks away.
The House Rules Committee
which has been taking its time
since last August, agreed infor
mally to clear a bill for House
consideration.
The Senate Rules Committee
received a hill from its chairman,
Sen. Thomas C. Hennings Jr.
(D-Mo.), designed to help South
ern Negroes vote with the aid of
federal officials.
House consideration may come
next month, with March 10 a
likely starting day for debate.
Committee Pressured
The House committee acted un
der pressure. About 209 members
of the House were reported to
have signed a petition that would
take the legislation away from
the committee for direct action.
The bill the House will get
would make il a federal crime
to oppose court orders for racial
integration of schools by force
or threats of force. It would also
require preservation of local vot
ing records, give the FBI a freer
hand in checking on bombings,
and provide schooling for chil
dren of servicemen stationed in
areas where public schools were
closed to avoid mingling of Negro
and white pupils.
Amendments Possible
Amendments to broaden and
tighten the bill probably will be
permitted under the parliamen
tary situation in which it will
reach the House.
The Hennings bill in the Senate
would provide for federal-officers
appointed by the President to
oversee registration, voting and
vote-counting in federal, state
and local elections.
The Hennings plan is much like
the court-appointed referee plan
suggested by Atty. Gen. William
P. Rogers, but a Hennings aide
said it would permit faster action.
