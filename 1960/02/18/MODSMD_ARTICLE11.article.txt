## 
### Bill Reppy 
Professor John H. Bunzel said
in a talk last night that ho be
lieves there is a very good possi
bility Richard Nixon will he elect
ed President in November. Bun
zel discussed "Personalities and
Politics Behind the Democratic
Nomination for President" as the
featured speaker in the Breakers
Eating Club lecture series.
According to Bunzel, a Demo
crat, his party's big problem is to
find an issue on which to cam
paign. "The Republicans will cam
paign on the peace and prosperity
enjoyed under Eisenhower, and
try to associate Nixon with Ike."
Bunzel believes that Sen. John
Kennedy is currently the front
running Democratic candidate for
the presidential nomination. "He
is the most popular with the
people," ho added. However, if
Adlai Stevenson asked for the
nomination tomorrow, he would
L'ct it, Bunzel remarked.

Sen. Stuart Symington has been
quietly building up strength, and
1 there have been rumors that
i Symington has made a deal with
California's Governor Pat Brown
to get the state's HI convention
votes in exchange for promising
Brown second place on the ticket
if Symington won the nomination.
Bunzel remarked that he himself
j did not believe these rumors.
Humphrey Can't Win
Although Sen. Hubert Hum
phrey has impressed many rank
ing Democrats, none of the party
leaders believe Humphrey can
win the nomination. Bunzel said
that Humphrey dominated the
California Democratic Council Is
sue Conference held last weekend
in Fresno, which Bunzel attended
as an adviser. Both Symington
and Kennedy were also at the
meet ing
Sen. Lyndon Johnson will go to
the convention In Los Angeles
with perhaps more first ballot
votes than any other candidate,

i but Johnson has lilllo chance of
adding to his vote total, which
will include Ihc South and Texas,
Bun/.el said.
Catholic on Ticket
Bun/el said that he could not
say at this time which of the
many candidates would win the
nomination, but "there will defi
nitely be a Catholic on the ticket,"
he maintained.
Catholicism will ho an issue in
' the election, Bunzel stated, but it
is not clear at this time whether
it will be as important as many
party people maintain. "Kennedy
is first a politician, then a Catho
lic." Bun/.el remarked. He does
believe in the separation of church
and state.
Bun/.el said that he hoped the
Democratic party would not put
too much emphasis on condemn
ing Nixon for his past.•"Nixon is
a skillful politician who knows
the value of public opinion; we
can expect Nixon to conduct a
higher-level campaign this year."

a skillful politician who knows
the value of public opinion; we
can expect Nixon to conduct a
higher-level campaign this year."
Professor John H. Bunzel said
in a talk last night that ho be
lieves there is a very good possi
bility Richard Nixon will he elect
ed President in November. Bun
zel discussed "Personalities and
Politics Behind the Democratic
Nomination for President" as the
featured speaker in the Breakers
Eating Club lecture series.
According to Bunzel, a Demo
crat, his party's big problem is to
find an issue on which to cam
paign. "The Republicans will cam
paign on the peace and prosperity
enjoyed under Eisenhower, and
try to associate Nixon with Ike."
Bunzel believes that Sen. John
Kennedy is currently the front
running Democratic candidate for
the presidential nomination. "He
is the most popular with the
people," ho added. However, if
Adlai Stevenson asked for the
nomination tomorrow, he would
L'ct it, Bunzel remarked.

Sen. Stuart Symington has been
quietly building up strength, and
1 there have been rumors that
i Symington has made a deal with
California's Governor Pat Brown
to get the state's HI convention
votes in exchange for promising
Brown second place on the ticket
if Symington won the nomination.
Bunzel remarked that he himself
j did not believe these rumors.
Humphrey Can't Win
Although Sen. Hubert Hum
phrey has impressed many rank
ing Democrats, none of the party
leaders believe Humphrey can
win the nomination. Bunzel said
that Humphrey dominated the
California Democratic Council Is
sue Conference held last weekend
in Fresno, which Bunzel attended
as an adviser. Both Symington
and Kennedy were also at the
meet ing
Sen. Lyndon Johnson will go to
the convention In Los Angeles
with perhaps more first ballot
votes than any other candidate,

i but Johnson has lilllo chance of
adding to his vote total, which
will include Ihc South and Texas,
Bun/.el said.
Catholic on Ticket
Bun/el said that he could not
say at this time which of the
many candidates would win the
nomination, but "there will defi
nitely be a Catholic on the ticket,"
he maintained.
Catholicism will ho an issue in
' the election, Bunzel stated, but it
is not clear at this time whether
it will be as important as many
party people maintain. "Kennedy
is first a politician, then a Catho
lic." Bun/.el remarked. He does
believe in the separation of church
and state.
Bun/.el said that he hoped the
Democratic party would not put
too much emphasis on condemn
ing Nixon for his past.•"Nixon is
