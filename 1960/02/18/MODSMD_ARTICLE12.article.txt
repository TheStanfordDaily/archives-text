# U.S. 'Defenses Awesome'--Ike
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/Pi — President Eisenhower yesterday pro
nounced the country's defenses strong, awesome and universally
respected. He hotly denounced as despicable any charge that he has
misled the people on that score.
What triggered something of a presidential outburst yesterday

was word from a newsman that!
critics charge the administration
"has been complacent in advising
the people of the danger we face
in the world" and that economy
may stand in the way of develop
ing new weapons.
The question was whether Ei
senhower believes the administra
tion has misled the American peo
ple in any way or whether any
money has been withheld from
any needed weapon. Grating out
his words, the chief executive re
plied.
"If anybody anybody—believes
that I have deliberately misled the
American people, I'd like to tell
him to his face what I think about
him," he said. "This is a charge
that I think is despicable, and I
have never made it against any
one in the world, and I wouldn't
as long- unless he weie in a bar
of justice somewhere to be tried
for something that was intoler
able."
U.S. Defense History
The President characterized
U.S. defense history from World
War II as first of period of dis
arming, then after the Korean
War, reversing directions and
trying to build an adequate de
terrent power.
"This is what I believe we've
been trying to do with all our
might," Eisenhower said, "and I
get tired of saying that defense is
to be made an excuse for wasting
dollars. 1 don't believe we should ,
pay one cent for defense more j
than we have to.
"But I do say this: Our defense ;
is not only strong, it is awesome,
and it is respected elsewhere."
No Major Variance
Eisenhower also said that
never once, that he knows of, in
moix* than seven years has Vice
President Richard M. Nixon
"been at any major variance with
me."
That was in response to a re
porter who had asked about the
possibility of differences between
the two over the approa'ch to pub
lic problems. Nixon, he noted, has
called for a continuing re-exam
ination of defense.
Eisenhower remarked that no
two men in the world would find
exactly the same methods or use
the same procedures in solving a
difficult problem. But he said Nix
on never had been excluded from
the administration's policy or de
cision - making councils and the
President knows of no major vari
ance.
Duty to Criticize
Nixon said yesterday at Sacra
mento that Democrats have a
duty to criticize the administra
tion's defense policies—and Presi
dent Eisenhower "should vigor
ously dissent.
"I disagree sharply with the
substance of the criticism my
self," Nixon told a news confer
ence here.
He said that sometimes defense
criticism can go so far as to be
incompatible with security inter
ests. but that present Democratic
defense criticism is within the
rights and responsibilities of tiie
opposition party."
Nixon said he believed Presi
dent Eisenhower's angry remarks
about defense policy critics at his
news conference were directed at
the "content" of the criticism and
not at the fact that criticism was
made.

on never had been excluded from
the administration's policy or de
cision - making councils and the
President knows of no major vari
ance.
Duty to Criticize
Nixon said yesterday at Sacra
mento that Democrats have a
duty to criticize the administra
tion's defense policies—and Presi
dent Eisenhower "should vigor
ously dissent.
"I disagree sharply with the
substance of the criticism my
self," Nixon told a news confer
ence here.
He said that sometimes defense
criticism can go so far as to be
incompatible with security inter
ests. but that present Democratic
defense criticism is within the
rights and responsibilities of tiie
opposition party."
Nixon said he believed Presi
dent Eisenhower's angry remarks
about defense policy critics at his
news conference were directed at
the "content" of the criticism and
not at the fact that criticism was
made.
WASHINGTON (/Pi — President Eisenhower yesterday pro
nounced the country's defenses strong, awesome and universally
respected. He hotly denounced as despicable any charge that he has
misled the people on that score.
What triggered something of a presidential outburst yesterday

was word from a newsman that!
critics charge the administration
"has been complacent in advising
the people of the danger we face
in the world" and that economy
may stand in the way of develop
ing new weapons.
The question was whether Ei
senhower believes the administra
tion has misled the American peo
ple in any way or whether any
money has been withheld from
any needed weapon. Grating out
his words, the chief executive re
plied.
"If anybody anybody—believes
that I have deliberately misled the
American people, I'd like to tell
him to his face what I think about
him," he said. "This is a charge
that I think is despicable, and I
have never made it against any
one in the world, and I wouldn't
as long- unless he weie in a bar
of justice somewhere to be tried
for something that was intoler
able."
U.S. Defense History
The President characterized
U.S. defense history from World
War II as first of period of dis
arming, then after the Korean
War, reversing directions and
trying to build an adequate de
terrent power.
"This is what I believe we've
been trying to do with all our
might," Eisenhower said, "and I
get tired of saying that defense is
to be made an excuse for wasting
dollars. 1 don't believe we should ,
pay one cent for defense more j
than we have to.
"But I do say this: Our defense ;
is not only strong, it is awesome,
and it is respected elsewhere."
No Major Variance
Eisenhower also said that
never once, that he knows of, in
moix* than seven years has Vice
President Richard M. Nixon
"been at any major variance with
me."
That was in response to a re
porter who had asked about the
possibility of differences between
the two over the approa'ch to pub
lic problems. Nixon, he noted, has
called for a continuing re-exam
ination of defense.
Eisenhower remarked that no
two men in the world would find
exactly the same methods or use
the same procedures in solving a
difficult problem. But he said Nix
on never had been excluded from
the administration's policy or de
cision - making councils and the
President knows of no major vari
