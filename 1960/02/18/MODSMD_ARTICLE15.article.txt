# 'OFFICIAL' MOONS
## Next Week Bachelors' Big Chance 
### 
The Class of '61 has proclaimed
next week Backhelor YVeek, orga
nizing activities to completely re
verse the conventional Stanford
dating code and to uphold the
tradition of Leap Year.
According to Rich Romer, Bach
elor Week chairman, the ASSU
has officially declared full moons
for next Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday nights, in addition to
Leap Year Night Feb. 29. Due to
astronomical non-cooperation, a
paper moon will be hung in Inner
Quad.
Bachelor Week full moons will
enable Stanford boys to become
Stanford men. All Stanford wom
en, not just seniors, may aid in
the transformation.
'Most Eligible'
Wednesday will feature a noon
rally from Memorial Auditorium
for "Most Eligible Bachelor."
Women's residences will hold
open house in the evening.
A kissing contest among "Most
Eligible Bachelor" candidates will
be held at noon Friday at Engi
neering Corner.
The grand opening of the "new"
Cellar, hailed by a combo and
dancing, will be Thursday at 10:30
p.m. The Class of '61 Ex-Com has
sponsored the renovation of the
old Cellar by installing a juke
box, new curtains and murals.
Sock Hop
A sock hop in Encina Gym fol
lowing the Stanford-USC basket
ball game will climax Bachelor
Week next Friday night. Admis
sion will be 35 cents. The "Most
Eligible Bachelor" will reign over
the dance.
Since few girls have basketball
game tickets, the dance has been
arranged so that couples may at
tend without first attending the
game.
The dance will continue from
9:30- 12:30.
The junior class is hoping to
establish Bachelor Week, a new
idea this year, as a permanent
junior class tradition. All func
tions will be strictly girl-ask-boy.
Exchanges, coffee dates, and
study dates during Bachelor Week
must all be planned by female
initiative. The Class of '61 Ex-
Com expects Stanford women to
invent more variations on the girl
ask-boy theme, including sere
nades of men's dorms.
