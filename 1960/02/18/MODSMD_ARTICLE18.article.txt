## Quarter System Revision Subject of Faculty Debate 
### Frank Morgan Contributing Editor 
Recent discussion concerning
revision of Stanford's quarter sys
tem ha-s not been all idle talk. At
the next meeting of the faculty of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, which includes all Uni
versity departments with Ihe ex
ceptions of the Schools of Engi
ne e r in g , Education, Business,
Law, and Medicine, the question
of the Semester versus the Quar
ter System will be formally de
bated.
To those aware of the present
inadequacies of the Quarter Sys
tem this in itself is an encourag
ing step. The issue was last for
mally debated by the faculty in
1917 when Stanford shifted from
the original Semester to the Quar
ter System. It was considered by
committee in 1932 and again in
1955 with no decisive alterations
recommended.
Dissatisfaction
When a general debate was pro
posed in 1956. the faculty declined
even to consider it. The present
willingness of the faculty to ac
cept the question for debate is
indicative of increasing dissatis
faction with the system as it now
stands.
In preparation for the debate
coming early in March the Hu
manities and Sciences faculty has
been supplied with a summary of
the arguments from both sides
which have been put forth in the
past. The opponents of the Quar
tei System have offered the fol
lowing arguments:
1) The courses are covered 100
rapidly in too short a period.
This is disadvantageous for learn
ing and for contemplative think
ing about the subject.
2) Frequent examinations in
terfere with a calm perusal of the
subject matter.
3 i Too much time and money is
devoted to the "red tape" of
registration, advising, and rec
ord keeping.
'41 The Quarter System does not
allow lime for a "reading period"
at the end of the term.
51 The Quarter System does not
allow proper time for the prepara
tion of term papers.
6) It i-s difficult to arrange se
quential course offerings.
For the Quarter
Those who support the Quarter
System propose the following
arguments:
1) A shift to a Semester sys
tem would increase class size by
50 per cent for those courses of
fered every Quarter.
2» A shift to a Semester sys
tem would obstruct the operation
of "Stanfords Abroad."
3) A shift to the Semester sys
tem would make it difficult for
faculty to take leaves of absence
during the regular academic year.
4> The Quarter System allows
greater flexibility in planning a
course of studies. Students wish
ing to change their programs may
do so more easily.
5) In- addition, proponents of
the Quarter System argue for its

general educational utility: the
Quarter plan utilizes the plant
more effectively, enables stu
dents to progress more rapidly
toward their degrees, and allows
more frequent class meelings.
A return to the Semester Sys
tem now would involve compli
cated reorientation at both ad
ministrative and academic levels.
As the faculty is apparently divid
ed on the issue, it is unlikely that
any sweeping change will be
forthcoming in the near future.
However, even if the faculty
does not reach a consensus on
the over-all merits of the two sys
tems. ii may he possible to focus
attention on some of the weaker
aspects of the Quarter System
and take-steps to correct Ihese
specific deficiencies.
Of most immediate concern re
garding these specific deficiencies
is a review of the sys
tem. Here ii appears that a gen
eral change of policy within the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences is a present possibility.
Discourage Mid-Terms
In a recent memorandum sent
to all faculty members of the
School, Dean Philip Fthinelander
stated: "It was the consensus of
the Executive Committee of the
School at its last meeting that
compulsory mid-quarter examina
tions should generally be dis
couraged, except in courses nor
mally taken by beginning fresh
men.
"It is desired to reduce the feel
ing of continued pressure, of
which many students complain,
and it is believed that mid-quarter
examinations may be a contribut
ing factor. Although some stu
dents seem to prefer frequent ex
aminations in order to have a
constant measure of their pro
gress, it is felt that, except for
beginning freshmen making an
adjustment from high school, our
students should be mature enough
to get on without this kind of
support."
Opt ional
As an alternative Rhinelander
offered: "One possibility which
has been suggested is that mid
quarter examinations might be
optional rather than compulsory."
Accompanying this memoran
dum was a questionnaire sent to
all faculty members of the School
to determine their read ion to an
elimination of mid-quarter exami
nations. Returns from the ques
tionnaire are not yet available,
but indications are thai the fac
ulty is in general agreement with
Ihe proposal.
This action i-s welcome as a
hopeful indication that some of
t fie revisions of the Quarter Sys
tem discusser! in The Daily edi
torials last week may soon be
realized. Any change within the
academic structure of the Univer
sity would demand a measure of
readjustment from both students
and faculty. But by beginning
with specific deficiencies, read
justment can lead to general im
provement on the academic pro
gram and standards.

but indications are thai the fac

Ihe proposal.
This action i-s welcome as a
hopeful indication that some of
t fie revisions of the Quarter Sys
tem discusser! in The Daily edi
torials last week may soon be
realized. Any change within the
academic structure of the Univer
sity would demand a measure of
readjustment from both students
and faculty. But by beginning
with specific deficiencies, read
justment can lead to general im
provement on the academic pro
gram and standards.
Recent discussion concerning
revision of Stanford's quarter sys
tem ha-s not been all idle talk. At
the next meeting of the faculty of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, which includes all Uni
versity departments with Ihe ex
ceptions of the Schools of Engi
ne e r in g , Education, Business,
Law, and Medicine, the question
of the Semester versus the Quar
ter System will be formally de
bated.
To those aware of the present
inadequacies of the Quarter Sys
tem this in itself is an encourag
ing step. The issue was last for
mally debated by the faculty in
1917 when Stanford shifted from
the original Semester to the Quar
ter System. It was considered by
committee in 1932 and again in
1955 with no decisive alterations
recommended.
Dissatisfaction
When a general debate was pro
posed in 1956. the faculty declined
even to consider it. The present
willingness of the faculty to ac
cept the question for debate is
indicative of increasing dissatis
faction with the system as it now
stands.
In preparation for the debate
coming early in March the Hu
manities and Sciences faculty has
been supplied with a summary of
the arguments from both sides
which have been put forth in the
past. The opponents of the Quar
tei System have offered the fol
lowing arguments:
1) The courses are covered 100
rapidly in too short a period.
This is disadvantageous for learn
ing and for contemplative think
ing about the subject.
2) Frequent examinations in
terfere with a calm perusal of the
subject matter.
3 i Too much time and money is
devoted to the "red tape" of
registration, advising, and rec
ord keeping.
'41 The Quarter System does not
allow lime for a "reading period"
at the end of the term.
51 The Quarter System does not
allow proper time for the prepara
tion of term papers.
6) It i-s difficult to arrange se
quential course offerings.
For the Quarter
Those who support the Quarter
System propose the following
arguments:
1) A shift to a Semester sys
tem would increase class size by
50 per cent for those courses of
fered every Quarter.
2» A shift to a Semester sys
tem would obstruct the operation
of "Stanfords Abroad."
3) A shift to the Semester sys
tem would make it difficult for
faculty to take leaves of absence
during the regular academic year.
4> The Quarter System allows
greater flexibility in planning a
course of studies. Students wish
ing to change their programs may
do so more easily.
5) In- addition, proponents of
the Quarter System argue for its

general educational utility: the
Quarter plan utilizes the plant
more effectively, enables stu
dents to progress more rapidly
toward their degrees, and allows
more frequent class meelings.
A return to the Semester Sys
tem now would involve compli
cated reorientation at both ad
ministrative and academic levels.
As the faculty is apparently divid
ed on the issue, it is unlikely that
any sweeping change will be
forthcoming in the near future.
However, even if the faculty
does not reach a consensus on
the over-all merits of the two sys
tems. ii may he possible to focus
attention on some of the weaker
aspects of the Quarter System
and take-steps to correct Ihese
specific deficiencies.
Of most immediate concern re
garding these specific deficiencies
is a review of the sys
tem. Here ii appears that a gen
eral change of policy within the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences is a present possibility.
Discourage Mid-Terms
In a recent memorandum sent
to all faculty members of the
School, Dean Philip Fthinelander
stated: "It was the consensus of
the Executive Committee of the
School at its last meeting that
compulsory mid-quarter examina
tions should generally be dis
couraged, except in courses nor
mally taken by beginning fresh
men.
"It is desired to reduce the feel
ing of continued pressure, of
which many students complain,
and it is believed that mid-quarter
examinations may be a contribut
ing factor. Although some stu
dents seem to prefer frequent ex
aminations in order to have a
constant measure of their pro
gress, it is felt that, except for
beginning freshmen making an
adjustment from high school, our
students should be mature enough
to get on without this kind of
support."
Opt ional
As an alternative Rhinelander
offered: "One possibility which
has been suggested is that mid
quarter examinations might be
optional rather than compulsory."
Accompanying this memoran
dum was a questionnaire sent to
all faculty members of the School
to determine their read ion to an
elimination of mid-quarter exami

offered: "One possibility which
has been suggested is that mid

Accompanying this memoran

all faculty members of the School
to determine their read ion to an

This action i-s welcome as a

tem discusser! in The Daily edi
torials last week may soon be
realized. Any change within the
academic structure of the Univer
sity would demand a measure of
readjustment from both students
and faculty. But by beginning
with specific deficiencies, read
justment can lead to general im
provement on the academic pro
gram and standards.
Recent discussion concerning
revision of Stanford's quarter sys
tem ha-s not been all idle talk. At
the next meeting of the faculty of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, which includes all Uni
versity departments with Ihe ex
ceptions of the Schools of Engi
ne e r in g , Education, Business,
Law, and Medicine, the question
of the Semester versus the Quar
ter System will be formally de
bated.
To those aware of the present
inadequacies of the Quarter Sys
tem this in itself is an encourag
ing step. The issue was last for
mally debated by the faculty in
1917 when Stanford shifted from
the original Semester to the Quar
ter System. It was considered by
committee in 1932 and again in
1955 with no decisive alterations
recommended.
Dissatisfaction
When a general debate was pro
posed in 1956. the faculty declined
even to consider it. The present
willingness of the faculty to ac
cept the question for debate is
indicative of increasing dissatis
faction with the system as it now
stands.
In preparation for the debate
coming early in March the Hu
manities and Sciences faculty has
been supplied with a summary of
the arguments from both sides
which have been put forth in the
past. The opponents of the Quar
tei System have offered the fol
lowing arguments:
1) The courses are covered 100
rapidly in too short a period.
This is disadvantageous for learn
ing and for contemplative think
ing about the subject.
2) Frequent examinations in
terfere with a calm perusal of the
subject matter.
3 i Too much time and money is
devoted to the "red tape" of
registration, advising, and rec
ord keeping.
'41 The Quarter System does not
allow lime for a "reading period"
at the end of the term.
51 The Quarter System does not
allow proper time for the prepara
tion of term papers.
6) It i-s difficult to arrange se
quential course offerings.
For the Quarter
Those who support the Quarter
System propose the following
arguments:
1) A shift to a Semester sys
tem would increase class size by
50 per cent for those courses of
fered every Quarter.
2» A shift to a Semester sys
tem would obstruct the operation
of "Stanfords Abroad."
3) A shift to the Semester sys
tem would make it difficult for
faculty to take leaves of absence
during the regular academic year.
4> The Quarter System allows
greater flexibility in planning a
course of studies. Students wish
ing to change their programs may
do so more easily.
5) In- addition, proponents of
the Quarter System argue for its

general educational utility: the
Quarter plan utilizes the plant
more effectively, enables stu
dents to progress more rapidly
toward their degrees, and allows
more frequent class meelings.
A return to the Semester Sys
tem now would involve compli
cated reorientation at both ad
ministrative and academic levels.
As the faculty is apparently divid
ed on the issue, it is unlikely that
any sweeping change will be
forthcoming in the near future.
However, even if the faculty
does not reach a consensus on
the over-all merits of the two sys
tems. ii may he possible to focus
attention on some of the weaker
aspects of the Quarter System
and take-steps to correct Ihese
specific deficiencies.
Of most immediate concern re
garding these specific deficiencies
is a review of the sys
tem. Here ii appears that a gen
eral change of policy within the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences is a present possibility.
