In a Feb. 8 article in "U.S.
News and World Report," certain
jittery military men attribute the
raging battle on many of tho na
tion's campuses to do away with
compulsory ROTC to a resurg
ence of pacifism, similar to the
movement that occurred in the
U.S. in the 1920s and 30s.
California, Ohio State, Wiscon
sin, and Michigan Stale are
among the universities cited as
revolting against the compulsory
law. Since Ihe article's publica
tion, Michigan State has already
voted against students being
forced to take ROTC. Other
schools that have dropped out
recently are Minnesota, MIT and
Utah State.
The military men state that
such moves are "expected to set
off a chain reaction on many cam
puses, with far-reaching effects
on the training of officers for
U.S. aimed forces."
Army Secretary William M.
Brucker said that if all univer
sities adopt the policy of non
compulsory ROTC the Army will
not be able to get all of the of
ficers it needs.
"Without the compulsory fea
tures of the ROTC program, the
Army's qualitative and quantita
tive peacetime requirements for
14,000 commissioned officers can
not be met," stated Brucker.
But the students just can't
seem to comprehend the militar
ists' fears. Our friends across the
bay are circulating a petition
against compulsory ROTC, which
will be sent to Governor Brown
since he is the governing officer
of the Board of Regents and will
make the final decision on the
program.
Brown has stated that he is
against the program so it appears
that California will soon join the
burgeoning ranks of "traitors."
The California petition lists
four points against tho program:
(It This training does not con
tribute to t educa
tion of the student; (2) This train
ing is repeated in later military
training and can be better and
more fully taught at that time;
(3) The nature of military disci
pline is foreign to the intellectual
freedom necessary to a liberal
education; (4) No provision is
made for those students who con
scientiously object to military
service.
The universities of Wisconsin
and Michigan will vote later this
month on the ROTC problem. Stu
dents at the University of Arizona
have formed the "Students
Against Compuslory ROTC" Com
mittee and have been circulating
petitions on their campus.
UCLA's newly formed political
group, "Platform," was scheduled
to start circulating petitions Mon
day.
A poll taken at Cornell Uni
versity proved beyond a doubt
that tlie Cornellians were against
compulsory ROTC. One student,
however, was rather appalled at
the result: "The revolting part of
the whole situation is the evasion
of a necessary duty merely be
cause it is unpleasant.
"The fact of tho matter is that
ROTC is the best available chan
nel for Cornell students to apply
themselves to this duty in ac
cordance with their abilities.
"It is unfortunate that the pro
gram must be compulsory in
order to graduate a reasonable
number of commissioned officers
from the university, but t his must
be so as long as Cornell students
have so small a sense of respon
sibility and so long as patriotism
is deemphasized except in times

of "hot war."
At the end of WW 11. General
Marshall said: "Though ROTC
graduates composed 12 per cent
of the war officers, its <ROTC>
most important contribution was
Ihe immediate availability of its
product.
"Just what we could have done
in the first phases of our mobili
zation and training without these
men I do-not know. I do know
that our plans would have had to
be greatly curtailed and the
cessation of hosililities on the
European front would have been
delayed."
One would surmise from Gen
eral Marshall's comments and
those of the revolted students',
that the purpose of ROTC is to
make sure that when war comes
there will be enough well-trained
officers to bring the war to a
comparatively quick halt.
But doesn't a person go to col
lege so that he may learn how to
live in peace with his neighbors
rather than to learn how to kill;
them?
Should militarists shudder at j
this growing feeling among stu
dents that ROTC is useless? Bar
ring the unlikely, yet provocative
thought that our military leaders
want war, one would think that j
they as well as all Americans i
would consider student anti-mili-1
tarism a good sign.
Therefore, this column whole
heartedly agrees with the uni
versities who are attempting to
defeat compulsory ROTC. Maybe:
the next step would be to abolish
ROTC altogether.
