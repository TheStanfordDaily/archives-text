Union Bewildering
Editor, The Daily:
Reading Chester Berry's "Pro
gram Suggested for Preliminary
Planning of the Proposed Tresid
der Union" leaves one slightly be
wildered . . .
Lei me briefly sketch Ihe basic
lenents of the plan submitted for
our Tresidder Union and add a
few obvious comments. Berry er
roneously assumes that Stanford's
population is still "one happy
family," not realizing that-lie will
he hard put to find anyone who
is personally acquainted with
more than five per cent of ihe
members of this -stretched - out
family.
It should be made clear to
Berry that in no sense are we one
hig family, but rather- a conglom
eration of small intellectual and
social sub-groups with varied in
terest and diverse purposes.
ri' there is to exist any worth
while intellectual and social life
at all on this campus (outside
labs and lecture rooms), ii will
have to grow from within these
smaller 1 cultural entities, primari
ly living groups, houses, fraterni
ties and eating clubs.
Personalities are developed
and friendships marie in these
smaller units, where tempera
ments clash and characters are
polished in the process. Faculty
residents, faculty associates,
house libraries and the future
clustering of fraternities are all
moves of the University in this
direction.
Big meeting places are abund
antly provided on and around this
campus. What we lack are quiet
nooks within our living quarters,

not a campus ballroom. When .stu-1
dents want to play a piano (out
side the formal practice in the
music department Â», they should
find an opportunity in the (sound
proofed) music rooms of their
houses and not somewhere in a
long line-up of Union piano
rooms.
Bowling alleys ("with auto
matic pinsetters") are available
on HI Camino, and a-s demand in
creases more of them will be
established by the alert entertain
ment business. Part of the Union
funds should be spent on other
facilities. catering more directly
lo the needs of the mind.
