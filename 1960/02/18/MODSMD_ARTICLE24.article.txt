# CEREMONIES TODAY
## Olympic Spectacle Opens 
### Bob Payne 
The largest and most elaborate
Winter Olympic Games ever held
open today at Squaw Valley
a little area a couple hundred
miles east of here that was just
about unknown four years ago.
It doesn't promise to be a very
American function, either.
This is the second time the Win
ter Games (of which these are the
eighth! have been held in the
United States.
Now that a whole raft of crises
have been passed, such as late
snow, then a terrific blizzard, then
an avalanche that blocked the
highway and then this month's
hurricane-type rains the whole
affair seems ready to gel off the
ground.
All this at Squaw Valley, a
place that five years ago way
just a second rate little resori
and now truly owes its fame ant
glamour solely to the gamble that
had it awarded the 1960 Games.
The United States is the host
but Russia promises to be tin
star attraction.

Russia made its first appear
ance at a Winter Olympics in
1956 at Cortina, Italy, stole the
show there/ and could come away
this time with nearly half of the
gold medals.
The Russians are unqualified
favorites in the speed skating
md are a cinch to score well in
the cross-country skiing and
lockey. That's about half the
events light there.
What the Russians don't do,
I he Scandinavian countries and
Austria should do. The United
States will make its best show
ing, as usual, in the figure skat
ng and that would just about be
t except for the finest crop of
American women's alpine skiers
>vor assembled.
Carol Hciss and David Jenkins
ire unchallenged champions of
he women's and men's figure
>kating singles and should clean
ip there with little trouble. And
hree girls. Penny Pitou, Betsy
inite and Linda Meyers, should
lo the U.S. proud in the women's
;lalom events. Other than that,
.lowever, America can just dream.

The U.S. Nordic (cross-country,
etc.) skiers have no chance; tin*
hockey loam*is good, hul consid
erably behind Canada and Russia,
and Bill Disney of Alhambra,
Calif., while one of our linest
evor speed skaters, is probably
no match for the Russians.
Best of the U.S. dark horses is
19-year-old Gene Kotlarek, who
should give the favored Finns,
Norwegians and Germans plenty
of trouble in the ski jump.
The United Stales will lie an
interested rooter as slightly fav
ored Canada tries to regain the
hockey gold medal it shockingly
lost to tlie Russians iti 1956.
Hockey competition should be
some of the hottest of the Games.
Austria should easily rule the
men's alpine events! slalom,
downhill, ets.) now that Ameri
ca's big hope, Buddy Werner, is
out with a broken leg. France
may have the world's best skier
in Adrien Duvillard.
But the story is this: Russia
is strong almost everywhere, the
rest strong only in spots. They
should be a Red Games.

The Russians are unqualified
favorites in the speed skating
md are a cinch to score well in
the cross-country skiing and

events light there.
What the Russians don't do,
