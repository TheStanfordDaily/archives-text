"Walt Heinccko. eh." Don Liehcndorfer clasped his hands behind
his head, leaned back in his chair and smiled as the memories of his
old friend who died a little loss than two weeks ago came rolling in.
"Pound for pound he war. the greatest football player that ever
came to Stanford," said Stanford's sports publicity director, referring
to the phrase that was often used in talking about the ex-middle
weight champion of New York and Massachusetts.
"He was a little guy,»for a lineman, only 5-7 and he only weighed
174. When he came off tho bench he looked like somebody's little
boy who had wandered down trom the stands onto the field. He had
, i .hort legs too, what you call a real low-crotch.
"In the 192S Rose Bowl game Walt saved the day with hifc nose.

"We wore playing Pittsburgh
led by their great hack Gibbie
Welsh. Walt was only a dirty
nosed little sophomore playing
second .string right tackle at the
time behind Chris Freeman. Well,
Pitt scored in the third quarter to
go ahead <5-0.
"Pop had an instinct and put
Walt in at tackle for Freeman to
try to block the point. Walt went
in so fast that instead of blocking
the ball with his hands, it hit
him square on the nose. We
scored later and won 7-6. Walt
carried the scar of that blocked
kick all his life."
Pop. for the uninitiated, is Pop
Warner, the now legendary figure
who was coaching the Tribe at
(lie time.
"Walt was one of Pop's favor
ites," Liebendorfer said, "in spite
of the fact that he had two and
nine-tenths strikes against him.
Pop always liked big men in the
line, so Walt really had to work to
make Pop even look at him.

"Talk about overcoming odds. When Walt came here in 1926, Ihe
doctor who gave him his regulai freshman physical examination
found a heart murmur. 'No football for you,' he said.
"Walt flew into a rage. His folks came up from his home in
Santa Ana and went straight t<> Ray Lyman Wilbur, Stanford's presi
dent. They said that it would break his heart if he couldn't play
foot ball.
"I never found out if Wilbur, who was a medical man, ever actually
examined Walt himself, but evidently he was satisfied that the
condition was not serious and after Walt's folks signed a release, he
let him play. That's what he died of, though, a heart attack.
Ileiiiecke*, Robesky, and Post
"Walt anchored the greatest center trio in Stanford history. Don
Robesky was at one guard and Dynie Post was at the other."
Dynie, it seems, is short for Dynamite which was the nickname
given to Seraphim Post, who is now assistant business manager of
the University.
"Either Robesky or Post made every Ail-American team in 1928
there was. Although neither of them was ever on the same Ail-
American team, each had more A-A choices than any other guard
in the country.
"Wall made Walter Camp's 1928 All-American team as a twelfth
man.
"That '28 team was really a good one, but it was erratic. Pop
used a lot of reverses which often lead to fumbles. We lost to SC
that year 10-0 even ihough we gained 525 yards to SC's 12.1. We lost
the ball five times inside their five yard line in the first half alone.
6 Yoirre (Irazy*
"That was the year we played Army in Yankee Stadium the week
after Big Game. We pulled off a 2(i-0 upset.
"On the first play of that game a big referee blew his whistle,
picked up the ball and started walking toward our goal line. Walt
ran up to him and said:
"What's that for?"
"Offside," said the rcf, pointing to the right end. "It'll
cost you live yards."
"You're crazy," said Walt.
"That'll cost you 15 more," replied the rcf.
"Aw. you're not THAT crazy," Walt said apolgetieally.
"The rcf laughed so hard that ho forgot about the extra penalty."
Liebendorfer smiled and said. "Everybody admired his guts."

"Walt anchored the greatest center trio in Stanford history. Don
Robesky was at one guard and Dynie Post was at the other."
Dynie, it seems, is short for Dynamite which was the nickname
given to Seraphim Post, who is now assistant business manager of
the University.
"Either Robesky or Post made every Ail-American team in 1928
there was. Although neither of them was ever on the same Ail-
American team, each had more A-A choices than any other guard
in the country.
"Wall made Walter Camp's 1928 All-American team as a twelfth
man.
"That '28 team was really a good one, but it was erratic. Pop
used a lot of reverses which often lead to fumbles. We lost to SC
that year 10-0 even ihough we gained 525 yards to SC's 12.1. We lost
the ball five times inside their five yard line in the first half alone.

ran up to him and said:

American team, each had more A-A choices than any other guard
in the country.
"Wall made Walter Camp's 1928 All-American team as a twelfth
man.
"That '28 team was really a good one, but it was erratic. Pop
used a lot of reverses which often lead to fumbles. We lost to SC
that year 10-0 even ihough we gained 525 yards to SC's 12.1. We lost
the ball five times inside their five yard line in the first half alone.

"That was the year we played Army in Yankee Stadium the week
after Big Game. We pulled off a 2(i-0 upset.
"On the first play of that game a big referee blew his whistle,
picked up the ball and started walking toward our goal line. Walt
ran up to him and said:
"What's that for?"
"Offside," said the rcf, pointing to the right end. "It'll
cost you live yards."
"You're crazy," said Walt.
"That'll cost you 15 more," replied the rcf.
"Aw. you're not THAT crazy," Walt said apolgetieally.
"The rcf laughed so hard that ho forgot about the extra penalty."
Liebendorfer smiled and said. "Everybody admired his guts."



Walt hi:im;( ki:
A real low-crotch
"Walt Heinccko. eh." Don Liehcndorfer clasped his hands behind
his head, leaned back in his chair and smiled as the memories of his
old friend who died a little loss than two weeks ago came rolling in.
"Pound for pound he war. the greatest football player that ever
came to Stanford," said Stanford's sports publicity director, referring
to the phrase that was often used in talking about the ex-middle
weight champion of New York and Massachusetts.
"He was a little guy,»for a lineman, only 5-7 and he only weighed
174. When he came off tho bench he looked like somebody's little
boy who had wandered down trom the stands onto the field. He had
, i .hort legs too, what you call a real low-crotch.
"In the 192S Rose Bowl game Walt saved the day with hifc nose.

"We wore playing Pittsburgh
led by their great hack Gibbie
Welsh. Walt was only a dirty
nosed little sophomore playing
second .string right tackle at the
time behind Chris Freeman. Well,
Pitt scored in the third quarter to
go ahead <5-0.
"Pop had an instinct and put
Walt in at tackle for Freeman to
try to block the point. Walt went
in so fast that instead of blocking
the ball with his hands, it hit
him square on the nose. We
scored later and won 7-6. Walt
carried the scar of that blocked
kick all his life."
Pop. for the uninitiated, is Pop
Warner, the now legendary figure
who was coaching the Tribe at
(lie time.
"Walt was one of Pop's favor
ites," Liebendorfer said, "in spite
of the fact that he had two and
nine-tenths strikes against him.
Pop always liked big men in the
line, so Walt really had to work to
make Pop even look at him.

"Talk about overcoming odds. When Walt came here in 1926, Ihe
doctor who gave him his regulai freshman physical examination
found a heart murmur. 'No football for you,' he said.
"Walt flew into a rage. His folks came up from his home in
Santa Ana and went straight t<> Ray Lyman Wilbur, Stanford's presi
dent. They said that it would break his heart if he couldn't play
foot ball.
"I never found out if Wilbur, who was a medical man, ever actually
examined Walt himself, but evidently he was satisfied that the
condition was not serious and after Walt's folks signed a release, he
let him play. That's what he died of, though, a heart attack.
Ileiiiecke*, Robesky, and Post
"Walt anchored the greatest center trio in Stanford history. Don
Robesky was at one guard and Dynie Post was at the other."
Dynie, it seems, is short for Dynamite which was the nickname
given to Seraphim Post, who is now assistant business manager of
the University.
"Either Robesky or Post made every Ail-American team in 1928
there was. Although neither of them was ever on the same Ail-
American team, each had more A-A choices than any other guard
in the country.
