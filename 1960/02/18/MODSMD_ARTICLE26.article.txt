# BOUTS TONIGHT
## Card Matmen Face Broncos, Seek 4th Win 
### 
The Stanford wrestling team
travels to Santa Clara tonight to
take on the Broncos in a lull card
of bouts. It will be the seventh
outing for the Card grapplers,
who will be looking for their
fourth win.
They will return home again
Feb. 20 to tangle with San Fran
cisco State.
Stanford holds victories over
two service teams, Moffett Field
and Treasure Island, and San
Jose State. In their last outing,
the Card wrestlers made their
best showing of the season in
beating Moffett Field, 33-5, losing
only one match.
Santa Clara is rated stronger
than last season, when the Stan
ford team ho;tt them. But they
lack the experience of Coach Jack
McKenna's crew.
McKenna will send his regular
eight men to the mats against
the Broncos. Tom Snoke will
handle the 123-pound chores for
the Indians against a yet un
named opponent. Tom's brother,
Art, will meet Bob Donnegar at
130 pounds.
At 137, it will bo Leo Stephen
son for the Indians and Larry
Dompsey for Santa Clara, and
Stanford's Pete Barnhisel takes
to the mats against Ron Ander
son. Card Phil Murphy will tangle
with Fred Domino at 157.
In a 107-pound match, Stanford
will ho ;ihly represented by Frank
Redle, who meets Jim Connolly
of the Broncos. At 177, Stanford
veteran Dick Denny meets Boh
Fox. Card Skip Pew at the heavy
weight spot will moot John Ku
