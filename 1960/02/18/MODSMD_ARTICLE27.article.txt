# Stanford Faces One-Game Cage Weekend; Visit UCLA
## 
### Ken Dery 
Stanford's never-say-die basket
bailers travel south this weekend
to battle fast-finishing UCLA. The
Indians, twice-beaten this season
by the south landers, are faced
with the refreshing situation of
their first single-game weekend
in six weeks.
The Bruins find themselves in
a tougher spot they must beat
I the Cards are give up their big
dream. Trailing league - leading
i California by only one game in
the loss column, they can still
tie for AAWU top honors by
; sweeping their five remaining
I games.
Coach John Wooden's youthful
I charges have won four of their
I last five games and for the first
I time in three weeks will be at
full strength.
Two Ankles
Versatile Kent Miller is healthy
again, having doubled his supply
of good ankles. The 6-0 210-pound
j un i or was his team's second
leading scorer when he was side
lined after an accident iti a prac
tice session.
A tough boardman and shooter,
Miller started every game last
year at forward and on occasion
even moved into the center slot.
His return will add measurably
in these closing weeks of the
! season.

Center John Berberich has con
sistently been the big scoring
threat and is currently averaging
10.4 points per game. Also one
of the league leaders in rebound
ing, the 6-8 pivot man has done
a remarkable job this season in
coming all the way from second
stringer to team leader in three
departments scoring, rebound
ing and field goal percentages.
Stanford fans should remember
forwards Gary Cunningham and
Pete Blackman, for they topped
their team in Friday's win here
with 14 and 11 points respec
t ively.
Steady Forwards
Both play a sl«ady-type game
and, with Miller, have more than
help up their part of the scoring.
Guards John Green and Bill
Ellis round out the starting line
up and are the second and third
high scorers for the campaign.
In a balanced attack that fea
tures five or six men scoring in
the neighborhood of S-10 points
a game, Ellis and Green have
done the job of setting up the
plays.

10.4 points per game. Also one
of the league leaders in rebound
ing, the 6-8 pivot man has done
a remarkable job this season in
coming all the way from second
stringer to team leader in three
departments scoring, rebound
ing and field goal percentages.
Stanford fans should remember
forwards Gary Cunningham and
Pete Blackman, for they topped
their team in Friday's win here
with 14 and 11 points respec
t ively.
Steady Forwards
Both play a sl«ady-type game
and, with Miller, have more than
help up their part of the scoring.
Guards John Green and Bill
Ellis round out the starting line
up and are the second and third
high scorers for the campaign.
In a balanced attack that fea
tures five or six men scoring in
the neighborhood of S-10 points
a game, Ellis and Green have
done the job of setting up the
plays.


BUB BOWIJNG GOES IN FOR LAYUr—DESPITE BILL ELLIS
Saturday scene could bo repeated this weekend
Stanford's never-say-die basket
bailers travel south this weekend
to battle fast-finishing UCLA. The
Indians, twice-beaten this season
by the south landers, are faced
with the refreshing situation of
their first single-game weekend
in six weeks.
The Bruins find themselves in
a tougher spot they must beat
I the Cards are give up their big
dream. Trailing league - leading
i California by only one game in
the loss column, they can still
tie for AAWU top honors by
; sweeping their five remaining
I games.
Coach John Wooden's youthful
I charges have won four of their
I last five games and for the first
I time in three weeks will be at
full strength.
Two Ankles
Versatile Kent Miller is healthy
again, having doubled his supply
of good ankles. The 6-0 210-pound
j un i or was his team's second
leading scorer when he was side
lined after an accident iti a prac
tice session.
A tough boardman and shooter,
Miller started every game last
year at forward and on occasion
even moved into the center slot.
His return will add measurably
in these closing weeks of the
! season.

Center John Berberich has con
sistently been the big scoring
threat and is currently averaging
10.4 points per game. Also one
of the league leaders in rebound
ing, the 6-8 pivot man has done
a remarkable job this season in
coming all the way from second
