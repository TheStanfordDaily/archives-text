# It's a Routine Week for Stats; Bears Hold Team Leaderships
## 
### 
Last weekend was formful in
AAWU basketball things like
California winning, Stanford
splitting and (.JSC losing. So it's
not much surprise to find the
latest statistics also pretty rou
tine.
The most interesting thing
about this week's figures is the
fact that three categories are
missing due to incomplete reports
on the most recent games.
But where figures are available,
California is found in its ho-hum
position as the Big 5 leader in
offense and defense in addition
to the standings.
The Bears have a healthy 12.2
point spread between what they're
scoring 60.6 and what their
foes arc scoring 47.5. For what
it's worth. USC is scoring at the
same rate as Stanford is defend
ing 56.7. Yet Saturday's game
wasn't a tie!
The Tribe stands second in
offense at 58.4, and third in de
fense. Washington has the big
gest deficit, 7.2 points per game.
In individual scoring (where
figures did come through) Bill

Hanson of Washington stayed on
top although (or because I the
Huskies were idle. He's pouring
through 1 6.7 points every time
out more than one-third ol the
Washington offense.
John Arrillaga stands third in
total point.s with 98, but lias
played only seven games com
pared to nine for Hanson and
eight for second - place Darrall
Imhoff of California.
