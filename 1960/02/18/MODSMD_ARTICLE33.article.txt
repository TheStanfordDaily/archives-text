THE THUNDERING MARCH OF PROGRESS
Today, as everyone knows, is the forty-sixth anniversary of the
founding of (iransmire College for Women, which, as everyone
knows, was the first Progressive Education college in the
United States.
Well do 1 recollect the tizzy in the academic world when
(Iransmire opened its portals! What a buzz there was, what a
brouhaha in faculty common rooms, what a rattling of teacups,
when Dr. Agnes Tluidd Sigafoos, first president of (iransmire,
lifted her learned old head and announced defiantly, "We will
teach the student, not the course. There will be no marks, no
exams, no requirements. This, by George, is Progressive
Education!"
Well sir, forward-looking maidens all over the country cast
off their fetters and came rushing to New Hampshire to enroll
at (iransmire. lb-re they found freedom. They broadened their
vistas. They lengthened their horizons. They unstopped their
bottled personalities. They roamed the campus in togas, lead
ing ocelots on leashes.
And, of course, they smoked Marlboro cigarettes. (I say, "Of
course." Why do I say, "Of course"? I say,"Of course" because
it is a matter of course that anyone in search of freedom should
naturally turn to Marlboro, for Marlboro is the smoke that sets
the spirit soaring, that unyokes the captive soul, that fills the
air with the murmur of wings. If you think flavor went out
when filters came in—try Marlboro. The}' are sold in soft pack
or flip-top box wherever freedom rings.)
Hut all was not Marlboro and ocelots for the girls of (Irans
mire. There was work and study too—not in the ordinary sense,
tu be sure, for there were no formal classes. Instead there was
a broad approach to enlarging each girl's potentials, both mental
and physical.
Take, for example, the course called H.M.S. (basic Motor
Skills). H.M.S. was divided into L.D. (Lying Down), S.l'.
(Standing l p) and W. (Walking). Once the student had mas
tered L.D. and S.l*., she was taught to W.—but not just to W.
any old way! No, sir! She was taught to W. with poise,
dignity, bearing! To inculcate a sense of balance in the girl,
she began her exercises by walking with a suitcase in each hand.
(One girl, Mary KUen Dorgenicht, got so good at it that today
she is bell captain at the Deshler-llilton Hotel in Columbus,
Ohio.) „

When the girls had \v:«lkinji under their holts, thov were
allowed to (lance. Again no formality was imposed. They were
simply told to fling themselves ahout in any way their impulses
dictated, and, believe you me, it was quite an impressive sight
to see them go hounding into the woods with their togas flying.
(Several later joined the I .S. Forestry Service.)
There was also a lot of finger painting and sculpture with
coat hangers and like that, and soon the fresh wind of I'roures-
Mvisin came whistling out of (iransmire to hlow the ancient dust
of pedantry off curricula everywhere, and today, thanks to the
pioneers at (iransmire, we are all free.
If you arc ever in New Hampshire, he sure to visit the (irans
mire campus. It is now a tannery, e two m»x shuim™

THE THUNDERING MARCH OF PROGRESS
Today, as everyone knows, is the forty-sixth anniversary of the
founding of (iransmire College for Women, which, as everyone
knows, was the first Progressive Education college in the
United States.
Well do 1 recollect the tizzy in the academic world when
(Iransmire opened its portals! What a buzz there was, what a
brouhaha in faculty common rooms, what a rattling of teacups,
when Dr. Agnes Tluidd Sigafoos, first president of (iransmire,
lifted her learned old head and announced defiantly, "We will
teach the student, not the course. There will be no marks, no
exams, no requirements. This, by George, is Progressive
Education!"
Well sir, forward-looking maidens all over the country cast
off their fetters and came rushing to New Hampshire to enroll
at (iransmire. lb-re they found freedom. They broadened their
vistas. They lengthened their horizons. They unstopped their
bottled personalities. They roamed the campus in togas, lead
ing ocelots on leashes.
And, of course, they smoked Marlboro cigarettes. (I say, "Of
course." Why do I say, "Of course"? I say,"Of course" because
it is a matter of course that anyone in search of freedom should
naturally turn to Marlboro, for Marlboro is the smoke that sets
the spirit soaring, that unyokes the captive soul, that fills the
air with the murmur of wings. If you think flavor went out
when filters came in—try Marlboro. The}' are sold in soft pack
or flip-top box wherever freedom rings.)
Hut all was not Marlboro and ocelots for the girls of (Irans
mire. There was work and study too—not in the ordinary sense,
tu be sure, for there were no formal classes. Instead there was
a broad approach to enlarging each girl's potentials, both mental
and physical.
Take, for example, the course called H.M.S. (basic Motor
Skills). H.M.S. was divided into L.D. (Lying Down), S.l'.
(Standing l p) and W. (Walking). Once the student had mas
tered L.D. and S.l*., she was taught to W.—but not just to W.
any old way! No, sir! She was taught to W. with poise,
dignity, bearing! To inculcate a sense of balance in the girl,
she began her exercises by walking with a suitcase in each hand.
