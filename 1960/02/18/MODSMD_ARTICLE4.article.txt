# TIME RUNNING OUT
## Courts Reject Chessman Bid 
### 
SAN QUENTIN I/O) Caryl
Chessman's desperate, 11th hour
appeals yesterday were rejected
by the highest courts in the Unit
ed States and California and
apparently by Gov. Edmund G.
Brown.
As the hours ticked toward the
convict-author's date with death
at 10 a.m. tomorrow, these were
the swift developments:
• The U.S. Supreme Court re
jected without comment Chess
man's appeal for a writ of habeas
corpus and a stay of execution.
• Chessman held a news confer
ence, which included a number of
foreign correspondents, and said
his 12-year court battle to escape
the gas chamber '"is all over."
Court Denies
• The State Supreme Court, after
deliberating 1 hour and 50 min
utes, voted 4 to 3 against recom
mending clemency.
• And, at sundown, Gov. Brown
issued a statement saying that
Chessman must die unless the
State Supreme Court reconsiders
its clemency vote today.
• Chessman's attorney, George
T. Davis, said after the gover
nor's latest statement he would
petition the state court this
morning for a reconsideration of
its 4-3 vote.
Last Hope
Chessman's last hope is that
Davis might persuade one mem
ber of the seven-justice supreme
court to change his vote.
Meanwhile, a group of students
announced plans to march to San
Quentin Prison today to protest
tomorrow's scheduled execution
and capital punishment.
18-Mile March
Bruce Benner, 20, a San Fran
cisco State College junior in psy
chology, said the group would
start an 18-mile march from the
Golden Gate Bridge parking lot
about 8 a.m.
"There sh o u 1 d be about 20
marchers," Bonner said. "Some
people will catch up with us from
Stanford, California and San Jose
State.
"We are going to carry signs
protesting both Chessman's exe
cution and capital punishment as
a whole. We plan to picket at the
west gate of the prison."

Bruce Benner, 20, a San Fran
cisco State College junior in psy
chology, said the group would
start an 18-mile march from the
Golden Gate Bridge parking lot
about 8 a.m.
"There sh o u 1 d be about 20
marchers," Bonner said. "Some
people will catch up with us from
Stanford, California and San Jose
State.
"We are going to carry signs
protesting both Chessman's exe
cution and capital punishment as
a whole. We plan to picket at the
west gate of the prison."
SAN QUENTIN I/O) Caryl
Chessman's desperate, 11th hour
appeals yesterday were rejected
by the highest courts in the Unit
ed States and California and
apparently by Gov. Edmund G.
Brown.
As the hours ticked toward the
convict-author's date with death
at 10 a.m. tomorrow, these were
the swift developments:
• The U.S. Supreme Court re
jected without comment Chess
man's appeal for a writ of habeas
corpus and a stay of execution.
• Chessman held a news confer
ence, which included a number of
foreign correspondents, and said
his 12-year court battle to escape
the gas chamber '"is all over."
Court Denies
• The State Supreme Court, after
deliberating 1 hour and 50 min
utes, voted 4 to 3 against recom
mending clemency.
• And, at sundown, Gov. Brown
issued a statement saying that
Chessman must die unless the
State Supreme Court reconsiders
its clemency vote today.
• Chessman's attorney, George
T. Davis, said after the gover
nor's latest statement he would
petition the state court this
morning for a reconsideration of
its 4-3 vote.
Last Hope
Chessman's last hope is that
Davis might persuade one mem
ber of the seven-justice supreme
court to change his vote.
Meanwhile, a group of students
announced plans to march to San
Quentin Prison today to protest
tomorrow's scheduled execution
and capital punishment.
