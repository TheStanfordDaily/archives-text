## Author Farrell Says Midwest Spurred Dewey's Philosophy 
### Fran Fisher 
"If John Dewey had not moved
to the Midwest, he might never
have been the great philosopher
that he was," stated James T.
Farrell yesterday in the second
of his series of four talks on

American Literature. He spoke
on "John Dewey The Role of
His Idea."
Farrell will speak today on
"Theodore Dreiser and Litera
ture" and tomorrow on "Culture
and Chicago" at 4:15 in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
Supporting his statement, Far
rell said that because the Mid
west was not entrenched in the
strict European academic and
religious regulations, il allowed
Dewey to develop his own ideas.
The lack of existing theories
there in the later 19th century
gave greater impact to Dewey's
philosophy.

"Dewey's main contributions to
his age were his courage to work
toward a new theory of knowl
edge and his recognition of the
role of the inner impulses in the
child." said Farrell.
He continued in saying that
Dewey's ideas contrasted with the
popular theories of the French
rationalists, but that Dewey was
influenced strongly by two Euro
peans, Hegal and Darwin. These
two men added optimism to Dew
ey's thought by their conceptions
of history as a changing process
of progression, and Darwin espe
cially gave him a more scienti
fic outlook, resulting in Dewey's
study of human behavior.
New Ambition
Developed during the expan
sion of industry in the Middle
west. Dewey's ideas added hu
man) iy to an age of rugged
individualism. While the Social
Darwinists cried for the survival
of the fittest among men during
this time of transition from rural
to urban life, the general attitude
was one of each looking out for
himself.
Dewey conceived a new type of
ambition one in which men
worked toward I lie benefit of

others. This concept inspired the
new generation of the late "1900's,
who later became part of the
New Deal.
Thus, Dewe y ' s ideas have
helped in the formation of a new
concept of the democratic man
in America, said Farrell.
He concluded by saying that we
in this time have no right to look
back on men like Dewey and
ridicule their optimism.

Supporting his statement, Far
rell said that because the Mid
west was not entrenched in the
strict European academic and
religious regulations, il allowed
Dewey to develop his own ideas.
The lack of existing theories
there in the later 19th century
gave greater impact to Dewey's
philosophy.
European Influence
"Dewey's main contributions to
his age were his courage to work
toward a new theory of knowl
edge and his recognition of the
role of the inner impulses in the
child." said Farrell.
He continued in saying that
Dewey's ideas contrasted with the
popular theories of the French
rationalists, but that Dewey was
influenced strongly by two Euro
peans, Hegal and Darwin. These
two men added optimism to Dew
ey's thought by their conceptions
of history as a changing process
of progression, and Darwin espe
cially gave him a more scienti
fic outlook, resulting in Dewey's
study of human behavior.
New Ambition
Developed during the expan
sion of industry in the Middle
west. Dewey's ideas added hu
man) iy to an age of rugged
individualism. While the Social
Darwinists cried for the survival
of the fittest among men during
this time of transition from rural
to urban life, the general attitude
was one of each looking out for
himself.
Dewey conceived a new type of
ambition one in which men
worked toward I lie benefit of

others. This concept inspired the
new generation of the late "1900's,
who later became part of the
New Deal.
Thus, Dewe y ' s ideas have
helped in the formation of a new
concept of the democratic man
in America, said Farrell.
He concluded by saying that we
in this time have no right to look
back on men like Dewey and
ridicule their optimism.
"If John Dewey had not moved
to the Midwest, he might never
have been the great philosopher
that he was," stated James T.
Farrell yesterday in the second

American Literature. He spoke
on "John Dewey The Role of
His Idea."
Farrell will speak today on
"Theodore Dreiser and Litera
ture" and tomorrow on "Culture
