# Protests Bring Land Rezoning

The controversial 80-acre indus
trial site owned by Stanford in
the foothills area near Los Altos
Hills was today deleted from the
general industrial zoning plan of
the area.
Homeowners of the area made
their protests to the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission to
keep the land from becoming
commercialized. The Stanford
owned land is reportedly to be
leased to Ampex Corporation.
The commission's action may
be meaningless because the land
is expected to be annexed to Palo
Alto for installation of utilities,
just as all other industries in Ihe
Stanford Industrial Park have
been annxed. Palo Alto then
would have jurisdiction over the
zoning.
