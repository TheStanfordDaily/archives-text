## Russian Offensive 
### Dick White Contributing Editor 
Russia's now offensive is now
proceeding with great rapidity.
Following World War II there
was the five-year period of politi
cal expansion when Communist
parties took over much of East
ern Europe and all of China. This
was. ended by the Korean and
Indo-Chinese wars when the West
showed itself prepared to resist
further advances.
Tactics have now been changed.
Russia has achieved a position
of industrial development where
it is now capable of extending
financial gifts and loans to un
derdeveloped countries. While
U.S. grants are made primarily
lo areas of strategic importance
and predominantly in the field
of military assistance, trusted
allies and neutrals feel slighted
by our distribution of aid since
we seem to overlook them in
favor of countries whose alleg
iance is questionable.
Russia has seen this flaw in
our program of economic assist
a nee and is eurently attempting
to attract these areas into its
trade orbit by gifts and loans.
Russia has the added incentive
of being considerably behind us
in its production of necessary
consumer and capital goods and
therefore is in need of trade with
these underdeveloped countries.
Our advanced economy, which
utilizes vast, stores of internal
resources, needs few props in the
form of foreign trade.
Kussiu bus, in tlx- past five
years, made great advances in
weaning traditional Western
trading areas into her sphere.
The Icelandic fishing industry
is now heavily supported by
Russian purchases Uruguayan
cattlemen are doing increasing
ly more business with the So
viet Union. The second stage
of Kgypt's Aswan Dam will he
financed with capital from Mos
cow after attempts to arrange
loans in the West failed.
The Communists' latest tri

umph occurred with Deputy Pre
mier Anastos Mikoyan's visit to
Cuba. The sugar from this island
has, in the past, been predomi
nantly bought by the United
States, but U.S.-Cuban relations
have deteriorated following Ihe
victory of Castro's revolution
against former dictator Batista.
It was announced this week
that the USSR would buy one
million tons of sugar per year,
this being one-fifth of
total annual crop. The Kremlin
would pay in credit funds to be
used for purchases in Russia.
The Communist leaders are
presently making inroads into
other areas of the world.
Khrushchev, traveling through
Southeast Asia, has made offers
of gifts and loans to several
nations, notably Burma. These
will undoubtedly he accepted.
Afghanistan is already a show
case of Soviet aid in this strate
gic region, while we in Laos
would appear to have failed
rather dismally. The violent crit
ics of American waste in Laos do
not seem particularly concerned
about correcting the situation but
rather suggest that our whole aid
program be discontinued.
While our Congress discusses
the fate of American economic
assistance, Red China has entered
the field, and Asian countries,
reluctant to accept aid from the
Soviet Union, are willing to be
assisted by their neighbor. Japan
and Indonesia are both increas
ing their trade with China due lo
lessened demand in the West.
Thus ill the face of the grim
ing economic competition be
tween Kast and West, America
should make basic changes in
its program of foreign aid. VVe
must help these countries, not
so much in the area of military
preparation, but rather in con
sumer production to alleviate
the distress of their people. The
tone of I lie Cold War has
changed; our policy must be
flexible enough to fit the new
situation.
