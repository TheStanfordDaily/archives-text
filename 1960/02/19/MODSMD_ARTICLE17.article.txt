# SOUTHEAST ASIA
## Discussion of Aid Policy Asked by Chinese Expert 
### Tom Glover 
The appearance on campus
Wednesday of Dr. Wang Kung
wu, distinguished Chinese scholar
from Malaya, caused a great deal
of controversy among students of
the Far Kast,
When Dr. Wang suggested that
ihe United States try to do very
little to help the underdeveloped
countries of Southeast Asia, he
| directly contradicted the tradi
tional American premise that aid
! is always advantageous in for
I eign affairs.
This rejection of foreign aid
in opposition to the increasing
demands for American economic
action in India, Malaya, Burma,
Vietnam and the other countries
of Southeast Asia, in order to
counter the threat of Communist
activities, comes as a surprisingly
realistic view of the situation.
Foreign Inlerfernee
The new nations of Southeast
, Asia are extremely sensitive to
what they consider "foreign in
terference," which includes direct
economic aid from the West.
Certainly no one can deny that
this area is underdeveloped, at
least by western standards of
| technology, and its ho u I d be
stressed that there are many
peoples there who want and need
! help.
The United Stales must recog
nize, however, that these peoples
are too proud to accept such un
j disguised offers as the U.S. has
made without some resentment.
Immediately this statement
| burns the face of the "we give
to underdeveloped countries and
gel nothing but criticism" group,
I who declare themselves martyrs
; to the cause of improvement for
underdeveloped countries.
Sensitive Taxpayer
Others of this group point to
the sensitive American taxpayer
| who might want more from the
objects of American generosity
than the recipient nation's atti
tude that the world owes it a liv
, ing Ihe "or else, Communism"
threats.
The fact remains Ihat the
peoples of this area, as in many
other areas louched by U.S. gen
erosity, are sensitive and resent
ful. and in this respect the prem
ise that aid of any form promotes
friendship and an understanding
of our system and ideals must
he carefully re examined.
The source of resentment
i toward our aid program stems
not from an aversion on the part
of Southeast Asians to money
but rather the indebtedness en
; gendered by constant reminders
of our benevolence.
The fact that U.S. aid made
possible improvements in rail
ways and roads last year in Ma
laya was quite adequately publi
cized by the Malayan press, for
example.
Indignation
Indignation, however, over a
clause in the contract stipulating
that every bridge should be brand
ed with a sign "Built by U.S. Aid"
lasted for months and caused a
definitely hostile attitude toward
| the entire program.
We do have a few clues as to
methods which might improve
this situation. Multilateral aid
and consultation h a s nearly
always proved equally effective
and far more popular in South
least Asia than insistence on the
part of each individual state that
it receive full credit for its par
ticipation in the economic build
up of an underdeveloped country.
Solutions to this problem in the
United States are easier to sug
gest than implement. Congress

traditionally re qui r e s strong
assurances of recognition before
allocating money for any purpose,
particularly foreign aid activities.
An effort should be made to
convince our government's legis
lature that the harm done to
American interests and reputa
tion by the U.S. aid identification
stamp could he greatly reduced
if recognition was left to foreign
nationals rather than American
propaganda.
The new countries of Southeast
Asia would be far less resentful
of foreign aid if they felt I hey
had some part in determining the
extent and use of funds.
Psychological Boost
The psychological boost to
these countries from the Russian
sign "Built as a result of Vietna
mese-Russian treaty agreements"
as compared to America's "Built
by U.S. Aid" is obvious.
Last month Averell Harriman
suggested a Marshall-type plan
for Southeast Asia which would
place allocated funds at the dis
posal of underdeveloped countries
upon request and declaration of
need.
Such a plan, through which the
countries themselves lake part in
determining the amount and use
of funds, rather than a system
in which all major decisions and
proposals are made by the United
States, could accomplish needed
improvements and minimize cries
of economic warware and inter
ference.
Wang appeared at Stanford not
only as a noteworthy scholar, but
as a loyal Malayan and a leader
of his people.
That the suggestion for less
direct aid from the United States
should come from him is a shock
ing indication that our policies
and premises in Southeast Asia
might well undergo a thorough
investigation.
