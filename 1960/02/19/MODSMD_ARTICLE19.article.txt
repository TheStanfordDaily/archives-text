### Richard Sundeen ASSU President 
During this week each living
I group will receive a two-page
memorandum explaining the var
j ious services rendered by the
; ASSLJ Student-Faculty Commis
I sion.
Included within ii are several
procedures by which s I ud en t
! groups may contact and obtain
: faculty members as speakers and
! for other academic or social func
j lions.
Many students have expressed
concern over student-alumni re
lations, and I am sine this infor
mation will be beneficial and
| helpful.
One of Ihe benefits of a uni
, versity of Stanford's calibre is
its fine faculty. An educational
■ experience, I fee], can he derived
, from association with great men
;as well as from scholarly en
deavor.
This term, student faculty re
lations, is usually expressed by
way of the criticism thai we, the
students, are never able to get i<>
know our faculty. And to a greal
extent this is true. Yet, can we
expect those faculty members
| interested in meeting with sin
I dents out of the class room to
invite themselves to the respec
tive living groups for the better
ment of relations?
In former days it was an un
written rule that faculty mem-
I hers would hold open house for
students on Sunday afternoons.
! With a student body of K9OO and
| with the numerous responsibili
ties besides research and lectures
j given to our faculty members
I such a plan is obviously imprac
tical. Still, many professors fre
quently entertain small groups of
•students in their homes.
My criticism of the student -
| faculty relations is that many
[students have failed to see the
need for student initiative in pro
I mulgating this relationship.
This was evidenced quite read
ily at a student-faculty reception
|I attended recently. The students
i sat on one side of the room and
professors on the other. Only one
j student had attempted to strike
up a conversation with these men,
I and as she got up to leave, one
of the faculty commented, "It
I looks as if we've lost her to the
j students."

This lack of Initiative is not
universal. Sigma Nu, Breakers,
Student-Faculty Commission and
other groups hav in g faculty
speakers and advisers have done
much in closing the gap.
It is evident that social inter
action cannot be forced, but they
must be made possible. The pos
sibility rests in the students' ini
tiative and forethought.

One of Ihe benefits of a uni

This term, student faculty re
lations, is usually expressed by
way of the criticism thai we, the
students, are never able to get i<>
know our faculty. And to a greal
extent this is true. Yet, can we
expect those faculty members

I dents out of the class room to
invite themselves to the respec
tive living groups for the better
ment of relations?
In former days it was an un
written rule that faculty mem-
I hers would hold open house for
students on Sunday afternoons.

I such a plan is obviously imprac
tical. Still, many professors fre
quently entertain small groups of
•students in their homes.
My criticism of the student -

[students have failed to see the
need for student initiative in pro
I mulgating this relationship.
This was evidenced quite read
ily at a student-faculty reception

i sat on one side of the room and
professors on the other. Only one

up a conversation with these men,
I and as she got up to leave, one
of the faculty commented, "It
