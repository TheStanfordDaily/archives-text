WASHINGTON </P) Secret,
urged the Soviet Union last night
join in a safeguarded disarmamen
war explodes through miscalculat
He expressed hope that Kreml

ary of State Christian A. Herter
to abandon "hollow slogans" and
ll plan before a disastrous nuclear
ion or blind folly.
lin leaders now realize "the arms
race offers unacceptable risks"
which he said threaten the sur
vival of Ihe U.S.S.R. as well as
Western nations.
Mistake Possible
"Miscalculations might, for ex
j ample, cause an international
' crisis to develop into a general
war without either side really in
tending that this should happen,"
the secretary said.
He added, with an eye to
France's success in exploding its
first atomic bomb last weekend:
"The more nations that have the
power to trigger off a nuclear
war the greater the chance that
some nation might use this power
in haste or blind folly."
U.S. Sincere
Herter spoke out in solemn lan
guage, without name-calling, in an
address devoted to the disarma
ment deadlock. Disarmament rep
resentatives of Britain, France, It
aly and Canada sat at a head ta
ble listening intently to his speech
at a National Press Club lunch
eon.
Herter's remarks appeared to
be a major effort to assure the
Soviet Union of U.S. sincerity in
seeking an East-West disarma
ment agreement including a first
step plan to ban further nuclear
weapons tests.
Ready to Settle
He pledged that if the Soviet
l Union negotiates seriously on this
problem, at talks beginning in Ge
neva March 13, it will find the
West, ready to make a reasonsable
settlement.
The •secretary in effect sought
to assure the Russians that the
West will not seek to hedge any
agreement with so many controls
, inspections that it will amount to
a giant syping operation behind
the Iron Curtain.
He put it in these words: "We
will gauge each possible agree
ment not by some abstract stand
ard of perfection but by one prac
tical yardstick: Would United
States and free world security be
greater — or less — under the
agreement than without arms
agreement?"
