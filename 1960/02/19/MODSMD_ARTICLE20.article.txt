The explosion in the Sahara
Desert, which showed that French
science and technology are as
good as anyone else's, is notice to
all of us that there is no monopoly
and not much mystery about nu
clear weapons. What Franco can
do today, China will be able to do
tomorrow, not to speak of Ger
many and Japan. This would not
necessarily mean the end of the
world. But it will certainly moan
that as the test explosions are
multiplied, the air will become
polluted, and the consequences to
future generations are horrible
to contemplate.
For fourteen months the
U.S.S.H., the U.K., and the
U.S.A. have been negotiating a
treaty designed to put an end
to test explosions. These negoti
ations have progressed inarvel
onsly, and they represent some
thing quite new and unexpected
in the relations between the So
viet Union and the Western
world.
To be sure the three of us who
now have nuclear weapons can
not impose our treaty, even if we
reach final agreement on the rest
of the world. But if wo are agreed
on a treaty, wo shall set an ox
ample, we shall create the ma
chinery, around which world opin
ion will surely rally. There is
little reason to doubt that France,
for example, if her rights are re
spected, would join in and con
tribute valuable help in making
the lest ban workable,.
Yet for the time being the
negotiations are stalled. The issue
arises out of experiments con
ducted by the Atomic Energy
Commission in a salt mine in
Louisiana. These experiments
shower I our experts that relative
ly small underground explosions
cannot be detected by the existing
instruments. They cannot surely
be distinguished from earth
quakes. Our difference with the
Soviet Union is over the si/.e of
the underground e x p 1 os i on s
which can he tested. Our experts
say that: the underground ex
plosion can be nine times as big,
and still go undetected as the So
viet's experts say it can be.
The Administration has taken
the position that we will not
agree to abandon underground
explosions if our experts say
they are too small to be de
lected. We propose, therefore,
to authorize such small nuclear
testing. As it happens, these
authorized explosions would be
just the ones which the Atomic
Uuei'ny Commission and the
I'entagon regard as desirable in
order to perfect a number of
weapons they are working on.
The Soviet position, on the other
hand, is that all tests must be
banned, even those which can
not be delected.
The abstract logic of our posi
tion ban only what can surely
be detected is perfect in itself.
But there is very good reason to
think that it is unrealistic and
that if we hold to it inflexibly,
refusing to work out any one of
the many compromises which are
quite conceivable, it will prove to
bo quite an unwise position. For
it is based on the assumption that

no treaty is better than an imper
fect treaty.
I think this assumption is mis
calculated. The miscalculation is
a failure to realize the signifi
cance of the concessions which
have been made by the Soviet
Union in agreeing to an elaborate
worldwide inspection system, of
which a large number of stations,
manned by foreigners, would be
on Soviet territory. In the per
spective of Russian, not to speak
of Communist, suspicion and dis
like' of foreigners, the Soviet con
sessions promise a political break
through of historic significance.
Our policy-makers have not,
it seems to me, taken into ac
count the lull consequence of
the Soviet concessions. It is that
the Soviet Union is by way of
convincing most of the world
outside ibis country that il is
sincere about ending nuclear
testing. We have been told by
experts of the Atomic Fnergy
Commission no! to worry about
fallout. ISut mankind is lerri
-1 ied by it, and the Soviet Union
is buying world support by
agreeing to he inspected by
foreigners in order to end ihe
testing.
The President and his advisors
should bear this in mind when
they talk about resuming our own
testing. The President has said
that "we consider ourselves free
to resume nuclear testing" but
that we shall not resume it with
out announcing our intention to
do so.
What does the President think
would happen it he did announce
such an intention? There would
be an uproar around the world.
Quite competent and cool observ
ers believe that the uproar would
bring about a special meeting of
the General Assembly of the
United Nations to protest against
our action, and that if the ques
tion wore put to a vote, we should
be lucky to get ton votes out of
eighty.
In any event the danger to our
influence and our prestige would
be enormous.
Moreover, and this is the
point that the Administration
should not overlook, if ihe
treaty fails because it is not
totally perfeel, Ihe Soviet Union
will have won a sweeping diplo
matic victory. The Soviet Union
will not have to admit foreign
ers to carry out inspection on
her territory. At the same time
the United Slates will not really
be free to continue testing. For
the more we test, the more wo
shall be denounced and opposed
as having failed to show a de
cent respect for the opinion of
mankind.
When those negotiations start
ed, the Russians wanted to ban
testing without any inspection. If
we hold inflexibly to our present
position, there is likely to be no
treaty, and the Russians will get
for nothing most of what thov
wanted in the first place. They
will have no inspection and they
will have made it almost impossi
ble for us to do much testing,

no treaty is better than an imper

I think this assumption is mis
calculated. The miscalculation is
a failure to realize the signifi
cance of the concessions which
have been made by the Soviet
Union in agreeing to an elaborate
worldwide inspection system, of
which a large number of stations,
manned by foreigners, would be
on Soviet territory. In the per
spective of Russian, not to speak
of Communist, suspicion and dis
like' of foreigners, the Soviet con
sessions promise a political break
through of historic significance.
Our policy-makers have not,
it seems to me, taken into ac
count the lull consequence of
the Soviet concessions. It is that
the Soviet Union is by way of
convincing most of the world
outside ibis country that il is
sincere about ending nuclear
testing. We have been told by
experts of the Atomic Fnergy
Commission no! to worry about
fallout. ISut mankind is lerri
-1 ied by it, and the Soviet Union
is buying world support by
agreeing to he inspected by
foreigners in order to end ihe
testing.
The President and his advisors
should bear this in mind when
they talk about resuming our own
testing. The President has said
that "we consider ourselves free
to resume nuclear testing" but
that we shall not resume it with
out announcing our intention to
do so.
What does the President think
would happen it he did announce
such an intention? There would
be an uproar around the world.
Quite competent and cool observ
ers believe that the uproar would
bring about a special meeting of
the General Assembly of the
United Nations to protest against
our action, and that if the ques
tion wore put to a vote, we should
be lucky to get ton votes out of
eighty.
In any event the danger to our
influence and our prestige would
be enormous.
Moreover, and this is the
point that the Administration
should not overlook, if ihe
treaty fails because it is not
totally perfeel, Ihe Soviet Union
will have won a sweeping diplo
matic victory. The Soviet Union
will not have to admit foreign
ers to carry out inspection on
her territory. At the same time
the United Slates will not really
be free to continue testing. For
the more we test, the more wo
shall be denounced and opposed
as having failed to show a de
cent respect for the opinion of
mankind.
When those negotiations start
ed, the Russians wanted to ban
testing without any inspection. If
we hold inflexibly to our present
position, there is likely to be no
treaty, and the Russians will get

The explosion in the Sahara
Desert, which showed that French
science and technology are as
good as anyone else's, is notice to
all of us that there is no monopoly
and not much mystery about nu
clear weapons. What Franco can
do today, China will be able to do
tomorrow, not to speak of Ger
many and Japan. This would not
necessarily mean the end of the
world. But it will certainly moan
that as the test explosions are
multiplied, the air will become
polluted, and the consequences to
future generations are horrible
to contemplate.
For fourteen months the
U.S.S.H., the U.K., and the
U.S.A. have been negotiating a
treaty designed to put an end
to test explosions. These negoti
ations have progressed inarvel
onsly, and they represent some
thing quite new and unexpected
in the relations between the So
viet Union and the Western
world.
To be sure the three of us who
now have nuclear weapons can
not impose our treaty, even if we
reach final agreement on the rest
of the world. But if wo are agreed
on a treaty, wo shall set an ox
ample, we shall create the ma
chinery, around which world opin
ion will surely rally. There is
little reason to doubt that France,
for example, if her rights are re
spected, would join in and con
tribute valuable help in making
the lest ban workable,.
Yet for the time being the
negotiations are stalled. The issue
arises out of experiments con
ducted by the Atomic Energy
Commission in a salt mine in
Louisiana. These experiments
shower I our experts that relative

cannot be detected by the existing
instruments. They cannot surely
be distinguished from earth
quakes. Our difference with the
Soviet Union is over the si/.e of
the underground e x p 1 os i on s
which can he tested. Our experts
say that: the underground ex
plosion can be nine times as big,
and still go undetected as the So
viet's experts say it can be.
The Administration has taken
the position that we will not
agree to abandon underground
explosions if our experts say
they are too small to be de
lected. We propose, therefore,
to authorize such small nuclear
testing. As it happens, these
authorized explosions would be
just the ones which the Atomic
Uuei'ny Commission and the
I'entagon regard as desirable in
order to perfect a number of
weapons they are working on.
The Soviet position, on the other
hand, is that all tests must be
banned, even those which can
not be delected.
The abstract logic of our posi
tion ban only what can surely
be detected is perfect in itself.
But there is very good reason to
think that it is unrealistic and
that if we hold to it inflexibly,
refusing to work out any one of
the many compromises which are
quite conceivable, it will prove to
bo quite an unwise position. For

and not much mystery about nu
clear weapons. What Franco can
do today, China will be able to do
tomorrow, not to speak of Ger
many and Japan. This would not
necessarily mean the end of the
world. But it will certainly moan
that as the test explosions are
multiplied, the air will become
polluted, and the consequences to
future generations are horrible
to contemplate.
For fourteen months the
U.S.S.H., the U.K., and the
U.S.A. have been negotiating a
treaty designed to put an end
to test explosions. These negoti
ations have progressed inarvel
onsly, and they represent some
thing quite new and unexpected
in the relations between the So
viet Union and the Western
world.
To be sure the three of us who
now have nuclear weapons can
not impose our treaty, even if we
reach final agreement on the rest
of the world. But if wo are agreed
on a treaty, wo shall set an ox
ample, we shall create the ma
chinery, around which world opin
ion will surely rally. There is
little reason to doubt that France,
for example, if her rights are re
spected, would join in and con
tribute valuable help in making
the lest ban workable,.
Yet for the time being the
negotiations are stalled. The issue
arises out of experiments con
ducted by the Atomic Energy
Commission in a salt mine in
Louisiana. These experiments
shower I our experts that relative
ly small underground explosions
cannot be detected by the existing
instruments. They cannot surely
be distinguished from earth
quakes. Our difference with the
Soviet Union is over the si/.e of
the underground e x p 1 os i on s
which can he tested. Our experts
say that: the underground ex
plosion can be nine times as big,
and still go undetected as the So
viet's experts say it can be.
The Administration has taken
the position that we will not
agree to abandon underground
explosions if our experts say
they are too small to be de
lected. We propose, therefore,
to authorize such small nuclear
testing. As it happens, these
authorized explosions would be
just the ones which the Atomic
Uuei'ny Commission and the
I'entagon regard as desirable in
order to perfect a number of
weapons they are working on.
The Soviet position, on the other
hand, is that all tests must be
banned, even those which can
not be delected.
The abstract logic of our posi
tion ban only what can surely
be detected is perfect in itself.
But there is very good reason to
think that it is unrealistic and
that if we hold to it inflexibly,
refusing to work out any one of
the many compromises which are
quite conceivable, it will prove to
bo quite an unwise position. For
it is based on the assumption that

no treaty is better than an imper
fect treaty.
I think this assumption is mis
calculated. The miscalculation is
a failure to realize the signifi
cance of the concessions which
have been made by the Soviet
Union in agreeing to an elaborate
worldwide inspection system, of
which a large number of stations,
manned by foreigners, would be
on Soviet territory. In the per
spective of Russian, not to speak
of Communist, suspicion and dis
like' of foreigners, the Soviet con
sessions promise a political break
through of historic significance.
Our policy-makers have not,
it seems to me, taken into ac
count the lull consequence of
the Soviet concessions. It is that
the Soviet Union is by way of
convincing most of the world
outside ibis country that il is
sincere about ending nuclear
testing. We have been told by
experts of the Atomic Fnergy
Commission no! to worry about
fallout. ISut mankind is lerri
-1 ied by it, and the Soviet Union
is buying world support by
agreeing to he inspected by
foreigners in order to end ihe
testing.
The President and his advisors
should bear this in mind when
they talk about resuming our own
testing. The President has said
that "we consider ourselves free
to resume nuclear testing" but
that we shall not resume it with
out announcing our intention to
do so.
What does the President think
would happen it he did announce
such an intention? There would
be an uproar around the world.
Quite competent and cool observ
ers believe that the uproar would
bring about a special meeting of
the General Assembly of the
United Nations to protest against
our action, and that if the ques
tion wore put to a vote, we should
be lucky to get ton votes out of
eighty.
In any event the danger to our
influence and our prestige would
be enormous.
Moreover, and this is the
point that the Administration
should not overlook, if ihe
treaty fails because it is not
totally perfeel, Ihe Soviet Union
will have won a sweeping diplo
matic victory. The Soviet Union
will not have to admit foreign
ers to carry out inspection on
her territory. At the same time
the United Slates will not really
be free to continue testing. For
the more we test, the more wo
shall be denounced and opposed
as having failed to show a de
cent respect for the opinion of
mankind.
When those negotiations start

testing without any inspection. If
we hold inflexibly to our present

cance of the concessions which
have been made by the Soviet
Union in agreeing to an elaborate
worldwide inspection system, of
which a large number of stations,
manned by foreigners, would be
on Soviet territory. In the per
spective of Russian, not to speak
of Communist, suspicion and dis
like' of foreigners, the Soviet con
sessions promise a political break
through of historic significance.
Our policy-makers have not,
it seems to me, taken into ac
count the lull consequence of
the Soviet concessions. It is that
the Soviet Union is by way of
convincing most of the world
outside ibis country that il is
sincere about ending nuclear
testing. We have been told by
experts of the Atomic Fnergy
Commission no! to worry about
fallout. ISut mankind is lerri
-1 ied by it, and the Soviet Union
is buying world support by
agreeing to he inspected by
foreigners in order to end ihe
testing.
The President and his advisors
should bear this in mind when
they talk about resuming our own
testing. The President has said
that "we consider ourselves free
to resume nuclear testing" but
that we shall not resume it with
out announcing our intention to
do so.
What does the President think
would happen it he did announce
such an intention? There would
be an uproar around the world.
Quite competent and cool observ
ers believe that the uproar would
bring about a special meeting of
the General Assembly of the
United Nations to protest against
our action, and that if the ques
tion wore put to a vote, we should
be lucky to get ton votes out of
eighty.
In any event the danger to our
influence and our prestige would
be enormous.
Moreover, and this is the
point that the Administration
should not overlook, if ihe
treaty fails because it is not
totally perfeel, Ihe Soviet Union
will have won a sweeping diplo
matic victory. The Soviet Union
will not have to admit foreign
ers to carry out inspection on
her territory. At the same time
the United Slates will not really
be free to continue testing. For
the more we test, the more wo
shall be denounced and opposed
as having failed to show a de
cent respect for the opinion of
mankind.
When those negotiations start
ed, the Russians wanted to ban
testing without any inspection. If
we hold inflexibly to our present
position, there is likely to be no
treaty, and the Russians will get
for nothing most of what thov
wanted in the first place. They
will have no inspection and they
will have made it almost impossi
ble for us to do much testing,
