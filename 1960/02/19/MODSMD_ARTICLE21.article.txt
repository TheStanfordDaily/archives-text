# Professor Sees Kafka's Theme as 'Challenge Interrupting Human Life'

Professor Loo Weinstein pre
sented his interpretation of a
short story by Franz Kafka to
1110 Philological Society in its
monthly meeting yesterday.
Simultaneously, he outlined the
various problems inherent in ana
lyzing the works of the late Ger
man writer whom some include
within the existentionalism move
ment.
Having read Kafka's "Report
to An Academy," a short story

in which the narrator is an ape,
Weinsten suggested that a great
er understanding of the author's
multi-value symbols and complex
viewpoint may be gained if the
reader studies the themes which
recur in his works.
However, one may see Kafka's
fiction from two points of view:
the religious, in which he is the
God seeker, a Jew searching for
Christian grace; or the psycho
logical, in which tin* writer's tech
niques are related to his frus
trated life.
