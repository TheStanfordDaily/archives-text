Black Armbands
Fdilor, The Daily:
We four students will bo wear
ing black arm bands today if
Chessman is executed and on the
occasion ot' all future executions
in the San Quentin gas chamber.
In this we will be joined by stu
dents at various other California
universities and colleges, united
only by opposition to capital pun
ishment.
We believe that the official kill
ing of criminals, for whatever
crime, is out-dated, unnecessary
and brutal, that is more a form
of social vengeance than of social
protection. We believe that the
execution of criminals should be
abolished because it serves no
useful purpose; it is not a proven
deterrent to crime and it protects
society no better than does im
prisonment.
We know that not everyone
who opposes capital punishment
will join us by wearing an arm
band. However, we feel that we
must publicly express some evi
dence of our convictions. Quiet
and guarded objection to legal
execution will neither change the
law nor stop Ihe killing. There
fore it is our intention as par
ticipants in 'this demonstration
to make our fellow students, as
well as the state legislators,
aware of our attitude.
Wo mourn the death of the
criminal as well as the part we
played (as citizens of California)
in his execution. The wearing of
the.armbands is a sign of mourn
ing tor this needless and yet de
liberate killing.
It is a sign that we oppose
the action of this state and will
continue to oppose it until the
execution of convicts is outlawed
by the California Legislature.

Bowling Alieys
Hdilor, The Daily:
For some time now, wo have
heard people objecting to the
bowling alleys in the new Union.
Wo think bowling alleys are a
good thing for a student union.
They have been operated success
fully at many other schools (e.g.
the U. ef Colorado and Arizona
State U.).
It was said that El Camino
Bowl can h a n d I o the bowling
needs of the students. It is sur
prising how few people are ener
getic enough to pedal a bicycle
six miles and back to roll a few
linos.
It was also pointed out that
bowling would be expensive to
maintain. From experience with
University fiscal policies, we ex
pect to be charged enough per
game to cover the entire Union's
expenses.
Of course, there is the serious

objection that bowling alleys
would contribute nothing intellec
tual to the union and would not
cater to the needs of the mind.
We too would like to see the
Union composed entirely of little
soundproof cubicles where stu
dents could go and celebrate, with
perhaps the addition of a music
listening room stocked entirely
with Bach fugues.
But since ping-pong, pool and
card tables have been incorporat
ed already, introducing a sensual
element, it wouldn't hurt too
much more to have b owli n g
alleys. Of course, a completely
intellectual union at completely
intellectual Stanford is a nice
thought. . . .

Tresidder Union
Editor, The Daily:
After reading Mr. Sugarman's
letter (Feb. 18> regarding the new
Union, one gets the implication
that the planning which has been
done for the proposed Tresidder
Union has been done by a few
individuals who are out of touch
with the needs and desires of the
Stanford community, and who
are disregarding the so-called
uniqueness of the Stanford com
munity.
This is not so. For the past
quarter and a half, the ASSU Ad
Hoc Committee on the Tresidder
Memorial Union has been in
volved in getting student opinion
on what facilities and programs
are desired in a campus center.
Approximately 100 people on the
co m mitt ee interviewed about
2,000 Stanford students as to what
they, as the the Stanford com
munity, wanted in a Union.
From these interviews an Ad
Hoc Committee report was writ
ten. All aspects of this report
regarding facilities and program
ming were discussed by the com
mittee. The preliminary building
program was based on the Ad
Hoc Committee Report, and was
subsequently approved by both
the Ad Hoc Committee and the
Stanford Union Committee, which
consists of both ASSU leaders
and members of the faculty and
administration.
In conclusion, then, tl*e plans
which have been proposed, and
which are still undergoing careful
examination, have been put forth
by those who know Stanford, and
who are Stanford. Mr. Berry did
not bring a building program for
the new Union and when he came
it was prepared with him by
the Stanford community after his
arrival.
To give Mr. Sugarman, as well

as other students who feel that
we have been working on the
plans ol" the new Union without
re fere nee to the Stanford eommu
nity, an op p o rt un i t y to gain
broader insight into the philoso
phy of the new Tresidder Union,
I refer him to the Nov. 12 and
February issues of the Stanford
Daily, both of which have given
proper explanation to both our
philosophy and our p 1 a n n in g
approach.

Committee on the
