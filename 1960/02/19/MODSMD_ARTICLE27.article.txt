# Card Swimmers Ready For Improved Spartans
## 
### Rick Walker 
Stanford's swimmers, having
sufficiently recovered from the
64-34 trouncing they received
from SO last weekend, pack their
bags and take off for San Jose
this afternoon for their meet with
the Spartans, beginning at 3:30
The Indians swam all over the
happless San Jose team, 62-23,
last year, but with the addition of
new Spartan talent it is doubtful
that they will have such an easy
time today.
.Macedo Sparks
Leading San Jose this after
noon wil he Tom Macedo, a back
stroke transfer who placed fourth
in the AAU finals last year with
a 58.1 for the 100. This time tops
anything the Indians have put
forth this year.
Stanford should again be strong
in the breaststroke with Tom
Peterson and Jim Cooper, and in
the 440 and George Harrison,
who can be expected to try for
another pool record in that event.
Meanwhile Stanford's middle
distance men, Mike Zeller. John
Jurgensen and Don Parsons will
have plenty of competition in
Ross Berry, a local free-style whiz
who showed up very well last
year as a member of the frosh
squad.
Indians Romp
San Jose is expected to provide
little competition in butterfly,
which means Indian's Tim Tim
ken and Jim Lewis should enjoy
a romp in thai department.
The meet this afternoon will
also give some of the spohomores
a chance to show their stuff and
gain'experience. Besides Parsons
and Lewis, backstroker-free-styl
er Ralph Oilman will bear watch
ing.
Oilman took a first in the back
stroke at UCLA. Tom Darrah,
also a free-styler has shown prom
ise in practice, and took third in
the 50 at UCLA.
