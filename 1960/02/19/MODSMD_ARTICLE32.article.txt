# Stanford to Face UCLA
## Indians Given Third Chance Against Bruins 
### Ken Dery 
Needing a revenge victory
almost as badly as (hey want it,
Stanford's In d i a n s meet the
Bruins of UCLA tonight in a
most important basketball game.
Two of the Tribe's remaining
four games are with national
champion California, and to hold
on to third place in the league
standings Stanford must beat
hack the charge <>112 IJSC. The In
dian record is presently I 3 while
tISC holds a 3-6 mark.
Cheery Side
On the cheerier side of the
ledger, Coach Dallmar's boys
have an outside chance to edge
UCLA for second place honors.
With a record of 5-2, the Bruins
can still be caught.
Although twice beaten by the
Southlandei s, no one is 100 quick
to pr e diet thai third decision
against the Cards. A proud group,
I hey have been improving stead
ily over the course of the season
and the offense has really started
to jell.
Brockiueyer Heady
Read to go after the finest
basketball weekend of his career
is center Neal nrockmeyer. The
fj'S" senioi popped in 22 and 11
points in the last two games to
more than fulfill ;ill hopes that
Coach Dallmar had for him.
Neal's development this season
both in rebounding and Scoring
has greatly helped to make the,
offense go. When teams are not
quick to collapse on the center
zone, a much greater variety of
plays can be run.
Bowling Cool
Junior guard Bub Bowling has
continued his fine floor leader
ship and is a cool customer when
it counts. No Paul Neumann in 1
the shooting department, Bub can
pass and defend with the best of,
them. Those fast hands are to be
respected as many a hotshot drib
bler has found out.
Emerging as the second high
scorer on the squad, John Wind-!

sor scorns lo gain more confi
dence with each game. Always
capable of getting his points, "the
Duke" has learned a great deal
about the other facets of a win
ning team and is usually up there
in the important rebounding de
partment.
Arrillaga a Native
Captain John Arrillaga should
also be up for ibis game for he
is from the Los Angeles area.
The leading scorer all year, one
can give nothing but praise for
the guard's fine all-around play
this season.
Jumping John Hendry will, as

usual, handle his forward slot
and you never can tell when he
will come up with one of his
"scoring games." Primarily a re
bounder and steady scorer, he has
been known to erupt on occasion
as evidenced by the feat of
dropping in 12 points in a single
overtime period against USC.
Miller Adds Punch
The return of 6-6 Kent Miller
to I he UCLA squad gives the
added punch that was lost when
the forward sprained his ankle.
His two supporting guards, Bill
Ellis and John Green, are better
than-average players who each

chip in with about nine points
per game.
They are second only to center
John Berberieh in the scoring
derby, and the duel between
Brockmeyer and Berberieh should
be a fine one.
Gary Cunningham and Pete
Blackmail have been the stalling
forwards rounding out a well
balanced unit, and the Indians
will have 1o be at their best to
come out on top.
Coach John Wooden has a
â€¢strong bench headed by guard
Cliff Brandon. This 5-8 senior
proved his value last week when
lie sparked UCLA to a win over
the Indians.
