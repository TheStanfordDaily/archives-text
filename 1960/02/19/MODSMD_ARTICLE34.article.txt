# MEET OLYMPIC CLUB
## Cards Open Slate 
### 
The Olympic Club of San Fran
cisco will throw a group of old
v e t e r a n sand one teenager in
against the Stanford tennis team
when the Indian netters open
their season tomorrow morning
at 9:30 at the Olympic Club courts
in San Francisco.
The veteran members ol the
Olympic Club team include Tom
Brown, Rill Crosby, Marry Likas,
Seth Peterson, and one time Stan
lord netter. Brooks Rawlins. The
one teenager is promising Hi
year-old Robby Siska.
Old Hut Good
Rrown, at 36, is still one ol the
top tennis players in the United
States, and will provide Dick
Ogden, Stanford's No. 1 singles
player, with perhaps his strong
est opposition of the season.
Resides Ogden, Stanford will
send Jim Jeffries, Dick Could.
Norm 1 Cains, Dick Mosk, George
Bates and Gil Ranney to San
Francisco to compete in the dual
match.
Jeffries Heady
Jeffries will be paired off
against Rill Crosby in the No. 2
singles spot. The towering red
head from Stanford proved his
talent against the older set last
weekend when he beat aging but
efficient Norm Brocks of the On I
Club in an exhibition match.
Gould will play Harry Likas

in the third singles spot, Karns
will face P e t ers on in fourth
singles, and either Mosk, Ranney
or Bates will face Siska at fifth
singles and Rawlins at sixth.
Stanford Coach Rob Renker,
who's never had a losing season
at Stanford, feels his team will
be opening their season with what
could be ihe toughest of this
year's opponents.
Olympic Club Strom*
A good indication of the over
all strength of the Olympic Club
is evident when one notes that
young Siska, playing fifth for the
Olympic Club, defeated Stanford's
first man, Ogden, last week in an
exhibition match, and came very
close to upsetting Rod haver, Aus
tralia's N'o. 2 player, in last year's
National Singles Championships.
He lost in a deuce fourth set.
Stanford's doubles combina
tions for Saturday will pair Jef
fries and Ogden, probably Gould
and Karns, and Bales and cither
Ranney or Mosk.
