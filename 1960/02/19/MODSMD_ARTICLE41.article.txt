# Nikita Talks to Indonesia Leader
## 
### 
JAKARTA Indonesia (/P) â€” So
viet Premier Nikita S. Khru
shchev voiced a cryptic threat to
Indonesians last night at a ban
quet capping his red-carpet wel
come to this neutralist nation.
"There are differences of opin
ion between us and President
Sukarno," he said as his national
ist-minded host sat beside him.
"If you press me. these differ
ences may grow wider."
The remark was unexplained
and may have been intended as
a joke.
Looking healthy and rested at
last on this third leg of his South
Asian tour, Khrushchev dropped
the remark in a speech in the
white and gray banquet room of
Sukarno's Merdeka F reedo m
Palace.
One of the differences is the
fact that "I'm being offered too
much food, and it is continually
being pressed upon mo." ho added.
Khrushchev also -said that so
far as he knew, there were no
basic political conflicts between
the two countries.
