SACRAMENTO (/P) — Caryl
Chessman attorney's assertions
of his innocence were carried to
Governor Brown lale last night,
only a few hours before Chess
man's scheduled execution.
The appeal was carried to Sac
ramento by attorney Miss Ash
er alter she had conferred with
Chessman at San Quentin. She
said it was the first time Chess
man has asked for any kind of
clemency, as he always has main
tained he is innocent of the
charges on which he was convict
ed in 1948 after a "Red Light Ban
dit" terrorized Los Angeles lovers
lanes and forced two women into
unnatural sex acts.
After conferring with Brown's
extradition and clemency secre
tary, Cecil Poole, and his Press
Secretary Hale Champion for
more than two hours, Miss Asher
said flatly the letter contained in
formation sufficient to indicate
Chessman's innocence. She said
Chessman has told her who the
Red Light bandit really was, but
that he has bound her to secrecy.
Champion said at the conclu
sion of the conference:
"We've talked to her. She pre
sents a number of things -mat
ters of fact or assertions as the
case may be — which can be pre
sented to the governor by Mr.
Poole.
Champion added:
"I know of nothing further to
night."
Champion declined to divulge
the information given by Miss
Asher, saying, "It was presented
on a basis of confidentiality."
A no I h e r Chessman attorney,
George T. Davis of San Francisco,
said after conferring with Chess
man later tonight Chessman is
telling the governor that the Red
Light Bandit was two men. not
one. He too refused to divulge any
further contents of the letter.


CARYL C HESSMAN
Is this the end of the long battle?
lie mentioned the 1 to 3 vote by
which tiie court twice has refused
to recommend a commutation of
sentence for Chessman to the
governor.
"That pretty well precludes
further activity of the court," Da
vis said during his debate over
the education TV station KQED
with Assemblyman Charles Con
rad (R-Los Angeles).
Chessman's only hope to escape
the death chamber today is Gov
ernor Brown and any further ap
peal to the State Supreme Court
is out, his chief attorney said last
night in debating the case on tele
vision here.
Davis and Conrad, 112 or m e r
speaker pro-tem of the Assembly
and an assemblyman for 1 1 years,
appeared on a program called
"Profile of the Bay Area . . . The
12th Hour" with the moderator
being Caspar Weinberger, form
er member of the State Assembly,
father of the Alcoholic Beverage
Control act', and defeated candi
date for attorney general last
election.
George T. Davis apparently re
versed his earlier decision to ask
a slay of execution this morning
from the three minority judges
who wanted to commute Chess

man's death penalty to life im
prisonment.
"112 don't think a further appeal
to the State Supreme Court is
practical. 1 don't think I should
impose further on the court.
"The place we must go is to
the governor. Rosalie Asher is in
Sacramento now seeking the gov
ernor's secretary.
"As i see it, the governor can
grant a reprieve. He is the only
one who has the absolute power."
Brown has taken the position
that as long as he hasn't Die pow
er to grant a commutation or a
pardon to a man previous con
victed of a felony without su
preme court sanction, he must
have that sanction to grant a
reprieve.
Mi s s Ash e r said she had
planned to confer with Chessman
last night, but was unable to
reach San Quentin before the
gates were closed to visitors at
midnight.
She said flatly that Governor
Brown would be presented suffi
cient information to indicate
Chessman's innocence.
No one but official witnesses
to the execution \s ill be able to
see the condemned man from now
on.

unnatural sex acts.
After conferring with Brown's
extradition and clemency secre

Secretary Hale Champion for
more than two hours, Miss Asher
said flatly the letter contained in
formation sufficient to indicate
Chessman's innocence. She said
Chessman has told her who the

SACRAMENTO (/P) — Caryl
Chessman attorney's assertions
of his innocence were carried to

only a few hours before Chess
man's scheduled execution.
The appeal was carried to Sac

Chessman at San Quentin. She
said it was the first time Chess
man has asked for any kind of
clemency, as he always has main
tained he is innocent of the
charges on which he was convict
ed in 1948 after a "Red Light Ban
dit" terrorized Los Angeles lovers
lanes and forced two women into
unnatural sex acts.
After conferring with Brown's
extradition and clemency secre

Secretary Hale Champion for
more than two hours, Miss Asher
said flatly the letter contained in
formation sufficient to indicate
Chessman's innocence. She said
Chessman has told her who the
Red Light bandit really was, but
that he has bound her to secrecy.
Champion said at the conclu

"We've talked to her. She pre
sents a number of things -mat

case may be — which can be pre
sented to the governor by Mr.
Poole.
Champion added:
"I know of nothing further to
