The Stanford players' presentation of "The Dybbuk," a drama
by Sholem Ansky based on medieval Jewish folklore and supersti
tion. will open on Wednesday.
"The Dybbuk" is ttie story of a girl whose father promised be
fore she was born, that she would marry Channon, a student of

Jewish mysticism. When this I
promise is broken the girl must
struggle to escape the "dybbuk," I
or evil spirit, of her predestined
bridegroom.
The program note calls the
theme of the play the "inner |
1 psychological torment of a soul,
obsessed and a soul possessed."
j The director, Raoul Peizar, sairl,
that it was the "universal appli-j
I cation" of the theme of possession ■
by a spirit that first drew him to
i the play.
Peizar. who is a graduate stu
dent in Spech and Drama, also'
i said that the play has "a possi
bility of being very exciting." He |
j mentioned especially the lighting,
I which is done by Paul Landry,
and the set design, which is done
j by James Lyon.
"The Dybbuk" was first pre
sented in Russia at the? turn of!
j the century. Recently Paddy !
Chayefsky used the framework of
the play for "The Tenth Man,"'
which has been presented on
Broadway. While the stress of
"The Dubbuk" is on mysticism,
the emphasis of "The Tenth Man"
is on the contemporary psyehol
analytic aspects of the theme.
