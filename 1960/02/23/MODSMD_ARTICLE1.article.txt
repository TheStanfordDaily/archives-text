# Trustees Grant Approval For New Accelerator Site
## 
### Marilyn Moore 
The new Sand Hill location for Project M has been approved by the Board of Trustees., But a linear
accelerator for Stanford was not listed on the budget submitted Feb. 19 to the Subcommittee on Leg
islation of the Senate-House Atomic Energy Committee.
The Board's action came last Thursday as a result of discouraging reports from geologists on the
previously favored area west of Junipero Serra Blvd. The new site is parallel to Sand llill Road about

one-half mile south, extending
from a point near the Santa Clara
County line to a point near Sears
ville Lake. The end station loca
tion has not yet been determined.
The new location must still un
dergo extensive engineering
studies, according to Robert H.
Moullon, assistant to the presi
dent. and for that reason two
other locations are still being con
sidered.
Not on Budget
Meanwhile, in Washington,
D.C., the $171,256,000 request for
the fiscal year beginning July 1
to be studied by the Legislative
Subcommittee did not mention
the linear accelerator.
Rep. Chet Holifield (D-Calif. >,
chairman of the subcommittee,
said in an interview Friday that
this does not definitely mean that
the accelerator has been removed
from consideration. But he did
say that the Administration's con
cern for a balanced budget, com
bined with this being an election
year, made prospects for Project
M discouraging.
"Lots of things come before a
linear accelerator," he said.
Lacks Priority
Among the 45 projects on the
recommendation report are mili
tary reactors ($36 million), civil
ian reactors ($37 million), special
nuclear materials ($2O million),
and civilian projects ($715,000).
After members of the Legisla
tive Subcommittee have studied
the report, investigation of each
item will be made followed by
hearings. The subcommittee will
determine priority and submit the
list to the Joint Committee on
Atomic Energy. The subcommit
tee's recommendations are usual
ly accepted as presented, Rep.
Holifield noted.
The commission must decide
whether it wants to spend a large
amount of money on high energy
research, represented by Stan
ford's proposal to build the linear
accelerator for study of the make
up of the atom.
Submission of the Joint Com
mittee's report to Congress should
take place at least 60 days before
the July 1 adjournment goal. It
will be referred to the Appropria
tions Committee, which may add
or subtract items. Last year $125
million was requested and $165
million allotted. It is doubtful,
however, that the amount would
be increased or the linear acceler
ator added this year, Rep. Holi
field indicated.
Further Possibility
A further possibility for the
current status of Project M re
mains, although also remote. This
would be if the subcommittee pro
posing the budget regards the
linear accelerator for Stanford as
an unfinished item on last year's
list and thus considers it unnec
essary to propose it again.
