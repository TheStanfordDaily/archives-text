# Chessman Given New Hope to Live
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (/P) — The
chief attorney for Caryl Chess
man said yesterday the convict's
12-year fight on Death Row
against execution now can be ex
tended through at least 30 court
judges by virtue of the governor's
tenth-hour reprieve last Friday.
"That means there are 30
chances in this game for Chess
man's life and those are better
odds than playing rou 1e t t e,"
asserted the attorney, George T.
Davis.
Davis charted his next move
while controversies swirled over
what part the U.S. State Depart
ment played in the reprieve and
just when Chessman's next death
date could be set.
State Department
In Washington, Sen. Strom
Thurmond (D-SC) told the Sen
ate that Roy R. Rubottom Jr., as
sistant secretary of state, should
be "severly condemned" for the
telegram sent Gov. Brown. It
•stated the execution might stir up
ant i - American demonst art ions
during President Eisenhower's
Latin American visit. Brown said
the telegram weighed strongly in
his decision to reprieve Chessman
for 60 days.
Sen. Thurmond's criticism of
the State Department in Wash
ington followed by a few hours
another by Sen. Barry Goldwater
R-Ariz.
"It is repugnant to me to see
our State Department so weak
kneed," Goldwater said.
Political Motive
Another senator, Theodore
Francis Green (D-RI) said in a
telegram to a constituent that the
State Department action "appears
to have subtle political motiva
tions."
But Green, former chairman of
the Senate Fore i g n Relations
Committee, said Brown's reprieve
in the light of the Rubottom tele
gram was defensible. Green said
Brown would have subjected him
self to severe criticism had the
execution been carried out and
anti-American demonstrations did
break out against President
Eisenhower.
Davis said the circumstances
surrounding the reprieve—Chess-
man already in a room next to
the gas chamber, with the execu
tion less than 10 hours away—
constituted "cruel and unusual
punishment."
Will Return to Court
"Within the week, we'll bo back
in court again seeking a writ of
habeas corpus charging the <state
with cruel and unusual punish
ment," Davis said. "The next line
of attack is to prove this case to
any judge we can get to, until we
get the light decision," Davis
said.
Chessman has been in Death
Row since 1918. The 38-year-old
convict has won eight execution
stays and 15 times reached the
U.S. Supreme Court in his fight
against conviction for sex crimes
in lovers' lane in Los Angeles.
Forced acts of sexual perversion
on two women during holdups
were adjudged kidnaping with
bodily harm, for robbery — pun
ishable by death. None of his vic
tims died.
Another facet of the Chessman
case developed yesterday- release
of a film "Justice and Caryl
Chessman," for showing last night
in 43 California movie theaters.

12-year fight on Death Row
against execution now can be ex
tended through at least 30 court
judges by virtue of the governor's
tenth-hour reprieve last Friday.
"That means there are 30
chances in this game for Chess
man's life and those are better
odds than playing rou 1e t t e,"
asserted the attorney, George T.
Davis.
Davis charted his next move
while controversies swirled over
what part the U.S. State Depart
ment played in the reprieve and
just when Chessman's next death
date could be set.
State Department
In Washington, Sen. Strom
Thurmond (D-SC) told the Sen
ate that Roy R. Rubottom Jr., as
sistant secretary of state, should
be "severly condemned" for the
telegram sent Gov. Brown. It
•stated the execution might stir up
ant i - American demonst art ions
during President Eisenhower's
Latin American visit. Brown said
the telegram weighed strongly in
his decision to reprieve Chessman
for 60 days.
Sen. Thurmond's criticism of
the State Department in Wash
ington followed by a few hours
another by Sen. Barry Goldwater
R-Ariz.
"It is repugnant to me to see
our State Department so weak
kneed," Goldwater said.
Political Motive
Another senator, Theodore
Francis Green (D-RI) said in a
telegram to a constituent that the
State Department action "appears
to have subtle political motiva
tions."
But Green, former chairman of
the Senate Fore i g n Relations
Committee, said Brown's reprieve
in the light of the Rubottom tele
gram was defensible. Green said
Brown would have subjected him
self to severe criticism had the
execution been carried out and
anti-American demonstrations did
break out against President
Eisenhower.
Davis said the circumstances
surrounding the reprieve—Chess-
man already in a room next to
the gas chamber, with the execu
tion less than 10 hours away—
constituted "cruel and unusual
punishment."
Will Return to Court
"Within the week, we'll bo back
in court again seeking a writ of
habeas corpus charging the <state
with cruel and unusual punish
ment," Davis said. "The next line
of attack is to prove this case to
any judge we can get to, until we
get the light decision," Davis
said.
Chessman has been in Death
Row since 1918. The 38-year-old
convict has won eight execution
stays and 15 times reached the
U.S. Supreme Court in his fight
against conviction for sex crimes
in lovers' lane in Los Angeles.
Forced acts of sexual perversion
on two women during holdups
were adjudged kidnaping with
bodily harm, for robbery — pun
ishable by death. None of his vic
tims died.
Another facet of the Chessman
case developed yesterday- release
of a film "Justice and Caryl
Chessman," for showing last night
in 43 California movie theaters.
