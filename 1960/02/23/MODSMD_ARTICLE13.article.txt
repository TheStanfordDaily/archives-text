# Statistics or Principle?
## 
### 
The (ihessiuan fiasco has liminio as much a rase I«»r the politi
cians as for llic courts. Public opinion, because of the publicity
given the case, li;is become preoccupied with political pressures
and international opinion.
However, the case remains a problem of law. From the politics
and personalities involved, the citizens of California must extract
and judge capital punishment.
The traditional arguments for capital punishment appear more
founded in emotion than in fact.
Nine states lui\e done away with capital punishment. I here
has resulted no appreciable change in the murder rate. Ihe basic
argument for the deterrent value of the death sentence is not
supported h\ conclusive evidence.
Foreign countries which have no death penalty have also man
aged to a\oid violent depopulation. Murder rates have remained
unchanged.
The argument that executions s;i\e the Slate money is absurd,
even if in fact true. If the death penally is supported because il
removes from taxpayers the burden of maintaining society s out
casts, then the value of life has been reduced lo dollars and cents.
Il also appears that those without money or friends are the
primary \ictims of the death penally. Prisoners with means usu
ally manage to circumvent death.
One fact stands out in the history of the death penally mis
takes have been made.
Mistakes of the past can be repealed in ihe future. And even
the slightest possibility of inflicting the ultimate injustice is suffi
cient lo undermine the validity of any absolute penalty.
If society seeks only protection from its transgressors rather
than revenge against them, isolation 112 rom that society is sufficient.
Death is superfluous.
In the filial analysis all arguments based on statistics are in
complete. The question is, above all, one of principle. We who
value individual life so highly should wake up to the anachro
nism of the death penally and abolish il.
