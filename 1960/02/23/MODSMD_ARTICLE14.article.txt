# Purposes of Capital Punishment Refuted
## 
### W.L. Kinsolving 
Since last Wednesday, the case
for or against Caryl Chessman
has stolen the imagination of
both the public and the press
away from the sensational Finch
trial, the birth of a prince, and
an upcoming foreign tour by
President Eisenhower.
In presenting the issue of cap
ital punishment, it must be made
clear that the issue is not Chess
man but capital punishment. In
this article, Chessman is consid
ered only as one victim of this
particular law.
The most obvious justification
for capital punishment cited by
its defenders is that execution is
a deterrent. This is a false as
sumption. Consider the murderer:
if his plan is premeditated that
is if he has worked out a "per
fect murder"â€”he is hardly think
ing about getting caught.
Amorous Relationships
The most common type of will
ful homicide, involving spouses
and others in armorous relation
ships, is manifestly so devoid of
rational thinking that it would be
absurd to assume that the mur
dered would consider the deter
rent of the gas chamber.
Conceding to the ineffective
ness of the death penalty as a
deterrent, nine states have al
ready abolished the penalty as a
form of social justice: Alaska,
Delaware, Hawaii, Maine. Michi
gan, Minnesota, Rhode Island,
South Dakota, and Wisconsin.
Moreover, the average homicide
rate in 19.14 in ihe U.S. per 100,000
population, in the states that
abolished capital punishment, was
1.5, while the national average
was 4.8. This it not due to any
difference in population of states.
States that abolish the death pen
alty have had fewer murders than
non-abolition states with a com
parable populat ion.
Georgia
The state that has had the most
executions of murderers in its
history is Georgia, but Georgia is
still today the state with the high
est murder rate.
Another defense given by those
who favor capital punishment is
that there is no reason for society
to pay good tax money to keep a
murderer alive. This dollars-and
cents measurement seems greatly
to cheapen life.
It costs California only $1,400
pei year to keep a prisoner in
San Quentin: approximately .14

of one cent per citizen per year.
Capital punishment increases this
cost by au added $15,000 per year
for the maintenance of the death
row alone.
Aside from these misconcep
tions, what then is wrong with
capital punishment? Every execu
tion is a possible mistake. Both
eye witnesses and laboratory
technicians are capable of error.
In his book "Convicting the In
nocent," Professor Borchard of
Yale cites 146 cases of mistaken
conviction. Similar examples are
found in Arthur Koestler's "Re
flections on Hanging."
Tragic Error
Putting a man in jail for some
thing he did not do is a tragic,
but reparable, error of society;
execution is final. This alone is
a demand for the abolition of the
death penalty.
Statistics suggest a racial dis
crimination in the administration
of the death penalty, evidenced by
the overwhelming percentage of
Negroes executed for conviction
of rape.
Capital punishment is econom
ically discriminating in that the
well-educated and the wealthy
usually have tho best lawyers
available and may circumvent the
charges. One San Quentin guard
said. "I've only seen the friend
less and the poor get it." Al
though generalizations of this
type are not always accurate, Ihe
fact that money can and does
affect capital punishment is rea
son enough for abolition.
Malice
A good definition of first de
gree murder is killing with pre
meditated malice. Capital punish
ment fits this definition: there is
little that is more premediated,
cold-blooded, and ceremoniously
drawn out than an execution.
Capital punishment becomes
legalized murder.
The moral absurdity of show
ing indignant disapproval of kill
ing by further killing justifies the
feeling of contempt for America
that the some forty nations who
have abolished eapiial punish
ment must feel.
Many of these arguments in
volve other injustices besides cap
ital punishment. But the immedi
ate decision which the State of
California must make is upon the
legal question of capita] punish
ment. And the evidence indicates
that this form of punishment has
become a social injustice.
