# Stanford Symphony Shows Balance, Spirit, Precision
## 
### Stephen Young 
Characterized by fine playing
with real precision and spirit, the
Stanford Symphony presented a
well - balanced and well - received
program Friday night. Conductor
Sandor Salgo showed real in
sight into the works, and success
fully communicated it to the
orchestra.
The opening work, Cherubim's
Symphony in D, is a well-con
structed and satisfying work, if
not a great one. The composer's
only work in symphonic form, the
piece shows an individual use of
the classic style in its facile
counterpoint and striking har
monic changes. Except for a little
unsteadiness at the opening, the
performance was an excellent
one. Especially notable was the
woodwind playing in ihe trio of
the third movement.
Warm Reading
Debussy's ethereally beautiful
tone poem, the Prelude to an
Afternoon of a Faun, was given
a very sensitive and warm read
ing which was most satisfying.
The playing of tho solo flute and
oboe, so important to the piece,
was characterized by a strong
feeling for the mood of the com
position.
Conrad Beck's song-cycle, Au
umn-Fire Songs, was sung by
contralto Margot Blum. The cycle
is in six sections, each of which
speaks of nature and its deifica
tion with a brooding and highly
symbolic feeling of fatalism.
Miss Blum's voice is extremely
well-suited for this work. She
possesses a beautiful tone and an
unerring sense of pitch, much
needed in a difficult work such as
this. But even more, the audience
was particularly stirred by her
obvious insight and dramatic feel
ing for every affect of Ihe text.
Without exception, her perform
ance was of ihe highest calibre,
and. coupled with the sensitive ac
companiment of the orchestra,
contributed a great deal toward
the successful reading of this im
pressive new work.
Farewell Symphony
The final scheduled work was
Haydn's "Farewell Symphony."
Written in 1772, a result of the
composers' "storm and stress"
period, it is an impressive work,
using bold harmonies and dra
matic motives. But the chief ap
peal of the symphony must lie
in the story behind its title. Find
ing himself in need of a long
overdue vacation, Haydn added a
coda to the final movement, in
which the musicians cease to play
one by one, blow out the candles

on their music stands, and leave.
Finally only two violins are left.
History tells us that this clever
hint was successful, and Haydn,
and his players were granted
their vacation.
This aspect of the work was
strongly emphasized in Stanford's
performance. Six lovely young
ladies from Sigma Alpha lota lit
the candles of the players, and the
lights were turned out. In this
charming setting, the symphony
was performed.
As the players left, the stage
slowly darkened, until even the
conductor left. The two violinists
continued to play to ihe end. Then
the stage was in darkness, mak
ing a very effective conclusion.
Unfortunately, this authentic set
ting meant that the musical con
tent suffered, since the players
frequently were unable to see
their music or the conductor.
This introduced a certain uneven
ness into the performance.
Their encore, the overture to
Mozart's opera, The Marriage of
Figaro, was played very quickly
with a real sparkle and verve,
ending the concert on a very suc
cessful note.

oboe, so important to the piece,
was characterized by a strong
feeling for the mood of the com
position.
Conrad Beck's song-cycle, Au
umn-Fire Songs, was sung by
contralto Margot Blum. The cycle
is in six sections, each of which
speaks of nature and its deifica
tion with a brooding and highly
symbolic feeling of fatalism.
Miss Blum's voice is extremely
well-suited for this work. She
possesses a beautiful tone and an
unerring sense of pitch, much
needed in a difficult work such as
this. But even more, the audience
was particularly stirred by her
obvious insight and dramatic feel
ing for every affect of Ihe text.
Without exception, her perform
ance was of ihe highest calibre,
and. coupled with the sensitive ac
companiment of the orchestra,
contributed a great deal toward
the successful reading of this im
pressive new work.
Farewell Symphony
The final scheduled work was
Haydn's "Farewell Symphony."
Written in 1772, a result of the
composers' "storm and stress"
period, it is an impressive work,
using bold harmonies and dra
matic motives. But the chief ap
peal of the symphony must lie
in the story behind its title. Find
ing himself in need of a long
overdue vacation, Haydn added a
coda to the final movement, in
which the musicians cease to play
one by one, blow out the candles

on their music stands, and leave.
Finally only two violins are left.
History tells us that this clever
hint was successful, and Haydn,
and his players were granted
their vacation.
This aspect of the work was
strongly emphasized in Stanford's
performance. Six lovely young
ladies from Sigma Alpha lota lit
the candles of the players, and the
lights were turned out. In this
charming setting, the symphony
was performed.
As the players left, the stage
slowly darkened, until even the
conductor left. The two violinists
continued to play to ihe end. Then
the stage was in darkness, mak
ing a very effective conclusion.
Unfortunately, this authentic set
ting meant that the musical con
tent suffered, since the players
frequently were unable to see
their music or the conductor.
This introduced a certain uneven
ness into the performance.
Their encore, the overture to
Mozart's opera, The Marriage of
Figaro, was played very quickly
with a real sparkle and verve,
ending the concert on a very suc
cessful note.
Characterized by fine playing
with real precision and spirit, the
Stanford Symphony presented a
well - balanced and well - received
program Friday night. Conductor
Sandor Salgo showed real in
sight into the works, and success
fully communicated it to the
orchestra.
The opening work, Cherubim's
Symphony in D, is a well-con
structed and satisfying work, if
not a great one. The composer's
only work in symphonic form, the
piece shows an individual use of
the classic style in its facile
counterpoint and striking har
monic changes. Except for a little
unsteadiness at the opening, the
performance was an excellent
one. Especially notable was the
woodwind playing in ihe trio of
the third movement.
