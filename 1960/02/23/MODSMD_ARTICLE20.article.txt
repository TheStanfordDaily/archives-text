## PRESS BOX Stanford in Squaw Valley? 
### 
While this writer and several friends spent the weekend ii
sunny Monterey, hundreds of Stanford students trooped up to Squaw
Valley to see the Olympics. The Daily sports slaff although 111 i
time merely interested spectators will attempt to present Olympi<
features with the Stanford angle in mind. George Wyse a formei
Daily photog should return after a weekend of snapping pic-s
-and swapping stories with Olympic participants and spectators alike
Next week Boh Mathewson of the Stanford Ski Club will writt
a column on the whole ten days of the Games and will comment and
slant his article to Farm residents.
KZSIJ got into the act of Olympic coverage as .Marty Mandle!-
reported that Stanford gridder Hill Donohue has been up at Squaw
in the Pavilion, around the rink, and on the slopes interviewing

participants, coaches and mem
bers of the Olympic Committee
with his tape recorder, liill will
broadcast these tapes tonight on
.Marty's show on KZSU from 6:30
to 7:30.
Besides being a good defensive
end for the Indians this season,
Donohue is an excellent skiing
member of the Auborn Ski Team
and has traversed the same slopes
as all the experts in the downhill
and slalom runs. Anyone interest
ed in the first hand reports from
all the Olympic ski experts should
tune in tonight at (i:3O.
Yesterday, the Daily's Al Miller
returned from Squaw and his fine
analysis of the first four days
of the Olympics follows below on
this page.
Certainly everyone was â– sur
prised with the American show
ing thus far in the Winter Games.
First of all there was the big
hassle between committee mem
bers and officials and then offi
cials and coaches and members

ni the different national teams. But finally as the storm both the
blizzard and all the conflicts blew away from Squaw the spectators
poured in and so far everything has been running fairly smoothly.
After the Olympics had gotten off the ground the next surprise
was the good U.S. showing in several events namly the speed
skating and slalom. Although the Olympics have always been em
phasized as strictly an individual affair the extreme national pres
sure and pride has made the "un-official" team scoring one of the
most important results of the meet.
