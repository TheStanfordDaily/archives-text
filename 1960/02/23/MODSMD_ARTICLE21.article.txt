# U.S. Chances Up
## 
### 
The Americans have always been considered also-rans in all
phases of the Winter Fvent with the exception of U.S. dominated
figure skating. Yes the Russians, Scandinavians and Alpine country
moil are all figured to top jumping, cross-country and nearly all
women's events. But Jeanne Ashworth's bronze medal in the 500-
meter speed skating event and Tom Corooran's fourth in the giant
slalom gave Americans some hope of breaking into world prominence
in these events.
And now let's take a look at the basketball results. Actually this
should be entitled "A Requiem for a Basketball Team." The Indians
are all but eliminated from a chance at the Big Five title after their
one-point, heartbreaking loss to tJCLA Friday night and can only
hope to salvage some pride by whipping USC and CAL in their last
three ball games. #
Cal looks like the sure winner as they did at the beginning of
the season after whipping the Bruins Saturday night to move two
games out in front. However, Cal certainly can be beaten by the
Cards at least on the friendly home court. Tribe cagers should be
up for it and senior* John Arrillaga and Neal Broekmeyer could lead
the team to their best performance for tin 1 year in the season's finale.
