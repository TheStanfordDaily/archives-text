Unsuccessful United States ski
ers, beautiful women, 10,000 bun
dled spectators and crisp weather
were the scene for the first four
days of the VIII Olympic Winter-
Games this Weekend at Squaw
Valley.
The Russians dominated with
86 points and their best events
are still to come. Germany and
Sweden followed with IS and 29
points respectively. The U.S. has
only 16 points in fourth place and
has yet to win a gold medal.
The best Uncle Sam could do
was to start pulling a lock on
the figure skating event. It was
pretty Carol Ileiss who kept I he
U.S. from being routed. She has
piled up a commanding lead in
the compulsory figure skating
but her medal will not become
official until today when the tree
skating figures are performed.
Barbara Roles and Owen Law
rence Jr., currently in third and
fourth position in points, promise
to help the U.S. gain medals in
this event.
Blond Penny Pitou missed first
place in the ladies' downhill off
KT22 mountain Saturday by one
second and had to settle for a
silver medal in a race which the
United States had hoped to sweep.
Of the other U.S. starters, Betsy
Suite fell shortly after the start.
Joan Hannah finished 21st and
Linda Meyers finished 33rd after
tumbling on the treacherous air
plane turn of the lower slope.
To further offset the U.S. gloom
Saturday was a surprising third

| place finish by Joanne Ashworth
in Hie 500-meter speed skating.
The victory ceremony, held
each day under the Olympic
I Torch and surrounded by the
flags and shields of all partici
pating nations seemed to capture
the spirit of ancient games.
Hound-robin hockey continued
in Blyth Arena where Canada and
Russia stood out on top. Friday
afternoon the United States up
set Czechoslovakia 7-4.
The west ice rink drew many
spectators whore figure skating
was being practiced. The German
i girls entered in all events ap
; peared to many to be the most
j beautiful. Overwhelmed by their
blond hair and blue eyes, many
could be heard to exclaim. "Ah
j frnulein!"
As the anthem of each gold
1 medal country was played, as
| heralders' t r u mp e t s blew, as
smiles, kisses and handshakes
I were exchanged, there was a feel
i ing throughout the crowd that a
i cold war was non-existent.

Russia stood out on top. Friday
afternoon the United States up
set Czechoslovakia 7-4.
The west ice rink drew many
spectators whore figure skating
was being practiced. The German
i girls entered in all events ap
; peared to many to be the most
j beautiful. Overwhelmed by their
blond hair and blue eyes, many
could be heard to exclaim. "Ah
j frnulein!"
As the anthem of each gold
1 medal country was played, as
| heralders' t r u mp e t s blew, as
smiles, kisses and handshakes
I were exchanged, there was a feel
i ing throughout the crowd that a
i cold war was non-existent.
Unsuccessful United States ski
ers, beautiful women, 10,000 bun
dled spectators and crisp weather
were the scene for the first four
days of the VIII Olympic Winter-
Games this Weekend at Squaw
Valley.
The Russians dominated with
86 points and their best events
are still to come. Germany and
Sweden followed with IS and 29
points respectively. The U.S. has
only 16 points in fourth place and
has yet to win a gold medal.
The best Uncle Sam could do
was to start pulling a lock on
the figure skating event. It was
pretty Carol Ileiss who kept I he
U.S. from being routed. She has
piled up a commanding lead in
the compulsory figure skating
but her medal will not become
official until today when the tree
skating figures are performed.
Barbara Roles and Owen Law
rence Jr., currently in third and
fourth position in points, promise
to help the U.S. gain medals in
this event.
Blond Penny Pitou missed first
place in the ladies' downhill off
KT22 mountain Saturday by one
second and had to settle for a
silver medal in a race which the
United States had hoped to sweep.
Of the other U.S. starters, Betsy
Suite fell shortly after the start.
Joan Hannah finished 21st and
Linda Meyers finished 33rd after
tumbling on the treacherous air
plane turn of the lower slope.
To further offset the U.S. gloom
Saturday was a surprising third

| place finish by Joanne Ashworth
in Hie 500-meter speed skating.
The victory ceremony, held
each day under the Olympic
I Torch and surrounded by the
flags and shields of all partici
pating nations seemed to capture
the spirit of ancient games.
Hound-robin hockey continued
