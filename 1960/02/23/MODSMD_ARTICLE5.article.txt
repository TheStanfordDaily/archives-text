# Disarmament Felt Feasible

The United States can absorb I
Ihe economic impact of disarma-1
ment if there is government plan
ning in advance, William M. Cap-!
run, Stanford profe s so r of'
economics, told the Women's In- i
ternational League for Peace and
Freedom on Friday.
He said defense spending could j
bo drastically cut without affect- j
ing employment if a program of j
combined cash cuts and a shift of !
defense dollars to other federal
programs is begun. He said the
shift was preferable to a drastic j
cutting of taxes because a private
enterprise economy will not spend
as much on research as the public !
wants. The government should I
subsidize high level research at
a level comparable to that now
spent for defense.
Capron said the transition could 1
be eased by spending a few bil- ;
lion dollars more on space explor-;
at ion, but he was not sure that
we knew enough about space ex
ploration to devote the entire $45
billion a year to it that now goes
to defense.
He added that foreign economic
aid would have to be increased by
enough to set off reduced foreign
military aid. He concluded that
he and most economists do not
believe tax cuts alone would off
set the drop in national product
caused by lessened defense spend
ing.
