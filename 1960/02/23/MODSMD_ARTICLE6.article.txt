# EFFECTIVE TODAY
## Bikes Barred from Quad; Pedestrians Chalk Up Win 
### Jerry Rankin 
Permanent barring of bicycles
lrom Inner Quad starling today
the first of several moves to com
bat the Stanford bicycle hazard
was announced yesterday by
Sasha Lanz, head of the LASSU
committee working on the prob
lem.
Bicyclists who previously
parked on Inner Quad from now
on must leave their bikes in the
gravel area running behind the
English department past Memo
rial Church to the rear of the
math department, or in one of the
existing parking areas off Inner-
Quad.
The Corporation Yard has built
two asphalt bicycle ramps con
necting Escondido Road, running
behind Inner Quad, with the
gravel area for easy access to the
parking spaces.
Gate Closed
Another measure taken is the,
permanent closing of the iron
gate across from the Main li
brary, one of the chief entrances
to Inner Quad.
That intersection has been the
scene of many near-accidents be
tween bicycles and pedestrians,
and the situation there led to
many complaints from irate pe
destrians.
The gate at the other end of
Quad, across from the Physics
Lecture Hall, will remain open so
bike riders can get to the bike
racks behind Physics Corner.
Eventually, the Un iv e r si I y
plans to install bicycle racks in
the gravel area behind the Eng
lish and math departments and
Memorial Church.
Administration Approves
The University administration,
concerned over the bike -safety
problem, has approved the bike
ban, accor ding to Lanz.
There is actually a law on the
books prohibiting bicycles from
being on Inner Quad, so the meas
ures being taken are simply at
tempts to enforce that rule.
Lanz noted that enforcement of
bicycle safety measures will
mainly depend on the cooperation
of their owners. He urged all bike
riders to think, go slow and watch
where they are going.
He also pointed out that riders
should try to observe such ob
vious "rules of the road" as stop
ping at stop signs and riding on
the right side of the street.
Dangerous Spot
One dangerous spot on cam
pus is the sidewalk iir front of
the Physics Lecture Hall, Lanz
said. Pedestrians often must walk
in the street to get around the
jam of bikes obstructing the side
walk.
A marked-off parking space
will be set aside in the near fu
ture to alleviate the situation, he
said.
Rich Sundeen, ASSU president,
notes that "In the last five years
the popularity of the bicycle as a
means of transportation on the
campus has increased to the ex
tent that there is a necessity of
controlling it."

Besides abolishing bikes from
Inner Quad, other steps under
consideration to control the prob
lem include "attempting to re
route the present bicycle traffic
pattern," Sundeen said.
"Also to solve the apparent
dangers of night bicycle riders,
the Legislature would like to
make inexpensive lights available
to those who ride bikes at night.
"Interviews will be held tomor
row, 2:30-5 p.m. in the ASSU Ex-
Com Room for anyone interested
in heading the sale of these lights.
A profit will be made by the two
persons selected," he said.

Permanent barring of bicycles
lrom Inner Quad starling today
the first of several moves to com
bat the Stanford bicycle hazard
was announced yesterday by
Sasha Lanz, head of the LASSU
committee working on the prob
lem.
Bicyclists who previously
parked on Inner Quad from now
on must leave their bikes in the
gravel area running behind the
English department past Memo
rial Church to the rear of the
math department, or in one of the
existing parking areas off Inner-
Quad.
The Corporation Yard has built
two asphalt bicycle ramps con
necting Escondido Road, running
behind Inner Quad, with the
gravel area for easy access to the
parking spaces.
Gate Closed
Another measure taken is the,
permanent closing of the iron
gate across from the Main li
brary, one of the chief entrances
to Inner Quad.
That intersection has been the
scene of many near-accidents be
tween bicycles and pedestrians,
and the situation there led to
many complaints from irate pe
destrians.
The gate at the other end of
Quad, across from the Physics
Lecture Hall, will remain open so
bike riders can get to the bike
racks behind Physics Corner.
Eventually, the Un iv e r si I y
plans to install bicycle racks in
the gravel area behind the Eng
lish and math departments and
Memorial Church.
Administration Approves
The University administration,
concerned over the bike -safety
problem, has approved the bike
ban, accor ding to Lanz.
There is actually a law on the
books prohibiting bicycles from
being on Inner Quad, so the meas
ures being taken are simply at
tempts to enforce that rule.
Lanz noted that enforcement of
bicycle safety measures will
mainly depend on the cooperation
of their owners. He urged all bike
riders to think, go slow and watch
where they are going.
He also pointed out that riders
should try to observe such ob
vious "rules of the road" as stop
ping at stop signs and riding on
the right side of the street.
Dangerous Spot
One dangerous spot on cam
pus is the sidewalk iir front of
the Physics Lecture Hall, Lanz
said. Pedestrians often must walk
in the street to get around the
jam of bikes obstructing the side
walk.
A marked-off parking space
will be set aside in the near fu
ture to alleviate the situation, he
said.
Rich Sundeen, ASSU president,
notes that "In the last five years
the popularity of the bicycle as a
means of transportation on the
campus has increased to the ex
tent that there is a necessity of
controlling it."

Besides abolishing bikes from
Inner Quad, other steps under
consideration to control the prob
lem include "attempting to re
route the present bicycle traffic
pattern," Sundeen said.
"Also to solve the apparent
dangers of night bicycle riders,
the Legislature would like to
make inexpensive lights available
to those who ride bikes at night.
"Interviews will be held tomor
row, 2:30-5 p.m. in the ASSU Ex-
Com Room for anyone interested
in heading the sale of these lights.

persons selected," he said.
