## Watkins to Speak at Rally; Petitions to Be Circulated 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
Professor James T. Watkins IV will speak in Memorial Auditor
ium at noon today in order to carry on a very old fight that suddenly
seems to have a chance to be won.
The talk, called "The Choice Before U<s," is in protest to the
practice of capital punishment as a form of social justice. Intended

to gather support for its abolition
in tlie California State Legisla
ture. petitions to ho sent to Gov
ernor Edmund (J. Brown will
read:
"We, the undersigned students
and faculty of Stanford Univer
sity, protest the practice of cap
ital punishment. We urge the
Legislature of the State of Cali
fornia to repeal the statutes which
proscribe execution as a form of
social justice."
Special Session Called
Brown lias called a special ses
sion of the Legislature for next
Monday and delayed all execu
tions 60 days to allow the Legisla
ture to consider whether it wants
to abolish the death penalty.
Watkins devoted the hour of
his Political Science 117 class Fri
day to speaking against capital
punishment.
The talk will be sponsored
jointly by Breakers, The Daily
and Sequoia.
Petitions to Circulate
Petitions will he outside of Me
morial Auditorium before and
after the talk and on engineering
corner throughout the week.
There will be two petitions, one
for faculty and students of voting

age who are residents of Californ
ia and one for out-of-state and
under-voting-age students and fac
ulty.
So that students may write
their legislators, a list of Californ
ia legislators will be at the table
along with the petitions and in
today's Daily.
Introduced by Vigil Sitter
Watkins will be introduced by
Tuie Kinsolving, who initiated the
speech and the petitions. â€¢
Kinsolving, a senior, was at
San Quentin Thursday night to
sit a vigil along with approxi
mately 60 sludents from the Uni
versity of California, San Fran
cisco State College and San Jose
State College and people from the
Palo Alto area who are interested
in doing away with capital
punishment.
Inform People Quickly
Kinsolving's idea is to get in
formation about capital punish
ment to as many people as possi
ble as quickly as possible so that
the petitions expressing public
feeling can go to Brown before
the Legislature meets.
The talk is open to the public,
and Kinsolving and others will
talk at living groups on request.
There will also be a debate at
Kepler's Bookstore Friday at 8:30
p.m. between Park Chamberlain,
a Los Altos lawyer 1 , and Richard
Pantell, associate professdr of
electrical engineering, on whether
or not to abolish capital punish
ment.
