# Brown Releases Letter; Watkins Advises Mercy
## 'Death Penalty Harms Society' 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
Speaking in Memorial Audito
rium yesterday, Professor James
T. Watkins IV condemned capital
punishment and put it into a
much broader context than that
of Caryl Chessman versus the
people of California.
Watkins spoke from the posi
tion of a layman, a voting citizen
and as an adult voice whose opin
ion is based "on a lifetime of
observation and reflection."
The speech, sponsored jointly
by Breakers, The Daily and The
Sequoia, was attended by a crowd
of 500 students and faculty and
assorted members of the press,
radio and television.
Watkins said, "It in the decep
tively unimportant area of a
man's relations with his immedi
ate neighbors- his associates, his
family, the men and women about
him . . . whose sum total can
gradually mold us into the kind
of men and women who are the
rotten eggs out of which no good
omelet was ever made though
Gorl Himself be at the stove."
Capital punishment is but a
symptom of the disease of man
indifference to the crimes against,
his dignity Watkins said, and
I "It is for the disease that the
I physician must seek a cure."
Plea for Mercy
He quoted Clarence Darrow in
his defense of Loeb and Leopold
j in 1924:
"I am pleading for life, under
standing, charity, kindness and
! for the infinite mercy that con
siders all. I am pleading that we
; overcome cruelty with kindness
and hatred with love . . .
"I am pleading for the future.
' I am pleading for a time when
we can learn by reason and judg-
I mont and understanding and faith
I that life is worth saving and that
j mercy is the highest attribute of
man."
Watkins had two objections to
capital punishment: one, its effect
on society; the other, its effect on
the rest of the world as it looks
at the United States.
In the world community, the
i U.S. was originally looked on as
the foremost slave holder, then
as the home of Sacco and Vanzetti
and today as Little Rock, Ark
! ansas.
"Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps
there is no correspondence be*
I tween moral and political leader
; ship. But I think there is," Wat
i kins said.
"The question is no longer
I whether but when capital punish
i ment will be abolished," he said.
He cited the Loeb-Leopold case
as a great step forward for crimi
; nal law.
"Mercy - if life imprisonment
be mercy rather than justice
if execution be justice — was ex*
i tended in 1924 ..."
Another Step Forward
He posed the quest i on of
whether man is ready to take
another step forward. The real
issue is "whether even a man
j who acts like a rat should be
treated like a rat or whether, be
cause we, the rest of us, are men
we are bound to treat him like a
man."
Thus the issue l rests not on
j sentimentality but on respect for
the dignity of man, on self re
spect and on respect for the hu*

Speaking in Memorial Audito
rium yesterday, Professor James
T. Watkins IV condemned capital
punishment and put it into a
much broader context than that
of Caryl Chessman versus the
people of California.
Watkins spoke from the posi
tion of a layman, a voting citizen
and as an adult voice whose opin
ion is based "on a lifetime of
observation and reflection."
The speech, sponsored jointly
by Breakers, The Daily and The
Sequoia, was attended by a crowd
of 500 students and faculty and
assorted members of the press,
radio and television.
Watkins said, "It in the decep
tively unimportant area of a
man's relations with his immedi
ate neighbors- his associates, his
family, the men and women about
him . . . whose sum total can
gradually mold us into the kind
of men and women who are the
rotten eggs out of which no good
omelet was ever made though
Gorl Himself be at the stove."
Capital punishment is but a
symptom of the disease of man
indifference to the crimes against,
his dignity Watkins said, and
I "It is for the disease that the
I physician must seek a cure."
Plea for Mercy
He quoted Clarence Darrow in
his defense of Loeb and Leopold
j in 1924:
"I am pleading for life, under
standing, charity, kindness and
! for the infinite mercy that con
siders all. I am pleading that we
; overcome cruelty with kindness
and hatred with love . . .
"I am pleading for the future.
' I am pleading for a time when
we can learn by reason and judg-
I mont and understanding and faith
I that life is worth saving and that
j mercy is the highest attribute of
man."
Watkins had two objections to
capital punishment: one, its effect
on society; the other, its effect on
the rest of the world as it looks
at the United States.
In the world community, the
i U.S. was originally looked on as
the foremost slave holder, then
as the home of Sacco and Vanzetti
and today as Little Rock, Ark
! ansas.
"Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps
there is no correspondence be*
I tween moral and political leader
; ship. But I think there is," Wat
i kins said.
"The question is no longer
I whether but when capital punish
i ment will be abolished," he said.
He cited the Loeb-Leopold case
as a great step forward for crimi
; nal law.
"Mercy - if life imprisonment
be mercy rather than justice
if execution be justice — was ex*
i tended in 1924 ..."
Another Step Forward
He posed the quest i on of
whether man is ready to take
another step forward. The real
issue is "whether even a man
j who acts like a rat should be
treated like a rat or whether, be
cause we, the rest of us, are men
we are bound to treat him like a
man."
Thus the issue l rests not on
j sentimentality but on respect for
the dignity of man, on self re
spect and on respect for the hu*

Speaking in Memorial Audito
rium yesterday, Professor James
T. Watkins IV condemned capital
punishment and put it into a
much broader context than that
of Caryl Chessman versus the
people of California.
Watkins spoke from the posi
tion of a layman, a voting citizen
and as an adult voice whose opin
ion is based "on a lifetime of
observation and reflection."
The speech, sponsored jointly
by Breakers, The Daily and The
Sequoia, was attended by a crowd
of 500 students and faculty and
assorted members of the press,
radio and television.
Watkins said, "It in the decep
tively unimportant area of a
man's relations with his immedi
ate neighbors- his associates, his
family, the men and women about
him . . . whose sum total can
gradually mold us into the kind
of men and women who are the
rotten eggs out of which no good
omelet was ever made though
Gorl Himself be at the stove."
Capital punishment is but a
symptom of the disease of man
indifference to the crimes against,
his dignity Watkins said, and
I "It is for the disease that the
I physician must seek a cure."
Plea for Mercy
He quoted Clarence Darrow in
his defense of Loeb and Leopold
j in 1924:
"I am pleading for life, under
standing, charity, kindness and
! for the infinite mercy that con
siders all. I am pleading that we
; overcome cruelty with kindness
and hatred with love . . .
"I am pleading for the future.
' I am pleading for a time when
we can learn by reason and judg-
I mont and understanding and faith
I that life is worth saving and that
j mercy is the highest attribute of
man."
Watkins had two objections to
capital punishment: one, its effect
on society; the other, its effect on
the rest of the world as it looks
at the United States.
In the world community, the
i U.S. was originally looked on as
the foremost slave holder, then
as the home of Sacco and Vanzetti
and today as Little Rock, Ark
! ansas.
"Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps
there is no correspondence be*
I tween moral and political leader
; ship. But I think there is," Wat
i kins said.
"The question is no longer
I whether but when capital punish
i ment will be abolished," he said.
He cited the Loeb-Leopold case
as a great step forward for crimi
; nal law.
"Mercy - if life imprisonment
be mercy rather than justice
if execution be justice — was ex*
i tended in 1924 ..."
Another Step Forward
He posed the quest i on of
whether man is ready to take
another step forward. The real
issue is "whether even a man
j who acts like a rat should be
treated like a rat or whether, be
cause we, the rest of us, are men
we are bound to treat him like a
man."
Thus the issue l rests not on
j sentimentality but on respect for
the dignity of man, on self re
spect and on respect for the hu*
