### 
Governor Brown and Carvl Chessman have been hung in
elligy in Southern California. In Sacramento Senator K.duin J.
Kegan, chairman of the State Senate Judiciary Committee, re
marked that most legislators "resent being put into a position
where an emotional problem is l>t»injjs made the subject ol a
legislative decision.**
The effigy hangings do represent a low decree of unthinking
emotionalism. On one hand they illustrate the effects ol the
judicial mishandling of the Chessman case, lint on the other
hand, as Dr. Walkius pointed out yesterday, the\ reflect the truly
harmful ell'ecl capital punishment can have on society.
Hut the question of capital punishment aroused l>\ the Chess
man case has effected more than this distressing emotionalism. It
has presented the government and people of California and
the nation with a fundamental question of principle.
Very seldom do our national and state legislatures face speci
fic questions of moral principle under the glare of such extensive
publicity. Their discomfort is understandable.
\ el it should be recognized that this emotionalism and pub
licity have had the power to force a legislative decision about
capital punishment, a decision which the moral question alone
has been unable lo ell'ecl for main years.
The legislators should recognize that while the Chessman
case has had an unfortunate effect of distorted emotionalism, it
has been, and is still, basically a question of legal morality, not
an "emotional problem.
Il i> to be hoped that the California legislators will seriously
probe the moral question underlying the Chessman case in the
special session of Legislature to be called next week.
Moral sensibility is a responsibility of legislative power: we
trust that mercy and human dignity can be extracted from the
tangle of emotionalism which surrounds the Chessman ease.
