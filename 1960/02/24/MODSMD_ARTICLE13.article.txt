Quite frequently, this pertinent,
question arises, "Which country [
has the better educational system, I
England or America?" Alan Simp- •
son, professor of English history!
at the University of Chicago and j
a graduate of Oxford University, (
gave his views on the matter in j
a recent issue of the Chicago
Maroon, the university's news-1
paper.
Simpson first of all pointed to
the tutorial system in England as :
opposed to the more regimented |
instructional system in the U.S. i
The student meets with his tutor I
weekly, alone or with one or two |
other students.
The tutor assigns an essay
topic for the following week and
then the present week's paper
is read and analyzed. "If you're
taking your work seriously as. I
was, you write a 12 to 19 page
paper every week," stated Simp
son.
He said that the merit of such
a system is the opportunity the
student has to receive personal
attention from an instructor. "One 1
also develops a pretty good Eng-!
lish style from writing a sub-!
stantial essay every week," Simp
son said. As proof, he added that 1
he sees a marked difference be
tween the products of English j
and American schools in their
"fluency on paper."
Simpson also commented on
the reading problem. He said
that it has puzzled him whether
or not students whose courses
are based on required reading
lists would ever have time to
read and discover books out
side their courses.
American universities, on Ihe<
other hand, do have some ad
vantages over their English!
counterparts, according to Simp
son. "A place like Oxford requires 1
a much higher degree of special-;
ization than an American uni
versity. It seems to me that j
specialization starts too early in
England, English colleges might
learn something from American
general education."
Simpson also believes that
American schools are more
a Ie r t . "American universities I
have a quick response to the
national need and world
events," he said. While at Chi
cago we're constantly sensitive

, to the need for change and per
haps sometimes too quick to
I change, Oxford is damned resis
tant to any change at all."
In an-swer to the thorny ques
! tion, "Does England or America
j have more educational freedom?"
I Simpson answered, "In any de-
J bate with an Englishman on this
I subject, 1 think an American will
I be under the disadvantage of hav
ing to admit that the academic
I freedom which both value i t s less
I secure here than there.
t "There are no legislative snoop
| ers in England, no loyalty pro
j eeedings, no campaigns by in
dignant citizens, no agitated dis
! cussions of whether communists
I have a right to teach: no sense,
j in short, that academic freedom is
j a public issue at all. . . he
| said.
Simpson explained the Amer
ican problem from the stand
point of an Knglish observer:
"it is the price you pay for hav
ing allowed the search for
equality to compromise liberty
... DeToequeville remarked
that liberty of opinion was far
less secure in a Jacksonian de
mocracy than in aristocratic
Europe. The average man of
those days felt himself to be a
competent judge of almost any
question, and his descendant
today — the average parent,
alumnus, or legislator—is liable
to think himself a fit judge of
what is taught or studied in the
schools."
Simpson goes on to -say that no
| such idea would . normally enter
the minds of their English, coun
terparts, and if proposed to them
they would instinctively feel that
| such an attitude was impertinent
; and dangerous.
"it is the price you pay for hav
j ing built your history on the as
j similation of immigrants," Simp
son continued. "A sen-se of unity
1 is a datum of English history; but
j here one finds Americans acting
as if it was a goal to be achieved.
"Only a people engaged in the
perpetual manufacture of a
nationality could have coined
such a concept as 'unAinerican'
. . . Freedom is a function of
j security . . . No one sleeps the
worse for knowing that there is
a Communist or two with aca
demic positions in Oxford and
Cambridge," Simpson stated.

was, you write a 12 to 19 page

He said that the merit of such
a system is the opportunity the
student has to receive personal
attention from an instructor. "One 1
also develops a pretty good Eng-!
lish style from writing a sub-!
stantial essay every week," Simp
son said. As proof, he added that 1
he sees a marked difference be
tween the products of English j
and American schools in their
"fluency on paper."
Simpson also commented on
the reading problem. He said
that it has puzzled him whether
or not students whose courses
are based on required reading
lists would ever have time to
read and discover books out
side their courses.
American universities, on Ihe<
other hand, do have some ad
vantages over their English!
counterparts, according to Simp
son. "A place like Oxford requires 1
a much higher degree of special-;
ization than an American uni
versity. It seems to me that j
specialization starts too early in
England, English colleges might
learn something from American
general education."
Simpson also believes that
American schools are more
a Ie r t . "American universities I
have a quick response to the
national need and world
events," he said. While at Chi
cago we're constantly sensitive

, to the need for change and per
haps sometimes too quick to
I change, Oxford is damned resis
tant to any change at all."
In an-swer to the thorny ques

j have more educational freedom?"
I Simpson answered, "In any de-
J bate with an Englishman on this

I be under the disadvantage of hav

I freedom which both value i t s less
I secure here than there.

Simpson explained the Amer
ican problem from the stand
point of an Knglish observer:
"it is the price you pay for hav
ing allowed the search for
equality to compromise liberty
... DeToequeville remarked
that liberty of opinion was far
less secure in a Jacksonian de
mocracy than in aristocratic
Europe. The average man of
those days felt himself to be a
competent judge of almost any
question, and his descendant
today — the average parent,
alumnus, or legislator—is liable
to think himself a fit judge of
what is taught or studied in the
schools."
Simpson goes on to -say that no
| such idea would . normally enter
the minds of their English, coun
terparts, and if proposed to them
they would instinctively feel that
| such an attitude was impertinent
; and dangerous.
"it is the price you pay for hav

j similation of immigrants," Simp

1 is a datum of English history; but

counterparts, according to Simp
son. "A place like Oxford requires 1
a much higher degree of special-;
ization than an American uni
versity. It seems to me that j
specialization starts too early in
England, English colleges might
learn something from American
general education."
Simpson also believes that
American schools are more
a Ie r t . "American universities I
have a quick response to the
national need and world
events," he said. While at Chi
cago we're constantly sensitive

, to the need for change and per
haps sometimes too quick to
I change, Oxford is damned resis
tant to any change at all."
In an-swer to the thorny ques
! tion, "Does England or America
j have more educational freedom?"
I Simpson answered, "In any de-
J bate with an Englishman on this
I subject, 1 think an American will
I be under the disadvantage of hav
ing to admit that the academic
I freedom which both value i t s less
I secure here than there.
t "There are no legislative snoop
| ers in England, no loyalty pro
j eeedings, no campaigns by in
dignant citizens, no agitated dis
! cussions of whether communists
I have a right to teach: no sense,
j in short, that academic freedom is
j a public issue at all. . . he
| said.
Simpson explained the Amer
ican problem from the stand
point of an Knglish observer:
"it is the price you pay for hav
ing allowed the search for
equality to compromise liberty
... DeToequeville remarked
that liberty of opinion was far
less secure in a Jacksonian de
mocracy than in aristocratic
Europe. The average man of
those days felt himself to be a
competent judge of almost any
question, and his descendant
today — the average parent,
alumnus, or legislator—is liable
to think himself a fit judge of
what is taught or studied in the
schools."
Simpson goes on to -say that no
| such idea would . normally enter
the minds of their English, coun
terparts, and if proposed to them
they would instinctively feel that
| such an attitude was impertinent
; and dangerous.
"it is the price you pay for hav
j ing built your history on the as
j similation of immigrants," Simp
son continued. "A sen-se of unity
1 is a datum of English history; but
j here one finds Americans acting
as if it was a goal to be achieved.
"Only a people engaged in the
perpetual manufacture of a
nationality could have coined
such a concept as 'unAinerican'
. . . Freedom is a function of
j security . . . No one sleeps the
worse for knowing that there is
a Communist or two with aca
demic positions in Oxford and
Cambridge," Simpson stated.
Quite frequently, this pertinent,
question arises, "Which country [
has the better educational system, I
England or America?" Alan Simp- •
son, professor of English history!
at the University of Chicago and j
a graduate of Oxford University, (
gave his views on the matter in j
a recent issue of the Chicago
Maroon, the university's news-1
paper.
Simpson first of all pointed to
the tutorial system in England as :
opposed to the more regimented |
instructional system in the U.S. i
The student meets with his tutor I
weekly, alone or with one or two |
other students.
The tutor assigns an essay
topic for the following week and
then the present week's paper
is read and analyzed. "If you're
taking your work seriously as. I
was, you write a 12 to 19 page
paper every week," stated Simp
son.
He said that the merit of such
a system is the opportunity the
student has to receive personal
attention from an instructor. "One 1
also develops a pretty good Eng-!
lish style from writing a sub-!
stantial essay every week," Simp
son said. As proof, he added that 1
he sees a marked difference be
tween the products of English j
and American schools in their
"fluency on paper."
Simpson also commented on
the reading problem. He said
that it has puzzled him whether
or not students whose courses
are based on required reading
lists would ever have time to
read and discover books out
side their courses.
