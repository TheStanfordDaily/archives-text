Bicycles
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clear up a few
misconceptions about the Legis
lature's new program on bicycles.
We don't want the hike riders
to feel that we are just trying
to make things hard for them
'1 he majority of the members on
the committee working on this
problem ride bicycles, so their
decisions should not have been
too basied. We merely want bike
riders to take slightly different
routes than they have been used
to.
Instead of riding through Tnner

Quad, and parking there, we want
to encourage riding down 1 lie ac
cess drives, and parking behind
classrooms, rather than in front.
This merely cuts out a few short
cuts, and may cause a delay of a
minute or two.
Of course, we have no way to
enforce this rule directly on stu
dents. We hope that all the hike
riders will cooperate, and the few
that don't will find themselves so
conspicuous that public opinion
alone will enforce this rule.
