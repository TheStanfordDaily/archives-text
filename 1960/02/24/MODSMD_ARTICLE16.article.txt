# Kennedy's Appearance Caused Stir
## 
### Marilyn Mooro 
Senator Jack Kennedy's recent
Stanford appearance created a
stir in the Republican National
Committe headquarters, it was
I learned last Saturday in the
Washington, D.C., office.
Both Sen. Thrust on B. Morton,
national committee chairman, and
his assistant, Dr. Cornelius P. Col
ter. mentioned the talk, noting
the large number of persons
turned away. Cotter, associate
professor of political science cur
rently on leave from Stanford,
I said he had sent The Daily cover
age of Kennedy's visit to Vice
1 President Richard Nixon.
"Campus appearances are val
uable both for increased publicity
[ and for reaching a non-partisan
i audience,", said Morton. "The
candidate appears in the name
of the university, though he is ac
tually sponsored by an organiza
| tion."
Third Factor
A third factor, the appeal to
i student voters, is also considered!
important.
Visits to college and univer
sities are also part of Presidential
hopeful Nixon's campaign, said
Morton. A recent talk at the Uni
! versity of Florida had an audi
ence of 12,000.
An increased appeal to college
; faculty members is included in
the Republican campaign. This is
being headed by Cotter who has
been with the Republican Na
tional Committee since December,
! 1958, and who plans to return to
I Stanford next December.
Consideration of the "intellec
; tual" as the opinion former who
guides the "average voter" is the
philosophy behind ihe new party
appeal, a drive which has no coun
terpart in the Democratic party.
Average Voter
"The 'intellectual' helps estab
lish a climate of ideas and thought
which guide the average voter,"
I said Cotter. "Though no polls have
been taken, tKe 'egghead' is al
legedly a Democrat, and his stere
otype of the Republican has to I
i be broken down."
According to Cotter, there is a
trend that the "egghead" is be
| coming more conservative.
The four cornerstones of the
Republican national campaign are
organization, issues, candidates
j and finances.
Increased possibilities for or- !
: ganization make up for the lack
of excitement caused by having a
j decided presidential candidate,
said Morton.
Additional effort is especially \
j evident at the Congressional
level, an area which would have j
remained quite subordinate to any |
contest over a presidential nomi- ■
nee.
Second Cornerstone
The second cornerstone, issues,
involves both Congress and Ihe
: states, while the philosophy be-
I hind "candidates" is simply "to
: recruit the best man or woman i
available."
The fourth cornerstone, fi- ■
nances, was laid by ihe $100-plate i
dinners held Jan. 27 at 80 loca-!
tions across the nation.
Contrary to views expressed j
; by Eugene C, Brenner, chairman j
of the San Mateo County United '
Republican Finance Committee 1
! (The Daily, Feb. 11), Morton
thinks such dinners can be a good
! proposition and will continue.
They will, however, take second
place in the Republican campaign
to appeals to more individuals for
I smaller contributions.

: recruit the best man or woman i
available."
The fourth cornerstone, fi- ■
nances, was laid by ihe $100-plate i
dinners held Jan. 27 at 80 loca-!
tions across the nation.
Contrary to views expressed j
; by Eugene C, Brenner, chairman j
of the San Mateo County United '
Republican Finance Committee 1
! (The Daily, Feb. 11), Morton
thinks such dinners can be a good
! proposition and will continue.
They will, however, take second
place in the Republican campaign
to appeals to more individuals for
I smaller contributions.
Senator Jack Kennedy's recent
Stanford appearance created a
stir in the Republican National
Committe headquarters, it was
I learned last Saturday in the
Washington, D.C., office.
Both Sen. Thrust on B. Morton,
national committee chairman, and
his assistant, Dr. Cornelius P. Col
ter. mentioned the talk, noting
the large number of persons
turned away. Cotter, associate
professor of political science cur
rently on leave from Stanford,
I said he had sent The Daily cover
age of Kennedy's visit to Vice
1 President Richard Nixon.
"Campus appearances are val
uable both for increased publicity
[ and for reaching a non-partisan
i audience,", said Morton. "The
candidate appears in the name
of the university, though he is ac
tually sponsored by an organiza
| tion."
Third Factor
A third factor, the appeal to
i student voters, is also considered!
important.
Visits to college and univer
sities are also part of Presidential
hopeful Nixon's campaign, said
Morton. A recent talk at the Uni
! versity of Florida had an audi
ence of 12,000.
An increased appeal to college
; faculty members is included in
the Republican campaign. This is
being headed by Cotter who has
been with the Republican Na
tional Committee since December,
! 1958, and who plans to return to
I Stanford next December.
Consideration of the "intellec
; tual" as the opinion former who
guides the "average voter" is the
philosophy behind ihe new party
appeal, a drive which has no coun
terpart in the Democratic party.
Average Voter
"The 'intellectual' helps estab
lish a climate of ideas and thought
which guide the average voter,"
I said Cotter. "Though no polls have
been taken, tKe 'egghead' is al
legedly a Democrat, and his stere
otype of the Republican has to I
i be broken down."
According to Cotter, there is a
trend that the "egghead" is be
| coming more conservative.
The four cornerstones of the
Republican national campaign are
organization, issues, candidates
j and finances.
Increased possibilities for or- !
: ganization make up for the lack
of excitement caused by having a
j decided presidential candidate,
said Morton.
Additional effort is especially \
j evident at the Congressional
level, an area which would have j
remained quite subordinate to any |
contest over a presidential nomi- ■
nee.
Second Cornerstone
The second cornerstone, issues,
involves both Congress and Ihe
: states, while the philosophy be-
I hind "candidates" is simply "to
: recruit the best man or woman i
available."
