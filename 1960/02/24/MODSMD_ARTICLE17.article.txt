## Watkin's Speech 
### 
... I am here today only as a t
layman like each of you, only as j
a voting citizen such as you are |
or will be and with only the claim
u po ny o u r attention that any |
adult voice might have. . . .
. . . Once in a while but only
once in a while, history, it seems
to me, presents a leader of a
government or a whole peoplej
with a clear voice of public pol- :
icy. . . .
. . . For it is more than an
opinion of mine that the tide is
rising. The tide is rising this
is an opinion and no legislative
brooms will sweep it back. . . . I
. . . Now lot me shift the focus. |
It is two years ago this week thai j
a 19-year-old Stanford sophomore
a gentle, well-behaved, a truly j
good lad - suddenly and for no j
reason whatsoever shot and killed
the little girl across the street in ;
a wild, insensate protest against j
life and adolescence. . . .
Stricken Campus
... A few days afterward on j
28 February the Daily published
for the stricken campus a letter
from John D. Black, director of ,
the Counseling & Testing Center. I
'. . . There are many messages i
in the event. For one thing, . . .
self - d o u b t s (or suspicions of j
others) are . . . mostly unwar
ranted. Most of us have achieved
more effective mastery over our j
impulses. Most of us do not con- i
fuse fantasy with reality because j
we have enough meaningful ties
with other human beings that it !
is easy to differentiate the two. I
'But we could have more (such j
ties). In this universal struggle
to be human by managing our
primitive impulses appropriately,
we could help ourselves and each
other more. . . .'
. . . My second point is differ
ent. Here it would emphasize and j
acclaim the contrast by the pub
lic reaction to the tragedy of two I
years back and its reaction to a
similar t r a g e d y which over
whelmed the University of Chi
cago community 36 years ago this
spring.
Apprehension
. . . Two years ago therefore
I was sick with apprehension lest
the worst repeat itself. But it
didn't. Instead, our appalling tra- I
gedy was received by the fami
lies, by the University, by the
public with sorrow, but with sym
pathy and understanding . . .
. . . When the great defense j
lawyer in the case, Clarence Dar-j
row, convinced the judge there
was no jury- that his youthful
clients should not hang, criminal
law took a great step forward.
. . . The real issue, it seems to
me, is the question whether even
a man who acts like a rat should
be treated like a rat or whether,
because we, the rest of us, are
men we are bound to treat him
like a man. . . .
... At this point we come to
one of the two objections to capi
tal punishment which I dare to
entertain even without profes- j
sional competence in law or soci- ]
ology. And that objection is the |
baleful effect upon society which
capital punishment has as any
man may observe.
Same Mercy
. . . Said Darrow more than a
generation ago, in speaking of the ;
crime committed by his clients: j
'What is the |prosecution's| idea!
of justice? He says to this court, j
give them the same mercy they j
gave their |victim|. If the state
in which I live is not kinder, more |
humane, more considerate, more
intelligent, than the mad act of
these two boys, I am sorry that
I have lived so long.' . . .
. . . My first objection, then, is
the effect upon society. My sec
ond comes closer to my own spe
cialty and here perhaps I stand

| on firmer ground. Frankly T am
jealous for the fair name of the
| United States in tho world com
munity. . . .
I ... Of the several hun d red
! killers caught in a year, eight or
ten are executed. Why not most?
j Because you have to be very
nearly friendless or commit an
extraordinarily horrible homicide j
to get the gas chamber. . . .
'This is a mockery of justice!
unbecoming a civilized and a per
ceptive people. . . .
Life for a Life
. . . The choice before us is j
j whether we shall add California,
and hopefully the United States,
I to the roll of those who no longer
demand 'a life for a life' as once
i they demanded b 1 in d in g and
I maiming in accordance with the
I law.
Or whether we shall keep this
vestige of our own primitive past
and with it the scorn of the world
i and of God. . . .
: ... Let me close with the fol
lowing quotations: tlie first from
Clarence Darrow's magnificent
I summary, the second from the
' familiar court scene in the 'Mer
! chant of V en i c e' both only
opinions: . . .
i am pleading for life, under
standing charity, kindness and for
the infinite mercy that considers
all. I am pleading that we over
come cruelty with kindness and
hatred with love. Our honor
stands between the past and the
: future.
. I am pleading for the fu
ture. I am pleading for a time
! when wo can learn by reason and
j judgment and understanding and
faith that all life is worth saving
and that mercy is the highest at -:
tribute of man.
For and here I turn to the
lawyer's appeal in Shakespeare,
'The quality of mercy is not
strain'd.
It droppeth as the gentle rain
from heaven
Upon the place beneath. It is
twice blest:
| It blesseth him that giveth and
him that takes. . . .
. . . And that same prayer doth
teach us all to render Deeds
of mercy. I have spoke thus
much to mitigate the jus
tice of thy plea.'

from John D. Black, director of ,
the Counseling & Testing Center. I
'. . . There are many messages i
in the event. For one thing, . . .
self - d o u b t s (or suspicions of j
others) are . . . mostly unwar
ranted. Most of us have achieved
more effective mastery over our j
impulses. Most of us do not con- i
fuse fantasy with reality because j
we have enough meaningful ties
with other human beings that it !
is easy to differentiate the two. I
'But we could have more (such j
ties). In this universal struggle
to be human by managing our
primitive impulses appropriately,
we could help ourselves and each
other more. . . .'
. . . My second point is differ
ent. Here it would emphasize and j
acclaim the contrast by the pub
lic reaction to the tragedy of two I
years back and its reaction to a
similar t r a g e d y which over
whelmed the University of Chi
cago community 36 years ago this
spring.
Apprehension
. . . Two years ago therefore
I was sick with apprehension lest
the worst repeat itself. But it
didn't. Instead, our appalling tra- I
gedy was received by the fami
lies, by the University, by the
public with sorrow, but with sym
pathy and understanding . . .
. . . When the great defense j
lawyer in the case, Clarence Dar-j
row, convinced the judge there
was no jury- that his youthful
clients should not hang, criminal
law took a great step forward.
. . . The real issue, it seems to
me, is the question whether even
a man who acts like a rat should
be treated like a rat or whether,
because we, the rest of us, are
men we are bound to treat him
like a man. . . .
... At this point we come to
one of the two objections to capi
tal punishment which I dare to
entertain even without profes- j
sional competence in law or soci- ]
ology. And that objection is the |
baleful effect upon society which
capital punishment has as any
man may observe.
Same Mercy
. . . Said Darrow more than a
generation ago, in speaking of the ;
crime committed by his clients: j
'What is the |prosecution's| idea!
of justice? He says to this court, j
give them the same mercy they j
gave their |victim|. If the state
in which I live is not kinder, more |
humane, more considerate, more
intelligent, than the mad act of
these two boys, I am sorry that
I have lived so long.' . . .
. . . My first objection, then, is
the effect upon society. My sec
ond comes closer to my own spe
cialty and here perhaps I stand

| on firmer ground. Frankly T am
jealous for the fair name of the
| United States in tho world com
munity. . . .
I ... Of the several hun d red
! killers caught in a year, eight or
ten are executed. Why not most?
j Because you have to be very
nearly friendless or commit an
extraordinarily horrible homicide j
to get the gas chamber. . . .
'This is a mockery of justice!
unbecoming a civilized and a per
ceptive people. . . .
Life for a Life
. . . The choice before us is j
j whether we shall add California,
and hopefully the United States,
I to the roll of those who no longer
demand 'a life for a life' as once
i they demanded b 1 in d in g and
I maiming in accordance with the
I law.
Or whether we shall keep this
vestige of our own primitive past
and with it the scorn of the world
i and of God. . . .
: ... Let me close with the fol
lowing quotations: tlie first from
Clarence Darrow's magnificent
I summary, the second from the
' familiar court scene in the 'Mer
! chant of V en i c e' both only
opinions: . . .
i am pleading for life, under
standing charity, kindness and for
the infinite mercy that considers
all. I am pleading that we over
come cruelty with kindness and
hatred with love. Our honor
stands between the past and the
: future.
. I am pleading for the fu
ture. I am pleading for a time
! when wo can learn by reason and
j judgment and understanding and
faith that all life is worth saving
and that mercy is the highest at -:
tribute of man.
For and here I turn to the
lawyer's appeal in Shakespeare,
'The quality of mercy is not
strain'd.
It droppeth as the gentle rain
from heaven
Upon the place beneath. It is
twice blest:
| It blesseth him that giveth and
him that takes. . . .
. . . And that same prayer doth
teach us all to render Deeds
of mercy. I have spoke thus
much to mitigate the jus
tice of thy plea.'
... I am here today only as a t
layman like each of you, only as j
a voting citizen such as you are |
or will be and with only the claim
u po ny o u r attention that any |
adult voice might have. . . .
. . . Once in a while but only
once in a while, history, it seems
to me, presents a leader of a
government or a whole peoplej
with a clear voice of public pol- :
icy. . . .
. . . For it is more than an
opinion of mine that the tide is
rising. The tide is rising this
is an opinion and no legislative
brooms will sweep it back. . . . I
. . . Now lot me shift the focus. |
It is two years ago this week thai j

the worst repeat itself. But it
didn't. Instead, our appalling tra- I
gedy was received by the fami

public with sorrow, but with sym
pathy and understanding . . .
. . . When the great defense j
lawyer in the case, Clarence Dar-j
row, convinced the judge there
was no jury- that his youthful
clients should not hang, criminal
law took a great step forward.
. . . The real issue, it seems to
me, is the question whether even
a man who acts like a rat should
be treated like a rat or whether,
because we, the rest of us, are
men we are bound to treat him
like a man. . . .
... At this point we come to
one of the two objections to capi
tal punishment which I dare to
entertain even without profes- j
sional competence in law or soci- ]

baleful effect upon society which
capital punishment has as any
man may observe.
Same Mercy
. . . Said Darrow more than a
generation ago, in speaking of the ;
crime committed by his clients: j
'What is the |prosecution's| idea!
of justice? He says to this court, j
give them the same mercy they j
gave their |victim|. If the state
in which I live is not kinder, more |
humane, more considerate, more
intelligent, than the mad act of
these two boys, I am sorry that
I have lived so long.' . . .
. . . My first objection, then, is
the effect upon society. My sec
ond comes closer to my own spe
cialty and here perhaps I stand

| on firmer ground. Frankly T am
jealous for the fair name of the
| United States in tho world com
munity. . . .
I ... Of the several hun d red
! killers caught in a year, eight or
ten are executed. Why not most?
j Because you have to be very
nearly friendless or commit an
extraordinarily horrible homicide j
to get the gas chamber. . . .
'This is a mockery of justice!
unbecoming a civilized and a per
ceptive people. . . .
Life for a Life
. . . The choice before us is j
j whether we shall add California,
and hopefully the United States,
I to the roll of those who no longer
demand 'a life for a life' as once
i they demanded b 1 in d in g and
I maiming in accordance with the
I law.
Or whether we shall keep this
vestige of our own primitive past
and with it the scorn of the world
i and of God. . . .
: ... Let me close with the fol
lowing quotations: tlie first from
Clarence Darrow's magnificent
I summary, the second from the
' familiar court scene in the 'Mer
! chant of V en i c e' both only
opinions: . . .
i am pleading for life, under
standing charity, kindness and for
the infinite mercy that considers
all. I am pleading that we over
come cruelty with kindness and
hatred with love. Our honor
stands between the past and the
: future.
. I am pleading for the fu
ture. I am pleading for a time
! when wo can learn by reason and
j judgment and understanding and
faith that all life is worth saving
and that mercy is the highest at -:
tribute of man.
For and here I turn to the
lawyer's appeal in Shakespeare,
'The quality of mercy is not
strain'd.
It droppeth as the gentle rain
from heaven
Upon the place beneath. It is
twice blest:
| It blesseth him that giveth and
him that takes. . . .
. . . And that same prayer doth
teach us all to render Deeds
of mercy. I have spoke thus
much to mitigate the jus
tice of thy plea.'

u po ny o u r attention that any |
adult voice might have. . . .
. . . Once in a while but only
once in a while, history, it seems
to me, presents a leader of a
government or a whole peoplej
with a clear voice of public pol- :
icy. . . .

and hopefully the United States,

demand 'a life for a life' as once
i they demanded b 1 in d in g and

I summary, the second from the
' familiar court scene in the 'Mer

opinions: . . .
i am pleading for life, under
standing charity, kindness and for
the infinite mercy that considers
all. I am pleading that we over
come cruelty with kindness and
hatred with love. Our honor
stands between the past and the
: future.
. I am pleading for the fu
ture. I am pleading for a time
! when wo can learn by reason and
j judgment and understanding and
faith that all life is worth saving
and that mercy is the highest at -:
tribute of man.
For and here I turn to the
lawyer's appeal in Shakespeare,
'The quality of mercy is not
strain'd.
It droppeth as the gentle rain
from heaven
Upon the place beneath. It is
twice blest:
| It blesseth him that giveth and
him that takes. . . .
. . . And that same prayer doth
teach us all to render Deeds
of mercy. I have spoke thus
much to mitigate the jus
tice of thy plea.'
... I am here today only as a t
layman like each of you, only as j
a voting citizen such as you are |
or will be and with only the claim
u po ny o u r attention that any |
adult voice might have. . . .
. . . Once in a while but only
once in a while, history, it seems
to me, presents a leader of a
government or a whole peoplej
with a clear voice of public pol- :
icy. . . .
. . . For it is more than an
opinion of mine that the tide is
rising. The tide is rising this
is an opinion and no legislative
brooms will sweep it back. . . . I
. . . Now lot me shift the focus. |
It is two years ago this week thai j
a 19-year-old Stanford sophomore
a gentle, well-behaved, a truly j
good lad - suddenly and for no j
reason whatsoever shot and killed
the little girl across the street in ;
a wild, insensate protest against j
life and adolescence. . . .
Stricken Campus
... A few days afterward on j
28 February the Daily published
for the stricken campus a letter
from John D. Black, director of ,
the Counseling & Testing Center. I
'. . . There are many messages i
in the event. For one thing, . . .
self - d o u b t s (or suspicions of j
others) are . . . mostly unwar
ranted. Most of us have achieved
more effective mastery over our j
impulses. Most of us do not con- i
fuse fantasy with reality because j
we have enough meaningful ties
with other human beings that it !
is easy to differentiate the two. I
'But we could have more (such j
ties). In this universal struggle
to be human by managing our
primitive impulses appropriately,
we could help ourselves and each
other more. . . .'
. . . My second point is differ
ent. Here it would emphasize and j
acclaim the contrast by the pub
lic reaction to the tragedy of two I
years back and its reaction to a
similar t r a g e d y which over
whelmed the University of Chi
cago community 36 years ago this
spring.
Apprehension
. . . Two years ago therefore
I was sick with apprehension lest
the worst repeat itself. But it
didn't. Instead, our appalling tra- I
gedy was received by the fami
lies, by the University, by the
public with sorrow, but with sym
pathy and understanding . . .
. . . When the great defense j
lawyer in the case, Clarence Dar-j
row, convinced the judge there
was no jury- that his youthful
clients should not hang, criminal
law took a great step forward.
. . . The real issue, it seems to
me, is the question whether even
a man who acts like a rat should
be treated like a rat or whether,
because we, the rest of us, are
men we are bound to treat him
like a man. . . .
... At this point we come to
one of the two objections to capi
tal punishment which I dare to
entertain even without profes- j
sional competence in law or soci- ]
ology. And that objection is the |
baleful effect upon society which
capital punishment has as any
man may observe.
Same Mercy
. . . Said Darrow more than a
generation ago, in speaking of the ;
crime committed by his clients: j
'What is the |prosecution's| idea!
of justice? He says to this court, j
give them the same mercy they j
gave their |victim|. If the state
in which I live is not kinder, more |
humane, more considerate, more
intelligent, than the mad act of
these two boys, I am sorry that
I have lived so long.' . . .
