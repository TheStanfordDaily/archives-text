Varsity baseball season officially arrives Friday.
Yes, it is getting near finals, isn't it?
If this news (that baseball season is here) has no more effect
oil the student public than it has in the past few years, it promises
to bo a lonely year at the Sunken Diamond. And it shouldn't be
that way.
Baseball, the so-called national past time, just isn't so when it

comes to the collegiate level; or
at least the collegiate level
around here. Despite the fact
that West Coast, and California
in particular, collegiate baseball
ranks as just about the nation's
best, the local public is apparent
ly unimpressed and uninterested
or nonbelieving.
Stanford's baseball team played
some real thrillers lasl year, un
beknownst to most of the burgh
ers. Proportionately, the Tribe
just about played more cliff
hangers than the Giants to the
north, although to believe the SF
press, anything short of a 10-
run lead in the first inning con
stitutes a cliff-hanger.
This year we may even be able
to beat Southern Cal.
The T r o j a 11 s , unfortunately
were sort of giants themselves,
among boys, last season. They
were beatable (Santa Clara man
aged it one afternoon, only to lose
ihe second game of that double
header, 19-3). However, they were

also the closest thing to a professional team that could be found
anywhere in collegiate athletics. "Professional is meant from the
quality standpoint, hut I imagine arguments could be made for
the other standpoint, too.
The Indians this year promise to be hustling fast and strong,
but a little on the small side. This in contrast to USC, who last year
was sending out the likes of Bill Tliom (6-2), Johnny Werlias i6-3>,
I,en C.abrielson (6-4) and John McLane (6-2); not to mention Muscle
Beach Jim Hanna t6-8) who supposedly was on the bench somewhere.
Solid Team Coming Up
At any rate, with Mike Magee, Jim Burk, Lee Moench, Hall Scliutz
inann and Jay Winter back this year to set the foundation for ihe
Card baseballers, it could be an interesting spring. All but Moench
were full-time regulars last season.
But Moench wound up the Tribe's top hitter. A .245 hitter as a
freshman two years ago, Lee began murdering the ball for the
Braves early in the year . . . moved up to the varsity as an outfield
er and continued his torrid hitting. A first baseman by trade, Lee
appears to have his old job nailed down this season.
Magee led most of last season Tribe hitting stats.
Schut/.mann. shortstop last year, is being shifted to the outfield
to fill the graduation void out there. Another reserve infielder,
Mike Filice. is also making the change.
They'll be joined out there by junior John Hurlbut, a reserve
last year whose hitting so far in intrasquad games has been pretty
imposing.
The infield is sort of like loaded. Moencli, Magee and Burk are
lop veterans; then there is the torrid-hitting infield from last year's
freshman squad. Two of them. Pete Yerdurmen and Skip Lawrence,
clobbered home runs for the Braves Monday against Coalinga JC.
There is no want of size on the pitching staff, with veterans
like Karl Kussell, Terry Liiulemaii and Warren Nelson on hand.
Also back is lefty Marv Mecklenberg, who threw a one-hitter at
UCLA last season. Two sophomores, quarterback Jim Smith and
lefty Mark Miller should also be of assistance.
This deep and experienced mound staff is one of the major
things to indicate that the Tribe will be tough this season. Smith
started the season off in fine shape Monday when he pitched five
innings against Coalinga, allowed but two hits and struck out eight.
All six will see action this week. Friday against Cal Pofy, Kus
sell, Miller and Nelson will split the duties; Saturday, against rug
ged Sail Jose State, Mecklenberg, Smith and Lindeman will work.
The Sunken Diamond is over between the Stadium and the
football practice field. It's really a lovely green layout. Stanford
has a baseball team that plays there and any sort of interest may
be appreciated.

inann and Jay Winter back this year to set the foundation for ihe
Card baseballers, it could be an interesting spring. All but Moench
were full-time regulars last season.
But Moench wound up the Tribe's top hitter. A .245 hitter as a
freshman two years ago, Lee began murdering the ball for the
Braves early in the year . . . moved up to the varsity as an outfield
er and continued his torrid hitting. A first baseman by trade, Lee
appears to have his old job nailed down this season.
Magee led most of last season Tribe hitting stats.
Schut/.mann. shortstop last year, is being shifted to the outfield
to fill the graduation void out there. Another reserve infielder,
Mike Filice. is also making the change.
They'll be joined out there by junior John Hurlbut, a reserve
last year whose hitting so far in intrasquad games has been pretty
imposing.
The infield is sort of like loaded. Moencli, Magee and Burk are
lop veterans; then there is the torrid-hitting infield from last year's
freshman squad. Two of them. Pete Yerdurmen and Skip Lawrence,
clobbered home runs for the Braves Monday against Coalinga JC.
There is no want of size on the pitching staff, with veterans
like Karl Kussell, Terry Liiulemaii and Warren Nelson on hand.
Also back is lefty Marv Mecklenberg, who threw a one-hitter at
UCLA last season. Two sophomores, quarterback Jim Smith and
lefty Mark Miller should also be of assistance.
This deep and experienced mound staff is one of the major
things to indicate that the Tribe will be tough this season. Smith
started the season off in fine shape Monday when he pitched five
innings against Coalinga, allowed but two hits and struck out eight.
All six will see action this week. Friday against Cal Pofy, Kus
sell, Miller and Nelson will split the duties; Saturday, against rug
ged Sail Jose State, Mecklenberg, Smith and Lindeman will work.
The Sunken Diamond is over between the Stadium and the
football practice field. It's really a lovely green layout. Stanford
has a baseball team that plays there and any sort of interest may
be appreciated.

Varsity baseball season officially arrives Friday.
Yes, it is getting near finals, isn't it?
If this news (that baseball season is here) has no more effect
oil the student public than it has in the past few years, it promises
to bo a lonely year at the Sunken Diamond. And it shouldn't be
that way.
Baseball, the so-called national past time, just isn't so when it

comes to the collegiate level; or
at least the collegiate level
around here. Despite the fact
that West Coast, and California
in particular, collegiate baseball
ranks as just about the nation's
best, the local public is apparent
ly unimpressed and uninterested
or nonbelieving.
Stanford's baseball team played
some real thrillers lasl year, un
beknownst to most of the burgh
ers. Proportionately, the Tribe
just about played more cliff
hangers than the Giants to the
north, although to believe the SF
press, anything short of a 10-
run lead in the first inning con
stitutes a cliff-hanger.
This year we may even be able
to beat Southern Cal.
The T r o j a 11 s , unfortunately
were sort of giants themselves,
among boys, last season. They
were beatable (Santa Clara man
aged it one afternoon, only to lose
ihe second game of that double
header, 19-3). However, they were

also the closest thing to a professional team that could be found
anywhere in collegiate athletics. "Professional is meant from the
quality standpoint, hut I imagine arguments could be made for
the other standpoint, too.
The Indians this year promise to be hustling fast and strong,
but a little on the small side. This in contrast to USC, who last year
was sending out the likes of Bill Tliom (6-2), Johnny Werlias i6-3>,
I,en C.abrielson (6-4) and John McLane (6-2); not to mention Muscle
Beach Jim Hanna t6-8) who supposedly was on the bench somewhere.

Varsity baseball season officially arrives Friday.
Yes, it is getting near finals, isn't it?
If this news (that baseball season is here) has no more effect
oil the student public than it has in the past few years, it promises
to bo a lonely year at the Sunken Diamond. And it shouldn't be
that way.
Baseball, the so-called national past time, just isn't so when it

comes to the collegiate level; or
at least the collegiate level
around here. Despite the fact
that West Coast, and California
in particular, collegiate baseball
ranks as just about the nation's
best, the local public is apparent
ly unimpressed and uninterested
or nonbelieving.
Stanford's baseball team played
some real thrillers lasl year, un
beknownst to most of the burgh
ers. Proportionately, the Tribe
just about played more cliff
hangers than the Giants to the
north, although to believe the SF
press, anything short of a 10-
run lead in the first inning con
stitutes a cliff-hanger.
This year we may even be able
to beat Southern Cal.
The T r o j a 11 s , unfortunately
were sort of giants themselves,
among boys, last season. They
were beatable (Santa Clara man
aged it one afternoon, only to lose
ihe second game of that double
header, 19-3). However, they were

also the closest thing to a professional team that could be found
anywhere in collegiate athletics. "Professional is meant from the
quality standpoint, hut I imagine arguments could be made for
the other standpoint, too.
The Indians this year promise to be hustling fast and strong,
but a little on the small side. This in contrast to USC, who last year
was sending out the likes of Bill Tliom (6-2), Johnny Werlias i6-3>,
I,en C.abrielson (6-4) and John McLane (6-2); not to mention Muscle
Beach Jim Hanna t6-8) who supposedly was on the bench somewhere.
Solid Team Coming Up
At any rate, with Mike Magee, Jim Burk, Lee Moench, Hall Scliutz
inann and Jay Winter back this year to set the foundation for ihe
Card baseballers, it could be an interesting spring. All but Moench
were full-time regulars last season.
But Moench wound up the Tribe's top hitter. A .245 hitter as a
freshman two years ago, Lee began murdering the ball for the
Braves early in the year . . . moved up to the varsity as an outfield
er and continued his torrid hitting. A first baseman by trade, Lee
appears to have his old job nailed down this season.
Magee led most of last season Tribe hitting stats.
Schut/.mann. shortstop last year, is being shifted to the outfield
to fill the graduation void out there. Another reserve infielder,
Mike Filice. is also making the change.
They'll be joined out there by junior John Hurlbut, a reserve
last year whose hitting so far in intrasquad games has been pretty
imposing.
The infield is sort of like loaded. Moencli, Magee and Burk are
lop veterans; then there is the torrid-hitting infield from last year's
freshman squad. Two of them. Pete Yerdurmen and Skip Lawrence,
clobbered home runs for the Braves Monday against Coalinga JC.
There is no want of size on the pitching staff, with veterans
like Karl Kussell, Terry Liiulemaii and Warren Nelson on hand.
Also back is lefty Marv Mecklenberg, who threw a one-hitter at
UCLA last season. Two sophomores, quarterback Jim Smith and
lefty Mark Miller should also be of assistance.
This deep and experienced mound staff is one of the major
things to indicate that the Tribe will be tough this season. Smith
started the season off in fine shape Monday when he pitched five
innings against Coalinga, allowed but two hits and struck out eight.
All six will see action this week. Friday against Cal Pofy, Kus
sell, Miller and Nelson will split the duties; Saturday, against rug
ged Sail Jose State, Mecklenberg, Smith and Lindeman will work.
The Sunken Diamond is over between the Stadium and the
football practice field. It's really a lovely green layout. Stanford
has a baseball team that plays there and any sort of interest may
be appreciated.
