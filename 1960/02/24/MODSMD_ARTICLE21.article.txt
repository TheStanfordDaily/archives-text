Starting at one this afternoon
Stanford for the third consecutive
year will play host to the North
ern California Intercollegiate Ten
nis Championships. The tourna
ment includes players represent
ing several of Northern Californ
ia's leading colleges including
California, San Jose State, Sacra
mento State, San Francisco State,
and Stanford.
Stanford, winner of the cham
pionship three of the last four
years, hopes to regain the title
they lost to San Jose last year.
San Jose won the title last year
primarily on the play of two men,
highly ranked Whitney Heed and
lefthander Jim Watson. Both
Reed and Watson reached last
year's final round with Heed fin
ally taking the individual title.
Watson, one of the most traveled
of college tennis players has left
San Jose and is now at Texas.
Reed, however, is back and has
been given the top seeding in the
tourney.
Stanford's seven man team will
include Dick Ogden, Jim Jeffries,
Dick Gould, Norm Karns, Dick
Mosk, George Bates, and Gil Ran
ney. Ogden, a finalist in the
tourney two years ago and semi
finalist last year, is seeded sec
ond. Jeffries is the fourth seed
with Cal's Bill Hoogs seeded
third.
Noticeably stronger than in
years past is California. Sopho
mores Hoogs and Mike Farrell
along with Art Kono and Gulden
Lloyd make Cal a threat to both
San Jose and Stanford.
