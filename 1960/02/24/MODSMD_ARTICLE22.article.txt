The Stanford boxing team will
be looking for its first double win
I over Cal in many years, when
' they take on the Bears Thursday
night in the Pavilion.
The Stanford team looks strong
!er with every outing, beating
USF 6-2. last Friday night. This
was the third straight win for
the Stanford sluggers, and their
third in four outings. Last time
against the Bears two weeks ago,
â€¢,the Stanfordites came out on top
of a 5 1 u-2 'u score.
I Friday night against USF, two
Stanford fighters got their first
KO's of the season. Hard-hitting
heavyweight. Ed Rothman. put
the Dons' Jim Sweeney on the
canvas in the second round for
the count, and Bruce Bellows did
the same to his 156 pound op
j ponent in the first round.
In other Stanford wins on the
night, 125 pounder Steve Morris
pounded out a unanimous deci
| sion over Walt Webster of Santa
Clara in an exhibition match, as
did Jim Tompkins in another ex
hibition match. Talton Ray, Stan
lord light-heavy, slugged his way
to a unanimous decision over
[ Giles Turner of USF.
