## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (A*i On what
he thought was his last day, Caryl
Chessman wrote Gov. Brown a
long letter pleading for 30 days lo
prove his innocence with a bi
zarre story of a missing body.
Brown yesterday released the
text of the 1,500 word letter from
Chessman, which the governor
said had no influence on his de
cision to grant him a (JO day re
prieve. He said Chessman had
agreed to make the letter public,
although he originally asked it bo
kept confidential.
"1 solemnly and unqualifiedly
swear before your God and man
kind that 1 did not commit the
Red Light Bandit crimes," Chess
man wrote.
"But I am not asking you to
believe me. And that is the point
of this letter. For, in the name
of humanity and mercy, 1 am ask
ing you to give me a chance to
put up or shut up."
'New Lvi<k i nce'
Chessman said he had "com
pelling new evidence the body of
a man.
"I, as well as someone else,
knew where that body could be
found.
"Accordingly, I sent a person
acting in my behalf to verify that
body was where it should be. It
was gone.
"We conducted then a second,
more intensive search in vain.
And at about this time certain
persons made contact with those
representing me and offered to
sell us information which, they
state positively, would result in
my exoneration.
"I didn't have the almost pro
hibitive sum demanded. There the
matter stands."
Chessman said other evidence
which lie can get would be worth
less without the body. But he said
he is satisfied the body can still
be located.

At a news conference last Fri
day, hours after granting the re
prieve, Brown said he regarded
Chessman's letter as just a last
flitch effort to save himself from
execution.
The governor said he granted
the reprieve for other reasons en
tirely a "chain of circumstance"
capped by a telegram from the
U.S. State Department noting that
Chessman's execution might pro
duce riots in South America dur
ing President Eisenhower's visit.
Brown said, however, that the
State Department telegram which
influenced his decision to reprieve
Chessman was not prompted
by a phone call from a state
official.
The governor reported earlier
that Richard Rogan. chief assis
tant attorney general of Californ
ia. had called George Allen, direc
tor of the U.S. Information
Agency, to inquire about the pos
sible effect of the Chessman ex
ecution on foreign relations.
Rogan said Allen told him that he
expected student riots during the
President's South American trip.
Chessman, in an interview yes
terday with a News-Call Bulletin
writer, said he told Brown that
dental charts were available to
make identification of the miss
ing body possible.
"It's the body's existence and
the association with me would
prove that 1 could not have been
the red light bandit, although it
has no direct connection with the
red light crimes," Chessman said.

the reprieve for other reasons en

Chessman's execution might pro
