## Agriculture 'Based on Man, Hoe' 
### 
The main agricultural problem
Africa faces today is maintaining
fertility of the land. Nigel Hazel
tine, liason officer for the United
Nations Food and Agricultural
Organizations, said yesterday.
Hazeltine spoke here on "The
People and Problems of Africa
Today."
"Africa is destroying her natu
ral resources," Hazeitine said. The
Sahara Desert is advancing, and
the tropical forest is shrinking.
The solution for this underdevel
oped, underproductive, and under
consuming continent is a rational
agriculture, not mechanization,
he said.
"Africa has yet to see an agri
cultural revolution the man
with the hoe is still the basis of
agriculture."
According to Hazeltine, African
leaflet's want to process their raw
materials before exporting them.
Although the power and resourc
es are available, there is not
enough manpower.
Hazeltine said the time of help
ing Africa with large sums of
aid is past. Africa can be best
helped by technical assistance and
an increased trade with the de
veloped countries. "The Commu
nists are exploiting every griev
ance in Africa " Hazeltine stated.
"The United States should give
more trade and industry to Africa
in doing so she would be aiding
her own economic interests."
Hazeltine, who is currently on
a nation-wide speaking tour, has
worked for the FAO for nine
years.
