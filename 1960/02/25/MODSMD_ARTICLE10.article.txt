# U.S., BRITAIN PROTEST
## Bonn Military Plan Hit by Ambassadors 
### 
BONN, Germany </P) Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss
exchanged sharp words with the U.S. and British ambassadors yes
terday over a Bonn proposal to set up military supply bases in Spain.
The ambassadors, Walter C. Dowling of the United States and
Sir Chrisopher Steel ot Britain, told Strauss their governments are

distressed over the timing of the i
Germon move, authoritative in
formants reported.
Strauss said he was angry that
reports of the plan had leaked to
the press. He also said he was
dismayed at press criticism that
the move would revive memories
of German - Spanish cooperation
during Hitler's time.
'New Germany Axis'
One British newspaper, theLon-1
don Daily Express, said in a head- !
line yesterday the plan unveiled
"the new German Axis."
The upshot is that t ho base plan
is likely to be kicked under the
rug, at least until after the May
16 East-West summit meeting, re
liable informants said. The atti
tude of the British Foreign Office
has been that Germany's plan !
would thrown a cloud over the
summit conference.
But the German defense minis- |
ter sought support from the Unit
ed States and Britain for the
project, arguing that front - line
West Germany urgently needs
more space for munitions dumps,
military fuel supply, spare parts,
and hospital equipment. The De
fense Ministry has denied it wants
bombing ranges or missile bases
in Spain as some reports have
said.
NATO Should Decide
The two ambassadors told
Strauss their governments were
not raising objections to the pro
posals, but that the issue should
be thrashed out in NATO. But
they said they believe the Ger
mans handled the delicate project
in an unfortunate manner.
Strauss told the ambassadors
the Germans had launched feel
ers with the Spaniards in an ef
fort to obtain supply bases there, |
but he said no negotiations had j
taken place. This conformed with i
the word of the Spanish Foreign
Ministry that there have been no
negot iat ions.
The Spaniards have not replied ;
to the feelers, Strauss said, add
ing that if they give a favorable
response, the Germans will make
a formal proposal before the
NATO Council.
