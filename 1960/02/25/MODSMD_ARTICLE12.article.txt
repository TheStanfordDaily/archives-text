## Presbyterian Supports Case For Armament 
### Anne Cowen 
"A prevalent assumption seems
| to be that a Christian should be
a pacifist and that if he is not,
il is because he doesn't have the
courage to be one. I feel that the
non-pacifist position is stronger
than that," Malcolm McAfee told
the YWCA Religious A (fairs
i Luncheon group yesterday.
McAfee, Presbyterian Univer
sity pastor, spoke on "The Chris
l tian Case for N u <• I e a r Arma-
I ment."
Citing the action of pacifist
groups in promoting student
peace movements, McAfee said,
"These groups purport to discuss
both sides of the question, but
they are packed with pacifist -
I oriented people and so it is the
viewpoint of this element that
emerges."
Syllogisms
McAfee called the pacifist argu
ments concerning the immoral
nature of war preparations and
the dangers of the nuclear arms
race "neat syllogisms." He said
the question is more complex.
Describing the Christian life
as a "pragmatic, step-at-a-time
J proposition," McAfee said, "I be
lieve that the next step is to close
I the missile gap as quickly as pos
sible. We are economically ca
i pable of doing so."
Skirmishes
McAfee noted that one war
Ia n d "innumerable skirmishes"
I have been fought since the nu
clear age began, without the use
of nuclear weapons.
"I'm not convinced that the
J horror of nuclear war is the basis
for making tactical decisions on
Ihe missile gap," he said.
"To me, 'turning the other
cheek' means a willingnes to ini
tiate and respond to reconcilia
tion suggestions, but not an un
readiness to respond to force if it
becomes neccsary," he staled.
Tomorrow's YWCA luncheon

w;is connected with the 1950 Ros
enberg glomic spy case trial.

the question is more complex.
Describing the Christian life
as a "pragmatic, step-at-a-time
J proposition," McAfee said, "I be
lieve that the next step is to close
I the missile gap as quickly as pos
sible. We are economically ca
i pable of doing so."
Skirmishes
McAfee noted that one war
Ia n d "innumerable skirmishes"
I have been fought since the nu
clear age began, without the use
of nuclear weapons.
"I'm not convinced that the
J horror of nuclear war is the basis
for making tactical decisions on
Ihe missile gap," he said.
"To me, 'turning the other
cheek' means a willingnes to ini
tiate and respond to reconcilia

readiness to respond to force if it
becomes neccsary," he staled.

"A prevalent assumption seems
| to be that a Christian should be
a pacifist and that if he is not,
il is because he doesn't have the
courage to be one. I feel that the
non-pacifist position is stronger
than that," Malcolm McAfee told
the YWCA Religious A (fairs
i Luncheon group yesterday.
McAfee, Presbyterian Univer
sity pastor, spoke on "The Chris
l tian Case for N u <• I e a r Arma-
I ment."
Citing the action of pacifist
groups in promoting student
peace movements, McAfee said,
"These groups purport to discuss
both sides of the question, but
they are packed with pacifist -
I oriented people and so it is the
viewpoint of this element that
emerges."
Syllogisms
McAfee called the pacifist argu
ments concerning the immoral
nature of war preparations and
the dangers of the nuclear arms
race "neat syllogisms." He said
the question is more complex.
