# Basis for Crime Develops In Shortcomings of Society
## 
### Dick White Contributing Editor 
Capital punishment has recent
ly become an emotional political
issue, and like most areas of poli
tics, the seat of Ihe dispute lie*
not in rational, well-founded argu
ments, but rather in basic per
sonal concepts of the individual
vis-a-vis society. Opposition to
capital punishment is therefore
based on certain propositions
which affirm the social nature of
the individual citizen.
Each person in the community
is merely a composite of the en
vironmental influences to which
he has been exposed. No biolog
ical or psychological evidence
has yet been unearthed to show
an inborn tendency towards
crime.
Minority Groups
Crime develops pr i m a r i 1 y
among the poor and among mem
bers of minority groups, particu
larly at present among tho Ne
groes and Puerto Ricans. Our
most improvcrished minorities in
habit t he least desirable areas,
enjoy the fewest educational ad
vantages. and are constantly in
stilled with a feeling of inferior
cultural and economic potential.
Their sense of inferiority is
antagonized by the American mid
dle class ethic of success. We re
ward and respect accomplishment
in the business and professional
fields; much of America's
strength rests in our encourage
ment of the strife for personal
and financial betterment.
However, many of lower class
find their way to conventional
success blocked, not so much by
their own lack of ability, but
rather by social prejudices.
Own Culture
Chronic criminals are shaped
by society, find prejudices at
every turn, and then violently re
ject the mores and ethics of mid
dle class society. This group soon
forms its own culture, complete
with a set of values and standards
for conduct.
These are the criminals, al
though they have yet to disobey a
law or commit a crime, isolated
from the mainstream of Ameri
can beliefs and contracted into a
small hostile core. When the
crime is done, imprisonment or
death follows.
We as a society punish these

people and yet we formed them.
More than often these men, re
leaser! from prison, are even more
alienated from society than be
fore. Yet law enforcement officers
and other public officials rarely
call for improvement of the pris
on education and training pro
gram which might be able to pre
pare the convicts for some sort
of useful life.
Legislators all too often vehe
mently denounce the slum clear
ance and urban redevelopment
programs which are usually last
on the priority list for funds.
Criminals are considered to spring
"do novo" out of the population
or to be descendants of a long
line of arch fiends. Our slums and
segregation train our criminals
as methodically as if we had de
liberately anticipated the task.
Dramatic Symbol
Punishment, therefore, is a dra
matic symbol of our inability to
face the situation of crime. As a
society, we cannot admit our guilt
in the molding of criminals; we
can do nothing but blame them.
Capital punishment is the most
barbaric expression 'of our so
ciety's failings.
Yet surely the criminal cannot
be blamed for his plight. At every
turn he has been pushed further
from the mores of middle class
America. Imprisonment often con
tinues this process of alienation.
If we honestly desire to lower the
crime rate, we must approach Ihe
problem from three angles;
1. Our penal system must be
revised to train these men in the
ways of our society through edu
cation and psychological therapy.
Opportunities
2. We must provide employ
ment opportunities for rehabili
tated criminals to keep them from
slipping out of society.
3. We must destroy the cause
of crime by redeveloping slum
areas and ending racial or eco
nomic blocks to advanced educa
tion and job opportunities.
Crime is a social problem. We
should treat it as we do a disease.
The infected person should be
isolated for rehabilitation, and the
cause of his crime should be
searched out and destroyed. We
have been successful in destroy
ing infectious diseases; we may
well profit by similarly attacking
crime, our most infectious social
disease.
