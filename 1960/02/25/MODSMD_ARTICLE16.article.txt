Editor, The Daily:
People forget so easily! A little
over eleven years ago a man per
petrated a series of villainous
crimes with vicious results. He
was tried, convicted, and sen
tenced to death; but. as a result
of our hard-pressed court system,
fate granted him a reprieve.
Now people want to release him
from this sentence. They say "he
has suffered enough." They for
get that one of his victims has
been confined in an insane asylum
for these eleven years. Has Death
Row been worse than this insane
asylum?
Now we must consider the
abolishment of capital punish
ment. Some people have the idea
that we can and should eliminate
that "barbarous" practice. How
ever. our society has not attained
the maturity which is necessary
for the abolishment of capital
punishment.
For example, a magazine ar
tical recently stated lhat Houston,
which was notorious for seldom
sentencing a murderer to death,
has a tremendously increasing
murder rate.
. "Barbarous" c a pi t a 1 punish
ment is not just a punishment;
it is a deterrent. We must thank
the idealists for le>ting us see the
beautiful side of life, but a real
istic look around always shows
us the ugly, practical side.
We need capital punishment;
and I'm sorry that we do truly
sorry.

Governor Brown
ICditor, The Daily:
Governor Brown's handling of
the recent Chessman case was un
pardonable. His sworn duties as
Governor of the State of Cali
fornia include the upholding of
the state laws. The ethics of his
office require him to act on be
half of the majority of Californ
ia ns.
In his granting of clemency to
Caryl Chessman, he has either
neglected or violated both of these
duties. If his personal or religious
beliefs do not allow him to act as
he swore he would in his oath of
office, he should step down and
allow a more able man to take
over. It would seem that the least
he could do would be to stay and
face the resulting chaos rather
than leave it to his subordinates.
The question of capital punish
ment is not an issue in this case.
Right or wrong, it is part of the
laws of California and as such is
above Ihe jurisdiction of the Gov
ernor.
There is no question that the
majority of Californians are in
favor of capital punishment.
There is a fourteen year voting
record to this effect.
The California State Supreme
Court refused clemency. It is
clear that Governor Brown acted
eit her on his personal or religious
convictions or was swayed by the
pressure of uninformed public
largely outside the state
of California. In either case, such
a man should face impeachment
proceedings.

The recent furor about the dis
position of the Squaw Valley
White Elephant has brought us
to the realization of the tremen
dous opportunity in store for
Stanford University.

Considering ihe great sacrifice i
of Alex Cushing for the United j
States, we feel sure that he would |
be desirous to see the cause of ed
ucation furthered by bequesting!
his ski lifts, lodge and other as
sorted properties to increase the j
cultural opportunities to Stanford
students.
When one contemplates the
fabulous sum of four million dol
lars which our benevolent gov-:
ernment plans to squander on
cancer research during the com
ing year, it is reassuring to know j
that there are level headed states- :
men in positions of responsibility!
who are willing to devote their j
time, energy, and twenty million j
dollars of public money so that,
in the grandest tradition of de
mocracy, more people can hobble
pitifully on their "in-group" white
plaster badges of courage. . .
Squaw Valley's proven value as !
an area of vital defense effort
(witness the 300 snow-tamping
troops who have marched into
the Valley of Squaw to further;
our nation's position as a fore
most power) would make ii just
as ideal a training location for
our top-ranked ROTC units. With
a little imagination, one can see]
countless other educational possi- j

I was among the audience of
"The Diary of Anne Frank" j
shown at the Flicks Sunday. I
was utterly disappointed and dis- 1
turbed by the general attitude and i
reaction of the majority of the 1
audience to the film. Several Eu-1
ropean students wilh whom I |
talked after the show felt the!
same wav as I did.

The theme of the film was one
of human humiliation and suffer
ing inflicted upon a small minor
ity group and caused by war and
prejudice. One did not, and does
not, need to be a Jew to be moved
by a film like this.
Any person, 1 thought, with
some historical perspective and
some sense of human dignity
would watch the "Diary" with
seriousness and meditation. The
majority of the audience, which
consisted essentially of t ho Stan
ford student body, was unrespon
sive to the general grim atmos
phere of the film and seemed to
be unaware of its implications.
I do grant that one or two
scenes in the film were 'funny'
enough to be possibly laughed at.
Almost all the rest of the petty
incidences of supposedly funny
nature, however, added to ihe
irony of the situation in the film
and made the theme more 'real' or
human-woven.
Such incidences attracted loud
laughters, sometimes accompan
ied by hand-clappings, from the
audience on many occasions.
Various love scenes set in a back
ground of fear and psychological
unrest were taken by the audi
ence as something of the nature
of a premature high-school ro
mance experienced by two teen
agers. . .
Is it possible that the well-fed
and well-clad average student of
the 'Stanford Family,' so much
accustomed to seeing Broadway
glamor on the white screen, can
not, out of complacency, take a
film of human suffering serious
ly?
I can only hope that the re
action of the audience at the
Flicks Sunday was not repre
sentative of that of the American
college youth in general.

People forget so easily! A little
over eleven years ago a man per
petrated a series of villainous
crimes with vicious results. He
was tried, convicted, and sen
tenced to death; but. as a result
of our hard-pressed court system,
fate granted him a reprieve.
Now people want to release him
from this sentence. They say "he
has suffered enough." They for
get that one of his victims has
been confined in an insane asylum
for these eleven years. Has Death
Row been worse than this insane
asylum?
Now we must consider the
abolishment of capital punish
ment. Some people have the idea
that we can and should eliminate
that "barbarous" practice. How
ever. our society has not attained
the maturity which is necessary
for the abolishment of capital
punishment.
For example, a magazine ar

which was notorious for seldom
sentencing a murderer to death,
has a tremendously increasing
murder rate.

Governor Brown
ICditor, The Daily:
Governor Brown's handling of
the recent Chessman case was un
pardonable. His sworn duties as
Governor of the State of Cali
fornia include the upholding of
the state laws. The ethics of his
office require him to act on be
half of the majority of Californ
ia ns.
In his granting of clemency to
Caryl Chessman, he has either
neglected or violated both of these
duties. If his personal or religious
beliefs do not allow him to act as
he swore he would in his oath of
office, he should step down and
allow a more able man to take
over. It would seem that the least
he could do would be to stay and
face the resulting chaos rather
than leave it to his subordinates.
The question of capital punish
ment is not an issue in this case.
Right or wrong, it is part of the
laws of California and as such is
above Ihe jurisdiction of the Gov
ernor.
There is no question that the
majority of Californians are in
favor of capital punishment.
There is a fourteen year voting
record to this effect.
The California State Supreme
Court refused clemency. It is
clear that Governor Brown acted
eit her on his personal or religious
convictions or was swayed by the
pressure of uninformed public
largely outside the state
of California. In either case, such
a man should face impeachment
proceedings.

I was among the audience of

was utterly disappointed and dis- 1
turbed by the general attitude and i
reaction of the majority of the 1
audience to the film. Several Eu-1
ropean students wilh whom I |
talked after the show felt the!
same wav as I did.

The theme of the film was one
of human humiliation and suffer
ing inflicted upon a small minor
ity group and caused by war and
prejudice. One did not, and does
not, need to be a Jew to be moved
by a film like this.
Any person, 1 thought, with
some historical perspective and
some sense of human dignity
would watch the "Diary" with
seriousness and meditation. The
majority of the audience, which
consisted essentially of t ho Stan
ford student body, was unrespon
sive to the general grim atmos
phere of the film and seemed to
be unaware of its implications.
I do grant that one or two
scenes in the film were 'funny'
enough to be possibly laughed at.
Almost all the rest of the petty
incidences of supposedly funny
nature, however, added to ihe
irony of the situation in the film
and made the theme more 'real' or
human-woven.

Is it possible that the well-fed

People forget so easily! A little
over eleven years ago a man per
petrated a series of villainous
crimes with vicious results. He
was tried, convicted, and sen
tenced to death; but. as a result
of our hard-pressed court system,
fate granted him a reprieve.
Now people want to release him
from this sentence. They say "he
has suffered enough." They for
get that one of his victims has
been confined in an insane asylum
for these eleven years. Has Death
Row been worse than this insane
asylum?
Now we must consider the
abolishment of capital punish
ment. Some people have the idea
that we can and should eliminate
that "barbarous" practice. How

ICditor, The Daily:
Governor Brown's handling of
the recent Chessman case was un
pardonable. His sworn duties as
Governor of the State of Cali
fornia include the upholding of
the state laws. The ethics of his
office require him to act on be
half of the majority of Californ
ia ns.
In his granting of clemency to
Caryl Chessman, he has either
neglected or violated both of these
duties. If his personal or religious
beliefs do not allow him to act as
he swore he would in his oath of
office, he should step down and
allow a more able man to take
over. It would seem that the least
he could do would be to stay and
face the resulting chaos rather
than leave it to his subordinates.
The question of capital punish
ment is not an issue in this case.
Right or wrong, it is part of the
laws of California and as such is
above Ihe jurisdiction of the Gov
ernor.
There is no question that the
majority of Californians are in
favor of capital punishment.
There is a fourteen year voting
record to this effect.
The California State Supreme
Court refused clemency. It is
clear that Governor Brown acted
eit her on his personal or religious
convictions or was swayed by the
pressure of uninformed public
largely outside the state
of California. In either case, such
a man should face impeachment
proceedings.

I was among the audience of
"The Diary of Anne Frank" j
shown at the Flicks Sunday. I
was utterly disappointed and dis- 1
turbed by the general attitude and i
reaction of the majority of the 1
audience to the film. Several Eu-1
ropean students wilh whom I |
talked after the show felt the!
same wav as I did.

The theme of the film was one
of human humiliation and suffer
ing inflicted upon a small minor
ity group and caused by war and
prejudice. One did not, and does
not, need to be a Jew to be moved
by a film like this.
Any person, 1 thought, with
some historical perspective and
some sense of human dignity
would watch the "Diary" with
seriousness and meditation. The
majority of the audience, which
consisted essentially of t ho Stan
ford student body, was unrespon
sive to the general grim atmos
phere of the film and seemed to
be unaware of its implications.
I do grant that one or two
scenes in the film were 'funny'
enough to be possibly laughed at.
Almost all the rest of the petty
incidences of supposedly funny
nature, however, added to ihe
irony of the situation in the film
and made the theme more 'real' or
human-woven.
Such incidences attracted loud
laughters, sometimes accompan
ied by hand-clappings, from the
audience on many occasions.
Various love scenes set in a back
ground of fear and psychological
unrest were taken by the audi
ence as something of the nature
of a premature high-school ro
mance experienced by two teen
agers. . .
Is it possible that the well-fed
and well-clad average student of
the 'Stanford Family,' so much
accustomed to seeing Broadway
glamor on the white screen, can
not, out of complacency, take a
film of human suffering serious
ly?
I can only hope that the re
action of the audience at the
Flicks Sunday was not repre
sentative of that of the American
college youth in general.

People forget so easily! A little
over eleven years ago a man per
petrated a series of villainous
crimes with vicious results. He
was tried, convicted, and sen
tenced to death; but. as a result
of our hard-pressed court system,
fate granted him a reprieve.
Now people want to release him
from this sentence. They say "he
has suffered enough." They for
get that one of his victims has
been confined in an insane asylum
for these eleven years. Has Death
Row been worse than this insane
asylum?
Now we must consider the
abolishment of capital punish
ment. Some people have the idea
that we can and should eliminate
that "barbarous" practice. How
ever. our society has not attained
the maturity which is necessary
for the abolishment of capital
punishment.
For example, a magazine ar
tical recently stated lhat Houston,
which was notorious for seldom
sentencing a murderer to death,
has a tremendously increasing
murder rate.
. "Barbarous" c a pi t a 1 punish
ment is not just a punishment;
it is a deterrent. We must thank
the idealists for le>ting us see the
beautiful side of life, but a real
istic look around always shows
us the ugly, practical side.
We need capital punishment;
and I'm sorry that we do truly
sorry.

Governor Brown
ICditor, The Daily:
Governor Brown's handling of
the recent Chessman case was un
pardonable. His sworn duties as
Governor of the State of Cali
fornia include the upholding of
the state laws. The ethics of his
office require him to act on be
half of the majority of Californ
ia ns.
In his granting of clemency to
Caryl Chessman, he has either
neglected or violated both of these
duties. If his personal or religious
beliefs do not allow him to act as
he swore he would in his oath of
office, he should step down and
allow a more able man to take
over. It would seem that the least
he could do would be to stay and
face the resulting chaos rather
than leave it to his subordinates.
The question of capital punish
ment is not an issue in this case.
Right or wrong, it is part of the
laws of California and as such is
above Ihe jurisdiction of the Gov
ernor.
There is no question that the
majority of Californians are in
favor of capital punishment.
There is a fourteen year voting
record to this effect.
The California State Supreme
Court refused clemency. It is
clear that Governor Brown acted
eit her on his personal or religious
convictions or was swayed by the
pressure of uninformed public
largely outside the state
of California. In either case, such
a man should face impeachment
proceedings.

The recent furor about the dis
position of the Squaw Valley
White Elephant has brought us
to the realization of the tremen
dous opportunity in store for
Stanford University.

Considering ihe great sacrifice i
of Alex Cushing for the United j
States, we feel sure that he would |
be desirous to see the cause of ed
ucation furthered by bequesting!
his ski lifts, lodge and other as
sorted properties to increase the j
cultural opportunities to Stanford
students.
When one contemplates the
fabulous sum of four million dol
lars which our benevolent gov-:
ernment plans to squander on
cancer research during the com
ing year, it is reassuring to know j
that there are level headed states- :
men in positions of responsibility!
who are willing to devote their j
time, energy, and twenty million j
dollars of public money so that,
in the grandest tradition of de
mocracy, more people can hobble
pitifully on their "in-group" white
plaster badges of courage. . .
Squaw Valley's proven value as !
an area of vital defense effort
(witness the 300 snow-tamping
troops who have marched into
the Valley of Squaw to further;
our nation's position as a fore
most power) would make ii just
as ideal a training location for
our top-ranked ROTC units. With
a little imagination, one can see]
