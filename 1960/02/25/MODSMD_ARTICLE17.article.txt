The best sports columnist in the Middle West, Doc Croon, who
contributes to the Detroit News, started what he called a Hockey
Haters Club awhile back.
The club was founded on Doe's basic assumption that professional
hockey was the most ridiculous sport in the world. He perceived
the sport as a bunch of men racing up and down a frozen puddle
as fast as they could, trying to maim each other with five foot
clubs and. only incidentally, trying* to thrust a hard, round, flat
piece of rubber into a cage.
Ho further maintained that hockey was the only sport where a
red light had to be flashed in order to let the spectators know that
a point had been scored because none of them could actually see
the puck enter the net.

All this took place several years
ago and we remember, on first
encountering Doc's wrath, think
ing that he had picked on the
wrong sport.
Hockey, it seemed to us, was an
honorable profession. Hockey
players, at least, are a rugged
breed. One of those padded in
dividuals is able to suffer a clout
on the lace requiring 10 stitches,
receive a sewing-up and be back
on the ice in 20 minutes to finish
the game by seeking out his ad
versary and delivering a similar
blow to him.
Doc. wo thought at the time,
had missed a good bet by not
starting a Professional Basketball
Haters Club.
Until this year our enthusiasm
for roundball has remained con
fined to the high school and col
lego variety. This form of the
sport has always seemed about
the most exciting spectator sport
that there is. But the pro game.

with players who never seemed to miss a shot, and which never end
ed with one team within shouting distance of the other scorewise,
always appeared about as exciting as kissing your grandmother.
That is up until this year. The game is undergoing a change
to the extent that one can hold out hope that within a couple of
years it will generate the kind of enthusiasm among it-s tans that
professional football does now.
Wilt (the Stilt) the Symbol
No one man can be said to be responsible for the change in
the game, but the impact that Wilt Chamberlain has had on the
league in this, his rookie year, sort of makes him a symbol of the
things to come.
Wilt, you'll remember, is the seven-footer who claims he was
legislated right out of college ball. Just before his senior year at
the University of Kansas he saddened his mother by quitting in
disgust at a new rule change which made it tougher for the big
man to operate and joined the Harlem Globetrotters while waiting
for his class to graduate so he could join the Philadelphia Warriors.
Wilt will not only be the league's top scorer this year, but has
already set a new one season scoring record. He has already scored
more points in one year than George Yardley, Bob Pet tit, Paul
Ari/.in or old timers George Mikan or Neal Johnston over did.
Again this is his FIRST year.
The significance of Wilt's success is this. One Wilt Chamber
lain added to the Philadelphia Warriors made an exciting, spectator
drawing basketball team. One Oscar Robertson added to the Cin
cinnati pro squad next year will do the same for that lark-luster
Jerry West, a relatively tiny boy at 0-3. but, according to the West
Virginia publicity service, the greatest thing that has happened to
basketball since metal rims replaced bushel baskets, may do the
same for another team.
Jerry Lucas, only a sophomore at Ohio State, looks like another
groat one. The college woods are full of them.
The Age of the Super-Star
In a few years, when every team has its super-star, its Cham
berlain if you will, they will be turning the fans away from the
arenas the way they do from the Pavilion when Gal is around.
There is some talk about penalizing the big man in pro ball
similar to the way it is done in college. The latest and most in
genious method devised for this purpose is to give each shot a
point value depending on' how far from the basket it is made.
One point for a bucket from within six feet, two for a shot between
six and 20 feet and three for all shots made from farther out.
Presumably if you score from underneath your opponent's basket
you automatically win the game.
From this corner this plan, and similar ones aimed at reducing
the big man's effectiveness, doesn't sound very -smart. It would
be on a par with restricting the forward pass in pro football. The
big man. the new big man, who scores 40 points a game and
singlehandedly makes his team a threat, is going to make profes
sional basketball a game to be reckoned with ... if they let him.
