# Trojans Here Tomorrow For Conference Contest
## 
### Vic Affolter 
The HSC Trojans, fresh from
victories over Oregon and Oregon
State last weekend, will invade
the Stanford Pavilion tomorrow
for a Big Five conference scrap
with the Indians.
Trojan hopes for a victory over
the Indians will rest largely on
the shoulders of sharp-shooting
guard Jerry Pimm. Pimm, the
team's captain, scored 36 points
in the two Trojan victories last
weekend. 11<> had a high night of
23 points against the Ducks Sat
urday night. His running mate
will be Bill Bloom, the team's
hack-court quarterback.
Iluiiiia or Hampton
Coach Forrest Twogood will
have his choice at center between
big Jim Hamma, the rugged 6-7
senior, and a promising sopho
more, Bill Hampton. Hanna, who
is one of tin 1 team's leading re
bounders, has picked up after a
midseason slump and is likely to
receive the starting nod.
All - American candidate and
leading team scorer John Werhas
will start at one forward. The 6-2
Werhas has already gained All-
America honors at baseball and
is rated by many as one of the
school's greatest athletes of all
lime. 6-6 John Kudometkin will
open at the other forward posi
tion. He is second in team scor
ing and the team's leading re
bounder.
Shown Promise
USC has at times shown prom
ise of developing into a great ball
club this season. They dealt the
California Bears their only defeat
of the season early in January.
This was no small accomplish
ment as the Bears have run up

a 20-1 record and are currently
rated tourth nationally. Boasting
a 13-9 record for the overall sea
son, the Trojans now stand only
1-6 in conference play. They are
in fourth place, followed only by
the Huskies from Washington.
