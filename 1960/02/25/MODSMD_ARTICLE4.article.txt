# SENATE RIGHTS BATTLE
## Johnson Asks Round-the-Clock Sessions: Southerners Retaliate 
### 
WASHINGTON (IPi Southerners, outnumbered in the Senate's civil rights battle, announced
yesterday they'll fight back with all the obstructive tactics of a filibuster.
Beginning today Sen. Richard B. Russell (D-Ga.i said, the Southerners will not permit, the Senate
j to transact any business that requires unanimous consent.
Russell said obstructive devices would be in order as retaliation to the call by Sen. Lyndon B.

Johnson < D-Tex. >, the Senate lead
er. to begin around-the-clock Sen
ate sessions Monday.
Legislative Torture
Continuous sessions could be
expected to wear down physically
the Southerners fighting off new
federal rights legislation. Russell
called the proposal a "kind of
legislative torture."
However, a foremost backer of
rights legislation, Sen. Jacob K.
Javits (R-N.Y.), proceeded on the
assumption that day and night
sessions are a certainty and a nec
essity if tiie Senate is ever to pass
on whether to help Southern Ne
groes vote.
Great; Issues at Stake
"As we get into 'round-the-clock
sessions and some understandable
irritation of tempers on the sub
ject," Javits told the Senate, "let
us remember that notwithstand
ing the niceties of parliamentary
procedures . . . there are great
issues at stake."
Johnson, a potential candidate
for the Democratic presidential
nomination who needs both South
ern and Northern support, told
newsmen: "The Senate is deter
mined to pass an effective bill to
guarantee effect ive voting rights."
"Many members are equally
determined to discuss this subject
fully and thoroughly." he added.
"1 respect both desires, and
since there is must pressing Sen
ale business ahead of us, the only
way 1 know in which both desires
can be met is to lengthen the
daily sessions."
