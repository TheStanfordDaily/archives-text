### 
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (/!>) Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians welcomed President Eisen
hower with cheers and a blizzard of confetti and streamers yesterday. The crowds were described by
police as the greatest for any visitor in Rio de Janeiro's four-century history.
Eisenhower took up the serious business of his four-nation South American tour in responding
to an official welcome before the parade and in an address to Brazil's Congress afterward.

With the Communists evidently
in mind, he sounded a hands-off
warning to any ideology threaten
ing to deny American nations the
right lo choose their own way of
life. He cat led for ihe banishment
of war and diversion of arma
ment money global attacks on
disease, ignorance and poverty.
He suggested a speedup in stud
j ies for promotion of the Western
| Hemisphere's economic develop
j mcnt.
Ciood Relations
Last night, Eisenhower was
guest of honor at a dinner at the
Brazilian Foreign Ministry in
Itamaraty Palace. In a toast he
, referred to Ihe members of his
official party and said their pres
ence on his trip "symbolizes the
high importance we of my coun
try attach to good relations with
all the nations of Latin America.
"I know that what we are all
learning, and shall observe
throughout this trip," he said,
"will be helpful to use as we seek
constantly to work for hemi
spheric solidarity."
Street Show
But the big show was in the
| broad streets yesterday. The
temperature was about 80 de
grees.
Clouds of paper floated down
from office buildings upon Eisen
hower and President Juscelino
Kubitschek, his dapper. 57-year
old host.
Student elements joined iti the
j acclaim for Eisenhower, but stu
dent left wingers had a good word
j too for Cuba's Prime Minister Fi
del Castro, a critic of the Eisen
hower administration.
Ike and Castro
"We like Ike and Fidel Cas
; tro," said a sign strung across
student headquarters, with big
! gei 1 letters emphasizing Castro's
I name. A sign hung across the
i route said, "Understanding yes,
submission never." Police said ev
erybody has a right to his opinion
| in Brazil and took no notice of
the signs.
At one point some students
leaned from windows and shouted
! "Fidel Castro!" The crowd on the
| sidewalk below booed the stu
dents. Eisenhower smiled.
Kubitschek said Brazil was re
ceiving Eisenhower as "a fighter
i and a man of good will, as a
clear-viewed statesman and a
j champion of peace."
Eisenhower later delivered the
first major address of his 10-day
tour. Before Brazil's Congress he
| proclaimed his hands-off warning.
The key to U.S. policy. Eisen
; bower said, is "the right to
i choose," a right that should be
| everybody's at birth.
Intervention
Taking note indirectly of Com
munist efforts in the Western
Hemisphere, he declared: "We
would consider it intervention In
the internal affairs of an Ameri
can state if any power, whether
by invasion, coercion, or subver
sion, succeeded in denying free
dom of choice to the people of
any of our sister republics."
The President goes today to
Sao Paulo, Brazil's major indus
trial city.
