# Alums Attack Land Plan
## 
### 
In a huge, near full-page ad in Tuesday's Palo
Alto Times, a group of Stanford alumni directed
an attack at the University's land development
program, spurred by recent announcement of
plans to locate light industry in the foothills be
hind the campus.
"We know the University needs revenue," the
article read. "And we have been reconciled to the
tact thai homes would be built in the Stanford
foot hills.
"But the sudden switch from a plan of resi
dential development to a wholly new scheme of
extending industry into the foothills has alarmed
Stanford graduates and countless others who
make their homes in the surrounding communi
ties.
The ad charged that Stanford has not seriously
considered how the development of its land will
help or harm the Peninsula area in future years,
and that often plans have not been coordinated
with general city and county plans. "Will Stan
ford consider its neighbors onl> when forced to
do so by the county or city governments?" the ad
queried.
Admitting pride in Stanford's accomplishments
in many fields, the alumni urged the University
to continue such progress, but asked, "Cannot
Stanford University, as a great institution of
learning which exerts its leadership in the world
of ideas, also set an example of far-sighted com
munity leadership in planning?"
The ad issued a challenge to the Stanford
Trustees to set forth publicly the long range land

development plans of Iho University, explaining
why earlier plans for residential development
have been scrapped, where factory workers will
live, whal new roads will be needed to handle
traffic and what will eventually happen to the
foothill lands.
In a statement issued yesterday, President
Wallace Sterling upheld the University's position.
"During my ten years of office, the Trustees
have consistently shown a deep concern for the
careful, long range planning of Stanford land
development. They have recognized their pri
mary obligation to the University; they have
also been concerned as to the effect of Stanford
land development on neighboring communities,"
Sterling said.
"Members of the University staff, in particular
Mr. (Alfi Brandin, the executive officers for land
development, have kept in close touch with re
sponsible city, county and state officials concern
ing our long range master plans and the adjust
ments which inevitably occur in such plans* with
the passage of time and changing circumstance.
"Mr. Brandin has spoken literally hundreds of
times about Stanford land use plans at meetings
of clubs, real estate boards, Stanford alumni, and
other gathering's of interested persons as well
as at official public hearings of city councils and
planning commissions," Sterling continued.
"Stanford has made a conscientious effort to
keep the communities surrounding the campus in
formed of our plans, an effort which could easily
be documented."

extending industry into the foothills has alarmed
Stanford graduates and countless others who
make their homes in the surrounding communi
ties.
The ad charged that Stanford has not seriously
considered how the development of its land will
help or harm the Peninsula area in future years,
and that often plans have not been coordinated
with general city and county plans. "Will Stan
ford consider its neighbors onl> when forced to
do so by the county or city governments?" the ad
queried.
Admitting pride in Stanford's accomplishments
in many fields, the alumni urged the University
to continue such progress, but asked, "Cannot
Stanford University, as a great institution of
learning which exerts its leadership in the world
of ideas, also set an example of far-sighted com
munity leadership in planning?"
The ad issued a challenge to the Stanford
Trustees to set forth publicly the long range land

development plans of Iho University, explaining
why earlier plans for residential development
have been scrapped, where factory workers will
live, whal new roads will be needed to handle
traffic and what will eventually happen to the
foothill lands.
In a statement issued yesterday, President
Wallace Sterling upheld the University's position.
"During my ten years of office, the Trustees
have consistently shown a deep concern for the
careful, long range planning of Stanford land
development. They have recognized their pri
mary obligation to the University; they have
also been concerned as to the effect of Stanford
land development on neighboring communities,"
Sterling said.
"Members of the University staff, in particular
Mr. (Alfi Brandin, the executive officers for land
development, have kept in close touch with re
sponsible city, county and state officials concern
ing our long range master plans and the adjust
ments which inevitably occur in such plans* with
the passage of time and changing circumstance.
"Mr. Brandin has spoken literally hundreds of
times about Stanford land use plans at meetings
of clubs, real estate boards, Stanford alumni, and
other gathering's of interested persons as well
as at official public hearings of city councils and
planning commissions," Sterling continued.
"Stanford has made a conscientious effort to
keep the communities surrounding the campus in
formed of our plans, an effort which could easily
be documented."
In a huge, near full-page ad in Tuesday's Palo
Alto Times, a group of Stanford alumni directed
an attack at the University's land development
program, spurred by recent announcement of
plans to locate light industry in the foothills be
hind the campus.
"We know the University needs revenue," the
article read. "And we have been reconciled to the
tact thai homes would be built in the Stanford
foot hills.
"But the sudden switch from a plan of resi
dential development to a wholly new scheme of
extending industry into the foothills has alarmed
