This is the B-52. Advanced as it
may be, thi> airplane has one thing
in common with the first war
galleys of ancient Egypt...and
! with the air and space vehicles of
the future. Someone must chart its
course. Someone must navigate it.
For certain young men this pre
sents a career of real executive
! opportunity. Here, perhaps you
will have the chance to master a
profession full of meaning, excite
ment and rewards...as a Naviga
tor in the U. S. Air Force.
To qualifj for Navigator train
ing as an Aviation Cadet you must
be an American citizen between 19
and 26K'—single, healthy and in
telligent. A high school diploma is
required, but some college is highly
desirable. Successful completion of
the training program leads to a
commission as a Second Lieuten
ant... and your Navigator wings.
If you think you have what it
takes to measure up to the Avia
tion Cadet Program for Naviga
tor training, see your local Air
Force Recruiter. Or clip and mail
