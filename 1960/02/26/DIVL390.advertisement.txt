SIX MORE EASY LISTENS WITH CAPITOL RECORDS
8:04 PM There's a lamp that'll get knocked over later if you don't
move it. Take care of this and then take care, since talk can llag
H during a party's early moments, to have a covering background of
111 harmonious music. The recording to the left, with the Four I rcsh
gg Jre nien and a 10-trombone brass orchestra blending furiously, is har
'* monious and then some. The group just won an award in the Playboy
jj[:™flßpra|i| All-Star Poll and the album includes ice-breakers like Route 66,
iilL jftt' ' Sunday, Candy and Laura; the picture on the back, though, could
raise one slightly unsettling question; These guys are freshmen?
j" " A 8:41 PM The laments in Kay Starr's new release aren't dangerously
lugubrious and, actually, should stimulate casual entrances onto the
i / dance floor. That's due to Kay's ardent, ringing style and the lush
'0 TwgSSaSSH string background which is under only mild sedation behind her.

5 * or I ' lC ot ' lc,s i sn "t in a mood to enjoy or contribute much to things
■ % \ anyway, and might appreciate a thoughtful suggestion that there's
mi,,,!, probably still time to make it to the library before it closes.
' * '* 9:22 PM If the party's billed as a "Dance," this is as good a time
- ; • as any to lind out how seriously it is meant. Put on the new Kenton
h ■■■■■ . album; it's in the lit-up Latin tradition of Peanut Vendor. Some
lmf| II numbers, like Adios, are fairly relaxed, but most—-e.g., a sizzling
i new Artistry in Rhythm— test dancing prowess. It should separate
|Jj§ %|||||| the men from the boys. (If it separates the men from the xirls, try
Y'fWf, ' the music in Capitol's "Arthur Murray" series. Sets of sambas, fox
/ 'W- / trots, etc. with top bands and good for pleasant, low-pressure
. * - dancing. Little pictures show where to put your feet.)
-«f| 10:07 PM While the blood is up, put on Ray Anthony's latest,
'"Like Wild!" The title means much the same as "It's the cat's
pajamas" but says it faster, in keeping with today's modern, high
speed living. Both expressions become clear when the record is
la played, for it's a fine, swinging, powerhouse of brass eH'ccts, some
mP delectable, some almost alarming. Anthony plays new stuff and
♦ ones like Peter Gunrt Theme, Room 43, 707 and Walk in to Mother's
that he's already made a lot of money on as singles. An intermission
will be needed. Who won the basketball game.'
10:40 PM What, aside from having all been great instrumental,
do Snowfall, In the Mood. Poor People of Paris and Fly in' Home
' iave in common ;) Practically nothing. What, do you suppose, does
Hi hHh this mean to Billy May.' Practically nothing. He has outrageously
~ spiced up the originals with flutes and things and somehow turned
MSI them all, plus others, into some very cheery cha-chas. Twelfth Street
I \ Rag-Cha-Cha, though, is unforgivable. Laugh, cry, spill something
mW —you'll just have to do llic best }ou can.
11:28 PM The Quiet Time is at hand. "Ballads for Night People"
are the songs June gets asked for most by nostalgic nightcrawlers.
Jli iii pubs. Mostly sentimental tunes with the kind of introspective
lyrics she sings best. While Christy lights her way in the dark with
llajl Bewitched. Don't Cet Around Much Any More, My Ship and others
jraß in that price range, some couples may wish to sit this one out,
w sending to the dimmer corners to speak softly of issues like the
ramLf Mlllii November elections, lung cancer, and so forth. Ihe record changer
111 I'un be set to repeat and that, perhaps, will take care of that.
