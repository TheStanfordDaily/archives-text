# ‘Dybbuk’ Termed Absorbing Play
## 
### Mary Lou McKiuley, Managing Editor 
A mystical tale of Medieval Jewish folklore and the intense acting
of Erica Speyer combined to produce a fascinating and absorbing
drama Wednesday night in the Little Theater when the Stanford
Players opened their production of Sholem Ansky's "The Dybbuk."
Miss Speyer protrays Leah, the young girl who becomes pos-

sessed by the spirit, or dybbuk
of her predestined bridegroom
With a beautiful, haunting voice
and consistently graceful move
ments, she gave to the character
a mystical quality even before
the possession:
Through intense absorption in
the role and a startling change
of voice. Miss Speyer projected
a vivid picture of a possessed
soul which gave the play much
of its compelling and fascinating
quality.
Polish Setting
•Set in Poland during the 18th
century, the play, especially the
first act, contains frequent refer
ences to Jewish customs which
were not familiar to all the audi
ence. This, along with too much
restraint and a general lack of
feeling in several of the minor
characterizations produced a
rather slow and unnatural first
act.
Although the play is certainly
not intended to be "natural," a
little more gesture, movement
and emotion might have helped
to achieve the desired mystical
effect in this act.
However, Ihe fine characteriza
tion of Phillip Angeloff as Chan
non, the promised bridegroom,
occurred in this act. along with
the first appearance of the un
known messenger, a part well
done by Philip Halinger.
Effective Settings
But once into the play, the su
pernatural atmosphere, put for
ward initially by James Lyon's
imaginative and very effective
stage settings, deepened and per
sisted to the end, with only a few
disturbing moments, when the
mood was altered. Credit must
go to graduate student-director
Raoul Pei/.er for a skillful inter
pretation and preservation of the
mood of the play.
Forceful
The scene of the exorcism of
the dybbuk was especially mov
ing and forceful.
I wish, however, that curtain
calls after all highly dramatic
plays could be eliminated. Not
that the cast wasn't deserving of
the applause, but the projected
mood, if successfully put across,
should last beyond (lie doors of
the theater. Such an abrupt break
in tension adds little to this.
"The Dybuuk" will continue at
8:30 tonight and tomorrow night
in the Little Theater of Memorial
Auditor! u m and next week,
March 2-5.

that the cast wasn't deserving of
the applause, but the projected
mood, if successfully put across,

in tension adds little to this.
"The Dybuuk" will continue at
8:30 tonight and tomorrow night

Auditor! u m and next week,
March 2-5.
A mystical tale of Medieval Jewish folklore and the intense acting
of Erica Speyer combined to produce a fascinating and absorbing
drama Wednesday night in the Little Theater when the Stanford
Players opened their production of Sholem Ansky's "The Dybbuk."
Miss Speyer protrays Leah, the young girl who becomes pos-

sessed by the spirit, or dybbuk
of her predestined bridegroom
With a beautiful, haunting voice
and consistently graceful move
ments, she gave to the character
a mystical quality even before
the possession:
Through intense absorption in
the role and a startling change
of voice. Miss Speyer projected
a vivid picture of a possessed
soul which gave the play much
of its compelling and fascinating
quality.
Polish Setting
•Set in Poland during the 18th
century, the play, especially the
first act, contains frequent refer
ences to Jewish customs which
were not familiar to all the audi
ence. This, along with too much
restraint and a general lack of
feeling in several of the minor
characterizations produced a
rather slow and unnatural first
act.
Although the play is certainly
not intended to be "natural," a
little more gesture, movement
and emotion might have helped
to achieve the desired mystical
effect in this act.
However, Ihe fine characteriza
tion of Phillip Angeloff as Chan
non, the promised bridegroom,
occurred in this act. along with
the first appearance of the un
known messenger, a part well
done by Philip Halinger.
Effective Settings
But once into the play, the su
pernatural atmosphere, put for
ward initially by James Lyon's
imaginative and very effective
stage settings, deepened and per
sisted to the end, with only a few
disturbing moments, when the
mood was altered. Credit must
go to graduate student-director
Raoul Pei/.er for a skillful inter
pretation and preservation of the
mood of the play.
Forceful
The scene of the exorcism of
the dybbuk was especially mov
ing and forceful.
I wish, however, that curtain
calls after all highly dramatic
plays could be eliminated. Not
that the cast wasn't deserving of
the applause, but the projected
mood, if successfully put across,
should last beyond (lie doors of
the theater. Such an abrupt break
in tension adds little to this.
