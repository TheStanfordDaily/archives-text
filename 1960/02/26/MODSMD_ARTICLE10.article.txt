Kach year, at pre-reg time, quite a few stu
dents run into unforseen registration problems
because of lack of information. Most of them
don't know where to go to get answers to their
questions. Here is a short directory that may
help those with unanswered questions.
A student who has a question related to any
academic matter, and who doesn't know where to
take this question, may go to the Information
Office, room 111-A, Inner Quad. From there he
will be directed to the person best suited to deal
with his question.
Students with questions concerning general
studies requirements or options should see their
advisors or the General Studies secretary, Miss

in their quarterly grade reports should go to
the Recorder's Office, room 111-S in the Regis
trar's Office to have it corrected.

freshman; 40-84 units, sophomore; 85-129 units,
junior; 130 units to graduation, senior.
Some persons may change their class stand
ing in the middle of the school year, but they

to work completed during the summer or at
another school but as yet unevaluated may ar
range to register with upper division students by
