# Ike Cheered in Rain; Crash Dims Welcome

### 
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (A*) — President Eisenhower bailed his
head to the rain in Sao Paulo yesterday and beamed at the most
enthusiastic acclaim he has gotten so far on his South American
tour. A half million or more cheered him along drenched, confetti
strewn streets.
A few hours later a pall was cast over his personal triumphs

by an aerial tragedy at Rio de
Janeiro, the collision of a plane
carrying U.S. Navy bandsmen
and a Brazilian commercial craft.
The musicians were flying in to
Rio i<> appear last night at Eisen
hower's U.S. Embassy dinner for
President Juscelino Kubitschek of \
Brazil.
Eisenhower made a flying trip j
from Rio, Brazil's political capi- 1
tal, lo Sao Paulo, the industrial
capital, for an activity-packed, i
six-hour visit which, despite the I
rain, caused a stir exceeding even |
that of his official welcome here
Wednesday.
Ticker Tape
Paper and ticker tape fluttered
down from windows of thai boom
ing city of three million, 220 miles !
southwest of Rio, in salute to his
motorcade. Thousands of students
turned out.
In the wake of the procession,
Eisenhower's admirers surged in- i

to Sao Paulo's streets this gray,
wet, 70-degree day and blocked
traffic dancing, jumping and
shouting in their enthusiasms.
Eisenhower changed to a dry
suit at the residence of Sao Paulo
State's governor, Carlos Carvalho
Pinto, took a nap, then carried
on. lie laid a wreath in a drizzle
at a monument to Brazilian troops
of his command who died in Italy
in World War 11. He rapped tho
Communist sphere's economic
methods and extolled free enter
prise in a luncheon address before
1,200 businessmen and officials.
"Sheer material wealth can of
course be accumulated and scien
tific miracles achieved by author
itarian methods," he said. "But
let us not bo misled by tho boasts
which fill the air. The production
of goods either capital or con
sumer goods is not an end in it
self. • . • Faced with no other
choice, we would choose poverty
in freedom rather than prosperity
in slavery."
Half Million
There was no police estimate of
the size of the crowd. The best
guesses ran to at least half a mil
lion. That probably was fewer
than the outpouring here Wednes
day, but the Paulistas' was a
warmer and more enthusiastic
greeting.
Eisenhower flies today to Ar
gentina. the second country on his
four-nation, 10-day goodwill tour.
