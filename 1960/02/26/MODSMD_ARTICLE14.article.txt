# LASSU
## Consider Only Own Matters 
### Jerry Rankin 
Stanford's student Legislature
should stick strictly to student
affairs, LASSU members indi
cated last night by voting down,
211, a motion that the group go
on record in Sacramento approv
ing the abolition of capital punish
ment.
Kin.solving
Tuie Kinsolving. sparkplug of a
campus anti-capital punishment
drive, urged LASSU to speak out,
not as representatives of Stan
ford students, but as a legislative
group, against capital punish
ment.
Ho said that as citizens of Cali
fornia, Legislature m e m b e r s
should make their views known
as a body. Legislature did not
agree, several members arguing
that LASSU's taking a stand on
such issues might bo taken as
representative of the entire stu
dent body.
LASSU is looked on by many
people as reflecting the Stanford
student opinion, it was argued,
and thus should confine its of
ficial interests to student doings.
Capital Punishment
Capital punishment doesn't di
rectly affect students, so it would
be wrong for LASSU to act as a
gioup on the matter, some mem
bers felt.
Recent LASSU consideration of
proposals and petitions on the
disclaimer affidavit was justified
on grounds it directly affected
students, some members said.
The meeting ended with a fa
vorable vote that Lake Lag be
opened for boating sometime
after this afternoon.
