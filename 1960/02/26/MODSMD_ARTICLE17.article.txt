The 4.1 billion dollars which
the President'is asking Congress
to appropriate for mutual secur
ity, or in plainer English for for
eign aid, will help to pay for a
variety of programs in many
countries. These programs have a
common purpose. 11 is to prevent
the expansion of Communism be
yond the frontiers which it
leached before 1945 and 1954.
In Europe this frontier is the
line.of the armistice of World
War 11, including the special case
of West Berlin. In the Far East
the line is that reached by ihc
Chinese Communist revolution
when it conquered mainland
China. It is also the line of the
armistice in ihe Korean War and
the line of the armistice in the
Indo-Chinese war.
The object of American pol
icy, which was first formulated
by President Truman, is to con
tain the Russians, the Chinese,
the North Koreans, and the
Vietminliese at this frontier be
tween the two great coalitions.
The main military instrument
of this policy is the overall mili
tary power of the United States.
But in order to exert this power
efficiently, we require the sup
port of allies like Britain and
France and the use of bases in
many other countries on the
periphery of the Communist
coalition. The foreign aid pro
gram is made up in order to fi
nance those allies and other
countries who will not or can
not wholly finance themselves.
Although these programs are
all designed for the same purpose
to contain the spread of Com
munism they have become much
more sophisticated and compli
cated than they were originally.
At the time of the seizure of
Czechoslovakia in 1948, the block
ade of West Berlin in 1948, and
the attack on South Korea in
1950, our policy of mutual aid for
collective defense was directed
against overt military aggression.
In the last years of Truman and
Ihe first years of Eisenhower our
military planning was based on
the idea that what had happened
when the North Koreans invaded
South Korea was likely to happen
in Europe and in Ihe Middle East.
This was the period when Gen.
Eisenhower was the Supreme
Commander in Western Europe.
It was then I hat he approved
plans for a West European army
which would have been more than
twice as big as the best that
NATO has even been able to ac
hieve.
Since those <lays, since the
early fifties, the basic military
situation in the world has
changed greatly. The Soviet Un
ion has achieved parity in nu
clear weapons. This has reduced
our nuclear power from that of
an instrument of world diplo
macy to a national deterrent
against attack on the United
States.
At the same time the Soviet
Union has developed a high rate
of economic growth which acts
as a very powerful example and
magnet in the underdeveloped
countries. This economic ac
hievement and this concentra
tion upon economic progress in

the Soviet Union is the basis of
the Soviet campaign for a mili
tary truce in the cold war and
for disarmament.
These historic changes in the
world balance of power have af
fected deeply our task of holding
together the coalition to contain
I the spread of Communism. For
one thing, the threat and possi
bility of overt military aggression
by the Soviet Union has declined
I almost to the vanishing point.
| There is. as a result, something J
unreal about building up armies
on the Soviet frontier to fight the
: Red Army. It is unreal because
there is no likely threat from the
i Red Army and it is doubly unreal
because these armies would bo
! impotent if ihere were.
Yet, and this is a crucial al-j
though sophisticated point, in the;
j underveloped countries it is
the armies that make and un
make the governments. We have I
j learned that lesson in Iraq and
elsewhere. What is described as
military aid and defense support
in our appropriations is in a very
! considerable degree a subsidy to
i keep the army on the side of the
; government.
Since the purpose of these j
subsidies is not wholly or es
sentially military, administra
tion is often extravagant and
wasteful. Worse still, because I
of the conspicuously high stand
ard of life which prevails in the
American armed forces abroad,
our military aid is an almost
certain recipe for getting the 1
United States disliked. Never- j
theless, these subsidies are a
political necessity, and they
cannot be discontinued until
there has been organized a sub
stitute in place of them as the
source of stability.
We shall have to go on with
the subsidies for the present. But i
we should do this with a clear |
! understanding that they cannot i
go on very much longer, that the,
United States cannot expect for
the whole future to pay for a coa
lition of small client states in l
Asia.
The faint beginnings of a new
and better system to replace thej
existing one are indicated in the;
! President's message. One of the!
I indications is the emphasis he I
gives to a greater use of the)
(World Bank and other interna
j tional agencies to which the rich- 1
I or nations can contribute. Anoth- j
jer indication, and a most en- i
jcouraging one. is that economic j
| aid is not to bo scattered about
but is to be focused and directed '
\ upon key countries, particularly |
upon India, Pakistan, and Tai
wan, where there is a good pros-!
j pect of proving that poverty can
be conquered without totalitar-1
ianism.
Still another indication is to be
J found in the last two paragraphs'
i of the President's message. They

ade of West Berlin in 1948, and
the attack on South Korea in

In the last years of Truman and

military planning was based on
the idea that what had happened

South Korea was likely to happen
in Europe and in Ihe Middle East.
This was the period when Gen.
Eisenhower was the Supreme

It was then I hat he approved
plans for a West European army
which would have been more than
twice as big as the best that
NATO has even been able to ac
hieve.
Since those <lays, since the
early fifties, the basic military
situation in the world has
changed greatly. The Soviet Un
ion has achieved parity in nu
clear weapons. This has reduced
our nuclear power from that of
an instrument of world diplo
macy to a national deterrent
against attack on the United
States.
At the same time the Soviet
Union has developed a high rate
of economic growth which acts
as a very powerful example and
magnet in the underdeveloped
countries. This economic ac
hievement and this concentra
tion upon economic progress in

the Soviet Union is the basis of
the Soviet campaign for a mili
tary truce in the cold war and
for disarmament.
These historic changes in the
world balance of power have af
fected deeply our task of holding
together the coalition to contain
I the spread of Communism. For
one thing, the threat and possi
bility of overt military aggression
by the Soviet Union has declined
I almost to the vanishing point.
| There is. as a result, something J
unreal about building up armies
on the Soviet frontier to fight the
: Red Army. It is unreal because
there is no likely threat from the
i Red Army and it is doubly unreal
because these armies would bo
! impotent if ihere were.
Yet, and this is a crucial al-j
though sophisticated point, in the;
j underveloped countries it is
the armies that make and un

Since the purpose of these j
subsidies is not wholly or es

of the conspicuously high stand

American armed forces abroad,
our military aid is an almost
certain recipe for getting the 1
United States disliked. Never- j

political necessity, and they
cannot be discontinued until
there has been organized a sub

we should do this with a clear |

The 4.1 billion dollars which
the President'is asking Congress
to appropriate for mutual secur
ity, or in plainer English for for
eign aid, will help to pay for a
variety of programs in many
countries. These programs have a
common purpose. 11 is to prevent
the expansion of Communism be
yond the frontiers which it
leached before 1945 and 1954.
In Europe this frontier is the
line.of the armistice of World
War 11, including the special case
of West Berlin. In the Far East
the line is that reached by ihc
Chinese Communist revolution
when it conquered mainland
China. It is also the line of the
armistice in ihe Korean War and
the line of the armistice in the
Indo-Chinese war.
The object of American pol
icy, which was first formulated
by President Truman, is to con
tain the Russians, the Chinese,
the North Koreans, and the
Vietminliese at this frontier be
tween the two great coalitions.
The main military instrument
of this policy is the overall mili
tary power of the United States.
But in order to exert this power
efficiently, we require the sup
port of allies like Britain and
France and the use of bases in
many other countries on the
periphery of the Communist
coalition. The foreign aid pro
gram is made up in order to fi
nance those allies and other
countries who will not or can
not wholly finance themselves.
Although these programs are
all designed for the same purpose
to contain the spread of Com
munism they have become much
more sophisticated and compli
cated than they were originally.
At the time of the seizure of
Czechoslovakia in 1948, the block
ade of West Berlin in 1948, and
the attack on South Korea in
1950, our policy of mutual aid for
collective defense was directed
against overt military aggression.
In the last years of Truman and
Ihe first years of Eisenhower our
military planning was based on
the idea that what had happened
when the North Koreans invaded
South Korea was likely to happen
in Europe and in Ihe Middle East.
This was the period when Gen.
Eisenhower was the Supreme
Commander in Western Europe.
It was then I hat he approved
plans for a West European army
which would have been more than
twice as big as the best that
NATO has even been able to ac
hieve.
Since those <lays, since the
early fifties, the basic military
situation in the world has
changed greatly. The Soviet Un
ion has achieved parity in nu
clear weapons. This has reduced
our nuclear power from that of
an instrument of world diplo
macy to a national deterrent
against attack on the United
States.
At the same time the Soviet
Union has developed a high rate
of economic growth which acts
as a very powerful example and
magnet in the underdeveloped
countries. This economic ac
hievement and this concentra

the Soviet Union is the basis of

The 4.1 billion dollars which
the President'is asking Congress
to appropriate for mutual secur
ity, or in plainer English for for
eign aid, will help to pay for a
variety of programs in many
countries. These programs have a
common purpose. 11 is to prevent
the expansion of Communism be
yond the frontiers which it
leached before 1945 and 1954.
In Europe this frontier is the
line.of the armistice of World
War 11, including the special case
of West Berlin. In the Far East
the line is that reached by ihc
Chinese Communist revolution
when it conquered mainland
China. It is also the line of the
armistice in ihe Korean War and
the line of the armistice in the
Indo-Chinese war.
The object of American pol
icy, which was first formulated
by President Truman, is to con
tain the Russians, the Chinese,
the North Koreans, and the
Vietminliese at this frontier be
tween the two great coalitions.
The main military instrument
of this policy is the overall mili
tary power of the United States.
But in order to exert this power
efficiently, we require the sup
port of allies like Britain and
France and the use of bases in
many other countries on the
periphery of the Communist
coalition. The foreign aid pro
gram is made up in order to fi
nance those allies and other
countries who will not or can
not wholly finance themselves.
Although these programs are
all designed for the same purpose
to contain the spread of Com
munism they have become much
more sophisticated and compli
cated than they were originally.
At the time of the seizure of
Czechoslovakia in 1948, the block
ade of West Berlin in 1948, and
the attack on South Korea in
1950, our policy of mutual aid for
collective defense was directed
against overt military aggression.
In the last years of Truman and
Ihe first years of Eisenhower our
military planning was based on
the idea that what had happened
when the North Koreans invaded
South Korea was likely to happen
in Europe and in Ihe Middle East.
This was the period when Gen.
Eisenhower was the Supreme
Commander in Western Europe.
It was then I hat he approved
plans for a West European army
which would have been more than
twice as big as the best that
NATO has even been able to ac
hieve.
Since those <lays, since the
early fifties, the basic military
situation in the world has
changed greatly. The Soviet Un
ion has achieved parity in nu
clear weapons. This has reduced
our nuclear power from that of
an instrument of world diplo
macy to a national deterrent
against attack on the United
States.
At the same time the Soviet
Union has developed a high rate
of economic growth which acts
as a very powerful example and
magnet in the underdeveloped
countries. This economic ac
hievement and this concentra
tion upon economic progress in

the Soviet Union is the basis of
the Soviet campaign for a mili
tary truce in the cold war and
for disarmament.
These historic changes in the
world balance of power have af
fected deeply our task of holding
together the coalition to contain
I the spread of Communism. For
one thing, the threat and possi
bility of overt military aggression
by the Soviet Union has declined
I almost to the vanishing point.
| There is. as a result, something J
unreal about building up armies
on the Soviet frontier to fight the
: Red Army. It is unreal because
there is no likely threat from the
i Red Army and it is doubly unreal
because these armies would bo
! impotent if ihere were.
Yet, and this is a crucial al-j
though sophisticated point, in the;
j underveloped countries it is
the armies that make and un
make the governments. We have I
j learned that lesson in Iraq and
elsewhere. What is described as
military aid and defense support
in our appropriations is in a very
! considerable degree a subsidy to
i keep the army on the side of the
; government.
Since the purpose of these j
subsidies is not wholly or es
sentially military, administra
tion is often extravagant and
wasteful. Worse still, because I
of the conspicuously high stand
ard of life which prevails in the
American armed forces abroad,
our military aid is an almost
certain recipe for getting the 1
United States disliked. Never- j
theless, these subsidies are a
political necessity, and they
cannot be discontinued until
there has been organized a sub
stitute in place of them as the
source of stability.
We shall have to go on with
the subsidies for the present. But i
we should do this with a clear |
! understanding that they cannot i
go on very much longer, that the,
United States cannot expect for
the whole future to pay for a coa
lition of small client states in l
Asia.

and better system to replace thej
existing one are indicated in the;
