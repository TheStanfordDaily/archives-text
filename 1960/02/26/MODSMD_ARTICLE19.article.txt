## Man’s Nightmares 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
A critic once said that Tennes
see Williams is a man we pay to
dream our nightmares for us.
"Sweet Bird of Youth," his new
est, is another nightmare in a
long history of nightmares which
! progressively more violent
and progressively more shocking
as well as progressively less
j realistic.
Its theme: pessimism, the
hopeless and complete destruc
tion of youth and lite.
Its characters: Alexandra Del
; Lago, or the Princess Kosmono
, polis, a one-time movie queen who
| has reached the bottom of the
gutter in her escape from life.
Chance Wayne, youth, ambiti
ous and frustrated in both life
; and love, whose only remaining
j virtue is sex.
Boss Finley, corrupt, ruthless
I politician.
Its action: to have Chance
| castrated, to destroy the man.
The play is intended to shock,
and shock it does. It is power
fully portrayed and staged, and
its effect is one of sordid vio
lence.
As a matter of fact, two older
! women left after the second act
i Friday night, one of them com
! meriting, "Well, I've .had enough
| filth for the evening. How about
| you?"
Brooks Atkinson has suggested
that "Director Elia Kazan has
perfectly caught the sullen mood
j of the script and staged a beauti
fully modulated performance,
i Nothing about it is contrived or
i ostentatious . . . one of Williams'
; finest exercises in necromancy."
Walter Kerr wrote "This is the
noise of passion, of creative ener
gy, of exploration and adventure.
| Even in excess, it is enormously
I exciting."
Kenneth Tynan, the New
Yorker's drama critic, was .just
a little less enthusiastic:
"The staging by Kazan is op
eratic and hysterical, so is the
writing . . . none of Williams'
other plays have contained so
much rot. It is as if the author
were hypnotized by his subject
.. . Almost everything con
nected with 'Sweet Bird of
Youth' dismayed and alarmed
me."
It is obvious that such diverse
opinion must have been prompted
by a somewhat violent play.
But even in this respect the
play is weak. Its impact is blunted
considerably by the fact that its
characters are stereotyped (bril
liantly done stereotypes, but stere
otypes none the less) personifica
tions of things that are very far
1 removed from reality.
Geraldine Page, as the Prin
cess (a role for which she re
ceived the 1958-59 Variety Poll
of the New York drama critics

l for the best performance of the
year by an actress) is excellent,
She gives a marvelous rendition
of the epitome of a fallen film
stiir. The wit and pathos of her
character came through very
well, although she is not de
veloped much beyond the first
act.
As Chance Wayne, Rip Torn is
quite good, although the char
acter himself is extremely un- j
' even.
Il is very difficult to feel any
j identity with such beaten, horri- i
1 ble people. The impact of the sec- I
ond act curtain would have been |
heightened considerably by char
actors a little more human.
The tone, at any rate, is con
sistently pessimistic, and the act-
I ing and staging are on a very
high level. It is good theater if
! nothing else.
At the Curran Theater, j
• "Sweet Bird of Youth" should
be playing to a packed house
every night. Williams lias a
tremendous drawing power,
and the play is worth seeing
simply because it is Williams.
But thanks to a highly over
l priced house, the crowds are very
thin. It is unfortunate that in a|
good theater town like San Fran-1
cisco people should be forced to I
1 pay $3.20 to sit in the second
| balcony. In spite of student dis !
j counts, it is ridiculous to expect
, students, or any one else for that !
i matter, to have to stand in line
I to pay near New York prices.
