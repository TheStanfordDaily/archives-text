# Poet's Work Discussed

### JoAnn Healy 
A reading and exhibition of
Robinson Jeffers' poetry was the
subject of the Intermezzo pro
gram in the Bender Room yester
day.
( ommeiitary
Warren Ramsey, from the Uni
versity of California, read selec
tions and gave ;i commentary of
Jeffers' work. He delineated Jef
fers' place in Ihe major tradition
of American poets. Using excerpts
from"The .Roan Stallion," Ram
sey pointed up the importance of
rhythm in Jeffers' poetry.
Jeffers uses the concepts of
modern' chemistry and medicine
in works such as "Cawdor." On
the other hand, "Tamar" is a
Gothic romance in verse. In this
and other poems, Jeffers empha
sizes death.
Jeffers uses the Carmel coast
in much the same manner I hat
earlier writers of romances used
the half-ruined castles of Europe.
In "Tamar" he also evidences a
kind of dark humor as well as a
sense of history.
Parallels
Ramsey showed the close par
allels between "Cawdor" and the
Phaldra story of antiquity. In
"Cawdor" Jeffers uses the basic
forms of tragedy. To the idea of
predestination he adds the ideas
of scientific determination.
Ramsey also read from"The
Women at Point Sun," a descrip
tion of I lie Rev. Dr. Barkley, a
pastor who has lost his faith;
"Woodrow Wilson," showing Jef
fers' concept of the tragic hero,
"Hurt Hawks," in which he
brought out the idea that pain
and incapacity are hardest for
the strong to bear.
The final poem was "He Ret urn
Virtute" which gave Jeffers' pic
ture of God and the idea that,
whatever man does, ihe e.rrth is
still beautilul and yood.
