# AWS Rejects Lag Proposal
## 
### 
The AWS Cabinet Tuesday re
jected, 8-3, a proposed new consti
tution for Lagunita Court and
suggested postponement of elec
tion of officers pending further
investigation of Lagunita resi
dents' wishes.
Under the present constitution,
Lagunita is governed by an ex
ecutive board of seven officers,
including a president, two vice
presidents, a secretary, a treas
urer and the Chairman of the
Committee of Seven.
The proposed changes would
have consolidated the offices of
secretary and treasurer, and
abolished the second vice presi
dency.
