Truly Sorry
ICditor, Tin* Daily:
In reply to Mr. Plumer's'
"People forget so easily" letter,
he stated that "as a result of our
hard pressed court system, fate
granted him a reprieve." 1 would
say that the courts are the ones
that granted llie reprieve time
and time again and couldn't it
he because some people saw that j
the law can bo mistaken some- I
times, and saw that perhaps Mr.
Cht ssman had not been given due !
process of the law, because of an
alcoholic court transcriber, who
admitted making almost 2,000
mistakes?
Isn't it possible that some en- j
lightened judges of t he law real-1
ized that the un enlightened pub- |
lie was perhaps more influential
in screaming for. blood than il
should have been? This public is
the one that is quick to bring up
the fact that ". . . one of his vic
tims has been confined in an in
sane asylum for eleven years, '
. . forgetting that I he girl was
insane some five years before
hand, was committed 21 months
after the trial, and would have!
been committed anyway, accord-1
ing to her psychiatrist.
... If mankind can realize a I
wrong as opposed to a right, when I

he can realize that killing a man
to show disapproval of killing a
man is absurd, then 1 feel that
he has reachedâ€¢ an "intellectual
'plateau,'" if not maturity.
Now in the case of Houston,
are we correct in assuming with
Plumer that because there is no
death penalty that this is the
specific reason for ". . . a tre
mendously increasing murder
rate"? I don't believe so. It could
be the weather for all we know.
We can assume, however, that
from many other examples
throughout this country and the
world, that tne murder rate
wouldn't be 1 changed much if
there were capital punishment,
men! a deterrent. . . .
We do not need capital punish-

I merit; we have capital punish
j ment; and I'm sorry that we do
'with Plumer 1 hope, truly sorry.
