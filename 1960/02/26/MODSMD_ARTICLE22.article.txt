# Epic Theatre Represented In ‘The Measure Taken'
## 
### Martin Parsons 
A production of Bertolt Brecht's
" The Measure Taken'' will be pre
sented next Friday on the main
siage in the Memorial Audito
rium at 4:15.
"The play," as graduate student
director Juris Svendsen says, "is
not one written to gain the audi
ence's sympathy. On the con
trary, being openly didactic and
propagandist i<\ the playwright
asks the audience to follow the
argument presented with as un
biased a view as possible and,
after the event, come to its own
conclusions."
This is the basic premise of the
lirechtian epic theatre. The the
atre is not a showcase for the
actor's histrionics, no matter how
artistically they be exhibited, nor
should theatre attempt to seduce
the audience to the point where
the spectator becomes identified
and involved with what is recre
ated on the stage.
Brcclit has tried to strip the
stage of its seductive magic. He
has tried to bring drama back to
the simple narrative which is pre
sented and only in part enacted.
This is particularly true of the
didactic play, the "Lehrstuck."
As in "The Measure Taken," the
didactic play presents an actiorj
in narrative form, supported with
spoken and projected commen
tary.
The story of this particular play
is that of a young comrade who
had to be killed by his fellow
comrades because he had started
a local revolution prematurely.
These fellow agitators return
from their missions and report
their preventive action taken to
the controlchorus which consists
of members of the proletariat and

| which is to pass judgment on
their deed.
Telling the story to the control
chorus, the agitators also tell it
I to the audience, asking their ver-
I diet, too.
The purpose of this production
lis not to ask the audience to
accept the content or message
! of the play. Instead, it is an ex
periment with a dramatic form
which undoubtedly will be used
more and more on the American
I stage.
The epic form of drama has
been developed and used exten
; sively on the European stage with
some striking res u 1 t s. But. it
■ doesn't mean that the American
theatre should adopt it because
it is in vogue in theatrically
active Europe.
It' the theatre, anywhere, can
not and will not constantly
attempt to strive for better ways
iof communicating, then it does
not justify its existence. Today
we should have no use for an
institution that will not try to
[overcome its own incestuous
activity.
The epic theatre may not be
the answer to better eommunica
| tion, but if it can lead to a more
' communicative means between
artist and society, it should not
be disregarded or left untried.
