THE SEARCH FOR BRIDEY SIGAFOOS
It was a dullish evening at the Thcta house. The pledges were
down in the catacombs; the actives were sacked out upstairs;
not doing much of anything. Mary Ellen Krumbald was stick
ing pins in an effigy of the housemother; Evelyn Zinsmaster
was welding a manhole cover to her charm bracelet; Algelica
McKeesport was writing a letter to Fabian in blood. Like I say,
it was a dullish evening.
Suddenly Dolores Vladnav stood up and stamped her foot.
'haps," she said to her sorors, "this is too yawn-inaking! Let's
do something gay and mad and gasp-making. Anybody got an
idea?"
"No, said the sorors, shaking their little sausage curls.
"Think, chaps, think!" said Dolores and passed Marlboro
cigarettes to everybody, for if there ever was a smoke to start
you thinking, it is mild and flavorful Marlboro! Tilings come
clear when you puff that good, clean smoke through that line
filter knots untie, dilemmas dissolve, problems evaporate,
cobwebs vanish, log disperses, and the benevolent sun pours
radiance on a new and dewy world. Oh, happy world! Oh,
Marlboro! Oh, soft pack! Oh, flip-top box! Oh, get some
alreadv!

Now deraldine Quidnunc, lier drooping brain cells revivified
by a good Marlboro, leapt uj) and cried, "Oh, I have a perfect
gasser of an idea! Let's hypnotize somebody!"
"Oh, capital!'' cried the sorors. "Oh, tingle-making!"
At this point, in walked a young pledge named Alice Blue
gown. "Kxcuse me, mistresses," said she, tugging her forelock,
"1 have finished making your beds, doing your homework, and
ironing your pleats. W ill there be anything else?"
"\es," snapped Dolores Yladnay. "When I count to three,
you will be hypnotized."
"\cs, excellency,'' said Alice, bobbing a curtsey.
"One, two, three," said Dolores.
Alice promptly went into a trance.
"(lo back," said Dolores, "back into your childhood, do
hack to your fifth birthday, back to your birth, to before your
birth, to your last incarnation ... Now, who are you?"
"My name is Bridey Sigafoos," said Alice. "The year is 1818,
md I am in ('ounty Cork."
"(\>o!" said the sorors.
"lfow old are you?" asked Dolores.
"I am seven," said Alice.

"I don't know," said Alice. "JShe got sold at the fair last
rear."
"( 1 oo!" said the sorors.

do something gay and mad and gasp-making. Anybody got an
idea?"
"No, said the sorors, shaking their little sausage curls.
"Think, chaps, think!" said Dolores and passed Marlboro
cigarettes to everybody, for if there ever was a smoke to start
you thinking, it is mild and flavorful Marlboro! Tilings come
clear when you puff that good, clean smoke through that line
filter knots untie, dilemmas dissolve, problems evaporate,
cobwebs vanish, log disperses, and the benevolent sun pours
radiance on a new and dewy world. Oh, happy world! Oh,
Marlboro! Oh, soft pack! Oh, flip-top box! Oh, get some
alreadv!

Now deraldine Quidnunc, lier drooping brain cells revivified
by a good Marlboro, leapt uj) and cried, "Oh, I have a perfect
gasser of an idea! Let's hypnotize somebody!"
"Oh, capital!'' cried the sorors. "Oh, tingle-making!"
At this point, in walked a young pledge named Alice Blue

not doing much of anything. Mary Ellen Krumbald was stick
