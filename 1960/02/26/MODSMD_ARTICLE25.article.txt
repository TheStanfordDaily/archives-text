# AUDIOLOGY COURSE
## Speech Therapy Sees Expansion 
### Lois Root 
With its new facilities in the
Medical School, the Division of
Speech Pathology and Audiology
is now expanding its twofold pro
gram of rehabilitation and edu
cation.
To utilize this new expansion,
the department invites all stu
dents interested in speech and
hearing therapy, and speech sci
ences to enroll in its introduc
tory course offered Spring Quar
ter.
In its move from the Knoll, the
Division has more than doubled
its floor space and has portioned
out most of this added room for
th e r a p y rooms with adjoining
observational rooms where par
ents and others may watch the
therapist work in the other room.
By these means, students taking
the introductory course will have
a chance to observe therapeutic
sessions, according to Miss .To
Eeckhout, Assistant CI in i ca 1
Supervisor.
Gaining' ( onl idenee
Since most of the patients com
ing to the clinic are children,
many rooms are equipped with
small tables and chairs, low black
boards and toys so that the chil
dren will feel at home and in a
pleasant atmosphere. It is this
personal work of gaining the
child's confidence which often is
most rewarding, some therapy
•students feel.
In addition to clinical work at
Stanf or d, students enrolled in
Speech Pathology and Audiology
60 go on field trips to private
clinics, hospital sand public
schools for observing children
with problems due to impaired
hearing, cleft palate, cerebral
palsy, and retarded speech devel
opment.
Lectures Given
Rehabilitation students at the
Stanford Center will also be using
seminar and lecture rooms and
the privately endowed library con
taining books in speech and hear
ing and related fields of psycho
logy, education, the physical sci
ences and medicine.
Lectures will be given by all
department professors according
to their major fields of interest:
Dr. Virgil A. Anderson, Director,
speech: Dr. Hayes A. New by,
hearing: Dr. Dorothy Hunting
ton, voice science and phonetics;
and Dr. Robert Duffy and Miss
Eeckhout, clinical work.
The Center has also increased
its electrical equipment for test
ing and recording therapeutic
sessions tape recorders, speeto
graphs producing shaded visible
pictures of speech, and oscillo
scopes recording the wave pat
tern of the sounds made by the
patient.
Hearing Tests
For hearing tests, the Division
uses the standard pure-tone audi
ometer which delivers pure tone
signals to the patient who indi
cates whether or not he hears the
stimulus and also the speech
audiometer which enables the

tester to determine at what level
the patient is able to understand
speech.
Such hearing tests are done in
"dead" rooms where sound has
been minimized by rugs, acoustic
wall board, and thick walls and
doors. Two of these rooms are
part of the clinical plant and the
third is a part of the experimen
tal phonetics laboratory where
research is done with normal
speech and hearing. "After all,
we must know what no rm a 1
speech and hearing are before we
can determine what abnormal sit
nations are, and what to do about
them," explained Miss Eeckhout.
Requirements
Stanford's program for a BA
degree in Speech Pathology and
Audiology is a two-year program;
a minor in psychology or educa
tion is recommended. This sched
ule includes 200 hours of clinical
work, part of which is face-to
face therapy with the patients,
writing of reports, and confer
ences with parents and teachers
of patients.
Certification with the American
Speech and Hearing Association
is also necessary; academic re
quirements for this certification
are fulfilled with the granting of
the BA degree and one year's
clinical experience is required to
obtain basic certification.
The need for speech therapists
is easily seen when one considers
that for 8 million Americans with
speech and hearing problems
approximately 2 thousand thera
pists are now available where,
according to statistics, a mini
mum of 32 thousand is necessary.
And significantly lacking are col
lege professors with doctorate
degrees for teaching in this, de
partment — in recent years about
37 degrees annually have been
granted.
Taking these statistics into
account, the Stanford Medical
School Division of Speech Pathol
ogy and Audiology will be" offer
ing the introductory course,
S. P. and A. 60, Thursday. 3-5, dur
ing spring quarter.

sessions, according to Miss .To
Eeckhout, Assistant CI in i ca 1
Supervisor.
Gaining' ( onl idenee
Since most of the patients com
ing to the clinic are children,
many rooms are equipped with
small tables and chairs, low black
boards and toys so that the chil
dren will feel at home and in a
pleasant atmosphere. It is this
personal work of gaining the
child's confidence which often is
most rewarding, some therapy
•students feel.
In addition to clinical work at
Stanf or d, students enrolled in
Speech Pathology and Audiology
60 go on field trips to private
clinics, hospital sand public
schools for observing children
with problems due to impaired
hearing, cleft palate, cerebral
palsy, and retarded speech devel
opment.
Lectures Given
Rehabilitation students at the
Stanford Center will also be using
seminar and lecture rooms and
the privately endowed library con
taining books in speech and hear
ing and related fields of psycho
logy, education, the physical sci
ences and medicine.
Lectures will be given by all
department professors according
to their major fields of interest:
Dr. Virgil A. Anderson, Director,
speech: Dr. Hayes A. New by,
hearing: Dr. Dorothy Hunting
ton, voice science and phonetics;
and Dr. Robert Duffy and Miss
Eeckhout, clinical work.
The Center has also increased
its electrical equipment for test
ing and recording therapeutic
sessions tape recorders, speeto
graphs producing shaded visible
pictures of speech, and oscillo
scopes recording the wave pat
tern of the sounds made by the
patient.
Hearing Tests
For hearing tests, the Division
uses the standard pure-tone audi
ometer which delivers pure tone
signals to the patient who indi
cates whether or not he hears the
stimulus and also the speech
audiometer which enables the

tester to determine at what level
the patient is able to understand
speech.
Such hearing tests are done in
"dead" rooms where sound has
been minimized by rugs, acoustic
wall board, and thick walls and
doors. Two of these rooms are
part of the clinical plant and the
third is a part of the experimen
tal phonetics laboratory where
research is done with normal
speech and hearing. "After all,
we must know what no rm a 1
speech and hearing are before we
can determine what abnormal sit
nations are, and what to do about
them," explained Miss Eeckhout.
Requirements
Stanford's program for a BA
degree in Speech Pathology and
Audiology is a two-year program;
a minor in psychology or educa
tion is recommended. This sched
ule includes 200 hours of clinical
work, part of which is face-to
face therapy with the patients,
writing of reports, and confer
ences with parents and teachers
of patients.
Certification with the American
Speech and Hearing Association
is also necessary; academic re
quirements for this certification
are fulfilled with the granting of
the BA degree and one year's
clinical experience is required to
obtain basic certification.
The need for speech therapists
is easily seen when one considers
that for 8 million Americans with
speech and hearing problems
approximately 2 thousand thera
pists are now available where,
according to statistics, a mini
mum of 32 thousand is necessary.
And significantly lacking are col
lege professors with doctorate
degrees for teaching in this, de
partment — in recent years about
37 degrees annually have been
granted.
Taking these statistics into
account, the Stanford Medical
School Division of Speech Pathol
ogy and Audiology will be" offer
ing the introductory course,
S. P. and A. 60, Thursday. 3-5, dur
ing spring quarter.
With its new facilities in the
Medical School, the Division of
Speech Pathology and Audiology
is now expanding its twofold pro
gram of rehabilitation and edu
cation.
To utilize this new expansion,
the department invites all stu
dents interested in speech and
hearing therapy, and speech sci
ences to enroll in its introduc
tory course offered Spring Quar
ter.
In its move from the Knoll, the
Division has more than doubled
its floor space and has portioned
out most of this added room for
th e r a p y rooms with adjoining
observational rooms where par
ents and others may watch the
therapist work in the other room.
By these means, students taking
the introductory course will have
a chance to observe therapeutic
sessions, according to Miss .To

palsy, and retarded speech devel
opment.
Lectures Given
Rehabilitation students at the
Stanford Center will also be using
seminar and lecture rooms and
the privately endowed library con
taining books in speech and hear
ing and related fields of psycho
logy, education, the physical sci
ences and medicine.
Lectures will be given by all
department professors according
to their major fields of interest:
Dr. Virgil A. Anderson, Director,
speech: Dr. Hayes A. New by,
hearing: Dr. Dorothy Hunting
ton, voice science and phonetics;
and Dr. Robert Duffy and Miss
Eeckhout, clinical work.
The Center has also increased
its electrical equipment for test
ing and recording therapeutic
sessions tape recorders, speeto
graphs producing shaded visible
pictures of speech, and oscillo
scopes recording the wave pat
tern of the sounds made by the
patient.
Hearing Tests
For hearing tests, the Division
uses the standard pure-tone audi
ometer which delivers pure tone
signals to the patient who indi
cates whether or not he hears the
stimulus and also the speech
audiometer which enables the

tester to determine at what level
the patient is able to understand
speech.
Such hearing tests are done in
"dead" rooms where sound has
been minimized by rugs, acoustic
wall board, and thick walls and
doors. Two of these rooms are
part of the clinical plant and the
third is a part of the experimen
tal phonetics laboratory where
research is done with normal
speech and hearing. "After all,
we must know what no rm a 1
speech and hearing are before we
can determine what abnormal sit
nations are, and what to do about
them," explained Miss Eeckhout.
Requirements
Stanford's program for a BA
degree in Speech Pathology and
Audiology is a two-year program;
a minor in psychology or educa
tion is recommended. This sched
ule includes 200 hours of clinical
work, part of which is face-to
face therapy with the patients,
writing of reports, and confer
ences with parents and teachers
of patients.
Certification with the American
Speech and Hearing Association
is also necessary; academic re
quirements for this certification
are fulfilled with the granting of
the BA degree and one year's
clinical experience is required to
obtain basic certification.
The need for speech therapists
is easily seen when one considers
that for 8 million Americans with
speech and hearing problems
approximately 2 thousand thera
pists are now available where,
according to statistics, a mini
mum of 32 thousand is necessary.
And significantly lacking are col
lege professors with doctorate
degrees for teaching in this, de
partment — in recent years about
37 degrees annually have been
granted.
Taking these statistics into
account, the Stanford Medical
School Division of Speech Pathol
ogy and Audiology will be" offer
ing the introductory course,
S. P. and A. 60, Thursday. 3-5, dur
ing spring quarter.
With its new facilities in the
Medical School, the Division of
Speech Pathology and Audiology
is now expanding its twofold pro
gram of rehabilitation and edu
cation.
To utilize this new expansion,
the department invites all stu
dents interested in speech and
hearing therapy, and speech sci
ences to enroll in its introduc
tory course offered Spring Quar
ter.
In its move from the Knoll, the
Division has more than doubled
its floor space and has portioned
out most of this added room for
th e r a p y rooms with adjoining
observational rooms where par
ents and others may watch the
therapist work in the other room.
By these means, students taking
the introductory course will have
a chance to observe therapeutic
sessions, according to Miss .To
Eeckhout, Assistant CI in i ca 1
Supervisor.
Gaining' ( onl idenee
Since most of the patients com
ing to the clinic are children,
many rooms are equipped with
small tables and chairs, low black
boards and toys so that the chil
dren will feel at home and in a
pleasant atmosphere. It is this
personal work of gaining the
child's confidence which often is
most rewarding, some therapy
•students feel.
In addition to clinical work at
Stanf or d, students enrolled in
Speech Pathology and Audiology
60 go on field trips to private
clinics, hospital sand public
schools for observing children
with problems due to impaired
hearing, cleft palate, cerebral
palsy, and retarded speech devel
opment.
