# U.S. 20th Century Design Currently on Exhibit in SF

### Frances von Briesen 
"An exhibition of the articles
of our time of the parapher
nalia of everyday life as they
have developed in the 1 United
States during the first half of the
20th century" is currently at the
San Francisco Museum of Art.
The design exhibit was the sub
ject of a Student Art Association
lecture last Friday by Stanford's
Robert McKim of the industrial
design department.
The exhibit, which continues
through next week, is composed
of about 2,500 articles, from
jungle jims and sauce pans, most
of which are now available and
many of which are so familiar
that they are taken for granted.
Fine Arts
McKim opened his talk by com
paring industrial design to the
line arts. A painting is intimate,
single, identifiable by a personal
style, whereas products of indus
trial design, with the exception
of craft objects, are produced in
great quant it y, are probably
never touched by the designer,
and are more socially oriented.
Industrial design s ho u 1 d be
suited to satisfy the whole man,
physically, intellectually and emo
tionally. Physically, a chair must
be comfortable. Intellectually, it
must communicate through visual
clarity of function, structure and
material.
A ppropriate
But the emotional reaction
should be appropriate to the prod
uct. Science attempts to reject
emotion, to be rational; therefore
scientific instruments should be
be more intellectually - oriented
than objects for personal use.
Rococco ornament, although too
emotional for most of us today,
expresses a very humanistic view
of life: man with the machine as
his servant.
Contemporary design, however,
showing off our technological ad
vancement. often loses this hu
man element in the process. This
characteristic is e s p e c i a 11 y

marked in the sections on kitchen
ulensils and children's toys.
The pieces in tHis show have
withstood the test of time, indeed
an accomplishment in a society
continually urged to give up last
year's model. The museum calls
them "a stable vocabulary of vis
ual symbols," which represent
the values of the 20th century.
Honest Critique
If this be true, the show is
most valuable as an honest cri
tique of our times, and, as such,
as well worth seeing. We seem
tu have made an absolute of the
Bauhaus revolution of the early
1900's, which stressed functional
ism as the only honest beauty.
In vain, here, one looks for
warmth and co/.ines and fantasy.
Practically every item stems from
a simple geometric form; geome
try is, a rational discipline, not a
humanistic one.
There are a few notable excep
tions to this overall impression;
these, interestingly, are the pieces
touched by the style of a given
designer; Eames, Saaranin, No
gouchi. There are also some beau
tiful pieces of glass and wood,
which certainly do gain from be
ing simply formed of natural ma
terials. But steel is not glass.
Must we be told, "This is steel,
and this is what machines do to
steel" when we see it ?
Mass Production
McKim feels that we have made
notable achievements in design
which now need to be modified
without losing the ground gained.
Methods of mass production have
brought more items within public
reach than ever before; the prin
cipals of functionalism have
allowed artists to see the natural
beauty and value of simple form
and honest material, sans decor.
But we have reached the point
of sterility. A style can't last for
ever which eliminates the basic
human appetite for decoration.
There is no security and indeed
no personality in a picture win
dow or a geometric form.
