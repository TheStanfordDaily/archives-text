Dr. W. F. Albright told GOO
people in Memorial Chu r ch
yesterday that the Dead Sea
Scrolls fill the chronological gap
in Jewish literature "between ihe
Old Testament and Iho beginning
of the New Testament."
Since the Essenes, who wrote
Ihe Dead Sea Scrolls, were Jew
ish, this helps prove that the
background of the New Testa
ment is Jewish and not Greek.
There are, however, two basic
differences betw e en Essenic
thought and early C hr is t i a n
thought, according to Al
bright. John the Baptist, an Es
scne, rcaeled against the monas
tic Essenes when he taught "that
people should live in the world
and not apart from it."
Albright also s aid t hat
although the Essenes had many
of the ideas of the Christian
church, they did not have the
"mystery of salvation through
Christ."
A 1 b r i g h t also believes that
the Essenic background for the
New Testament proves that the
New Testament was "all written
within 30 years and was finished
by the year 80."
This means that "the New Tes
tament did not evolve. II reflects
the immediate reaction of the
followers of Jesus to their Mas
ter."
Albright also stressed that
every book of the New Testament
was written by a man of Jewish
background. "Many other schol
ars do not agree with me, at least
not yet."
Albright is the man who
first identified the Dead Sea
Scrolls. He is recognized by Cath
olic, Protestant and Jewish schol
ars as an outstanding authority
in the field of Biblical back
ground.
