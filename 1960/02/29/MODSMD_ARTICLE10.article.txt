# Border Dispute Conference Set
## 
### 
TOKYO (/P) — Premier Chou En-lai of Red China has agreed to
meet Prime Minister Nehru in New Delhi in April in an attempt
to settle their angry border dispute "in friendly and peaceful
manner."
Announcing this yesterday, Radio Peiping reported Chou sent

Nehru a note saying the Chinese
government "takes a positive at
titude toward the forthcoming
meeting and has confidence in it."
In accepting the Nehru invita
tion, Chou's note, dated Feb. 26,
said he hoped "to see the dark
clouds hovering between our two
countries dispersed through our
joint efforts, so that the long
standing friendly relations be
tween the two countries may be
consolidated and developed."
Conflicting Claims
Nehru had suggested a meeting
in March. But Chou said that
"owing to reasons in connection
with state affairs, 1 shall come to
your country in April." A specific
date will be set later.
Thus, after months of wrang
ling through exchanges of notes
and letters, the two leaders will
meet face to face and discuss
their conflicting claims to 51,000
square miles of mountainous ter
ritory on the frontier.
While Chou professed some op
timism, Nehru, in his note Feb. 5
suggesting they get together in
New Delhi, took a darker view.
"For the moment," Nehru
wrote, "I do not see any com
mon ground between our respec
tive standpoints. Still. I think it
might be helpful for us to meet."
Preferred to Wait
Chou first proposed in a letter
last Dec. 18 that he and Nehru
meet Dec. 26 either in Communist
China, Rangoon or elsewhere.
Nehru rejected the Chinese pro
posal, describing Chou's letter as
"merely a reiteration of claims
to extensive areas of our terri
tory."
Nehru said he preferred to wait
until Chou fully explained Chi
nese claims.
Involved are 36,000 square miles
in the northeast and 15,000 square
miles on the Ladakh plateau 1,000
miles farther west that are
claimed by India.
Chinese troops still occupy ter
ritory on both the Ladakh and
northeast frontiers.

posal, describing Chou's letter as
"merely a reiteration of claims
to extensive areas of our terri
tory."
Nehru said he preferred to wait
until Chou fully explained Chi
nese claims.
Involved are 36,000 square miles
in the northeast and 15,000 square
miles on the Ladakh plateau 1,000
miles farther west that are
claimed by India.
Chinese troops still occupy ter
ritory on both the Ladakh and
northeast frontiers.
TOKYO (/P) — Premier Chou En-lai of Red China has agreed to
meet Prime Minister Nehru in New Delhi in April in an attempt
to settle their angry border dispute "in friendly and peaceful
manner."
Announcing this yesterday, Radio Peiping reported Chou sent

Nehru a note saying the Chinese
government "takes a positive at
titude toward the forthcoming
meeting and has confidence in it."
In accepting the Nehru invita
tion, Chou's note, dated Feb. 26,
said he hoped "to see the dark
clouds hovering between our two
countries dispersed through our
joint efforts, so that the long
standing friendly relations be
tween the two countries may be
consolidated and developed."
Conflicting Claims
Nehru had suggested a meeting
in March. But Chou said that
"owing to reasons in connection
with state affairs, 1 shall come to
your country in April." A specific
date will be set later.
Thus, after months of wrang
ling through exchanges of notes
and letters, the two leaders will
meet face to face and discuss
their conflicting claims to 51,000
square miles of mountainous ter
ritory on the frontier.
While Chou professed some op
timism, Nehru, in his note Feb. 5
suggesting they get together in
New Delhi, took a darker view.
"For the moment," Nehru
wrote, "I do not see any com
mon ground between our respec
tive standpoints. Still. I think it
might be helpful for us to meet."
Preferred to Wait
Chou first proposed in a letter
last Dec. 18 that he and Nehru
meet Dec. 26 either in Communist
China, Rangoon or elsewhere.
Nehru rejected the Chinese pro
posal, describing Chou's letter as
"merely a reiteration of claims
to extensive areas of our terri
tory."
