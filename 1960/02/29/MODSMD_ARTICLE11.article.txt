## 
### Jerry Isenberg 
A Stanford associate professor
and a Los Altos lawyer held a
debate on capital punishment
Friday night before nearly 100
people in Kepler's Bookstore.
Taking the affirmative was
Richard Pantell, Associate Pro
fessor of Electrical Engineering.
He surrounded his critical argu
ment that the grounds for in
voking capital punishment are
emotional and cannot be logically
defended with several statistics
intended to demonstrate the in
effectiveness of the death penalty
as a deterrent to crime.
Lawyer Park Chamberlain
opposed Pantell's point of view,
claiming that capital punishment
is "a weapon necessary to pro
tect fundamental human liber
ties." He emphasized that fear
of suffering execution at the
hands of the state is an effective
deterrent.
After the semi-formal debate,
questions from the audience
brought both men to agreement
on the matter of a need for the
revising of the American judicial
system and for the effecting of
a more equitable protection of
individual rights.
