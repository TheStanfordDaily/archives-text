"Diplomacy, rather than armed
: forces, is now our most important
I means for defense. Our survival
depends on our foreign policy,"
stated Political Science Professor
Graham Stuart yesterday evening
at Ihe Sigma Nu House.
In answer to the title of his
j talk, "Who Makes Our Foreign
: Policy?" he stressed the import -
j ance of the part played by the
, president. As historical examples
of the strong effect of presi
dential policies, Stuart cited the
Monroe Doctrine and Washing
ton's isolationism.
Ike's Effect Strong
Currently Eisenhower's policies
are affecting strongly our foreign
relations, particularly his policies
of supplying countries with arms
to resist communism if they re
quest them.
Three powers implementing the
president's position are his pow
. ers to make appointments, recog
nize foreign government, and
enter into executive agreements.
I Stuart pointed out the importance
of these executive agreements,
! noting that over 1,800 have been
made in the last 2.i years, includ
i ing the Korean Armistice and the
Berlin Blockade.
Powers ('becked
The president's powers are of
course checked, Stuart continued,
by such things as the Senate For
eign Relations Committee and the
j House Foreign Affairs Committee
■ and the Senate's power to approve
j appointments and treaties, but:
the final responsibility lies main
ly with the president.
Stuart believes that this is good
since it "allows the efficiency
which Senate hassles prevent.
However, he felt that one area
needing improvement was in get
ting experienced men in high dip
j lomatic offices. Often secretaries
of State and almost always am
bassadors are oppointed for polit
| ical reasons, a situation which
j should be changed.
