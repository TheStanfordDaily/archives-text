### 
Thursdax"s performance of Lepislature demonstrated once
more why the name Associated S11»(I«»111s of Stanford Universitx
rinps so hollow. By a vote of I 1-2 against expressing an opinion
on capital punishment, the Legislature once apain declined to
fulfill its function of leadership in ideas as well as in administra
tion.
I'reseiil Legislature members claim that lhe\ were not elected
to express student opinion on anything not directlx coneerninp
Stanford and the student hodx as a whole.
(.an they really helieve that Stanford students do not have an
opinion on anything other than the prohlenis which arise within
our own preen acres? Or is this not in fact a rationalization to
cover up the Legislature's lonp standing default iu the realm of
ideas.
Legislature niemhers are supposedlx iu direct eoutael with the
students the\ represent. II tlicx pull their constitucncies on the
question of a new student union or the question of mid-terms,
why not also on the question of capital punishment or am other
local, state, or national issue about which students feel stronply?
\\ ho is to draw the line, or more specifically, why should the
line he drawn'{
The line should not he drawn because leadership, which the
ASS LI constitution claims to be the base rock foundation of our
student poxernnient, embraces ideas as well as committees. And
ideas do not stop at the west end of Lake Lap nor at 1.1 (.amino.
Because the line has been drawn for sex era I years, the Leg
islature lias developed the habit of actinp and thinkinp in a
cramped manner.

Moreover, when Lepislature finally did concern itself xvitli an
important issue such as the disclaimer affidavit, it was almost a

then il was only after overeoininp the reluctance of some mem

I he Lepislature will remain a truncated, hall-alive orpaniza
