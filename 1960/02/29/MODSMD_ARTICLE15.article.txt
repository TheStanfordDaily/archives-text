Bad Thing
Editor, The Daily:
In Thursday's edition of The
Daily you published two letters
written by supporters of capital
punishmentâ€”or at least of Cali
fornia law.
One, by Bill Plumer, claimed
that capital punishment was a
deterrent to would-be criminals.
The other, by George Keating, de
manded that Governor Brown
should be impeached for failing
to uphold state law. . . .
Where do the people who talk
of the deterrent effect of capital
punishment get their statistics?
Perhaps fear of the gas chamber
may keep Mr. Plumer and Mr.
Keating from murdering us all in
our beds, but they (one hopes)
are not the type to murder in the
first place.
Just what that type may be is
doubtful, but even the numerous
psychopathic cases should be
enough to seriously question any
law which says "gas the lot." I
know of no psychologist who has
argued that psychopaths can he
at all deterred from murder by
the threat of capital punishment.
If then, some murderers are
mentally diseased and all may
be then a law which attempts to
treat them as rational beings is
stupid and ineffectual and merits
reform. . . .
It is a sad argument to say
that since this is an ugly world
we must meet it with ugliness;
some of use are hopeful of a
change for the better. Retributive
punishment seems to me an evil
and bad thing.

The Executioner
Editor, The Daily:
I froze, . *
For very faintly in my ear,
Alarming, for it seemed quite
near,
A little cry so strangely clear
Arose.
I knew
For I had studied human
thought
Atid how by nerves it is besot,
That what I'd heard was surely
not
So new.
So Ihen,
Assured that nothing had
transpired,
But only that I'd grown quite
tiled,
I threw the switch and life
expired
Again.

Personal Inadequacy
Editor, The Daily:
Re: the recent letter of Mr.
Ferruh Demirmen regretting the
general attitude and reaction of
the majority of the audience to
"The Dairy of Anne Frank."
It is my contention that the stu
dent disturbances at the Sunday
Flicks are a fairly good indication
of the quality of the movie being
presented; the less entertaining or
thought-provoking the film, the
more noticeable and vigorous the
sideshow.
On this occasion, either Memo
rial Auditorium was considerably
quieter than usual, or else I was
so concerned with the seriousness
and dramatic impact of the film
that I was unaware of the gen
eral reaction.
The laughter I heard was
laughter of relief in response to
a momentary relaxation of ten
sions within the drama. It indi
cated not a contempt for the
theme or a lack of perception but
a sincere need for a temporary
release from extreme intellectual
and emotional involvement.
I cannot speak for the Ameri
can youth in general to defend it
against a charge of smug com
placency, but I do know that the
majority of the students with
whom I discussed "The Dairy of
Anne Frank" are concerned with
the problem of human suffering
and injustice.
The feeling with which they
left the auditorium was one of
personal inadequacy caused by
the movie's lack of presentation
of a pathway to follow in con
verting their compassion and
sympathy into an active solution
of the problem of the misery of
the oppressed people of the world.

Both Sides
Editor, The Daily:
Recently, a very complete dis
play advocating the discontinu
ance of nuclear testing was put
on the main stairs of the Library.
The question I raise is not
whether this typo of display is
proper in an institution dedicated
to giving students complete in
formation. I feel that a display
should be of an informative na
ture, either disassociated with
controversial issues, or present
ing both sides.
In the issue of capital punish
ment, too, if one side is to be
heard, the other side should also
he presented perhaps in a de
bate.
