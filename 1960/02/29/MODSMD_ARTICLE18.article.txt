Like the weather "disarma
merit" is a subject about which
we all talk and do nothing. A new
round of talks is to begin next
month. But there is not now an
American plan. There is no Allied
plan, and in truth despite Mr. K.'s
speech at the U.N., there is no So
viet plan.
Apart from a few small specific
proposals, Western thinking is
based on a condition which it is
impossible to fulfill namely,
that there should be universal
and unlimited inspection of all
armaments. The Soviet proposals
rest on an equally invalid and un
real condition, which is that all
nations should disarm totally be
cause they trust one another com
pletely.
The unreality of the disarma
ment policy arises from an agree
ment among the powers which
flies in the face of the lessons of
i experience. This is the agreement
i that they will try to negotiate dis
armament before they negotiate
I settlements of the issues which
divide them. This cannot be clone.
: The powers will not and cannot
I disarm while they are in conflict
on vital issues, such as the future
i of Germany and the future of
Japan.
They do not mean to disarm
| while the vital issues a re unre
solved, and for the time being
| there is no real prospect that
I they are ready to negotiate scri-
S ously about the vital issues.
The powers are in a traffic jam
where they cannot move forward
1 and they will not.move backward.
The jam has become increasingly
; snarled owing to the delay in pro
ceeding with the negotiations
j which were inaugurated with such
fanfare last summer.
In his address to the National
Press Club last week Secretary
Herter stated that we have two
major goals. The first is "urgent
ly to try to create a more stable
military environment." If that
i can be done, and only if it can
be done, will we proceed to our
I second goal which is to cut na
tional armed forces-and to build
up international machinery to
the peace.
"A more stable military en
vironment" is a new and interest
ing phrase in the tired language
of disarmament. What does it
mean? It means to establish safe
guards against surprise attacks,
j What safeguards? According to
i our official doctrine in the field

'of disarmament, Ihe safeguard
would life in Ihe right and the
capacity to inspect, to watch, and
to investigate the conduct of the
great military establishments.
This is about as easy to accom
plish as it is to establish a colony
on the moon.
There is ,however, another doc
trine, a basic strategic doctrine,
which holds that the true safe
guard against surprise attack
lies in measures to make it im
possible to knock out the re
taliatory power by surprise at
tack. If, for example, we had a
fleet of submarines armed with
Polaris missiles, we would have
an invulnerable retaliatory power.
If we had it. there could be no
surprise attack upon this country.
It is interesting to note that
the military strategic doctrine,
i which is generally held by the Air
Force and by the Navy, is also the
Soviet military strategic doctrine.
In his recent speech to the 21st
Congress, Mr. K. discussed at
some length the problem of sur
prise attack. Hi-s view was that
a surprise attack could not be
successful against a very big
! country.
In any event, the Soviet doc
: trine on surprise attack is that
the true safeguard against it i« to
. possess an invulnerable retalia
tory power. Whatever we may say
in our diplomatic discussion of
disarmament, our working doe
trine is also based on the invulner
able deterrent. I have the feeling
that we would get on better even
with Mr. K. if we said so.
