# Choice of Means of Suicide Portrayedin 'On the Beach'
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
The motion picture screen has
probably never presented as docu
mented a study of how people
will choose to die as il does in
"On the Beach."
The northern half of the world
has nuclear bombed itself out of
existence (the time is 1964 > and
it remains for each individual in
the southern half (Australia most
ly i to decide whether he will wait
for the fallout to reach him or
whether he will choose his own
manner of extinction.
Anthony Perkins, for instance,
pulls every string he can to latch
on to some poison Ihat is taste
less in tea or milk which he ad
ministers to his wife, baby and
self.
Yoeman Swain, one of the crcw
members on Gregory Peck's sub
ma line decides to die where he
was born, in San Francisco. He
looks through the periscope at a
deserted Geary Street, quietly
climbs out of the surfaced sub
marine and swims into the City.
Thoughtfully the sub waits to
see if he will change his mind,
but the nexi morning he rows
out into the ocean with a fishing
pole and a case of beer to wait
for the radiation to end it all.
Most San Franciscans will agree
that there are worse ways to go.
Fred Astaire, who has all the
good lines in the movie, screws a

plaque proclaiming him the win
ner of the Australian Gran Prix
onto his Ferrari, stuffs rags into
the crack below the door of his
small garage, turns on the engine
and waits for the carbon mon
oxide.
Gregory Peck lets his crewmen
take a vote and they decided to go
back to the USA to die, thereby
preventing Peck from being able
to die in Ava Gardner's arms. A
noble gesture.
Miss Gardner, who has never
looked worse nor acted better,
waves goodby, goes back home
and probably gets off the wagon
she has been on in a hurry.
As Astaire says halfway
through the movie, "The war
started when people thought that
the way to keep peace was for
every country to make weapons
that they couldn't use, unless
they wanted to commit suicide."
