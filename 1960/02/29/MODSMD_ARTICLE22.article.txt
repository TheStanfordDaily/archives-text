# Cagers Drop One To Improved USC
## Daily Sports 
### Vic Affolter 
Southern California recoiled
from two provious defeats by
Stanford and salvaged the third
and final game of their Big Five
competition by handing the In
dians a 59-53 loss in the Pavilion
Friday night.
John Windsor of Stanford paced
all scorers with IT points. How
ever the Trojans, led by Jim
White's 15 points, had four men
in the double figures.
Stanford faced an uphill battle
most of the way as the Trojans
took the lead at 14-15 five min
utes into the game and never re
linquished it.
Indians Threaten
The Indians threatened with
five minutes left in the game.
Neal Brockmeyer dropped in two
tree throws to bring Stanford
within two points of the visitors
at 12-44. However USC came roar
ing back as guard Steve Kemp
fired in five straight points fol
lowed by two baskets by forward
John Rudometkin to widen their
lead to 42-53. This II point Tro
jan advantage proved too much
for Stanford to overcome in the
final minutes of play.
The game started quickly as
each team traded baskets until
Stanford, sparked by an eight
point surge by Windsor, gained
a 14-11 lead. USC then hit eight
straight points to go into a 14-19
lead. The half ended with the In
dians on the short side of a 20-25
score.
Arrillaga Scores
John Arrillaga hit two free
throws and John Hendry added
a field goal to make the score
25-26 early in the second stanza.
Two quick baskets by the Tro
jans' White canceled this and the
visitors enjoyed at least a two
point lead for the rest of the
game.
Statistic wise the two teams
were nearly even. Each team
snared 21 rebounds in the first
half and 23 in the second for a
game total of 44. Neal Brock
meyer led Stanford rebounders
with 11. while John Rudometkin's
13 was high for USC.

jan advantage proved too much
for Stanford to overcome in the
final minutes of play.
The game started quickly as
each team traded baskets until
Stanford, sparked by an eight
point surge by Windsor, gained
a 14-11 lead. USC then hit eight
straight points to go into a 14-19
lead. The half ended with the In
dians on the short side of a 20-25
score.
Arrillaga Scores
John Arrillaga hit two free
throws and John Hendry added
a field goal to make the score
25-26 early in the second stanza.
Two quick baskets by the Tro
jans' White canceled this and the
visitors enjoyed at least a two
point lead for the rest of the
game.
Statistic wise the two teams
were nearly even. Each team
snared 21 rebounds in the first
half and 23 in the second for a
game total of 44. Neal Brock

with 11. while John Rudometkin's
13 was high for USC.

JOHN WINDSOR
Southern California recoiled
from two provious defeats by
Stanford and salvaged the third
and final game of their Big Five
competition by handing the In
dians a 59-53 loss in the Pavilion
Friday night.
John Windsor of Stanford paced
all scorers with IT points. How
ever the Trojans, led by Jim
White's 15 points, had four men
in the double figures.
Stanford faced an uphill battle
most of the way as the Trojans
took the lead at 14-15 five min
utes into the game and never re
linquished it.
Indians Threaten
The Indians threatened with
five minutes left in the game.
Neal Brockmeyer dropped in two
tree throws to bring Stanford
within two points of the visitors
at 12-44. However USC came roar
ing back as guard Steve Kemp
fired in five straight points fol
lowed by two baskets by forward
John Rudometkin to widen their
