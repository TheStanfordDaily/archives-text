### John Schwarz 
Jim Jeffries, 6-2, redheaded

like a football player than a ten
nis player, climaxed four days of
superlative tennis last Friday and
Saturday to capture the Northern
California Intercollegate Singles
championship at Stanford.
Jeffries pulled the upset of the
year on Friday as the unranked
Indian netter Ixnvied over the na

ney Reed of San Jose State in
three sets, 1-6. 6-1, 6-4. On Satur
day Jeffries kept up his torrid
pace and ousted his teammate and
seconded seeded Dick Ogden in
straight sets 6-3, 6-4. to win the
championship.
Jeffries played almost flawless
tennis in the two weekend
matches and kept continual pres
sure on his opponents forcing
them into constant errors. His
outstanding net play and excel
lent service proved to be the big
difference in both matches.
The lumbering Card netter
whose nickname around his team
mates is "lug" looked anything
but like a lug in this tournament
as he poured thundering ground
strokes and crisp net volleys
away on numerous occasions.
In the doubles division of the
tournament the two singles final
ists Jeffries and Ogden pooled
their efforts and defeated their
own Stanford teammates Dick

Gould and Norm Karns, 6-4, 6-2,
to walk off iwth the doubles
crown.

Jim Jeffries, 6-2, redheaded
Stanford senior, who looks more
like a football player than a ten
nis player, climaxed four days of
superlative tennis last Friday and
Saturday to capture the Northern
California Intercollegate Singles
championship at Stanford.
Jeffries pulled the upset of the
year on Friday as the unranked
Indian netter Ixnvied over the na
tion's number nine tennis player,
last year's intercollegiate cham
pion and number one seed Whit
ney Reed of San Jose State in
three sets, 1-6. 6-1, 6-4. On Satur
day Jeffries kept up his torrid
pace and ousted his teammate and
seconded seeded Dick Ogden in
straight sets 6-3, 6-4. to win the
championship.
Jeffries played almost flawless
tennis in the two weekend
matches and kept continual pres
sure on his opponents forcing
them into constant errors. His
outstanding net play and excel
lent service proved to be the big
difference in both matches.
The lumbering Card netter
whose nickname around his team
mates is "lug" looked anything
but like a lug in this tournament
as he poured thundering ground
strokes and crisp net volleys
away on numerous occasions.
