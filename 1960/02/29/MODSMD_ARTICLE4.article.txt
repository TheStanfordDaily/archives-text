# IRA SANDPERL
## Pacifist Offers His Ideas on Death Penalty 
### W.L. Kinsolving 
Ira Sandperl, a pacifist and a
follower of Gandhi, spoke last
night after dinner at Los Arcos
Eating Club. He spoke on "Who
the Executioner* Who the Vic
tim," and turned the examination
inward to ourselves.
Reaching the conclusion that
"we"' are the executioners and
also the victims, Mr. Sandperl
stated that "... the problem
is you. What do we want in our
life? What kind of world. . . . "
View of .Man
In the argument for and against
capital punishment, the view of
man must come into play this
view rests on the view we have
of ourselves. "This must be a
discovery of our own. 'Thou Shalt
INTot Kill' must come from within,
not from on high."
Concerning the specific issue of
the Chessman case, Mr. Sandperl
believes that it is unfortunate
that the present issue is so com
pletely associated with one per
son. But he felt it was necessary,
for people's emotions are aroused
so much more easily with a single
person than with a multitude. "If
someone had to bomb one small
child in Moscow to save the world,
it would be much harder to find
a volunteer for the job than if
he had to kill 10 million."
'Sparc Suffering'
By saying that "I don't know,"
so many of us "... wash our
hands of the responsibility," in
the manner of Pontius Pilate.
The fact that we abolish capital
punishment would mean two
things: 11 we would spare suffer
ing and death for someone, and
2> we would help to redeem them,
and we say by our actions that
we care for them. Sandperl
said that the often quoted fact
that the executed were almost
always the friendless and the
poor was perfectly true.
Mr. Sandperl closed with a
quote from Albert Schwiet/.er:
"The trick of being human'is to
not take any life l'oi any reason."

tim," and turned the examination
inward to ourselves.
Reaching the conclusion that
"we"' are the executioners and
also the victims, Mr. Sandperl
stated that "... the problem
is you. What do we want in our
life? What kind of world. . . . "
View of .Man
In the argument for and against
capital punishment, the view of
man must come into play this
view rests on the view we have
of ourselves. "This must be a
discovery of our own. 'Thou Shalt
INTot Kill' must come from within,
not from on high."
Concerning the specific issue of
the Chessman case, Mr. Sandperl
believes that it is unfortunate
that the present issue is so com
pletely associated with one per
son. But he felt it was necessary,
for people's emotions are aroused
so much more easily with a single
person than with a multitude. "If
someone had to bomb one small
child in Moscow to save the world,
it would be much harder to find
a volunteer for the job than if
he had to kill 10 million."
'Sparc Suffering'
By saying that "I don't know,"
so many of us "... wash our
hands of the responsibility," in
the manner of Pontius Pilate.
The fact that we abolish capital
punishment would mean two
things: 11 we would spare suffer
ing and death for someone, and
2> we would help to redeem them,
and we say by our actions that
we care for them. Sandperl
said that the often quoted fact
that the executed were almost
always the friendless and the
poor was perfectly true.
Mr. Sandperl closed with a
quote from Albert Schwiet/.er:
"The trick of being human'is to
not take any life l'oi any reason."
