I was not justified.
Sobell was charged with having
had five conversations with Ros
enberg. whom he met as a stu
dent at New York University.
"Sobell was a victim of the
McCarthy era," McCormack stat
ed. "He is an innocent man, and
had neither part nor lot in the
crime with which ho was charged.
He is a brilliant scholar and a
man of high moral standards."

justice had been done. "Sobell
was a victim of prejudice, perjury
and politics," he said.

was a victim of prejudice, perjury
and politics," he said.
'Not Parole'
"We are not requesting parole
for Morton Sobell, because parole
is not freedom. A request for
parole would amount to an ad
mission of guilt. We are request
ing amnesty," McCormack stated.
McCormack reported that the
Committee has achieved a world
wide response to its work. A peti
| tion signed by 100 clergymen of
all denominations will be a part
of the next appeal, he said.
McCormack, a Presbyterian
! minister for 50 years, was dis
missed from his position at Alca
traz after he signed one of the
Sobell petitions.
