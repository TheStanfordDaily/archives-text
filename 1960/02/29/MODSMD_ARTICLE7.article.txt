# 'Blissful Bachelor'
## 
### 
Louis Nordby, blissfully posing with admiring voters Charlene
Hermes and Ruth Sutheriin, was officially named Bachelor of
the Campus Friday. Runners up were Dave Peterson and Bill
Kartoziau. Peterson lias iet it be known that he blames his loss
on suspicious circumstances surrounding the balloting. Kartozian
demanded a recount, claiming that many of his ballots were dis
counted because of careless spelling of his name. Nordby, how
ever, feels that his election is only proper recognition after three
years of unrecognition at Stanford.
