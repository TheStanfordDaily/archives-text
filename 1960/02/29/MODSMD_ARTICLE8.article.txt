# KHRU SHCHEV VISITS
## Indonesia Signs With Russia, Claims Neutrality 
### 
BOGOR. Indoneasia (/l 3 ) Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev
yesterday handed this neutralist Southeast Asian nation a loan of
250 million dollars.
In turn. Indonesian President Sukarno promised to keep neutral
between East-West blocs.
Economic and cullural agreement and a joint communique were

| signed by the two leaders as a
i climax to Khrushchev's 12-day
i visit to Indonesia, which ends to
morrow.
The economic agreement grant
ed a seven-year credit, at 2per
cent interest to be paid back in
12 years in British pounds or com
modities rather than Indonesian
| rupiahs.
The two countries also agreed
to enter into a trade agreement in
which the Soviet Union would in
crease its purchases of Indoneas
ian rubber and other products.
Major Boost
As a gift. Khrushchev an
nounced the Soviet Union would
i build a new 20U-bod hospital and
clinic.
High Indonesian sources said
| Ihe economic pact gives Indonesia
; credits for building a steel plant
i and for developing its agricul
tural, textile, chemical and non
ferrous metal industries. It also
! provides for construction of one
! or two nuclear reactors under a
1956 Soviet aid offer.
The pact may give this agricul
tural country a major boost to-
I ward industrialization.

By dangling the big credit
i agreement, Khrushchev obviously
| hopes to arrest Indonesia's slow
i drift toward the West.
Officials Unhappy
Although Sukarno's govern
ment still proclaims an official
| policy of neutrality between the
I Kast-West camps, communism
suffered a reverse here several
months ago when Red China
angrily intervened in Indonesia's
policy of moving Chinese busi
nesmen from rural areas and sett
ling them elsewhere. Khrushchev
is reported to have told Sukarno
he could ignore China's com
i plaints.
Some Indonesian officials pri
vate 1 y expressed unhappiness
about the long-term provisions of
the new credit. They pointed out
it could be withdraw should Mos
cow become dissatisfied with In
doneasian actions.
The communique expressed
I hope fqr an agreement at Geneva
ending nuclear tests, and lauded
Khrushchev's proposals for total
1 world disarmament.
