# JUDICIAL COUNCIL
## Honor Violation Procedures 
### Sue wotring Jim Fitch 
Upon entering Stanford each student signs a
pledge stating that he will uphold the Honor
Code. In addition to agreeing that he will neither
give nor receive unpermitted aid, the student
agrees that he will take action when he observes
an honor code violation.
Many students do not know, however, how to
report a violation and what action is taken on
such reports.
When a student observes a possible violation,
he has two alternatives. He may talk to the stu
dent observed, suggesting that he turn himself in,
or he may report the case to the professor in the
course, a member of the Judicial Council, or the
Dean of Students.
The identity of such witnesses is known only
to Judicial Council and the Dean of Students. The
witness is never required to face the accused, and
all phases of the case are kept ,strictly confidential.
The Judicial Council, composed of members of
Men's and Women's Councils, acts as 'grand jury'
and judge in Honor Code cases.
Upon being informed of a possible Honor Code
violation, the chairman of Judicial Council inter
views the suspect or suspects, notifies him of the
charge and informs him of his rights before the
cou ncil.
Every precaution is taken to protect suspects.
Cases are kept confidential. No record of the case
will appear on the student's transcript or in his
general file, and any public mention of the case
will not include the suspect's name. The suspect
has the right to disqualify members of Judicial
Council who he feels might be prejudiced against
him, and decisions of the council may be appealed
to the Dean of Students.
In tho words of Sue Palmer, chairman of Wom
en's Council."I don't think there's a chance ol an

innocent person being found guilty."
The Judicial Council is willing to put as much
time into a case as is necessary to insure that
this is true.
A good example of this occured at the end of
last quarter when a professor noted that two
pages on each of two exam papers were almost
exactly identical.
After a preliminary investigation. Judicial
Council determined that the two students in
volved had not known each other before, and
that il was therefore not a case of collaboration
on the exam, but clearly a case of one student's
having copied another's work without the other
student being aware of it.
Two meetings and eight hours later, the coun
cil was still not at all sure who the guilty person
was. Consequently, the council members divided
up the class lists aiu! interviewed all of the people
who had taken the exam.
Finally, when the story of one suspect was
discredited, the council determined that he had
done the copying and absolved the other sus
pect of any guilt but only after the ten council
members had spent nearly sixteen hours apiece
on the case.
A two-thirds majority vote of Judicial Council
is needed for conviction of an honor code viola
tion. There is not set penalty for any given of
fense, but there are certain recognized standard
one which are given at the 1 discretion of the
council, according to the seriousness of the
offense.
Upon conviction, either an 'F' in the exam or
work involved, or an 'F' in the course is usually
given. In addition to this, a student may be
suspended for from one to five quarters.
In extreme cases, expulsion from school may
result.
