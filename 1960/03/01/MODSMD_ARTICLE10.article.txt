# ALUMNI EFFORTS SUPPLEMENTED
## 415 'Stanford Associates' Organize University Fund-Raising Programs 
### Jim Fitch 
When 3.") alumni founded the
Stanford Associates in 1931, they
probably did not have visions of
helping to raise $120 million in
gifts for the University during
the next 25 years.
In fact, at the time of organiza
tion, it was mostly the foresight
of the founders which told of an
eventual need for any external
funds at all.
Until the Depression hit. Stan
ford had not felt a critical need
for funds other than the return
from endowment; during the De
pression, financing was hard for
all of the schools, but Stanford's
administration (Ray Lyman Wil
bur's administration) had not
looked for help in the form of
alumni gifts, until the committee
of 35 volunteered their help in
doing so.
115 Members
Since organizing, the associates
have increased their membership
to its present 115, which, as stated
in the organization's handbook, is
"limited to those who are actively
interested in the University's wel
fare and are willing to make an
effort in its behalf."
Membership in the Stanford
Associates is by cleclion. The gov
erning board contains 33 mem
bers, three of whom are elected

by the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion Board.
At present, Gene K. Walker is
president of Stanford Associates,
.Richard F. O'Brien, who is also
Stanford's Director of Develop
ment. is secretary. The associates'
enthusiasm seems greater now
than ever before, as is evidenced
by their help in raising $22 mil
lion for Stanford last year.
Wide Interest
The articles of organization
slate that they "should cooperate
with and supplement the work
of the Alumni Association." In
the pasl. Ihe associates have been
interested in such fields as "stu
dent recruitment, placement and
vocational guidance, publications,
and public occasions," but their
principal objective has always
been gift procurement.
It is thus that they have become
an integral part of Stanford's fi
nancial program, which relies
upon .56 per cent of the annual
budget or over 50 per cent il
building is taken into account
coming from gifts.
The associates have come to
function as the central organiz
ing body for solicitation of gifts.
The voluntary leaders of most of
the University's fund-raising or
ganizations, such as the Stanford
Buck Club and the Stanford Par

I ents Committee, are numbered
among its members.
The University administration
decides what funds it needs and
j makes suggestions for obtaining
them to the associates, who in
! turn set a policy for solicitation.
i They coordinate the efforts of all
of I he various organizations which
i might have a hand in any given
project.
When established, Stanford was
endowed with $20 million, while
Harvard, for example, had only
$10 million at the time. It was tin
! necessary for Stanford to seek
external funds for a long time
and consequently, few were aware
lof the fact that Stanford, like
! other private schools, would even
tually need additional money, if
it was to achieve its academic
| goals.
Nine Fund Phases
In 19.36, the group established
the Stanford Fund, which is now
1 divided into nine se p a rate
fund-raising phases, such as the
Stanford Business School Fund
rind the Stanford Engineering
Fund, which cover all the various
aspects of the University's finan-
I cial needs.
The Stanford Associates still
face many complex problems.
Above all, any process of asking
people for money is a problem in
I tact, as well as understanding.
