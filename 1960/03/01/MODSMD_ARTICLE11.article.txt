# Senate Foes Of Rights Bill Plan Filibuster
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (A*) â€” Sen. Richard B. Russell (D-Ga.) pulled
out the rule book yesterday and won a minor round as the Senate
moved slowly into marathon civil rights sessions
As captain of an 18-member Southern band of opponents, Rus
sell literally waved the rules manual at his colleagues. He was

making a parliamentary demand I
aimed at easing the burden on the j
Southerners' voices, likely to be- ,
come hoarse with filibustering.
Filibuster Threat
Vice President Richard M. I
Nixon, presiding at the time, held j
Russell was right in his conten- J
tion that Senate clerks must read
all civil rights amendments of- j
fered to a pending unrelated |
House-pased bill.
This amounted to a plain threat i
by the Southerners to wheel out i
some long amendments and let j
the clerks use up time reading j
them while the filibustered got i
their second wind.
McClellan Asks Ruling
Then Sen. John L. McClellan
(D-Ark.) moved into the parlia
mentary fray. He demanded from
Nixon a ruling on whether he
could offer proposed amendments
without obtaining unanimous con
sent. If he couldn't McClellan j
stormed that he would make a '
motion and force the Senate to j
vote? on his right 1o act.
Sen Frank Carlson (R-Kan.>,
who was presiding this time, held
that McClellan didn't need unani-1
mous consent.
Any Amendment
Sen. Jacob K. Javits (R-N.Y.),
a civil rights advocate, popped up |
to observe that any kind of !
lengthy amendment could be of-!
fered. He said someone might j
even wrap up sections of the Bible
and submit them.
Previously Sen. Prescott Bush !
(R-Conn.), another who spelled
Nixon in the presiding officer's ,
chair, had held that if the Senate !
should vote later to limit debate,
only those amendments presented
to it before that vote could be
considered in passing a measure.
Limiting Debate
The Senate must vote on limit
ing debate on the second day aft
er a petition signed by 16 mem
bers is filed. McClellan wanted to
know what would happen if the
clerks couldn't finish reading all
of the proposed amendments be
fore the voting deadline, one hour
after the Senate convened on the
second day.
This stumped Sen. Norris Cot
ton (R-N.H.) who had taken over
the presiding officer's chair and
Nixon was summoned.
Nixon reserved his ruling un
til later.
