# Civil Rights Law Upheld By High Court
## 
### 
i WASHINGTON (/P) â€” The Su
! preme Court yesterday upheld a
! key part of the 1937 Civil .Rights
j Act. It also ordered 1,337 Louisi
ana Negroes restored to that
state's voting rolls. Both decisions
were unanimous.
In a split decision, the court
sustained the right of states to
discharge employes who refuse
i to answer questions touching on
| security.
The court reversed a finding
- by U.S. Dist. Judge T. Hoyt Davis
|at Macon, Ga., that sections of
the 19.Y7 act aimed at protecting
j voting rights of Negroes were
unconstitutional.
Voters Purged
Then, on the basis of its find
i ings in Ihe Georgia case, the court
held that 1.377 Negro voters had
i been illegally purged from the
I rolls in Louisiana's Washington
Parish. The court ordered them
I restored.
This first Supreme Court test
of the vital voting provisions of
the Civil Rights Act resulted in
a federal government victory
which presumably will permit the
Negroes 1o vote in Louisiana's
April 19 state election.
Employe Dismissal
The ruling on the right of states
| to discharge employes who refuse
to answer questions dealing with
: security came in the case of two
| employes of Los Angeles County,
Calif. They were discharged
after refusing to answer ques
tions in appearances before the
House Committee on Un-Ameri
can Activities.
Chief Justice Earl Warren dis
qualified himself in this opinion
because of his California back
ground. The other justices split
14-4 on the discharge of Thomas
! W. Nelson, which had the effect
! of upholding his dismissal.
