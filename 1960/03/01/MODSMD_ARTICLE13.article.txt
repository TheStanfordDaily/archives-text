## Death Penalty Abolishment Unlikely as Legislature Begins 
### 
SACRAMENTO (/P)—The Leg
islature reconvened yesterday in
a mood to get rid of the death
penalty issue as fast as possible.
There was strong evidence that
the lawmakers back from a 30-
day recess would r e j e c 1 Gov.
Brown's request that they abolish
or modify the state's capital pun
ishment law.
Brown sent the lawmakers 16
subjects for the special session
agenda, including school and vet
erans bonds, control of workers'
welfare funds, and some technical
matters.
Rill Introduction Delayed
Aware of the violent reaction to
his decision to reprieve Caryl
Chessman for 60 days, Brown de
layed sending his bill on the death
penalty to the lawmakers.
Latest word from his office in
dicated it might be tomorrow be
fore the governor's proposal
reaches the Assembly.
There were indications it would
be introduced by either Phillip A.
Burton or John A. O'Connell, both
Democratic assemblymen from
San Francisco.
Budget Must Wait
Assemblyman Jesse Unruh D-
Los Angeles, who is steering
Brown's 2'u billion-dollar budget
proposal through the Assembly,
said he wanted to sec the death
penalty issue cleared up first.
Unruh, who voted in 1959 for a
six-year moratorium on execu
tions, said he was undecided how
he will go on Brown's bill,
"I'll wait and see what form
the bill takes and what connota
tions it has," Unruh said. "I'll
have to oppose it if it's tied to the
Chessman case."
The bill will have to clear the
Ways and Means Committee of
which Un r it h is chairman. A
check of the 1959 vote on the
death penalty issue shows the

committee stood 12-10 against a
moratorium.
Assemblyman Thomas J. Mac-
Bride D-Sacramento, who person
ally wants the death penalty re
tained, said he would .seek to have
the issue put on the ballot in the
June primary.
Assemblyman Bruce V. Reagan
R-Pasadena, who has called for
impeachment of Brown over the
Chessman reprieve, said he is
pursuing the subject with the leg
islative counsel.
An organization called the "Cal
ifornia Defense Committee" of
Glendale sent a petition to (he
secretary of state calling for
Brown's recall.

the lawmakers back from a 30-
day recess would r e j e c 1 Gov.

or modify the state's capital pun
ishment law.

matters.
Rill Introduction Delayed
Aware of the violent reaction to
his decision to reprieve Caryl
Chessman for 60 days, Brown de
layed sending his bill on the death
penalty to the lawmakers.
Latest word from his office in
dicated it might be tomorrow be
fore the governor's proposal

Budget Must Wait
Assemblyman Jesse Unruh D-
Los Angeles, who is steering
Brown's 2'u billion-dollar budget
proposal through the Assembly,
said he wanted to sec the death
penalty issue cleared up first.
Unruh, who voted in 1959 for a
six-year moratorium on execu
tions, said he was undecided how
he will go on Brown's bill,
"I'll wait and see what form
the bill takes and what connota
tions it has," Unruh said. "I'll
have to oppose it if it's tied to the
Chessman case."
The bill will have to clear the
Ways and Means Committee of
which Un r it h is chairman. A
check of the 1959 vote on the
death penalty issue shows the

committee stood 12-10 against a
moratorium.
Assemblyman Thomas J. Mac-
Bride D-Sacramento, who person
ally wants the death penalty re
tained, said he would .seek to have
the issue put on the ballot in the
June primary.
Assemblyman Bruce V. Reagan
R-Pasadena, who has called for
impeachment of Brown over the
Chessman reprieve, said he is
pursuing the subject with the leg
islative counsel.
An organization called the "Cal
ifornia Defense Committee" of
Glendale sent a petition to (he
secretary of state calling for
Brown's recall.
