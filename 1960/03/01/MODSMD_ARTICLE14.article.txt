In regard to veslerdav « editorial, there ha\e been comments
that Legislature was not designed to consider issues emanating
from outside the campus and that this august hody is Ii 111 it< *«l in
its ('unction h\ its vers nature as a student parliament.
Any limitations, however, which are imposed on Legislature
ha\e been placed on il h\ the members ol past Legislatures and
student bodies and not b\ the concept itsell. In fact, the Constilu
tioll of the ASSU would seem to require Legislature to take an
active interest in all issues of student concern.
The Preamble of this tome slates *'\\ e. the students of Stanford
I niversilv, in order to enhance our educational, social, and cul
tural opportunities, further our welfare and interest as students,
promote self-government and leadership, and develop personal,
public, and professional responsibility hereby, illl the approval
of the President of the I niversilv, do associate and establish lliis
Constitution."
(.ertainlv promoting and developing one's public responsibility
connotes taking an interest in public allairs, particularly those
about which one feels strongly. Thus, no refuge can be found in
the concept of Legislature b\ those who wish to restrict its scope.
The University places only two regulations on Legislature, that
il remain non-sectarian and non-partisan, these regulations having
been placed on the entire I niversilv by the Founding (.rant.
Hence, then* is no official administration limitation on I.ASSL s
acti\ ities except these.
Legislature is, therefore, self-restricting. With the exception
of the two University limitations, Legislature can and should deal
v\illi anything the members and student body wish to discuss,
and il should not sel its course solely on the basis of ils prede
cessors' accomplishments or failures.
The members of Legislature should feel free or even obligated
to consider ;in\ issue vvhich afTects the student bodv or about which
there is a great deal of controversy among the students. I lie way
to determine if this controversy exists is by questioning their con
stituents, and students who are interested in an issue should make
their ideas known lo llieir representatives.
The fact that opinion on the issue may lie split is no reason for
the members of Legislature lo refuse to examine the issue or to
take a definite stand.
\\ e hope that in the approaching campaigns lliis spring the
elections for Legislature are not based on the funniest slnni or the
largest number of posters, but rather on ideas and issues.expressed
by the candidates, and that these ideas and issues are introduced
in Legislature and constructive thought given to them. Onlv in llii.»
v\av will Legislature become an organization of true student lead
ership and not jusl a proving ground for future legalists and a
launching pad for upper atmospheric executives.
