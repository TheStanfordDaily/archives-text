# Beating the System
## 
### 
Editor's note: The following ar
ticle appeared in the Harvard
Crimson and was written by a
Harvard student. Entitled "Beat
ing the System," it was judged
the best undergraduate article to
appear in an undergraduate news
paper in !959, and with finals
week approaching, it seems quite
appropriate.
The Harvard examination sys-j
torn is designed, according to its
promulgators, to test two specific
things, knowledge of trends and
knowledge of details. Men ap
proaching the examination prob
lem have three choices: 1. flunk
ing out, 2. doing the work, or 3.
working out some system of fool
ing the grader. The first choice
of solution is too permanent, the
second takes too long.
Vague Generality
This article is designed to ex
plain how to achieve the third
answer to this perplexing prob
lem by the use of the vague gen-1
erality, the artful equivocation, i
and the overpowering assumption.
It seems pretty obvious that in !
any discussion of the various
methods whereby the crafty stu-j
dent attempts to show the grader i
that he knows a lot more than ho j
actually does, the vague general
ity is the key device.
A generality is a vague state-1
mont that moans nothing by it
self, but when placed in an essay I
on a specific subject, might very
well mean something to a grader, j
The true master of the generality
is the man who can write a ten
pago essay which means nothing J
at all to him, and have it moan 1
a great deal to anyone who reads 1
it.
Useful Quotes
Every non-mathematic field in]
the University has its own set of !
generalities. For instance:
"Hume brought empiricism to
its logical extreme." (Philosophy) i
"The whole thing boils down to I
human right." (Government)
"The Holy Roman Empire was
neither holy, nor Roman, nor an
empire." (History)
"Locke is a transitional figure."
(Philosophy)
"Marx t u r n e d Hegel upside |
down." (Gen. Ed.)
To check the operation of aj
vague generality under fire, take
the typical example, "Hume I
brought empiricism to its logical
extreme." The question is asked,
"Did the philosophical beliefs of
Hume represent the spirit of the
age in which he lived?"
Our hero replies by opening his |
essay with: "David Hume, the

great Scottish philosopher. I
brought empiricism to its logical
extreme. If this be the spirit of I
■ the age in which he lived, then j
ho was representative of it." This
i generality expert has already tak-;
en his position for the essay.
Vaguest Idea
'I Actually he has not the vaguest
idea what Hume really said, or
in fact what he said il in, or in !
i fact if he ever said anything. But
by never bothering to define em
piricism, he may write indefi
nitely on the issue virtually with
out contradiction.
The artful equivocation is an
1 almost impossible concept to ex
plain. but it is easy to demon
strate. Let us take our earlier
typical examination question,
"Did the philosophical beliefs of
i Hume represent the spirit of the
age in which he lived?"
The equivocator would answer
it this way: "Some people believe
i that David Hume was not neces-
I sarily a great philosopher because
his thought was merely a reflec
tion of conditions around him,
colored by his own personality.
Hume's Greatness
"Others, however, strongly sup
port Hume's greatness on the
ground that the force of his per
sonality definitely affected the
| ag» in which he lived. It is not
a question of the cart before the
j horse in either case, merely the
old problem of which came first,
; the chicken or the egg. In any
lease, there is much to be said on
| both sides."
The artful equivocation must
imply the writer'knows the right
answer but it must never get defi
nite enough to eliminate any pos
j sibilities.
j There is a third method of deal
i ing with examination questions—
!that is by use of the overpower-
I ing assumption, an assumption so
cosmic that it is sometimes ac
i cepted.
In the long run the expert in
the use of unwarranted assump
tions comes off better than the
equivocator. He would deal with
I our question of Hume not by
baffling the grader or fencing
with him but like this: "II is l
absurd to discuss whether Hume
i is representative of the ago in
! which ho lived unless we first
note the progress of that ago on
I all intellectual fronts. After ail,;
Ilumo did not live in a vacuum."
At this point our assumption
expert proceeds to discuss any-1
thing which strikes his fancy at
the moment. If he can sneak the !
'first assumption past the grader,'
othon the rest is clear sailing.
