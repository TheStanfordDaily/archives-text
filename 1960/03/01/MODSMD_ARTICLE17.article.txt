# UNRESOLVED CONFLICT
## Increasing Crime Result Of Alienation from Society

In the last article on crime, cer
tain points remained unclear. Are
only members of the lower class
and minority groups criminals?
How does the growing crime rate i
correlate with the increasing real j
income of the people?
Basically the same reasons ex
plained the rise of crime where-1
ever it occurs. The person who j
commits a crime is one who has
become alienated from society
and finds no socially acceptable
means to resolve his conflict. The
increasing crime rate merely
shows a growing alienation of the
population from the mores of so
ciety.
America has been governed for
two centuries by a basically puri
tan concept of social conduct, j
Premarital virginity has been a
virtue; the individual lias been
the unit of activity, and a rational
concept of law and the state has
developed. Actions conflicting
with these ideals were character-!
istic of foreign and minority 1
groups comprising the lower class !
and were therefore considered
vulgar.
Distinction < loses
The distinction between the 1
middle class ethic and its lower j
class counterpart remained clear
until after the Second World War.
Then with the increased mobility
and urbanitalion which served to i
homogenize the various groups, j
the two systems came inimately ;
into contact.
The ethics of the middle cla-ss i
still ostensibly rule the country,
but with the social changes of the i
last two decades, conflicts have j
arisen and new forms of action i
have developed. The ideal of pre-:
marital virginity is now weakened
by the social demands for more
education which frequently delays j
marriage and lent hens the period
of premarital life.
The development of t he orga
nization man, the scientific team, j
and modern advertising has been j
a demoralizing force on the indi- [
vidual a>s a social unit. The em-1
phasis is no longer placed on him
but rather on the group.
With this change of ideals, one
sees the evolution of the middle
class child from the individual ac
tor to the social organism who
must have successful social rela
tions. The rise of middle class
gangs has been quite rapid dur
ing this period.
During the last: few decades j
there has been a significant j

change in the public opinion of
law and its enforcement. No long
er so docile, people are more apt
to attempt extralegal activities.
This tendency can be traced di
| rectly to the prohibition era when
the middle class purchasing liquor
! came in contact with the criminal
I element.
This contact violated social
mores of legality. Once done, how
! ever, the consequences had a last
i ing effect. The middle class lost
its great adherence to laws and
continues to stretch the bounds
of legal activity.
Thus with the decline in im
portance of premarital virginity,
individual action, and laws as a
guiding force for conduct, the
middle class has adopted the low
er class ethic, not because of
! force or pressure, but rather
I through a natural social evolu
! t ion.
Urban Standards
The 19th century, middle class,
rural ethics have been replaced
by the now urban mores of the
post-World War II period. These
j standards differ little from those
! which have always prevailed in
the cities with their lower class
outlook. The important fact today
1 is that increasingly more people
1 are being unbani/ed.
Thus with the rise of urbaniza
tion, the old middle class values
are being replaced by lower class
ones. The present increase in the
i crime rate, especially among juve
i niles, is largely due to this. Pres
ent treatment of criminals is
! basically ineffective, and we can
expect that even more crimes will
i be committed as this period of
i urbanization continues.

Urban Standards
The 19th century, middle class,
rural ethics have been replaced

Thus with the rise of urbaniza

are being replaced by lower class
ones. The present increase in the
