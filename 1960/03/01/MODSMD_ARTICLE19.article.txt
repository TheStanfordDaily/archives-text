Editor, The Daily:
Without entertaining any illu
sions concerning the reliability of
brief, precise, and mutually ex
clusive formulations, it may ho
somewhat worthwhile to list pos
sible outcomes of the cold war
and to decide which are prefer
able:
1. We could bomb the Russians,
being bombed ourselves in return.
2. Multilateral disarmament ac
companied by a depression.
3. Multilateral disarmament ac
companied by increased foreign
and/or domestic welfare spend
ing.
4. Continuation of the arms
race, risking accidental or panic
war at any time, eventually being
so far outstripped by the more
efficient land brutal) Russian
system of production that we are
compelled to sign a treaty on
their terms.
5. Acceleration of the arms
race, adoption of more efficient
(and brutal) production methods,
eventually intentionally or ac
cidentally exterminating the
human race.
6. Un i 1 a t eral disarmament.
Would the Russians occupy Amer
ica or not? Suppose they don't;
then we would choose between de
pression and government spend
ing. 1
7. Suppose they do. We could
resist passively, but since Russian
propagandists would control the
mass media, passive resistance
probably wouldn't accomplish
much.

I 8. Suppose we don't resist; most
! likely America would be system
atically converted into a commu
nist nation.
Other possibilities occur to me
but I consider them too unlikely
to list. What other possibilities do
you think there are? Which out
comes to the cold war would you
prefer? My tentative order of
I preference (using numbers to
give an impression of scientific
! expertise) is: 3, 2, 6, 4, 7, 8, 5, 1.
| Do you agree?

Editor, The Daily:
Without entertaining any illu
sions concerning the reliability of
brief, precise, and mutually ex
clusive formulations, it may ho
somewhat worthwhile to list pos
sible outcomes of the cold war
and to decide which are prefer
able:
1. We could bomb the Russians,
being bombed ourselves in return.
2. Multilateral disarmament ac
companied by a depression.
3. Multilateral disarmament ac
companied by increased foreign
and/or domestic welfare spend
ing.
4. Continuation of the arms
race, risking accidental or panic
war at any time, eventually being
so far outstripped by the more
efficient land brutal) Russian
system of production that we are
compelled to sign a treaty on
their terms.
5. Acceleration of the arms
race, adoption of more efficient
(and brutal) production methods,
eventually intentionally or ac
cidentally exterminating the
human race.
6. Un i 1 a t eral disarmament.
Would the Russians occupy Amer
ica or not? Suppose they don't;
then we would choose between de
pression and government spend
ing. 1
7. Suppose they do. We could
resist passively, but since Russian
propagandists would control the
mass media, passive resistance
probably wouldn't accomplish
much.
