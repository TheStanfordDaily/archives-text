Last weekend everyone was talking about the Olympics and sev
eral fine sports events on The Farm were quite possibly overlooked
by all Stanford sports fans due to the exciting events at Squaw.
Card baseball players opened their year with a couple of trouncing
wins over C'al Poly and San Jose State. If Lee Moencli and John
lliirlhut can keep up the. heavy hitting to aid the fine pitching staff
the Indians may make a NCAA playoff yet in the spring.
Perhaps the most impressive Stanford victory which unfortunate
ly many people missed was Jim Jeffries and company's complete
sweep of the Northern California Tennis Championships, here

Wednesday through Saturday.
Jeffries's impressive wins over
Whitney Heed the defending
NCAA champ and his teammate
Dick Ogden m;iy be that faint
glimmer of hope which'll end
Southern California's complete
domination of college tennis. Per
haps the most ama/.ing fact was
the all-Stanford finals in the
singles Jeffries vs. Ogden and
doubles Ogden, Jeffries against
Dick Could and Norm Karns who
had defeated the touted Heed,
Nick Seharf combo in the semis.
Yes. the tournament showed
some fine, solid play from all
seven Card net tors Dick Mosk,
Gil Kanney, George Bates, Gould,
Karns, Ogden and Jeffries may
prove to be the best in a long
time.
There was some doubt how
ever, whether the strong Indian
doubles duo of Gould and Karns
would make the semi-finals Thurs
day afternoon. Scheduled to play
Art Kono and Gulden l.loyd from

Cal, Gould arrived lalo, about 4:30, with the news that he was the
father of a baby girl. Gould had just left his wife the former Margie
Mix in the hospital and stormed on the court, a bit haggard but
eager to play.
Although the Cal opponents graciously agreed to postpone the
match till Friday. Gould and nis confident teammate Karns insisted
on playing. Needless to say Gould played inspired tennis and the
Tribe duo overwhelmed theii Cal rivals 6-2 in the first set and out
lasted them 8-6. Dick stayed on his feet till the end.
I Most Inspirational Play
Well, how about those hockey games last weekend? Certainly
the U.S.-Russiii and U.S.-Czechoslovakia games at Squaw and home
on the old T.V. set were the most exciting athletic contests in a long
time. The Yank victories sort of made the whole Olympics worth
while, i.e., if some winter sports fan didn't have enough fun at them
in the first place.
They were a fitting tribute and keynoted the general over-all
improvement by United States athletes in this previously European
dominated winter event. Even all those worn-out cliches about
"Olympics promote world brotherhood and peace" seemed to come
to life during the U.S. vs. Russia hockey contest and the later en
couragement by the Russian team captain Nikolai Sologulmv whose
advice perhaps clinched the gold medal for the U.S. It was probably
the first time that a team had to take gas to go and win a gold medal.
Canucks Don't Make 11
The whole U.S. show was as inspirational as any coach could
dream. Certainly the 2-1 victory over the co-favored Canadians,
alter all hoekev really is their game, seemed to be the indicator of
good things to come as U.S. goalie John MrCartan made a record
thirty-nine saves. The same fine play continued in Saturday's con
test with the smooth-sticking Russians, who clearly were better
puck-handlers and shooters. Only the inspired play of hard body
checking and goal-saving gave the U.S. a victory.


DICK MOSK
Fine, solid play
