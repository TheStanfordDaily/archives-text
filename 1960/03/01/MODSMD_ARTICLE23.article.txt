# Sophomores Head Golfers
## 
### Ken Dery 
The Stanford golf team, led by
a smooth blend of seniors and
sophomores, opened the 19i><) fir
ing Saturday by dropping a close
decision to the Peninsula Country
Club squad on the Stanford
course.
Currently holding down the
number one spot for the tribe is
young Pete Choato. Having aver
aged close to par in the ladder
matches this year, this sophomore
is very highly regarded.
Right behind Choate on the six
man playing team is another
sophomore, Bill Farrish.
Swinging in the third and
fourth positions are two seniors,
well-known to many Stanford stu
dents.
Winton and Preston
Kent Winton won last summer's
California State Fair Champion
ship and Ron Preston is the cur
rent all-university title holder.
Ron finished third in the na
tional collegiate tournament last
year as both he and Winton
showed some fine golf.
Lee McQuire, a tremendous
natural athlete is playing number
five. According to Coach Bud
Finger, this former golden gloves
champ Ita-s yet to realize his full
potential and could be one of the
most outstanding golfers when
and if he does.
Rounding out the playing squad
is Dave Hall. This hard worker
usually has the hall in play and
saw action in the biggest amateur
tournament of them all last sum
mer when he qualified for the Na
tional.
Fine Material
Coach Bud Finger was quoted
a-s saying, "We do not as yet
have a well-seasoned team, but

the core of fine material is there.
With some matches under their
helts these boys should be able to
give anyone in the AAWU a real
battle at match play."
Coach Finger also lauded the
return of senior Bill Senor.
Number one his sophomore sea
son, Senor was in a serious auto
accident last year and has since
had a leg plant. At first only able

to walk one hole, through sheer
determination Bill can now go
eleven and still is shooting close
to par. If he can continue his
tremendous comeback the team
should be that much tougher.
