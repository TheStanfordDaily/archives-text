# Indian Netters Have Worries Despite Norcal Tourney Win
## 
### 
Stanford tennis hopes for the
1960 season were substantially
bolstered over the weekend when
the Indian netters dominated the
play in the Northern California
Intercollegiate Championships
Stanford scored 19 points to six
each for San Jose and Cal with
Sacramento State, San Francisco
State, and Santa Clara following
in that order.
However, no true indication of
the team's national strength will
be forthcoming until the Card
racqueteers travel to Los Angeles
early next quarter to play the
nation's outstanding tennis
schools UCLA and USC.
Despite the fact that Stanford
completely swept the recent
match with their Norcal neigh
bors, there still appears to he a
depth problem facing Coach Bob
Renker.
Rig Question Marks
Dick Ogden, Jim Jeffries, Dick
Gould and Norm Karns seem set
in the top four positions but the
big question marks right now are
George Bates. Dick Mosk and Gil
Ranney.
Mosk and Ranney, seniors, and
Bates, a junior, make up the five,
six and seven spots on the team
right now. All three are making

appearances as regular players
lor Stanford for the first time.
Mo.sk has a lot of experience,
having played in many of the
Southern California tournaments
as well as in minor matches the
past three years at Stanford.
Rates is a newcomer who virtually
learned ;ill his tennis since com
ing to Stanford two years ago.
Ranney, like Mosk. has had a lot
of experience in Southern Cali- 1
fornia.
Rooming Serve
Rates, the tallest member of
Hie team at 6-3, has developed a
booming serve and with a little
more experience may fill in well.
His tournament play last week in
cluded a win over Art Kono, a one
time first singler for Cal.
Mosk, heady and smart, can
wear down a lot of opponents,
but lacks power and speed. Mosk
drew the unenviable assignment
of meeting Whitney Reed, NCAA
champion, as his first opponenl
in the recent championships.
Mosk's (5-!, 11-12 loss was prom
ising.
Ranney is a lop doubles player
and his lefthanded service can be
deceptive. He figures to team
with Bates in the third doubles
position.

play in the Northern California
Intercollegiate Championships
Stanford scored 19 points to six
each for San Jose and Cal with
Sacramento State, San Francisco
State, and Santa Clara following
in that order.
However, no true indication of
the team's national strength will
be forthcoming until the Card
racqueteers travel to Los Angeles
early next quarter to play the
nation's outstanding tennis
schools UCLA and USC.
Despite the fact that Stanford
completely swept the recent
match with their Norcal neigh
bors, there still appears to he a
depth problem facing Coach Bob
Renker.
Rig Question Marks
Dick Ogden, Jim Jeffries, Dick
Gould and Norm Karns seem set
in the top four positions but the
big question marks right now are
George Bates. Dick Mosk and Gil
Ranney.
Mosk and Ranney, seniors, and
Bates, a junior, make up the five,
six and seven spots on the team
right now. All three are making

appearances as regular players
lor Stanford for the first time.
Mo.sk has a lot of experience,
having played in many of the
Southern California tournaments
as well as in minor matches the
past three years at Stanford.
Rates is a newcomer who virtually
learned ;ill his tennis since com
ing to Stanford two years ago.
Ranney, like Mosk. has had a lot
of experience in Southern Cali- 1
fornia.
Rooming Serve
Rates, the tallest member of
Hie team at 6-3, has developed a
booming serve and with a little
more experience may fill in well.
His tournament play last week in
cluded a win over Art Kono, a one
time first singler for Cal.
Mosk, heady and smart, can
wear down a lot of opponents,
but lacks power and speed. Mosk
drew the unenviable assignment
of meeting Whitney Reed, NCAA
champion, as his first opponenl
in the recent championships.
Mosk's (5-!, 11-12 loss was prom
ising.
Ranney is a lop doubles player
and his lefthanded service can be
deceptive. He figures to team
with Bates in the third doubles
position.
