# Tryouts Required For Spring Sing
## 
### 
"Plans for an elaborate Spring
Sing are now being made." re
ported Dave Peterson, chairman
of the Spring Sing Committee.
Tonight, living groups will be
gin choosing directors for their
presentation in the show which
will be held on Friday, May 13.
During the first week of Spring
Quarter these directors will meet
to discuss the show.
Entitled "Coin' My Way," the
Sing will be filled with songs re
lated to modes of transportation,
each number being introduced by
a comical skit.
The early planning is due to a
new procedure in organizing the
show tryouts two weeks before
the date of the presentation. By
having tryouts, Peterson hopes
to eliminate poor acts, to make
ihe show a little shorter than in
past years, and to enable -the
show to be a unified presentation
rather than a series of acts.
