# SHOWS NO WEARINESS
## Santiago Greets Ike With Cheers 
### 
SANTIAGO, Chile (/P) President Eisenhower whipped through
a cheer-filled welcome to Chile yesterday showing no trace of the
apparent weariness that overtook him in Argentina Sunday. His doc
tor put out word that he is in fine shape.
Cheered by 400,000 to 700,000 Chileans on arrival from Argen-

Tina, Eisenhower joined with Chi
lean President Jorge Alessandri
and then almost immediately
plunged into talks on disarma
merit in the Western Hemisphere
a pet project with both.
White House press secretary
James C. Hagerty sharply took
pains to dispel newsmen's impres
sions that Eisenhower was tiring
on his gruelling four-nation South
American trip, Brazil and Argen
tina are behind and Uruguay is
ahead, after the Chilean visit.
Ike's Health Good
Hagerty introduced a reassur
ing statement from Maj. Gen.
Howard M. Snyder, the Presi
dent's personal physician, saying
Eisenhower "is in fine physical
condition and is in good health." j
Reports that Eisenhower was I
tiring originated Sunday in Bari-1
loche, Argentina, after the Presi-!
dent returned from a 2'--hour|
fishing trip appearing unusually !
tired. Later, he appeared much
fresher.
On the 30-minute ride from San
tiago's Los Cirrillos Airport he
stood waving and smiling at the
unexpected large crowds.
This was the eighth day of his ;
15,560-mile tour.
After a private lunch at the
U.S. Embassy, Eisenhower laid a
wreath at the statue of Chile's na- j
tional hero, Bernardo O'Higgins. i
He then went to La Moneda
Palace for talks with Alessandri.
The Chilean President, with Ei
senhower listening in rapt atten- j
tion, outlined his suggestion that J
Latin-American nations hold a
conference for curbing the arms |
race among them.
Alessandri said th e mon e y
poured into arms could go for eco
nomic development. Eisenhower
has expressed the same idea in
speeches in Brazil and Argentina.
To Study Proposals
Hagerty later reviewed the
talks between the two and said:
"The U.S. government is going 1
to study thoroughly some of the |
proposals made by President
Alessandri."
Crowds greeted Eisenhower's
motorcade into the capital withj
shouts of "Ee-key" and threw 1
flowers over his car.
One knot of dissent created an j
incident at headquarters of the
Communist Central Workers Un
ion. where a group yelled: "Down i
with the United States!"
