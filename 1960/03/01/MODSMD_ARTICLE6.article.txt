# Chessman Asks for No Favors

SACRAMENTO </P) Caryl
Chessman last night offered to
die in the gas chamber if the
California Legislature will abol
ish the death penalty for every
body else.
"You can let me die," Chess
man wrote Gov. Brown in a mov
ing 19-page letter, written in the
cell he has occupied on San Quen
tin Prison's death row for 11
years.
The letter was delivered to the
governor by highway patrolmen.
Warden Fred Dickson wouldn't
let one of Chessman's attorneys
see it.
II arrived in the capitol a few
hours after the Legislature had
recessed the first day of its spe
cial session- It was obvious the
lawmakers would reject Brown's
death penalty repealer unless
something unusual happens to
change their minds.
In the letter, the text of which
was released by Brown, Chess
man urged him to frame his death
penalty repealer to exclude him
self. Brown's bill is not expected
to be presented to the lawmakers
until tomorrow.
"You can do this honorably by
taking; my life back into your
hands alone," he wrote.
â€¢Time to Speak'
"You can let me die. Indeed, as
the matter now stands, you are
powerless to do otherwise be
cause of the present 4-3 vote
against me in the California Su
preme Court.
"But at the same time, you can
give your proposal to the Legisla
ture a chance.
"You are right in the position
you have taken. It is time to
speak out, for too seldom does
enlightened humanity have a
spokesman with the courage to
advocate that death is not an
answer to the problems that be
set our civilization."
Investigation Welcomed
He said he welcomed an an
nounced fact-finding investigation
by the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee headed by Sen. Edwin J. Re
gan (D-Weaverville ) and offered
to testify himself.
"1 am quite willing to die if
that will bring about this desper
ately needed social reform.
He said if the legislators had
been in his place they too would
have fought to stave off death for
11 1 L- years.
The governor has always main
tained he believes Chessman
guilty.4
