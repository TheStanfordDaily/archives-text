treaty with East Germany. But
this was the first lime he had

leave Berlin regardless of any
concessions they may offer to So
viet views on disarmament.
Two Questions
Khrushchev replied this was
really two questions because dis

with the vestiges of World War
11, a question whose solution has
been dragged out for 15 years."
The peril of a Soviet-East Ger
man treaty to the Allied position
in Berlin is that the East Ger
mans would take over control of
the supply lines to the city—llo
miles behind the Iron Curtain.
The three Western powers refuse
to recognize the East German
