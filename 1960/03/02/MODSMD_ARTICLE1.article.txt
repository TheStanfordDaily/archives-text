# AMPEX SITE
## Stanford Land To Be Annexed 
### 
Stanford will move to annex some of its lands to the city of
Palo Alio as soon as an agreement is reached with Ampex Corpora
tion, probably within the next few days.
The zoning of the SO acre site is a prerequisite for Ampex's
development of its proposed manufacturing plant.
Legal descriptions of the site at Arastradero and Fremont

Roads are being prepared for sub
mission to the Santa Clara Coun
ty Boundary Commission, accord
ing to All' Brandin, in charge of
development for Stanford.
After the maps are cleared by
the planning commission, the land
will be offered to Palo Alto for
light industrial use. Other lands
will be annexed to Palo Alto as
they are ready for development.
Tax Problem
It is the University's policy to
annex its prospective industrial
lands to the adjacent city or town
to gain police and fire protection.
Thomas Ford, staff counsel for
Stanford, explained to those who
objects to Stanford's development
plans, "The nicest thing for all of
us would be to keep the Stanford
hills the way they are today, but
the University's need for funds
makes this impossible."
Taxes on Stanford land in San
Mateo County rose from $40,000
to $100,000 last year.
Proposed Freeway
Originally the land behind
Menlo Park was to be used for
home sites, but the proposed
eight-lane freeway will cut across
these lands and make them un
desirable for residential develop
ment.
Also, the proposed 500 acre
flood control dam near Ladera
and the two-mile-long linear ac
celerator west of tiie campus
leave the University's plans
"completely up in the air," Ford
said.
Designs Controlled
"In every case." he said, "the
University's planning takes into
account the local political, eco
nomic. sociological and aesthetic
factors."
An industrial plant "will be a
thing of beauty," according to
Ford. The buildings of a given
plan will be permitted to cover
only 20 per cent of the "campus"
around it.and architectural de
signs will be rigidly controlled.
A group of Stanford alumni
and a number of residents of Los
Altos Hills have protested the
Ampex development charging
that it will destroy the beauty of
part of the Stanford foothills and
cause heavy congestion on the
foothill roads.

"In every case." he said, "the
University's planning takes into
account the local political, eco
nomic. sociological and aesthetic
factors."
An industrial plant "will be a
thing of beauty," according to
Ford. The buildings of a given
plan will be permitted to cover
only 20 per cent of the "campus"
around it.and architectural de
signs will be rigidly controlled.
A group of Stanford alumni
and a number of residents of Los
Altos Hills have protested the
Ampex development charging
that it will destroy the beauty of
part of the Stanford foothills and
cause heavy congestion on the
foothill roads.
Stanford will move to annex some of its lands to the city of
Palo Alio as soon as an agreement is reached with Ampex Corpora
tion, probably within the next few days.
The zoning of the SO acre site is a prerequisite for Ampex's
development of its proposed manufacturing plant.
Legal descriptions of the site at Arastradero and Fremont

Roads are being prepared for sub
mission to the Santa Clara Coun
ty Boundary Commission, accord
ing to All' Brandin, in charge of
development for Stanford.
After the maps are cleared by
the planning commission, the land
will be offered to Palo Alto for
light industrial use. Other lands
will be annexed to Palo Alto as
they are ready for development.
Tax Problem
It is the University's policy to
annex its prospective industrial
lands to the adjacent city or town
to gain police and fire protection.
Thomas Ford, staff counsel for
Stanford, explained to those who
objects to Stanford's development
plans, "The nicest thing for all of
us would be to keep the Stanford
hills the way they are today, but
the University's need for funds
makes this impossible."
Taxes on Stanford land in San
Mateo County rose from $40,000
to $100,000 last year.
Proposed Freeway
Originally the land behind
Menlo Park was to be used for
home sites, but the proposed
eight-lane freeway will cut across
these lands and make them un
desirable for residential develop
ment.
Also, the proposed 500 acre
flood control dam near Ladera
and the two-mile-long linear ac
celerator west of tiie campus
