# LESS CHEATING
## Honor Code Outrates Proctor 
### Sue Wotring Jim Fitch 
How effective is Stanford's Honor Code? In
a questionnaire circulated last spring quarter
by the Judicial Council, 12 per cent of those who
filled out the forms answered that they had. at
one time, received unpermitted aid during an
examination; similarly, an almost identical num
ber reported that they had given unpermitted aid.
Il is apparent, then, that the Honor Code is
not completely effective. However, in colleges
and universities throughout the country, statistics
have indicated that instances of cheating are con
siderably more frequent in those institutions not
using an Honor System.
In addition to being more effective in prevent
ing cheating, the Honor System adds the element
of student refoim.
.Suspensions
In many schools using a proctor system, a stu
dent caught cheating is automatically expelled.
This, of course, does not hold for schools where
enforcement is so loose that little is done to stop
cheating. At Stanford, however, if a student is
asked to leave because of an Honor Code viola
tion, he is usually allowed to rot urn; 92 per cent
of the students suspended in such cases do, in
fact, return to graduate, as compared with the
82 per cent graduation rate for entering freshmen.
Another indication of success is that during
the last nine years only one person has come
before Judicial Council on a second offense.
According to Dave Montgomery, chairman of
Men's Council, the greatest weakness of the
Honor Code is that the â€¢students do not realize
their personal responsibility In upholding the
system.
Prevent Iteuinniii);
The Judicial Council's main objective is not to
punish those who have violated the Honor Code,
but rather to prevent cheating before il begins.
II is diflicult for anyone to turn a fellow Mu

dent in for cheating. Approximately 3N per cent
of those who answered the questionnaire reported
that they would not turn in a person whom they
saw cheating during an exam.
The members of Judicial Council advocate a
system that of 'pencil tapping' which would
stop cheating as soon as it has begun, yet would
prevent one person from having to assume the
responsibility.
IVncil Tupping
If a person should observe possible cheating
during an exam, he has merely to begin tapping
hi* pencil which will attract the attention of
others around him and will let the person who is
cheating know that he is being observed. It will
also warn other students that their paper may be
being copied, while the identity of the person
cheating will not need to be made known.
Cheating during an exam only constitutes part
of the Honor Code violations. For example, in
writing a paper, where plagiarism is difficult to
detect, the student is especially on his honor to
indicate all material that has been obtained from
outside sources.
Library Use
Since the Honor Code covers all phases of aca
demic behavior, it also includes the use of the
library. Cases have been reported of students
checking out all the copies of one book from the
Reserve Book Room under false names and keep
ing the books all quarter so that other students
in the class will not be able to do the reading.
The Honor Code has been in existence at Stan
ford since IR2L when the student body started a
movement to establish an Honor system which
had previously been effectively used in the Law
School. After the one year trial period, the ad
ministration found the system so effective thai it
has now become an institution at Stanford. The
continuing effectiveness of the Honor Code will
depend only on the students,
