# Ike: 'Latin Polio Misunderstood'
## 
### 
SANTIAGO, Chile (/P) President Eisenhower, disturbed nearly to the point of anger, yester
day assailed what he said were several misunderstandings of U.S. policy in Latin America.
He singled out for sharp answers criticism that the United States slights this region in handing
out economic assistance, plays along with dictators, and drives hard bargains for its own enrichment.
The President's remarks at a meeting of Americans in Chile in a downtown theater were part of

I a full clay in which he addressed
! the Chilean Congress. He assured
Congress that a strong United
States is ready to come to the
defense of any Latin American
I victims of aggression.
U.S. Leadership
Senate President Herman Vide
la, in introducing Eisenhower,
said the United States, as leader
in the hemisphere, must come
around to a definite attitude "of
preferring your nearest neigh
bors, your truest friends, when
the need arises for support and
| help."
"The reality of an America or
ganically united already exists.
Your nation should ratify it with
the full intensity of its power,"
1 he went on.
Peace, he said, depends not only
1 on defensive military strength but
also on economic security.
Economic Aid
On the question of aid, he said,
I "The principal impetus for any
i nation's economic development
! must be its own will its own
dedicated effort. Then financial
and technical assistance from
abroad can be extremely help
ful."
In off-the-cuff remarks to 1,200
Americans and members of Chil
ean-American groups, Eisenhow
er declared that "Before indivi
duals who do not carry great re
sponsibility in the world make de
cisions and spread information, or
what they call information," they
should make sure of Ihe facts.
In his speech prepared for the
occasion he replied to three
criticisms.
Astounding
It was astounding, he said, to
heai time after time that the
| United States is helping other
! areas of the world more than Lat
in America, and "nothing could
I be more erroneous."
A statement heard in several
countries that the United States
I "crushejs the economies of Latin
America in order to enrich itself,"
he said, is a falsehood that "soon
becomes apparent to any thought
j ful person."
It was "ridiculous," he de
clared, to say that the United
; States supports dictators.
"We repudiate dictatorship in
' anv form, right or left," he added.
