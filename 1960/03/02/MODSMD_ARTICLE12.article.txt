## 
### 
CASABLANCA, Morocco (/P) -
A death-dealing triple assault by
two earthquakes and a great At
lantic tidal wave followed by
fire turned the gay beach re
sort city of Agadir into a mass
of entombing ruins yesterday.
Moroccan officials said there
were 1,000 dead obviously a
guess at the stage rescue opera
tions had reached yesterday night
and many more injured.
Hundreds of both living and
dead were buried under debris.
Spouting smoke and agonized
screams from the injured who
lay trapped measured the expanse
of the disaster.
Tuesday night the entire city
of 40,000 was being evacuated,
the Moroccan radio said.
A Fre n c h settler evacuated
from the area said, "All I can
remember is screaming and weep
ing and blood. 1 do not want to
live there any more."
Rear Adm. Frank Akers, com
mander of the U.S. Fleet air arm
in Ihe Eastern Atlantic and Medi
terranean, toured the stricken
city and reported a number of
Americans were among the in
jured.
He said it was a great disaster
and that Americans, Europeans
and Moroccans in the wreckage
were in pathetic condition, some
having been trapped more than
half a day. He reported the Aga
dir Hospital was destroyed.
Akers did not elaborate on the
number of Americans A Navy
public information officer at
Akers' headquarters in Naples,
Italy, said he interpreted the ad
miral's message there to mean
some Americans were among
those still trapped.
Akers was at the U.S. Navy
base at Pork Lyautey, Morocco,
on inspection at the time of the
quake. He spent most of the day
visiting Agadir with U.S. Ambas
sador Charles Yost.
