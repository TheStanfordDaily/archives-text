# Western Big 3 to Defy Berlin Slight Ceiling
## 
### 
WASHINGTON </P) The West
ern Big Three yesterday unex
pectedly delayed notifying Hie So
viet Union of their intention of
defying what they say in a Soviet
imposed 10,000-foot ceiling on
supply flights to West Berlin.
Top officials gave no explana
tion for the delay. But they in
sisted it did not change the joint
decision to resume such flights
soon, regardless of Soviet objec
tions.
For the second straight day, the
State Department refused to con
firm or deny reports of such an
American British-French plan.

A spokesman, however, told a
news conference: "There is no
altitude limitation whatsoever
that we recognize."
A U.S. note was to have gone
out Monday officially advising
Moscow of the Allied intention
to send high-flying planes through
assigned air corridors to West
Berlin.
It serves notice that if Khru
shchev wants to establish a tough
line before the Summit confer
ence, he will be met with tough
ness. Previously the Allies acqui
esced rather than make an issue.
The altitude argument, al
though appearing to involve only
the technical operation of newer
planes as against Communist
fears of high-altitude reconnais
sance, is symptomatic of precon
ference maneuvering.
