## Mandi Gras Carnival Is Color, Music in Motion

NEW ORLEANS. The Mardi
Gras is a slate of mind as well
as an event. The Now Orleans
Carnival is the embodiment of
joy, ol" laughter, of fun.
Carnival is a centuries-old cele
bration brought to New Orleans
in 1827, a word of farewell to
the eating of meat and to riotous
times. For after Mardi Gras, or
Fat Tuesday, comes Ash Wednes
day and the long Lenten Fast.
Carnival itself always starts on
the religious Feast of Epiphany,
the 12th night after Christmas,
Jan. 6, and lasts through Mardi
Gras Day which fluctuates be
tween Feb. 3 and March 9.
Color
Mardi Gras is color. Great big
splashes of it and tiny specks of
it against a solid background of
the purple, green, and gold car
nival colors, all in motion. That's
the parade. Enchantingly beauti
ful patterns of color in settings,
extravagant variety of color in
costume. That's the hall.
Mardi Gras is noise, music,
singing. The music of the parad
ing high school military and jazz
bands envelopes the city, the city
of laughing, shouting, singing
people half a million people.
And above it all is heard, "If
ever I cease to love," the official
Mardi Gras song.
It is the carnival organizations,
I he krewes, which are the core
of the carnival celebration. Num
bering 100 to 200 members, the
groups exist for their part in the
festivities, their parade, their tab
leux, their ball.
First on the scene was the
Krewe of Comus, around since
18.77, then came Rex, Preteus,
and Momus; until now there are
60-odd in number.
Twelf th Night
The krewes start staging their
annual balls after Twelfth Night
and the activity continues with
ever increasing frequency until
there are two balls practically
every night in February, most of
them held in the New Orleans
Municipal Auditorium especially
designed for the glamorous event.
Momus, God of Mirth, and his
merry knights paraded Thursday;
Friday, Hermes, traditionally a
parade of spectacular proportions
"descended from High Olympus"
with a 16-float extravaganza de
picting the theme "Isabella of
Spain."
Three parades and two balls
were held Saturday, eight parades
and three balls Sunday, and two
parades and a ball Monday.
Three, four and five parades a
day covering eight-mile lofcg pa
rade routes lined five, ten and
50 people deep. Neighborhood pa
rades or major downtown parades
marched by the City Hall where
they were reviewed by the Queen
and her court, greeted by the
Mayor, and the King stopped his
float to drink a toast of cham
pagne to his Queen. They were
greeted by young children on
their fathers' shoulders, men and
women all shouting, "Throw me
somethin', Mista."

And the men, the costumed
krewe members riding the floats,
did. They threw beads, small dolls,
balls, burrowing in their throw
bags so often that nearly $15,000
worth of trinkets was tossed from
just the Hermes parade.
Hermes, traditionally tho most
[spectacular of these balls, was
! held last Friday night when his
' Imperial Majesty Hermes XX, pa
tron of travel and commerce, once
again visited fho "Capital of the
Land of Make-Believe" with the
knights of his empire, climaxing
a glittering night parade with a
lavish tableaux depicting episodes
in the life of Queen Isabella of
Spain.
At the climax of the tableaux,
Her Majesty the Queen of I960
| and the six maids of her court,
| traditionally selected from among
| the families of the krewe mem
bers, were presented to his Im
perial Majesty Hermes (in the
role of Ferdinand i.

Thus, the excitement grew, the
great spirit of make-believe took
hold and reached a delirious cli
max yesterday with the carnival
of Mardi Gras, exploding into a
collage of spirit, fun, people, cos
tumes, color, and noise.
There was masking from sun
up to sunset. At 8:45 a.m. there
J was a general rush toward the
| river front when the ha r b o r
whistles sounded, signaling that
King Qulu, the King of the Negro
krewe, was on his way up the
river on the royal tugboat to land
at N e w O r 1 e a n s and parade
through the streets.
Rex, King of Carnival, paraded
through the height of the multi
tude about 11 a.m. with his enor
mous floats. Neighborhood floats
tagged closely behind the Rex
parade extending the principal
midday parading into late" after
noon. Families gathered at homes
along St. Charles Avenue, Rau
cous masses crowded Royal Street
to watch ihe parades and to take
part in the celebration.
Halls in Opposition
Last night al 9. the Mistie
Krewe of Comus paraded, form
ing ;i stirring finish to the public
part of Mardi Gras. Then the balls
of Rex and Comus were held in
opposite sides of the Municipal
Auditorium.
Exactly at midnight the King
and Queen of Rex came to the
Comus side of the Auditorium for
ceremonial meeting of the courts,
and together the courts toasted
Ihe end of the carnival.
"Mardi Gras is very old, but
it is also very young." said the
late Robert Tallant, a New Or
leans author. "It belongs to the
past, yet also to the present and
the future. The face it wears now
is not necessarily its last. Il will
exist in other forms, in other
times, in other places.
"It would be wonderful if the
clown in the grinning mask
should appear on all the main ;
streets of the world, if the blaz
ing flambeau and the rocking;
floats were everywhere, if every
where there could be a season, or
at least a day, devoted to laugh
tor."
