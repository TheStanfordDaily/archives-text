### Richard Sundeen ASSU President 
"The name of the ASSU rings
hollow," was among opening
phrases of Monday's editorial. As
a point of clarification, the ASSU
is not only the Legislature, nor
is it the group of existing ASSU
organizations, such as lIR, Poli
tical Union, Foreign Scholarship
Commission, or even the Daily.
This "hollow" ASSU is made up
of all registered students at the
University all 8900 of them.
This hollowness arose, presum
ably. through the Legislature's
declination to fulfill its function
of leadership in ideas. More
specifically, the Legislature re
fused to take a stand favoring the
Daily sponsored ban on capital
punishment.
The Daily, as understood in
Monday's editorial, desires the
Legislature to not only express
its opinion on capital punishment,
but to consider all similar contro
versies. Thus, the Legislature,
•supposedly the representative of
the ASSU (the student body),
would be taking stands on civil
rights, nuclear bomb testing, the
recognition of Red China, disarm
ament, and various other vital
and controversial issues.
Restricted
Not only is the Legislature re
stricted to non-sectarian and non
partisan policies by the Univer
sity, as the Daily admitted on
Tuesday, but it is also restricted
by its constituents. 1 strongly
question the Daily's Tuesday
statement, "The fact that opinion
on the issue may be splil is no
reason for the members to refuse
. . . to take a definite stand."
I feel fairly certain, after near
ly four years here as a student,
that Stanford students w »uld not
care to have their representatives
in their student legislature take
a stand .on any of the above not
directly-student-related issues on
behalf of the student body.
Sell Restraint
On thi-s point I believe the Leg
islature acted with self restraint
in refusing to express an opinion
on . capital punishment, which
would have implied to any off
campus individual or group that
the ASSU favors the abolition of
capital punishment or whatever
non-student issue is involved. For

the Legislature (or the represen
tatives of the studentsi to take
•such a stand would be a great
misrepresentation.
Monday's "missile-like" .ques
tion asking if the Legislature can
"really believe that Stanford stu
dents do not have AN opinion on
anything" other than campus
problems, seems to have strayed
from the "launching pad" and
missed the point. The legislators
realize that our students have not
only an opinion, but a variety of
opinions, on one or more topics,
especially those issues presently
in question.
('ontcniporary Issues
I am sure that the Legislature
members do not feel that con
temporary issues, such as capital
punishment, civil rights, etc., are
unimportant or not relevant to
today's Stanford student. As
stated in Tuesday's editorial and
in tin? ASSU Constitution, the
purpose of the ASSU is to "de
velop public responsibility." This
infers some mode «112 educational
process by which an issue can be
presented and thoroughly studied
by students. It seems that there
are other organizations, besides
the Legislature, whose functions
include this education of the stu
dents, and consequently the de
velopment of one' public respon
sibility.
Such organizations as the Stan
lord Daily, the Political Union,
the Institute of International Re
lations, and the Speech Associa
tion have a responsibility to the
ASSU to educate the student body
on contemporary issues that con
cern us as thinking citizens. Also,
Tuie Kinsolving's fine efforts
exemplify the responsible part an
individual can play in such pro
grams.
As for the Legislature and its
activities, it does not remain
aloof from just criticism. Admi
tedly, many of this body's duties
seem quite unimportant to differ
ent segments of the student body.
But these administrative duties,
even the opening of Lake Lagu
nita. are necessary.
As for the fields that the Leg
islature should pursue, it can
choose to act upon a vast field.
For example, I would hope that
it would continue its interest in
student-related problems in aca
demics. Midterms, the advisory
system, aiding in the recruitment
of new students, and the Funda
mental Standard are under con
sideration at the present time.
If you as students and members
of the ASSU arc truly interested
in the welfare of Hie Association,
I would hope that you would
make your feelings and opinions
known concerning the above com
ments and new issues to your rep
resentative in the Legislature.
