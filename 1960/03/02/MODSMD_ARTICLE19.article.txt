Protest
Editor, The Daily:
In the library there is now an
intelligent and forceful display
showing the immoral and disas
trous nature of nuclear testing
and the continuing preparation
for nuclear suicide.
It is no longer a question of
whether one is a pacifist or not;
it is rather a question of common
sense and common survival.
Frankly, I would like to have the
opportunity to live and to see
others have this opportunity.
I accuse those who have power
in the United States and other
nations of adopting policies which
are leading us to collective sui
cide. These policies, including nu
clear testing and nuclear missiles,
are in themselves immoral and
unjustifiable and because the final
result may well be collective anni
hilation, their nature is disastrous
and irrational.
I accuse all those who support
the preparation for nuclear war
as being indifferent to human suf
fering and human hopes. Those
who support the A-bomb, even
through paring taxes, are com
mitting irrevocable crimes against
humanity.
However, these are facts and
one must act. Wars will only stop
when men refuse to support Ihem.
There are things that Ihe indi
vidual can do:
il) The individual can refuse
to believe that the defense of the
West justifies Ihe risk of destroy
ing all life.
(2> One can tell others of his
concern.
(3) One can refuse to pay Fed
eral taxes or that portion of taxes
which goes for war purposes.
ill One can engage in direct
protest, even civil disobedience, if
the individual has the â€¢ necessary
moral strength.
