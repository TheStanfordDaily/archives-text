Editor, 'l'h«' Daily:
It should be most disheartening
to those who try to uphold and
advance the moral and ethical
values of civilized society to be
constantly reminded of the inane
I arguments advanced for the re
tention of such obviously gothic
jand asinine practices as capital
punishment.
t Yet. it is also equally obvious
| that those who are striving for
the abolition of capital punish
ment will eventually achieve their
goal. Ethical progress, as inexor
j able and irreversible as biological
evolution, will, in the due course
j of time, erode away the intellect
ual ignorance, the vengeful voli-
I lions, and any other such forces
that inhibit the function of right
eous intentions which are often
beclouded in the minds of men.
| lam confident that the day of
illumination shall arrive when the
! abrogation of capital punishment
i from the statute books shall re
lease us from this idiotic vestige
of barbarianism that has some
i how clung to the better part of
' oui beings.
