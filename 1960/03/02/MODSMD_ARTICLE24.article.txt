# THE 						Finish Line

A Problem Highlighted
Living group pressure and an individual's desire to compete have
again cost Stanford the services of an outstanding athlete. The
victim this time was freshman Itill Wakefield, a brilliant pitching
prospect, who broke his wrist a week ago in an intramural basket
ball game.
Wakefield's accident points up a continuing problem which seems
to get attention only when someone is hurt the problem of inter
collegiate participants taking part in the mural program. There
are two classes of such participants those clearly breaking the
mural rules, and those who are within the rules, but are nonethe
less jeopordizing their careers.
Here, in part, are the eligibility rules under which the murals
operate:
A regular member of a Varsity, Junior Varsity or Freshman
.Major Sport Squad may not take part in Intramural Athelfies dur
ing the quarter he holds such membership. During "off season"
periods a potential varsity candidate must secure permission from
tlie coach concerned for intramural participation. Subject to
permission of their coaches, members of Minor Sports squads may
take part in Intramural sports of which they are not squad mem
bers. Coaches shall keep squad rosters up to date and available to
the Intramural Director.
Varsity letterinen from Stanford or other four year institutions
are not eligible to compete in the intramural sports related to the
ones in which they have won their awards. Students in training,
or qualified, for sports squads, but for any reason are not turning
out for intercollegiate competition may enter related intramurals
only through permission of the coach concerned.
Most coaches are not at all enthused about having their men
compete in murals, either in season or out.
Track coach Payton Jordan tells his men he doesn't want J hem
competing in murals at all. Baseball coach Dutch Fehring lets his
men make the choice prior to January, but lets them know he doesn't
care to have them play touch football. Fehring alone has had three
of his men hurt in the past year.
In some respects, it might seem selfish for coaches to not want
their men competing in murals. But I think its perfectly reasonable.
Bluntly, why take a chance on a man breaking his wrist or ankle
or what -have-you.
Hul There's a Better Reason
But I think there's an even better reason to keep intercollegiate
competitors off the mural fields and courts the mural program
wasn't designed for them.
The preamble to the Intramural Handbook this years says in
part that "It is the primary purpose of the Intramural program to
provide every student in Stanford University the opportunity to
compete and participate in an athletic or recreational activity. . .
The frosh or varsity competitor is already taking advantage of
such opportunity by participating with his University team. But
when he moves into the mural program, he in many cases takes
the place of someone less talented who has no other chance to
participate in athletics. In addition, he generally upgrades the
caliber of the league so that the run-of-the-mill mural competitor
is down with the also-rans and substitutes.
The biggest force impelling frosh and varsity athletes to take
part in the mural program is living group pressure. And since most
of these athletes can't see any harm in taking part, it doesn't take
much pressure.
..This was the situation in the Wakefield case Rinconada could
get just four men to go to its basketball game, so it put the pressure
on Wakefield to play "just this one." His floormates didn't seem to
care that baseball players has been banned from murals since
January IS, due to the official start of practice.
Mural director Elwyn Bugge pointed up the problem of his of
fice catching all violations of eligibility rules. When violations are
called to his attention, the usual procedure is to throw the offend
ing team out of the league in the particular sport.
But with 1.800 participants in the program, primary responsi
bility comes back to the living group and the athlete*â€”it is here that
strict enforcement of the rules must begin.
Strict adherance to eligibility rules would take care of a good
segment of the problem. But I think the rules-should go farther and
unconditionally ban any freshman or varsity competitor from mural
play in any sport until such time as he has dropped competition
for good. This means that "red shirts" would be banned as well.
Looking through mural results from last year, examples of a
freshman center leading his dorm to the basketball free throw
crown and a red-shirt eager helping his fraternity, to the basketball
title seem to defeat some of the purpose of a mural program pro
viding low pressure athletics for students who aren't good enough
or interested enough in varsity competition.
Overall, the situation comes down to two reasons for keeping
frosh and varsity men out of murals and two ways to do it:
1) They're keeping others from getting full benefit from the
program;
2) They're running a needless risk of injury. So:
1) Adhere to the present rules;
2> Further stiffen the rules.
A Musi for All Sports Fans
A "must" for any sports fan is "Olvmpia" the German film of
the 1936 Olympics, now playing at The Movie on Kearny near
Broadway in San Francisco.
The 3'2 hour documentary is about 60 per cent track and 40 per
cent other sports. The filming is excellent, and the coverage quite
compete. Particular highlights are scenes of the marathon, espec
ially the mood and odd-angle shots of the Japanese runner who
won the race.
