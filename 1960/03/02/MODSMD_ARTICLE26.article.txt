leges on Stanford's Angell Field.
The outlook is for a successful
season for the Papoos-e spikesters.
Coach Jim Terrill points to the
depth of his well-balance squad,
with promising athletes in al
most every event. But this does
not mean thai there are no stand
outs, for many of his boys won
lop high school honors in 19.">9.
The track men should be espec
ially strong in the sprints, led by
Ken Emanuels from Bellevue.
Wash. Although Emanuels has
iun the 100 in 9.9, his speciality
is the 440, where he broke the
Washington prep record with a
time of 48.5.

men: Jeff Lombardi of North
Hollywood, Herb Meadowcroft of
San Anselmo, and Bob Taylor
from Los Angeles.

ning events should be half milers
Bob Holgerson and Jim Davis.

high school in Wichita, Kan., that
produced star miler Archie San
Romani last year, while Davis is
from Philadelphia. Milers include
Jim Quade and Robin Nowinski;
Nowinski doubles in the two mile. |
Big Boys
Prospects in the field events
are outstanding, as the squad
features some really big weight
men. Chuck Buehler, standing 6-5 j
and weighing more than 235
pounds, led the nation for a time
last year in the shot put.
He heaved the 12-pound missile
.59-2 1 u while competing for Whit

Creek, is even bigger, at 6-7 and
250 pounds-plus, Weill didn't both
er with the smaller shot but threw
the 16-pound shot 46-4 and the
high school discus 158 feet. Bob
Laird and Ralph Marron back up
these two giants,"and Ted Wright
competes in the shot put and
javelin.
Top pole vaulter among the
frosh is Phil White, from Carmel,
who last year reached 13-3. White
is also a broad jumper. John
Haynie of Grand Junction. Colo.,
who pulled a double in the 1959
Colorado Prep championships by
winning both the pole vault and
the high jump, shows a mark of
6-4 in the latter event.
National Leader
In the flat jumping events,
Sheridan Downey of Oakland is
the leader. Downey broad-jumped
23-2. and during his junior year
posted the top high school mark
in the country for the hop-step
jump.

Rounding out ihe squad are Ihe
hurdlers, topped by Hill Batchelor
of Upland. Bill Wandrey and Rick
