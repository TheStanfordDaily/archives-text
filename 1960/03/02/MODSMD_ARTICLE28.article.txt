# Husky Cagers Like Card Grids: So-so Team, But Top Individuals
## 
### 
Washington's basketballers are
borrowing a trick out of the Stan
ford football bag they've got a
team that doesn't win much of
anything, but their individuals
are right at the top statistically.
Weekly Big cage stats make
it evident that Bill Hanson has
a hammerlock on the scoring
chase, with IX9 points for his
completed loop season. Darrall
Imhoff of Cal would have to rid
dle Stanford defenses with 48
points this weekend to beat Han
son.
Stanford's John Arrillaga is
third with 116 points, only ten
ahead of the seventh-placer, Cal's
Earl Shultz.
Hanson and teammate Lyle
Bakken top the field goal shoot
ers with marks of 56.2 and -15.2
per cent.

The rest of the leaders: Im
hoff in rebounds with 134, Gary
Cunningham of UCLA with 21-
l'or-21 at the free throw line, and
California in team offense, de
fense, and rebounding.
