# CUBAN LECTURE
## 4 Colleges, Press To Blame for Cuban Impasse 
### Ross Hermann 
A "lack of conversation" is to
blame for the deterioration of re
lations between the United States
and Cuba, Professor Ronald Hil
ton said last night in a Tuesday
Evening Series lecture.
Hilton, speaking on "Cuba Un
der Fidel Castro," said that Amer
ican universities have failed to
create understanding between the
two countries. He felt that the
promotion of better relations in
the future must come, at least in
part, through the universities.
He likened the current period
to the end of the middle ages. At
that time the loss of the sense of
good resulted in the Reformation
and the loss of truth brought
about the Renaissance.
Radical Transl'ormation
Hilton said that we are in an
equally uncertain age out of
which must come a "radical trans
foration of our universities."
Hilton felt that the universities
are not entirely to blame and laid
part of the responsibility on the
business community.
He also attacked the mass
media of being "simply unfair
and stupid" in its coverage of
Cuba. He said that the United
States and the world "lives under
constant mass media pressure."
In this atmosphere academic
thought becomes considerably dif
ficult.
Villain
He said that most Americans
think of Castro as a villain lie
cause of the one-sided way Ik 4 has
been portrayed by Amorican
newspapers. Cubans, on the other
hand because of the mass media
pressure they have been subject
ed to, believe that all of their ills
stem from the United States.
Having visited Cuba, Hilton ex
pressed the belief that the Cubans
are sincerely trying to establish
a decent and honest government.
Most Cubans think that it is less
corrupt than any previous govern
ment and support the new order.
Although there is a definite
threat of Communism, he said
that most Cuban leaders are sober
young professional men who are
trying to build a nation from
scratch.
