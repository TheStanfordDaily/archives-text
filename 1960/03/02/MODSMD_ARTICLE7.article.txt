## Solons Hurl Harsh Words In Rights Fray 
### 
WASHINGTON (/Pi A South
ern senator publicly described a
Supreme Court decision as "crap."
last night and a Northern sen
ator accused Senate leaders of de
ception.
The harsh words flew in the
Senate chamber as the legislators
went into the second night of
round-the-clock' debate on civil
rights legislation.
Tempers were starting to fray
but neither the 18-man Dixie
group orating steadily against the
bill nor the Northern civil rights
supporters showed signs of giv
ing in.
The denunciation of Ihe Su
premo Court's decision Monday
upholding the 1957 civil rights
law, came from Mississippi's
Democratic Sen. James Q. East
land.
Print Decision
Sen. Everett M. Dirksen of Illi
nois, the GOP leader, asked unan
imous consent to have the court's
decision printed in the daily Con
gressional Record.
"If that's a decision of the U.S.
Supreme Court it's not worth
printing, and I object," Eastland
declared. Dirksen repeated his re
quest moments later.
"I don't want this record clut
tered with such era])," Eastland
snapped.
Eastland's renewed objection
kept the court decision out of the
Record.
Nearly two hours later East
land relented and allowed Dirksen
to have the Supreme Court de
cision put into the Record.
Amendment Attempt
The verbal volley against t lie
party leaders came from Sen.
Paul Douglas iD-111. >, a civil
rights advocate, after he attempt
ed to offer an amendment aimed
at promoting integration of
whites and Negroes in schools.
He was told that under a "gen
tlemen's agreement" announced
by the leadership Monday he
could not offer an amendment
without unanimous consent.
Douglas objected that lie did not
so understand the agreement but
the chair held unanimous con
sent necessary.
Douglas then denounced the
agreement and said "the result
of this elaborate proposition was
simple deception."
'No Deception'
"There was no deception in
volved," replied the Democratic
majority leader, Lyndon M. John
son of Texas. He said the agree
ment had been made abundantly
clear when it was announced.
In the end peace was restored
at least temporarily when Doug
las got his amendment in by
unanimous consent. That paved
the way for a speech by Eastland
running far into the night.
For Ihe second night in a row,
senators bedded down in the
cloakrooms, offices and other
spots to be handy for the quorum
calls normal in filibuster strategy.
Tiie outnumbered Southerners
accused their foes of political
fakery and protested against the
"physical torture" of day-and
night sessions.
