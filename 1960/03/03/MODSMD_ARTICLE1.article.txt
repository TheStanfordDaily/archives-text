# Death Penalty Before Solons
## 
### 
(am/filed from Associated I'rcss
SACRAMENTO Gov. Brown's bill to abolish the death penalty
was sent to the Legislature yesterday.
It was introduced by six Democratic senators, headed by Sen.
Fred Farr (D-Carmel), after Brown sent a message to both houses
calling capital punishment a "gross failure."

The Senate immediately started
going through the motions to
defeat the bill.
A hearing on the bill was sched
uled for next Wednesday, by Sen.
Edwin J. Regan (D-Weaverville),
chairman of the Judicial Commit
tee. There was no doubt among
senators that the decision would
be against the bill.
A poll of 15 committee members
showed only three definite votes
in favor of the bill.
Regan said he assumed that
when the committee defeats tho
bill the Senate will adjourn the
special session and proceed with
other matters.
It seemed clear that the strat
egy was to defeat the bill in the
Senate, avoiding any test in the
Assembly.
It is possible, however, that
pro-abolition Assemblymen may
introduce a bill of their own in
the lower house.
New Execution Date
While the Legislature was plan
ning its strategy, Superior Court
Judge Clement D. Nye set May
2 as the new execution date for
Caryl Chessman, the man who
has eluded death for 11years.
At the University of Californ
ia, a student committee for the
abolition of capital punishment
has formed. The committee is un
der the direction of David Armor,
president of the ASUC, and
Michael Appleby, president of the
university YMCA.
In an open letter the commit
tee said: "The State Legislature
convened on Monday to discuss
the case of Caryl Chessman and
the question of capital punish
ment. In our minds, although
there are some differences of
opinion, the main issue is the
abolition of capital punishment.
Student Protest
"Regardless of how one feels
about Chessman as an individual,
we believe both the moral and
the practical case against capital
punishment is very strong and
very urgent.
"Since there is now way of
knowing how long the session will
last, we are mobilizing as quickly
as possible pressure groups to
educate people and work actively
in any organization that may
have an influence on the final
outcome.
"We feel that a student-orga
nized campaign from all univer
sities and colleges in the state
would be an effective force in
advancing the abolition of capi
tal punishment.
Seeking Support
"Therefore we ai*e interested in
knowing if your campus would
be interested in supporting such
a campaign. We would like your
suggestions as well as any in
formation you may have as soon
as possible."
The committee suggested
means of starting a campus cam
paign, such as rallies, demonstra
tions. mass meetings with speak
ers, boothes for the dissemination
of literature, and the circulation
of petitions among students and
faculty.
At Stanford, Tuie Kinsolving,

against capital punishment, an

signatures on the petitions he
circulated last week.
He presented the petitions to
officials in Gov. Brown's office

SACRAMENTO Gov. Brown's bill to abolish the death penalty
was sent to the Legislature yesterday.
It was introduced by six Democratic senators, headed by Sen.
Fred Farr (D-Carmel), after Brown sent a message to both houses
calling capital punishment a "gross failure."

The Senate immediately started
going through the motions to
defeat the bill.
A hearing on the bill was sched
uled for next Wednesday, by Sen.
Edwin J. Regan (D-Weaverville),
chairman of the Judicial Commit
tee. There was no doubt among
senators that the decision would
be against the bill.
A poll of 15 committee members
showed only three definite votes
in favor of the bill.
Regan said he assumed that
when the committee defeats tho
bill the Senate will adjourn the
special session and proceed with
other matters.
It seemed clear that the strat
egy was to defeat the bill in the
Senate, avoiding any test in the
Assembly.
It is possible, however, that
pro-abolition Assemblymen may
introduce a bill of their own in
the lower house.
New Execution Date
While the Legislature was plan
ning its strategy, Superior Court
Judge Clement D. Nye set May
2 as the new execution date for
Caryl Chessman, the man who
has eluded death for 11years.
At the University of Californ
ia, a student committee for the
abolition of capital punishment
has formed. The committee is un
der the direction of David Armor,
president of the ASUC, and
Michael Appleby, president of the
university YMCA.
In an open letter the commit
tee said: "The State Legislature
convened on Monday to discuss
the case of Caryl Chessman and
the question of capital punish
ment. In our minds, although
there are some differences of
opinion, the main issue is the
abolition of capital punishment.
Student Protest
"Regardless of how one feels
about Chessman as an individual,
we believe both the moral and
the practical case against capital
punishment is very strong and
very urgent.
"Since there is now way of
knowing how long the session will
last, we are mobilizing as quickly
as possible pressure groups to
educate people and work actively
in any organization that may
have an influence on the final
outcome.
"We feel that a student-orga
nized campaign from all univer
sities and colleges in the state
would be an effective force in
advancing the abolition of capi
tal punishment.

"Therefore we ai*e interested in
knowing if your campus would
be interested in supporting such
a campaign. We would like your
suggestions as well as any in
formation you may have as soon
as possible."
