## Abortion Law Often Disregarded 
### Roger Tippy 
Even though California State
Law prohibits the termination of
pregnancy except in specific situ
ations, the decisions which hos
pitals make on whether to per
form abortions often disregard
the law.
This was a -point stressed by
Dr. Ralph J. Gampell in a talk
last night on "Some New Medical-
Legal Problems," sponsored by
Sigma Phi Sigma.
Survey Kesults
Addressing a small audience at
the Women's Clubhouse Gampell
described the results of a survey
of 27 hospitals taken by him and
Professor Herbert J. Packer last
fall.
They sent out a questionnaire
to the hospitals describing 11
hypothetical cases of pregnant
women; cases such as a chronic
heart condition, schizophrenia,
and a congenial idiocy probable
for the infant. The hospitals were
each asked which of the abortions
they would be willing 1o perform.
When the answers were tabu
lated, each of the 11 hypothetical
women could have received an
abortion at some of the hospitals.
However, sections 274 and 275 of
the California! Penal Code say
that an act intending to cause a
woman to miscarry is a felony,
except when necessary to have
the life of the mother.
Clearly Illegal
As the cases were set up, (Jam
pel 1 said only two of them could
legally aborted, two others might
be legal abortions, and abortion
in the other seven cases would
have been clearly illegal.
He concluded that public opin
ion is not reflected in the state
legal code, since the abortions
which the hospitals would per
form are sanctioned more by pub
lic opinion than by the law.
He suggested the policy and
decision-making boards on the
hospital staffs should be given
more legal powers.
