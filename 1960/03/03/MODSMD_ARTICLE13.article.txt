## Lecture System Can Be Effective Way to Learn 
### Ross Johnson 
The importance of the lecture
system in the Stanford educa
tional philosophy is beyond dis
pute.
Freshman and general studies
courses may include or be supple
mented by discussion group; hon
ors programs and some depart
mental programs may include
seminars; Senior Colloquia may
be required of all A.B. candidates;
yet the vast majority of courses
usually taken by the Stanford
student consist of reading assign
ments and formal lectures, some
times supplemented by papers or
problem sets the so-called lec
ture system.
Finances Dictate
Financial realities, we are told,
dictate the continued existence of
this method of learning at Stan
ford. This system compares un
favorably in many respects with
tutorial and seminar systems em
phasizing small group inter
change of ideas.
Yet occasional successful and
stimulating lecture courses at
Stanford have revealed, in spite
of whatever inherent limitations,
that this system can serve as an
effective approach to learning.
Such occasional successes only
emphasize the dismal failure of
many of S t a n 112 or d ' s lecture
courses.
It is not especially difficult to
conceive of an effective lecture
course, which would rely primar
ily on basic reading assignments,
supplemented by additional rec
ommended readings. Lectures
would not attempt.to cover the
scope and detail of the course,
but neither would they consist of
trivial facts or meaningless di
gression.
Supplement
Lectures would truly supple
ment the reading, adding perti
nent information of a nature not
easily obtainable by limited read
ing. Explanation, not of obvious
but of difficult concepts would
be made. The student would learn
how one educated mind amalga
mates and interprets ihe great
mass of data comprising the sub
ject matter of the course.
Such a lecture is unfortunately
too seldom at Stanford. We seem
to have progressed little beyond
the pre-Gutenberg medieval uni
versity lectures, where a man who
had acquired some knowledge

I could most effectively communi
cate it by word of mouth.
The printing press has been in
vented. and each succeeding fresh
man class is able to read better
and better. Still, how many Stan
ford lectures consist of nothing
! more than a rehashing, some
times clever but often dull, of
, the reading material. Pertinent
| additional information is limited,
; helpful explanation and interpre
tation are lacking, and digression
is common.
Professor's Responsibility
The professor must accept the
major responsibility if his lec
j tures fail to meet the standards
[of effectiveness. Many lectures
which repeat reading assignments
and which are unorganized and
I incoherent in themselves seem
largely the result of lack of prep
aration.
In many departments, lectures,
even if carefully prepared, can
[ not be repeated year after year,
i without revision, with any expec
tation of success. Every scholar
; is not a great teacher, but he can
certainly attempt to make his
j lectures as meaningful as pos
sible.
Others, too, must share this
blame. A strenuous teaching
j schedule will severely restrict the
! lecture preparation time to be
devoted to any one course. Per
haps' in the bustle of publishing
| (thus not perishing) little time
remains for this lecture prepara
tion.
The student is qualified to
i judge his lectures as is no one
I else. He who eats is the best
I judge of the meal, Aristotle has
said, not he who cooks. The stu
dent can judge the value of his
lectures by estimating what he
has gained in any course from
! the lecture alone.
Repetition
At Stanford, he increasingly
seems to decide that many lec
tures consist of mere repetition,
dull at that, and justifiably at
tempts to utilize such lecture
time more profitably, even by
| sleeping.
Yet when such ineffective lec
tures seem to characterize a great
many of his courses, the student
may well ask what lie is receiv
! ing for his $335 each quarter,
besides a prestige diploma, that
is not obtainable through personal
initiative and a public library
! card.
