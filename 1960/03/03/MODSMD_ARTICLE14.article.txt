### Richard Sundeen ASSU President 
Last Thursday evening the
Legislature decided to study the
question of midterms and the
need of them. It was hoped that
the findings could be presented
to the faculty in an attempt to
show student feeling toward the
midterm.
Perhaps the two greatest criti
cisms of the use of midterms are
that they cut down the student's
time for actual study and "medi
tation" of the subject, and that,
in many instances, they require
more memorization than thought
of the material.
However, a midterm is the per
rogative of the faculty. To only
write in criticism of it is not
beneficial and will not result in
any change by the faculty. If
those who favor the discontinu
ance of examinations during the
quarter wish to succeed, they
must be able to present a better
alternative. Thus, I would ask
you to not only express your
positive feeling concerning mid
terms to your Legislature repre

sentative but also any commend
able substitution or recommenda
tions that you may have.
The A.S.S.U. elections will bo
held during the last three weeks
of April. Also, applications for
Student Financial Manager for
The Associated Students are clue
by tomorrow. The A.S.S.U. offices
of President, Vice President and
Student Financial Manager are
very, very rewarding experiences.
The campaign alone provides
the candidate with new and vivid
insight into presenting one's self
to others and of learning of
others' behavior. I would whole
heartedly recommend that any
student interested, even in the
slightest degree, in the activity
involved in such positions seri
ously consider standing for elec
tion.
The A.S.S.U. Constiution and
By-Laws lists the qualifications
and duties of all A.S.S.U. offices.
Also, the present A.S.S.U. office
holders will be happy to explain
their work and the campaign pro
cedures and to answer any other
questions.
