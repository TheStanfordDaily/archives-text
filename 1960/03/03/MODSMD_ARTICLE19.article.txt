Experimental Period
Editor, The Daily:
The issues on capital punish
; ment are not black and white.
I The unqualified assertion (hat no
life shall be taken by the stale
is unacceptable to many on
| grounds that the most effective
deterrent to murder is the death
! penalty.
That a deterrent to murder is
for the public good is unquestion-
I able. Whether capital punishment
lis the most effective deterrent is
[moot. We assume fear of death
is the most intense of all fear:
"skin for skin, aye all that a man
hath will he give for his life."
A hasty decision to abolish cap
ital punishment might defeat the
entire movement. Such has been
1 the case in eight states which
abolished the death penalty, then
latei- reinstated it because of
t effects unforeseeable at the time
of abolition.
For example, the death penalty
1 was re-established in Colorado in
1901 because, during the period
of abolition, lynch law broke out.
Missouri affords another ex
; ample; capital punishment was
; abolished in 1917, only to bo re-
I instated in 1919 on grounds that

professional rohhers about to be
caught had no hesitation in kill
ing police officers.
Examples of the effect of abo
lition, both pro and con, are num
erous. If any sense is to be made
of them, it is this: that the effect
of abolition varies locally. . . .
The only justification for capi
tal punishment lies in the public
good. If capital punishment does
not contribute thereto, it should
be abolished. Whether it does is
unsettled. 1. for lack of evidence
as to the deterrent effect, and 2.
because we have no basis to pro
diet what effects abolition might
have in this jurisdiction.
Therefore, it is suggested that
the death penalty be suspended
in California for an experimental
period of, say, five years, during
which time a committ e e be
formed to gather evidence upon
which to arrive at a sound deci
sion.
