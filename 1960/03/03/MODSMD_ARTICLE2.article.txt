# PROFESSOR SPEAKS
## De Gaulle Threatened By Algeria 
### 
Professor Gordon Wright
weigh t e d the "odds heavily
| against De Gaulle" in the coming
year before a small audience at
the Breakers Club last night, and
warned that civil war could result
from the decline of the De Gaul
list government.
Characterizing De Gaulle as "at
I the summit of power and popu
larity," Wright looks for the pres
ident's power to wane in the com
ing months unless he is able to
negotiate an Algerian settlement.
Anti-De Gaulle Groups
If an Algerian settlement is not
forthcoming in the next year,
i Wright believes that the "chances
of civil war are considerably bet
ter than.fifty-fifty."
The pr o fes so r named five
groups where anti-De Gaulle sen
timent is growing stronger:
• The right wing of the right
wing which has turned "its dis
like into vindictiveness" since the
Algerian uprising.
• The political opportunists,
who are waiting for De Gaulle's
fatal political mistake.
• The Communist party which
fears thai fascism could result
from the present government.
• The peasants who feel that
they are not getting their share
! of the country's income.
• The "egghead left" whose
leaders share the Irelief that the
Fifth Republic's only hope is "pur
ification of the system — violent
revolution."
Right May Revolt
Wright, however, does not look
to the left for a revolution, but
rather to the right where a group
of anti-Gaullist might forceably
challenge the government over
the Algerian situation.
Such an armed threat would
be countered by the Communist
Party, out of fear that rightist
! victory would result in a fascist
government.
Last night's speaker is current
ly executive head of the history
department, a position he as
; sumed shortly after his arrival
from the University of Oregon in
! 1957. He is a graduate of Sor
bonne University and a former
Slate Department official.
Wright, though his study at
i Sorbonne, is a personal acquaint
anee of De Gaulle and is an ex
pert on the political atmosphere
with which the French leader is
j confronted.
