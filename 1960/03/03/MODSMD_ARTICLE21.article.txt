### Ron Rapoport 
Conn Findlay yanked the starting cord on the antique Mercury
outboard motor and directed the beat-up old launch out into the
Bay. It passed tiie Standard .Oil refineries and the cement-making
and sulfur-processing plants on the light and a huge pile of salt
on the left which was waiting to be loaded onto boats that would
take it to Japan. Sometimes seals can be seen at various places
in the water, but it was not a good day for seals.
The launch went two and a half miles into the Bay where it
was awaited by the two long thin shells which make up the Stan
ford crew. Usually the crew practices three miles from its starting
point on shore, but it was windy today and the water was too
rough farther out.

Findlay yelled at the boats
through a megaphone. It didn't
seem possible that they could
hear him because of the noise
of flic wind, but they obviously
could and they obeyed his com
mand to line up along side each
other.
The call was for one minute
wind sprints which turned out
to he a drill where both boats
row at a high rate of speed for a
minute, rest for a short time
and then repeat the rowing. The
launch followed along behind
the rapidly moving crafts as
fast as it could, bill it could
barely keep up.
After these sprints Findlay
called for what must be a partic
ularly upsetting drill. He calls the
strokes at uneven intervals and
each man must be ready to move
at the exact instant he calls the
move. It probably gives an exalted
feeling of power to have 16 guys
tensely waiting to obey your com-

mand at (he split-second that you give it. A while of this and that
was all for the day. The crews started Hie two and a half miles
back to shore.
