The shells are of some interest. Each of these 60 foot jobs costs in
Iho neighborhood of $1,800. They weigh 28."5 pounds, but are only
.5/32 of an inch thick. This is thin enough for a heavy-footed in
dividual to put his foot through; an occurance which takes i place
about once a year.
The Stanford crew owns between $20,000 and $25,000 worth of
shells of various sizes. There are the regular eight man competi
tion shells, two-man shells and shells made for use by one man.
The crew also has a large new clubhouse which houses the crafts
along with weight lifting equipment and jump ropes, the purpose
of which is obvious.
This amount of equipment, however, is misleading. The crew got
it the hard way. The Stanford athletic department has little to do
with the crew, outside of a token grant of $3,000 a year. Their
coaches, Findlay and Phil Waters, are not paid and the clubhouse
was built and shells purchased with money solicited from "friends
of the crew."
The crew built the clubhouse with 1 heir own little hands and one
of the shells was even donated by a helpful alum in Japan.
