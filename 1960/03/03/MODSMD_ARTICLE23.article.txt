# The
						All-Stanford Olympics

### 
Findlay is the possessor of an Olympic Gold Medal for crew which
he won in 1956. He won in a division called pair-oared with cox.
(This means that there were three men in the boat but that only
two Were rowing.) The other two men in the Gold Medal boat were
Dan Ayrault and Kurt Seifurt, both Stanford students.
Actually it was almost an all-Stanford Olympics crew-wise in
Melbourne tour years ago, because the pair-oared without cox
(two men in the boat, both rowing) was won by Jim Fifer and
Dewey llecbt, who were also students on the Farm. Needless to
say, Findlay has his sights set on Koine this summer.
The crew is a pretty jovial bunch and have a certain amount
of tradition. For instance, there was the time that Johnson and John
son donated a whole case of outdated adhesive tape which the crew
had no trouble disposing of with less than a year's worth of blisters.
Nowadays whenever a blister present-s itself to a crewman, he
merely goes to the health center. These trips are made so often
and the blisters are so impressive that the nurses at the center
usually exclaim loudly and demand that the owner of the blister lay
off for a while. The standard answer to this type of outburst has
become, "Oh. shut up and put something on it." Very effective.
The crew annually awards its "High Dive Award" which goes
to the member catching the most beautiful "crab." In this case a
crab is when you neglect to get your oar out of the water fast
enough on the backstroke and catch the handle in your stomach.
A particularly good crab will throw its owner out of the boat in a
wide arc. Delightful.
