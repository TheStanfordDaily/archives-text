# Farm's Landlocked Navy

### 
Chief Petty Officer Frank S. Partridge of Stanford's NROTC unit
bends close over one of the 'ships' in the Farm's 'Navy.' Seems
there are a number of electronic model ships in the basement
headquarters in ( Ã¼bberley of the NROTC. The models are ship
handling demonstrators. They sail a very large plastic 'sea' in
the unit's very large room, demonstrating various tricks of the
sea-goiiif* trade. The 'ship' is powered by batteries, and is radio
controled.
