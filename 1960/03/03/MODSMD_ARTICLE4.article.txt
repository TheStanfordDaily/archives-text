# REPUBLICAN SECRETARY:
## Chessman Reprieve To Hurt Gov. Brown 
### Barry Greenberg 
"The reprieve granted to Caryl
Chessman by Governor Brown is
an illegal maneuver" and prob
ably will cost him a great deal of
support, Caspar W. Weinberger
Republican State Central Com
mittee secretary, said last night.
Weinberger spoke at Muir
Lounge on California politics. He
said that there i-s nothing in the
California constitution that per
mits Brown to grant the GO day
stay of execution.
"The constitution does allow
the governor to grant a reprieve
up to 15 days but that's all,"
Weinberger stated.
"Besides, it is a national law
that after the Supreme Court has
turned down a reprieve plea-twice
there is nothing to save that man
from execution," Weinberger
said.
Weinberger, who lost to Stan
ley Mosk in the Attorney Gen
eral race in 1958, also stated that
he feels the Republican position
is much better that it was two
years ago.
"In order for the Republicans
to win in California they must get
about 90 per cent of the Repub
licans out to vote and must also
capture about 25 per cent of the
Democratic vote," he said. "Tradi

tionally the Republicans succeed,"
he commented.
Weiberger pointed out that the
tide turned in favor *>112 I lie Demo
crats in 1958 because of the
heavy labor union vote caused by
the right-to-work controversy,
but now there are no such issues
so things should return to normal.
