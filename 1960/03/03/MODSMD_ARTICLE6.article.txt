# Objections to Land Plan Answered
## 
### Elna Rodenhouse, Staff Editor 
The announcement (hat Stanford will ask
Palo Alto to annex the land that is being
considered for use by Ampex Corp. has
raised some question about Stanford's land
policy and the legitimacy of the recent ob
jections of Los Altos Hills residents to
industrial development in the foothills.
In the past, Stanford has had an agree
ment with Palo Alto. Upon Stanford's re
quest Palo Alto annexes Stanford land that
is to be used for industrial purposes. Stan
ford has to approve the tenant's plans for
the building and landscaping, and provide
for utilities and roads.
Pays Palo Alto Taxes
Palo Alto then taxes the firm on 1 his
land, to help pay for maintenance of the
roads, sewer and flood controls, etc. At least
half of the firm's taxes go for support of
the Palo Alto Unified School District, which
serves both Palo Alto and a portion of Los
Altos Hills.
Recently, the residents of Los Altos Hills
passed a number of resolutions which ob
jected to Stanford's development 6l' its land
reserve for industrial purposes.
The main objections were these:
1. The area set aside for Ampex, at
Arastradero and Fremont Roads, was across
the street from property which had been
zoned for residential use. If Ampex went
into this land, it would have to be zoned
for industrial use, which, the Los Altos
Hills people felt, would debase the value
of their land.
2. Stanford has "encroached into areas
which have long been considered residential
foothills potential," and is "completely dis
regarding the ideas and goals of their neigh
bors."

3. "If Stanford persists in these plans, it
is forcing an additional tax load on the resi
dents of the adjacent communities, who
must underwrite drastic increases in ex
penses for roads to cope with increased
traffic, sewers, flood control, and other pub
lic services for the ultimate benefit of Stan
ford."
Mistaken Assumptions
However, Ihe residents mistakenly as
sumed that Stanford had been planning all
along to use this area for residential pur
poses. and that Stanford had not let the
people in I he area know of its changing
plans for development of the area.
Stanford had once planned this foot
hills area for residential use. but as costs
of the University rose, the original plans
had to change also.
In line with this. Stanford hoped to use
more of its land for the type of industry
that Ampex represents: industry which con
tributes to the educational development of
both Stanford and the nation.
In addition. Stanford representatives
have constantly attended meetings of the
planning commissions and councils of the
various Peninsula communities, and. ac
cording to a University spokesman, have
kept these groups and their constituents
(through newspaper coverage) appraised of
Stanford land plans.
Inconsiderate (Mantling
The residents also assumed that Stan
ford's planning was without consideration
for the local political, economic, sociological
and aesthetic factors. According to a state
ment in yesterday's Daily by Thomas Ford,
staff counsel for Stanford, this is not so.
The residents also assumed thai access
roads to the Ampex site would go through
Los Altos Hills. major access road

is Fremont Ave., improvements of which
Stanford would take on for places where
the road went through Stanford land. No
thoroughfare goes through the residential
section of Los Altos Hills, nor is Stanford
planning one.
As for their objections, Stanford feels
that, in the development of the Ampex area,
it can create architecturally beautiful build
ings and landscaping, such that properly
values of the nearby residential-zoned areas
would not go down.
When the General Electric part of the
Industrial Park was first proposed, the resi
dents of College Terrace sent complaints
similar to those of Los Altos Hills to the
University. The University built the Gen
eral Electric building and landscaped the
area, then leased it to General Electric.
(Later it was sold to G.E.t
( hanged Their Minds
The residents of College Terrace later
sent a resolution to G.E., congratulating
them on the building and landscaping. Prop
.erty values in College Terrace have not gone
down, as was expected by the residents,
but have instead risen.
Stanford, furthermore, is neither "en
croaching" into "residential potential." nor
is "disregarding the ideas and goals of their
neighbors," because the assumption by the
residents of the area that this land would
remain residential was faulty to begin with,
and because Stanford has always tried to
remain aware of the local problems.
Stanford, in addition, is not "forcing an
additional taxation load" on these residents,
because Stanford will assume the costs of
constructing the road* and providing for
utilities, and the firm, when annexed, will
assume the mi intenance costs, in the form
of taxes.
