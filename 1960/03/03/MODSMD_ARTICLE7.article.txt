# Tear Gas, Gunfire Mark President's Uruguayan Arrival
## 
### 
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay I A') The windup of President Eisenhower's triumphant South Ameri
can tour was marred yesterday by clashes between anti-U.S. student demonstrators and police who
fought them with whacking sabers, tear gas, fire hose and a bit of aimless gunfire.
At one point the President got a whiff of tear gas that had his eyes smarting.
Later, on leaving the Uruguayan Congress, ihe President's car took an unannounced detour

through relatively empty streets
to avoid passing areas where the
trouble had erupted.
Cars carrying other members
of the presidential party returned
by the earlier route and were
jeered by groups of students obvi
ously annoyed that they were not
given another chance to demon
strate in front of Eisenhower.
Ike Unruffled
Eisenhower assured Ben i to
Nardone, 54-year-old president of
the Uruguayan Government
Council, that he attached no im
portance to the incidents.
Thousands of Uruguayans lined
the motorcade route from Car
rasco Airport and displayed home
made banners of greeting.
Police were quoted as saying it
was the biggest reception ever
given anyone in Montevideo. Re
porters on both trips said the
warmth of the reception in this
little democracy equaled or sur
passed the welcomes given Eisen
hower on his Asian tour last De
cember.
Serious Demonstrations
But the anti-U.S. demonstra
tions were far more serious than
any the President had run into
in Brazil, Argentina and Chile,
the other countries visited on his
10-day tour.
The major clash between police
and students occurred in front of
the school of architecture of the
University of Montevideo. The
President later ran into police
tear gas at the main headquar
ters of the university, where po
lice cleared away demonstrating
students just before the motor
cade passed.
James J. Rowley, chief of the
White House Secret Service de
tail, who always rides in the front
seat of the President's car, said
after passing through the teat
gas Eisenhower sat clown to wipe
his eyes.
Rowley said the President was
upon his feet within a minute and
seemed none the worse for the
incident. Press Secretary James
Hagerty also said later Eisen
hower suffered no aftereffects.
