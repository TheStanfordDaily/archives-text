# CIVIL RIGHTS BATTLE
## Dixie Senators Continue Round-the-Clock Talks 
### 
WASHINGTON (A') Sen. Russell B. Long (D-La.), whose
father Iluey P. Long was a mightly filihusterer. helped to carry
along the Southern fight against civil rights legislation in the Sen
ate yesterday.
Long keyed his speech to a familiar Southern charge that the

senators pressing for a new civil
rights law are interested more in
Negro votes for themselves than
in protecting Negroes' rights.
Yesterday was the third day
of round-the-clock sessions aimed
at smashing the Dixie filibuster.
The Senate took a 15-minute
morning recess for the first ac
utal break since continuous ses
sions began at noon Monday.
No Weakening
With no sign of weakening on
either side, it appeared the dead
lock and the continuous sessions
would run well into next week
and maybe longer—probably with
a break over Sunday.
Republican senators set a party
meeting for this afternoon, and
the likelihood was that they will
discuss civil rights strategy.
At the same time, nine Negro
•students were ordered expelled
from an Alabama college while
more than 50 Negro men and
women were arrested in Nash
ville, Tenn., after refusing to
leave a bus station lunch counter
in the face of a bomb threat.
Alabama Students Out
The Alabama Board of Educa
tion ordered nine students ex
pelled from Alabama State Col
lege at Montgomery and 20 others
placed on probation for taking
part in recent antisegregation
demonstrations. The expulsion
order is effective tomorrow.
Gov. John Patterson told the
board the action was necessary
"to prevent bloodshed in this city.
If we ever bow to the threat of a
mob. we are on our way (jut and
they'll get more arrogant every
day." He said continued demon
strations could lead ultimately to
"riot, injury and possible death."
An estimated 1.000 Alabama
State Negro students voted
last night to stay away from
classes until the nine are rein
stated.
Students chanted, "Can't go
Alabam, we go Auburn." This
was considered a threat to seek
enrollment at one of the state's
two white universities.

two white universities.
WASHINGTON (A') Sen. Russell B. Long (D-La.), whose
father Iluey P. Long was a mightly filihusterer. helped to carry
along the Southern fight against civil rights legislation in the Sen
ate yesterday.
Long keyed his speech to a familiar Southern charge that the

senators pressing for a new civil
rights law are interested more in
Negro votes for themselves than
in protecting Negroes' rights.
Yesterday was the third day
of round-the-clock sessions aimed
at smashing the Dixie filibuster.
The Senate took a 15-minute
morning recess for the first ac
utal break since continuous ses
sions began at noon Monday.
No Weakening
With no sign of weakening on
either side, it appeared the dead
lock and the continuous sessions
would run well into next week
and maybe longer—probably with
a break over Sunday.
Republican senators set a party
meeting for this afternoon, and
the likelihood was that they will
discuss civil rights strategy.
At the same time, nine Negro
•students were ordered expelled
from an Alabama college while
more than 50 Negro men and
women were arrested in Nash
ville, Tenn., after refusing to
leave a bus station lunch counter
in the face of a bomb threat.
Alabama Students Out
The Alabama Board of Educa
tion ordered nine students ex
pelled from Alabama State Col
lege at Montgomery and 20 others
placed on probation for taking
part in recent antisegregation
demonstrations. The expulsion
order is effective tomorrow.
Gov. John Patterson told the
board the action was necessary
"to prevent bloodshed in this city.
If we ever bow to the threat of a
mob. we are on our way (jut and
they'll get more arrogant every
day." He said continued demon
strations could lead ultimately to
"riot, injury and possible death."
An estimated 1.000 Alabama
State Negro students voted
last night to stay away from
classes until the nine are rein
stated.
Students chanted, "Can't go
Alabam, we go Auburn." This
was considered a threat to seek
enrollment at one of the state's
two white universities.
