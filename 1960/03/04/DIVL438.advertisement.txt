TORT
Pride of the law school,
Blackstone has never lost a R
moot trial. But there's noth- I
ing moot about his prefer- I
ences in dress. lie finds that
when he's comfortable, he I
can trap a witness and sway I
a jury like Clarence Darrow.
So he always wears Jockey
brand briefs while preparing
his briefs. Exclusive Jockey
tailoring gives him a bonus I
of comfort he gets in no other I
underwear. Fine Jockey I
combed cotton is more ab
sorbent, smoother fitting, too.
To look your best, feel your
best, take a tip from Tort. S
Always insist on Jockey m
brand briefs, $1.25. Your f|
campus store has them now! &
