# WIND-TUNNEL
## 'Hot-Shot' Unveiled For Press 
### Barry Greenberg 
Stanford's arc - discharge wind
tunnel, also known as the "hot
shot-tunnel," was' unveiled before
the press Tuesday by Professor
Walter G. Vincenti of the Aero
nautical Engineering Department,
one of the principle designers of
the tunnel.
"Hot shot" generates hyperson
ic airstreams up to 12.000 m.p.h.,
and temperatures of 24.000 de
grees Farenheit or better. This is
about 1.600 degrees hotter than
the surface of the sun.
Good Imitation
This high temperature com
bined with the hypersonic air
stream makes the wind tunnel a
good imitation of the rugged con
ditions a space vehicle faces upon
re-entering the earth's atmos
phere.
This explains the tunnel's pur
pose, as well. Inside its test sec
tion, the behavior of materials
and aerodynamic models can be
checked and studied by research
ers of the Aeronautical Engineer
ing Department. The results can
be applied to the design of better
missiles, rockets, and similar de
vices.
Pressure Jump
The electric discharge takes
place in an "arc chamber" packed
with air under pressure. The hot
arc jumps the pressure up to 20,-
000 pounds per square inch,
causing the air to burst through
a nylon diaphragm and into a
cone-shaped' "nozzle" extending
into the tunnel's vacuum cham
ber.
Models and mate r i a 1 s are
mounted for testing at the mouth
of this nozzle, where the air
si ream reaches top speed. The in
vestigators can watch the fire
works through a heavy glass
window in the test section, but
they depend mostly on a large
array of instruments to tell them
what has happened.
