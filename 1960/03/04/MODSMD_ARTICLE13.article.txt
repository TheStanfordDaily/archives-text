# 'Cluster' Building Should Start Soon
## 
### Doug Willis 
Construction of Stanford's first fraternity cluster is scheduled to begin this summer, Dean of
Men William Craig told a freshman audience in Wilbur Hall last night.
Craig said that the Phi Delta Theta, Kappa Sigma, Theta Delta Chi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity houses will definitely move into the first cluster, scheduled for competion in time for
fall 1961.
The first cluster will be located directly behind Florence Moore Mall on the corner of Mayfield and

! Lomita Drive. The 8-acre site is
i adjacent to the Knoll.
A central kitchen will oper
ate in conjunction with smaller
kitchens in each fraternity wing.
I"hc central kitchen will do all
heavy cooking. Breakfast and
| lunch will be served from the
fraternity kitchens.
The tentative design for the
I first cluster calls for separate in
lorior and exterior designs for
: each house. Craig said that the
houses will be of residential de-
I sign, probably of frame construc
tion wilh shake roofs.
$337,000 Houses
Each of the four fraternities
in the first cluster will contribute
$120,000 toward the construction
i costs of the new building. The
University will cover the balance
on each of the $337,000 houses
from HHFA funds.
Craig said that the present time
schedule calls for construction of
a second cluster located next to
the first unit to begin al approxi
mately the same time as the first
unit. He said that the four houses
to occupy the second cluster
would probably be selected from
a list consisting of the Kappa
Alpha. Zela Psi, Alpha Delta Phi.
Alpha Kappa Lambda and Alpha
Sigma Phi houses.
Eventually, Craig explained, six
clusters will be constructed to
house Stanford's 24 fraternities.
1 They will form a ring extending
from Lake Lagunita to the area
behind Wilbur Hall.
House Features Told
Craig said that each fraternity
| wing in the new cluster will con
i tain a study room and library, a
1,000 square foot social area to
j be designed and arranged by the
; individual fraternity and two
i man, two-room sleeping areas in
stead of sleeping porches. Each
house will also have two four
i man suites.
Each fraternity will have a
separate volleyball-basketball
court and a large recreation field.
A faculty resident's house will be
located near, but separate from.

$337,000 Houses
Each of the four fraternities
in the first cluster will contribute
$120,000 toward the construction
i costs of the new building. The
University will cover the balance
on each of the $337,000 houses
from HHFA funds.
Craig said that the present time
schedule calls for construction of
a second cluster located next to
the first unit to begin al approxi
mately the same time as the first
unit. He said that the four houses
to occupy the second cluster
would probably be selected from
a list consisting of the Kappa
Alpha. Zela Psi, Alpha Delta Phi.
Alpha Kappa Lambda and Alpha
Sigma Phi houses.
Eventually, Craig explained, six
clusters will be constructed to
house Stanford's 24 fraternities.
1 They will form a ring extending
from Lake Lagunita to the area
behind Wilbur Hall.
House Features Told
Craig said that each fraternity
| wing in the new cluster will con
i tain a study room and library, a
1,000 square foot social area to
j be designed and arranged by the
; individual fraternity and two
i man, two-room sleeping areas in
stead of sleeping porches. Each
house will also have two four
i man suites.
Each fraternity will have a
separate volleyball-basketball
court and a large recreation field.
A faculty resident's house will be
located near, but separate from.
! each fraternity wing.
Construction of Stanford's first fraternity cluster is scheduled to begin this summer, Dean of
Men William Craig told a freshman audience in Wilbur Hall last night.
Craig said that the Phi Delta Theta, Kappa Sigma, Theta Delta Chi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity houses will definitely move into the first cluster, scheduled for competion in time for
fall 1961.
The first cluster will be located directly behind Florence Moore Mall on the corner of Mayfield and

! Lomita Drive. The 8-acre site is
i adjacent to the Knoll.
A central kitchen will oper
ate in conjunction with smaller
kitchens in each fraternity wing.
I"hc central kitchen will do all
heavy cooking. Breakfast and

fraternity kitchens.
The tentative design for the
I first cluster calls for separate in
