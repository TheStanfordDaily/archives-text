# Sequoia Fine, Varied Issue
## 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
The second Sequoia of the year
(60 pages. 50 cents) is a fine
issue, varied in copy content and
full of wonderful art and photog
raphy.
The magazine, which goes on
sale today, has as its outstanding
piece an editor's note by Frances
Monson on. the Humanities Hon
ors Program. It is a fine critical
article on a subject that has long
needed some constructive
thought.
LSD Interview
An interview with Jeffrey
Smith, associate professor of phil
osophy. on LSD 25 makes quite
a fascinating though unintention
ally funny article.
The seven pieces of photogra
phy in the center of the issue
are perhaps its most striking
feature, and the three poems, two
by Wendell Berry and one by N.
Scott Momaday, are all quite
good.
"A Final Word on Stuttgart"
by David Cat heart and Susan
Koessler, the reply to Betty Kan
tor's article in the last issue of
the Sequoia, is very disappoint
ing. It does not add much to what
has already been said on the sub
ject. and it seems to be an overly
violent reaction to a valid second
look.
Fiction
The fiction, three stories and
a sketch, is good, though not ex
tremely impressive. Gwen Davis'
"The Early Risers" is kind of a
bitter, funny piece; "An Old-
Country House" by Arvin Brown
is a humorous story of a Jewish
grandmother, and the third. "De
cember Anniversary" by Fanny
Howe, doesn't quite work as a
story, although it could have been
very exciting.
The sketch, by Tim Welsh, is
delightful.
The layout of the book is, as
always, very well done, and the
art is excellent. However, there
is .something annoying about a
cover that must be fully open to
be seen.
