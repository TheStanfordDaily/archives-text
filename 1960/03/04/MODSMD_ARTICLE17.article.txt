In 111Â«' light of 11K' current interest regarding Stanford's aca
demic structure, the editorial in this quarter's "Sequoia* is par
licularh appropriate. Concerning itself with the Humanities Hon
ors Program at Stanford, the editorial questions the value of any
program whose purposes are so vaguely conceived. 11 points out
some of the specific weaknesses of the program and is well worth
the consideration of those interested in honors work in the Hu
manities.
It is indicative, however, of the general inadequacy of student
information about the opportunities offered bv Stanford's honor
programs.
\\ lien the interdepartmental Humanities Honors Program was
originallv conceived there existed Imt several departmental hon
ors programs within the School of Humanities and Sciences. How
ever. in the past four vears honors programs have been instituted
in eight more departments and bv next September will encom
pass fourteen departments.
Thus, the departmental honors program which "Sequoia" pro
poses as "the most sensible approach to the problem of strength
ening the Humanities" is already well under \va\ and gathering
increasing momentum.
The Humanities Honors Program is not nicrek the "(look's
Tour of the Liberal Arts'* as "Sequoia" defines it. Most of the
students within the program are required to complete the major
requirements of a humanities department. The intentions of the
Program are to develop a sense of interrelatedness among the
disciplines in addition to a concentration within one field.
The expanding departmental honors program is becoming
more and more able to fulfill the needs of students desiring con
centration within a narrow humanities field. Hut tlx* Humanities
Honors Program, although admittcdK weak in some specific
aspects, remains of value to students wishing to relate their spe
cial field to wider areas of knowledge and experience. Such a
relationship can be sought academical!) at an undergraduate
level.
