## Civil Rights Issue 
### Dick White Contributing Editor 
Congress is now debating the
most important domestic prob
lem— civil lights in the form
of a bill aimed to give full voting
rights to all citizens. This dis
cussion seems likely to continue
for some time, not in attempt to
decide on the merits of this bill
nor to convince the uncommitted,
but rather as a last effort of the
conservatives to block federal
protection of human rights.
Periodically the question of civil
rights comes before the Congress,
but previously it has usually been
successfully by p a s s e d for the
more pressing issue of our for
eign policy. It has become in
creasingly obvious, however, to
a ny on e above the educational
level of a frog that the success
of our foreign policy depends
largely on the state of our own
internal affairs.
Suppression
Our enemies are quick to point
to the fact that although we often
support the rights of colonial
people abroad and offer small
amounts of economic air! to these
newly formed, uncommitted na
tions, our internal policy is one
of suppression for our own large
Negro minority. It does little good
to point to the obvious weakness
es of the .Russian system if we
have nothing bolter to show in
terms of equal opportunity and
rights for our own citizens.
The propaganda that can be
made from the South's segrega
tion is most effective in the coun
tries of Southeast Asia and Afri

| ea, those which we are most earn
estly trying to convince of the
merits of democracy, in face of
Ihe rising tide of totalitarianism.
Soul hern conservatives are
quick to call anyone abroad who
a Hacks our U.S. segregation
either a Communist or a fellow
traveler. And yet we are now
finding ourselves isolated further
and further from the democratic
forces of the world.
Russian Promises
These areas are being won by
Russian promises of aid which
come from a land of equal oppor
tunity. ,We are being constantly
pushed into the same corner as
Franco's Spain, the Un ion of
i South Africa, Formosa, and South
Korea. People are beginning to
associate the U.S. with these forc
es of world politics.
However, this situation is un
fortunate and untrue. The Ameri
can people do not have the grave
prejudices attributed to them.
Only a small vocal minority rep
resents this extreme.
< onservatives
The issue now stands before
| Congress, as the conservatives
desperately try to fillibuster the
1 bill to death. However the ques
tion was raised early, and round
i t he-clock sessions should soon
have their effect on the partici
pants. Sheer attrition will have
to wear them down.
We can thus hope that in this
extremely important area •some
wo r th w hi 1 e decision will be
reached offering adequate protec
tion to the Negro in exercising
his right to vote.

but previously it has usually been
successfully by p a s s e d for the
more pressing issue of our for

creasingly obvious, however, to
a ny on e above the educational
level of a frog that the success
of our foreign policy depends
largely on the state of our own
internal affairs.
Suppression
Our enemies are quick to point
to the fact that although we often
support the rights of colonial
people abroad and offer small
amounts of economic air! to these
newly formed, uncommitted na
tions, our internal policy is one
of suppression for our own large
Negro minority. It does little good
to point to the obvious weakness
es of the .Russian system if we
have nothing bolter to show in
terms of equal opportunity and
rights for our own citizens.
The propaganda that can be
made from the South's segrega
tion is most effective in the coun
tries of Southeast Asia and Afri

| ea, those which we are most earn
estly trying to convince of the
merits of democracy, in face of
Ihe rising tide of totalitarianism.
Soul hern conservatives are
quick to call anyone abroad who
a Hacks our U.S. segregation
either a Communist or a fellow
traveler. And yet we are now
finding ourselves isolated further
and further from the democratic
forces of the world.
Russian Promises
These areas are being won by
Russian promises of aid which
come from a land of equal oppor
tunity. ,We are being constantly
pushed into the same corner as
Franco's Spain, the Un ion of
i South Africa, Formosa, and South
Korea. People are beginning to
associate the U.S. with these forc
es of world politics.
However, this situation is un
fortunate and untrue. The Ameri
can people do not have the grave
prejudices attributed to them.
Only a small vocal minority rep
resents this extreme.

The issue now stands before
| Congress, as the conservatives
desperately try to fillibuster the
1 bill to death. However the ques
tion was raised early, and round
i t he-clock sessions should soon
have their effect on the partici
pants. Sheer attrition will have
to wear them down.
We can thus hope that in this
extremely important area •some
wo r th w hi 1 e decision will be
reached offering adequate protec
tion to the Negro in exercising
his right to vote.
Congress is now debating the
most important domestic prob
lem— civil lights in the form
of a bill aimed to give full voting
rights to all citizens. This dis
cussion seems likely to continue
for some time, not in attempt to
decide on the merits of this bill
nor to convince the uncommitted,
but rather as a last effort of the
conservatives to block federal
protection of human rights.
