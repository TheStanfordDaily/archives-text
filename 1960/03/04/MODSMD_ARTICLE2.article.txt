## Midterms Discussed 
### Fran Monson 
The hottest item on LASSU's
agenda Thursday night was a dis
cussion of the midterm system at
Stanford.
The controversy originally
arose as a result of the memo
randum sent to ihe faculty of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences by Dean Rhinelander re
cently, in which he advocated the
abolition of compulsory midterms
where possible.
Opinions expressed by the Leg
islature members indicated a
largo split within the student body
itself concerning the issue; where
the constituencies had been
polled, the results were far from
conclusive. Therefore the idea of
running a Daily poll was reject
ed, and Legislature plans to sub
mit a formal letter to Dean Rhine
lander next quarter, after it has
had sufficient time to explore the
problem.
In other action, LASSU ap
proved the T.I.R. Foreign Policy
Institute budget, providing for a
speaker preferably George Ken
nan, William Fulbright or Ches
ter Bowles at the Institute.
