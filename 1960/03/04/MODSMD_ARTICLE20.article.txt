A unique experiment in higher
education was initiated this fall,
and although a fair appraisal will
not be possible for many years,
a cursory examination necessi
tates classifying the experiment
as something less than a smash
ing success.
In September, Michigan State
University at Oakland (Oakland
is a suburb in Michigan), which
the Michigan University newspa
per describes as "a sister, not a
twin of Michigan State Univer
sity,'' opened its gates to 535
freshmen. The goal: to make
MStJ-O one of the nation's great
est institutions of higher learn
ing; to produce 535 "eggheads."
The formulutors of MSU-O
plan to "emphasize learning,
not training; . . . ideas, not
techniques. They are displeased
with the trend in American <*d
ucation toward vocational train
ing with a deemphasis oil hu
manities.
Every student, therefore, must
take at least half his courses in
liberal arts. Everyone is required
to take "stiff, one-year courses in
English literature and rhetoric,
history and development of West
ern civilization, history of phil
osophy and science, and a study
of contempprary non-Western cul
tures, with emphasis on t he Far
East, Africa, and Latin America,"
reports the Michigan Daily.
In addition, every student must
master, not simply study, a for
eign language, preferably Rus
sian. Only French and Russian
were offered'this year but Greek,
Latin and German will be added
next year. A student may substi
tute a sequence of mathematics
beginning with calculus, but they
are urged to take a language, 100.
There are only four fields of
study: liberal arts, engineering
sciences, business administra-
Kmphasis is on depth.
MSU-O is proud of the freedom
which they allow the students.
Roll is not taken and students
are encouraged to do independent
study. Some things have been
eliminated. There are no frater
nities or sororities, there is no
ROTC (compulsory or voluntary),
no intercollegiate athletics and
no required physical education.
The purpose of all these inno
vations is "to clear away much
of the nonintellectual underbrush
which grows on most campuses."
It is to help the student to devote
a maximum of time to studies
without distractions.
Kilt all is not intellectually
idyllic at MSU-O. At the eritl of
the first quarter it was discov
ered that forty-three per cent
of the students taking calculus,
chemistry, and economics had
flunked. There was also a high
mortality rate among the pros
pective eggheads taking politi
cal science and French.
"In most cases the instructors
were probably at fault," one offi
cial proclaimed. "They were de
manding too much, too soon. Per
haps it was a conscious effort to
make it tough.
"Many of the students just
didn't have the proper background
for a tough course in political
science. And many of the stu-

I dents taking math and chemistry
shouldn't have been taking those
I courses at all," the official said.
The Michigan Daily was a
little skeptical about MSU-O:
"Any apparent success of this
program is chillingly absent in
the cold fad that over 10 per
cent of the students failed to
attain passing marks in the
first quarter.
"The students are unrespon
sible and apathetic and in class
display little grasp of the as
i signed readings, and display a
gross naivete about fundamental
I concepts of our society. They are
friendly and cheerful people, but
[don't appear to understand, want,
j or oven need the lype of education
that is tteing offered to them."
Some MSU-O students don't
feel the same way as the Michi
i gan Daily. One student said, "It's
j rough, really rough. But I'm glad
| because it's going to mean some
i thing to he able to say you grad
! uated from here." Many of his
| classmates concur.
