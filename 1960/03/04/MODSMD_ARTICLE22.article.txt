hditor, The Daily:
For the first time in my four
years on the Stanford faculty the
i Daily has begun to strike intellec
tual sparks in the center of this
| nationally great university. Please
j make this your continuing con
tribution a fiery light and even
| a little heat as our individual ice
floes drift into raging seas.
Your regime contrasts splen
didly with the dismal vacuity of
your several predecessors. In the
past four weeks your front page
has become practically the best
on the West Coast, your editorials
are beginning to bite and we are
beginning to read them, and your
I feature articles are brandishing
I iron and not cotton flannel.
Keep it up. Wasn't it Garrison
[who advised the abolitionists to
(demand the whole loaf, for other
wise how else, in the end, would
' they obtain even a half loaf.

Editor, The Daily:
There has been an endless con
troversy going on about whether
or not capital punishment is a
| deterrent. No party seems to be
I quite sure about the statistics
I available to date.
Logically one would suspect
that capital punishment will act
as a deterrent for preplanned first
degree crimes with little effect
on instantaneous, e motional
crime?. The logic of criminals,
however, might not bear this out.
We should study the statistics
on the "effects of capital punish
ment on the preplanned crimes
I separately from those of the in
stantaneous crimes. Capital
1 punishment should be retained
even if it acts as a deterrent only
j for the former crimes; otherwise,
j it has no justification at all.
