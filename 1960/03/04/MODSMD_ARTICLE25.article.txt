EAT, DRINK AND BE MARRIFD
(>n .'i recent tour of seventy million American colleges, T was
struck by two outstanding facts: first, the great number of
students who smoke Marlboro, and second, the great number
of students who are married.
The first phenomenon —the vast multitude of Marlboro
smokers—comes as no surprise for, as everyone knows, the
college student is an enormously intelligent organism, and what
could be more intelligent than to smoke Marlboro? After all,
pleasure is what you smoke for and pleasure is what Marlboro
delivers- pleasure in every puff of that good golden tobacco.
If you think flavor went out when filters came in — try a
Marlboro. Light up and see for yourself... Or, if you like, don't
light up. .lust take a Marlboro, unlighted. and' puff a couple (if
times, (ict that wonderful flavor? You bet you do! Kven with
out lighting you can taste Marlboro's excellent filter blend.
Also you can make your package last practically forever.
\'n, 1 say, it was not the great number of Marlboro smokers
that astounded me, it was the great number of married students.
You may find this hard to believe but latest statistics show that
at some coeducational college's the proportion of married under
graduates runs as high as thirty percent! And, what i> even
more startling, fully one-quarter of these marriages have been
blessed with issue!
Here now is a figure to give you pause! Not that we don't
all love babies. Of course we do! Babies are pink and fetching
rascals, given to winsome noises and droll expressions, and we
all like nothing better than to rain kisses on their soft little
skulls. Hut just the same, to the young campus couple who are
parents for the first time the baby is likely to be a source of
considerable worry. Therefore, lei me devote today's column
to a few helpful hints on the care of babies.

First of Jill, wo will take up the matter of diet. In the past,
babies were raised largely on table scraps. This, however, was
outlawed by the Smoot-I lawlov Act, and today babies are fed
a scientific formula consisting of dextrose, maltose, distilled
water, evaporated milk and a twist of lemon peel.
After eating, the baby tends to grow sleepy. A lullaby is very
useful t<> help it fall asleep. In case you (lon t know any lulla
bies, make one up. This is not at all difficult. In a lullaby the
words are unimportant since the baby doesn t understand them
anyhow. The important thing is the .sound. All you have to do
is string together a bunch of nonsense syllables, taking care
that tliev make an agreeable sound. For example:
(lo lo slap, in,f/ little infant,
(ino-goo moo-moo poo-poo binfant.
Having fed and serenaded the babv, arrange it in the position
fnr slumber. A babv sleeps best on its stomach so place it that
wav in crib. Then to make sure it will not turn itself over
during the night lay a soft but fairly heavy object on its back —
another baby, for instance. e iw mhx Situlman

Ind when haby is fast asleep—the little anyel!—why rlnn'f
you relax anrl give yourself a treat? With Marlboro -or if you
like mildness hut you don't like filters —with rhilip .Vorri*

all like nothing better than to rain kisses on their soft little
skulls. Hut just the same, to the young campus couple who are
parents for the first time the baby is likely to be a source of
considerable worry. Therefore, lei me devote today's column
to a few helpful hints on the care of babies.

First of Jill, wo will take up the matter of diet. In the past,
babies were raised largely on table scraps. This, however, was
outlawed by the Smoot-I lawlov Act, and today babies are fed
a scientific formula consisting of dextrose, maltose, distilled
water, evaporated milk and a twist of lemon peel.
After eating, the baby tends to grow sleepy. A lullaby is very
useful t<> help it fall asleep. In case you (lon t know any lulla
bies, make one up. This is not at all difficult. In a lullaby the
words are unimportant since the baby doesn t understand them
anyhow. The important thing is the .sound. All you have to do
is string together a bunch of nonsense syllables, taking care
that tliev make an agreeable sound. For example:
(lo lo slap, in,f/ little infant,
(ino-goo moo-moo poo-poo binfant.
Having fed and serenaded the babv, arrange it in the position
fnr slumber. A babv sleeps best on its stomach so place it that
wav in crib. Then to make sure it will not turn itself over
during the night lay a soft but fairly heavy object on its back —
another baby, for instance. e iw mhx Situlman

Ind when haby is fast asleep—the little anyel!—why rlnn'f
you relax anrl give yourself a treat? With Marlboro -or if you
like mildness hut you don't like filters —with rhilip .Vorri*
made in tony size and regular by t he sponsors of I his eohitn n.


EAT, DRINK AND BE MARRIFD
(>n .'i recent tour of seventy million American colleges, T was
struck by two outstanding facts: first, the great number of
students who smoke Marlboro, and second, the great number
of students who are married.
The first phenomenon —the vast multitude of Marlboro
smokers—comes as no surprise for, as everyone knows, the
college student is an enormously intelligent organism, and what
could be more intelligent than to smoke Marlboro? After all,
pleasure is what you smoke for and pleasure is what Marlboro
delivers- pleasure in every puff of that good golden tobacco.
If you think flavor went out when filters came in — try a
Marlboro. Light up and see for yourself... Or, if you like, don't
light up. .lust take a Marlboro, unlighted. and' puff a couple (if
times, (ict that wonderful flavor? You bet you do! Kven with
out lighting you can taste Marlboro's excellent filter blend.
Also you can make your package last practically forever.
\'n, 1 say, it was not the great number of Marlboro smokers
that astounded me, it was the great number of married students.
You may find this hard to believe but latest statistics show that
at some coeducational college's the proportion of married under
graduates runs as high as thirty percent! And, what i> even
more startling, fully one-quarter of these marriages have been
blessed with issue!
Here now is a figure to give you pause! Not that we don't
all love babies. Of course we do! Babies are pink and fetching
rascals, given to winsome noises and droll expressions, and we
all like nothing better than to rain kisses on their soft little
skulls. Hut just the same, to the young campus couple who are
