# SEVEN ARTS
## Voice of Intensity 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
The word most critics use to
describe Odetta is electrifying.
Many consider her the greatest
living folk singer.
I'll go along with both these
opinions.
Odetta is a big woman with a
big voice, which is so low that
it could be mistaken for a man's
011 first hearing.
It is deep and resonant, and
it lias a dramatic power that
few singers ever possess.
Odetta uses it in a song to
penetrate to the core of emo
tion in both song and listener,
accompanying herself on a gui
tar that is fine, exciting and
effective.
Hearing her on records is a
wonderful experience, but it can
not be compared with actually
seeing her perform. She has a
marvelous presence on the stage,
a kind of intimate glow of pleas
ure in what she is doing and hu
mility in her audience's reaction
to her.
The emot ion of her songs comes
out strongly in her voice and in
her face. One can feel the inten
sity with which she sings a song
and creates a mood: it magne
tizes the air. Her simplicity and
the direct warmth of her voice
are gripping.
She sings a prison song with
out the guitar, without a bass.
There is .just the voice, sad and
strong, and the stark, classic
line of the rhythm of the work,
pimctuah d with silence broken
only by her own hand clasps.
The gospel songs, the spirituals
that Odetta sings have the re
strained fervor of Marion Ander
son and a loveliness that Odetta
herself has injected. It comes out
in a kind of overwhelming mo
ment um.
Storytelling is another of her
special arts. Her "Fox" is incom
parable in its humor and expres
sion.
Odetta. did not enter the folk
field until comparatively late in
her life (although now she is
probably not yet 30 >. She was
born in Birmingham, Ala., but
she moved to Los Angeles when
she was six.
Slw studied classical music,
and she says that in those davs

she had a snobbishness that
could only he equaled by an
other 1(5- or 17-year-old: "It it
wasn't art son# or (Herman Lie
dcr 3 was content to leave it
alone."
She got her first job in the hit
musical "Finian's Rainbow," and
toured San Francisco. In the City
she met a group of folk singers
and was impressed by the sincer
ity and beauty of the songs they
sang. Odetta says she was "fasci
nated by the freedom folk songs
allowed a singer.'' She proceeded
to teach herself to play (he guitar
and soon was singing regularly
at the Tin Angel.
While appearing there, she at
tracted the attention of numerous
artists, including Harry Belafonte,
with whom she recently appeared
| in a television spectacular.
Later she moved to the Hun
gry i, then to the Gate of Horn
in < hicago which was inspira
tion for an album. The name
Gate of Horn comes from the
legend that there are two gates
of dreams, one of ivory and one
of horn. Dreams which delude
pass through the ivory gate.
Those which pass through the
gate of horn come true.
Odetta has neon compared to
Bessie Smith. Huddie Leadbetter
and Mahalia Jackson, but she is
none of these her quality is
unique. It is a warm, rich, stir
ring dignity that she has, and it
is unlike any style that belongs
I to anyone else.
