# Chappie Garbage
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingle 
No doubt you are all surprised,
though pleasantly so, to see my
lit lie column appearing a! such
a time. The reason is that our
off-color humor magazine, the
Chaparral, is publishing nc x I
week, commonly known as dead
week. 1 guess their motto is "Put
some life in dead week," and I
wish I could report that they had
succeeded.
Of course, no Chappies have
been printed yet. This posed some
difficulties for the reviewer. So,
one dark night this week, after
the official full moons had waned,
1 stealthily approached the ter
mite-ridden office of the Chapar
ral from the rear. P laying a
hunch, I peeked into their gar
bage can, and lo and behold! I
saw all their galley proofs for
the next issue. It seems Santa
Clara County is rather strict on
the storage of trash. So, by dim
light of the moon, I read the next
Chappie and here is what 1 found:
Garbage Galore
The cover is a picture of a
garbage can lined with copies of
that p op u 1 a r publication, The
Stanford Daily. Picture it: A
Daily man in a Chappie garbage
can, looking at a picture of a
Daily-lined garbage can. Appar
ently they regard this as a cruel
thrust, not seeing the other side
of the coin. There are tlio.se pub
lications which are good for lining
garbage cans, and there are those
which are good for throwing in
garbage cans.
Pushing Rushing
As the time of year when fresh
men rush is almost at hand, the
Chappie has generously furnished
a rushing manual that should be
of invaluable assistance to no
body, I hope. They have poorly
spoofed the jock fraternity, the
party fraternity, and the Wall
Street fraternity. Then to be im
partial and fair, they try to treat
an eating club. Los Turkos (thinly
veiled, no?> in the same way.

For the readers who are left
after this, that is, girls and inde
pendents, the next feature in the
magazine is the Chappie concep
tion of a super, gigantic, colossal,
stupendous, ultra-bad flick. "John
ny Omnibus" is the title of this
cinematic epic, based on a story
by F. Dostoevsky, with music by
the king of jazz, Walt Whiteman.
(Jet the picture? However, a
couple of lines are funny. And
with all the large-scale "histori
cal" (any resemblance to what
you learn in Civ is purely coin
cidental) movies playing in the
City now, the satire may be pretty
timely.
At another point in the maga
zine you read a word-for-word
script of a disc jockey's blarney
on a typical radio station: "KBUL
More music, less yak." Sur-r-re
it is. Maybe the Chaparral could
take up a similar slogan, "More
humor, less drivel" or some such.
Mass Media
Radio, movies, newspapers
there is pattern here. As a mat
ter of fact, the? theme of the issue
is Mass Media. They have a Mass
Media Queen even. Just what the
masses ordered, Mr. Marx.
There are several other inane
articles which 1 couldn't find. Per
haps the garbage collector picked
them up by mistake. They are
all supposed to relate to mass
media, though. And that is an
other issue of the Chaparral, No.
1 in the crass media field.

though pleasantly so, to see my
lit lie column appearing a! such
a time. The reason is that our
off-color humor magazine, the
Chaparral, is publishing nc x I
week, commonly known as dead
week. 1 guess their motto is "Put
some life in dead week," and I
wish I could report that they had
succeeded.
Of course, no Chappies have
been printed yet. This posed some
difficulties for the reviewer. So,
one dark night this week, after
the official full moons had waned,
1 stealthily approached the ter
mite-ridden office of the Chapar
ral from the rear. P laying a
hunch, I peeked into their gar
bage can, and lo and behold! I
saw all their galley proofs for
the next issue. It seems Santa
Clara County is rather strict on
the storage of trash. So, by dim
light of the moon, I read the next
Chappie and here is what 1 found:
Garbage Galore
The cover is a picture of a
garbage can lined with copies of
that p op u 1 a r publication, The
Stanford Daily. Picture it: A
Daily man in a Chappie garbage
can, looking at a picture of a
Daily-lined garbage can. Appar
ently they regard this as a cruel
thrust, not seeing the other side
of the coin. There are tlio.se pub
lications which are good for lining
garbage cans, and there are those
which are good for throwing in
garbage cans.
Pushing Rushing
As the time of year when fresh
men rush is almost at hand, the
Chappie has generously furnished
a rushing manual that should be
of invaluable assistance to no
body, I hope. They have poorly
spoofed the jock fraternity, the
party fraternity, and the Wall
Street fraternity. Then to be im
partial and fair, they try to treat
an eating club. Los Turkos (thinly
veiled, no?> in the same way.

For the readers who are left
after this, that is, girls and inde
pendents, the next feature in the
magazine is the Chappie concep
tion of a super, gigantic, colossal,
stupendous, ultra-bad flick. "John
ny Omnibus" is the title of this
cinematic epic, based on a story
by F. Dostoevsky, with music by
the king of jazz, Walt Whiteman.
(Jet the picture? However, a
couple of lines are funny. And
with all the large-scale "histori
cal" (any resemblance to what
you learn in Civ is purely coin
cidental) movies playing in the
City now, the satire may be pretty
timely.
At another point in the maga
zine you read a word-for-word
script of a disc jockey's blarney
on a typical radio station: "KBUL
More music, less yak." Sur-r-re
it is. Maybe the Chaparral could
take up a similar slogan, "More
humor, less drivel" or some such.
Mass Media
Radio, movies, newspapers
there is pattern here. As a mat
ter of fact, the? theme of the issue
is Mass Media. They have a Mass
Media Queen even. Just what the
masses ordered, Mr. Marx.
There are several other inane
articles which 1 couldn't find. Per
haps the garbage collector picked
them up by mistake. They are
all supposed to relate to mass
media, though. And that is an
other issue of the Chaparral, No.
1 in the crass media field.
