# LAST GAMES
## Card Five Set to Face California 
### Ken Dery 
Seniors John Arrillaga, Neal
Broekmeyer, and Johnny Stabler
will he playing their last basket
ball games for Stanford this week
end when the Indians take on
national champion California in
a home-and-home series.
Saturday's tilt will be the last
seen in the Pavilion this season
and should certainly prove an ex
citing contest as Stanford will
be going all out in an effort to
pull off the upset of the year.
Captain John Arrillaga, the
leading scorer since the opening
game back in December closes
out his fine career with a niche
in the Card hall-of-fame. ffe is
the tenth all-time scorer. John's
inspirational comeback after a
severely sprained ankle shows
his attitude and the skill that
have been a treat to watch.
Neal Broekmeyer, a regular
Iloratio Alger story in the center
slot, should be very proud for
the season he has turned in. The
6'B" stringbean came all the way
from reserve status to the darling
of the fans and his rebounding
has not gone unappreciated.
Jerry Thuesen and John Stabler
represent two very different
cases.
Thuesen was a starting forward
when a knee ailment forced him
to the sidelines.
Stabler has seen limited action
as a sparkplug guard, usually
sent in to get the ball against an
opponent's freeze.
Holding up their portion in the
ordeals to come will, of course,
be guard Bui) Bowling and for-
wards John Windsor and John
Hendry.
Bowling, a junior, has devloped
into one of the top ball handlers
at Stanford in many years. He
has excellent ball control but is
not consistant in his shooting.
Hendry, also a junior, is the
team's top defensive player and
gets hot from the floor at time-s.
Switching from renter early in
the season, Windsor has de
veloped into a fine corner man.
He lias excellent touch and moves
well for a big man.
Tonight's clash at Berkeley
sees the Bears meeting their arch
rivals with their finest seasonal
record of all lime 22-1.
Led by (J' 10" All-America cen
ter Darrell Imhoff, Cal employs
a strangling defense to an effec
tive degree. Possibly the finest
defensive center in college basket
ball today, Imhoff's clutch tip
gave the Bears a one-point victory
in last year's national champion
ship game.
Mc("lintock Helps
Hugged forward Bill McOlin
tock at G'4", 215 pounds gives
Imhoff anj help lie needs at con
trolling lite backboards. These
two boys give a good indication
why Cal is always near the best
in team defense. Cincinnatti's
Oscar Robertson was stifled by
ihe Bear defense last year.
Tandy Gillis holds down the
other forward slot. At 6'6" his
jumper is tough to stop and he
is well respected around the
league.
There are three guards who
keep the offense in high gear and
set up the 1 plays Jerry Mann.
Bobby Wendell and Earl Shu It /.
Schultx Hits
Shultz is the nest known as he
has had some phenomenal shoot
ing nights, many sparking his
team to rout an opponent. Flay
ing guard at 6'4", Earl can really
handle himself when it counts.
Cal. currently atop the AAWU
standings with a 0-1 record, holds
two victories over Stanford this
year.

Seniors John Arrillaga, Neal
Broekmeyer, and Johnny Stabler
will he playing their last basket
ball games for Stanford this week
end when the Indians take on
national champion California in
a home-and-home series.
Saturday's tilt will be the last
seen in the Pavilion this season
and should certainly prove an ex
citing contest as Stanford will
be going all out in an effort to
pull off the upset of the year.
Captain John Arrillaga, the
leading scorer since the opening
game back in December closes
out his fine career with a niche
in the Card hall-of-fame. ffe is
the tenth all-time scorer. John's
inspirational comeback after a
severely sprained ankle shows
his attitude and the skill that
have been a treat to watch.
Neal Broekmeyer, a regular
Iloratio Alger story in the center
slot, should be very proud for
the season he has turned in. The
6'B" stringbean came all the way
from reserve status to the darling
of the fans and his rebounding
has not gone unappreciated.
Jerry Thuesen and John Stabler
represent two very different
cases.
Thuesen was a starting forward
when a knee ailment forced him
to the sidelines.
Stabler has seen limited action
as a sparkplug guard, usually
sent in to get the ball against an
opponent's freeze.
Holding up their portion in the
ordeals to come will, of course,
be guard Bui) Bowling and for-
wards John Windsor and John
Hendry.
Bowling, a junior, has devloped
into one of the top ball handlers
at Stanford in many years. He
has excellent ball control but is
not consistant in his shooting.
Hendry, also a junior, is the
team's top defensive player and
gets hot from the floor at time-s.
Switching from renter early in
the season, Windsor has de
veloped into a fine corner man.
He lias excellent touch and moves
well for a big man.
Tonight's clash at Berkeley
sees the Bears meeting their arch
rivals with their finest seasonal
record of all lime 22-1.
Led by (J' 10" All-America cen
ter Darrell Imhoff, Cal employs
a strangling defense to an effec
tive degree. Possibly the finest
defensive center in college basket
ball today, Imhoff's clutch tip
gave the Bears a one-point victory
in last year's national champion
ship game.
Mc("lintock Helps
Hugged forward Bill McOlin
