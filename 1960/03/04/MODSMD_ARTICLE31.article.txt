# A 						Phi O Hide Box Set Up in Library
## 
### 
Alpha Phi Omega will place its
ride-swapping box in the lobby
of the Main library starting to
day. It will remain out through
out the rest of the quarter.
Students desiring rides home
for spring vacation can put their
names in the box for the state
in which they live. Students with
car's who want to give rides can
then contact prospective riders.
The rides box is a regular proj
ect of A-Phi-O, service fraternity.
For the first three days of next
quarter, the group will help stu
dents sell their used books
in temporary building A-30. Stu
dents bring their books, set the
prices they want for them, and
A-Phi O will try to sell them for
a nominal ten-cent hand 1 in g
charge per book. Checks and un
sold books will be returned about
three weeks later.
Fraternity officers elected for
the second half of the year are:
President, Tom Stoebe; first
vice president, Dave Argetsinger;
second vice president, John Castel
lan; recording secretary, John
Chiorini; corresponding secretary,
Ed Spaeth; treasurer, Dick Wei
nig; historian, Jim Bowman; and
