Ma(it'c Switched
A surprise change in the line

27 when they take on the IJCLA
Bruins. The Indians have six
practice games remaining before

Coach Fehring, with one eye on
his own club and the other keep
ing track of the other CIBA
teams, rates the always - strong
lISC Trojans as the top threat
in the loop.
C'al Strong
lie also considers Cal a strong
cntender for the title. Santa Clara
will be loaded with veterans and
UCLA should be improved with
almost their entire lineup rektrn
ing.
While Fehring refuses to rate
his club among the others, the
picture looks rather rosy for the
Indians.
One of the team's worries was
pitching where they certainly had
enough candidates but didn't
