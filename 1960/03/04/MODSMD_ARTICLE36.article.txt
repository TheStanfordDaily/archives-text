# Frosh Set For Cubs
## 
### 
The Stanford freshman basket
ball team faces a stern test this
weekend when it takes on the
highly rated California frosh to
night and tomorrow night.
Stanford defeated California
earlier in the season, but Cal has
improved since then, and has
beat en previously undefeated
Santa Clara, which took the meas
ure of Stanford on January 15.
Stanford's season record is now
10-4.
Against Cal, Stanford will open
with Roger Head at center, Dar
rell Sutherland and either Bob
Sommers or Chuck Wilson at for
wards, and Doug and Don Clem
enson at guards.
Head was sick and could not
play in the first Cal game. His
6-5 height was missed.
Sommers, leading Stanford
scorer until he suffered a back
injury, is back in shape after a
layoff due to his injury.
