Toil ay "a article on the Hoover I nstitnt ion raises important
issues which must be examined h\ all the members o( the Stan
lord community.
The Hoover Institution has been I In* spiritual ami material
child of Herbert Hoover. Along with his work on the Belgian
Helief Fund, the Hoover Institution is a lasting tribute to Mr.
Hoover's broad ami creative eontrihutions to hurope as well as
this count rv.
I lie value of the Hoover Institution with its tremendous col
lection of documents can he appreciated onlv when one realizes
th* â€¢ w 1.0 l esale destruction o( historical documents during the
first and second world wars.
I'laced in the unique position of possessing the only extant
copies of thousands of international documents, the Hoover Insti
tution hears the heavv responsihilitv of preserving these docu
ments for the purposes of international scholarship.
Such a responsihilitv requires of the Institution's adminis
tration hoth an active ami a passive role. The Hoover Institution
must he releutlesslv active in the acquisition of all documents
which are pertinent to its collections.
However, passivity is also inherent in anv institution which
assumes the responsihilitv of an international repository. The
Hoover Institution has no right to predetermine the goals of
scholarship. It can have no other '"purpose" or "goal* than to
facilitate the qualified scholar in his search for the documents
neeessarv for him to formulate his own opinion.
Such has alvvavs heen the "goal of anv honest academic insti
tution. Such mIII have heen the basis for Mr. Hoover's far-sighted
work in collecting documents after World War I.
l or this reason we are surprised and sincerely regret I\lr.
Hoover"- recent statement tving the goals of the Hoover Institu
tion to the "purposes of the American people," ami the exposure
of "the e\ il> of the doctrines of Karl Marx whether (!o mini in ism.
Socialism, economic materialism, or atheism," a statement which
flagranllv violates all the principles of scholarlv investigation
arid academic freedom.
