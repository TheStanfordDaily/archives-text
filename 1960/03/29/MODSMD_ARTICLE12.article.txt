# Interview with New Hoover Director Shows Revised Goals of Institution
## 
### Craig Murray 
Many students attend Stanford
without becoming acquainted with
the Hoover Institution its col
lections and its significance for
Stanford.
Th[s article was undertaken
with the idea of providing some
information to breach this gap.
Modest research has suggested
that recent changes have occurred
in the goals of the Institution
which demand the attention of all
members of Stanford.
The history of the Institution
is an interesting story. President
Hoover began collecting docu
ments while conducting the Bel
gian Relief Program during World
War 1 in an attempt to provide a
thorough collection of records for
the understanding of the causes
and course of the war. Hoover
had many agents helping him; it
is said that when the Bela Kun
regime in Hungary collapsed in
1919. a truck backed up to the
government documents office.
Shortly thereafter, nearly com
plete records of the first Hun
garian Communist government
turned up at Stanford University,
ttolslievik Documents
In gratitude for Hoover's fam
ine relief program, the Soviet
Union (and many Russian schol
ars) contributed a mass of valu
able documents on the fall of the
Czarist and Provisional govern
ments and the ascension of the
Bolsheviks,
Toward the end of the 20's. the
records of World War 1 and its
aftermath were fairly complete
and collecting fell riff. But the rise
of Hitler led to the decision to ex
pand I he collect ion into a 20th
century library.
As the Main Library could not
process and house all the ma
terials. many wealthy individuals
contributed to Hoover's fund to
establish a separate building
which was dedicated on June 20,
1911, as the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution, and Peace. By
1919, Hoover Library had 25 mil
lion items including a newspaper
collection of over 3.000 titles and
the most complete 20th century
collection of primary materials on
World War I. Germany, Russia
and Japan.
Middle East Collection
Through the efforts of Profes
sors Mary and Arthur Wright,
Hoover Library acquired an un
equalled documentary record of
the rise of the Communists in
China. In recent years, it has ob
tained an exceptional Middle East
collection. Each collection Slavic,
Western European, Chinese (in
cluding Taiwan). Japanese, Middle
Eastern and African is under
the auspices of a curator.
Today the Library employs a
staff of nearly 50 people compe
tent in 35 languages to process
and catalogue thousands of per
iodicals as well as books and docu
ments. These materials are pro

| cured by purchases from hook
films in America and abroad,
through exchange relations with
libraries throughout the world
and with the assistance of many
(individuals acting as representa
tives in foreign countries.
In an attempt to find what the
; future of the Library and its
relationship with Stanford would
be, I interviewed the newly ap
pointed director, Dr. Westley G.
Campbell. He said that the change
of name of the Library to the
Hoover Institution reflected its
transformation to a center for a
dynamic research program as
well as a library. Campbell in
dicated a determination to build
up Hoover's reputation as an in
stitution for research and publica
tion. The research would portray
the growth and spread of Com
munism; the publications would
be designed to give aid to gov
ernment policy formation.
Campbell read from Hoover's
official statement of policy: "The
over-all mission of this Institution
lis, from its records, to recall the
voice of experience against the
making of war, and by the study
of these records and their publica
tion to recall man's endeavors to
make and preserve peace and to
sustain for America the safe
guards of the American way of
I life.
Not :» Mere Library
"This Institution is not. and
must not be, a mere library. But
I with these purposes as its goal,
the Institution itself must con
stantly and dynamically point the
road to peace, to personal free
dom. and to the safeguards of
the American system."
We discussed the paragraph
preceding this quote which reads:
"The purpose of this Institution
must be. by its research and pub
lications. to demonstrate the evils
of the doctrines of Karl Marx
whether Communism, Socialism,
economic materialism, or atheism
thus to protect the American
way of life from such ideologies,
their conspiracies, and to reaffirm
the validity of the American sys
tem."
Family Alarm
Campbell said he was aware
that some faculty members had
become alarmed at the passage.
He affirmed, "I see nothing
wrong with it. do you?" He re
plied to suggestions that such a
policy might violate scholarly pro
cedures and result in a predeter
mined orientation of publications
by staling that, "There are evils
in Marxism, and I hope we expose
them."
The document from w hi c h
Campbell read states that the
Board of Trustees resolution of
May 21, 1959, incorporated Hoov
er's policy statement. Paragraph
3 of the resolution states: "That
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace is an in
dependent Institution within the
frame of Stanford University. Its

relation to the University is that
the President of the University
will propose all appointments,
promotions, and the budget of the
Institution directly to the Board
of Trustees. There will be no ref
erence to any faculty committees
between the President and the
Trustees.
In response to a question about
the relationship between the In
stitution and the faculty. Camp
bell indicated that he hopes to
maintain pleasant relations with
the faculty, that they were free to
use the facilities of Hoover as a
library, hut made it clear that he
was responsible for drawing up
and executing the research pro
gram.
In Cleveland Plain Dealer
Campbell produced an article
written by an acquaintance of
Hoover in the December 5, 1959
issue of the Cleveland Plain Deal
er. The author noted the new re
search and publication program
and stated that the purpose of the
Institution was to sustain the
ideals and institutions cherished
in the United States including its
form of constitutional govern
ment and principles of economic
freedom.
The publication of this article
.strongly suggested that the new
goals of the Hoover Institution
were being broadcast elsewhere
rather more heartily than on the
Stanford campus. When ques
tioned. Campbell said that Hoov
er had been using his statement of
purpose to solicit funds in his
recent money raising campaign in
the East but pointed out that most
of the money did not come from
Hoover's friends but from founda
tions such as the Fleishmann
Foundation.
When asked if the Institution
was still getting money from the
Ford Foundation, Campbell said
no. But he expressed confidence
that money would not be scarce
when the research and publication
program got going.
The resolution further states in
paragraph 7, "The Director of the
Institution shall be recommended
to the Board of Trustees by the
President of the University for
appointment by the Trustees. He
shall have been previously ap
proved by Mr. Hoover. Such rec
ommendations of the President
shall not require approval of the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council of Stanford University."
The resolution also provides
that Stanford University shall
give not less than $125,000 a year
to Hoover Institution. This
amounts to 40 per cent of the In
stitution's annual budget, and
another 25 per cent is provided by
the Institution's endowment. The
remainder is obtained from gifts
and grants.

of Hitler led to the decision to ex
pand I he collect ion into a 20th
century library.
As the Main Library could not
process and house all the ma
terials. many wealthy individuals
contributed to Hoover's fund to
establish a separate building
which was dedicated on June 20,
1911, as the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution, and Peace. By
1919, Hoover Library had 25 mil
lion items including a newspaper
collection of over 3.000 titles and
the most complete 20th century
collection of primary materials on
World War I. Germany, Russia
and Japan.
Middle East Collection
Through the efforts of Profes
sors Mary and Arthur Wright,
Hoover Library acquired an un
equalled documentary record of
the rise of the Communists in
China. In recent years, it has ob
tained an exceptional Middle East
collection. Each collection Slavic,
Western European, Chinese (in
cluding Taiwan). Japanese, Middle
Eastern and African is under
the auspices of a curator.
Today the Library employs a
staff of nearly 50 people compe
tent in 35 languages to process
and catalogue thousands of per
iodicals as well as books and docu
ments. These materials are pro

| cured by purchases from hook
films in America and abroad,
through exchange relations with
libraries throughout the world
and with the assistance of many
(individuals acting as representa
tives in foreign countries.
In an attempt to find what the
; future of the Library and its
relationship with Stanford would
be, I interviewed the newly ap
pointed director, Dr. Westley G.
Campbell. He said that the change
of name of the Library to the
Hoover Institution reflected its
transformation to a center for a
dynamic research program as
well as a library. Campbell in
dicated a determination to build
up Hoover's reputation as an in
stitution for research and publica
tion. The research would portray
the growth and spread of Com
munism; the publications would
be designed to give aid to gov
ernment policy formation.
Campbell read from Hoover's
official statement of policy: "The
over-all mission of this Institution
lis, from its records, to recall the
voice of experience against the
making of war, and by the study
of these records and their publica
tion to recall man's endeavors to
make and preserve peace and to
sustain for America the safe
guards of the American way of
I life.
Not :» Mere Library
"This Institution is not. and
must not be, a mere library. But
I with these purposes as its goal,
the Institution itself must con
stantly and dynamically point the
road to peace, to personal free
dom. and to the safeguards of
the American system."
We discussed the paragraph
preceding this quote which reads:
"The purpose of this Institution
must be. by its research and pub
lications. to demonstrate the evils
of the doctrines of Karl Marx
whether Communism, Socialism,
economic materialism, or atheism
thus to protect the American
way of life from such ideologies,
their conspiracies, and to reaffirm
the validity of the American sys
tem."
Family Alarm
Campbell said he was aware
that some faculty members had
become alarmed at the passage.
He affirmed, "I see nothing
wrong with it. do you?" He re
plied to suggestions that such a
policy might violate scholarly pro
cedures and result in a predeter
mined orientation of publications
by staling that, "There are evils
in Marxism, and I hope we expose
them."
The document from w hi c h
Campbell read states that the
Board of Trustees resolution of
May 21, 1959, incorporated Hoov
er's policy statement. Paragraph
3 of the resolution states: "That
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace is an in
dependent Institution within the
frame of Stanford University. Its

relation to the University is that
the President of the University
will propose all appointments,
promotions, and the budget of the
Institution directly to the Board
of Trustees. There will be no ref
erence to any faculty committees
between the President and the
Trustees.
In response to a question about
the relationship between the In
stitution and the faculty. Camp
bell indicated that he hopes to
maintain pleasant relations with
the faculty, that they were free to
use the facilities of Hoover as a
library, hut made it clear that he
was responsible for drawing up
and executing the research pro
gram.
In Cleveland Plain Dealer
Campbell produced an article
written by an acquaintance of
Hoover in the December 5, 1959
issue of the Cleveland Plain Deal
er. The author noted the new re
search and publication program
and stated that the purpose of the
Institution was to sustain the
ideals and institutions cherished
in the United States including its
form of constitutional govern
ment and principles of economic
freedom.
The publication of this article
.strongly suggested that the new
goals of the Hoover Institution
were being broadcast elsewhere
rather more heartily than on the
Stanford campus. When ques
tioned. Campbell said that Hoov
er had been using his statement of
purpose to solicit funds in his
recent money raising campaign in
the East but pointed out that most
of the money did not come from
Hoover's friends but from founda
tions such as the Fleishmann
Foundation.
When asked if the Institution
was still getting money from the
Ford Foundation, Campbell said
no. But he expressed confidence
that money would not be scarce
when the research and publication
program got going.
The resolution further states in
paragraph 7, "The Director of the
Institution shall be recommended
to the Board of Trustees by the
President of the University for
appointment by the Trustees. He
shall have been previously ap
proved by Mr. Hoover. Such rec
ommendations of the President
shall not require approval of the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council of Stanford University."
The resolution also provides
that Stanford University shall
give not less than $125,000 a year
to Hoover Institution. This
amounts to 40 per cent of the In
stitution's annual budget, and
another 25 per cent is provided by
the Institution's endowment. The
remainder is obtained from gifts
and grants.

(individuals acting as representa
tives in foreign countries.
In an attempt to find what the
; future of the Library and its
relationship with Stanford would
be, I interviewed the newly ap
pointed director, Dr. Westley G.
Campbell. He said that the change
of name of the Library to the
Hoover Institution reflected its
transformation to a center for a
dynamic research program as
well as a library. Campbell in
dicated a determination to build
up Hoover's reputation as an in
stitution for research and publica
tion. The research would portray
the growth and spread of Com
munism; the publications would
be designed to give aid to gov
ernment policy formation.
Campbell read from Hoover's
official statement of policy: "The
over-all mission of this Institution
lis, from its records, to recall the
voice of experience against the
making of war, and by the study
of these records and their publica
tion to recall man's endeavors to
make and preserve peace and to
sustain for America the safe
guards of the American way of
I life.
Not :» Mere Library
"This Institution is not. and
must not be, a mere library. But
I with these purposes as its goal,
the Institution itself must con
stantly and dynamically point the
road to peace, to personal free
dom. and to the safeguards of
the American system."
We discussed the paragraph
preceding this quote which reads:
"The purpose of this Institution
must be. by its research and pub
lications. to demonstrate the evils
of the doctrines of Karl Marx
whether Communism, Socialism,
economic materialism, or atheism
thus to protect the American
way of life from such ideologies,
their conspiracies, and to reaffirm
the validity of the American sys
tem."
Family Alarm
Campbell said he was aware
that some faculty members had
become alarmed at the passage.
He affirmed, "I see nothing
wrong with it. do you?" He re
plied to suggestions that such a
policy might violate scholarly pro
cedures and result in a predeter
mined orientation of publications
by staling that, "There are evils
in Marxism, and I hope we expose
them."
The document from w hi c h
Campbell read states that the
Board of Trustees resolution of
May 21, 1959, incorporated Hoov
er's policy statement. Paragraph
3 of the resolution states: "That
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace is an in
dependent Institution within the
frame of Stanford University. Its

relation to the University is that
the President of the University
will propose all appointments,
promotions, and the budget of the
Institution directly to the Board
of Trustees. There will be no ref
erence to any faculty committees
between the President and the
Trustees.
In response to a question about
the relationship between the In
stitution and the faculty. Camp
bell indicated that he hopes to
maintain pleasant relations with
the faculty, that they were free to
use the facilities of Hoover as a
library, hut made it clear that he
was responsible for drawing up
and executing the research pro
gram.
In Cleveland Plain Dealer
Campbell produced an article
written by an acquaintance of
Hoover in the December 5, 1959
issue of the Cleveland Plain Deal
er. The author noted the new re
search and publication program
and stated that the purpose of the
Institution was to sustain the
ideals and institutions cherished
in the United States including its
form of constitutional govern
ment and principles of economic
freedom.
The publication of this article
.strongly suggested that the new
goals of the Hoover Institution
were being broadcast elsewhere
rather more heartily than on the
Stanford campus. When ques
tioned. Campbell said that Hoov
er had been using his statement of
purpose to solicit funds in his
recent money raising campaign in
the East but pointed out that most
of the money did not come from
Hoover's friends but from founda
tions such as the Fleishmann
Foundation.
When asked if the Institution
was still getting money from the
Ford Foundation, Campbell said
no. But he expressed confidence
that money would not be scarce
when the research and publication
program got going.
The resolution further states in
paragraph 7, "The Director of the
Institution shall be recommended
to the Board of Trustees by the
President of the University for
appointment by the Trustees. He
shall have been previously ap
proved by Mr. Hoover. Such rec
ommendations of the President
shall not require approval of the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council of Stanford University."
The resolution also provides
that Stanford University shall
give not less than $125,000 a year
to Hoover Institution. This
amounts to 40 per cent of the In
stitution's annual budget, and
another 25 per cent is provided by
the Institution's endowment. The
remainder is obtained from gifts
and grants.
Many students attend Stanford

Modest research has suggested
that recent changes have occurred
in the goals of the Institution
which demand the attention of all

The history of the Institution
is an interesting story. President
Hoover began collecting docu
ments while conducting the Bel
gian Relief Program during World
War 1 in an attempt to provide a
thorough collection of records for
the understanding of the causes
and course of the war. Hoover
had many agents helping him; it
is said that when the Bela Kun
regime in Hungary collapsed in
1919. a truck backed up to the
government documents office.
Shortly thereafter, nearly com
plete records of the first Hun
garian Communist government
turned up at Stanford University,
ttolslievik Documents
In gratitude for Hoover's fam

Union (and many Russian schol

Toward the end of the 20's. the
records of World War 1 and its
aftermath were fairly complete

of Hitler led to the decision to ex

As the Main Library could not
process and house all the ma

contributed to Hoover's fund to
establish a separate building
which was dedicated on June 20,
1911, as the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution, and Peace. By
1919, Hoover Library had 25 mil

collection of over 3.000 titles and
the most complete 20th century
collection of primary materials on
World War I. Germany, Russia
and Japan.
Middle East Collection
Through the efforts of Profes

collection. Each collection Slavic,

Today the Library employs a

Family Alarm
Campbell said he was aware
that some faculty members had
become alarmed at the passage.
He affirmed, "I see nothing
wrong with it. do you?" He re
plied to suggestions that such a
policy might violate scholarly pro
cedures and result in a predeter
mined orientation of publications
by staling that, "There are evils
in Marxism, and I hope we expose
them."
The document from w hi c h
Campbell read states that the
Board of Trustees resolution of
May 21, 1959, incorporated Hoov
er's policy statement. Paragraph
3 of the resolution states: "That
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace is an in
dependent Institution within the
frame of Stanford University. Its

relation to the University is that
the President of the University
will propose all appointments,
promotions, and the budget of the
Institution directly to the Board
of Trustees. There will be no ref
erence to any faculty committees
between the President and the
Trustees.
In response to a question about
the relationship between the In

bell indicated that he hopes to
maintain pleasant relations with
the faculty, that they were free to
use the facilities of Hoover as a
library, hut made it clear that he
was responsible for drawing up
and executing the research pro

In Cleveland Plain Dealer
Campbell produced an article
written by an acquaintance of
Hoover in the December 5, 1959
issue of the Cleveland Plain Deal
er. The author noted the new re
search and publication program
and stated that the purpose of the
Institution was to sustain the
ideals and institutions cherished
in the United States including its
form of constitutional govern
ment and principles of economic
freedom.
The publication of this article
.strongly suggested that the new
goals of the Hoover Institution
were being broadcast elsewhere
rather more heartily than on the
Stanford campus. When ques
tioned. Campbell said that Hoov
er had been using his statement of
purpose to solicit funds in his
recent money raising campaign in
the East but pointed out that most
of the money did not come from
Hoover's friends but from founda
tions such as the Fleishmann
Foundation.
When asked if the Institution
was still getting money from the
Ford Foundation, Campbell said
no. But he expressed confidence
that money would not be scarce
when the research and publication
program got going.
The resolution further states in
paragraph 7, "The Director of the
Institution shall be recommended
to the Board of Trustees by the
President of the University for
appointment by the Trustees. He
shall have been previously ap
proved by Mr. Hoover. Such rec
ommendations of the President
shall not require approval of the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council of Stanford University."
The resolution also provides
that Stanford University shall
give not less than $125,000 a year
to Hoover Institution. This
amounts to 40 per cent of the In
stitution's annual budget, and
another 25 per cent is provided by
the Institution's endowment. The
remainder is obtained from gifts
and grants.
Many students attend Stanford
without becoming acquainted with
the Hoover Institution its col
lections and its significance for
Stanford.
Th[s article was undertaken
with the idea of providing some
information to breach this gap.
Modest research has suggested
that recent changes have occurred
in the goals of the Institution
which demand the attention of all
members of Stanford.
The history of the Institution
is an interesting story. President
Hoover began collecting docu
ments while conducting the Bel
gian Relief Program during World
War 1 in an attempt to provide a
thorough collection of records for
the understanding of the causes
and course of the war. Hoover
had many agents helping him; it
is said that when the Bela Kun
regime in Hungary collapsed in
1919. a truck backed up to the
government documents office.
Shortly thereafter, nearly com
plete records of the first Hun
garian Communist government
turned up at Stanford University,
ttolslievik Documents
In gratitude for Hoover's fam
ine relief program, the Soviet
Union (and many Russian schol
ars) contributed a mass of valu
able documents on the fall of the
Czarist and Provisional govern
ments and the ascension of the
Bolsheviks,
Toward the end of the 20's. the
records of World War 1 and its
aftermath were fairly complete
and collecting fell riff. But the rise
of Hitler led to the decision to ex
pand I he collect ion into a 20th
century library.
As the Main Library could not
process and house all the ma
terials. many wealthy individuals
contributed to Hoover's fund to
establish a separate building
which was dedicated on June 20,
1911, as the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution, and Peace. By
1919, Hoover Library had 25 mil
lion items including a newspaper
collection of over 3.000 titles and
the most complete 20th century
collection of primary materials on
World War I. Germany, Russia
and Japan.
Middle East Collection
Through the efforts of Profes
sors Mary and Arthur Wright,
Hoover Library acquired an un
equalled documentary record of
the rise of the Communists in
China. In recent years, it has ob
tained an exceptional Middle East
collection. Each collection Slavic,
Western European, Chinese (in
cluding Taiwan). Japanese, Middle
Eastern and African is under
the auspices of a curator.
Today the Library employs a
staff of nearly 50 people compe
tent in 35 languages to process
and catalogue thousands of per
iodicals as well as books and docu
ments. These materials are pro

| cured by purchases from hook
films in America and abroad,
through exchange relations with
libraries throughout the world
and with the assistance of many
(individuals acting as representa
tives in foreign countries.
In an attempt to find what the
; future of the Library and its
relationship with Stanford would
be, I interviewed the newly ap
pointed director, Dr. Westley G.
Campbell. He said that the change
of name of the Library to the
Hoover Institution reflected its
transformation to a center for a
dynamic research program as
well as a library. Campbell in
dicated a determination to build
up Hoover's reputation as an in
stitution for research and publica
tion. The research would portray
the growth and spread of Com
munism; the publications would
be designed to give aid to gov
ernment policy formation.
Campbell read from Hoover's
official statement of policy: "The
over-all mission of this Institution
lis, from its records, to recall the
voice of experience against the
making of war, and by the study
of these records and their publica
tion to recall man's endeavors to
make and preserve peace and to
sustain for America the safe
guards of the American way of
I life.

"This Institution is not. and
must not be, a mere library. But

the American system."
