### 
Editor's Note: The following
is a copy of flic document from
which Dr. West ley Campbell,
Director of Hoover Institution,
read during an interview which
is reported elsewhere on this
page. This document lias been
used by Herbert Hoover on the
East Coast in an effort to solicit
funds for the Institution.
At the request of the Trustees
of Stanford University, Air. Hoov
er prepared for them a statement
: reviewing the background and the
j purposes of the Institution. Mr.
i I Joover said:
"During this century there have
j developed forces and events
which, as never before in our na
tural life, have had so profound an
I effect on our independence, our
! form of government, our social
i and economic system, and the set
ting of the American people in the
international world.
"Here in this Institution is the
greatest amassing of the records
of these forces and events, which
exist in the world. Its upbuilding
and preservation have become
| doubly precious to the world be
cause of the wholesale destruction
of libraries and historical material
! during the Second World War.
| Over 50 organizations and fid na
tions have contributed to the
building up of this two score mil
lions of documents, books, and
items covering the two great wars
and their aftermaths.
"Here are the records of the
j causes of war, their destructions,
j and their consequences to man
j kind.
"Here are the unique military
: records which have and can con

| tribute to the defense of the Unit
| ed States.
"Here are the records of nations
striving for independence and
! constitutional protection of Hie
liberties of men.
"Here are the records of men's
strivings, their ideals, and their
' negotiations and failures to make
and sustain peace in the world
from these two world wars.
"And here are the documents
which record the great drama of
superlative sacrifice, of glory, of
victory, of sorrow, of death, which
inspired the idealism of men in
bolh the making of war and the
1 hopes of peace.
"Here are also the most com
i plete existing records of revolu
tions to Communism, Nazism, So
cialism, aggresivc nationalism,
the concentration of power in gov
ernments, their reduction of men
to slavery, their denial of govern
ment by their people, their denial
of the dignity of the individual
man, and their destruction of the
foundations of religious beliefs
through atheism and agnosticism.
"And hei'e are the records of
, the lowest of trickery and con
spiracies to overthrow the gov
ernments of free men and the re
peated violations of promises and
agreements.
"Before the purposes of the In
stitution can be summarized,
, there must be some review of the
purposes of the American people
j which must be sustained by this
Institution. II -scarcely needs to be
| stated that this Institution sup
; ports the Constitution of the Unit
ed States, its Bill of Rights, and
jits method of representative gov
! eminent.
"Both our social and economic
systems are based on private en
terprise from which springs initia
tive and ingenuity. Freedom in
our economic system is limited by
provision of law that there shall
not be hurt to others through
harmful monopoly or unfair com
: petition.
j "But the American system goes
far beyond the provisions of the
Constitution and laws. Our people
| hold concepts of voluntary and
cooperative associations far be
yond the range of government.
I "In the -social and intellectual
advancement of our people, such
associations contribute great in
! stitutions devoted to religious, ed
ucational, and scientific purposes;
j they provide for the sick, the
| aged, and the dependent children.
In the economic field, our associa
tional activities create skills and
the diffusion of knowledge among
the people. Ours is a system
i where the Federal Government
; should undertake no governmen
tal, social or economic action, ex
cept where local government or
the people cannot undertake it for
themselves.
"A purpose of this Institution is
to support these great associa
tional activities.
"The purpose of this Institution
must be, by its research and pub
lications, to demonstrate the evils
of the doctrines of Karl Marx
whet her Communism, Socialism,
economic materialism, or atheism
thus to protect the American
way of life from such ideologies,
their conspiracies, and to reaffirm
the validity of the American sys
| tem.

"The over all mission of this |
Institution is, from its records,
to recall the voice of experience
against the making of war, and by
the study of these records and
their publication to recall man's
endeavors to make and preserve
peace and to sustain for Ameri
ca the safeguards of the Ameri
can way of life.
"This Institution is not, and
must not be, a mere library. But
with these purposes as its goal,
the Institution itself must con
stantly and dynamically point the
road to peace, to personal free
dom, and to the safeguards of
the American system.
"And finally, among the many
other materials in the Hoover
Archives is the record of the com
passion of the American people,
who, by self-denial and long hours
of labor, provided the margins of
food, medicines, and clothing
which, in the wars of the present
century, have enabled over one
billion four hundred million hu- j
man beings to survive who other-1
wise would have perished."
The Board of Trustees of Stan
ford University on May 21, 1959,

the Institution does not assume
responsibility for statements in
ihe publication.
Qualified scholars from outside
the Hoover Institution must be
free to publish anything they wish
from the unrestricted documents
