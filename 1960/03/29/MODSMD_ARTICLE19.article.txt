# Cinder Action Highlighted By Shot Put Controversy
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
The questions that could be
asked after two vacation track
meets sound like the> might have
been left over from a radiq soap
opera.
Will Krnie Cunlifl'e run a l'our
minuto mile?
How far can Jerry Winters
throw the shot?
Who is Vance Barnes?
What is the world record for
the shot put?
We'll do them in reverse order
so as to be able to finish up on
the happy note provided by Cun
liffe.
On March IS the accepted world
mark for the shot put was Perry
O'Brian's toss of 03-2. Dallas Long
had a try of 03-7 up for recogni
tion by the committee that de
cides upon such things.
On March 19 Lieutenant Bill
Neider participated as a guest in
the Stanford Invitational Relays
in the Stadium and threw the
shot 63-10. This mark was prompt
ly submitted to the committee.
Long Tops Mark
Last Saturday Long came up
with a 64-6 1 2 throw in Los An
geles to wipe out Nieder's mark.
The hitch is that Long's throw
came on a field that tilts and
which the committee has refused
to recognize as lega] for shot put
records.
Some say lhat the field has
been fixed, but the confusion re
mains. Record, record, who holds
the record?
As for Winters, Stanford's top
putter, he's nowhere near the
world's record, but lie's coming
up with some good tosses. In the
invitational meet Winters put the
shot 55-10 and a week later, in
a meet with Santa Clara Youth
Village and the Olympic Club, he

throw il 5(5-10's. That's bettor
than hols over done and hopefully
Winters can still improve.

Then there's Vance Barnes. He
high jumps for San Jose and his
first moot, the Invitational Re
lays in the Stadium, ho jumped
6-10. Varnes is 5-11 and the story
is that San Jose coach, Bud Win
tor became interested in his high
jumping possibilities when ho saw
Barnes dunking a basketball wiih
both hands.
Cunliffo? Well, Ernie turned
in a 4:02.4 mile in his end of a
four-man four-mile relay race
against ihe Youth Village Satur
day and he may now have Olym
pic chances in two events, the 800
and 1500 meters. He won't run
the mile against Fresno State
Saturday, but he will do the four
lapper in the important meet com
ing up with San Jose and Kansas
April 9.

than hols over done and hopefully
Winters can still improve.

Then there's Vance Barnes. He
high jumps for San Jose and his
first moot, the Invitational Re
lays in the Stadium, ho jumped
6-10. Varnes is 5-11 and the story
is that San Jose coach, Bud Win
tor became interested in his high
jumping possibilities when ho saw
Barnes dunking a basketball wiih
both hands.
Cunliffo? Well, Ernie turned
in a 4:02.4 mile in his end of a
four-man four-mile relay race
against ihe Youth Village Satur
day and he may now have Olym
pic chances in two events, the 800
and 1500 meters. He won't run
the mile against Fresno State
Saturday, but he will do the four
lapper in the important meet com
ing up with San Jose and Kansas
April 9.
The questions that could be
asked after two vacation track
meets sound like the> might have
been left over from a radiq soap
opera.
Will Krnie Cunlifl'e run a l'our
minuto mile?
How far can Jerry Winters
throw the shot?
Who is Vance Barnes?
What is the world record for
the shot put?
We'll do them in reverse order
so as to be able to finish up on
the happy note provided by Cun
liffe.
On March IS the accepted world
mark for the shot put was Perry
O'Brian's toss of 03-2. Dallas Long
had a try of 03-7 up for recogni
tion by the committee that de
cides upon such things.
On March 19 Lieutenant Bill
Neider participated as a guest in
the Stanford Invitational Relays
in the Stadium and threw the
shot 63-10. This mark was prompt
ly submitted to the committee.
Long Tops Mark
Last Saturday Long came up
with a 64-6 1 2 throw in Los An
geles to wipe out Nieder's mark.
The hitch is that Long's throw
came on a field that tilts and
which the committee has refused
to recognize as lega] for shot put
records.
Some say lhat the field has
been fixed, but the confusion re
mains. Record, record, who holds
the record?
As for Winters, Stanford's top
putter, he's nowhere near the
world's record, but lie's coming
up with some good tosses. In the
invitational meet Winters put the
shot 55-10 and a week later, in
a meet with Santa Clara Youth
Village and the Olympic Club, he

throw il 5(5-10's. That's bettor
than hols over done and hopefully
Winters can still improve.
