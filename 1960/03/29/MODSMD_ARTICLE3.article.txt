Appropriately enough, spring
quarter's Stanford Film Society
film series will feature movies in
which a master director investi
gates the ambiguities of love.
So great has been student, fac
ulty and off-campus interest in

movie productions that showings
have been stepped up to three
times a week.

Paradise" tomorrow, the nine
picture series will be presented in
Cubberley Auditorium at 7:30
p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays,
with a 4:15 matinee showing on
Thursdays added.
No single admissions are sold.
Membership cards good for the
entire series are $1.50 and are on
sale at the Memorial Auditorium
box office.

clude: "Marianne of My Youth,"

of Cabiria," Kederico Fellini, April
