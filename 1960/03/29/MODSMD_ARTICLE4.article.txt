# Spring Quarter Registration Hits 7521; Partially Completed Bookstore Opens As Over-Eager Students Create Lines
## New Grouping System Tried 
### Austin Scott 
At 8 a.m. last Friday, .just eight
days after the first anniversary
of the start of construction, the
new Stanford Bookstore opened
for business.
The store still isn't finished, as
you will see when you go in, hut
at least the "traditional" book
store lines are no more.
There were long lines for a
short while yesterday morning,
but Bookstore M a n a g e r Mrs.
Bachou attributes this to students
corning as early as possible in
anticipation of waiting in line.
She said if large groups of stu
dents stop coming in at 8 a.m.,
the lines should disappear.
Textbooks Only
As yet, only textbooks are in
the new self-service store. All
texts are located on the mezza
nine. The first page of the book
lists contains a map showing the
locations of each department's
texts.
All other supplies, including
books in the General Book De
partment, are still in the old store.
Shelves, bookcases and other fix
tures are still being installed in
the new building.
When this is completed, the
other bookstore departments will
move in. The departments will
remain the same in kind, but will
be enlarged in size.
Self-Service Policy
Mrs. Bachou said the self-serv
ice policy seems to be working
very well. Students select their
books and take them to one of
the check-out stands near the
front doors.
The Bookstore is trying a new
system in grouping related books
together- all the humanities to
gether instead of grouping them
by courses alphabetically. Mrs.
Bachou would appreciate com
ments from students on how they
like the new system.
Use Front Doors
All students are asked to use
only the front doors facing Union
Court. Because of the construe- i
tion, only a limited area of the I
store is open to students.
The complete move from the
old store will take place in the
next few weeks, Mrs. Bachou
said.
Stanford Police Chief Gordon
Davis announced that as of yes
terday. the parking lot behind the i
new store is zoned for 40-minute j
parking only. This lot may be
entered from Alvai'ado or Salva
tierra Streets and not from Lane
B.
Chief Davis also announced |
that there is to be no parking
whatever along the bookstore-
Post Office side of Lasuen Street
between Santa Teresa and Pana
ma Streets. Construction machin
ery will need the space.
