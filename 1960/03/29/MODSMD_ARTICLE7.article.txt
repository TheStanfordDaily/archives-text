# Money, Yes... Pennies, No!

Senior Roy Kaylor has a slight
problem on his hands this morn
ing. What does one do with a
wheelbarrow full of 33,300 pen
nies?
The weighty pr ob 1 e m came
about when Kaylor and his load
of coppers were rolled up to a
window in the Pavilion in the
wheelbarrow yesterday and lie
tried to pay his $333 tuitioji with
f>7() fifty-cent rolls of pennies.
It didn't work. Student cashier
Stan Smith, peering from behind
seven sacks and a couple score j
rolls of pennies piled up in front
of him. informed Kaylor and his
helpers that the Univcrsily legally
didn't have to accept more than
23 of the Lincoln-heads.
After 15 minutes of humorous
argument, Kaylor finally gave in
and paid I tic money with a check.
The venture didn't come as a
surprise, though. After Kaylor
got the pennies al the Bank of
America's Stanford branch, the
bank called the Controller's Office
and gave Warning.
Kaylor's rather unusual arrival
caused no great stir among the
crowd of students in the Pavilion.
Some smiled, some shook theii
heads. The lady at the final stop
seemed mildly amused when Kay
lor was wheeled up to her table
to turn in his reg book.
Kaylor did find a solution to
his problem. As soon as lie can
get to the bank, his checking
account will be 33,300 pennies
fatter.
