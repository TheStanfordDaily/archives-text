### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — U.S. in
vestigators held yesterday a
i sworn statement that Castro offi
cials conspired in an illegal plane 1
flight which Cubans have blamed 1
; lon the United States.
The statement came from Wil- j
j liam Schergales, one of the two J
| U.S. fliers held by the Cubans
; since their small private craft
came down in Matanzas, Cuba, j
on March 21.
, ! Schergales was said to have;
plotted the incident with Dr. Juan
Orta, a personal secretary in the
office of Prime Minister Fidel
, ! Castro.

Washington authorities viewed
; the incident as a bungled attempt j
I by the Castro regime to give!
Uncle Sam a propaganda black j
i eye throughout Latin America
i and at the same time to get rid
• of one of Castro's Cuban enemies.
Some officials here considered!
referring the case to tho Peace)
Committee of the Organization of,
, American States, an inter-Ameri-j
lean body set up to case Latin-j
I American tension. They saw the,
flight as a violation of both U.S. j
land Cuban law, undertaken to
inflame Cuban passions against ;
Americans.
( astro Version
According to the original ver-i
j sion of the incident put out by
the Castro-controlled press, Seller- j
gales, 33, of West Hollywood, Fla., i
and Howard L. Rundquist, 35, of
Miami, Fla., were forced down by j
gunfire when they flew in from
Florida to pick up Lt. Col. Da-1
maseo Montesino, a police chief;
lander Fulgcncia Batista, ousted
former Cuban president.
Cuban sources promptly pic
tured this as further evidence of ,
j what they claim are aggressive]
American designs against Cuba.
But the press stories soon died
down. After a U.S. consul visited
Schergales in jail, reports circu- j
lated that the flight was a Castro j
I plot. J
