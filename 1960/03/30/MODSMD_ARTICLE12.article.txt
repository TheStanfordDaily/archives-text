## 
### 
GETTYSBURG, Pa. (/P) â€” The
United States and Britain accept
ed yesterday the idea of a short
term ban on small underground
nuclear tests if the Soviet Union
agrees firsl to a treaty providing
cheat-proof inspection of bigger
blasts.
President Eisenhower and Brit
ish Prime Minister Harold Mac
millan jointly unveiled the new
proposal at the climax of a two

day strategy conference at Camp
David in the Maryland mountains
south of here.
An American spokesman said
that if the Soviets are sincere it
should be possible to sign such a
historic inspection treaty within
90 days.
Eisenhower and Macmillan, in a
windup statement, said they put
forward their offer in a sincere
effort to break the 17-month-old
| deadlock on how to ban nuclear
weapons testing above and below
ground.
Pending an answer from the
Soviet Union, a spokesman for
i Eisenhower said he knew of no
plans to stage underground nu
clear tests in the United States.
Soviet Proposal
The Eisenhower-M acm i 11 a n
offer came as a reply to a Soviet
j proposal 11 days ago calling for
a halt to hard -to - detect undor
-1 ground blasts while East-West ex
perts work out acceptable on-site
: inspection. The Soviets proposed
i that such a ban last four or five
years.
The two Western leaders said
they immediately would instruct
their disarmament chiefs, now
meeting with Soviet representa
i tives in Geneva, to introduce their
I offer formally into the talks.
In a move to speed progress,
i Eisenhower and Macmillan invit-
I ed the Soviet government to join
| at once with the U.S. and British
| governments in a coordinated re
j search program which they hope
! eventually will devise methods of
detecting even tiny blasts,
j In briefing newsmen afterward,
i the American spokesman said
| Macmillan and Eisenhower bo
| lieve the ban on small under
ground tests should last about a
| year.
The Senate would be called
upon to ratify the formal treaty
setting up the control system on
other weapons tests.
Harmonious End
The Efsenhower-Macmillan con
ference, hastily arranged amid
fears of widespread British-Amer
ican differences, wound up in a
burst of harmonious declarations.
British spokesmen said the two
leaders had reforged a united
stand of the nuclear disarmament
front, Further, they said, they
had reviewed East - West issues
such as Berlin and Germany, and
had discussed European economic
rivalries.
Macmillan and Eisenhower
stayed overnight at the heavily
guarded Camp David retreat.
Macmillan planned to leave by
plane for London Wednesday.
