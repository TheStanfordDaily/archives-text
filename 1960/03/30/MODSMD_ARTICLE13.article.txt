# College Plan Moves Ahead
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO </P) - The col
lege master plan, backed by Gov.
Brown, took big steps forward in
the Legislature yesterday.
The college plan, by Sen. George
Miller Jr. (D-Martinez), tries to
do by statute what a survey team
of educators wanted done by con
stitutional amendment: end the
bickering for money, sites and
prestige among the University of
California, the state colleges and
the junior colleges.
Miller's bill would set up a new
board to run the state colleges,
and create a co-ordinating coun
cil to review budget and pick sites
for new campuses for the univer
sity, colleges and jaysees.
