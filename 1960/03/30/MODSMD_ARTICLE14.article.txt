President Sterling litis made il clear in an interview with the
1 )uil\ that ii Itimate control of 111«' Hoover Institution rests in the
President's Office and I lie Hoard ol I rustees.
Heeause llie President approves all expenditures, research
projects, and appointineiits within the Institution, it appears that
he is vested with power to oversee the actions of the director of
the Institution in these areas.
Implicit in President Sterling's statement is a request for the
confidence of Stanford faculty and students in the President's
Office for the correct administration of the Hoover Institution
throughout Mr. Hoover's life.
We question, however, the cflicac\ of the President's control.
The director of the Hoover Institution has been and must be
approved by Mr. Hoover. 112
According to the Trustees' statement of May 21, 1959, the direc
tor must also reflect the "purposes" of the Institution.
To date onl\ Mr. Hoover has issued a statement of "purposes'
for the Institution. According to President Sterling, the Hoard of
Trustees would have us believe that their delineation of the Insti
tution's operating policv and control suffices for their statement
of "purposes."
In this maze we fail to see a clear exposition of the Truste.es'
concept of the Hoover Institution's "purposes." We do see from
the interview with present director Dr. Westley Campbell in yes
terday's Daily that he agrees with Mr. Hoover's statement of
"purposes."
The effect of this agreement might well he the prejudicial
suppression of some of the invaluable documents in the Hoover
Institution's collection.
\\ c believe Mr. Hoover's statement of "purposes' is a llagranl
violation of academic freedom, and that it is detrimental to
Stanford's reputation in the academic world.
We therefore feel that tlx' Hoard of Trustees has an obliga
tion to make its statement of "purposes" clear.
