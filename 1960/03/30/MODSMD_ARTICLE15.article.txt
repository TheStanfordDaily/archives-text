# Interview With Sterling
## 
### Steve Freidberg, Editor 
In an interview with the Daily
yesterday, President Wall ac e
Sterling said that the statement
passed by the Board of Trustees
on March 17, reprinted on this
page, includes the correct version
of Paragraph 1 of the Trustees'
resolution of May 21, 1959, on
Hoover Institution.
The Paragraph 1 quoted in yes
terday's Daily as "Incorporated
Mr. Hoover's statement (review
ing the background and the pur
poses of the Institution) as given
in the preceding pages" was is
sued unilaterally by Mr. Hoover
last year. The document in which
this erroneous paragraph ap
peared was brought to the atten
tion of the President and Board
of Trustees only two months ago.
Sterling stated. He said that the
actual resolution of the Board of
Trustees is now being made
known in order to correct any
mistaken impressions.
The Trustees included in their
statement a clarification of their
intentions and a reaffirmation of
their desires for academic free
dom at Stanford.

j Sterling also emphasized that
control of Hoover Institution is
still retained by the President and
Board of Trustees.
Although the appointment of
the Director of the Institution,
| according to the Trustees' resolu
tion, has to be approved by Mr.
Hoovei', the President and the
Trustees must assent to all re
: search projects, appropriations
of funds for the Library's collec
-1 tions. and appointments to the
j staff of the Institution. This,
1 Sterling pointed out, eliminates
| the possibility of these projects
and collections being used by ihe
I Director for any particular ideo
j logical purpose.
The present Director, under the
( Trustees' resolution, has only ad
; ministrative tenure, whereas the
i former director, C. Easton Roth
j well, had academic tenure. Ster-
I ling declined to give a reason for
! this change of policy.
He said that the present Direc
tor, West ley G. Campbell, has in
dicated that he understands i'ully
the meaning of Paragraph 1 of
! the Trustees' resolution and the
: Trustees' intention that the Li
-1 brary bo operated on the principle
! of academic freedom.
