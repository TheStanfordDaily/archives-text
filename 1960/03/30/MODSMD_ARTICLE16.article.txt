# Statement of Trustees

### 
At its meeting of February 16,
1960, the Advisory Board of the
Academic Council of Stanford
University adopted the following
statement:
The pamphlet quoting action
of the Board of Trustees in con
nection with the policies of the
Hoover Institution has recently
come to the attention of members
of the faculty.
Some features of this action
are inconsistent with the tradi
tional policies of Stanford Univer
sity with regard to freedom of
inquiry and scholarship. There
fore a number of members of the
faculty wish some kind of posi
tive statement from the Board of
Trustees reaffirming Stanford's
dedication to freedom.
At its meeting of March 17.
1960, the Board of Trustees of
Stanford University, after careful
consideration of the statement of
February 16, 1960, of the Faculty
Advisory Board, adopted the fol
lowing statement :
The Trustees would like to call
attention to the actual wording of
Paragraph 1 of their resolution.
It is as follows:

"The Trustees feel that there
should be in their records a state
ment of the score, the importance
and the purposes of the Hoover
Institution. To this end Mr. Hoov
er has prepared for them the fol
lowing statements:"
The Trustees believe it is en
tirely proper and desirable to have
in the official record of the Uni
versity and as a preface to and
separate from the resolutions on
operating policies a -statement
concerning the desires and aspira
tions of the man who founded the
great Institution which bears his
name and who, by untiring work
during his lifetime, has personally
been so largely responsible for
the great collections which have
been made there available for the
scholars of the world.
The Trustees did not contem
plate that Mr. Hoover's statement
would be interpreted as university
policy or as an abridgement of
free inquiry. They stand for the
principle, that academic freedom
in the highest university tradition
is expected to prevail throughout
Stanford.
