Editor's Note: The following 1
comments were given to the
Daily by various members of
tlk* faculty and administration.
I am glad that the Trustees at
their meeting of March IT, 1960,
have reaffirmed their belief in
the principles of free inquiry.
Although 1 was Acting Direc
tor of the Hoover Institution at
the time, I knew nothing about
Mr. Hoover's revised statement
of purposes or the Trustees' vote

j of May 21, 1959, until some time
j afterward. Speaking as an indi-
I vidual, I cannot agree with Dr.
Campbell's views as quoted by
! the Daily. I think a university
can best support the principles
: of a free society and also of reli
gion by an unfettered and objec-
I tive search for truth.
Philip II. Khindanrier
Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences

The Hoover Library's new state
i ment of purpose is certainly a
| flagrant violation of the principles
of research and scholarship
in a modern university. It is
equally regrettable that the Uni
versity agreed to special arrange
ments exempting this Library
I from the normal controls which
the University exercises over its
libraries. The Hoover's new (state
ment of purpose makes Stanford's
loss of control (which is danger -
! ous enough > even more dangerous
j than it woidd ordinarily be.
Otis Pease
Associate Professor
of History
The statement of purpose of tho
Hoover Institution is inconsistent
with the purposes of Stanford as
a great university. Any organi
zation of this University must be
concerned with finding truth
rather than "demonstrating the
| evils" of disapproved beliefs. The
statement carries a connotation
| of thought control which can have
no place in a great university.
William M. McC'ord
Assistant Professor
of Sociology
Several professors who did not
wish to be quoted expressed a
similar opinion. One professor
called the statement of policy
"a shocking perversion of what
ought to be the academic aims
of such an institution." Another
professor termed it "a complete
negation of what this University
stands for." and said that the
"Winds of Freedom don't blow
over there (Hoover Institution)."
He stated that he felt sure the
views were those only of that
octogenarian to whom he had
referred (Hoover) and his friends.
Several of the professors talked
to expressecf a willingness to sign
a petition to register their dis
approval if one were circulated.
