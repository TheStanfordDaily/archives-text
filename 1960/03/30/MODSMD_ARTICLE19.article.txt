# CAUSES ELUSIVE
## Pass Laws Incite African Violence As Natives Riot Against Authorities 
### William Jacobson 
The forces of the political jig-
I saw that have given rise to the
! recent unrest in South Africa are
as elusive as the contents of Pan
i dora's box.
The ostensible cause of the dis
turbances were Pass Law protests
by Africans, which resulted in re
taliatory action by the South Afri
can police.
Pass Laws were first promul
gated in Southern Africa 150 years
ago by the early British Gov
ernors of the Cape Colony. The
purpose of these laws was to stop
I vagrancy and thieving by detribal
ized Hottentot peoples and later
by hostile Xhosa tribesmen.
I Industrialization of South Afri
ca this century led to the vast in
flux of migratory African labor
1 into urban centers from ttie whole
I continent south of the equator.
The Pass Laws were extended to
j provide a means of identification
,of Africans, to enable authorities
| to channel the labor supply, to
limit urban overcrowding which
was a social hazard to both Black
and White, and to prevent crime.
Dozen Documents
The laws at one stage required
; Africans to carry about a dozen
! documents to show their territory
of origin, whether they were em
| ployed, their employer's name, his
permission that they be "off
I limits," tax statements, and other
i such information.
In 1952, the present government
j consolidated all documents into
! a single Pass Book. This Book
could be demanded by the police
i for inspection at any time or
1 place. An African unable to pro
duce this was immediately appre
hended with subsequent nominal

fine or prison sentence, or de-1
pol lution if he was from a for-:
eign territory.
The implementation of these '
laws over the years has resulted
in criminalizing large sections of
the African population, and has
caused deep resentment, Opposi
tion to these laws culminated in i
last week's organized protests j
which, it has been reported, were
intended to bo peaceful.
Yet we may seriously question |
whether, after tho violence, the in- j
stantaneous condemnation of the.
South African government and
police by the world press and
governments was justified.
Surrounded
Police stations were surrounded
by thousands of excited demon-1
strators who openly defied the]
laws of the country. The fact that I
protests were against unjust laws j
did not render police duty any less
clear. They had to retain order.
The fact that these demonstra- i
tions culminated in widespread!
arson and rioting indicates too !
that demonstrators were in no j
peaceful mood. To expect that a ;
handful of police should sit timid- j
ly while indignant demonstrators
openly defied their authority and
threatened their safely is to deny
common sense, the rule of law. ;
and their clear duty.
Whether the police used means 1
in exteess of the needs of public j
order is as impossible to re- j
solve at this distance as it is for
the opportunist politicians of
Washington, London, M os c 0 w ,
Delhi, or Accra. What then are
the reasons for this world-wide re-1
action, and what were the forces j
at work behind these "peaceful"
demons! rations?
Political Control
Part of the answer lies within
South Africa itself. Historically,!
political control of the country has |
rested with the White minority j
because of the advanced state of
their civilization, compared with .
the relatively undeveloped indig
enous communities. More particu
larly, control has, since 1948, 1

I shifted to the independent-minded,
! strongly anti-British, Afrikaans
section of the White population.
Motivated by what is probably
the strongest force in Africa to
day, Afrikaner nationalism, Afri
kaans leaders evolved their own
: formula for safeguarding White
security and providing opportun
i ity for growing African aspira
; tions.
The minority English group who
; represent powerful commercial in
| terests are resentful of Afrikaner
political domination and have
I strong emotional attachments to
Great Britain. They oppose the
government's racial legislation on
practical and. moral grounds.
Yet paradoxically, it is they
j who are the greatest instigators
lof social unrest. The English
i press, politicians, and churchmen
! have carried on a relentless eriti-
I cism of the Afrikaans Govern
ment.
Square Deal
Also beginning to play a role in
South Africa are local non-White
political groups. Many of their
I leaders demand no more than a
square deal for their people; more
extreme elements would like to
replace White rule by Black dom
ination. All have been waiting to
test their political teeth, and the
unpopular Pass Laws pVesented
them with their opportunity.
Police violence provided an even
better opportunityâ€”that of call
ing a long hoped for general
1 strike. This occurred on Monday,
apparently successfully. Speedy
government action in announcing
I non-prosecution for Pass Law of
j fences and the arrest of African
leaders, however, threw disorder
into African ranks. Fighting broke
j out between strikers and strike
breakers and flared into new riots.
The violence and strike also
; threaten to topple ihe government
which has hitherto been secure, as
i rumors of a rift in the National
ist Party seep through. They
would probably be replaced by a
coalition of moderate Nationalists
land the opposition United Party.
