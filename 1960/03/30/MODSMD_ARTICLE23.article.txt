# Wilbur Hall Sponsors Continue House System
## 
### Frank Stillman 
In announcing the availability
of sponsor applications for next
year, the sponsor choosing com
mittee wishes to emphasize the
importance of sponsoring in the
Wilbur Hall program, and the
changes which have come about
in sponsoring in recent years.
Wilbur has operated this year
under a new house system, initi
ated at the recommendation of
last year's sponsors. The house
system seeks to provide both a
greater degree of autonomy and
individuality among the eight
houses, and closer personal as
sociation and unity within each
group.
Independent Units
Under the new system each
house is regarded as an inde
pendent unit of approximately one
hundred men, with the respon
sibility for setting up its own
social and cultural program, ad
ministering its own disciplinary
action all but the most extreme
cases, and conducting house gov
ernment in accordance with the
wishes of the members of the
house.
In any freshman group a large
measure of the responsibility for
such a program falls on the spon
sors. The sponsor's job thus re
quires him to work effectively in
several areas, as part of a team
with his fellow sponsors, and with
the Wilbur faculty residents.
Traditionally the sponsor was a

disciplinarian, with the added
duty of providing counseling and
advice when necesary. Under the
present system the sponsors have
expanded their responsibilities,
conducting cultural programs, in
troducing guest speakers and
faculty members to the freshmen,
and assisting them in intellectual
as well as social development.
Such a system has increased
the responsibilities of the spon
sors. It has undoubtedly made
the job more demanding.
('boosing Sponsors
The sponsor choosing commit
tee also wishes to emphasize that
the Wilbur sponsor group now
has the sole responsibility for
selecting the future sponsors. The
Wilbur sponsors are an indepen
dent student group, operating as
an extension of the ASSU.
There is no stereotyped pat
tern for the successful sponsor.
But those selected must be will
ing to devote a considerable share
of their time and effort to the
job. They must be capable of in
dependent and intelligent thought,
of active and mature leadership,
of dealing competently with the
problems of their fellow men.
Provides Opportunity
Sponsoring can provide the
upperclassman with an oppor
tunity not found in any other
campus activity. All those inter
ested are encouraged to take ad
vantage of this opportunity.
