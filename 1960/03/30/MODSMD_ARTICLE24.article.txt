# Defining University for Freshmen Is Important Function of Sponsors
## 
### Miss Elizabeth M. Hanna Director of Branner Hall 
The primary purpose of the j
sponsor is, I believe, to orient !
and inform the new freshmen of
the Stanford traditions, philoso
phy, regulations, mores, and op
portunities and to help them ad
just to these things.
Most would agree to this pur
pose, hut how to accomplish it is I
a much more complex question. J
In their orientation of the fresh
men, the sponsors find that giving |
information is their most immed
iate job. This is something con
crete which offers a definite .sense

of completion and satisfaction to
the sponsor. Similar rewards are
obtained from helping the fresh
men with the many personal and
social problems which develop.
It is very unfortunate that for
many, sponsors and non-sponsors,
this is the extent of sponsor re
sponsibilities. The vast majority
of problems and challenges in
herent in the sponsor position
rest in those facets of the job
which are neither concrete, easily
defined nor immediately reward
ing.
Interpret University
The sponsor must recognize the
fact that in orienting the fresh
men to the university the spon
sor is defining the university for
them.
The sponsor makes her defini
tion in a vast number of ways,
fliroctly and verbally by straight
giving of information and advice
or indirectly by her behavior and
example. The latter method is the
most important by far and the
most difficult one for the sponsor
to handle.
Sponsors Set Ivvample
Because of her personal contact
and closeness in age with the
freshmen, the sponsor often be
comes a model, and it is vitally
important to the freshmen that
the sponsor is one who had de
fined for herself a rich, extensive,
and realistic university experi
ence.
In selecting individuals to fill
the position of sponsor it is im
portant. then, to get students
with the intelligence, ability, flex
ibilitiy and emotional stability to
go far beyond the immediate con
crete demands of the job. Spon
soring can he as broad and as
dynamic as the opportunities and
challenges to be found in the uni
versity and in the human beings
with whom t lie sponsor works.
It is the responsibility of each
sponsor, to the freshmen, the uni
versity and to herself, to realize
the potentials inherent in the
sponsoring opportunity.
