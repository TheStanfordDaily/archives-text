# Sponsors rosier Opposite Goals

### Daryl Glenney 
The sponsor system at Roble
this year seemed to be geared
toward producing both a socially
unified group and a group of high
ly independent individuals. It
partially accomplished both ob
jectives.
During the first few weeks of
school, sponsors were heaven-sent
in the eyes of the freshman girls.
They carefully nurtured the
growth of friendships among their
girls and introduced thorn to so
ciety by arranging endless ex-
changes and parties.
In short, they offered a neat
little package of instant The-Best-
Way-To-Live-At-Stanford, to be
used by freshmen until they could
organize and plan their own exist
ence.
Inevitably there developed an
evil known as "corridor pressure,"
a kind of socialism whereby the
best interests of the individual
girls were subordinated by the
supposed best interests of the
whole group. In many cases,
parties and exchanges planned for
and by the corridors were poorly
attended because there were too
few girls left who needed to cling
to the collective social system.
Many a sponsor may have des
paired at her corridor's apathy,
but only because she herself was
forcing them into a mold in which
they no longer fit.
The best sponsors (and actually
most of them were) were those
who provided easily accessible but
not compulsory advice. They
planned group functions when
necessary and/or desired, but bc
gan early to let the girls plan
their own social life. This ratio
of assistance to need was greatly
appreciated, and produced per
haps the best proof of the value of
the sponsorship system.
