# Marks Set in Title Meet
## 
### Rick Walker 
Four NCAA and five American
citizen records were either broken
or tied in the first California In
tercollegiate Swimming Cham
pionship held at Stanford on
March 3 through 5. Eight of these
records were accounted for by
Southern California's Lance Lar
son and Chuck Bit tick while Stan
lord's George Harrison set the
other.
Larson managed to set four of
these marks, the first two being
in the 200-yard individual medley
Thursday where his 2:05.1 in the
preliminaries set a new American
and NCAA record, breaking I lie
old one of 2:06.5 held by Tony

Tashnik of the University of
Michigan. Larson then went on to
win the finals in 2:05.5, beating
out teammate Chuck Bit tick and
John Jurgensen of Stanford.
The following day Larson again
erased Tashnik's name from the
record books witli a 2:01.3 effort
in the 200-yard butterfly, replac
ing the Michigan ace's old stand
ard of 2:02.2 set in 1959. A strong
second in this event was SC's
Dennis Devine with a 2:03.3.
Larson had just finished his
butterfly event Friday when team
mate Bittick flew off the blocks
to a new 2:01.1 standard in the
200 backstroke, toping Frank Me-
Kinney of Indiana's old NCAA
and American record of 2:01.1.

The following day SC set its
fourth NCAA record as Bittick,
with amazing turns and rapid
; turnovers, sped to a 55.7 100-
j yard back, breaking McKinney's
old record of 56 flat. Bit tick's ef
j fort also tied the American record
by Yoshi Oyakawa of Ohio State,
I giving SC three new American
j records and a tied one.
Harrison in Act
Stanford's Olympic ho p e 112 u 1
I George Harr ison broke through
the SC stream of records Satur
day in the 440 freestyle when he
won that event in 4:20.9, breaking
the old American record of 4:30.2
held by Wayne Moore of Indiana.
The meet itself was a new ex
periment on the West Coast. No
points were kept. It was modeled
after the Eastern Conference
meet at which individual ability
rather than overall team strength
is stressed.
Despite the amazing number of
record setting events and excel
lent individual performances,
probably the top event of the
meet was the 220 free style. The
first three finishers were within
a second of each other.
Winner was Harrison in 2:05.2
whose smooth polished stroke of
ferer! a distinct contrast to that
of SC's Tom Winters who swims
with a much shorter choppier
stroke and whose strong kick
keeps water high in the air
throughout the race.
Tobian Tops Divers
An excellent" diving exhibition
was provided by SC's 1956 Olymp
ic tower champion Gary Tobian,
who won both the one and three
meter events. Behind Tobian at
both heights was teammate Kim
Pen man whose improvement-over
last year was astonishing.
Besides Harrison, Tom Peter
sen was the only other Indian
to be a doubel winner. Petersen's
excellent clocking of 1:01.9 in the
100 breast-stroke was his best of
the year and won that even by
over a second. Jim Cooper of Stan
ford took second with 1:06.1
while teammate Paul Hait com
pleted the three place sweep with
a 1:06.4 third place clocking.

Harrison in Act
Stanford's Olympic ho p e 112 u 1
I George Harr ison broke through
the SC stream of records Satur
day in the 440 freestyle when he
won that event in 4:20.9, breaking
the old American record of 4:30.2
held by Wayne Moore of Indiana.
The meet itself was a new ex
periment on the West Coast. No
points were kept. It was modeled
after the Eastern Conference
meet at which individual ability
rather than overall team strength
is stressed.
Despite the amazing number of
record setting events and excel
lent individual performances,
probably the top event of the
meet was the 220 free style. The
first three finishers were within
a second of each other.
Winner was Harrison in 2:05.2
whose smooth polished stroke of
ferer! a distinct contrast to that
of SC's Tom Winters who swims
with a much shorter choppier
stroke and whose strong kick
keeps water high in the air
throughout the race.
Tobian Tops Divers
An excellent" diving exhibition
was provided by SC's 1956 Olymp
ic tower champion Gary Tobian,
who won both the one and three
meter events. Behind Tobian at
both heights was teammate Kim
Pen man whose improvement-over
last year was astonishing.
Besides Harrison, Tom Peter
sen was the only other Indian
to be a doubel winner. Petersen's
excellent clocking of 1:01.9 in the
100 breast-stroke was his best of
the year and won that even by
over a second. Jim Cooper of Stan
ford took second with 1:06.1
while teammate Paul Hait com
pleted the three place sweep with
a 1:06.4 third place clocking.
