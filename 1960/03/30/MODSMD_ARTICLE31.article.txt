# Card's Arrillaga Selected To All-AAWU First Team
## 
### 
National champion ru-nnerup
California captured most of the
laurels in the first all-AAWU bal
loting, placing three men on the
first team, but Stanford's fine
guard John Arrillaga also gained
the honor.
Darrall Imhoff and Bill McClin
tock of the Bears were unanimous
choices as coaches Forrest Two

good of USC, Pete Newell of Cal,
John W 112) o d en of UCLA, and
Howie Dallmar of the Indians
cast their ballots.
Rounding out the first team
were Earl Shultz of Cal and Bill
Hanson of Washington.
Of the five, Imhoff and Arril
laga are seniors, Shultz and Me-
Clintoek juniors and Hanson is
a sophomore.
Special interest to Stanford fans
is the fact that junior guard Bub

Bowling and sophomore forward
John Windsor gained honorable
mention.
In a final look at the Big Five
statistics, the most interesting
was contributed by UCLA's Gary
Cunningham. The Bruin sopho
more gave future Big Fivers a
tough mark to better as he had
a perfect season at the free-throw
line, converting 28 without a miss.
Sophomore center Bill Hanson
of Washington led the scorers
with 189 points.
All-America Darrall Imhoff
barely edged Arrillaga for second
place, the latter missing one game
because of a s pr a in e d ankle.
John's final average was 13.0.
In the national championship,
Ohio State's marvelous sopho
mores led by All-America Jerry
Lucas crushed defending cham
pion California in the final.
This was a reversal of last
year's tourney in which the Gold
en Bear defense shackled all the
high scorers from the East.
In the game the Buckeyes
dazzled the nations' top defensive
team with an almost unbelievable
first half outburst in which they
hit 16 of 19 field goal attempts.
