"AN EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES"

Twinklv, lovable old Dr. Wagstaff Rigafoos, head of chemistry
at 11 10 I pper Rhode Island College of Science and Palmistry,
cares naught for glory and wealth. All he cares about is to work
in his laboratory, to play Mo/art quartets with a few cronies,
to smoke a good Marlboro, and to throw sticks for his faithful
dog Trey to fetch.
So when, after years of patient research, Dr. Sigafoos dis
covered Reverso, a shaving cream which causes whiskers to
grow inward instead of outward, thus enabling a man to bite
off his beard instead of shaving it, it never even crossed his
mind that he had come upon a key to fame and riches: he simply
assigned all his royalties from Reverso to the college and went
on with his quiet life of working in the laboratory, playing
Mozart quartets, smoking good Marlboros and throwing sticks
for his faithful dog Trey. (Trev, incidentally, had died some
years earlier but habit is a strong thing and Dr. Sigafoos to
this day continues to throw sticks.) •
As everyone knows, Reverso turned out to be a madly success
ful shaving cream. Royalties in the first month amounted to
.S29O,(MM), which came in mighty handy, believe you me, because
the college had long been postponing some urgently needed
repairs—a lightning rod for the men's dormitory, new hoops for
the basketball court, leather patches for the chess loam's elbows
and a penwiper for the 1 )ireetor of Admissions.

Tn the second month royalties amounted to an even million
dollars and the college bought Marlboro cigarettes for all
students and faculty members. It is interesting that the college
chose Marlboro cigarettes though they could well have afforded
more expensive brands. The reason is simply this: you can pay
more for a cigarette but you can't get a better flavor, a better
smoke, ll' you think flavor went out when filters came in, try
a Marlboro. The filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste. You,
too, can smoke like a millionaire at a cost which does no violence
to the slimmest of budgets. Marlboros come in soft pack or
flip-top box and can be found at any tobacco counter. Million
aires can be found on yachts.
Hut I digress. We were speaking of the royalties from
Reverso which continue to accrue at an astonishing rate- now
in excess of one million dollars per week. I he college is doing all
it can to spend the money; the student-faculty ratio which used
to be thirty students to one teacher is now thirty teachers to
one student; the Gulf Stream has been purchased for the
Department of Marine Biology; the Dean of Women has been
gold-plated.
But money does not buy happiness, especially in the college
world. Poverty and ivy that is the academic life—not power
and pelf. The I'pper Rhode Island College of Science and
Palmistry is frankly embarrassed bv all wealth, but I am
pleased to report that the trustees are not taking their calamity
lying down, bast week they earmarked all royalties for a crash
research program headed by I >r. Wagstaff Sigafoos to develop
a whisker which is resistant to Reverso, bet us all join in wish
ing the old gentleman success. * ,wo
* ♦ *
The sponsors of this column can't offer you money but they
can offer you fine smoking flavor —irith or without filter. If
you favor filters try a Marlboro. If non-filters are your pleas
ure pick a Philip Morris.

more expensive brands. The reason is simply this: you can pay
more for a cigarette but you can't get a better flavor, a better
smoke, ll' you think flavor went out when filters came in, try
a Marlboro. The filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste. You,
too, can smoke like a millionaire at a cost which does no violence
to the slimmest of budgets. Marlboros come in soft pack or
flip-top box and can be found at any tobacco counter. Million
aires can be found on yachts.
Hut I digress. We were speaking of the royalties from
Reverso which continue to accrue at an astonishing rate- now
in excess of one million dollars per week. I he college is doing all
it can to spend the money; the student-faculty ratio which used
to be thirty students to one teacher is now thirty teachers to
one student; the Gulf Stream has been purchased for the
Department of Marine Biology; the Dean of Women has been
gold-plated.
But money does not buy happiness, especially in the college
world. Poverty and ivy that is the academic life—not power
and pelf. The I'pper Rhode Island College of Science and
Palmistry is frankly embarrassed bv all wealth, but I am
pleased to report that the trustees are not taking their calamity
lying down, bast week they earmarked all royalties for a crash
research program headed by I >r. Wagstaff Sigafoos to develop
a whisker which is resistant to Reverso, bet us all join in wish
ing the old gentleman success. * ,wo

The sponsors of this column can't offer you money but they
can offer you fine smoking flavor —irith or without filter. If
you favor filters try a Marlboro. If non-filters are your pleas
ure pick a Philip Morris.


"AN EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES"
*
Twinklv, lovable old Dr. Wagstaff Rigafoos, head of chemistry
at 11 10 I pper Rhode Island College of Science and Palmistry,
cares naught for glory and wealth. All he cares about is to work
in his laboratory, to play Mo/art quartets with a few cronies,
to smoke a good Marlboro, and to throw sticks for his faithful
dog Trey to fetch.
So when, after years of patient research, Dr. Sigafoos dis
covered Reverso, a shaving cream which causes whiskers to
grow inward instead of outward, thus enabling a man to bite
off his beard instead of shaving it, it never even crossed his
mind that he had come upon a key to fame and riches: he simply
assigned all his royalties from Reverso to the college and went
on with his quiet life of working in the laboratory, playing
Mozart quartets, smoking good Marlboros and throwing sticks
for his faithful dog Trey. (Trev, incidentally, had died some
years earlier but habit is a strong thing and Dr. Sigafoos to
this day continues to throw sticks.) •
As everyone knows, Reverso turned out to be a madly success
ful shaving cream. Royalties in the first month amounted to
.S29O,(MM), which came in mighty handy, believe you me, because
the college had long been postponing some urgently needed
repairs—a lightning rod for the men's dormitory, new hoops for
the basketball court, leather patches for the chess loam's elbows
and a penwiper for the 1 )ireetor of Admissions.

Tn the second month royalties amounted to an even million
dollars and the college bought Marlboro cigarettes for all
students and faculty members. It is interesting that the college
chose Marlboro cigarettes though they could well have afforded
more expensive brands. The reason is simply this: you can pay
more for a cigarette but you can't get a better flavor, a better
smoke, ll' you think flavor went out when filters came in, try
