# Cards Edged by Bears In Home Field Debut
## 
### Russ Allen Sports Editor 
It looks like a lack of hitters
again plagues Stanford baseball
coach Dutch Fehring as his dia
mondmen lost their liome C.1.8.A.
opener to Cal 1-3 at the Sunken
Diamond yesterday. It was the
third*straight loss for the Indians
in league play.
Although the Cards were even
with the arch rivals across the
Bay in the hit department with
six each Stanford hitters failed
to come across with pftat long ball
or clutch drive to break up the
ball game. Sharp pitching by Bear
righthander Jerry Montgomery or
tight Bear defensive plays seemed
to handcuff the Indian hitters at
the crucial moments of the game.
Certainly there were some
bright spots in yesterday's loss
for the Cards. Jim Burk looked
well defensively at third and
started off hitting two sharp
singles and curling 2 for 4 for the
Indians. Right fielder John I lurlbut
made ;i spectacular, goitig-away
catch falling down but coming up
with the ball dri\ en off Cal's Tom
McGarry's bat.

Stanford tallied quickly in the
