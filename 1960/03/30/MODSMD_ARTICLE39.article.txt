relay meet with Hartnell College.
Sheridan Downey won the broad

and won the javelin throw in his
first competition in the event.
John Haynie won the high jump,
and Phil White topped the pole
vaulters, while Chuck Buehler
turned in a good shot put per
formance.
The mile relay should provide

a bat tin, as the Papooses have
several fine quarter-milers, head
ed by Ken Emanuels, whose ;")()■•
seeond 440 led the team to a 3:26.0
relay victory. Emanuels should
do better as he is just recovering

A win over the Spartan frosh,
however, will require all-out per

San Jose freshmen have not been
defealed in over two years.
