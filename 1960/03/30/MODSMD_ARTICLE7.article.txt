### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa i/l'i Quiet returned to the Ne
gro townships around Johannesburg and Cape Town yesterday after
many hours of terror. But militant nonwhites warned of more
trouble unless their demands are met.
On the eve of the opening of the South African case before the

U.N. Security Council in Now
York, Nogro leaders here de
clared they will call a total work
boycott unless the government
abolishes its pass laws forcing
them to carry pa-sses at all times. j
"We have said before and wo
repeat that there can bo no peace
in this country until the demands
of the African nonwhite people
are met." said William Jolobe,
spokesman for the Pan Africanist
Congress.
The rules forcing nonwhites to
show their passes to police were
suspended last weekend following !
a campaign by the Pan-African- i
ist-s. But the government declared ,
the suspension is temporary. The
government has threatened to ar- j
rest anyone burning his passbook,
long a symbol of the Negro's in-!
ferior status in jobs, homes and
political power.
A one-day work boycott Mon
day in mourning for 72 persons
killer! by white police erupted into
violence when the few Negroes
who ignored the stay-home orders
attempted to return from work.
The Negro workers were stoned
and pursued by bands of their
own race. Later the bands went
on fire-setting raids, burning
down a half dozen buildings, in- j
eluding churches.
Meanwhile, the Nationalist gov
ernment of Prime Minister I lend- ]
rik Verwoerd rushed through its
second reading in Parliament a
bill outlawing the PAC and the
larger and more moderate Afri- j
can National Congress.
