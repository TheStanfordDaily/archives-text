Dr. Margaret Mead, noted an
thropologist, author and lecturer,

seum of Natural History, Dr.

tive peoples on some Pacific
Islands south of the equator
while doing research work for
her d o ct orate from Columbia
University.
In the course of time she
learned and used seven of the
island languages. As a National
Research Council follow she
studied adolescent girls in Samoa

of Age in Samoa: A Study of
Primitive Youth for We s t er n
Civilization" was published in
1928. Critics praised the book for
both content and style.
In 1928-29, as a Social Science

her second expedition into the
Pacific Ocean, to study the Mantis
tribe in the Admiralty Islands
north of New Guinea. Her book,

traits, not innate ones.

lectures at Stanford, Columbia,
Vassar and the University of Cal
ifornia. She has also lectured in
