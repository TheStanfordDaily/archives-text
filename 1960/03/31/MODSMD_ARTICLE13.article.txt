# Africa's Suppressed Voice
## 
### 
Ihe recent violence in South Africa culminating in the death
of scores of unlives was indeed shocking.
In the Union of South Africa, the Kuropeans represent only
20 per cent of the population. Negroes, \sians and people of
mixed racial background compose the rest of the nation. And yet
this 80 per eciil has no voice in proportion to its size in selecting
the government and is represented in tin* parliament by hut three
men out of the total 159 seats.
l or the Negroes of the 19th century, ignorant of the ways of
\\ estern man and easilv suhdued hy the weapons ol advanced tech
nology, this situation was feasible; hut as the natives adopted
Kuropean eultnre and hecame skilled in industry, the laws ol the
past eentur\ were no longer aeeeptahle.
Tliev tried peaceful methods to obtain their enfranchisement,
and in this effort were supported h\ many of the whiles ol the
counlr\, hut the descendants of the Dutch sett lers w ho control the
nation realized that lhi> movement threatened their supremacy
and moved to crush these organizations. Ihe leaders were arrested
as foinentors of a C.oininuuist conspiracy and still await trial on
these charges.
Thus the channels for peaceful protest were closed. As the
restrictions grew more oppressive, the natives resisted and staged
demonstrations to dramatize their opposition to government regu
lations which controlled them without their consent. I hose pro
tests were met with the violent repression which caused the recent
uproar.
Defenders of South Africa's actions slate that it was the duly
of the police to maintain order and protect the legal government
of the countrv. I liev oppose our government s protest as an inva
sion into another counlrv s internal aflairs.
However, these arguments seem to he faulty. Anv government
resting on the support of hut 20 per cent of the populace, which
dominates the other 80 per cent of the people while deny ing them
anv political voice, plainly maintains its power hy dictatorial
means. The whiles invaded this territory and have expanded their
conquests into a gigantic slave empire.
The Negroes are now valiantly trying to obtain political and
economic representation in their own country and are being
vieiouslv repulsed. Just as our government protested the Russian
barbarities in Hungary, so we should also denounce the Afri
kaners" action in South Africa.
The attempts of the dictatorial governments of the world,
whether their capitals he in Moscow or Johannesburg, to restrict
the freedom of other people must he opposed hv the democratic
nations if liberty is to he maintained. If America desires to re
main the leader of the democratic forces of the world, we must
continue to protest to the South African government and offer
encouragement to the Negroes in their struggle for freedom.
