### 
Editor's Note: This article,
the second of a two-part series,
looks at the reaction and in
fluence of ttie outside world on
South Africa. The author, an
ASSU Foreign Scholar, is in the
Graduate School of Business
and conies from Cape Town,
South Africa.
II v II illiam Jacobson
Allied in the struggle of English
speaking South Africans against
Ihe Afrikaner Government, is
Groat Britain, who has herself
powerful interests in South Afri
can gold and other industries.
Britain is playing a character
istic double role in Africa. On
the one hand, she pays lip-service
to the aspirations of the African
people and to African nationalism
when she criticises the South Afri
can Government, yet at the same
time she knows that all her in
terests in Africa south of the
equator are dependent upon the
continued existence and control
of the White minorities.
Nationalistic Cries
Thus, for example, she is bol
stering the Federation of the
Rhodesias under Southern Rho
desian white domination, despite
tho nationalistic cries of the
Nyasalander. So, too in South
Afriea.Macmillan is tactfully try
ing to put pressure on the White
electorate, so that control would
shift to a more moderate White
government, with more pro-
British sympathies and economic
affiliations.
It is dubious whether the pup
pet politicians of the new African
states have any genuine interest
in "freedom" in the South. The
"freedom" they talk of is for them
selves, whereas the freedom of
others, in this case the Whites in
the South, they are ready to
throw on the chopping block.
Meek Acquiescence
So too in the United Nations,
the Afro-Asian block, with meek
acquiescence by the United States,
contrary to Article 2(7) of the
Charter, blatantly interferes with
South Africa's internal matters
under the guise of "human rights"
and "international security,"
when not a single one of them can
claim themselves to conform to
the Charter.
Finally, there is the role of Rus
sia and America, which in the
long run, will be most significant
of all. Russia clearly benefits by
playing a waiting game in Africa
and exploiting unrest whenever it
occurs in a pro-Western state
there. Her recent note to South
Africa was her first direct in
tervention in South Africa's in
ternal affairs, and probably landed
where it belongs in the waste
basket.
The United States is once again
upon the horns of a dilemma, al
lowing herself to be tossed around
by mooing calves. On the one
hand, she is trying to build inde
pendant states among African
people who have not so much as
invented a wheel from the neo
lithic to the nuclear age; yet on
the other hand she wants stability
in Africa so that pro-Western
economic and political ties can be
firmly established.

She is achieving neither, Afri
can states, built on a "national
ism" and economic base that is
more West-created than African
nspired, would collapse tomor
row into chaotic tribalism if the
?conomic an d administrative
forces of the West were removed.
This false "independence" will
result in Africa in constant in
stability for the foreseeable fu
ture. Already the splintering of
the Congo and the Rhodosian
Federation are threatened. Rus
sian Communism will exploit
every such unrest to discredit the
West.
Sad Spectacle
To cap it all there is the sad
spectacle of the United States for
saking the only reliable hinge in
Africa between that continent and
the West the settled White com
munities. The United States bla
tant intervention in last w'eek's
domestic unrest in South Africa,
and bowing, in the United Na
tions, to the ambitious Afro-Asian
bloc can only serve to undermine
the security of the White inhabi
tants of South Africa and their
faith in Western friendship. This
may result in a greater deter
mination to follow policies
which will promote their own se
curity which, under the circum
stances, may be more extreme
measures.
White Community
Sixty years ago a tiny White
community in South Africa re
sisted the invasion of the gold
hungry might of the world, Great
Britain. Today we will be prepared
to do the same. For if justice is to
be done in South Africa, it must
be the justice of the people of our
country which must prevail, not
the whims of the avaricious polit
ical and commercial interests
from Britain, America, West Afri
ca, Russia, or the East.
