Playing Ostrich
Kditor, tlx' Daily:
Whether or not Mr. Hoover is
correct in his analysis of what the
goals of the Hoover Institution
should be, he is profoundly l ight
in this regard. No academic insti
tution lacks a moral and an aca
demic foundation and framework
which determine the direction re
search. publication, etc., shall take
what research is intrinsically
worthwhile, what publications are
competent, etc.
Nor is the concept of compe
tence free of moral and intellec
tual valuation. Rather such valua
tion constitutes its substance. Nor
do I mean that this is how things
ought to be, but rather that this
is how things necessarily are. If
anyone doubts it, lot him examine
the whole complex structure of
academic hiring, professional com
mittees, publication boards, etc.
What is in doubt is whether the
implicit goals of an institution are
to be pursued in a responsible and
intelligent manner, or whether the
responsible parties are to shun
their responsibilities by simply
playing ostrich.
Academic freedom, like tolera
tiap, is a symbol hallowed by
ancient and respectful usage and,
like all such symbols, bearing an
overpowering accretion of often
contradictory meaning. The mean
ing we must not attach to it is
that would-be meaning which
finds its spiritual birthplace in
Mill's "Essay on Liberty." I say
would-be meaning, for the "Es
say," while it has a fine style, is
totally lacking in content. The
conception it purports to advance
is a forlorn attempt to reconcile
man's lack of philosophical cor-
