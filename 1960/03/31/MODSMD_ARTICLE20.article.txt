Sometimes i! jtisf doesn't pay I«» j;«'t out of bed. Ask Jim Burk,
the newly elected captain of the Stanford baseball team.
Buik plays third base for the Indians and has power at the
plate such that Coach Dutch Fehring has him hat in the clean-up
spot. He is currently hitting .421, and has three homeruns and 10
runs batted in. However, even Willie Mays has been known to have
unlucky days. The following is about one of Burk's days of mis
fortune on the diamond.
Last Saturday the Tribe was playing UCLA at Joe E. Brown

Field in Los Angeles. Stanford
had lost to the Bruins the day
before and would have liked noth
ing better than to even things up.
The Bruins scored once in the
third inning and managed to
hold on to the lead until the
sixth. Jim came up with one
out and (). J. Solander on first
and promptly slammed the ball
lb feet over the left fielder's
head. If the ball had rolled or
hit the fence (or if there hadn't
been a fence) Burk would have
been good for three bases and
Solander could have scored on
his hands and knees.
As it was, the ball bounced once
and hopped over the left field
fence, 385 feet away. Burk got
a ground rule double and Soland
er was not allowed to score. The
Stanford attack bogged down and
the Tribe only managed to pick
up a run through the grace of
the UCLA pitcher Vein Pritchett
who tried to pick Solander off
third and threw it past the third
baseman. Jim died on third.

In the UCLA half of the sixth Tribe pitcher Marv Mecklenberg
retired Ihe first two batters easily, but then allowed the Bruins
to put men on first and second. The next Uclan hit a sharp
bouncer lo Burk, who hobbled the pill, grabbed it and dived for
the bag to force the runner.
The umpire was way out of position and called the play from
the pitchers mound. Going on (he time-honored philosophy ol
'when in doubt, favor the home team,' friend mnp called the
runner safe, lie scored a moment later to give the Bruins a one
run lead again.
In the eighth Burk was up again with one out and nobody
on. The Bruin pitcher served up two balls and then threw one that
sent Jim scrambling into the dirt. The umpire said that the ball
hit Bulk's bat and called it a strike.
When Jim respectfully tried to point out that the ball had
hit him on the wrist, the ump would have none of it and the cries
from the UCLA dugout were skeptical.
"You've got wooden wrists, maybe?" shouted one tormenter.
Deciding that perhaps discretion was the better part of valor,
Burk abandoned his discussion with the umpire and resumed the
job of trying to get on base. He was confused enough, however,
lo go to first base when the next pitch was called a ball, only to
have to trot ignominiously back to the plate when the umpire and
the Bruin bench gleefully reminded him that it was only ball three.
Burk walked on the next pitch, but advanced no further as the
Indians waited until the ninth frame to tie the score. 2-2.
In then tenth, Burk once again came to the plate and, after a
battle of wits with Pritchett, ■struck out as hard as he could. In
fairness it must be stated that the Bruin hurler was pretty hot
that afternoon and struck out 1-1 Indians overall.
The Bruins pushed a run across in the eleventh to wrap it up,
3-2, and Jim Burk came off the field probably having philosophical
thoughts about IJCI.A, Joe E. Brown Field and bad luck in general!

JIM BURK '
Mr had a rough day
Sometimes i! jtisf doesn't pay I«» j;«'t out of bed. Ask Jim Burk,
the newly elected captain of the Stanford baseball team.
Buik plays third base for the Indians and has power at the
plate such that Coach Dutch Fehring has him hat in the clean-up
spot. He is currently hitting .421, and has three homeruns and 10
runs batted in. However, even Willie Mays has been known to have
unlucky days. The following is about one of Burk's days of mis
fortune on the diamond.
Last Saturday the Tribe was playing UCLA at Joe E. Brown

Field in Los Angeles. Stanford
had lost to the Bruins the day
before and would have liked noth
ing better than to even things up.
The Bruins scored once in the
third inning and managed to
hold on to the lead until the
sixth. Jim came up with one
out and (). J. Solander on first
and promptly slammed the ball
lb feet over the left fielder's
head. If the ball had rolled or
hit the fence (or if there hadn't
been a fence) Burk would have
been good for three bases and
Solander could have scored on
his hands and knees.
As it was, the ball bounced once
and hopped over the left field
fence, 385 feet away. Burk got
a ground rule double and Soland
er was not allowed to score. The
Stanford attack bogged down and
the Tribe only managed to pick
up a run through the grace of
the UCLA pitcher Vein Pritchett
who tried to pick Solander off
third and threw it past the third
baseman. Jim died on third.

In the UCLA half of the sixth Tribe pitcher Marv Mecklenberg
retired Ihe first two batters easily, but then allowed the Bruins
to put men on first and second. The next Uclan hit a sharp
bouncer lo Burk, who hobbled the pill, grabbed it and dived for
the bag to force the runner.
The umpire was way out of position and called the play from
the pitchers mound. Going on (he time-honored philosophy ol
'when in doubt, favor the home team,' friend mnp called the
runner safe, lie scored a moment later to give the Bruins a one
run lead again.
In the eighth Burk was up again with one out and nobody
on. The Bruin pitcher served up two balls and then threw one that
sent Jim scrambling into the dirt. The umpire said that the ball
hit Bulk's bat and called it a strike.
When Jim respectfully tried to point out that the ball had
hit him on the wrist, the ump would have none of it and the cries
from the UCLA dugout were skeptical.
"You've got wooden wrists, maybe?" shouted one tormenter.
Deciding that perhaps discretion was the better part of valor,
Burk abandoned his discussion with the umpire and resumed the
job of trying to get on base. He was confused enough, however,
lo go to first base when the next pitch was called a ball, only to
have to trot ignominiously back to the plate when the umpire and
the Bruin bench gleefully reminded him that it was only ball three.
Burk walked on the next pitch, but advanced no further as the
