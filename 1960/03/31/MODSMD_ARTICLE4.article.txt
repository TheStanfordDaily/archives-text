## Ten Stanford Seniors Among 1,259 Awarded Woodrow Wilson Fellowships 
### 
Exceptional talent for teaching on the college level has been recognized in 10 Stanford seniors
who are among the 1.259 winners of the 1960-61 Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation
awards.
The winners represent 355 universities and colleges in the United States and Canada and were
selected from 8,800 applicants.
Those selected from Stanford are Jean Carter, an anthropology major from Urbana, 111., who is

1 currently working at the Smith
sonian Institute in Washington;
; Roger Dingman. a member of
the History Honors Program
j from Pacific Palisades, Calif., who
will do graduate work in history;
Nancy M. Fiske, a member of the
i Humanities Honors Pr o g ra m
| from Denver; Richard Imus of
I the History Honors Program
from Burlingame, Calif.; James
|R. Kurth also of the History
Honors Program from Corvallis,
Ore.; John S. Lawrence of the
; Philosophy Honors Program from
I Amarillo, Tex.
.More Winners
Gordon H. Lewis of the So
| iology Honors Program from
I Wenatchee, Wash.; Robert E.
Manning of the Economics Honors
Program from San Marino, Calif..
| who will study economics at
M.1.T.; Richard Mosk. a political
J science major from Los Angeles;
land Susan G. Pierce of the Eng
| lish Honors Program from San
j Ansel mo, Calif., who will study

! cliffe.
! The Woodrow Wilson Fellow
ship program was established in
' 191.1 to recruit promising students
! for the college teaching profes
sion and to support them during
! their first year of graduate study.
Faculty Nomination
One unusual feature of the pro
gram is that students may not
apply directly for the award but
I must bo nominated by a faculty
| member. For this reason practi
cally all of the candidates are
| superior students and it is con
j sidered an academic honor just
to be nominated.
Since the foundation can make
1 only about 1,200 awards annually,
J there are a large number of well
i qualified candidates who do not
: receive fellowships. This year
there were 1,203 such candidates,
including ten from Stanford,
given "Honorable Mention."
Honorable Mention
The Stanford students are Fdna
| J. Hall, physics; David C. Hamil
: ton, physics; Mary M. Howard.
English; Doreen M. Hunter, his
j tory; Aletha Huston, psychology;
Frances A. Monson, English; Ed
j ward L. Nordby, Russian; Russell
| T. Scott, classics; Francis .T. Still
man, English; and Elizabeth B.
j Wright, English.
A list of the names of the
j honorable mention students has
been sent to the deans of graduate
j schools in the United States and
Canada. In this way most of them
may receive alternative awards.
It is estimated that 30*000 new
college teachers will be needed
each year during the next decade
to take care of the tidal wave of
college students expected in the
sixties. For this reason the Wood
row Wilson Fellowship Program
i was established.
Foundation statistics show that
eighty per cent of all students
1 nominated for Wilson Fellowships
i eventually enter graduale schools,
I most of them with other financial
I assistance. Thus even nomination
serves to identify outstanding
scholars and make available addi
| tional awards.

Faculty Nomination
One unusual feature of the pro
gram is that students may not
apply directly for the award but
I must bo nominated by a faculty
| member. For this reason practi
cally all of the candidates are
| superior students and it is con
j sidered an academic honor just
to be nominated.
Since the foundation can make
1 only about 1,200 awards annually,
J there are a large number of well
i qualified candidates who do not
: receive fellowships. This year
there were 1,203 such candidates,
including ten from Stanford,
