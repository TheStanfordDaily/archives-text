# S. Africa Invokes Emergency State
## 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (A 1 ) South Africa's government, beset by demonstrations against
its segregation policies, declared a state of emergency yesterday and alerted its citizens defense
force for mobilization.
The orders went out as more than 30,000 Negro demonstrators jamming the streets of Cape
Town, the seat of South Africa's Parliament, emphasized the build-up of racial tension. Scattered

violence flared in the countryside.
With armored cars circling the
Parliament building, police with
rifles guarding live entrances and
street corners and a police heli
copter circling overhead, Prime
Minister Hendrik Vervvoerd de
clared the situation was under
control.
May ( all Army
If 18 regiments of the citizen* j
force now alerted cannot handle |
any disorders, he said, the regular j
army will be called in.
The Cape Town Negroes finally i
dispersed peacefully, but their |
sheer numbers made profound
impressions.
Three million while persons con
trol 10 million Negroes, nearly
half a million Indians and more
than a million coloreds mixed
bloods in this nation, rigidly
segregated according to racial
complexion.
Many Arrested
The dramatic events in Parlia
ment came only a few hours after
police had rounded up some white
liberals and Negro, Indian and col
ored leaders to ward (iff what Ver
voerd described earlier as "a mas
sive revolt." More than 350 were
reported arrested.
They were detained under pro
visions of the Public Safety Act.
Relations between races in this
anxious country probably haven't
been as bad since the Zulu re
bellion of 1879.
Scattered Violence
Scattered violence, threats and
outright intimidation in Capo
province and Johannesburg in
dicated that relations may get
even worse under the emergency
regulations to come.
Meanwhile South Africa's chief
U.N. delegate walked away from
Ihe Security Council table after
warning lhat U.N. debate might
spark new and more widespread
racial turmoil in his country.
Bernard us Gerhardus Fourie,
permanent U.N. representative
for South Africa, told members of
Ihe 11-nation Council that if this
occurs the blame will rest square
ly on their shoulders.
His dramatic gesture did not
amount to an outright boycott. He
seated himself in a row of chairs
at one side of the chamber. A dele
gation spokesman said Fourie was
awaiting instruction from his
government.
Council Debates Request
Fourie was the opening speaker
as the Council began debate on a
request by 29 Asian-African na
tions that it consider the mass
shooting of Negroes in South Afri- ]
ca by white police.
U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge, president of the Council
for March, declared the agenda
adopted without taking a formal
vote.
That assured full-scale debate
with representatives of the Asian-
African group denouncing the
shootings and calling for Council
action aimed at halting additional
violence.
