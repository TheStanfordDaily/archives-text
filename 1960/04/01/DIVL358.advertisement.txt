Corporate life in the living units
Corporate mission in vocation
We are a bit embarrassed by the eggheadish impression that the emphasis
upon study creates. We favor an hour of religious study a week beyond
this we urge worship and the carrying forward of our lite and mission in
the world. We do not really have a "program" we are simply persons who
share in the life of the university on the basis of our experiences together
and on the basis of the record of the community of which we are a part.
