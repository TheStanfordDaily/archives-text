# Soviets Get U.S. Test Ban Plans
## 
### 
GENEVA (A 1 ) The United States and Britain formally sub
mitted their new nuclear test ban formula to the Soviet Union yes
terday.
The Soviet reaction indicated that months of hard bargaining
still lie ahead.
The formula, approved by President Eisenhower and Prime Min-

ister Harold Macmillan at their
Camp David, Md., meeting earlier
this week, was handed to Soviet
Delegate Semyon K. Tsarapkin
at the 191st session of the three
nation conference in Geneva.
'Encouraging Step'
Tsarapkin immediately said the
proposal is "an encouraging step
forward," but leaves too many
questions unanswered.
He told U.S. Ambassador James
iJ. Wadsworth and Britain's Sir
i Michael Wright he will submit
I these questions after the Camp
David proposal has been studied
in Moscow.
The new Western formula calls
for a treaty permanently banning
tests which can be detected at
long range. The three powers
would make a temporary gentle
! men's agreement to refrain from
low-powered underground tests
undetectable by present scienti
fic methods.
Joint Research
In effect the Western offer
officially described as a voluntary
moratorium would suspend all
nuclear tests for a limited period
while British, American and So
viet scientists Conduct joint re
search to expand the range of
detection techniques to cover even
the smallest.
Barely an hour after ho made
the new call for a ban at a Soviet
Embassy reception, Khrushchev
was shaking hands with President
Charles de Gaulle in Rambouillet
ready for more talks.
'Single Conference'
After declaring that an easing
of tensions had made possible the
May summit conference, the tour
ing Soviet Premier added: "It is
certainly impossible to settle all
the problems ready for settlement
in the course of a single summit
conference. That is why it is best
to begin with the most burning
problems and the most important
such as, for example, general and
complete disarmament, the con
clusion of a treaty of peace with
Germany, and ending nuclear
arms tests, if by that time the
needed agreement has not been
reached on that last question."
French Warning
A French warning to aircraft
that an atomic test in the Sahara
can be considered imminent co
incided with Khrushchev's return
to the capital after a six-day tour
of the provinces.
The warning said a test explo
sion could take place anytime
'after 5:45 a.m. â€” 11:45 o'clock
last night EST.
The alert followed a similar
notice Wednesday, which was
called off. The timing led to spec
ulation that for their own reasons
the French were demonstrating
bluntly to Khrushchev that
! France must be treated as an
atomic power.
Whether the French carry out
the test, they have made their
diplomatic point in unmistakable
terms.
