## Clarification Of Hoover Requested 
### Doug Willis 
A heated Legislature debate
last night ended in an 8-7 vote
approving a letter to the Board of
Trustees requesting clarification
of the purposes of the Hoover
Institution and expressing stu
dent concern over the purposes
of the Institution.
A committee consisting of rep
resentative Dave Leeson and Sa
sha Lanz and Daily Editor Steve
Freidberg will draft a letter to the
Board and submit it to Legisla
ture for approval next week.
Freidberg brought the issue to
Legislature's attention. He point
ed out evidence that statements
by Herbert Hoover, founder of
the Institution, have led to con
fusion about the purposes of the
Library.
Freidberg said that Hoover de
clared that the purpose of the
Hoover Institution should be to
expose the evils of socialism, athe
ism, communism and economic
materialism.
Freidberg explained that while
the Board of Trustees has stated
(hat Hoover's goals for Ihe Insti
tution are not necessarily the ones
held by the University, the Trus
tees have not actually told the
purposes of the Institution.
ASSU Business Manager Boh
Best and assistant Ed Cutter ques
tioned whether Legislature had
cause to take any action.
"Just because a man is the
head of an institution, he
shouldn't be prohibited from hav
ing opinions," said Best. "Myself,
I would never think that Hoover's
statement reflected the opinions
of the Board of Trustees."
"But Campbell (W. Glenn
Campbell, new director of Hoover
Institution) has said that he will
make the purpose of Hoover In
stitution the exposure of the evils
of socialism and communism,"
answered Freidberg.
"Have a little faith in the Board
of Trustees," added Cutter. I
think that President Sterling and
the Trustees know a little more
about running the Hoover Insti
tution than we, do."
"Our reputation as a Univer
sity has been hurt," explained
Freidberg. "It may be a matter
of whether we save face for the
University or for Mr. Hoover."
"It seems to me that we are be
ing asked to censor the director
of the Institution," countered
Best.
"A doubt has been raised in
the minds of the student segment
of the academic community, so
let's get it clarified," said Leeson.
In other business Legislature
asked Ralph Dudley to prepare
an essay for its approval outlin
ing legislature's views on mid
terms. Legislature will recom
mend to the faculty that sched
uling of midterms should be
strictly enforced, that optional
midterms be considered for more
courses and that choices between
midterms and papers be con
sidered.
