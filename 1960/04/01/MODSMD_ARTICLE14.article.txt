Editor's Note: The following
are comments given by various
members of the faculty on request
of The Daily about the statements
by Mr. Hoover in Tuesday's Daily
and subsequent articles. Many
other faculty members contacted
expressed similar opinions; how
ever, they felt their comments
would only repeat what has
already been printed.
"It is mildly heartening to read
the final sentences of the Trus
tees' statement, that 'academic
freedom in the highest university
tradition is expected to prevail
throughout Stanford.'
"The fact remains, however,
that the Trustees last May took
an action of which they were
apparently so ashamed that it
was kept secret, even from per
sons in the administration closely
concerned (and of course from
the faculty), for more than six
months. What was the reason or
the propriety in handing Mr.
Hoover veto power over the ap
pointment of a director? He is
the Library's founder, and for
this we are grateful. But is he
its owner? Surely this would sur
prise the scores of dedicated staff
members who have spent much
of their lives building it up.
"The Trustees stated in May
(and the statement still stands)
that they wished to have 'in their
records a statement of the scope,
the importance and the purposes
of the Hoover Institution.' and
that 'to this end' they had Mr.
Hoover write 'for them' the appal
ling document published in Tues
day's Daily.
"Their motive in doing this is
far from clear, if. as they now
say. they 'did not contemplate
that Mr. Hoover's statement
would he interpreted as Univer
sity policy.' This all adds up to
an incredible situation. It is now
known throughout the country,
especially in the East, and we
are being laughed at by just those
persons whose respect we most
need.
"In my view, it is time we
stopped coddling Mr. Hoover. At
the very least, we should see to
it <1> that Mr. Hoover's state
ment of purpose is explicitly re
pudiated, and <2i that an equally
forceful statement, saying in full
what is meant by 'academic free
dom in the highest university tra
dition,' is drawn up and adopted.
If we can do this we may still
retrieve a measure of Stanford's
honor."
David S. Nivison
Associate Professor of
Chinese and Philosophy
"I can understand that the Uni
versity might wish to place some
where in its archives a statement
of Mr. Hoover's views on the
purposes of the Hoover Institu

tion. But for the Trustees to in
corporate Mr. Hoover's statement
into the record of their own pro
ceedings is, however unwittingly,
to convey the impression that
Stanford University has turned
its back on tho principles of aca
demic freedom. Surely this im
pression must be corrected if
Stanford is to maintain its hard-1
earned prestige in the academic
world."
Hubert Marshall
Associate Professor of
Political Science
"As a member of the faculty, I
am confident that the Board of
Trustees believes in academic free
dom ; otherwise I would not J
choose to be at Stanford.
"However, because I believe
that the measure of a university
is its faculty, the recent develop
ments concerning the Hoover In
stitution disturb me on two
counts: 1) There have been steps
to remove ihe Hoover Institution
and its collection (which is a
priceless tool for scholarship)
from normal cognizance of the
faculty which is, after all, the
fountainhead of scholarship in
the University. While separat
ing the Hoover Institution from
the properâ€”and in some cases
austerely budgeted -channels of
scholarship in the University, the
University guarantees financial
support for the Hoover Institu
tion from its precious general
funds.
"Stanford has an opportunity
to mature into a truly great uni
versity. We must not jeopardize
that opportunity by retaining pol
icies such as these which will
hamper 112 u r t her efforts to
strengthen the faculty."
(ieorge Pake
Professor of Physics
"Our society has grown great
because its institutions of govern
ment and of education have been
dedicated to the illimitable free
dom of the human mind to pur
sue truth in all fields of endeavor.
I think it is ironical that a man
who has spent a long and distin
guished career in crusading for
the system of free enterprise
j should repudiate that most basic
liberty of all free inquiry. The
effort to rivet the work of the
Hoover Institution to any partic
; ular system of government or
social organization would violate
the fundamental principles of,
and justification for, a university
devoted to the pursuit of knowl
edge. I anticipate that President
j Sterling and the Board of Trus-
I tes will reaffirm Stanford's tra
ditional policies of freedom of in
quiry in all departments of the
University including the Hoover
Institution."

Professor of History
