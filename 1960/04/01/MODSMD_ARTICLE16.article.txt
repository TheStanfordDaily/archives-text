There is now a good chance
that a treaty and a voluntary
agreement prohibiting n u c 1 e a r
tests will be ready for signature
at the summit meeting in May.
Some specific points have still to
be negotiated. But on the main
issues there is no longer any im
portant disagreement.
About ten days ago the Soviet
government accepted, with one
condition, ihe proposal made last
month by the President. It agreed
'that the treaty should cover only
test explosions which can be mon
itored. This means all the ex
plosions which pollute the air.
The condition attached to this
acceptance of the Eisenhower
proposal is that for a period of
years, perhaps four or five,
these shall be a voluntary
agreement not to make small
underground test explosions
which are not yet prohibited by
treaty. During this moratorium
there would be, as the President
first proposed, joint scientific
studies to improve the existing
monitoring devices.
The President is ready 1o ac
cept the principle of this mora
torium. But for obvious consti
tutional reasons he is not able to
agree to the four or five year
moratorium which the Russians
want. He has no legal power to
bind his successor, and ihe most
that lie can do is to obtain prom
ises to maintain a shorter mora
torium from Mr. Nixon and the
leading Democratic candidate.
This ought to satisfy Mr. Khru
shchev. For if the joint studies
are carried out with energy and
sincerity, there will be no serious
doubt that the moratorium will
be extended further.
Even if a treaty is signed at
the summit in May the Senate
will not be able to act on it in
this session. It will lie over until
next winter, and this means thai
all Ihe candidates for Federal of
fice will have to take a stand on
it during the election campaign.
In all likelihood, barring unfore
seen developments, the treaty will
be popular, for the risks are very
small, and the gain may be very
great.
What are the risks? There is
no risk at all that the big ex
plosions prohibited by treaty
could be carried out in secret.
The treaty itself provides for a
network of monitoring stations.
But even more important, so it
seems to me, is the fact that
we are now capable by our own
instruments, of detecting the
kind of explosion which the
treaty would prohibit. We are
able, so to speak, to monitor the
monitors, to check and to double
check.
What about the smaller under
ground explosions which would

not be prohibited by the treaty
but which would be subject to a
■;hort moratorium? Theoretically,
since by definition they cannot be
detected by existing instruments,
the Soviets may during the past
year have been conducting such
underground tests. But no one
thinks Ihe Soviet Union has rlone
this.
Why? Leaving out all consid
erations of good faith, sneak tests
would be very dangerous. For
while the scientists agree that the
smaller explosions underground
cannot surely be distinguished
from earthquakes, it is also true
that they cannot surely be con
cealed. The penally for cheating
would be enormous.
What is more, for the Soviet
Union the advantages from
cheating would be unimportant.
For the Soviet Union has no big
military interest in perfecting
the smaller nuclear weapons.
She has big rockets to carry big
weapons, and a massive reserve
of infantry for conventional
war fa re.
For the United States the pro
hibition of small test explosions
is a concession. It probably means
that we shall not be able to per
fect beyond their present state
the smaller nuclear weapons. Con
gress, no doubt, will study this
thoroughly. But so far as I can
make out, there are plenty of
fully informed and responsible
people in the government who
think that our arsenal of weapons
is already very good indeed, and
that military perfectionism is not
a national necessity.
The advantages of the treaty
and an agreement can be meas
ured only by what would happen
if they failed. If, having come so
near to an agreement, the three
nuclear powers quarrel, the race
in nuclear weapons will not only
be resumed but it will be ex
panded. If we three, who have
nuclear weapons, cannot agree to
limit them, then all other powers
which wish to count in world af
fairs must make or must buy nu
clear weapons.
The critical country here is
not France or West Germany.
The critical country is China.
For it has, what Britain, France,
and Germany do not have, the
basic characteristic of a true
nuclear power. This is to have
so large a territory that it can
hope to survive an attack.
If we look ahead, if we take
account of the great balance of
world foi'ces, we must think it
would be a disastrous folly not to
become aligned with the Soviet
Union, when there is a chance to
do so, against the spread of nu
clear weapons.
