A horrible plague which has
long been un d e r m in in g the
strength of American higher edu
cation is finally being challenged
in a fight-to t he-death baltle on
the nation's campuses.
This plague recently reared its
ugly head at the University of
Southern California where Dr.
William S. Snyder, assistant pro
fessor of philosophy, resigned
from SC because tlie University
. . promotes professors on a
basis of publication rather than
teaching."
Not 100 long ago, UCLA
asked a highly popular instruc
tor to leave because he refused
to publish 1o the extent the
University wished him 10. The
instructor claimed that he was
finding it difficult to (each,
which is what he really desired
(o do.
As Snyder says,"I regard my
self primarily as a teacher and
secondly as a scholar. I do regard
myself as having definite schol
arly responsibilities, but my. pri
mary duty and my primary re
sponsibility are to my students,
both within the classroom and
outside the classroom."
"A university . . . has a re
sponsibility to its students and
to its community to have all kinds
of men research scholars, teach
ers, lecturers, television person
alities and others on its faculty,"
he said.
"However, willi the presenl
policy of the university, at least
as it has been outlined lo me
. . . the only consideration for
the promotion from assistant
lo associate professor is publi
cation," lie continued.
Snyder spoke out in defiance
of SC's policy: "Teaching includes
making oneself available to fid
fill the total academic needs of
the students wherever and when
ever they appear," he said.
"I regard myself in this sense
as primarily a teacher and I will
make myself available to the stu
dents for any academic use lo
which they wish to put me- in
their organizations, in their ac
tivities, in the classroom, in office
hours and in every other area
that they ask me," he asserted.
Snyder, who will start to in

struct at San Diego State College
in the summer, stated thai he
recalled in some Faculty Senate
minutes of a few years back that
there are li-sted three standards
to be considered in promotions:
(1) Contributions to one's
fields of scholarly endeavor.
i2> One's general teaching
ability.
(3) Contributions to the total
life of the university and the com
munity.
"At NC the last two factors
are completely ignored," Sny
der said. "In this circumstance,
I can only say that I feel the
ultimate outcome of the policy
would he considerable harm to
the university in the eyes of
the students and in the eyes of
the community."
In an editorial entitled "Publish
or Perish?" SC's newspaper, The
Daily Trojan, states: "Adminis
trators, seeking some form of a
quantitative method by which to
hire and promote faculty mem
bers, find it (i.e. publishing) per
fect for their needs and easily
adaptable to their system."
"It is a simple guide to use
—the professor who publishes
extensively is better than a pro
fessor who doesn't publish at
all. And its application is even
easier—the professor who has
a long list of publication credits
to his name is hired or pro
moted and the professor who
has published few articles is
dropped or denied promotion,"
the editorial somewhat sarcas
tically notes.
"As in so many other instances
in our society, quantity is con
sidered above quality and an im
pressively long publication list
determines the value of a teacher
to a university," the editorial
states.
"Publish or Perish" concludes
by saying that "whatever the
answer are, whatever solution
seems best suited to our needs,
any adaptation of publish or per
ish in the academic environment
is a problem which must be faced
and analyzed by anyone who is
interested in the future of this
university."
That yiw's for other universi

A horrible plague which has
long been un d e r m in in g the
strength of American higher edu
cation is finally being challenged
in a fight-to t he-death baltle on
the nation's campuses.
This plague recently reared its
ugly head at the University of
Southern California where Dr.
William S. Snyder, assistant pro
fessor of philosophy, resigned
from SC because tlie University
. . promotes professors on a
basis of publication rather than
teaching."
Not 100 long ago, UCLA
asked a highly popular instruc
tor to leave because he refused
to publish 1o the extent the
University wished him 10. The
instructor claimed that he was
finding it difficult to (each,
which is what he really desired
(o do.
As Snyder says,"I regard my
self primarily as a teacher and
secondly as a scholar. I do regard
myself as having definite schol
arly responsibilities, but my. pri
mary duty and my primary re
sponsibility are to my students,
both within the classroom and
outside the classroom."
"A university . . . has a re
sponsibility to its students and
to its community to have all kinds
of men research scholars, teach
ers, lecturers, television person
alities and others on its faculty,"
he said.
"However, willi the presenl
policy of the university, at least
as it has been outlined lo me
. . . the only consideration for
the promotion from assistant
lo associate professor is publi
cation," lie continued.
Snyder spoke out in defiance
of SC's policy: "Teaching includes
making oneself available to fid
fill the total academic needs of
the students wherever and when
ever they appear," he said.
"I regard myself in this sense
as primarily a teacher and I will
make myself available to the stu
dents for any academic use lo
which they wish to put me- in
their organizations, in their ac
tivities, in the classroom, in office
hours and in every other area
that they ask me," he asserted.
Snyder, who will start to in

struct at San Diego State College
in the summer, stated thai he
recalled in some Faculty Senate
minutes of a few years back that
there are li-sted three standards
to be considered in promotions:
(1) Contributions to one's
fields of scholarly endeavor.
i2> One's general teaching
ability.
(3) Contributions to the total
life of the university and the com
munity.
"At NC the last two factors
are completely ignored," Sny
der said. "In this circumstance,
I can only say that I feel the
ultimate outcome of the policy
would he considerable harm to
the university in the eyes of
the students and in the eyes of
the community."
In an editorial entitled "Publish
or Perish?" SC's newspaper, The
Daily Trojan, states: "Adminis
trators, seeking some form of a
quantitative method by which to
hire and promote faculty mem
bers, find it (i.e. publishing) per
fect for their needs and easily
adaptable to their system."
"It is a simple guide to use
—the professor who publishes
extensively is better than a pro
fessor who doesn't publish at
all. And its application is even
easier—the professor who has
a long list of publication credits
to his name is hired or pro
moted and the professor who
has published few articles is
dropped or denied promotion,"
the editorial somewhat sarcas

trators, seeking some form of a
quantitative method by which to
hire and promote faculty mem
bers, find it (i.e. publishing) per
fect for their needs and easily
adaptable to their system."
"It is a simple guide to use
—the professor who publishes
extensively is better than a pro
fessor who doesn't publish at
all. And its application is even
easier—the professor who has
a long list of publication credits
to his name is hired or pro
moted and the professor who
has published few articles is
dropped or denied promotion,"
the editorial somewhat sarcas
tically notes.
"As in so many other instances
in our society, quantity is con
sidered above quality and an im
pressively long publication list
determines the value of a teacher
to a university," the editorial
states.
"Publish or Perish" concludes
by saying that "whatever the
answer are, whatever solution
seems best suited to our needs,
any adaptation of publish or per
ish in the academic environment
is a problem which must be faced
and analyzed by anyone who is
interested in the future of this
university."
