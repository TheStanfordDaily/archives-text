Lack of Integrity
Editor, the Daily:
The most disappointing aspect
of the Trustees' attempt to deal
with the problem of public opin
ion in Ihe Hoover crisis is their
lack of integrity in dealing with
Mr. Hoover himself. "The Trus
tees did not contemplate that Mr.
Hoover's statements would be in
terpreted as university policy or
as an abridgement of free in
quiry."
How else can the statement be
interpreted, particularly since Mr.
Hoover is in a position to take ac
tion on his beliefs? Paragraph 7
of the constitution states that
"The Director of the Institution
shall be recommended to the
Board of Trustees (and) ... he
shall have been previously ap
proveed by Mr. Hoover."
West ley Campbell, the present
Director, has been approved by
Mr. Hoover, and his views ap
parently coincide with Mr. Hoov
er's on the issue of prosecuting
the evils of Socialism. Marxism,
etc. Mr. Campbell has also myste
riously failed to gain academic
tenure possibly an indication
from the academic community
Mr. Cambell is in a position to
"abridge free inquiry" and that,
as an ideological companion of
Mr. Hoover, he is not welcome.
The Trustees are content to
publicly repudiate Mr. Hoover's
statement of principles while at
the same time allowing Mr. Hoov
er to administrate the Institution
in whatever way he sees fit.
I (Didn't they approve of Mr.
Campbell when Mr. Hoover rec
ommended him?) The Trustees'
statement is an insult to Mr.
Hoover as well as to the intelli
gence of those for whom it was
intended .

Ldilor, the Daily:
First, permit me to congratu
late you for today's editorial con
cerning the South Africa situa
tion. I believe that you appreciate
fully the simple but vested in
terests of the South African na
, lives who are merely seeking to
enjoy their inherent birthright,
j Africa, the land Of their birth
1 and the land of their fathers.
Secondly, I should like to ex
-1 press my opinion of Mr. William
Jacobson and his article written
in today's issue of The Daily. Mr.
Jacobson's theme seems to be that
: freedom of the individual is de
pendent on his "investiveness."
While I would not hesitate to join
issue with him on this score, suf
fice it to say that if he means to
convey the thought that the Afri
cans have made no contribution
to the development of modern day
civilization then, one must say
1 that Mr. Jacobson is demonstrat
ing a very frightening ignorance
of the history of the African
peoples and of mankind in gen
eral. Mr. Jacobson impresses me
as being one of those stupid, un
realistic bigots who is obsessed
with a false notion that the world

is here solely for the white man's
benefit.
Whal Africans are seeking to
day is not so new in the history
of mankind that a cursory review
of history could not reveal. His
tory is replete with examples of
people who have fled from their
homes seeking liberty and self
determination in strange lands.
Africa happens to be one of those
places where the white man has
>ought refuge from oppression of
one kind or another. The ironical
part about all of this is that in
every instance where ihe Afri
cans have extender! him a wel
come to their continent, he has
repaid this gesture of friendship
and hospitality by cunningly and
maliciously enslaving his unwary
hosts.
I wonder what would be Mr.
Jacobson's reaction if he should
awaken one morning in Cape
Town to suddenly find that he
and his friends were under the
domination of some foreign
peoples who claim their right to
enslave and exploit them because
they, his conquerors, had "in
vented" the first satellite to re
volve in space? (Very inventive,
wouldn't you say. Mr. Jacobson?)
Come now, Mr. Jacobson, let lis
have something better the next
time. The American college stu
dent might be ignorant of the ex
isting political facts of other parts
of the world (and I doubt this),
but don't underestimate them
otherwise.

Editor, the Daily:
On reading the article by Wil
liam Jacobson on the recent riots
in South Africa, one is tempted to
class him as just another White
apologist for the doings of his
government. Th is conclusion
would do Mr. Jacobson a grave
injustice, for He presents the
point of view of a few liberals in
his country well meaning, albeit
a little confused.
"Whether the police used means
in excess of the needs of public
order," is for Mr. Jacobson, "im
possible to resolve. . ." and well it
might be from the confines of
Stanford. However, one cannot
help but feel that the "opportun
ist" politicians in Washington,
London, Accra, etc., are, happily,
better informed through agents
and embassies than Mr. Jacobson.
Also, having -seen photographs
of the South African police in
the past, I am tempted to give the
benefit of the doubt to the "op
portunists."
Be that as it may, Mr. Jacobson
is wrong if he feels that the basis
of the protests made is this per
haps overzealous policing (to use

the kindest euphemism possible I.
In the case of Hungary, for ex
ample, the' White South African
would not have been considered
an "opportunist" for criticizing
the USSR. Whal is being criti
cized by the world is, in effect,
that policy which forces the ma
jority of South Africans into
"openly defying the laws of the
country" in order to obtain basic
human rights.
Much has been said by South
African Whites as to how Apart
heid is, ideally, a policy of "Sep
arate but Equal." Those propon
ents of this view support their
case by arguments which are, at
best, academically d e b a t a b 1 e .
However loath the South African
Whites like Mr. Jacobson might
be to admit ihe implications of a
Herrenras.se doctrine in the poli
cies of their government, 1 have
yet to meet one who can give an
alternative explanation of why
black-white miscegenation is il
legal in their country.
In ending, I can only hope that
many in South Africa will soon
realize that the strongest forces
operating in Africa today are
those of the so-called "Black na
tionalism" and Arab nationalism,
not Afrikaner nationalism as Mr.
Jacobson believes in his isolation.
Is it possible that only inter
necine rascist slaughter in Africa
can bring the Whiles who have
chosen the continent as their
home face to face with this basic
truth?

liam Jacobson on the recent riots
in South Africa, one is tempted to
class him as just another White
apologist for the doings of his
government. Th is conclusion
would do Mr. Jacobson a grave
injustice, for He presents the
point of view of a few liberals in
his country well meaning, albeit
a little confused.
"Whether the police used means
in excess of the needs of public
order," is for Mr. Jacobson, "im
possible to resolve. . ." and well it
might be from the confines of
Stanford. However, one cannot
help but feel that the "opportun
ist" politicians in Washington,
London, Accra, etc., are, happily,
better informed through agents
and embassies than Mr. Jacobson.
Also, having -seen photographs
of the South African police in
the past, I am tempted to give the
benefit of the doubt to the "op
portunists."
Be that as it may, Mr. Jacobson
is wrong if he feels that the basis
of the protests made is this per
haps overzealous policing (to use

the kindest euphemism possible I.
In the case of Hungary, for ex
ample, the' White South African
would not have been considered
an "opportunist" for criticizing
the USSR. Whal is being criti
cized by the world is, in effect,
that policy which forces the ma
jority of South Africans into
"openly defying the laws of the
country" in order to obtain basic
human rights.
Much has been said by South
African Whites as to how Apart
heid is, ideally, a policy of "Sep
arate but Equal." Those propon
ents of this view support their
case by arguments which are, at
best, academically d e b a t a b 1 e .
However loath the South African
Whites like Mr. Jacobson might
be to admit ihe implications of a
Herrenras.se doctrine in the poli
cies of their government, 1 have
yet to meet one who can give an
alternative explanation of why
black-white miscegenation is il
legal in their country.
In ending, I can only hope that
many in South Africa will soon
realize that the strongest forces
operating in Africa today are
those of the so-called "Black na
tionalism" and Arab nationalism,
not Afrikaner nationalism as Mr.
Jacobson believes in his isolation.
Is it possible that only inter
necine rascist slaughter in Africa
can bring the Whiles who have
chosen the continent as their
home face to face with this basic
truth?

Editor, the Daily:
The most disappointing aspect
of the Trustees' attempt to deal
with the problem of public opin
ion in Ihe Hoover crisis is their
lack of integrity in dealing with
Mr. Hoover himself. "The Trus
tees did not contemplate that Mr.
Hoover's statements would be in
terpreted as university policy or
as an abridgement of free in
quiry."
How else can the statement be
interpreted, particularly since Mr.
Hoover is in a position to take ac
tion on his beliefs? Paragraph 7
of the constitution states that
"The Director of the Institution
shall be recommended to the
Board of Trustees (and) ... he
shall have been previously ap
proveed by Mr. Hoover."
West ley Campbell, the present
Director, has been approved by
Mr. Hoover, and his views ap
parently coincide with Mr. Hoov
er's on the issue of prosecuting
the evils of Socialism. Marxism,
etc. Mr. Campbell has also myste
riously failed to gain academic
tenure possibly an indication
from the academic community
Mr. Cambell is in a position to
"abridge free inquiry" and that,
as an ideological companion of
Mr. Hoover, he is not welcome.
The Trustees are content to
publicly repudiate Mr. Hoover's
statement of principles while at
the same time allowing Mr. Hoov
er to administrate the Institution
in whatever way he sees fit.
I (Didn't they approve of Mr.
Campbell when Mr. Hoover rec
ommended him?) The Trustees'
statement is an insult to Mr.
Hoover as well as to the intelli
gence of those for whom it was

First, permit me to congratu
late you for today's editorial con
cerning the South Africa situa
tion. I believe that you appreciate
fully the simple but vested in
terests of the South African na
, lives who are merely seeking to
enjoy their inherent birthright,
j Africa, the land Of their birth
1 and the land of their fathers.
Secondly, I should like to ex
-1 press my opinion of Mr. William
Jacobson and his article written
in today's issue of The Daily. Mr.
Jacobson's theme seems to be that
: freedom of the individual is de
pendent on his "investiveness."
While I would not hesitate to join
issue with him on this score, suf
fice it to say that if he means to
convey the thought that the Afri
cans have made no contribution
to the development of modern day
civilization then, one must say
1 that Mr. Jacobson is demonstrat
ing a very frightening ignorance
of the history of the African
peoples and of mankind in gen
eral. Mr. Jacobson impresses me
as being one of those stupid, un
realistic bigots who is obsessed
with a false notion that the world

is here solely for the white man's
benefit.
Whal Africans are seeking to
day is not so new in the history
of mankind that a cursory review
of history could not reveal. His
tory is replete with examples of
people who have fled from their
homes seeking liberty and self
determination in strange lands.
Africa happens to be one of those
places where the white man has
>ought refuge from oppression of
one kind or another. The ironical
part about all of this is that in
every instance where ihe Afri
cans have extender! him a wel
come to their continent, he has
repaid this gesture of friendship
and hospitality by cunningly and
maliciously enslaving his unwary
hosts.
I wonder what would be Mr.
Jacobson's reaction if he should
awaken one morning in Cape
Town to suddenly find that he
and his friends were under the
domination of some foreign
peoples who claim their right to
enslave and exploit them because
they, his conquerors, had "in
vented" the first satellite to re
volve in space? (Very inventive,
wouldn't you say. Mr. Jacobson?)
Come now, Mr. Jacobson, let lis
have something better the next
time. The American college stu
dent might be ignorant of the ex
isting political facts of other parts
of the world (and I doubt this),
but don't underestimate them
otherwise.

tion. I believe that you appreciate
fully the simple but vested in
terests of the South African na
, lives who are merely seeking to
enjoy their inherent birthright,
j Africa, the land Of their birth
1 and the land of their fathers.
Secondly, I should like to ex
-1 press my opinion of Mr. William
Jacobson and his article written
in today's issue of The Daily. Mr.
Jacobson's theme seems to be that
: freedom of the individual is de
pendent on his "investiveness."
While I would not hesitate to join
issue with him on this score, suf
fice it to say that if he means to
convey the thought that the Afri
cans have made no contribution
to the development of modern day
civilization then, one must say
1 that Mr. Jacobson is demonstrat
ing a very frightening ignorance
of the history of the African
peoples and of mankind in gen
eral. Mr. Jacobson impresses me
as being one of those stupid, un
realistic bigots who is obsessed
with a false notion that the world

is here solely for the white man's
benefit.
Whal Africans are seeking to
day is not so new in the history
of mankind that a cursory review
of history could not reveal. His
tory is replete with examples of
people who have fled from their
homes seeking liberty and self
determination in strange lands.
Africa happens to be one of those
places where the white man has
>ought refuge from oppression of
one kind or another. The ironical
part about all of this is that in
every instance where ihe Afri
cans have extender! him a wel
come to their continent, he has
repaid this gesture of friendship
and hospitality by cunningly and
maliciously enslaving his unwary
hosts.
I wonder what would be Mr.
Jacobson's reaction if he should
awaken one morning in Cape
Town to suddenly find that he
and his friends were under the
domination of some foreign
peoples who claim their right to
enslave and exploit them because
they, his conquerors, had "in
vented" the first satellite to re
volve in space? (Very inventive,
wouldn't you say. Mr. Jacobson?)
Come now, Mr. Jacobson, let lis
have something better the next
time. The American college stu
dent might be ignorant of the ex
isting political facts of other parts
of the world (and I doubt this),
but don't underestimate them
otherwise.

On reading the article by Wil
liam Jacobson on the recent riots
in South Africa, one is tempted to
class him as just another White
apologist for the doings of his
government. Th is conclusion
would do Mr. Jacobson a grave
injustice, for He presents the
point of view of a few liberals in
his country well meaning, albeit
a little confused.
"Whether the police used means
in excess of the needs of public
order," is for Mr. Jacobson, "im
possible to resolve. . ." and well it
might be from the confines of
Stanford. However, one cannot
help but feel that the "opportun
ist" politicians in Washington,
London, Accra, etc., are, happily,
better informed through agents
and embassies than Mr. Jacobson.
Also, having -seen photographs
of the South African police in
the past, I am tempted to give the
benefit of the doubt to the "op
portunists."
Be that as it may, Mr. Jacobson
is wrong if he feels that the basis
of the protests made is this per
haps overzealous policing (to use

the kindest euphemism possible I.
In the case of Hungary, for ex
ample, the' White South African
would not have been considered
an "opportunist" for criticizing
the USSR. Whal is being criti
cized by the world is, in effect,
that policy which forces the ma
jority of South Africans into
"openly defying the laws of the
country" in order to obtain basic
human rights.
Much has been said by South
African Whites as to how Apart
heid is, ideally, a policy of "Sep
arate but Equal." Those propon
ents of this view support their
case by arguments which are, at
best, academically d e b a t a b 1 e .
However loath the South African
Whites like Mr. Jacobson might
be to admit ihe implications of a
Herrenras.se doctrine in the poli
cies of their government, 1 have
yet to meet one who can give an
alternative explanation of why
black-white miscegenation is il
legal in their country.
In ending, I can only hope that
many in South Africa will soon
realize that the strongest forces
operating in Africa today are
those of the so-called "Black na
tionalism" and Arab nationalism,
not Afrikaner nationalism as Mr.
Jacobson believes in his isolation.
Is it possible that only inter
necine rascist slaughter in Africa
can bring the Whiles who have
chosen the continent as their
home face to face with this basic
truth?

The most disappointing aspect
of the Trustees' attempt to deal
with the problem of public opin
ion in Ihe Hoover crisis is their
lack of integrity in dealing with
Mr. Hoover himself. "The Trus
tees did not contemplate that Mr.
Hoover's statements would be in
terpreted as university policy or
as an abridgement of free in
quiry."
How else can the statement be
interpreted, particularly since Mr.
Hoover is in a position to take ac
tion on his beliefs? Paragraph 7
of the constitution states that
"The Director of the Institution
shall be recommended to the
Board of Trustees (and) ... he
shall have been previously ap
proveed by Mr. Hoover."
West ley Campbell, the present
Director, has been approved by
Mr. Hoover, and his views ap
parently coincide with Mr. Hoov
er's on the issue of prosecuting
the evils of Socialism. Marxism,
etc. Mr. Campbell has also myste
riously failed to gain academic
tenure possibly an indication
from the academic community
Mr. Cambell is in a position to
"abridge free inquiry" and that,
as an ideological companion of
Mr. Hoover, he is not welcome.
The Trustees are content to
publicly repudiate Mr. Hoover's
statement of principles while at
the same time allowing Mr. Hoov
er to administrate the Institution
in whatever way he sees fit.
I (Didn't they approve of Mr.

ommended him?) The Trustees'
statement is an insult to Mr.
Hoover as well as to the intelli
gence of those for whom it was
intended .

be to admit ihe implications of a
Herrenras.se doctrine in the poli
cies of their government, 1 have
yet to meet one who can give an
alternative explanation of why
black-white miscegenation is il
legal in their country.
In ending, I can only hope that
many in South Africa will soon
realize that the strongest forces
operating in Africa today are
those of the so-called "Black na
tionalism" and Arab nationalism,
not Afrikaner nationalism as Mr.
Jacobson believes in his isolation.
Is it possible that only inter

can bring the Whiles who have
chosen the continent as their
home face to face with this basic
truth?

Lack of Integrity
Editor, the Daily:
The most disappointing aspect
of the Trustees' attempt to deal
with the problem of public opin
ion in Ihe Hoover crisis is their
lack of integrity in dealing with
Mr. Hoover himself. "The Trus
tees did not contemplate that Mr.
Hoover's statements would be in
terpreted as university policy or
as an abridgement of free in
quiry."
How else can the statement be
interpreted, particularly since Mr.
Hoover is in a position to take ac
tion on his beliefs? Paragraph 7
of the constitution states that
"The Director of the Institution
shall be recommended to the
Board of Trustees (and) ... he
shall have been previously ap
proveed by Mr. Hoover."
West ley Campbell, the present
Director, has been approved by
Mr. Hoover, and his views ap
parently coincide with Mr. Hoov
er's on the issue of prosecuting
the evils of Socialism. Marxism,
etc. Mr. Campbell has also myste
riously failed to gain academic
tenure possibly an indication
from the academic community
Mr. Cambell is in a position to
"abridge free inquiry" and that,
as an ideological companion of
Mr. Hoover, he is not welcome.
The Trustees are content to
publicly repudiate Mr. Hoover's
statement of principles while at
the same time allowing Mr. Hoov
er to administrate the Institution
in whatever way he sees fit.
I (Didn't they approve of Mr.
Campbell when Mr. Hoover rec
ommended him?) The Trustees'
statement is an insult to Mr.
Hoover as well as to the intelli
gence of those for whom it was
intended .

First, permit me to congratu
late you for today's editorial con
cerning the South Africa situa
tion. I believe that you appreciate
fully the simple but vested in
terests of the South African na
, lives who are merely seeking to
enjoy their inherent birthright,
j Africa, the land Of their birth
1 and the land of their fathers.
Secondly, I should like to ex
-1 press my opinion of Mr. William
Jacobson and his article written
in today's issue of The Daily. Mr.
Jacobson's theme seems to be that
: freedom of the individual is de
pendent on his "investiveness."
While I would not hesitate to join
issue with him on this score, suf
fice it to say that if he means to
convey the thought that the Afri
cans have made no contribution
to the development of modern day
civilization then, one must say
1 that Mr. Jacobson is demonstrat
ing a very frightening ignorance
of the history of the African
peoples and of mankind in gen
eral. Mr. Jacobson impresses me
as being one of those stupid, un
realistic bigots who is obsessed
with a false notion that the world

is here solely for the white man's
benefit.
Whal Africans are seeking to
day is not so new in the history
of mankind that a cursory review
of history could not reveal. His
tory is replete with examples of
people who have fled from their
homes seeking liberty and self
determination in strange lands.
Africa happens to be one of those
places where the white man has
>ought refuge from oppression of
one kind or another. The ironical
part about all of this is that in
every instance where ihe Afri
cans have extender! him a wel
come to their continent, he has
repaid this gesture of friendship
and hospitality by cunningly and
maliciously enslaving his unwary
hosts.
I wonder what would be Mr.
Jacobson's reaction if he should
awaken one morning in Cape
Town to suddenly find that he
and his friends were under the
domination of some foreign
peoples who claim their right to
enslave and exploit them because
they, his conquerors, had "in
vented" the first satellite to re
volve in space? (Very inventive,
wouldn't you say. Mr. Jacobson?)
Come now, Mr. Jacobson, let lis
have something better the next
time. The American college stu
dent might be ignorant of the ex
isting political facts of other parts
of the world (and I doubt this),
but don't underestimate them
otherwise.

On reading the article by Wil
liam Jacobson on the recent riots
in South Africa, one is tempted to
class him as just another White
apologist for the doings of his
government. Th is conclusion
would do Mr. Jacobson a grave
injustice, for He presents the
point of view of a few liberals in
his country well meaning, albeit
a little confused.
"Whether the police used means
in excess of the needs of public
order," is for Mr. Jacobson, "im
possible to resolve. . ." and well it
might be from the confines of
Stanford. However, one cannot
help but feel that the "opportun
ist" politicians in Washington,
London, Accra, etc., are, happily,
better informed through agents
and embassies than Mr. Jacobson.
Also, having -seen photographs
of the South African police in
the past, I am tempted to give the
benefit of the doubt to the "op
portunists."
Be that as it may, Mr. Jacobson
is wrong if he feels that the basis
of the protests made is this per
haps overzealous policing (to use

the kindest euphemism possible I.

cized by the world is, in effect,
that policy which forces the ma
jority of South Africans into
"openly defying the laws of the
country" in order to obtain basic
human rights.
Much has been said by South
African Whites as to how Apart
heid is, ideally, a policy of "Sep

case by arguments which are, at
