# Student Guides Play Pied Piper
## 
### Sherry Welch 
Groups of high school or gram
mar school students seem forever
lo be trailing through the Human
ities Room goggle-eyed, filing out
past the fountain and wending
their way across Quad to stand in
clusters gazing upward at the
mosaic on the front of Memorial
Church.
Leading each of these groups
pied-piper fashion is a member of
the Student Guide Service.
Last year t>B,9.i() people, tour
ists, students, visiting business
men, and government officials,
visited the top of Hoover Tower.
Half of these were from foreign
countries.
King Baudouin of Belgium and
Madame Pandit, Russian engi
neers and South African emissar
ies rode to the top. Harriman took
the trip up when he was here. All
of these people were accompanied
by student guides.
The Guide Service is a student
run department of the Committee
on Public Exercises at Stanford.

i In response to requests for tours
and for public relations purposes,
the service was organized in the
| 1930'5.
Organized in 1915
It started as a desk in the Gen
eral Secretary's Office. Then in
19 lf> some men wanting extra
money organized it into the form
it now has, with a Head Guide
over a number of student guides.
There were eight guides in 1945.
j The service was self-supporting
with the guides' salaries paid
from funds derived from selling
pictures, postcards, and souvenirs
of the campus.
Now the service has grown to
12 guides who man stations at
Hoover Tower, the Information
Booth at the front of Quad and
the Medical Center.
Salaried by University
Four guides are on duty each
hour from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. six
days a week. The university now
pays the salaries of the members,
who each work four hours a week
and receive $1.25 an hour.
Students interested in working
as guides submit applications to
j Head Guide John Warnock. If
chosen to be members of the serv
ice, they are hired by the univer
sity to serve as guides.
Besides manning the three
guide posts, the Student Guide
Service is responsible for provid
ing tours for all the groups who
write the university asking for
.tours.
I During Spring Quarter an
average of two groups of 25 per
sons tour the campus daily. The
main percentage of these groups
is of high school age. Members
of the California Scholarship
Foundation and the National
I Honor Society, for example, reg
ularly visit Stanford.
Work Is Stimulating
i Warnock says the guides find
j the work especially stimulating in
! that it provides opportunities to
j associate with people from with
out the University. The guides
themselves tell of scores of fas
cinating and unforgettable expe
riences.
There was the time a 5-year-old
boy asked a befuddled guide
whether she could tell him the
average yearly rainfall and the
mean temperature of Palo Alto.
There was the dowager who
thoughtfully told her two com
panions that if she remembered
correctly, Leland Stanford has
something to do with the Univer
sity.
Shattered Reserve
Harried guides still remember
i the effort it took to pacify the
dignified elderly woman whose
reserve was shattered when the
bells went off above them as they
viewed the campus from the
Tower.
Guides remember the cub scout
who was ready to verify Galileo's
Law of Free Fall by dropping one
of his small companions from the
top of the Tower at the same time
as one of the plumper scouts to
see whether they would really
both land at the same time.
Almost all the businessmen,
professors from other universi
ties, and foreign dignitaries who
come to make use of the Hoover
Library ride to the top of the
Tower to view the campus.
