# McKeevers To Berkeley
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (RE) In an
astonishing move intended to
"save athletic relations between
two great universities," USC's
famous McKeever twins, Marlin
and Mike, announced yesterday
they were transferring to the
University of California at Ber
keley.
The twins will fly to Berkeley
today.
The startling announcement
was followed by a statement from
the UC administration that Cal
would immediately press for with
drawal of tlie AAWU from the
NCAA, so that the McKeevers
would be eligible for football next
fall.
Marlin, an end, and Mike, a
guard, both received All-Ameri
can football mention last season
at USC and were track stars.
Mike, center of a nationwide
controversy last fall when he
creamed Cal halfback Steve Bates
during the Cal-USC game, is re
ported to have been instigator of
the move. Close friends said that
Mike has boon remorseful ever
since the slugging incident and
feels that the transfer to Cal may
be the only thing that will save
Cal-USC athletic relations.
No comment was reported from
the USC bead office, although an
assistant coach said, "This could
give us a bad name."
Cal coaches and officials were
unavailable for e o m m en t. but
students marched through the
campus singing "Happy Days Are
Here Again," and a group was
reported ready to greet the twins
at the airport today.
And a campus sage noted,
"April 1 will go down as a date
second only to Charter Day for
the University of California."
