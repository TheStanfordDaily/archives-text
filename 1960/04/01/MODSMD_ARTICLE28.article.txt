# Potent Spartan Freshmen Meet Papooses Today
## 
### 
This afternoon at four o'clock
the Stanford Freshman track
team will play host at Angell
Field to the powerful San Jose
State freshmen, winners of 21
straight dual meets.
The Spartababes. ranked the
No. 1 frosh track team in the
nation last year, appear to be
almost as good this year, and
should provide an outstanding
test for the abilities of the Pa
poose track and field men.
Probably the leading member
of the San Jose squad is 29-year
old freshman Jimmy Omagbeni
of Nigeria. Omagbeni, a member
of the Itsekiri tribe of Ugbori-
Warri, ran the 100-yard dash last
year in 9.1 seconds, and last week
turned in a timp of 9.6 in leading
the Spartababes to a 100-31 romp
over the Cal Freshmen.
And in XSO
A top-flight duel appears to be
shaping up in the half-mile with
Dave Dunbar, the best high school
half-miler in the nation last year,
running against Jim Davis and
Ken Emanuels of Stanford. Eman
uels, the Washington State rec
ord holder in the quarter-mile,
will also run in the 440 against
Bruce Ryner of San Jose, and
this also should bo an exciting
match.
The discus throw will feature
two mammoth weight men, Barry
Rothman. who ranked ninth na
tionally in high school, and Dave
Weill of Stanford. The top San
Jose javelin thrower is Dan
Studney, fourth ranked prep who
has already shattered the school
freshman record.
Gold and Davis
Other Spartababe standouts in
clude high jumper Lynn Gold,
who will be opposed by Stanford's
John Haynie, and miler Ronnie
Davis, who should run close to
4:20.
The Papooses should score well
in the broad jump, with Sheridan
Downey the top prospect, and the
high hurdles, with Bill Batehelor

leading the way. A victory over
the Spartababes will require first
rate Stanford performances in all
events, but Coach Jim Terrill
points out that Stanford, too, has
one of the best freshman track
squads in the country this year
and that his team has a good
chance for victory.

high hurdles, with Bill Batehelor

leading the way. A victory over
the Spartababes will require first
rate Stanford performances in all
events, but Coach Jim Terrill
points out that Stanford, too, has
one of the best freshman track
squads in the country this year
and that his team has a good
chance for victory.
This afternoon at four o'clock
the Stanford Freshman track
team will play host at Angell
Field to the powerful San Jose
State freshmen, winners of 21
straight dual meets.
The Spartababes. ranked the
No. 1 frosh track team in the
nation last year, appear to be
almost as good this year, and
should provide an outstanding
test for the abilities of the Pa
poose track and field men.
Probably the leading member
of the San Jose squad is 29-year
old freshman Jimmy Omagbeni
of Nigeria. Omagbeni, a member
of the Itsekiri tribe of Ugbori-
Warri, ran the 100-yard dash last
year in 9.1 seconds, and last week
turned in a timp of 9.6 in leading
the Spartababes to a 100-31 romp
over the Cal Freshmen.
And in XSO
A top-flight duel appears to be
shaping up in the half-mile with
Dave Dunbar, the best high school
half-miler in the nation last year,
running against Jim Davis and
Ken Emanuels of Stanford. Eman
uels, the Washington State rec
ord holder in the quarter-mile,
will also run in the 440 against
Bruce Ryner of San Jose, and
this also should bo an exciting
match.
The discus throw will feature
two mammoth weight men, Barry
Rothman. who ranked ninth na
tionally in high school, and Dave
Weill of Stanford. The top San
Jose javelin thrower is Dan
Studney, fourth ranked prep who
has already shattered the school
freshman record.
Gold and Davis
Other Spartababe standouts in
clude high jumper Lynn Gold,
who will be opposed by Stanford's
John Haynie, and miler Ronnie
Davis, who should run close to
4:20.
The Papooses should score well
in the broad jump, with Sheridan
Downey the top prospect, and the
high hurdles, with Bill Batehelor

leading the way. A victory over
