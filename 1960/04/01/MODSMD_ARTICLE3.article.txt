# STATE SENATE
## Drinking Age May Go Down 
### 
California's drinking age may be lowered to 18 next year if
a controversial bill coming before Ihe State Senate today gains pas
sage.
The bill, sponsored by State Senator Harold Osborn of Palm
Springs, chairman of the joint Senate-House committee on commerce,

would set the minimum legal age
or tho purchase and consumption
)f alcoholic beverages in the state
if California at 18 years of age.
The bill would include all alco
holic drinks.
Informed sources in Sacramen
to predicted yesterday that the
bill, in one form or another, would
gain passage, but a heated debate
is expected on the Senate floor
today when Osborn's committee
presents its recommendations.
Chairman Osborn said that the
bill, which has been before his
committee four times in the last
11 years, will be presented today
with a recommendation for pass
age.
'Parental Consent'
A minority committee report
will be submitted with the bill
by Rep. Claire Couger of Ureka.
Said Couger. "This bill will solve
none of California's d r inking
problems. A line must be drawn
somewhere, and wherever that
line is there will be a divided
group of young people, some who
may drink and some who may
not."
Couger urged the passage of
a compromise bill permitting per
sons between 18 and 21 years of
age to buy beer, wine and other
beverages with low alcoholic con
tent only.
"Perhaps we could permit these
young people to drink with par
ental consent," suggested Rep.
Douglas Waller of Stockton.
Senate majority leader Lewis
Callahan, in a press conference
yesterday afternoon, said that he
expected the bill to pass within
a week. If so, it will go into effect
no later than ay ear after pass
age.
