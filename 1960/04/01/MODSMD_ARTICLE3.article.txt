by Rep. Claire Couger of Ureka.

none of California's d r inking
problems. A line must be drawn
somewhere, and wherever that
line is there will be a divided
group of young people, some who
may drink and some who may
not."
Couger urged the passage of
a compromise bill permitting per
sons between 18 and 21 years of
age to buy beer, wine and other
beverages with low alcoholic con
tent only.
"Perhaps we could permit these
young people to drink with par
ental consent," suggested Rep.
Douglas Waller of Stockton.
Senate majority leader Lewis
Callahan, in a press conference
yesterday afternoon, said that he
expected the bill to pass within
a week. If so, it will go into effect
no later than ay ear after pass

ASSU office, the post office and
the library. Four petitions will

Both students and faculty may

A mass meeting to discuss the
bill will be held Monday noon in

now and the Fundamental Stand
ard will stand unchanged."
'Morally Better'
Professor Harold T. Sanders 111

going to treat all its students like
adults, then it should have no
objection to the State Legislature
doing likewise."
Sanders said that he would be
willing to take part in the mass
meeting Monday if invited.
Another member of Legislature
noted, "It is morally better to
legalize something like underage
drinking than to let it go on all

the time illegally."
An Inter-fraternity Council offi
cer commented: "I would like to
see the drinking age lowered be
cause I think 18-year-olds are
mature enough to drink.
ABC Los Altos agent W. C.
Fields stated that, "Our job is to
enforce the existing law. what
ever it may be."
"If the bill is passed." Osborn
continued, "we expect that it will
become operative within a year,
certainly by next A pr i 1 Fool's
Dav."

'Morally Better'
Professor Harold T. Sanders 111

going to treat all its students like
adults, then it should have no
objection to the State Legislature
doing likewise."
Sanders said that he would be
willing to take part in the mass

the time illegally."
An Inter-fraternity Council offi
cer commented: "I would like to
see the drinking age lowered be
cause I think 18-year-olds are
mature enough to drink.
ABC Los Altos agent W. C.
Fields stated that, "Our job is to

certainly by next A pr i 1 Fool's
Dav."

by Rep. Claire Couger of Ureka.
Said Couger. "This bill will solve
none of California's d r inking
problems. A line must be drawn
somewhere, and wherever that
line is there will be a divided
group of young people, some who
may drink and some who may
not."
Couger urged the passage of
a compromise bill permitting per
sons between 18 and 21 years of
age to buy beer, wine and other
beverages with low alcoholic con
tent only.
"Perhaps we could permit these
young people to drink with par
ental consent," suggested Rep.
Douglas Waller of Stockton.

yesterday afternoon, said that he
expected the bill to pass within
a week. If so, it will go into effect

leave their names, phone num
hers and the number of passen
gers they can take.
The motorcade is scheduled to
lease Stanford at 1 p.m. Tuesday.
It will arrive in Sacramento in
time for a 4 p.m. joint rally with

Francisco's Union Square for a
second rally at 8 p.m.
Reactions from University offi
cials were mixed. An unidentified
University spokes man said, "The
Stanford campus and Palo Alto
will remain just as 'dry' as it is
now and the Fundamental Stand
ard will stand unchanged."
'Morally Better'
Professor Harold T. Sanders 111
commented, "If the University is
going to treat all its students like
adults, then it should have no
objection to the State Legislature
doing likewise."
Sanders said that he would be
willing to take part in the mass
meeting Monday if invited.
Another member of Legislature
noted, "It is morally better to
legalize something like underage
drinking than to let it go on all

the time illegally."
An Inter-fraternity Council offi
cer commented: "I would like to
see the drinking age lowered be
cause I think 18-year-olds are
mature enough to drink.
ABC Los Altos agent W. C.
Fields stated that, "Our job is to
enforce the existing law. what
ever it may be."
"If the bill is passed." Osborn
continued, "we expect that it will
become operative within a year,
certainly by next A pr i 1 Fool's
Dav."
California's drinking age may be lowered to 18 next year if
a controversial bill coming before Ihe State Senate today gains pas
sage.
The bill, sponsored by State Senator Harold Osborn of Palm
Springs, chairman of the joint Senate-House committee on commerce,

would set the minimum legal age
or tho purchase and consumption
)f alcoholic beverages in the state
if California at 18 years of age.
The bill would include all alco
holic drinks.
Informed sources in Sacramen
to predicted yesterday that the
bill, in one form or another, would
gain passage, but a heated debate
is expected on the Senate floor
today when Osborn's committee
presents its recommendations.
Chairman Osborn said that the
bill, which has been before his
committee four times in the last
11 years, will be presented today
with a recommendation for pass
age.
'Parental Consent'
A minority committee report
will be submitted with the bill
by Rep. Claire Couger of Ureka.
Said Couger. "This bill will solve
none of California's d r inking
problems. A line must be drawn
somewhere, and wherever that
line is there will be a divided
group of young people, some who
may drink and some who may
not."
Couger urged the passage of
a compromise bill permitting per
sons between 18 and 21 years of
age to buy beer, wine and other
beverages with low alcoholic con
tent only.
"Perhaps we could permit these
young people to drink with par
ental consent," suggested Rep.
Douglas Waller of Stockton.
Senate majority leader Lewis
Callahan, in a press conference
yesterday afternoon, said that he
expected the bill to pass within
a week. If so, it will go into effect
no later than ay ear after pass
