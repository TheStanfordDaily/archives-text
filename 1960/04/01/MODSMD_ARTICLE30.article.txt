j meet with the Fresno State cin
der squad.
This is a meet that the Tribe
'figures to win as they have the
! Bulldogs outclassed in most of
' the events.
Fresno State has a pair of fine
I pole vaulters in Don Schaefer and
! Voyce Hendrix. Schaefer reached
j 14 feet last week and Hendrix
cleared the bar at 13-6. Stanford's
I top pole vaulter, Dave Merchant,
has a top jump of 13-6 1 , but
hasn't gone over 13 feet yet this
year. If Schaefer and Hendrix
are in top form, Merchant will
have to improve to beat them.
Fresno State's top half-miler,
Buss Helm, has a top time of
| 1:54.1, but can probably do bet
ter with some stiff competition.
Competition he'll get and plenty

of it from Stanford's 880 men,
Ernie Cunliffe, Bertil Lundh, and
Norm Lloyd.
Cunliffe, who is on the verge
of great things in the mile, won't
be running the four-lapper this
time out, but will stick to the 880
and a leg in the mile relay. His
top time for the 880 is 1:49.2.
Lundh's top mark for the half
mile last year was 1:52.4.
In the 440 the Bulldogs might
do something. Bobby Wyckoff
has a best time of 48.7 and will
be up against .Rich Klier. Dick
Lassen and Chris Hungerland.
Lassen had a top time of 49.7 in
the 440 last year, Hungerland had
a 49.2.
Bob Spielman holds the school
record in the javelin for Fresno
State and will be returning to
action against the Indians after
being out with a sore arm. Art
Batchelder, Jim Backstrand and
Bob Besse will do the honors for
the Tribe against Spielman.
