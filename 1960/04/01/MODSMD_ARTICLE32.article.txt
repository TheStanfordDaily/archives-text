# ROW AGAINST BEAVERS AND TROJANS
## Crew Opens Home Season Tomorrow 
### Bruce Repetto 
The Stanford crew plays host
to the Oregon State Beavers and
USC Saturday in what promises
to he a very exciting race.
The race, which will lie held at
the Redwood City yacht basin,
will feature the varsity, junior
varsity and freshman teams in
their first home encounter. The
JV race starts at 9 a.m. with the
frosh race following at 9:30 and
the varsity race at 10.
The meeting will be a rematch
of the races held in Corvallis last
Saturday which saw the Indian
varsity lose to the Beavers by a
scant 10 feet in a close and thrill

ing race. The Beavers rowing on
their home course, the Willam
ette River, won the Vmile up
stream race with a time of 6:51,
two seconds ahead of the Stan
ford team.
The OSC crew took the lead
at the start, but the Indian crew
came back and caught the Beavers
mile from the finish. The
teams were neck and neck until
the last few strokes when the
Beavers pulled ahead to win by
10 feet.
Stanford won the frosh race by
two lengths, but OSC took the JV
encounter.
The varsity crew was led by

coxswain Kent Mitchell and stroke
John Fulop, both of whom are
probable starters this Saturday.
Mitchell, a junior, is an experi
enced and well qualified coxswain
to direct the shell. Fulop. a Hun
garian refugee, was ineligible to
compete last year. His last race
was with the Hungarian team in
the European Championships.
Behind Fulop will probably be
Jon Loreen, Ward DeWitt, Dennis
Keith, Rod Krebs. Ted Hulbert,
Dick Lyon and Mike Johnson. The
first boat is entirely composed
of sophomores and juniors who
show great potential. No position
is set, however, and Coach Conn

Findlay is still experimenting in |
an effort to come up with a win
ning combination.
Not much has been heard from
the University of Southern Cali
fornia so far ibis year. USC could
be tough for they have lost only
two men from their varsity crew
which defeated I he Stanford team
las year.
Fresh from their victory over
OSC, the frosh crew will go for
two in a row this Saturday. Coach
Phil Waters is optimistic about
his oarsmen and expects big hap
penings. The crew for tomorrow's
race will be headed by coxswain
Kent Imai and stroke Sam Turves.

Others include John Furgeson,
Bill Lamprecht, Hill IVlcDonald,
Jim Solomon, Bill McCall, May
nard Toll and (lil Hapcrn.
The Stanford crews have been
hampered somewhat this week by
the collapsing of the launching
dock. The crews practiced Mon
day and have spent the rest of
the week trying to repair the
damaged dock. The oarsmen and
the dock promise to be in shape
for tomorrow's race, however.
