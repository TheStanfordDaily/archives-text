# Cal Wins Rugby Tussle
## 
### Art Robinson 
The S t anf or d rugby team
played the talented California
Bears even up except for five
minutes and then found them
selves on the short end of an
8-3 score on Ihe Indian rugby
field yesterday afternoon.
Stanford's hard-kicking hooker,
Kyrk Reid, boosted Hie Cards into
a 3-0 leaf) with a 38-yard penalty
kick with about ten minutes to
play in the first half, and the
Indians looked to be on the way
to their first victory over the Blue
and Cold from Berkeley in ages.
But when the two squads re
turned to the field for the second
period, the Indians let up for five
minutes, and Cal quickly garnered
eight points, and held on for the
win.
Most of the first stanza was
ruled by stiff defensive play on
both sides as neither team was
able to mount a strong scoring
drive except for penalty kick
attempts.
Stanford had a chance to draw
first blood with only minutes gone
in the match, when an off-side
gave the Indians a penalty boot
on the 40-yard stripe, but the kick
was short.

The remainder of the half saw
Reid split the uprights with his
kick to send Stanford into a 3-0
margin at the half-way mark.
The final period started out on
a bad note as the California kick
off sailed deep into Indian terri
tory. And after five minutes of
wrestling with the ball, Cal's big
John Harrison took a pass from

a Bear teammate and powered his
way into the Stanford end /one.
Ferguson easily made the con
version to run Cal into a 5-3 lead.
Minutes later Ferguson added a
penalty kick from the 15-yard line
lo give the Bears the final 8-3
margin.
At this point the Indians pulled
themselves together and tight

ened their defense, but were un
able to put together any offensive
drives. The tall California for
wards were able to control the
scrums and especially the line
ouls often enough to prevent the
swift Card backs from scamper*
ing into scoring territory, and rut
oul the clock to insure victory.
