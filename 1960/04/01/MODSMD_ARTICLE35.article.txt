# Netters Slide by Redlands; Douglas, Marines Today
## 
### 
Stanford's tennis team won five
of six singles matches and then
stumbled through doubles action
to nip the University of Redlands
6-3 in a match at Stanford yes
terday.
The Indian not tors were
whipped in only three sets in
singles play with George Bales
playing third, being the only
match victim. However, in doubles
Redlands rallied taking two of
three matches and losing only the
third in a hard-fought third set.
Today Stanford will have a
much more difficult task as they
meet the San Diego Marines
headed by Jack Douglas, Stanford
Daily Athlete of the Year in 1957
and currently the 15th ranking
tennis player in the nation.
Douglas is not the only experi
enced hand on the Marines, how
ever. Ed S 1 e d g e, formerly al
UCLA and still a tough tourna

ment player, is also around as is
John Cranston, another ex-UCLA
strong man.
In today's 2 o'clock match
Douglas will probably meet ex
teammate Dick Ogden, and Cran
ston will play Stanford's Jim Jef
fries. Sledge will have a go with
Stanford's Dick Gould.
Doubles also will be hotly con
tested with a natural between
Jeffries and Ogden and Cranston
or Sleclge and Douglas.
