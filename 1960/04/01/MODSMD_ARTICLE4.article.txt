# MARGARET MEAD:
## Family Steps on Society 
### Barry Greenberg 
An SRO crowd jammed Me
morial Auditorium last night to
hear famous anthropologist Dr.
Margaret Mead state that Ameri
ca's current marriage system is
undermining America's strength.
Dr. Mead said that a person is
considered mentally unbalanced
unless he or she marries at a very
early age. "A chief purpose of
our universities is for young
people to find a mate." -she said.
"Back east, many schools are los
ing the students they want be
cause they are not co-educational."
Girls go to college not because
they are interested in politics, art,
etc., but because they want to
find a man, Dr. Mead related.
"Females are anxious to marry
quickly and therefore disapprove
of ar.y career a man may wish to
pursue if it will take a long time."
Dr. Mead said.
So, men marry early, and raise
a family early, since that is also
considered the thing to do. and
spend most of their time worry
ing about the family instead of
their career or the condition of
the country, she commented.
"In the 1920's and 30's, it was
the tired businessman coming
home; nowadays, it's the tired
father going to the office," Dr.
Mead stated.
She also pointed out that Amer
ica's present marriage system is
run on the idea that a person
should marry someone just like
himself and should live in a com
munity surrounded by people that
are just like his family.
"Families are told to associate
with five families just like them
selves, and. of course, these five
families s u r roun d themselves
with five other families just like
themselves until we have what
we find in the surburbs," Dr.
Mead joked.
Women are also supposed to
marry a man who is mediocre, not
too rich, not too poor, for these
extremities lead to marital strife,
Dr. Mead pointed out.
"Society thinks that an early
marriage and an early family arc
the things to do and the male is
pushed into consideration of
marriage as early as 12 years
old. This robs the male of intia
tive," said Dr. Mead.
"The family is taking too large
a share of the energy of our
younger men. We don't need more
people, we need a different kind
of people if America is to sur
vive."
Dr. Mead spent a good portion
of her lecture comparing the
American marriage system of the
1920's and 30's to that of today's.
"In those days there was no
parental interference. A man
didn't have to prove that he was
sane or that he was rich, he just
had to prove that he could af
ford a $2 license," she said.
"Men could remain bachelors
without being suspected and mar
riage was measured by love. To
day marriage is measured by the
number of days one is willing to
wait," she continued.
In summation, people in the
20's and 3<)'s did not rush into
marriage nor were they pushed
by society into it. A man's career
came before his family, the man.
not the woman, chose his career.
Dr. Mead also pointed out that
today's Church plays a very im
portant role in social life. "Bap
tists go to the Baptist Church to
make friends and Jews go to a
synagogue or ;i temple to make
friends," she said.
"The result is that people very
much like each other marry one
another. Therefore, we see that
society plus ihe Church are re
sponsible in part for people who
are alike intellectually, and cul
turally and who have the same
religious t raining."
Dr. Mead's lecture will be re
broadcast on KZSIJ, Monday at
8 p.m.

their career or the condition of
the country, she commented.
"In the 1920's and 30's, it was
the tired businessman coming
home; nowadays, it's the tired
father going to the office," Dr.
Mead stated.
She also pointed out that Amer
ica's present marriage system is
run on the idea that a person
should marry someone just like
himself and should live in a com
munity surrounded by people that
are just like his family.
"Families are told to associate
with five families just like them
selves, and. of course, these five
families s u r roun d themselves
with five other families just like
themselves until we have what
we find in the surburbs," Dr.
Mead joked.
Women are also supposed to
marry a man who is mediocre, not
too rich, not too poor, for these
extremities lead to marital strife,
Dr. Mead pointed out.
"Society thinks that an early
marriage and an early family arc
the things to do and the male is
pushed into consideration of
marriage as early as 12 years
old. This robs the male of intia
tive," said Dr. Mead.
"The family is taking too large
a share of the energy of our
younger men. We don't need more
people, we need a different kind
of people if America is to sur
vive."
Dr. Mead spent a good portion
of her lecture comparing the
American marriage system of the
1920's and 30's to that of today's.
"In those days there was no
parental interference. A man
didn't have to prove that he was
sane or that he was rich, he just
had to prove that he could af
ford a $2 license," she said.
"Men could remain bachelors
without being suspected and mar
riage was measured by love. To
day marriage is measured by the
number of days one is willing to
wait," she continued.
In summation, people in the
20's and 3<)'s did not rush into
marriage nor were they pushed
by society into it. A man's career
came before his family, the man.
not the woman, chose his career.
Dr. Mead also pointed out that
today's Church plays a very im
portant role in social life. "Bap
tists go to the Baptist Church to
make friends and Jews go to a
synagogue or ;i temple to make
friends," she said.
"The result is that people very
much like each other marry one
another. Therefore, we see that
society plus ihe Church are re
sponsible in part for people who
are alike intellectually, and cul
turally and who have the same
religious t raining."
Dr. Mead's lecture will be re
broadcast on KZSIJ, Monday at
8 p.m.
An SRO crowd jammed Me
morial Auditorium last night to
hear famous anthropologist Dr.
Margaret Mead state that Ameri
ca's current marriage system is
undermining America's strength.
Dr. Mead said that a person is
considered mentally unbalanced
unless he or she marries at a very
early age. "A chief purpose of
our universities is for young
people to find a mate." -she said.
"Back east, many schools are los
ing the students they want be
cause they are not co-educational."
Girls go to college not because
they are interested in politics, art,
etc., but because they want to
find a man, Dr. Mead related.
"Females are anxious to marry
quickly and therefore disapprove
of ar.y career a man may wish to
pursue if it will take a long time."
Dr. Mead said.
So, men marry early, and raise
a family early, since that is also
considered the thing to do. and
spend most of their time worry
ing about the family instead of
their career or the condition of
the country, she commented.
"In the 1920's and 30's, it was
