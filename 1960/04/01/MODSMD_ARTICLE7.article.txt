## Mass Negro Shootings Up for U.N. Discussion 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (/P) The U.N. Security Council was
asked late yesterday to approve a resolution taking South Africa to
task for the mass shootings of Negroes, and calling for an end to
her white supremacy policy.
Ecquador, a member of the 11-nation Council, presented the res-

olution which was agreed upon
previously by representatives of
the Asian-African nations.
The resolution came on the sec
ond day of Council debate on an
Asian-African request that it con
sider t lie mass shooting of South
African Negroes by white police.
In a last-minute change sup
porters of the resolution elimi
nated any reference to outright
condemnation of South Africa.
The change was aimed at winning
British support. The world de
plore was substituted for con
demn.
This came as Bernardus G.
Fourie, the South African dele
gate. returned yesterday after
noon to his seat at the horseshoe
shaped council table.
Police staged a second series of
pi'edawn raids to round up lead
ers of the Negro campaign defy
ing South Africa's strict apart
heid racial segregation laws.
The government gave no sign of
negotiating with moderate Negro
loaders, as its political opposition
has urged. Instead, it continued
the arrests and accused Negro
leaders of organizing "massive
revolt."
Earlier soldiers, police and
tough security measures had re
duced Negro demonstrations to
widespread waves of protest.
