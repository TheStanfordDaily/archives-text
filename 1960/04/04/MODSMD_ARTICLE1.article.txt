# Disarmament Impasse Met

### 
GENEVA (/!') Western officials said yesterday I heir initial op
timism at the 10-nation disarmament conference has been damp
ened by the continuing stonewall tactics of the Soviet-bloc delega
tions.
When the conference started nearly four weeks ago, experts saw

a marked difference from earliei
talks: there were no arguments
over the agenda, no bitter polem
ies on cold war disputes and no
personal friction between the dele
gates.
Still No Result
Three weeks and nearly 100
formal speeches by the two sides
have produced no result, and
Western officials are increasingly
convinced that only the Paris
summit conference next month
may be able to break the dead
lock.
Thus far. Soviet delegate Valer
ian Zorin has maintained an in
flexible position on the Khru
shchev plan for total world dis
armament within four years. The
plan is unacceptable to the West
mainly because:
West's Objections
• It contains no explicit control
provisions to prevent violations.
• Its four-year deadline is re
garded by the West as unreal
istic.
• It rejects the creation of an
international police force to main
tain world order if and when na
tional armed forces are reduced
to the levels required for internal
security.
The Soviet bloc, in turn, has
declared unacceptable the West
ern disarmament plan drafted by
the United States, Britain, France,
Italy and Canada. Communist
speakers have given these main
reasons for their position:
East's Objections
• The Western plan seeks to set
up an elaborate control machinery
without any real disarmament.
• The absence of any time limit
in the Western plan i*elegates
total disarmament to a mere dis
tant hope.
• The Western deman, for a
census of troop levels and arma
ments is an elaborate espionage
plot.
