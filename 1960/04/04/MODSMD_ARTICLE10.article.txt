### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (/P) - The guns of South Afri
ca's soldiers and police enforced an uneasy peace yesterday. In the
lull came realization that the nation is at a perilous crossroads in the
struggle between white supremacy and the nationalism of the over
whelming Negro majority.
"All elements are present for the development not only of a

crisis but. of a national catas
trophe," said the Afrikaans
Dutch dialect Sunday newspaper
Dagbreek, adding: "We can put it
out of our minds to suppress this
awakening by violence. We shall
have to make room for the politi
cal wakening of the black man."
But Dagbreek indicated making
room for the black man does not
mean breaking down South Afri
cas' strict racial segration.
Prime Minister Hendrik Ver
woerd, the nations' leading expo
nent of apartheid, or segregation,
is the chairman of the trust con
trolling the newspaper.
All Quiet
Outside of the stoning of a bus
at Cato Manor near Durban and
the firing of a school near Paarl
in the Cape Town area Saturday
night, police reported quiet
throughout the country.
Police blamed the stoning on
tsotsis, or Negro hoodlums, who
have preyed on residents of Cato
Manor and other Negro settle
ments for years.
A Negro work boycott that had
crippled commerce and industry
in major cities in South Africa
showed signs of breaking.
Docks at Cape Town were
only a few hundred short of the
normal 1,700-man working force
Saturday, even though it was a
half-holiday.
Officials anxiously waited to
see if the workers would show up
in force today.
Tribes Awakening
The newspaper Dagbreek warn
ed that "The Political conscious
ness of the Bantu population
tribes including most of the na
tives is awakening and will never
disappear but will grow."
But at the same time, the idea
of the integration of the Negro
into white society is unthinkable
to the government and the vast
majority of the white population.
South Africa depends on Negro
labor at low wages for the in
dustry and commerce that has
made it outstanding in Africa.
The government already has
the framework of a plan for a
new dedication to apart hied. It
proposes to establish eight or nine
"Bantustans" in rural areas
where the mass of Negroes would
be settled and eventually given
self - government under govern
ment guidance.
The 2 1 1» million Negroes living
in segregated settlements around
the big cities have shown no en
thusiasm for the scheme.

room for the black man does not
mean breaking down South Afri
