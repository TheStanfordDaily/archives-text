Donald • Winbigler, Academic
Secretary, on the proceedings of
the Academic Council held Fri
day afternoon.
The Academic Council discussed
at some length statements which
had been made regarding the
purposes of the Hoover Institu
tion. From the various views ex
pressed, two contrasting positions
emerged. The first was that the
University should take some ac
tion which would represent clear
ly and forcibly to students, fac
ulty, and the public, the Univer
sity's commitment to freedom of
inquiry. The second, on the other
hand, was that the commitment
of the faculty, officers, and Trus

tees of the University to freedom
of inquiry had been amply dem
onstrated, and lhat further dec
laration on the subject at this
time would serve no useful pur
pose.
At the conclusion of the discus
sion the Council adopted a resolu
tion expressing concern over the
statements which had been made
about the purposes of the Hoover
Institution, and referring to its
Advisory Board a recommenda
tion that a committee be appoint
ed to draft a statement of the
scope, importance, and purposes
of the Hoover Institution for sub
mission to the President and his
transmittal to the Board of Trus
t ees.
