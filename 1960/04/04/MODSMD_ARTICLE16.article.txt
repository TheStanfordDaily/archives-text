Editor's Note: The following
statements on Hoover Institu
tion were submitted to The
Daily for publication last Fri
day but due to lack of space
could not appear then.
"The statement of Mr. Hoover
is incompatible with the Univer
sity which is dedicated to the
freedom of Ihe scholar and re
search for truth."
John Johnson
Professor of History
"I commend the prompt action
of the President and the Board
of Trustee s in clarifying the
Board's previous statement and
in reiterating Stanford's unqual
ified support of freedom of in
quiry."
Konrad Krauskopf
Professor of
(.eochemist ry

"The greatness of a university
is defined by its academic free
dom and not by predetermined
assignments. I recognize fully the
moral responsibility of any fac
ulty member who enjoys academic
freedom."
Anatole >la/our
Professor of History
"It is alien to the discipline in
which I work to start with a con
clusion. The goal of research and
study is to describe events and
formulate and test hypotheses.
If, in contrast, however, the
Hoover Institution has ihe "pur
pose"' as described in The Daily,
then I regret it."
Sidney Drell
Associate Professor of
Physics
