A Showdown ?
Kditor, the Daily:
Clearly the Hoover Institution
is currently being used by many
"un-American" students and
scholars for other purposes Ihan
gathering evidence against com
munism, socialism, atheism, and/
or economic materialism. One
might even go so far as to assume
that there are those among us
grateful benefactors of Hoover's
shrine who might accidentally
stumble upon some data com
promising the role of free enter
prise or organized religion in cer
tain contemporary historical con
texts. One might, for example, aid
and abet the cause of atheism by
publishing materials which shed
a bad light on the role of the
Dutch Reformed Church in fur
thering racial biogtry in South
Africa.
The question that must be
asked, then, is, are these people
using the Institution under false
pretenses by not acting in the
spirit of Hoover's statement? If
so, and if the director of the In-

I situation seriously endorses the
statement, •surely a purge is in
order, and I respectfully suggest
that it be done before this thing
gets out of hand. Perhaps to save
himself the trouble of a formal
investigation of the goals of each
user of the Institution, the direc
tor might act in the spirit of
Hoover by having each of us sign
an oath to the effect that we are
dedicated to the destruction of
communism, socialism, atheism,
and economic materialism, and
will use the Hoover Institution
only for these purposes.
If, however, the University feels
that the above-mentioned students
and scholars are not using the In
still ion under false pretenses and
that our consciences may he
cleared and we may continue
peacefully in the pursuit of knowl
edge for its own sake, or at least
for some other sake than Mr.
Hoover's, then clearly the only
honest thing left for the Board
of Trustees is to have a show
down with Hoover himself on this
' issue.
