There is a saying that to gov
ern is to choose, and when we
discuss the President's decision
on nuclear testing, we must be
sure not to lose sight of the fact
that he is confronted with a crisis.
If he does not offer the Russians
a moratorium which they will ac
cept, there will he no treaty. If
there is no treaty, the race in
nuclear armaments will be wide
open, not. only as between the
Russians, the British and our
selves, but also for China and
I he East European satellites.
Much of the opposition, as it is
sues from the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Pentagon, is
based on the assumption that if
we resume the race in the de
velopment of nuclear weapons,
the United States will surely bo
the winner of the race. But have
we the right to make this opti
mistic assumption?
There was 110 suspension of
testing until seventeen months
ago. From the first test explo
sion in l!)4."j until the summer
of 1!)5X we were quite free to
do all the testing we wanted to
do. Hut so, too, were the Rus
sians to do their testing.
In the course of these thirteen
years of an open race, the Soviet
Union caught up with us and be
came a first ckiss nuclear power.
Why, then, should we take it: for
granted that another ten years
of an. open race will see us the
winners, way out in front?
The real question is whether
the Russians, testing in secret,
may continue the race while we
have stopped. This is a theoretical
possibility. But how much of a
probability is it? Not very much,
it seems to me, because the re
wards of secret testing are not
very great while the penalties of
being caught are very great in
deed.
For while there is no cer
tainty that cheating will he
detected, there is no certainty
that it can be concealed. There
are a good many holes in the
iron curtain. In a matter of this
sort not only the intelligence
organizations of the United
States and Great Britain and of
the Western alliance but also
organizations of the neutrals
and indeed of the satellites
would be sensitive and alert.
As I see the problem, the
greatest risk is that if we re
sume the race and step it up,
the Soviet Union will, despite the
risks to itself, make China a nu
clear power. Almost inevitable we,
in our turn, will feel compelled to
make Germany a nuclear power.

For this reason the proposed
treaty and agreement mark a
critical point in this history of
our times. If they can he put
into effect, t lie U.S.S.R. and the
U.S.A. will have established a
very powerful common inter
est — which is to arrest the
spread of nuclear weapons to
other countries and to keep con
trol of the capacity to wage nu
clear war.
