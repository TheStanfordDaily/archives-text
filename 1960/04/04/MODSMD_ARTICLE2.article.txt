# Polish-Cuban Pact Viewed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/Pi The trade
pact between Poland and Cuba
announced in Havana April 1 was
viewed by Washington officials
Sunday as proving once again ihc
Soviet economic offensive is very
much alive.
The pact is a baiter agreement
under which Poland will deliver
airplanes, helicopters, sea-going
vessels, chemical, steel and sugar
processing plants and other in
dustrial machinery and equip
ment. Cuba will ship mainly
sugar and other raw materials.
Washington officials attach less
importance to the fact that Po
land came to assist Fidel Castro's
regime with industrial products
that Cuba now cannot get else
where.
What is more significant in
their view is the swiftness with
which the Soviets once again filled
a gap left open by the West.
Sena, established as the Com
munist counterpart of the Mar
shall Plan it also is called the
Molotov plan was considered de
funct but has been revived since
in 1956 anti-Communist uprisings
in Poland and Hungary. Observ
ers here now believe that as the
over-all economic planning body
of Communist countries in Eu
rope its significance is probably
greater now than ever.
