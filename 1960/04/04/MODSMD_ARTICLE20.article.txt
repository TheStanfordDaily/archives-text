Refusal to Grow
Editor, the Daily:
In view of the recent mass
| shooting of the African peaceful
demonstrators by the South Afri
can police, and bearing in mind
that demonstrations are the only
legal means through which Afri
cans can air their grievances; and
| whereas the said government has
| continuously repudiated the
United Nation's Charter, the Bay
I Charter of the All African Stu
dents Union of the Americas Joins
| its parent organizat ion in con
demning in the strongest terms,
i the sadistic and genocidal policies
| of the South African calvanistic
government.
We further deplore the brutal
ity of the South African police
(many of whom are teen-agers)
in their handling of the demon
strations.
We view with great concern
j that (li the Africans are unrep
resented in a government of their
own country; <2i the African
leaders are deported without trial;
(3) the Africans are not allowed
to occupy any skilled jobs; (4)
the Africans are still begin sub
jected to ruthless and inhumane
: tortures.
We wholeheartedly detest and
hereby denounce the passing and
implementation of the Pass Laws,
the Bantu Education Act, the Job
Reservation Act, the Bantustans
Act and all such Acts that are
being used to deny the Africans
their very basic human rights.
While we mourn for our dispos
sessed Youth of Africa, we hum
bly request your sympathy, un
derstanding: and cooperation so
that we can bring international
pressure to bear on this Boer
government that has refused to
grow with the rest of the world.
