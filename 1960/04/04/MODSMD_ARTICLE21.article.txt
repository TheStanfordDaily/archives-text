## Bernstein's â€˜Joy of Music' Is Delightful Experience 
### Mary Lou Mckinley Managing Editor 
What makes Beethoven so out
standing among the world's great
composers? How does American
musical comedy differ from oper
etta? What makes modern music
"modern"?
If you've ever wondered about
these, then Leonard Bernstein's
book, "The Joy of Music" (Simon
and Schuster, 1959), should hold
a special delight for you. And
even if your musical knowledge
extends to only knowing what you
like and dislike, the hook may
easily prompt further ventures
into the world of the 12-tone scale,
the bongo drum or the opera
house.
Aimed at Layman
Writing primarily for the lay
man, Bernstein takes complex
musical concepts and explains
them in commonplace terms with
an ease of expression that is sure
to hold the attention of the mu
sician as well.
Projecting the same charm,
enthusiasm and sense of humor
which characterized the recent
Omnibus television series ho con
ducted, the literary Bernstein is
just as entertaining as the in
person Bernstein.
The book includes seven of ihe
Omnibus scripts, and, although
printed bars of music are neces
sarily less meaningful to the non
musician than is music actually
played and heard (as featured on
the TV series), the transference
from performance to print here
loses little of the original clarity.
Diagrams Used
Diagrams and sketches are used
frequently and skillfully to help
the reader to understand tonality.
Hundreds of musical examples
are included, and, although it
helps if there is a piano close by,
Ihe accompanying text is ex

plicit enough for those who can't
read music.
The first part of the book in
cludes a series of informal con
versations; Bernstein explains
why he can't sit down and write a
"nice Gershwin tune" and shows
how music is dubbed onto a mo
tion picture sound track.
A photographic sect ion, al
though superfluous, lets the read
er see the outstanding composer
conductor at work in the tele
vision studioes.
Throughout the book, his vital
ity and enthusiasm for music are
evident, and these qualities have
made possible his unique ap
proach to explaining music "a
happy medium somewhere be
tween the mus ie - appreciation
racket and purely technical dis
cussion."
Bernstein's book enables the
reader to discover "The Joy of
Music" whether for the first
time or all over again, it's a de
lightful experience.
