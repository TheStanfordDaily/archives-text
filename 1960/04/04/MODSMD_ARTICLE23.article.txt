RATCLIFFE STADIUM. FRES-1
NO Ernie Cunliffe came within
half a second of the world 880
record here Saturday, as the Stan
lord track team wiped out Fresno
State 95 1 4-34 :, 4.
Gunliffe's time for the half
mile. 1:47.3, is the fastest mark of
the year and the third fastest
time ever recorded. Only Tom
Courtney's world record of 1:46.8,
set in 1957, and Don Bowden's
NCAA record of 1:47.2 are faster.
Herb Elliott, Australia's gi-eat
miler, has a best time for the 880
equal to Cunliffe's
Will Do Both
Cunliffe, who ran the mile in
4:02.1 last week, has now shown
himself to have distinct Olympic
possibilities in both the two- and
four -lapper. In Stanford's upcom
ing meet with the two top track
squads in the country, San Jose
and Kansas, Cunliffe will go all
out and run both the mile and the
half mile. That meet is set for
Saturday in the Stanford Stad
ium.
Stanford swept all three places
in the 880, and in four other
events; the mile, 140, 220 low
hurdles and the broad jump. Two
meet records were set; Cunliffe's
mark broke, his own mark set
last year of 1:50.0, and Art Bat
chelder threw the javelin 223-3 to
break the meet record held by
Stanford's Hank Roldan. Roldan's
mark was 220-4 and was set in
1957.
Behind Cunliffe in the 880 were
Norm Lloyd and Bcrtil Lundh
to give the Tribe the sweep.
In the mile Bob Monzingo,
Lundh and Jeff Evans finished
one, two, three for the Indians.
Monzingo's winning time was
4:15.9 and Lundh and Evans
weren't far behind with marks of
4:20.1 and 4:23.3 respectively.
Lundh ran into trouble on the
final lap when his knee bandage
began to unwind. He ran with it
flapping in the wind for about 150
yards, then finally stopped,
yanked it off and continued run
ning to pick up second place.
Another Sweep
Another Tribe sweep came in
Ihe 440 as Dick L,assen won with
a time of 49.1, follower! by Rick
Klier in 49.6 and Chris Hunger
land in 49.8.
Dean Smith, John Kelly and
John Nourse swept the low hur
dles for Stanford as Smith won
in 23.9, followed by Kelly's 24.4
and Nourse's 24.6.

In the broad jump it was Dan
Moore, Kelly and Charles Barth
giving the Tribe the sweep.
Moore's winning distance was
23-s'i' which was closely 1 railed
by Kelly's 23-3 1 1 and Barth's 22-9.
Fresno State only managed to
pick up 3'i first place, as the
Bulldogs won the 120 yard high
hurdles, the 220. the pole vault
and one-quarter of the high jump
ing honors.
Fresno State did best in the
pole vault as Voyce I Jendrix and
Don Schaefer tied for first with
14-0 and Bob Laidlaw tied with
Stanford's Dave Merchant for
third with vaults of 13-0.
The Bulldogs' prowess in this
event is understandable since
they are coached by Cornelius
Warmerdam, one of the great
pole vaulters of all time.
High Hurdles
Elwood Enns won the high hur
dles for Fresno State with a lime
of 15.0. Nourse and Moore took
second and third for the Indians
with times of 15.1 and 15.2.

for the Bulldogs in 21.9 He was
followed by Norm Pease, also

The high jump finished in a four

| way lie with Stanford's Paul
Gillespie, Rune Engebretsen and
' John Nourse all tieing with Fres
no State's Hendrix at 5-11.
Smith won the 100 for the Tribe
with 9.9 and John Northway
i turned in his best time in the

two-mile, winning that event, in
9:19.9. The Tribe won the mile
relay with a team of Rich Parker.

last year of 1:50.0, and Art Bat

break the meet record held by
Stanford's Hank Roldan. Roldan's

RATCLIFFE STADIUM. FRES-1
NO Ernie Cunliffe came within
half a second of the world 880
record here Saturday, as the Stan
lord track team wiped out Fresno
State 95 1 4-34 :, 4.
Gunliffe's time for the half
mile. 1:47.3, is the fastest mark of
the year and the third fastest
time ever recorded. Only Tom
Courtney's world record of 1:46.8,
set in 1957, and Don Bowden's
NCAA record of 1:47.2 are faster.
Herb Elliott, Australia's gi-eat
miler, has a best time for the 880
equal to Cunliffe's
Will Do Both
Cunliffe, who ran the mile in
4:02.1 last week, has now shown
himself to have distinct Olympic
possibilities in both the two- and
four -lapper. In Stanford's upcom
ing meet with the two top track
squads in the country, San Jose
and Kansas, Cunliffe will go all
out and run both the mile and the
half mile. That meet is set for
Saturday in the Stanford Stad
ium.
Stanford swept all three places
in the 880, and in four other
events; the mile, 140, 220 low
hurdles and the broad jump. Two
meet records were set; Cunliffe's
mark broke, his own mark set
last year of 1:50.0, and Art Bat
chelder threw the javelin 223-3 to
break the meet record held by
Stanford's Hank Roldan. Roldan's
mark was 220-4 and was set in
1957.
Behind Cunliffe in the 880 were
Norm Lloyd and Bcrtil Lundh
to give the Tribe the sweep.
In the mile Bob Monzingo,
Lundh and Jeff Evans finished
one, two, three for the Indians.
Monzingo's winning time was
4:15.9 and Lundh and Evans
weren't far behind with marks of
4:20.1 and 4:23.3 respectively.
Lundh ran into trouble on the
final lap when his knee bandage
began to unwind. He ran with it
flapping in the wind for about 150
yards, then finally stopped,
yanked it off and continued run
ning to pick up second place.
