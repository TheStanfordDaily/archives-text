# Marines Upend Tennismen; Ogden Loses to Douglas
## 
### 
Jack Douglas, one time Stan-]
ford tennis great, returned to the
Farm last Friday and along with
current Indian ace Dick Ogden
treated an enthusiastic gallery to
one of the best played tennis
matches ever witnessed at the
Stanford courts. Douglas prevail
ed in two sets 6-4, 6-4, and led his
San Diego Marine team mates to
a 6-3 win over the Indian netters. !
As far as the team activity was :
concerned it was another case of
doubleitis for the Indians. With
the team score all knotted at 3-3
after single action had boon com
pleted. the Indians proceeded to
lose three doubles matches and
the contest.
Stanford did come out of the
match with some bright lights,
however, as fast improving
George Bates again showed def-1
inite class in singles play as he
defeated Stan Ellis, a one time
Pepperdine ace. Dick Gould and
Gil Ranney also had well played
singles triumphs.
In the Douglas-Ogden match,
the veteran netter from the Ma- 1
lines proved just a little bit stead
ier than his younger opponent.
Both played superb tennis run-1
ning down shots that seemed sure :
winners and making a minimum
of errors.
This afternoon Stanford will ;
meet Santa Clara in a team match
and take on Whitney Reed and his
San Jose mates tomorrow. EJoth

matches will be at homo and both
will begin at 2 p.m.
