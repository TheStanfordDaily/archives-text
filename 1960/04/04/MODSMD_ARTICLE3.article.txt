# CHESSMAN LAWYER
## 'Convict Has Right to Save Selfâ€™ 
### Doug Willis 
"Caryl Chessman is a man
fighting for his life," George T.
Davis, chief counsel for San
Quentin's famous convict-author,
told a Stanford audience Friday.
Davis told a capacity audience
of graduate law students that this
gives Chessman a perfect right to
seek out and use every legal
technicality that he can find.
"As a lawyer 112 am horrified
that people can be so simple and
shallow as to condemn a man
sitting on death row for using
every technicality of the law to
save his life." Davis said.
Need Technicalities
"Men are not perfect and the
justice that they administer is
subject to error. We need these
bothersome 'technicalities' to safe
guard our rights as individuals,"
Davis said.
Davis said that the Chessman
case has gained worldwide atten
tion because "people are uneasy
in fear that the state acted malev
ovently in this case."
Davis described capital punish
ment as a brutal and un-Christian
thing: "ritual murder by the
state."
Davis entered the Chessman
case in 1955 at Chdssman's re
quest when the convict - author
was about to start federal court
proceedings. He described Chess
man as "quite a remarkable per
son who lives up to his high IQ in
many respects."
A 'Wild Hoodlum'
Davis describes Chessman as
"about the wildest hoodlum and
punk you could imagine" at the
time of his arrest as Los Angeles'
red light bandit. He said that he
entered the case too late to be
concerned about Chessman's guilt
or innocence.
"A lawyer, like a doctor, must
help every person that he rea
sonably can who comes to him,"
Davis told the law students. "A
doctor doesn't turn down a pa
tient with contrary political or
ethical views. Neither should a
lawyer," Davis advised.
Davis discussed the recently
rejected plea that Chessman has
undergone cruel and unusual
punishment as a result of his re
peated stays of execution. He said
that the punishment may still be
cruel and unusual in spite of
Chessman's outward attitude.
He criticized the argument that
Chessman can't complain about
cruel and unusual punishments
because he himself asked for and
obtained the stays. "This is a man
fighting for* his life," he said.
