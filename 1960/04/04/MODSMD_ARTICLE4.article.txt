ica's new weather-eye satellite 1
eontinuefl to circle the earth yes
terday at the rate of about once
every 99 minutes and sent j
back more pictures of how thej
world looks from 110 miles above. I
The National Aeronautics and j
Space Administration said Tiros
I, launched on Friday, had nearly !
completed its 33rd orbit at 2:30 j
p.m. yesterday when it was over 1 j
the Indian Ocean.
The Army listening post at Ft. 1
Monmouth, N.J., used its remote
control system to "interrogate" j
the satellite that is, receive its'
stored up photographs at the
beginning of the 33rd orbit. These
covered the Midwest and south
eastern United States.
The Ft. Monmouth station re
set the magnetic tape recorders
that are connected with Tiros' TV
camera to take pictures of cloud
cover conditions over California,
Mexico and Central America dur
ing the 34th orbit. The data was
to be read out at the Hawaii j
listening station during the 3/>th |
orbit.
Tiros is an experimental sat
ellite which scientists hope will ,
provide them with worldwide me-1
