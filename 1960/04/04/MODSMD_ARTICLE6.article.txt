# Pledge Dinners To End Rush
## 
### 
Hot weather and clear skies
shifted the rushing scene to local
beaches this weekend as fraterni
ties and eating clubs prepared to
make their final bids for the cur
rent rushing season.
Rushing at the eating clubs will
be climaxed tonight when each of
the seven clubs holds its pledge
dinner.
Fraternity parties are sched
uled to continue today with
pledge dinners set for tomorrow
night. There will be no contact
between fraternity men and fresh
men tomorrow until the dinners.
The office of the Dean of Men
issued a statement Friday with
regard to rushing eligibility. The
statement said that freshmen who
are minus seven and below may
not attend fraternity rushing ac
tivities of any kind. Freshmen
who are minus one through mi
nus six may attend both open
houses and parties.
Only men whose grade average
is 2.0 or better may accept a pin.
There is no grade restriction on
any eating club rushing activity.
