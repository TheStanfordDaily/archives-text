# Sterling Seeks Accord On Land Development Plan
## 
### Steve Freidberg. Editor 
Cooperation and coordination were the bywords of a meeting
held Saturday morning by President Wallace Sterling with 22 area
officials interested in Stanford's land development program.
The group, composed of mayors of various communities and
members of several county and city planning commission, decided

j on a two-point program to effect
coordination and to clear up
communication difficulties which
have occurred in the past.
The first part of the program
arranges for monthly meetings
; of staff members of area munici
palities and the University, and
the second point consists of bi
annual gatherings of entire city
councils and planning commis
sions with Stanford officials to
review master plans and talk over
j general planning.
During the discussion, several
members pointed out confusion
which has occurred as the result
I of unilateral action on the part
of the municipalities. Sterling
stated the need for clarification of
organizational procedures within
the various units and suggested
that each community write down
the procedural lines it would like
to establish with its neighbors
and any observations on means of
i cooperation.
Planning
Sterling said that the focus of
j this issue of land development
j has been on Stanford w-hich can't
: solve the problems alone. He said
j that an acute relationship exists
: among Stanford's neighbors and
that at times Stanford has been
; shown nothing in the way of
■ plans by some of its neighbors.
He stressed that planning cannot
be dissociated from taxpayers.
A suggestion to hire an outside
I agency to make a study and rec

ommendations on area land de
velopment was rejected in favor
of the two-point program.
Sterling spoke in the afternoon
to a group of about 150 home
owners at an open meeting and
•said that the Trustees were obli
gated to develop Stanford's lands
in the best interest of the Univer
sity. However, this doesn't mean
that there can't lie cooperation
with the surrounding communi
ties, he added.
Trustees' Program
lie mentioned a three-pronged
program established by the Board
of Trustees, the first point being
the development of more Stanford
acreage thus bringing in more
funds and greater benefits of the
academic by-products of the in
dustry on Stanford land. Second
ly, the Trustees increased the
area of University land to be
placed in academic reserve from
1,800 acres to more than 4,700
acres, over half Stanford's prop
erty of 9.000 acres. Sterling in
dicated that in the future, all
Stanford land might be directly
and indirectly used for academic
purposes.
The third point of the program
was the setting of 51-year leases
on all University land except that
suited only for residential pur
poses or already under the usual
99-year leases. The purpose for
this, he said, was to allow for
recoverability of the land for
academic use.

Cooperation and coordination were the bywords of a meeting
held Saturday morning by President Wallace Sterling with 22 area
officials interested in Stanford's land development program.
The group, composed of mayors of various communities and
members of several county and city planning commission, decided

j on a two-point program to effect
coordination and to clear up
communication difficulties which
have occurred in the past.
The first part of the program
arranges for monthly meetings
; of staff members of area munici
palities and the University, and
the second point consists of bi
annual gatherings of entire city
councils and planning commis
sions with Stanford officials to
review master plans and talk over
j general planning.
During the discussion, several
members pointed out confusion
which has occurred as the result
I of unilateral action on the part
of the municipalities. Sterling
stated the need for clarification of
organizational procedures within
the various units and suggested
that each community write down
the procedural lines it would like
to establish with its neighbors
and any observations on means of
i cooperation.
Planning
Sterling said that the focus of
j this issue of land development
j has been on Stanford w-hich can't
: solve the problems alone. He said
j that an acute relationship exists
: among Stanford's neighbors and
that at times Stanford has been
; shown nothing in the way of
■ plans by some of its neighbors.
He stressed that planning cannot
be dissociated from taxpayers.
A suggestion to hire an outside
I agency to make a study and rec

ommendations on area land de
velopment was rejected in favor
of the two-point program.
Sterling spoke in the afternoon
to a group of about 150 home
owners at an open meeting and

gated to develop Stanford's lands
in the best interest of the Univer
