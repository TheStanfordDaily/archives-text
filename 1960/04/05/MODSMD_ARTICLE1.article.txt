# IFC to Discuss Sigma Nu Rush Hassle Tonight
## 
### Jerry Isenberg 
The 1960 Sigma Nu pledge class will be an almost certain i
topic for discussion at tonight's meeting of the Interfraternity j
Council.
IFC president Slender Sweeney announced last night that the
Council will not take any official action on the issue.

Campus interest in the Sigma
Nu pledge class was aroused over
the weekend when it was learned
that a group of freshmen had
rushed that fraternity as a unit.
Sigma Nu had 32 pledges as of
last night.
The pledge class reportedly
contains some of the top men in
the freshman class, including six
of eight Wilbur house presidents
and nine men selected to attend
foreign campuses of the Univer
sity.
This plan was conceived by
several Wilbur men last quarter.
Sigma Nu is now on probation
and responsible to a committee
of alumni for all its actions.
Contacted Wat kins
The several originators of the
plan contacted other freshmen
about the idea secretly, in this
way gaining more supporters.
The group contacted Professor
James T. Watkins IV, informing
him of the idea.
Watkins received unconditional
assurance from the alumni com
mittee that the original group of
freshmen would be bid by Sigma
Nu. It was his understanding at
that time that the committee
would not give this assurance un
less it was satisfied that the
freshmen would be compatible
with the present Sigma Nu mem
bers.
Members of the Sigma Nu
house learned of the plan, accord
ing to house president Swede
Pierson, but did not know the
names of (lie members of the
group. Pierson said that the ac
tives realized that they were in
"bad shape" for rushing after a
poor turnout for their winter
quarter open houses.
Apprehension Among Actives
According to Pierson there was
some apprehension among the
actives concerning the caliber of
the prospective pledges, but they
had no choice but to "go along"
with the alumni's wishes.
At the start of open houses,
marking the beginning of formal
rushing, the actives knew that a
group was rushing the house, but
still did not know all of its mem
bers, Pierson said. By the end of
the scheduled open houses, ail
the members of the group were
known.
Scott Thompson, a spokesman
for the freshman group, said, "It
is a student initiated venture; the
role of Profesor Watkins was
auxiliary, and he came into that
position after the idea was under
way."
Sweeney's Statement
IFC president Sweeney's com- i
plete statement is:
"In light of the fact that the
organization of the Sigma Nu
pledge class was not only con
ceived by, but also planned by the
freshmen involved, the IFC will
not take any official action on
the issue.
"If this plan were used as a
precedent it would result in an
unwelcome change from our pres
ent rushing procedures. However,
the possibility of duplicating the
unique circumstances which al
lowed this plan to materialize is
negligible. Therefore, the long
range results arc welcomed as a
revitalizing force of the Sigma !
Nu house and of the fraternity
system as a whole."

assurance from the alumni com
mittee that the original group of
freshmen would be bid by Sigma
Nu. It was his understanding at
that time that the committee
would not give this assurance un
less it was satisfied that the
freshmen would be compatible
with the present Sigma Nu mem
bers.
Members of the Sigma Nu
house learned of the plan, accord
ing to house president Swede
Pierson, but did not know the
names of (lie members of the
group. Pierson said that the ac
tives realized that they were in
"bad shape" for rushing after a
poor turnout for their winter
quarter open houses.
Apprehension Among Actives
According to Pierson there was
some apprehension among the
actives concerning the caliber of
the prospective pledges, but they
had no choice but to "go along"
with the alumni's wishes.
At the start of open houses,
marking the beginning of formal
rushing, the actives knew that a
group was rushing the house, but
still did not know all of its mem
bers, Pierson said. By the end of
the scheduled open houses, ail
the members of the group were
known.
Scott Thompson, a spokesman
for the freshman group, said, "It
is a student initiated venture; the
role of Profesor Watkins was
auxiliary, and he came into that
position after the idea was under
way."
Sweeney's Statement
IFC president Sweeney's com- i
plete statement is:
"In light of the fact that the
organization of the Sigma Nu
pledge class was not only con
ceived by, but also planned by the
freshmen involved, the IFC will
not take any official action on
the issue.
"If this plan were used as a
precedent it would result in an
unwelcome change from our pres
ent rushing procedures. However,
the possibility of duplicating the
unique circumstances which al
lowed this plan to materialize is
negligible. Therefore, the long
range results arc welcomed as a
revitalizing force of the Sigma !
Nu house and of the fraternity
system as a whole."
The 1960 Sigma Nu pledge class will be an almost certain i
topic for discussion at tonight's meeting of the Interfraternity j
Council.
IFC president Slender Sweeney announced last night that the
Council will not take any official action on the issue.

Campus interest in the Sigma
Nu pledge class was aroused over
the weekend when it was learned
that a group of freshmen had
rushed that fraternity as a unit.
Sigma Nu had 32 pledges as of
last night.
The pledge class reportedly
contains some of the top men in
the freshman class, including six
of eight Wilbur house presidents
and nine men selected to attend
foreign campuses of the Univer
sity.
This plan was conceived by
several Wilbur men last quarter.
Sigma Nu is now on probation
and responsible to a committee
of alumni for all its actions.
Contacted Wat kins
The several originators of the
plan contacted other freshmen
about the idea secretly, in this
way gaining more supporters.
The group contacted Professor
James T. Watkins IV, informing
him of the idea.
Watkins received unconditional
assurance from the alumni com
mittee that the original group of
freshmen would be bid by Sigma
Nu. It was his understanding at
that time that the committee
would not give this assurance un
less it was satisfied that the
freshmen would be compatible
