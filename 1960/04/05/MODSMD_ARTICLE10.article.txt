# WISCONSIN VOTES
## Humphrey, Kennedy Vie Today in Crucial Primary 
### 
MILWAUKEE, Wis. (/P) Senators aspiring to tho presidency
sparred furiously down to tho finish lino yesterday in a blazing
election eve finale to Wisconsin's Democratic primary champaign.
The people pass judgment today at the ballot boxes. More than
a million Wisconsin residents will vote between 7 a.m. when the fhxi

polls open and 8 p.m., when the
last dose. Thirty convention
! votes are at stake in both Demo
cratic and Republican primaries
with a 31st Democratic vote al
ready allotted to the National
; Committee members.
Religion and Records
In closing days of the drive,
religion and records have become
key issues. And, at the very end,
so did a salient facet of foreign
policy a moratorium on nuclear
tests and support of the Eisen
hower administration on that
score.
Sen. John F. Kennedy of Mas
sachusetts hit something of a
headline jackpot on the test issue
with a written pledge to Presi
dent Eisenhower to continue the
administration policy should he
become the next chief executive.
Belated Interest
Supporters of Sen. Hubert A.
Humphrey tried hard to recoup.
They snorted that Kennedy is
showing a sudden, belated inter
est in disarmament, as they con
tend he has in a sound farm pro
gram.
It is Kennedy against Humph
rey in the first full-scale political
battle of a political year. It is a
vital contest for the chances of
either to pick off the Democratic
presidential nomination at the
convention in Los Angeles next
July.
Vice President Richard M. Nix
on is in the primary on the Re
publican side, with no opposition.
But he could come out of the pri
mary with tarnished prestige and
a reflection on his popularity if
he fails to show well in a state
where Republican roots arc
strong.
Swung Wider
Overpowering Humphrey and
making a respectable showing
against Nixon is vital to Ken
nedy's political strategy of walk
ing into the Democratic conven
tion with a commanding and per
haps unbeatable lead. Humphrey
and other rivals hope to pare
Kennedy's strength down to the
point of stalling his momentum
and guaranteeing that the nomi
nation won't be all but settled be
fore the convention begins.
On the final day of campaign
ing Kennedy swung wider geo
graphically. The Humphrey camp
swung tho harder political licks
at the outset.
Likely Winner
Kennedy scrambled around the
Milwaukee area it casts upward
of a third of the Democratic votes
in the state then winged away
to Superior. He was invading
there what is regarded as terri
tory where Humphrey has more
strength.
Humphrey stalked by campaign
bus through the rich dairylands
between Milwaukee and Madison.
Practically all the political au
thorities in Wisconsin and those
who have wandered in from the
outside reached the conclusion
that Kennedy was the likely win
ner.
Influences
What the story of the actual
balloting will be is subject to
several unfathomable influences.
For one thing, there is Ken
nedy's Roman Catholic religion.
Both senators have soft-pedaled
it. Both have said they hoped
nobody will vote for or against a
candidate because of his faith.
Yet there are bound to be peo
ple who will vote for Kennedy lie
cause he is a Catholic and for
Humphrey because he isn't. Some
of I hem may be Republicans who
arc entitled by law to vote in the
Democratic primary.
To what extent Humphrey has
gathered in votes by plugging
this farm issue is impossible to
measure accurately.

Religion and Records
In closing days of the drive,
religion and records have become
key issues. And, at the very end,
so did a salient facet of foreign
policy a moratorium on nuclear
tests and support of the Eisen
hower administration on that
score.
Sen. John F. Kennedy of Mas
sachusetts hit something of a
headline jackpot on the test issue
with a written pledge to Presi
dent Eisenhower to continue the
administration policy should he
become the next chief executive.
Belated Interest
Supporters of Sen. Hubert A.
Humphrey tried hard to recoup.
They snorted that Kennedy is
showing a sudden, belated inter
est in disarmament, as they con
tend he has in a sound farm pro
gram.
It is Kennedy against Humph
rey in the first full-scale political
battle of a political year. It is a
vital contest for the chances of
either to pick off the Democratic
presidential nomination at the
convention in Los Angeles next
July.
Vice President Richard M. Nix
on is in the primary on the Re
publican side, with no opposition.
But he could come out of the pri
mary with tarnished prestige and
a reflection on his popularity if
he fails to show well in a state
where Republican roots arc
strong.
Swung Wider
Overpowering Humphrey and
making a respectable showing
against Nixon is vital to Ken
nedy's political strategy of walk
ing into the Democratic conven
tion with a commanding and per
haps unbeatable lead. Humphrey
and other rivals hope to pare
Kennedy's strength down to the
point of stalling his momentum
and guaranteeing that the nomi
nation won't be all but settled be
fore the convention begins.
On the final day of campaign
ing Kennedy swung wider geo
graphically. The Humphrey camp
swung tho harder political licks
at the outset.
Likely Winner
Kennedy scrambled around the
Milwaukee area it casts upward
of a third of the Democratic votes
in the state then winged away
to Superior. He was invading
there what is regarded as terri
tory where Humphrey has more
strength.
Humphrey stalked by campaign
bus through the rich dairylands
between Milwaukee and Madison.
Practically all the political au
thorities in Wisconsin and those
who have wandered in from the
outside reached the conclusion
that Kennedy was the likely win
ner.
Influences
What the story of the actual
balloting will be is subject to
several unfathomable influences.
For one thing, there is Ken
nedy's Roman Catholic religion.
Both senators have soft-pedaled
it. Both have said they hoped
nobody will vote for or against a
candidate because of his faith.
Yet there are bound to be peo
ple who will vote for Kennedy lie
cause he is a Catholic and for
Humphrey because he isn't. Some
of I hem may be Republicans who
arc entitled by law to vote in the
Democratic primary.
To what extent Humphrey has
gathered in votes by plugging
this farm issue is impossible to
measure accurately.
MILWAUKEE, Wis. (/P) Senators aspiring to tho presidency

election eve finale to Wisconsin's Democratic primary champaign.
The people pass judgment today at the ballot boxes. More than
