## Horn Tells Of Rights Decisions 
### Bob Frank 
"Recent developments suggest
tho increasing importance of the
choice between legislation and liti
gation as means of promoting
civil rights" Professor Robert
Horn told a Political Union meet
ing last night.
The choice is between the courts
and voting rights, between legal
means for recognition of Negro
rights and an attempt to secure
civil rights through the ballot
box.
It is becoming evident, said
Horn, that the Civil Rights Bill
now before Congress will pass,
but that it will be limited to guar
antees of voting rights. Amend
ments guaranteeing .job opportu
nities and adding enforcement to
court orders have been over
whelmingly rejected, he said.
Court Decisions
The latest decisions of the Su
preme Court, Horn pointed out,
have not been unqualified victo
ries for the Negro. In Bates v.
Little Rock, involving an ordi
nance requiring a list of the mem
bers of the local NAACP chapter
to qualify for business tax exemp
tion. Justice Stewart advocated a
balancing of the city's demonstra
tion of "cogent interest" and NA
ACP need to keep membership
secret.
The Alabama pupil placement
law has been upheld by tho
courts, and other states arc fol
lowing Alabama's example. Horn
feels that the Court has no way
to get around its decision except
by reversing its stand.
Difficult
It will be difficult, said Horn,
for the Negro to secure his
rights through the "democratic
processes" of tjie ballot box.
Effective use of democratic pro
cesses depends on three factors
block voting, a split among whites
giving the Negroes a balance-of
power position, and encourage
ment of competition between the
major parties for the Negro vote.
Horn pointed out that block vot
ing by Negroes is likely to cause
resentment from the general pub
lic more resentment than other
minority groups such as labor
and religious minorities, aroused
by similar tactics.
Litigation Proved
Litigation, on the other hand,
has been proven by the N'AACP
to be an effective, as well as in
expensive, means of securing Ne
gro rights.
As we look forward to 1970,
said Horn, we can see attention
shifting to civil rights outside the
South, to problems of private dis
crimination iti employment and in
housing, and because of neighbor
hood segregation incidentally in
schools.
"It costs us nothing to be
'against sin' now. but imagine No
groes staging sit-ins in local real
estate offices protesting because
not all homes are available to
them or will be shown to them by
real estate agents."
Horn, a professor of political
science at Stanford, spoke to the
Political Union group at Bowman
Alumni House on "Civil Rights
in 19G0."

major parties for the Negro vote.
Horn pointed out that block vot
ing by Negroes is likely to cause
resentment from the general pub
lic more resentment than other
minority groups such as labor
and religious minorities, aroused
by similar tactics.
Litigation Proved
Litigation, on the other hand,
has been proven by the N'AACP
to be an effective, as well as in
expensive, means of securing Ne
gro rights.
As we look forward to 1970,
said Horn, we can see attention
shifting to civil rights outside the
South, to problems of private dis
crimination iti employment and in
housing, and because of neighbor
hood segregation incidentally in
schools.
"It costs us nothing to be
'against sin' now. but imagine No
groes staging sit-ins in local real
estate offices protesting because
not all homes are available to
them or will be shown to them by
real estate agents."
Horn, a professor of political
science at Stanford, spoke to the
Political Union group at Bowman
Alumni House on "Civil Rights
in 19G0."
"Recent developments suggest
tho increasing importance of the
choice between legislation and liti
gation as means of promoting
civil rights" Professor Robert
Horn told a Political Union meet
ing last night.
The choice is between the courts
and voting rights, between legal
means for recognition of Negro
rights and an attempt to secure
civil rights through the ballot
box.
It is becoming evident, said
Horn, that the Civil Rights Bill
now before Congress will pass,
but that it will be limited to guar
antees of voting rights. Amend
ments guaranteeing .job opportu
nities and adding enforcement to
court orders have been over
whelmingly rejected, he said.
Court Decisions
The latest decisions of the Su
preme Court, Horn pointed out,
have not been unqualified victo
ries for the Negro. In Bates v.
Little Rock, involving an ordi
nance requiring a list of the mem
bers of the local NAACP chapter
to qualify for business tax exemp
tion. Justice Stewart advocated a
balancing of the city's demonstra
tion of "cogent interest" and NA
ACP need to keep membership
secret.
The Alabama pupil placement
law has been upheld by tho
courts, and other states arc fol
lowing Alabama's example. Horn
feels that the Court has no way
to get around its decision except
by reversing its stand.
Difficult
It will be difficult, said Horn,
for the Negro to secure his
rights through the "democratic
processes" of tjie ballot box.
Effective use of democratic pro
cesses depends on three factors
block voting, a split among whites
giving the Negroes a balance-of
power position, and encourage
ment of competition between the
major parties for the Negro vote.
Horn pointed out that block vot
ing by Negroes is likely to cause
resentment from the general pub
lic more resentment than other
