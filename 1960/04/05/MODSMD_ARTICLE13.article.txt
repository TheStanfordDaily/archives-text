# Stanford Presents
## 
### 
We were somewhat startled las! night to hear the announcer on
a San Francisco radio station sav, on have just heard another
hour of Gaslight, presented by Stanford University.
On cheeking with the radio station, we discovered that Stan
ford is now sponsoring this music program on KAHL one hour a
week from 10:30 to 11:30 on Sunday nights. Also interesting,
however, is that starting April 23, Stanford will alternate weeks
with the University of California in presenting the program.
This sponsoring effort seems to us to he an excellent idea.
These Madison Avenue tactics should prove superior to other
methods for accomplishing the purposes for which this publicity
is apparently intended.
First of all, there will undoubtedly he a larger number of ap
plicants for admission who have been attracted h\ this subtle
advertising. Also, the football team will certainly be graced by
more members as a result. The favorable publicity given Stan
ford by this program should appeal to the general public who
may send in their contributions, if an appropriate approach is
used. And surely the program will help establish better relations
for Stanford with the outside world and increase its stature in
the academic world.
However, we don't feel that publicity of this nature should
stop here. Limitless possibilities are open if advantage only be
taken of them.
An expansion into television is feasible with Stanford's spoil*
sorship of popular shows. IVrr\ Mason could search for and bring
to justice violators of the Fundamental Standard, or Marshall Matt
Dillon could shoot it out with the bad men holed up in Hoover
Tower. And certainly, "The Lineup" would be well suited for
Stanford. If new programs are wanted, then "Stanford Showcase"
or "Leland's Legends" might be fitting.
A catchy slogan is needed such as "LSJU is the place for you,"
or "All the way to the Ilav, " and this could he put on billboards
or in national magazines with pictures of Stanford students loung
ing at Lake Lagunita or enjoying cool refreshment at Kosotti's.
Contests might be initiated to stimulate the public's interest.
For instance, people could tell in 25 words or less "\\ hv every body
should attend Stanford" and would have to enclose the word Stan
ford from the cover of the newest Stanford handbook.
We shall wait with eagerness to see the results of this new
publicity program and the benefits which we're sure will accrue
to Stanford from it. We question only the wisdom of alternating
programs with the I niversitv of California and thus opening the
possibility of the two institutions being confused in the public
mind.
Think about it.

a San Francisco radio station sav, on have just heard another
hour of Gaslight, presented by Stanford University.
On cheeking with the radio station, we discovered that Stan
ford is now sponsoring this music program on KAHL one hour a
week from 10:30 to 11:30 on Sunday nights. Also interesting,
however, is that starting April 23, Stanford will alternate weeks
with the University of California in presenting the program.
This sponsoring effort seems to us to he an excellent idea.
These Madison Avenue tactics should prove superior to other
methods for accomplishing the purposes for which this publicity
is apparently intended.
First of all, there will undoubtedly he a larger number of ap
plicants for admission who have been attracted h\ this subtle
advertising. Also, the football team will certainly be graced by
more members as a result. The favorable publicity given Stan
ford by this program should appeal to the general public who
may send in their contributions, if an appropriate approach is
used. And surely the program will help establish better relations
for Stanford with the outside world and increase its stature in
the academic world.
However, we don't feel that publicity of this nature should
stop here. Limitless possibilities are open if advantage only be
taken of them.
An expansion into television is feasible with Stanford's spoil*
sorship of popular shows. IVrr\ Mason could search for and bring
to justice violators of the Fundamental Standard, or Marshall Matt
Dillon could shoot it out with the bad men holed up in Hoover
Tower. And certainly, "The Lineup" would be well suited for
Stanford. If new programs are wanted, then "Stanford Showcase"
or "Leland's Legends" might be fitting.
A catchy slogan is needed such as "LSJU is the place for you,"
or "All the way to the Ilav, " and this could he put on billboards
or in national magazines with pictures of Stanford students loung
ing at Lake Lagunita or enjoying cool refreshment at Kosotti's.
Contests might be initiated to stimulate the public's interest.
For instance, people could tell in 25 words or less "\\ hv every body
should attend Stanford" and would have to enclose the word Stan
ford from the cover of the newest Stanford handbook.
We shall wait with eagerness to see the results of this new
publicity program and the benefits which we're sure will accrue
to Stanford from it. We question only the wisdom of alternating
programs with the I niversitv of California and thus opening the
possibility of the two institutions being confused in the public
mind.
Think about it.
