Keep Out
lull tor, the Daily:
"Inventiveness" per se is not i
my creed, but I do believe that i
creative material, spiritual and j
political striving demonstrates a
necessary attempt to master our j
destiny. As Dr. Albert Schweitzer
pertinently said of Africa: "You ,
may give a man political freedom >
on a platter, but economic and j
cultural freedom ho must earn." I
I welcome signs iti South Africa i
that Negro peoples are beginning
to constructively assert them
selves. Only by doing so will they j
make Ihe White African (Afri
kaner is Ihe Dutch work for Afri
can) realize that he may dig his
own grave with his fellow coun
tryman, the Black African (who
is incidently as much an invader
from the North as the White man j
is), or exeel in each other's |
achievements. Positive self as
sertion has, on the spur of a
tyrannical government, which I
made no apology for but lecog
nized as a fact, led to bloodshed,
which South Africans of all races
are genuinely shocked by far
more than the outside world.
But just as I have in the past
and will continue to fight, for
Black emancipation in South Afri- |

| ca, so will I fight the outside
world who attempt to invade the
freedom of our White population.
| For to hand out political deter
i mination on the number of heads,
jas the West has done in homo-
I geneous West Africa, or as Pan
j Africanist Nkruhma ("seek ye
first the political kingdom") de
, mands, or as the Daily editorial
on Thursday, and my Friday
i critics, as well as, the United Na
j tions, have expected, and hope
; that loving kindness will take
j care of the rest, is to show woeful
i ignorance of the complexity of
j South Africa's economic and cul
tural divisions.
If world governments, and par
ticularly the United Nations, have
no constructive comprehensive
solution to offer, they have only
â–  one duty: to shut up. World op
| inion on South Africa has always
I been negative and critical, and,
as with Hungary, has done noth
ing but create false hopes and
fears. And though I too have
seen many pictures here of police
striking Africans, I have yet to
see the work of tho nimble photo
grapher who was with the 20
policemen when a throng of 20,-
000 Africans descended upon them
at Sharpville.
