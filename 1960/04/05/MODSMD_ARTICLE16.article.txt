The latest issue of Newsweek
contains an article which once
more brings to the surface a prob
lem which haunts the dreams of
I every male student who is about
| to graduate. The nightmarish
problem is called the draft.
It is not surprising that most
(graduating students are more
than a little upset at knowing
; that their careers will have to be
curtailed a few years in order
j to join an organization which of
fers them little in the way of in
tellectual stimulation or, if one
I is practical-minded, money.
Many enterprising young men
have tried to devise ways of
circumnavigating tlie draft, the
most popular being to break a
leg or develop water • on - tlie
knee. There was one ghoulish
joke not too long ago which
pictures a jubilant young mail
descending the steps of the
local draft board where he has
just taken a physical. Some
one asks him why he is so
happy and the young man gaily
replies, "I don't have t«> enter
the Army . . . I've got cancer."
Others who don't go in for
I masochism try to pretend that
thoy are idiots or cretins. Does
i this work? "Not a chance," says
the Pentagon. "Our examiners
i know all the tricks and then
! some."
Another way of avoiding the
j draft is to marry early and raise
a brood. Of course, this often
turns out to be a case of the cure
being worse than the illness. One
i of t ho favorite jokes of deferred
: USC -students is: "If your grades
fall you'd better have a fertile
girl on tap."
A more sound way of dodging
the draft is to go to Graduate
School and stay there until
you're 2(5, the age at which you
I can no longer be snared. Of
course, Grad School demands
quite a hit ot° money and had
led critics to cry "one law for
the rich, one for the poor."
j Some nosy males want to know
I why they have to be drafted. Why
! can't there be a volunteer Army?
i Why can't he serve his country
i with his brains rather than with
his feet and back?
Lt. (Jen. Lewis B. Hershey, R6-
: year-old boss of the Selective
Draft and who is endearingly
known a-s "Mr. Draft." has most
of the answers. An all volunteer
military system would depend
"upon the willing and the poor,"
Hershey says.
"I (remember well Ihe days
when ihe Army depended on vol
; unteers. You'd get the poor boys
who like to eat and they'd enlist
to eat. With prosperous times, re
! cruiting would slip. When em
ployment dropped, you'd see them
i come back." In other words, if the
1 U.S. wishes to have an all-vol
unteer military system, it would
need a full-scale depression.
"But nowadays," "Mr. Draft"
continues, "in this cold-war kind
of situation, you find you can't
depend on stomach volunteers.
I'm afraid that all this talk ob
jecting to the draft is some
more of our softness —the de
sire to do no work, to shirk our
j citizen's responsibility. We want
everything painless as possible,
everything for comfort and
ease.
I "You even see it in our reoruit
; ing, all this softness. Look at the
offers traveling around the

world, we'll teach you a trade,
no harsh words, more pay, more
comforts. Get out! I wouldn't
make any promises. If citizens
don't see their responsibility to
their nation or community, I don't
know what's left."
Yes, there's no doubting that
Hershey is a rough, tough, nail
chewing, telephone book-ripping
military man. "Under the Uni
versal Military Training and Serv
ice Act, every young man is ob
ligated for a total of six years'
military service, active and re
serve. That's it. Our job is to
count 'em, sort 'em, and deliver
'em," he concludes. One wonders
whether- Hershey has not also
been in the grocery business some
time or another.
Newsweek points out that most
young males realize that it is
their duty to serve their country,
but that the real compaint is not
knowing when he will be called
into service. Most males have 1o
bide their time behind a soda
fountain or gasoline pump be
cause most employers will not
hire likely draft prospects.
Robert Reed graduated from
Princeton in 1J)58 and has been
sitting patiently in his Chicago
home waiting for the inevitable.
"Ever since college, I thought it
would be just a couple of
months. Then as time went by
I thought maybe they had for
gotten all about me. Two
months ago I had my physical.
I guess I'll be called any time
now. I've been waiting so long,
it'll be a relief,'' Heed says.
In the meantime, nearly two
years of the bloom of life have
been plucked from Reed because
of uncertainty.
As "Mr. Draft" says, it'll prob
ably be a long while before the
draft laws are repealed, so we'll
just have to sit tight and hope
that we don't have to wait too
long. After all, there are .some
important things to do.
