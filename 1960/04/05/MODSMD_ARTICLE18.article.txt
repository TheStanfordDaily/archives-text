Crime of Ambition?
Editor, flic Daily:
The Daily published on March
130 and 31 two articles on the sit-1
I uation in South Africa. The writ
j er, a student from South Africa
I (and evidently an amateur jour
nalist), has marshalled a number
of platitudinous arguments in
| support of the measures taken by
the government of South Africa
'in the last week.
He accused the Afro - Asian
â–  Block of being "ambitious." What
does he mean by ambitious?
If seeking freedom, self-preser
vation, growth and protection of
the national resources against
"white" pirots and "while" in
! satiety is, according to the writer,
a "crime of ambition," then I need
j not point out the perfect absurd
1 ity of his argument. Or, are we
Asians and Africans "ambitious"
simply because our "intervention
in the internal affairs of the
South African, state" is an im
polite breach of the U.N. Charter,
j though the "intervention" was on
| the level of the United Nations
itself and took no form of direct
action? The forementioned writ
er denies us even the right of
I denouncing largescale massacres
land extending moral support to
the underprivileged black major
! ity, though he knows perfectly
j well that a "murderer" is not only
j one who commits the act of
. murder, but could also be one
who watches the act passively
(let alone one who defends it
rhetorically). Delhi, Accra and
Washington have chosen to be
I classified as "ambitious" (to use
I South African terminology) rath
' er than accomplices.
The forementioned writer did
! not fail to resort to the last-ditch
argument (regarding Western in
terest and Communist expansion)
s which so many colonial powers
I (and semi-colonialists) often use
to arouse American fears and en
list American sympathy. . . .
The writer ignores the fact that
Communism thrives on chaos and
( is largely the product of suppres
sion bv the ruling authorities and
exploitation by the minorities.
The "rule of civilized white" has
ended in India, Pakistan, Morocco,
; Tunisia and Lebanon, but all these
i countries remained basically pro-

Western and more democratic!
than some white countries. In
spite of her relative backward
ness, India (the non-white coun- j
| try!) is now. more than ever
j before, faithful to the principles i
i of liberal democracy. I have no
I doubt that Communism would j
have been much more powerful
! in India, had Ihe British insisted
on retained "the jewel of the
crown."
Some self-appointed and hypo-1
critical guardians of western in-:
terests in Asia and Africa have
i done more harm to the West than
i any Communist could ever do.
A word, sometimes, could be a I

crime in itself. I will say no more.
