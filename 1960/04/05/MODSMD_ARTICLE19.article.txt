MARV MIX KLKNBERO
Lefty Baffles All-Stars
Stanford baseball team ended
a six-game losing streak, and hot -
tor yet, stifled their old nemesis,
the one-run loss, when they
grabbed a one-runner for them
selves by downing the colorful,
touring Japanese All-Stars, 3-2,
yesterday at the Sunken Dia
mond.
Today the varsity has sched
uled another start, against Uni
versity of California of Davis on
the home field starting at 3:15
p.m.
The Japanese team, whose of
ficial title is the Japanese Maru
zen Oil Company All-Stars, jump-

Ed to an early one-run lead in the
first and upped the margin to
2-0 in the fourth before the locals
started their three-run comeback.
Skip Lawrence opened the Stan
ford half of the sixth inning with
a single, stole second and scored
after Mike Magee walked. John
Hurlbut singled and Jay Winter

got on base on an error. In the)
eighth Stanford parleyed two All-
Star errors with a single by Hurl- •
but to account for two more runs
and the winning margin.
Marv Meeklenberg came in to
relieve starting Card hurler Jim
Smith in the seventh and the lefty
struck out four and allowed no j

! hits in his three-inning appear
ance. Meoklenberg, combining
with Smith, allowed the All-Stars
only five hits tor the entire game
and gave up one earned run.
Losing pitcher Mitsue Nishi
had compiled a 23-2 record in Ja
pan last year and this was his
first loss of the stateside tour;
earlier he had hurled two wins for
