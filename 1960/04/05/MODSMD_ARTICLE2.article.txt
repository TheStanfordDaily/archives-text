# HITS DEMOS
## Ike Claims U.S. 'Most Powerful' 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)—President
Eisenhower fired a new broadside
at Democratic critics of his de
fense policies last night. say-
I ing "only the ignorant and the
blind" insist the United States is
not the most powerful nation in
the world.
At the same time, Eisenhower
underscored his endorsement of
Vice President Richard M. Nixon
j to succeed him. And he jabbed at
certain Democratic senators he
said have gone into "oratorical
orbit" in hopes of scrambling in
to the presidency.
In a speech prepared for the
j eighth annual Republican Wom
en's Conference, Eisenhower
made across-the-board claims of
! achievements for his administra
tion.
Hits Democrats
But some of his most pointed
phrases were aimed at Demo
crats who have been contending
his defense policies threaten to
open the United States to missile
attack and destruction by the
Soviet Union.
"Our nation is the most power
ful in the world," he declared,
"and only the ignorant and the
blind insist it to be otherwise."
Eisenhower said he is "con
vinced that our whole defensive
structure has been accurately tail
ored in the light both of national
needs and operational efficiency."
Praises GOP
He called the GOP the party
of accomplishment. He said that
during his seven years in office
the record has been filled "with
such advances as improvements
in the health and welfare of our
people; the greater soundness,
freedom and growth of our
economy; increased moderniza
tion and strengthening of our de
fenses; greater prestige abroad
and the initiation of a roadbuild
ing program which dwarfs any
thing of its kind in all history of
all nations."
As for the international front,
the President said: "Foremost,
we stopped, on honorable terms,
the fighting in Korea, and since,
have kept the peace."
Eisenhower's speech was the
feature of a box supper affair
billed as a "Republican victory!
campaign kickoff."
Ike said the Republicans expect
to elect a man of their party as
president this year and hope to
recapture Congress.

But some of his most pointed
phrases were aimed at Demo
crats who have been contending
his defense policies threaten to
open the United States to missile
attack and destruction by the
Soviet Union.
"Our nation is the most power
ful in the world," he declared,
"and only the ignorant and the
blind insist it to be otherwise."
Eisenhower said he is "con
vinced that our whole defensive
structure has been accurately tail
ored in the light both of national
needs and operational efficiency."
Praises GOP
He called the GOP the party
of accomplishment. He said that
during his seven years in office
the record has been filled "with
such advances as improvements
in the health and welfare of our
people; the greater soundness,
freedom and growth of our
economy; increased moderniza
tion and strengthening of our de
fenses; greater prestige abroad
and the initiation of a roadbuild
ing program which dwarfs any
thing of its kind in all history of
all nations."
As for the international front,
the President said: "Foremost,
we stopped, on honorable terms,
the fighting in Korea, and since,
have kept the peace."
Eisenhower's speech was the
feature of a box supper affair
billed as a "Republican victory!
campaign kickoff."
Ike said the Republicans expect
to elect a man of their party as
president this year and hope to
recapture Congress.
