The highly touted Spartababes
of San Jose State lived up to their
reputation as they defeated the
Stanford freshman track team,
90 to 41, on Friday afternoon.
Most of the Papoose points
were scored in the field events.
Dave Weill won the discus throw
with a heave of 148'8", while
Sheridan Downey took the broad
jump, leaping 22'5", with Glen
Oriel 1 third. In the high jump
John Haynie tied for first place
at 6'4", and pole vaulter Phil
White cleared 13 feet, only to be
topped by Bruce Turnbull of San
Jose, who vaulted 13'79i", a new
Spartan frosh record.
The high' hurdles provided the
Papooses with their only sweep 1
of the day as I3ill Batchelor, Bill ;
Wandrey, and Harry Wyeth fin- !
ished in that order with a win- i
ning time of 16.0 seconds. Batch- 1
elor came back to take the low j
hurdles in 25.8 seconds with Wan-j
