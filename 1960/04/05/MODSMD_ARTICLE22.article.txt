The hitting and base running of
Gordic Austin paced the Stanford
freshman baseball team to a
sweep of two weekend baseball
games, the first on Friday, from
Lincoln High School of San Jose,
18-5, and then on Saturday from
San Jose Slate frosh, 4-3.
Friday the frosh coupled a hot
hitting attack with eight Lincoln
errors to score in every inning.
Pete Dixon got the victory after
pitching four shutout innings.
Austin got three hits, while Greg
Post, Marc McGinnes, and Jack
Allen each poled a triple.
Saturday, it took tight pitching
and heads-up playing for the
frosh to win the first game of
the f3ay Area Freshman League.

| Stanford took an early lead in the
first inning when Joel Shulman
tripled and later scored, but San
Jose tied it up in the top of the
second on Stanford starting ptieh
j er John Power's wildness, as he
walked the bases loaded, struck
out the next two batters to face !
him, and then gave up a wild
pitch.
Stanford again went ahead in J
the bottom of the second, but San j
i Jose rallied in the fourth to score |
two runs and take the lead, 3-2.1
i Da roll Sutherland came in to re
lieve Power in the inning and he
j was wild, but he got the side out j
after again loading the bases.
Following the'shaky fourth the !
frosh, led by Sutherland, held San
Jose scoreless. Sutherland gave
up only two hits after the fourth,
while striking out five.
Stanford managed to tie the
score in the bottom of the sixth,
'but the time limit on the game
insured that the fray could go no
more than eight innings. In the
bottom of the eighth, Allen
j walked, and when Austin ground
ed to the infield, he broke up the
double play with a good slide.
With two out, Austin stole sec
j ond, went to third as a low pitch
i gf»t past the catcher, and came
home when the catcher's high
throw went over* the third base
man's head.
