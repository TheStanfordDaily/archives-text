# Nation's Top Sprinters to Compete on Stanford Oval
## 
### Dick Barnes 
! Kansas and San Jose State
Come to Stanford Stadium Satur
day at 1:30 for the Bay Area's
best dual or triangular track and
field competition of the 1960 sea
! son. The Jayhawkers and Spar- \
tans finished 1-2 in last year's
NCAA championships, and have
many of their best men back this
year in addition to excellent frosh
team products. All three teams
boast athletes of world class and
potential Olympic team members.
A three-part series of articles will
introduce Saturday's competitors.
Today, the sprints and hurdles;
Wednesrlay, the middle and long |
distances; Thursday, the field
events.

Charlie Tidwell of Kansas and
Bob Poynter of San Jose ran 1-2
in the NCAA 100 final last June,
and face each other Saturday for
the first time since that race.
Tidwell and Poynter each have
career bests of 9.4; Poynter ran i
one of his several 9.4's last week.
Poynter, in particular, is interest
ing to watch because of his al- ■
most-backward body lean.
Stride Brliind
Two Williams boys—Paul of
Kansas and Willie of San Jose
should be only a stride or two
back of the top men. Paul has
run 9.7, and Willie has run 9.(5,
both this year and as a freshman
last spring.
Stanford's Dean Smith could be
up with the Williams pair, but
Norm Pease will probably find it
tough to score. They- have run
9.8 and 9.9 respectively in a wind
aided race.
A change in the NCAA dual
meet event schedule this year has

put the 220 and 220 lows back-to
bark, eliminating the man who
triples in the dashes and lows.
Thus, it is problematical which of
the furlong races Tidwell will
choose.
He holds the American record
for the lows around a turn at 22.7,
and would in all probability win
if entered. In the 220, where he
has run 20.7, he would be an un
derdog to Poynter, a 20.4 man,
and perhaps even Willie Williams,
20.0n.
Kansas has no other good low
hurdlers, but could depend on
Paul Williams (21.2t > and Paul
•Rearick (21.91) in the 220 if Tid
well goes in the barrier race.
Smith tor Indians
Stanford will send Smith and
his 23.9 mark into the lows
against Bill Clifton (23.0) and
Mickey Machamer (23.6n> of the
Spartans, and, of course, possibly
Tidwell. John Kelly of Stanford,
and Danny Lee and/or Clarence
Peterson of the Jayhawks will
complete the lows field.
Pease, with a best of 21 flat,
and Bob Besse (21.0) will go for
Stanford in the furlong against
Poynter, Williams, and two of the
three top Kansans. Each team,
incidentally, has been limited to
two entries in each track event
and three in the field to help
make for an uncluttered meet.
The highs are probably the
meet's weakesl track event. Kan
sas' Curtis McClinton, at 14.7, has
the top time. Clifton, Lee and Pe
terson all have 14.9'5. Stanford's
John Nourse and Dan Moore are
each in the 14.9-15.0 vicinity.
Tomorrow a look at the mid
dle and long distance runners of
each of the three competing
schools.
