\\ c"\ e 1110 11 <illl about it.
About Stanford sponsoring radio shows, that is. I lien, in the
midst of our reverie, came a call from the bureau of news and
publications to tell us that things are not exactly the way we got
them from that tinkly, harplike station yesterday.
Stanford is not sponsoring shows on the station; they re spon
soring us. Ii turns out that news and publications sends press re
leases about Farm happenings to the station and they read them.
For nothing! The station says that Stanford is sponsoring the show.
Yerv public spirited, yes?
There. Think about that.
