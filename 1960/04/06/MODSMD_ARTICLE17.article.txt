## Official African Agency's Facts on Disturbances 
### 
Editor's Note: The following'
are excerpts from a statement
issued by tlie Information Serv
ice of South Africa entitled
"Disturbances in South Africa:
The Facts," New York, March
1960. The Information Serv
ice is the official agency in the
United States of the South Afri-.
can government.
The disturbances which took a
toll of 72 lives in the Union of
South Africa on March 21 should
ho viewed in proper perspective.
The disturbances at Sharpeville
were the result of a planned dem
onstration by some 20.000 Bantu
in which demonstrators made a
deliberate attack on a police sta
tion with assorted weapons, in
cluding fire-arms. Demonstrators
fired the first shots and the po
lice were forced to fire in self
defense and also to avoid even
more tragic results. Allegations
that the demonstrators were
"peaceful and unarmed" are com
pletely untrue.
As recently as January 24, nine
policemen four white and five
non-white were brutally battered
to death, also by an "unarmed"
mob of rioters near Durban.
Intimidation
An important contributing fac
tor to these riots is a campaign
of intimidation waged against
those Bantu who are otherwise
peaceful and law-abiding.
The South African Government
is firm in its resolve that the
police must maintain public order
and ensure public safety. This is
the duty of all governments with
in their own areas of jurisdiction.
It is a duty which cannot be
shared or abdicated. The alterna
tive would result in catastrophe
for all countries as it would in
vade sovereignty and break down
the authority of governments in
the exercise of their duty to main
tain public order.
... In Johannesburg. 132 people
were arrested in connection with
the riots, among them the leader
of the Pan-Africanists, Robert
Sobukwe, who would appear on a
charge of sedition. The others
would be charged under other acts
such as the Riotous Assemblies
Act.
Efficient Police
Dr. Verwoerd (the Prime Min
ister i congratulated the police on
the efficient way in which they
had handled a very serious situa
tion and on the self-control they
had exercised. He had the fullest
confidence in their ability to pre
vent attempts at revolt from suc
ceeding. They had used force only
where they had no other choice.
i From official reports received
it is clear that the police at
Sharpeville were obligated to de
fend themselves against a mob of
20,000. This was after the regu
lar police riot precautions like

I tear-gas had proved ineffectual.)!
Dr. Verwoerd disagreed with
the Opposition that more eon
i tact should be made with leaders I
of t he African National Congress,
j The latter organization did not
j openly advocate violence hut what 1
they advocated could readily lead
to open violence. There were ade
quate channels through which the
Government could make contact
I with law-abiding Bantu leaders.
Background
The Prime Minister also enum
erated some of the main causes of
Monday's disturbances. To have a
real perspective these riots should
not be viewed as an isolated in
! cident. They should bo seen
against the background of similar
I occurences in other parts of Afri-j
I ca and in other countries of the
I world.
They had little to do with the
; reference books against which ;
tire campaign was supposed to he
i aimed. These disturbances were
periodic phenomena.
Dr. Verwoerd also blamed anti
government propaganda for the
I present wave of Bantu unrest.
This unrest drew much of its
| force from the repeated attacks
| on Government policy. The argu
ments used by those who were
determined to get ihe National 1
I Party out of power, and especially
I sensational newspaper reports,
had given rise to this hostility
j among the Bantu. The African
National Congress was just as
1 much responsible for the riots as
| the Pan-Africanists. The former
had created the background in
! which the latter had been able to
j act.
Excitable
j i
Both organizations were weak
: in numbers. The great majority j
| of Bantu are law-abiding. Those!
j who had been drawn into the!
riots were Bantu who had been !
, induced to participate through |
intimidation. The Bantu are:
! easily excitable and given to j
emotional reactions because of j
(their comparative ignorance of
: the true facts.
. . . The so-called pass laws are j
I based on what in effect is a pass-'
I port system regulating the flow I
iof the population from Bantu
j areas to centers of employment. ;
j If this influx is not controlled the ,
industrial areas will be swamped ;
' by people from outside who will
j compete unfairly with the settled
i labor force. Chaotic housing con- 1
! ditions will arise in addition to a
! dangerous slump in wages.
