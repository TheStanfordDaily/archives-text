prove Ihe press box in the Stan
lord Stadium at a cost of some
$123,000 a worthy and doubtless
necessary endeavor.
If I may refer to last year's
Big Game, 1 want to point out
that there were no alphabetical
markers on the stadium sections
inside the stadium. Result: over
worked ushers irying to be every
where at once, and customers
