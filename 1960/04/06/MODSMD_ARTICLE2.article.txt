The scientific ideas and achieve
ments of ancient Greece are a
source of inspiration for modern
science, Samuel Sambursky, pro
fessor of history and the philos
ophy of science at the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem, said last
night. Sambursky initiated t lie
spring Tuesday Evening Series.
The more skill and experience
a scientist today gains in his par
ticular field, said Sambursky, the
more he wants to know of philos
ophy and the relations of science
to human thought. In Greece,
where the development of science
paralleled that of methodical
philosophy, the interplay of the
two elements was realized and
practiced.
Sambursky, who has published
two books on Greek science,
traced Ihe development of an ex
planation of the physical world
in early Greco, from the Milesian
School's strictly material concept
to the mathematical concepts of
the Pythagoreans to the combina
tion of qualities by Aristotle and
the eventual evolution of biochem
istry. Parallels are seen today,
Sambursky asserted, in the de
velopment of atomic theories.
