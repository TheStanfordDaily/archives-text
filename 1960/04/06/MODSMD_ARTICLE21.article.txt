The Niiliitn's 1-2 collegiate
loams of I!)*)!!, Kansas and San
Jose State, join Willi Stanford
licit' Saturday at 1:30 p.m. in
what could lie IJMiO's best dual
or triangular track and field
competition. Vcsl c r d a y , the
sprinters and hurdlers were in
troduced. Today, the middle and
long distance men. Tomorrow
1 he field evonters.
YVorld-roeord-seeking E r n ie
Cunliffo of Stanford heads the
list of runners in races from the
â– IK) through the two-mile. Much
stronger than last year, when he
placed third in the NCAA and
National AAIJ meets, and fifth,
in the Pan-American games, Cun
liffo has already flirted with the
four-minute mile and world half
mile record this year.
Close to Record
His 1:17.3 of last week is only
five-tenths off the world record,
and is the third fastest ever run.
The NCAA does not list a col
legiate record for 800 meters, hut
his 1:16.(5 is believed t<> be either
the fastest or second-fastest ever
tinned in.
Cunliffo has also posted 4:04.4
and 1:02. Ir miles, and a 2:55.9
for the 1320 log in a distance
medley relay.
Payton Jordan will double Cun
liffo Saturday in an effort at point
maximization, but there is little
reason to believe this will do much

to slow his times.
The Indian senior has run with
out competition this year. This
week, however, he should get
strong opposition, at least in the

mile, where San Jose presents
Charlie Clark.
Clark had a 1:09 mile several
j weeks ago, is the national junior
college record holder at four and
eight laps, and surpassed the na
tional collegiate 3000 meter stee
plechase record "by more than 15
'seconds the second time.he ever
ran the event. Ho is expec ted to
i double in the mile and two-mile.
Kansas' topper from the 440 up
is Cliff Cushman .His best event
jis tin 1 400 meter hurdles, where
he is a strong bet to make the
U.S. Olympic loam.
Cushman Versatile
Cushman can run the quarter,
: half, mile or low hurdles, but he
'appears likely to try the 110-880
double, plus a relay leg. His
| quarter-mile best is IS.ti, and he'll
probably win, aided by experience.
San Jose offers Willie Flomons,
who has run 18.4 for 100 motors
equivalent to a -18.7 for the full
quarter. Stanford has Bob Bosse
j and Dick Lassen, who sparkled
'with 17.9 and IS.O relay legs at
j Fresno. Bosse appears to have
S the best chance of upset ting Cush
man.
Cushman could also do the
| major pushing job on Cunliffo in
i the half, along with the Indians'
i Norm Lloyd. Lloyd looked better
1 last week with a 1:52 effort. San
Jose hasn't much in the two
| tapper, but Kansas also has Bobby
I Tague (1:50.9i.
Mills Top Miler
The Jayhawkors, in turn, are
j weak in the mile with Billy Mills'
4:15.7i the best so far. Bortil
1 Lundh will probably be the only
! man to challenge Cunliffo and
Clark. Slowed in training by a
foot injury, Lundh looked im
proved with a 3:08 for 3 laps Sat
urday before he had to stop to
remove a dangling foot bandage.
Mills is a strong two-miler
9:06 who could give Clark
trouble. Stanford offers Bob Mon
zingo and John Northway. Mon
i zingo appears more consistent
than ever before this year. North
way surprised with a career best
of 9: 1t).9 at Fresno.
The relay is tough to figure,
l since all three teams lack depth in
; the 440 and must move men up
or down to make up a strong unit.
