# HUMPHREY: 'WARMUP EXERCISE FOR ME'
## Kennedy Beats Humphrey in Wisconsin As Nixon Runs Third in Large Turnout 
### 
MILWAUKEE (/P) Sen. John F. Kennedy (D-Mass.) won the Wisconsin Democratic presidential
primary last night with a majority of the statewide vote and six of 10 congressional districts.
At the moment of victory in a crucial election, Kennedy had a claim on 20 of the 30 votes in the
Democratic National Convention which were up for grabs. Humphrey was caching for Ihe other 10.
Humphrey went down to a respectable defeat and said he was ready to claim that actually it was
something of a victory for an un-

dei'dog.
Returns from 2,710 of 3,410
precincts in the primary gave:
Kennedy < D > 318.643.
Humphrey (Di 269,913.
Nixon iR> 258,827.
Kennedy leading in 6 districts,
Humphrey in 4.
Confronted with returns show
ing him 20,000 votes behind in the
statewide vote, Humphrey said,
"Well listen. I still consider this
a warmup exercise for me. I do
not feel injured. I mean politically
injured, by the results. I feel it
is a rea-ssuring vote."
Kennedy Passes
At the half-way point in the bal
lot counting, Kennedy passed his
rival in the statewide tally.
Humphrey had set tho pace
from the outset, but largely on
the basis of strong showings in
areas where he was supposed to
be strongest along the Wiscon
sin-Minnesota border.
Hot issues, perfect weather and
a chance to have a say in the first
real political fight of 1960 pulled
people into voting booths early
and, in many cities, in far larger
numbers than four years ago.
One spot after another reported
the balloting running 2-1 or better
over 1956, and ahead of the all
time pace in 1952.
Nixon linns Third
Vice President Richard M. Nix
on came in third in the statewide
balloting. He had no opposition
on tho Republican side of the
primary and never campaigned in
the state.
The Republicans did get busy
toward tho end of the campaign
with newspaper ads and spots on
radio and TV.
With two-thirds of the count,
the Massachusetts senator had
things all his own way. He had
boosted his statewide spread past
40,000 votes.
That was just what he had said
he expected to take ho said any
thing beyond that would be
gravy.
At that point, it looked as if
he would have to do without
gravy.
Kennedy Speaks
But he told a nationwide tele
vision audience: "I feel good be
cause I believe it was a successful
campaign against a worthy oppo
nent. It was a very long and
gruelling campaign. After tonight
I will continue to work on the
other primaries.
"This is not the beginning of
the end. Maybe it is just the be
ginning."
Still Questions
As the balloting reached the
point of decision, there still were
no clear-cut answers to some out
standing questions such ques
tions as how Kennedy's Roman
Catholic religion or Republican
votes in the Democratic primary
may have affected the outcome.
Probably there never will be
sal isfactory answers.
In any event, Kennedy came
out of it with another victory pen
nant to hang up alongside the
one he collected in the New
Hampshire primary last month.
And more than ever he is the out
standing contender at this point

Angeles next July,
MILWAUKEE (/P) Sen. John F. Kennedy (D-Mass.) won the Wisconsin Democratic presidential
primary last night with a majority of the statewide vote and six of 10 congressional districts.
At the moment of victory in a crucial election, Kennedy had a claim on 20 of the 30 votes in the
Democratic National Convention which were up for grabs. Humphrey was caching for Ihe other 10.
Humphrey went down to a respectable defeat and said he was ready to claim that actually it was
something of a victory for an un-

dei'dog.
Returns from 2,710 of 3,410
precincts in the primary gave:
Kennedy < D > 318.643.
Humphrey (Di 269,913.
Nixon iR> 258,827.
Kennedy leading in 6 districts,
Humphrey in 4.
Confronted with returns show
ing him 20,000 votes behind in the
statewide vote, Humphrey said,
"Well listen. I still consider this
a warmup exercise for me. I do
not feel injured. I mean politically
injured, by the results. I feel it
is a rea-ssuring vote."
Kennedy Passes
At the half-way point in the bal
lot counting, Kennedy passed his
rival in the statewide tally.
Humphrey had set tho pace
from the outset, but largely on
the basis of strong showings in
areas where he was supposed to
be strongest along the Wiscon
sin-Minnesota border.
Hot issues, perfect weather and
a chance to have a say in the first
real political fight of 1960 pulled
people into voting booths early
and, in many cities, in far larger
numbers than four years ago.
One spot after another reported
the balloting running 2-1 or better
over 1956, and ahead of the all
time pace in 1952.
Nixon linns Third
Vice President Richard M. Nix
on came in third in the statewide
balloting. He had no opposition
on tho Republican side of the
primary and never campaigned in
the state.
The Republicans did get busy
toward tho end of the campaign
with newspaper ads and spots on
radio and TV.
With two-thirds of the count,
the Massachusetts senator had
things all his own way. He had
boosted his statewide spread past
40,000 votes.
That was just what he had said
he expected to take ho said any
thing beyond that would be
gravy.
At that point, it looked as if
he would have to do without
gravy.
Kennedy Speaks
But he told a nationwide tele
vision audience: "I feel good be
cause I believe it was a successful
campaign against a worthy oppo
nent. It was a very long and
gruelling campaign. After tonight
I will continue to work on the
other primaries.
"This is not the beginning of
the end. Maybe it is just the be
ginning."
Still Questions
As the balloting reached the
point of decision, there still were
no clear-cut answers to some out
standing questions such ques
tions as how Kennedy's Roman
Catholic religion or Republican
votes in the Democratic primary
may have affected the outcome.
