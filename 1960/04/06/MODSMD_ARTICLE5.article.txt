# Bender Room Receives Collection of Dickens
## 
### 
"Tho largest and most impor
tant collection of a single Vic
torian author ever to come to
Stanford" is the way J. Terry
Bender, chief of the Special Col
lections Divisions of the Library,
describes the recent Charles
Dickens material received by the
library.
The extensive collection, do
nated by Christian deGuigne. con
tains over 300 pieces and h;is a
value of thousands of dollars. II
is now in the Alfred M. Bender
Room of the Main Library.
Complete Collection
It was given as a complete col
lection by deGuigne, whose grand
mother, Mrs. Kate Felton Elkins,
donated the nucleus of the Felton
Collection and dedicated that
room over 15 years ago.
The memorabilia contains many
of the pocket bi-weeklies the
Dickens' stories were first pub
lished in during the 1840's.
The importance to scholars of
these publications is due to the
fact that the 16 to 20 page limit
of each story forcer! the author to
present chapters as largely sep
arate episodes.
The effect this had when the
pamphlets were combined into
books can be easily seen. Also in
teresting to scholars are the ads
which appeared on the front and
back covers of the weeklies.
Ads such as "Because of the
many recent plate robberies, the
X Corporation has developed an
inexpensive substitute for silver,"
reveal anxieties and desires of the
period.

| Aside from these works and Ihe
I autographed first editions, there
| is Dickens' personal seal, letters,
a personal cheek, pictures and
1 sketches, and a complete set of
Bent ley's "Miscellanies," an im
portant periodical of the last cen
tury which Dickens edited for a
time and in which such books as
| "Oliver Twist" appeared for the
first time.
Among other items of interest
are the "extra-illustrated" copies
lof such as "Life of Grimaldi."
edited by Dickens under his pen
, name of "80/."
Also called Grangerizing, after
i the first collector, Granger, who
used the method, the process con-
I sists of pasting rare and pertinent
I material about the author or book
■ on pages and binding it into the
correct volume.
Example
The library's copy of Washing
ton li ving's "Life of Washington,"
; for example, was expanded from
five to 20 volumes in this manner
and contains over 100 pages of
sketches, and manuscripts, in-
I eluding three letters written by

"Tho largest and most impor
tant collection of a single Vic
torian author ever to come to
Stanford" is the way J. Terry
Bender, chief of the Special Col
lections Divisions of the Library,
describes the recent Charles
Dickens material received by the
library.
The extensive collection, do
nated by Christian deGuigne. con
tains over 300 pieces and h;is a
value of thousands of dollars. II
is now in the Alfred M. Bender
Room of the Main Library.
Complete Collection
It was given as a complete col
lection by deGuigne, whose grand
mother, Mrs. Kate Felton Elkins,
donated the nucleus of the Felton
Collection and dedicated that
room over 15 years ago.
The memorabilia contains many
of the pocket bi-weeklies the
Dickens' stories were first pub
lished in during the 1840's.
The importance to scholars of
these publications is due to the
fact that the 16 to 20 page limit
of each story forcer! the author to
present chapters as largely sep
arate episodes.
The effect this had when the
pamphlets were combined into
books can be easily seen. Also in
teresting to scholars are the ads
which appeared on the front and
back covers of the weeklies.
Ads such as "Because of the
many recent plate robberies, the
X Corporation has developed an
inexpensive substitute for silver,"
reveal anxieties and desires of the
period.
