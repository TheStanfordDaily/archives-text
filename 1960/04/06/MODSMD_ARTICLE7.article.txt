# No Population Problems Seen, Says Minister

### Walter Houck 
The world is in no danger at
the present time from over-popu
lation, said the Rev. Anthony
Zimmerman, in his lecture "The
Population Question," yesterday.
Zimmerman stated that present
production methods are capable
of supporting 95 billion people
and that advances to come, such
as taking protein directly from
plants, distilling irrigation water
from the sea, manufacturing syn
thetic food, and developing more
productive plants, would make
the earth capable of supporting
many more.
The Rev. Zimmerman, whose
lecture was sponsored by the
Committee on Religious Studies,
demonstrated that a large appar
ent boost in the birth rate was
caused simply by a boost in the
life expectancy and this would
soon level off.
Me pointed out that the main
problems impeding greater pro
duction were not basic. The main
problem was in finding how to
persuade farmers to raise more
food.
Trade barriers, he said, are an
other impediment that would
shortly be leveled out. Conclud
ing, he suggested that family con
trol would become a national
problem when the situation was
so serious that civil liberties had
to be suspended, but that until
that time, the state should not
interfere.
