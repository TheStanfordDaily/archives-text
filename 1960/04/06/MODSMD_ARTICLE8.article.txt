# Stanford Group at MUN Today
## 
### 
Almost 1,000 students, includ
ing 1(5 from Stanford, will flock
to the Cal campus today for the)

Tenth Commemorative session of
the Model United Nations.
More than 80 Western colleges

and universities will send dele
gat ions to the event. Stanford
headed by Chairman Bob Sayler

will represent Great Britain in
the four days of debate.
The MUN was organized 10
years ago here, when 350 college
students, concerned over the pos
sibility of a third global war and
the United Nations' role in keep
ing peace, brought the MUN into
being.
The resulting organization has
become the most active student
conference in support of the U.N.
today. The MUN is organized as
accurately as possible to follow
the real U.N.
Student delegates represent
various countries of the U.N. as
the country itself has in past and
currcnt debate in New York.
Cal today becomes the third
school to hold more than one
MUN, Stanford (19.~>() and 1957)
and USC each having hosted two.
Through the years, many fam
ous people have been connected
with the MUN as guests or mem
bers. New Zealand's Sir Leslie
Munro, president of the 11)57 Gen
eral Assembly, was featured at
last year's meeting at SC.
Stanford was awarded its first
choice of a country this year
because of its good work in repre
senting the United Arab Republic
last year.
Stanford's delegation will stay
;.i Berkeley's Hotel Claremont,
and should arrive back on campus
Saturday night.
