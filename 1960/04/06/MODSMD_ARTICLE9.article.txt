# 'Project M' Closer to Stanford
## AEC Wants Sand Hill Site, Asks $153 Million 
### 
The Atomic Energy Commission announced yesterday that il
wants to go ahead with "Project M" and start construction of a
153-million dollar linear accelerator at Stanford as soon as possible.
The Senate-House Atomic Energy Committee was asked to ap
prove an authorization of $107,200,000 to finance construction plus

|an additional 46 million dollars
; for operating costs during a six
! year period.
All objections to the Stanford
! site have been eliminated, accord
| ing to John A. McCone, AEC
chairman, and the government
iis ready to go ahead with the
project.
Object ions Answered
Congressional action on the ac
celerator was blocked last year
when objections to the site were
raised. Questions were proposed
as to cost, financing, conflicts of
i interest and availability of power.
McCone said the objections
have all been eliminated as the
result of new and extensive AEC
: studies.
If money is appropriated, the
I new accelerator will run parallel
to Sand Hill Road on Stanford
land.
Stanford will lease Ihe land on
i which the new accelerator will
be built to the government for a
nominal one dollar per year.
"Cuts and cover" excavation,
rather than tunneling, will vir
tually eliminate the earthquake
damage hazard caused by nearby
San Andreas fault, and will also
| shave the cost an estimated 1.1-20
million dollars, according to Me
: Cone.
Stanford Know-How
The AEC declared that Stan
-1 ford possesses the only scientific
team in the nation with enough
know-how to operate the linear
accelerator.
Pacific Gas and Electric has
I assured the AEC that it can sup
ply all the power the accelerator
will need.
The new accelerator is designed
to produce 10-20 Bev (billion elec
tron volt i particles. It would be
! second in size only to a 23 Bev
; accelerator in Geneva.
