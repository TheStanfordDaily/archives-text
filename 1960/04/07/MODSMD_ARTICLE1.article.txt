# Final Vote Shows GOP Weakness
## 
### 
MILWAUKEE, Wis. (A 3 ) The final unofficial tally yesterday
from Wisconsin's key presidential primary turned up potential corn
belt pitfalls for the GOP. And it emphasized that Sen. John F.
Kennedy (D-Mass) can make inroads in Republican territory.
From the greatest flood of voters ever cast in a Wisconsin pri-

Mary, these results came through:
Kennedy racked up 478.901
votes, six of 10 congressional dis
tricts, and 20 of 30 votes at the
Democratic National Convention.
He got 56 per cent of the total
Democratic vote; 40 per cent of
the total two-party vote.
Humphrey's Votes
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of
Minnesota gathered in 372,034
votes, four congressional districts,
10 votes at the Los Angeles con
vention next July. Humphrey
drew 44 per cent of the Demo
cratic and 31 per cent of the total
ballot. Kennedy and Humphrey
each had another V* vote going in
from Democratic National Com
mittee members.
Vice President Richard M. Nix
on took in 341,463 votes in the un
contested primary and 30 for the
collection he is gathering for the
Republican National Convention
in Chicago, settling for 29 per
cent of the statewide vote, in a
state which is historically Re
publican.
Catholic Support
Kennedy's victory was achieved
not only from Democratic sup
port. He is a Roman Catholic.
And Roman Catholics obviously
voted for him in large proportions,
regardless of party loyalties. In
some areas Republicans obviously
moved over into the Democratic
primary in heavy numbers.
Humphrey showed best in the
farming areas along the western
edge of the state, adjoining his
home base in Minnesota. But Ken
nedy also ran well in some rural
regions. Humphrey actually took
more counties than Kennedy—37
to 34. But many of them were
small ones.
The next stop for Humphrey
and Kennedy: the West Virginia
primary May 10, in a state only
three or four per cent Catholic.
Nixon's Totals
Nixon interpreted his vote as
"surprisingly large" in the light
of the lack of a contest or con
certed campaign.
But Nixon still came in third.
His total of 341,463 votes com
pared with 347,089 President Ei
senhower got over token opposi
tion four years ago, and the 776,-
624 amassed by all the Republi
can contenders in the 19.12 free
for-all.

the total two-party vote.
Humphrey's Votes
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of
Minnesota gathered in 372,034
votes, four congressional districts,
10 votes at the Los Angeles con
vention next July. Humphrey
drew 44 per cent of the Demo
cratic and 31 per cent of the total
ballot. Kennedy and Humphrey
each had another V* vote going in
from Democratic National Com
mittee members.
Vice President Richard M. Nix
on took in 341,463 votes in the un
contested primary and 30 for the
collection he is gathering for the
Republican National Convention
in Chicago, settling for 29 per
cent of the statewide vote, in a
state which is historically Re
publican.
Catholic Support
Kennedy's victory was achieved
not only from Democratic sup
port. He is a Roman Catholic.
And Roman Catholics obviously
voted for him in large proportions,
regardless of party loyalties. In
some areas Republicans obviously
moved over into the Democratic
primary in heavy numbers.
Humphrey showed best in the
farming areas along the western
edge of the state, adjoining his
home base in Minnesota. But Ken
nedy also ran well in some rural
regions. Humphrey actually took
more counties than Kennedy—37
to 34. But many of them were
small ones.
The next stop for Humphrey
and Kennedy: the West Virginia
primary May 10, in a state only
three or four per cent Catholic.
Nixon's Totals
Nixon interpreted his vote as
"surprisingly large" in the light
of the lack of a contest or con
certed campaign.
But Nixon still came in third.
His total of 341,463 votes com
pared with 347,089 President Ei
senhower got over token opposi
tion four years ago, and the 776,-
624 amassed by all the Republi
can contenders in the 19.12 free
for-all.
MILWAUKEE, Wis. (A 3 ) The final unofficial tally yesterday
from Wisconsin's key presidential primary turned up potential corn
belt pitfalls for the GOP. And it emphasized that Sen. John F.
Kennedy (D-Mass) can make inroads in Republican territory.
From the greatest flood of voters ever cast in a Wisconsin pri-

Mary, these results came through:
Kennedy racked up 478.901
votes, six of 10 congressional dis
tricts, and 20 of 30 votes at the
Democratic National Convention.
He got 56 per cent of the total
Democratic vote; 40 per cent of
the total two-party vote.
