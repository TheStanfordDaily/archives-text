# PASS SYSTEM
## S. African Restrictions Restored 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Af
rica (/Pi Despite rising appeals
for moderation, Ihe government
announced yesterday it will re
vive South Africa's pass system
for nonvvhites. Police vowed to
crush Negroes trying to prolong
the work boycott against white
supremacy rule.
The pass system touched off
ihe current outbreak of racial
turmoil. Negroes demonstrated
against it on March 21 and police
fired into their ranks, killing 72.
The pass laws were then sus
pended.
The violence abated at least
temporarily. An annual holiday
kept people off the streets. But
police and troops staged a strong
show of force around native town
ships.
Passes Required
Justice Minister F. C. Erasmus
said in a statement that the po
lice again will be ordered to de
mand that all Negroes show their
passes any time of Ihe day or
night. lie did not say when the
system will go back into forca
He added that the government
might look into the possibility of
applying the pass laws "in such
a way as to put more stress upon
the advantage they hold for Ne
groes."
Erasmus explained that with
out a pass a Negro could not
work in the city or in any other
area reserved for whites.
After the passes were suspend
ed many Negroes jubilantly
burned their passes- a hated sym
bol of their second-class status in
jobs, housing, education and civil
rights.
Erasmus said police will help
Negroes without passes to obtain
temporary documents until they
can receive duplicates.
Hoodlums Prosecuted
The police pressed their cam
paign against the boycott which
had crippled much of the nation's
industry. They charged the move
ment had been taken over by
hoodlums.
"No stone will be left unturned
to bring these gangster elements
to book," said Col. C. D. Van
Wyk, deputy commissioner of po
lice at Pretoria. He charged they
are henchmen for "so-called lead
ers of the native political organi
zations."
Commercial, mining, industrial
and engineering leaders, the Star
said, intend to ask Verwoerd to
consult immediately with influ
ential Negro leaders and substi
tute identity cards for passes.
Van Wyk called on citizens to
help the police by seizing anyone
suspected of intimidating Ne
groes into staying away from
work.

JOHANNESBURG, South Af
rica (/Pi Despite rising appeals
for moderation, Ihe government
announced yesterday it will re
vive South Africa's pass system
for nonvvhites. Police vowed to
crush Negroes trying to prolong
the work boycott against white
supremacy rule.
The pass system touched off
ihe current outbreak of racial
turmoil. Negroes demonstrated
against it on March 21 and police
fired into their ranks, killing 72.
The pass laws were then sus
pended.
The violence abated at least
temporarily. An annual holiday
kept people off the streets. But
police and troops staged a strong
show of force around native town
ships.
Passes Required
Justice Minister F. C. Erasmus
said in a statement that the po
lice again will be ordered to de
mand that all Negroes show their
passes any time of Ihe day or
night. lie did not say when the
system will go back into forca
He added that the government
might look into the possibility of
applying the pass laws "in such
a way as to put more stress upon
the advantage they hold for Ne
groes."
Erasmus explained that with
out a pass a Negro could not
work in the city or in any other
area reserved for whites.
After the passes were suspend
ed many Negroes jubilantly
burned their passes- a hated sym
bol of their second-class status in
jobs, housing, education and civil
rights.
Erasmus said police will help
Negroes without passes to obtain
temporary documents until they
can receive duplicates.
