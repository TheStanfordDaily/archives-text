\ 111 <>.-1 amusing paradox lias arisen as the result of an issue on
the I niversit\ of CCalifornia campus concerning >• statement known
as I lie Kerr Directives.
I liese Directives were issued last fall l>\ I (C President ( lark
Kerr and slate thai student organizations cannot, h\ their nature,
have full independence of action, therein making student action
subject to prior review. Furthermore, these Directives prevent the
hoards of student hod\ associations on all the Universitv of (Cali
fornia campuses from discussing oil-campus issues, which are de
fined as issues which do not directh affect the student in his role
as a student of the University.
An administration spokesman at (Cal said when the Directives
first appeared. 4 'l don't think student government has as one of
its roles speaking to the public. This is the role of the I Diversity
Affairs (Council. The student government is not meant to repre
sent student opinion in off-campus issues."
The Daily (California!! protested this limitation of student
rights, as did the Fvecutive (Committee, (Cat s legislature, which
said that it wanted to take stands and to sponsor committees on
off-campus issues. The Directives, however, were not enforced
until last week.
At that time the F\ (Com refused to sponsor a committee to
gi\e aid to Southern students who have been arrested and expelled
from school for protesting segregation in the South, using as the
reason for this refusal a new ruling on the Kerr Directives.
An effort to have the National Student Association, of which
(Cal i- a member, sponsor the committee failed when Fx (Com de
cided that \S\ must also fall under the Kerr Directives since
all students at (Cal belong to the \S \. a stand which The l)ail\
(California!! claims is incorrect. And so, no committee has been
established.
Fortunately, llie Stanford administration has not taken the
narrow view which Dr. Kerr assumes and does permit Legislature
freedom in the field of off-campus issues, the only limitations be
ing those placed on the entire I niversilv b\ the Founding Grant.
11 on-par I isanship and non-sectarianism.
LASSU, on the other hand, has decided that it should not con
cern itself uilli off-campus issues, as indicated bv its stand on
capital punishment last quarter. In fact, sonic members'of Legis
lature are opposed to taking action on even some campus issues, j
a* was shown by the dose vote last week on sending a statement |
to the Hoard of Trustees asking the purposes of Hoover Institu
l ion.
Here, then, is the paradox. The Cal legislature wants to take'
stands on off-campus issues, hut it cannot. The Stanford legisla
ture can, but it doesn't want to.
I here is only one possible solution to this stalemate as far
as we can see. Ihe two schools should exchange legislatures, and
then everybody would be happy. The (Cal legislature could take
stand- on off-campus issues, and the Stanford legislature could be
content with selling bike lights at Berkeley.
