## Five-String Banjo 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
One five-string banjo, a plaid
shirt and lie have made a great
deal of difference in ihe world
of folk music in the last 20 years.
They belong to a man called
Pete Seeger. a lanky, enthusiastic
fellow who packed the Palo Alto
High School Auditorium about
this time last year.
Tomorrow night a( X:IS he
will give a folk music concert
iu Memorial Auditorium which
deserves to draw a lull house
of 1,700 people.
Seeger puts on a very relaxed
and informal show. His communi
cation with the audience is so
intense that his presence on the
stage is scarcely a performance:
he is rather a force which binds
together the occupants of every
seat in the auditorium.
He does everything in his power
to make his listeners feel that
this is strictly a last minute get
together at his home. He tunes
his banjo constantly, he moves
chairs and microphones around
the stage, he throws back his
head and taps his feet.
He has no voice as such. His
appeal comes from an unmatch
able vitality and a feeling for
every piece of music lie per
forms. Ilis knowledge of his
and what they are meant
to he is the greatest part of
their impact. Ilis participation
in their feeling makes everyone
listening join him.
One of his greatest areas of in
terest is social consciousness. He
has a large repertory of labor and
union songs, protest and rally
songs, which range all the way
from "Talking Atom" ("all men
will be cremated equal") to "The
Union Maid."
lie gathers songs from house
painters and children, televi
sion commercials and Oxford
students, and adds to each the
Seeger flavor: the song has
found its home.

Seeger was born May 3, 1 Hl9,'in
New York City. His mother was
a violin teacher and his father a
noted musicologist, but he says
he never intended to study music
himself.
In 1935, however, he visited a
square dance festival in Asheville,
North Carolina, and he was
hooked. II was something about
communal pleasure.
Hp spent some time with Alan
Lomax in the archives of Amer
ican folk music in the Library
of Congress, where he heard
many of the recordings Lomax
had made of songs of America.
For a period before World War
II he took his banjo and went
through the south and midwest
and talked with and watched the
people who sing in the mountains,
valleys and plains.
After the war he joined the
Almanac Singers with artists
Woody Guthrie, Lee Hays and
Millard Lampell; and in 1949 he
helped form the Weavers, which
included Ilays, Fred Hellerman
and Ronnie Gilbert. lie was with
the Weavers until 1952.
Since then he has been tour
ing the country giving concerts
and making records. A great
many of his appearances have
been at colleges and universi
ties where he is always greeted
with excitement and acclaim.
His appearance here this week
end is being sponsored by the
Stanford Folk Music Club, who
say that he is "one of the best
folk singers in this country." He
is also appearing in Berkeley to
night and Saturday night.
Seeger also plays Hie 12-string
guitar and the recorder. But
mostly lie sings. And to lie part
of a Seeger audience is an ex
tremely exciting experience, be
cause lie's spontaneous and he's
honest. And because he makes
one feel the immortality of the
folk song.

of a Seeger audience is an ex
tremely exciting experience, be
cause lie's spontaneous and he's
honest. And because he makes
one feel the immortality of the
folk song.
One five-string banjo, a plaid
shirt and lie have made a great
deal of difference in ihe world
of folk music in the last 20 years.
They belong to a man called
Pete Seeger. a lanky, enthusiastic
fellow who packed the Palo Alto
High School Auditorium about
this time last year.
Tomorrow night a( X:IS he
will give a folk music concert
iu Memorial Auditorium which
deserves to draw a lull house
of 1,700 people.
Seeger puts on a very relaxed
and informal show. His communi
cation with the audience is so
intense that his presence on the
stage is scarcely a performance:
he is rather a force which binds
together the occupants of every
seat in the auditorium.
He does everything in his power
to make his listeners feel that
this is strictly a last minute get
together at his home. He tunes
his banjo constantly, he moves
chairs and microphones around
the stage, he throws back his
head and taps his feet.
He has no voice as such. His
appeal comes from an unmatch
able vitality and a feeling for
every piece of music lie per
forms. Ilis knowledge of his
and what they are meant
to he is the greatest part of
their impact. Ilis participation
in their feeling makes everyone
listening join him.
One of his greatest areas of in
terest is social consciousness. He
has a large repertory of labor and
union songs, protest and rally
songs, which range all the way
from "Talking Atom" ("all men
will be cremated equal") to "The
Union Maid."
lie gathers songs from house
painters and children, televi
sion commercials and Oxford
students, and adds to each the
Seeger flavor: the song has
found its home.

Seeger was born May 3, 1 Hl9,'in
New York City. His mother was
a violin teacher and his father a
noted musicologist, but he says
he never intended to study music
himself.
In 1935, however, he visited a
square dance festival in Asheville,
North Carolina, and he was
hooked. II was something about
communal pleasure.
Hp spent some time with Alan
Lomax in the archives of Amer
ican folk music in the Library
of Congress, where he heard
many of the recordings Lomax
had made of songs of America.
For a period before World War
II he took his banjo and went
through the south and midwest
and talked with and watched the
people who sing in the mountains,
valleys and plains.
After the war he joined the
Almanac Singers with artists
Woody Guthrie, Lee Hays and
Millard Lampell; and in 1949 he
helped form the Weavers, which
included Ilays, Fred Hellerman
and Ronnie Gilbert. lie was with
the Weavers until 1952.
Since then he has been tour
ing the country giving concerts
and making records. A great
many of his appearances have
been at colleges and universi
ties where he is always greeted
with excitement and acclaim.
His appearance here this week
end is being sponsored by the
Stanford Folk Music Club, who
say that he is "one of the best
folk singers in this country." He
is also appearing in Berkeley to
night and Saturday night.
Seeger also plays Hie 12-string
guitar and the recorder. But
mostly lie sings. And to lie part

tremely exciting experience, be
