# WISCONSIN VOTE
## Primary Election Results Demonstrate Areas of Kennedy, Humphrey Strength 
### Dick White Contributing Editor 
The Wisconsin primary is over,
but what do the results mean?
The pollsters who had watched
this situation predicted a Ken
nedy landslide in the order of 3-2
over Humphrey, but the results
showed a much more modest
victory.
The results are perhaps most
muddled by the Wisconsin law
which allows any citizen to vote
in either primary. Voters do not
register by party there, and Wis
consin statutes, in an attempt to
control political machines, per
mit the voters to choose which
primary they wish to participate
in.
Wisconsin is usually a Repub
lican state and has supported the
Republican candidate for presi
dent since 1944. Yet in Tuesday's
primary the Democrats had more
than twice the voting strength
of the Republicans.
Since Nixon was unopposed on
the Republican ticket assuring his
victory, it is logical to assume
that many Republicans spurned
their primary to got into the
Democratic fracas. One can hard
ly assume that Wisconsin is sud
denly going to change its Repub
lican colors and give the Demo
crats overwhelming 2-1 support
this November.
Perhaps the most important
issue discussed by the newspapers
during the campaign was that of

religion. Wisconsin, with 32 per
cent Catholics, the largest per
centage of any of the states, was
expected to give Kennedy a strong
edge in voting strength.
The results showed that urban
Catholic centers did give Ken
nedy the lead, whereas the rural
Protestant areas voted more
heavily for Humphrey. Religion
did seem to play an important
role in the voting as it seems like
ly that many Republican Catho
lics crossed over to vote for Ken
nedy.
Humphrey's main strength was
in the farm areas, and in this
election year, the Democrats are
intent on carrying these tradi
tionally Republican centers of
popularity which have only re
cently shown signs of Iheir grow
ing discontent with the Adminis
tration's farm policy.

Kennedy's votes were primarily
from the urban areas which are
historically the strength of the
Democratic party. Almost as avid
as the Solid South in their sup
j port of the party, these people
would vote for almost any Demo
crat nominated.
The primary did demonstrate
j some interesting points. Both of
these men are active campaigners
who would work extremely hard
if nominated by the convention.
Both are good vote-getters; cer
tainly neither has reason to be
ashamed of Tuesday's results.
Most important is the new vital
ity of ihe Democratic party now
that the old campaigners in the
form of Stevenson and Kefauver
are gone. There is great life left
in the party, and the Republicans
would do well to prepare for a
, lively campaign this fall.

nedy.
Humphrey's main strength was
in the farm areas, and in this
election year, the Democrats are
intent on carrying these tradi
tionally Republican centers of
popularity which have only re
cently shown signs of Iheir grow
ing discontent with the Adminis
tration's farm policy.

Kennedy's votes were primarily
from the urban areas which are
historically the strength of the
Democratic party. Almost as avid
as the Solid South in their sup
j port of the party, these people
would vote for almost any Demo
crat nominated.
The primary did demonstrate
j some interesting points. Both of
these men are active campaigners
who would work extremely hard
if nominated by the convention.
Both are good vote-getters; cer
tainly neither has reason to be
ashamed of Tuesday's results.
Most important is the new vital
ity of ihe Democratic party now
that the old campaigners in the
form of Stevenson and Kefauver
are gone. There is great life left
in the party, and the Republicans
would do well to prepare for a
, lively campaign this fall.
The Wisconsin primary is over,
but what do the results mean?
The pollsters who had watched
this situation predicted a Ken
nedy landslide in the order of 3-2
over Humphrey, but the results
showed a much more modest
victory.
The results are perhaps most
muddled by the Wisconsin law
which allows any citizen to vote
in either primary. Voters do not
register by party there, and Wis
consin statutes, in an attempt to
control political machines, per
mit the voters to choose which
primary they wish to participate
in.
Wisconsin is usually a Repub
lican state and has supported the
Republican candidate for presi
dent since 1944. Yet in Tuesday's
primary the Democrats had more
than twice the voting strength
of the Republicans.
Since Nixon was unopposed on
the Republican ticket assuring his
victory, it is logical to assume
that many Republicans spurned
their primary to got into the
Democratic fracas. One can hard
ly assume that Wisconsin is sud
denly going to change its Repub
lican colors and give the Demo
crats overwhelming 2-1 support
this November.
Perhaps the most important
issue discussed by the newspapers
during the campaign was that of

religion. Wisconsin, with 32 per
cent Catholics, the largest per
centage of any of the states, was
expected to give Kennedy a strong
edge in voting strength.
The results showed that urban
Catholic centers did give Ken
nedy the lead, whereas the rural
Protestant areas voted more
heavily for Humphrey. Religion
did seem to play an important
role in the voting as it seems like
ly that many Republican Catho
lics crossed over to vote for Ken
nedy.
