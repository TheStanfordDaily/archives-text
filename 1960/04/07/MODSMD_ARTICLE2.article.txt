# YWCA Protests Discrimination
## 
### Anne Cowen 
An organized protest by Stan
ford students against racial dis
crimination was suggested at a
discussion of "The Religious
Significance of the Sit-Down
Strikers in the South'* at the
YWCA Religious Affairs Lunch
eon yesterday.
Bruce Johnson moderated the
discussion, outlining the major
incidents in the current protest
against racial discrimination.
The aim of the demonstrations,
he said, has been to protest the
lack of dignity and respect ac
corded the Negro as a human be
ing, and to help businessmen
make changes that will be more
compatible with Christian and
democratic ideals.
The southern sit-down protests
against discrimination in restau
rants and places of business have
promoted sympathetic student
demonstrations in the north. Pick
eting of chain stores and drives
to collect funds for legal assist
ance for the protesters have been
among such efforts.
Members of the luncheon group
suggested sympathetic picketing
of chain stores by Stanford stu
dents. Protesting discrimination
situations on the campus and in
the community were also sug
gested.
