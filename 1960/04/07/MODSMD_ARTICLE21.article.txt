A Helping Hand
Kriitor, the Duily:
In the Daily <>112 February 3. you
carried a report that the Uni
versity has joined the Nigerian-
American Scholarship Board "to
help fit foreign students into the
American college scene." Un
fortunately, the administration
alone cannot achieve this goal,
since the major problems of
young African men at Stanford
aVise from their relations with
their fellow students. As their
counselor, I am sorry to say that
the African undergraduates who
have attended Stanford in the last
eight years have been acutely
miserable because they have felt
excluded from natural student fel
lowship.
This isolation has not been de
liberate. It is just an extreme ex
ample of a shortcoming in our so
cial climate which applies to many
other students. Stanford has a
highly structured social pattern
based on dates, cars, and ol'f-cam
pus parties. It is very difficult for
undergraduates who do not fit
into this pattern to find compan
ionship. A non-white student from

Africa is just an extreme illus
tration of this problem.
This letter is written in the
hope that responsible students
will exert a maximum effort to
see to it that the African under
graduate who may be in our midst
next year will lit better into the
Stanford college scene than his
predecessors. This is not a job
which should be loft exclusively
to the lIR, but one which requires
the imagination and dedication of
everyone in the residences and
elsewhere who will have a natural

contact with tho stranger from
Africa.
