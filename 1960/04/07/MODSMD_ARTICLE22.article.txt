### Ron Rapoport 
Public service department (unscrambling: a mess division) At
a meeting of Ba\ Area sportscribes at DiMaggio's restaurant March
8, Art Rosenbaum, self-styled court jester of the city writers, asked
Ernie Cunliffe if he realized that the 4:04.4 mile that he had run
three days ago was as fast as Glen Cunningham had ever done
in his life.
It turns out that Cunningham, one of America's great milers
during the 1930's, had turned in that then miraculous time, which
Cunliffe equaled two months ago, at an indoor race at Dartmouth.
The only trouble was that Cunningham had been paced and his
time was not allowed to appear on the record books.
Ernie said no. he hadn't known about what Cunningham had
done, bul lie did know that 4:04.4 wasn't even good enough to get
him an Olympic berth this summer.
The subject was dropped and a laugh was provided when Cali
fornia's track coach Brutus Hamilton said, "I guess that's kind of
a slap at me, since I was Cunningham's coach."
Now for the business al hand. As Cunliffe's comment indicates,
the International Olympic Committee has. for the first time, set up
qualifying times for the competitors who are going to Rome this
summer. This lias created certain problems in regard to who can,
can't, should and shouldn't go to Rome. The purpose here is to
try to clear things up as best a« possible.
• Flow lo Pick an Olympic Team
To begin with, each country sending men to the Olympics is
allowed to pick its own method of selecting the men. Australia,
for example, has a board of officials which selects its team. The
United States, on the other hand, has a qualifying meet; this
year to be held at Stanford on July 1 and 2.
All was well until the international committee set up the entrance
standards. The committee's ruling is that all the men who enter in
a given event have to have met or bettered the qualifying time.
This time must be met between last October and this coming August.
There is, however, one exception.
If a country has no men who can meet the qualifying time in a
given event, it can send one man in that event who has not met
the qualifying time. But, if the country wants to send more than
one man (three is the maximum allowed for any event) they ALL
have to have met the standard. This means that if only one man
qualifies in an event, he is the only one who can go. What it boils
down to is that if no one qualifies, one man can go for free; but if
one man qualifies in an event, everyone who competes in that
event must have qualified.
In most of the events, the United States will have no trouble
qualifying three men. In the 100 meter dash, for instance, there
were about 25 Americans who met the standard of 9.5 last year.
There will lie some trouble in a few other events, however.
In the 10,000 meter run, for instance, the Olympic qualifying
lime is 29.40.0. The American record was set in 1956 by J. Tyler of
the Navy and is 30:31.9, nearly a minute slower than the qualifying
mark. The qualifying time for the 5,000 meter run is 14:10.0. Max
Truex holds the U.S. record at 14:04.2 and is the only American to
have bettered the qualifying time. And he would have to go under
14:10.0 again, since he hasn't done it since last October. The
hop, step and jump, as well as the steeplechase, could provide other
problems and the U.S. may be forced to send only one man in
those events, because of a dearth of qualifiers.
How lo Get Grey Hair
The problem doesn't end there, however. Try this for a hypo
thetical situation calculated to give U.S. Olympic officials grey hairs.
Say Don Bowden wins the trials at Stanford in the 800 meter
run with a time of 1:49.6 and that Ernie Cunliffe is second with
Tom Murphy of the New York Athletic Club third and Jerome
Walters of the LA Striders fourth. Suppose further that Bowden's
time is the best he has turned in this year. The qualifying time
lor the Olympics is 1:19.2 meaning that Browden has not qualified.
However, Cunliffe met the qualifying time last week at Fresno
and suppose Murphy and Walters have also met the qualifying
mark earlier.
Bowden will get until August to try to run the 800 meters in
1:49.2 or better, but if he doesn't make it he can't go and the U.S.
will have to take Walters.
Headaches would thus be provided for Bowden. who would be
hoping like mad that he could meet the time. Walters, who would
be hoping that Bowden couldn't make it, and the United States
Olympic Committee, who wouldn't know whom to buy a ticket
to Rome for.
Confusing, yes?
