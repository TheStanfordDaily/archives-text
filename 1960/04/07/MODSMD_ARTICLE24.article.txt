## Alley Tops Brilliant Field List for KU-SJS Spikefest 
### Dick Barnes 
Kansas and San Jose State visit
Stanford Saturday at 1 ::-50 in per
haps the nation's best dual-trian
gular track competition of the
year. The last of a three-part se
ries on this meet introduces the
field eventers.
The national collegiate javelin
champion and record-holder, Bill
Alley of Kansas, tops an excellent
list of field event competitors. He
set the collegiate standard last
year at 270-1 'a, then won the
NCAA title at 240-5 despite an
injured elbow.
Alley is exceptionally strong,
and works out often with axes in
the woods. He transferred to
Kansas from Syracuse.
Stanford's Art Batchelder is a
rapidly improving spearman who
never threw until halfway
through last year. He improved
from 145 to 203 feet in five meets,
and has added another 20 feet
this year. He has the potential to
be the greatest-ever in a long line
of excellent Stanford javelin men.
John Book and Terry Buecher
of Kansas, and Bob Besse and
Jim Backstrand of Stanford are
all in the 210-215 range. San Jose
has little in this event.
High Jump Monopoly
The Spartans, however, have it
all their own way in the high*
jump. Erroll Williams, at 6-9 ;! 4,
is defending NCAA co-champ.
Vance Barnes is a newcomer who
moved into the Olympic team pic
ture with a 6-10 leap three weeks
ago at Stanford.
Kansas will bring no high
jumpers. Based on their Fresno
performance, Stanford's leapers
will be fortunate to clear the
opening height.
The broad jump could be the
best-balanced event among the

three teams. Sprinter Paul Wil
liams of Kansas has jumped
24-3 :, 4, and the Spartans' Mac
Burton has gone him : U of an
inch better. Stanford offers John
Kelly and Dan Moore. Both were
well over 24 feet last year, and
Kelly was sixth at NCAA.
Well-Balanced Discus Field
The discus as well looks bal
anced. Kansas lias Jerry Foos
at 165-B'/ii, State has Tom Daniels
at 167-9, and Stanford has Don
Bell, 164-1 and second man at
the '59 West Coast Relays. John
Ross of San Jose is a strong
fourth man at 162 feet.
Jerry Winters should give Stan
ford five points in the shot, where
his near-57 foot standard is more
lhan two feet ahead of the field.
Daniels is next best at 54-B'-,
with another Spartan and two
Kansans in the 53-foot bracket.
The pole-vault looks like a two
way struggle between 14-3 man
Dick Kimmell of San Jose and
14-1 Ken Olsen of Kansas. San
Jose has good secondary strength
in Curtis Chappell (13-8) and Jeff
Chase (13-6), while Stanford must
rely on Dave Merchant (13-0 this
year and 13-6 in '59) for any of
its points.
