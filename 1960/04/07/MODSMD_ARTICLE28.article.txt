"Hollo," said the voice on the telephone. "This is Werther
Sigafoos. T sit next to you in psych. I'm kind of dumpy and
I always wear a sweat shirt.'?
"I'm afraid I don't remember you," said Anna T.ivin Plura
belle.
"I'm the one wliose lecture notes you've lx?en borrowing for
two years," said Werther.
f'Oli, yes!" said Anna Li via. "What do you wish, Walter?"
"Werther," said Werther."W T hat I wish is to take you to the
Junior Prom next April."
"But this is November 27, Westnor," said Anna Livia.
"Werther," said Werther. "Yes, I know, but you are so round
and beautiful that I was afraid you might have a date already."
"As a matter of fact I do, Wingate," said Anna Livia.
VWcrther," said Werther. "Oh, drat!"
Anna Livia did not really have a date, but she was expecting
to be asked by Stewart Stalwart, athletic and BMOO, handsome
as Apollo, smooth as ivory, wearer of faultless tweeds, smoker
of Marlboro cigarettes which even without his other achieve
ments would stamp him as a man will) know-how, with a
pleasure-oriented palate. If you think flavor went out when
filters came in, try a Marlboro. This one brims with zest and
zip and the good, mild taste so dear to those who smoke for the
pure joy of it. (let yourself a pack of Marlboros and listen to
your friends say, "There, by George, goes a smoker who knows
a hawk from a handsaw."
Hut I digress. Anna Livia waited and waited for Stewart
Stalwart to ask her, but two days before the Prom, to every
body's amazement, he asked Rose-of-Sluaron Schwartz, a non
descript girl with pavement-colored hair and a briefcase.

Anna Livia immediately phoned Wert her Sigafoos. "My
Prom date has come down with a dread virus," she said, "and
I have decided to accept your invitation, Waldrop."
V Werther," said Werther. "Oh, goody panders!"
The next day Anna Livia received a phone call from Stewart
Stalwart. "My Prom date has come down witfi a rlread virus,"
he said. "Will you go with me?"
"Certainly," she said and promptly phoned Werther and said,
"T have come down with a dread virus and cannot go to the
Prom with you, Whipstitch."
? Wert her," said Werther. "Oh, mice and rats!"
So Anna Livia went to the Prom with Stewart and who do you
think they ran into? Rose-of-Sharon with Werther, that's who!
Stewart had felt obliged to ask Rose-of-Sharon because she
always did his homework, hut she had weaseled out because she
really wanted to go with Werther with whom she felt a gre.it
oneness because they were both so dumpy. He fell wildly in
love with her at the Prom, and today they are married and run
a very successful five-minute auto wash in New Bern, N. ('.
Anna Livia and Stewart are happy, too. They are still juniors
and have not missed a prom in sixteen years. t i<wm> Mai Himimaa

"As a matter of fact I do, Wingate," said Anna Livia.
VWcrther," said Werther. "Oh, drat!"
Anna Livia did not really have a date, but she was expecting
to be asked by Stewart Stalwart, athletic and BMOO, handsome
as Apollo, smooth as ivory, wearer of faultless tweeds, smoker
of Marlboro cigarettes which even without his other achieve
ments would stamp him as a man will) know-how, with a
pleasure-oriented palate. If you think flavor went out when
filters came in, try a Marlboro. This one brims with zest and
zip and the good, mild taste so dear to those who smoke for the
pure joy of it. (let yourself a pack of Marlboros and listen to
your friends say, "There, by George, goes a smoker who knows
a hawk from a handsaw."
Hut I digress. Anna Livia waited and waited for Stewart
Stalwart to ask her, but two days before the Prom, to every
body's amazement, he asked Rose-of-Sluaron Schwartz, a non
descript girl with pavement-colored hair and a briefcase.

Anna Livia immediately phoned Wert her Sigafoos. "My
Prom date has come down with a dread virus," she said, "and
I have decided to accept your invitation, Waldrop."
V Werther," said Werther. "Oh, goody panders!"
The next day Anna Livia received a phone call from Stewart
Stalwart. "My Prom date has come down witfi a rlread virus,"
he said. "Will you go with me?"
"Certainly," she said and promptly phoned Werther and said,
"T have come down with a dread virus and cannot go to the
Prom with you, Whipstitch."
? Wert her," said Werther. "Oh, mice and rats!"
So Anna Livia went to the Prom with Stewart and who do you
think they ran into? Rose-of-Sharon with Werther, that's who!
Stewart had felt obliged to ask Rose-of-Sharon because she
always did his homework, hut she had weaseled out because she
really wanted to go with Werther with whom she felt a gre.it
oneness because they were both so dumpy. He fell wildly in
love with her at the Prom, and today they are married and run
a very successful five-minute auto wash in New Bern, N. ('.
Anna Livia and Stewart are happy, too. They are still juniors
and have not missed a prom in sixteen years. t i<wm> Mai Himimaa
