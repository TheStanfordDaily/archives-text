## Germany Sends Russ Biting Note 
### 
BONN, Germany </P> Chancel
lor Konrad Adenauer's govern
ment protested yesterday the So
viet hate-Germany campaign in a
note so sharply worded it falls
just short of a breakoff in diplo
matic relations.
The note was delivered to the
Soviet Foreign Office in Moscow
by Ambassador Hans Kroll. The
text was made public in Bonn.
The West Germans singled out
for special attack what was called
the campaign of slander put on
by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrush
chev in his recent visit to France,
their strongest Continental ally.
The note said Bonn had taken
up diplomatic relations with Mos
cow in an effort to ease interna
tional tensions. That was in 1955.
Soviet Impression
As a result of Khrushchev's ut
terances in France, the note said,
Bonn "cannot hut gain the im
pression that the Soviet Union
has not acted in the same spirit."
"The Federal Republic" of West
Germany, the note said icily, "can
not believe in the sincerity of the
professed Soviet efforts to relax
tensions so long as the Soviet
Union seeks throughout the world
to awaken hatred and hostility
against the German people."
That kind of language rarely is
used in communications between
governments maintaining normal
diplomatic relations.
Distorted Picture
The note said that Khrushchev,
who repeatedly assailed what he
called rising militarism in West
Germany, sought to give the
French public "a completely dis
torted picture of the political atti
tudes of the German public and
the German government."
Khrushchev's theme was that
"the Federal Republic, and in par
ticular the Chancellor, harbored
Fascist, militaristic and revenge
ful-seeking ideas," it said, and his
aim appeared to be to shatter the
new friendship between West
Germany and France.
"But his campaign of slander
did not achieve its aims," the note
added. "The Federal Republic
knows that it can count on the
faithfulness and friendship of its
allies."
