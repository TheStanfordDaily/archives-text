## 'Skyscraper' End Station Proposed for Accelerator 
### 
A ten-story building has been proposed for the end station of
Project M. Stanford's proposed 153-million dollar linear accelerator,
a university spokesman said yesterday.
The 100-foot tall structure would be the second highest struc

project. However, the Menlo Park
City Council and the Ladera Com

Younger (H-San Mateo).
The primary causc for concern,
according to Menlo Park Mayor
William Lawson. is the fact that
the federal government went
ahead with plans for the struc
ture (which will be close to the

even telling us about it.''
Apparently concerned w i th
property values deteriorating in
the neighborhood of the large
building, the two groups were
somewhat placated yesterday
when Congressman Younger indi
cated that the size and location
of the accelerator is still open to
revision.
In addition, a Stanford spokes
man stated that the University
would do everything it could to
make the site beautiful.
Menlo Park Councilman Guy
Plaisted, an electrical engineer
who has worked with Stanford
physicists on the project for the
past two years, commented that
the installation cannot hurt Men
lo Park and will be of great
