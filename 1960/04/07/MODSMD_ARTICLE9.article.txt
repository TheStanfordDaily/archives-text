# Nose Counters Are Here
## 
### 
Uncle Sam will begin to
count noses on The Farm to
day and tomorrow when cen
sus forms are delivered to stu
dent residences.
According to law and to in
sure accuracy, each student
must personally fill out an offi
cial United States Government
census form.
Forms must be submitted
through Resident Assistants or
sponsors by Saturday. (Fresh
man women who have recently
found themselves sponsorless
must exert their own initiative
and find some way in which to
dispose of the forms.)
Failure to submit forms is a
violation of the Honor Code.
Fundamental Standard, and So
cial Regulations, as well as a
felony.
