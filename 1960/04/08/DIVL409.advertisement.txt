With old man sun shining brightly
and hotly on Lcland Stanford's Farm,
suggestions for cool and comfortable
leisure activities are welcomed with
great pleasure these days.
The local answer seems to lie
somewhere between Lake Lag and
'Zotts, but actress Silvana Mangano
has another answer—a la the cover
of the April 1 1 LIFE now on the
stands (see below).
Witness Silvana, shorn of lengthy
locks, neatly submerged in a moun
tain pool! This has all the aspects
of a pleasant afternoon.
But it isn't without purpose, and
alas that purpose is not primarily the
attempt to beat the heat. It's all a
part of a new Paramount motion
picture, "Five Branded Women,"
just completed in Italy and Austria.
To the horrors of the five damsels
involved (Vera Miles, Barbara Bel
Ceddes, Carla Cravina, Silvana the
cover girl, and the French treat
Jeanne Moreau) the script has them
making love to enemy soldiers in
the 19*43 Nazi invasion of Yugo
slavia.
As punishment, the script went
on, townspeople cut off their hair
and they were banished from town.
Hollywood, struck by the method
acting kick, pulled off the country's
best five-way haircut in the contin
uing drive for realism. Check the
action in LIFE.
PIONEERS' FEATS. Logical ques
tions in the search for knowledge
might well be "What was the boy
hood of Daniel Boone," or "What
was Mike Fink's lesson to his wife?"
or even "What was the mission of
Johnny Appleseed?"
These are all answered in next
week's LIFE, too, in Part IV of the
Folklore of America series. The epi
sode is entitled "Legendary Feats of
the Pioneers."
In the days when the new Amer
ica spread across the western moun
tains and rivers after the Revolu
tionary War, this land was growing
its first bumper crop of legendary
heroes.
The tales of the chief figures in
this crop are illustrated for LIFE by
James Lcwicki, and the scries spreads
not only across the questions above,
but also on to other talcs of the guile
and ingenuity of slick Yankees and
the South's twice-told variety cen
tering on the legendary riches of
fabulous plantations and the super
stitions of suffering negro slaves.

But it isn't without purpose, and
alas that purpose is not primarily the
attempt to beat the heat. It's all a
part of a new Paramount motion
picture, "Five Branded Women,"
just completed in Italy and Austria.
To the horrors of the five damsels
involved (Vera Miles, Barbara Bel
Ceddes, Carla Cravina, Silvana the
cover girl, and the French treat
Jeanne Moreau) the script has them
making love to enemy soldiers in
the 19*43 Nazi invasion of Yugo
slavia.
As punishment, the script went
on, townspeople cut off their hair
and they were banished from town.
Hollywood, struck by the method
acting kick, pulled off the country's
best five-way haircut in the contin
uing drive for realism. Check the
action in LIFE.
PIONEERS' FEATS. Logical ques
tions in the search for knowledge
might well be "What was the boy
hood of Daniel Boone," or "What
was Mike Fink's lesson to his wife?"
or even "What was the mission of
Johnny Appleseed?"
These are all answered in next
week's LIFE, too, in Part IV of the
Folklore of America series. The epi
sode is entitled "Legendary Feats of
the Pioneers."
In the days when the new Amer
ica spread across the western moun
tains and rivers after the Revolu
tionary War, this land was growing
its first bumper crop of legendary
heroes.
The tales of the chief figures in
this crop are illustrated for LIFE by
James Lcwicki, and the scries spreads
not only across the questions above,
but also on to other talcs of the guile
and ingenuity of slick Yankees and
the South's twice-told variety cen
tering on the legendary riches of
fabulous plantations and the super
stitions of suffering negro slaves.

With old man sun shining brightly
and hotly on Lcland Stanford's Farm,
suggestions for cool and comfortable
leisure activities are welcomed with
great pleasure these days.
The local answer seems to lie
somewhere between Lake Lag and
'Zotts, but actress Silvana Mangano
has another answer—a la the cover
of the April 1 1 LIFE now on the
stands (see below).
Witness Silvana, shorn of lengthy
locks, neatly submerged in a moun
tain pool! This has all the aspects
of a pleasant afternoon.
