ON TO COMFORT. The editors
of LIFE probably didn't mean to
make this a man's issue, but the
facts remain that the article "Bikinis
Move to Bedrooms" combines with
the shorn lassies to make pin-up
material.
Girls, too, will be interested in the
Bikinis bit, though, as it means less
hot, sticky covers at bedtime, and
approaches as close as one can get
to Kim Novak-ism as one dares who
still desires to remain clothed at all.
Anyway, the gist of the whole
thing is that the newest style of
PJ's are in the form of Bikinis—and
the models are pretty nice, too.
THE DIG NIACARA. The biggest
single digging project ever under
taken in the U. S. — and costing
some $720 million — is New York
State's Niagara Power Project, an
attempt to harness the power in the
Niagara River.
Cathedral-like cliffs, monstrous
conduits, and Fritz Coro's photog
raphy all make the spread good
looking.

David, in the process of organizing
his musical group, wants Maiden
form's cellist.
ON THE SERIOUS SIDE. The grim
situation 'which has torn Africa is
treated in an intensely interesting
photo and story piece in the April
1 1 LIFE. The tragedy, three cen
turies in the making, is traced from
its earliest developments.
Cene Farmer, the magazine's for
eign news editor, has prepared the
story which attempts to present all
the issues, furies and worries in
volved in the conflict.
AND STILL MORE. The Astro
nauts, Tiros' weather observations,
a new U. S. legation in Bulgaria,
N. Y. Governor Nelson Rockefeller's
"Fight on Fallout," the $75,000 in
vestment in the voice of young
crooner Rod Lauren, and the talc of
famed killer Robert Stroud, who sees
new hope for freedom, all get the
LIFE treatment in the current issue.

THE DIG NIACARA. The biggest
single digging project ever under
taken in the U. S. — and costing

Cathedral-like cliffs, monstrous

of LIFE probably didn't mean to
make this a man's issue, but the
facts remain that the article "Bikinis
