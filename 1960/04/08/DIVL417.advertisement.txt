WHY SPERRY... ?
When you join the expanding Sperry organization, your future is
unlimited. For nearly fifty years engineers have found at Sperry a company
that keeps pace with their personal development — a place that

and no doubt participate in years to come in the engineering "firsts"
that Sperry is so famous for.
WHAT KIND OF WORK...?
Assignments at Sperry cover every dimension of science — from the electron to s
the outer reaches of space. The projects currently being developed range from \
space flight systems to radar circuit design ... from various system reliability
studies to transistors and infrared. At Sperry you'll work creatively with some of
America's "name" engineers as part of your team — associates that make your
job both stimulating and challenging.
\ WHERE...?
Sperry Gyroscope is located in Great Neck, Long Island in New York. Within an
hour you can be in the heart of New York City to enjoy all the cultural and educational
facilities of the city. And, being located in the suburbs of New York, you work
