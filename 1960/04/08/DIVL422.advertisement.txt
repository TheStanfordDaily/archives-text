CONDUCTED TOURS
ARE NOT FOR MEN
but N. 8.8.5. traveling seminars are.
The sightseeing is done on your own,
but the e:nphasis ol the seminar is on
learning while you see. This is accom
plished through coming in contact with
leading personalities on the European
scene, such as major politicians, jour
nalists, art critics, and other people
that would be inaccessible to the indi
vidual tourist. N. 8.8.5. olfers two of
these traveling seminars: the Renais
sance Tour, which concentrates on all
parts ol Western Europe; and the
Twentieth Century Tour, which exam
ines the aspects of political controversy
in Europe today. Both are designed as
roving summer courses, with lectures
and bull sessions in many educational
centers such as Berlin, Oxford, Rome,
and Paris. Both tours are coed, have a
maximum of 15 college or graduate stu
dents, and travel to Europe and back
on the N. 8.8.5. special student sailings.
Further information readily supplied by
