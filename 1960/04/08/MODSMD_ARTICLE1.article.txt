# Cards, Kansas SJS, Meet in Track Classic
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
Potentially the finest dual meet in America this year will take
place in the Stadium tomorrow at 1:30, when the nation's top two
track teams, Kansas and San Jose, do battle with the Indians.
Crowd estimates range all the way from 10,000 to 25,000 and 1,300
Kansas alumni have reserved seats. So have the Cinder Stompers,;

Stanford's track hand which will
provide entertainment if that's,
what you're looking for.
Classic races are shaping up in ,
the mile, 880 and the dashes as i
Stanford's Ernie Cunliffe will be j
out to make history in the long |
ones and Kansas' Charlie Tidwell
clashes with San Jose's Bobby \
i Poynter in the sprints. The meet
will be scored on a triangular
basis and separate dual scores will
be ke*pt between the three teams, j
The greatest single point of in- ;
, terest in the meet will be Cun
liffe. sAs of now. he is two and |
four-tenths seconds away from a
four 'minute mile and half a sec
ond from the world's record in
Ihe l|alf mile. With the competi
tion he'll get tomorrow either or
both of these marks are distinct |
possibilities.
The mile run is the first track
event on the schedule and the
half-mile is four events later.
The question of whether Cun-

liffe will go for a win in
the four - lapper. in order to
save himself for the 880. or
whether ho will go all out and try
to become this country's second
four-minute mil e r , naturally
arises. An answer i-s provided by
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan:
"Ernie is going to run like he
feels and right now lie feels great.
He'll run wide open if he feels
like it." Draw your own conclu
sions.
Cunliffe's competition in the
mile will be the best he has
faced so far this year. Charlie
Clark for San Jose has run the
mile in the formidable time of
1:09. Cunliffe's running mate,
Bertil Lundh, is no slouch either
with a top time of 4:11.4. Kansas'
contribution to the race will be
Billy Mills, 4:15.7, and Bill Dot
son, 4:10.4.
Then there's the 880. Cunliffe
has already met the Olympic
qualifying time here. He was off
Tom Courtney's world record of
1:46.8 by only half a second last
week at Fresno and is currently
the third fastest half-miler of ail
time. Don Bowden's NCAA rec
ord is 1:47.2, so here is another
possibility.
Cunliffe's competition will also
be much stronger in this event
than it has been so far this sea
son. Indian Norm Lloyd at 1:58.2,
Jay hawks Bobby Tague and Dot
son, at 1:50.9 and 1:54.3 respec-
lively, and Spartan Jerry Howell
al 1:54.4 will all help to make the
race interesting.
111 the 100 yard dash Kansas'
Tidwell and San Jose's Poynter,
who ran 1-2 at the NCAA meet
last year, will probably vie for
the win. Both these boys have
top times of 9.4. Also to be reck
oned with, however, are Willie
Williams for the Sputans, 9.5,
Paul Williams for the Jayhawks,
9.7, and Stanford's Dean Smith,
9.6.
The 220 looks much the same
with the 1-2 finish possibly re
versed. Judging by past perform
ances, Poynter should win this
one, with Tidwell a close second.
Poynter's top time is 20.2 (which
is fast i and Tidwell's best is 20.7
(which is not slow).
220 Good Race
Both Williams will be factors
in the 220 also. San Jose's Willie
has run the distance in 20.5, while
Kansas' Paul has a 21.2 mark.
Bob Bessp will go for the Tribe
and has a best time of 21.0.
Another top race will be the
440. Cliff Cushman for the Jay
hawks seems the favoriate with
his best time of 48.6. Besse and

Dick Lasson, with marks of 47.9
and 48.0, will make it interesting j
from Stanford's point of view a*
will Tim Curtis and Jim Flemons
(47.8 and 48.2) for the Spartans, j
One of the meet's top perform- j
ers will he Bill Alley, Kansas;
javelin thrower, who has flung
the spear nearly 50 feet further '
than anyone else in the meet.
Look for a good mark from Stan
ford's Art Batchelder here,
though, as Art increased his all
time best 20 foot at Fresno lasl
week, and is getting stronger)
every week.
Winters in Shot
Jerry Winters figures to take 1
the shot put for the Indians and
will be out to see if he can im
prove on his best mark of 56-10's.
Charlie Clark for the Spartans j
looks to win the two-mile, but
there is a possibly that John ;
North way may really find himself
and come through with something
big.
Clark's top time is 9:05.3, while
Northway has a best of 9:19.9, but
Nortlnvay'-s time at Fresno last
week was nearly 30 seconds bet
ter than he has ever run and the
possibility that he can still im
prove significantly is a strong
one.
Bill Mills, at 9:06 for Kansas,
and the Tribe's Bob Mon/.ingo, at I

9:10.8, may also give Clark trou
ble.
Tho mile relay will be a close
race as Stanford sends Lassen,

Rich Klier, Lloyd and Besse out
against Curtis, Ray Pena, Flem
ons and Willie Williams and a
j Kansas team yet to be annoucned.
