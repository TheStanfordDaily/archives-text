# Cards, Kansas SJS, Meet in Track Classic
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
Potentially the finest dual meet in America this year will take
place in the Stadium tomorrow at 1:30, when the nation's top two
track teams, Kansas and San Jose, do battle with the Indians.
Crowd estimates range all the way from 10,000 to 25,000 and 1,300
Kansas alumni have reserved seats. So have the Cinder Stompers,;

Stanford's track hand which will
provide entertainment if that's,
what you're looking for.
Classic races are shaping up in ,
the mile, 880 and the dashes as i
Stanford's Ernie Cunliffe will be j
out to make history in the long |
ones and Kansas' Charlie Tidwell
clashes with San Jose's Bobby \
i Poynter in the sprints. The meet
will be scored on a triangular
basis and separate dual scores will
be ke*pt between the three teams, j
The greatest single point of in- ;
, terest in the meet will be Cun
liffe. sAs of now. he is two and |
four-tenths seconds away from a
four 'minute mile and half a sec
ond from the world's record in
Ihe l|alf mile. With the competi
tion he'll get tomorrow either or
both of these marks are distinct |
possibilities.
The mile run is the first track
event on the schedule and the
half-mile is four events later.
The question of whether Cun-

liffe will go for a win in
the four - lapper. in order to
save himself for the 880. or
whether ho will go all out and try
to become this country's second
four-minute mil e r , naturally
arises. An answer i-s provided by
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan:
"Ernie is going to run like he
feels and right now lie feels great.
He'll run wide open if he feels
like it." Draw your own conclu
sions.
Cunliffe's competition in the
mile will be the best he has
faced so far this year. Charlie
Clark for San Jose has run the
mile in the formidable time of
1:09. Cunliffe's running mate,
Bertil Lundh, is no slouch either
with a top time of 4:11.4. Kansas'
contribution to the race will be
Billy Mills, 4:15.7, and Bill Dot
son, 4:10.4.
Then there's the 880. Cunliffe
has already met the Olympic
qualifying time here. He was off
Tom Courtney's world record of
1:46.8 by only half a second last
week at Fresno and is currently
the third fastest half-miler of ail
time. Don Bowden's NCAA rec
ord is 1:47.2, so here is another
possibility.
Cunliffe's competition will also
be much stronger in this event
than it has been so far this sea
son. Indian Norm Lloyd at 1:58.2,
Jay hawks Bobby Tague and Dot
son, at 1:50.9 and 1:54.3 respec-
