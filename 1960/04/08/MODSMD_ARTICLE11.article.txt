out resistance today .
From Cape Town, Durban and
Port Elizabeth came reports that
the situation was practically nor

any tirr.e in the past 10 days.
In Johannesburg there was no
! incident to disturb the calm.
Workers streamed in and out of
j the city without trouble.

leaders in jail it seemed that the
longest demonstration in recent
years against the government's
apartheid -segregation policy
may be ended.
But the government continued
to call up its forces. The Wit

; ment has just been mobilized and
stationed at the airport near Ger
mi.ston, east of Johannesburg.

Broadcasting Corp. interrupted a
play to read out a long list of

Troops and police staged clean
up raids for arms and agitators
j yesterday in the settlements of
Nyanga Township, stronghold of
the African no-work movement.
Weapons Seized
Nearly 200 men and women
were arrested and sacks of wca-
I pons — including guns, clubs,
crowbars, knives and meat axes
were confiscated in Nyanga
, East and Nyanga West outside
Cape Town, an Atlantic port 900
miles southwest of Johannesburg.
A ring of infantrymen with
■ fixed bayonets sealed off the
j settlements, the scene of bloody
clashes Monday when troops and
; police st ruck with clubs, guns and
whips in an effort to get the
Negroes back on their jobs. Scores
were wounded then. There was no
