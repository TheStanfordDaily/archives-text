Saluting Stanford I niversity. the exhibit is "designed to show
more clearly llic challenging times in which we live and how the
Arm\ while standing on the ramparts of freedom —lias kept
pace with the evolution in technology and methods of war. "
Part of the exhibit is devoted to the Army's activities in leach
ing our allies the use of modern methods of war. Among the II
ramparts of freedom which the army has taken under its wing
to educate are Spain, Portugal, Taiwan and South Korea.
One signboard reads "The Free World and the Soviet (llial
lenge Press the button See America's assets ami liabilities." The
assets and liabilities are listed under four convenient points:
• The U.S. relies on the power of truth to influence men's
minds, the I SSR uses massive unremitting propaganda without
regard to truth.
• Forty percent of the U.S. Army is stationed in 73 free world
nations, and Hed aggression has never been committed in these
places.
• The U.S. Army lias 870,000 dedicated and well-trained men
in contrast to two and one-half million trained men in the Soviet
ground forces.
• The free world comprises 38 per cent of world population
and 33 per cent of land area, the Hed s control 33 per cent of the
world population and 27 per cent of the land area.
The statement that "more, rather than less, emphasis on the
role of the infantryman is essential to our nation's survival" indi
cates clearlv that the exhibit is designed for recruiting purposes.
However, one wonders if such recruiting tactics are the best
possible. The time has passed when most Americans will light
out of blind patriotism. Paradox and shades of grav in political
and economic, life in both the USSR and the U.S. have become
all too obvious to a great number of Americans, even potential
infant rynien.
Our assets still outweigh the liabilities of the Soviet Union.
And the U.S. Army is maintained to protect this favorable balance.
But, in order to protect and recruit intelligent Iv, the Armv
ought to give some indication of an understanding of the more
important issues involved in the cold war.
To reduce America's assets and liabilities to four facile phrases,
two of which are mere percentages and figures, is to play games
with the recruit and to walk blindly into the vicinity of "propa
ganda without regard to the truth."
