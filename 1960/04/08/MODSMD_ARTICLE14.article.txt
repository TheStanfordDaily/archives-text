## A 						Look at Nixon 
### Dick White Contributing Editor 
On Monday, Stanford students
will hoar a major address by Vice
President Richard M. Nixon, the
almost certain Republican candi
date for President. It will indeed
bo interesting to hoar this man
who like every other American
boy has had the dream of being
President, but who has antagon
ized almost all the forces which
should be his strongest support
at this time when ho is closest to
his goal.
Most politicians enter govern
ment with a set of principles
which they would like to see ef
fected. Their record throughout
the years is one of supporting
those issues which furthered
their goals and those of their con
stituents and opposing those
measures which did not. When
these men chose to run for office
again, they could point to this
record, and people could examine
those principles which they had
espoused.
Without a Past
However Nixon is trying to run
for President as a man without a
past or at least with a very select
one. When any unpleasant issue
is raised, which Nixon either sup
ported or opposed but always
with vehemence at the time, his
supporters run around wildly
shouting "that was the old Nix
on" and bidding everyone to look
at the new one. One certainly
must consider if any man so er
ratic should guide our nation in
1 his important decade.
Both of our major parties are
divided into liberal and conserva
tive factions. The two intraparty
groups often view each other
with more distrust that mem
bers of the other party and often
there is a greater difference be
tween them. These are the real
divisions in our political sphere,
between liberals and conserva
tives, not Republicans and Demo
crats.

It is impossible to assume that
any politician as adept as Nixon
does not recognize this division,
and yet he freely crosses over
and has in the past made frequent
major policy changes. Perhaps
he believes himself larger than
any mere political boundaries.
Many Friends
However these acts have cost
Nixon many friends. The con
l servatives, whom he once identi
fied with, have now been deserted
and feel no love for his tactics.
The liberals whom he is trying
to join, do not trust him and have
no reason to believe he would not
desert them if a more appealing
cause appeared. Nixon's juggling
of ideals has not increased his
stature.
Nixon has been on the Eisen
hower team for eight years but
in this time has never really
seemed to achieve the stature of
the second man in American poli
tics. He has been used for the
dirty world of the campaigns and
only recently been given an op
portunity to show his other tal
j ents.
We all are aware that Nixon
settled the steel strike even
though it could have been ended
at any time the administration
wished to exert pressure on the
companies. Nixon gave qualified
'support to the Forand Bill for
medical aid to the aged, but in
| this he went too far, for Eisen
-1 hower declared the proposal un
favorable. Nixon, the master dip
lomat, has traveled the world
over with startling unsuccess, ex
cept of course for Poland.
Political Leader
Nixon is now trying to be a
political leader but is not being
given the authority. To add to the
long list of people who do not
trust Nixon's advice of judgment,
we cannot write the Eisenhower
; administration.
Nixon is coming to Stanford on
I Monday. We should all go out to
'see for ourselves this man who
may be President.
