Mr. Nixon, who does not try to
| deceive himself, has admitted
publicly that "wo are in for the
j fight of our lives." To be elected
! he needs to be, as was Eisenhower
: in 1952 and 1956. much stronger
than the Republican party. He
cannot hope to win if all he gets
are the regular Republican votes.
Yet it is not at all clear how he
is going to get enough Demo
cratic and independent votes to
| put him ahead of what his party
can poll for Congress and for the
governorships.
These hard facts have led to
all ihe talk about his taking a
stand beyond Eisenhower's on
such vote-getting measures as
Federal aid to education and med
ical care for the aged. As the
President himself put ii the other
I day, he is "so fortunate" that he
doesn't "have to go any further
i with this thing" (i.e., being Presi
dent of the United States). If,
said the President, ho himself
were running again, he too
"would be looking for new ways
[and directions." Since it is Mr.
Nixon who is doing the running,
; Mi . Nixon would be "very fool
ish" if he did not look for new
ways and directions.
Where is .Air. Nixon to look for
new ways and directions? There
is only one place that he can look.
That is in the field already occu
pied and pre-empted among Re
publicans by Gov. Rockefeller. In
matters of defense, of social wel
fare, and of public finance, this
field is also occupied by the Dem
ocrats. While the issue is sharp
and fundamental as between Ei
senhower and the leading Demo
crats, there is no real issue in this
matter between Rockefeller and
the Democrats.
Mr. Nixon's problem is to de
cide how far he can move into the
Rockefeller-Democratic field in
order to make up for the fact that
the Republicans are a minority
party.
This is not an easy problem for
Mr. Nixon to solve. To begin
with, professional politicians who
control the leading Republican or
| ganizations in the states were
powerful enough to force Rocke
feller to withdraw. They are not
i going to allow Nixon to adopt
many of Rockefeller's ideas. For
I these professional politicians, we
must remember, would rather
lose the election than lose their
I own power in the party hierar
chy. They would rather lose with
the Nixon they know than win
with a quasi-Democrat like Rocke'
feller.
They do not put it this way.-
They rationalize their extreme
conservatism and their unpopu
larity by arguing, as they did
when they tfieri to prevent the
nomination of Eisenhower in
1952, that there is a great hidden
majority in the country. This
hidden majority consists of a
large number of people who do
not vote. They stay at home be
cause they are waiting for a Re
publican candidate who belongs
to the extreme right. Men like
Sen. Bridges and Sen. Goldwater
really believe that the more the
Republican party follows their
leadership, the more stay-at-home
Republican voters will come to
the polls.
Tills is an extraordinary fan
tasy, rather like that of thirsty
men in a desert who see mirages
of green oases with plenty of wa
ter. Mr. Nixon, we may be sure,
does not believe in this political
mirage, lie knows that to win
the election he must win a large
pari of the Eisenhower Demo
crats and Eisenhower independ
ents. Itut in trying to win them,
lie must be careful not to drive
the Bridges and the Goldwaters
into open rebellion.
It is hard to see how Mr. Nixon
can do anything else but run, not
only on the Eisenhower record
but also on the Eisenhower phi
losophy. Whatever may be said
of the record, he will find the
Eisenhower philosophy a heavy
liability. For Gen Eisenhower's
conception of Federal responsibil
ity and the public need is in grow
ing conflict with the realities of

our time. His philosophy does not
fit, indeed it stands in the way of,
an adequate American response
to the challenge of the Soviet
Union. His philosophy, moreover,
is in collision with the imperative
needs of our highly industrial
ized, highly iirhani'/.cd, mass so
ciety.
Yet Mr. Nixon must defend and
profess to believe in the Eisen
hower philosophy, or he may
arouse the sharp displeasure of
ihe President himself. At the
same time, it is impossible that
Mr. Nixon fully believes in the
President's philosophy if for no
other reason than that he is a
young man who lives in the pres
ent and not in the very distant
past.
Barring unforeseen develop
ments or an act id' God, Mr. Nix
on's difficulties — which arise
from the contrast between the re
ality and the philosophy which he
inherits —will grow worse. This
may well be reflected in the pedis
and if this happens, if the polls
become more and more sinister,
Mr. Roscoe Driimmond may prove
to have been a true prophet when
he said on Monday that Gov.
Rockefeller "is not to be ruled
out."
