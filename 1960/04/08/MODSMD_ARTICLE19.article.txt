Ktfitor, Ili«* Daily:
I applaud yesterday's editorial
which criticized our free-reined
student legislature for its con
sistent refusal to concern itself
with vital off-campus issues.
Perhaps the editorial might
have used a few more examples.
Why didn't our student govern
ment at least attempt an official
stand on the capital punishment
issue? What was our student
government doing when USC and
Cal were o rg a n i /. in g strikes
against the stores refusing to
wait on Negroes?
The point is this: The student
body is not apathetic about po
litical issues. (Did you see the
line to get tickets to Nixon's ad
dress?) Rather, student govern
ment has not had the imagination
to turn the "supreme policy mak
ing power" of the Legislature in
a really meaningful direction to
prompt thought and discussion on
matters of more intrinsic impor
tance than bicycles on Inner
Quad.
