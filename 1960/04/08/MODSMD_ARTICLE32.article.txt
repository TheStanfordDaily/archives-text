Coach Pete Kmetovic's Stan
ford rugby team enplaned yester
day for West Point, N.Y., where
the Indians will meet Dartmouth's
ruggers in a nationally televised

clined to play.
The match will be played at
West Point Saturday and video
taped to be telecast as one in a
series of CBS' Sports Spectacular
programs Sunday on KPIX (chan
nel 5) at three o'clock.
The Indians' 17-man team took
its last workout Wednesday and
looked to be in top shape for the
contest with the Greenies.
Leading the way for the Cards
is hooker, Kyrk Reid, the team's
leading scorer with 55 points in
11 games. Among the forwards.
John Thomas and John Clark

promise to be extra-tough, and
Armand Jaques and Sig Garber
are expected to dazzle the Ivy
Leaguers with their backfield an
t ics.
Others on the traveling squad
include Don Peter, Gary Pike,
Doug Purcell, Dick Takaki, Dave
Scholz, Rick McMillen, Dale Os
-1 lander, Tony Dingman, Hod
Sears, Phil Toorvald, Cap Ing
ham, and Pete Bedford.
This will be the second time
around for the two teams. In a
match played earlier this month,
Stanford edged the Green by a
5-3 margin during the easterners'
tour of the Bay Area.
