# Palmer Leads in Masters
## 
### 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (/P) Arnold
Palmer, who usually saves his
best for the last, got off to a Ire
mendous start in the 24th Mas
ters Golf Tournament Thursday
helped by a favorable ruling on
the same hole where his strongest
rival, Ken Venturi, came a crop
per.
Palmer, the 19.18 Masters win
ner from Ligonier, Pa., shot an
opening round of 33-34 f>7, five
under par for the big, crowded
Augusta national course, to take
a two-stroke lead at the end of
the first day.
It was a ruling on the 12th hole,
a short pitch over a creek, that
set Venturi stumbling. On the
same hole, Palmer was given the
benefit of a free lift and made his
par while Venturi hacked out a
double bogey five. From there on
Ken was just about sunk and he
took bogeys on four of the re
maining six holes while blowing
to a 42 on the last nine.
Two -strokes behind Palmer at
the finish were four players who
hadn't figured much in the pre

tournament calculations former
Champion Claude Harmon, Fred
Hawkins, former PGA Champion
Dow Finsterwald, and Jay Helierl.
England's Hairy Weetman,
young Don January of Denver
and amateur Dr. Frank Bud Tay
lor from Pomona, Calif., had 70s.
Deane Beman, the young British
Amateur champion from Beihes
da, Md., bogeyed the last two
holes and lied at 71 with U.S.
Open Champion Bill Casper and
California's Gene Littler.
