# BRONCO DOUBLEHEADER TOMORROW
## Card Nine Takes on Bruins 
### Roy Schmidt 
Stanford's varsity baseball team, showing signs of breaking
out of its batting slump, host the UCLA Bruins on the Sunken
Diamond this afternoon at 3:1.">. Tomorrow they travel to Santa
Clara for a twin bill beginning at 1 p.m.
The Indians who had dropped five in a row earlier, have managed

to take narrow victories in their
last two games. One bright sign
is the hitting of second baseman
Mike MaGee, who has smacked
three hits in his last six trips
to the plate.
The chunky junior, who had a
good season at the plate last year
with a .283 average, has been
having his troubles this year. His
recent switch from catcher to
second hasn't helped any because
MaGee prefers the 1 receiving
chores.
The. hitting load thus far this
season has been carried on the
shoulders of third baseman Jim
Burk and shortstop Skip Law
rence. Burk is the only Indian
hitting the long ball and has com
piled 12 RBl's.
Lawrence was a pleasant sur
prise for coach Dutch Fehring.
The sophomore infielder got his
chance when MaGee was moved
behind the plate leaving second
base vacant. Now he has been
moved to shortstop and is coming
into his own.
Coach Fehring, who is under
standably concerned about his
club's hitting punch, expects first
baseman Lee Moench and out

fielder John Hurlbut to catch fire.
"Both of those boys are proven
college hitters," he says.
Marv Mecklenberg is slated to
toe the mound against the Bruins
this afternoon. The big right
bander went the route last week
end against San Jose, but poor
support cost him a 1-3 loss. He
gave up only five hits and struck
out eight.
Jim Smith, a promising sopho
more faces Santa Clara in the
first game Saturday. Playing his
first full season of baseball, Smith
has shown great promise. The
young righthander held the Jap
anese AU-Stars to one earned
run and five hits in his last ap
pearance.
Lefty Terry Lindeman will
work the second game for the
Indians. Lindeman lias been im
proving with each game and held
the Cal Aggies to two runs and
six hits earlier this week.
UCLA caught the Indians in the
midst of its batting slump and
handed the Card contingent its
first loss in CIBA play earlier this
season.
