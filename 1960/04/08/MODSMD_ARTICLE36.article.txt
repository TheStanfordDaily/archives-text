# Tennismen Battle Strong SC, UCLA in Southland
## 
### John Schwarz 
Lamar Tech, the number one
college tennis team in the coun
try, defeated Stanford's netters
two weeks ago 7-2. This weekend
Stanford will have the pleasure
of meeting the number two and
three tennis teams in the country
UCLA and USC -in t hat smog
ridden city in Southern Califor
nia.
This afternoon Coach Bob Ren
ker's Indians will be at Westwood
to play the UCLA Bruin team,
and tomorrow morning at the Los
Angeles Tennis Club, Stanford
meets USC.
The Bruins are heavily stocked
this year, as they have been every
year for the past several seasons,
with many experienced, nation
ally ranked stars.
Larry Nagler, an import to Cali
lornia from New York and the
number 24th ranking player in
the nation, is the Bruin's big gun.
He is probably the most experi
enced sophomore any coach will
ever lie blessed with.
Right behind Nagler is Allen
Fox, first man on last year's
UCLA team and a Bruin junior.
Oddly enough Fox, the number
two man, is more highly ranked
nationally than Nagler. the num
ber one man. being tabbed as the
number 17 player in this year's
national listings.
Besides Nagler and Fox UCLA
boasts of Roger Werksman, num
ber 25 in the nation, Forrest Stew
art, Norm Perry, and Bruce
Campbell.
The USC Trojans do not have
as many ranked players but their
roster includes a wide variety of
highly regarded stars. Greg
Grant, Dick Leach and A 1 Tong,
are back from last year's squad
while Ed Atkinson, out last year,
is back from USC's national
champions of two years ago.
Rounding out the Trojan squad
is Rafael Osuna a sophomore
from Mexico, tabbed by some as
the next Alex Olmedo.
Stanford will send seven play
ers to Los Angeles: Dick Ogden,
Jim Jeffries, Dick Gould, George
Bates, Dick Mosk, Gil Ranney and
Tim Arnstein. The first six will
probably see action in the one
through six spots respectively

with possible Arnstein seeing
some doubles action.
The big question mark for the
Indians will be depth. The Los
Angeleans have top notch and
proven talent all the way down
the line while Stanford's corps
reach the green stage past Jeff
ries.
Perhaps the most significant
outcome of the weekend's play
will be the manner in which Og
den and Jeffries handle I hem
selves. National and AAWU tour
naments at the conclusion of the
season are based primarily on the
play of a team's top players. If
Ogden and Jeffries fare well
against what is close to the cream
of the college crop then Stanford
may have hopes in the post sea
son national and sectional tour
neys despite their total learn defi
ciencies.

The Bruins are heavily stocked
this year, as they have been every
year for the past several seasons,
with many experienced, nation
ally ranked stars.
Larry Nagler, an import to Cali
lornia from New York and the
number 24th ranking player in
the nation, is the Bruin's big gun.
He is probably the most experi
enced sophomore any coach will
ever lie blessed with.
Right behind Nagler is Allen
Fox, first man on last year's
UCLA team and a Bruin junior.
Oddly enough Fox, the number
two man, is more highly ranked
nationally than Nagler. the num
ber one man. being tabbed as the
number 17 player in this year's
national listings.
Besides Nagler and Fox UCLA
boasts of Roger Werksman, num
ber 25 in the nation, Forrest Stew
art, Norm Perry, and Bruce
Campbell.
The USC Trojans do not have
as many ranked players but their
roster includes a wide variety of
highly regarded stars. Greg
Grant, Dick Leach and A 1 Tong,
are back from last year's squad
while Ed Atkinson, out last year,
is back from USC's national
champions of two years ago.
Rounding out the Trojan squad
is Rafael Osuna a sophomore
from Mexico, tabbed by some as
the next Alex Olmedo.
Stanford will send seven play
ers to Los Angeles: Dick Ogden,
Jim Jeffries, Dick Gould, George
Bates, Dick Mosk, Gil Ranney and
Tim Arnstein. The first six will
probably see action in the one
through six spots respectively

with possible Arnstein seeing
some doubles action.
The big question mark for the
Indians will be depth. The Los
Angeleans have top notch and
proven talent all the way down
the line while Stanford's corps
reach the green stage past Jeff
ries.
Perhaps the most significant
outcome of the weekend's play
will be the manner in which Og
den and Jeffries handle I hem
selves. National and AAWU tour
naments at the conclusion of the
season are based primarily on the
play of a team's top players. If
Ogden and Jeffries fare well
against what is close to the cream
of the college crop then Stanford
may have hopes in the post sea
son national and sectional tour
neys despite their total learn defi
ciencies.
Lamar Tech, the number one
college tennis team in the coun
try, defeated Stanford's netters
two weeks ago 7-2. This weekend
Stanford will have the pleasure
of meeting the number two and
three tennis teams in the country
UCLA and USC -in t hat smog
ridden city in Southern Califor
nia.
This afternoon Coach Bob Ren
ker's Indians will be at Westwood
to play the UCLA Bruin team,
and tomorrow morning at the Los
Angeles Tennis Club, Stanford
meets USC.
