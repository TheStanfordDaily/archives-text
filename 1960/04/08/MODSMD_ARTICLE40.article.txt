# Stanford Crew Hosts Loyola, Long Beach St.
## 
### 
The Stanford crew plays host
to Long Beach State and Loyola
tomorrow in their second home
encounter. All three Stanford
crews will compete on the 2000
meter sprint course.
The races will be held at the
Redwood City yacht harbor and
are scheduled for 9:00, 9:30 and
10 a.m. The JV's will lead off and
will be followed by the frosh and
varsity.
Stanford's varsity has had
tough luck so far this year losing
their first two encounters by nar
row margins to Oregon State and
Southern Cal. Long Beach and
Loyola have not been noted for
their powerful crews and should
not be strong contenders on the
West Coast.
There has been some wonder
out at the Stanford boat house
whether either Long Beach or
Loyola is definitely coming up to
race tomorrow. No work has been
heard from either team since
the schedule was made out two
months ago. Arrangements have
been made for the race, and if
either team is here there will be
action on the Bay.
The next Stanford crew race
will be with UCLA at Redwood
City April 23.
