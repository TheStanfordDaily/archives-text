BERKELEY. Calif. (Special)
Heated debate on a far-reaching
catch-all disarmament plan
hacked by Stanford's United King
dom delegation was suspended
late last nigh) until this morning
at the Model United Nations con
ference here.
The political, and security com
mittee which took up discussion
of the proposal, offered by Cana
da and the United States, was a
climax to a day of animated de
bate on all of the nine M.U.N, or
ganizations.
Disarmament resolutions would
apply to the four present atomic
powers and to any nation which
might later come under any one
of its conditions.
Modeled After Geneva
Modeled after the various plans
now under consideration at Ge
neva, the resolution:
1. Says "A state plan for con
ventional and nuclear disarma
ment should be carried out . . .
under controls,"
2. Calls for setting up of an
international disarmament or
ganization, composed of security
council members, which would
supervise, control and inspect
arms.
3. Calls on the four nuclear
powers to halt all nuclear test
ing. The four nations would
pledge not to explode any nuclear
devices underground during this
moratorium. Period.
Limit Military Forces
The resolution also would limit
military forces for all nations to
a maximum of 2'a million.
"A ban on the use of space
vehicles for nuclear weapons"
and an end to the production of
all types of nuclear weapons ait 1
in the bill.
Jim Gerwick and Jonnct Kerns,
Stanford's committee representa
tives, managed, after a lengthy
and sometimes bitter debate, to
get the bill placed first on the
committee's agenda.

Should the resolution be ap
proved, it, as all other resolutions
approved in committees, would go
to the General Assembly for de
bate when that body meets tomor
row.
Action Against Africa
In other action during the day,
a special political committee
passed by six votes a resolution
calling for economic sanctions
against the Union of South Africa
if its apartheid policies continue.
This bill, however, appears to
have little chance <|112 being ap
proved by the General Assembly,
since one or two of the blocs of
nations plan to vote against it or
abstain from voting.
Todd Stewart. Bob Savior and
Barbara Baer, the Stanford dele
gation to the Security Council,
moved fast in the Council to de
feat an Ecuadorian resolution
dealing with the South African
crisis.
This bill would have had the
UN Secretary-General personally
investigate the "explosive condi
tions" in South Africa and report
to the Security Council, which
would then act to prevent "inter
racial friction from aggravating
the peace of the world."
Recommend France Negotiate
The Political and Security Com
mittee had an Afro-Asian bloc
resolution recommending that
France negotiate immediately
with ihe Algerian rebels to seek
a solution to the Algerian light
ing.
A blow to France, the bill also
would empower the Secretary-
General,, in cooperation with the
two sides, to establish machinery
"so that the people of Algeria
may decide on the future status
of their country."
Deanna Smith and Bernard
Raxlen, Stanford delegates to the
Social, Humanitarian and Cultu
ral Committee, succeeded in get
ting their resolution concerning
the resettlement of Arab refugees
passed.

Tom Gompertz, a University
delegate to the Economic and So
cial Council, was elected chair
man of that group another
feather in the top hat of "Her
Majesty's Government," as the
United Kingdom is called here.
( liairman on Radio
Bob Say lor, the delegation
chairman, can be heard tonight
on KNBC radio between 9:30 and
10 p.m. He will be a member of
the panel discussion concerning
the South African. Red Chinese
