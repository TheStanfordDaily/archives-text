## De Gaulle Applauded In Britain 
### 
LONDON (/P) — President
Charles De Gaulle won the grow
ing ovation of his triumphant
visit to Britain yesterday with a
call for an end to the nuclear
arms race.
France, he said, desires above
all that nuclear weapons be de
stroyed and the "vehicles of
death" that carry them be placed
under surveillance. And she be
lieves that East and West can live
in peace together.
Brilliant Oratory
De Gaulle's speech combined
the stuff of history with oratory
perhaps unmatched since Win
ston Churchill roused the free
world to action 20 years ago.
Churchill, 85 and feeble now, was
there to honor his wartime ally
yesterday.
De Gaulle, tall and vigorous in
sober morning dress, stood before
a silk covered throne on the gray
stone steps that fill one end of
Westminister Hall. Scarlet-robed
Beefeaters from the Tower of
London flanked him as an honor
guard. A fanfare from trumpe
ters in medieval dress introduced
his speech.
Hardly a Glance
The soldier - president spoke
with hardly a glance at his notes
for 30 minutes. By an oratorical
tour de force he contrived to end
just as the 900-year-old hall vi
brated with the last stroke of
noon from the great bell of Big
Ben.
The audience — members of
both houses of Britain's Parlia
ment —sat a moment in silence as
though stunned. Then they burst
into a roar of applause that last
ed a full four minutes.
Common Destiny
De Gaulle's theme was that
Britain and France have a com
mon destiny to work for peace.
It brought him to this statement
of French aims:
"France believes that this peace
can be attained only if the gen
oral fear of sudden annihilation
is first removed.
This invades the limitation and
camps.
"She, France, wishes above all
that stocks of nuclear weapons be
destroyed, that installations
where they are made be used for
other purposes, that rockets and
aircraft capable of carrying them,
as well as the fixed or floating
bases from which these vehicles
of death can be launched, be
placed under surveillance."

mon destiny to work for peace.
It brought him to this statement
of French aims:
"France believes that this peace
can be attained only if the gen
oral fear of sudden annihilation
is first removed.
This invades the limitation and
camps.
"She, France, wishes above all
that stocks of nuclear weapons be
destroyed, that installations
where they are made be used for
other purposes, that rockets and
aircraft capable of carrying them,
as well as the fixed or floating
bases from which these vehicles
of death can be launched, be
placed under surveillance."
LONDON (/P) — President
Charles De Gaulle won the grow
ing ovation of his triumphant
visit to Britain yesterday with a
call for an end to the nuclear
arms race.
France, he said, desires above
all that nuclear weapons be de
stroyed and the "vehicles of
death" that carry them be placed
under surveillance. And she be
lieves that East and West can live
in peace together.
Brilliant Oratory
De Gaulle's speech combined
the stuff of history with oratory
perhaps unmatched since Win
ston Churchill roused the free
world to action 20 years ago.
Churchill, 85 and feeble now, was
there to honor his wartime ally
yesterday.
De Gaulle, tall and vigorous in
sober morning dress, stood before
a silk covered throne on the gray
stone steps that fill one end of
Westminister Hall. Scarlet-robed
Beefeaters from the Tower of
London flanked him as an honor
guard. A fanfare from trumpe
ters in medieval dress introduced
his speech.
Hardly a Glance
The soldier - president spoke
with hardly a glance at his notes
for 30 minutes. By an oratorical
tour de force he contrived to end
just as the 900-year-old hall vi
brated with the last stroke of
noon from the great bell of Big
Ben.
The audience — members of
both houses of Britain's Parlia
ment —sat a moment in silence as
though stunned. Then they burst
into a roar of applause that last
ed a full four minutes.
Common Destiny
De Gaulle's theme was that
Britain and France have a com
mon destiny to work for peace.
It brought him to this statement
of French aims:
"France believes that this peace
can be attained only if the gen
oral fear of sudden annihilation
is first removed.
This invades the limitation and
camps.
"She, France, wishes above all
that stocks of nuclear weapons be
destroyed, that installations
where they are made be used for
other purposes, that rockets and
aircraft capable of carrying them,
as well as the fixed or floating
bases from which these vehicles
of death can be launched, be
placed under surveillance."
