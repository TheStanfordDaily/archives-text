### Ron Rapoport 
The University of Kansas
picked up the marbles in the
triangular meet with Stanford
and San Jose State in the Stadium
Saturday, but they had to hustle
lo do it.
Final triangular scoring showed
the Jayhawks winning by a point
over the Spartans and by 10 over
the Indians; 58-57-47. Dual scor
ing showed Kansas beating San
Jose 67-63, Kansas beating the
Tribe 67-61 and San Jose beating
Stanford 71-60.
The meet went down to the re
lay as far as San Jose and Kansas
were concerned and only when
the Spartans, who were favored
to take the relay, came in last
instead, did Kansas come out
on top.
Tense Moment
Ernie Cunliffe gave the crowd
of 11,000 a tense moment in his
battle with the four-minute mile,
lie ended up with a 4:02.3 mark,
the fastest mile run in the Unit
ed States this year. Cunliffe
finished the first lap in 58.5 and
when the two-lap time was an
nounced at 1:58.5, the crowd came
to its feet in anticipation of some
thing big.
The time for three laps was
4:00.6 and by then Cunliffe was
100 yards ahead of the pack and
going for the 4 minute mark. His
final kick failed to give him what
he was after, but his mark is still
a new Stadium and Stanford'
record. The season is still young'
and Ernie is getting faster.


BILL ALLEY
Jawliawker takes javelin with 200-11 mark
Kansas' Bill Dotson finished
second with San Joso's Charlie
Clark only a whisker behind.
Both were timed in 4:09.5, the
best time ever for both boys.
Stanford's Bertil Lundh also ran
the best mile of his Stanford
career in 4:10.9, but had to settle
for fourth place.
In the 880 Cunliffe was boxed
in on the first lap and didn't have
enough steam left to recover. He
finished third. Stanford's Norm
Lloyd led the race until the final
straightaway only to be caught by
Jay hawk Bobby Tague. Taguo's
winning time was 1:51.6.
Billy Alley, Kansas' reco r d
shattering javelin thrower, gave
a marvelous performance, draw
ing exclamations of disbelief from
the crowd, by sailing the spear
high into the air. Several times
it looked as if the javelin was
going to fly off the field and
Alley's best throw for the after
noon was 2(50-11. Art' Batehelder
came through with his all-time
best for the Indians with a toss
of 223-5 to take second place.
The sprint duels between Bobby

Poynter for San Jose and Charlie
Tidwell for Kansas ended in a
measure of glory for Poynter.
Bobby ran the 100 in 9.5, only
a hair ahead of Tyiwell's 9.6 and
Spartan Willie Williams' 9.7.
In the 220 Poynter, Tidwell and
Williams were all timed in 21.4,
but the win was given to Poynter,
with Tidwell second and Williams
third.
The happiest surprise of the
afternoon for Stanford came when
Dean Smith won the 220 low
hurdles. Smith won with a time
of 24.0 followed by Darwin Ash
bough for Kansas and Mickey
Machamer for San Jose.
John Kelly came through with
another of his clutch perform
ances in the broad jump as he
tied San Jose's Mac Burton on
his last jump at 24-4 ;! 4. Burton
had one more jump after Kelly,
but fouled.
The two-mile was a real thriller
with Clark and Billy Mills of
Kansas running shoulder to
shoulder the entire time until
Clark put on a final sprint to win
in 9.12. Mills was right behind in
9.12.2 and Stanford's John North
way finished third in 9:36.7.
