## Cunliffe Wins Mile With 4:02.3 Mark 
### Ron Rapoport 
The University of Kansas
picked up the marbles in the
triangular meet with Stanford
and San Jose State in the Stadium
Saturday, but they had to hustle
lo do it.
Final triangular scoring showed
the Jayhawks winning by a point
over the Spartans and by 10 over
the Indians; 58-57-47. Dual scor
ing showed Kansas beating San
Jose 67-63, Kansas beating the
Tribe 67-61 and San Jose beating
Stanford 71-60.
The meet went down to the re
lay as far as San Jose and Kansas
were concerned and only when
the Spartans, who were favored
to take the relay, came in last
instead, did Kansas come out
on top.
Tense Moment
Ernie Cunliffe gave the crowd
of 11,000 a tense moment in his
battle with the four-minute mile,
lie ended up with a 4:02.3 mark,
the fastest mile run in the Unit
ed States this year. Cunliffe
finished the first lap in 58.5 and
when the two-lap time was an
nounced at 1:58.5, the crowd came
to its feet in anticipation of some
thing big.
The time for three laps was
4:00.6 and by then Cunliffe was
100 yards ahead of the pack and
going for the 4 minute mark. His
final kick failed to give him what
he was after, but his mark is still
a new Stadium and Stanford'
record. The season is still young'
and Ernie is getting faster.
