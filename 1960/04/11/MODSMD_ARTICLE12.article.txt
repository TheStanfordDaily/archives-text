# The 						Best Chance

### 
Stanford I niversity lias today as an honored guest the man
who, at the moment, seems to have the hest chance of being
elected the next President of the United Stales.
Most of the polls and political second guessers have concluded
that, unless something happens to change the voters present alti
tude. Kichard Nixon will come out first in the November contest.
It cannot lie denied lhat Mr. Nixon is one of the most experi
enced Nice Presidents this country has had. He has been called
upon ui au v times to head 11 ie government when the President lias
been ill or out of the country. He has been told and consulted
about goyernment policies and secrets, in contrast to former Nice
Presidents such as Harrv Truman, who was not informed of the
possibility til an atomic bomb until after lie became President.
Mr. Nixon has sat in on Cabinet and National Security (.ouncil
meetings and has been in the middle of policy making and im
p lenient ing.
lie has been outspoken about his ideas and lias held to his
beliefs with a sincerity which must be recognized. Although the
job of N ice President is not one suited for great accomplishments,
Nlr. Nixou has done lhat job y\cll and v\ i 111 an interest lacking
iu many of his predecessors.
I here are some people, particularly in California, who cannot
or have not yvanted to forget circumstances surrounding Mr. Nix
on s campaigns for Congress in 1946 and 1950. Ihe issues of those
campaigns have been distorted by time, and most of the accusa
tions which are still cited have been proved wrong or never been
found lo he valid.
M;iny of I he people who are still embroiled in the emotionalism
surrounding those two campaigns have refused to look ;il Mr. Nix
on's record of the last eight years and have condemned him yv it li
on I consideration of liis work or the stands he has taken during
his \ ice Presidency.
N\ e hope that this country's voters forget unsubstantiated ap
paritions and lake a good, long look at the issues and the qualifi
cations of the candidates. Under these considerations, we feel
Mr. Nixon deserves and will retain his position of having the best
chance for Ihe job.

Mr. Nixon deserves and will retain his position of having the best
chance for Ihe job.
Stanford I niversity lias today as an honored guest the man
who, at the moment, seems to have the hest chance of being
elected the next President of the United Stales.
Most of the polls and political second guessers have concluded
that, unless something happens to change the voters present alti
tude. Kichard Nixon will come out first in the November contest.
It cannot lie denied lhat Mr. Nixon is one of the most experi
enced Nice Presidents this country has had. He has been called
upon ui au v times to head 11 ie government when the President lias
been ill or out of the country. He has been told and consulted
about goyernment policies and secrets, in contrast to former Nice
Presidents such as Harrv Truman, who was not informed of the
possibility til an atomic bomb until after lie became President.
Mr. Nixon has sat in on Cabinet and National Security (.ouncil
meetings and has been in the middle of policy making and im
p lenient ing.
lie has been outspoken about his ideas and lias held to his
beliefs with a sincerity which must be recognized. Although the
job of N ice President is not one suited for great accomplishments,
Nlr. Nixou has done lhat job y\cll and v\ i 111 an interest lacking
iu many of his predecessors.
I here are some people, particularly in California, who cannot
or have not yvanted to forget circumstances surrounding Mr. Nix
on s campaigns for Congress in 1946 and 1950. Ihe issues of those
campaigns have been distorted by time, and most of the accusa
tions which are still cited have been proved wrong or never been
found lo he valid.
M;iny of I he people who are still embroiled in the emotionalism
surrounding those two campaigns have refused to look ;il Mr. Nix
on's record of the last eight years and have condemned him yv it li
on I consideration of liis work or the stands he has taken during
his \ ice Presidency.
N\ e hope that this country's voters forget unsubstantiated ap
paritions and lake a good, long look at the issues and the qualifi
cations of the candidates. Under these considerations, we feel
Mr. Nixon deserves and will retain his position of having the best
chance for Ihe job.
