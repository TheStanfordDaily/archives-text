It is lime again for the student body's brief annual recognition
of the existence of student government at Stanford ASSU elec
tions.
Hopefully, this year's show will prove more than a popularity
contest. Il must if student body olives are to appear worthwhile
to anyone hul those holding them.
Perhaps student government is not obsolete at Stanford. But
its presence is rarel\ fell, lis functions are uncertain and its aims
obscure. If student government has an important role to play
in the Stanford community, we look to I his year's candidates to
define it.
We wish to pose to the candidates the question "\\ by? \\ by
are you a,candidate? Why do you support student government?
\\ hv isn't its importance more widely recognized?
These are not rhetorical questions. They warrant serious con
sideration. I rom their answers could arise issues ol real signifi
cance to the student body.
The Daily will undertake to present issues upon which il feels
the candidates should take a stand. Hiowever, those running for
office should he prepared to present issues they feel to be of im
portance. Candidacy should not be based on interest alone. It
needs the support of constructive ideas.
A campaign of issues and ideas rather than one of personali
ties would he unique. There is even the possibility that student
government could become a matter of student concern.
