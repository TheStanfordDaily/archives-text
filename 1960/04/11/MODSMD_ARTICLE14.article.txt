The Other Side
Kditor, the Daily:
In the editorial last week the
Daily criticized the Legislature's
reluctance to take a stand on off
campus issues. As members of
LASSU we feel that a few im
portant points have been ignored.
First of all, what would be the
possible results of Legislature
devoting itself to these issues?
1 i It would provide interesting
copy and promote the distribution
of the campus newspaper. 2) Leg
islature's name would appear
more often in the great metropoli
tan newspapers of the area. 3) An
interesting diversion would he
provided for those persons active
in student affairs who are bored
with campus problems.
BUT ... the opinion of LASSU
concerning issues not related to
studenl affairs would rarely help
resolve them.
Moreover, the more time Legis
lature spends on problems re
moved from the student commun
ity, the less is spent in the area
of campus affairs. The members

of Legislature were elected to
deal primarily in this area.
However, Legislature is willing
to consider carefully any particu
lar issue, and if it feels that there
is real value to be derived from
taking a stand on this particular
issue, it will certainly do so.
Evidently, the student Legisla
ture. in its present form, cannot
live up to Ihe expactation of the
Daily editor. In order to be able
to serve two functions well (cam
pus government and national is
sues) some change musl bo marie.
We hope that the Daily will pro
pose some interesting solution,
and along this line we present the
following suggestion:
Split LASSU into two parts. The
first part would be similar to the
present body, concerned with stu
dent affairs; the second would
meet in place of the Tuesday eve
ning series, discussing any issues,
and providing this university
with its most sensational press
releases of the century all in
the name of the student body.
