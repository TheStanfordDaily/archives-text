# Nixon Has Expressed Views on Issues, Is Strong Fighter for Republicanism
## 
### Craig Barnes 
In eight years tlie Vice Presi
dency of the United States has
become important. Richard Nix
on, who has made i! so, is prob
ably the most controversial figure
in American politics today. He
has dealt in the soft under belly
of politics, in party coordination
and compromise, and for i his has
been accused of being true to
neither his party, his ideals, nor
himself.
'Although, on the record, he has
traveled more as the personal rep
resentative of his chief, attended
more meetings in the same capac
ity, and acted as major partici
pant. in more policy formation
committees than probably any
Vice President before him, there
remains about him the image of
a vacillating politician. Ironically,
no man since Truman has seemed
to be such a fighter for his party,
and similarly none other has
raised such divisive debate.
Vigorous Servant
For the past eight years the
Vice President has been a vigor
ous servant of the administration.
But he has not been able to speak
publicly in contradiction or elab
oration without encroaching upon
the sphere of his superior. This
limitation, inherent in the office,
may help to explain why no Vice
President in 119 years has been
able to generate a political image
sufficient to cast himself into the
Presidency.
The Vice President receives all
the disapproval which is leveled
in general at the administration;
at the same time he is unable to
act individually, forcefully, or
publicly for the policies in which
he believes apart from the Presi
dent. All this being true, it is
probably also true that this Vice
President does not approach this
election as a say - nothing un
known.
Federal Dollars
On the issue of federal dollars
for education the Vice President
argues that "he who pays the
piper calls the tune." Subsidiza
tion of teachers is uncomfortably
near control of curriculum, while
support for building construction
may be within the alloyvable limit,
and indeed, he has voted for the
latter. Nor, Nixon argues, can all
the problems in the American ed
ucational system be solved with
more dollars; VThe most funda
mental weakness in many of our
•schools is that students are not
allowed to face the challenge of
failure. . . . The educators say it
is more important to help stu
dents adjust to one another and
feel the warmth of success than it
is to demand rigorous achieve
ment. When students leave school
. . . knowledge and achievement
will count, not good intentions."
On foreign policy, Nixon put
himself out in front of the ad

! ministration the fall of 19f>8 when j
he advocated a greater emphasis
; on economic assistance abroad, i
The underdeveloped countries
ought to get fewer bazookas,
more equipment to raise their
standards of living. "I should like
. for us to speak less of the threat ;
' of Communism and more of the '
promise of freedom. We should
adopt as our primary objective
• not the defeat of Communism but
! the victory of plenty over want, ■
of health over disease, of freedom '
| over tyranny. . . . " .
If elected it is probably Nixon
' would carry out a type of bi-1
partisan foreign policy similar to j
the present one, but characterized !
by an added vigor resulting from
the difference in his personality j
and Eisenhower's. Such a change
lis timely, for in addition to ac-J
cumulated experience and dedica
tion, all the agility of ihe fastest |
most politically - capable minds ;
will be requisite in the coming i
| rounds of summit diplomacy.
Taft-Hartley Act
Nixon played an active role in
the development of the Taft-Hart
ley Act in 1917, and he considers
j continuing legislation important.
A better act, he says, would have
come out in recent years had all
the money which was spent upon
right - to - work initiatives been
spent in favor of independent,
courageous, and fearless condi
' dates for Congress. Nixon con
ceives of a Republican party with
'which labor could identify more
j closely than it does today, and he
considers that both labor and
; business have a right, a duty, to
get into politics, above all to get j
their views adequately repre
sented
When asked, recently, what he
thought was the most important
domestic problem of the approach
ing ten years, Ihe Vice President
replied: "The role of the gov
ernment in its relation to the
economy." Basic to the modern
Republicanism which Nixon rep
resents is the belief that growth
in the economy is the result of
vigorous initiative and courage,
which is in turn the result of
challenge. The federal govern
ment must limit itself to operat
ing only where the individual
i cannot. In the private sphere,
efficiency proves to be a sounder
j guide, a more dynamic motiva
tion. than does its equivalent in
the governmental sphere, the urge
for promotion in the bureaucracy.
Political Responsibility
The modern Republican believes
that the cold logic of efficiency |
must be thawed by political re
sponsibility and social conscious- i
ness. Every citizen of thi-s coun- j
! try may expect from his govern-'
ment security from misery. But ;
the best that's in a democratic;
people is stirred by responsibility, j
and lifting from the bottom up a i

strong people must shore up a i
weak government, because a
strong government can never
shore up a weak and flaccid peo- I
pie. Responsibility breeds men
and citizens; a lack of it, the
fodder for totalitarianism.
Thus, argues the Vice President j
for his party, if faith in the re
sponsible individual is outmoded,
so too is the Constitution and its
protection for him. But, if it is
not, then the task of government :
is to provide the environment in
which every man may find his
fullest talents, where creativity
does not bear a government
stamp.
Nixon is felt by many Repub- i
licans to be the most outspoken, :
dynamic representative of this ,
brand of Republicanism; to many
he represents freedom tempered
by social responsibility. In that
the philosophy is controversial, so
too is the man; hut to many it
will ring true.

raised such divisive debate.
Vigorous Servant
For the past eight years the
Vice President has been a vigor
ous servant of the administration.
But he has not been able to speak
publicly in contradiction or elab
oration without encroaching upon
the sphere of his superior. This
limitation, inherent in the office,
may help to explain why no Vice
President in 119 years has been
able to generate a political image
sufficient to cast himself into the
Presidency.
The Vice President receives all
the disapproval which is leveled
in general at the administration;
at the same time he is unable to
act individually, forcefully, or
publicly for the policies in which
he believes apart from the Presi
dent. All this being true, it is
probably also true that this Vice
President does not approach this
election as a say - nothing un
known.
Federal Dollars
On the issue of federal dollars
for education the Vice President
argues that "he who pays the
piper calls the tune." Subsidiza
tion of teachers is uncomfortably
near control of curriculum, while
support for building construction
may be within the alloyvable limit,
and indeed, he has voted for the
latter. Nor, Nixon argues, can all
the problems in the American ed
ucational system be solved with
more dollars; VThe most funda
mental weakness in many of our
•schools is that students are not
allowed to face the challenge of
failure. . . . The educators say it
is more important to help stu
dents adjust to one another and
feel the warmth of success than it
is to demand rigorous achieve
ment. When students leave school
. . . knowledge and achievement
will count, not good intentions."
On foreign policy, Nixon put
himself out in front of the ad

! ministration the fall of 19f>8 when j
he advocated a greater emphasis
; on economic assistance abroad, i
The underdeveloped countries
ought to get fewer bazookas,
more equipment to raise their
standards of living. "I should like
. for us to speak less of the threat ;
' of Communism and more of the '
promise of freedom. We should
adopt as our primary objective
• not the defeat of Communism but
! the victory of plenty over want, ■
of health over disease, of freedom '
| over tyranny. . . . " .
If elected it is probably Nixon
' would carry out a type of bi-1
partisan foreign policy similar to j
the present one, but characterized !
by an added vigor resulting from
the difference in his personality j
and Eisenhower's. Such a change
lis timely, for in addition to ac-J
cumulated experience and dedica
tion, all the agility of ihe fastest |
most politically - capable minds ;
will be requisite in the coming i
| rounds of summit diplomacy.
Taft-Hartley Act
Nixon played an active role in
the development of the Taft-Hart
ley Act in 1917, and he considers
j continuing legislation important.
A better act, he says, would have
come out in recent years had all
the money which was spent upon
right - to - work initiatives been
spent in favor of independent,
courageous, and fearless condi
' dates for Congress. Nixon con
ceives of a Republican party with
'which labor could identify more
j closely than it does today, and he
considers that both labor and
; business have a right, a duty, to
get into politics, above all to get j
their views adequately repre
sented
When asked, recently, what he
thought was the most important
domestic problem of the approach
ing ten years, Ihe Vice President
replied: "The role of the gov
ernment in its relation to the
economy." Basic to the modern
Republicanism which Nixon rep
resents is the belief that growth
in the economy is the result of
vigorous initiative and courage,
which is in turn the result of
challenge. The federal govern
ment must limit itself to operat
ing only where the individual
i cannot. In the private sphere,
efficiency proves to be a sounder
j guide, a more dynamic motiva
tion. than does its equivalent in
the governmental sphere, the urge
for promotion in the bureaucracy.
Political Responsibility
The modern Republican believes
that the cold logic of efficiency |
must be thawed by political re
sponsibility and social conscious- i
ness. Every citizen of thi-s coun- j
! try may expect from his govern-'
ment security from misery. But ;
the best that's in a democratic;
people is stirred by responsibility, j
and lifting from the bottom up a i

strong people must shore up a i
weak government, because a
strong government can never
shore up a weak and flaccid peo- I
pie. Responsibility breeds men
and citizens; a lack of it, the
fodder for totalitarianism.
Thus, argues the Vice President j
for his party, if faith in the re
sponsible individual is outmoded,
so too is the Constitution and its
protection for him. But, if it is
not, then the task of government :
is to provide the environment in
which every man may find his
fullest talents, where creativity
does not bear a government
stamp.
Nixon is felt by many Repub- i
licans to be the most outspoken, :
dynamic representative of this ,
brand of Republicanism; to many
he represents freedom tempered
by social responsibility. In that
the philosophy is controversial, so
too is the man; hut to many it
will ring true.
In eight years tlie Vice Presi
dency of the United States has
become important. Richard Nix
on, who has made i! so, is prob
ably the most controversial figure
in American politics today. He
has dealt in the soft under belly
of politics, in party coordination
and compromise, and for i his has
been accused of being true to
neither his party, his ideals, nor
himself.
'Although, on the record, he has
traveled more as the personal rep
resentative of his chief, attended
more meetings in the same capac
ity, and acted as major partici
pant. in more policy formation
committees than probably any
Vice President before him, there
remains about him the image of
a vacillating politician. Ironically,
no man since Truman has seemed
to be such a fighter for his party,
and similarly none other has

On the issue of federal dollars
for education the Vice President
argues that "he who pays the
piper calls the tune." Subsidiza
tion of teachers is uncomfortably
near control of curriculum, while
support for building construction
may be within the alloyvable limit,
and indeed, he has voted for the
latter. Nor, Nixon argues, can all
the problems in the American ed
ucational system be solved with

On foreign policy, Nixon put
himself out in front of the ad

! ministration the fall of 19f>8 when j
he advocated a greater emphasis
; on economic assistance abroad, i
The underdeveloped countries
ought to get fewer bazookas,
more equipment to raise their
standards of living. "I should like

If elected it is probably Nixon
' would carry out a type of bi-1
partisan foreign policy similar to j
the present one, but characterized !
by an added vigor resulting from
the difference in his personality j
and Eisenhower's. Such a change
lis timely, for in addition to ac-J
cumulated experience and dedica
tion, all the agility of ihe fastest |
most politically - capable minds ;
will be requisite in the coming i

Taft-Hartley Act
Nixon played an active role in
the development of the Taft-Hart
ley Act in 1917, and he considers
j continuing legislation important.
A better act, he says, would have
come out in recent years had all
the money which was spent upon
right - to - work initiatives been
spent in favor of independent,
courageous, and fearless condi
' dates for Congress. Nixon con
ceives of a Republican party with
'which labor could identify more
j closely than it does today, and he
considers that both labor and
; business have a right, a duty, to
get into politics, above all to get j
their views adequately repre
sented
When asked, recently, what he
thought was the most important
domestic problem of the approach
ing ten years, Ihe Vice President
replied: "The role of the gov
ernment in its relation to the
economy." Basic to the modern
Republicanism which Nixon rep
resents is the belief that growth
in the economy is the result of
vigorous initiative and courage,
which is in turn the result of
challenge. The federal govern
ment must limit itself to operat
ing only where the individual
i cannot. In the private sphere,
efficiency proves to be a sounder
j guide, a more dynamic motiva
tion. than does its equivalent in
the governmental sphere, the urge
for promotion in the bureaucracy.
Political Responsibility
The modern Republican believes
that the cold logic of efficiency |
must be thawed by political re
sponsibility and social conscious- i
ness. Every citizen of thi-s coun- j
! try may expect from his govern-'
ment security from misery. But ;
the best that's in a democratic;
people is stirred by responsibility, j
and lifting from the bottom up a i

strong people must shore up a i
weak government, because a
strong government can never
shore up a weak and flaccid peo- I
pie. Responsibility breeds men
and citizens; a lack of it, the
fodder for totalitarianism.
Thus, argues the Vice President j
for his party, if faith in the re
sponsible individual is outmoded,
so too is the Constitution and its
protection for him. But, if it is
not, then the task of government :
is to provide the environment in
which every man may find his
fullest talents, where creativity
does not bear a government
stamp.
Nixon is felt by many Repub- i
licans to be the most outspoken, :
dynamic representative of this ,
brand of Republicanism; to many
he represents freedom tempered
by social responsibility. In that
the philosophy is controversial, so
too is the man; hut to many it
will ring true.
In eight years tlie Vice Presi
dency of the United States has
become important. Richard Nix
on, who has made i! so, is prob
ably the most controversial figure
in American politics today. He
has dealt in the soft under belly
of politics, in party coordination
and compromise, and for i his has
been accused of being true to
neither his party, his ideals, nor
himself.
'Although, on the record, he has
traveled more as the personal rep
resentative of his chief, attended
more meetings in the same capac
ity, and acted as major partici
pant. in more policy formation
committees than probably any
Vice President before him, there
remains about him the image of
a vacillating politician. Ironically,
no man since Truman has seemed
to be such a fighter for his party,
and similarly none other has
raised such divisive debate.
Vigorous Servant
For the past eight years the
Vice President has been a vigor
ous servant of the administration.
But he has not been able to speak
publicly in contradiction or elab
oration without encroaching upon
the sphere of his superior. This
limitation, inherent in the office,
may help to explain why no Vice
President in 119 years has been
able to generate a political image
sufficient to cast himself into the
Presidency.
The Vice President receives all
the disapproval which is leveled
in general at the administration;
at the same time he is unable to
act individually, forcefully, or
publicly for the policies in which
he believes apart from the Presi
dent. All this being true, it is
probably also true that this Vice
President does not approach this
election as a say - nothing un
known.

! ministration the fall of 19f>8 when j
he advocated a greater emphasis
; on economic assistance abroad, i
The underdeveloped countries
ought to get fewer bazookas,
more equipment to raise their
standards of living. "I should like
. for us to speak less of the threat ;
' of Communism and more of the '
promise of freedom. We should
adopt as our primary objective
• not the defeat of Communism but
! the victory of plenty over want, ■
of health over disease, of freedom '
| over tyranny. . . . " .
If elected it is probably Nixon
' would carry out a type of bi-1
partisan foreign policy similar to j
the present one, but characterized !
by an added vigor resulting from
the difference in his personality j
and Eisenhower's. Such a change
lis timely, for in addition to ac-J
cumulated experience and dedica
tion, all the agility of ihe fastest |
most politically - capable minds ;
will be requisite in the coming i
| rounds of summit diplomacy.
Taft-Hartley Act
Nixon played an active role in
the development of the Taft-Hart
ley Act in 1917, and he considers
j continuing legislation important.
A better act, he says, would have
come out in recent years had all
the money which was spent upon
right - to - work initiatives been
spent in favor of independent,
courageous, and fearless condi
' dates for Congress. Nixon con
ceives of a Republican party with
'which labor could identify more
j closely than it does today, and he
considers that both labor and
; business have a right, a duty, to
get into politics, above all to get j
their views adequately repre
sented
When asked, recently, what he
thought was the most important
domestic problem of the approach
ing ten years, Ihe Vice President
replied: "The role of the gov
ernment in its relation to the
economy." Basic to the modern
Republicanism which Nixon rep
resents is the belief that growth
in the economy is the result of
vigorous initiative and courage,
which is in turn the result of
challenge. The federal govern
ment must limit itself to operat
ing only where the individual
i cannot. In the private sphere,
efficiency proves to be a sounder
j guide, a more dynamic motiva
tion. than does its equivalent in
the governmental sphere, the urge
for promotion in the bureaucracy.
Political Responsibility
The modern Republican believes
that the cold logic of efficiency |
must be thawed by political re
sponsibility and social conscious- i
ness. Every citizen of thi-s coun- j
! try may expect from his govern-'
ment security from misery. But ;
the best that's in a democratic;
people is stirred by responsibility, j
and lifting from the bottom up a i

strong people must shore up a i
weak government, because a
strong government can never
shore up a weak and flaccid peo- I
pie. Responsibility breeds men
and citizens; a lack of it, the
fodder for totalitarianism.
Thus, argues the Vice President j
for his party, if faith in the re
sponsible individual is outmoded,
so too is the Constitution and its
protection for him. But, if it is
not, then the task of government :
is to provide the environment in
which every man may find his
fullest talents, where creativity
does not bear a government
stamp.
Nixon is felt by many Repub- i
licans to be the most outspoken, :
dynamic representative of this ,
brand of Republicanism; to many
he represents freedom tempered
by social responsibility. In that
the philosophy is controversial, so
too is the man; hut to many it
will ring true.
