# SU Netters Lose Two Weekend Duels in South
## 
### John Schwarz 
Someday Stanford's tennis team
may beat UCLA hul they haven'l
turned the trick since 1942 and
they added one more in a series
of losses to the Bruin net tors last
Friday. The Card netters in Los
Angeles for a two match week
end playing UCLA Friday and
USC Saturday lost to both South
ern California schools 8-1 in
breezy Los Angeles atmosphere.
Despite a tremendous effort by
Indian ace Dick Ogden, the best
Stanford could do was to take
one victory in each of the two
matches. It was Ogden that en
gineered both these wins.
The well, tanned, dark haired
netter from Connecticut played to
near perfection Friday and de
feated UCLA's highly regarded
Larry Nagler in three sets, fi-2,
4-6, 7-5.
On Saturday Ogden played al
most as well but was clipped by
the bullet-like serving of Greg
Grant, USC star. The match went
three sets with Grant prevailing
6-3 in the third.
Later that day Ogden and team
mate Jim Jeffries combined to
salvage the only win for the In
dians a doubles triumph over
Grant and a limping Bobby Del
gado.
Both Los Angeles schools
showed too much experience and
depth for the Indians to cope
with, and .again Stanford doubles
play failed to impress.

Someday Stanford's tennis team
may beat UCLA hul they haven'l
turned the trick since 1942 and
they added one more in a series
of losses to the Bruin net tors last
Friday. The Card netters in Los
Angeles for a two match week
end playing UCLA Friday and
USC Saturday lost to both South
ern California schools 8-1 in
breezy Los Angeles atmosphere.
Despite a tremendous effort by
Indian ace Dick Ogden, the best
Stanford could do was to take
one victory in each of the two
matches. It was Ogden that en
gineered both these wins.
The well, tanned, dark haired
netter from Connecticut played to
near perfection Friday and de
feated UCLA's highly regarded
Larry Nagler in three sets, fi-2,
4-6, 7-5.
On Saturday Ogden played al
most as well but was clipped by
the bullet-like serving of Greg
Grant, USC star. The match went
three sets with Grant prevailing
6-3 in the third.
Later that day Ogden and team
mate Jim Jeffries combined to
salvage the only win for the In
dians a doubles triumph over
Grant and a limping Bobby Del
gado.
Both Los Angeles schools
showed too much experience and
depth for the Indians to cope
with, and .again Stanford doubles
play failed to impress.
