## Atom-Smasher Funds Cut; Reversal Seems Unlikely 
### 
A congressional subcommittee Friday turned down President
Eisenhower's request for funds to build the two-mile linear accelera
tor at the University.
The Senate-House Atomic Energy subcommittee would not auth
orize the spending of $107 million for the huge atom-smasher, but

1 did grant $3 million for further
' design studies.
Representatives Charles Gub
ser (R-Gilroy) described the ac-
I lion as "unbelievable" in view of
i the fact that "congress should
complain that we are lagging be
! hind the Russians in -scientific
: research and that the congres
; sional commit to should turn down
a proposal which would give us
: world leadership in an important
j field of science."
In a New York speech almost a
< year ago, President Eisenhower
; asked Congress to finance the
Stanford project, described by
■ scientists as a much needed "re
j search tool in high energy nuclear
physics."
A full committee will meet to
day and could reverse the sub
committee's decision but this is
considered unlikely. Senator Clin
ton P. Anderson, New Mexico
Democrat and chairman of the
committee, said the project will
be given another study next year.
Democrats on the joint commit
tee raised many questions about
i the linear accelerator. They voted
down a proposal to authorize it
last year and yesterday's vote cut
ting all but the design money was
4 to 2 on party lines.
The atom-smasher, which would
take six years to build, would
produce energies in the range of
jlO to 20 billion electron volts,
