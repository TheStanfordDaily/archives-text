### 
! JOHANNESBURG (/P) South
African officials were reported
S yesterday preparing a quick and
j possibly secret arraignment of
| the white farmer who shot down
Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd
: in an assassination attempt.
As the plans went forward the
Cabinet prepared to meet Mon
! day to discuss South Africa's
i deepening racial crisis and the sit
uation arising from the shooting.
The 58-year-old Verwoerd, un
bending champion of white su
; premacy and racial segregation,
j was brushed from the helm of the
nation's affairs Saturday as South
Africa faced its most fearsome
j challenge from 10 million No-
I groes.
|. Hosting' Well
With two small-ealibei'- bullets
still in his head, Verwoerd was
still well enough yesterday to be
removed from Johannesburg to a
Petoria hosiptal where he was re
ported in satisfactory condition.
As the ambulance sped the
I wounded Prime Minister to Pe
| toria, 600 police and !,()()() troops
I moved into the troubled Negro
settlement of Cato Manor, out
; side the east coast city of Durban,
and made a shack-to-shack search.
Cliureh in Flames
They arrested more than 300 Af
ricans, holding 143 of them, and
seized a truckload of spears,
knixes, axes and seven sticks of
dynamite.
The eight-hour raid, beginning
j at dawn, was one of the largest
ever carried out in Natal prov
ince.
The settlement is a hotbed of
resistance to Verwoerd's white
i supremacy laws.
Elsewhere, a small church went
up in flames near Port Elizabeth.
Hates Nationalists
Informed sources said David
Pratt, the wealthy 52-year-old
man who fired the two bullets
! into Verwoerd's head at the Jo
hannesburg agricultural exposi
tion, will be arraigned before a
| magistrate today in some small
town to avoid the violence that
: might erupt in a large city.
He was examined by medical
experts yesterday and was visited
at the Marshall Square jail in Jo
hannesburg by his daughter by
first marriage.
A friend said Pratt "hates Na
tionalists and Verwoerd is Na
tionalist No. 1."
