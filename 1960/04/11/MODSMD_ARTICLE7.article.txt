Its plans would bo ready for the

shift is justified by "meaningful
and enforceable world disarma
ment."

l he Nobel Prize in physics in 1955
and now professor of physics at
Columbia University, and Dr. Sey
mour E. Harris, Littauer profes

Prepare for Peace
Democratic National Chairman
Paul M. Butler announced the ap
pointment and said il is hoped
the group will come up with a
sound policy statement to serve
as a basis for a party platform
plank.
"Just as it is necessary for a
nation to prepare for war, so also
must a nation prepare for peace,"
said the Kusch-Harris statement.
"The economics of peace are to
tally different from the econom
ies of a state of war or cold war.
We believe that peace is attain
able."
The statement said it must be
borne in mind that world disarm
ament will free resources on both
sides of the Iron Curtain for
peaceful uses, and there will bo
opportunities for multilateral
agreements on the use of these
resources.
