# Model UN Passes Disarmament Plan
## 
### Jerry Rankin 
A Big Foul 1 - supported disarmament
plan was overwhelmingly passed and a
call for economic sanctions against South
Africa defeated, at Saturday's wrap-up
session of the Model United Nations at
Cal.
The four-day conference, attended by
770 students from colleges and universi
ties in several Western states, ended with
a rush of work by the General Assembly.
The disarmament proposal, sponsored
by Canada, the United States, Russia and
the Ukranian S.S.R., was passed by a
vote of 71 yes, 3 no and 4 abstentions.
Stanford's United Kingdom delegation
voted yes.
It would establish an International
Disarmament Organization controlled by
the U.N. Security Council to inspect and
control all arms.
Mutual Pledge
Nuclear tests, except for underground
blasts under 19 kilotons, would be halted
by a mutual pledge among F ranch.
Britain, the U.S. and Russia.
The bill comes close in many aspects
to the disarmament plans submitted at
Geneva the past few weeks.
Bill Jacobson. a Stanford student from
South Africa, gave the U.K.'s argument
lor opposing the African measure, which

would have had U.N. members "consider
economic sanctions" if South Africa does
not end its apartheid policies. The bill
failed: 2(> yes. 41 no, 9 abstentions.
When the assembly ruled it was in
order to debate the question, the South
African delegation, from Claremont Men's
College, staged one of its many walkouts.
Racial Resolution
A resolution proposed by the United
Kingdom, Ecuador and Luxembourg to
form a committee to investigate allega
tions that the racist policies are a "threat
security" passed. Stanford
delegate Larry Neal spoke for the bill.
The assembly spent mosl of the morn
ing in involved parliamentary maneuver
ing brought about when an attempt was
made to get the question of admitting Red
China to the U.N. placed on the agenda.
The U.K. backed the move, but it >vas
voted down, 25 yes, 4(1 no, and 10 absten
t ions.
Some excitment came when, in the
midst of the Red China discussion, the
South African chairman rose to announce
that the South African premier had been
shot. Most delegates considered it a joke
until the Oakland Tribune headlines were
shown.
A United Kingdom (Stanford) co-spon
sored bill recommending that France join
the voluntary nuclear test band be invited

to the Geneva conference was approved.
Another one passed by the assembly
recommended that France negotiate with
the Algerian rebels and that the Secretary
General in cooperation with both sides,
set up machinery so "the people of Al
geria may decide on the future status of
their country."
The assembly condemned the Red
Chinese for violating the Genocide con
vention by their actions in Tibet.
It also passed a United Kingdom reso
lution dealing with the Arab refugee prob
lem. Bernard Raxlen, another Stanford
delegate, addressed the assembly in plug
ging the measure.
The conference itself was snarled by
several problems which popped up un
expectedly.
Originally, the delegates were to be
housed by blocs, the Western and Afro-
Asian in one hotel, and the Latin Ameri
can and Communist in another.
Registered Wrong
However, some delegates showed up
early, registered in one hotel, and then
discovered they were assigned in the other.
It was too late to move them, and things
just got worse after that.
The hotels, the Claremont and Shat
tuek. also neglected to reserve enough
rooms, so that about 100 students were
scattered in another hotel and four motels.

One delegation, from Eastern Washington
College, was split between two hotels.
In addition, some committee chairmen
showed up very late, and some never ar
rived. The meetings started late almost
every time.
Almost all delegations vocally ex
pressed their unhappiness with the Cal ar
rangements.
Stanford Lost
Stanford, which had been informally
and unofficially given the responsibility
for keeping the MIJN documents a few
years ago, lost the depository to San Fran
cisco State, which presented a magnificent
plan for a permanent depository in its
library.
Stanford's delegation was active and
very influential in playing the role of the
United Kingdom to the hilt. Ed Warren
was chairman of the Western bloc's Trus
teeship caucus meetings.
Lee Gentry chaired the bloc's Second
Committee caucuses, and Jaeobson was
co-chairman of the bloc's Special Political
Committee caucuses.
Tom Gompertz chaired the Thursday
meeiing of the Economic and Social Com
mittee.
The University of Oregon is slated to
hold next year's meeting, and San Diego
State beat out UCLA for the 1962 con
ference.

College, was split between two hotels.
In addition, some committee chairmen

every time.
Almost all delegations vocally ex

Stanford Lost
Stanford, which had been informally
and unofficially given the responsibility
for keeping the MIJN documents a few
years ago, lost the depository to San Fran
cisco State, which presented a magnificent
plan for a permanent depository in its
library.
Stanford's delegation was active and
very influential in playing the role of the
United Kingdom to the hilt. Ed Warren
was chairman of the Western bloc's Trus
teeship caucus meetings.
Lee Gentry chaired the bloc's Second
Committee caucuses, and Jaeobson was
co-chairman of the bloc's Special Political
Committee caucuses.
Tom Gompertz chaired the Thursday
meeiing of the Economic and Social Com

The University of Oregon is slated to
hold next year's meeting, and San Diego

A Big Foul 1 - supported disarmament
plan was overwhelmingly passed and a
call for economic sanctions against South
Africa defeated, at Saturday's wrap-up
session of the Model United Nations at
Cal.
The four-day conference, attended by
770 students from colleges and universi
ties in several Western states, ended with
a rush of work by the General Assembly.
The disarmament proposal, sponsored
by Canada, the United States, Russia and
the Ukranian S.S.R., was passed by a
vote of 71 yes, 3 no and 4 abstentions.
Stanford's United Kingdom delegation
voted yes.
It would establish an International
Disarmament Organization controlled by
the U.N. Security Council to inspect and
control all arms.
Mutual Pledge
Nuclear tests, except for underground
blasts under 19 kilotons, would be halted
by a mutual pledge among F ranch.
Britain, the U.S. and Russia.
The bill comes close in many aspects
to the disarmament plans submitted at
Geneva the past few weeks.
Bill Jacobson. a Stanford student from
South Africa, gave the U.K.'s argument
lor opposing the African measure, which

would have had U.N. members "consider
economic sanctions" if South Africa does
not end its apartheid policies. The bill
failed: 2(> yes. 41 no, 9 abstentions.
When the assembly ruled it was in
order to debate the question, the South
African delegation, from Claremont Men's
College, staged one of its many walkouts.
Racial Resolution
A resolution proposed by the United
Kingdom, Ecuador and Luxembourg to
form a committee to investigate allega
tions that the racist policies are a "threat
security" passed. Stanford
delegate Larry Neal spoke for the bill.
The assembly spent mosl of the morn
ing in involved parliamentary maneuver
ing brought about when an attempt was
made to get the question of admitting Red
China to the U.N. placed on the agenda.
The U.K. backed the move, but it >vas
voted down, 25 yes, 4(1 no, and 10 absten
t ions.
Some excitment came when, in the
midst of the Red China discussion, the
South African chairman rose to announce
that the South African premier had been
shot. Most delegates considered it a joke
until the Oakland Tribune headlines were
shown.
A United Kingdom (Stanford) co-spon
sored bill recommending that France join
the voluntary nuclear test band be invited

to the Geneva conference was approved.
Another one passed by the assembly
recommended that France negotiate with
the Algerian rebels and that the Secretary
General in cooperation with both sides,
set up machinery so "the people of Al
geria may decide on the future status of
their country."
The assembly condemned the Red
Chinese for violating the Genocide con
vention by their actions in Tibet.
It also passed a United Kingdom reso
lution dealing with the Arab refugee prob
lem. Bernard Raxlen, another Stanford
delegate, addressed the assembly in plug
ging the measure.
The conference itself was snarled by
several problems which popped up un
expectedly.
Originally, the delegates were to be
housed by blocs, the Western and Afro-
Asian in one hotel, and the Latin Ameri
can and Communist in another.
Registered Wrong
However, some delegates showed up
early, registered in one hotel, and then
discovered they were assigned in the other.
It was too late to move them, and things
just got worse after that.
The hotels, the Claremont and Shat
tuek. also neglected to reserve enough
rooms, so that about 100 students were
scattered in another hotel and four motels.

the Algerian rebels and that the Secretary
General in cooperation with both sides,
set up machinery so "the people of Al
geria may decide on the future status of
their country."
The assembly condemned the Red
Chinese for violating the Genocide con
vention by their actions in Tibet.
It also passed a United Kingdom reso
lution dealing with the Arab refugee prob
lem. Bernard Raxlen, another Stanford
delegate, addressed the assembly in plug
ging the measure.
The conference itself was snarled by
several problems which popped up un
expectedly.
Originally, the delegates were to be
housed by blocs, the Western and Afro-
Asian in one hotel, and the Latin Ameri
can and Communist in another.
Registered Wrong
However, some delegates showed up
early, registered in one hotel, and then
discovered they were assigned in the other.
It was too late to move them, and things
just got worse after that.
The hotels, the Claremont and Shat
tuek. also neglected to reserve enough
rooms, so that about 100 students were
scattered in another hotel and four motels.

One delegation, from Eastern Washington
College, was split between two hotels.
In addition, some committee chairmen
showed up very late, and some never ar
rived. The meetings started late almost
every time.
Almost all delegations vocally ex
pressed their unhappiness with the Cal ar
rangements.
Stanford Lost
Stanford, which had been informally
and unofficially given the responsibility
for keeping the MIJN documents a few
years ago, lost the depository to San Fran
cisco State, which presented a magnificent
plan for a permanent depository in its
library.
Stanford's delegation was active and
very influential in playing the role of the
United Kingdom to the hilt. Ed Warren
was chairman of the Western bloc's Trus
teeship caucus meetings.
Lee Gentry chaired the bloc's Second
Committee caucuses, and Jaeobson was
co-chairman of the bloc's Special Political
Committee caucuses.
Tom Gompertz chaired the Thursday
meeiing of the Economic and Social Com
mittee.
The University of Oregon is slated to
hold next year's meeting, and San Diego
State beat out UCLA for the 1962 con
ference.
A Big Foul 1 - supported disarmament
plan was overwhelmingly passed and a
call for economic sanctions against South
Africa defeated, at Saturday's wrap-up
session of the Model United Nations at
Cal.
The four-day conference, attended by
770 students from colleges and universi
ties in several Western states, ended with
a rush of work by the General Assembly.
The disarmament proposal, sponsored
by Canada, the United States, Russia and
the Ukranian S.S.R., was passed by a
vote of 71 yes, 3 no and 4 abstentions.
Stanford's United Kingdom delegation
voted yes.
It would establish an International
Disarmament Organization controlled by
the U.N. Security Council to inspect and
control all arms.
Mutual Pledge
Nuclear tests, except for underground
blasts under 19 kilotons, would be halted
by a mutual pledge among F ranch.
Britain, the U.S. and Russia.
The bill comes close in many aspects
to the disarmament plans submitted at
Geneva the past few weeks.
Bill Jacobson. a Stanford student from
South Africa, gave the U.K.'s argument
lor opposing the African measure, which

would have had U.N. members "consider
economic sanctions" if South Africa does
not end its apartheid policies. The bill
failed: 2(> yes. 41 no, 9 abstentions.
When the assembly ruled it was in
order to debate the question, the South
African delegation, from Claremont Men's
College, staged one of its many walkouts.
Racial Resolution
A resolution proposed by the United
Kingdom, Ecuador and Luxembourg to
form a committee to investigate allega
tions that the racist policies are a "threat
security" passed. Stanford
delegate Larry Neal spoke for the bill.
The assembly spent mosl of the morn
ing in involved parliamentary maneuver
ing brought about when an attempt was
made to get the question of admitting Red
China to the U.N. placed on the agenda.
The U.K. backed the move, but it >vas
voted down, 25 yes, 4(1 no, and 10 absten
t ions.
Some excitment came when, in the
midst of the Red China discussion, the
South African chairman rose to announce
that the South African premier had been
shot. Most delegates considered it a joke
until the Oakland Tribune headlines were
shown.
A United Kingdom (Stanford) co-spon
sored bill recommending that France join
the voluntary nuclear test band be invited

to the Geneva conference was approved.
