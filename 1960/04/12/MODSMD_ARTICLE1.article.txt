# SAUER TAKES POST
## S. Africa Hides Attacker's Fate 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (/i J ) The government last
night hid the late of Prime Minister Hendrik F. Verwoerd's
would-be assassin behind state-of-emergency regulations. This left
authorities free to try him anywhere and at any time they choose.
With Verwoerd sidelined for an indefinte period, the Cabinet

called on Paul Oliver Sauer, a Na
tionalist party elder statesman, to
run the government while the
Prime Minister recovers. Sauer
promptly promised to carry on
Verwoerd's white supremacy poli
cies.
Police ordered the press to quit
printing the name of David Pratt,
52, wealthy white farmer and Eng
lish clubman who shot Verwoerd
twice in the head Saturday.
Friends have described Pratt as
a foe of Verwoerd's apartheid
or race segregation policy.
Treason Charge
A police spokesman said only
that Pratt "will appear in court
at some future date." There was
press speculation that Pratt,
whose arraignment had been ex
pected yesterday, will be charged
with high treason. This charge
carries a death penalty.
Sauer, 62. minister of lands, Na
tionalist party leader in Parlia
ment. and senior member of the
Cabinet, promptly informed Par
liament there will be no deviation
from Verwoerd's racial policies.
Investigation Promised
As if to underscore his words,
police staged a roundup of Negro
foes of white supremacy laws out
side Johannesburg and in the Port
Elizabeth area on the south coast.
Speaking to a tense session of
Parliament in Cape Town, Sauer
promised a thorough investigation
of the shooting of Verwoerd at
Johannesburg.
Medical bulletins from Pretoria,
where Verwoerd is hospitalized
with two .22 caliber bullet wounds
in his head, said the Prime Min
ister is weak but making satisfac
tory progress.
