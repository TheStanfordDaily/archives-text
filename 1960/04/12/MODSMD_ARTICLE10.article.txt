# Nixon Says U.S. Cause Needs More 'True Believers' Abroad
## Overflow Crowd Hears Talk By GOP Presidential Hopeful 
### Ross Hermann 
Vice President Richard M. Nixon said here yesterday that
Americans are hampered in the world conflict by an inability to
know why they believe in their system and ideals.
Nixon, likely Republican presidential nominee, said that the
Russians, on the other hand, are true believers in their cause and

their ultimate success. They know
what they stand for, and they
have knowledge to support their
position.
Nixon made this statement as
part of an analysis of the book,
"The Ugly American." The book,
he noted, expressed concern about
American representation abroad
and criticized American diplomats
and businessmen for being igno
rant of language and culture in
other countries.
Washington Reaction
Nixon said that official Wash
ington has reacted to the book by
pointing out the many qualified
people in foreign service and im
plying that the book is inaccurate.
Nixon stated that he disagrees
with this position because he him
self has personally seen examples
of all the characters portrayed in
the book.
The Vice President said, how
ever. that his major disagreement
is with the popular cure for the
situation. Many officials and lay
men have proposed that people
sent abroad by the government
should be career diplomats well
trained in the language, culture,
and tradition of the particular
country.
Career Diplomats Not Solution
"They are wrong," he said. The
question is not between career
and non-career people. And train
ing constitutes only basic mini
mum requirements.
The major concern, he stated, is
what these people understand in
relation to the world conflict and
how well they are able to defend
their system in the face of chal
lenges.
Isi reply to a question concern
ing future U.S. policy toward
Africa and particularly South
Africa, Nixon said that Africa is
as important today in the world
conflict as China was 15 years
ago. He said Africa is perhaps
the most crucial area in the world.
Already the Communists are
striving to sway the emerging
people and to date have made
considerable progress. Nixon said
U.S. efforts have not been as ef
fective because "we have a short
range rather than a long range
view of history."
Nixon slated that African prob
lems will not be solved in the
next five years but may require
15 to 40 years.
More Aid to Africa
The Vice President proposed
that the United States give Afri
cans a greater opportunity to
come to this country for educa
tion and technical training. He
indicated also that economic aid
must be increased.
The Vice President described
the current situation in South
Africa as "tragic" and supported
our recent condemnation of the
South African government.
Nixon said that while the Unit
ed States has its own racial prob
lems they are not the result of a
federal policy. The South African
government, on the other hand,
adopted a policy denying equality
and civil rights.
In answer to a question, Nixon
expressed his opposition to the
current Forand Federal Health In
surance bill. He explained that the
bill provides compulsory health
insurance for persons over 65 if
they are covered by social se
curity. This requirement elimi
nates many needy persons, there
by reducing the effectiveness of
the bill.
Opposes Compulsory Health Bill
He was also opposed to the bill
because of its compulsory nature.
He felt that if the bill were
adopted the next step would be
state or socialized medicine.
Recognizing that a welfare
problem does exist, Nixon pro
posed voluntary coverage for all
persons over 65 regardless of so
cial security participation. He said
that welfare must be handled
within the context of freedom.
When asked whether a candi
date who uses Communist in
ucrido as a campaign tactic should
be supported, Nixon state that
every issue should be discussed
and every record examined.
The Vice President said that a
question facing the next president
is what position the United States
should occupy in the world con

Asked about his concept of the
presidency, Nixon said that the
president must lead. lie said that
Eisenhower has led the United
States, ended the Korean War,
and maintained world peace.

The Vice President felt that the
important thing in leadership is
not the outward appearance but
the substance of accomplishment.
He said some presidents have led
more quietly than others. "Presi
dent Eisenhower is not a table
pounder as was his predecessor."
The Vice President was asked
how excess budget money should
be used it a disarmament agree
ment were readied. Replying, he
said that a large portion of the
money should go to what he
called "public purposes," the re
lief of misery and poverty and
the promotion of education.
He said that the government
should spend only as much as is
necessary. He expressed confi
dence that the people have the
ability to make their own deci
sions in relation to production,
income, and spending.

country.
Career Diplomats Not Solution
"They are wrong," he said. The
question is not between career
and non-career people. And train
ing constitutes only basic mini
mum requirements.
The major concern, he stated, is
what these people understand in
relation to the world conflict and
how well they are able to defend
their system in the face of chal
lenges.
Isi reply to a question concern
ing future U.S. policy toward
Africa and particularly South
Africa, Nixon said that Africa is
as important today in the world
conflict as China was 15 years
ago. He said Africa is perhaps
the most crucial area in the world.
Already the Communists are
striving to sway the emerging
people and to date have made
considerable progress. Nixon said
U.S. efforts have not been as ef
fective because "we have a short
range rather than a long range
view of history."
Nixon slated that African prob
lems will not be solved in the
next five years but may require
15 to 40 years.
More Aid to Africa
The Vice President proposed
that the United States give Afri
cans a greater opportunity to
come to this country for educa
tion and technical training. He
indicated also that economic aid
must be increased.
The Vice President described
the current situation in South
Africa as "tragic" and supported
our recent condemnation of the
South African government.
Nixon said that while the Unit
ed States has its own racial prob
lems they are not the result of a
federal policy. The South African
government, on the other hand,
adopted a policy denying equality
and civil rights.
In answer to a question, Nixon
expressed his opposition to the
current Forand Federal Health In
surance bill. He explained that the
bill provides compulsory health
insurance for persons over 65 if
they are covered by social se
curity. This requirement elimi
nates many needy persons, there
by reducing the effectiveness of
the bill.
Opposes Compulsory Health Bill
He was also opposed to the bill
because of its compulsory nature.
He felt that if the bill were
adopted the next step would be
state or socialized medicine.
Recognizing that a welfare
problem does exist, Nixon pro
posed voluntary coverage for all
persons over 65 regardless of so
cial security participation. He said
that welfare must be handled
within the context of freedom.
When asked whether a candi
date who uses Communist in
ucrido as a campaign tactic should
be supported, Nixon state that
every issue should be discussed
and every record examined.

question facing the next president
is what position the United States

Asked about his concept of the
presidency, Nixon said that the
president must lead. lie said that
Eisenhower has led the United
States, ended the Korean War,
and maintained world peace.
Ike lias Led
The Vice President felt that the
important thing in leadership is
not the outward appearance but
the substance of accomplishment.
He said some presidents have led
more quietly than others. "Presi
dent Eisenhower is not a table
pounder as was his predecessor."
The Vice President was asked
how excess budget money should
be used it a disarmament agree
ment were readied. Replying, he
said that a large portion of the
money should go to what he
called "public purposes," the re
lief of misery and poverty and
the promotion of education.
He said that the government
should spend only as much as is
necessary. He expressed confi
dence that the people have the
ability to make their own deci
sions in relation to production,
income, and spending.
Vice President Richard M. Nixon said here yesterday that
Americans are hampered in the world conflict by an inability to
know why they believe in their system and ideals.
Nixon, likely Republican presidential nominee, said that the
Russians, on the other hand, are true believers in their cause and

their ultimate success. They know
what they stand for, and they
have knowledge to support their
position.
Nixon made this statement as
part of an analysis of the book,
"The Ugly American." The book,
he noted, expressed concern about
American representation abroad
and criticized American diplomats
and businessmen for being igno
rant of language and culture in
other countries.
Washington Reaction
Nixon said that official Wash
ington has reacted to the book by
pointing out the many qualified
people in foreign service and im
plying that the book is inaccurate.
Nixon stated that he disagrees
with this position because he him
self has personally seen examples
of all the characters portrayed in
the book.
The Vice President said, how
ever. that his major disagreement
is with the popular cure for the
situation. Many officials and lay
men have proposed that people
sent abroad by the government
should be career diplomats well
trained in the language, culture,
and tradition of the particular
country.

the current situation in South
Africa as "tragic" and supported
our recent condemnation of the
South African government.
Nixon said that while the Unit
ed States has its own racial prob
lems they are not the result of a
federal policy. The South African
government, on the other hand,
adopted a policy denying equality
and civil rights.
In answer to a question, Nixon
expressed his opposition to the
current Forand Federal Health In
surance bill. He explained that the
bill provides compulsory health
insurance for persons over 65 if
they are covered by social se
curity. This requirement elimi
nates many needy persons, there
by reducing the effectiveness of
the bill.
Opposes Compulsory Health Bill
He was also opposed to the bill
because of its compulsory nature.
He felt that if the bill were
adopted the next step would be
state or socialized medicine.
Recognizing that a welfare
problem does exist, Nixon pro
posed voluntary coverage for all
persons over 65 regardless of so
cial security participation. He said
that welfare must be handled
within the context of freedom.
When asked whether a candi
date who uses Communist in
ucrido as a campaign tactic should
be supported, Nixon state that
every issue should be discussed
and every record examined.
The Vice President said that a
question facing the next president
is what position the United States
should occupy in the world con

people who would be taken in by
Communism."
Asked about his concept of the
presidency, Nixon said that the
president must lead. lie said that
Eisenhower has led the United
States, ended the Korean War,
and maintained world peace.
Ike lias Led
The Vice President felt that the
important thing in leadership is
not the outward appearance but
the substance of accomplishment.
He said some presidents have led
more quietly than others. "Presi
dent Eisenhower is not a table
pounder as was his predecessor."
The Vice President was asked
how excess budget money should
be used it a disarmament agree
ment were readied. Replying, he
said that a large portion of the
money should go to what he
called "public purposes," the re
lief of misery and poverty and
the promotion of education.
He said that the government
should spend only as much as is
necessary. He expressed confi
dence that the people have the
ability to make their own deci
sions in relation to production,
income, and spending.
Vice President Richard M. Nixon said here yesterday that
Americans are hampered in the world conflict by an inability to
know why they believe in their system and ideals.
Nixon, likely Republican presidential nominee, said that the
Russians, on the other hand, are true believers in their cause and

their ultimate success. They know
what they stand for, and they
have knowledge to support their
position.
Nixon made this statement as
part of an analysis of the book,
"The Ugly American." The book,
he noted, expressed concern about
American representation abroad
and criticized American diplomats
and businessmen for being igno
rant of language and culture in
other countries.
Washington Reaction
Nixon said that official Wash
ington has reacted to the book by
pointing out the many qualified
people in foreign service and im
plying that the book is inaccurate.
Nixon stated that he disagrees
with this position because he him
self has personally seen examples
of all the characters portrayed in
the book.
The Vice President said, how
ever. that his major disagreement
is with the popular cure for the
situation. Many officials and lay
men have proposed that people
sent abroad by the government
should be career diplomats well
trained in the language, culture,
and tradition of the particular
country.
Career Diplomats Not Solution
"They are wrong," he said. The
question is not between career
and non-career people. And train
ing constitutes only basic mini
mum requirements.
The major concern, he stated, is
what these people understand in
relation to the world conflict and
how well they are able to defend
their system in the face of chal
lenges.
Isi reply to a question concern
ing future U.S. policy toward
Africa and particularly South
Africa, Nixon said that Africa is
as important today in the world
conflict as China was 15 years
ago. He said Africa is perhaps
the most crucial area in the world.
Already the Communists are
striving to sway the emerging
people and to date have made
considerable progress. Nixon said
U.S. efforts have not been as ef
fective because "we have a short
range rather than a long range
view of history."
Nixon slated that African prob
lems will not be solved in the
next five years but may require
15 to 40 years.
More Aid to Africa
The Vice President proposed
that the United States give Afri
cans a greater opportunity to
come to this country for educa
tion and technical training. He
indicated also that economic aid
must be increased.
