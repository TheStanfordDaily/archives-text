# Morality and Freedom
## 
### 
On March IM. a letter appeared in llie Dailv I Mini, student
newspaper ;it the Lniversilv of Illinois, signed h* biology Pro
lessor Leo F. kocli, dial lias created a problem in academic free
dom that gets to the heart ol the matter.
The most controversial statement in koeh's letter was: '"Willi
modern contraceptives and medical advice readily available at
the nearest drugstore, or at least a family physician, there is no
valid reason \\li\ sexual intercourse should not be condoned among
those sufficiently mature to engage in it, without social conse
quences and without violating their own code ol morality and
ethics."
kocli was fired Friday.
lie has formally appealed his dismissal and student support
lias rallied behind him.
Dr. David Henry, president of Illinois, was hanged in elligy
outside the campus chapter of the M< A. Richard Archihold,
editor of the Dailv I Mini, wrote an editorial blaming koeh's dis
missal on "politics." One campus orator charged that kocli had
been fired under pressure from parents and other voters so that
a bond issue for universitv buildings would pass next fall. A
protest Â«as staged hv the Student Committee on Liberal Action.
Ixodes protest is now being investigated b\ the American \s
sociation of I niversilv I'rolessors.
Saturday, in an interview with a Chicago newspaper, kocli
put sail iu the wound bv s;i\ing, k "l see no problem in having
young unmarried couples living together like anyone else."
Such is the problem facing the University of Illinois. How
far does academic freedom go? Dr. Henry's answer is that it
doesn't go as far as kocli has chosen to hike it. We lliink that
Henrv's answer is the wrong one and just a little dangerous.
Do (lie bounds of conventional moralitv limit academic free
dom;' This is the real test of academic freedom. Does it exist for
a man like kocli, who is alone among his colleagues in the ad
vocacy of certain ideas, or does the uupopularitv of these ideas
constitute grounds for revoking his right to their expression?
