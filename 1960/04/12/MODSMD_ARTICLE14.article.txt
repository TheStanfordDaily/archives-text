## On Other Campi 
### 
A little over a year ago, three
Yale undergraduates formulated
an idea which was designed to
break through the barrier which
stands in front of the "silent
generation."
The idea, which the three stu
dents called "Challenge,*' has al
ready spread to many other cam
puses throughout the nation. In
mid-March, "Challenge" conduct
ed its second colloquium at Yale
on the topic of "American De
mocracy: Myth or Reality?", fea
turing A. Philip Randolph, Barry
Goldwater, Harold Taylor and
Thurgood Marshall.
The first colloquium was held
last December and presented
"The Challenge of the Nuclear
Age," with talks by Hubert
Humphrey, Carlos Romulo,
General James Gavin and genet
icist Dr. James Crow.
What makes the "Challenge" a
somewhat unique idea is that the
participants not only act as lec
turers, but attend "coffee semi
nars" after the formal program
where they and students become
more informal and really get to
the heart of matters.
In the March 2(5 issue of The
Nation, writer Dan Wakefield
says, "Although the featured
speakers recited from Ihe podium
the same basic texts that they
offer to all public gatherings
from the Baptist Fish Fry to the
Phi Beta Kappa luncheon, they
were brought down off their ora
torical heights in the coffee semi
nars.
"In a quick stop-in tour at
some of these student-speaker
sessions, a visitor heard a Yale
undergraduate question Philip
Randolph on how a white col
lege student could help bring
about the integration of the
segregated musicians' union
locals in New Haven.
"Harold Taylor, the Leonard
Bernstein of progressive educa
tion and former president of
Sarah Lawrence College, was
asked if he didn't think most
American college students had to
be forced into learning anything.
"And so it goes on. The nation's
current leaders sit down with the
nation's future leaders and dis
cuss the problems which must be
faced if America is to remain the
land of the free.
"As university students we
are concerned with understand
ing the world in which we live.
Vet we find that our environ
ment is narrowing and frag
menting our awareness of the
contemporary challenges. Our

concern and sensitivity have be
come intellectualized and so
phisticated to the point where
we are unable to respond crea
tively to those crucial issues
which are so complex that they
often seem remote."
This statement best sums up
the reasons for the existence of
"Challenge." The aim of "Chal
j lenge," Wakefield points out, has
not been to build up any partisan
: group, but to destroy what it calls
i "privatism"â€”the withdrawal into
I one's personal affairs to the ne
glecl of the world around him.
The Yale program i-s completely
non partisan and it has already
! proved its success. Many college
, newspapers have lauded "Chal
lenge" as the way up from
! apathy, and many universities,
sounding notes of guilt and hope,
have started similar programs.
At Smith College, where they
are planning to start a "Chal
lenge" program, The Sophain.
j Smith's newspaper, says this of
the idea: "So. sometimes we write
home to mummy and daddy about
i the World Situation, and occa
sionally we mention it to dear
ol' Joe. Dear Joe smiles and asks
us to dance.
"We think of the money
Americans spend on beer and
cigarettes and we worry about
the economy, and democracy,
I and things, when we see anoth
er TV antenna go up across the
street. We remember "The
News of the Week in Review"
as we re-read Vogue. We frown
about our culture and its values
as we tip the Negro waiters,
and we promise we'll talk about
the image of America sometime
to somebody when we tour Eu
rope this summer.
"We muse, and shake our w-ell
brushed heads, and say America's
i challenge is Soviet communism,
j and we can't fight that, can we?
When we get out of school, may
i be. In the meantime it can all
; slide off our shiny heads, our
feminine shoulders, our mani
i cured hands. Bravely we can look
1 to the future, stars in our eyes,
thinking that someday we too
shall do great things.
"We're the very picture of
American Youth. We gaze at the
i wide horizons of the world before
us, with a questioning mind, filled
with faith, hojlt and charity. We
! forget that challenge, like charity,
, hegins at home."
Maybe that California school
which is considered the citadel
of academic freedom should
pick up (lie Challenge.
