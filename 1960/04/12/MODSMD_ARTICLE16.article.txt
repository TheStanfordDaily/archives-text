Republican Cliches
Editor, the Daily:
It was disappointing to read !
the editorial and the article by
Craig Barnes in Monday's Daily.
Though most Stanford students
come from Republican homes, one
expects that an atmosphere which
is intended to stimulate critical
thinking would discourage them
from accepting the Republican
cliches about what is American
ism in political and social philos-
I ophy.
The editorial emphasized the:
role Nixon has played in "policy
making and implementing" and
says that he has been "outspoken j
about his ideas and has held to
his beliefs." If both statements
are true, then in view of the ab
sence of new ideas from Nixon
since Eisenhower set him free to
campaign, it appears that Nixon I
j does (as he has stated) stand on
the record of the Eisenhower re
gime.
Since the editorial asked us to
1 ignore Nixon's campaigns in Cali
| fornia, should we begin looking |
| for the new N'ixon in his devotion
to McCarthyism in the early '50's, J
in his 1955 espousal of the moral- j
]y and politically impoverished
doctrine of massive retaliation I
| where and when we please as the ;
! response to limited Communist
I aggression, or in his recent veto
I of the bill for federal aid to edu
j cation (the reason for which ac-I
| cording to Barnes was Nixon's de- t j
j votion to academic freedom)?
Barnes praises Nixon's belief in
strictly limiting government's op- 1
i crating in the economy as the key
; to economic growth; yet the head
! governmental economic adviser
j Saulnier, in his famous speech |
about devoting Ihe economy to:
consumer goods, admitted that ;
the rate of economic growth was
2.8 per cent from 1952 to 1957 as
opposed to 4.7 in Truman's last !
five years.
Many government policies have
been justified in terms of stop
ping inflation, but the Republi
cans have failed to stop this
greatest of all evils. Nixon as
head of Eisenhower's fight infla
tion committee drew up recom
mendations which (as convincing- j
:ly analyzed by Harvard economist j
Galbraith in Harpers) amount to,
j "a Congressional vote of censure I
ion inflation, a warning against!
; spending with public need regard
| ed as irrelevant, and an increase
|in interest rates that, at most,
; represents a continuation of the
; policy that he was asked to im
prove."
The Republican justification for
i inaction in the face of critical do
i mestic problems is, as Barnes and
Nixon have demonstrated, a mere"
refurbishing of the classical lib
eral theory that the individual
citizen can adequately tare for his
own welfare and that government
is primarily a matter of regula
tion. I think it is more a matter
of implementing the expressed,
j ideals and needs of the people
. where state government is obvi
i ously incapable by itself.
I agree with Stevenson's asser-,
i tion that more attention must lie
given to providing for public j
needs education, research (prob
lems of industrialization, urbani
zation, under-developed coun
tries), defense, health, and eco
nomic growth and less to private
indulgence. I concur with Ken
nan's corollary that drift and the
j appearance of helpless resigna
tion to the workings of our eco
! nomic system in part explains

our failure to provide an image
of leadership for the aspirations
of the uncommitted world.

Unfounded Criticism
Editor, (lie Daily:
As a member of LASSU, it dis
turbs me to lead the unfounded
criticism directed towards this
body editorial of April G.
In this you wrote, "LASSU, on
Ihe other hand, has decided that
it should not concern itself with
off-campus issues, as indicated by
its stand on capital punishment
last quarter."
In the first place, the legisla
ture has never decided that it
"should not concern itself with
off-campus issues." The Daily,
above all, should realize this, for
it published a considerable
amount of material concerning
the National Defense Education
Act controversy material dis
cussed specifically by the Legisla
ture. Is this not an off-campus
issueâ€”a national issue? If the
Daily will recall, the LASSU sent
a letter to the United States Con
gress seeking the removal of the
affidavit. This is hardly a strictly
provincial viewpoint.
As for LASSU's "stand on capi
ta] punishment last quarter"
firstly, Legislature did not take a
stand on capital punishment; in
fact, it decided that it would not
take one. Secondly, the reason for
taking no action was not that it
decided that "it should not con
cern itself with off-campus is
sues." It was that capital punish
ment does not concern, students
(and thus not LASSU) directly,
whereas the disclaimer affidavit
does. Perhaps it is this concept
to which the Daily is objecting.
Why shouldn't the LASSU take
a stand on issues which do not
concern students directly? I
think the answer to this is easily
seen in the organization's name
Legislature of the Students of
Stanford University; we are the
representatives of the students
and are elected to discuss and
hopefully solve their problems at
Stanford. If LASSU were to take
a stand on an issue like capital
punishment, why couldn't it just
as well demand the recognition of
Red China-or the banning of nu
clear weapons? Neither of these
issues is partisan or sectarian
(although occasionally they are

I used as political gimmick) and
thus such action would not be a
violation of the Founding Grant.
Fortunately, however, the Leg
islature of the Students of Stan-
Cord University was set up orig
' inally and is so structured to
handle issues associated with the
J campus and does not have to as
sume 1 ho responsibility of solving
| I he world's problems.
As a final comment on the edi
torial in question, it seems to me
i that a more thoughtful opinion
might have been offered had it
been based on a more accurate
(investigation of the facts.

Duty of LASSU
Editor, the Daily:
My reaction was one of acute
disgust reading the letter of Sa
sha Lanz and Pete Whitehead
concerning the position of LAS
SU in outside affairs. 1 was dis
gusted . . . and troubled.
Firstly, I thought it was an ox
tremely cheap letter unworthy of
LASSU representatives. The com
ments on campus newspaper dis
tribution and sensational press re
leases were unfunny and in the
worst of taste. But, then,-English
taste may differ.
But I was really troubled and
concerned over ihe key para
graph. To quote: "BUT . . . the
opinion of LASSU concerning is
sues not related to student affairs
would rarely help to resolve
them."
This, to my mind, misses the
point and it is a point which
goes deeper than the present is
sue. We fully realize that Stan
ford opinion on Africa, racialism,
prejudice, the bomb, etc., will not
resolve these problems. We also
realize that motions passed on
ideals and given to organizations
may finish up in the waste paper
basket.
But we believe Ihem necessary.
For our own self respect, we
must pursue this path. If, as stu
dents, we do not question the
world around and are not con
stantly reformulating standards
and searching for ideals then we
never shall. The process of con
servative thought seeps upon one

| too quickly. We have to, and we
| must, let the outside world know
that as a body we are concerned
with it. This, then, is the duty
[of the LASSU.
The arguments so far put up by
I LASSU strike me as a lot of tech
j nical verbiage. If valid, then the
i restrictions have to be changed
. . . quickly. God's in his heaven,
but all's nor right with Stanford,
California, or the world. And it
| is lime we started saying so, eon
| structively.
The weight of a university is
more than that of an individual,
and we want a body to stand up
for the things we believe in. Or
have we ceased believing and car
| ing . . . there's the rub.
