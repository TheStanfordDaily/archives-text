Sunday afternoon though sunny was a good afternoon to
spent! in front of the TV set watching the Masters golf tournej
which Arnie Calmer won thrillingly and followed by the Sunday
S|x>rts Spectacular sponsored by a popular Milwaukee brew which
featured our liig Ked riitfffers return match against the Dartmouth
Oreenies.
The Dartmouth club, led by All-Eastern grid halfback Jake
Crouthamel, revenged an earlier 5-3 defeat hoc to defeat the Card
ruggers 9-0 in a one-sided game at West Point Saturday which was
taped for re-broadcast on Sunday.
Certainly the Stanford boys enjoyed the trip east; indeed it was
quick action by Stanford athletic officials and team coach IVte
Kmetovic who grabbed the match for the Farm residents. Originally
the game was scheduled to be Durtniouth vs. Oxford but when ox-
Army great and current Oxford rugger IVte Hawkins broke his jaw
and couldn't make the trip. the. TV network called on the powerful

Cal club and when they hesitated
Stanford was given the bid and
the trip arranged.
The Indians finished the season
with a 6-5-1 (tie > record which is
certainly creditable considering
the opposition played was the
best in the U.S. this season. Rug
by. of course, is a much more
relaxed and informal sport than
its Americanized rival football.
The similarity of sports provides
opportunities for the Stanford
gridders to work out in Winter
quarter.
However, it was certainly evi
dent that the Dartmouth hooters
were more familiar with the game
and capitalized on Stanford over
eagerness and lack of knowledge
of the finer points of the rugby
because all nine Greenie points
were scored on penalty kicks to
Tribe miscues. John Clark, who
was the hero in the first Dart
mouth clash, scoring a try, proved
to be the goat as twice he went
off-side in scrums in front of the

Stanford goal-line giv ing Dartmouth's Crouthamel easy shots at the
uprights and six point-s.
We certainly can't criticize tho athletes because their record
speaks for their determined efforts in the relaxed, no-pads sport.
Ex-Card gridders Clark, John Thomas, Gary Pike, Sid Garber, and
Kick McMillan; plus gridders Phil Toorvald, Kod Sears and Doug
Pursell have exhibited a lot of ability this season. Also Tony Ding
man, Pete Bedford, Dave Scliolt, Dale Ostrander, Armand Ja<|iies
and Dick Takaki have aided tho Tribe. Skip Face and Trev Grimm
also proved valuable in early season wins.
A Strong Stanford Rngbv Program?
~ ~ » r*
No, the reason that the Tribe perhaps does not have a top season
like our rivals across the Bay is that we do not have a full-time rugby
coach like the Bears. Certainly Pete Kmetovie is very popular with
the players in this informal sport but he is also a much better foot
ball assistant coach than a rugby coach. So. if rugby continues to
rise in popularity at the Farm, and if the Indians want to become
a power equal to Cal. we should develop a strong rugby program.
Perhaps a new coach should be hired or Pete take in an ex
tensive Rugby clinic so that when boys like hooker and captain
Kyrk Reid come along, they can be given support from equally ac
complished ruggers who will aid in piling up Stanford points. Kyrk
kicked 5."5 points through the uprights this season, scoring more
than the rest of the team combined.
