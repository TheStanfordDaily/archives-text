# Knott Back... As a Bruin
## Daily Sorts 
### Dick Barnes 
Chris Knott is the epitome of
"the one that go away."
Chris Knott, in case you don't
know, is a junior sprinter at
UCLA who has run 9.1 with the
wind and is consistent at 9.6 with
out breezy help. lie's about as
good in the 220, and also runs
anchor on the Bruin mile relay
team.
The irking tiling about Chris
Knott's record is that he almost
compiled it for Stanford.
Knott came out of the Imperial
Valley as a 9.7 swil'ty and one
who had given El Centro High
School more than its share of big
meet points.
Stanford Grades
He did well on the football field,
too. And he did well in the class
room. Well enough, in fact, .to
come to Stanford. So he did.
His first fall here, Knott took
over the starting left-halfback
job on the frosh eleven and scored
two of that team's three touch
downs in a non-winning season.
By winter, however, troubles of
the nature which pink slips har
binger had set in. Stanford's 9.7

prospect he was better than any
of the varsity sprinters couldn't
compete in any late-March meets,
and by spring quarter, he was
gone. A regretful Pavton Jordan
termed him "a ,tremendous guy"
and a "brilliant sprint prospect."
Knott quickly enrolled at Santa
Monica Junior College, intent on

correcting grade deficiencies. He
didn't run at all that spring of
1958.
In February of '59, lie had com
pleted a year at Santa Monica. He
wanted to come back to Stanford,
but didn't think he could succeed
gradewise. So this time, he went
to UCLA.
Another year passed as Knott
sat out the prescribed ineligibility
period for transfers. Then came
this spring, and Knott broke into
the Southland press as "UCLA's
sensational transfer from Stan
ford."

In the nature of athletic recruit
ing, Stanford loses many "sure
thing" pro*poets to other schools
at the last minute. These hurt.
Others make it to Stanford, but
fall by the wayside as losers of
the hook battle. Not a thing can
be done about it but these hurt,
too.
Hack to Haunt
But the ones that hurt most of
all are those like Knott they
come here, they don't last, and
they come back to haunt in some
one else's uniform.
The whole Knott incident comes
to mind for one reason he'll be
here to haunt Stanford this Satur
day al 1 :.'â– ?() p.m. when the Bruins
invade the Stanford Stadium oval.
There's not much doubt that he'll
he effective at least to the tune
of firsts in the 100 and 220.
In a met that should come down
to the relay the prime example of
"the one that got away" could
easily be the difference.
