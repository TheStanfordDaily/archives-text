# Political Crisis Strikes Italy
## 
### 
ROME (/P) The ghost of fas
cism toppled Premier Fernando
Tambroni's 17-day-old govern
ment yesterday, plunging Italy
into one of its gravest political
crises since World War IT
The 58-year-old Premier and his
all-Christian Democrat Cabinet
resigned under pressure from his
own party.
Fascist Backing
He did not ask for Fascist back
ing but refused to reject it when
24 Fascist votes proved decisive
in a confidence vote in the Cham
ber of Deputies Friday night.
Over the weekend three Cabinet
ministers resigned rather than ac
cept Fascist support.
The central directorate of the
Christian Democrat party met
yesterday morning. A communi
que said in effect the memory of
Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime
â€”which once imprisoned Tarn
broni -was still a bitter one.
Cabinet Meeting'
A Cabinet meeting was held
yesterday afternoon. At sundown,
Tambroni handed his resignation
to President Giovanni Gronehi.
The President again faced the
task of finding a path through
the Italian political jungle.
Italy has been in its current po
litical turmoil since Antonio Segni
resigned as premier February 24.
Tambroni formed his government
on March 25 as a stop-gap regime
to handle urgent business.
