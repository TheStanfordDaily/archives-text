# Nixon Brings Moment of Glory to Mother, Daughter
## 
### Jerry Rankin 
Vice President Nixon wasn't mobbed by co-eds bogging for" his
autograph yesterday, as was Sen. Kennedy when he spoke here,
but he did bring a moment of happy glory into the day of a mother
and her small daughter.
The incident occurred as the vice president strode up the walk

to the rear door of Memorial Au
ditorium on his arrival here. The
lady stopped him and asked if she
might take his picture with her
Brownie camera.
Nixon, ever the polished politi
cian, smilingly agreed and, much
to the mother's surprise, bent
down and swept the little 2 or 3-
year-old girl into his arms.
Mother clicked away as the vice
president of the United States
held her daughter in his arms.
Nixon then took the youngster's
hand and strolled with her into
the building.
This left mother outside and
daughter inside, but the two were
finally reunited. The woman ap
peared completely breathless. . . .
The crowd at Mem And was
much more orderly than the one
for the Kennedy appearance. Stu
dent policeman Rich Ruble said
people started lining up at 11:45.
By 1 p.m., an hour before the talk
started, the crowd .jammed the
steps and walk in front of the
bUilding and extended about 20
feet into Ihe street.
Several hundred were present
by the time the doors opened at
1:15. Although the first floor

filled quickly, one student report
ed that about 50 seats in the bal
cony remained vacant throughout
the talk, though some students
threw their tickets from the win
dow to those outside without
tickets.
Two venturesome students man
aged to enter via the roof and the
balcony window, but were nabbed
and escorted out just as they sat
down.
Three or four Secret Service
agents, a full force of Stanford
police and 25 student police were
turned out for Nixon's visit.
