"The gentle blue eyes and the
perpetually smoking pipe are de
ceptive. Ho is not a serene man.
Rather, he is a man of action
action in the mind who com
bines the theoretical with the
practical."
This is the way one writer de
scribes Dr. J. Robert Oppenheim
er, the scientist who played an
integral part in the making of
the first atomic bomb. Oppen
heimer is at the University today,
visiting with faculty and student
members of the Physics Depart
ment.
Oppenheimer was the main
character in what is considered
one of I lie decade's most sensa
tional security-risk cases. In 1951.,
the Atomic Energy Commission
revoked the security clearance of
Oppenheimer, who at one time
had been wartime director of the
Los Alamos A-bomb laboratory
and was later chairman of the
A EC's General Advisory Commit
tee.
Loyal Citizen
A special three-man board con
cluded that Oppenheimer was a
loyal citizen, but that past "disre
gard for the requirements of the
security system" made him a se
curity risk.
Currently Director of Prince

ton's Institute for Advanced
Study, Oppenheimer does not like
to talk about the security inci
dent, hut will talk about other
things he considers vital to the
nation's future.
In relation to the disarmament
question, Oppenheimer has said
in interviews with the press, "1
don't consider the banning of nu
clear tests or supposed conversion
to peaceful uses a serious or hon
est solution to the danger.
"1 believe that only a world
council of wise men can assure
peace on a scientific basis.
Throughout the world, scientists
are ready and eager to cooperate
in such a project. I believe that
we can and will eventually cure
atomic terror just as doctors have
succeeded in combating malaria
by banding together."
(Ureal Teacher
Besides atomic physics, of
which he has been one of the
great teachers and scholars of
the century, Oppenheimer is a
student of psychology, history
and languages. He learned Sans
krit to read the Bhagavad-Gita in
the original.
His philosophy? "I have the
feeling that there is only one true
danger, and that is to go into our
life, or through it, without under
standing what we arc up against,

what is asked of us and by what
we can be reasonably judged."
There are things he thinks
more of us must cherish. "In a
free world, if it is to remain free,
we must maintain, with our lives
if need be, but surely by our lives,
the opportunity for a man to
learn anything.
Lite of' tlic Mind
"1 know I hat exhortation, mon
ey, patronage will do something
about this; but I don't think thai
is all that will be needed. I think
that if we are to have some suc
cess, it must be because, as a part
of our culture . . . the life of the
mind the life of science in itself,
as an ends as well as a means is
appreciated, is enjoyed and is
cherished.
"II is not that our land is poor
in curiosity, in true learning, in
the habit of smelling but one's
own self-delusion, in the dedica
tion and search for order and law
among novelty, variety, and con
tingency.
"There is respect for learning
and for expert ness, and a proper
recognition of the role of ignor
ance, and of our limits, both as
men and as man; but of none of
these is there enough, either
among us or in the value with
which they are held by us, if in
deed government by the people is
not to perish,"
