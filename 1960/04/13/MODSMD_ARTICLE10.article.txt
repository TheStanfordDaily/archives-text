## Govt. Encourages While Settlers 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Afri
ca (/P) South Africa is closing
its gates against migratory Negro
labor and seeking to swell the in
flux of white immigrants, the
government announced yester
day.
A long-range plan to improve
the balance of three million
white., against 10 million blacks
was outlined by Interior Minister
J. F. Naude before Parliament in
Cape Town.
Speaking in his fourth week of
a crisis capped Saturday by a
white man's attempt to assassi
nate Prime Minister Hendrik F.
Verwoerd, Naude said the govern
ment now considers immigration
of the utmost importance and
specially wants white .skilled
workers.
Immigration from Europe
He mentioned the Netherlands,
Belgium and Germany as likely
sources to improve the flow,
whi c h his been running only
about 16,000 annually. He told
Parliament he has already asked
chambers of commerce, the ag
ricultural union and other organi
aztions to help bring in white set
tlers.
Coupled with this was a warn
ing to the nation's farmers that
they will soon have to do with
out the cheap hell) of Negroes
who have been imported for farm
work by the thousands from oth
er African territories.
"With all the trouble the coun
try has experienced," Naude said,
the government will no longer be
able to allow migratory Bantu la
bor from outside to be brought in
to the Union of South Africa in
discriminately.
Allegations Denied
Naude denied allegations that
the dominant Nationalists, largely
men of Dutch descent, have im
peded immigration by English
speaking people to his member
of the Commonwealth in fear that
they would vote against the Na
tionalist government.
Criticism of the government de
veloped in spots while physicians
built up Verwoerd's strength at a
Pretoria ho-spital for an eventual
operation to remove two bullets
fired into his head by David Pratt,
52, a wealthy English-born farm
er. Pratt is being held but no
charges against him have been
announced.
Unsigned leaflets addressed to
"White South Africans" fluttered
from tall buildings in Johannes
burg. Declaring the government
was leading the nation to ruin,
they demanded an end to the state
of emergency regulations.
