\\ e admire and agree will) the action of Steve Corker, former
freslunan class president, who resigned his position last night in
an effort to show that class "government" is a farce.
Corker, who is now running for sophomore class president,
has expressed his intention of resigning if he is elected and work
ing to abolish class "government." His program already has the
support of numerous freshman with whom he has talked.
We have often questioned the purposes of student hodv gov
ernment at Stanford, hut we feel that there is the possibility
such government has a needed and worthwhile place, if the
elected representatives tr\ to find it.
Class "government," on the other hand, carries out few neces
sary functions; and if there are am good purposes for it, we
fail to see them. Many of the functions which class Ex-Coms
handle are of little value and could he eliminated without being
missed. Those few duties which have some importance could
he put under existing non-class committees and organized along
the lines which Corker advocates.
I he only people who might suffer from the abolishment of
class "government are those who would he officers or Kx-Com
members and who would perhaps benefit from the experience of
working in a "group." This, however, is a very weak argument
for the retention of something which is of little concern or merit
to the other members of the class.
The forthcoming election, then will he the opportunity for
the freshmen to decide if' thev desire class "government" or if
they think it is a farce and want it abolished. We believe, on
the basis of approval already expressed to Corker, that the Class
of 1963 will choose the second alternative l>\ giving him their
support in the election and will establish a precedent which hope
fully other classes will follow in the future.
