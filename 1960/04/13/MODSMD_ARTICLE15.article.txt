Lest our spirits be inundated
by the rapidly advancing tide of
work, tis worth noting that op
portunities . . . for culture, enter
tainment, diversion, amusement
. . . will satiate the campus for
the next few weeks.
Tonight Paris' famous Theatre
of the Vieux Colombier will pre
sent Moliere's Le Misanthrope in
Dinkelspiel at 8:30 p.m. a
shouldn't-be-missed chance to see
a classical French comedy per
formed by a modern company.
Jacques Dumesnil, one of
France's great actors, is taking
the leading role of a man who
seeks a decisive conversation with
a woman he loves and who by the
end of the day has not yet found
an opportunity to state his case.
Presented under the official
patronage of the French govern
ment, Le Misanthrope will be
given in French and performed in
modern dress with tapestries, fur
nishings and chandeliers of the
Louis XIV style.
For those interested in back
ground for the play, as well as for
those leery of the French, several
members of the Modern European
Languages department will ex
plain the play, discuss the charac
ters, and read scenes in English
at 4:15 this afternoon in the Little
Theatre.
Coming up also, is the Stanford
Player's production of Shakes
peare's lyric tragedy Richard II
next week on Thursday, Friday
and Saturday nights.
The absolute King Richard 11,
played by a graduate student in
the department of speech and
drama, Eugene Peyroux, will duel
for power with baronial nominee
Bolingbroke, played by Fred Levi,

!on the Memorial Auditorium
stage in what promises to be a
well-done, worthwhile production.
Director James Kerans has
adapted the forth act of the play
for television, and it will be pre
sented by the Stanford Players
as a half-hour preview of the pro
duction on KTVU, channel 2, this
Sunday at 9:30 p.m.
Klsewhere culture and enter
tainment have pervaded the area
also — and comics Mike Nichols
and Elaine May will present a
wildly funny two-hour program
which will open this coming Mon
day at 8:30 p.m. and run through
the following Sunday at the
Geary Tlieat re.
And coming to the Curran a
week from this Sunday is "the
Poet of the Piano" Carmen Cav
allero, who has earned a solid
reputation in the world of music
for his interpretations in jazz,
swing, general music and semi-
I classics.
Accompanied by guitar, bass
viol and drums, he will play ev
erything and anything from his
celebrated rendition of Chopin's
Folanaise to his enormously pop
ular Latin arrangements to cur
rent jazz numbers.
