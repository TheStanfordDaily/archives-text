Shameful Shallowness
Kditor, the Daily:
LASSII has made an astonish
ing but accurate reply to your ed
itorial of April 6. Sasha Lanz and
Pete Whitehead cannot conceive
of expressing opinions on matters
which will not he immediately
righted by their doing so; Kathy
Cullinan either finds the student
body incapable of criminal malice
(though the Cordry case is still
I very much in our minds) or else
| she feels that ideas and philoso
phies of government do not affect
us, and are not therefore deserv
ing of our attention.
It might be observed that Sasha
Lanz. whose pioneer work on the
problem of bicycles at Stanford
has been outstanding, was violent
ly opposed to LASSU's taking ac
tion on the NDEA though even
Miss Cullinan admits this issue
might possibly affect us.
The provincialism selfishness,
if you will in which our student
government is looted was demon
strated again at last Thursday's
LASSU meeting. A representative
j from the National, Students As
\ sociation, a group devoted to ex
pressing •student opinion on mat
ters of national and international
concern, was repeatedly asked,
! "Could you explain the direct
benefits of such an organization
to us a little more clearly?"
What's in it for us? This ques
tion is apparently our one cri
terion for interest and action.
Rich Sundeen, ASSU president,
quite wisely advised anyone "with
even the slightest interest" in stu
dent government to run for of
fice; anything beyond the slight
est interest would be considered
out of place, and might reveal the
i shameful shallowness of our con
; cern.

A Mold
Kditor, tiie Daily:
Mr. Rosenthal and others of
like mind, you tempt me to place
I you at ihe head of that group of
students that have no mind and
are too lazy to develop one. How
in heaven's name do you propose
' to encourage the students to ques
tion the world around and reform
ulate standards if there is a body
that automatically grinds out an
swers and reformulations for
them?
i The day the LASSU starts mak-
I ing up its mind what I think about
world issues. I shall go off and
live in Russia, where, at least,
i they get paid vacations and
1 dmeals for giving up a part of
their freedom.
Doesn't it occur to you that the
LASSU is a body primarily set
up to resolve student affairs, and
that if it has no resolving func
tion it turns into another super
fluous body voicing unheeded op
inions? Grant me, if you will,
that this campus represents a
broad range of opinion. And you
would force all of this wonder
fully conflicting and •stimulating
i opinion into a mold to represent
. the opinion of Stanford, simply
J because the University is bigger
| than the individual. Is it really?

Questions to LASSU
Editor, the Daily:
Some questions for the LASSU
! representatives:
1. Why has LASSU not ex
pressed any opinion on the lunch
[counter sitdown demonstrations

I in the South despite the fact that
1 this is solely a student affair?
2. What explains the fact that
other institutions of learning like
Harvard, Brandeis, M.1.T., Oberlin
and Wesleyan have felt obligated
to raise funds in order to help
Negro students in their fight
against segregation, whereas,
none of the members of LASSU
I has yet dared to disapprove or
I approve of the Negro students'
i action ?
3. What explains the indiffer
ence of LASSU on the South Afri
can crisis and yot this is a gov
ernment that lias virtually denied
all academic freedom to its eiti
; /ens?
4. Is LASSU going to lake a
stand on the case of Professor
- L. F. Koch whose exercise of aca
demic freedom jnas cost him his
job in the University of Illinois?
Stanford University is one of
I the leading institutions of learn
ing, and LASSU must bear the
responsibility of keeping it that
way rather than confining it to
the selling of bicycle lights, to
use the Daily editor's example,
and writing defensive letters.
J. Maina
New Idea
Editor, flii' Daily:
For the sake of student govern
| ment at Stanford, I hope that
Monday's letter to the editor by
two LASSU members does not
represent the attitude of student
government as a whole. The let
ter manifests either a discourag
ing ignorance of the issue in
volved or a distressing misunder
standing of it.
I can understand that LASSU
might not feel itself qualified or
able to express itself on major is
sues, but I cannot believe that it
should completely ignore them
and confine itself if) matters per
taining solely to campus activi
ties. In an age that demands an
j awareness of the major problems
in society today, especially on the
part of the so-called educated
! elite, such an attitude is anachro
nistic. If the Legislature does not
.want to commit itself on an issue,
' it can at least attempt to gener
ate some constructive thought on
it.
Cannot something be done to
inject into campus politics issues
of meaning and significance to
university students, who will find
themselves much too soon the un
willing heirs of the headaches of
ihe world? An intransigent de
fense of LASSU's present posi
tion and its unwillingness to ad
just itself points to the need for
j a new idea in student govern
j ment.

Holy War
Editor, the Daily:
The New York Times, in study
ing the results of the Wisconsin
primary last week, has concluded |
in part that "to the extent that
religion as such made or lost votes
on either side, this is a seriously
negative, discouraging factor in
the American scene."
The fact 1 of the religious issue
is indeed ugly. It was twisted into j
a familiar, subtle but totally bar
baric leer this past weekend by
Vice President Nixon who at - <
tacked Senaior Kennedy, the
Roman Catholic, by reopening the
religiously exploded issue of birth
controls at this time. Nixon de- j
dared, according to a UPI story j
printed in the Chronicle of April
10, that his remarks were not "po- j
litical." This is given the lie, how
ever, by the calculated timing of i
Nixon's statement.
Why has Nixon waited until
this moment, between the Wiscon
sin and West Virginia primaries. |
to disagree with President Eisen
hower's statement of December. ,
1959, in public? 1 cannot believe
there is such a man as a "New
Nixon." A leader for an American
"Holy War" has marched right
out of an expected corner.

Clutch for Cliches
lCditor, the Daily:
Interestingly, iho article by Mr.
Murray in yesterday's Daily fie-1
nouneing cliches contained a
cliche or two of its own. Wilh
great respect for the tenets of
critical thinking to which Murray
alludes, the reader was not much
assisted by references to "classi- j
cal liberal doctrine," (about which
neither Nixon nor the criticized
article spoke) nor much won to
the cause of honest analysis by
dramatic allusions to Nixon's "de
votion to McCarthyism," and ad
herence to "the morally and po
litically impoverished doctrine of
massive retaliation."
The analysis disposed of Nixon .
and his party without regard to
the substance of the issues raised
in the criticized article. It was
inadequate in that it displayed, j
as to the Vice President, an in- j
tuitive predisposition.
Regarding the imp<Vtant sub
stantive issue which he himself
raised, Mr. Murray cites figures :
of economic growth (4.7 per cent
in Truman's last five years and j
2.8 per cent in Eisenhower's first
five years) which implies that the '
Democrats espouse sound eco- :
nomics where the Republicans do j

not. He fails to note two basic
facts primarily responsible for
the variance in economic growth:
1. The buildup of the military es
tablishment following the 1945 de
mobilization and accompanying
I our entry into Korea; and 2. That
by 19fj2, consumer production
had, to a large degree, met the
demand created over the war
years.
Critical thinking enjoins one
not. to accept cliches blindly. To
j have been consistent, it would
| have been wiser for Mr. Murray
to have criticized the editorial and
article in substance without at
tempting an appeal to the read
ers, by implying that his view is
the result of critical thinking and
those who oppose his view
blindly clutch for cliches.

Clutch for Cliches
lCditor, the Daily:
Interestingly, iho article by Mr.
Murray in yesterday's Daily fie-1
nouneing cliches contained a
cliche or two of its own. Wilh
great respect for the tenets of
critical thinking to which Murray
alludes, the reader was not much
assisted by references to "classi- j
cal liberal doctrine," (about which
neither Nixon nor the criticized
article spoke) nor much won to
the cause of honest analysis by
dramatic allusions to Nixon's "de
votion to McCarthyism," and ad
herence to "the morally and po
litically impoverished doctrine of
massive retaliation."
The analysis disposed of Nixon .
and his party without regard to
the substance of the issues raised
in the criticized article. It was
inadequate in that it displayed, j
as to the Vice President, an in- j
tuitive predisposition.
Regarding the imp<Vtant sub
stantive issue which he himself
raised, Mr. Murray cites figures :
of economic growth (4.7 per cent
in Truman's last five years and j
2.8 per cent in Eisenhower's first
five years) which implies that the '
Democrats espouse sound eco- :
nomics where the Republicans do j

not. He fails to note two basic
facts primarily responsible for
the variance in economic growth:
1. The buildup of the military es
tablishment following the 1945 de
mobilization and accompanying
I our entry into Korea; and 2. That
by 19fj2, consumer production
had, to a large degree, met the
demand created over the war
years.
Critical thinking enjoins one
not. to accept cliches blindly. To
j have been consistent, it would

to have criticized the editorial and

tempting an appeal to the read

Shameful Shallowness
Kditor, the Daily:
LASSII has made an astonish
ing but accurate reply to your ed

Pete Whitehead cannot conceive
of expressing opinions on matters
which will not he immediately
righted by their doing so; Kathy
Cullinan either finds the student
body incapable of criminal malice
(though the Cordry case is still
I very much in our minds) or else
| she feels that ideas and philoso
phies of government do not affect
us, and are not therefore deserv
ing of our attention.
It might be observed that Sasha
Lanz. whose pioneer work on the
problem of bicycles at Stanford
has been outstanding, was violent
ly opposed to LASSU's taking ac
tion on the NDEA though even
Miss Cullinan admits this issue
might possibly affect us.
The provincialism selfishness,
if you will in which our student
government is looted was demon
strated again at last Thursday's
LASSU meeting. A representative
j from the National, Students As
\ sociation, a group devoted to ex
pressing •student opinion on mat
ters of national and international
concern, was repeatedly asked,
! "Could you explain the direct
benefits of such an organization
to us a little more clearly?"
What's in it for us? This ques
tion is apparently our one cri
terion for interest and action.
Rich Sundeen, ASSU president,
quite wisely advised anyone "with
even the slightest interest" in stu
dent government to run for of
fice; anything beyond the slight
est interest would be considered
out of place, and might reveal the
i shameful shallowness of our con
; cern.

Questions to LASSU
Editor, the Daily:
Some questions for the LASSU
! representatives:
1. Why has LASSU not ex
pressed any opinion on the lunch
[counter sitdown demonstrations

I in the South despite the fact that
1 this is solely a student affair?
2. What explains the fact that
other institutions of learning like
Harvard, Brandeis, M.1.T., Oberlin
and Wesleyan have felt obligated
to raise funds in order to help
Negro students in their fight
against segregation, whereas,
none of the members of LASSU
I has yet dared to disapprove or
I approve of the Negro students'
i action ?
3. What explains the indiffer
ence of LASSU on the South Afri
can crisis and yot this is a gov
ernment that lias virtually denied
all academic freedom to its eiti
; /ens?
4. Is LASSU going to lake a
stand on the case of Professor
- L. F. Koch whose exercise of aca
demic freedom jnas cost him his
job in the University of Illinois?
Stanford University is one of
I the leading institutions of learn
ing, and LASSU must bear the
responsibility of keeping it that
way rather than confining it to
the selling of bicycle lights, to
use the Daily editor's example,
and writing defensive letters.

Questions to LASSU
Editor, the Daily:
Some questions for the LASSU
! representatives:
1. Why has LASSU not ex
pressed any opinion on the lunch
[counter sitdown demonstrations

I in the South despite the fact that
1 this is solely a student affair?
2. What explains the fact that
other institutions of learning like
Harvard, Brandeis, M.1.T., Oberlin
and Wesleyan have felt obligated
to raise funds in order to help
Negro students in their fight
against segregation, whereas,
none of the members of LASSU
I has yet dared to disapprove or
I approve of the Negro students'
i action ?
3. What explains the indiffer
ence of LASSU on the South Afri
can crisis and yot this is a gov
ernment that lias virtually denied
all academic freedom to its eiti
; /ens?
4. Is LASSU going to lake a
stand on the case of Professor
- L. F. Koch whose exercise of aca
demic freedom jnas cost him his
job in the University of Illinois?
Stanford University is one of
I the leading institutions of learn
ing, and LASSU must bear the
responsibility of keeping it that
way rather than confining it to
the selling of bicycle lights, to
use the Daily editor's example,
and writing defensive letters.

For the sake of student govern

Monday's letter to the editor by

government as a whole. The let
ter manifests either a discourag
ing ignorance of the issue in
volved or a distressing misunder
standing of it.
I can understand that LASSU
might not feel itself qualified or
able to express itself on major is
sues, but I cannot believe that it
should completely ignore them
and confine itself if) matters per
taining solely to campus activi
ties. In an age that demands an
j awareness of the major problems
in society today, especially on the
part of the so-called educated

nistic. If the Legislature does not
.want to commit itself on an issue,
' it can at least attempt to gener
ate some constructive thought on
it.
Cannot something be done to
inject into campus politics issues
of meaning and significance to
university students, who will find
themselves much too soon the un

Holy War
Editor, the Daily:
The New York Times, in study
ing the results of the Wisconsin
primary last week, has concluded |
in part that "to the extent that
religion as such made or lost votes
on either side, this is a seriously
negative, discouraging factor in
the American scene."
The fact 1 of the religious issue
is indeed ugly. It was twisted into j
a familiar, subtle but totally bar
baric leer this past weekend by
Vice President Nixon who at - <
tacked Senaior Kennedy, the
Roman Catholic, by reopening the
religiously exploded issue of birth
controls at this time. Nixon de- j
dared, according to a UPI story j
printed in the Chronicle of April
10, that his remarks were not "po- j
litical." This is given the lie, how
ever, by the calculated timing of i
Nixon's statement.
Why has Nixon waited until
this moment, between the Wiscon
sin and West Virginia primaries. |
to disagree with President Eisen
hower's statement of December. ,
1959, in public? 1 cannot believe
there is such a man as a "New
Nixon." A leader for an American
"Holy War" has marched right

Clutch for Cliches
lCditor, the Daily:
Interestingly, iho article by Mr.
Murray in yesterday's Daily fie-1
nouneing cliches contained a
cliche or two of its own. Wilh
great respect for the tenets of
critical thinking to which Murray
alludes, the reader was not much
assisted by references to "classi- j
cal liberal doctrine," (about which
neither Nixon nor the criticized
article spoke) nor much won to
the cause of honest analysis by
dramatic allusions to Nixon's "de
votion to McCarthyism," and ad
herence to "the morally and po
litically impoverished doctrine of
massive retaliation."
The analysis disposed of Nixon .
and his party without regard to
the substance of the issues raised
in the criticized article. It was
inadequate in that it displayed, j
as to the Vice President, an in- j
tuitive predisposition.
Regarding the imp<Vtant sub
stantive issue which he himself
raised, Mr. Murray cites figures :
of economic growth (4.7 per cent
in Truman's last five years and j
2.8 per cent in Eisenhower's first
five years) which implies that the '
Democrats espouse sound eco- :
nomics where the Republicans do j

not. He fails to note two basic
facts primarily responsible for
the variance in economic growth:
1. The buildup of the military es
tablishment following the 1945 de
mobilization and accompanying
I our entry into Korea; and 2. That
by 19fj2, consumer production
had, to a large degree, met the
demand created over the war
years.
Critical thinking enjoins one
not. to accept cliches blindly. To
j have been consistent, it would
| have been wiser for Mr. Murray
to have criticized the editorial and
article in substance without at
tempting an appeal to the read
ers, by implying that his view is
the result of critical thinking and
those who oppose his view
blindly clutch for cliches.

Clutch for Cliches
lCditor, the Daily:
Interestingly, iho article by Mr.
Murray in yesterday's Daily fie-1
nouneing cliches contained a
cliche or two of its own. Wilh
great respect for the tenets of
critical thinking to which Murray
alludes, the reader was not much
assisted by references to "classi- j
cal liberal doctrine," (about which
neither Nixon nor the criticized
article spoke) nor much won to
the cause of honest analysis by
dramatic allusions to Nixon's "de
votion to McCarthyism," and ad
herence to "the morally and po
litically impoverished doctrine of
massive retaliation."
The analysis disposed of Nixon .
and his party without regard to
the substance of the issues raised
in the criticized article. It was
inadequate in that it displayed, j
as to the Vice President, an in- j
tuitive predisposition.
Regarding the imp<Vtant sub
stantive issue which he himself
raised, Mr. Murray cites figures :
of economic growth (4.7 per cent
in Truman's last five years and j
2.8 per cent in Eisenhower's first
five years) which implies that the '
Democrats espouse sound eco- :
nomics where the Republicans do j

not. He fails to note two basic
facts primarily responsible for
the variance in economic growth:
1. The buildup of the military es
tablishment following the 1945 de
mobilization and accompanying
I our entry into Korea; and 2. That
by 19fj2, consumer production
had, to a large degree, met the
demand created over the war
years.
Critical thinking enjoins one
not. to accept cliches blindly. To
j have been consistent, it would

to have criticized the editorial and

tempting an appeal to the read

Shameful Shallowness
Kditor, the Daily:
LASSII has made an astonish

Pete Whitehead cannot conceive
of expressing opinions on matters
which will not he immediately
righted by their doing so; Kathy
Cullinan either finds the student
body incapable of criminal malice
(though the Cordry case is still
I very much in our minds) or else
| she feels that ideas and philoso
phies of government do not affect
us, and are not therefore deserv
ing of our attention.
It might be observed that Sasha
Lanz. whose pioneer work on the
problem of bicycles at Stanford
has been outstanding, was violent
ly opposed to LASSU's taking ac
tion on the NDEA though even
Miss Cullinan admits this issue
might possibly affect us.
The provincialism selfishness,
if you will in which our student
government is looted was demon
strated again at last Thursday's
LASSU meeting. A representative
j from the National, Students As
\ sociation, a group devoted to ex
pressing •student opinion on mat
ters of national and international
concern, was repeatedly asked,
! "Could you explain the direct
benefits of such an organization
to us a little more clearly?"
What's in it for us? This ques
tion is apparently our one cri
terion for interest and action.
Rich Sundeen, ASSU president,
quite wisely advised anyone "with
even the slightest interest" in stu
dent government to run for of
fice; anything beyond the slight
est interest would be considered
out of place, and might reveal the
i shameful shallowness of our con
; cern.

Questions to LASSU
Editor, the Daily:
Some questions for the LASSU
! representatives:
1. Why has LASSU not ex
pressed any opinion on the lunch
[counter sitdown demonstrations

I in the South despite the fact that
1 this is solely a student affair?
2. What explains the fact that
other institutions of learning like
Harvard, Brandeis, M.1.T., Oberlin
and Wesleyan have felt obligated
to raise funds in order to help
Negro students in their fight
against segregation, whereas,
none of the members of LASSU
I has yet dared to disapprove or
I approve of the Negro students'
i action ?
3. What explains the indiffer
ence of LASSU on the South Afri
can crisis and yot this is a gov
ernment that lias virtually denied
all academic freedom to its eiti
; /ens?
4. Is LASSU going to lake a
stand on the case of Professor
- L. F. Koch whose exercise of aca
demic freedom jnas cost him his
job in the University of Illinois?
Stanford University is one of
I the leading institutions of learn
ing, and LASSU must bear the
responsibility of keeping it that
way rather than confining it to
the selling of bicycle lights, to
use the Daily editor's example,
and writing defensive letters.

I can understand that LASSU
might not feel itself qualified or

might possibly affect us.
The provincialism selfishness,
if you will in which our student
government is looted was demon
strated again at last Thursday's
LASSU meeting. A representative
j from the National, Students As
\ sociation, a group devoted to ex
pressing •student opinion on mat
ters of national and international
concern, was repeatedly asked,
! "Could you explain the direct
benefits of such an organization
to us a little more clearly?"
What's in it for us? This ques
tion is apparently our one cri
terion for interest and action.
Rich Sundeen, ASSU president,
quite wisely advised anyone "with
even the slightest interest" in stu
dent government to run for of
fice; anything beyond the slight
est interest would be considered
out of place, and might reveal the
i shameful shallowness of our con
; cern.

A Mold
Kditor, tiie Daily:
Mr. Rosenthal and others of
like mind, you tempt me to place
I you at ihe head of that group of
students that have no mind and
are too lazy to develop one. How
in heaven's name do you propose
' to encourage the students to ques
tion the world around and reform
ulate standards if there is a body
that automatically grinds out an
swers and reformulations for
them?
i The day the LASSU starts mak-
I ing up its mind what I think about
world issues. I shall go off and
live in Russia, where, at least,
i they get paid vacations and
1 dmeals for giving up a part of
their freedom.
Doesn't it occur to you that the
LASSU is a body primarily set
up to resolve student affairs, and
that if it has no resolving func
tion it turns into another super
fluous body voicing unheeded op
inions? Grant me, if you will,
that this campus represents a
broad range of opinion. And you
would force all of this wonder
fully conflicting and •stimulating
i opinion into a mold to represent
. the opinion of Stanford, simply
J because the University is bigger
| than the individual. Is it really?

Questions to LASSU
Editor, the Daily:
Some questions for the LASSU
! representatives:
1. Why has LASSU not ex
pressed any opinion on the lunch
[counter sitdown demonstrations

I in the South despite the fact that
1 this is solely a student affair?
2. What explains the fact that
other institutions of learning like
Harvard, Brandeis, M.1.T., Oberlin
and Wesleyan have felt obligated
to raise funds in order to help
Negro students in their fight
against segregation, whereas,
none of the members of LASSU
I has yet dared to disapprove or
I approve of the Negro students'
i action ?
3. What explains the indiffer
ence of LASSU on the South Afri
can crisis and yot this is a gov
ernment that lias virtually denied
all academic freedom to its eiti
; /ens?
4. Is LASSU going to lake a
stand on the case of Professor
- L. F. Koch whose exercise of aca
demic freedom jnas cost him his
job in the University of Illinois?
Stanford University is one of
I the leading institutions of learn
ing, and LASSU must bear the
responsibility of keeping it that
way rather than confining it to
the selling of bicycle lights, to
use the Daily editor's example,
and writing defensive letters.

New Idea
Editor, flii' Daily:
For the sake of student govern
| ment at Stanford, I hope that
Monday's letter to the editor by
two LASSU members does not
represent the attitude of student
government as a whole. The let
ter manifests either a discourag
ing ignorance of the issue in
volved or a distressing misunder
standing of it.
I can understand that LASSU
might not feel itself qualified or
able to express itself on major is
sues, but I cannot believe that it
should completely ignore them
and confine itself if) matters per
taining solely to campus activi
ties. In an age that demands an
j awareness of the major problems
in society today, especially on the
part of the so-called educated
! elite, such an attitude is anachro
nistic. If the Legislature does not
.want to commit itself on an issue,
' it can at least attempt to gener
ate some constructive thought on
it.
Cannot something be done to
inject into campus politics issues
of meaning and significance to
university students, who will find
themselves much too soon the un
willing heirs of the headaches of
ihe world? An intransigent de
fense of LASSU's present posi
tion and its unwillingness to ad
just itself points to the need for
j a new idea in student govern
j ment.

Holy War
Editor, the Daily:
The New York Times, in study
ing the results of the Wisconsin
primary last week, has concluded |
in part that "to the extent that
religion as such made or lost votes
on either side, this is a seriously
negative, discouraging factor in
the American scene."
The fact 1 of the religious issue
is indeed ugly. It was twisted into j
a familiar, subtle but totally bar
baric leer this past weekend by
Vice President Nixon who at - <
tacked Senaior Kennedy, the
Roman Catholic, by reopening the
religiously exploded issue of birth
controls at this time. Nixon de- j
dared, according to a UPI story j
printed in the Chronicle of April
10, that his remarks were not "po- j
litical." This is given the lie, how
ever, by the calculated timing of i
Nixon's statement.
Why has Nixon waited until
this moment, between the Wiscon
sin and West Virginia primaries. |
to disagree with President Eisen
hower's statement of December. ,
1959, in public? 1 cannot believe
there is such a man as a "New
Nixon." A leader for an American
"Holy War" has marched right
out of an expected corner.

Clutch for Cliches
lCditor, the Daily:
Interestingly, iho article by Mr.
Murray in yesterday's Daily fie-1
nouneing cliches contained a
cliche or two of its own. Wilh
great respect for the tenets of
critical thinking to which Murray
alludes, the reader was not much
assisted by references to "classi- j
cal liberal doctrine," (about which
neither Nixon nor the criticized
article spoke) nor much won to
the cause of honest analysis by
dramatic allusions to Nixon's "de
votion to McCarthyism," and ad
herence to "the morally and po
litically impoverished doctrine of
massive retaliation."
The analysis disposed of Nixon .
and his party without regard to
the substance of the issues raised
in the criticized article. It was
inadequate in that it displayed, j
as to the Vice President, an in- j
tuitive predisposition.
Regarding the imp<Vtant sub
stantive issue which he himself
raised, Mr. Murray cites figures :
of economic growth (4.7 per cent
in Truman's last five years and j
2.8 per cent in Eisenhower's first
five years) which implies that the '
Democrats espouse sound eco- :
nomics where the Republicans do j

not. He fails to note two basic
facts primarily responsible for
the variance in economic growth:
1. The buildup of the military es
tablishment following the 1945 de
mobilization and accompanying
I our entry into Korea; and 2. That
by 19fj2, consumer production
had, to a large degree, met the
demand created over the war
years.
Critical thinking enjoins one
not. to accept cliches blindly. To
j have been consistent, it would
| have been wiser for Mr. Murray
to have criticized the editorial and
article in substance without at
tempting an appeal to the read
ers, by implying that his view is
the result of critical thinking and
those who oppose his view
blindly clutch for cliches.

Shameful Shallowness
Kditor, the Daily:
LASSII has made an astonish
ing but accurate reply to your ed
itorial of April 6. Sasha Lanz and
Pete Whitehead cannot conceive
of expressing opinions on matters
which will not he immediately
righted by their doing so; Kathy
Cullinan either finds the student
body incapable of criminal malice
(though the Cordry case is still
I very much in our minds) or else
| she feels that ideas and philoso
phies of government do not affect
us, and are not therefore deserv
ing of our attention.
It might be observed that Sasha
Lanz. whose pioneer work on the
problem of bicycles at Stanford
has been outstanding, was violent
ly opposed to LASSU's taking ac
tion on the NDEA though even
Miss Cullinan admits this issue
might possibly affect us.
The provincialism selfishness,
if you will in which our student
government is looted was demon
strated again at last Thursday's
