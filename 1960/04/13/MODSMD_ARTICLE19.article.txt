## "NO PARKING" 
### Author of "I Was a Teen-age Dwarf", "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis", etc 
As everyone knows, the most serious problem facing American
colleges today is the shortage of parking space for students' cars.
Many remedies have been offered to solve I his vexing dilemma.
For instance, it has been suggested that all students be required
to drive small foreign sjwrts cars which can be carried in the
purse or pocket. This would, of course, solve the parking prob
lem but it would make double dating impossible—unless, that
is, the boys make the girls run along behind the car. Hut that
is no solution either because by the time they get to the pnwn
the girls will be panting so hard that they will wilt their corsages.
Another suggested cure for our parking woes is that all
students smoke Marlboro cigarettes. At first glance this seems
an excellent solution because we all know Marlboro is the
cigarette which proved that flavor did not go out when filters
came in—and when we sit around and smoke good Marlboros
we are so possessed by sweet contentment that none of us
wishes ever to leave, which means no gadding about which
means no driving, which means no parking problem.
Hut the argument in favor of Marlboros overlooks one im
portant fact: when you run out of Marlboros you must go get,
some more, which means driving, which means parking, which
means you're right back where you started.
Probably the most practical suggestion to alleviate the campus
parking situation is to tear down every school of dentistry in
the country and turn it into a parking lot. This is not to say
that dentistry is unimportant. (Jracious, no! Dentistry is im
ixtrtant and vital and a shining p:irt of our American heritage.
Hut the fact is there is no real need for separate schools of den
tistry. Dentistry could easily be moved to the school of mining
engineering. Surely anyone who can drill a thousand feet for
oil can fill a simple little cavity.

This experiment—combining dentistry with mining engineer
ing— has already been tried at several colleges and with some
very interesting results. Take, for instance, the case of a dental
student named Fred (\ Sigafoos. One day recently Fred was
out practicing with his drilling rig in a vacant lot just oIT
campus. He sank a shaft two hundred feet deep and, to his
surprise and delight, he struck a detergent mine. For a while
Fred thought his fortune was made but he soon learned that
he had drilled into the storage tank of the Eagle Laundry.
Walter I'. Eagle, president of the laundry, was mad all net
out and things looked mighty black for Fred. Hut it all ended
well. When Mr. Eagle called Fred into his oflice to chew him
out, it so happened that Mr. Eagle's beautiful daughter, Patient
(iriselda, was present. For years Patient (iriselda had been
patiently waiting for the right man. "That's him!" she cried
upon spying Fred—and today Fred is a full partner in the Eagle
Laundry in charge of pleats and ruffles. ' iw>«> m»* shuironn
