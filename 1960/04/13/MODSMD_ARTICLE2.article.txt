### 
WASHINGTON i/P) Sen.
Hubert H. Humphrey said yester
day that Sen. John F. Kennedy
will be "well on the way to tying
up tho nomination" if he wins the
West Virginia Democratic presi
dential primary.
The Minnesota senator told a
news conference, however, that
he expects to defeat Kennedy in
the May 10 voting and "if I do
I think I will be on the way to
winning considerably more sup
port."
In response ot a question as to
whether he agreed with an asser
tion Monday by Vice President
Richard M. Nixon that the Massa
chusetts senator would be the
Democratic nominee if he won in
West Virginia, Humphrey said he
thought "that's reasonable."
