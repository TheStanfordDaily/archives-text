"They're Touglr
"They're tough," said wiry George Bates as he descended from
the I'SA Elect ra that has jus! brought him and hi-s six Stanford
team mates hack from a weekend of tennis matches in Los Angeles.
"Easy Ed," as Bates is known by his teammates and friends, probably
came up with the understatement of the year. For eighteen years
Stanford tenuis teams have been traveling to Los Angeles to play
UCLA and in all those eighteen years not once has the Ked and
White gotten better than a 3-6 loss at the hands of the Bruins. And
USC has not been too obliging either. The Trojans have fielded sev
eral close to excellent tennis aggregations over the last two decades,
and have only lost on rare occasions to the boys from the Farm.
However, out of all the disaster of last weekend the Indians did
find out one cheering fact about their team. They have one darn
good player. Good enough to play with the best individuals in the
country.
Dick Ogden, who has been maturing tennis wise quite rapidly

the last few months, went out on
the court last Friday with what
was supposed to be close to col
lege's best tennis player. IK EA's
Earry Nagler. The only loss Nag
ier had sustained to a collegiate
player this year was to his team
mate Alan Fox, and he had re
versed this defeat in double.
Ogden started fast piling up a
solid lead in the opening set and
never really let Nagler get back
to anywhere near a commanding
position. The final score of the
match was (Â»-2, 1-6, 7-.i. Ogden ihe
winner.
The next day. Ogden was not
so successful losing a close three
set match to USC's Greg Grant.
However, Grant won only by
playing close to his greatest ever
match (according to USC Coach
George Toleyi.
Next week the AAVVU singles
championships will be held at
Ojai, Calif., and that will prob
ably be a real test of pressure

tennis. Nagler, Fox, Grant, Og
den, IMI Hoogs of Cal, Hob Delgado and Ld Atkinson of SC, Rog
Werksman and Norm Perry of UCLA, and Jim Jeffries of Stanford
will all be thrown into one big elimination tournament.
The winner of such a tournament will have had to play start
lingly consistent tennis because each match will be against top
notch material and any mistake could prove fatal to one's cham
pionship hopes.

The Girls Are Pretty Good
If nothing else O.jai probably will provide Stanford with fine ten
nis championship the Women's Collegiate Title. Stanford has a
pretty tough trio of female net stars. Sue llodgnuin, who will play j
singles down at O.jai, is currently the number twenty ranking wom
an play in the nation and number two in the Midwest. Vickie Bnllis
and Tina Kodi. as good looking as they are good tennis players, will
be playing doubles for Stanford. Both Tina and Vicki come from
the fertile tennis courts of Southern California. Last year Tina and
Sue won the doubles title at O.jai with the singles title going to form
er Pomona star Darieue Hard.
One question which popped up amongst the Stanford tennis
players and many tennis followers while Stanford was playing USC
was where were Ed Atkinson and Rafael Osuna? Osuna is a Mexican
p!a\ who matriculated at SC last year and set Los Angeles afire
with claims of a new Alex Olmedo. The chunky netter, however,
has had trouble getting his tennis and studies on equal pars and j
so he will be ineligible at least for the remainder of this season.
Ed Atkinson who has made everybody's hard luck list this year
for a change was in good health last weekend, but spent Saturday'
moi ning taking the Law School Entrance Exams and therefore
couldn't do too much tennising at the same time.
Last year .just before the season opened Atkinson got bopped on
ihe head with a beer bottle and came close to losing his life. He 1
was peacefully walking into a Los Angeles tavern when some well
stewed chap mistook Atkinson for a long lost enemy. He attacked
the innocent tennis player without realizing he had the wrong man,
and before the bartender could tear him away the fellow had prac
tically carved his initials in Ed's head. Fortunately, Atkinson is
again playing tennis.
However, Atkinson did have a bit of hard luck again this year. I
He was just rounding into top form when his number one practice
partner was detained at the Los Angeles Police Station It's been
several months now since Atkinson's been able to have a good prac
tice set since his partner's still at the police station. Who's his spar- t
ring mate? None other than the tennis playing doctor Bernard
I' inch. Well Ld, ( a role may need a partner now too.

Well, Ed?
