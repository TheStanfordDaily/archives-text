# Sermon Ruled Out In Royal Wedding
## 
### 
LONDON (/I 3 ) Princess Marga
ret will promise to obey common
er Antony Armstrong-Jones at
their wedding May 6. But she will
not listen to a sermon from Eng
land's leading churchman.
_A disclosure that the princess
wants no sermon, not even from
the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Dr. Geoffrey Fisher, who will per
form the ceremony, was made
yesterday by Dr. Eric S. Abbott,
the dean of Westminster Abbey.
The princess, a devoted church
goer, prefers to hear words "from
Christ himself," Dean Abbott said.
Instead of a sermon she will
hear the Beatitudes from the Ser
mon on the Mount, from the fifth
chapter of St. Matthew.
The princess, said Dean Abbott,
has firm ideas on the religious
aspects of the service and the ar
rangements in Westminster Ab
bey.
Normally at least half of the
2,000 spectators would have had
no good view of the service, but
at Margaret's suggestion televi
sion screens will be fixed on pil
lars so that the service may be
followed by guests.
