# VISITING EDUCATORS
## Swedish Educational System, School Problems Discussed 
### Mary Lou Mckinley, Managing Editor 
Educational problems in both Sweden and the United States
are basically the same, although tin 1 solutions employed in each
country may be quite different, two prominent educators from the
Swedish government said in a press interview yesterday.
Mauritz Hulteberg, member of the Royal Swedish Board of

Education and head of school
planning and construction, and
Olio Wahlstrom. chief architect
for the National Board of Con
struction and Research, were on
campus to consult with members
of the School Planning Labora
tory as part of their four-week
trip to study school architecture
and building in this country.
Small Student Bodies
The two men agreed that al
though Swedish schools could
benefit from the spaciousness and
'potential flexibility' visible in
U.S. school design, the number of
pupils in each will be kept down
to about a thousand or less.
Although faced with the prob
lem of over - crowded schools.
Hulteberg said that in Sweden
they hope to avoid the impersonal
aspect that large schools tend to
have by keeping down the enroll
ment in each.
Transitional Period
Explaining the Swedish educa
tional system. Hulteberg said that
it was now in a transitional
period and has been since 1950
when a new education act in
creased the compulsory school
years from seven to nine.
Their comphrensive school sys
tem is divided into three stages:
grades one through three, four
through six and seven through
nine. After this may come further
education at a gymnasium and
then at one of the four universi
ties in Sweden or the two techni
cal universities.
More Science
Concerning differences in the
educational systems of the two
countries, Hulteberg said that
progressive education in the U.S.
has greatly influenced the ele
mentary schools in Sweden dur
ing the last three decades.
However, he said that during
his trip to this country he has
gained the impression that Swed
en lays much more emphasis on
science than does the U.S.

SWEDISH EDUCATORS ADMIRE FLEXIBILITY

Educational problems in both Sweden and the United States
are basically the same, although tin 1 solutions employed in each
country may be quite different, two prominent educators from the
Swedish government said in a press interview yesterday.
Mauritz Hulteberg, member of the Royal Swedish Board of

Education and head of school
planning and construction, and
Olio Wahlstrom. chief architect
for the National Board of Con
struction and Research, were on
campus to consult with members
of the School Planning Labora
tory as part of their four-week
trip to study school architecture
and building in this country.
Small Student Bodies
The two men agreed that al
though Swedish schools could
benefit from the spaciousness and
'potential flexibility' visible in
U.S. school design, the number of
pupils in each will be kept down
to about a thousand or less.
Although faced with the prob
lem of over - crowded schools.
Hulteberg said that in Sweden
they hope to avoid the impersonal
aspect that large schools tend to
have by keeping down the enroll
ment in each.
Transitional Period
Explaining the Swedish educa
tional system. Hulteberg said that
it was now in a transitional
period and has been since 1950
when a new education act in
creased the compulsory school
years from seven to nine.
Their comphrensive school sys
tem is divided into three stages:
grades one through three, four
through six and seven through
nine. After this may come further
education at a gymnasium and
then at one of the four universi
ties in Sweden or the two techni
cal universities.
More Science
Concerning differences in the
educational systems of the two
countries, Hulteberg said that
progressive education in the U.S.
has greatly influenced the ele
mentary schools in Sweden dur
ing the last three decades.
However, he said that during
his trip to this country he has
gained the impression that Swed
en lays much more emphasis on
science than does the U.S.
