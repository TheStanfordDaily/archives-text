# Stuart: Nixon Best Qualified For President
## 
### 
Since it is the President who is
responsible for defining and for
mulating our foreign policy, Vice-
President Nixon is the best quali
fied presidential candidate, Politi
cal Science Professor Graham H.
| Stuart said at the Tuesday Evc
. ning Series last night.
Graham spoke on "Who Makes
! Our Foreign Policy?"
Through his membership in the
i National Security Council and
travels as the President's repre
sentative, Nixon has gained valu
able experience in the field of for
eign affairs, said Stuart. He
I added that Nixon is a firm be
i liever in international coopera
tion.
Stuart cited Adlai Stevenson as
the best qualified Democratic
candidate, in view of his UN con
tributions and diplomatic tours,
but he also acclaimed Kennedy
for his experience in London and
as a member of the Senate For
eign Relations Committee. Ken
nedy's foreign policy, Stuart said,
is not very different from that of
the Eisenhower administration.
Stuart agreed with Vice-Presi
dent Nixon's Monday address in
saying that "The Ugly American"
j presents a biased view of the for
eign service. He pointed out the
number of well-trained career
diplomats in most countries to
day.
"Presidential control of for
eign policy is handicapped,"
Stuart concluded, "by the demo
critic system of cumbersome
checks and balances."
