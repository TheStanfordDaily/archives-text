# WESTERN MINISTERS MEET
## Summit Conference Looms As Battle Of Words, Not Vehicle of Peace 
### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
The approaching summit,con
ference, like the deadlocked dis
armament conference, promises
to be more and more a propa
ganda battle and less and less a
vehicle for easing East-West ten
sions .
British Foreign Minister Sel
wyn Lloyd is the only major fig
ure who expesses hope for con
crete agreements, and even his
classical diplomatic approach is
qualified by a warning against
hoping for too much.
The Western Big Three for
eign ministers are currently meet
ing in a three day pro-summit
conference in Washington.
Disarmament Issue
The Allies have been playing
around with the idea that the So
viet Union really wants to start

lon disarmament, that this can be
made the conference's chief topic,
and that it can be used to turn
aside Soviet pressure on the mat
ter of Berlin.
Nothing at Geneva has indicat
ed that they can make sufficient
concessions on disarmament to
get anything moving on that is
sue. much less to buy Soviet eon
cessions at other points.
Berlin
Instead, Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev's insistence on Allied
withdrawal from Berlin, under
threat of a separate Soviet peace
treaty transferring traffic control
to East Germany, suggests it is
still the major topic in his mind.
The Soviet desire is to start dis
armament in Europe and in Amer
ican military bases abroad, dis
rupting NATO in return for a
I mere paper dissolution of the

Warsaw pact, which is meaning
less anyway as long as the
U.S.S.R. controls the East Eu
ropean satellites.
The West isn't even considering
such a thing.
New Approach?
As the Allied foreign ministers
meet in Washington they would
he glad to find some new ap
proach which would put the So
viet Union on the defensive before
world public opinion, hut their
chief search is for means of keep
ing the Communists from doing
the same to them.
By repeatedly avowing thai he
has no respect for solemn agree
ments already in effect regarding
Berlin. Khrushchev heightens the
feeling that the U.S.S.R. cannot
be relied upon to live up to any
commitments which might hamp
i er her in the future.

The West isn't even considering
such a thing.
New Approach?
As the Allied foreign ministers
meet in Washington they would

proach which would put the So
viet Union on the defensive before
world public opinion, hut their
chief search is for means of keep
ing the Communists from doing
the same to them.
By repeatedly avowing thai he

Berlin. Khrushchev heightens the
feeling that the U.S.S.R. cannot
be relied upon to live up to any
commitments which might hamp

The approaching summit,con
ference, like the deadlocked dis
armament conference, promises
to be more and more a propa
ganda battle and less and less a
vehicle for easing East-West ten
sions .
British Foreign Minister Sel
wyn Lloyd is the only major fig
ure who expesses hope for con
crete agreements, and even his
classical diplomatic approach is
qualified by a warning against
hoping for too much.
The Western Big Three for

conference in Washington.
Disarmament Issue
The Allies have been playing
around with the idea that the So
viet Union really wants to start

lon disarmament, that this can be
made the conference's chief topic,
and that it can be used to turn
aside Soviet pressure on the mat
ter of Berlin.
Nothing at Geneva has indicat
ed that they can make sufficient
concessions on disarmament to
get anything moving on that is
sue. much less to buy Soviet eon
cessions at other points.
Berlin
Instead, Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev's insistence on Allied
withdrawal from Berlin, under
threat of a separate Soviet peace
treaty transferring traffic control
to East Germany, suggests it is
still the major topic in his mind.
The Soviet desire is to start dis
armament in Europe and in Amer
ican military bases abroad, dis
rupting NATO in return for a
I mere paper dissolution of the

Warsaw pact, which is meaning
less anyway as long as the
U.S.S.R. controls the East Eu
ropean satellites.
