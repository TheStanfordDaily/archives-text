A Stanford student said the
other day:
"Why should I consider buying life
insurance now? Why not wait until
I'm out of college earning some real
money? Be ides, why buy life insur
ance now to "protect" a future wife
and children? I'm single and my par
ents don't need the protection. The
rates don't go up very rapidly at my
age anyhow. There's plenty of time
to insure myself a few years from
now when I'm established."
Wc believe that Stanford student
overlooked a few facts:
Insurability ' a precious quality. You
cannot count on passing a physical
examination for life insurance "any
old time." Ask any doctor. Without
! insurability you may face an "ago
nizing reappraisal" of your financial
future.
Will your future work carry a higher
premium becausc of extra hazards?
As a student you may be able to buy
insurance at minimum rates now.
Ask us about the new plan that will
guarantee your future insurability,
regardless of health or occupation.
We realise that most students have
limited funds, but under our per
sonal arrangement, this problem may
be solved. Send us a note or tele
phone us to get the details.
