# TRANSIT IB
## Navigation Satellite in Earth Orbit 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) A naviga
tional satellMc designed to help
submarines, ships and planes ai
| ways know precisely where they
are ir. any weather was sent or
biting around the earth 400 miles
high yesterday.
The experimental satellite is in
tended as the forerunner of a
system of four globe-trotting
spheres which will radio down a
constant stream of information
to he translated into the latitude
and longitude positions needed by
navigators.
Transit IB
The satellite named Transit
iIB was launched by the Air
Force for the Navy atop a two
stage rocket system al 7:03 a.m.
from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Al
most immediately success began
to show when tracking stations
in the United States, Newfound
land and England started picking
up radio signals while the rocket
was still climbing skyward.
That the satellite was in orbit
was confirmed about I'a hours
later. As it soared in from the
; west the sphere was picked up by
I tracking stations in New Mexico,
Texas and elsewhere after its
] first trip around the earth.
Several hours later, however,
the Navy said the satellite went
into an elliptical orbit instead of
the planned circular one about
j 400 to 500 miles high. It said the
satellite was orbiting as high as
179 miles and approaching 233
miles from the earth.
.May Perish Early
This, the Navy explained, means
1 Transit IB may be pulled back
l into the atmosphere and burn it
fself up in possibly 16 months in
-1 stead of lasting the originally
j estimated half a century.
The satellite is the eighth U.S.
I earth satellite now in orbit. The
i Soviet Union has no earth satel
lite currently aloft but has two
'satellites in orbit around the sun.
! U.S. Pioneer V also is in orbit
: around the sun.
Weighs 265 Pounds
The sphere sent up yesterday
: weighed 265 pounds counting its
| chemical batteries and other test
1 equipment. A Thor missile, with
a 150,000 pound thrust, was used
to launch it. Smaller, cheaper
boosters can be used for the 50
to 100 pound satellites contem
plated for the operating system.
The great advantage of the
Transit system over conventional
navigation methods such as celes
tial observations is that it can be
used in any weather day or
night by ships, submarines and
j airplanes. No longer must a ship
! wait until clouds clear away to
find out where on the ocean it is
! located.

The satellite named Transit
iIB was launched by the Air
Force for the Navy atop a two
stage rocket system al 7:03 a.m.
from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Al
most immediately success began
to show when tracking stations
in the United States, Newfound
land and England started picking
up radio signals while the rocket
was still climbing skyward.
That the satellite was in orbit
was confirmed about I'a hours
later. As it soared in from the
; west the sphere was picked up by
I tracking stations in New Mexico,
Texas and elsewhere after its
] first trip around the earth.
Several hours later, however,
the Navy said the satellite went
into an elliptical orbit instead of
the planned circular one about
j 400 to 500 miles high. It said the
satellite was orbiting as high as
179 miles and approaching 233
miles from the earth.
.May Perish Early
This, the Navy explained, means
1 Transit IB may be pulled back
l into the atmosphere and burn it
fself up in possibly 16 months in
-1 stead of lasting the originally
j estimated half a century.
The satellite is the eighth U.S.
I earth satellite now in orbit. The
i Soviet Union has no earth satel
lite currently aloft but has two
'satellites in orbit around the sun.
! U.S. Pioneer V also is in orbit
: around the sun.
Weighs 265 Pounds
The sphere sent up yesterday
: weighed 265 pounds counting its
| chemical batteries and other test
1 equipment. A Thor missile, with
a 150,000 pound thrust, was used
to launch it. Smaller, cheaper
boosters can be used for the 50
to 100 pound satellites contem
plated for the operating system.
The great advantage of the
Transit system over conventional
navigation methods such as celes
tial observations is that it can be
used in any weather day or
night by ships, submarines and
j airplanes. No longer must a ship
! wait until clouds clear away to
find out where on the ocean it is
