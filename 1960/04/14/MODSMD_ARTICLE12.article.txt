## Italy's Government Crisis 
### Dick White Contributing Editor 
Next to Fiance, Italy has had
the most hectic postwar political
scene, but she has not yet seen
fit to follow hfi' gallic sister in
the abolition of democracy. Italy
has t rierl to solve these problems
within the framework of her
democratic institutions and has
made great progress in rebuild
ing the war-devastated country.
Not since t ho governments of
Aleide de Gasperi ending in 1953
has any measure of unity been
achieved on the national scene.
He was aide at various times to
mould the Communists, Left and
Right Wing Socialists. Liberals,
and Republicans into coalition
governments during the first
eight years following the war.
De Gasperi was followed by
a number of Christian Demo
crats from both the left and
right wings of the party who
were never able to form lasting
cabinets. The most recent of
the line was Antonio Segni
who came into office after the
seven month coalition led by
Amintorc Fanlani, at liberal
( hristian Democrat.
Segni, a conservative in the
party, formed a government with
ihe support of the right-of-center
Liberal Party, the monarchists,
and the neo-Fascists in February
1959. At the convention of the
Christian Democratic Party in
Florence last fall, one-third of
the members lead by former
Prime Minister Fanfani criticized
the government's policy of accept
ing aid from the Fascists.
This was followed by Presi
dent Gronchi's rather humiliating
trip to Russia where his policy of
supporting the Western alliance
was attacked. Gronchi, himself a
liberal Christian Democrat, has
favored a leftward turn in the
government's orientation but has
not yet prevailed on the leaders
of his party.
Segni, in response to criticism,
had made overtures to the Nen
ni Socialists in hopes of bring
ing them into a coalition gov
ernment with a large parlia
mentary majority. Members of
the right wing of the Christian
Democrats and of the Liberal
Party have objected to this,
since the Nenni group has since
1947 been in a Popular Front
with the Communists.
The Nenni supporters com
fortably remained in alliance with
the Italian Communists until the
Hungarian Revolution. They de

| nounced the Russian intervention
and in 1959 revoked their electoral
agreement with the Communists.
The Catholic Church has opposed
any cooperation with them how
lever, and this influence is very
[strongly felt in Italian politics.
In March! the Liberal Party,
| previously supporting the Segni
: government, became wary of its
courting of Nenni aid and with
drew its support. The cabinet's
plurality was only cut from 80 to
1 50 votes, and it could still have
remained in power if ir had been
willing to rely on Fascist sup
port. The liberal Christian Dcrno
j crats would not stand for this,
land Segni was forced to submit
i his resignation to President Gron-
I chi although not defeated on any
vote of confidence.
This plunged Italy into its
worst postwar crisis. Scheduled
elections are not for three
years, and a parliamentary
stalemate has already been
reached. Fernando Tamhroni
was finally persuaded to form
a government, but since none
of tin' political problems had
been resolved, it could not hope
for stability.
Only the Fascists would sup
; port it, and the liberal Christian
I Democrats would not serve in this
' situation. On Monday, this cabinet
resigned, emphasizing the serious
ness of the crisis.
A grave political situation now
faces Italy. No government of the
j center can He formed that has a
j sufficient parliamentary majority
: to remain in power. The liberal
Christian Democrats will not ae
! eept Fascist support ,and the con
servative's seem unwilling to re
ceive any aid from the Nenni
Socialists. President Gronchi has
several alternatives open to him
to relieve the crisis.
1. He can call special parlia
mentary elections in hopes that
this will change the political
scene, but there are no indica
tions that it will.
2. Since he is known to favor
an alliance with the Nenni
group, he can act to bring them
into the government. If a gov
ernment of the Christian Demo
crats, the Socialists, the Social
Democrats — a pro - Western
group who split with Nenni at
the time of the Communist al
liance —and the liberal Repub
licans can be formed, some de
gree of stability could be
achieved in Italy. Short of a
dictatorship, this may be the
only solution.

an alliance with the Nenni
group, he can act to bring them
into the government. If a gov
ernment of the Christian Demo
crats, the Socialists, the Social
Democrats — a pro - Western
group who split with Nenni at
the time of the Communist al
liance —and the liberal Repub
licans can be formed, some de
gree of stability could be
achieved in Italy. Short of a
dictatorship, this may be the
only solution.
Next to Fiance, Italy has had
the most hectic postwar political
scene, but she has not yet seen
fit to follow hfi' gallic sister in
the abolition of democracy. Italy
has t rierl to solve these problems
within the framework of her
democratic institutions and has
made great progress in rebuild
ing the war-devastated country.
Not since t ho governments of
Aleide de Gasperi ending in 1953
has any measure of unity been
achieved on the national scene.
He was aide at various times to
mould the Communists, Left and
Right Wing Socialists. Liberals,
and Republicans into coalition
governments during the first
eight years following the war.
De Gasperi was followed by
a number of Christian Demo
crats from both the left and
right wings of the party who
were never able to form lasting
cabinets. The most recent of
the line was Antonio Segni
who came into office after the
seven month coalition led by
Amintorc Fanlani, at liberal
( hristian Democrat.
Segni, a conservative in the
party, formed a government with
ihe support of the right-of-center
Liberal Party, the monarchists,
and the neo-Fascists in February
1959. At the convention of the
Christian Democratic Party in
Florence last fall, one-third of
the members lead by former
Prime Minister Fanfani criticized
the government's policy of accept
ing aid from the Fascists.
This was followed by Presi
dent Gronchi's rather humiliating
trip to Russia where his policy of
supporting the Western alliance
was attacked. Gronchi, himself a
liberal Christian Democrat, has
favored a leftward turn in the
government's orientation but has
not yet prevailed on the leaders
of his party.
Segni, in response to criticism,
had made overtures to the Nen
ni Socialists in hopes of bring
ing them into a coalition gov
ernment with a large parlia
mentary majority. Members of
the right wing of the Christian
Democrats and of the Liberal
Party have objected to this,
since the Nenni group has since
1947 been in a Popular Front
with the Communists.
The Nenni supporters com
fortably remained in alliance with
the Italian Communists until the
Hungarian Revolution. They de

| nounced the Russian intervention
and in 1959 revoked their electoral
agreement with the Communists.
The Catholic Church has opposed
any cooperation with them how
lever, and this influence is very
[strongly felt in Italian politics.
In March! the Liberal Party,
| previously supporting the Segni
: government, became wary of its
courting of Nenni aid and with
drew its support. The cabinet's
plurality was only cut from 80 to
1 50 votes, and it could still have
remained in power if ir had been
willing to rely on Fascist sup
port. The liberal Christian Dcrno
j crats would not stand for this,
land Segni was forced to submit
i his resignation to President Gron-
I chi although not defeated on any
vote of confidence.
This plunged Italy into its
worst postwar crisis. Scheduled
elections are not for three
years, and a parliamentary
stalemate has already been
reached. Fernando Tamhroni
was finally persuaded to form
a government, but since none
of tin' political problems had
been resolved, it could not hope
for stability.
Only the Fascists would sup
; port it, and the liberal Christian
I Democrats would not serve in this
' situation. On Monday, this cabinet
resigned, emphasizing the serious
ness of the crisis.
A grave political situation now
faces Italy. No government of the
j center can He formed that has a
j sufficient parliamentary majority
: to remain in power. The liberal
Christian Democrats will not ae
! eept Fascist support ,and the con
servative's seem unwilling to re
ceive any aid from the Nenni
Socialists. President Gronchi has
several alternatives open to him
to relieve the crisis.
1. He can call special parlia
mentary elections in hopes that
this will change the political
scene, but there are no indica
tions that it will.

Socialists. President Gronchi has
several alternatives open to him
to relieve the crisis.
1. He can call special parlia
mentary elections in hopes that
this will change the political
scene, but there are no indica
tions that it will.
2. Since he is known to favor
an alliance with the Nenni
group, he can act to bring them
into the government. If a gov
ernment of the Christian Demo
crats, the Socialists, the Social
Democrats — a pro - Western
group who split with Nenni at
the time of the Communist al
liance —and the liberal Repub
licans can be formed, some de
gree of stability could be
achieved in Italy. Short of a
dictatorship, this may be the
only solution.
Next to Fiance, Italy has had
the most hectic postwar political
scene, but she has not yet seen
fit to follow hfi' gallic sister in
the abolition of democracy. Italy
has t rierl to solve these problems
within the framework of her
democratic institutions and has
made great progress in rebuild
ing the war-devastated country.
Not since t ho governments of
Aleide de Gasperi ending in 1953
has any measure of unity been
achieved on the national scene.
He was aide at various times to
mould the Communists, Left and
Right Wing Socialists. Liberals,
and Republicans into coalition
governments during the first
eight years following the war.
De Gasperi was followed by
a number of Christian Demo
crats from both the left and
right wings of the party who
were never able to form lasting
cabinets. The most recent of
the line was Antonio Segni
who came into office after the
seven month coalition led by
Amintorc Fanlani, at liberal
( hristian Democrat.
Segni, a conservative in the
party, formed a government with
ihe support of the right-of-center
Liberal Party, the monarchists,
and the neo-Fascists in February
1959. At the convention of the
Christian Democratic Party in
Florence last fall, one-third of
the members lead by former
Prime Minister Fanfani criticized
the government's policy of accept
ing aid from the Fascists.
This was followed by Presi
dent Gronchi's rather humiliating
trip to Russia where his policy of
supporting the Western alliance
was attacked. Gronchi, himself a
liberal Christian Democrat, has
favored a leftward turn in the
government's orientation but has
not yet prevailed on the leaders
of his party.
Segni, in response to criticism,
had made overtures to the Nen
ni Socialists in hopes of bring
ing them into a coalition gov
ernment with a large parlia
mentary majority. Members of
the right wing of the Christian
Democrats and of the Liberal
Party have objected to this,
since the Nenni group has since
1947 been in a Popular Front
with the Communists.
The Nenni supporters com
fortably remained in alliance with
the Italian Communists until the
Hungarian Revolution. They de

| nounced the Russian intervention
and in 1959 revoked their electoral
agreement with the Communists.
The Catholic Church has opposed
any cooperation with them how
lever, and this influence is very
[strongly felt in Italian politics.
In March! the Liberal Party,
| previously supporting the Segni
: government, became wary of its
courting of Nenni aid and with
drew its support. The cabinet's
plurality was only cut from 80 to
1 50 votes, and it could still have
remained in power if ir had been
willing to rely on Fascist sup
port. The liberal Christian Dcrno
j crats would not stand for this,
land Segni was forced to submit
i his resignation to President Gron-
I chi although not defeated on any
vote of confidence.
This plunged Italy into its
worst postwar crisis. Scheduled
elections are not for three
years, and a parliamentary
stalemate has already been
reached. Fernando Tamhroni
was finally persuaded to form
a government, but since none
of tin' political problems had
been resolved, it could not hope
for stability.
Only the Fascists would sup
; port it, and the liberal Christian
I Democrats would not serve in this
' situation. On Monday, this cabinet
resigned, emphasizing the serious
ness of the crisis.
A grave political situation now
faces Italy. No government of the
j center can He formed that has a
j sufficient parliamentary majority
: to remain in power. The liberal
Christian Democrats will not ae

servative's seem unwilling to re
