## Government Is Misnomer For Class Organizations

Editor's Note: The author of

the Sophomore ( lass last year.

When used at the class level, I
the term "student government" is
a misnomer; the reasons for the*
self-contradictory nature of the'
phrase are twofold.
First, a student at Stanford
University is not "governed" by
class government, in fact he is i
under no legal obligation to it
whatsoever. The class officers j
have no control of any nature |
over the students which comprise I
the class body politic they issue
no mandates, enforce no regula- j
tions, have no body of law to
execute.
Secondly, it is really not a "stu-1
dent" who governs the class. Once !
a person is elected to a class of-1
fice, or appointed to a class Exe-;
cutive Committee, the very na-1
lure of his duties takes him out ,
of the realm of academics and :
places him in the realm of social j
activity. The class officer, in the
context of hi-s .job, is merely a;
procurer of orchestras, a collector :
of money, and a glorified social
chairman. In the broad sense then, j
class "student government" is j
neither run by students nor does |
it perform any governmental
function.*
There must be, however, some
goal, some end toward which 1
class government strives, or it
would have been abolished long
ago. The novice class officer en
ters his .job with the ideas of
"class spirit," "class unity," and

| the like, and enthusiastically at
tempts to see them realized.
Before long, however, he finds
j that these goals are impossible to
j reacli. Why? Simply because the
! various living groups provide the
necessary group identification.
â–º "Class" spirit of the high-schobl
days becomes the "house" spirit
!of the college era. Because the
living group provides the neces
sary feeling of belonging, the nec
essary unity, there is no need for
such security at the class level.
As the class officer continues
his "reign," he finds, or perhaps
j feels that he has found more con
| crete goals for class government
social functions, service proj
ects, money - raising campaigns,
land the like. But after participat
ing in a few such activities (at
each of which the attendance is
less than expected and about
which the business manager re
ports a loss of funds), he again
becomes doubtful. Are even these
new "goals" really necessary? As
before, he finds that the social
unit in which he lives provides
the necessary social functions,
projects, etc. Class government,
then, has no real goals, either
idealistic or concrete.
If class government is not
really government and boasts no
goals, why does it continue? To
provide an outlet for the organi
zation man? To fill Ihe coffers of
the alumni organizations? Is it
merely a hold-over from Ihe high
school days? Unless I am given
a sound answer (not a rationaliza
tion! to each of these questions, I
must conclude that class govern
ment is useless and passe.
