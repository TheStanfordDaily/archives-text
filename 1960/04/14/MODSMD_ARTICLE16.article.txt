Exceptional
Editor, lli<* Daily:
I have attended three univer
! sities and am well enough ac
quainted with two others to
i realize that the Stanford,students
are indeed exceptional excep
tionally rude, exceptionally spoil
ed, and exceptionally inconsid
| erate. I have never witnessed such
; an obvious lack of interest in the
| intellectual pursuits that are usu
ally associated with academic life.
I have intended to write this
| letter for some time, but have
kept putting it off. The incident
'that finally prompted it- the so
called last straw was the disgust
ing conduct of the majority of
; students at the "flicks" last Sun
day. During the movie, the sound
| became defective, and for almost
i twenty minutes there was nothing
but yelling, completely prevent
ing anyone's getting a partial
i understanding of what was going
on by listening to what he could
hear of the sound track. The
venerable cliche, "might makes,
right," comes to mind.
In Stanford there .are many
i foreign students. 1 hate to think
that their impression of American
j university students might be
formed by their attending Stan
| ford, which is actually atypical.
There are many here who have
| a very high opinion of this school. j
| It has even been alluded to as
I the "Harvard of the West." I can
only visualize these people as
ostriches, putting their head in
:the sands, believeing that what
; they would like to think true ac
; tually is. This, in fact, is not the
case.

Shady Nixon
Editor, the Daily:
During the question and an-j
J swer period which followed Vice
President Nixon's remarks on 1
| campus, he suggested that a man
be judged solely on his past ac- !
tions and record, and not be a par- j
j ticular image our mass media
might foster.
I would suggest that Nixon be !
■ judged by his own criteria and not
; by a "let's forget the past" atti
| ture such as that advocated by
The Stanford Daily's April 11 ed
itorial. While I would agree that
his is a past worth forgetting, we
| cannot afford to overlook the
shady Nixon of '48. '52, '54, and
'56, when evaluating the "New
Nixon" of 1960.
Paul Teicliolz
Editor's Note: The editorial
did not advocate a "let's forget
the past" attitude. It suggested
that the entire past of Mr. Nix
on should be considered, includ
ing the last 8 years, and that
unsubstantiated points should
he ignored while examining his !
record.
A Decision
Editor, the Daily:
I applaud Steve Corker's noble
maneuver of running for class
j president with the purpose of re
signing,, thus abolishing class
j government. Whichever way the
class votes, he has won in that
I he will have stimulated interest
in class government, be it positive
or negative.
But, freshmen, be cautious; do
! not insult the reasoning powers <
| of those who have come before
and have considered class gov- j
: ernment essential. A reform ticket |
! is appealing, but consider both |

•sides of the issue before voting.
One purpose of class government
is to provide social and service
functions, but another is to pro
vide, between the class members
and the ASSU. a means of com
munication. Are you going to in
crease this communication by
having someone' appointed by
ASSU direct your activities, or
would an elected representative
be better.
If an appointed person directed
your functions, you will have no
direct say over what activities
are planned for you. If this is
started, where will it end? If you
elect a representative just to di
rect social activities, what differ
ence does it make whether you
call him class president or social
chairman?
Your class officers have a duty
to you as your elected representa
tives to find out first what you
want and then find the best ways
of accomplishing it. If class gov
ernment has been ineffective, I
propose that it is because your
officers haven't determined your
needs.
Mr. Corker has decided that
what you need is no class gov
ernment, and by running he is
gathering your opinion. What you
must do is determine what you
personally want and then express
your decision at the polls. It will
be interesting.
