Former President II erb or t
Hoover declared here yesterday
that Marxist thinking was
plaguing the country and had
even "got frozen" into the Ei
senhower Administ ration.
He made the comment on the
Administration in an interview
after an address to the annual
meeting of the Eastern Area of
United Presbyterian Men.
In his talk to the men he said
the country was "plagued with
the infection of Karl Marx in
both the thinking of our people
and the affairs of our govern
ments."
Marxist Influence
Later Mr. Hoover, thin-faced
and brisk at So, was asked
whether he meant by this that
Marxist influence existed today
in all forms of American govern
ment.
"Yes, sir," he replied, "Fed
eral, state and local."
It got started long before the
present governments took office,
ho said. Asked it' he thought it
had continued into the Eisen
hower Administration, ho nodded
and said: "It got frozen in."
The former President told the
2,000 Presbyterian men at a
luncheon in the Statler Hilton
Hotel tha.t "the spread of the
Karl Marx virus" was one of the
major crises haunting this coun
try.
"More leaders of the Christian
faiths need to realize the ultimate
end of this infection among us,"
he said.
Real Meaning
"The real meaning and purpose
of socialism is the governmental
operation of all commerce and in
dustry and the reduction of life
to pure materialism.
"This infection creeps through
our nation by deluded and milled
men and by disgusted organiza
tions. fronts and cults. These
agents of infection are like hermit
frabs which crawl into such terms
as 'liberal,' 'progressive,' 'public
electric power,' 'managed econ
omy', 'is the welfare state.' and a
half-dozen others."
Mr. Hoover declared the ex
hibits of Communist countries

had shown that commerce and
industry could not be taken over
by the Government without dicta
torship and the destruction of in
dependent thought, including re
ligion.
"We have in the Communist
nations implacable enemies," he
said, "whose determination de
spite their disguises of peaceful
cooperation is to destroy and
dominate the free world. And
they are succeeding at our very
doorstep."
Another crisis the country is
facing, Mr. Hoover said, is "an
increasing moral slump," witnes
sed by recent exposures of munie
: ipaf corruption and the improper
I operation of some television pro
grams and some home loan, meat
and fuel oil businesses.
Recent statistics show that
law-enforcement machinery has
become "deplorably weakened,"
he commented.
Law-liif'orcement
"S om e th in g is terrifyingly
wrong in our law-enforcement
I system when in 1958 there were
2,340,000 persons arrested for
I major crimes, and only 88.780 of
'them landed in state and Federal
i prisons," he said.
"I known of nothing in Ihe
| teachings of the Scriptures
which advocates the release of
i mad dogs onto the streets. In
fact, I interpret Christ's word*
on 'casting into outer darkness'
to include an effective sentence
| in prison."
