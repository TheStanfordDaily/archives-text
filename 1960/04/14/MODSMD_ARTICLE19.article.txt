An item has been brought to our attention via the newswires
of the Associated Press that must rank as one of the saddest stories
of the year. It is hereby printed in its entirety with a few com
ments interspersed where they suggest themselves.
MILAN, Italy (/Pi Gay-heart
ed plans to stage a striptease
Olympic championship in Milan
during the Rome Olympic games
this year have bumped to a dismal
end.

Three nightclub operators
who sent out tentative bids
to some of the world's most
fetching undressers said sad
ly Sunday night that "friends
persuaded us to give up the
idea."
(With friends like these you fel
lows don't need enemies.)
There was a feeling, so
strong as to be virtually a
certainty, that those "friends"
were top brass in the Italian
police.
These noteworthies were
reported to have let it be
known that, "There'll be no
stripping and teasing here in
Olympic year if ever."
While it lasted, the idea had
promised to lure Olympic vis
itors by thousands from the
track and field events in
Rome.
Giordano Sacchi, owner of
Milan's Trianon cabaret, of
fered to stage the champion
ships in his nightclub. If one

club couldn't hold the crowds,
\ there was talk of splitting the
eliminations into three Olympic
style heats to pack two other
nightclubs.
Maybe Dick Would Help Out
(Good going, Giordano. YVe can see it now. At 1:30 in the
Trianon we hold the first heat in fan dancing, with heats two and
thr<*e following at half-hour intervals. .Meanwhile, in the cabaret
across the street, the heats in Imnip-and-grinding are in progress,
while down the block the bubble dancers and those girls that pop
out of cakes at stag birthday parties compete.
Of course, we'll have to have qualifying times like the rest of
the Olympic events this year. We suggest a committee headed by
Harold Minsky could probably determine times (or is it distances?)
that would be a fair test for each girl's skill.
Maybe Vice President Nixon, who lately has shown a commend
able interest in sporting events such as the Rose Howl and opening
day baseball, would like to be on the committee.)
A Real Internationa] Affair
Sacchi said he and the other or
organizers had already contacted
some potential championship ma
terial: Coccinelle, tlve French fe
male impersonator; Rita Cadil
lac, the strip queen from Greno
ble; Aiche Nana, the Turkish bel
ly dancer whose impromptu show
in a Rome restaurant last year is
still under police inquiry; Lily St.
Cyr, the Paris and Las Vegas
lovely; Cha Landres of Budapest,
and scores of others.
(What? No Beverly Aadland and Tuesday Weld?!)
"All those we contacted were
enthusiastic about the idea,"
Sacchi said disappointedly. "All,
that is, except those friends of
ours."
Well, there it is. Sad, isn't it. Excuse us while we go hang
a wreath on Bimbo's door and mourn for what might have been.



TUESDAY WELD
She didn't make it
