## Britain Scraps Rocket Plans On U.S. Pledge 
### 
LONDON i/Pi Britain scrapped
a bi<j part of its rocket defense
program yesterday. The govern
ment staked the future nuclear
striking power of these islands on
a U.S. pledge to sell it American
rockets. Emphasis was shifted
from fixed to mobile bases.
Defense Minister Harold Wat
kinson announced abandonment
of a l billion dollar project to
build the Blue Streak a 2,.">()()-
mile range rocket with a Rolls
Royce liquid fuel engine which
already has cost 182 million dol
lars. Also abandoned were plans
for a network of launching sites.
British Deterrent
These had been designed as the
chief machinery of an all-British
nuclear deterrent to come into
full effectiveness in the late 19605.
There were calls for the resig
nation of Wat kinson and his pre
decessor as defense minister, Dun
can Sandys, who initiated the
locket program. Sandys is now
aviation minister.
Even a fellow Conservative, F.
YV. Farcy-Jones, declared the de
cision was calamitous. He as
serted British scientific progress
in space research has been pawn
ed to the United States.
Explains to ( ominous
"Vulnerability of miss i 1 e s
launched from static sites and the
practicability of launching mis
siles of considerable range from
mobile platforms have now been
established." Watkinson told the
House of Commons in explaining
the switch.
Another reason was the cost,
which he called prohibitive.
The minister named the Ameri
can Skybolt a U.S. Air Force nu
clear rocket that officials hope
will be available for full-scale test
ing in 18 months as one weapon
that might prolong the effective
life of Britain's strategic bomber
comma nd.
In Washington, the U.S. State
Department said the United
States will sell Skybolts to Bri
tain as soon as they come into
production. The British will turn
out their own nuclear warheads.
Announcement Protested
An uproar of protest and criti
cism met Watkinson's announce
ment.
Opposition Labor and Liberal
lawmakers unleashed their bit
terest attack in years on Prime
Minister Harold Maemillan's Con
servative government. They de
manded a swift and secret probe
into what they termed a waste of
182 million dollars thus far in
vested in developing the Blue
Streak. Watkinson replied that
the rocket might be used as the
launcher for a space satellite.
Maemillan had no immediate
comment on the reaction.
