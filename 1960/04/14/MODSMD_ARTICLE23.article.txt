The kids may not be such a
big problem at Stanford football
games any more.
A chain link fence extending
across the front of end zone fam
ily-plan seats has been installed
to keep the would-be rioters off
the field after games. The fence
is not high enough to interfere
with the average spectator's
vision.
Demand for such a fence has
risen in recent years when storms
of kids have ringed the field near
the end of games. In several
cases, the final play or two of
games found the ballcarrier hav
ing to buck kids as well as oppos
ing tacklers.
