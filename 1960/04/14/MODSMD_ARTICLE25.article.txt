# HERE SATURDAY
## Tribe-UCLA Meet Could Rest on Relay 
### 
A track meet that looks to be
'equally as close as last Saturday's
Stanford-San Jose-Kansas trian
gular is on tap Saturday at 1:30
in Stanford Stadium when UCLA
invades.
Sparked by ex-Stanford sprint
er Chris Knott, the Bruins are
! fresh from narrow victories over
California and measle-ridden Oc
cidental.
Key to Stanford victory hopes
will be domination of the 440. 880
and mile. UCLA has showed little
in the quarter this year, while the
Indians have uncovered a stable
of moderately strong one-lappers.
UCLA has fair power in the
half and mile, but could got shut
out by Stanford's exceptional
strength in these events. Coach
Payton Jordan has revealed that
he will double his top distance
men, but will run them to win
rather than for record times.
UCLA should offset this power
; with domination in the hurdles
and discus, where Stanford will
be lucky to get four points.
