mentary School Administrators
Assn., said:
Hits Critics
"Some of our scientists and ad
mirals have become so involved
iti the development of things that
they have forgotten the impor
tance of human dignity and
worth.
"Their concern is in the mad
race to sec who will be the first
to land on the moon, who will
have the most terrifying inter
continental rocket, who can de
velop the biggest H bomb."
He spoke to the closing session
of the administrators associa
tion's annual meeting.
Defending education which
stresses both subject matter and
social adjustment of the child, he
said:
Promote Way-of-Ijfe
"The schools have been the pri
mary social institution in Amer
ica developed to promote, main
tain and improve the American
way of life."
He also criticized Stanford and
University of California profes
sors who found fault with the
programs of the San Francisco
public schools.
He noted they took exception to
making "education for life in a
democracy" a primary education
al goal.
"In their opinion nothing and
I repeat nothing could be more
profoundly hostile to excellence
in education."
