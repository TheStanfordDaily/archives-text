One of aviation's greatest sci
entific pioneers, the late Stanford
professor William Frederick Du
rand, will be honored by the es
tablishment of a Duranrl Fellow
ship'in Aeronautical Engineering
at Stanford.
Durand, who died in 1958 at the
age of 99, initiated aeronautical
engineering studies here early in
the 1900s. A campus conference
last year commemorating the
100 th anniversary of his birth
was attended by many of the
world's top aviation experts.
The professor originated Ihe
theory of ship propellers, and at
the University evolved the basic
theories of aircraft propeller de
sign which led to the variable
pitch propeller.
Durand himself gave initial
support for the fellowship, pro
viding a legacy of $20,000 to as
sist "worthy Stanford students in
aeronautical engineering."
