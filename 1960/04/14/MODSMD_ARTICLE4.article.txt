Drs. John Jossc and Arthur
Kornberg. Stanford Medical
School researchers, have announc
ed a new analysis technique to
determine the chemical composi
tion of the substance which con
trols heredity in living organisms.
The substance is deoxyribonu
cleic acifl DNA a genetic ma
terial found in the nuclei of'cells.
Learning the hereditary code or
sequences of the chemical ehould
be significant in future under
standing of hereditary diseases.

Josse, who holds a postdoctoral

(if the biochemistry department
and co-winner of the 19/>f) Nobel
Prize in medicine, presented a
paper on their research to the
Federation of Experimental Bi
ology in Chicago yesterday .
Although the researchers could
not study the sequences of the
four genetic materials in DNA.
they did devise a method of study
ing pairs. This showed the fre
quency with which one material
follows another.
Findings < onsistent
Observations of the way chemi
cals were incorporated into DNA
were made through the use of
radioisotopes and br ea kdo w n
catalysts.
The findings were consistent
with previous assumptions about
I the way DNA is formed.
