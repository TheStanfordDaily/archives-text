# Spring at Stanford
## 
### 
A clear spring day on the campus, a cool breeze waiting across
the shining waters of Lake Lagmiita, a trim little sailboat. Hoover
Tower soaring majestically above the bordering trees and two
students with that urge to "get away from it all" for a while
blend together to form this rinusual picture ol springtime at
Stanford.
