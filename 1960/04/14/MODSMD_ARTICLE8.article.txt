# 'EVASIVE TECHNIQUES'
## State Official Scores Area Discriminatory Realtors 
### Anne Cowen 
"By all kinds of evasive techniques, almost all realtors in the
Peninsula area refuse to show homes in all-white areas to members
of colored minority groups," Franklin Williams, California's As
sistant to the Attorney General, told the YYVCA Religious Affairs
Luncheon yesterday.
Housing restriction is the major problem facing colored minori-

ties outside of the South today,
Williams said. He cited discrimi
natory policies in World War II
government housing projects as
one factor preserving patterns of
segregation into recent years.
Williams noted too that until
1950 the National Association of
Real Estate Boards maintained
the position that any realtor
showing property in a white
neighborhood to a non-white was
violating its Code of Ethics.
"In the Peninsula, we can see
the Southern Pacific Railroad
tracks as the dividing line be
tween white and minority hous
ing areas," Williams -said.
Profit-Seeking
Williams cited real estate prof
it-seeking techniques by which
white home owners are urged to
move out of a neighborhood and
members of minority groups en
couraged to move in.
"East Palo Alto is an area of
moderately priced homos which
has deliberately been labeled as a
minority area," he said.
"Realtors vacated the area of
white families and initiated the
minority flood."
Williams condemned discrimi
nation in housing projects on land
leased by Stanford. He reported
that a covenant prohibiting dis
criminatory practices in housing
on this property was recommend
ed by the University administra
tion but was not adopted by the
Board of Trustees.
"The University is hardly in a
position, then, to protest discrimi
nation elsewhere," Williams stat
ed. He indicated that because
Stanford receives tax exemption,
a form of government subsidy,
discrimination on University
leased land may be "a violation
of legal as well as moral obliga
tions."
( ites ( al Policy
Williams cited the University of
California policy of refusing to
approve off-campus student hous
ing in which racial discrimination
is practiced as a commendable
moral stand.
Williams called the sit-in strikes
in the South especially signifi
cant. "A substantial leadership
has now shifted from lawyers and
politicians to the young Negro
and white students, where it be
longs," he said.
The sense of personal involve
ment in such an issue is good in
terms of the participant's per
sonal development, Williams not
ed. He advocated active partici
pation by students interested in
the cause of civil rights.
Write Letters
"You can write letters to the
students directly involved in the
movement in the South. You can
subscribe to the boycotts of local
chain stores, if you think this a
valid method of protest. But all
these things can follow only after
your own Intellectual commit
ment to the idea," Williams sairl.
"No American's education is
complete unless he has walked on
a picket line and been a part of
.1 minority. 1 don't think Stanford
students are as concerned with
these issues as those at larger,
public universities."

nation elsewhere," Williams stat
ed. He indicated that because
Stanford receives tax exemption,
a form of government subsidy,
discrimination on University
leased land may be "a violation
of legal as well as moral obliga
tions."
( ites ( al Policy
Williams cited the University of
California policy of refusing to
approve off-campus student hous
ing in which racial discrimination
is practiced as a commendable
moral stand.
Williams called the sit-in strikes
in the South especially signifi
cant. "A substantial leadership
has now shifted from lawyers and
politicians to the young Negro
and white students, where it be
longs," he said.
The sense of personal involve
ment in such an issue is good in
terms of the participant's per
sonal development, Williams not
ed. He advocated active partici
pation by students interested in
the cause of civil rights.
Write Letters
"You can write letters to the
students directly involved in the
movement in the South. You can
subscribe to the boycotts of local
chain stores, if you think this a
valid method of protest. But all
these things can follow only after
your own Intellectual commit
ment to the idea," Williams sairl.
"No American's education is
complete unless he has walked on
a picket line and been a part of
.1 minority. 1 don't think Stanford
students are as concerned with
these issues as those at larger,
public universities."
"By all kinds of evasive techniques, almost all realtors in the
Peninsula area refuse to show homes in all-white areas to members
of colored minority groups," Franklin Williams, California's As
sistant to the Attorney General, told the YYVCA Religious Affairs
Luncheon yesterday.
Housing restriction is the major problem facing colored minori-

ties outside of the South today,
Williams said. He cited discrimi
natory policies in World War II
government housing projects as
one factor preserving patterns of
segregation into recent years.
Williams noted too that until
1950 the National Association of
Real Estate Boards maintained
the position that any realtor
showing property in a white
neighborhood to a non-white was
violating its Code of Ethics.
"In the Peninsula, we can see
the Southern Pacific Railroad
tracks as the dividing line be
tween white and minority hous
ing areas," Williams -said.
Profit-Seeking
Williams cited real estate prof
it-seeking techniques by which
white home owners are urged to
move out of a neighborhood and
members of minority groups en
couraged to move in.
"East Palo Alto is an area of
moderately priced homos which
has deliberately been labeled as a
minority area," he said.
"Realtors vacated the area of
white families and initiated the
minority flood."
Williams condemned discrimi
nation in housing projects on land
leased by Stanford. He reported
that a covenant prohibiting dis
criminatory practices in housing
on this property was recommend
ed by the University administra
tion but was not adopted by the
Board of Trustees.
"The University is hardly in a
position, then, to protest discrimi
nation elsewhere," Williams stat
ed. He indicated that because
Stanford receives tax exemption,
a form of government subsidy,
discrimination on University
leased land may be "a violation
of legal as well as moral obliga
