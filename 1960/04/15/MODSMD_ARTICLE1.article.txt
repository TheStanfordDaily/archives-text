## 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (/P) The outlawed African Na- j
tional Congress called on Negroes yesterday to boycott work again !
next week in the fight against the government's racial policies. i
Trouble could come from revival of the work boycott, a powerful
economic weapon in this land where 10 million Negroes provide j

most oi ino iaoor ior ine iarms,
factories and homes of three mil
lion whites.
The first phases of the stay-at
home movement, crushed by po
lice raids on African settlements
last week, showed the nation's
vulnerability. Industry slowed.
Meat supplies dwindled. House
work suffered .
