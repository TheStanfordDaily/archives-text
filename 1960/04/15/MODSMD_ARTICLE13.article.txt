This week in Washington the
leading Western Foreign Minis
ters will be holding the first of
three meetings to prepare for
the summit in Paris on May 16.
The second meeting will take
place in Istanbul early in May,
and the third in Paris just before
the summit meeting itself.
As the series of meetings begin,
the controlling fact is that there
is no big issue which all the
Western powers think it is de
sirable to raise. There is nothing
that all of them, indeed any of
them, urgently want to do. At bot
tom they are united in the feel
ing that on the crucial question
which turns on the two Germanys
and the two Berlins—the situa
tion as it is is good enough, and
that the best thing to do would
be to leave it alone.
Adenauer and de Gaulle most
insistently, Macmillian and Ei
senhower acquiescing, believe
that the Western position at the
summit must be to stand [tat on
the status quo, and lo he pre
pared to make tactical moves
to repulse or to diver! any So
viet move lo change the status
quo.
In theory, the Western nations
want more than the status quo.
In theory, they want the re-unifi
cation of the two Germanys. In
theory, they want the liberation
of Eastern Europe. In theory,
they want a reduction of arma
ments. But in fact they have no
hope that any of these goals can
be reached at a price which ihey
are willing to pay.
In fact, Western Europe is
prospering mig h t 1 y although
Germany and Berlin are divided.
In fact, Western Europe is not
afraid of war although ihe Red
Army is on its frontiers. For the
status quo appears to them to he
so secure and is in fact so profit
able that the problem of the sum
mit meeting is how to go there
and how to come away from there
without changing anything and
without losing face.
The unresolved question
about the summit is whether
the Soviet Union is so dissatis
fied with the status quo that it
will run any serious risk in
order to change it. Nobody
knows. We can only guess. The
worst that Mr. K. has threat
ened us with is that he will
sign a separate i>eace treaty
with the East German state,
will leave it to the East Ger
mans to argue it out with us
about our access to West Berlin,
and will stand ready to support
the East Germans if they pro
voke us into using military
force.

The Soviet threat is now in
definite and rather ambiguous. II

it not a very terrifying threat he
cause the risk, if the worst came
to worst, is fully as great for
the Soviet Union as for the Unit
ed States and its allies. M' 1 . K.
must know by this time that
while we cannot stop him from
signing a treaty with East Ger
many, signing that treaty would
not change the status quo. West
ern access to West Berlin can
not be blocked. At most it can
ho harrassed.
Apart from the special problem
of Berlin, there is an underlying
agreement with the Soviet Union.
This agreement can never be ad
mitted and formalized in a treaty.
The agreement is that the status
quo with the two Germanys is
tolerable. It is not the best that
either side wants. But it is not
Hie worst that either side fears.
If this is a correct estimate of
the situation, it follows that the
problem of the summit will he a
little like the problem at the
Republican convention in July.
It is to find something interest
ing and useful to talk about.
"Disarmament" is the obvious
subject to talk. For it is an inex
haustible subject for diplomats
who have to talk —because talk
ing helps to keep the peace. It
is a subject about which no one
expects serious and far-reach
ing .agreement. I)r. Adenauer,
for example, who wants to do
nothing about the central issue
in Europe, wants to talk about
disarmament.
This is not a cynical view of the
summit meeting. If it sounds
cynical, that is because the West
ern powers want to be united and
therefore have to be unanimous;
they are going to the summit not
to make things better but to pre
vent them from becoming worse.
They are preparing, therefore,
the tactics of a defensive cam
paign no retreat but also no ad
vance and they will be well
satisfied if the net result is no
body's gain and nobody's loss.
The best that can be said of
this defensive position is that it
can probably be held for some
little time to come. The worst
that can be said of it is that it
cannot be held indefinitely and
that it is not a policy with which
to look forward to the future.
For there is not the slightest rea
son to thing that in a place like
West Berlin or in the morbid rela
tionship of the two Germanys,
time is on the side of the West.
