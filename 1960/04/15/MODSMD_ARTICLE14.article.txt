# LOOKING AROUND
## The 						Muffed Chance 
### Ron Rapoport Associate Editor 
The words that have been used
to describe Frank Sinatra
throughout the years are as
varied as the talents of the man.
They have ranged from the undy
ing adoration of Ihe teen-age set
of 15 years ago, through a more
mature appreciation of his sing
ing and acting ability, to an ac
cute disgust at some of the
aspects of his private life.
However, the label of disap
pointing is one that has seldom
been applied to him, and that is
the one that must he used about
Sinatra's latest appearance in
the nation's headlines.
Sinatra, who has lately turned
to producing motion pictures, has
owner! the rights to a book called
"The Execution of Private Slovik"
for some time. It concerns the
only American soldier executed
for desertion during World War
11. If it ever gets made, it is to
star Steve McQueen of television's
"Bounty Hunter" fame.
On March 21 Sinatra hired Al
bert Maltz to write the screen
play. Malt/, is one of the group of
10 Hollywood writers who served
a term in jail for refusing to an
swer a Senate subcommittee's
questions on communist affilia
tions in 1047. Sinatra and Malt/
were immediately attacked by the
usual organizations.
The director of the California
Amvets called for a boycott of the
movie. The American Legion
rushed to the scene calling for all
patriotic Americans to drown Si
natra with mail protesting Maltz's
hiring. The Hearst press launched
an attack in its news and editorial
columns that made those ac
quainted with objective importing
shake with rage.

Sinatra remained adamant,
however, and came out with a
strongly worded statement: "As
producer of the film, I and I alone
will be responsible for it. I am
prepared to stand on my princi
ples and to await the verdict of
the American people when they
see "The Execution of Private
Slovik." ... In my role as a pic
ture maker, I have, in my opinion,
hired the host man to do the job."
On April 8 Sinatra fired Maltz.
He said. ". . . the American pub
lic has indicated that it feels the
morality of hiring Albert Malt/
is the more crucial matter and I
will accopt this majority opinion."
Sinatra's action is disappoint
ing and it is interesting to specu
late just what forces w ere
brought to bear in changing his
mind from"I and I alone am
responsible" to "I will accept the
majority opinion."
That Malt/ has written for the
movies since 1917 seems almost
a certainty. It is an accepted Hol
lywood practice for blacklisted
writers to write under assumed
names. Lately such names as Otto
Preminger, Stanley Kramer and
Kirk Douglas have allowed such
writers to work for them and
use their own names.
The super-patriots that protest
violently when these writers work
out in the open, don't seem to
mind if they write under cover
using assumed names. Their point
seems to bo that it's all right for
these writers to "corrupt" the
American public as long as the
public doesn't know about it. They
don't mind if blacklisted writers
work; they only mind that people
know about it.
Sinatra had a chance to make
a significant contribution to Hol
lywood's self-respect. He muffed
it and we're disappointed.
