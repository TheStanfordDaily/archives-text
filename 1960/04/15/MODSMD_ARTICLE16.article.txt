Class Government
Editor, Ihe Daily:
In light of the recent contro
| versy concerning the benefit of
i class government, we. the Sopho-
I more Class Executive Committee,
j drawing from our experiences,
i feel that we should express our
| views.
We realize that, at present, divi
| sion of interests at Stanford be
! tween living groups, interest
i groups, and the University itself,
I leaves little room for so-called
! "city unity" until, perhaps, the
senior year and after graduation.
During the year we have acted
| as a social co-ordinating group to
1 play two major, and very success
fid, class functions, but our job
did not end there. We have com
municated with class govern
ments of other colleges and uni
versities as representatives of the
Class of 19G2. We have stood
ready to aid class members in ex
pressing their opinions, in prob
] lems connected with relationships
I between class members, other
classes, and others schools, etc.
Our elected business manager
has as his major duty the com
[ plete responsibility for class
funds; we feel that an appointed
individual or one who has a
larger responsibility, as the ASSU
Financial Manager, could not ful
fill this job as adequately as a
class Business Manager.
Call it what you will, we feel
that a class organization one
which can function above the
limited scope of a social co-ordi
nating board is necessary.

The resignation of Steve Corker

A New Role
Editor, the Daily:
j The debate has raged for two
days now on what the proper
function of class government is.
Perhaps it's time to ask the «ime
! question about the ASSU itself.
Now let's be honest about this;
: student government at Stanford
; doesnt' have a practical necessity
1 ... it doesn't perform a single
| prestige function which couldn't
! bo handled as easily by the Ad-
I ministration. The real value of
I student government i-s its educa
! tional value . . . it's a means for
i augmenting the education re

ceived over our noses in textbooks |
and lectures.
Perhaps what is wrong is Ihnt
we've never admitted this and
thus have never asked ourselves i
what kind of education device it
is or how it could be improved.
We've never seen, for example, 1
the enormous role that student
government could play in prompt
ing thought and discussion on ;
serious issues if only it didn't feel ;
hound to practical duties (such
as opening Lake Lag) which just
are not that important. We've
never seen that the centralization
of power in student government
could he best used not to sell bi
cycle lights but to prompt the
student's most valuable activities
thinking, discussing, and mak- j
ing up one's mind on important j
issues.
This is not to say that student i
government should itself takej
stands on vital issues; this would
hardly be fair to the large minor-1
ity whose opinions were not ex- i
pressed. What should be the func- !
tion of student government is to ;
carry discussion and decision is
sues to the student body itself, to
encourage individuals to concern
themselves with the questions
they will one day have to deal i
with directly. This is a new role
for -student government at Stan
ford and one much more valuable
than that of super-executive for
incidental details.

Innuendo in Reverse
Editor, the Daily:
Critics of Richard Nixon have
contended, quite rightly 1 think,
that he and/or his supporters
have used the "communist in
nuendo" in the past in order to
further Nixon's political fortunes.
But the attempt by Barnes Riz
nik (letter to The Daily, April
13) to see Nixon's recent stand
on the issue of birth control as
an insidious means of exploiting
religious differences, of influenc
ing the West Virginia primary,
and of leading a "Holy War" is an
innuendo in reverse and even less
creditable.
If Nixon were to re-open this
issue only at the height of the
presidential election, perhaps the
charge would have some validity.
But to suggest that the April {)
announcement was a "calculated
tin\ing" to "stop Kennedy" in
West Virginia and to launch a
religious war is at most, question
able.
Last December Senator Stu
Symington of Missouri, a Demo
cratic opponent of Kennedy, de
clared himself in favor of distri
buting information on birth con
trol. This view, Symington has
espoused consistently and fre
quently. Would Mr. Riznik also
find Symington guilty of exploit
ing religious differences for polit
ical gains?

Innuendo in Reverse
Editor, the Daily:
Critics of Richard Nixon have
contended, quite rightly 1 think,
that he and/or his supporters
have used the "communist in
nuendo" in the past in order to
further Nixon's political fortunes.
But the attempt by Barnes Riz
nik (letter to The Daily, April
13) to see Nixon's recent stand
on the issue of birth control as
an insidious means of exploiting
religious differences, of influenc
ing the West Virginia primary,
and of leading a "Holy War" is an
innuendo in reverse and even less
creditable.
If Nixon were to re-open this
issue only at the height of the
presidential election, perhaps the
charge would have some validity.
But to suggest that the April {)
announcement was a "calculated
tin\ing" to "stop Kennedy" in
West Virginia and to launch a
religious war is at most, question
able.
Last December Senator Stu
Symington of Missouri, a Demo
cratic opponent of Kennedy, de
clared himself in favor of distri
buting information on birth con
trol. This view, Symington has
espoused consistently and fre
quently. Would Mr. Riznik also
find Symington guilty of exploit
ing religious differences for polit
ical gains?

Innuendo in Reverse
Editor, the Daily:
Critics of Richard Nixon have
contended, quite rightly 1 think,
that he and/or his supporters
have used the "communist in
nuendo" in the past in order to
further Nixon's political fortunes.
But the attempt by Barnes Riz
nik (letter to The Daily, April
13) to see Nixon's recent stand
on the issue of birth control as
an insidious means of exploiting
religious differences, of influenc
ing the West Virginia primary,
and of leading a "Holy War" is an
innuendo in reverse and even less
creditable.
If Nixon were to re-open this
issue only at the height of the
presidential election, perhaps the
charge would have some validity.
But to suggest that the April {)
announcement was a "calculated
tin\ing" to "stop Kennedy" in
West Virginia and to launch a
religious war is at most, question
able.
Last December Senator Stu
Symington of Missouri, a Demo
cratic opponent of Kennedy, de
clared himself in favor of distri
buting information on birth con
trol. This view, Symington has
espoused consistently and fre
quently. Would Mr. Riznik also
find Symington guilty of exploit
ing religious differences for polit
ical gains?

| prestige function which couldn't
! bo handled as easily by the Ad-
I ministration. The real value of
I student government i-s its educa
! tional value . . . it's a means for
i augmenting the education re

ceived over our noses in textbooks |
and lectures.
Perhaps what is wrong is Ihnt
we've never admitted this and
thus have never asked ourselves i
what kind of education device it
is or how it could be improved.
We've never seen, for example, 1
the enormous role that student
government could play in prompt
ing thought and discussion on ;
serious issues if only it didn't feel ;
hound to practical duties (such
as opening Lake Lag) which just
are not that important. We've
never seen that the centralization
of power in student government
could he best used not to sell bi
cycle lights but to prompt the
student's most valuable activities
thinking, discussing, and mak- j
ing up one's mind on important j
issues.
This is not to say that student i
government should itself takej
stands on vital issues; this would
hardly be fair to the large minor-1
ity whose opinions were not ex- i
pressed. What should be the func- !
tion of student government is to ;
carry discussion and decision is
sues to the student body itself, to
encourage individuals to concern
themselves with the questions
they will one day have to deal i
with directly. This is a new role
for -student government at Stan
ford and one much more valuable
than that of super-executive for
incidental details.

Innuendo in Reverse
Editor, the Daily:
Critics of Richard Nixon have
contended, quite rightly 1 think,
that he and/or his supporters
have used the "communist in
nuendo" in the past in order to
further Nixon's political fortunes.
But the attempt by Barnes Riz
nik (letter to The Daily, April
13) to see Nixon's recent stand
on the issue of birth control as
an insidious means of exploiting
religious differences, of influenc
ing the West Virginia primary,
and of leading a "Holy War" is an
innuendo in reverse and even less
creditable.
If Nixon were to re-open this
issue only at the height of the
presidential election, perhaps the
charge would have some validity.
But to suggest that the April {)
announcement was a "calculated
tin\ing" to "stop Kennedy" in
West Virginia and to launch a
religious war is at most, question
able.
Last December Senator Stu
Symington of Missouri, a Demo
cratic opponent of Kennedy, de
clared himself in favor of distri
buting information on birth con
trol. This view, Symington has
espoused consistently and fre
quently. Would Mr. Riznik also
find Symington guilty of exploit
ing religious differences for polit
ical gains?
