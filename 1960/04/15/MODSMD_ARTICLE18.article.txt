# SEVEN ARTS
## Television's Greatest 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
San Francisco, a city that's us
ually pretty aware of what's go
ing on in I he world and elsewhere,
is now in the act of missing one
of the television industry's great
est triumphs.
In October of 1959, WNTA-TV,
channel 13 in New York City, pre
sented a two-hour production of
"Medea," a Robinson Jeffers
translation of the Euripides
drama.
The play ran every night for a
full week at the same time and
received rave reviews.
The station, ail independent,
wanted to do a series of classics,
in their original, unmutilated
form. Their intent was to reach
the audience dissatisfied with the
quiz show, wild west form of tele
vision.
The level of the production was
not to be compromised, but the
station had to carry out the plan
with a minimum of expense. They
decided to approach the artists
who would appear and ask them
to contribute to the production by
working for the minimum scale.
Judith Anderson was asked to
head the "Medea" cast, which she
did for $()()() for three to four
weeks of rehearsals. She usually
gets $2000 a week.
Medea is her favorite role, and
the story goes that when she was
at lunch with the play's producer,
she became so excited about doing
it that she swept all the water
glasses off the table.
"Medea," with Aline MacMahon
playing' the nurse and Jose Quin
tero directing, was the pioneer of
the series called "The Play of the
Week," which has done a major
production each week since then.
Its executive producer is David
Susskind and its producer Lewis
Freedman. Ely Landau of New
York's channel 13 had the idea in
the first place.
The play was a tremendous
success: the responses of the crit
ics and the viewers were equally
enthusiastic. But after 13 weeks
of production, the station sud
denly found it could no longer
carry the show.
Since they had commercials
only lx'tween acts, the play was a
financial failure, and its produc
ers announced that they were
ending the series.

Whereupon Jack Gould, the
New York Times television critic,
made a personal appeal to his
readers to write to the station
and ask them to keep the series
going. In three days, they re
ceived over 30,000 pieces of mail.
And a saviour in the form of
Standard Oil of New Jersey, who
offered to subsidize the show for
13 weeks with an option to renew.
They also promised (hallelujah)
no interference in artistic deci
sions and no indiscriminate show
manship. This meant that the
producers had full autonomy as
to choice of script and production.
Thus far they have done An
ouilh's "Waltz of the Toreadors,"
Strind berg's "Miss Julie" and
"The Stranger," Turgenev's "A
Month in the Country," a Girau
doux, a Chekhov, a Sholem Alei
cheni, an O'Casey, a Graham
Greene, and a Steinbeck.
' Most of the plays have been by
European authors, but they have
on tap a Dorothy Parker, an El
mer Rice and a Moss Hart.
All of the productions have
been done in ihe East, but the
tapes of the shows have since
reached Washington, Philadel
phia, Boston and Los Angeles and
are being shown in sequence from
the beginning of the series.
The fact that no San Francisco
station lias picked up this oppor
tunity makes a rather large dent
in the supposedly high level of
this city's cultural standards. It
is sure that this kind of a show,
with no commercials interrupting
it every ten minutes, with no
"popular" appeal, may not attract
the hordes who will go out and
buy fuzzy wuzzy soap.
But there are a number of
people who think the chance may
be worth the sacrifice.
If the level of "Medea" is any
indication of what viewers would
be seeing (and it is) there is no
doubt about its value to the com
munity. And this city will retain
at least one provincial aspect un
til "The Play of the Week" makes
it onto some SF-TV.
