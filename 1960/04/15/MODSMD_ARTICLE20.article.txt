# Thinclads Host UCLA
## Jordan Predicts Real Close Meet 
### 
Si an ford's track team will host
unbeaten UCLA tomorrow in the
Stadium in what promises to he
a mighty close meet. Starting
1 ime is 1:30.
Indian coach Pay ton Jordan
has termed several events "criti
cal" in tin 4 Stanford victory plan
and strong performances are go
ing to have to come from virtu
ally the whole team if the Tribe
is to win this one. UCLA has al
ready beaten Occidental and Cali
fornia this year, both being teams
which Stanford lost to last sea-
Jordan pins a large part of his
hopes on the distance events.
Sweeps in the -140, 880 and the
mile are hoped for and are neces
sary for a Stanford win.
Co-captain Ernie Cunliffe will
again be doubling in the mile and
the half mile as will Norm Lloyd
and Bertil Lundh. Cunliffe should
win both events as he has top
times of 1:02.3 in the mile and
1:47.3 in the 880. Lundh ran his
best mile last week against Kan
sas and San Jose, finishing the
four-lapper in 1:10.9. Lloyd has
a top 880 time of 1:49.2.
The Bruins have some good ma
terial in the long ones too, how
ever. Bob Holland, Uclan co-cap
tain, has posted a 1:11.7 mark this
year and Milford Dahl has a sea
son's best of 4:15.3.
Dahl has also gone 1:54.6 in the
half-mile and Holland is at 1:53.7.
Bob Jordan turned in a 1:54.8
time for the Bruins against Cal
last week. Thus, there is no as
surance that the Tribe will pick
up the sweeps it seeks in these
events.
In the 140 Stanford will go with
Bob Besse, Dick Lassen and Rich
Klier. Besse and Lassen both ran
48.9 last week while Klier ran a
49.2 relay leg. For the Bruins Boh
Scheller at 19.3. Steve Scott, with
a season's best of 50.0, and Na
galingam Pararajasingam, from
Ceylon, with a top mark of 50.4.
Again, the sweep is anything but
certain.
The two-mile is another "criti
cal" event. Dahl ran the 8 laps in
9:16.9 for the Bruins against Cal
last week and if he comes any
where near that time tomorrow he
will win. Stanford is pinning its
hopes on John Northway who has

a season's best of 9:19.9. North
way will have to beat Pete Rodri
guez who had a best of 9:42.4 and
Ken Riding a 9:2N.0.
A meet record should fall in the
discus as Bruin Gerald Carr, the
English record holder who has
been out to 176-3, should beat Ra
ter Johnson's mark of 170-9 Ts.
Rafer's brother Jim will be in
evidence tomorrow as he goes in
the high hurdles and the 220.
Johnson has been running behind
ex-Indian Chris Knott in the 220
this year as Knott has a 21.2
mark for that race and a 9.6 time

for the 100.
Stanford shot-put tor Jerry Win
ters figures to win his event as
he has been out near f)7 feet this
year while the Bruins top putter,
Clark Branson, has a top heave
of 53-7 :i 4.
The mile relay, which could de
cide the whole meet, will pit two
good teams. UCLA's relay squad
of Jord a n, Pararajasingham,
Seheller and A 1 Meyers, which
turned in a 3:17.9 mark against
the Bears, will go a team of Las
sen, Klier, Lloyd and Besse, which
ran 3:13.0 last week.

9:16.9 for the Bruins against Cal
last week and if he comes any
where near that time tomorrow he
will win. Stanford is pinning its
hopes on John Northway who has

a season's best of 9:19.9. North
way will have to beat Pete Rodri
guez who had a best of 9:42.4 and
Ken Riding a 9:2N.0.
A meet record should fall in the
discus as Bruin Gerald Carr, the
English record holder who has
been out to 176-3, should beat Ra
ter Johnson's mark of 170-9 Ts.
Rafer's brother Jim will be in
evidence tomorrow as he goes in
the high hurdles and the 220.
Johnson has been running behind
ex-Indian Chris Knott in the 220
this year as Knott has a 21.2
mark for that race and a 9.6 time

for the 100.
Stanford shot-put tor Jerry Win
ters figures to win his event as
he has been out near f)7 feet this
year while the Bruins top putter,
Clark Branson, has a top heave
of 53-7 :i 4.
The mile relay, which could de
cide the whole meet, will pit two
good teams. UCLA's relay squad
of Jord a n, Pararajasingham,
Seheller and A 1 Meyers, which
turned in a 3:17.9 mark against
the Bears, will go a team of Las
sen, Klier, Lloyd and Besse, which
ran 3:13.0 last week.

mile are hoped for and are neces
sary for a Stanford win.
Co-captain Ernie Cunliffe will
again be doubling in the mile and
the half mile as will Norm Lloyd
and Bertil Lundh. Cunliffe should
win both events as he has top
times of 1:02.3 in the mile and
1:47.3 in the 880. Lundh ran his
best mile last week against Kan
sas and San Jose, finishing the
four-lapper in 1:10.9. Lloyd has
a top 880 time of 1:49.2.
The Bruins have some good ma
terial in the long ones too, how
ever. Bob Holland, Uclan co-cap
tain, has posted a 1:11.7 mark this
year and Milford Dahl has a sea
son's best of 4:15.3.
Dahl has also gone 1:54.6 in the
half-mile and Holland is at 1:53.7.
Bob Jordan turned in a 1:54.8
time for the Bruins against Cal
last week. Thus, there is no as
surance that the Tribe will pick
up the sweeps it seeks in these
events.
In the 140 Stanford will go with
Bob Besse, Dick Lassen and Rich
Klier. Besse and Lassen both ran
48.9 last week while Klier ran a
49.2 relay leg. For the Bruins Boh
Scheller at 19.3. Steve Scott, with
a season's best of 50.0, and Na
galingam Pararajasingam, from
Ceylon, with a top mark of 50.4.
Again, the sweep is anything but
certain.
The two-mile is another "criti
cal" event. Dahl ran the 8 laps in
9:16.9 for the Bruins against Cal
last week and if he comes any
where near that time tomorrow he
will win. Stanford is pinning its
hopes on John Northway who has

a season's best of 9:19.9. North
way will have to beat Pete Rodri
guez who had a best of 9:42.4 and
Ken Riding a 9:2N.0.
A meet record should fall in the
discus as Bruin Gerald Carr, the
English record holder who has
been out to 176-3, should beat Ra
ter Johnson's mark of 170-9 Ts.
Rafer's brother Jim will be in
evidence tomorrow as he goes in
the high hurdles and the 220.
Johnson has been running behind
ex-Indian Chris Knott in the 220
this year as Knott has a 21.2
mark for that race and a 9.6 time

for the 100.
Stanford shot-put tor Jerry Win
ters figures to win his event as
he has been out near f)7 feet this
year while the Bruins top putter,
Clark Branson, has a top heave
of 53-7 :i 4.
The mile relay, which could de
cide the whole meet, will pit two
good teams. UCLA's relay squad
of Jord a n, Pararajasingham,
Seheller and A 1 Meyers, which
turned in a 3:17.9 mark against
the Bears, will go a team of Las
sen, Klier, Lloyd and Besse, which
ran 3:13.0 last week.
