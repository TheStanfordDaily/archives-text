# LOOKING FOR REVENGE
## SU Diamondmen Play Long Beach Daily Sports 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseballers,
who arc finally showing signs of
breaking out of a season-long bat
ting slump, run up against the
surprisingly ■ tough Long Beach
State Forty-Niners this afternoon
at 3:15 on the Sunken Diamond.
The two teams go at it again to
morrow, also at 3:15.
The Indians whalloped 13 hits
last Tuesday against the Forty-
Niners but left 12 men on base
and lost 8-5.
After shifting his lineup around
from game to game for the last
two weeks, Coach Dutch Fehring
seems to have found his best
combination. This same group
that chased two Long Beach pitch
ers Tuesday will for the Cards
today.
Lee Moench, who has been as
regular as any of the Cards this
season will open at first base.
Moench, a junior, hit a hefty .3(58
last year playing behind Joel
Newkirk but has yet to catch fire
this year.
Magee at $econd
Mike Magee, w ho has been mov
ing back and forth from catching
to second base will have to be
content with the key-stone spot
for now. Magee, who perfers
catching, has been hitting the ball
at a .500 clip in his last five
games.
Mike Filice again gets the call
at shortstop after his three-hit
performance Tuesday. The 5-10
junior has good'range at short
and an adequate arm.
Jim Bulk, who set a hot pace
for CIBA hitters to match early
in the season, will be in his usual
spot at third. Bulk has tailed off
lately, but his long ball hitting
makes him a threat every time he
steps up to the plate.
Overmann (»<>ts Chance
Sophomore Bob Overmann, who
broke into the starting lineup
earlier this week, gets another
chance behind the plate. Having
been relegated to pinch hit duty,

Overmann has not had an op
portunity to prove himself so far.
The outfield will consist of John
Hurlbut in left, Hal Schutzmann
in center and Skip Lawrence in
right. Hurlbut, an ex-pitcher, is
one of the club's top power hit
ters and blasted a triple Tuesday
for the Indians only extra-base
hit.
Lawrence is as versatile as any
member of the Card team, for he
has played three positions so far
this year. Starting as a second
baseman, he was moved to short
stop, and recently to the outfield.
None of this has affected his hit
ting, and Skip has been one of
the most consistent batsman on
the club.
Junior left-hander Terry Linde
man gets the call against the
Forty -Miners this afternoon.
Lindeman hurled the Cards to
their only league win of the sea
son last weekend over Santa
Clara. He also beat the Cal Ag
gies in a non-league fray recently.
Tomorrow Fehring will call on
either Marv Mecklenberg or Jim
Smith. Both boys have shown
flashes of brilliance this season.
