# Frosh Netters Favored Over Circus Club
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman net squad
takes to the road this weekend as
they travel all the way across the
great wide San Francisquito to
tackle the Menlo Circus Club at
10 o'clock Saturday morning.
The Papooses, playing their
first road match, will he out to
rake in their third win of the sea
son. They already hold decisions
over Stockton College and Burlin
game High School and were edged
by the powerful Menlo College
squad.
Leading the way for Stanford
is Bill Burley, presently holding
down the number one spot on the
frosh team.
In six matches to date, includ
ing action in the Northern Cali
fornia Collegiate Tennis Cham
pionships in February, Burley has
lost only to Chris Crawford,
flashy Menlo Oak star, and is re
garded as a toÂ£ prospect for next
year's varsity team.
John Minna, Pete Snook, a new
found star, Jack Thomas, Mun
Chin and fast - improving VVes
Petit are expected to round out
the frosh traveling squad.
The Circus Club is lead by ex-
Indian ace Tom Cornish, but lacks
many experienced players and
doesn't figure to give the Pa
pooses much trouble.
