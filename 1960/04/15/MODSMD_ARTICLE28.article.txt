# Mauch New Phillies Pilot
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (/P) - Eddie
Sawyer, unruffled and smiling,
resigned yesterday as manager of
I he National League's Philadel
phia Phillies with the simple ex
planation he didn't want the job.
A "shocked" Bob Carpenter,
owner â€¢ president, and a "sorry"
John Quinn. general manager
promptly announced that Gene
Mauch, now managing Minneapo
lis in the American Association
would succeed Sawyer.
Never before in major league
history has any manager either
quit or been fired so early in the
regular season. The Phils played
once, and lost, at Cincinnati. They
open the homo stand last night
ii Connie Mack Stadium against
Milwaukee.
Sawyer's resignation it was

the second lime he's quit as Phil's
manager during a season and
the naming of the 31-year-old
Mauch was disclosed at a basilly
called news conference.
Sawyer's quitting, a surprise
because it came so early, wasn't
entirely unexpected. Many felt
Carpenter wouldn't have waited
too long to replace him.
