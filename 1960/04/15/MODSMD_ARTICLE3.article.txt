## Legislature Discusses Free Love 
### Doug Willis 
Stanford's student Legislature
voted last night to prepare an
opinion on the controversial Pro
fessor Leo Koch "free love" issue
and to act on it next week.
Legislature members agreed by
an 11-7 vote to take the issue to
their constituents and to be pre
pared by next Tuesday night to
vote on an official stand.
"This doesn't mean that we
have to take a side," said Engi
neering School Representative
Dave Leeson.
Legislature members discussed
whether the University of Illinois
professor's dismissal was a viola
tion of academic freedom or
whether he was outside the
bounds of that freedom.
Wilbur Representative Scotty
Thompson explained that Koch's
academic tenure was revoked be
cause of "moral turpitude" and
that he spoke irresponsibly.
NSA Considered
Legislature considered again
this week the prospect of rejoin
ing the National Student Associa
tion but a motion to affiliate
was tabled until next week in
order to learn student opinions.
Legislature members felt that
they shouldn't measure NSA on
"What can it do for us," but that
it gives Stanford a voice in a rep
resentative student organization.
ASSU Assistant Business Man
ager Ed Cutter estimated that it
would cost Stanford approximate
ly $1,500 annually to he an active
participant. Most Legislature
members appeared to think that
NSA would give Stanford stu
dents an important means for ef
fectively expressing their views
on national and international af
fairs.
Opposition
Cutter, opposing NSA member
ship. pointed out that Stanford
has joined and then disaffiliated
from NSA twice before.
Legislature also passed a reso
lution on the Southern Negro "sit
in" movement directing the Polit
ical Union to present within the
next two weeks an open forum
type program including talks,
Daily articles, discussion groups
and so forth to bring the issues of
the movement before the student
body.
In other business Legislature
approved the second reading of
the Associated Women Students
constitution and sent the Lagu
nita constitution to by-laws com
mittee for study.
Blotter and Scratch Sheet
Jerry Bishop and Sam Barclay
were approved as co-editors of the
Blotter for 1.960-61 and Arvin
Brown and Larry Pryor were ap
proved as Scratch Sheet co-edi
tors.
Legislature also voted to re
verse an Elections Commission
interpretation of the ASSU Con
stitution by-laws that disqualified
Sasha Lanz as a candidate for
President of the Class of 1961 and
Thomas Glenn as a candidate for
President of the Class of 1962.
