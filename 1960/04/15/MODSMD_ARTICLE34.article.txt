# BB Can't Make It
## 
### 
About the only things that will
bo missing from the French Fire
side tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m.
at the"I" Center will be the
Eiffel Tower and Brigitte Bardot.
BB decided not to attend when
she discovered that "Love Is My
Profession" didn't go over too
well at the flicks last Sunday.
There will be sidewalk coffee,
movies, folk music and dance,
however, and everyone is invited.
