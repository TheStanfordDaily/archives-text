## 
### 
SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND,
Calif. (A 3 ) The Navy yesterday
fired a Polaris from an under
water launch tube in a test offi
cers said brought the submarine
missile closer to combat readi
ness.
It was the first time a Polaris
had been fired successfully in an
underwater launch. An attempt
to do this last March 27 failed be
cause of malfunction of external
equipment.
The 28-foot-long bottle-shaped
missile popped up above the ocean
surface at 2:21 p.m. after a delay
of more than three hours in the
countdown.
Its solid fuel first-stage engine
burned for five seconds as
planned, driving the missile to a
height of 1,800 feet. After a flight
of 19 seconds the yellow bird then
fell back into the ocean and dis
integrated on impact some 500
feet away.
Navy officers said the test dem
onstrated the ability of Polaris to
accomplish the transition from
underwater launch to powered
flight. They said it was a great
forward step in the development
of the missile scheduled for op
erational service aboard nuclear
powered submarines later this
s'ear.
F rank Wh i t e, underwater
launch project director, said the
success of the shot brought closer
the day when a live Polaris mis
sile could be fired from a subma
rine. Latest live firings of Ihe
missile have been from surface
ships.
