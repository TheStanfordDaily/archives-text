# King Richard II Battles Bolingbroke Next Weekend
## 
### Sherry Welch 
"As close an approximation of
authentic Shakespearean produc
tion as possible" is the goal of the
Stanford Players in next week's
production of Shakespeare's lyric
tragedy Richard 11.
Next Thursday, Friday and
Saturday nights, the headstrong,
unstable, and yet poetic king and
the powerful nobleman Boling
broke will contend for power on
a raked stage built out over the
orchestra which Director .lames
Kerans feels will lend an "overtly
theatrical quality" to the produc
tion.
Psychological Tragedy
The play is essentially a trag
edy of character, an unfolding of
psychological and poetic patterns.
The character of Richard, played
by Eugene Peyroux, is seen in
action as the arrogant king, who
at Barkloughly Castle confidently
asserts that "not all the water in
the rough rude sea can wash the
balm from an anointed king." de
velops into a completely defeated
monarch who realizes that he has
scarcely a follower left.
And the development of Boling
broke, played by Fred Levi, is
seen and the circular pattern that
engulfs him. First the upright
avenger, he is gradually drawn
into the repetition of the crime of
which he has accused .Richard.
It is the action of these charac
ters and their battle for the crown
around which all aspects of the

production are centered.
As the scenery reflects the con
trast between the lavishness of
Richard's Court and the sombre
ness of Bolingbroke's through the
gradual stripping of the throne
room's elegant trappings as the
play progresses.
Dance Added
A form of the ancient dance
"the measure" has been added to
the last scene of the first act to
convey the richness of the last
stages of luxury of Richard's
Court, Lutanist Peter Danner
will accompany the dancers from
on stage.
The lavish costumes, detailedly
authentic and appropriate to the
characters, could well express the
meaning of the play by them
selves. Music has been written by
Leland Smith of the Music De
partment especially for the pro
duction.
Only Minor <'utting
An amazingly small amount of
cutting has been done to the play,
and none of the original scenes
are to be omiltcd.
in celebration of Shakespeare's
39(ith birthday next Saturday, a
special performance in addition
to those in the evening will be
given at 1:30 p.m. for high school
and junior high school students
and teachers.
Tickets, priced at $1.75 and
$1.25 are on sale at the Memorial
Theatre box office weekday after
nouns between 12:30 and 1:30.
