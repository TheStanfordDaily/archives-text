## 'Marxism a Challenge to Christianty' 
### Lynn DeLargey 
According to Bishop Harms
Lil.je, Marxist anti-religious ide
ology and propaganda is "a chal
lenge to the vague way west
erners sometimes deal with their
religious problems."
Lil.je, presiding bishop of the
Lutheran Church in East and
West Germany, outlined the in
tellectual and spirit u a 1 back
ground of the Christian-Commu
nist struggle in East Germany in
a speech in Dinkelspiel Auditor
ium last night.
The Marx is t anti - Christian
propaganda is epitomized by "The
Principle of Hope," by Ernst
Bloch, an East German philoso
pher. Bloch confronts Western
thought, which he says is largely
pessimistic and defeatist, with the
Marxist concept of man and so
ciety, which he says offers each
man a scientifically-based goal
and meaning in life.
"There is a sense of victory in
this type of thought," which
urges people to join in rebuilding
society, Lil.je said. Lenin's main
claim against Christianity was
that it was passive in the face
of human needs.
To combat such propaganda as
the anti-religious pamphlet "The
Sputnik and Our Dear Lord."
Christians must make sure their
theology is lucid and simple,
based on understanding and be
lief; they must do some "founda
tion-thinking" on a new approach
to reality, as the sciences have
done; and they must maintain
categories for dealing with hu
man problems.
