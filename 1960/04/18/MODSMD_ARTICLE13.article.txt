### 
SANTIAGO, Cuba (/P)--Prime
Minister Fidel Castro was quoted
yesterday as having said relations
between the United States and
Cuba could be improved if he
Could have a private meeting with
President Eisenhower or Secre
tary of State Christian A. Herter.
Castro, who has been leading a
10-day search for insurgents in
the Sierra Maestra, turned up at
the mountain town of El Caney
20 miles south of Bayamo.
An American radio correspond
ent. Richard Bates of the Colum
bia Broadcasting System, said
Castro gave him the statement
on Cuban-U.S. relations. Bates
said the comment appeared to be
made not as a formal bid or re
quest for such a meeting with
Eisenhower or Herter but rather
as backgrounding on the situation
between Cuba and the United
States.
Castro was quoted as saying a
heavy concentration of regular
troops in the mountainous region
of eastern Cuba resulted from a
desire to help train militiamen to
hunt down insurgents, a desire to
give regular troops combat train
ing and to be on the alert for
possible landings of invaders.
