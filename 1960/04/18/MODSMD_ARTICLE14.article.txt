### 
NEW YORK (/P) — The Com
munist party is thinking of run
ning a candidate of its own for
president, for tlie first time in 20
years.
But Gus Hall, the nation's top
Rod, says there are "so many
laws of limitation on minority par
ties in so many states" that a
nationwide campaign may not be
possible.
In New York, for example, a
minority party requires 12,000
nominating signatures, including
at least 50 from each of the state's
G2 counties.
Communist sources say there
is no clear-cut federal ban on a
presidential candidate, adding that
the so-called Communist Control
Act of 10.14 has never been tested
in this connection.
Chatting in his office, Hall said
the possibility of putting up a
candidate was discussed at length
by the party's national committee
at a recent meeting in Chicago.
He said.there was no opposition
to the idea, but only the question
of whether ii technically would be
possible.
"The question is not yet re
solved," he said.
He did not indicate whether he
or some other party official might
be ihe candidate.
The party's last candidate for
the presidency was Earl Browdcr,
in 1940.
