# Candidates for ASSU President
## 
### 
My primary concern in seeking
the office of ASSU president is
to find some answers to the
CHALLENGE put forth by Pro
lessor Paul C. Wermuth of East
ern State Teachers College when
he described campus activity as
"MERELY SOCIAL" and devoid
of any real purposes "except to
amuse the witless."
I don't deny the importance of
Ihe social function for ASSU or
class government. I do. however,
feci the sling of Wermuth's whip.
The following propositions are
part of my answer to the bitter
ness that calls the students at
Stanford witless.
A. A special presidential com
mittee within ASSU with the
responsibility of presenting both
sides of important issues in de
bate ajid discussion and of mak
ing petitions available on both
sides of the questions for those
who desire to express an opinion.
This places the responsibility for
student opinion, not with a "rep
resentative" body but where it
belongs- with the students. At
the same time, it would make
presentation of the issues more
efficient.
B. Faculty open houses to give
students in all courses the op
portunity to meet their profes
sors informally.
C. A campus-wide program of
after-dinner speakers, making
guest speakers on a wide variety
of topics available to all living
groups. Among the available top
ics would be description of
courses and opportunities avail
able within various majors and
interest areas. The talks would
bo 1(J or 15 minutes after dinner
followed by a question and discus
sion period for those interested.
Speakers and topics would he
chosen by the living groups, if
they so desired, from a list made
available by the Stu-Fac Com.
In order that I may come into
direct contact with the wit which
I believe to be here, I will be in
the Cellar on Wednesday from 10-
II and Thursday from 1-3 during
the primaries and for two hours
per week (or more) if electedâ€”
to get student opinion and answer
questions.

Recently there has been a good
deal of discussion regarding the
proper role of the ASSU. and it
has been widely suggested that
there are two principal courses
which it can follow. The first is
to sink to "dynamic do-nothing
ness" the chief motto of which is
"don't rock the boat." Legislature
should meet, pass the customary
by-law changes, harass an organi
zation or two, and refer a contro
versial matter to committee be
cause it's too hot to handle- but
never, come hell, high water, or a j
particularly galling edict from
"higher authorities" exercise;
leadership in developing or re-1
solving campus issues.
The commonly suggested al- j
ternative is to have the ASSU as !
a whole become primarily con- j
corned with national and interna-j
tional problems: segregation in
the South, apartheid in South At
tica, disarmament in the vvoi j/i
you name it. we debate it. Only
then, runs the argument, will
Stanford be a Great University
i like Harvard, Yale, and Cal?>.
Since the LASSU is not Con- i
gress or the U.N. General As- ;
sembly. there are other problems
which should also concern it, and
this second alternative throws the I
baby out with the bathwater, j
There is, however, a third, but,
alas, less dramatic alternative. !
ASSU can and should exercise j
leadership in those matters which
particularly concern us as stu
dents (e.g., the new Union, aca
demic and housoing policies, the
demise or senility of a few ASSU
organizations, etc.) remembering j
that some of the University's best i

critics can come from the student
body because of its unique p re
spective. The "great" issues can
i best be dealt with by giving
I greater support to organizations
| charged with their development
lIR, Political Union, and The
j Daily. What ASSU needs is dili
gence, determination, and organi-
I zation not revolution.

1. The? Fundamental Standard
I presupposes a norm of ethical
commitment within the Stanford
community. The ascendency of
ethical relativism renders that
| Standard meaningless. Therefore,
it should either be repudiated or
i translated into meaningful pro
positions.
2. The Daily editor is irrespon
sible, shrill, and trite. Under
article 5 section 2, of the ASSU
| Constitution, I advocate that the
student body vote to recall him.
3. The administration contem
plates a new student union with
soda fountains and bowling alleys
! multitudinous. Rising tuitions and
I vast alumni contributions would
be required. Americans have long
held inviolable the maxim: "no
! taxation without representation."
Therefore, I advocate that the
proposed union be submitted to a
plebiscite among Stanford stu
dents.
4. Is LASSU to become a vehicle
| for political agitators? Will the
Legislature in the name of the
I student body issue directives to
indifferent Congressmen and ex
crete encomiums to rioting Afri
cans? If elected, I swear that any
: legislature decision on an off
campus issue would be submitted
i to a plebiscite of the student body,
requiring a two-thirds majority.
Certain factions advocate that
| the ASSU affiliate with the Na
tional Student Association. This
affiliation would render every
Stanford student a member of the
; N.S.A. This organization, recently
ejected from Princeton University
land dominated by left-wing ideo
; logues, would speak in the name
of the 8,000 students with their
(diverse political orientations. The
; Daily assures us that "academic
freedom" extends to atheists, ma
terialists. comunists and socialists.
| The question: "Does it also ex
tend to Republicans and Demo
crats?"

It is quite clear that a reorgani
zation of our existing legislature
is quite necessary. At present the
legislature is completely ineffec
tive in formulating any kind of
student opinion simply because it
doesn't represent anybody and is
hamstrung in its other function
that of organizing and directing
student affairs. The question then
is, "How are \Vo going to remedy
these ills?"
On the basis of my one year
term on the legislature I intend
to do the following things: Fore
most in my play is to avoid any
panacea proposals, all of which in
the past have failed, until an ed

ucated study has been made by a
group appointed by me, existing
outside of the legislature, which
will find the reasons for our inef
fectiveness and seek definite
means whereby the existing body
will be streamlined and reorga
nized. Secondly, a wholehearted
attempt will be made to bring the
talents of this university into the
would-be challenging boards and
commissions. The effectiveness of
the present lIR will point up the
soundness of having students
working in their trained fields in
those student activities.
1 have adopted as my campaign
slogan, "Rebuild the Wreck." 1
don't pretend to have the master
plan without having dealt with
these problems as the executive
of the organization. It is clear that
any revamping will necessarily
originate in the executive depart
ment. The wreck won't rebuild
itself. I can assure you that after
careful consideration of our prob
lems, when a solution is found it
will be placed in effect without
fail.

The starting point of my "Three
| Point" platform is that student
govenment needs an entirely new
! role and function if it is ever go
ing to be of real value to Stan
ford students. I deny that the only
! valid concern of student govern
ment is with the petty details of
on-campus life. On the contrary
its real value as the "supreme pol
icy making power of the student
body" is its contribution to the
student's primary activity name
ly education.
For this reason. I advocate
j "Three Point" as a plan for re
directing student government to
the valuable role of prompting
i thought and discussion on the
i serious questions of the day. I
! propose that student government
! will:
1. Direct the attention of the
student body to vital issues by
organizing assemblies on national
I and international topics, bringing
outstanding speakers, encourag
ing analysis and debate.
2. Create a climate favorable to
individual and group initiative
' past mere thought and discussion;
by facilitating the signing and
i publicizing of petitions and reso
lutions; by allowing individuals
to support causes in which they
! believe.
3. Link Stanford with other
; universities now concerned with
similar issues by setting up an
| exchange of speakers, informa
tion. and ideas with California
universities and by committing
Stanford to membership in the
National Student Association.

The most important issue of
this campaign is that of the role
of the Legislature in faking
stands on important issues which j
are not of direct concern to stu- i
dents as a group. I do not feel
that Legislature should take such
stands. The structure of the ASSU
is such that its branches like the ;
Political Union, the 11R. the Daily,
and others can better handle such
discussions. A far wider range of
student opinion can be brought
out by well organized discussions ,
held by these groups. LASSU it
self should not be turned into a
debating society thus taking time
away from the function it should
serve, that of directing student
government. Discussion of the is
sues is of primary importance,
'aking stands is only secondary.
I feel that construction of the
Hostel should bo strongly pressed
for by next year's Legislature
Too often in the past programs ,

like this one have died over the
summer. I also think an official
channel should be set up to hear
complaints about the new Union
so that any changes can be made
before it is too late. Other proj
ects begun by this year's Legis
lature should be continued next
year. A thorough study of repre
sentation on LASSN should be
made so that inequities such as
Freshmen not being able to vote
for LASSU members at the Spring
elections could he corrected.
With regard to the question of
class "government" I feel that
' a great deal of the problem lies
in the Excoms. As they are now,
Excoms are very poor attempts
at representation. The classes
should elect their three officers
and these officers in turn should
coordinate the various social ac
tivities by appointing chairmen to
serve under them.
Stuednt government does have
weaknesses and they can be cor
rected. Changes should come
about through well planned pro
grams which deal with the most
1 important problems first not
; through crash programs which
seek to cure all ills at once or
which attempt to remedy all the
weaknesses by dealing with one
1 "key problem."
