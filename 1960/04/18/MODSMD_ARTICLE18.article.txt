Political Decline
Editor, the Daily:
I was quite surprised to see my
i name on the front page of the
April 13 Daily as a candidate for
ASSU president, for I have been
.in a steady political decline since
: 1951 when I was president of my
j seventh grade class.
While I appreciate the efforts
j of those who wished to see me
I elected, I must admit that I am
I eminently unqualified for the
position. I am a political conserva
tive having Supported Herbert
Hoover in the last three Presi
i dential campaigns. I don't even
i have a policy on Africa.
Finally, because my name was
put forth without my knowledge
or consent. I have withdrawn my
I candidacy; and I shall confine my
1 future political activity to lobby
ing for pensions for ex-seventh
grade presidents.
