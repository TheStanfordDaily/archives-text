### WILLIAM L. RYAN Associated Press News Analyst 
An anti - Castro organization
says it has learned the Cuban
Prime Minister plans to use May
Day to tough off violent demon
strations against the United
States and its citizens all over
Latin America.
The organization, "Cuba Demo
crat ica," says its intellgeince men
have learned Fidel Castro's agents
already have enlisted fanatical
students and Communist elements
to stone embassies and attack
U.S. citizens during and after
leftist parades celebrating May
Ist as International Workers'
Day. The organization says the
outbreaks in Panama should he
the wildest of all, with the object
of creating an atmosphere of
crisis there.
The report cannot be dismissed
simply as anti-Castro propaganda.
The preparations for May Day in
Cuba have had an ugly look all
along. Castro's agents in other
Latin - American countries are

known to have been working in
dustriously to stir up hatred for
North Americans.
The hand of world communism
is plain in the preparations. In
fact, in many respects, the cele
bration of May Day in Castro's
Cuba this year will remind one
forcefully of the way these things
are handled in countries already
under the rule of communism.
This year, as for many years
before this, the U.S.S.R.'s princi
pal Communis! newspaper, Prav
da, and the newspapers of all
Communist states come out with
the usual long, dreary lists of "slo
gans" which are supposed to in
spire the workers on what the
Communists choose 10 call the
workers' day.
