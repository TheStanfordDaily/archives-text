# Uclans by Decision, 66-65
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
The Stanford and UCLA track teams jockeyed with strategy like
they were playing a baseball game in the Stadium Saturday, and
when it was over the Indians found themselves on the short end
of a 66-65 score. Ironically enough it was an umpire's decision that
made the difference.
The disputed call came in the second race of the afternoon,

the 440. A 1 Myers of UCLA and
Stanford's Bob Besse were boih
timed in IX.X and a big discussion
ensued as to who had won the
race. The two first place judges
disagreed, one calling Myers the
winner, the other saying that
Besse had won.
One second place judge called
Uie race a dead heat and the other
said that Besse had taken second
and that Myers had won. Myers
was awarded the victory.
Then Ihe fun began.
Smith Surprises
In ihe 100 Stanford's Dean
Smith pulled a stunning upset
over the Bruin's Chris Knott.
Smith's t'ime was 9.N. When the
22<i rolled around, Smith, who
wasn't supposed to run the long
sprint, was standing at the start.
The strategy was to forget about
the low htu'dles, where Smith
would most likely lose to UCLA's
Bill Wells anyway, and to see if
Dean could beat Knott again.
Beat him he did. The race was
run around the turn and Smith
took ii in 21.6, with Knott running
second in 21.8.
The Bruins countered with a
little strategy of their own as
they started Jim Johnson in the
low hurdles, hoping to have him
pick up the second place behind
Wells, which is exactly what hap
pened. Wells won in 23.8 with
Johnson taking second in 24.7.
Thus, with two events left to be
run, the two-mile and the relay,
the score stood at 62-55 in favor
of the Bruins. The Tribe had to
take at least first and third in >he
two-mile and then win the relay if
it was to win.
Monzingo Starts
The last bit of strategy was
played and came very close to
working. Bob Monzingo, out for
several weeks with a troubled
knee, started. Ernie Cunlil'fe, who
had won both the mile and the
880 previously, also started with
the hope of wearing out the
UCLA men. John Northway was
about the only Indian in the. race
who was supposed to be there.
Northway and Cunliffe led for
the first two laps, bid Cunliffe
was overtaken by Bruins' Ken
Riding and Milford Dahl, and at
the end of four laps Ernie had to
drop out. Monzingo made his bid
at the end of the fifth lap and
took the lead while Northway
fell back to a distant fourth.
Monzingo pulled away fast on
the last lap and Northway made
a valiant bid, but Riding and Dahl

were too far ahead and took the
second and third spots which
were all IJCLA needed to win the
meet.
The relay was #anti-climatie as
the Tribe won handily in 3:13.4.
Stanford led the whole way and
was never in serious trouble.
Records Shattered
Cunliffe's times in the mile and
880 were 4:06.7 and 1:19.1 respec
tively, both new meet records.
The 880 time is also a new Sta
dium record, beating his old mark
of L-19.9 set last year.
Arl Batchelder took an upset
win in the javelin beating UCLA's
Hon Ulrich by three inches. Art
got off a heave of 230-9 to beat
Ulrich's mark of 230-0. Batchel
der's mark is seven feet over his
best previous mark.
Gerald Carr set a new meet
record in the discus for UCLA
with a toss of 173-8 '2.
