# Indians Snap Hatting Slump With Wins Over Diablos
## 
### 
Stanford's v a r s i t y baseball
team, starting to flex their mus
cles after an early season slump,
swept a two-game week-end series
from Los Angeles State College
by scores of 7-2 and 8-2. The In
dians battered Diablo pitchers for
a total of 25 hits in the two game
set.
In Friday's game catcher Bob
Overman belted a three-run triple
in the first inning to spark a five
run outbreak. That was all pitcher
Terry Lindemann needed as ho
held the Diablos to five hits and
struck out 12. The Indians added
one in the fourth and another in
the eighth for insurance.
Saturday, a five-run outburst
in the fourth inning enabled Stan
ford to roll past the Southlanders,
as they walloped 1 o hits in the
contest.
The live runs came on five base
hits by Overman, Marv Mecklen
berg, Hal Schutzmann, Mike Ma
gee, and Skip Lawrence.
Later in the game Lawrence
became the first Stanford player
to hit a home run out of the Sun
ken Diamond since 1958. He is
also the fifth in history to clear
the right field fence, r I is blast,
which came in the eighth inning,
sailed out over the 355-foot mark.
Mecklenberg turned in a mas
terful performance on the mound,
holding the opposition to just two

hits and two unearned runs.
The Card lefthander struck out
seven in his nine-inning stint.
The Indians broke out of their
slump at a good time, for they
face a weekend of rugged compe
tition, hosting UCLA on Friday
and Southern California Saturday
for a double-header.
