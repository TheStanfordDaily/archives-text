# Scene of 1906 Jolt Recalled
## 
### Austin Scott 
"It was reported from Palo Alto that all but one of the buildings
of Leland Stanford Junior University have been destroyed, and that
the beautiful Memorial Church of the University, perhaps the most
beautiful of all buildings in the United States, is a mass of ruins."
This statement appeared in the London Times of April 19, 1906,

54 years ago. It was the first
mention in England of the gieat
est earthquake ever to hit Cali
fornia.
The quake lasted for forty sec
onds. When the ground finally
stopped shaking, an appalling
amount of damage has been ddne
to Stanford buildings.
Stanford's 1786 students were
tossed out of bed and bounced
around their rooms. The first
shock in Encina Hall brought 300
scantily clad men into the cor
ridors in a mad rush for safety
and the open air.
The road in front was filled
with excited students who broke
through a rain of falling stones
and plaster.
Roble Chimneys Go
Roble Hall's huge twin chim
neys toppled in through the roof,
carrying parts of the third and
second floors down to the base
ment.
Four Roble girls were carried,
in their beds, from the third floor
to the first and escaped without
a scratch.
Another Roble woman grabbed
for a doorknob, caught it, and felt
the floor sink out from under her.
Clouds of steam were rising
from Engineering Corner, and a
fine blueish dust had settled on
everything.
The crowd was quiet for the
most part, although the statue of
Louis Aggasiz plunged headfirst
in the concrete in front of Jordan
Hall occasioned some laughter
and such comments as "He was
always a man of great penetra
tion," and "Mr. Aggrasiz was
good in the abstract, but not in
the concrete."
Chi Psi Knocked for Loop
The wooden buildings on the
campus withstood the shock very
well, although the Chi Psi house
,'was knocked ten feet off its
foundations. The stone ones suf
fered the heavy damage.
Memorial Church was almost a
total wreck. The bell tower col
lapsed inward, carrying the roof
of the church down to the floor.
The shock wave from the col
lapsing tower blew out the front
of the church, and the mosaic of
the Sermon on the Mount was
scattered over many acres.
In later years, Memorial
Church was taken apart, stone by
stone. Steel reinforcements were
erected, and the walls rebuilt
around them.
The arcade behind Memorial
Church was totally destroyed, and
never rebuilt.
The almost â€¢ completed library
on Lasuen Street was totally
wrecked. It has been topped by a
massive dome, which swayed back
and forth during the shock wreck
ing the brick wings.
Gym Total Loss
The new Gymnasium, also al
most completed, was a total loss.
The two wings of the Museum,
and the collonade that connected
it to the present Anatomy build
ing. were wrecked.
Only two were killed at Stan
ford. One Encina man was buried
by a falling chimney, and a corp
yard man was killed as he turned
off the power in the powerhouse,
thus averting a fire.
As April 18, 1906. wore on, the
campus bec a m e a camping
ground. Tents were brought in
and pitched for ihe homeless.
By evening, Palo Alto and Stan
ford went to the a if! of stricken
San Francisco. Supplies were col
lected, and students volunteered
their services.
School was postponed indefi
nitely by President David Starr
Jordan, and Stanford set about
climbing back on its feet.
Stanford reopened on August
23, and the class of 1906 received
diplomas at a slightly belated
graduation ceremony September
15.
Large Damage
Total damage to the campus
had been estimated at $2,800,000.
But it was found that the work
ing part of the University, as dis
tinguished from the architectural
effects, had sustained relatively
little damage.
Stanford shows very few signs
of the disaster today, 54 years
later. Memorial Church still has
a temporary roof over the dome,
the arcades do not extend all the
way around Quad, and if you look
carefully, you can find chunks of
stone in the field beside Memorial
Auditorium where the new li
brary stood.
The arch part of Memorial Arch
is only a memory. Encina was
repaired, as was Roble, without
the ornamental chimneys. Two
towers are all that remain of the
entrance gates at El Cumino,
