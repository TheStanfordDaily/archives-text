## Discoverer and Capsule Orbiting Earth Together 
### 
VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BACE, Calif. (TP) - The Discoverer
XI satellite and its wayward capsule -which was to have parachuted
seaward Saturday near Hawaii- are still whirling around the earth
in egg-shaped orbits.
The 300-pound package of instruments separated from its mother

satellite as scheduled on the 17th
trip over the Artie Circle.
But instead of dropping into the
atmosphere where CI 19 Flying
Boxcars were waiting to snag its
parachute on trapezes slung be
neath their fuselages, the capsule
stayed close to its mother ship
and became a baby satellite.
The Air Force, which launched
Discoverer XI here Friday, said
"Some unknown malfunction oc
curred at a critical point just aft
er separation."
This is a technical way of say
ing certain secret devices, de
signed to slow the capsule down
enough so it would fall to earth,
just didn't work.
The Air Force spokesman said
radio signals from the capsule
and radar tracking stations on the
ground -confirmed that the cap
sule remained in orbit after sepa
ration.
