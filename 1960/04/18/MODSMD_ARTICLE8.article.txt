# Graduation Forms Due by April 26
## 
### 
Graduating Seniors are remind
ed that they must apply to the
Registrar's Office for graduation.
Petitions for graduation are due
April 26.
Very few seniors have applied
so far. Seniors should not con
fuse the extra IBM card in their
reg booklets winter quarter with
a graduation petition.
The extra card was merely to
give the Registrar's Office some
idea of the number of graduates
to expect this June.
Seniors must still apply for
graduation. The University does
not graduate anyone without an
application.
