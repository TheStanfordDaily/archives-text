Legislature is now considering the feasibility of Stanford's af
filiating witli the National Student Association, which is described
elsewhere on this page.
Much of the opposition lo this affiliation revolves around the
question, "A\ hat is to be gained by membership in the \S and
the answer can onl\ be, "Right now. \er\ little." If the ASSI
nionc\ is placed on the counter for dues, there are few material
benefits which will immediately come hack over the counter for
all Stanford students. The long range aeerueinents. however, will
prove extremelv worthwhile.
Stanford will be able lo send six delegates to the \SA Con
gress held during the summer and to take advantage of the other
services of the .NiSA explained in the adjoining article. And. in
time, the added information and incentive provided h\ the dele
gates returning from the (iongressand other conferences will help
create on campus an interest and awareness in pertinent issues.
I he most important feature of the \SA is that it is a national
movement, as evidenced bv the more than 100 universities and
colleges w liich participate: and, as a broad movement, it can pro
vide students with advantages which they could not procure as
individuals or as members of individual student bodies.
Many students fail to realize that they, as a group, wield tre
mendous economic and political power and could obtain legisla
tion which would contribute to their education, both in finances
and in quality. Members of numerous occupations and organiza
tions form national groups to promote their interests: there is
lto reason vvhv students can t and shouldn't join together to further
their interests.
I hus. although lew students will he able to see the material
gains the minute LASSL votes to join NSA, the benefits lo Stan
lord students, and to students as a whole, will, in the long run.
be well worth the IT cents NSA will cost annuallv per person.
