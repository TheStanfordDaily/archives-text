Editor's Noft-: A special com

pointed to consider whether the
Stanford student body should
.join the National Student As
sociation. This committee will
hold a meeting' this afternoon
at 2:15 in the N'itery to discuss

students have been invited.

Concurrent with Ihe present dis
cussion of the involvement of stu
dent government in national and
international problems, the AS
SU has been asked to rejoin an
organization dealing directly with
these problems: National Student
Association.
NSA is a confederation of
some 400 American colleges and
universities, representing over one
million students. As one of its
primary functions. NSA pro
vides American college students
with a voice in national and inter
national affairs. It actively lob
bies in Congress, organizes stu
dent conferences on critical issues,
represents tho U.S. student com
munity in international student
organizations, and gene r a 1 1 y
brings problems of student inter
est to light.

Each year, during the summer,
delegates from member colleges
are sent to the National Student
Congress (Stanford would have
six voting delegates.) Over 1,000
persons attend this conference, in
cluding non-voting members. The
representatives discuss such is
sues as academic freedom, segre
gation, federal aid lo education,
selective service legislation, and
compulsory ROTC. These issues
are ultimately resolved by vote
ol' the entire Congress and be
come policy until changed by sue
ceding Congresses.
The National Executive Coun
cil. elected each year by ihe Con
gress, is charged with carrying
out these policies. Tn case any un
foreseen issues requiring immed
iate attention should arise in ihe
interim between Congresses, the
Council has been empowered to
enact any emergency policies it
sees fit.
In addition to tho above activi
ties. NSA publishes pamphlets
and newsletters of special interest
to students, provides member
schools wit It a travel service of
fering greatly reduced rates, and
maintains a collegiate news serv
ice for student newspapers.
