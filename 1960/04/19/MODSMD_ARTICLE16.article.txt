Academics First
Editor, the Daily:
In Iho Daily for April 14, you
published, on the front page, an
article reporting Dr. Dan T. Daw
son's recent talk to a session of
the California Elementary School
Administration Association. The
last three paragraphs of the arti
cle read thus:
"lie also criticized Stanford and
University of California profes
sors who found fault with the
programs of the San Francisco
public schools.
"Me noted they took exception
to making 'education for life in
a democracy' a primary educa
tional goal.
" 'In their opinion nothing and
1 repeat nothing could be more
profoundly hostile, to excellence
in education.' "
These lines make two rather
false impressions. First, the Stan
ford-California professors did not
go out of their way to criticize
San Francisco public schools.
They were asked to evaluate the
curriculum and its effectiveness
by the San Francisco Board of
Education itself, having been
nominated at the Board's request
by President Sterling and Presi
dent Kerr.
Second, and even more impor
tant if Dr. Dawson really spoke
the very emphatic words quoted
lie very seriously misunder
stood the substance of the Cur
riculum Report, as Dr. Dawson
himself must easily see from the
following two paragraphs, with
which the report begins:
1. "Our recommendations for
improving the curriculum of the
San Francisco schools are cen
tered on two basiÂ« aims. First, we
believe that the purpose of edu
cation is to inform the mind and
develop the intelligence. Recent
pedagogical theory, however, has
tended to make 'education for life
in democracy' the primary pur
pose of the public schools, inter
preting and applying that phrase
in a sense profoundly hostile to
excellence in education. The re
sult has been to skimp academic
subjects, to lower standards, and
to confuse and retard the whole
educational process. Nothing
could be more contrary to the real
interests of democracy. A demo
cratic society cannot survive with
out an educated electorate and
thoughtful, highly trained lead
ers. To set citizenship and de
mocracy in the classroom ahead
of academic subjects is to put the
cart before the horse. To empha
size democratic principles and
procedures before students can
understand them and before ihey
know why and how they came
into existence is premature and
self-defeating.
2. "Secondly, we believe that
the schools should make greater
provision for differences of abil
ity: every student should receive
the greatest challenge and be held
to the highest standards which
his abilities warrant. Equal op
portunity for all should mean the
best education for each level of
ability, never the levelling down
of all standards to bring them
within reach of the most indiffer
ent and the least able."

Withdrawal
Editor, tiie Daily:
At this stage of the campaign
for ASSU president. I have con
cluded that there is one candidate
who is best qualified for the job.
For this reason, I wish to express
my regrets and appreciation to
those who have given so much
help with my campaign and to
withdraw from the race in favor
of Larry Royse.
