Organize don't govern classes.
Student government, however,
does have a definite purpose and
place within the broader area of
campus affairs. ASSU offices are
necessary and effective organs of
this large scale organization.
Within this framework, the of
fice of the ASSU Vice President
in coordinating the activities of
the entire campus is an essential
and responsible position.
Through this function, the vice
president must serve as a vital
link between the sludent govern
ment and the student body at
large.
At the present time there are,
in my opinion, no radical changes
which can be made, either in this
office or in the effective adminis
tration of its responsibilities.
The problems which are of
most concern are those which
only constant attention and long
range planning can improve such
as student unity and foreign stu
dent relations.
The solution to these problems,
however, is often a matter of in
dividual effort, not on the part
of the vice president alone, but
on the part of members of the
student body. I would like to see
this individual effort encouraged
and promoted through this office.

Among the various duties of
the vice president of tlie student
body, perhaps the most important
are ihe large-scale campus social
activities with which she must be
concerned. She serves as a rep
resentative "hostess" for the
school, officially greeting travel
ing foreign groups and other vis
itors to campus. On the student
level, she explains those confus
ing social functions and regula
tions of the University to incom
ing women students.
Nor are the mon exempted
from some control from this of
fice, for the vice president serves
as the social "coordinating chair
man," meeting with the "social"
representatives of the living
groups on campus, and register
ing group overnights and other
campus social functions. These
duties are important as well as
interesting, and I would enjoy do
ing them, if elected.
These duties also involve a
great deal of paper work, dealing
with Deans' offices, conferences
and various routines of adminis
tration. In this field some experi
ence is valuable, and having
served in a class ex-com, and this
year as a member of the student
legislature, 1 feel I have gained
some familiarity with the han
dling of administrative duties, I
have also been able to observe the
manner in which student govern
ment at Stanford operates, and in
what areas it can exert useful in

fluence and perform necessary
duties, social and political, for the
student body ;it large.
As a voting member of the leg
islature, the vice president can
also work toward making the leg
islature less a board of approval
for constitutional amendments,
and have it more involved with
more lively student issues. This
I feel would be a great, even a
necessary, improvement in Stan
ford student government.
I propose to work toward this
goal .if I become your vice presi
dent. A candidate must bo ready
to devote a great deal of time to
the performance of the office. 1
feel that the office is a vital part
of the student government and
deserves the time necessary 10
run it properly. 1 have enjoyed
fulfilling an office of a similar
nature in the past, and would en
joy being able to serve you as vice
president of the student body.

ing social functions and regula
tions of the University to incom
ing women students.
Nor are the mon exempted
from some control from this of
fice, for the vice president serves
as the social "coordinating chair
man," meeting with the "social"
representatives of the living
groups on campus, and register
ing group overnights and other
campus social functions. These
duties are important as well as
interesting, and I would enjoy do
ing them, if elected.
These duties also involve a
great deal of paper work, dealing
with Deans' offices, conferences
and various routines of adminis
tration. In this field some experi
ence is valuable, and having
served in a class ex-com, and this
year as a member of the student
legislature, 1 feel I have gained
some familiarity with the han
dling of administrative duties, I
have also been able to observe the
manner in which student govern
ment at Stanford operates, and in
what areas it can exert useful in

fluence and perform necessary
duties, social and political, for the
student body ;it large.
As a voting member of the leg
islature, the vice president can
also work toward making the leg
islature less a board of approval
for constitutional amendments,
and have it more involved with
more lively student issues. This
I feel would be a great, even a
necessary, improvement in Stan
ford student government.
I propose to work toward this
goal .if I become your vice presi
dent. A candidate must bo ready
to devote a great deal of time to
the performance of the office. 1
feel that the office is a vital part
of the student government and
deserves the time necessary 10
run it properly. 1 have enjoyed
fulfilling an office of a similar
nature in the past, and would en
joy being able to serve you as vice
president of the student body.

Organize don't govern classes.
Student government, however,
does have a definite purpose and
place within the broader area of
campus affairs. ASSU offices are
necessary and effective organs of
this large scale organization.
Within this framework, the of
fice of the ASSU Vice President
in coordinating the activities of
the entire campus is an essential
and responsible position.
Through this function, the vice
president must serve as a vital
link between the sludent govern
ment and the student body at
large.
At the present time there are,
in my opinion, no radical changes
which can be made, either in this
office or in the effective adminis
tration of its responsibilities.
The problems which are of
most concern are those which
only constant attention and long
range planning can improve such
as student unity and foreign stu
dent relations.
The solution to these problems,
however, is often a matter of in
dividual effort, not on the part
of the vice president alone, but
on the part of members of the
student body. I would like to see
this individual effort encouraged
and promoted through this office.

Among the various duties of
the vice president of tlie student
body, perhaps the most important
are ihe large-scale campus social
activities with which she must be
concerned. She serves as a rep
resentative "hostess" for the
school, officially greeting travel
ing foreign groups and other vis
itors to campus. On the student
level, she explains those confus
ing social functions and regula
tions of the University to incom
ing women students.
