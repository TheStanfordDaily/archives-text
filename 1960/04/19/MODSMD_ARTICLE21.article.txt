On a More Serious Vein
While Spring seemed to hit my two colleagues and fellow
sport columnists John Scliwarz and lion Kapopoi't last week as
evidenced by their two pictures of Carol Trefoil there was some
connection to college tennis and Tuesday Weld Ron seemed to
he promoting an Olympic strip tease contest this week this writer
must return to the conservative field of men and boys and
college sports.
Last weekend the college sports world heard the sad news of
the death of Wisconsin boxer Charlie Molir. Mohr was knocked out
and collapsed with a brain injury after his attempted defense of the
NCAA 165-lb, title April 9.
This death might raise a hue and cry to abolish college boxing

from many of its critics and
might impair college boxing's al
ready shaky existence in this
country. Currently at last report
there were only 18 institutions
sponsoring a boxing team and
only six have over 2,000 in attend
ance. Of course with the recent
success of boxing at Stanford due
mainly to the efforts of coach
Kay Lnnny and cooperation from
the Athletic Department, this
writer was concerned with any
unfavorable results here in the
aftermath of the Wisconsin box
er's demise. Certainly Stanford
boxing with sluggers Kd Roth
man and Bruce Bellows, this sea
son. and Trev Grimm last year—
has produced some exciting
matches and is definitely increas
ing in popularity as evidenced by
the larger fight crowds.
When questioning Assist. Ath
letic Director Clnick Taylor as to
any change of policy from the
Athletic Department next year,
Taylor replied, "We plan no

change in the future due to the accident. Boxing on the college
level is good providing no mis-matching occures. This tragedy was
serious not only in the youngster's (Molir) case but also college
boxing has suffered through its various critics saying this is too
tough for college men."
Taylor went on by establishing himself definitely in favor of
college boxing and more specifically boxing at Stanford. "Boxing
is a top-notch body-contact sport wnich definitely teaches poise and
confidence and develops the athlete's competitive spirit," Taylor
continued.
Stanford IJoxing-Tlie Right Answer
Another important aspect (if the boxing picture at Stanford is
the boxing training and competitive program. The greatest danger—
aside from hidden physical defects which apparently was the cause
of Molir's death -is mis-matching the contestants. The best cure
for this is a good training program, which coach Liinny certainly
supplies for the Stanford men, and a competitive schedule with
teams of comparable ability. Stanford also succeeds in this aspect in
the six-team league composed of California, San Francisco State,
Fresno State, Santa Clara, Cliico Slate % and Stanford. Noticeably
missing from Stanford opposition are such teams as Sacramento
State, San Jose State and Idaho State who rely on heavy proselyting
for ex-servicemen and AAU boxers to fill their championship teams.
The program at Stanford is one of instruction, training and last
the competition in a ring with an equal opponent. Certainly our
fighters produce some good scraps and with Bellows reaching the
semis in the 156 lb. class and Rotlunan making the finals of the
heavyweight division in the NCAA matches two weeks ago, the
boys rank with any of the college boxers in the nation. •
With the obvious vote of confidence from the Athletic Depart
ment and the fine training and competitive system which makes
for few, if any, mis matches, boxing should stay at Stanford for
quite a while and deservedly so.
Returning boxers Rothman, Bellows, Jeff Tomkins and others
will make the team equally strong next year and quite possibly
the Card mittmen could end out the season undefeated. All the
boxers like to win but certainly the more relaxed and informal but
good college boxing at Stanford should draw even more fans
next year.

teams of comparable ability. Stanford also succeeds in this aspect in
the six-team league composed of California, San Francisco State,
Fresno State, Santa Clara, Cliico Slate % and Stanford. Noticeably
missing from Stanford opposition are such teams as Sacramento
State, San Jose State and Idaho State who rely on heavy proselyting
for ex-servicemen and AAU boxers to fill their championship teams.
The program at Stanford is one of instruction, training and last
the competition in a ring with an equal opponent. Certainly our
fighters produce some good scraps and with Bellows reaching the
semis in the 156 lb. class and Rotlunan making the finals of the
heavyweight division in the NCAA matches two weeks ago, the
boys rank with any of the college boxers in the nation. •
With the obvious vote of confidence from the Athletic Depart
ment and the fine training and competitive system which makes
for few, if any, mis matches, boxing should stay at Stanford for
quite a while and deservedly so.
Returning boxers Rothman, Bellows, Jeff Tomkins and others
will make the team equally strong next year and quite possibly
the Card mittmen could end out the season undefeated. All the
boxers like to win but certainly the more relaxed and informal but
good college boxing at Stanford should draw even more fans
next year.

While Spring seemed to hit my two colleagues and fellow
sport columnists John Scliwarz and lion Kapopoi't last week as
evidenced by their two pictures of Carol Trefoil there was some
connection to college tennis and Tuesday Weld Ron seemed to
he promoting an Olympic strip tease contest this week this writer
must return to the conservative field of men and boys and
college sports.
Last weekend the college sports world heard the sad news of
the death of Wisconsin boxer Charlie Molir. Mohr was knocked out
and collapsed with a brain injury after his attempted defense of the
NCAA 165-lb, title April 9.
This death might raise a hue and cry to abolish college boxing

from many of its critics and
might impair college boxing's al
ready shaky existence in this
country. Currently at last report
there were only 18 institutions
sponsoring a boxing team and
only six have over 2,000 in attend
ance. Of course with the recent
success of boxing at Stanford due
mainly to the efforts of coach
Kay Lnnny and cooperation from
the Athletic Department, this
writer was concerned with any
unfavorable results here in the
aftermath of the Wisconsin box
er's demise. Certainly Stanford
boxing with sluggers Kd Roth
man and Bruce Bellows, this sea
son. and Trev Grimm last year—
has produced some exciting
matches and is definitely increas
ing in popularity as evidenced by
the larger fight crowds.
When questioning Assist. Ath
letic Director Clnick Taylor as to
any change of policy from the
Athletic Department next year,
Taylor replied, "We plan no

change in the future due to the accident. Boxing on the college
level is good providing no mis-matching occures. This tragedy was
serious not only in the youngster's (Molir) case but also college
boxing has suffered through its various critics saying this is too
tough for college men."
Taylor went on by establishing himself definitely in favor of
college boxing and more specifically boxing at Stanford. "Boxing
is a top-notch body-contact sport wnich definitely teaches poise and
confidence and develops the athlete's competitive spirit," Taylor
continued.

Another important aspect (if the boxing picture at Stanford is
the boxing training and competitive program. The greatest danger—
aside from hidden physical defects which apparently was the cause
of Molir's death -is mis-matching the contestants. The best cure
for this is a good training program, which coach Liinny certainly
supplies for the Stanford men, and a competitive schedule with
