# INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL CHAMPS
## Sigma Chi Wins Tourney Daily Sports 
### 
Ninety-nine days later the dust
settled, league games, playoffs,
semifinals, . . . finished. The dust
was the competitive furor created
by the 99 teams entered in the
intramural basketball program; it
settled when Sigma Chi edged
Theta Xi in a thriller, 41-39, last
night at the Pavilion for the
intramural championship.
The program, which started
early in January, took time, but it
was worth it. In intramural di
rector Elwyn Bugle's words,
"We could have gotten through
sooner, bul more teams got to
play this way."
Good Competition
If last night's final was any in
dication, the time spent resulted
in some "good competition. Theta
Xi, a sharp shooting outfit, played
on even terms with Sigma Chi
most of the evening before the
winners put together their su
perior board strength with a hot
scoring streak to move ahead.
Before halftime Sigma Chi
opened a four point lead, due
mainly to their rebounding and
tips, but Theta Xi scored on long
shots just before the buzzer and
cut the champion's lead down to
a 23-21 margin at halftime.
Opening the second half, both
teams continued matching points,

tying the score at 23-23, 25-25. 30-
130. Then at the opening of the
I final stanza Sigma Chi resumed
their previous two point com
mand, edged it up to five at one
point and held on 1o win. A tech
nical foul called against Theta Xi
i with about a minute loft gave the
winners their final point,
i Student intramural director
Roy Millender termed the game
: "The best final game I've seen in
j four years of murals."
Schrauh and Anderson
For Sigma Chi Tony Schraub
and Bruce Anderson were the big
men. Schraub, who tallied 16
points, played for Campbell dur
ing his high school days and was
picked most valuable player in
the Santa Clara Valley Athletic
| League. Anderson accounted for

eight markers on the scoreboard
and picked up previous <vcperi
ence as a frosh and JY 112 hoopster
at Stanford.
Bill Martin and Sandy Schul
hofer led Theta Xi. Schulhofer
scored 14 points, once played on
the Indian's frosh basketball team
and iÂ« considered one of the best
intramural players. Martin
matched Schulhofer's total and he
also is no si ranger to the game,
having played high school ball at
Long Beach and making all
league.
