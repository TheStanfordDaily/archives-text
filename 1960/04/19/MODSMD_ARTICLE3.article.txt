# SOCIAL PRESSURE
## Choice of Values Not Conscious 
### Bob Frank 
Madison Avenue came out the
loser last night as the Socialist
Caucus began a series of "Revolt
of Conscience" discussion at the
I Center.
"Social Values in a Capitalist
Society," the panel members
agreed, are seldom consciously
chosen. The individual submits to
social pressure instead of his own
conscience. He is taught what, to
want, the panelists said.
George Guy, a graduate eco
nomics student' and chairman of
the Socialist Caucus, served as
moderator. Panel members were
Hob Richardson, a graduate phi
losophy student, and Michael
Freeman and Howard Richards,
law students.
Rather than change our eco
nomic system because of ihe ma
teralistic values it fosters, the
panel advocated an individual,
personal rejection of them.
Freeman pointed out the con
cept of the "virtue of (voluntary)
poverty" amortg Christian saints
and in Thoreau as arguments that
once the pursuit of wealth is re
jected as a supreme value, we are
free to pursue "spiritual" values.
Richards described the change
from the "Protestant ethic" to the
"social ethic" in America, and
a rgu e d th a t while emphasis
changes from production to con
sumption, America's values are
still oriented on an economic,
rather than a spiritual plane.
