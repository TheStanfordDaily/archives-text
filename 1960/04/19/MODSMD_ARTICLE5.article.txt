# 'Chessman Will Die:' Warden
## 
### 
TUCSON, Ariz. (/Pi â€” Fred
Dickson, warden of California's
San Quentin Prison, yesterday
said he believes convict-author
Caryl Chessman definitely will die
in the gas chamber May 2.
Dickson, attending a regional
conference of wardens in Tucson,
said there still is legal action un
der way to spare Chessman's life
but he doubts it will be successful.
"When I saw Chessman two
weeks ago," the warden said, "he
was his usual egotistical self.
However, he expects to he ex
ecuted May 2. Me figures, maybe,
it's just as well to get it over
with."
The warden would not comment
when asked if he thought Chess
man's life should be spared.
Supreme Court Again
In Washington yesterday the
Chessman case was laid on the
Supreme Court's doorstep for the
16th time.
This time it was A. L. Wirin,
a Los Angeles lawyer, who ap
pealed to the high court to review
Ihe case of Chessman who has
been in Death Row at San Quen
tin for nearly 12 years while try
ing to escape the gas chamber for
kidnapping with bodily harm.
Wirin based his appeal for a
stay of the May 2 execution and
a review on two points.
First, he maintained that Cali
fornia's Gov. Brown granted a
stay of a Feb. 19 execution date
"so that persons in South America
would have no excuse for demon
strating against or harming of
President Eisenhower on his
forthcoming trip there."
Indeed Cruel
But now that the trip is over,
Wirin said. Chessman "is to be
returned to the cyanide pellet."
This, the attorney claimed, "is in
deed cruel, unusual and violative
of due process."
Wirin protested also that Chess
man, known as the "Red Light
Bandidt," was tried on a simple
kidnapping for robbery charge, a
non-capital offense, but was con
victed of kidnapping for robbery
with bodily harm which is punish
able by death.
No Indication
There was no indication when
the court would act on the appeal.
The Supreme Court has heard
arguments in the case only once.
It ruled in 1957 that a charge that
the record of the trial was incom
plete should be reviewed by Cali
fornia courts. This was done and
the record was found adequate.
The other 14 times, the court
refused to hear the case.
The 1937 ruling was a 5-3 ver
dict and in opposing the review
Justice William O. Douglas said
for the dissenters, "The conclu
sion is inescapable that Chessman
is playing a game with the courts
while the facts of the case grow!
