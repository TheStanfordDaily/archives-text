## De Gaulle Now in Canada For 17-Day Western Tour 
### 
OTTAWA French Presi
dent Charles de Gaulle arrived
last night for a 17-day visit to the
Western Hemisphere, including
presummit talks in Ottawa and
Washington.
He will spend four days in Can
ada and a week in the United
Stales before concluding his 17,-
000-mile trip with a visit to
French Caribbean territories.
This is the first visit of the 69-
year-old French leader to North
America since 1945.
While the visit will be mostly
social, diplomatic officials believe
his talks with Canadian and U.S.
leaders will constitute an impor
tant part of Western preparations
for the May 16 summit confer
ence.
DeGaulle will meet Prime Min
ister John Diefenbakcr twice to
day for private conversations.

Also taking part in the talks
will be Maurice Couvc do Murville
and Howard Green, the French
and Canadian foreign ministers.
Cahada, as an ardent supporter
of the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization, has taken an active
part in drafting Western strategy.
As a member of the Western
disarmament team in Geneva
talks, Canada has played a key
role in arms negotiationsâ€”a ma
jor subject for summit discus
sions.
The most important diplomatic
talks, however, are expected to
take place after De Gaulle arrives
in Washington Friday. He and
President Eisenhower will begin
their conversations Saturday at
the President's Gettysburg farm.
De Gaulle is expected to urge the
IJ. S. administration to share
atomic secrets with France.
