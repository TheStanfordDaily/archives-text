### 
A public poet is mistaken for
Baghdad's chief beggar, and the
"funniest Arabian night" ensues
in "Kismet," Ram's Head's spring
show scheduled for Memorial
Auditorium May 4, 5, 6 and 7.
It's all a twist of "Kismet,"
or fate, that the poet is hauled

before the chief of the desert brig
ands. jokingly says he'll lift a
curse from the robber's head, and
then sees his boast amazingly
come true.
Hajj, the public poet played by
Everett Nygaat'd, finds himself in
hot water when mistaken for

another man. A fast talker, he
gets himself out of one situation
only to find himself pretty deep
in another just as risky.
Desert Intrigue
At the climax of his touchy
business, Hajj allies with the
wicked Wazir of Baghdad's police
in an attempt to keep the Caliph
from marrying his commoner
lover.
"Fate" steps into the picture
when the poet learns that the
commoner lover is none ot her
than his daughter Marsinah. With
no time left for fast talking'the
poet, in league with the Wazir's
alluring wife Lalume, kills off the
Wazir and clears the way for his
daughter's happiness, marrying
Lalume in the process.
