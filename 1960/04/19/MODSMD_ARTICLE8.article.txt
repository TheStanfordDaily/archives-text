# Co-Existence Impossible States Gen. Wedemeyer
## U.S. Surrender of Initiative To Other Nations Also Rapped 
### Jerry Rankin 
America's lack of stated national aims and tlie impossibility
of co-existence with the Soviet Union were underlined by Gen.
Albert Wedemeyer in a talk yesterday afternoon at. the Women's
Clubhouse.
The retired Army general told his audience that the complete
opposition of Communist and U.S. ideals precludes any possibility
of co-existence between the two forces.
Communism's definition of co-existence would have the American

people subservient to Russia.
Wed'emeyer said. Thus, co-exist
ence between the two countries
can not come about, he believes.
He also rapped Ihe U.S.'s sur
render of the initative in inter
national policies to other nations.
No one in this country is plan
ning now for what may happen
in Iho future, YVedemeyer said.
Inform World of Plans
The government should let
other countries know "what we
are striving to do in the world.
You must place before the bar of
world opinion your own objec
tives.
"Our aims must be flexible . . .
and clearly stated." We must use
our political, economic and psy
chological-social resources to im
plement these aims, he declared.
If we utilize these three re
sources. we will not have to resort
to our military facilities, the gen
eral said. He pointed out the "very
effective" use Russia has made of
the three non-military resources.
No Cuban Explanation
In contrast to this, the U.S. has
not yet explained to the Cuban
people its policy towards Cuba,
he said.
Wedemcyer also stated that "I
differ 100 per cent" with Presi
dent Eisenhower's and Vice Presi
dent Nixon's statements that the
Russian leaders want world
peace.
The general said last week
that the U.S. should withdraw its
recognition of every Communist
country, and if necessary, the
United Nations should bar those
governments from the U.N.
U.S. Leave IV?
He also said that the U.S. might
have to leave the U.N. if the Red
countries weren't booted out. Yes
terday, however, he declared that
any move by this country to leave
the U.N. should be carefully and
seriously considered before any
action is taken.
Regarding negotiations with
Communist countries, Wedemcyer
said: "If it is to our advantage to
sit down and talk with these
people," we should do so.
He also noted, while admitting
he wasn't fully informed on the
situation, that if he had the de
cision to make as president of a
university he would "probably"
make ROTC voluntary, rather
than compulsory.

plement these aims, he declared.
If we utilize these three re
sources. we will not have to resort
to our military facilities, the gen
eral said. He pointed out the "very
effective" use Russia has made of
the three non-military resources.
No Cuban Explanation
In contrast to this, the U.S. has
not yet explained to the Cuban
people its policy towards Cuba,
he said.
Wedemcyer also stated that "I
differ 100 per cent" with Presi
dent Eisenhower's and Vice Presi
dent Nixon's statements that the
Russian leaders want world
peace.
The general said last week
that the U.S. should withdraw its
recognition of every Communist
country, and if necessary, the
United Nations should bar those
governments from the U.N.
U.S. Leave IV?
He also said that the U.S. might
have to leave the U.N. if the Red
countries weren't booted out. Yes
terday, however, he declared that
any move by this country to leave
the U.N. should be carefully and
seriously considered before any
action is taken.
Regarding negotiations with
Communist countries, Wedemcyer
said: "If it is to our advantage to
sit down and talk with these
people," we should do so.
He also noted, while admitting
he wasn't fully informed on the
situation, that if he had the de
cision to make as president of a
university he would "probably"
make ROTC voluntary, rather
than compulsory.

GENERAL ALBERT WEDEMEYER
Communism's eo-existenee would make U.S. subservient to Itussia
America's lack of stated national aims and tlie impossibility
of co-existence with the Soviet Union were underlined by Gen.
Albert Wedemeyer in a talk yesterday afternoon at. the Women's
Clubhouse.
The retired Army general told his audience that the complete
opposition of Communist and U.S. ideals precludes any possibility
of co-existence between the two forces.
Communism's definition of co-existence would have the American

people subservient to Russia.
Wed'emeyer said. Thus, co-exist
ence between the two countries
can not come about, he believes.
He also rapped Ihe U.S.'s sur
render of the initative in inter
national policies to other nations.
No one in this country is plan
ning now for what may happen
in Iho future, YVedemeyer said.
Inform World of Plans
The government should let
other countries know "what we
are striving to do in the world.
You must place before the bar of
world opinion your own objec
tives.
"Our aims must be flexible . . .
and clearly stated." We must use
our political, economic and psy
chological-social resources to im
plement these aims, he declared.
If we utilize these three re
sources. we will not have to resort
to our military facilities, the gen
eral said. He pointed out the "very
