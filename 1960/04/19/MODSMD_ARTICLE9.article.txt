# Stanford Asks For Foothills Zoning Laws
## 
### 
In a letter sent recently to the
Palo Alto Planning Commission,
the University has requested that
Palo Alto set up a zoning for its
proposed 250-acrc annexation in
the foothills south of Junipero
Serra Boulevard which would re
quire the light industries there
to preserve the "rolling terrain
and its open feeling."
Alf E. Brandin, vice president
for business affairs, said in the
letter that the new zoning "would
allow the general types of select
professional, light manufacturing
and research facilities now per
mitted under L-M (limited manu
facturing) zoning, but would es
tablish higher standards of de
velopment such as larger lot
sizes, less building coverage and
greater set barks."
Brandin suggested that, as a
minimum, the zoning follow the
regulations of the industrial park:
sites of not less than five acres,
front yard setbacks of not less
than 100 feel and building cover
age of not more than 20 per cent.
At present L-M zoning permits
building sites as small as one
acre, building coverage of 10 per
cent and front yard setbacks of
20 feel.
The proposal will be presented
at a public hearing on zoning by
the Palo Alto Planning Commis
sion tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.
