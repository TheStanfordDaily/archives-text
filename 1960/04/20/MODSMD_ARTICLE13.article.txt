## 
### 
SEOUL, Korea (/P) Defiant students and townspeople armed with guns, knives and clubs held
mob control over northeastern Seoul today in the bloody, fiery Korean civilian revolt against al
leged political corruption. Ruins of public buildings still smoked from mob-set fires.
Korean military forces were moving relentlessly into the capital. On the international front
the United States rebuked the Korean government for repressive measures.
Secretary of State Christian A. Herter, in an unusual public rebuke, called on South Korea yes-

terday to end what he called "re
pressive measures" against anti
government demonstrators.
"Unsuited to a free democra
cy," Herter said of the crackdown
by South Korean soldiers and po
lice.
John M. Chang, Korea's lame
duck vice president, declared the
government of President Syng
man Rhee can appease the re
bellious populace only by holding
new elections.
