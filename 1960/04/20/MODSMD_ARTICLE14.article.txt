### 
"Wslerdav, in a first, unpuhlicizcd effort. Stanford students
raised 538.21 to send to the South for legal aid for students ar
resled in -it-in strikes al segregated luneh counters.
Ohcrlin College has raised $2,70'). 10, and there is certainly llie
potential for twice that amount on this eain|)iis.
Die expression of interest yesterday was a good sil l of that
potential, and 111«* outlets for interest here are definitely available.
A tahle to collect funds for legal aid will he on K.ngineering
('.orner all this week. Political Union is sponsoring a series of
discussions and debates on the problem in an effort to stimulate
student interest and perhaps in preparation for LASSU's "taking
a -land": and vesterdav a group of students went to \\ oolworth's
in Palo Alto and the Stanford Shopping ( .enter to picket.
All these actions are expressions of support for a group of
Southern students who have started a courageous movement: a
mass non-violent protest against segregation, to demand the lights
and dignity of Negroes.
So far several hundred of them have been arrested and many
have been suspended from their respective colleges.
Although Palo Alto is 2,000 miles away from Atlanta and Nash
ville, what goes on there has a great deal to do with the world
we live in.
Il has every thing to do with the dignity, self-respect, and rights
of everv citizen of the United States.
The students at l-isk I niversity and elsewhere deserve anv sup
port we can give to them.
Moncv for legal aid is invaluable, and picketing will hit the
people responsible for segregated lunch counters where il hurls
in the cash register.

protesi in North Carolina put il this way:
"We . . . picket to protest the lack of dignity and respect shown
us as human beings.
"We.. . picket to enlist the support of all l whatever their color I
in gelling the services in business places thai will grant us (lignit\
and respect.
"We . . . [ticket to help the businessman make changes that
will bring us closer to the Christian and democratic practices."
In this case, a failure to act on our parts is tacit approval of
segregation. The opportunity for support is here: we cannot
ignore it.
