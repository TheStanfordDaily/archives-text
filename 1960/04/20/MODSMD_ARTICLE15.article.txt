# 'Ideas', Anyone?
## 
### 
Hold campaign platforms dedicated to the discussion of "ideas*"
sound promising but fail to discuss the real issue al stake: Is stu
dent government capable of expressing "â– ideas" or not?
Two people can be pin discussing "ideas," and twenty-nine
around a well-polished table constitute a fine bull session. Ilovvever,
btil I sessions are not enough for student government, and it will take
much thought and work to make Thursday evenings al Row man
more than a polite discussion iu best Western C.i\ style.
I be fact remains that the officers of the student bod\ as well
;>s Legislature members are elected by constituencies which theo
retically look to their representatives as a means for participating
in the activities of student government.
If, then, student government is to discuss "ideas," the ideas
must come from the students through their representatives to the
Legislature, a process which involves a great deal more work than
i> now expended h\ members of LASSI .
Advocating "ideas" is not enough: one must be prepared to go
on! and find them. The real question is whether student officials
and Legislature candidates are willing to spend as much of their
time talking with their constituencies as they spend talking at
each other in Hownian. And beneath the talk is the nagging ques
tion of whether we students realk have any ideas lo express.
