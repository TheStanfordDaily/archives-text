### Richard Sundeen ASSU President 
In months, the sit-in
movement of the Southern Ne
groes has been one of the major
political and social issues of our
nation. Such a movement, led in
many cases by college students,
has importance to Stanford stu
dents, both as students and citi
zens.
At its last meeting, the ASSU
Legislature resolved that a pro
gram concerning the sit-in move
ments should be presented. It was
hoped this program, consisting
of Daily articles, and talks or de
bates, would stimulate critical
thought, discussion, and expres
sion of views by the students on
the events of the South.
However, the Legislature will
not discuss the issue at this time.
Rather, the ASSU Political Union
Board, whose purpose is "to pre
sent a varied program of educa
tion on political and â€¢social issues
and to give students an opportun
ity to study, to make their own
decisions, and to express their
own opinions in debate on these
issues," will present the program.
It was felt that the Legislature
is not in the position to reflect
the true student opinion on this

issue or any issue of such national
or international prominence be
cause of the great diversity of this
opinion. The significant benefits
to the individual and to humanity
of concerning ourselves with
these issues come, not from a
hasty poll of the Legislature after
some unfounded and unqualified
arguments, but from the educa
tional processes involved in dis
cussion of the issue. To fulfill
the educational function of the
ASSU is one of the major reasons
for this examination of Ihc move
ment.
Such a method will enable all
students'to observe the problems
involved. And, of course, it will
give those enthusiasts who are
demanding that more national is
sues be considered within the
realm of student government
much fertile groumj in which to
participate.
However, a forum-like program
is not a new ASSU activity. Simi
lar ones are constantly presented
throughout the quarter by groups
such as the lIR and the Political
Union. If you are interested in
participating in programs such as
these, I would suggest that, rath
er than a loiter to the editor, you
contact Alan Kahn of the lIR or
Ted Hicks of the Political Union.
