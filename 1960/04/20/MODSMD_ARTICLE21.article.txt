Whistling Shrimps
Kditor, the Daily:
This letter is meant for about
! 300 curious students who signed
j up to exchange letters with stu
dents in the Soviet Union last fall.
I am now working in Washing
ton, D.C., but my friends at Stan
ford inform me that as of yet no
letters have been received from
Russia. If the 300 are curious, let
me say that 1 am also. Let me re
' cap the series of events:
When I was in the Soviet Union
last summer, a sizable number of
college students asked me wheth
er it would be possible to carry
I on a pen pal relationship with
American students. In autumn
quarter, I mentioned this to a
number of classes and residences
j where I spoke, and about 300
Stanford-people signed up to cor
respond with Russians.
When the Pro-Rector of Mos
j cow University was at Stanford
| in November, I asked him if he
' would be willing to find 300 Eng
! lish-speaking students at Moscow
University to correspond. Me an
swered that, surely, he would be
i glad to.
At the end of November, I
| typed up a list and mailed it to
him in Moscow. The understand
ing was t hat each Russian would
be given a Stanford name and
would write first. As far as I am
aware, not a single letter has
gotten off the launching pad.
I have recently written Moscow
again and politely requested that
j we get on with it. It is my earnest
hope that Stanford students will
be receiving mail from Ihe USSR
before the end of spring quarter.
But, I confess, t his is only a hope.
: It may be that we won't hear
! from Russia until to use Pre
| mier Khrushchev's words "the
j shrimps learn how to whistle."

Not a Dictator
Editor, the Daily:
Woidd you be kind enough to
publish the following letter in an
-1 swer to an unfortunate statement
: which appeared at the beginning
of Dick White's article (April 14)
i "Italy's Government Crisis," and
; which reads as follows: "(Italy)
[ has not yet seen fit to follow her
gallic sister (France) in the aboli
j tion of democracy."
In fact, if even they are needed,
several arguments prove that in
spite of Dick White's belief,
| France "has not yet abolished
j democracy."
1. The present government
! rules according to a Constitution
I which was regularly approved by

6fj per cent of the French electoral
body in 1958.
2. Though it probably establish
ed a most defective political
mechanism, this constitution,
nevertheless, guarantees all usual
democratic liberities and princi
ples.
3. No political party in France,
except the Communist Party, has
officially accused the present
regime of being a dictatorship.
4. Abroad no country (even Dick
White's, the U.S.A.) has officially

stated that General de Gaulle was
a dictator.
r>. Though General de Gaulle
! could take dictatorial powers, in
such a case he would have to
repudiate the Constitution,
and up to date, fortunately, this
has not yet happened. . . .
I have felt entirely free of at
tacking his (White's! inaccurate
statement since I am far from
being an uncritical supporter of
General de Gaulle's policy.
