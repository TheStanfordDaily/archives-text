## COLLEGE: THE FOE OF EDUCATION 
### Author of "I Was a Teen-age Dwarf", "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis", etc 
Ti) your quest for a college 'degree, are you becoming a narrow
specialist, or are you being educated in tlie broad, classical
sense of the word? This question is being asked today by many
serious people—including mv barber, my podiatrist, and my
little dog Spot—and it would be well to seek an answer.
Let us examine our souls. Are we becoming experts only in
the confined area of our majors, or does our knowledge range
far and wide? Do we, for example, know who fought in the
1 tattle of Salaniis, or Kant's epistemology, or l'lanck's constant,
or the voyage of the Jicaglc, or Palestrina's cantatas, or what
Wordsworth was doing ten miles above Tintern Abbey?
If we do not, we are turning, alas, into specialists. What,
then, can we do to escape this strait jacket, to broaden our
vistas, lengthen our horizons, to become, in short, educated?
Well sir, the first thing we must do is throw away our curricula.
Tomorrow, instead of going to the same old classes, let us try
something new. Let us think of college, not as a rigid discipline,
but as a kind of vast smorgasbord, -with all kinds of tempting
intellectual tidbits to sample and savor. Let us dive in. Let
our pent-up appetites roam and snatch where the)" will.

We will start tlio day with a stimulating seminar in TI it tit o
artifacts. Then we will go over to marine biology and spend a
happy hour with the mollusks. Then we will open our pores by
drilling with the K< )T(' for a spell. Then we'll go over to journal
ism and scramble a font of Bodoni. Then we'll go to the medical
school and palpate a few spleens. Then we'll go to home
economies and have lunch.
And between classes we'll smoke Marlboro Cigarettes. This,
let me emphasize, is not an added fillip to the broadening of our
education: if is an essential. To learn to live richly arid well is
an important part of education, and Marlboros are an important
part of living richly and well. Do you think flavor went out
when filters came in? Well, ha-ha, the joke is on you. Marlboro,
with its Selectrate filter, delivers flavor in full measure, flavor
without stint or compromise, flavor that wrinkled care derides,
flavor holding both its sides. This triumph of the tobacconist's
art conies to you in soft pack or flip-top box and can be lighted
with match, lighter, candle, Welsbaeh mantle, or by rubbing
two small Indians together.
When we have embarked on this new regimen—or, more ac
curately, lack of regimen- we will soon be studded with culture
like a ham with cloves. When strangers accost us on the street
and say, "What was Wordsworth doing ten miles above Tintern
Abbey?'' we will no longer slink away in silent abashment. We
will reply loud and clear:
"As any truly educated person knows, Wordsworth, Shelley,
and Keats used to go the Widdieombe Fair every year for the
poetry-writing contests and three-legged races, both of which
they enjoyed wildly. Well sir, imagine their chagrin when they
arrived at the Fair in 177(1 and learned that Oliver Cromwell,
jittery because (Juy Fawkes had just invented the spinning
jenny, had canceled all public gatherings, including the W iddi
eombe Fair and Liverpool. Shelley was so upset that he
drowned himself in the May of Naples, Keats went to London
and became Samuel .lolmson, and Wordsworth ran blindly into
the forest until he collapsed in a heap ten miles above Tintern
Abbey. There he lay for several years, sobbing and kicking his
little fat le«;s. At length, peace returned to him. lie composed
himself and, noticing for the first time the beauty of the forest
around him, he wrote Joyce Kilmer's immortal Tries . . . And
that, sinartypants, is what Wordsworth was doing ten miles
above Tintern Abbey." «r iww m»« hiiuiium

Ti) your quest for a college 'degree, are you becoming a narrow
specialist, or are you being educated in tlie broad, classical
sense of the word? This question is being asked today by many
serious people—including mv barber, my podiatrist, and my
little dog Spot—and it would be well to seek an answer.
Let us examine our souls. Are we becoming experts only in
the confined area of our majors, or does our knowledge range
far and wide? Do we, for example, know who fought in the
1 tattle of Salaniis, or Kant's epistemology, or l'lanck's constant,
or the voyage of the Jicaglc, or Palestrina's cantatas, or what
Wordsworth was doing ten miles above Tintern Abbey?
If we do not, we are turning, alas, into specialists. What,
then, can we do to escape this strait jacket, to broaden our
vistas, lengthen our horizons, to become, in short, educated?
Well sir, the first thing we must do is throw away our curricula.
Tomorrow, instead of going to the same old classes, let us try
something new. Let us think of college, not as a rigid discipline,
but as a kind of vast smorgasbord, -with all kinds of tempting
intellectual tidbits to sample and savor. Let us dive in. Let
our pent-up appetites roam and snatch where the)" will.

We will start tlio day with a stimulating seminar in TI it tit o
artifacts. Then we will go over to marine biology and spend a
happy hour with the mollusks. Then we will open our pores by
drilling with the K< )T(' for a spell. Then we'll go over to journal
ism and scramble a font of Bodoni. Then we'll go to the medical
school and palpate a few spleens. Then we'll go to home
economies and have lunch.
And between classes we'll smoke Marlboro Cigarettes. This,
let me emphasize, is not an added fillip to the broadening of our
education: if is an essential. To learn to live richly arid well is
an important part of education, and Marlboros are an important
part of living richly and well. Do you think flavor went out
when filters came in? Well, ha-ha, the joke is on you. Marlboro,
with its Selectrate filter, delivers flavor in full measure, flavor
without stint or compromise, flavor that wrinkled care derides,
flavor holding both its sides. This triumph of the tobacconist's
art conies to you in soft pack or flip-top box and can be lighted
with match, lighter, candle, Welsbaeh mantle, or by rubbing
two small Indians together.
When we have embarked on this new regimen—or, more ac
curately, lack of regimen- we will soon be studded with culture
like a ham with cloves. When strangers accost us on the street

We will start tlio day with a stimulating seminar in TI it tit o
artifacts. Then we will go over to marine biology and spend a
happy hour with the mollusks. Then we will open our pores by
drilling with the K< )T(' for a spell. Then we'll go over to journal
ism and scramble a font of Bodoni. Then we'll go to the medical
school and palpate a few spleens. Then we'll go to home
economies and have lunch.
And between classes we'll smoke Marlboro Cigarettes. This,
let me emphasize, is not an added fillip to the broadening of our
education: if is an essential. To learn to live richly arid well is
an important part of education, and Marlboros are an important
part of living richly and well. Do you think flavor went out
when filters came in? Well, ha-ha, the joke is on you. Marlboro,
with its Selectrate filter, delivers flavor in full measure, flavor
without stint or compromise, flavor that wrinkled care derides,
flavor holding both its sides. This triumph of the tobacconist's
art conies to you in soft pack or flip-top box and can be lighted
with match, lighter, candle, Welsbaeh mantle, or by rubbing
two small Indians together.
When we have embarked on this new regimen—or, more ac
curately, lack of regimen- we will soon be studded with culture
like a ham with cloves. When strangers accost us on the street
and say, "What was Wordsworth doing ten miles above Tintern
Abbey?'' we will no longer slink away in silent abashment. We
will reply loud and clear:
"As any truly educated person knows, Wordsworth, Shelley,
and Keats used to go the Widdieombe Fair every year for the
poetry-writing contests and three-legged races, both of which
they enjoyed wildly. Well sir, imagine their chagrin when they
arrived at the Fair in 177(1 and learned that Oliver Cromwell,
jittery because (Juy Fawkes had just invented the spinning
jenny, had canceled all public gatherings, including the W iddi
eombe Fair and Liverpool. Shelley was so upset that he
drowned himself in the May of Naples, Keats went to London
and became Samuel .lolmson, and Wordsworth ran blindly into
the forest until he collapsed in a heap ten miles above Tintern
Abbey. There he lay for several years, sobbing and kicking his
little fat le«;s. At length, peace returned to him. lie composed
himself and, noticing for the first time the beauty of the forest
around him, he wrote Joyce Kilmer's immortal Tries . . . And
that, sinartypants, is what Wordsworth was doing ten miles
above Tintern Abbey." «r iww m»« hiiuiium

companion ciqarette—Philip Morris.
