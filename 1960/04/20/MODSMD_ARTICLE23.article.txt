## Two Confident Optimists

"Suppose lie does run that third lap in 5(1 seconds. What kind
of last lap do you think lie can tack onto that?"
"58," said Payton Jordan.
"That's a 3:54."
"That's right," said Payton Jordan.
We may have ;i record Saturday. By a stroke of cussed luck
for us, it will be in Eugene, Oregon, about 600 miles to the north.

Since May 6, 1954, when Dr.
Roger Bannister of England ran
four times around- a quarter-mile
track in 3 minutes, 59 and l'our
tonths seconds, this world has
been in sort of a dither over the
mile run and the sport of track
in general.
Bannister's cracking of the
four-minute mile was the first
crashing of the so-called "psy
chological" barriers of track. It
was a romantic feat. When lie
met and stunningly outgutted
Australia's great John l.andy in
the British Empire (iames at Van
couver, 8.C., later in 1954, ihe
whole world was watching.
A new mile record has been
set nearly every year since then.
And the same goes for nearly
every other event in track. These
weren't just old records being
broken or eclipsed they were be
ing smashed, shattered, demol
ished, annihilated and anything
thing else the sportswriters could
call it.

The "Mile of the Century" was a sports phenomenom of the
1950'.5. Really, only the Bannister-Landy meeting at Vancouver can
be call the true Mile of the Century, but there have been at least
a half-dozen imitations. We now submit yet another, the lirst
Mile of the Century of the 19605. . . . anyway, the Collegiate Mile of
the Century: Ernie CunlilTe vs. Dyrol Burleson.
Payton Jordan, Stanford's track coach, is what you might call
a confident optimist. Ernie CunlilTe, I'ayton Jordan s prize pupil,
is also a confident optimist. Those are two pretty tough combina
tions: (1) Ernie CunlilTe and Payton Jordan, (2) confidence and
optimism.
Nobody is coming right out and saying that there will be a
mile record -set Saturday in the Oregon-Stanford dual (unless it's
a meet record, and the old one is pretty good 4:07.2 by Jim Grelle
last year). They aren't even saying there will be a four-minute
mile. But it's nice to pondei the possibilities.

Roger Bannister of England ran
four times around- a quarter-mile
track in 3 minutes, 59 and l'our
tonths seconds, this world has
been in sort of a dither over the
mile run and the sport of track
in general.
Bannister's cracking of the
four-minute mile was the first
crashing of the so-called "psy
chological" barriers of track. It
was a romantic feat. When lie
met and stunningly outgutted
Australia's great John l.andy in
the British Empire (iames at Van
couver, 8.C., later in 1954, ihe
whole world was watching.
A new mile record has been
set nearly every year since then.
And the same goes for nearly
every other event in track. These
weren't just old records being
broken or eclipsed they were be
ing smashed, shattered, demol
ished, annihilated and anything
thing else the sportswriters could
call it.

The "Mile of the Century" was a sports phenomenom of the
1950'.5. Really, only the Bannister-Landy meeting at Vancouver can
be call the true Mile of the Century, but there have been at least
a half-dozen imitations. We now submit yet another, the lirst
Mile of the Century of the 19605. . . . anyway, the Collegiate Mile of
the Century: Ernie CunlilTe vs. Dyrol Burleson.
Payton Jordan, Stanford's track coach, is what you might call
a confident optimist. Ernie CunlilTe, I'ayton Jordan s prize pupil,
is also a confident optimist. Those are two pretty tough combina
tions: (1) Ernie CunlilTe and Payton Jordan, (2) confidence and
optimism.
Nobody is coming right out and saying that there will be a
mile record -set Saturday in the Oregon-Stanford dual (unless it's
a meet record, and the old one is pretty good 4:07.2 by Jim Grelle
last year). They aren't even saying there will be a four-minute
mile. But it's nice to pondei the possibilities.

"Suppose lie does run that third lap in 5(1 seconds. What kind
of last lap do you think lie can tack onto that?"
"58," said Payton Jordan.
"That's a 3:54."
"That's right," said Payton Jordan.
We may have ;i record Saturday. By a stroke of cussed luck
for us, it will be in Eugene, Oregon, about 600 miles to the north.
