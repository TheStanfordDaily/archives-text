# Conditions Look Good
## 
### 
To dampen the subject: both these boys are going to be looking
ahead to an BSO race later in the day Saturday, or at least we pre
sume as much. And althought the psychological barrier of the four
minute mile obviously has been wiped out for Europeans and Aus
tralians, it definitely has not been wiped out for Americans.
Only one American has ever cracked four minutes. The very
fact we still talk about four-minute miles (look who's guilty) is
also evidence enough.
HOWEVER . . . The conditions are ideal. Dyrol Burleson was
acclaimed last summer America's great est-ever mile hope a young
ster i he's 19) who has never been pressed and may be in world class.
Dyrol is great. Ernie CunlilTe knows this.
Ernie CunlilTe is a remarkable case of a good runner suddenly
turned great runner the story is pretty familiar now. He is a
torrid pace-setter, and now a strong finisher as well. lOrnie is great.
Dyrol Burleson knows this.
So CunlilTe will set a torrid pace, but Burleson will be on
Ernie's shoulder, because Dyrol knows he can't let Ernie get away.
They will press each other hard. This will be a race of two run
ners who know that one or the other of them is the best miler in the
United States and that the other is second best; it will not be a
race against the clod*.
Meanwhile, the clock may be wiped out.
