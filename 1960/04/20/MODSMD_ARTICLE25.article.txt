# That's 3:54, Isn't It?
## 
### 
The candid little conversation that started off this column was
one between this writer and that old confident optimist, Payton
Jordan.
When I first posed the question to Payton about what sort
of pace Ernie might set Saturday, lie said, "Well, I think we'll have
liini run the first liall in two minutes flat, conic by the three
quarters in 2:sfi, and tin 11 see what happens."
Not being fully prepared to hear what I had just hoard, I
had to double-take and clarify the statement. "That's a 56-second
third lap, you mean," 1 said.
"That's right."
One must admit that there-would be nothing better to take the
kick out of a big kicker like Burleson than to exhaust him with a
torrid third lap, historically a "rest" lap.
I left the issue at that, deciding, yes, it would be interesting to
"see what happens."
That was -startling information. I had to go back again. Was
that off the record. Payton? "Well, we were .just chatting," he said.
(That's the way a confident optimist chats.)
"Hut," he went on, "I'm sure every coach in the nation lias had
watches 011 every 220 of Ernie's races and I doubt it this will sur
prise them." (Indeed, George Eastment, coach of last year's 800-
meter champ. Tom Murphy, has written Jordan for a complete
break-down of Conliffe's workout schedule.)
The next question had to be asked. What about the last lap?
Fifty-eight, said Mr. Jordan. That's 3:54. That's right.
The world record in the mile is 3:54.5.
The Mile of the Century?
Payton Jordan had a better one, "Suppose," he said, "that
on the 11th of June, at the Pacific AALJ championships here, we had
a special mile race with (unlitfe, Herb Elliott, lion Delany, Don
Bowden and Dyrol Burleson."
(It's a very unlikely possibility, although all five will be in
the area).
"We would draw HO,(MM) people for that alone," said the confident
opt imist.
He's probably right, too.

torrid third lap, historically a "rest" lap.
I left the issue at that, deciding, yes, it would be interesting to
"see what happens."
That was -startling information. I had to go back again. Was
that off the record. Payton? "Well, we were .just chatting," he said.
(That's the way a confident optimist chats.)
"Hut," he went on, "I'm sure every coach in the nation lias had
watches 011 every 220 of Ernie's races and I doubt it this will sur
prise them." (Indeed, George Eastment, coach of last year's 800-
meter champ. Tom Murphy, has written Jordan for a complete
break-down of Conliffe's workout schedule.)
The next question had to be asked. What about the last lap?
Fifty-eight, said Mr. Jordan. That's 3:54. That's right.
The world record in the mile is 3:54.5.
The Mile of the Century?
Payton Jordan had a better one, "Suppose," he said, "that
on the 11th of June, at the Pacific AALJ championships here, we had
a special mile race with (unlitfe, Herb Elliott, lion Delany, Don
Bowden and Dyrol Burleson."
(It's a very unlikely possibility, although all five will be in
the area).
"We would draw HO,(MM) people for that alone," said the confident
opt imist.
He's probably right, too.
The candid little conversation that started off this column was
one between this writer and that old confident optimist, Payton
Jordan.
When I first posed the question to Payton about what sort
of pace Ernie might set Saturday, lie said, "Well, I think we'll have
liini run the first liall in two minutes flat, conic by the three
quarters in 2:sfi, and tin 11 see what happens."
Not being fully prepared to hear what I had just hoard, I
had to double-take and clarify the statement. "That's a 56-second
third lap, you mean," 1 said.
"That's right."
One must admit that there-would be nothing better to take the
kick out of a big kicker like Burleson than to exhaust him with a
torrid third lap, historically a "rest" lap.
