# THREE CARDS OVER .300
## Lawrence Leads Hitters Daily Sports 
### 
Skip Lawrence, a surprising
sophomore with a big bat, cur
rently leads Stanford's varsity
baseball team in hitting with a
hefty .383 k\ 'erage. Lawrence is
joined in the exclusive ,300-plus
circle by teammates Jim Burk,
.306, and Mike Magee, .300.
The 5-10 sophomore has been a
valuable man in Coach Dutch Eeh
ring's lineup this season. He leads
the team in hits, is second in slug
ging percentage, third in RBl's,
and h;is played three different po
sitions afield for the Cards.
When Fehring decided to gi\ - e
Magee a try behind the plate,
Lawrence was called on to fill in
at second. Then he was shifted
to short and now patrols right
field.
Bulk, who set a hot pace for
CIBA hitters early in the season,
has now cooled off a bit but is

still going at a .306 clip. The Card
third baseman is second in RBl's
with 13 and has a fine slugging
percentage of .500.
John Ilurlhut is the team's
leading long-ball hitter with a
slugging percentage of .533. He
also tops the club in runs batted
in with 15.
The Indians have been victims
of several close losses and are one
game over 500 at 11-10. They have
out scored the opposition 120-84, a
surprising margin in view of the
record.
Pitching presents a much
brighter picture as the Indian
mound corps has compiled a nifty
2.77 ERA. Lefthander Terry Lin
deman boasts the best record on
the staff with a spotless 3-0 mark.
The outstanding junior has struck
out 11 hitters in just 33 innings.
Jim Smith boasts the best ERA
on the staff, but has been the vic
tim of poor support and has a 2-3
seasonal record. A sophomoYe in
his first year of college ball,
Smith has held opposing teams
to an average of 1.40 runs per
game.
Lefty Marv Mecklenberg has
been"the workhorse of the Stan
ford staff, having pitched 63 inn

ings. Ho has a 5-1 record and a
respectable 2.57 ERA.
? Stanford is now fourth in
the CIBA standings with a 1-5
league mark. They have a chance
to improve on that this weekend
I when they host the two power
houses from the South USC and
UCLA.
Stanford hosts UCLA on the
(Sunken Diamond Friday at 3:15
p.m. Saturday they face a double
| header with powerful Southern
