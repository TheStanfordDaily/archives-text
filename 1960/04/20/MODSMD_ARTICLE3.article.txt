# NEHRU TOUCH
## India Gives Chou Cold Reception 
### 
NEW DELHI, India (/P) Red
China's Premier Chou En-Lai.
looking glum and stolid, arrived
yesterday for talks on the bitter
boundary dispute with India. He
was promptly told by Prime Min
ister Nehru that India's relations
with Communist China "have
been imperiled for the present
and future."
This declaration, voiced shortly
after Chou stepped from an Indi
an air force plane, set the tone
for one of the toughest speeches
Nehru has ever made to a visit
ing dignitary.
The usually affable Nehru wore
a tight smile.
Great Strain
"When Your Excellency came
here three years ago as the rep
resentative of a great people con
veying your greetings and good
wishes to our people, we recipro
cated in full," he told Chou.
"Unfortunately, other events
have taken place since then which
have put a great strain on this
bond of friendship and which have
given a shock to all our people."
Prepared Speech
Nehru left no doubts that the
"events" were last year's border
clashes with Chinese soldiers. A
dozen Indians were killed as Pei
ping enforced its claim to 41.000
square miles of mountain terri
tory.
Nehru's strong words, and the
unusually chilly reception, had
Chou grim-faced. But the Commu
nist leader read off a prepared
speech voicing friendship for In
dia and hopes for settling the bor
der crisis.
On his three-nation tour, Chou
has been trying to rebuild Red
China's image as a peaceful neigh
bor. This was shattered by Com
munist suppression of last year's
revolt in Tibet.
But his smiling demeanor in
Burma, where he even got into
holiday water fights with festive
Burmese last week, was in
marked contrast to the way he
looked here.
Chou's seven-day visit is strong
ly opposed by all opposition
parties but the Communists.
