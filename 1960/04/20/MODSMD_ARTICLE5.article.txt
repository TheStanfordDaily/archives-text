# 19 de Abril
## 
### 
An anonymous candidate for a class business manager was caught
by our Daily camerman yesterday afternoon robbing the Encina
cashier's office. A member of the 19 de abril movement told a
Daily reporter that the rebels were pulling the raid to gain
more money to fill the coffers of a new class treasury with mucho
dinero. Later, the rebels were seen by various students parading
their booty through the main library. They finally staged a victory
ceremony at engineering 1 corner in which they burned their 19
de abril armbands.
