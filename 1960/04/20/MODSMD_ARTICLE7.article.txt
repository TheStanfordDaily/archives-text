# Students Decry Segregation
## 
### 
A small group of white Stan
ford students demonstrated in
front of Woolworth stores in Palo
Alto and the Stanford Shopping
Center yesterday in protest of
lunch counter segregation policies
in the South.
The students displayed signs

reading, "We are Stanford stu
dents. We demonstrate in sup
port of southern student move
ments."
Three Stanford seniors were
stationed in front of the Wool
worth store on University Ave
nue. They are Stephen Anderson

of Arlington Heights, 111.; Eliza
beth Wright of San Marino, and
Roger Zimmerman of Harvel, 111.
About 25 students are partici
pating in the campaign, but the
group is looking for new mem
bers, Zimmerman explained.
No Sponsor
The protest is not sponsored by
any campus organization but is
being conducted entirely by the
individual students.
Besides the pickets, the stu
dents have financed the printing
of anti-segregation literature.
This material asks such questions
as, "Why have racial minority
groups not been able to buy prop
erty with ease outside of East
Palo Alto?"
Further pinning down the pro
test to the local scene, the litera
ture asks, "Why are there so few
minority g ro up vv bite collar
workers in the Midpeninsula?"
and "Should a university actively
oppose social injustice in the com
munities surrounding it?"
Possible University Policy
The literature proposes as pos
sible examples of university ac
tivity the adoption of non discrim
inatory clauses in the leasing of
university land:
The material also urges that
persons write to the national
chains stores in protest to their
segregation policies and write to
students in jail for participating
in lunch counter demonstrations.
Names and addresses are includ
ed.
A meeting of the persons in
terested in joining the local de
segregation movement will be
held at 4:15 tomorrow on the
third floor of the Women's Club
house,

STANFORD STI lIKNTS IN SIKiKKt;ATION I'KOTHKT
Senior's SU'phon Anderson, U'i'l, and Hoger Zimmerman show sign
A small group of white Stan
ford students demonstrated in
front of Woolworth stores in Palo
Alto and the Stanford Shopping
Center yesterday in protest of
lunch counter segregation policies
in the South.
The students displayed signs

reading, "We are Stanford stu
dents. We demonstrate in sup
port of southern student move
ments."
Three Stanford seniors were
stationed in front of the Wool
worth store on University Ave
nue. They are Stephen Anderson

of Arlington Heights, 111.; Eliza
beth Wright of San Marino, and
Roger Zimmerman of Harvel, 111.
About 25 students are partici
pating in the campaign, but the
group is looking for new mem
bers, Zimmerman explained.
No Sponsor
The protest is not sponsored by
any campus organization but is
being conducted entirely by the
individual students.
Besides the pickets, the stu
dents have financed the printing
of anti-segregation literature.
This material asks such questions
as, "Why have racial minority
groups not been able to buy prop
erty with ease outside of East
Palo Alto?"
Further pinning down the pro
test to the local scene, the litera
ture asks, "Why are there so few
minority g ro up vv bite collar
workers in the Midpeninsula?"
and "Should a university actively
oppose social injustice in the com
munities surrounding it?"
Possible University Policy
The literature proposes as pos
sible examples of university ac
tivity the adoption of non discrim
inatory clauses in the leasing of
university land:
The material also urges that
persons write to the national
chains stores in protest to their
segregation policies and write to
students in jail for participating
in lunch counter demonstrations.
Names and addresses are includ
ed.
A meeting of the persons in
terested in joining the local de
segregation movement will be
held at 4:15 tomorrow on the
third floor of the Women's Club
house,
