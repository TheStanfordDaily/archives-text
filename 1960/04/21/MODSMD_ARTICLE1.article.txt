## Venezuelan Rebellion Suppressed 
### 
CARACAS, Venezuela (/P)
Backed firmly by Venezuela's po
litical, labor and military leaders,
the government of President Ro
mulo Betancourt moved swiftly
yesterday to crush a rebellion
near the Colombian border. Popu
lar demonstrations cheered the
President's actions and jeered at
the rebellion.
The rebels were led by a dis
gruntled Venezuelan general.
They crossed the border from Co
lombia. seized the mountain city
of San Cristobal and tried to start
a nationwide revolution. They
failed.
How they managed to organize
in Colombia, a friendly neigh
bor to the west, was not clear, but
the mountain areas provided ex
cellent cover.
The government sent planes
and soldiers against insurgent
positions and said the rebels
were quickly bottled up.
Street Fighting'
The Interior Ministry said there
was street fighting in San Cristo
bal but the government expected
all rebel activity to be snuffed out
within hours.
A tank column supported by
howitzers and infantrymen was
said to be advancing toward San
Cristobal for what was described
as a final attack on the last iebel
stronghold.
The government announced
that 300 rebels went over to the
loyal side as soon as they made
contact.
Interior Minister Luis Augusto
Dubuc said the street fighting in
the city was between rebels try
ing to enforce martial law and
civilian groups backing the gov
ernment.
One report said Gov. Ceferino
Medina was leading the civil re
sistance.
Dubuc said rebel forces had lost
an undisclosed number of men.
Massive Support
Leaders of the country's biggest
political, labor and military
groups demonstrated massive
support for the moderately leftist
government of Betancourt.
Labor leaders called for a strike
in all industries as a sort of holi
day demonstration of support for
the government. The call appar
ently was heeded. Airports were
reported closed in response to the
strike orders, halting domestic
and overseas civilian flights.
The Farm Workers Federation
ordered its 1,700,000 members to
prepare for action to support
Bet a nco urt's reg i me.
Combined moves by soldiers
and farmers recaptured La Fria
Airport near the Colombia bor
der and military planes began
landing soldiers there, the gov
ernment said.-The soldiers began
moving to surround rebels still
holding out in the area, an an
nouncement added.
No Casualties
The government said loyal
troops had suffered no casualties
in any of the military operations.
Betancourt told the nation that
if the rebels refused to surrender
shortly he would put down "this
criminal adventure without hesi
tation." He declared the govern
ment was sure to win.
Foreign Minister Luis Arcaya
charged the insurgents were
backed by Generalissimo Rafael
L. Trujillo. dictator of the Domin
ican Republican and an old foe of
Betancourt. Officials have often
linked him with antigovernment
plots here.
"The hands of Trujillo are vis-'
ible in this," said Arcaya. "Vene
zuela will take energetic and cate
gorical decisions against this mon
ster of the Caribbean."
