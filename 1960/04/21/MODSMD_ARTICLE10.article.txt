# Rhee Cabinet Out In Wake of Revolt
## 
### 
SEOUL (/P) The Soulh Korean Cabinet resigned last night in the face of civilian rebellion at
home and a rebuke to the Rhee regime from the United States for harsh suppression of democratic
rights.
President Syngman Rhee, still the strongman at age 85. remained in office.
The opposition quickly reacted to the Cabinet's departure, saying this was not convincing evid-

ence of reform.
The resignation of the 12man
Cabinet came in the wake of
bloody antigovernment violence
that has shaken the country and
brought martial law.
The Cabinet resignation was
viewed as a possible attempt to
have Rhee's ministers accept the
blame for the harsh military
measures used to suppress civil
ian demonstrations protesting the
conduct of the March election.
Won't Appease
Unless accompanied by a firm
promise of reforms, the Cabinet
resignation was not expected to
appease Koreans who turned out
by thousands Tuesday to demon
state against the government and
demand new elections.
Police gunfire cut down nearly
1,000 persons. The latest official
casualty count said 115 were
killed, 777 were injured and 1 is
missing.
Vice President John Chang, a
member of the Democratic party
in opposition to Rhee's Liberal
party, was quick to declare the
Cabinet resignation "cannot be a
basic factor in dealing with the
tuibulent situation — only a fair
election can be."
City Recovering
Seoul was like a city recover
ing from battle yesterday. Many
hundreds of wounded lay in hos
pitals, victims of riots sparked by
about 30,000 students and citizens
Tuesday when they demonstrated
against the government. The riots
climaxed weeks of unrest and
demonstrations protesting the
elections in which Rhee's running
mate swamped the opposition
Democratic candidate for vice
president. The opposition claims
Rhee's Liberal party rigged the
election and used harsh pressures
to insure the success of the Lib
eral vice presidential nominee.
At Kwangju, one of the troubled
towns under martial law, police
and soldiers fired blank cartridges
to disperse a crowd of college
students and high school boys try
ing to revive the demonstrations.
Outbreaks in the olher martial
law cities, Chonju, Inchon and
Taegu, were put down with simi
lar dispatch.

President Eisenhower was kept
posted on events in Korea. He is
leaving official actions and state
ments to Secretary of State Chris
tian A. Herter, who sharply told
the Korean government Tuesday
that the uprisings reflected "pop
ular dissatisfaction over the con
duct of the recent election." Sug
gestions were raised in Washing
ton that President Eisenhower
should cancel his scheduled visit
to Korea to underscore Washing
tons' annoyance.
President Rhee issued a state
ment to the Korean press. Liter
ally translated it went this way:
Once civil government is restored,
those who have committed wrong
shall be punished, and if they are
the major causes of discontent
they will all be corrected. An of
ficial English version of this
statement put it this way: "Those
who are guilty can be assured of
punishment. Those with major
grievances can be certain of re
dress."

grievances can be certain of re
dress."
SEOUL (/P) The Soulh Korean Cabinet resigned last night in the face of civilian rebellion at
home and a rebuke to the Rhee regime from the United States for harsh suppression of democratic
rights.
President Syngman Rhee, still the strongman at age 85. remained in office.
The opposition quickly reacted to the Cabinet's departure, saying this was not convincing evid-

ence of reform.
The resignation of the 12man
Cabinet came in the wake of
bloody antigovernment violence
that has shaken the country and
brought martial law.
The Cabinet resignation was
viewed as a possible attempt to
have Rhee's ministers accept the
blame for the harsh military
measures used to suppress civil
ian demonstrations protesting the
conduct of the March election.
Won't Appease
Unless accompanied by a firm
promise of reforms, the Cabinet
resignation was not expected to
appease Koreans who turned out
by thousands Tuesday to demon
state against the government and
demand new elections.
Police gunfire cut down nearly
1,000 persons. The latest official
casualty count said 115 were
killed, 777 were injured and 1 is
missing.
Vice President John Chang, a
member of the Democratic party
in opposition to Rhee's Liberal
party, was quick to declare the
Cabinet resignation "cannot be a
basic factor in dealing with the
tuibulent situation — only a fair
election can be."
City Recovering
Seoul was like a city recover
ing from battle yesterday. Many
hundreds of wounded lay in hos
pitals, victims of riots sparked by
about 30,000 students and citizens
Tuesday when they demonstrated
against the government. The riots
climaxed weeks of unrest and
demonstrations protesting the
elections in which Rhee's running
mate swamped the opposition
Democratic candidate for vice
president. The opposition claims
Rhee's Liberal party rigged the
election and used harsh pressures
to insure the success of the Lib
eral vice presidential nominee.
At Kwangju, one of the troubled
towns under martial law, police
and soldiers fired blank cartridges
to disperse a crowd of college
students and high school boys try
ing to revive the demonstrations.
Outbreaks in the olher martial
law cities, Chonju, Inchon and
Taegu, were put down with simi
lar dispatch.

President Eisenhower was kept
posted on events in Korea. He is
leaving official actions and state
ments to Secretary of State Chris
tian A. Herter, who sharply told
the Korean government Tuesday
that the uprisings reflected "pop
ular dissatisfaction over the con
duct of the recent election." Sug
gestions were raised in Washing
ton that President Eisenhower
should cancel his scheduled visit
to Korea to underscore Washing
tons' annoyance.
President Rhee issued a state
ment to the Korean press. Liter
ally translated it went this way:
Once civil government is restored,
those who have committed wrong
shall be punished, and if they are
the major causes of discontent
they will all be corrected. An of
ficial English version of this
statement put it this way: "Those
who are guilty can be assured of
punishment. Those with major
grievances can be certain of re
dress."
