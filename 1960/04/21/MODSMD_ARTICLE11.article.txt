# WARREN FOUND IN AFRICA
## ‘Dr. Wonka, I Presume’ 
### 
From ledendary Timbuctu in the heart of Af
rica comes word of the discovery by three Stan
ford students of the whereabouts of Professor
W. G. Wonka, Stanford's globetrotting person
ality.
Following is the text of an airmail postcard
mailed sometime this year from Timbuktu in the
French Sudan, and which reached the Daily Shack
this week:
"Sir( s)
"We inform you, with restrained pride, of our
rediscovery of the long vanished Prof. ,W. G.
Wonka. Dr. Wonka's sensational campus disap
pearance, following last year's Big Game 'Moral
Victory* had caused considerable concern among
the expatriots of the Stanford Red.
"ll was rumored that the venerable doctor had
decided to devote the remainder of his life to mis
sionary work among the Hottentots of Timbuctoo.
To trace this rumor, a 'Stanford-on-Safari' pro
gram was organized, based on the continued suc
cess of the Stanford in Stuttgart programs of pre
vious years.
"The steering committee of 'Stanford-on-Safari,'
3 serious sou led Stanford students now studying
at Berlin, tiaveled Ith class ship to West Africa,
by train, truck and mammy wagon into the in
terior, and up the Niger River via African Pi
roque.
"Upon entering Timbuctoo, we were directed
immediately lo 'Great White Father' (.Dr. Wonka;

busily engaged in his spiritual and healing work
among the population.
" 'Dr. Wonka, we presume,' we inquired for
mally, as befitted I ho dignity of the occasion.
" 'Big Red,' he cried emotionally. 'God it's good
to see another Red Man.'
"II was touching.
"Photographic records of the reunion, and
proofs of its authenticity will be provided to The
Daily within 2 months.
"Respectfully: Steering Committee, 'Stanford
on Snfari' Jeff A. Fadiman, George A. Chester,
Miss Andree L. Whitney."
The card apparently was posted from Timbuctu
at least Ihe French stamps, printing, battered
condition, postmark and picture on the front show
ing an African ciiy smack in the middle of the
Sahara indicate so.
Should photos of Wonka who is the equivalent
of Stanford's "Kilroy" actually show the elusive
Warren, it would be the first time in the Univer
sity's history anyone has actually seen him, even
1 hough he has enrolled in classes, taken finals
and made the graduation program several times.
Wonka popped up at the Daily Shack recently
when a card was received enrolling "Warren G,
Wonka" as a member of the "Nixon in '60" club.
W. G. \4 r . also entered the picture in the 1956 presi
dential race when someone on campus received a
letter, signed by Sen. Estes Kefauver, gratefully
acknowledging Warren's support.
