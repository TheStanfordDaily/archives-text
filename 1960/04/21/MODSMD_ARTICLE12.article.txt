## More Jailed As Negroes' Strike Fails 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Afri
ca </P) â€” Police and soldiers
backed by armored cars arrested
TOO Negroes yesterday in raids on
native settlements outside major
cities on South Africa's cape pen
insula. More than a thousand have
been seized in the last 48 hours.
The raids are part of the drive
to squelch an abortive strike
called by the outlawed African
National Congress protesting the
government's strict apartheid
laws.
Failure of the strike brought
demands from liberal white
groups for an end to emergency
regulations permitting raids on
Negro settlements without search
warrants and detention of hun
dreds in jail indefinitely.
Will Reconsider
Lands Minister Paul Sauer, act
ing government head, said Tues
day South Africa would "recon
sider in earnest and honesty her
whole approach to the native
question."
But in a statement to Parlia
ment yesterday Foreign Minis
ter Eric Louw rejected any basic
changes in government policy, in
cluding racial segregation. He al
so turned down suggestions for a
coalition government with the op
position United party which pro
posed easing the Negroes' lot.
If there is any change, Louw
said. Prime Minister Hcndrik V.
Verwoerd will make it. Ver
woerd, recovering from two bul
let wounds inflicted by a white
assassin April 9, probably will be
well enough to take full charge
of the government within a week,
"even though he might have to do
so from his bedroom," Louw de
clared.
No Departure
Louw also said the govern
ment's announced decision to dis
cuss its racial problems with U.N.
Secretary-General Dag Hammar
skjold in London next month did
not herald a departure from the
government's viewpoint that
there should be no interference in
the domestic affairs of member
states of the U.N.
The talks stem from the April
1 U.N. Secruity Council resolu
tion asking South Africa to end
racial segregation.
The rest of South Africa re
mained quiet yesterday. No one
seemed sure whether more vio
lence was in the offing.
