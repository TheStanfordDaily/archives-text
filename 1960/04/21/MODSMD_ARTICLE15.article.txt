The United States has taken another step toward gaining more
friends in the world hv sternly rebuking South Korea for repress
ing the eurrent anti-governmenl demonstrations, and for killing:
150 people.
This government, headed hv the aneienl Syngman Rhee, is
one of tiie most hypoeritieal and suppressive dietatorships of eur
rent limes. It is regarded by many in the United States as a great
friend of America; however, Rhee still feels deep resentment
against this country for not procuring the entire Korean penin
sula for him in 19.13.
Hliee won his fourth term as president in the March national
election, but his opponent had died shortlv before the election,
leaving him unopposed. A similar occurrence strangelv happened
before the 1956 election: however, over one million people voted
for R lice's dead adversary on a write-in ballot.
In order to assure the victory of his running male in the March
vice presidential contest, Rhee used police strong arm methods to
disperse rallies for the opposing candidate and to prevent hostile
voters from going to the polls. He ufco used public funds and
facilities to further his candidate's campaign.
The United States' policy of supporting "friend Iv" dictators
provides unlimited propaganda for the Russians and explains in
part the reticence of neutral countries to join the Western bloc.
We must recognize the hvpocrisy of men like Rhee and be will
ing to support the efforts of oppressed peoples such as the South
Koreans or South Africans to establish a democratic svstem. The
State Department's note was a commendable action. Another one,
we suggest, would he the cancellation of (.'resident Eisenhower's
June 22 visit to South Korea.
