## On Other Campi 
### 
In recent weeks, Stanford stu
donts have been blessed, or cursed
if you like, to hear two Presi
dential candidates, Messrs. Ken
nedy and Nixon, discuss their
views. At some other universities
however, editorials have been con
cerned with a couple of politicians
who apparently will not be run
ning for the top spot.
One of those politicians is Mr.
Rockefeller. The Louisiana State
Daily Reveille said. "When Rocke
feller bowed out of the race for
the Republican nomination ob
servers conceded that Nixon had
the nomination in the bag.
"Admittedly, 1{ o c k e 112 e 11 e r
would have been hard put to
defeat the vice president, who
has the support of almost every
big nun in the party. Thus the
Kepuhlican nomination becomes
merely a formality. But a eut
and-dried convention rarely pro
duces any new ideas."
The editorial goes on to state
that the Republican campaign will
be a conservative one, playing up
the old theme of "peace and
prosperity" which apparently only
the Republicans can provide.
Rockefeller, the editorial says,
is a man who doesn't pull punches.
"It takes a man like Rockefeller
to admit that the trouble with
farmers is that there's just too
many of them.
"And rare is the Republican
who will stake his prestige and
career in a bitter fight for higher
taxes. But last year in his own
state Rockefeller did just that.
He got his taxes and came out
stronger than ever.
"The candidate who has a
real program these days is re
garded with something ap
proaching suspicion. It's depress
ing to think that there's no
more room at the top for the

Rockefellers and new ideas,"
the editorial concludes.
The Daily Orange, Syracuse
University's newspaper, took a
look at Adlai Stevenson and the
reasons why lie is not a candi
date.
". . . Stevenson said just before
leaving for his Latin American
trip: 'At no time have I ever said
I wouldn't accept the nomination,
but I just don't think it is going
to be offered to me.'
"This pessimism is the reason
for the lack-lustre of the move
ment for Stevenson, according to
Godfrey Sperling Jr. of the Chris
tian Science Monitor, but Sperling
says, 'This man Stevenson is run
ning, in his way.' "
The Orange points out that
Stevenson's lack of confidence
is understandable for a man
who has been defeated twice.
Besides, Stevenson is a sensitive
person. As he said after one of
his losses, quoting Abraham
Lincoln, "It hurts too much to
laugh, but I'm too old to cry."
"The tragic part of this is."
states the Orange editorial, "that
for the past eight years, and prob
ably for the future, the United
States is losing the leadership of
Stevenson's wisdom and wisdom
is a term we could apply to too
few of either party today.
"Madison Avenue, the Big Smile
and just plain hero worship beat
Stevenson in 1H52 and 1056. The
political facts of life seem to
count him out for 1960, unless
there is a convention deadlock
and the behind-the-scenes work of
Stevenson's backers proves solid."
The editorial concludes by
stating that "we missed the
boat eight years ago, and just
what has happened to the U.S.
position in the Cold War. Are
we going to miss it again?"

we going to miss it again?"
In recent weeks, Stanford stu
donts have been blessed, or cursed
if you like, to hear two Presi
dential candidates, Messrs. Ken
nedy and Nixon, discuss their
views. At some other universities
however, editorials have been con
cerned with a couple of politicians
who apparently will not be run
ning for the top spot.
One of those politicians is Mr.
Rockefeller. The Louisiana State
Daily Reveille said. "When Rocke
feller bowed out of the race for
the Republican nomination ob
servers conceded that Nixon had
the nomination in the bag.
"Admittedly, 1{ o c k e 112 e 11 e r
would have been hard put to
defeat the vice president, who
has the support of almost every
big nun in the party. Thus the
Kepuhlican nomination becomes
merely a formality. But a eut
and-dried convention rarely pro
duces any new ideas."
The editorial goes on to state
that the Republican campaign will
be a conservative one, playing up
the old theme of "peace and
prosperity" which apparently only
the Republicans can provide.
Rockefeller, the editorial says,
is a man who doesn't pull punches.
"It takes a man like Rockefeller
to admit that the trouble with
farmers is that there's just too
many of them.
"And rare is the Republican
who will stake his prestige and
career in a bitter fight for higher
taxes. But last year in his own
state Rockefeller did just that.
He got his taxes and came out
stronger than ever.
"The candidate who has a
real program these days is re
garded with something ap
proaching suspicion. It's depress
ing to think that there's no
more room at the top for the

Rockefellers and new ideas,"
the editorial concludes.
The Daily Orange, Syracuse
University's newspaper, took a
look at Adlai Stevenson and the
reasons why lie is not a candi
date.
". . . Stevenson said just before
leaving for his Latin American
trip: 'At no time have I ever said
I wouldn't accept the nomination,
but I just don't think it is going
to be offered to me.'
"This pessimism is the reason
for the lack-lustre of the move
ment for Stevenson, according to
Godfrey Sperling Jr. of the Chris
tian Science Monitor, but Sperling
says, 'This man Stevenson is run
ning, in his way.' "
The Orange points out that
Stevenson's lack of confidence
is understandable for a man
who has been defeated twice.
Besides, Stevenson is a sensitive
person. As he said after one of
his losses, quoting Abraham
Lincoln, "It hurts too much to
laugh, but I'm too old to cry."
"The tragic part of this is."
states the Orange editorial, "that
for the past eight years, and prob
ably for the future, the United
States is losing the leadership of
Stevenson's wisdom and wisdom
is a term we could apply to too
few of either party today.
"Madison Avenue, the Big Smile
and just plain hero worship beat
Stevenson in 1H52 and 1056. The
political facts of life seem to
count him out for 1960, unless
there is a convention deadlock
and the behind-the-scenes work of
Stevenson's backers proves solid."
The editorial concludes by
stating that "we missed the
boat eight years ago, and just
what has happened to the U.S.
position in the Cold War. Are
we going to miss it again?"
