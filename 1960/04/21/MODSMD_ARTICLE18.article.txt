## 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
Editor's Note: This is flu* first
in a series of articles on the sit
in strike demonstrations hy
Southern students in protest to
segregation.

Since Feb. 2 of this year nearly
1,000 students have been arrested
and either undergone trial or are
awaiting trial for their nonvio
lent participation in sit-in strikes
in the South.
The demonstrations have been
conducted by both Negro and
white students at lunch counters,
public libraries and churches
where social customs have pro
hibited Negroes to sit.
The most serious incident oc
curred in Nashville, where about
80 students from Fisk University,
Tennessee Agricultural and In
dustrial University and American
Baptist Theological Seminary
were arrested on charges of dis
orderly conduct.
Recharged
Later new charges of conspir
acy to violate Tennessee's trade
and commerce laws were filed
against them, and James Lawson,
Methodist minister and Vander
bilt University divinity school stu
dent, who was not directly in
volved or charged before, was ar
rested. He was also asked to with
draw from the university. Special
funds have been started by vari
ous organizations for his legal
aid .
In Atlanta, over 500 students
were arrested, and at Southern
University in Baton Rouge, 16.stu
dents were suspended because of
their arrests in sit-ins. Two thou
sand students withdrew from
school in protest.
Governor John Patterson of Al
abama forced the expulsion of
nine students from Alabama State
College because of their participa
tion in sit-ins, causing over half
of the student body to refuse to
register for spring quarter in pro
test.
The students have been faced
with violence of mobs of citizens,
as well as by savage newspaper
commentary. In some cases hail
has been set as high as $1,500,
fines at $1,000 and jail sentences
at one year.
Non-Violent Techniques
The demonstrators have ob
served a rigorous self-discipline
in the techniques of non-violent
resistance. Their instructions:
"Don't strike back or curse
back if abused.
"Don't laugh out.
"'Don't hold conversations with
floor workers.
"Don't leave your seats until
your leader has given you instruc
tion's to do so.
"Don't block entrances to Ihe
stores and aisles.
"Show yourself friendly and
courteous at all times.
"Sit straight and always face
the counter.
"Report all serious incidents to
your leader.
"Ref°r all information to your
leader in a polite manner.
"Remember the teachings of
Jesus Christ, Mohandas K. Gand
hi and Martin Luther King.
"Remember love and non-vio
lence, may God bless each of you."
When violence has resulted,

! with rare exception it has not;
been perpetrated by any of those
engaged in the demonstration
itself.
Effective
Negro leaders feel that the dem
onstrations have been effective:
the moral issues are clearer, Ne
groes are able to protest to thei
white community, they are united
I in their action and feeling.
There is mature and disciplined
leadership, and an awareness of
I economic and political power is
growing in both the Negro and
: the white population.
What started in Greensboro,
N.C., at North Carolina A. and T.
College at the beginning of Feb
ruary has grown to include!
schools in Virginia, Tennessee, j
Maryland, Alabama. Arkansas,
I Florida, South Carolina, Loui«i-|
| ana, Texas and Georgia in act ive
non-violent protest.
And sympathy on northern
campuses is tremendous. At Yale,
Challenge inspired visiting stu
dents to organize rallies on their
; own campuses. Sixteen faculty |
members and 300 students of the
i Yale Divinity School had a sign-:
I carrying demonstration.
Three hundred students at Occi-;
I dental College ate dinner stand- :
! ing up in protest to the explusion
I of Negro students from Alabama
State College.
Organize EPIC
In Boston, students from Har
vard, M.I.T. and Brandeis helped
form an organization called EPIC
( (Emergency Public Integration
Committee), picketed chain stores ;
that practice segregation in the
South and engaged Harry Bela
| fonte to kick off a fund-raising
| drive at Boston Arena.
The student government of the
University of Michigan wrote let
ters of protest to Southern gover
nors.
At Wesleyan in Connecticut stu
dents collected $100 and Oberlin
collected $2,709.10.
A white professor of sociology
and ten white students from Mac-
Murray College in Illinois went
to Montgomery and were arrested
for eating with Negro students in
a Negro restaurant.
I At Wayne State University in
Detroit petitions were signed by
800 students expressing support
for the Southern movement.
Students at Hunter College in
New York City have been stand
ing up to eat lunch to show their
sympathy.
$10,000 Donated
New York's Taconic Foundat ion
has donated $10,000 for an Na
tional Student Association nation

! wide conference in Washington,
D.C., this weekend.
The last two days Stanford stu
dents have been picketing Wool
worth stores in Palo Alto and the
Stanford Shopping Center and
distributing this statement:
. . We in other sections of
| the United States would bo ex
tremely naive if we failed to take
this movement seriously. There is
i every indication that such activi
ties will continue until the minor
ity groups in the South obtain
I the justice and equality they de
i sire. We should be reminded of
| our own responsibilities ... to
| work unceasingly toward the
i establishment of j us t i c e a n d
! equality of opportunity and to
j ward the bringing of oneness and
; love throughout the world. . . ."
Tuesday also marked the first
day of a Stanford drive to raise
funds for the legal defense of the
arrested students. The money will
be sent to the Martin Luther King
fund, the National Christian Lead
| ership Council in Nashville.
