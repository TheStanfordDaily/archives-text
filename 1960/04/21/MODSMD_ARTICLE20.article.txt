Sit-in Strikes
Editor, the Daily:
We share with those participat
ing in the recent sit-in demonstra
tions in the South the conviction
that social justice and racial
equality are imperative for our
time. We feel a concern for those
students who have been arrested
as a result of their participation
in these protests. We believe that
we at Stanford, as students, have
the obligation, not only to inform
ourselves as to what has been
and is happening in the South,
but also to act upon our convic
tions in light of this information.
Therefore, we wish to commend
the initiative taken in the collec
tion of funds for the legal defense
of those students now facing trial
for their participation in the dem
onstrations. We support the con
tinuation of this effort.
