Charles Mohr is provoking: widespread discussion about college
boxing. On Tuesday Huss Allen reported on the future status of
boxing at Stanford. Today Ron Rapoport examines the events
leading: up to Mohr's fatal fight and the bout itself.)
Last year Charles Mohr was one of the best collegiate boxers
in the country. He didn't lose a light and won the NCAA 165
pound championship. He was voted the best fighter in the NCAA
tournament. *
Big things were expected of Mohr this year. He was elected
co-captain of the Wisconsin team and was figured to have an ex

cedent chance to defend success
fully his NCAA crown. But some
how. he just wasn't the same
fighter.
Molir seemed to lack the poise
that he had once had in the ring.
Ilis confidence in himself, con
sidered one of his main strong
points, almost disappeared. His
coach remarked that he had lost
his fire and was worried about
what seemed to be a definite
mental letdown. The coaches of
most of the teams that Wisconsin
faced his year noticed that he
just didn't look as good in the
ring as he used to.
Mohr underwent psychiatric
treatment earlier this year before
he was allowed to fight. It was
also found that his blood vessels
were more than usually suscepti
ble to the kind of injury that
killed him. It was not considered
serious enough, however, to keep
him from fighting.
On April 9, Charlie 31 oh r
climbed into the ring at Madison,

Wis., to defend his 165 pound championship against San Jose's Stu
Kartell. His two sisters were in the crowd. San Jose boxing coach
Julie Menendez, who was at ringside, describes the fight:
'He Didn't Fake a Beating'
"Charlie didn't take a beating, there's 110 question about it.
In the first round our boy didn't even lay a glove on him. Half
way through the second round Stu hit him with a right to the
head and lie went down on the seat of his pants.
"He took a count of eight and got up and the referee brushed off
his gloves. Stu tied hint up at the ropes and hit him three or four
times. It was obvious that he couldn't defend himself and the ref
called the fight.
"It's funny, actually, there were over 10,000 people watching the
fight and most of them thought that it was stopped too soon."
Mohr walked out of the ring by himself and collapsed in the
dressing room 10 minutes later. He was immediately operated on in
the University hospital. The surgery took three hours and was
described as "extremely difficult," Mohr had suffered what is called
a diffuse injury in which the blood vessels could not be tied to stop
the bleeding. Ho was given little chance to live. Eight days later,
on Easter Sunday morning, Charlie Mohr died.
'Doirt Worry About a Thing'
Mohr's father said that ho did not blame Kartell or boxing for
his son's death. He said that Charlie had always loved the sport
and needed it to reinforce his confidence in himself. In a letter to
Kartell, Mohr's father said:
"Don't worry about a thing. It isn't your fault and sometimes
things happen this way."
The University of Wisconsin athletic board is to review the status
of boxing in the athletic program and the board of regents will do
likewise. Nearly everybody in Wisconsin has picked a side. Some
are agitating to abolish boxing in the school.
Others say that the sport should not he condemned on the
basis of one injury. They say that this is only the second death in col
legiate boxing in 27 years and that the advantages of the sport:
outweigh the disadvantages.
As Menendez says, "If the boys don't Ih>\ in school, they'll box
somewhere else; in AAU competition or in the Golden Gloves. We
can keep the sport under tight supervision in college and keep in
juries down to a minimum, while allowing all the advantages that
the sport has to offer."

Charles Mohr is provoking: widespread discussion about college
boxing. On Tuesday Huss Allen reported on the future status of
boxing at Stanford. Today Ron Rapoport examines the events
leading: up to Mohr's fatal fight and the bout itself.)
Last year Charles Mohr was one of the best collegiate boxers
in the country. He didn't lose a light and won the NCAA 165
pound championship. He was voted the best fighter in the NCAA
tournament. *
Big things were expected of Mohr this year. He was elected
co-captain of the Wisconsin team and was figured to have an ex

cedent chance to defend success
fully his NCAA crown. But some
how. he just wasn't the same
fighter.
Molir seemed to lack the poise
that he had once had in the ring.
Ilis confidence in himself, con
sidered one of his main strong
points, almost disappeared. His
coach remarked that he had lost
his fire and was worried about
what seemed to be a definite
mental letdown. The coaches of
most of the teams that Wisconsin
faced his year noticed that he
just didn't look as good in the
ring as he used to.
Mohr underwent psychiatric
treatment earlier this year before
he was allowed to fight. It was
also found that his blood vessels
were more than usually suscepti
ble to the kind of injury that
killed him. It was not considered
serious enough, however, to keep
him from fighting.
On April 9, Charlie 31 oh r
climbed into the ring at Madison,

Wis., to defend his 165 pound championship against San Jose's Stu
Kartell. His two sisters were in the crowd. San Jose boxing coach
Julie Menendez, who was at ringside, describes the fight:
'He Didn't Fake a Beating'
"Charlie didn't take a beating, there's 110 question about it.
In the first round our boy didn't even lay a glove on him. Half
way through the second round Stu hit him with a right to the
head and lie went down on the seat of his pants.
"He took a count of eight and got up and the referee brushed off
his gloves. Stu tied hint up at the ropes and hit him three or four
times. It was obvious that he couldn't defend himself and the ref
called the fight.
"It's funny, actually, there were over 10,000 people watching the
fight and most of them thought that it was stopped too soon."
Mohr walked out of the ring by himself and collapsed in the
dressing room 10 minutes later. He was immediately operated on in
the University hospital. The surgery took three hours and was
described as "extremely difficult," Mohr had suffered what is called
a diffuse injury in which the blood vessels could not be tied to stop
the bleeding. Ho was given little chance to live. Eight days later,
on Easter Sunday morning, Charlie Mohr died.
'Doirt Worry About a Thing'
Mohr's father said that ho did not blame Kartell or boxing for
his son's death. He said that Charlie had always loved the sport
and needed it to reinforce his confidence in himself. In a letter to
Kartell, Mohr's father said:
"Don't worry about a thing. It isn't your fault and sometimes
things happen this way."
The University of Wisconsin athletic board is to review the status
of boxing in the athletic program and the board of regents will do
likewise. Nearly everybody in Wisconsin has picked a side. Some
are agitating to abolish boxing in the school.
Others say that the sport should not he condemned on the
basis of one injury. They say that this is only the second death in col
legiate boxing in 27 years and that the advantages of the sport:
outweigh the disadvantages.
As Menendez says, "If the boys don't Ih>\ in school, they'll box
somewhere else; in AAU competition or in the Golden Gloves. We
can keep the sport under tight supervision in college and keep in
juries down to a minimum, while allowing all the advantages that
the sport has to offer."
