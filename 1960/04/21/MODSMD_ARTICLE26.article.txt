# Oregon Meet a Tossup
## 
### Dick Barnes 
A battle that will still be rag
ing in Oregon more than an hour
after Ernie Cunliffe and Dyrol
Burleson have run their four
minute mile will be the team fight
for points in Saturday's Stanford-
Oregon meet.
All indications point to a down
to-the-relay meet, with significant

point shifts possible in virtually
every event. The hurdles, shot
put, pole vault, and high jump
have definite favorites, but pick
ing a winner anywhere else
amounts to little more than guess
work.
A man who hasn't run yet this
year could be the key to the meet.
He's Roscoe Cook, Oregon's world

| record equaling sprinter. If lie;
is back in action, Stanford's task
is made more difficult by about
five points.
Conversely, the Indians stand
to gain by at least three points
if Burleson can't come back in |
t lie 880 after his anticipated
classic race with Cunliffe. Cun
liffe will definitely skip the half,
leaving it up to Norm Lloyd, Rich
Klier and Bertil Lundh.
Oregon strategists will be hard
at work figuring where to place
Dave Edstrom for point maximi-'
/ation. He compiled the world's
third-best-ever decathlon score
two weeks ago, and scored in five
i events for Hie Ducks last week.
He should win both hurdle
i races with ease, has marks which
could give him points in the three
weight events, and should lie
good for place or show points in
the broad jump and high jump.
The question, however, is whether
he can ration his time and energy
sufficiently to score in all seven
1 of these events.
