# TONIGHT AT MEM AUD
## Tragedy of 'Richard IIâ€™ to Start 3-Performance Run 
### Sherry Weleh 
Noblemen duel and are banished, a king is deposed, thrown in prison and murdered and an
usurper inherits a troublesome reign in the Stanford Players production of "Richard II," opening
tonight at Memorial Auditorium, and running tomorrow and Saturday at 8:30 p.m.
King Richard is a lover of music and of pageantry. He is introspective, imaginative and eloquent;
yet he is a headstrong and unstable ruler and brings about his own destruction. This is the central

figure whose personality is re
vealed through the unfolding of
the psychological and poetic pat
terns of Shapespeare's lyric
tragedy.
Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of
Hereford .accuses Thomas Mow
bray, Duke of Norfolk, of high
treason and the murder of the
Duke of Gloucester, and the king
appoints a day for them to settle
the dispute in mortal combat.
But with the duel about to be
gin, the king summons the two
men before him, sentencing Mow
bray to perpetual banishment and
Bolingbroke to banishment for
six years.
Death Enters
Bolingbroke's father, old John
of Gaunt, dies, however, and tire
king unscrupulously seizes his
wealth to pay for the Irish War.
Bolingbroke soon returns to de
mand his heritage, and to lead a
rebellion against the king's evil
rule.
The king, who at the onset of
the play arrogantly asserted that
"Not all the water in the rough
rude sea can wash the balm from
an anointed king,'' finds himself
deserted by his troups, and sur
renders.
Brought to London, the king,
Richard the poet, abdicates, sur
rendering his crown. "With mine
own tears I wash away my balm,
with mine own hands I give away
my crown." And as Richard is
taken off to prison, where he is
murdered, Bolingbroke ascends
the throne as Henry IV to rule
over a realm soon torn asunder
by the long and bloody Wars of
the Roses.
Conflicting Ideas
The play is full of conflicting
political ideas. The devine rights
of kings, the subject's duty of
passive obedience, the dangers of
irresponsible despotism, and the
complex qualities of a diving rul
er are treated. But primarily it
is a tragedy of character, an un
folding of psychological and poet
ic patterns.
Dueling for power in the lead
ing roles are Eugene Feyroux as
the weak and yet poetic King
Richard and Fred Levi as Ihc
intellectual and crafty baronial
nominee Bolingbroke.
And the duel will take place on J
a raked stage, built out over the
orchestra pit, against a back
ground of lavish and detailedly
authentic costumes and music
written especially for the produc- j
t ion.
'Overtly Theatrical Quality'
The raked stage, which Direc
tor James Kerans feels will lend
an "overtly theatrical quality" to j
the production, is part of the Stan-;
ford Players attempt to approxi
mate authentic Shapes pea roan
production as closely as possible.
In celebration of Shapespeare's
39(3th birthday Saturday, a special
performance in addition to those
in the evening will be given at !
1:30 p.m. for high school students
and teachers.
