# The
						Goal of Education

Tin* recent investigation of the San Francisco schools l>\ a com
mittee of professors from Stanford I niversity ami I lit* I ni\ersit\
of California has raised quite a controversy. These men were
requested hv the San Francisco Hoard of Education to examine
the school system and to make recommendations for its improve
ment.
Their report has now been prepared and will he presented for
official action to the Hoard of Kducntion in the middle of May.
Already, however, il has heen attacked by a member of the Stan
ford School of Fdueation as being unfair. He looked with dis
favor on criticism of educational methods which did not originate
within pedagogical circles.
It is true that these men did not approacli the schools as pro
fessional educators hut rather investigated as educated men in
terested in improving the teaching system. Certainly, they can
not he criticized for their lack of competence. The members of
the committee, each learned in some field of the humanities or
sciences, looked at the methods used in the teaching of his spe
cialty. Il was with litis background that the recommendations
were made.
I he modern theorv of pedagogy stresses the importance of
adaptation to the problems of life and education for democracy,
(.ranted that these are neeessarv, one must decide the best methods
to ol'tain this goal. One cannot teach that reading is interesting
bv telling the pupils that reading IS interesting, and one cannot
instill the principles of democracy into students without sufTicirtit
background for them to grasp ils complexities.
Just as one should prepare students for reading by teaching
them the principles of word formation, phonetics, and grammar,
so one must la\ a groundwork for instruction in democracy bv
creating iu the students an analytical attitude capable of under
standing the strengths as well as the weaknesses of the democratic
process and of questioning the proposed merits of other govern
mental forms. Democracv cannot be taught: il must be under
stood.
On the wall of one school in San Francisco hangs the follow
ing quotation from Thomas Jefferson: '"! know no safe depositor)
of the ultimate powers of society but the people themselves; and
if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control
with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to lake it from
tliein, but to inform their discretion bv education." This should
be the goal of our educational system.
