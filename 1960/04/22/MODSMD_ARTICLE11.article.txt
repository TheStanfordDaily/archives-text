Campbell Praised
Editor's Note: Copies of the
following letter to Dr. Westley
Campbell, director of the Hoov
er Institution, were sent to the
Daily and the Stanford Aca
demic Council.
Dear Dr. Campbell:
May we offer you our en
couragement on your recent state
ment regarding Herbert Hoover's
concept and the library's purpose.
We heartily agree with the stated
purpose of the Institution's li
brary on War, Revolution and
Peace.
It is difficult to conceive of any
fair-minded objection to exposure
of the evils of the doctrines of
Karl Marx — whether Commu
nism. socialism, economic ma
terialism or atheism. We are sure
that the vast, majority of the un
dergraduates at Stanford were
not raised as atheists, agnostics
or freethinkers. Yet there are
ihose who would bring about the
destruction of their mental in
tegrity by false appeals to "un
fettered search for truth." Un
fettered that is by any basic con-

J cept of morality or the .spiritual
ity of mankind.

I spo from llio campaign pos-1
, tors cluttering up the street in ;
1 front of the Union that il is again i
election time at Stanford. Granted
that those numerous posters, ob-
I viously the resultant reflections
iof mature, well-disciplined intel
lectual minds, add a novel flavor j
to the natural surroundings the
1 trees and bushes provide us with.
Granted that the pictures on these
posters show that the candidates i
are all nice persons good, well
reared, smiling American youths, i
Granted that the positions they !
i are running for are important for :
: the good life at a university.
Still these posters might be put
to better use in placing them in
areas that are more consonant,
with the obviously high level of
intelligence on which these cam
' paigns are being conducted like
i the public toilets, for example.

We heartily agree with the stated
purpose of the Institution's li
brary on War, Revolution and
Peace.
It is difficult to conceive of any
fair-minded objection to exposure
of the evils of the doctrines of
Karl Marx — whether Commu
nism. socialism, economic ma
terialism or atheism. We are sure
that the vast, majority of the un
dergraduates at Stanford were
not raised as atheists, agnostics
or freethinkers. Yet there are
ihose who would bring about the
destruction of their mental in
tegrity by false appeals to "un
fettered search for truth." Un
fettered that is by any basic con-

J cept of morality or the .spiritual
ity of mankind.

Editor, the Daily:
I spo from llio campaign pos-1
, tors cluttering up the street in ;
1 front of the Union that il is again i
election time at Stanford. Granted
that those numerous posters, ob-
I viously the resultant reflections
iof mature, well-disciplined intel
lectual minds, add a novel flavor j
to the natural surroundings the
1 trees and bushes provide us with.
Granted that the pictures on these
posters show that the candidates i
are all nice persons good, well
reared, smiling American youths, i
Granted that the positions they !
i are running for are important for :
: the good life at a university.
Still these posters might be put
to better use in placing them in
areas that are more consonant,
with the obviously high level of
intelligence on which these cam
' paigns are being conducted like
i the public toilets, for example.
