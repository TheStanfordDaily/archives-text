# Nashville Sit-in Protests Demonstrated Good Intent, Peaceful Aims of Students
## 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
Editor's Note: This is the sec
oiml in a series of articles on
sit-in strike demonstrations
against segregated lunch coun
ters hy Southern students.

Five years ago, Nashville Negro
leaders wanted to discuss segre
gated lunch counters and Nash
ville business men refused to
hear them.
A year ago and again in Jan
uary they tried to approach the
store managers, and both times
they were turned away.
Then, on Feb. 20, 1960, the first
sit-ins took place in Nashville
stores with segregated lunch
counters.
They were quiet demonstra
tions; the counters closed when
the strikers appeared. •
But on Saturday afternoon,
Feb. 27, SO Negro and white stu
dents from Fisk University. Ten
nessee Agricultural and Indus
trial University and American
Baptist Theological Seminary
quietly took seats at the counters
of three national chain stores.
Knowing the methods of non
violent resistance, they were
friendly and well mannened. They
did not return insults or strike
back when provoked.
Jeering white boys moved in
behind them, yelled epithets,
pushed and jostled them, crushed
lighted cigarettes on the backs of
women students. Students were
knocked to the floor, beaten and
insulted.
Arrested
Then the attackers fled, and 76
Negroes and five whites — all
members of the sit-in group—
were arrested on charges of dis
orderly conduct.
Almost every Negro lawyer in
Nashville immediately volun
teered for the students' defense.
Churches began a series of mass
meetings, and fund raising activi
ty started. And Fisk's President
Stephen J. Wright called on Nash
ville citizens to put an end to
segregation in eating places.
Negro ministers met with
Mayor Ben West and requested
that he set up a commission of
human relations to deal with
lunch counter problems.
The mayor declined their sug
gestions, but several days later,
after 63 more Negroes had been
arrested in demonstrations, he
appointed a seven-member bi-rac
ial committee to study the issues
and recommend solutions.
It was headed by C. Madison
Sarratt, vice chancellor emeritus
of Vanderbilt University, and
after it started meeting with stu
dents and department store heads,
tension relaxed considerably in
the city.
Court trials began under the
jurisdiction of an appointive rath
er than an elective judge. Most of
the students accepted jail terms.
Thousands of people had been
gathering in the streets, and a
crowd of 2,000 Negroes gathered
outside the city court and sang
spirituals while the hearings went
on.
New Charges
On March 4, trials had been
concluded, but on March 3, the
city prosecutor had filed new
charges, accusing the demonstra
tors of conspiracy to violate Ten
nessee's trade and commerce
laws.
At this time, a warrant went
out for James Lawson, a student
at Vanderbilt Divinity School, who
had not been previously arrested.
He was a Christian missionary
who served three years in India;
he had traveled on the staff of
the Student Volunteer Movement;
he was a secretary of the Fellow
ship of Reconciliation; and he is
now a minister of the Lexington
Annual Conference of the Metho
dist Church.

Lawson is also a conscientious
objector, and he has counseled
students in the methods of passive
and non-violent resistance.
The Nashville Banner, in edi
torial comment, called Lawson
"the ramrod of strife," and charg
ed him with "out-Kaspering Kas
per," "contemptuous challenge of
civil authority" and "incitation to
anarchy."
The next day the Executive
Committee of the Board of Trust
of Vanderbilt University ordered
Lawson to either withdraw from
the University or face expulsion.
Voting Members
Voting as members of the ex
ecutive committee were James G.
Stahlman, president and publisher
of the Nashville Banner, and John
E. Sloan, president of one of the
largest department stores where
students had held demonstrations.
The spokesman of Ihe Univer
sity said that it was not punishing
Lawson for what he had done in
the past, but for his avowal of in
tention to continue a program of
civil disobedience.
". . . There is no issue involved
of freedom of thought or of con
science or of speech or of Ihe
right to protest against social
custom. The issue is whether or
not the university can be identi
fied with a continuing campaign
of mass disobedience of law as a
means of protest."
Facility Statement
On March 9, a statement signed
by 126 members of the Vanderbilt
faculty appeared in the Nashville
papers declaring:
". . . We deplore the intolerance
that is the fundamental cause of
the Nashville disturbances. . . .

"We arc distressed that recent
actions by Vanderbilt University
may be interpreted as condoning
the denial of rights of Nashville
Negroes to speak and act lawfully
in their cause, or of sympathetic
individuals at Vanderbilt or else
where to support and defend
them by word or deed.
"We commend the students of
Nashville's Negro educational in
stitutions and their supporters
including members of the Vander
bilt divinity school faculty and
student body, for conducting
themselves with patience and for
bearance under extreme provoca
tion. We hereby express our
sympathy and support for their
peaceful and lawful efforts to
secure their rights as men and as
citizens,"
The students have decided to
appeal their convictions, and Law
son intends to stay in Nashville
until September of this year,
when he will resume his studies
elsewhere.
But in Nashville, marches of
2,500 people go on.
And last week TOO students
from 10 Southern states gathered
in Raleigh, N.C., where the Rev.
Martin Luther King called for a
campaign of nationwide "selective
buying."
Stanford students responded by
picketing Woolworth's, which dis
criminates in its Southern stores
lunch counters.

It was headed by C. Madison
Sarratt, vice chancellor emeritus

after it started meeting with stu

tension relaxed considerably in
the city.
Court trials began under the
jurisdiction of an appointive rath

the students accepted jail terms.
Thousands of people had been
gathering in the streets, and a
crowd of 2,000 Negroes gathered
outside the city court and sang
spirituals while the hearings went
on.
New Charges
On March 4, trials had been
concluded, but on March 3, the
city prosecutor had filed new
charges, accusing the demonstra
tors of conspiracy to violate Ten
nessee's trade and commerce
laws.
At this time, a warrant went
out for James Lawson, a student
at Vanderbilt Divinity School, who
had not been previously arrested.
He was a Christian missionary
who served three years in India;
he had traveled on the staff of
the Student Volunteer Movement;
he was a secretary of the Fellow
ship of Reconciliation; and he is
now a minister of the Lexington
Annual Conference of the Metho
dist Church.

Lawson is also a conscientious
objector, and he has counseled
students in the methods of passive
and non-violent resistance.
The Nashville Banner, in edi
torial comment, called Lawson
"the ramrod of strife," and charg
ed him with "out-Kaspering Kas
per," "contemptuous challenge of
civil authority" and "incitation to
anarchy."
The next day the Executive
Committee of the Board of Trust
of Vanderbilt University ordered
Lawson to either withdraw from
the University or face expulsion.
Voting Members
Voting as members of the ex
ecutive committee were James G.
Stahlman, president and publisher
of the Nashville Banner, and John
E. Sloan, president of one of the
largest department stores where
students had held demonstrations.
The spokesman of Ihe Univer
sity said that it was not punishing
Lawson for what he had done in
the past, but for his avowal of in
tention to continue a program of
civil disobedience.
". . . There is no issue involved
of freedom of thought or of con
science or of speech or of Ihe
right to protest against social
custom. The issue is whether or
not the university can be identi
fied with a continuing campaign
of mass disobedience of law as a
means of protest."
Facility Statement
On March 9, a statement signed
by 126 members of the Vanderbilt
faculty appeared in the Nashville
papers declaring:
". . . We deplore the intolerance
that is the fundamental cause of

"We arc distressed that recent
actions by Vanderbilt University
may be interpreted as condoning
the denial of rights of Nashville
Negroes to speak and act lawfully
in their cause, or of sympathetic

where to support and defend
them by word or deed.
"We commend the students of
Nashville's Negro educational in

student body, for conducting
themselves with patience and for
bearance under extreme provoca

sympathy and support for their
peaceful and lawful efforts to
secure their rights as men and as

The students have decided to
appeal their convictions, and Law
son intends to stay in Nashville
until September of this year,
when he will resume his studies
elsewhere.
But in Nashville, marches of
2,500 people go on.
And last week TOO students
from 10 Southern states gathered
in Raleigh, N.C., where the Rev.
Martin Luther King called for a
campaign of nationwide "selective
buying."
Stanford students responded by
picketing Woolworth's, which dis
criminates in its Southern stores
lunch counters.
Editor's Note: This is the sec

sit-in strike demonstrations
against segregated lunch coun

Five years ago, Nashville Negro
leaders wanted to discuss segre
gated lunch counters and Nash
ville business men refused to
hear them.
A year ago and again in Jan
uary they tried to approach the
store managers, and both times
they were turned away.
Then, on Feb. 20, 1960, the first
sit-ins took place in Nashville
stores with segregated lunch
counters.
They were quiet demonstra

the strikers appeared. •
But on Saturday afternoon,
Feb. 27, SO Negro and white stu
dents from Fisk University. Ten
nessee Agricultural and Indus
trial University and American
Baptist Theological Seminary
quietly took seats at the counters
of three national chain stores.
Knowing the methods of non
violent resistance, they were
friendly and well mannened. They
did not return insults or strike
back when provoked.
Jeering white boys moved in
behind them, yelled epithets,
pushed and jostled them, crushed
lighted cigarettes on the backs of
women students. Students were
knocked to the floor, beaten and
insulted.
Arrested
Then the attackers fled, and 76
Negroes and five whites — all
members of the sit-in group—
were arrested on charges of dis
orderly conduct.
Almost every Negro lawyer in
Nashville immediately volun
teered for the students' defense.
Churches began a series of mass
meetings, and fund raising activi
ty started. And Fisk's President
Stephen J. Wright called on Nash
ville citizens to put an end to
segregation in eating places.
Negro ministers met with
Mayor Ben West and requested
that he set up a commission of
human relations to deal with
lunch counter problems.
The mayor declined their sug
gestions, but several days later,
after 63 more Negroes had been
arrested in demonstrations, he
appointed a seven-member bi-rac

Facility Statement
On March 9, a statement signed
by 126 members of the Vanderbilt
faculty appeared in the Nashville
papers declaring:
". . . We deplore the intolerance
that is the fundamental cause of
the Nashville disturbances. . . .

"We arc distressed that recent
actions by Vanderbilt University
may be interpreted as condoning
the denial of rights of Nashville
Negroes to speak and act lawfully
in their cause, or of sympathetic

them by word or deed.
"We commend the students of

sympathy and support for their
peaceful and lawful efforts to
secure their rights as men and as

The students have decided to
appeal their convictions, and Law
son intends to stay in Nashville
until September of this year,
when he will resume his studies
elsewhere.
But in Nashville, marches of
2,500 people go on.
And last week TOO students
from 10 Southern states gathered
in Raleigh, N.C., where the Rev.
Martin Luther King called for a
campaign of nationwide "selective
buying."
Stanford students responded by
picketing Woolworth's, which dis
criminates in its Southern stores
lunch counters.
Editor's Note: This is the sec
oiml in a series of articles on
sit-in strike demonstrations
against segregated lunch coun
ters hy Southern students.

Five years ago, Nashville Negro
leaders wanted to discuss segre
gated lunch counters and Nash
ville business men refused to
hear them.
A year ago and again in Jan
uary they tried to approach the
store managers, and both times
they were turned away.
Then, on Feb. 20, 1960, the first
sit-ins took place in Nashville
stores with segregated lunch
counters.
They were quiet demonstra
tions; the counters closed when
the strikers appeared. •
But on Saturday afternoon,
Feb. 27, SO Negro and white stu
dents from Fisk University. Ten
nessee Agricultural and Indus
trial University and American
Baptist Theological Seminary
quietly took seats at the counters
of three national chain stores.
Knowing the methods of non
violent resistance, they were
friendly and well mannened. They
did not return insults or strike
back when provoked.
Jeering white boys moved in
behind them, yelled epithets,
pushed and jostled them, crushed
lighted cigarettes on the backs of
women students. Students were
knocked to the floor, beaten and
insulted.
Arrested
Then the attackers fled, and 76
Negroes and five whites — all
members of the sit-in group—
were arrested on charges of dis
orderly conduct.
Almost every Negro lawyer in
Nashville immediately volun
teered for the students' defense.
Churches began a series of mass
meetings, and fund raising activi
ty started. And Fisk's President
Stephen J. Wright called on Nash
ville citizens to put an end to
segregation in eating places.
Negro ministers met with
Mayor Ben West and requested
that he set up a commission of
human relations to deal with
lunch counter problems.
The mayor declined their sug
gestions, but several days later,
after 63 more Negroes had been
arrested in demonstrations, he
appointed a seven-member bi-rac
ial committee to study the issues
and recommend solutions.
It was headed by C. Madison
Sarratt, vice chancellor emeritus
of Vanderbilt University, and
after it started meeting with stu
dents and department store heads,
tension relaxed considerably in
the city.
Court trials began under the
jurisdiction of an appointive rath
er than an elective judge. Most of
the students accepted jail terms.
Thousands of people had been
gathering in the streets, and a
crowd of 2,000 Negroes gathered
outside the city court and sang
spirituals while the hearings went
on.
New Charges
On March 4, trials had been
concluded, but on March 3, the
city prosecutor had filed new
charges, accusing the demonstra
tors of conspiracy to violate Ten
nessee's trade and commerce
laws.
At this time, a warrant went
out for James Lawson, a student
at Vanderbilt Divinity School, who
had not been previously arrested.
He was a Christian missionary
who served three years in India;
he had traveled on the staff of
the Student Volunteer Movement;
he was a secretary of the Fellow
ship of Reconciliation; and he is
now a minister of the Lexington
Annual Conference of the Metho
dist Church.

Lawson is also a conscientious
objector, and he has counseled
students in the methods of passive
and non-violent resistance.
The Nashville Banner, in edi
torial comment, called Lawson
"the ramrod of strife," and charg
ed him with "out-Kaspering Kas
per," "contemptuous challenge of
civil authority" and "incitation to
anarchy."
The next day the Executive
Committee of the Board of Trust
of Vanderbilt University ordered
Lawson to either withdraw from
the University or face expulsion.
Voting Members
Voting as members of the ex
ecutive committee were James G.
Stahlman, president and publisher
of the Nashville Banner, and John
E. Sloan, president of one of the
largest department stores where
students had held demonstrations.
The spokesman of Ihe Univer
sity said that it was not punishing
Lawson for what he had done in
the past, but for his avowal of in
tention to continue a program of
civil disobedience.
". . . There is no issue involved
