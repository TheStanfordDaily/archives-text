# STEVE BAFFREY LOOKS AT LIFE
## 
### 
If variety is the spice of life (and
whose life couldn't use a little
spice?), then the April 25 LIFE is
one of the spicier issues I have seen
in a long time.
This is not to imply that Stanford
pin-up seekers should run out and
buy up all the copies on the Cellar
newsstands, but instead that anybody
with mid-quarter drag might get
kicks out of the varied fare for sale
in 152 pages of the 19c best-seller.
Farm politicos, sports fans, space
engineers, dramatists, tourists, and
gorilla lovers all figure into the April
25 picture in LIFE, and so does any
body interested in an amazing story
of the conglomerate activities that go
on inside New York's famous Carne
gie Hall.
PIN-UP. If you're tired of plas
tering walls with shapely dollies in
bikinis, LIFE offers (undoubtedly
one of those "this - week - only"
things) a great picture of Coma, a
6-month-old gorilla. It's the kind of
thing girls get maternal over. Cute,
so to speak.
THE BIC COUNT. Problem: You
are a census taker. You've got to
count every human nose in a given
area. How do you get info from the
recluse who lives in the local jungle,
or the folks up on the nearby moun
tain top, or even the settlement on
Kauai Island?
And what happens when a snarl
ing German shepard, who in your
fears seems to be twice your weight,
guards the door to his master's
home?
As a salesman or saleswomen ped
dling pots and pans you could up and
say to hell with these problems; but
this won't work for census takers.
Like with the mail, the census must
go through.
And following it through, at least
in the Hawaiian Islands part of the
operation, is LIFE for April 25.
SPORTS FANS. Three items of
interest for the sporty crowd have
filtered info the current LIFE.
Item #1; Candlestick Park—a
story all about the new home for
San Francisco's almost-new Giants.
Called "Row Me Out to the Ball
Game."
Item #2: The National AAU
swimming meet —full photo cover
age by LIFE photographer George
Silk—with all the pictures taken un
der water. So, if you have ever won
dered what a national AAU meet
looks like from the trout's rye view
—go get it.

Item #3: Golfers' delight in
reading about how other golfers do
on the links, I've been told. And if
so, then there's much delight in store
for the put-putters who want to fol
low Arnold Palmer around the course
at the Masters tournament in Au
gusta, Ca., and have him describe
what was going through his mind
when a series of shots taken during
the course of his spectacular victory
there was taken.
REPRISE FOR CARNECIE.
Throughout the world Carnegie Hall
is known by music lovers as the home
of some of the world's greatest per
formances. Every artist of impor
tance in the world has played there.
New York City, alas, has built a
new music hall, and the maiority of
the town's concert activities had
been scheduled for the new struc
ture. This news caused havoc in the
hearts of music lovers.
Violinist Isaac Stern organized a
Save-Carnegie-Hall committee and
saved the day for performers and an
arresting assortment of tenants who
have studios in the Hall.
The near-loss of the great audito
rium prompted LIFE and photogra
pher Alfred Eisenstadt to investigate
the amazing variety of tenants and
some of the memorable moments in
the history of the venerable struc
ture.
The product of the investigation
and photography is a wonderfully
human, and decidedly different, pic
ture of the Hall than most people
ever get.
It sort of makes you look at Me
morial Hall in more disgust than one
might normally do. For though casts
and crews of both the "Richard II"
and "Kismet" productions might
imply that Mem Aud is really "lived
in," it doesn't quite match up.
CHANCINC POLITICS. Leonard
Hall (who looks like professor Cor
nelius P. Cotter —and incidentally is
on the right side of the political fence
for the comparison) is an old pro at
the political game. As the former
C.O.P. national chairman he speaks
with some authority when he says
politics have changed in the United
States.
Hall, in the April 25 LIFE, looks
over the situation which spans the 35
years since he entered politics, and
comes up with conclusions that
young budding political scientists
will find interesting reading and feed
for better discussions

the town's concert activities had
been scheduled for the new struc
ture. This news caused havoc in the
hearts of music lovers.
Violinist Isaac Stern organized a
Save-Carnegie-Hall committee and
saved the day for performers and an
arresting assortment of tenants who
have studios in the Hall.
The near-loss of the great audito
rium prompted LIFE and photogra
pher Alfred Eisenstadt to investigate
the amazing variety of tenants and
some of the memorable moments in
the history of the venerable struc
ture.
The product of the investigation
and photography is a wonderfully
human, and decidedly different, pic
ture of the Hall than most people
ever get.
It sort of makes you look at Me
morial Hall in more disgust than one
might normally do. For though casts
and crews of both the "Richard II"
and "Kismet" productions might
imply that Mem Aud is really "lived
in," it doesn't quite match up.
CHANCINC POLITICS. Leonard
Hall (who looks like professor Cor
nelius P. Cotter —and incidentally is
on the right side of the political fence
for the comparison) is an old pro at
the political game. As the former
C.O.P. national chairman he speaks
with some authority when he says
politics have changed in the United
States.
Hall, in the April 25 LIFE, looks
over the situation which spans the 35
years since he entered politics, and
comes up with conclusions that
young budding political scientists
will find interesting reading and feed
for better discussions


If variety is the spice of life (and
whose life couldn't use a little
spice?), then the April 25 LIFE is
one of the spicier issues I have seen
in a long time.
This is not to imply that Stanford
pin-up seekers should run out and
buy up all the copies on the Cellar
newsstands, but instead that anybody
with mid-quarter drag might get
kicks out of the varied fare for sale
in 152 pages of the 19c best-seller.
Farm politicos, sports fans, space
engineers, dramatists, tourists, and
gorilla lovers all figure into the April
25 picture in LIFE, and so does any
body interested in an amazing story
of the conglomerate activities that go
on inside New York's famous Carne
gie Hall.
PIN-UP. If you're tired of plas
tering walls with shapely dollies in
bikinis, LIFE offers (undoubtedly
one of those "this - week - only"
things) a great picture of Coma, a
6-month-old gorilla. It's the kind of
thing girls get maternal over. Cute,
so to speak.
THE BIC COUNT. Problem: You
are a census taker. You've got to
count every human nose in a given
area. How do you get info from the
recluse who lives in the local jungle,
or the folks up on the nearby moun
tain top, or even the settlement on
Kauai Island?
And what happens when a snarl
ing German shepard, who in your
fears seems to be twice your weight,
guards the door to his master's
home?
As a salesman or saleswomen ped
dling pots and pans you could up and
say to hell with these problems; but
this won't work for census takers.
Like with the mail, the census must
go through.
And following it through, at least
in the Hawaiian Islands part of the
operation, is LIFE for April 25.
SPORTS FANS. Three items of
interest for the sporty crowd have
filtered info the current LIFE.
Item #1; Candlestick Park—a
story all about the new home for
San Francisco's almost-new Giants.
Called "Row Me Out to the Ball
Game."
Item #2: The National AAU
swimming meet —full photo cover
age by LIFE photographer George
Silk—with all the pictures taken un
der water. So, if you have ever won
dered what a national AAU meet
looks like from the trout's rye view
—go get it.

Item #3: Golfers' delight in
reading about how other golfers do
on the links, I've been told. And if
so, then there's much delight in store
for the put-putters who want to fol
low Arnold Palmer around the course
at the Masters tournament in Au
gusta, Ca., and have him describe
what was going through his mind
when a series of shots taken during
the course of his spectacular victory
there was taken.

this won't work for census takers.
Like with the mail, the census must
go through.
And following it through, at least
in the Hawaiian Islands part of the
operation, is LIFE for April 25.
SPORTS FANS. Three items of
interest for the sporty crowd have
filtered info the current LIFE.
Item #1; Candlestick Park—a
story all about the new home for
San Francisco's almost-new Giants.
Called "Row Me Out to the Ball
Game."
Item #2: The National AAU
swimming meet —full photo cover
age by LIFE photographer George
Silk—with all the pictures taken un
der water. So, if you have ever won
dered what a national AAU meet
looks like from the trout's rye view
—go get it.

Item #3: Golfers' delight in
reading about how other golfers do
on the links, I've been told. And if
so, then there's much delight in store
for the put-putters who want to fol
low Arnold Palmer around the course
at the Masters tournament in Au
gusta, Ca., and have him describe
what was going through his mind
when a series of shots taken during
the course of his spectacular victory
there was taken.
REPRISE FOR CARNECIE.
Throughout the world Carnegie Hall
is known by music lovers as the home
of some of the world's greatest per
formances. Every artist of impor
tance in the world has played there.
New York City, alas, has built a
new music hall, and the maiority of
the town's concert activities had
been scheduled for the new struc
ture. This news caused havoc in the
hearts of music lovers.
Violinist Isaac Stern organized a
Save-Carnegie-Hall committee and
saved the day for performers and an
arresting assortment of tenants who
have studios in the Hall.
The near-loss of the great audito
rium prompted LIFE and photogra
pher Alfred Eisenstadt to investigate
the amazing variety of tenants and
some of the memorable moments in
the history of the venerable struc
ture.
The product of the investigation
and photography is a wonderfully
human, and decidedly different, pic
ture of the Hall than most people
ever get.
It sort of makes you look at Me
morial Hall in more disgust than one
might normally do. For though casts
and crews of both the "Richard II"
and "Kismet" productions might
imply that Mem Aud is really "lived
in," it doesn't quite match up.
CHANCINC POLITICS. Leonard
Hall (who looks like professor Cor
nelius P. Cotter —and incidentally is
on the right side of the political fence
for the comparison) is an old pro at
the political game. As the former
C.O.P. national chairman he speaks
with some authority when he says
politics have changed in the United
States.
Hall, in the April 25 LIFE, looks
over the situation which spans the 35
years since he entered politics, and
comes up with conclusions that
young budding political scientists
will find interesting reading and feed
for better discussions


If variety is the spice of life (and
whose life couldn't use a little
spice?), then the April 25 LIFE is
one of the spicier issues I have seen
in a long time.
This is not to imply that Stanford
pin-up seekers should run out and
buy up all the copies on the Cellar
newsstands, but instead that anybody
with mid-quarter drag might get
kicks out of the varied fare for sale
in 152 pages of the 19c best-seller.
Farm politicos, sports fans, space
engineers, dramatists, tourists, and
gorilla lovers all figure into the April
25 picture in LIFE, and so does any
body interested in an amazing story
of the conglomerate activities that go
on inside New York's famous Carne
gie Hall.
PIN-UP. If you're tired of plas
tering walls with shapely dollies in
bikinis, LIFE offers (undoubtedly
one of those "this - week - only"
things) a great picture of Coma, a
6-month-old gorilla. It's the kind of
thing girls get maternal over. Cute,
so to speak.
THE BIC COUNT. Problem: You
are a census taker. You've got to
count every human nose in a given
area. How do you get info from the
recluse who lives in the local jungle,
or the folks up on the nearby moun
tain top, or even the settlement on
Kauai Island?
And what happens when a snarl
ing German shepard, who in your
fears seems to be twice your weight,
guards the door to his master's
home?
As a salesman or saleswomen ped
dling pots and pans you could up and
say to hell with these problems; but
this won't work for census takers.
Like with the mail, the census must
go through.
