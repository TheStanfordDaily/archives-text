## Korea Assembly Argues Violently 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea (/P) The South Korean National Assem
bly met in extraordinary session yesterday and violence almost im
mediately broke out between supporters and opponents of President
Syngman Rhee.
The Assembly called to deal with the crisis posed by this week's

civilian rebellion against Rhee's
election tactics.
The violence erupted in the As
sembly when a spokesman for,
Rhee's Liberal party accused anti-:
government demonstrators of i
murder, arson and terror.
I Opposition Democratic party as
i semblyman angrily shoved the
i spokesman, Defense Minister Kim
, Chung-Yul, from the rostrum and
kept him from completing his,
I speech.
Scuffle
This set off a five-minute seuf
, fie between outnumbered Demo
-5 crats and the Liberals.
While this went on. Communist ,
. North Korea was quick to take
advantage of the situation in the j
riot-torn southern part of the di
vided peninsula. Broadcasts from
) Red China's Radio Peiping and
North Korea's Radio Pyongyang
called for the people of South Ko- j
rea to overthrow the Rhee gov-1
eminent, oust American soldiers |
and unite with the North.
The broadcasts said the call was
made by the Central Committee
of the Korean Workers Commit
nisi parly, the ruling group of.
North Korea. It proposed immedi
. ate .joint meetings of representa- j
i tives of North and South Korea.
Fight Breaks Out
The Assembly fight broke out
as Rhee was reported trying to I
' form a new Cabinet in an effort
' to still rising opposition demands;
for new nationwide elections.
The opposition members in the'
; Assembly shouted down the gov
ernment speaker, saying lie had
failed to mention police shootings j
that brought an estimated 1,0001
casualties earlier this week. By I
official count 12.1 persons were
killed, 777 injured and one is
missing.
Among the moves Rhee was re-'
ported considering to meet de
mands against his regime was the
bringing into the Cabinet of some i
of his old political foes.
There also was a call for Lee ;
Kipoong, vice president-elect, to
quit. Lee, a member of Rhee's j
ruling Liberal party, was named I
vice president in the March elec
tions to take office Aug. 15. This i
week's bloody uprising against
the government stemmed from
charges that the voting was!
rigged.
Kim Chun-Yiin. leader of the;
I nit\ parly, a splinter group of!
former democrats, said he had
told Rhee that Lee should step >
down. This was the first public
! suggestion that only the vice!
presidential election be held
again. Rhee was unopposed in
being re-elected president.
Brutality Keport
In another attempt to quiet j
criticism of South Korea both at
home and abroad, National Police
(Director Cho In-Koo asked the
public to write him any reports
of police brutality or mistreat
ment of demonstrators who stag
ed a near revolt this week in
Seoul and other major cities.
Nearly 1,000, mostly students,
were shot. The martial law com
mand announced that 125 were
killed in Seoul and elsewhere. It
asked that other deaths be re ,
ported to authorities.
Seoul and other Korean cities
remained under martial law. All
were reported quiet. i
