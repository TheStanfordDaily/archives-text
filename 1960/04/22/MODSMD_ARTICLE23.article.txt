Stanford's track team hearts for Eugene today for a Saturday battle with a potent University of
Oregon team.
Undoubtedly the top event of the afternoon will be the mile run which will pit Stanford's Ernie
Cunliffe, who has run ihe fastest mile in the world this year, against Oregon's sensational sopho
more Dyrol Burleson.
Cunliffe and Burleson run a completely different style of race, with Ernie usually taking the

lead right away and ihen running
as hard as he can as long as he
can; while Burleson usually runs
only fast enough to win and pos
sesses a tremendous finishing
kick.
Cunliffe's top time of the year
is 4:02.3, while Burleson's best I
mark is 4:05.4, which he set in
doors earlier this year.
Burleson's best outdoor time
this year is not particularly red !
hot, but it's always been good
enough to win. There is little j

John Northway, who has been
running the eight lapper in steady
times will start with Monzingo.
Stanford will go with Lloyd.
Rich Klier and Jeff Evans in the

half mik». Cunliffe, usually an
SSO starter, probably won't be in
this one so lit 1 can concentrate on
Olympic qualifying times, world's
records and four-minute miles.

Karnes, Hob Payne and Hon
Kapoporf will travel (o Eugene
to cover the Stanford-Oregon
track meet. Read Monday's
Daily for details.

doubt that he can move fast
enough to give Cunliffe an in
teresting race.
As for the meet itself. Oregon
must be rated the favorite, but
it is far from inconceivable that
the Tribe could pick up the win.
There are several spots where a
few better - than - usual Stanford
performances could pick up some
extra points. Two cases in point
are the 100 yard dash and the
discus.
Oregon's Jim Puckett, a sopho
more. has a top mark of 9.7 in
the 100. Teammate Jerry Stubble
field is right behind at 9.8. Top
Indian time for the 100 is Dean
Smith's 9.8. On this basis Bucket
must be rated the favorite, but
those who watched Smith upset
UCLA's Chris Knott last week
don't count him out of the run
ning.
In the discus Stuhblefield has
the best mark this year for any
of the competitors. He has been
out around 162 feet. However.
Stanford's Don Bell was just un
der 160 feet last week.
Bell will be an added starter
in the high jump this week, mark
ing his second competition in this
event. He went 6-0 last week.
The two-mile is another ques
tion mark. On ihe strength of his
fine performance 1a s t week
against UCLA, Stanford's Bob
Monzingo must be given the nod.
Bob turned in a 9:16.7. However,
Dick Miller for Oregon has a top
time of 9:01.1 which he ran last
year. Miller hasn't been under
9:20 yet this year, but should he
suddenly find himself Monzingo
may be in trouble.

the best mark this year for any
of the competitors. He has been
out around 162 feet. However.
Stanford's Don Bell was just un

Bell will be an added starter
in the high jump this week, mark

event. He went 6-0 last week.
The two-mile is another ques

fine performance 1a s t week

Bob turned in a 9:16.7. However,

9:20 yet this year, but should he
suddenly find himself Monzingo

Oregon team.
Undoubtedly the top event of the afternoon will be the mile run which will pit Stanford's Ernie
Cunliffe, who has run ihe fastest mile in the world this year, against Oregon's sensational sopho
more Dyrol Burleson.
Cunliffe and Burleson run a completely different style of race, with Ernie usually taking the

lead right away and ihen running
as hard as he can as long as he
can; while Burleson usually runs
only fast enough to win and pos
sesses a tremendous finishing
kick.
Cunliffe's top time of the year
is 4:02.3, while Burleson's best I
mark is 4:05.4, which he set in
