WASHINGTON </P) The House,
with a 288-95 roll call and a figu
rative sigh of relief, passed the
1960 civil rights bill yesterday and
sent it to President Eisenhower.
The bill, which aims primarily
at helping Southern Negroes vote,
has been the most time-consum
ing and talked-over issue Con
gress has tackled this year.
There was no doubt President
Eisenhower would sign the bill.
He already had passed the word
he was satisfied with it, and Atty.
Gen. William P. Rogers issued a
favorable statement yesterday.
"It's impact, once the expected
legal challenges have been dis
posed of in the normal judicial
process, will be substantial, 1 be
lieve, both in establishing the
right to vote of those who have
been discriminated against on ac
count of race or color and by
deterring future discriminations
by persons acting under color of
state law," Rogers said.
The bill goes farther than de
sired by Southern members of
Congress but not nearly as far
as the National Assn. for the Ad
vancement of Colored People and
some other supporters wished.
