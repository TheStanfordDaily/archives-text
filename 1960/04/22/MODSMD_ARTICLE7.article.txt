# King Richard 'Very Effective'
## 
### 
/>v Mary J.on Mckinley, Managing Editor
Highly theatrical qualities and striking stage settings ensured
the success of the Stanford Players' production of "Richard II"
which opened last night in Memorial Auditorium.
Although visual elements rather than a deep understanding
and clear communication of Shapespeare's words dominated the

play, the production was, for the
most part, absorbing and very ef
fective.
Superb Settings
The settings, designed by Rich
ard Hay. were superb. The garden
scene and the Queen's chambers
could have been taken directly
from a Medieval painting and
were two of the most visually at
tractive pictures I've ever seen

; created on the stage, although tlie
selling most effective dramatical
ly was the simpler one seen in
the second act.
Irene Griffin's costumes, too,
were a delight. Careful planning
| and perfect coordination of cos
tume colors added greatly to the
striking appearances of the lead
ing characters.
Skillful Direction
The visual qualities of the pro
duction were strengthened by
James Kerans' skillful direction
and use of the extended down
, stage area.
In the title role, Eugene Pey
| roux emphasized Richard's weak-
I ness as a king "basely led by flat
terers." His interpretation of
I Richard as a weak bill alvvays
| kingly figure was certainly valid
while departing from some more
j forceful interpretations.
Pcyroux' performance in the
! second and third acts especially
showed great perception and
I depth the poetic and pathetic
I qualities of the king were en-
I haneed by his deep feeling for the
| role. He received a special ovation
after the deposition scone which
| demonstrated his lino understand
j ing of Richard's personality.
Holing broke Good
Fred Levi as Bolingbroke did a
j fine job in creating a forceful
personality for Richard's oppon
ent. While speaking with power
and conviction, however, many of
; his lines were hard to undcr
: stand. In fact, the diction of near
ly all the performers could have
: been greatly improved.
Alvin Kaufman as John of < Jaunt
did a similarly fine job. his insight
into the role and communicative
; ability producing an excellent
'characterization of the old duke.
Other well-done roles included
Edmund, Duke of York, played by
i James Gough, the Duke of
Aumerele by William Kinsolvin/j
and the Earl of Northumberland
by Steven Gilborn.
The jousting match in the first
act was one of the weakest scenes
in the play. The many persons on
stage seemed disinterested in the
proceedings, especially the queen,
although Carol Moserip's per
formance in this role was other
wise commendable.
Performances continue tonight
'and tomorrow night at 8:30.

and clear communication of Shapespeare's words dominated the

play, the production was, for the
most part, absorbing and very ef
fective.
Superb Settings
The settings, designed by Rich
ard Hay. were superb. The garden
scene and the Queen's chambers
could have been taken directly
from a Medieval painting and
were two of the most visually at
tractive pictures I've ever seen

; created on the stage, although tlie
selling most effective dramatical
ly was the simpler one seen in
the second act.
Irene Griffin's costumes, too,
were a delight. Careful planning
| and perfect coordination of cos
tume colors added greatly to the
striking appearances of the lead
ing characters.
Skillful Direction
The visual qualities of the pro
duction were strengthened by
James Kerans' skillful direction
and use of the extended down
, stage area.
In the title role, Eugene Pey
| roux emphasized Richard's weak-
I ness as a king "basely led by flat
terers." His interpretation of
I Richard as a weak bill alvvays
| kingly figure was certainly valid
while departing from some more
j forceful interpretations.
Pcyroux' performance in the
! second and third acts especially
showed great perception and
I depth the poetic and pathetic
I qualities of the king were en-
I haneed by his deep feeling for the
| role. He received a special ovation
after the deposition scone which
| demonstrated his lino understand
j ing of Richard's personality.
Holing broke Good
Fred Levi as Bolingbroke did a
j fine job in creating a forceful
personality for Richard's oppon
ent. While speaking with power
and conviction, however, many of
; his lines were hard to undcr
: stand. In fact, the diction of near
ly all the performers could have
: been greatly improved.
Alvin Kaufman as John of < Jaunt
did a similarly fine job. his insight
into the role and communicative
; ability producing an excellent
'characterization of the old duke.
Other well-done roles included
Edmund, Duke of York, played by
i James Gough, the Duke of
Aumerele by William Kinsolvin/j
and the Earl of Northumberland
by Steven Gilborn.
The jousting match in the first
act was one of the weakest scenes
in the play. The many persons on
stage seemed disinterested in the
proceedings, especially the queen,
although Carol Moserip's per
formance in this role was other
wise commendable.
Performances continue tonight
'and tomorrow night at 8:30.
