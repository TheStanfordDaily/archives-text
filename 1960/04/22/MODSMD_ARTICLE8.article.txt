# Legislature Places NSA Up to Voters
## 
### 
Stanford affiliation in the national Student Association will be decided by a student body ref
erendum concurrent with ASSU final elections next Wednesday and Thursday, according to a three
times-reversed and still confusing decision last night by Stanford's student Legislature.
By a 14-4 vote Legislature took its first action on NSA a flat rejection of the motion to reaffiliate.
Then it was moved for a reversal of the action dropping NSA affiliation by putting the issue to the

student body in a referendum vote
along with ASSU final elections
next week.
Referendum Passed
The referendum motion was
passed by 8 votes to 6 with 3 ab
stentions in a roll call count, but
ASSU President Rich Sundeen
ruled that an 8-6 vote still left
the motion short of a majority
of a quorum and that the refer
endum had therefore been drop
ped.
Alternate Union Representative
Judith Houtz immediately called a
question of the decision of the
chair. Sundeen explained a ma
jority of a 16-man quorum was
required for passage, and that al
though IT voting members, a
quorum, were present and the
motion received a majority of the
votes cast, it did not receive a
majority vote of a quorum.
Several Legislature members
protested that this turned absten
tions into negative votes which
the abstaining members did not
intend to cast, but the issue was
dropped.
Contused Debate
In a confused debate later in
the meeting Legislature members
agreed that the quorum issue was
not settled. A straw vote of the
Legislature suggested that the
referendum decision might be re
versed, and a revote passed it
by a 9-6 count.
Daily Editor Steve Freidberg
offered equal space in next week's
Dailies for Legislature members
favoring each side of the NSA
controversary to argue their cases
and inform the student body be
fore the referendum. The deci
sion of the referendum will be
binding on the Legislature.
On tlie second highly contro
versial issue on Legislature
agenda last night—the "academic
freedom" case of University of
Illinois Professor Leo Koch—Leg
islature agreed by a 13-2 vote to
express no opinion.
Against Stand by LASSU
Representatives from Roble,
Branner and Union Residence re
ported that their constituents
were almost unanimously against
Legislature taking a stand "on an
issue that we don't know enough
about and that is none of our
business."
Other representatives reported
that their constituents were di
vided as to whether they felt that
Koch's dismissal was a violation
of academic freedom.
ASSU Budget
Legislature also reviewed its
first installment of a proposed
$39,000 1960-61 ASSU budget. Leg
islature studied preliminary bud
gets for the Associated Women
Students, Pre-Rcgistration Com
mittee. Stu-Fac Committee and
the Hostels Board.
Proposed budgets submitted by
ASSU Business Manager Bob Best
are: AWS, $1,027; Pre-Reg. $2,900;
Stu-Fac Com, $66; and Hostels
Board, $375.
In other business Legislature
approved revision of the ASSU
by-laws and the Lagunita Consti
tution and heard first readings of
proposed Elections Commission
and Publications Board by-laws
eha nges.
