# FORMER CONVAIR VP
## Ike's Peace Talk Called a 'Fallacy' 
### Doug Willis 
"The President believes thai as long as we talk about peace,
then somehow there will be peace," former Convair vice president
Thomas Lanphir told a Stanford audience Saturday, "but this is
a fallacy."
Lanphier attacked the Eisenhower Administration for "letling

concern over balancing the budget
dominate our defense policy." He
said he "could not understand"
why the administration worries
about the budget when the na
tion's survival is at stake.
Lanphier resigned several wbeks
ago as vice president of the Con
vair division of General Dynamics
Corporation in protest against
President Eisenhower's defense
policies.
Could Be Stronger
In his keynote speech at the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness first annual alumni confer
ence, Lanphier said that the U.S.
could be a stronger military pow
er than the Soviet Union within
three months "if wo wanted to."
Lanphier commented on recent
statements by Undersecretary of
State Dillon that the U.S. will not
be bluffed out on Berlin:
"Khrushchev knows that we are
physically weaker now than we
were a year ago. We are more
forced now to use nuclear weap
ons than a year ago when the
President said that we could not
meet the Berlin situation with the
conventional weapons available."
Lanphier said that a time may
come when we will have to resort
to nuclear war or surrender.
U.S. Will Be Cause
"I believe that if there is a
nuclear war the U.S. will start it
out of desperation because we
haven't taken care of the alterna
tives," he said.
Lanphier said that the key to
victory is the attitude of the peo
ple: "If Khrushchev knows that
we are willing to die as a nation
over a matter of principle," he
said, "then obviously we will not
have to die."
Lanphier told defense budget
needs. He said that to make our
defense program adequate it
would cost "4'ii billion in fiscal
'61, 10 billion in '62 and 13 or 14
billion in '63."
The total budget increase could
be lower than these figures, he
explained, if we cut out "expen
sive weapons systems which are
not relative to the situation."
Boniarc Is 'Archaic'
He cited the army's Nike-Zeus
anti-missile missile ("it isn't go
ing to do the job in time") and
the air force Bomarc ("archaic").
Lanphier also complained that
the Polaris, a Navy missile being
developed for submarine launch
ing by Lockheed, "will impress
the American public but will not
impress Khrushchev."
What the U.S. needs to develop,
he said, are more conventional
weapons that can be used in a
limited war.
Lanphier also accused Eisen
hower of not living up to his
campaign promises: "In 1932 Ei
senhower said that it was time to
orient our defense ideas toward
definite goals but he has done
none of this in the last seven
years and he is culpable for that!"
Civil Defense
Lanphier criticized the way the
U.S. has fallen behind Russia in
civil defense. "Anyone who Ivis
riddeji the escalator down to the
Moscow underground cathedrals
that they call subways must have
it in his mind that this is an ef
fective civil evacuation system." i
He said that we are not intel
lectually or physically prepared
for mass evacuations or mass
losses.
Lanphier said that the intelli
gence that we receive is not re
lated to the defense budget. "We
have used exactly the same rigid
budget division for the last 8
years."
