## Rhee Plans Changes in Government 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea (A } ) -
President Syngman Rhee took on
one of tho biggest jobs of his 83
years yesterday with a pledge of
fundamental changes to purify
South Korea's politics and gov
ernment..
Rhee renounced the leadership
of the ruling Liberal party, his
now discredited political machine,
and proposed to run the nation as
a nonpartisan chief executive.
Issues Statement
Under pressure at home and
abroad to give his 23 million peo
ple more democracy, Rhee issued
a 700-word statement promising
changes to promote an honest, ef
ficient and just administration.
There were indications that pri
ority will go to reform of Rhee's
much criticized national police
force.
Rhee's statement was his first
major attempt toward easing the
crisis which has troubled South
Korea since police shot nearly
1,000 youthful demonstrators to
quell a violent antigovernment
demonstration last Tuesday. The
toll is officially listed at 128 per
sons dead and 777 wounded.
Expresses Sorrow
Rhee expressed sorrow over the
"Bloody Tuesday" slaughter. But
he side-stepped any direct per
sonal responsibility for it or the
unrest in his nation.
He ignored the widespread
charge that his Liberal party
rigged the March If) presidential
elections returning him to tho
fourth term and electing his No. 1
party deputy, Lee Ki-poong, to
the vice-presidency. He gave no
sign that he intended to become
just a figurehead chief of state.
Without referring to reports
that he would put a premier in
charge, he set about creating a
new Cabinet to replace the minis
ters who stepped down after the
crisis erupted. He said he wanted
to take the administration com
pletely out of politics.
Correct l'ast Mistakes
"Public servants then will be
able to carry out their duties hon
estly and in complete fairness,"
he said. "Thus can we correct the
mistakes of the past and assure
Korea of efficient and corruptlcss
administration.
Outgoing Vice President John
M. Chang, a leader of the opposi
tion Democrats, was critical.
He said Rhee was for the first
time acknowledging there had
been imperfections in his admin
istration. Chang declared the na
tion is waiting for "deeds, not
words." He called again for a new
election.
Vice President-elect Lee. target
of the antigovernment demonstra
tions, announced he will retire
eventually from public life.
Small antigovernment demon
strations were reported yesterday
in four cities.
