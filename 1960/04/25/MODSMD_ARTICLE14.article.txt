Legislature chose last Thursday night to let the Stanford stu
dent hod\ decide in this week's election if it wants to afTiliate with
the National Student Association.
One of the main reasons given for Legislature's own stand
against the \SA was the apparent lack of student interest in such
an organization and the work that it does.
I his was a denial, then, of student concern with the disclaimer
affidavit, sit-in strikes, the draft, federal aid to ed neat ion and other
such issues which all'eet and should concern a great number of
students and which the NSA has dealt with.
The forthcoming referendum may prove Legislature wrong
and indicate that Stanford students are interested in more than
the next midterm or Happy Hour. Or it may show that Legislature
was right in thinking that most of the Stanford student bod\ rarelv
concern themselves with anything above the usual humdrum of
college life.
