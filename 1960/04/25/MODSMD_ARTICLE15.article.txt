# NOT NEEDED
## Representation Lack Cited As NSA Rejection Reason 
### Al Kahn 
This week we will bo asked to
vote to decide whether or not
Stanford should re-affiliate with
the National Student Association.
I am opposed to such a move.
Although the NSA provides a
number of services to many col
leges and universities—both in
the realm of student government
and in international activities—
for Stanford, it would merely be a
spokesman on a national level.
But, it would be speaking for us
without our having an active part
in determining what policies its
officers represent.
The services offered by NSA
are designed primarily for small
er colleges and would be of little,
if any, use to Stanford; this is so
only because our University and
student body is of sufficient size
to be able to establish on our own
what NSA does for others.
As for the NSA travel pro
grams, we can avail ourselves of
the opportunities afforded even
though we are not a member
school.
Will the NSA represent the
"needs," "feelings" and "opinions"
of Stanford students, as some
maintain? NSA advocates fail to'
point out the manner in which
we would "contribute" to setting
the policies that guide the NSA
officers.
At the National Congress, held
each summer, we would have six
votes out of some 800. Thus, al
most 9,000 Stanford students
would be represented by six votes
(approximately .0075 of the total
votes) in deciding the NSA
policies.
These policies would be sub
ject to the interpretation of the
national officers and the National
Executive Council. In addition,
the Council composed of approx
imately 30 students might enact
any emergency policies it sees fit;
this means that Stanford might
be completely deprived of a voice
in setting the policies.
Nevertheless, by virtue of our
membership in the Association,
we would be attributed with sup

porting all of its stands on all is
sues.
The advocates of NSA have two
ways of justifying this meager
i representation.
First they point out that United
! States Congress members have
, many more constituents than our
j six delegates would have. But this
j analogy and attempted justifica
tion fail because:
1. The U.S. Congress is not a
t body to represent opinions but
to legislate for the welfare of
those people it represents.
2. 7"he U.S. Congress is in ses
sion for at least half of every
year and does not merely set
broad policies to be intepreted by
the Executive branch.
3. Most important, the U.S. Con
gross has as its goal the maxi
mum good for all people, where
as the NSA cannot claim any such
goal because of the great diversity
of student interest and opinion.
Secondly, the various associa
tions of doctors, lawyers, bankers,
accountants, etc.. and the unions
. of workers in various industries
are cited as being similar to the
NSA. Their leaders are not ac
tually on the same level as their
j members any more than NSA of
ficers are still students.
But in the case of the former,
again they are working for the
common concerns and goals of
j their members, and in many
j cases, will return to their ranks
after their term of office.
The NSA officers, on the other
hand, in most instances cannot
claim to represent a solid or even
j strong block of opinion, and soon
become professional lobbyists for
their own and the National Exe
cutive Council's views.
In summary, ihe National Stu
dent Association is not needed by
Stanford for the services and as
| sistance it provides on a campus,
! and it certainly cannot claim to
be truly representative of a great
diversity of student opinion.
I submit, therefore, that it
would be a mistake for Stanford
to re-affiliate with NSA and
j would urge you to vote against
! it in the referendum on Wednes-
I dav and Thursday.

But, it would be speaking for us
without our having an active part

The services offered by NSA
are designed primarily for small
er colleges and would be of little,
if any, use to Stanford; this is so
only because our University and
student body is of sufficient size
to be able to establish on our own
what NSA does for others.
As for the NSA travel pro
grams, we can avail ourselves of
the opportunities afforded even
though we are not a member
school.
Will the NSA represent the
"needs," "feelings" and "opinions"
of Stanford students, as some
maintain? NSA advocates fail to'
point out the manner in which
we would "contribute" to setting
the policies that guide the NSA
officers.
At the National Congress, held
each summer, we would have six
votes out of some 800. Thus, al
most 9,000 Stanford students
would be represented by six votes
(approximately .0075 of the total
votes) in deciding the NSA
policies.
These policies would be sub
ject to the interpretation of the
national officers and the National
Executive Council. In addition,
the Council composed of approx
imately 30 students might enact
any emergency policies it sees fit;
this means that Stanford might
be completely deprived of a voice
in setting the policies.
Nevertheless, by virtue of our
membership in the Association,
we would be attributed with sup

porting all of its stands on all is
sues.
The advocates of NSA have two
ways of justifying this meager
i representation.
First they point out that United
! States Congress members have
, many more constituents than our
j six delegates would have. But this
j analogy and attempted justifica
tion fail because:
1. The U.S. Congress is not a
t body to represent opinions but
to legislate for the welfare of
those people it represents.
2. 7"he U.S. Congress is in ses
sion for at least half of every
year and does not merely set
broad policies to be intepreted by
the Executive branch.
3. Most important, the U.S. Con
gross has as its goal the maxi
mum good for all people, where
as the NSA cannot claim any such
goal because of the great diversity
of student interest and opinion.
Secondly, the various associa
tions of doctors, lawyers, bankers,
accountants, etc.. and the unions
. of workers in various industries
are cited as being similar to the
NSA. Their leaders are not ac
tually on the same level as their
j members any more than NSA of
ficers are still students.
But in the case of the former,
again they are working for the
common concerns and goals of
j their members, and in many
j cases, will return to their ranks
after their term of office.
The NSA officers, on the other
hand, in most instances cannot
claim to represent a solid or even
j strong block of opinion, and soon
become professional lobbyists for
their own and the National Exe
cutive Council's views.
In summary, ihe National Stu
dent Association is not needed by
Stanford for the services and as
| sistance it provides on a campus,
! and it certainly cannot claim to
be truly representative of a great
diversity of student opinion.
I submit, therefore, that it
would be a mistake for Stanford
to re-affiliate with NSA and
j would urge you to vote against
! it in the referendum on Wednes-
I dav and Thursday.
This week we will bo asked to
vote to decide whether or not
Stanford should re-affiliate with
the National Student Association.
I am opposed to such a move.
