Editor's Note: This is the last
of a series of articles on the sit
in strikes against segregation
hy students of the South

In the beginning of March, Ne
gro students throughout Atlanta
pledged their support of passive
sit-in strikes to protest segrega
tion.
They signed a declaration of
students' intentions which was
printed as a full-page advertise
ment in Atlanta papers.
The statement, in its entirety, is
posted on the blackboard of the
table on Engineering Corner for
the collection of funds to aid in
the legal defense of students ar
rested in the sit-in demonstra
tions.
It says, in part:
The Statement
". . . . We must say in all candor
that we plan to use every legal
and non-violent means at our dis
posal to secure full citizenship
rights as members of this great
democracy of ours.
. . We pledge our unqualified
support of those .students in this
nation who have recently been en
gaged in the significant move
ment to secure certain long
awaited rights and privileges.
". . . We do not intend to wait
placidly for those rights which
are already legally and morally
ours to be meted out to us one at
a time.
. . The time has come for the
people of Atlanta and Georgia
. . . to stop believing those who
tell us that everything is fine and
equal, and that the Negro is
happy and satisfied. . . ."
The declaration protested seven
areas of "inequalities and in
justices in Atlanta and Georgia"
—education, housing, jobs, voting,
hospitals, law enforcement, mov
ies, concerts and restaurants.
Georgia's Governor Ernest Van
dive, upon reading the declara
tion, stated:
. . It did not sound like it
was prepared in any Georgia
school or college; nor, in fact, flirt
it read like it was written even
in this country.
"This left-wing statement is cal
culated to breed dissatisfaction,
discontent, and discprd and evil."
He called the students's charges
false and hypocritical.
Collections
Several organizations have been
sel up to help in the collection of
funds for the defense of the ar
rested students in Atlanta and
elsewhere, including the Congress
of Racial Equality (CORE), the
National Student Association, the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and the National Stu
dent Christian Federation.
In today's South, Negroes con
stitute as much as half of the
total purchasing power of particu
lar communities. In the North,
Negro purchasing power may be
relatively less significant in par
ticular cities, but in tlie aggre
gate, in is greater than it is in
the South.
Picketing non-segregated stores
of c+mins which discriminate in
their Southern branches has been
carried out against F. W. Wool
worth Company, S. H. Kress Com
pany. S. S. Kresge and W. T.
Grant Company.
Store Policies
The stores have stated that they

will continue segregation or if
necessary close their lunch coun
ters until Southern public opinion
agreed to a change.
It has been felt that economic
pressure applied elsewhere might
effect Southern opinion.
The chain stores are owned na
tionally by •stockholders, and al
though most buying and store
policies are set by personnel-at
the regional or local levels, the
national office and its Finance
and Policy Commission do have
the power to change Southern
lunch counter policies.
Company employees receive fix
ed salaries and are not injured by
loss of business. Store managers
receive a base salary which varies
from store to store (minimum
$6,500) and which is supplement
ed by a share in profits. This
supplement is affected to some
degree by a reduction in business.
Successful and peaceful inte
gration has occured in such cities
as Houston and Baltimore.
Picketing here is being or
ganized by the YYVCA. Rides leave
daily from the .Women's Club
house at 12 noon for the Stanford
Shopping Center. Students will
return in time for 1:15 classes.
