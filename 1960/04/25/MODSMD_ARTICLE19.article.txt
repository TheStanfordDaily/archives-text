Spiritual Purity
Editor, the Daily:
Spirited by a letter to Dr. Camp
bell, our fondest dream is to some
day pick up the Daily and find:
STANFORD IN VATICAN
Alfred R. Lynch
Acting God
. Puzzled as to the meaning of
the term "mental integrity," Web
ster informed us that Mr. Lynch
was really saying "spiritual pur
ity."
In less pedantic language his
words would then read: "Yet
there are those who would bring
about Ihe destruction of their
spiritual purity by false appeals
to 'unfettered search for iriilh,'
unfettered, that is, by any basic
concept of morality or the spirit
ual) iy of mankind."
We, "the vast majority," agree,
Mr. Lynch.
We, "the vast majority," must
"remain" spiritually pure.
We, "the vast majority." must
nol think freely.
We, "the vast majority," must
be fettered to "decent literature."
May Lynch's Law last long.

Not Representative
Editor, the Daily:
If LASSU is going to take a
stand on capital punishment,
loyalty oaths, or the Union of
South Africa, then I submit that
the voters in the coming ASSU
elections have the right to know
the beliefs of the candidates for
LASSU on these issues.
Further, since new political is
sues will inevitably arise during
the next year, and as party affilia
tion furnishes at least a rough
guide as to how a person will vote
on such issues, these voters have
a right to know the party prefer
ences of the candidates.
I have no objection in principle
to campus organization taking ac
tion with respect to national po
litical issues. However, any action
of LASSU will he interpreted as
Ihe action of ihe student body,
and I would deny that LASSU. as
long as its members are selected
in non-partisan elections in which
ihe personal popularity and cam
pus issues both outweigh political
issues, is necessarily representa
tive of the student body on na
tional and international political
issues.
