## 'Grand Strategists' Plan For Inevitable Conflicts 
### Joel Meister HR Political Analyst 
ICriitni-'s Note: A second ar
ticle will follow next week on
planning for peace.

"Relaxation of tension" has
been the catch-phrase of diplo
mats for many months now. The
coming summit meeting will eith
er add an aura of truth to the
statement or prove it mere propa
ganda. Therefore hopes for some
sort of co-existence and belief in
the evitability of war face a vigor
ous, if not conclusive, trial.
Only in the last two months has
a definite, three-point agenda
been evolved. It includes Berlin,
disarmament, and nuclear wea
pons testing.
However, one must wonder how
well prepared our government is
to discuss and to plan for arms
control and for nuclear tests con
trol, how well prepared it is to
[plan for -peace rather than for
war.
There is a notable presence
these days of that hybrid strain
jof scientists known as "grand
strategists." They are actively en
gaged in exploring the feasibility
of thermonuclear war, and, hav
ing found it to be feasible, in plan
ning for one.
For example, Herman Kahn,
one of these grand strategists, has
recently toured the country, lec
turing on this subject of feasi
bility, on deterrence, and on plan
ning. His lectures, although off
the record, have been published
in substance in the Stanford Re
search Institute Journal (fourth
i quarter, 1959) and in a booklet
by his employer, the RAND Corp
; oration.
The basic premises of the grand
strategists are that war becomes
less preposterous the more prepos
terous we think it to be; that
Americans in general are willing

to kill 500 million non-Americans
to prevent a surprise attack on
this country; that genetic prob
lems following a war would he
relatively insignificant; and, that
we must plan now for 1975 in an
effort to anticipate the Soviet
Union.
In effect, the grand stategists
assume that war, as a Western
tradition, is probably here to stay.
Satisfied that total annihilation i-s
not possible, they feel eminently
justified in recommending to Con
gress and to the executive branch
that national policy be structured
about the use of war as a political
implement.
Much money from the defense
budget is used to support the
giand strategists. The Air Force
sponsors research through the
RAND Corporation; the Army
through the Office of Research
Operations at John Hopkins Uni
versity; and the Joint Chiefs of
Staff support the Institute for
Defense Analyses.
