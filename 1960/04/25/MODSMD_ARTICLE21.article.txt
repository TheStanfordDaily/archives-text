Stanford students have been
presented with the opportunity of
establishing a student exchange
with Moscow State University.
In reply to a letter written last
fall by Peter Grot he, author of
"To Win the Minds of Men." the
secretary of the Student Soviet
wrote, "It is very pleasing to us
that the students of Stanford Uni
versity want to establish friendly
relations and correspondence with
Moscow University."
At the LASSU meeting of April
21, a resolution was passed ap
proving an exchange of "student
correspondence and ideas." The
resolution also states that "we be
lieve the person to person contact
can do much to enhance our under
standing of our respective coun
tries and their peoples."
The Affiliations Department of
the Institute of International Re
lations has been requested by
LASSU to proceed in establishing
an affiliation with Moscow U.
Such an affiliation, and the result
ing exchange would be unique
among American universities.
