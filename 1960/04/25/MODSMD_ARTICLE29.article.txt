# CRISIS IN COLLEGE
## 
### 
•"The university in
America is not a community
of scholars, but an enormous
service station ... where one
can be born, go to kinder
garten, lower school, high
school, meet the girl friend
and get married . .
• "If students were limited
to those who were interested
in learning to think for
themselves... approximately
fifty per cent of our college
and university students
would disappear."
You can't afford to miss the
shocking report from which
these statements are taken.
It is written by a famous
educator in the new issue of
McCall's. It may be the
most important—and damn
ing—article ever published
on the subject, and every
student concerned with her
future will want to read it.
May McCall's, on sale now.
