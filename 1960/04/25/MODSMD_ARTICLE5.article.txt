## 
### Ron Rapoport 
HAYWARD FIELD, Eugene, Ore. Five-thousand pleading University of Oregon fans watched
in thundrous ecstacy here Saturday as Dyrol Burleson ran a perfect race to crack the four-minute
mile and beat Stanford's Ernie Cunliffe.
The 19-year-old sophomore thus destroyed even the slightest possibility that he is not the best
American miler in history. His time of 3:58.6 is a new U.S. record, breaking Don Bowden's old mark

i of 3:58.7.
Cunliffe's final time was 4:00.4,
which is the third fastest mile
ever run by an American and
which qualifies him for the 1500
1 meters in the Olympics.
The rest of the Oregon team
took Iho cue from Burleson and
' proceeded to administer the worst
|dual meet defeat lhat Stanford
has suffered in several years. The
'final tally was 87-44.
Burleson's race was run to per
fection. His usual strategy is to
let his opponent take Ihe lead,
follow closely behind until the
last straightaway and then use
his tremendous finishing kick to
leave his adversary in. the dust.
Cunliffe Takes Lead
Thus Cunliffe took Ihe lead
1 from the beginning and ran 1,650
yards with Burleson close behind
throughout. Burleson passecf the
I Tribe co - captain on the last
, straightaway and won by 10
i yards.
Cunliffe's time for the first lap
! was 62.5 and his 880 clocking was
1 2:02. The runners finished the
I third lap with Cunliffe not more
I than a whisker ahead, and when
1 the field announce]' said that the
j three-lap time was about 3:01, the
[crowd came to its feet with a
| roar.
Didn't Slacken Pace
Cunliffe didn't slacken his pace
I at all the fourth time around, so
when Burleson caught him on the
! final straightaway and sprinted
! home, the fans knew that the time
1 was sensational.
However, it look fully five min
utes before any of them knew
what the actual time was, because
the noise that greeted the first
| digit of the announcement of
! B u r 1 e s o n ' s time successfully
drowned out the rest of it.
For the Oregon fans it was a
day of jubilant satisfaction; a
day of potential realized. For
Burley, the national high school
| champion: Burley, the national
freshman champion; Burley, the
, Pan-American Games champion;
Burley, the pride of all Oregon,
ran his four-minute mile! Fill-
I fillment.
Burley Is King
No loyal Oregonian has any
thing left to live for. Each of them
can now die happily. Burley did
■ it and no matter what happens in
j his upcoming meetings with Aus
tralia's Herb Elliot (possibly in
the Fresno Relays, but certainly
in Rome), in Oregon, Burley is
king.
Norm Lloyd finished third in
the race for the Indians and Stan
ford's Jeff Evans and Oregon's
I Wiicey Winchell started, but took
h couple of looks at the front
runners' pace, and dropped out.
Almost lost in the shuffle was
Oregon pole vaulter Phil Paquin,
j who topped 14-6 in the meet and
qualified for the Olympic trials.
Darl McAllister took second in the
| vault for the Ducks at 13-6 and
Stanford's Dave Merchant took
third ;it 13-0.
Overall the Indians only got
! four first places; the shot put,

The rest of the Oregon team
took Iho cue from Burleson and

has suffered in several years. The
'final tally was 87-44.
Burleson's race was run to per
fection. His usual strategy is to
let his opponent take Ihe lead,
follow closely behind until the
last straightaway and then use
his tremendous finishing kick to
leave his adversary in. the dust.
Cunliffe Takes Lead
Thus Cunliffe took Ihe lead

yards with Burleson close behind
throughout. Burleson passecf the

1 2:02. The runners finished the
I third lap with Cunliffe not more
I than a whisker ahead, and when

Cunliffe didn't slacken his pace

what the actual time was, because
the noise that greeted the first

Jerry Winters took the shot
with a winning toss of 55-10.
Lloyd won the SSO with 1:53.0.

HAYWARD FIELD, Eugene, Ore. Five-thousand pleading University of Oregon fans watched
in thundrous ecstacy here Saturday as Dyrol Burleson ran a perfect race to crack the four-minute
mile and beat Stanford's Ernie Cunliffe.
The 19-year-old sophomore thus destroyed even the slightest possibility that he is not the best
American miler in history. His time of 3:58.6 is a new U.S. record, breaking Don Bowden's old mark

i of 3:58.7.
Cunliffe's final time was 4:00.4,
which is the third fastest mile
ever run by an American and
which qualifies him for the 1500
1 meters in the Olympics.
The rest of the Oregon team
took Iho cue from Burleson and
' proceeded to administer the worst
|dual meet defeat lhat Stanford
has suffered in several years. The
'final tally was 87-44.
Burleson's race was run to per
fection. His usual strategy is to
let his opponent take Ihe lead,
follow closely behind until the
last straightaway and then use
his tremendous finishing kick to
leave his adversary in. the dust.
Cunliffe Takes Lead
Thus Cunliffe took Ihe lead
1 from the beginning and ran 1,650
yards with Burleson close behind
throughout. Burleson passecf the
