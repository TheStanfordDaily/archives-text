# EPISCOPAL BISHOP
## Candidates Should Put God Before Church, Says Pike 
### Rich Brown 
"It is proper for the Roman Catholic Church to take a stand on
birth control. But I want to know, when voting, if that stand is
binding on a candidate for President."
Thus spoke the Rt. Rev. James A. Pike, Episcopal Bishop of
California, to a Stanford Law Forum audience Friday on "Church,

State and Politics."
The Bishop felt that presiden
tial candidates' religion should
not control a voter's decision but
that Americans should consider
how much a candidate will let his
religion influence him in office.
Religious Influence
"If I were on a Senate commit
tee passing on cabinet officers, I
would not vote against a Christian
Scientist for Secretary of Health
or a Quaker for Secretary of De
fense solely because of their
church affiliation," he said.
"But if they were of the
orthodox beliefs, I would want
to reverse them."
The Bishop, however, does not
believe that candidates should
compartmentalize their views on
church and state.
Rev. Pike's ideal candidate is
one who places God® and con
science above both church and
state, rather than compartmental
izing. placing state above church,
or church over state.
Dissenting Catholics
The Bishop noted that while
the traditional Catholic approach
is that church and state should
be one. there is a dissenting view,
held by many American Catholics,
which favors a pluralistic society
in which the rights of all are
protected.
Rev. Pike praised Sen. Eugene
McCarthy (D-Minn.i as a good
example of a Catholic with the
"American" view. All Jews and
Christians should bo concerned
over social conditions, the Bishop
•said, adding that "concern is more
important than agreement."
• When South Africa's govern
ment ordered the churches to be
segregated, the Episcopal Church
ordered its priests to disobey the
government. "The highest alle
gience is God, not the nation," he
said.
Noting that the Episcopal
Church stresses planned parent
hood, Rev. Pike termed Connecti
cut's anti-birth control law as an
interference with religion.
Rev. Pike, originally a Roman
Catholic, attended Santa Clara as
an unrlegraduato, finished at USC
Law School and was admitted to
the California Bar in 1936. He has
worked with the American Law
Institute and as an attorney for
the Securities Exchange Commis
sion.
He has been "practicing in a
higher Jurisdiction" since 19.">2
when he became dean of the
Cathedral St. John the Divine in
New York City.
