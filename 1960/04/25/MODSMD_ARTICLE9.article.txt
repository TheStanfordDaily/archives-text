# Flans Advance For Far East Study Centers
## 
### 
Establishment of Stanford study centers in Tokyo and Hong
Kong is being considered by the University, Albeit Bowker, dean
of the graduate division announced Friday.
Discussion of plans "which are still in the early stages," Dr.
Bowker stated, "is geared to the establishment of centers for grad-

uate students and advanced un
dergraduates who have special
interest in Japan and Asia which
makes residence in the Far East
an important part of their train
ing and research."
The decision to open such study
| centers will hinge greatly on stu-
I dent interest and financial sup-
I port from outside the University.
The University will move imme
diately to seek financial aid for
the venture. Dr. Bowker said, but
j "the students themselves must
prove i<j us that such centers are
desired and would be utilized."
No Dates Announced
No tentative dates for the open
! ing have been announced.
The possibility of Far East cen
ters for undergraduates under the
{ General Studies Program has not
I been ruled out. Establishment of
operations similar to those in
Stuttgart, Florence, and Tours
could come after initial programs
for students specializing in Far
Eastern affairs.
Announcement of the move to
seek financial aid follows a .sur
vey trip to Tokyo and Hong Kong
