SOME UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
ABOUT NSA...
Directed to both candidates for ASSU President and to
those who may be voting on NSA affiliation in tomorrow's
election
What real benefits will Stanford student's receive from
our affiliation with the National Student's Association
(NSA) ?
Will any of the benefits received by the six delegates sent
to one annual conference at a cost of $1500 be able to
"trickle down'' to the mass of Stanford students?
Since $1500 spent on MR and Political Union could
roughly double their activities, couldn't the money better
be spent in this way to bring political figures and issues
to the attention of Stanford students at Stanford?
Has the NSA purged itself fully of those elements and
practices which have caused Stanford to disaffiliate twice
in the past? 5
Do we, asstudents, want the nameof our university linked
with resolutions on political and semi-political issues
which we have only a small voice in passing?
Finally, if we still feel favorably inclined toward NSA,
can't the issue be decided better after a thorough investi
gation (such as that proposed by one candidate for ASSU
President) than by a hasty, largely emotional choice?
