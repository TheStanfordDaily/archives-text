# Socialist States Russia Barbarous, Terroristic
## Baran Refutes Draper's Claim 
### Bill Reppy 
Democratic socialist Hal Drap
or accused (he USSR of "intensi-1
tying the domination of man over
man to new heights of barbarism"
as ho spoke in a debate last night.
The totalitarian Russian state has
employed torture, fake trials,
mass terror, and the annihilation
of entire nations in its rapid in
dustrialization. said Draper. "This
is not progress."
"Resolved: that the USSR is a '
progressive nation" was the prop* [
osition debated. Draper took the!
negative and Stanford professor]
of economics, Paul Baran, the af
firmative.
Greatest Growth
Baran pointed to Russia's great
strides in education and literacy
as well as effective industrializa
tion under the socialist motives of
advancement rather than the cap
italist motive of profit-making.
Progress, said Baran, is the j
greatest possible growth of hu
man potential, and looking in!
terms of potentiality, Russian so
cialism offers higher potentiali
ties for improvement of society j
than capitalism.
Draper defined progress as the!
abolishing domination of nature
over man in order to abolish domi- j
nation of man over man. "In the
USSR the masses have been con
demned to work beasts," he said.
"Factory conditions for the Rus
sian laborer are worse than those
of the lowest peon in the United
States."
Bureaucracy Needed
Draper said the Russian regime
has "nothing in common" with so
cialism. "It is the greatest de
stroyer of social ideas."
Baran maintained that Russia
is still "in a revolutionary situa
tion" and is not a bureaucracy.!
What this unpredictable govern
ment in Russia needs is the
crystalization of a bureaucracy.
Draper, on Ihe contrary, called
the communist regime a new type
of police state bureacracy. "A
permanent purge keeps it in fer
ment within its totalitarian struc
ture," he said.
Howard Richards, moderator of
the debate, said in his introduc
tion that the problem of the world
today is not to choose between
capitalism and socialism, but to
determine what type of socialism
is best for undeveloped countries.
