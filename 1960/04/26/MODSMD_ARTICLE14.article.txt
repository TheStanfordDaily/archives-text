# A 						Continuing Trend
## 
### 
The recently released Winter Quarter gra<le point averages
indicate a trend which, although surprising to some, is the result
of much planning and effort.
The all-fraternity average, for the first time in history, was
higher than the all-men's average, the comparison heing 2.."> I to
2.. r >2.
Another result shown b\ the averages is that the bottom house's
a\erage was the highest that the twenty-fourth house has ever
acquired, and the top house's average is one o! the all-time highs
for the How.
This trend is noteworthy in that behind it lies an active interest
on the Row to improve fraternities' academic standing. A few
facts can show good reason why these averages were not accidental
hut are to he expected and continued.
Three houses on the Row have formed a joint scholarship
committee to assist 'members who are having academic difficulties.
Similar programs have been initiated within several other indi
\ idual fraternities.
K.leven fraternities now have faculty advisers and several more
are in the process of acquiring them.
Tonight, the pledge classes of three fraternities will, at the
request of the houses, he spoken to b\ a Stanford professor on
the importance of maintaining high academic standards.
And, most important, there is a growing realization on the Row
that grades and studying are an important part of fraternity life
and not merely a by-product.
On many campuses over the country, the most attractive fea
ture fraternities offer prospective pledges is a high grade point
average, litis practice is increasingly evident at Stanford as
rushees are becoming more interested in averages, and fraterni
ties see that thev must make a good standing to attract mam
freshmen.
This, however, is not the time for fraternities to rest on their
laurels. The fraternity average can continue to outdistance the
all-men's average; hut 'to do this the houses have to continue to
put forth the effort which brought the results of last quarter. This
accomplishment will require the full encouragement of the Inter
lraternity Council and the realization b\ every house that fra
ternities must maintain the academic standards of the rest of the
I niversitv.
