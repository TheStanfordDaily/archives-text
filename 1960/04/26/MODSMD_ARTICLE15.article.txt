One of the main problems fac
ing European students today is
disease, particularly the dreaded
tuberculosis. So-called University
Sanatoriums have sprung up
throughout Europe, where stu
dents and faculty are treated ex
clusively.
One such sanatorium was
founded by the German Students
Welfare Service at St. Blasien in
the Black Forest in 1956. Out of
102 full treatments, 98 produced
such good results that the pa
tients could be released.
Why are students particularly
prone to the ravages of tubercu
losis? One reason is the horrid
economic condition of most of the
students, but the most important
factor seems to be psychological.
A medical report says: "In a
strikingly large number of our
patients we notice an inner con
flict. with their professional
and social spheres. This is due
to study over-straining, prepara
tion for examinations, disap
pointed ambition, professional
set-backs and so on, but in all
these cases disappointment is a
sign peculiar to them all.
"All these conflicts, which are
not seldom met with in healthy in
dividuals, had a great subjective
importance for all our patients,
in fact they were the central prob
lem for them.
"In spite of excellent self-con
fident outwardly appearances, we
found almost always an uncer
tainty and a fear of life in our stu
dent patients, which make them
look for security and support in
the outward circumstances of
life."
The report goes on to state that,
tiiis psychical condition haunts
students through their study.
"They want to fulfill as soon as
possible the necessary prereq
uisites for their material securi
ty, to pass their examinations
in the shortest possible time,
and do only what is useful to
achieve this and essential for
their later careers."

All this is clone at the expense
of an harmonic personality, the
report says. Such inner conflicts
lead to isolation and increases the
liability towards conflicts of all
kinds.
The result of so much inner
tension often is tuberculosis. The
discovery of tuberculosis means
an extraordinary trauma for the
students who contract it.
"Their studies," the same
medical report states, "are
planned up to the examination
beforehand, a detailed study
plan has been worked out, and
now due to the illness every
thing is questionable and their
inner security breaks down. Our
experiences have clearly shown
that the customary health cen
ter atmosphere, whose highest
principle is rest of the mind and
body, does not suffice for tin*
students.
"The longer a treatment lasts
all the more a mental vacuum is
created under which the student
suffers, consciously or not, in an
increasing degree.
"It has been shown that the
usual means of distraction like
radio, television, games, work
therapy, etc., is in no way ap
propriate for our young academ
icians," the report concludes.
Recognizing this situation, the
German Students Welfare Service
tried to bring about a fundamental
change by taking care of the in
tellects of the students during
treatment at the health centers.
This type of care of the stu
dents was expected to make the
students feel that the university
does not forget lliem during their
illness, that their education and
knowledge is improved upon in
keeping with their recovery, and
that support and direction will be
given for their future work.
The new method is doing
quite well but it fails to destroy
the root of the problem which
is the increasing number of
tuberculosis cases among Euro
pean students because of fear, a
fear of life.
