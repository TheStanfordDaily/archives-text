Sound Choice
Editor, the Daily:
The editor seems to imply that
a student's voting for LASSU to
.join the National Students' Asso
ciation equals interest in vital
issues of the day and that voting
not to join equals lack of concern.
He is wrong.
The Legislature contends that
there is lack of student interest in
"such an organization and the
work it does." However, this does
not necessarily imply lack of in
terest in tho issues of the day, as
the editor contends, but may
equally mean lack of interest in
a STUDENT ORGANIZATION as
the means to express opinions or
to take stands, etc.
That is, a student who is ex
ti-emely interested in and has an
opinion on important issues might
vote against joining the NSA for
many reasons, including the fol
lowing:
1. Disagreement with past
stands of the NSA.
2. The belief that existing stu
dent election proceedures (sic)
and political structures are in
adequete (.sic) to express corectly
(sic) student opinion on national
issues to Stanford's NSA repre
sentatives and the recognition
that even these proceedures (sic)
and structures are changed.
3. Stanford opinion would be in
adequetely (sic) represented in
the NSA. .
4. A belief that existing and
more desirable organizations are
an adequete (-sic) outlet for stu
dent opinion, i.e., Young Repub
licans and Young Democrats.
5. The knowledge lhat the
money necessary to acquire many
of the "benefits" of the NSA could
better be spent elsewhere or not
spent at all.
6. The realization of the validity
of the additional points in Mr.
Kahn's article.
Thus I contend that a signifi
cant "no" vote against the NSA
would indeed evidence not a "hum
drum of existence" but a great in
terest in vital issues and a sound
political choice.

No Nonsense
Editor, tin* Daily:
After a week of often hectic
campaigning, I can now retreat
into the political obscurity from
which I came.
However, the issue whi c h
aroused me from an electrical cn-

Igineer's apathy about student
government the battle between
those who would have the ASSU
concern itself primarily with cam
pus issues and those who would
stress "cosmic issues" at Ihe ex
pense of campus affairs still has
not been settled.
Therefore, before leaving the
field of battlet or. more properly,
being carried from iti I want to
say a word for the only fellow
realist left in the race after the
smoke (or is it just hot air?) has
cleared.
While my favorite realist is,
and, I fear, will remain, A. Burns,
I feel that Larry Royse is a more
than acceptable alternative. His
stands on the important issues -
including the hotly disputed and
rather questionable NSA affilia
tion are reasonable and moder
ate, as is his approach to the
whole question of student govern
ment.
We are fortunate that there is
I a well qualified candidate left in
the race who can be supported by
I those who bolieve in the "no non
i sense" approach toward the
j ASSU.
