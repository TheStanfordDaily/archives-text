# Wycherley's 'Country Wife' Is Lively S.F. Production
## 
### Jerome W. Clinton 
The Interplayer's production of
"The Country Wife" at tho Bella
Union Theater, San Francisco,
provides a refreshing contrast to
current stage comedy. The situa
tions are funny, the action is
rapid, the dialogue is always brisk
and witty and t he whole is sus
tained by enough good sense to
keep it from degenerating into
idle wordplay.
William Wyeherley's work, as
with all Restoration comedy, is a
vigorous satire of the specious re
finement then current in English
and French society. During the
reign of Charles II virtue was in
everyone's mouth, but in no one's
action, and a comely appearance
and charming manners were so
cial virtues of such high repute
that they could successfully out
shine a multitude of private vices.
The central figure of the play
is Horner, a young rakehell who
has engaged the services of Dr.
Quack to spread the rumor that
he has been made impotent by his
late journey into France. Horner
thus hopes to gull the town's
fathers and husbands into permit
ting him free access to their
daughters and wives.
The chief subjects of his de
ception are Lord Fidget, an old,
jealous, but dull husband, and Mr.
Pinchwife, an aging lecher who
has married a simple country lass
in the vain hope that he can keep

her ignorant of the town women's
pleasures and vices.
The ease with which Horner
succeeds in his plot, to the delight
of the women and the unwitting
disgrace of their husbands, pro
vides the point and comedy of the
play.
The only two virtuous people
in the play are Alithea, Pinch
wife's sister, and Mr. Harcourt, a
boon companion of Horner who
gives up his easy ways to win
Alithea from the petty buffoon to
whom her brother has betrothed
her. These two admirable and
honestly mature people are, by
their very presence, the most tell
ing commentary on the absurdity
and vanity of the other char
acters.
The performance of Michael
Gordon as Horner is, unfortu
nately, the weakest part of the
production by Ihe Inter players.
His Horner is a youth of uncon
vincing sophistication whose man
ners border on affectation.
Mia Carlile is quite delightful as
the naive Mrs. Pinchwife whose
simplicity allows her to be the
only woman who speaks her de
sires frankly.
Tow Dowd, as Pinchwife, leans
too much toward caricature, yet
is very much the old bawd whose
own thoughts are for him the
surest proofs of society's vices,
and whose own folly is the mos't
certain means of cuckolding him.
