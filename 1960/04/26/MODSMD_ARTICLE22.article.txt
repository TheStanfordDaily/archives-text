A (»ood Weekend
There was a lot of fine performances by Stanford althletes
over (he weekend. Although Dyrol Burleson stole all the thunder
from Krilie Cunlil'fe's great 4:00.1 pace-selling mile, Krnie's mark
still qualifies him for the Olympic 1500 meter race adding another
even to the 880 meters for which he has already qualified. Now
comes the big decision . . . whether to run in the 800 meters- his
1:47.3 time in the 880 is the best in the nation or in the 1500
meters which his four minute performance ranks his second in
that event and third in all-time American mile times.
Over the rain-swept Sunken Diamond, Dutch Fehring's charges
came through in a great home stand whipping once-beaten SC and
rolling over the Bruins from Weslwood. After Jim Cowart's clutch
game-winnig double against the Trojans it looks like Cow-art wants
and will get back in that Card starting nine.
Yesterday afternoon this writer was over in the Practice Field
watching Stanford gridders start their third week of spring practice.

Already the Tribe is suffering
from that old bugaboo Mr. Injury
as quite a few gridders were seen
out on the sidelines with such in
terested spectators as Chris Bur
ford last season's Card grid
star, Don Klosterman Loyola's
great passing ace in the early
fifties and now scout for the Los
Angeles Chargers, and Hugh Me
lClhenney of the San Francisco
49ers.
Even when the injured Archie
Schmidt and Rod Sears return,
the first two Card teams will
have quite a few new faces this
season. Working on the sled and
other blocking drills were sopho
mores C. B. Simons and Chuck
Buehler, two big tackles from this
year's frosh team who will un
doubtedly be seeing a lot of action
behind Dean Hinshaw a sched
uled starter last seaon but was
lost early via an injury to the
Cards and big Phil Toorvakl—
who was a standout on the frosh
sriuad in '57 but has laved out the

last two seasons with a knee injury. Hinshaw also has been taking
it easy with his weakened knee and yesterday he gave his first
all-out performance of spring practice. Toorvald and Hindshaw may
give the Tribe the well-needed biggest tackle duo since John Wiggins
played in '56 for ihe Indians.
Of course the big question mark next year will be at ends and
Iwo more new faces have been seen there this spring. Vic Presier
- who played ball here way back in '56 has returned and looks
tough at the left end position. Hick Herney sometimes center,
sometimes end has the lead at the other wing with George Honore
the boy with probably the best hands of the trio -given a good
chance to break into the starting lineup.
Will the Line Hold Together?
At the guards, Tom Walsh standout sophomore guard last sea
son is back—as well as his fine teammate Ron Fernandes. But Fer
nandes was out again do to an injury and again the great concern
is whether Hon can hold together on his two braced knees all season.
John Butler—who say action last season—has a good shot at guard
as do several sophomores, such as center Starr Hounds, who may
be switched to the guard spot.
At quarteback again was Dirk Norman- who broke nearly all
the NCAA passing records last season and looks like he might be
heading for another big year. Hod Sears, out with an injury, will
probably back him up again.
The starting backfield might be returnees next season. Mac
Wylie looks like he may start in one of the back spots as does Archie
Schmidt and Skip Face. However Schmidt is out with a pulled
muscle and Face is out of school this quarter, so John Bcsscy and
(iil Dowd will see a lot of action this spring in the Tribe backfield.
Aside from scrimmages, the gridders are pointing towards their
traditional encounter with the Alumni which is tentatively scheduled
tor the 14th or 21st of May. The Alumni soundly whipped the team
last year and this year may be even toughter. Scheduled to appear
for the alumni this year will be Chris Burford, Dick Bowers and
Phil Burklund—from this season's team and such old-time greats
as Gary Corcoran, John Brodie, Bill McColl and many others.

Application forms are available for Student Police and Ticket
Takers for the 19G0 football season, in Room 11 for the Athletic
Department. Applications are also available for Ticket Takers for
