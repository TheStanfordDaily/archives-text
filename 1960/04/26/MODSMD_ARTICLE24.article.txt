# Card Crews Sweep Races With UCLA in Rain, Wind
## 
### 
The Stanford crew made a clean
sweep Saturday in downing UC
LA's frosh, JV and varsity crews.
All three victories were by consid
erable margins, hut for some un
known reason no times were
taken.
Despite the wind and rain the
Stanford crews looked good.
From Ihe start to the finish of
the two-mile-long race the Stan
ford teams were in command.
The varsity crew was rowing at
a low 27-count stroke and were
making the boat move very
smoothly. They kept this steady
stroke throughout most of the
race and never were threatened
by the UCLA crew.
The JV boat looked especially
good. Also rowing at a low
stroke Ihey were getting good dis
tance on each stroke. The margin
of victory in the JV race was
over 200 yards.
The frosh made it their fourth
in a row. The real test for- the
undefeated frosh will come next
week when they travel to Seattle
to meet the tough Washington
crew.
Stanford now moves into the
"big four" of its schedule. Next
week the crew travels to Seattle

I to meet the Huskies. The follow
i ins week the Indians host the Oal
crew at Redwood City. The fol
lowing two weeks Stanford trav
els south for the Harbach Cup
j race and the West Coast Sprint
Championship.
