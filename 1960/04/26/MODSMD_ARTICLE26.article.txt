Stanford's frosh tracksters had
an easy limo of ii Friday after
noon, as Coach Jim Terrill experi
mented freely with his charges in
preparation for their rematch
with the San Jose frosh this
Thursday. The Papooses trounced
Coalinga and Reed ley junior col
leges in a triangular competition,
scoring 91 1 •• to 34 Il> for the Reed
ley Tigers and 24 for the Falcons
from Coalinga.
Th e to p performance was
turned in by Dave Weill in the
discus throw. Weill has yet to be
defeated this year, and under
pressure of tough competition
from Coalinga's Joe Hnat and Bob
Pederson, he hurled the discus
lf>."V3", bettering his top previous
mark by three feet.
Shot putter Chuck Buehler also
rose to the occasion in compeli

lion with Pederson, and came up
with his season's best heave of
49'7 a i". In the high hurdles, Bill
Wandrey of the Papooses upset
Bill Batchelor with a wind-aided
time of 15.6 seconds.
Co-captain Ken Emanuols, nor
mally a 110 man, won the 220-
yard dash in 23.0 seconds against
the wind. The 100-yard dash pro
vided an oddity, as it had to be
run twice in its entirety. The first
running was a false start, but it
could not be called back because
(he starter's gun misfired. In the
end Bill Brinkworth of Coalinga
barely nipped Emanuels at the
tape, as both were timed in 10.1
seconds.
Phil White again reached 13'0",
topping the pole vaulters, while
Sheridan Downey broad jumped
22'G" to win. The mile relay team
of Bob Taylor, Batchelor, Jim Da
vis, and Emanuels ran a 3:22.0,
fastest time this year by the Pa
pooses.
Frank Wallace won the half
mile, Bob Holgerson took the
mile, Don Malcolm edged out Jim
Davis and Jeff Lombardi in the
440. and John Haynie won the
high jump to complete Stanford
domination of the meet.
