### 
The Stanford Brave baseball
team pocked three Moffett Field
pitchers yesterday, as the Braves
walloped the Flyers, 15-7. The
Stanford team scored seven times
in fourth inning to put the game
on ice.
Big hitter for the Braves was
third-sacker Rich F-errezzano who
smashed a tremendous home run
over the fence at Jet Field, and
also singled.
Brave hurler, Robbie McNitt
helped out his own cause with* a
three run triple smash in the fifth
inning. McNitt was the winning
pitcher, but was touched for 15
hits along the way.
The Braves started off with two
tallies in the first frame, the big
blow in that inning was a triple
by Roger Willet, scoring one run.
The Braves were helped out by
ton walks and three hit batsmen.
