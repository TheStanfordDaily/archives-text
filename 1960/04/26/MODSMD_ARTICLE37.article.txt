# Judge Gives Book To Law Library
## 
### 
A rare, two-volume edition of
a famous law book Montes
quieu's "The Spirt of the Laws"
has been presented to the Stan
ford Law Library by Federal
Judge Louis E. Goodman.
Goodman, who lives in Atherton
and is himself a connoisseur of
fine books, is chairman of the
Friends of the Stanford Law Li
brary, but made the gift on a
personal basis.
The books, dated 1748, are
bound in brown calf with a hand
tooled spine imprinted in gold
leaf.
"The* Spirit of the Laws" was
first published in Geneva in 1748.
It became a profound influence in
American political thinking dur
ing the founding of the United
States, although it is a studious
and reflective work rather than
a Revolutionary tract.
