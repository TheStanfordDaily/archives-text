# Khrushchev Warns West
## 
### 
MOSCOW (/Pi Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev told the West
ern powers yesterday they either
must sign a peace treaty with
Communist East Germany or
"forfeit the right of access to
West Berlin by land, water and
air."
Khrushchev made a major
speech at Bagku, in Soviet Azer
baijan. outlining what probably
will be a tough Soviet position
three weeks from now when the
Soviet, British. French and
American chiefs of government
meet at the summit in Paris. He
said the Soviet Union is ready to
meet "force with force" on the
Berlin issue.
The Soviet leader also made
these points:
1. The USSR will stick to its
position on the disarmament ques
tion to the end and "never shall
depart from it."
2. The powers must "recognize
the necessity of peaceful coexist
ence between states with capital
ist and Socialist Communist sys
tems and must build normal and
sound relations between them. Be
cause the other way means war."
3. II is time to end nuclear wea
pons tests and there is hope for
endng East-West differences on
this question, but "further pro
gress in talks on the termination
of nuclear tests depends on the
Western powers."
The United States already has
rejected the Khrushchev claim
that Moscow can deprive the
Western powers of their Berlin
rights, guaranteed by postwar
agreements growing out of the
Yalta and Potsdam conferences.
There was no official comment
at. once from the State Depart
ment in Washington. But officials
said privately Khrushchev ap
pealed to be issuing a warning of
unusual strength, timed to coin
cide with the meeting of President
Eisenhower with French Presi
dent Charles de Gaulle. They
pointed out this was the first lime
Khrushchev actually had openly
threatened that the Allies would
lose their land, sea and air rights
with regard to Berlin.
