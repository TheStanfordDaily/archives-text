TEHRAN, Iran (/P) - Rescue
workers sped by land and air yes
terday to the stricken southern
city of Ear and nearby villages,
leveled by two shattering earth
quakes. The Red Cross estimated
1 at least TOO died and thousands
I were injured in the disaster.
The two great shocks came four
hours apart Sunday and Lar, a
! city of 14.000. died in a choking
blinding cloud of dust from the
debris, officials on the scene re
ported.
Leveled at the same time was
i Gerash, a complex of villages
housing about 6,000 persons 15
miles south of Lar. Adding to the
horror, officals said, were poison
ous snakes. Roused from their
lairs by the shocks,, they attack
i Iranians trapped in the debris.
Rescue Workers
Rescue workers began arriving
i from Tehran, 550 miles north of
Lar, and from cities closer to the
; scene. Air force planes parachuted
in food and supplies.
Most of the victims were wom
en and children. The men were in
| the fields when the first shock
j about 4:15 p.m. toppled most of
Lar's buildings. The second shock
knocked down what was left of
; the city.
Officials at the scene had esti
mated as many as 2,000 perished,
but the Red Cross said these fig
ures were exaggerated in the ex
| citement.
Governor Tells Damage
Nosrat Qarib, governor of the
stricken district, said Lar was
wrecked.
"The town's strongest building
my own office has toppled,"
his first report said.
| He also appealed to Ihe army
for immediate help to recover
bodies. "Otherwise disease will
wipe out the rest of the homeless
population," he said.
The Shah of Iran received the
report minutes later and ordered
out his troops.
The United States was the first
foreign government to offer help
to the stricken city. It quickly
made 100 tons of flour available.
U.S. Sends Supplies
The U.S. Embassy here also
planned to fly a special plane to
Shira with medical supplies.
An emergency call was also dis
patched for snake bite serum.
Qarib said numerous snakes had
slithered into the wreckage and
bit those trapped in it. Many vic
tims rescued during the night and
morning were suffering from
snake bites.
Bodies recovered this morning
numbered 484. They were buried
| promptly. About 300 were young
sters who had gathered in schools
to watch a play for children's day
! ceremonies.
