### 
WASHINGTON (/Pi Presi
dent Eisenhower and French Pres
ident Charles de Gaulle agreed
yesterday to confront the Soviet
Union with a united stand on dis
armament. Berlin and controvers
ial Western-Communist aid proj
ects for underdeveloped countries.
The two Western leaders were
reported to have wiped out most
differences in their approach in a
round of presumrnit strategy
talks. They agreed to give top
priority to disarmament as offer

ing the main hope of easing East-
West tensions.
The White House, in making
public a communique ending their
meetings said both were fully
aware of Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev's newest threat to
close Allied sea, land and air
routes to West Berlin.
Eisenhower and De Gaulle kept
silent about Khrushchev's latest
demand for a separate peace
treaty with Communist East Ger
many. however.
Spokesmen for the two presi
dents stressed that if the Soviet
Union raises the Berlin issue at
the summit conference in Paris
May 16 the Allies will answer
with a solid joint position.
Ovation
The windup statement came a
few hours after De Gaulle urged
international control of "the vehi
cles of death" — missiles, planes
and ships. He said this was im
perative to save mankind from
the threat of nuclear obliteration.
A packed House chamber, in
cluding congressmen, senators.
Cabinet officers, diplomats and
spectators gave De Gaulle a thun
derous ovation in his formal, fare
well speech.
The ovation before and after he
spoke seemed more for De Gaulle
the man than for his ideas. House
Speaker Sam Rayburn (D-Tex. >
introduced him as a representative
of a great, proud and free people
—"who will remain free as long as
they have the leadership of this
man."
No Applause
De Gaulle drew no applause,
however, when he voiced anew his
controversial plan for a joint
Western-Communist aid plan for
what he called Ihe "unfavored
masses of Asia and the awaken
ing populations of Africa."
Eisenhower is reported to op
pose this project even though he
and the French leader are pic
tured as seeing eye-to-eye on
broad strategy for holding West
ern Berlin while focusing on the
quest for world disarmament.
De Gaulle was reported to have
dropped, at least for the time be
ing, another of his controversial
ideas • that of joint Communist
free world controls on arms ship
ment to Africa.
Until De Gaulle arrived, Eisen
hower was cool to both ideas, be
lieving they would unnecessarily
give the Soviet a voice in areas
where it now has little influence.
Pierre Baradue, French spokes
man, made it clear De Gaulle
would not join in any talks in
Paris on a possible East-West ban
on nuclear tests.
De Gaulle will visit the Stan
ford Medical Center Thursday as
part of his visit to San Francisco.
