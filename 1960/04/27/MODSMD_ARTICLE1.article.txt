# Tokyo Leftist Riot Over U.S. Security Pact
## 
### 
TOKYO (/I J ) Six thousand radical left-wing university students
tried to batter their way through massed police linos into tho Par
liament building yesterday in protest against Japan's new security
pact with the United States.
Members of the Zengakuren National Students Assn. were cheer-

od on by black-uniformed loaders.
Tho leaders exhorted the youths
to emulate South Korean students
who forced President Syngman
Rhee to bow to their demands for
reforms.
But the anti-American Japanese
students lacked both tho inspira
tion and mottle of the pro-Ameri
can Koreans.
Four Hour Battle
Baton-weilding policemen threw
back the massed assaults of tho
chanting, shouting young men and
women in a four-hour series of
shoving contests puneturated by
free-for-alls which left many faces'
bloodied.
At least 30 policement and more
than 100 demonstrators were in
jured.
Eighteen students, including
one of the leaders, were arrested.
Tho riot may be regarded as a
trial lost for demonstrations the
students plan when President Ei
senhower visits Japan in June.
The youths are members of the
radical wing of Zengakuren,
which was thrown out of the Com
munist party for its extreme pol
icies.
Protest Treaty
The group has staged repeated
protests against the military trea
ty, signed in Washington last Jan
uary and now up for ratification
by tho Japanese Diet.
Police rushed 6,000 riot force
men into the fray. Two thousand
others wore held in reserve, but
never used.
Bumper-to-bumper rows of po
lice cars and trucks barred tho
way of the mob into the building.
Disregarding police advice to go 1
home, tho -students charged the
police cordon. Some swung flag
staffs to topple officers from the
roofs of trucks. Others hurled
themselves on the police and fell
with them on top of the demon
strators below.
Police Take Action
The major police force let the
vanguard of the youths scale the
third row of trucks, then swung
into action.
They quickly broke up the
charge, using hands as much as
possible but sticks when neces-1
sary.
The main body of the students
fell back. Many of those.who
broke through were bleeding at
the nose and mouth as they were
led away by officers.

Eighteen students, including
one of the leaders, were arrested.
Tho riot may be regarded as a
trial lost for demonstrations the
students plan when President Ei
senhower visits Japan in June.
The youths are members of the
radical wing of Zengakuren,
which was thrown out of the Com
munist party for its extreme pol
icies.
Protest Treaty
The group has staged repeated
protests against the military trea
ty, signed in Washington last Jan
uary and now up for ratification
by tho Japanese Diet.
Police rushed 6,000 riot force
men into the fray. Two thousand
others wore held in reserve, but
never used.
Bumper-to-bumper rows of po
lice cars and trucks barred tho
way of the mob into the building.
Disregarding police advice to go 1
home, tho -students charged the
police cordon. Some swung flag
staffs to topple officers from the
roofs of trucks. Others hurled
themselves on the police and fell
with them on top of the demon
strators below.
Police Take Action
The major police force let the
vanguard of the youths scale the
third row of trucks, then swung
into action.
They quickly broke up the
charge, using hands as much as
possible but sticks when neces-1
sary.
The main body of the students
fell back. Many of those.who
broke through were bleeding at
the nose and mouth as they were
led away by officers.
TOKYO (/I J ) Six thousand radical left-wing university students
tried to batter their way through massed police linos into tho Par
liament building yesterday in protest against Japan's new security
pact with the United States.
Members of the Zengakuren National Students Assn. were cheer-

od on by black-uniformed loaders.
Tho leaders exhorted the youths
to emulate South Korean students
who forced President Syngman
Rhee to bow to their demands for
reforms.
But the anti-American Japanese
students lacked both tho inspira
tion and mottle of the pro-Ameri
can Koreans.

back the massed assaults of tho
chanting, shouting young men and
women in a four-hour series of
shoving contests puneturated by
free-for-alls which left many faces'
bloodied.

than 100 demonstrators were in
