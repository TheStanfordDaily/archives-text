# OUT TODAY
## Chappie Attempts Yearly Parody; This Time It's Saturday Evening Post 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
That loose-hung citadel of icon
oclasm, the Stanford Chaparral,
swings its fearsome hammer at
another American institution to
day. Ready for the title? "The
Wednesday Morning Pile."
Yes. it's the Saturday Evening
Post, with all tlie banalities mag
nified and a few new ones thrown
in as only the Chappie could
dream them up.
But they use tho excuse of sa

' tirizing the Post to actually sati
rize everything they can think of,
from the D.A.R. to the Depart
ment of Sociology.
Perhaps the most cutting at
tacks are in the Letters from the
Readers. For instance: Dear Sirs:
Albert Camus is a fink, (signed)
J. P. Sarte, Paris, Ohio. Or a com
ment on the recent article, "Amer
ican Colleges Are Hothouses of
VD." The comment runs that if
I college humor magazines were
banned, a lot of t his will go away.
That's what I like about the Chap
pie: you never know when they
will slip in a straight fact like
that.
Looney Logic-
Next come the editorials: Best
effort is "Censorship is Neces
sary" by F. Rabelais, graduate of
j t he Stanford Law School. The
argument is simple: Censorship
; protects us from Communism.
I Therefore licentious magazines,
! etc., ought to be suppressed. Very
| persuasive.
Then the article which ranks
! highest in my estimate "Crisis
! in Our Colleges" by Wylie Viper.
J The article starts out with shock
> ing statistics, such as "Mills Col
lege has begun to grant degrees
: in other fields besides home eeo
j nomics. . . ." By the end they have
J ranked every major college and
| university in the U.S. except San
: Jose State.
More articles follow. Just a
few titles are: "Under thC Icecap
to Milpitas." "The Menace of Ti
erra del Fuego" <y Ortega? > and
"Adventures in the Head, No. 43."
The fiction is also top-notch (or

I bottom-notch, depending on your
I relationship to ihe Saturday Eve
ning Post). This department has
been asked to pass along a mun
dane note in that connection. The
story, "A Postcard for Kathy" on
page IT has been continued on
page <16. It seems they forgot to
| put this in. So to those readers
who make it to the bottom of
| page IT: You aren't finished yet.
i Fight on!
Whoops!
The usual format on the center
pages has been changed. A girl,
a boy, a car and the beam of a
| flashlight in Cactus Gardens. This
! is The Farce of America series,
i of course.
Inevitably, there are jokes. This
; may be just a malicious rumor,
but I heard that the Chappie's
i joke editor is an archeology ma
' jor. He has excavated a number
I of oldies this time without bother
! ing to scrape off the dirt. But
j one is repeatable anyway. "Drive
| Safely—The Life You Save May
! Break the Curve."
Lampooncy
"You be the Judge" is the acme
;of lampoonery. On the same
page (p. 43—t00 far back for stuff
this good) is an immortal quote:
| "They'll never call Harvard 'the
Stanford of the East.'"
The next issue is Crash Comics,
j They won't be able to make it
much more satirical than the
Wednesday Evening Pile. Perhaps
they intend to sell their mag then
Iby upping the smut. But this
time the Chaparral is worth every
! bit of your 35 cents.
The price per copy has gone up
to 40 cents this time.
