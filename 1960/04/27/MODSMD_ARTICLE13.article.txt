# An Important Question

### 
A letter oil litis page from a former Stanford representative
to the National Student Association gives one more reason for
Stanford to affiliate with the MS A. that of providing leadership.
This argument ma\ perhaps niollifv some of those students
who oppose affiliation on the grounds that Stanford will have
little say in wlial NSA advocates. As Mr. lingers points out, iu
three of the fifteen major resolutions passed by the \SA
(.ongress were introduced by the Stanford delegation, even
though this school was not a member at the time.
B\ providing leadership on the basis of Stanford's prestige
as a great university, the Stanford delegates would carry much
more weight than their numbers might indicate.
Stanford would have representation proportional to" the size
of its student body. The fact that Stanford could not always have
its wav should not deter us from affiliating: for in order to re
ceive the benefits of the NSA, Stanford would have to relinquish
some "sovereignty," as does every person who joins ail organiza
tion or becomes part of a community, and, iu fact, as does everv
student who attends Stanford.
We suspect, however, that Stanford would not be at cross
purposes with other universities as often as many NSv\ oppo
nents claim. And membership in the NSA would not prevent
I .ASS Ii from exercising individual action iu those cases when it
disagrees with the NSA majority decision. Moreover, the right
to individual action, which NSA opponents zealously wish to
protect, has seldom been employed by LASSU even with Stan
lord out of the NSA.
The argument that NSA officers are professional lobbyists
and no longer have student interests at heart is invalid. Although
during their one-year tenure as officers they are not in school, a
great number of them continue their studies alter a new slate
is elected each summer. Also, these officers are constantly travel
ing around the countrv to conferences and campuses where lliev
are in contact with students and their problems.
The cost of joining the .NSA would be $225 annually for dues
plus travel expenses for delegates, estimated at SI3OO. I bis sum,
a small one when divided among the 8000 students at Stanford,
would not detract from the funds of other organizations. The
extra finances could be obtained from surplus budget money
which is often left over at the end of the year and from the ASSU
floating fund of 880,000 which is not budgeted.
Therefore, it is up to the student body to decide if the benefits
of the NSA warrant Stanford's affiliating, and we feel that this
is indeed the case. These benefits, as elaborated in an earlier
editorial, are an increased interest iu and know ledge of important
issues and events accruing from campus leadership bv Stanford
delegates to the conferences, and the participation in a national
student movement to work for the needs and desires of students.
The chances are excellent that if Stanford does not join this
year, it will become a member in the future, for the NSA is a
growing movement. The question must be: Shall we wait and
forego the advantages of the NSA for a number of years, or shall
we affiliate now and help lead the NSA to become bigger and
better? Each voter should answer that question today and to
morrow as he marks his ballot.
