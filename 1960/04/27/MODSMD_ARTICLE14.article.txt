During these elections the mem
bers of the ASSU have been asked
to decide whether their associa
tion should join NSA. It is my
feeling that Stanford should not
affiliate with this organization.
In his Presidential Report of
last year, ASSU President John
Bohn wrote: "NSA would be a
handicap to the efficient adminis
tration of the ASSU. Most of the,
really significant advantages con
cerning such items as coordina
tion and organization of student
government, leadership, admin
istration problems, and so forth,
are rendered by the Pacific Stu
dent Presidents' Association."
Contrary to some critical re
marks, Stanford's student govern
ment is considered one of the
finest and mo«t mature of the
student governments in American
universities and colleges. And
though there is always room for
improvement the services pro
vided to student governments by
NSA would be negligible to Stan
ford.
Besides administration and co
ordination services to student gov
ernment NSA offers other aspects
relative to university students.
However, I believe that we have'
or do much that NSA takes pride
in offering to member schools.
Of course, ours is not on a na
tional scale, but it is on a much
more personal or grass root rela
tionship. Our foreign scholar pro
gram, foreign study centers,
speech activities, lIR and Political
Union activities would only be
duplicated through NSA, and then
it would be on a distant scale.
Currently, the significant point
of NSA membership has been
the opportunity to participate in
a group that purports to be repre
sentative of American university
and college students. To be a
member of NSA would mean that
Stanford would be an official
member of an American student
voice. Yet, would NSA be repre
sentative of not only American
students, but more important at
this time, would members of the
ASSU be truly represented?
May I refer to Alan Kahn's
article in Monday's Daily titled,
"Representation Lark Cited as

NSA Rejection Reason." In this
article, Mr. Kalin pointed out the
fact that Stanford could be virtu
ally voiceless in such a large and
unwieldly body as tlie NSA Con
gress. which is the sounding board
on all prominent national and in
ternational issues. Yet, even with
out a say in NSA policy, our name
will -still be connected and related
to all of the NSA positions.
Also. NSA is structured so as to
give the executive officers, who
are no longer registered in any
university or college and conse
quently unable to truly repre
sent campus opinions, the power
to "enact emergency policies"
(Ait. IV, Paragraph D, Sentence
3 NSA Constitution). These
emergency policies, of course,
could hardly merit any claim of
representative of American uni
versities— i.e., Stanford Univer
sity.
While reading A 1 Kahn's article,
may I also refer you to the short
editorial on the same page. To
vote down membership in NSA,
the editorial says, would be 1o
deny Stanford students interest in
national interest and issue. I con
cur with Miss Proudfoot, and feel
that students do not lack an in
terest in society and its issues
but in an organiation such as NSA
and its policies.
Some persons advocate that
NSA would provide educational
and public relations opportunities
for the ASSU representatives to
the NSA Congress; however,
Stanford students already partici
pate in many fine and varied stu
dent conferences of significant
educational value. To join NSA,
coidd very well limit or restrict
Stanford students in the scope and
variety of their participation in
other conferences.
Thus, unless you have studied
the NSA program thoroughly and
are still convinced that Stanford
needs it and it needs Stanford, 1
would strongly urge that you vote
no on NSA membership. If, in
the future under the new ASSU
president, sufficient interest, in
workers as well as advocates, is
engendered in NSA. the ASSU
could study the question again.

could study the question again.
During these elections the mem
bers of the ASSU have been asked
to decide whether their associa
tion should join NSA. It is my
feeling that Stanford should not
affiliate with this organization.
In his Presidential Report of
last year, ASSU President John
Bohn wrote: "NSA would be a
handicap to the efficient adminis
tration of the ASSU. Most of the,
really significant advantages con
cerning such items as coordina
tion and organization of student
government, leadership, admin
istration problems, and so forth,
are rendered by the Pacific Stu

Contrary to some critical re
marks, Stanford's student govern
ment is considered one of the
finest and mo«t mature of the
student governments in American
universities and colleges. And
though there is always room for
improvement the services pro
vided to student governments by
NSA would be negligible to Stan
ford.
Besides administration and co
ordination services to student gov
ernment NSA offers other aspects
relative to university students.
However, I believe that we have'
or do much that NSA takes pride
in offering to member schools.
Of course, ours is not on a na
tional scale, but it is on a much
more personal or grass root rela
tionship. Our foreign scholar pro
gram, foreign study centers,
speech activities, lIR and Political
Union activities would only be
duplicated through NSA, and then
it would be on a distant scale.
Currently, the significant point
of NSA membership has been
the opportunity to participate in
a group that purports to be repre
sentative of American university
and college students. To be a
member of NSA would mean that
Stanford would be an official
member of an American student
voice. Yet, would NSA be repre
sentative of not only American
students, but more important at
this time, would members of the
ASSU be truly represented?
May I refer to Alan Kahn's
article in Monday's Daily titled,
"Representation Lark Cited as

NSA Rejection Reason." In this
article, Mr. Kalin pointed out the
fact that Stanford could be virtu
ally voiceless in such a large and
unwieldly body as tlie NSA Con
gress. which is the sounding board
on all prominent national and in
ternational issues. Yet, even with
out a say in NSA policy, our name
will -still be connected and related
to all of the NSA positions.
Also. NSA is structured so as to
give the executive officers, who
are no longer registered in any
university or college and conse
quently unable to truly repre
sent campus opinions, the power
to "enact emergency policies"
(Ait. IV, Paragraph D, Sentence
3 NSA Constitution). These
emergency policies, of course,
could hardly merit any claim of
representative of American uni
versities— i.e., Stanford Univer
sity.
While reading A 1 Kahn's article,
may I also refer you to the short
editorial on the same page. To
vote down membership in NSA,
the editorial says, would be 1o
deny Stanford students interest in
national interest and issue. I con
cur with Miss Proudfoot, and feel
that students do not lack an in
terest in society and its issues
but in an organiation such as NSA
and its policies.
Some persons advocate that
NSA would provide educational
and public relations opportunities
for the ASSU representatives to
the NSA Congress; however,
Stanford students already partici
pate in many fine and varied stu
dent conferences of significant
educational value. To join NSA,
coidd very well limit or restrict
Stanford students in the scope and
variety of their participation in
other conferences.
Thus, unless you have studied
the NSA program thoroughly and
are still convinced that Stanford
needs it and it needs Stanford, 1
would strongly urge that you vote
no on NSA membership. If, in
the future under the new ASSU
president, sufficient interest, in
workers as well as advocates, is
engendered in NSA. the ASSU
