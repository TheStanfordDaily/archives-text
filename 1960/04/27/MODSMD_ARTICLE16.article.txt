The single, most important idea
of my "three point" program is
that student government can bo
much more valuable to the ma
ture university student if we for
get the delusion that its only
valid concern is within the tiny
realm of on-campus activities. On
the contrary, I contend that
thoughtful students would ap
preciate a student government
which assumed as an important
role the prompting of our aware
ness* and concern on national and
world issues.
This is not to say that there
is any real value to having Legis
lature and Legislature alone dis
cuss and resolve on such issues.
Indeed, I do not feel that Legisla
ture should ever be permitted to
state the opinion of the Stanford
student body. But I do maintain
that student government should
be used to carry such thought to
the student body and to allow in
dividuals or individual groups in
the student body to resolve on
important questions. Student gov
ernment should use such devices
as all-student assemblies, a .sys
tematic program of public speak
ers, and student forums to dis
seminate the information on
which intelligent thought can pro
ceed.
I sincerely hope that the Stan
ford student body will commit
itself to joining the National Stu
dent Association. I beileve it is im
portant for university students to
be able to express their ideas and
interests through the single or
ganization which speaks for the
American university student.

As a candidate for ASSU Presi
dent I have made the following
proposals. They are not designed
to cure all the ills of student gov
ernment but I feel that they
would go a long way in creating
new interest and in eliminating
many weak points in the ASSU.
I feel that discussion of non
campus issues should be held in
the various boards and â€¢commis
sions like the lIR and the Political
Union and not in the Legislature.
These divisions of the ASSU are
better equipped to handle such
discussion and they can allow far
greater student participation than
LASSU can. A thorough sludy of
representation on LASSU should
also be made.
I feel that the greatest prob
lem with class government is that
Excoms pretend to be representa
tive government. Such a bulky set
up is not necessary for the carry
ing out of the social functions of
a class. I would like to work with
all the newly elected class officers
and help them streamline their
work.
I think that we should not
affiliate with the National Stu
dents' Associate at this time. We
should start a far more thorough
investigation of the pros and cons
of joining than has been under
taken during these past few days.
We should find out from member
schools and from schools that
have disaffiliated exactly what
the good and bad points are and
then make a decision.
