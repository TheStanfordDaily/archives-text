Stanford s Role
Editor, (lie Daily:
Mr. Kahn appeals to 1 ho stu
dents lo reject NSA membership.
Unfortunately his facts are ques
tionable, his arguments avoid the
substantive questions involved in
such a vote, and worst of all, he
deavors to equate the personality
and leadership ability of the
Stanford student with a mathe
matical figure.
I write, not so much to sway
votes, but to offer information.
It was my pleasure to represent
Stanford University as its observ
er at NSA in the summer of 19,"56.
The summer convention divides
issues of school, community, na
tional and international signifi
cance into study group topics.
From these topics the policies of
NSA are determined via resolu
tions processed through Sub-com
mittee, Committee, Commission
and General Session debates. Stu
dent opinion from all quarters is
given the most democratic voice it
has been my privilege to witness.
Those elected to NSA offices
the year I was there were from
the school delegations present. It
is hard to see how they could be
more atuned to the thoughts of
the members of the student world.
But so much for this.
The question to decide is more
basic than procedures. Should
there be a National Student As
sociation? It cannot be doubted
for an instant that the convention
experience gained by the dele
gates is invaluable—educationally,
socially and otherwise- but is
there a purpose or a need for
vocal student opinion in the
United States? If so. as the mem
bers of a leading institution of
higher learning we should assume
the same role in NSA that Stan
ford has in the educational com
munity.
Perhaps NSA's greatest need is
that of leadership. Stanford is
more than able to provide it. In
1956, Stanford's three observers
wrote three of the 15 major reso
lutions adopted b'y the NSA,
argued them on the convention
floor, and saw them accepted even
though as non-members we could
not vote.
If, then, your decision is that
student opinion has a place in
public, your'choice is simple. Your
work and ability will make the
Association run. Your place is not
to take what you can get free and
shun the responsibility.

Important Issue
Editor, the Daily:
I regret that the recent attacks
on NSA affiliation have been in
terpreted by some as attacks on
only candidate to put forth a
definite platform — for two rea
sons:
1. The NSA issue, by being re
ferred to the students this elec
tion is no longer a part of future
platforms. It is to be decided
now.
2. The fundamental idea of Mr.
Purcell's campaign tends to be
obscured.
In my opinion Mr. Purcell has
achieved one of his fundamental
aims in taking a stand on the NSA
issue. It has indeed caused many
students to form and publicize
their own opinions, in considera
tion of the coming referendum.
Mr. Purcell has never intimated
that Legislature will itself decide
student opinion, or that campus

life will be a series of drum-beat
ing political rallies to the exclu
sion of campus activities. These
extremes seem but feeble coun
ters by opponents who have noth
ing positive to offer.
Mr. Burns, in defending Mr.
Royse yesterday, is typical of
those who equate all vital issues
with "hot air" and equate an at
tempt to promote thoughtful
discussion in student assemblies,
debates, and opinion polls, with
"nonsense." Their alternative, a
"reasonable and moderate" stand,
seems to be no stand at all.
I hesitate to trust student gov
ernment to a candidate whose
only "positive" position has been
to advocate a non-committal stand
on what Mr. Burns called "im
portant issues." I think it is sig
nificant that Mr. Purcell supplied
this important issue as one can
didate's only means of parasitical
criticism.

A Platform
Kditor, the Daily:
Regardless of my personal feel
ings about the platform which Mr.
Purcell has presented to the stu
dent body in this election, I can
not help feeling that for once a
candidate has presented a plat
form and in so doing has raised
the level of campaigning on this
campus.
This takes political courage, for
it is much easier to sell a smile
and a handshake than an idea.
And yet I believe that a candidate

owes a precise, explicit statement
of his intentions to the intelli
gent voter.
Agree or not, we know what one
candidate will attempt if elected.
The only promise by the other is
that we'll "roll." That's swell
roll Where?

Student Movement
Kditor, the Daily:
We appreciate and commend
the recent Daily coverage of the
student movements for integra
tion. But we* feel that there is
need of clarification on a few
points.
Activities in support of these
movements by Stanford students
(specifically picketing and the col
lection of funds) are not being
organized by the YWCA as stated
in Monday's Daily. The YWCA of
fices are, however, serving as an
informal center for material and

meetings.
Promotion, initiation and par
ticipation is being carried on by
individual students who, con
vinced of the need for responsible
action, are acting. There is no
affiliation with any particular
group, although members of sev
eral groups (e.g., the YWCA) sup
port the action.
Most of the demonstrating has
occurred and will continue to oc
cur during the noon hour, but it is
not at all limited to this time, as
the Daily implied. Further infor
mation can be obtained from those
who have agreed to help coordi
nate these activties and who sign
this letter.
All interested in these activities
are invited and urged to attend
a meeting tomorrow at 4:15 on
the third floor of the Women's
Clubhouse.
