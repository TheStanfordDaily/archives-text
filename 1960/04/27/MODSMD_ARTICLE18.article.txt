Somebody (laifl (ioiml

An itom in yesterday morning's Sail Francisco Chronicle makes
vis wonder it somebody can count. According to Art Koscnbanni
in his column, there were only 49 people at Saturday's Stanford-
USC douhleheader at the Sunken Diamond. This count was made by
the concessionaire, who according to Rosenbaum went to ihe horse
races after finding only 49 noses in the crowd.
Something is wrong somewhere, for I sat through both ends
of the double-header, and estimated that there was closer to 200
people in the stands, despite the lousy weather.
Frankly I was surprised at the number of people that showed

up at the game, for the support
of the Stanford baseball teams lias
been poor this season to say the
least. The usual crowd at a Stan
ford game is half a dozen
parents, the student policemen
who are working at the game,
four or five girl friends of the
players, a handful of died-in-tlie
wool baseball fans, an even small
er handful of Stanford students,
and finally the guys who are
either keeping the score, etc., or
reporting the game.
This frankly is disturbing.
There doesn't seem to be an an
swer to why students who ad
mittedly like the game, aren't
willing to pay four-bits to see
the Indians in action. The weather
lias been a problem the last
couple of games, but even earlier
when the weather was good, the
crowds still never reached any
measurable quantity. So now
what is the answer to this?
The first thing that someone
will say is that the Tribe has not

boon playing good baseball this season. Right now the record stands
at 13 wins 11 losses. That's better than .500 ball, which isn't really
too bad considering the improvising that Coach Dutch Feliring has
had to do because of injuries, etc.
Saturday when the Indians took the second game of the twin
bill from El Troj, it represented the first time in his four years on
the Farm that Fehring has ever beaten USC on his home grounds.
As a matter of fact, it is only the third time that one of his teams
has beaten the boys from Figueroa Street.
Back in 1957. Bob Leopold threw a no-hitter at the Trojans for
one of the wins. Then last season, the Indians took the measure of
the Southlanriers. (5-3, in the San Diego Marine Tournament during
Spring Vacation. So Saturday's 3-2 win on Jimmy Cowart's last
inning triple was a landmark for Fehring.
But back to the improvising that Fehring has had to do to en
able the Indians to stay on the field with USC and others.
The first big surprise would have been to find Jay Winter at first
base instead of behind the plate. Winter was suffering from a
pinched nerve in his throwing arm, so ho had to be moved some
where where he wouldn't have the tough throw.
Then if you looked at second, you would find shortstop-turned
outfielder-turned-second baseman Ilal Scluitzmann handling the
duties instead of regular second-sacker Mike Magee. who had to be
moved behind the plate, to handle Winter's duties.
Short and third were the same, but the outfield was a little shook
up. A second baseman, Skip Lawrence, was in center, and a former
pitcher turned outfielder Jim Cowart was in right, and was to be
the hero of the win.
The reason for this is the inconsistent hitting which has plagued
the Tribe. Although outhitting their opponents 186 to 164. the blows
with the runners in scoring position just have not been there. But
the blame could be placed on the fact that this year's club is a young
one, and young clubs slump easier than veterans.
Help From Frosh
But although the Indians have a few big ones left this season,
ones that they could win if they play like last weekend, lets' look for
a moment toward next season.
Mickey Holzman's frosh club has a few varsity candidates, and a
couple of pro prospects in the pitching department. Dan-ell Suther
land and Billy Wakefield both have had the major scouts breathing
down their necks. Sutherland is blessed with an excellent curve ball,
and great overall speed. His only problem is wildness. Thus far he
has compiled an 1.08 ERA. and has given up 13 hits in 25 innings,
while striking out 33. But along the way he has walked 15, hit six
batters, and has thrown nine wild pitches.
Wakefield on the other hand has not pitched this season because
of a broken wrist received in a basketball game before the start of
the season. His wing is now out of the cast, and ho should bo ready
to throw in a couple of weeks.
Holy,man also has a couple of good hitters, that should help out
on the varsity next season. Gordy Austin i* banging the ball for a
.355 average, and has nine RBl's. He is the most consistent hitter
on the team. Outfielder Bob Hensler is just getting started, but his
average is now a respectable .346. Grey- Post is the long ball hitter,
and looks like the guy who will hit it out of the Sunken Dianmond
next year.
The Frosh are playing in a new league, formed by I-101/.man. It
includes frosh from San Jose State, Cal and Santa Clara.
So the potential for Â£ood baseball is here for the rest of this
season, and for the next three seasons, all that remains now is to
get a little support from the fans, if this isn't asking too much.
