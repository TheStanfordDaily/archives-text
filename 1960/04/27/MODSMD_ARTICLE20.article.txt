# HARRISON WORLD'S GREATEST'
## Card Preps for Rome Daily Sports 
### Rick Walker 
"Technically he's the greatest
all-around swimmer in the world,"
was Yale Coach Emeritus Bob
Kiphuth's comment about George
Harrison at the AAU Champion
ships this year. In saying this
Kiphuth must have realized that
he was rating Harrison over his
personally trained Jeff Farrel
who smashed all existing records
in the 100 and 220-yard free-style
this year.
Harrison, a Stanford student
until this spring when he took a
quarter's leave of absence to prac
tice for the coming Olympics, has
long been known in local swim
ming circles. He started his swim
ming career at the Berkeley
YMCA.

When he arrived at Stanford as
a freshman in 1957, he had al
ready made high school all-Ameri
can in the butterfly and individual
I medley and held the 1957 Outdoor
AAIJ 400 individual medley cham
pionship.
Besides this, he had the experi
ence of swimming on the 8110-
yard free-style relay in the 1956
Olympics and had been chosen to
go to Japan on the United States
j team that traveled there in 1955.
Works for Perfection
Once at Stanford, Harrison
didn't stop his progress, but, un
der the tutelage of Coach Tom
Haynie, worked on perfecting his
strokes, especially the free-style
and butterfly.
Long hours of hard work in the
pool payed off in the 1958 NCAA
Championships where lie set new
| records in both the 100 and 200-
yard butterfly and the 200-yard
individual medley. Stanford's
medley relay needed a backstrok-
I or for that meet, so Harrison also
swam backstroke in the relay and
did a good job of it as the relay
team won and broke the existing
record.
Roads to Rome
This year all roads point to
Rome, and each road has a dif
ferent free-style event posted on
it. Harrison hopes to represent
his country in three events at
Rome this summer; the 200, 400
and 1500-meter free-style events.
This slow building process had
ja good start in the California In
tercollegiate Swim Champion
ships as Harrison won the 220,
and 440-yard and 1500 meter free
style events. From there he went

back to Iho NCAA finals al Dal
las where lie took two seconds off
his 440, three seconds off his 220
and eight seconds off his 1500-
meter lime.
The final lest before the Olym
pic tryouts this summer was the
AAU meet held at the beginning
of April. Here Harrison took a
second in Ihe 220 behind Yale's
Jeff Farrel, and a second in the
440 behind Allen Somers.
New 400 Mark

the 400-yard individual medley, an
event in which he has for years
held the record, instead of the
1500 meter free, just to see what
he could do. So he did swim it.
the first time in over a year, and
posted a new American and AAU
record of 1:28.6, breaking his old
record of 4:35.8 and topping the
best world time by 2.0 seconds.
At present Harrison's 1:23.8 140
time is second in the nation only
to Somers' 4:22.6, and his 2:02.3
220 is third behind Farrel and
SC's Tom Winters.
But the thing to watch is the
way Harrison's times are coming
rapidly and consistently down. In
the last month and a half he has
taken three seconds off of both
his 220 and 440, and almost ten
seconds off of his 1500 time.

Harrison, a Stanford student
until this spring when he took a
quarter's leave of absence to prac
tice for the coming Olympics, has
long been known in local swim
ming circles. He started his swim
ming career at the Berkeley
YMCA.

When he arrived at Stanford as
a freshman in 1957, he had al
ready made high school all-Ameri
can in the butterfly and individual
I medley and held the 1957 Outdoor
AAIJ 400 individual medley cham
pionship.
Besides this, he had the experi
ence of swimming on the 8110-
yard free-style relay in the 1956
Olympics and had been chosen to
go to Japan on the United States
j team that traveled there in 1955.
Works for Perfection
Once at Stanford, Harrison
didn't stop his progress, but, un
der the tutelage of Coach Tom
Haynie, worked on perfecting his
strokes, especially the free-style
and butterfly.
Long hours of hard work in the
pool payed off in the 1958 NCAA
Championships where lie set new
| records in both the 100 and 200-
yard butterfly and the 200-yard
individual medley. Stanford's
medley relay needed a backstrok-
I or for that meet, so Harrison also
swam backstroke in the relay and
did a good job of it as the relay
team won and broke the existing
record.

This year all roads point to
Rome, and each road has a dif
ferent free-style event posted on
it. Harrison hopes to represent
his country in three events at
Rome this summer; the 200, 400
and 1500-meter free-style events.
This slow building process had
ja good start in the California In

back to Iho NCAA finals al Dal

his 440, three seconds off his 220
and eight seconds off his 1500-

Jeff Farrel, and a second in the
