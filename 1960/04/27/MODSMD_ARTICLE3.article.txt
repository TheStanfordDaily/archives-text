# Pragmatism Traced in New Deal

The genius of Franklin D.
Roosevelt was that he followed
a "pr&gmatic fashion" in revising
the existing economic structure,
historian Frank Freidel Jr. said
last night.
Freidel analyzed FDR, "human
itarian, patriot, and above all, po
litical pragmatist," in a Tuesday
Evening Series talk.
Of the People
Roosevelt entered the White
House, said Friedel, determined to
be President to all the American
people. He tried to accommodate
everyone together, absorbing the
ideas of his colleagues into an
amazingly comprehensive pro
gra m.
Freidel cited the Depression as
the force behind Roosevelt's dra
matic reform program. "Without
the enormous shaking of our
fundamental premises, there
would have been nothing so dras
tic as the New Deal,'' he said.
The vigor, charm, and courage
of Franklin Roosevelt was appeal
ing to a people shaken by crisis,
said Freidel. Referring to Herbert
Hoover, he said, "Although the
masses were not ready to accept
socialism, they didn't want a man
in the White House who so little
understood their problems."
Roosevelt (ioals
Roosevelt had two goals when
elected, Freidel said. He wanted to
get back to prosperity as soon as
possible through emergency leg
islation, but he also sought legis
lation for long range reforms.
Whether reform will come in
the '60s, Freidel contended, will
depend on who controls party ma
chinery, who controls Congress,
and who is elected President.
