Education Program
Plans provide for the creation
of a graduate education program
open to anyone, and for a center
serving the entire West Coast.
"This entire program, worked
out during two years of negotiat
ing with Stanford University,
i would be impossible," John R.
Little, chairman of the organizing
group, emphasized, "had it not
; been for the determiniation of tho
: Stanford Board of Trustees to pro
' vide tho outstanding medical and
| professional staff brought togeth
er over the years with the op

j service to the community."
After signing for the Stanford
I Trustees, the board chairman,
I David Packard, stated: "Ever
since the-University's Board deter
mined that its future Medical
School and Medical Center should
be located on the campus ... the
| board has recognized its respon

Heavy Expenditures
"To continue its operation on a
scale approaching the high stand
arris it has observed in the past
"would have meant heavy expend
itures of capital for reconstruc
tion and rehabilitation of a large
portion of tho San Francisco prop
erties. This was something Stan
! ford could not afford to do."
