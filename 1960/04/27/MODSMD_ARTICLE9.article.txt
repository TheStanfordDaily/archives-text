# Throngs Celebrate Fall Of Korean Government
## 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea (/P)
Scores of thousands of Koreans
joyously celebrated today the
collapse of President Syngman
Rhee's 12-year-old regime as a lib
eration from dictatorship.
Uproariously jubilant students
who led the unarmed revolt
against the founder of the South
Korean Republic now called for
public calm to permit an orderly
transition from autocracy to de
mocracy.
A tumultuous 2<j hours of steady
rioting and demonstrations ended
at curfew time last night with
more than 100,000 Koreans crowd-

! ing the streets of this capital to
j celebrate what they obviously re
garded as an historic political vie
i tory.
Student demonstrators marched
among the throngs shouting,
"Rhee, resigned!" Others chanted,
"We are free. We are free!"
The National Assembly, backed
by the students, demanded that
I Rhee resign immediately.
Police Disappear
All through yesterday students
demonstrated and celebrated.
Troops charged with enforcing
martial law did little or nothing
to check them. Police, hated by
many Koreans as a symbol of re
! pression, disappeared. Most ap
! parently either fled Seoul or shed
; their uniforms, leaving law en-
I forcement up to the army, which
j has been in charge since last
| week's "bloody Tuesday" riots
i precipitated the climatic crisis.
! The Health Ministry reported at
; least 15 more persons died in
yesterday's riots and more than
| ITO were wounded. For the week
; of violence, the totals rose to at
least 145 dead, by official count,
! and more than 800 wounded.
Save U.S. Flag
Crowds of young people
smashed into the home of Lee Ki
poong, Rhee's vice president-elect
and hurled his personal belong
ings out the window and built a
bonfire to burn them. One of the
few items to survive was a huge
silk American flag. The students
gently placed it to one side, away
from the fire, and then presented
it to an Associated Press photog
j rapher. As for Lee, his where
i abouts was a mystery at that
moment.
While mobs of cheering stu
dents sacked Lee's home Seoul
j waited anxiously to see what the
j pridefully stubborn, 85-year-old
j "George Washington" of South
; Korea would do.
Ambassador Resigns
Meanwhile in Washington, the
United Stales called yesterday for
a speedup by South Korea's gov
; eminent in removing "the griev-
I ances of the people" and sum
i moned a special meeting of na
tions which fought the Comrnu
| nists in Korea.
In a related development, Am
j bassador You Chan Yang an
j nounced he is submit ting his res
ignation after nearly nine years
as Seoul envoy to Washington
"because I have made mistakes."
Yang said that under instruc
tions from his government, he had
wrongly declared in public that
j the Communists fomented the
I demonstrations seething in his
! homeland.

SEOUL, South Korea (/P)
Scores of thousands of Koreans
joyously celebrated today the
collapse of President Syngman
Rhee's 12-year-old regime as a lib
eration from dictatorship.
Uproariously jubilant students
who led the unarmed revolt
against the founder of the South
Korean Republic now called for
public calm to permit an orderly
transition from autocracy to de
mocracy.
A tumultuous 2<j hours of steady
rioting and demonstrations ended
at curfew time last night with
more than 100,000 Koreans crowd-

! ing the streets of this capital to
j celebrate what they obviously re
garded as an historic political vie
i tory.
Student demonstrators marched
among the throngs shouting,
"Rhee, resigned!" Others chanted,
"We are free. We are free!"
The National Assembly, backed
by the students, demanded that
I Rhee resign immediately.
Police Disappear
All through yesterday students
demonstrated and celebrated.
Troops charged with enforcing
martial law did little or nothing
to check them. Police, hated by
many Koreans as a symbol of re
! pression, disappeared. Most ap
! parently either fled Seoul or shed
; their uniforms, leaving law en-
I forcement up to the army, which
j has been in charge since last
| week's "bloody Tuesday" riots
i precipitated the climatic crisis.
! The Health Ministry reported at
; least 15 more persons died in
yesterday's riots and more than
| ITO were wounded. For the week
; of violence, the totals rose to at
least 145 dead, by official count,
! and more than 800 wounded.
Save U.S. Flag
Crowds of young people
smashed into the home of Lee Ki
poong, Rhee's vice president-elect
and hurled his personal belong
ings out the window and built a
bonfire to burn them. One of the
few items to survive was a huge
silk American flag. The students
gently placed it to one side, away
from the fire, and then presented
it to an Associated Press photog
j rapher. As for Lee, his where
i abouts was a mystery at that
moment.
While mobs of cheering stu
dents sacked Lee's home Seoul
j waited anxiously to see what the
j pridefully stubborn, 85-year-old
j "George Washington" of South
; Korea would do.
Ambassador Resigns
Meanwhile in Washington, the
United Stales called yesterday for
a speedup by South Korea's gov
; eminent in removing "the griev-
I ances of the people" and sum
i moned a special meeting of na
tions which fought the Comrnu
| nists in Korea.
In a related development, Am
j bassador You Chan Yang an
j nounced he is submit ting his res
ignation after nearly nine years
