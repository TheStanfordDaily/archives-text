Bringing new knowledge to eager finger tips.
Braille has opened lip bright new worlds for thousands and
thousands of blind persons. However, the difficulty of trans
lating printed material into this complex "touch language"
has limited the number and variety of publications.
To make more Braille material available, a method of tran
scribing the printed word into Braille automatically has been
developed by IBM scientists in cooperation with the Ameri
! can Printing House for the Blind.
The text, in punched card form, is processed bv a high-speed
IBM electronic computer. The computer can translate a
300-page book into its equivalent Braille in less than an hour.
ft takes all kinds of talents to develop computer systems
that can handle complex jobs like this. Expanding computer
applications at IBM have created opportunities in research,
engineering, programming and manufacturing. Perhaps one
of these IBM careers is the "future" vou've been looking for.
