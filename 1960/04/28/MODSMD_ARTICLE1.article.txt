# De Gaulle Will Visit Medical Center Today
## 
### 
Stanford will extend a welcoming hand for a few brief moments
today to President Charles de Gaulle, founder of the Fifth Republic
and leader of 45 million Frenchmen.
De Gaulle will not visit the main part of the campus, but will
tour the Stanford Medical Center fur about a half hour, from 12:50
to 1:20 p.m.
While at the center, the French leader will speak briefly to the
79 Stanford students slated to be the first class at the new Tours,
France, campus.
Also on hand'will be several French students and teaching fel
lows attending Stanford. One of them will greet De Gaulle with
a short speech in l French.
The president! is scheduled to arrive at the center in a 35-car
motorcade at 12:50 after a tour of the Hewlett-Packard plant in the
Stanford Industrial Park and a quick tour of Palo Alto.
Stanford President Wallace Sterling will head a University
delegation which will greet De Gaulle as he arrives at the center.
Sterling will speak briefly about the purpose of the center and
the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital. He will be followed by Mayor Noel
E. Porter of Pah; Alto, who will officially express his city's pleasure
at De Gaulle's visit.
At 1:05 p.m., Henry L. Mclntyre, vice president of the hospital's
board of governors, will escort the general and his party through
the first floor of the hospital pavilion.
During his tour of the hospital, De Gaulle probably will meet a
14-year-old Palo Alto boy who is hospitalized there, and who idolizes
him.
De Gaulle will leave the center about 1:20. His caravan will
follow Lomita Drive and South Drive in front of the Quad, out
Palm Drive and University Avenue in downtown Palo Alto to the

Bayshore Freeway.
Anyone on the campus hoping to see the president probably
i would do best to line up along Lomita or South drives. He will be
i riding in an open car so it should be possible to catch a good glimpse
| of the man who has made so much history the past 20 years.
Cecil Riley, assistant to Palo Alto City Manager Jerry Keithley,
urged the public to stay away from the center and from Hewlett
-1 Packard.
Both stopping places will be barricaded and only members of
party and accredited press allowed to enter.
Hospital workers began erecting barricades at 3 a.m. today at
j the main entrance. At noon the main lobby will be closed to the
i public.
i De Gaulle is visting Palo Alto at his own request. When his
, itinerary for the U.S. tour was under consideration, he personally
| asked lhat Palo Alto and the Stanford Industrial Park be included
on his tour.
Robert Luc, French consul general in San Francisco, said that
De Gaulle was interested in the concept of a park-like industrial
area in a city widely known for its university and homes. The in
dustrial park is on Stanford property, leased by the companies for
99 years.
Luc said De Gaulle became interested in the park when he saw
! films at the U.S. exhibit at the 1958 Brussels World Fair.
Palo Alto has gone all out for the French chief executive's stop
over. City streets along which he will travel have been cleaned
twice this week.
He will be made an honorary councilman of Palo Alto the first
one. And about 250 girls from the Castilleja School will line up
along Embareadero Road to sing "The Marseillaise" as he passes.
