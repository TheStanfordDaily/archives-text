### Barry Greenberg 
Why are the Russian people so anxious to question American
tourists? Because they sense that they are not getting the truth,
Peter Grothe, Foreign Relations Consultant to Sen. Hubert Hum
phrey. said yesterday at Bowman Alumni House.
Grothe, a former Stanford student and political science in-

struct or who has traveled exten
sively in Russia, said that Ameri
can tourists must be prepared to
answer difficult questions.
"What about the unemployment
problem in the U.S.?" a Russian
will ask. "Tell him that we do
have unelnployment," Grothe said.
"But also tell him that lie doesn't
read about social security, old-age
pensions and the like. Tell him
that the unemployed are not
walking the streets starving to
death."
Racial Prejudice
When a Russian asks you about
racial prejudice, tell him about
the progress being made, Grothe
suggested. "Let him know that
out of 50 states, only six are not
integrated. The Russian thinks
that there are 10 lynchings a
week. Tell him that in 15 years
there have only been five."
One of the toughest questions
a tourist will be asked is, "What
about all those bases around Rus
sia?" "You must make the Rus
sian understand that Americans
truly want peace and that the
bases are strictly for defensive
purposes," said Grothe.
Most Russians are mainly in
terested in the American living
standard. "A Russian's eyes pop
out when you tell him that the
average wage per hour is $2.17.
"Tell him that it is possible to
buy a good second-hand car on a
month's salary; it would take him
five years to raise the same
amount of money and then he
would have to wait in an endless
line in order to get the car.
Questions lor Americans
He also suggested a couple of
questions that Americans can ask
if the Russians become hostile in
their querying. "Ask him about
travel. Say you would like him
to visit you in California. The
Russian knows he cannot travel
and it makes him angry."
Grothe concluded by stating
that ho thinks there is a growing
desire to be free among the Rus
sian people. "Americans can help
by constantly reminding the Rus
sians that the big difference be
tween America and the USSR is
not the standard of living but the
freedom of the mind."

One of the toughest questions
a tourist will be asked is, "What
about all those bases around Rus
sia?" "You must make the Rus
sian understand that Americans
truly want peace and that the
bases are strictly for defensive
purposes," said Grothe.
Most Russians are mainly in
terested in the American living
standard. "A Russian's eyes pop
out when you tell him that the
average wage per hour is $2.17.
"Tell him that it is possible to
buy a good second-hand car on a
month's salary; it would take him
five years to raise the same
amount of money and then he
would have to wait in an endless
line in order to get the car.
Questions lor Americans
He also suggested a couple of
questions that Americans can ask
if the Russians become hostile in
their querying. "Ask him about
travel. Say you would like him
to visit you in California. The
Russian knows he cannot travel
and it makes him angry."
Grothe concluded by stating
that ho thinks there is a growing
desire to be free among the Rus
sian people. "Americans can help
by constantly reminding the Rus
sians that the big difference be
tween America and the USSR is
not the standard of living but the
freedom of the mind."
Why are the Russian people so anxious to question American
tourists? Because they sense that they are not getting the truth,
Peter Grothe, Foreign Relations Consultant to Sen. Hubert Hum
phrey. said yesterday at Bowman Alumni House.
Grothe, a former Stanford student and political science in-

struct or who has traveled exten
sively in Russia, said that Ameri
can tourists must be prepared to
answer difficult questions.
"What about the unemployment
problem in the U.S.?" a Russian
will ask. "Tell him that we do
have unelnployment," Grothe said.
"But also tell him that lie doesn't
read about social security, old-age
pensions and the like. Tell him
that the unemployed are not
walking the streets starving to
death."
Racial Prejudice
When a Russian asks you about
racial prejudice, tell him about
the progress being made, Grothe
suggested. "Let him know that
out of 50 states, only six are not
integrated. The Russian thinks
that there are 10 lynchings a
week. Tell him that in 15 years
there have only been five."
