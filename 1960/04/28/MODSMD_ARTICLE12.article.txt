# DEMOCRACY IGNORED
## De Gaulle Leads France With Autocratic Methods 
### Dick White Contributing Editor 
Today General Charles de
Gaulle, President of France, visits
our campus, at least as fat' as the
Stanford-Palo Alto Ho s pi t a 1.
There ho will undoubtedly be
greeted by throngs of students
and townspeople anxious to get
a glimpse of this historic figure.
It is true that De Gaulle is a
man history will long demember.
After Ihe fall of France in 1940, it
was De Gaulle who organized and
led the Free French Army in their
resistance to the Nazis. No one
will deny the heroism of this man
in liberating his country.
However, this is not to say that
the great military strategist is
automatically the best leader of a
democratic country. De Gaulle
sees democracy as a weak and in
effective method of government.
This may be true, but democracy
is still undoubtedly the fairest sys
ter for* the individual.
Loss of Prestige
De Gaulle, however, is not in
terested in the individual. He is
concerned with the loss of pres
tige France has suffered since
World War 11. The setbacks in
Indo China and Suez and the in
ability to settle the Algerian Re
volt. have all had demoralizing
influences on the French nation.
De Gaulle has set out to in
crease French prestige, unfortu
nately at the expense of the citi
zens. As an example, when the
extraordinary powers were grant
ed t,p the government following
the recent Algerian insurrection,
opposition leaders tried to exempt
labor unions and civil rights from
this control, but the government
backed majority refused.
Supporters of De Gaulle say
that he was elected President and
that France has a constitution.
This seems to be their only crite
rion for a democratic regime. No
one denies the fact that De Gaulle

! was elected or that France is a
constitutional republic. This issue
being discussed is De Gaulle's sup
port of democratic principles.
Hitler himself achieved power
through election, and yel this was
one of the most totalitarian of
I states. Stalin's Russia had a con
stitution, but still the government
remained despotic. Certainly De
Gaulle is neither a Hitler nor a
Stalin, but we should recognize
that his regime is autocratic.
Opinions of People
The French contitution relies
greatly on the power of this one
man and largely disregards the
opinions of the people. The 25 per
cent of the French who vote Com
munist are represented in the Na
tional Assembly by less than two
per cent of the delegates. This
constitution may have been voted
in by the people, but it certainly
ignores the principles of repre
sentative government.
No one claims that De Gaulle
;is not the legal executive of
; France or that he seized power.
| His election by a large majority
is a well known fact. The distress
ing point is that France, a nation
with a democratic tradition, has
gone through crises which it felt
could only be solved by an auto
, cratic government. The democrat
ic process has been deserted, vol
untarily it is true, and one man
i rule has now been established.
Great Progress
All of this is not to say that De
Gaulle's rule has been without
accomplishments. Certainly it
must be recognized that great
! progress has been made especially
, in the field of colonial affairs.
However, it must also bo remem
bered that these steps were not
I taken within the democratic tradi
tion but rather through the auto
cratic methods of a man who de
j sires to lead a nation like a libera
i tion army.
