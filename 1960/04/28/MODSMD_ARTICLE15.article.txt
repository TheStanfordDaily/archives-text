After his visit 1o Washington, it I
can be said that on the German 1
question Gen. de Gaulle is now
the leader and the chief spokes-j
man of the Western alliance. It
was high time for a change. For 1
until recently we have had no Ger-1
i man policy. We have had only a |
tangle of slogans and fictions |
about reunification which could i
lead to no solution and settlement
I of the German problem, and were
| not seriously meant to do so.
Gen. de Gaulle has assumed the j
; leadership of the alliance by
j sweeping aside the hackneyed slo
| gan« and the equivocal fictions.
J He has given the alliance a new
i lead in how to think and how to
; talk about the cold war and about
I Germany.
Let us hope that the speech
i writers in the Pentagon and the
State Department will give close I
i attention to the change in style,
: which was demonstrated in the
press conference on Saturday and
the address to Congress on Mon
day.
Perhaps the greatest differ- j
i enee between Gen. de Gaulle's
way of thinking and (lie con
ventional thinking of the day is
that lie sees and treats the So
viet Union as primarily a Euro
pean great power, and only in- '
cidentally as the headquarters
j of world Communism. For liini
Russia existed long before Len
in and will exist long after
Khrushchev. Russia is a Euro
pean nation with national in- j
terests in Europe and the cen
tral clue to policy in dealing
with Russia is to be found not
i in the writings of Marx and
Lenin hut in the history of Rus
sia.
This does not mean that Com
' munism. which is a secular reli
j gion, does not play a great role
! in the Soviet Union and in its rela
tions with the rest of the world.
; What it does mean is that in
negotiating with the Soviet Union,
| the statesman should fix his eyes
i on the Russian national interest,
not let himself be razzle-dazzled
by the ideology.
i Having fixed hi-s eye on the
Russian national interest, on what
any Russian government would
protect or aim at, the statesman
| can know where lies the true area
;of negotiation. When he stands ,
"firm," as the saying goes, he
knows concretely where to stand 1
firm, where is the point at which !
Russia's national interests and
our should be accommodated.
Gen. de Gaulle is one whom
not the most foolish among us
would call soft on Communism.
And yet, when he speaks of the 1
Soviet Union, he does it with 1
cool and impeccable courtesy.
He does not stoop to the vulgar
epithets which the ghost writers
feel they must sprinkle through
almost every official utterance.
This courtesy comes from the
fact that Gen. de Gaulle sees
France and he sees Russia ys
perennial nations within a Euro
pean society.
This style and tone does not
j mean, as some may think, that
| Gen. de Gaulle is a lordly figure i
left over from another age. There
I is much reason flo think that in
| talking with Mr. K. as the head
iof one European power to the
head of another European power,
he holds the key which can unlock j
the door to a detente, that is to a
relaxation of tension.
The key to the door is that the
! national interest of France de
! mands that there shall be no re
i vival of pan-Germanism, and that
! even a political union of the two
1 contemporary Germanys should
I be put off for a long time. This is
also Russia's national interest.
Communist ideology no doubt de
mands the unification of all the
| Germans under a Communist
! state.
Kut the national interest of
Russia is different from that.
The Russian national interest

is to prevent the rise of so
formidable a competitive Com
munist power isi Furopc us all
the Germany* would make.
Russia has <|iiitc enough com
petition of that sort in China
and the rest of Asia
This is the reason why Ihe
Khrushchev-Do Gaulle talks have
been followed by such an improve
ment in the Climale. Undoubtedly
Gen. de Gaulle made it clear to
Khrushchev what is the French
interest in relation to the Ger
man question, and that at bottom
it is not radically different from
the Russian national interest.
Since then, Mr. K. has known
that if he wants to protect the
national interests of Russia in
Germany and in Eastern Europe,
an understanding is possible. Bui
if he wants to expand Commun
ism instead of protecting Russia,
he will run into a stone wall.
The reader must remember
that statesmen cannot say these
things in so many words. What
is happening cannot he openly
avowed officially or legalized in
formal documents. Many faces
will have to be saved.

i Having fixed hi-s eye on the

Gen. de Gaulle is one whom
not the most foolish among us
would call soft on Communism.
And yet, when he speaks of the 1
Soviet Union, he does it with 1
cool and impeccable courtesy.
He does not stoop to the vulgar
epithets which the ghost writers
feel they must sprinkle through
almost every official utterance.
This courtesy comes from the
fact that Gen. de Gaulle sees
France and he sees Russia ys
perennial nations within a Euro

left over from another age. There

iof one European power to the
head of another European power,
he holds the key which can unlock j
the door to a detente, that is to a
relaxation of tension.
The key to the door is that the
! national interest of France de
! mands that there shall be no re
i vival of pan-Germanism, and that
! even a political union of the two
1 contemporary Germanys should
I be put off for a long time. This is
also Russia's national interest.
Communist ideology no doubt de
mands the unification of all the
| Germans under a Communist

Kut the national interest of
Russia is different from that.
The Russian national interest

is to prevent the rise of so
formidable a competitive Com
munist power isi Furopc us all
the Germany* would make.
Russia has <|iiitc enough com
petition of that sort in China
and the rest of Asia
This is the reason why Ihe
Khrushchev-Do Gaulle talks have
been followed by such an improve
ment in the Climale. Undoubtedly
Gen. de Gaulle made it clear to
Khrushchev what is the French
interest in relation to the Ger
man question, and that at bottom
it is not radically different from
the Russian national interest.
Since then, Mr. K. has known
that if he wants to protect the
national interests of Russia in
Germany and in Eastern Europe,
an understanding is possible. Bui
if he wants to expand Commun
ism instead of protecting Russia,
he will run into a stone wall.
The reader must remember
that statesmen cannot say these

formal documents. Many faces

After his visit 1o Washington, it I
can be said that on the German 1
question Gen. de Gaulle is now
the leader and the chief spokes-j
man of the Western alliance. It
was high time for a change. For 1
until recently we have had no Ger-1
i man policy. We have had only a |
tangle of slogans and fictions |
about reunification which could i
lead to no solution and settlement
I of the German problem, and were
| not seriously meant to do so.
Gen. de Gaulle has assumed the j
; leadership of the alliance by
j sweeping aside the hackneyed slo
| gan« and the equivocal fictions.
J He has given the alliance a new
i lead in how to think and how to
; talk about the cold war and about
I Germany.
Let us hope that the speech
i writers in the Pentagon and the
State Department will give close I
i attention to the change in style,
: which was demonstrated in the
press conference on Saturday and
the address to Congress on Mon
day.
Perhaps the greatest differ- j
i enee between Gen. de Gaulle's
way of thinking and (lie con
ventional thinking of the day is
that lie sees and treats the So
viet Union as primarily a Euro
pean great power, and only in- '
cidentally as the headquarters
j of world Communism. For liini
Russia existed long before Len
in and will exist long after
Khrushchev. Russia is a Euro
pean nation with national in- j
terests in Europe and the cen
tral clue to policy in dealing
with Russia is to be found not
i in the writings of Marx and
Lenin hut in the history of Rus
sia.

Khrushchev what is the French
interest in relation to the Ger

it is not radically different from
the Russian national interest.

After his visit 1o Washington, it I
can be said that on the German 1
question Gen. de Gaulle is now
the leader and the chief spokes-j
man of the Western alliance. It
was high time for a change. For 1
until recently we have had no Ger-1
i man policy. We have had only a |
tangle of slogans and fictions |
about reunification which could i
lead to no solution and settlement
I of the German problem, and were
| not seriously meant to do so.
Gen. de Gaulle has assumed the j
; leadership of the alliance by
j sweeping aside the hackneyed slo
| gan« and the equivocal fictions.
J He has given the alliance a new
i lead in how to think and how to
; talk about the cold war and about
I Germany.
Let us hope that the speech
i writers in the Pentagon and the
State Department will give close I
i attention to the change in style,
: which was demonstrated in the
press conference on Saturday and
the address to Congress on Mon
day.
Perhaps the greatest differ- j
i enee between Gen. de Gaulle's
way of thinking and (lie con
ventional thinking of the day is
that lie sees and treats the So
viet Union as primarily a Euro
pean great power, and only in- '
cidentally as the headquarters
j of world Communism. For liini
Russia existed long before Len
in and will exist long after
Khrushchev. Russia is a Euro
pean nation with national in- j
terests in Europe and the cen
tral clue to policy in dealing
with Russia is to be found not
i in the writings of Marx and
Lenin hut in the history of Rus
sia.
This does not mean that Com
' munism. which is a secular reli
j gion, does not play a great role
! in the Soviet Union and in its rela
tions with the rest of the world.
; What it does mean is that in
negotiating with the Soviet Union,
| the statesman should fix his eyes
i on the Russian national interest,
not let himself be razzle-dazzled
by the ideology.
i Having fixed hi-s eye on the
Russian national interest, on what
any Russian government would
protect or aim at, the statesman
| can know where lies the true area
;of negotiation. When he stands ,
"firm," as the saying goes, he
knows concretely where to stand 1
firm, where is the point at which !
Russia's national interests and
our should be accommodated.
Gen. de Gaulle is one whom
not the most foolish among us
would call soft on Communism.
And yet, when he speaks of the 1
Soviet Union, he does it with 1
cool and impeccable courtesy.
He does not stoop to the vulgar
epithets which the ghost writers
feel they must sprinkle through
almost every official utterance.
This courtesy comes from the
fact that Gen. de Gaulle sees
France and he sees Russia ys
perennial nations within a Euro
pean society.
This style and tone does not
j mean, as some may think, that
| Gen. de Gaulle is a lordly figure i
left over from another age. There
I is much reason flo think that in
| talking with Mr. K. as the head
iof one European power to the
head of another European power,
he holds the key which can unlock j
the door to a detente, that is to a
relaxation of tension.
The key to the door is that the
! national interest of France de
! mands that there shall be no re
i vival of pan-Germanism, and that
! even a political union of the two
1 contemporary Germanys should
I be put off for a long time. This is
also Russia's national interest.
Communist ideology no doubt de
mands the unification of all the
