Educational Equality
Editor, the Daily:
In light of the recent series of '
articles on the Nashville sit-in
strikes, we first wish to express
our agreement with the statement
of tho Vanderbilt University fac
ulty which was quoted in the
second of the series.
We feel that the Negro should
have full equality, and we grant
that the Negro does not fully en
joy this equality in this country
today. Since the Supreme Court's
ruling in 1954, the Southern states
have made a real attempt to com
ply with the court's decision.
However, it is important to
realize that this decision is aimed
at legislation which affects not
the mind and rationality of the
southern man but that part of his
being which is often not govern
ed by reason.
Consequently, it is extremely
difficult for him to reconcile him
self to a new law which contra
dicts one of the firmly established
traditions in his background.
Many Southerners have come to
realize the importance and neces

sity of giving to everyone", regard
less of color, educational and civil
equality.
This, however, is a step which
some Southerners have yet to
take. Therefore, it seems lhat Ihe
energies of the participants in the
sit-in strikes could be directed to
ward fighting for educational
equality which should be their
primary concern at the present
time.
We would also submit that Ihe
Stanford student picketing is an

(empty gesture which accom-
I plishes virtually nothing.
Wo suggest that this energy
along with the contributions that
are being collected could be used
in establishing a permanent
scholarship fund to aid.Negro ed
ucation. Work of this sort would
be a step in achieving the goal of
educational equality which in
turn leads to social and cultural
: equality.
