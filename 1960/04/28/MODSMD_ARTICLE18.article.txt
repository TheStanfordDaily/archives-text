# THE 						Finish Line
## He Mixes His Sports 
### Dick Barnes 
You've just run a mile in 3:58.6 you've become the fastest-ever
American at four laps. So what are you going to do the next day?
"Go fishing," said Oyro! Burleson, when I posed that question
Saturday, shortly after he had whipped Ernie < unlitfe in the collegi
ate "mile of the century."
It wasn't really too surprising that Burleson was going fishing

in a way, it was almost surpris
ing that he hadn't gone Saturday
before the race lit was opening
day in Oregon 1. Burleson, a slim
19-year-old sophomore, is a quiet,
soft-spoken, confident individual
who seems perturbed by nothing
even a four-minute mile.
Several minutes after his run,
he appeared as fresh as when he
had started. Even while talking
to him. he excused himself for a
minute to go ask coach Bill Bow
crmun if he should run the 880
(Bowerman said it wasn't neces
sary). Burleson remarked, in fact,
that he feels the same after run
ning 4:20 as after running 4-flat.
How does a man work up to
a 3:58.6 race? For Burleson, the
proceeding week featured tune-up
work rather than anything very
heavy. Monday and Tuesday, he
had done fartleks (continuous
running at varying speeds) and
a few repeat 440's. Wednesday
and Thursday he merely jogged
lightly, about two miles each day.

Friday he did nothing. Saturday he ran 3:58.6. Sunday he went
fishing.
