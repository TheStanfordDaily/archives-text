# A 						Big Day in Oregon
## 
### 
Some have commented that Hon Kapo port's Daily story of the
race which described Saturday as a day of fulfillment for Oregon
overstated the case. It didn't.
The Oregon Daily Emerald, in a lead editorial, described the race
as "One of the biggest news events of the year as far as the Uni
versity is concerned." A crowd of probably more than 6,000 was ■
settled in Hayvvard Field long before the first event of the meet
and a good portion had been lined up before ticket windows opened.
Walking around Eugene the morning of the race, several people
immediately asked who I thought would win the race. Even walk
ing into a dorm at midnight the night before, the occupants were
quick to point out that "Burleson had stayed in that room last semes
ter"- and it "looked like a wheat germ factory."
The Eugene Register-Guard thought enough of the race to take
upwards of 50 pictures during the magic four minutes and the
few minutes immediately after.-
If these side details weren't sufficient, the picture of the 6.000 i
fans (an excellent crowd for a non-metropolitan area) standing and
screaming for virtually the entire race was enough to convince one
that this was Ihe state of Oregon's way of telling Ihe track world
it had arrived—just as Oregon State's PCC title had told the foot
ball world the same thing in '56.
The race and post-race hubbub had their funny (both peculiar
and ha-ha) moments. Six men lined up at the start—but it wasn't J
until Monday that we knew even as many as four had finished.
George Larson of Oregon stepped off the track as the gun
sounded. Then Wilcey Winchell. who had pressed Stanford's Norm
Lloyd for two and one-half laps, dropped out. That left Burleson,
Cunliffe, Lloyd and Stanford's Jeff Evans.
By the time Burleson and Cunliffe finished. Lloyd and Evans
were getting about as much attention as the hot-dog vendor at the
end of the stands.
Several minutes after the race, the announcer matter-of-factly
said, "Results of tin* mile run. Won by Dyrol Burleson of Oregon,
his time, three —" Then he was drowned out rather effectively. Final- 1
ly things quieted down enough so he could say Cunliffe had been
second in 4:00.4.
That didn't satisfy a few fans, who began yelling up to ask who
had finished third. Everyone figured Lloyd was the only man left,
so he was it he had been far back after Winchell dropped out. since
he was saving for the 880. Talking to Coach Payton Jordon Monday,
we found out Evans had finished, too a few yards behind Lloyd.
There was another laugh provided by Cunliffe he said after the
race that each time he came off the turn into the homestretch, all he j
could smell were the aromas from the aforementioned hot-dog ven- i
dor's stand.
Then, too, there was the newspaper story which said Ernie
finished 20 yards back. That 20 yards in the 1.8 seconds he finished
behind Burleson means Cunliffe finished at a pace equivalent to a !
9-flat 100. Actually, he was'l2 yards back, though UPI said 8, AP
said 15, and even the 20 appeared.

Some have commented that Hon Kapo port's Daily story of the
race which described Saturday as a day of fulfillment for Oregon
overstated the case. It didn't.
The Oregon Daily Emerald, in a lead editorial, described the race
as "One of the biggest news events of the year as far as the Uni
versity is concerned." A crowd of probably more than 6,000 was ■
settled in Hayvvard Field long before the first event of the meet
and a good portion had been lined up before ticket windows opened.
Walking around Eugene the morning of the race, several people
immediately asked who I thought would win the race. Even walk
ing into a dorm at midnight the night before, the occupants were
quick to point out that "Burleson had stayed in that room last semes
ter"- and it "looked like a wheat germ factory."
The Eugene Register-Guard thought enough of the race to take
upwards of 50 pictures during the magic four minutes and the
few minutes immediately after.-
If these side details weren't sufficient, the picture of the 6.000 i
fans (an excellent crowd for a non-metropolitan area) standing and
screaming for virtually the entire race was enough to convince one
that this was Ihe state of Oregon's way of telling Ihe track world
it had arrived—just as Oregon State's PCC title had told the foot
ball world the same thing in '56.
The race and post-race hubbub had their funny (both peculiar
and ha-ha) moments. Six men lined up at the start—but it wasn't J
until Monday that we knew even as many as four had finished.
George Larson of Oregon stepped off the track as the gun
sounded. Then Wilcey Winchell. who had pressed Stanford's Norm
Lloyd for two and one-half laps, dropped out. That left Burleson,
Cunliffe, Lloyd and Stanford's Jeff Evans.
By the time Burleson and Cunliffe finished. Lloyd and Evans
were getting about as much attention as the hot-dog vendor at the
end of the stands.
Several minutes after the race, the announcer matter-of-factly
said, "Results of tin* mile run. Won by Dyrol Burleson of Oregon,
his time, three —" Then he was drowned out rather effectively. Final- 1
ly things quieted down enough so he could say Cunliffe had been
second in 4:00.4.
That didn't satisfy a few fans, who began yelling up to ask who
had finished third. Everyone figured Lloyd was the only man left,
so he was it he had been far back after Winchell dropped out. since
he was saving for the 880. Talking to Coach Payton Jordon Monday,
we found out Evans had finished, too a few yards behind Lloyd.
There was another laugh provided by Cunliffe he said after the
race that each time he came off the turn into the homestretch, all he j
could smell were the aromas from the aforementioned hot-dog ven- i
dor's stand.
Then, too, there was the newspaper story which said Ernie
finished 20 yards back. That 20 yards in the 1.8 seconds he finished
behind Burleson means Cunliffe finished at a pace equivalent to a !
9-flat 100. Actually, he was'l2 yards back, though UPI said 8, AP
said 15, and even the 20 appeared.
