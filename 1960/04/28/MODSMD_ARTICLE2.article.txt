# Korea VP-Elect Killed by Son In Suicide Pact
## 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea (/P) The Seoul Martial Law Command
has announced that Vice President-elect Lee Ki-poong and his wife
and two sons committed suicide in a building on the grounds of
the presidential mansion about 5:40 a.m. Thursday (Korea time).
The family had disappeared from public view last week at the

height of the bloody uprising
against the now fallen govern
ment of Syngman Rhee.
Home Minister Le Ho was quoted
by a Korean news service as say
ing one of Lee's sons, Lt. Lee Kan
; Suk Rhee. who also is the adopted
: son of Rhee, shot and killed his
| father, his mother and a younger
brother, then turned the gun on
himself.
Lee Ki-poong. controversial and
| disavowed vice president-elect,
| was a chief target of antigovern
ment demonstrations that brought
the downfall of the Rhee govern
ment.
The news of the death of Lee
and his family shocked and
hushed South Korea's normally
noisy National Assembly. Word of
the shootings delayed opening of
ihe session called to accept
formally Rhee's resignation as
president.
New President
Meanwhile, a new, tough-mind
ed acting president turned to the
task of setting South Korea on a
democratic course after weeks of
bloody rioting.
One of the first public state
ments of Acting President Huh
Chung was aimed at what he
called waste and mismanagement
in the U.S. Korean aid program.
Simultaneously, the United States
held up approval of new economic
aid until South Korea gets back
to normal and some new condi
tions are met.
Huh, 64, a scholarly indepen
dent with a widespread reputation
for honesty, assumed full execu
tive powers Wednesday as soon
as Rhee announced his resigna
tion. He had the full support of
the National Assembly and the
army, still enforcing martial law
in the capital.
Back to Normal
University students who led the
rebellion began exhorting the pop
ulation to return to its normal
way of life.
Rhee, 83, partriarchal founder
of the republic, remained in liis
hillside mansion temporarily.
Huh, soft-spoken and bespec
tacled, summoned a news confer
ence and announced his intention
to push for improved relations
with Ihe United States and Japan.
He also promised to reform the
national policy, whose brutality
and political corruption helped
spark the revolt; to lift martial
law as soon as possible; and to call
new elections within the constitu
tional time limit of three months.
Huh will head a caretaker gov
ernment, working closely with the
Assembly. Ho said the strong
wish of the Assembly would be
to draft a constitutional amend
ment under which the president
still would be elected but the ex
ecutive power would be vested in
a cabinet whose premier would be
named by the president from the
ranks of the dominant, party.
U.S. Relations
Speaking of relations with the
United States, Huh said some un
satisfactory areas need collec
tion. These include, he said, waste
and mismanagement in adminis
tration of U.S. economic and mili
tary aid. Some of the U.S. aid
money has gone to develop indus
try. some to support the repub
lic's budget.
U.S. officials, suspending ap
proval of new fund allocations,
said there is nobody to deal with
on the Korean side until a new
cabinet is formed. Meetings of
the combined U.S.-Korean Eco
nomic Board, which oversees the
aid program, were canceled pend
ing appointment of a new recon
struction minister.
