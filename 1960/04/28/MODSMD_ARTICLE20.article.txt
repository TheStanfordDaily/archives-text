# What's to Come?

The natural question now is what lies ahead for Ounliffe and
Burleson. First off, it is doubtful that thov will meet again this year, i
Burly plans no trips to the big California relay and invitational
meets unless Herb Elliott competes at Fresno May 14 in which
case he wants a shot at the Aussie.
C'unliffe. meanwhile, is scheduled for his last double of the year
Saturday in the Stanl'ord-USC-Occidental triangular meet in Los
Angeles. After that, says Jordan, Ernie will stick to one race per
meet.
The one race will more than likely be the half-mile. Cunliffe has
proven he is an excellent miler but he has also proven he may be
the best 880 man in the world, and that his best Olympic bet is in ,
the metric half-mile, or 800 meters.
Assuming good track and weather conditions a week from Sat-!
urday, Stanford fans could see a world record in liig Meet. Not only
rioes C'unliffe have the advantage of an additional month of work
since his 1:47.3, but he will also have strong competition from Cal's
Jerry Siebert, who beat him in last year's Big Meet.
