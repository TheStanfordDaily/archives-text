# BUT LITTLE HOPE AGAINST USC
## Spikers Could Upset Occidental 
### 
Stanford hopes for its first track win since the
Fresno State meet look bright again this week
on paper. The Tribe meets USC and Occidental in
a double-dual meet in Los Angeles.
There is virtually no chance of breaking the
88-meot Trojan non-loss skein, but Stanford has
a good shot at its first win over Oxy since Payton
Jordan took over here.
Keys to a good Indian showing are strong 880-
mile doubles by Norm Lloyd and Ernie Cunliffe,
the continued good form shown by Dean Smith
in the sprints, and some decent performances by
the quarter-milers.
While Stanford's greatest strength is Cunliffe,
top U.S. half-mile and second-ranking miler, the
Trojans are strongest in the field, where they have
nationally-ranked men in every event.

Most notod this year has boon shot-putter Dallas
Long, a world-record holder early in the year but
now only third in the country at 1 -(> 1 .
Troy's Jim Wade tops the nation's discus throw
ers after his surprising 1)-«> 1 throw at Ml. SAC
last week. His best-previous was slightly over 177.
Another fast-improver has been Bob Sbordono,
presently number three among U.S. javelin throw
ers. He's thrown 256-10'j. USC has the second
ranking high jumper, Charlie Dumas at 7-. 1 a
Nationally speaking, USC is weakest in the
pole vault, where they dip to only ninth-best. Jim
Brewer, the prep record holder who hasn't hit
15 feet since high school graduation, is at 14-0.
USC has two men tied for seventh spots in
the broad jump Luther Hayes and Bill Jackson,
each at 24-10 ;, 4.
