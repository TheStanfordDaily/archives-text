# REVOLT?
## U.S.A. Must Meet World Poor Issue 
### Ross Hermann 
Unless the challenges offered
by the underprivileged peoples of
the world are met, the United
States will bo submerged in a
world-wide revolution, James P.
Warburg said yesterday.
Warburg, a member of FDR's
famous "brain trust," spoke on
"Reveille for Rebels."
To survive, the West must re
deem itself of past associations
and identify itself with the aspi
rations of the underprivileged for
equality and economic advance
ment, he said.
World Government
Looking into the future, War
burg predicted the emergence of
supra-national world organiza
tion. or world government.
He said it would come about
inevitably either by conquest or
choice by conquest if the West
falters, by choice by means of
democracy if the West meets its
responsibilities. If by conquest,
the result would be totalitarian,
but not necessarily Communist.
Warburg held further that com
munism, except in China, seems
to have run its course and is dy
ing. In Russia il has transformed
a backward nation into a modern
giant. Having to a large extent
accomplished this task, Commu
nism is beginning its demise be
cause it is no longer necessary.
I SS|{ May Catch USA
The people under communism
cannot indefinitely tolerate the
sacrifices necessary for economic
growth, he said. But this rate of
growth may continue long enough
to overtake U.S. supremacy.
Warburg said that the changes
in the world situation and in
American society are beginning
to make new demands on the po
litical system. Areas of political
conflict are no longer sectional,
but nation-wide.
The future will demand changes
in the political and economic sys
tem and perhaps intellectual re
bellion based on good judgment
and thorough investigation, he
said.
