# 'Kismet' Picks from Old Works
## 
### 
In the midst of "Kismet," Hajj,
a public poet, tolls his daughter,
"When you borrow property,
never overburden yourself; it im
pedes your progress."
Yet "Kismet," Ram's Head's
spring show which opens in Me
morial Auditorium next week, is
a stVange combination of modern
writing adapted from a 1911 play
and modern compositions bor
rowed from the classical works of
Russian composer Alexander
Borodin.
Authors Charles, Ledcrer and
Luther Davis created this musical
story of Ihc "Funniest Arabian
Night" from a play by Edward
Knoblock starring Otis Skinner.
Composers Borrow
Composers Robert Wright and
George Forrest borrowed freely
from Borodin to produce such
musical hits.
"Kismet" is seldom seen in pro
duel ion by amateur companies,
since it is a demanding score to
sing and a score few amateur or
chestras will tackle. Ram's Head
has obtained Everett. Nygaard,
San Francisco light opera star,
to play the leading role.
Cast Members
Nygaard is backed by Stanford
secretary and former professional
entertainer Donna D'Fini as the
daughter, Marsinah. Judy Water
man, wife of a Business School
student, plays the seductive La
lume.
Musical director and conductor
for the show is graduate student
David Williams, who wrote the
review "Six Appeal" which toured
the Bay Area last summer. His
30-piece orchestra is composed of
both professional and student mu
sicians.
Tickets for "Kismet," which
will run May 4-7, are being sold
at Engineering Corner daily from
9 a.m. to noon. They are also
available at the Memorial Audi
torium Box Office, DA 3-0665.
Reservations can be made by mail
