## New Judge for Hoffa's Trial 
### 
WASHINGTON (TP) One fed
crcl judge stopped aside yesterday
from presiding over Teamsters
Unio.n President James R. Hoffa's
ouster trial. A seeond judge took
over and quickly rejected a Hoffa
move to delay the case.
F. Dickinson Letts, tho 85-year
old U.S. district judge who creat
ed tho monitor system supervis
ing Hoffa's rule of I he Teamsters,
disqualified himself on the basis
of Hoffa's charges of bias.
Letts said that, without any in
tention of admitting any truth in
the bias charges, he had no choice
under the law but to step aside
once the charges were raised.
In what one of the opposing at
torneys called a "double lateral
forward pass," the case then went
to Chief Judge David A. Pine who
quickly assigned Judge Joseph R.
Jackson to sit as trial judge in
place of Letts.
He immediately began hearing
pretrial motions. Teamsters law
yers pleaded for a trial delay un
til various motions still pending
before Letts and the U.S. Court
of Appeals are decided.
"Denied," Jackson said crisply
the moment arguments ended.
