# Bookstore Open to Full Capacity
## 
### 
A booklover's dream, the new $300,000 bookstore, opened in its
full capacity this week as transfer of all stock from the old building
was completed.
A broad selection of gifts and accessories is now offered in addi
tion to the books which have been available since the beginning of
spring quarter.
Just inside the main entrance, facing Lausen Street, is the new
gift section, including displays of greeting cards, stationery, and
art and engineering supplies.
To the left is a hook information center and order desk, dubbed
the "bull-pen." The "bull-pen" lias an up-to-the-minute stock control
record so that orders can bo left for boojvs not in stock.
In addition to the 4,000 titles in paperbacks, there are 10,000
to 12.000 textbooks and "general hardbacks," as well as 2,000 books
in the engineering and scientific fields.
Mezzanine Accommodations
Classroom texts, along with offices, are located on the mezzanine.
Against the north wall of the mezzanine is a large section devoted
entirely to technical and scientific works, including those in
foreign languages.
Professional opinion in the bookselling trade, which has watched'
the construction of the store with interest, indicates that it is the;
finest of its kind in western America. The building was designed
by John Carl Warnecke and Associates of San Francisco.
A dominant feature of the spacious interior of the store is the
100-foot skylight, which forms the peak of the roof.
The stairway leading to the mezzanine is made from pre-cast
concrete treads laid on a free standing supporting structure divided i
at the foot with a small landing.
Due to lavish use of glass instead of solid walls, display space
has been recovered by shrewdly planted pegboard structures among
the "islands" of display cases on the main floor. Even the ends of
bookcases have been turned into cork-lined bulletin boards.
Spotted strategically throughout the store are benches fitted,

wilh foam rubber. Naugahyde-covered cushions for browsers. Walls
a 1 tho north and south ends of the main floor are corkfaced for
display of art prints, and a special print drawer cabinet will store
many more.
Warnecke has achieved a significant concept in the design of Ihe
bookstore and its newly dedicated neighbor, the Post Office, develop
ing a style which was immediately named "contemporary Stanford."
Keeping the University's traditional buff exterior walls and red-tiled
roofs, he has created grace and lightness in his use of pre-cast con
crete uof beams which were hoisted into place by crane.
The breezy arcades which connect the bookstore with the Post
Office are made of a series of arches which were cast in special
forms, then hoisted into position. The columns, which with the
arches derived from the original Quad, were cast in place with a*
special aggregate, then sandblasted to obtain the proper texture.
'Ingenious Architectural Treatment'
"These ingenious architectural treatments turned out to be the
most practical and least expensive method of getting the effect we
wanted," said Hairy Sanders, acting director of planning for Stan
ford.
The half-million dollar bookstore is a ■ far cry from the little
shack set up by students in IX9I on what is now the library lawn.
As demands grew, a faculty team was appointed to survey the
problem. The professors borrowed $15,000 and started the Stanford
bookstore in the spring of 1897 as a cooperative enterprise in which
profits were shared with Ihe customers. The store is still operated
that way.
The second bookstore, at Lomita Drive and Panama Street, re
mains today as the Daily shack.
Now the old bookstore, which has stood on its present corner
at Lausen and Eseondido since just before the 1900 earthquake, is
headed for a new chapter. It will undergo a $30.00(1 transformation
into a Western Civilization library for freshmen.

bookstore and its newly dedicated neighbor, the Post Office, develop
ing a style which was immediately named "contemporary Stanford."
Keeping the University's traditional buff exterior walls and red-tiled
roofs, he has created grace and lightness in his use of pre-cast con
crete uof beams which were hoisted into place by crane.
The breezy arcades which connect the bookstore with the Post
Office are made of a series of arches which were cast in special
forms, then hoisted into position. The columns, which with the
arches derived from the original Quad, were cast in place with a*
special aggregate, then sandblasted to obtain the proper texture.
'Ingenious Architectural Treatment'
"These ingenious architectural treatments turned out to be the
most practical and least expensive method of getting the effect we
wanted," said Hairy Sanders, acting director of planning for Stan
ford.
The half-million dollar bookstore is a ■ far cry from the little
shack set up by students in IX9I on what is now the library lawn.
As demands grew, a faculty team was appointed to survey the
problem. The professors borrowed $15,000 and started the Stanford
bookstore in the spring of 1897 as a cooperative enterprise in which
profits were shared with Ihe customers. The store is still operated
that way.
The second bookstore, at Lomita Drive and Panama Street, re
mains today as the Daily shack.
Now the old bookstore, which has stood on its present corner
at Lausen and Eseondido since just before the 1900 earthquake, is
headed for a new chapter. It will undergo a $30.00(1 transformation
into a Western Civilization library for freshmen.
A booklover's dream, the new $300,000 bookstore, opened in its
full capacity this week as transfer of all stock from the old building
was completed.
A broad selection of gifts and accessories is now offered in addi
tion to the books which have been available since the beginning of
spring quarter.
Just inside the main entrance, facing Lausen Street, is the new
gift section, including displays of greeting cards, stationery, and
art and engineering supplies.
To the left is a hook information center and order desk, dubbed
the "bull-pen." The "bull-pen" lias an up-to-the-minute stock control
record so that orders can bo left for boojvs not in stock.
In addition to the 4,000 titles in paperbacks, there are 10,000
to 12.000 textbooks and "general hardbacks," as well as 2,000 books
in the engineering and scientific fields.
Mezzanine Accommodations
Classroom texts, along with offices, are located on the mezzanine.
Against the north wall of the mezzanine is a large section devoted
entirely to technical and scientific works, including those in
foreign languages.
Professional opinion in the bookselling trade, which has watched'
the construction of the store with interest, indicates that it is the;
finest of its kind in western America. The building was designed
by John Carl Warnecke and Associates of San Francisco.
A dominant feature of the spacious interior of the store is the
100-foot skylight, which forms the peak of the roof.
The stairway leading to the mezzanine is made from pre-cast
concrete treads laid on a free standing supporting structure divided i
at the foot with a small landing.
Due to lavish use of glass instead of solid walls, display space
has been recovered by shrewdly planted pegboard structures among
the "islands" of display cases on the main floor. Even the ends of
bookcases have been turned into cork-lined bulletin boards.
Spotted strategically throughout the store are benches fitted,

wilh foam rubber. Naugahyde-covered cushions for browsers. Walls
a 1 tho north and south ends of the main floor are corkfaced for
display of art prints, and a special print drawer cabinet will store
many more.
