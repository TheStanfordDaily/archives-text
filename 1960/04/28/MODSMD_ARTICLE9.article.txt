## 
### 
Plans to renovate and re-open
the Cardinal Theater in Palo Alto
as the Fine Arts, featuring exclu
sive foreign films, have been an
nounced by the owners and man
agement of the Guild Theater,
Menlo Park.
The Fine Arts will open May IS
with Jean-Paul Sartre's adapta
tion of Arthur Miller's "The Cru
cible," starring Academy Award
winning actress Simone Signoret
and Yves Montand. The film was
produced in France.
The theater will follow a policy
similar to that of the Guild, pre
senting the best international
films with English subtitles. A 1
Laurice will be manager.
With two such theaters the
management hopes to provide
more frequent and varied pro
grams to meet the demands of
increased patronage.
Until shortly before May 18 the
Cardinal will continue to show a
selection of motion pictures un
der its present policy.
