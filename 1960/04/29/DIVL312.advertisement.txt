my cuff links...but get your own
LOOK FOR THE BLUE LABEL •
YOU TELL HER, MAN. The Court King is your shoe...professional traction-tread soles,
flexible instep, full cushioning. A pro on the tennis court, but just as right with slacks.
A GIRL HAS RIGHTS. Like having a Champion Oxford made just for women. Comes with
fashionable new taper toe-or round toe, if preferred. Light in weight, cool and colorful.
Get U.S. KEDS-male or female-at any good shoe or department store.
