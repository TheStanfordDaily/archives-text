# Royse Edges Purcell; NSA Trounced
## Shepp Defeats Nordbye For Men's Council Post 
### 
The associated students .yesterday elected Larry Royse their
president by a narrow margin over Ken Pureed. Royse, also the
leader in primary balloting, received 120 1 votes to Purcell's 1021.
The controversy over whether to join the National Student Assn.
was settled decisively. The proposal to join the Association was
rejected by a vote of 1133 to 671. Royse opposed the proposal;
Purcell favored it.
Summarizing the position of the present student administration
on the NSA matter, Student Financial Manager Bob Best said:
"1 think il is partially a vote ol confidence in the Legislature,
since that body voted*against the measure before putting it on the
ballot. I think it is also partially a vote on the part of students
who realized that they don't know enough about it."
Following his election, Royse commented, "1 feel that the
decisive defeat of NSA propoal indicates that a thorough investi
gation of the issue is warranted, and actually, it will be more prac-

tical to work from the angle of
strengthening natural oullets for
student opinion on campus such
as the Political Union and the lIR
Board."

Commenting on his defeat, Pur
cell said, '1 appreciate the 1,000
odd votes 1 received, and I view
this as an indication by the stu
dent body that ii is interested in
a more imaginative and aggres
sive .student government a stu
dent government which will chal
lenge them with the kind of
thought'• provoking issues with
which they should become con
cerned. IVIy hope is that my per
sonal defeat will not mean the
defeat of the ideas which I tried
to present to the student body."
