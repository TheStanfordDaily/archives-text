## 
### 
â€¢Stanford's student legislature
voted last night to give ASSU ap
proval to campus collections for
the legal defense of Southern Sit
in Movements.
Legislature members comment
ed thai the drive has been oper
ated in violation of ASSU rules
for the last two weeks and that
il was "a Legislature mistake" to
have taken no action for this long.
Legislature also approved pre
liminary 19(50-61 budgets for
the Speech Association, Political
Union, Fundamental Standard
Commission and Cardinals Board.
The budgets will be presented
again in about four weeks for
final approval in the complete
ASSU budget.
The planned $1,798 Speech As
sociation budget is $80 higher
than last year, and Political Un
ion's $198 budget (plus $-100 in de
ferred items) was increased $120.
