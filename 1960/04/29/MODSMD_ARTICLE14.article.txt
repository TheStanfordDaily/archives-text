Last quarter llie Daily presented a discussion of tlie midterm
system at Stanford in a series of editorial comments and letters
of student opinion. This question again becomes pertinent in
light of Dean Philip Khinelander's article in today's Daily con
cerning the functions and objectives of the School ol Humanities
and Sciences.
The goals of the School are hroadh and liberalh conceived.
If the general emphasis, however, is to be on deepening students*
understanding "without reference to the particular career of call
ing that (one) may subsequently enter,"' then the compulsory
midterm often exists as a basic contradiction to the School s goals.
In manv instances where the midterm is employed, it is diffi
cult to justif\ it as contributing to the students desire to acquire
knowledge for its own sake.
Often it is tbe student himself who encourages the atomiza
lion of course material which results from frequent occurrence
of the midterm examination.
There is an incrrfising tendency among professors to put the
question of midterms to a class vote. These voles at times, how
ever, serve to perpetuate the institution of the midterm. This
often appears incompatible with genuine intellectual curiosity.
I lie success of the goals of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences cannot lie determined b\ the frequenc\ of midterm exami
nations. Hut the present policy of the School to de-emphasize
the midterm indicates that the frequency of examinations must
be a contributing factor in the realization of the School's aims.
Achievement of these goals, then, is dependent upon the atti
tude of the students as well as the academic direction of the
faculty. Those who deem the compulsory midterm a necessity
in a system designed to encourage intellectual curiosity appar
ently fail to comprehend Dean Hhinelander s objectives.
