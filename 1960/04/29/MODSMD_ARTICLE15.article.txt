# Lack of Concern
## 
### 
No one will come to knock on your door and demand a dollar
minimum from yon to aid students in the South. on will not
he asked to solicit funds from Palo \I to residents, to vote for
a king and a queen, to set up a hooth.
But we cannot help thinking that the walk to Kngineering
Corner and the dollar deposited there might he worth more than
a dollar spent almost anvwhere else. I hat particular dollar will
help to abolish segregation in the South and to protect human
dignity in the I nited States.
It should not he too mueh to ask our students to he aware
of the plight of students in the South. However, it is apparcnth
100 much to ask them to he seriously concerned if one is to judge
In the mere $602.07 collected up to now.
Toda\ is the last day of collection. We hope loda\"s total will
indicate hoth awareness and concern.
