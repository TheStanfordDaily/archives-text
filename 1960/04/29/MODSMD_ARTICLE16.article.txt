It seems all hut certain that Monda\ will bring the end to the
si rumple for legal justice and human dignitv that has surrounded
the life of Can I Chessman. He must sacrifice his life to a law
thai no longer exists. The specific statute under which he was
convicted has since heen revoked. 11 was held to he too ambigu
ous a standard b\ which to judge a man's life.
California will soon represent to people all over the world
the epitome of legal inhumanity that arises from the application
of the death penalty. Chessman's death will he seen h\ millions
to he a mistake. For that mistake someone must accept the blame.
And, in the final analysis, that blame rests on the members of
the California Legislature and their constituents the people of
4 lalifornia.
Someday the death penalty will he abolished. We wonder if
in the meantime those who now support this inhuman practice
will feel a sense of accomplishment at Inning killed another of
societ \ "s transgressors.
