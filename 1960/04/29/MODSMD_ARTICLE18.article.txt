# Developing Intellectual Horizons Is Goal For School of Humanities and Sciences
## 
### Philip H. Rhinelander Dean of the School of Humanities Sciences 
The School of Humanities and
Sciences at Stanford was formed
in 1948 by the amalgamation of
four schools then existing, the
School of Humanities, the School
of Biological Sciences, the School
of Physical Sciences and the
School of Social Sciences.
As presently organized, the I
School of Human i t ie sand
Sciences includes 22 academic fie-;
partments, plus the three military I
service units which were added to ,
the school this year. These de-1
partments are as follows:
Air Science, Anthropology, Art i
and Architecture, Asian Lan
guages, Biological Sciences, Chem
istry and Chemical Engineering,
C 1 a s si c s , Communication and
Journalism, Economics, English, 1
Geography, History, Humanities,
Mathematics, Military Science
and Tactics, Modern European
Languages, Music, Naval Science,
Philosophy, Physics, Political;
Science, Psychology, Sociology,
Speech and Drama, and Statistics.
In addition, the School of Hu-j
manities and Sciences has respon- !
sibility for the Art Gallery, the
University Museum, Ihe National
History Museum, and the Hopkins j
Station at Pacific Grove.
In two senses, the School of Hu- j
inanities and Sciences may here-

I garded as the heart of the TTni-|
j versity:
1. Size. In I ho first place, it is
i by far the largest of the schools,
I in terms of faculty, students, and I
the amount of teaching per
formed. For the past few years,
the School has accounted for
j something over 65 per cent of the
student credit units earned in the
entire University.
In other words, the School of
(Humanities and Sciences per-!
â€¢ forms about twice as much teach
ing (measured by student credit
! units I as all the other schools put
I together. This includes teaching
| at both undergraduate and gradu
ate levels.
Distinctive Function
2. Functions and Objectives. The
two principal functions of thej
| school are teaching and scholarly)
research. Scholarly research is
1 carried on in each of the academic
i departments, in many cases with!
support from grants or gov/ern-j
ment contracts. In its research ac
tivities the School of Humanities
and Sciences does not differ ma-'
terktlly from the other schools of
the University, except in the par
ticular fields covered and in a
! relatively greater emphasis on
| "pure" rather than "applied" re
search.
However, the school performs a
distinctive function in respect to
i teaching. Whereas each of the
other schools is a professional
school, Business, Education, Engi
neering, Medicine, Mineral Sci- j
; ences and Law, each of I hem being
concerned with the preparation of
i students for a part icular' profes
sion or vocation, the School of
Humanities and Sciences is, broad
ly speaking, non-professional in
orientation, especially at the un-
I dergraduate level.
Graduate Student
Of course, a graduate student
' in a particular department in the
I school (e.g., in Economics, History
or Physics) who is preparing
himself for- a career' in teaching
or research, it to that extent en
gaged in professional training,
and some undergraduates who
have already elected to pursue
scholarly careers fall into the
i same category.
Nevertheless, the general em
phasis of the school is on develop
ing the intellectual abilities of the
student, broadening his knowl
edge, improving his discernment,
quickening his appreciation, and
deepening his understanding,
without reference to the particu
lar career or calling that he may
subsequently enter. In this sense,
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences is devoted primarily to lib
j eral education rather than to tech
i nrcal or vocational education.
It is not appropriate here to
argue the case for liberal educa

tion in today's world. Suffice it !
is to say that no university has
ever been great as a university
I emphasize greatness as a uni
versity, as distinguished from
greatness as a technical school or
professional institute which has
lacked eminence in the field of lib
eral educat ion.
By liberal education T do not
mean simply instruction in the so
called liberal arts, though this is
an important ingredient. I mean
rather the kind of education
which is designed primarily to
give the student a desire to ac
quire knowledge for its own sake
and not simply for the profession
al or social advantages to be
gained from it. I believe that this
is less a matter of the particular
subject matter than of the aims
and quality of the teaching.
-'Hence, scientific subjects are as
much a part of liberal education
as music, art and literature, pro
vider! they are presented to the
student in a manner to broaden
his intellectual horizons and
kindle his enthusiasm for learn
ing, regardless of the particular
field he elects to enter.
Primary Objective
For the School of Humanities
and Sciences this objective is
primary, rather lhan incidental,
and it is devotion to this overrid
ing aim which, in my view, gives
unity of purpose to the various
academic departments within the
school.
The program of General Studies
which was introduced in 1956 di
rectly implements this objective.
It is designed, broadly speaking,
to require every undergraduate to
take a selection of courses outside
his particular field of concentra
tion to broaden his intellectual ex
perience and interests. It is a gen
eral policy that the courses which
may be taken to satisfy the Gen
| eral Studies requirement be de
signed, not to disseminate learned
information to be absorbed me
! chanically, but to stimulate the
! student to critical inquiry con
cerning the materials presented.
Effect of Program
1 The effect of this program is to
guarantee that all undergradu
ates, regardless of their special
i field, shall receive the elements of
| a liberal education, and it is no
i accident that almost all the
| courses eligible for credit under
the General Studies program fall
| under one or another of the de
partments in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences. By force of
this program every undergradu
ate takes a large portion of his
course work in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences even
though he concentrates in another
school. The large majority of un
dergraduates takes virtually all
'course work in this school.
