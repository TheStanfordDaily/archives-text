Right Facts
liditor, the Daily:
Mr. Walter Lippmann is not
.supposed to like autocratic
methods very much, and I am
glad that he gave an opposite
view to ihe one exhibited by Dick
White in his article about De
Gaulle. However, I want to stress
here some errors or fallacies
which I found in it.
1. Although De Gaulle has writ
ten a book about tanks, he has
never been famous as a "great
military strategist." He has been
a political man (right or wrong)
for the last 20 years.
2. I am the first one to criticize
some of his actions, but 1 would
never, nor would most of the
French, say that he is not in
terested in the individual. Granted
that he is proud, that he wants
prestige and grandeur, but one
cannot say he is living in the
abstract. His autobiography, his
speeches, and. I dare say, up to
now his acts, testify this.
3. Mr. White seems to ignore
that there are at least two forms
of representation, the direct and
indirect ones. In the latter, adopt
ed by both the U.S.A. and France,
the elected body is not propor
tional to the national results but
to the state or "department" re
sults.
Moreover, there were not 2.'5 per
cent of the electors who voted
communist in 1958, but 18.9 per
cent (check in "Le Monde" micro
film i against 215.4 per cent in
1931 and 25.7 per cent in 1956. . . .
Finally, I would have liked to
see the difference made between
an autocratic and a "strong execu
tive" regime, referring to the
U.S.A. for instance.
I am ready to argue with Mr.
Dick White, and I am sure we
might agree on many French in
ternal and external issues. But any
valuable discussion or opinion
must be based on right facts.
This was not the case.
