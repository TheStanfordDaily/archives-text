at 3:1."5. The two teams tangle
again tomorrow at 2 p.m.

fourth place despite their fine
performance of last weekend. The
one loss was to USC, rated num
ber one team in the country by
Collegiate Baseball, a national col
lege baseball newspaper.
Pepperdine boasts a remark
able 21-7 record and is rated 20th

of just 1,000, has defeated many
of the nation's strongest teams.

(he timely hitting of catcher and
team captain, Clark Rex.

close games, but he has a 2.66
ERA for the season.
Jim Smith hero of last week
end's win over USC, will get the
call tomorrow. Smith is now 3-3

weeks of the season with a pinch
ed nerve in his arm, is now ready
to resume his catching chores, ac
cording to Fehring. He may lie
used at first base again this week

a lefthander. Winter replaced the
slumping Lee Moench at first
base last weekend.

to keep his streak alive, will start
Marv Mecklenberg on the mound
against the Waves today. Meck
lenberg, who now has a 5-5 record,
absorbed the loss to USC last

weekend. The Card lefthander
pitched well enough to win most
games, allowing just six hits
which the Trojans made good for
three runs.
Mecklenberg has lost several
close games, but he has a 2.66
ERA for the season.
Jim Smith hero of last week
end's win over USC, will get the
call tomorrow. Smith is now 3-3
on the year with a 1.59 ERA.
Jay Winter, who missed two
weeks of the season with a pinch
ed nerve in his arm, is now ready
to resume his catching chores, ac
cording to Fehring. He may lie
used at first base again this week
end, especially if the Waxes start
a lefthander. Winter replaced the
slumping Lee Moench at first
base last weekend.
In other CIBA play today, Cali

fornia travels to USC for a show
down between the two top teams,
and Santa Clara will take on
UCLA. Tomorrow the Bears move
