# Card Netmen Set for Bears
## 
### John Schwarz 
California Tennis Coach Chet
Murphey xvho is currently in his
first year 1 of coaching on the West
Coast will bring his young Bear
netters to Stanford this weekend
to play Stanford in the first of
txvo "Big Matches" to be played
in 1960.
The match will begin at 1 p.m.
tomorrow with the second match
to be played a week front tomor
row at Berkeley.
The 195(3 season xvas the last
lime a Bear net team could
garner a victory over the Indians
and since then they have been
losing by wide margins.
One tiling which could be said
in defense of Murphey and the
Bears, hoxvever, is that they have
to meet probably iho toughest
tennis opponents available in the
college field.
To add a little bit more burden
on the Bears this weekend, Stan

ford will be at its strongest in
weeks. Norm Earns, thought to
be out for the season with a bro
ken leg has pulled a superman re
covery and will be ready for to
morrow's match.
With Earns back, the lineup for
the Indians will probably read
something like Dick Ogden, Jim
Jeffries, Dick Gould, Norm Earns,
Dick Mosk, and George Bates in
the one through six singles re
spectively. Jeffries and Ogden,
Gould and Bates, and Earns and
either Mosk or Gil Ranney will
be paired up in doubles.
Cal's lineup xvill probably be
Hoogs, Farrell, Chandler, Eono,
Welles, and Lloyd, playing the
one through six singles with
Hoogs and Chandler, Eono and
Lloyd, and Welles and Farrell in
doubles.
