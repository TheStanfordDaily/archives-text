## 
### Ron Ropoport 
A situation whore second host will be just fine presents itself to Stanford's track loam tomor
row, as the thinclads faee Southern California and Occidental on the Oxy campus.
The Tribe will concede the triangular to the Trojans and try to edge out Occidental for second
place honors.
The Troyboys' power is ridiculous and takes all the fun out of the game. Dallas Long will win

the shot put. Jim Wade will win
the discus, Bob Sbordone will win
the javelin, Charlie Dumas will
wil the high jump and Luther
Hayes or Bill Jackson will win the
broad jump. There'll be no con
test in these events.
Brewer Good
It's a little closer in some of
the other events, but SC will win
more than its share. Jim Brewer
pole vaults in the neighbor hood of
14-0. but should get some competi
tion from Oxy's Tim Helms and
Dan Copp. Helm has gone 14-8
this year and Copp has hit 14-6.
In the 10(1 SC has Jim Bates
with a best mark of 9.(5. He will
go against Oxy's Doug Smith
who lost to Chris Knott of UCLA
in 9.4 earlier this year and Stan
ford's Dean Smith and Norm
Pease.
The 220 figures to be close also
as Bates has a best of 21.1 and
Doug Smith has a 21.2 to his
credit. Dean Smith and Pease will
again do the honors for the Tribe.

the mile and the 880 tomorrow
and should win both. Chances are

of two races, but 10 points are 10
points.
