# Indian Crews Face Huskies
## 
### 
The Indian crew travels to Se
attle this week to meet the Uni
versity of Washington Huskies on
Lake Washington. This promises
to be a tough race for the Stan
ford crew as Washington is one
of the best crews in the nation.
The Husky varsity has turned
in a 6:08 2,000 meters so far this
year which is a very commend
able time. In an interclass race
the Washington frosh came in
1/5 second behind the varsity in
the 2,000 meter race.
The race this week will be three
miles for the varsity and JV with
the frosh rowing two miles. This
longer race is rowed differently
than the 2,000-meter sprint and
emphasis is placed on strength
and endurance. The Indians are
in condition for the long race, but
will face their toughest competi
tion so far in the Huskies.
The varsity boat this week will
be the same one that went out
against UCLA with: Kent Mitch
ell at coxswain, John Fulop,
stroke, and Jon Loreen, Ward De-
Witt, Dick Grant, Rod Krebs, Ted
Hulbert, Dick Lyon, and Mike
Jackson adding power.
