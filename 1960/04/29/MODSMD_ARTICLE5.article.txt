# RHEE RETIRES
## Korean Government Shakes-up Ministry 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea (/IV
Syngman Rhec faded into retire
ment Friday and his provisional
successor set a three-month dead
line for his aides to rid the coun
try of "long accumulated illegali
ties, injustices and corruption."
Political illegalities and deep
popular suspicion of corruption
sparked the demonstrations which
forced the resignation of strong
man lihee, founder of the repub
lic and its first and only presi
dent. But yesterday he was hailed
as ;i patriot by the very students
whose violent demonstrations top
pled his 12-year-old regime.
A picture of patriarchal trag
edy, he was cheered as he left the

presidential palace with grief
etched on his craggy countenance
over the suicide-pact death of his
protege, Lee Ki-poong.
Acting President Huh Chung,
who has a reputation for rugged
independence and political hon
esty, moved swiftly to sol the na
tion on an even course.
The 64-year-old provisional chief
named six new ministers and
planned to name two more to fill
out a 12-man government. He
told his ministers their supreme
task is "to get rid completely of
the long accumulated illegalities,
injustices, corruption and other
disorders in various departments
of the administration."
