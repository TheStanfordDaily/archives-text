# Brown Refuses Chessman Stay
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (/Pi Governor
Blown said no again yesterday to
two of Caryl Chesman's attor
neys.
But A. L. Wirin and Rosalie
Asher came out of a half-hour
conference expressing confidence
that Brown will not let Chessman
die Monday as scheduled.
"The governor went out of his
way to impress upon us that he
would do nothing," admitted Wir
in, an attorney for the American
Civil Liberties Union.
"But we are confident that
when all the chips are down the
governor will do the same thing
he did last time." Last Feb. 19
Brown granted Chessman a re
prieve.
