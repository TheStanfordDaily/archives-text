# Hula Hoops Used In 'Kismet' Set
## 
### 
Ai its premiere Wednesday
night, the Ram's Head produc
tion of "Kismet" will unveil sev
eral unusual scenic and costum
ing effects.
For each of its two full-stage
curtains an d in set design
throughout the show, over 320
gilded hula hoops are being used.
The idea for this "outside equip
ment" came from designer Bill
Eddelman of Reno, Nevada.
The problem of creating 140
costumes for the show was made
easier by Eddelman also. The
long, flowing robes of most of
the male cast members will be
bedspreads, which are "bright
and colorful and a big help," ac
cording to costume executor Jane
Nugent.
Tickets for "Kismet," starring
Everett Nygaard, are available
at Memorial Auditorium box of
fice from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily.
The production runs through Sat
