# HOSTEL IN SANTA CRUZ
## Kerensky: War Means Annihilation 
### Ross Hermann 
A third World War could result in the ex
termination of ihe white race. Alexander
Kerensky told members of a hostel at Bould
er Creek in the Santa Cruz Mountains this
weekend.
The hostel, led by Kerensky and Dr. Wi
told Sworakowski of the Hoover Institution,
was entitled "Russia and Its Satellite States."
Kerensky, a research specialist at Hoo
ver, was premier of the Russian provisional
government during the H)l7 revolution.
Sworakowski is assistant director and the
head of the Eastern European Division of
Hoover Institution.
Asked about the probability of a third
World War, Kerensky said that it is impos
sible to predict what people will do because
"the stupidity of mankind is limitless."
Doom tor Whites
We must consider, he said, who would be
exterminated in a war between the United
States and Russia. It is certain that the
Caucasian people would be greatly reduced,
resulting in a larger proportion of colored
peoples.
Sworakowski. however, felt that atomic
weapons would noi be used in another war.

He based this belief on the fact that both
sides have nuclear capacity.
Kerensky thought that they would be
used but that Russia does not yet have suf
ficient numbers of ballistic missiles to wage
effective warfare.
Both men agreed, however, that it is not
in Russia's interest to instigate a war. They
have too much to lose and too little to gain.
Kusvia Sitting Tight
"They are sitting tight," Sworakowski
said, "waiting'for economic crises to bring
about a weakening of democracy and west
ern institutions." He -said though that they
are willing to go to the brink of war to gain
their cold war objectives.
When asked as to the possibilities of liv
ing peacefully with Russia, neither man ex
pressed optimism. Kerensky said that the
world "must have a profound moral revolu
tion" the spiritual level must be raised
before the ideals of peace and goodwill can
be achieved.
They can come about, ho said, only
through more suffering. He implied that it
is open to question whether they can ever
be achieved in view of human suffering to
dale. Sworakowski stressed that these ideals

are not new to the world. An Indian ruler
1,000 years before the birth of Christ is
known to have proposed cooperation and the
end of all wars.
The situation between the United States
and Russia is particularly muddled. Swora
kowski said, by the different conceptions of
morality. Russian action, he said, is the re
sult of facing the present situation irrespec
tive of the past or future and treating it with
the greatest amount of expediency for the
furthering of Communism. This is complete
ly opposed to western morality which has
been traditionally based on a respect for
treaties, agreements, and prior commit
ments.
Relaxed Atmosphere
The two-day hostel, consisting of I~> stu
dents. was held at Camp Campbell near
Boulder Creek. Discussions on Sunday weix?
held in a small green meadow surrounded
by tall coast redwoods.
On Sunday morning, Kerensky led a
small group of happy, singing students on
a short hike through the redwoods. Prob
ably weary from the burdensome results of
the discussion, he requested that they sing
American, not Russian, songs.

weekend.
The hostel, led by Kerensky and Dr. Wi
told Sworakowski of the Hoover Institution,
was entitled "Russia and Its Satellite States."
Kerensky, a research specialist at Hoo
ver, was premier of the Russian provisional
government during the H)l7 revolution.
Sworakowski is assistant director and the
head of the Eastern European Division of
Hoover Institution.
Asked about the probability of a third
World War, Kerensky said that it is impos
sible to predict what people will do because
"the stupidity of mankind is limitless."
Doom tor Whites
We must consider, he said, who would be
exterminated in a war between the United
States and Russia. It is certain that the
Caucasian people would be greatly reduced,
resulting in a larger proportion of colored
peoples.
Sworakowski. however, felt that atomic
weapons would noi be used in another war.

He based this belief on the fact that both
sides have nuclear capacity.
Kerensky thought that they would be
used but that Russia does not yet have suf
ficient numbers of ballistic missiles to wage
effective warfare.
Both men agreed, however, that it is not
in Russia's interest to instigate a war. They
have too much to lose and too little to gain.
Kusvia Sitting Tight
"They are sitting tight," Sworakowski
said, "waiting'for economic crises to bring
about a weakening of democracy and west
ern institutions." He -said though that they
are willing to go to the brink of war to gain
their cold war objectives.
When asked as to the possibilities of liv
ing peacefully with Russia, neither man ex
pressed optimism. Kerensky said that the
world "must have a profound moral revolu
tion" the spiritual level must be raised
before the ideals of peace and goodwill can
be achieved.
They can come about, ho said, only
through more suffering. He implied that it
is open to question whether they can ever
be achieved in view of human suffering to
dale. Sworakowski stressed that these ideals

are not new to the world. An Indian ruler
1,000 years before the birth of Christ is
known to have proposed cooperation and the
end of all wars.
The situation between the United States
and Russia is particularly muddled. Swora
kowski said, by the different conceptions of
morality. Russian action, he said, is the re
sult of facing the present situation irrespec
tive of the past or future and treating it with
the greatest amount of expediency for the
furthering of Communism. This is complete
ly opposed to western morality which has
been traditionally based on a respect for
treaties, agreements, and prior commit
ments.
Relaxed Atmosphere
The two-day hostel, consisting of I~> stu
dents. was held at Camp Campbell near
Boulder Creek. Discussions on Sunday weix?
held in a small green meadow surrounded
by tall coast redwoods.
On Sunday morning, Kerensky led a
small group of happy, singing students on
a short hike through the redwoods. Prob
ably weary from the burdensome results of
the discussion, he requested that they sing
American, not Russian, songs.
