< lase historv: \ Stanford coed, lmlhered bv a painful mouth
infection, ambled over to the free, convenient Health Service for
some free, convenient treatment. As tlie fatherly doctor reassur
inglv held licr hand, he necked into her mouth.
"I.ook like perfectly healthy gums to me!"
Later diagnosis bv a dentist: a severe case of trench mouth.
(lase liistorv: A fraternity member, alarmed by swollen glands
in bis neck, decided to take advantage of the Health Service.
"Too much of that hectic fraternity life! A touch of mono:
better stav in bed for a week or so. *
Diagnosis bv a private physician: ulcers, which should have
been treated immediately.
The list of similar abuses is endless. As a result, most students
would "rather die" than he subjected to the whims of a service
which the I niversilv maintains supposedly to insure the health
and safety of its students.
Health Service doctors are very much aware of the mental and
emotional strain produced bv college life. I ndouhtcdlv, they rea
son, ninety-nine per cent of complaints are psychosomatic, a-fig
ment of the student s alreadv overworked imagination.
This explains the physicians'' constant concern for a patient's
eating and sleeping habits, hoping to attribute ev erv I h ing to mono.
"But are von feeling tired? Do vou seem to have enough ener
« y?" the doctor insists as a limping student tries to babble some
thing about spraining an ankle.
' Standard procedure at the Health Service is to sI;11> the guvs
on the back, hold the girls" bands, and explain liovv "we can t
alwavsfiml the reason for everv little burl." Standard advice: "Tf
it doesn't go avvav in a week, come back and v\«'*ll see w hat we
can do."
Sometimes a candy-coated pill can he administered for partial
relief.
If this doesn't convince the student that he is not wanted bv
the Health Service, he becomes a social problem. He returns and
the doctor explains how the rigors of I'niversilv life add to the
loree of "'those little hurts we can t alvvavs explain."
""II it doesn I go away in a week, come back and we'll see what
Ave can do."
Ibis time the student's folder is filed under II for hvpochon
driac. He is forced to either live with his maladv or seek treat
ment from a private physician. Most students choose the latter
alternative, and parents wonder why there are doctor bills when
"Stanford has a perfectly good Health Service, all for free."
Obviously the Health Service must realize that their "candv
pill" cure for everything is not tilling the needs of Stanford stu
dents. True, many complaints are unfounded, hut just as manv
are legitimate. Some attempt should be made to find the difference.
Maybe this problem is a result of a too-socialized medical pro
gram. Maybe it is a question of poor facilities or inadequate per
sonnel.
In any case, such a medical farce has no place at Stanford.
