Overseas
lOditor, The Daily:
I very strongly feel that a six
month session at one of Stan
ford's overseas study centers can
be an especially rewarding ex
perience for the student engineer,
and 1 am somewhat disappointed
that so few student engineers
apply for admission to such a
session, especially when their
chances of admission are just as
good as those of any other stu
dent.
The learning of a foreign lan
guage under almost ideal condi
tions, the stimulating atmosphere
of intellectual freedom at the
study center, the overseas per
spective of America, the intro
duction to the humanities, fine
arts, and social sciences, and the
maturing effect of meeting with
and mastering new and unusual
situations all combine to develop
the "whole man" in the student,
and this is particularly advan
tageous to the student engineer.

For the ultimate benefit of the
j School of Engineering, the over
seas study program, and the Uni
versity. in addition to the benefit
to the student himself, I would
like to urge the engineering stu
dent to avail himself of this once
in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Midterms
Editor, the Daily:
The system of abolishing mid
terms recently discussed in LAS
SU meetings has been lauded as
i a valuable way of releasing pres
i sure on students, etc. One of its
: greatest drawbacks, however, has
not been duly considered. Most
students, not being ideal models,
! will undoubtedly postpone learn
ing a whole quarter's material un
, til the last possible minute. They
: will cram for finals, thus defeat
ing their primary purpose to
learn.
