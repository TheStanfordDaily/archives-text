# Women's Living Groups Reflect Men's University
## 
### Nancy Ruf Contributing Editor 
Each year approximately lon
per cent of the freshman girls
leave Stanford, many of them to
attend colleges which have a more
receptive attitude towards women
as women.
Stanford is essentially a man's
university. The curriculum, the
buildings, and the living groups
arc designed for men, and the
women accepted by Stanford arc
| supposed to be able to compete
with them on their level.
Emphasis in the curriculum is

placed mainly on fields such as
math, chemistry, engineering, and
political seiencc. Rven the History
| of Western Civilization, a general
studies requirement, concentrates
; on the economic and political side
of history, with comparatively lit
tle study of the cultural aspects.
However. Stanford women can
not truly be justified in criticizing
| the educational program. Anyone
who comes to Stanford certainly
knows what to expect scholasti
cally.
The main problem lies in cam
pus living groups and residences.

The men have four choices. They
can he independent and live off
campus or in Stern, or they can
affiliate with eating clubs and
fraternities. In choosing an or
ganization to live with they are
sometimes sacrificing comfort
hut the advantages are ahout
equal on hoth sides.
All unmarried women under
twenty-three years of age have
but one choice. They must draw
for one of the four types of wom
en's residences oil campus. The
only difference in these resi
dences are the physical buildings
themselves. They are all univer
sity controlled, and all contain a
good cross-section of Stanford
women.
Independent women are perfect
ly satisfied with this. However,
some women would rather live
with women more like them
selves, or at least in a smaller
residence where they don't feel
like a little frog in a big pond.
For instance, even though the
Row residences are definitely
among the most dilapidated on
campus, there is stiff competition
for places there. The biggest
drawing power of the Row houses
is that the girls within them are
a small, usually closely knit group
who feel they are a part of some
thing special.
Florence Moore is also a dorm
in demand, but this is mainly due
to the comfort and convenience.
Many «irls don't want to live in
Florence Moore because of the
lack of individuality and an al
most "antiseptic" atmosphere.
Lagunita is a comfortable resi
dence, although by no means as
modern as Florence Moore. But
at least the Lagunita casas were
designed with some variety, and
the rooms are not all the same
size, shape, and color.
Union Residence is closer to an
ideal dorm, but it too is old and
somewhat removed from the
other living groups.
Stanford has been unrealisti
cally trying to promote equality
among tht» women, while at the
same time encouraging individu
ality among the men. What is not
taken into consideration is that
women are as diverse in their per
sonalities and preferences as men.

lack of individuality and an al
most "antiseptic" atmosphere.
Lagunita is a comfortable resi
dence, although by no means as
modern as Florence Moore. But
at least the Lagunita casas were
designed with some variety, and
the rooms are not all the same
size, shape, and color.
Union Residence is closer to an

somewhat removed from the
other living groups.
Stanford has been unrealisti
cally trying to promote equality
among tht» women, while at the

ality among the men. What is not
taken into consideration is that
women are as diverse in their per

Stanford is essentially a man's
university. The curriculum, the
buildings, and the living groups
arc designed for men, and the
women accepted by Stanford arc
| supposed to be able to compete
with them on their level.
Emphasis in the curriculum is

placed mainly on fields such as
math, chemistry, engineering, and
political seiencc. Rven the History
| of Western Civilization, a general
studies requirement, concentrates
; on the economic and political side
of history, with comparatively lit
tle study of the cultural aspects.
However. Stanford women can
not truly be justified in criticizing

who comes to Stanford certainly
knows what to expect scholasti
cally.
The main problem lies in cam
pus living groups and residences.

The men have four choices. They
can he independent and live off
campus or in Stern, or they can
affiliate with eating clubs and
fraternities. In choosing an or
ganization to live with they are
sometimes sacrificing comfort
hut the advantages are ahout
equal on hoth sides.
All unmarried women under
twenty-three years of age have
but one choice. They must draw
for one of the four types of wom
en's residences oil campus. The
only difference in these resi
dences are the physical buildings
themselves. They are all univer
sity controlled, and all contain a
good cross-section of Stanford
women.
Independent women are perfect
ly satisfied with this. However,
some women would rather live
with women more like them
selves, or at least in a smaller
residence where they don't feel
like a little frog in a big pond.
For instance, even though the
Row residences are definitely
among the most dilapidated on
campus, there is stiff competition
for places there. The biggest
drawing power of the Row houses
is that the girls within them are
a small, usually closely knit group
who feel they are a part of some
thing special.
