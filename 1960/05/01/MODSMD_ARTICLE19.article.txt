# Soph President to Seek Representative Ex-Com
## 
### 
Editor's note: At the climax of
| a heated controversy over
whether to abolish or revise ex
isting class government, Steve
.Miller was elected sophomore
class president. The following is
an outline of his platform, an at
tempt to improve hut maintain
I class organization.

The president would be the
most likely representative of the
class. To be effective, he would
need an ex-com which represents
; the entire class. I will therefore
try to select an ex-com which rep
; resents as wide a cross section of
the living groups as possible.
To eliminate the abuses of class
ex-coms:
• Meetings will be called only
: when necessary so that students'
1 time will not be wasted.
• No money from the class treas
ury will be used for ex-com social
function-s.
Our most important social func
tions, the sophomore reunion and
the cotillion, are already in early
planning stages.


STEVE MILLER
I will work with Ihe legislature
to bring the sophomore class a
representative seal on LASSU. At
the present time no sophomores
can be on LASSU.
