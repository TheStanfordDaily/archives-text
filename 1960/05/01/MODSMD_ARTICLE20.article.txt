# New Education Program Begun

### Daryl Glenney 
The Stanford School of Educa
tion is pioneering an elementary
education program which is de
signed to provide top-notch teach
ers for the increasing number of
positions in American elementary
schools. The basis is a fifth year
graduate plan which will offer
both the Master of Arts Degree
and the California Elementary
School Teaching Credential.
The new program, which is also
being initiated at Harvard, is
geared to the realization that
elementary school teachers need
a broad, general background to
effectively answer the questions
of the children they will teach.
Thus, education students will
complete the normal four years
of study with a wide variety of
courses, turning to the methodi
logioal, professional t e a c hi ng
courses only in their fifth year.
Dr. Paul R. Hanna, chairman of
Stanford's executive committee
on elementary school education,
explains, "Teachers must, not only
know youngsters, but they must
know enough about biological
•sciences, physical science, math,
the humanities, and the social
sciences to answer the wide range
of questions asked by young
sters."
Stanford, like most olher uni
versities. has previously offered
a four year program, including
specific education courses in the
last two undergraduate years.
Through World War 11. Stan
ford's School of Education con
centrated on advanced education,
offering no preparation for ele
mentary teachers. But with Ihe
war came "emergency" measures
to provide career opportunities in
this field for students already on
campus. The first program was

initiated, awarding the Bachelor
of Arts Degree in Education and
teaching credentials at the end of
ihe four years. The school was
encouraged to make the program
a permanent part of its curricu
lum, and did.
After a few years students he
came dissatisfied with the organi
zation of ihe system. Whiie it
provided ample instruction in ihe
pedagogical aspect of teaching, it
did not give enough opportunity
for elementary education majors
to tap the full resources of the
University. As an experiment, 40
sophomores agreed to stay five
years to help formulate a new
plan.
In some cases, new courses
vv'ere set up 1o provide the gen
eral background elementary edu
cation students seek; courses not
for teachers, Hanna is quick to
point out, but for generalists. A,t
present, in the undergraduate
years only 22 of the 182 units re
quired for this major are in the
field of education.
Another aspect of the new plan
is the expansion of the fifth year
graduate program to include
graduates from other liberal arts
colleges.

of the children they will teach.
Thus, education students will
complete the normal four years
of study with a wide variety of
courses, turning to the methodi
logioal, professional t e a c hi ng
courses only in their fifth year.
Dr. Paul R. Hanna, chairman of
Stanford's executive committee
on elementary school education,
explains, "Teachers must, not only
know youngsters, but they must
know enough about biological
•sciences, physical science, math,
the humanities, and the social
sciences to answer the wide range
of questions asked by young
sters."
Stanford, like most olher uni
versities. has previously offered
a four year program, including
specific education courses in the
last two undergraduate years.
Through World War 11. Stan
ford's School of Education con
centrated on advanced education,
offering no preparation for ele
mentary teachers. But with Ihe
war came "emergency" measures
to provide career opportunities in
this field for students already on
campus. The first program was

initiated, awarding the Bachelor
of Arts Degree in Education and
teaching credentials at the end of
ihe four years. The school was
encouraged to make the program
a permanent part of its curricu
lum, and did.
After a few years students he
came dissatisfied with the organi
zation of ihe system. Whiie it
provided ample instruction in ihe
pedagogical aspect of teaching, it
did not give enough opportunity
for elementary education majors
to tap the full resources of the
University. As an experiment, 40
sophomores agreed to stay five
years to help formulate a new
plan.
In some cases, new courses
vv'ere set up 1o provide the gen
eral background elementary edu
cation students seek; courses not
for teachers, Hanna is quick to
point out, but for generalists. A,t
present, in the undergraduate
years only 22 of the 182 units re
quired for this major are in the
field of education.
Another aspect of the new plan
is the expansion of the fifth year
graduate program to include
graduates from other liberal arts
colleges.
The Stanford School of Educa
tion is pioneering an elementary
education program which is de
signed to provide top-notch teach
ers for the increasing number of
positions in American elementary
schools. The basis is a fifth year
graduate plan which will offer
both the Master of Arts Degree
and the California Elementary
School Teaching Credential.
The new program, which is also
being initiated at Harvard, is
geared to the realization that
elementary school teachers need
a broad, general background to
effectively answer the questions
of the children they will teach.
Thus, education students will
complete the normal four years
of study with a wide variety of
courses, turning to the methodi
