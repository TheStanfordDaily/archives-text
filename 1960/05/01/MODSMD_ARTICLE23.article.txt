Oxy campus. Final totals were
82-48 for SC and (JS-.l -62 I for

and three all-time Indian bests
that weren't good enough were
bright spots for Stanford.
Cunliffe won the mile in 4:12.3
with teammate Norm Lloyd right
behind in 4:12.4. Ernie ran easily,
just going for the win and slowed
up on the final straightaway so
as to allow Lloyd to catch up and
assure the Tribe of both first and
second places.

1:47.8, the second fastest lime in
the world this year. The fastest

j is his mark of 1:47.3 set at Fresno, j

and SC's Warren Fallow was
third.

faltered in the stretch and Cer

slip by him.

the best shot put of his life . . .
and took third. Winters' mark of
.77-2 was behind Dallas Long's j
