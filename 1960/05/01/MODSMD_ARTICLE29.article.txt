# NETTERS PRESERVE STREAK
## Indians Edge Cal 
### John Schwarz 
Taxed much beyond their ex
pectations. the Stanford tennis
team squeaked by a greatly im
proved California net team and
I defeated the Bears ~»-1 at Stanford
on Saturday.
The Indians who haven't lost to
a Cal tennis team since 1956 were
forced to the wire by this year's
j sophomore studded Cal team and
only nipped the Bears when
George Bates and Dick Gould
edged Cal's Mike Farrell ;md Paul
| Welles in a tight second doubles
j encounter.
The two teams entered the dou
bles play with Stanford holding a
commanding 4-2 lead but an out*
| standing effort by Cal combined
I with some lackadaisical play on
i the part of the Indians tightened
i up the match to its extreme.
Bates and Gould, however, rose
| to the occasion and played one of
their better doubles matches of
jthe year. Both players were ex
tremely outstanding on service
! returns and at the net.
For Bates, one of the fastest
developing players in the coun
try. Saturday marked an excellent
; afternoon. The tall Stanford jun-
I ior raced through his singles en
counter with one time Cal first
! singler Arl Kono in less than an
! hour, knocking off his opponent
• 6-0, 6-4.
