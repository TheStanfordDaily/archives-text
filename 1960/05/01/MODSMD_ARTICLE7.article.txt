# Con Man Swindle Hits Fraternities
## 
### 
Two clover com men hit the row last week and walked away with $1,907 that belonged to members
of Stanford fraternities.
Jim Morris, a former employee of Columbus Stationery Co. who had lost his job but had kept his
credentials, took orders for Greek letter-head writing paper, and pocketed the money, with which he
bought a 1960 Chevy Impala convertible and disappeared.
Twenty fraternities were hit and loses up to $220 were reported. The Santa Clara Sheriff Department

has a warrant out for the arrest
of Morris and his accomplice, Wil
liam Clark, on charges of grand
theft.
Clark had stayed in the back
ground ol the swindle merely ad
vising Morris, and Stanford Police
Chief Gordon Davis says it may
be difficult to press charges
against him.
Fraternities at Cal and USC also
reported being swindled by the
men, and other universities have
been alerted by fraternity leaders
here.
Morris reportedly owes $100 to
another stationery company that
he worked for. When he was with
Columbus Stationery with whom
the Row deals each year, Morris
had taken valid orders for writing
paper, so he was no stranger to
the fraternities.
Morris bought the Impala in
Oakland, and deputies who are
working on the case reported he
then picked up a married woman
from North Dakota who is be
lieved to be travelling with him
now.
As soon as the swindle had been
discovered fraternity business
managers took steps to have their
checks cancelled, but it is not
known at this time if any of the
$1,907 the men took will be re
turned.
