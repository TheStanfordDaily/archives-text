## 'Morality, Conviction' Panel Topic 
### 
"Christian Morality and Per
sonal Conviction" will be the topic
of the second meeting in the So
cialist Caucus "Revolt of Con
science'' series tonight al 7:30 at
Ihe "1" Center, sponsored by the
Political Union.
The program, which will include
both panel discussion and audi
ence participation, will feature
speakers Howard Richards and
Michael Freeman of the law
school and Bob Richardon, a grad
uate st u dent of philosophy.
George Guy will moderate.
The discussions, which center
around the theme that personal
conviction suffers because a per
son is forced to accept the soci
ety's system of values and judg
ments, will examine religion's role
in this determination.
Guy said the basic discussion
would be posed around the ques
tion, "Does our value system re
flect the sincere teachings of
Christian morality and, wherein
the individual conviction is at va
riance with the social value sys
tem, what responsibility and what
actions could the individual un
dertake?"
