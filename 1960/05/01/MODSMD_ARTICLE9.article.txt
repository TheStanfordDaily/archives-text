### 
SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (A*)â€”
Calm and composed, Caryl Chess
man went to a small prison wait
ing cell yesterday, starting a sus
penseful all-night vigil next to
San Quentin's gas chamber. The
hour set for his ninth date with
death is 10 a.m., Pacific Daylight
Time today.
Only two hours before that,
seven California Supreme Court
justices will convene to give their
decision on the convicted sex kid
naper's latest petition for a stay.
The court has voted 4-3 three
times against clemency.
In Sacramento, Gov. Edmund
Brown yesterday turned down
plea after plea to save Caryl
Chessman from execution.
"I am, of course, powerless to
do anything in the ,Chessman
case,'' he told a news confercnce
at the Executive Mansion.
Opposed t<> Penalty
The governor reiterated his op
position to the death penalty. But
he said that if the State Supreme
Court refuses the final appeal in
behalf of Chessman, "that will
end it."
He will not grant a stay of
execution. Brown* said. There is
nothing now on which to base a
reprieve.
lie apparently referred to a
petition, signed by Chessman and
his three attorneys, which con

tended that evidence newly un
covered by an Argosy magazine
investigator pointed to Charles S.
Terrenova, a parole fugitive, as
the prime suspect in the red-light
bandit crimes.
Stars Protest
Three Hollywood stars and two
professors called on the governor
at the Executive Mansion with
an appeal to spare Chessman's
life.
The group inel u d e d Stevo
Allen, Marlon Brando, Shirley
MacLaine, and University of Cal
ifornia professors Eugene Bur
dick and Richard Drinnon. Drin
non is chairman of the East Bay
Committee for Abolishing Capi
tal Punishment.
Brown said they asked him to
grant a reprieve while a petition
is circulated for an initiative
measure to abolish capital pun
ishment.
He said such action on his part
would be an abuse of his power
and "a violation of my con
science."
