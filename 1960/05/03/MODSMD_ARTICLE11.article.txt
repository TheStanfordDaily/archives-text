### 
ISTANBUL, Turkey (/P)—Turk
ish students clashed twice with
troops yesterday in antigovern
ment demonstrations staged with
an eye on the Istanbul meeting of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organ
ization foreign ministers. A
group of lawyers joined the free

Turkish infantrymen, operating
under martial law. broke up the
outbursts againt Premier Adnan
Menderes' regime one by a group
of 3,000 within sight of the new
City Hall that is the NATO con
ference site. Scores were arrested.
Defy Threats
"Freedom! Freedom!" was the
marching cry of the demonstra
tors, who defied both orders
against public assemblies, and a
government threat that arms
would be used against any fur
ther disorders in the five-day-old
movement against Menderes.
The soldiers did not fire. How
ever, they used rifle butts, mus
cle power and threat of bayonets
to disperse the masses and nab
the more obstreperous demonstra
tors.
Students protesting Menderes'
rule and military forces met in a
broad plaza near City Hall in the
opening incident of the day.
Later, 500 students marched si
lently down the city's main busi
ness street, toward the site of a
monument to Turkey's war dead
in Taksim Square.
Troops Meet Students
They never reached the square.
A ring of troops met the students
and pushed them into side streets.
The lawyers' boost for the cam
paign suffered a similar setback.
About 100 attorneys took part in
this movement, which developed
while the students marched on
Taksim Square.
Turkish Foreign Minister Rustu
Zorlu told his fellow ministers in
the 15-nation alliance that the
disturbances wore the work of
only "small groups of youths
with selfish political aims." The
current troubles will not: weaken
Turkey's fundamental unity, he
said, and the entire nation whole
heartedly backs NATO.

would be used against any fur
ther disorders in the five-day-old
movement against Menderes.
The soldiers did not fire. How
ever, they used rifle butts, mus
cle power and threat of bayonets
to disperse the masses and nab
the more obstreperous demonstra
tors.
Students protesting Menderes'
rule and military forces met in a
broad plaza near City Hall in the
opening incident of the day.
Later, 500 students marched si
lently down the city's main busi
ness street, toward the site of a
monument to Turkey's war dead
in Taksim Square.
Troops Meet Students
They never reached the square.
A ring of troops met the students
and pushed them into side streets.
The lawyers' boost for the cam
paign suffered a similar setback.
About 100 attorneys took part in
this movement, which developed
while the students marched on
Taksim Square.
Turkish Foreign Minister Rustu
Zorlu told his fellow ministers in
the 15-nation alliance that the
disturbances wore the work of
only "small groups of youths
with selfish political aims." The
current troubles will not: weaken
Turkey's fundamental unity, he
said, and the entire nation whole
heartedly backs NATO.
