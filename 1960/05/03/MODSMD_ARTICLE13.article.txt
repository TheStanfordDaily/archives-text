# Stanford's New Union
## 
### 
Today's artiele about llie Tresidder I nion is the first of a
series taking an objective look al I lie proposed plans for this
addition lo the Stanford campus, based on slnd\ of the reports
drawn up h\ the Union director and his committee? and on con
sultation with several people working closel\ with the Union.
There is 110 donht that Stanford needs a student union, nor
is there anv question that it will have one in the near future.
I'reliminarN drawings will he prepared shortly, and the greater
percentage of funds is now available.
These funds have been obtained from four sources: donations
b\ the Tresidder faniilv and friends: the I residder Dollar which
is taken each quarter from every students fees and which was
\oled for this purpose l>\ tlie student body in 10 17: profits from
operation of the present Union: and returns from investment of
funds credited to llie new Union.
All mone\ from these sources has been earmarked for the
construction of Tresidder Union and ina\ not be used for an\
other purpose. Therefore, no monev is being taken from other
Universitv projects, and active solicitation of funds for the Union
is no longer occurring. Anv additional finances will he supplied
by government loans which will be paid back from profits of the
i iiion's operations.
The main consideration now must be given to the place of a
union at Stanford. 'There are several questions which should be
answered. Does the Union as proposed meet the needs of the
Stanford community, as far as funds allow? Arc there an\ lea
lures which are unnecessarv and which supplant more vital re
quirements? And does the I nion complement' the other aims of
I lie I niversilv ?
These questions must be answered in the formulalive stages
of llie plans. Once the Union is built, it will be 100 late to make
any improvements which might be foreseen al the present.
