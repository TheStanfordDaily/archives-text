Caryl Chessman is (lead, and the fantastic events of his last
day are representative of the absurdity of his entire ordeal.
Twelve years of mental anguish have been his, and then came
the frantic ending of his case. Yesterday he was executed bv the
people of (.alifornia.
However, there is no good to come from bewailing his fate.
Rather we should act now to bring California oul of the age of
savagen and into llie civilized world. Emotions had been stirred
u|> over the Chessman case, but we can hope that these will be
calmed by the voice of reason which calls for ihe abolition of
capital punishment.
Civilized countries the world over have abandoned the bar
baric custom of an eye for an eye and a life for a life. The recog
nized goal of our penal system is rehabilitation, not punishment.
It the latter were our goal, we failed iniserabK when the use of
torture was discontinued. Recognizing that it is most difficult to
rehabilitate the dead, we must realize the dichotomy between our
goals and our actions'.
The issue of capita] punishment will undoubtedly be on the
primary ballot iu June. Il will be up to the people of California
to decide whether they are advanced enough to abolish this svs
tein.
