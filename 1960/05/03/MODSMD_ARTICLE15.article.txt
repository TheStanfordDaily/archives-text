# ALL NIGHT VIGIL
## Crowd Near San Quentin Includes Brando, Burdick 
### Fran Manson 
The crowd assembled outside
the East Gate of San Quentin to
mark the final hours of Caryl
Chessman's life dwindled to a
handful toward morning.
Earlier in the day there had
been a soundtruck which periodi
cally recorded the protests of law
yers, housewives, artists, and
teenagers and of course the fea
ture attraction, movie star Marlon
Brando.
Brando and Eugene Burdick,
author of "The Ugly American,"
arrived as scheduled to speak to
ihc group about their interview
with Governor Brown; Dr. Bur
dick. however, declined to com
ment until the TV cameras ar
rived, an act which he admitted
was "cheap and meretritious" but
somehow necessary.
Though there is little doubt of
the sincerity of those who wont
to protest tiie capital punishment
penalty, the hot dog and candy
concessions were constantly pa
-1 ionized and, as one Berkeley
housewife put it, "We're having
a wonderful time."
On the other side of the prison,
at Tiburon Point, a small group
of Quakers maintained an all
night prayer vigil. Their protest
will be registered in this way on
each night preceding a California
state execution in the future.

Still a third group gathered in
front of the Governor's mansion
in Sacramento to pique the con
science of the Governor, who ap
-1 peared at his window often
throughout the day and evening
to observe the demonstrators. The
I people at the East Gate were at
1 several points throughout the eve
ning and asked to go to Sacra
mento to swell the ranks of that
demonstration, where it was felt
the protest could be most effec-
I live.
The problem of effectiveness is
a little complicated; certainly one
of the primary objectives of the
I three vigils was Chessman's re
prieve, and on that count the
demonstrators were defeated. But
the fact remains thai at least a
hundred people in this State felt
strongly enough about Ihc injus
tice of taking a man's life that
they wanted lo spend a miserable
njght in view of the place where
Chessman would die and the
| place where the decision to let
him live might have been made.
Though the hoopla attendent
j upon Brando's presence and the
i general air of festivity which
! sometimes prevailed at tho East
Gate demonstration perhaps be
-1 1 ittled the high seriousness of tho
cause, the effectiveness of the
stand laken by those who re
mained throughout tho night re

demonstration, where it was felt
the protest could be most effec-

The problem of effectiveness is
a little complicated; certainly one
of the primary objectives of the
I three vigils was Chessman's re
prieve, and on that count the
demonstrators were defeated. But
the fact remains thai at least a
hundred people in this State felt
strongly enough about Ihc injus
tice of taking a man's life that
they wanted lo spend a miserable
njght in view of the place where
Chessman would die and the

him live might have been made.

The crowd assembled outside
the East Gate of San Quentin to
mark the final hours of Caryl
Chessman's life dwindled to a
handful toward morning.
Earlier in the day there had
been a soundtruck which periodi
cally recorded the protests of law
yers, housewives, artists, and
teenagers and of course the fea
ture attraction, movie star Marlon
Brando.
Brando and Eugene Burdick,
author of "The Ugly American,"
arrived as scheduled to speak to
ihc group about their interview
with Governor Brown; Dr. Bur
dick. however, declined to com
ment until the TV cameras ar
rived, an act which he admitted
was "cheap and meretritious" but
somehow necessary.
Though there is little doubt of
the sincerity of those who wont
to protest tiie capital punishment
penalty, the hot dog and candy
concessions were constantly pa
-1 ionized and, as one Berkeley
housewife put it, "We're having
a wonderful time."
On the other side of the prison,
at Tiburon Point, a small group
of Quakers maintained an all
night prayer vigil. Their protest
will be registered in this way on
each night preceding a California
state execution in the future.

Still a third group gathered in
front of the Governor's mansion
in Sacramento to pique the con
science of the Governor, who ap
-1 peared at his window often
throughout the day and evening
to observe the demonstrators. The
