# PROPOSED
## Tresidder Union Integral Part of Stanford Education 
### Mike Gordon Dan White 
Editor's Note: This is the first
of a series of four articles oil
the proposed Tresidder Union to
hi' hiiilt at Stanford.

Last November, the Stanford
Board of Trustees finally ap
proved proposals for the building
of the long-awaited Tresidder
Union. The appointed committees,
boards and staffs responsible for
the construction and direction of I
the union were to "present a so-1
cial, cultural, recreational, and I
intellectual pr o g r a m for the
whole campus," the Trustees said.
Previously the appointed fac
ulty chairman of ihe Stanford;
Union Committee, Professor John
Merryman, after a detailed sur-j
vey of various candidates, had
selected Dr. Chester Berry to be
come the director of the planned
Tresidder Union. Berry, then di
rector of the University of Rhode j
Island College Union and a well
known authority in his field, was
at first reluctant to accept the
position, doubting Stanford's need
for such a proposed union.
Man For Job
Convinced, however, that Berry
was the man for the job, Merry-1
man persuaded him to come-to
Stanford on a short visit to oh- 5
serve campus life here and deter
mine for himself the need of a
new union.
For one week, Berry lived at 1
Stern Hall, talking with numer-j
ous students, viewing the aca-f
demic and social life, attending
various functions like the Tues
day Evening Series. At the end
of this period, Berry, now con
vinced that Stanford could bene
fit from a new well-planned, well
buill community center, accepted
the position of director.
Since last September, Berry
has been preparing reports for
the Board of Trustees on con
struction plans and on the pro
gram Tresidder will offer when
completed. In tfie preparation of
these r e p or t s, three of which
have been completed, he has been j
working with Merryman's com
mittee and with a student Ad i
Hoc committee, as well as talk- j
ing with students in over 40 liv
ing groups.
From these studies and discus
sions, the director and the com
mittees have decided that Tre-1
sidder shall be a functional place
"where friends are made and 1
ideas challenged, where both
bowling shoes and art prints are
rented, where hamburgers and 1
good books are consumed, where j
jazz combos and string quartets
are both welcome."
Intellectual Purposes
In other words, the new union
will be an attempt, Berry says,
to combine both social and intel- 1
lectual purposes in serving the
Stanford academic community,
eventually becoming a central
integrated part of the informal ;
educational program at Stanford. !
The major report envisioned!
physical facilities that include the
following: a large grillroom cap
able of serving at least 500 per-'
sons and flexible enough to be
used for group social functions;
a dining room for 150 persons; (
a banquet-ballroom large enough
for 600 dancing couples; quiet '
areas, including lounges; four I
conference rooms, each seating!
at leasl 16 persons; meeting!
rooms, capable of seating up to j
100 persons each; art display
cases and an art rental service;
music listening rooms, four small 1
ones with four seats each and a |
large one with 25; and a brows

ing room handling magazines and
newspapers.
The plans also provided: a
games lounge with at least 12
bridge tables and equipment for
other table-games like scrabble
' and chess; a games area, includ
ing space for 10 billiard tallies,
10 ping-pong tables and 11 bowl
ing lanes with spectator room
for 150 persons; a barber shop,
rest rooms, offices for student
government and numerous other
services.
Since making that report, Ber
ry and his committees have elimi
nated some of the services and
one major recreational facility
the banquet-ballroom. The reason
for the significant omission was
that a more careful study of stu
i dent preferences has now con
vinced thorn that due to liquor
laws and to the lack of interest
in large on-campus dances, such
a facility would meet with little
| enthusiasm. •
Rapid Progress
Although the commitees and ihe
director have made rapid prog
ress in completing plans, they
have during the last few months
been encountering opposition
j from various faculty and admin
istration members and student
factions.
Part of the student opposition
! is a result of a misunderstanding
on the source of funds for the
I union. The students' misunder
standing was partly a result of
i Ihe fact that they believed the
Kmoney might he better allocated
for academic or residential use.
Nevertheless, the Tresidder
family, who originally established
the fund, and the donors, who
have since contributed to it, have
specifically stated lhat the money
must he utilized for purposes of
the uni on on 1 y -not for any
: other.
Then to what is the rest of Ihe
! opposition due?

known authority in his field, was
at first reluctant to accept the
position, doubting Stanford's need
for such a proposed union.
Man For Job
Convinced, however, that Berry
was the man for the job, Merry-1
man persuaded him to come-to
Stanford on a short visit to oh- 5
serve campus life here and deter
mine for himself the need of a
new union.
For one week, Berry lived at 1
Stern Hall, talking with numer-j
ous students, viewing the aca-f
demic and social life, attending
various functions like the Tues
day Evening Series. At the end
of this period, Berry, now con
vinced that Stanford could bene
fit from a new well-planned, well
buill community center, accepted
the position of director.
Since last September, Berry
has been preparing reports for
the Board of Trustees on con
struction plans and on the pro
gram Tresidder will offer when
completed. In tfie preparation of
these r e p or t s, three of which
have been completed, he has been j
working with Merryman's com
mittee and with a student Ad i
Hoc committee, as well as talk- j
ing with students in over 40 liv
ing groups.
From these studies and discus
sions, the director and the com
mittees have decided that Tre-1
sidder shall be a functional place
"where friends are made and 1
ideas challenged, where both
bowling shoes and art prints are
rented, where hamburgers and 1
good books are consumed, where j
jazz combos and string quartets
are both welcome."
Intellectual Purposes
In other words, the new union
will be an attempt, Berry says,
to combine both social and intel- 1
lectual purposes in serving the
Stanford academic community,
eventually becoming a central
integrated part of the informal ;
educational program at Stanford. !
The major report envisioned!
physical facilities that include the
following: a large grillroom cap
able of serving at least 500 per-'
sons and flexible enough to be
used for group social functions;
a dining room for 150 persons; (
a banquet-ballroom large enough
for 600 dancing couples; quiet '
areas, including lounges; four I
conference rooms, each seating!
at leasl 16 persons; meeting!
rooms, capable of seating up to j
100 persons each; art display
cases and an art rental service;
music listening rooms, four small 1
ones with four seats each and a |
large one with 25; and a brows

ing room handling magazines and
newspapers.
The plans also provided: a
games lounge with at least 12
bridge tables and equipment for
other table-games like scrabble
' and chess; a games area, includ
ing space for 10 billiard tallies,
10 ping-pong tables and 11 bowl
ing lanes with spectator room
for 150 persons; a barber shop,
rest rooms, offices for student
government and numerous other
services.
Since making that report, Ber
ry and his committees have elimi
nated some of the services and
one major recreational facility
the banquet-ballroom. The reason
for the significant omission was
that a more careful study of stu
i dent preferences has now con
vinced thorn that due to liquor
laws and to the lack of interest
in large on-campus dances, such
a facility would meet with little
| enthusiasm. •
Rapid Progress
Although the commitees and ihe
director have made rapid prog
ress in completing plans, they
have during the last few months
been encountering opposition
j from various faculty and admin
istration members and student
factions.
Part of the student opposition
! is a result of a misunderstanding
on the source of funds for the
I union. The students' misunder
standing was partly a result of
i Ihe fact that they believed the
Kmoney might he better allocated
for academic or residential use.
Nevertheless, the Tresidder
family, who originally established
the fund, and the donors, who
have since contributed to it, have
specifically stated lhat the money
must he utilized for purposes of
the uni on on 1 y -not for any
: other.

gram Tresidder will offer when
completed. In tfie preparation of
these r e p or t s, three of which
have been completed, he has been j
working with Merryman's com
mittee and with a student Ad i
Hoc committee, as well as talk- j
ing with students in over 40 liv
ing groups.
From these studies and discus
sions, the director and the com
mittees have decided that Tre-1
sidder shall be a functional place
"where friends are made and 1
ideas challenged, where both
bowling shoes and art prints are
rented, where hamburgers and 1
good books are consumed, where j
jazz combos and string quartets
are both welcome."
Intellectual Purposes
In other words, the new union
will be an attempt, Berry says,
to combine both social and intel- 1
lectual purposes in serving the
Stanford academic community,
eventually becoming a central
integrated part of the informal ;
educational program at Stanford. !
The major report envisioned!
physical facilities that include the
following: a large grillroom cap
able of serving at least 500 per-'
sons and flexible enough to be
used for group social functions;
a dining room for 150 persons; (
a banquet-ballroom large enough
for 600 dancing couples; quiet '
areas, including lounges; four I
conference rooms, each seating!
at leasl 16 persons; meeting!
rooms, capable of seating up to j
100 persons each; art display
cases and an art rental service;
music listening rooms, four small 1
ones with four seats each and a |
large one with 25; and a brows

ing room handling magazines and
newspapers.
The plans also provided: a
games lounge with at least 12
bridge tables and equipment for
other table-games like scrabble
' and chess; a games area, includ
ing space for 10 billiard tallies,
10 ping-pong tables and 11 bowl
ing lanes with spectator room
for 150 persons; a barber shop,
rest rooms, offices for student
government and numerous other
services.
Since making that report, Ber
ry and his committees have elimi
nated some of the services and
one major recreational facility
the banquet-ballroom. The reason
for the significant omission was
that a more careful study of stu
i dent preferences has now con
vinced thorn that due to liquor
laws and to the lack of interest
in large on-campus dances, such
a facility would meet with little
| enthusiasm. •
Rapid Progress
Although the commitees and ihe
director have made rapid prog
ress in completing plans, they
have during the last few months
been encountering opposition
j from various faculty and admin
istration members and student
factions.
Part of the student opposition
! is a result of a misunderstanding
on the source of funds for the
I union. The students' misunder
standing was partly a result of
i Ihe fact that they believed the
Kmoney might he better allocated
for academic or residential use.
Nevertheless, the Tresidder
family, who originally established
the fund, and the donors, who
have since contributed to it, have
specifically stated lhat the money
must he utilized for purposes of
the uni on on 1 y -not for any
: other.
Then to what is the rest of Ihe
! opposition due?
Editor's Note: This is the first
of a series of four articles oil
the proposed Tresidder Union to
hi' hiiilt at Stanford.

Last November, the Stanford
Board of Trustees finally ap
proved proposals for the building
of the long-awaited Tresidder
Union. The appointed committees,
boards and staffs responsible for
the construction and direction of I
the union were to "present a so-1
cial, cultural, recreational, and I
intellectual pr o g r a m for the
whole campus," the Trustees said.
Previously the appointed fac
ulty chairman of ihe Stanford;
Union Committee, Professor John
Merryman, after a detailed sur-j
vey of various candidates, had
selected Dr. Chester Berry to be
come the director of the planned
Tresidder Union. Berry, then di
rector of the University of Rhode j
Island College Union and a well
known authority in his field, was
at first reluctant to accept the
position, doubting Stanford's need
for such a proposed union.
Man For Job
Convinced, however, that Berry
was the man for the job, Merry-1
man persuaded him to come-to
Stanford on a short visit to oh- 5
serve campus life here and deter
mine for himself the need of a
new union.
For one week, Berry lived at 1
Stern Hall, talking with numer-j
ous students, viewing the aca-f
demic and social life, attending
various functions like the Tues
day Evening Series. At the end
of this period, Berry, now con
vinced that Stanford could bene
fit from a new well-planned, well
buill community center, accepted
the position of director.
Since last September, Berry
has been preparing reports for
the Board of Trustees on con
struction plans and on the pro
gram Tresidder will offer when
completed. In tfie preparation of
these r e p or t s, three of which
