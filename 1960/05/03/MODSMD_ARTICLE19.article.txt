# 'Babes' Production 'Full of Enthusiasm'
## 
### Mary Lou Mckinley Managing Editor 
"Babes in Arms," currently
playing Friday and Saturday
nights at the Loft Theater in!
Palo Alto, is a lively spoof on
the theater in general and sum
, mer stock in particular.
With music and lyrics by Rich
ard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart,
the musical show contains such
well-known songs as "1 Wish 1
Were in Love Again," "Where or
When," "My Funny Valentine,"
and "Lady is a Tramp."
While lacking the professional
quality which stronger leads have
provided in past Comedia pro
ductions, the performance was
entertaining and full of enthus
iasm.
Good Chorus Work
Although none of the voices
were outstanding the songs were
pleasingly done, with the en
semble numbers standing out
above the solos and duets.
Comedia's chorus numbers are
always delightful, highlighted by
i snappy dances which take advan
tage of, rather than being limited
by, the small stage area. And the ,
ones in this production, choreo
graphed by Rose Ann Sayler, 1
were no exception.
The young leads, Jerry Grant j
as Valentine White and Carol-
Jean Thompson as Susie Ward, j
both had pleasing voices although
their performances lacked an
assuredness which would have
made the roles more outstanding.

Corinne Kason and Steve Hud
ner were delightful as a comedy
team. Both showed a sparkle and
s sense of timing which stood out
I over their vocal performances.
Playing Bunny, the co-owner
{of the Surf and Sand Playhouse,
' Barbara Slemmons demonstrated
her talent for comedy which came
to the fore especially in the "Lady
Is A Tramp" number.
| I wish that the characters of
j Seymour Flemming, the stingy j
| producer, and Lee Calhoun, the
not-too -successful playwright,
| had been more prominent in the
play, as Mark Hammer and Tim
; Welch gave excellent perform-
I ances in these roles.
For a while there was some i

good satire with these two char
acters, but the script was defi
nitely more of a vehicle for songs
and musical numbers than for
plot or characterizations.
Jacque Wood gave a polished
performance as the actress Jenni
fer Owen, and Lee Steele was
excellent as her stagedoor mother.
One of the most commendable
jobs was done by Linda Loveless
on the piano, the show's "orches
tra."

Good Chorus Work
Although none of the voices
were outstanding the songs were
pleasingly done, with the en
semble numbers standing out
above the solos and duets.
Comedia's chorus numbers are
always delightful, highlighted by
i snappy dances which take advan
tage of, rather than being limited
by, the small stage area. And the ,
ones in this production, choreo
graphed by Rose Ann Sayler, 1
were no exception.
The young leads, Jerry Grant j
as Valentine White and Carol-
Jean Thompson as Susie Ward, j
both had pleasing voices although
their performances lacked an
assuredness which would have
made the roles more outstanding.
Good Comics
Corinne Kason and Steve Hud
ner were delightful as a comedy
team. Both showed a sparkle and
s sense of timing which stood out
I over their vocal performances.
Playing Bunny, the co-owner
{of the Surf and Sand Playhouse,
' Barbara Slemmons demonstrated
her talent for comedy which came
to the fore especially in the "Lady
Is A Tramp" number.
| I wish that the characters of
j Seymour Flemming, the stingy j
| producer, and Lee Calhoun, the
not-too -successful playwright,
| had been more prominent in the
play, as Mark Hammer and Tim
; Welch gave excellent perform-
I ances in these roles.
For a while there was some i

good satire with these two char
acters, but the script was defi
nitely more of a vehicle for songs
and musical numbers than for
plot or characterizations.
Jacque Wood gave a polished
performance as the actress Jenni
fer Owen, and Lee Steele was
excellent as her stagedoor mother.
One of the most commendable
jobs was done by Linda Loveless
on the piano, the show's "orches
tra."
"Babes in Arms," currently
playing Friday and Saturday
nights at the Loft Theater in!
Palo Alto, is a lively spoof on
the theater in general and sum
, mer stock in particular.
With music and lyrics by Rich
ard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart,
the musical show contains such
well-known songs as "1 Wish 1
Were in Love Again," "Where or
When," "My Funny Valentine,"
and "Lady is a Tramp."
While lacking the professional
quality which stronger leads have
provided in past Comedia pro
ductions, the performance was
entertaining and full of enthus
iasm.
