Name's I lie Same
H sooins that all you have to do 1o find out whether anyone is
reading your column is to misplace or misspell a couple of first and
last names of athletes. Immediately letters from all sorts of impor
tant-sounding people will come in and point out your mistakes. Apol
ogies from myself and the printer for the miscues go out to Gary
Kerkorian who I know is no Irish Corcoran and Paul Wiggin.
So with my proverbial tongue in cheek, I hesitatingly start out
another column filled with names of former Stanford athletes with,
1 hope this time, the right spellings for all.
This Saturday will be a great time to go out and see a ball game.
At the Sunken Diamond at 10 a.m. the C'al Alumni will play the Stan
ford Alumni in What may prove to be the 1 most unique of the tradi
tional clashes ever.
Kx-Coacli Harry Holler will manage the Card Alumni and will
have quite a star-studded lineup to choose from. The first two innings
will pit teams composed of ex-ballplayers from the classes of 1945

and earlier. Such greats as Herb
Boull, Sid Lewis, Jim Coffis,
Monte and Frank ITyl, and senior
veterans Blaine Stevens, of the
Class of '!!), and Pete McCloskey,
'15, will be on the diamond for
their old school with some anti
quated caps that have been dug
up from somebody's past long
ago.
Innings three and four will pit
former Indians Karl Bolis, Ben
< ardinalil, Wayne Friekson, Ted
Nell, George Sloat and others
against the Bears.
The big battle should come in
the sth, 6th and 7th frames as
members from the '52 and '53
Stanford powerhouses are sched
uled to go. Leading that group
will be shortstop Warren Good
rich who is Alumni "general
manager" for the game; A 1 Tal
boy, in the outfield; Jack Shep
herd, who caught ; Rich Seramag
lia, at second base; and Boh .Mur
phy, a pitcher. The '53 squad
copped the Pacific Coast Confer-

ence 1 i tby beating Oregon, the Northern finalist, and went back
East to the NCAA Playolts. Due to a delayed flight and thus loss of
sleep before the game, the boys lost their first game and a chance
for the title.
However, this ball club was one that the old-timers are still talking
about. Such stars as Goodrich and Shepherd who both were chosen
on the All-American f\rst team that year. Murphy, Talboy and of
course Chuck Essegian were good enough to make any all-Stanford
team. Goodrich led the team and league with stolen bases that year
with 23 and batted a respectable .341 average. Shepherd who later
ended up catching for the Pirates led the team hitting with a sea
sonal .399 average. Essegian who si ill wins ball games with home
runs for the Los Angeles Dodgers hit .329 and live big homeruns
out of the Sunken Diamond. Murphy was the big man on the hill for
the Indians Ihat season as he combined a 11-2 record and a 1.89 E.R.A.
plus laying out part of the year with pleurisy.
Later-day Stars Ready
The last two innings will see the later-day heroes go against the
Bears as members of the classes of 1956 and on include such more
familiar names as: Boh Dwight, an infielder; George Avery, a pitcher;
and many others should be ready to go.
Goodrich sent out invitations to 475 former Stanford diamondeers
and many men have answered such as Leo Haggerty and .Mickey Holz
man. Holzman will suit up again for the alumni and his freshman
charges will get a chance to see just how good their coach is this
Saturday morning.
Yes, definitely a good bet this weekend will be the free Alumni
game between the former Card greats and the California Bear team
of Jackie Jensen, Sam Chapman and many more. Hope to see you
there.

H sooins that all you have to do 1o find out whether anyone is
reading your column is to misplace or misspell a couple of first and
last names of athletes. Immediately letters from all sorts of impor
tant-sounding people will come in and point out your mistakes. Apol
ogies from myself and the printer for the miscues go out to Gary
Kerkorian who I know is no Irish Corcoran and Paul Wiggin.
So with my proverbial tongue in cheek, I hesitatingly start out
another column filled with names of former Stanford athletes with,
1 hope this time, the right spellings for all.
This Saturday will be a great time to go out and see a ball game.
At the Sunken Diamond at 10 a.m. the C'al Alumni will play the Stan
ford Alumni in What may prove to be the 1 most unique of the tradi
tional clashes ever.
Kx-Coacli Harry Holler will manage the Card Alumni and will
have quite a star-studded lineup to choose from. The first two innings
will pit teams composed of ex-ballplayers from the classes of 1945

and earlier. Such greats as Herb
Boull, Sid Lewis, Jim Coffis,
Monte and Frank ITyl, and senior
veterans Blaine Stevens, of the
Class of '!!), and Pete McCloskey,
'15, will be on the diamond for
their old school with some anti
quated caps that have been dug
up from somebody's past long
ago.
Innings three and four will pit
former Indians Karl Bolis, Ben
< ardinalil, Wayne Friekson, Ted
Nell, George Sloat and others
against the Bears.
The big battle should come in
the sth, 6th and 7th frames as
members from the '52 and '53
Stanford powerhouses are sched
uled to go. Leading that group
will be shortstop Warren Good
rich who is Alumni "general
manager" for the game; A 1 Tal
boy, in the outfield; Jack Shep
herd, who caught ; Rich Seramag
lia, at second base; and Boh .Mur
phy, a pitcher. The '53 squad
copped the Pacific Coast Confer-

ence 1 i tby beating Oregon, the Northern finalist, and went back
East to the NCAA Playolts. Due to a delayed flight and thus loss of
sleep before the game, the boys lost their first game and a chance
for the title.
However, this ball club was one that the old-timers are still talking
about. Such stars as Goodrich and Shepherd who both were chosen
on the All-American f\rst team that year. Murphy, Talboy and of
course Chuck Essegian were good enough to make any all-Stanford
team. Goodrich led the team and league with stolen bases that year
with 23 and batted a respectable .341 average. Shepherd who later
ended up catching for the Pirates led the team hitting with a sea
sonal .399 average. Essegian who si ill wins ball games with home
runs for the Los Angeles Dodgers hit .329 and live big homeruns
out of the Sunken Diamond. Murphy was the big man on the hill for
the Indians Ihat season as he combined a 11-2 record and a 1.89 E.R.A.
plus laying out part of the year with pleurisy.
Later-day Stars Ready
The last two innings will see the later-day heroes go against the
Bears as members of the classes of 1956 and on include such more
familiar names as: Boh Dwight, an infielder; George Avery, a pitcher;
and many others should be ready to go.
Goodrich sent out invitations to 475 former Stanford diamondeers
and many men have answered such as Leo Haggerty and .Mickey Holz
man. Holzman will suit up again for the alumni and his freshman
charges will get a chance to see just how good their coach is this
Saturday morning.
Yes, definitely a good bet this weekend will be the free Alumni
game between the former Card greats and the California Bear team
of Jackie Jensen, Sam Chapman and many more. Hope to see you
there.

of Jackie Jensen, Sam Chapman and many more. Hope to see you
there.
