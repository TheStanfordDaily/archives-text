en Diamond this afternoon at 3:15

the big weekend series with Cal.
The Indians, playing them as
they come, will open with the

same lineup that has been click
ing so well of late. Junior Earl

Mecklenberg Gets Call
Lefty Marv Mecklenberg, work
horse of the Stanford staff, will
be called on to go a few innings.
Mecklenberg is 5-6 for the year.
Jay Winter seems to have re
covered c o m p 1 e t e 1 y from a
pinched nerve in his arm and will
start his third straight game be
hind the plate. Coach Dutch Feh
ring feels that with Winter catch
ing and Magee at second the Card
defense is stronger.
Winter and Magee are rated
even as receivers by their coach,
but Winter has a stronger arm.

At the same time Fehring feels
that Magee is the team's best sec
ond baseman and is most effec
tive on the double play.
The Cards will be close to full
strength for the coming weekend.
Terry Lindeman, who boasts a
spotless 1-0 mark, threw Sunday
for tho first time since the UCLA
series. The junior mirier has been

suffering from an infected toe.
Only Stanford casualty is catcher
Bob Overman who is out for the
season with a dislocated thumb.
Hal Schutzmann, who hobbled
through the weekend series with
a charley horse, is now going at

will consist of Skip Lawrence in
center and John Hurlbut in left.
Lawrence is the club's leading
hitter with a .358 average. Hurl
but, though his average has dip

with his big bat. He leads the
club in doubles with four and tri
ples with five.
Burk on Rampage
In the infield Stanford will start
Lee Moench at first, Magee at
second. Mike Filice at short, and
Jim Burk at third. Burk, team

rampage of late and has raised

leads the team in RBl's with 21
and slugging percentage, .522.
San Francisco cannot be taken
lightly, for the Gators hold vic
tories over' Santa Clara, San Jose
State and University of San Fran
cisco. Two of those teams, Santa
Clara and San Jose, have beaten
the Indians.
The fast-approaching weekend
