# Freshman Tennis Squad Drops Crippled San Jose
## 
### 
Badly crippled by the loss of
their number one player, the San
Jose State 112 r e s h m a n jietters
proved to be no match for the
powerful Stanford frosh squad as
ihe Spartababes found themselves
at the short end of a lopsided S-l
count yesterday on the Tribe
courts.
San Jose's top man. Don Kliss,
who barely lost to frosh star Bill
Hurley last February, unexplain
ably dropped from school a short
while ago and in the process
cramped the Spartababes' plans.
In the most interesting match
of the day, Stanford's Munn Chin
struggled through three grueling
sets before suffering his first set
back of the season, losing to San
Jose's Stillson Judah, 4-6. 6-4, 6-1.
Surprisingly enough, the Pa
pooses won all three doubles
matches, as coach Bob Renker's
second liners came through with

three big wins. One of the deci
sions came by default, but the
learn of Ralph Mcllveeny and Wes
Petit were in the proces of win
ning when San Jose called it
quits.
In other action, the frosh's Bur
ley continued his winning ways
as he turned back Gordy Stroud
i of San Jose. 8-(>, 6-3.
