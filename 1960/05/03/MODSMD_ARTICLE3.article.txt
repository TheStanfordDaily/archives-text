# Series Speech To Consider Martian Life

### 
Is there life on other planets?
Stanford Medical School biologist
Dr. Johua Lederberg thinks this
i-s a possibility and is studying
microscopes and other devices
which might be placed on Mars
to find out.
Dr. Lederberg, a Nobel Prize
co-winner for his genetic studies,
will discuss "exobiology," his own
term for extra-terrestrial life, at
tonight's Tuesday Evening Series.
His talk, "Biology of I lie Planets,"
begins at 7:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Dr. Lederberg presented his
views of "exobiology" in a paper
delivered to the first annual
Space Science Symposium in Nice,
France, last January.
He noted thai earth plants, ani
mals and bacteria share a remark
able list of biochemical elements
hidden in the nucleic acids. This
led him to speculate whether ex
tra-lerrestrial life, if it exists, also
depends on Ihe nucleic acids and
the proteins.
An answer to I his question, Dr.
Lederberg stated, could come
from ultra-violet microscopes
planted on Mars in an area which
appears unusually rich in organic
material. Pictures from a revolv
ing strip of iranparent tape
which would carry samples past
the microscope's aperture could
be televised to earth for scientific
scrutiny. II is also possible, he
believes, that we may transfer
bacterial life from the earth to
other planets when we finally
achieve space flight.
Dr. Lederberg is a member of
the Space Science Board of the
National Academy of Sciences. He
shared the 1958 Nobel Prize with
Professors George Beadle of Cal
tech and Edward L. Tatum of the
Rockefeller Institute. Both are
former Stanford faculty members.
