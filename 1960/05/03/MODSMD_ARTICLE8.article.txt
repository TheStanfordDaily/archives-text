# DR. LINDEN'S FIRST TALK
## Male Leadership Needed In Discipline of Children 
### Doug Willis 
Parents will make fewer mis
takes acting instinctively than
i they will if they are paralyzed in
! fear of making a mistake, Dr.
Maurice Linden, Director of the
Division of Mental Health of the
city of Philadelphia, Penn., told
a Stanford audience yesterday.
Linden said that he had faith in
! parents who loved their children.
"We assume that love carries its
own discipline, and we know that
children interpret discipline as
' love."
Linden said that people in the
professions of mental health may
i be responsible for taking away
the position of parents. He said
j that he didn't want to give ad
vice on raising children "because
a simple answer doesn't tell the
whole story."
He said thai the inversion of
; roles by parents is a cause of in
consistent discipline patterns and
j that these lead to "porous" char
! acter development.
"We need a restoration of male
leadership," Linden said. He said
I that a revival of male leadership

does nut mean an eclipse of
women, but rather a straighten
ing out of mixed sexual identifi
cation.
Linden explained that since the
industrial revolution, when wom
en were placed on an equal basis
with men, that the male has let
his masculine, aggressive traits
recede behind feminine passivity.
"Women are unconsciously frus
trated by men who are not strong
and masculine," he said.
Linden said that many juvenile
delinquents finish their early
years without a strong male im
age and that they are struggling
to express masculinity.
He cited studies of Negro de
linquency in Philadelphia and
noted that the Negro mother
gives her children a good start.
"She is warm and gives them
optimism, but in the third year
or so the father enters and is de
based or is physically or spiritu
ally absent."
Linden's talk was the first in a
series of lectures on sex psychol
ogy. Today's lecture is on "Fate
of the Instincts," and tomorrow's
will lie on "Climax and Anti-Cli
max." Dr. Linden will conduct
both lectures.
