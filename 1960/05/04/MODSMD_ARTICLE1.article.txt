FT. BENNING, Ga. i/P) â€”
President Eisenhower yesterday
inspected the Army's awesome
arsenal of nuclear weapons. Then
lie declared that anyone who says
America has "gone soft" and can't
defend itself is mistaken.
His remarks in an informal
talk at this huge infantry train
ing center were a tribute to the
nation's foot soldiers and new
developments of the atomic age
weapons which support them.
New Weapon
Among the weapons the Presi
dent saw was the spectacular new
Davey Crockett short-range and
portable atomic gun.
Secretary of the Army Wilber
M. Brucker said of that weapon,
which can be fired by two men:
"Davey Crockett dwarfs in fire
power a ny th in g we had ever
known in the immediate area of
the battle line."
The Army added that civilian
populations would not be endan
gered by its blast and that danger
from radioactive fallout would be
minimized.
In a spectacular firepower dem
onstration of various new weap
ons, the Army used no nuclear
warheads, of course. But it did
use live conventional ammunition.
Eisenhower watched intently
through binoculars as time after
time targets on the range were
hit with pinpoint accuracy.
Missiles Fired
The demonstration included the
shooting of rockets from hover
ing helicopters and the launching
of Honest John and Little John
missiles with conventional war
heads. The newest of Army tanks
also took part in the display.
Declaring he wanted to salute
the entire Bcnning team. Eisen
hower said: "A day like this
makes a man quite ready to call
all those people mistaken, if not
worse, who say that America has
become soft and is not capable of
defending itself."
