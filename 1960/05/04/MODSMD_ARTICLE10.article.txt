## Lederberg Defines New Space Goal 
### Jerry Isenberg 
At a press conference held yes
terday at the Stanford Medical
Center, Dr. Joshua Lederberg,
head of the Department of Gene
tics, and a Nobel prize winner,
reviewed the course he believes
should be taken to investigate
life in other parts of the solar
system.
Dr. Lederberg's paper "Exobi
, ology Experimental Approaches
to Life Beyond the Earth" was
first read before the First Inter
national Space Symposium at
Nice, France, in January. The
paper deals specifically with the
; biological aspects of space re
| search and with a device which,
I it is hoped, will enable unmanned
space vehicles to record and trans
mit evidence of living organisms
| on other planets to scientists on
I earth.
Reason for Program
"The reason for developing
such a program," Dr. Lederberg
.said, "is that the manner in which
biological creatures are found to
: exist on other planets will have
fundamental significance for life
ion earth. Our biological experi
ence is limited in the field of
biology which the physicists and
chemists can make.
"We know, for instance, that
the same atoms occur in interstel
lar space that occur on earth. We
do not know that the same fun
damental life processes occur else
where in the universe, 1 hough
! t here has never been strong skep
ticism about the existence of bi
| ological occurrences on other
planets.
"The significance of investigat
i ing life on other planets, as far
as we are concerned, is that it will
shed light on the origin of life
j on our own planet."
Principal Consideration
One of the principal considera
tions in investigating another
planet is the consequence of eon
' taminating that planet with bac
teria from earth, thus possibly
invalidating the results of biologi
cal experiments. The situation is
I comparatively easy to alleviate,
; Dr. Lederberg said, by gaseous
'sterilization of the interplanetary
; payload before launch.
The heart of the experimental
' program is a microscope, to be
| delivered as part of an interplan
etary payload, which collects
j samples of dust and surface soil
j in the immediate vicinity of the
, landing area and then examines
| them.
The microscope is still in the
development stage, and Dr. Led
erberg has made only tentative
; suggestions regarding its use. He
said it would be three to six years
before a vehicle capable of reach
ing interplanetary targets could
1 possibly be developed, and that
use of his device must of course
! wait on such a vehicle.
