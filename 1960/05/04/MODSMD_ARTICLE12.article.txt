# Proposed Stanford Union; The Area of Controversy
## 
### Mike Gordon Don White 
In a combined meeting with the
General Studies and Faculty-resi
dences committee, held recently,
Professor John Merryman, ehari
man of the Union Committee, and
Director Chester Berry found thai
certain members of these com
mittees either opposed their plans
for Tresidder or challenged the
goals such a union would achieve.
Dr. Wil Stone, a faculty-resident
from Stern Hall and leading ad
vocate of the proposed house
system for Stanford, pointed out
to Merryman and Berry that a
large centralized union, which
rets upon a basic premise of be
coming a center of student life,
both socially and intellectually,
could possibly conflict with the
future house-system.
The purpose of the house-sys
tem would be decentralization,
providing a form of residential
living that would permit indi
vidual students to find a combined
recreational and intellectual life
in small groups with faculty resi
dents, masters and tutors.
Fvident Cleavage
Its goal would be to reduce the
ail-too evident cleavage here at
Stanford between academic and
social life. If anyone should think,
Stone argues, that the proposed
house-system is Utopian and in
capable of either being realized or
functioning well here, he would
be wrong; the proposal is already
before tlie Board of Trustees and
from all indications should be
passed.
In separate interviews both
Dean Philip Rhinclander and Dr.
William McCord have confirmed
what Stone has said- that the pos
sibilities for a house-system here
are good, if not excellent. They,
too, stated that with adequate pre
cautions on both sides, no conflict
between the union and house-sys
tem need be inevitable.
The problem here is that the
supporters of the Tresidder Union
program, namely Berry and Mer
ryman. maintain that one of its
ultimate goals is also to help re
duce the cleavage between aca
demic and social life. Yet although
both sides agree as to the ends to
be achieved and insist no conflict
is necessary, each feels that its
own proposals may furnish a
more suitable < in the practical and
applicable sense) means for
achievement of these goals.
Intelligent Cooperation
Thus it appears that unless in
telligent cooperation is shown be
tween the two groups, conflict,
whether desired or not, whether
unnecessary or not. may be in
evitable. Both programs, the
house-system and the union, can,
in fact, be complementary. Even
when decentralized house govern
ment replaces centralized associ
ated studefit government, for ex
ample, there will still be functions
and problems that are all-campus
in nature and transcend individual
house capabilities. Where belter
could an all-campus house execu
tive system or all-campus student
organizations find suitable facili
ties than in the proposed ASSU
offices in the union?
A college union in this case
would be analogous, Merryman
argues, to a community of fami
lies which has family living in its
own home, but that has as well a
community center which families
can use and enjoy together.
But intelligent cooperation will,
it appears, require that the pro
posed plans for Tresidder, at least

a Ihey stand now; must be altered
slightly. The alteration need only
be such lhat the ultimate synthe
sis of social and intellectual life,
which is tho professed goal, bp
more secure.
As the plans exist now, the suc
cess of their achieving this goal
will depend on most wondrous
dialectic. For both Berry and
Merryman argue that a suitable
approach for improvement of the
intellectual environment at Stan
ford will he to place all special
lectures for example for Tuesday
Evening series-talks, meetings
and debates in a central spot like
the Union.
Social Attractions
The Union, meanwhile, through
its social and recreational attrac
tions (Thesis) will draw to the
building considerably more stu
dents than would otherwise go to
such intellectual activities outside
the classroom (Antithesis). The
result wilf be that students, who,
for example, enter Tresidder to
spend their 1 time playing ping
pong, will either see notices on the
bulletin boards or hear from other
students going into the meeting
rooms that a lecture —say, by Mor
timer Adler—is being given, and
will probably (inevitably?) be
curious enough to go hear it.
(Synthesis.)
Nevertheles it is quite conceiv
able that the dialectic is standing
on it head: it might in fact pro
duce the opposite of the desired
goal. There is no more reason to
believe that students originally
going to the union to play a game
will necessarily end up hearing a
lecture of listening to music, than
that the students originally going
to hear a lecture or music will not
end up playing games.
Integral Fart
Recreational facilities can and
should be an integral part of a
residential university. If enough
student prefer (and apparently
they do) bowling and billiards,
then bowling and billiards belong
in the new Union: Berry, Merry
man and their committees cer
tainly cannot be criticized for pro
viding them. Tf anything they
may deserve praise.
But they can be criticized if
they have not guaranteed the
Stanford community which is,
after all, an academic community
that the new Union will suffi
ciently serve the cultural and in
tellectual needs as well as the rec
reational and social, Ihe four
needs Ihe original report of the
Board of Trustees declares the
new Union must provide for.
As plans stand now, no such
guarantee is forthcoming or
perhaps even considered. If Tres
idder does manage to reduce the
cleavage between intellectual and
social life at Stanford, as the sup
porters of the preent plans argue,
then the resulting synthesis must
be balanced on the proper side
and this must invariably be Ihe
academic side.
Bowling Facilities
This means that if Tresidder is
to provide bowling facilities for
50 persons, it ought to provide
reading facilities for more than
50; if it is to accommodate 50 per
sons at billiards, it ought to ac
commodate more than 50 persons
listening to music.
The only exception to such a
goal seems to be the eating facili
ties. But even these, if sufficiently
well planned, could just as easily
further the goal as hinder it and
at the same time provide more re
laxed surrounding and greater en
joyment than plans now envision,
as tomorrow's article will show.
