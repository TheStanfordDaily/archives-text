Health Service
Editor, Tli«* Daily:
The immoderate and essentially
unjust editorial concerning the
Student Health Service cannot
pass unnoticed.
I have exercised close scrutiny
over the activities of this service
for a period of fourteen years
and can say without any reser
vation that the achievements have
been magnificent and outstanding
among all student health services
in the nation. All serious matters
come to my attention and I can
certify that there has never been
an instance of neglect of duly or
a mistake that has endangered
the life of any student.
And on the other side, there
are a large number of students
alive today who are alive because
of devoted and dedicated service
of a really competent group of
doctors.
A doctor's professional compe
tence and integrity are his. life.
I wonder if the thoughtless writer
of this editorial realized how
much pain such an outburst can
cause to people who do their best
— and a very good best indeed.
Such heedless cruelty, based on
the most unreliable sort of hear
say evidence, does not speak well
for the sense of responsibility of
the perpetrator of it. I am sure
the same person would not throw
a brick through I h<> plate glass
window of a commercial establish
ment that displeased him, or de
posit filth in the school's library
because he got the wrong book.
This act does more harm than
either of the others.
No person and no institution
is perfect. I am certain every
doctor who sees a number of pa
tients makes mistakes at times.
Does the editor have a straight
100 per cent record an his ex
ams?
But I want to make it emphati
cally plain that Stanford has one
of the best health services of any
university staffed by experienced,
competent, and dedicated people,
and deserves not ugly epithet but

high praise and respoct from the
student body.

Unique Experience?
Editor, The Daily:
The editorial in Monday's Daily
entitled "Candy Pills ..." cites
abuses which should be corrected,
certainly, when and if they occur.
But I feel that one more case
history .should be presented:
Last July, a new student took
the standard physical examina
tion at the Health Service. He
had a detached retina which
sooner or later would lead to
blindness in one eye.
Despite the slim 10 per cent
chance of success, the Health
Service insisted that an expensive
operation should be attempted, at
their expense, less than a month
after the new student had en
rolled. It succeeded.
Since it was my eye, I am grate
ful that the "poor facilities" and
"inadequate personnel" happened
to be on the ball that particular
day.
Is my experience unique?

Le Grand Charles
Editor, The Daily:
In his article on "Democracy
Ignored" your contributing editor,
Mr. Dick White, soars to new
heights of poor taste and compla
cent stupidity.
Whether or not "democracy is
still undoubtedly the fairest sys
tem for the individual," as Mr.
White asserts, is his own imper
tinent opinion, to which he is fully
entitled. History merely teaches
us that democracy has never been
the prevailing system in the past,
nor is it the prevalent system
now.
But as far as Do Gaulle is con
cerned, the P i' e si d en t of the
French Republic has conspicu
ously shown his respect for re
publican institutions. He has done
so three times:
In 1946, when, as unchallenged
master of French destinies, he

chose to step aside and retire to
private life.
In 1958, when he came back to
power and proved to be the vig
orous defender of the same repub
lican institutions that the impo
tent and grovelling "parliamen
tary leaders" were ready to de
liver into the hands of a group
of military leaders backed to the
hilt by fascists and reactionaries
of all labels.
A few months ago, when, with
the enthusiastic support of the
French Nation (and that includes
the Communists, who of 112 e r e d
their fullest support» he smashed,
swiftly and decisively, a new at
tempt at blackmail and intimida
tion, spawned again in Algeria,
and backed once more by a whole
gamut of crypto-fascists, racists,
and fifth columnists.
"Le Grand Charles" stands too
tall to need a defense against so
dwarfish a criticism as the one
leveled by Mr. White. But the
Daily doesn't. And as the "Penin
sula's Only Morning Newspaper,"
you should not be unaware of
basic historical facts, if you wish
to distinguish between incisive
criticism and dumb, malicious
slander.
Hans Wolpe
Assistant Professor
of French
Editor's Note: Dr. Wolpe in an
swering the article "Democracy
Ignored" has shown that DeGaulle
has supported France's republican
traditions. According" to the dic
tionary, a republic is "a state in
which the sovereign power resides
in a certain body of the people."
In other words it is a government
that is neither colonial nor con
trolled by an absolute monarch or
a dictator. It has never been ar
gtied that DeGatille desired to be
a monarch or to make France a
colony. Rather it was stated that
he did not support the democratic
institutions, and I)r. Wolpe has
ignored this fact.
Rehabilitation
Editor, The Daily:
1 feel that there are two resi
dues in our penal system which
have been more generally dis
claimed. These would be the
principle of retribution or "an
eye for an eye" and the prin
ciple of constitutional criminality.
These two principles are closely
interwoven; but the more general
application is well illustrated by
the case of Caryl Chessman.
The penalty prescribed for
Chessman was clearly retributive,
that is, proportional to the sever
ity of the offense. The residue
of the principle of constitutional
criminality comes out when we
consider that Chessman was exe
cuted despite the fact that he was
no longer Chessman the Crimi
nal.
So, as has* been said already,
the two above principles, although
generally discredited, are still op

! erative in our penal system. T fool
that they also contradict any con
j structive purposes our ponal sys-
I torn might have. I assume that a
! criminal is placed in a penal insti
tution so that 11 t he can be pre
i vented from doing further harm
to society, and i2> he may bo
rehabilitated so as to become a
valuable member of society.
In the light of those purposes,
common sense tolls us that crimi-

I nals should be detained until re
habilitated, and then released. Re
venge has never had any positive
value for society, and I hope that
at least every educated person
, attributes the cause of criminality
to environmental factors rather
than to inherited defects.
