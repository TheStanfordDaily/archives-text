If there is any criticism to be
made of the State Department in
its dealings with South Korea, it
is that it might well have acted
•sooner. For years Korea has been
an American headache. Dr. Rhee
has played the despot and has car
ried on a regime which made a
mean joke of the bloody struggle
we waged to save South Korea for
democracy and liberty. In his re
lations with Japan and with his
powerful neighbors in East Asia
he has been an irresponsible nuis
ance. With his war-mongering he
would have been a dangerous
nuisance had we not kept a close
watch on him.
After the brazen Iheft of the
elections in March his dictator
ship, which we had just managed
to tolerate, became intolerable.
For after the violence and dishon
esty of the elections, rebellion
broke out all over South Korea.
Ilis government had lost the final
excuse by which dictatorships can
be justified —that they are able
to govern. When Dr. Rhee re
signed, he had ceased to be aj)le
to govern.
In all probability the United
States could not have saved Dr.
Rhee had it wanted to do that.
There was no reason why we
should have wanted to save him.
In taking its stand against Dr.
Rhee and for a new deal, the
State Department acknowledged
the inescapable responsibility of
the United States.
It is that we are involved in
Korea and are responsible for the
maintenance of a stable and a rea
sonably liberal regime. It was an
honest and a healthy thing to in

tervene openly. For the open in
tervention is a public acknowledg
ment of the real situation, which
is that the South Korean state was
created by American arms, is pro
tected by American power, and is
maintained by American subsi
dies.
All the world knows this, and
therefore all the world holds the
United States accountable for the
behavior of the South Korean gov
ernment. There is no way in
which we could protect and sup
port South Korea and at the same
time act as if it were an independ
ent country like, for example,
Switzerland or Denmark. The
critics of the State Department's
intervention cannot have it both
ways. They must not ask us to
underwrite South Korea and at
the same time demand that we
leave it entirely alone.
It would suit most of us in
America much better it we could
leave Korea alone, it we did not
have to intervene, if we did not
have to take a part in overthrow
ing a government, if we did not
have to worry about its successor.
Hut the only alternative to doing
these disagreeable things is to
withdraw from South Korea, and
to stand aside, and to let it be
sucked into tin'orbit of Keil China.
As we have no intention,of al
lowing South Korea to become a
Chinese satellite, as South Korea
is quite incapable of maintaining
its own independence and its own
liberty, it must continue to bo
not to use the word satellite our
client and our ward.

Ilis government had lost the final
excuse by which dictatorships can
be justified —that they are able
to govern. When Dr. Rhee re
signed, he had ceased to be aj)le
to govern.
In all probability the United
States could not have saved Dr.
Rhee had it wanted to do that.
There was no reason why we
should have wanted to save him.
In taking its stand against Dr.
Rhee and for a new deal, the
State Department acknowledged
the inescapable responsibility of
the United States.
It is that we are involved in
Korea and are responsible for the
maintenance of a stable and a rea
sonably liberal regime. It was an
honest and a healthy thing to in

tervene openly. For the open in
tervention is a public acknowledg
ment of the real situation, which
is that the South Korean state was
created by American arms, is pro
tected by American power, and is
maintained by American subsi
dies.
All the world knows this, and
therefore all the world holds the
United States accountable for the
behavior of the South Korean gov
ernment. There is no way in
which we could protect and sup
port South Korea and at the same
time act as if it were an independ
ent country like, for example,
Switzerland or Denmark. The
critics of the State Department's
intervention cannot have it both
ways. They must not ask us to
underwrite South Korea and at
the same time demand that we
leave it entirely alone.
It would suit most of us in
America much better it we could
leave Korea alone, it we did not
have to intervene, if we did not
have to take a part in overthrow
ing a government, if we did not
have to worry about its successor.
Hut the only alternative to doing
these disagreeable things is to
withdraw from South Korea, and
to stand aside, and to let it be
sucked into tin'orbit of Keil China.
As we have no intention,of al
lowing South Korea to become a
Chinese satellite, as South Korea
is quite incapable of maintaining
its own independence and its own
liberty, it must continue to bo
not to use the word satellite our
client and our ward.

If there is any criticism to be
made of the State Department in
its dealings with South Korea, it
is that it might well have acted
•sooner. For years Korea has been
an American headache. Dr. Rhee
has played the despot and has car
ried on a regime which made a
mean joke of the bloody struggle
we waged to save South Korea for
democracy and liberty. In his re
lations with Japan and with his
powerful neighbors in East Asia
he has been an irresponsible nuis
ance. With his war-mongering he
would have been a dangerous
nuisance had we not kept a close
watch on him.
After the brazen Iheft of the
elections in March his dictator
ship, which we had just managed
to tolerate, became intolerable.
For after the violence and dishon
esty of the elections, rebellion
broke out all over South Korea.
