# THE 						Finish Line
## 
### Dick Barnes 
A Difference of O, >inion
No matter how you look at it, Stanford is going to have plenty of
trouble lining up the (>(> points ii will take to win Saturday's l»iy
with Cal.
Cal's Brutus Hamilton told Northern California track and field
writers Monday that the meet should go down to the relay.
Unfortunately for the local tannery, Payton Jordan's estimate of
a 20-point difference between the two teams with Stanford on the
short end looks far more realistic. 1 figured out one way the Tribe
could dredge up (>(i points but looking without local prejudice, that
(it! points dropped to 54 and Cal had 77 instead of 65.
The most publicized duel between Krnie Cuiiliffe and Jerry Sie
bert in the KXO may not materialize, at least to its maximum poten
tial. Jordon has said for several weeks that Cuiiliffe will run only
the 880 this week, and will not double any more this year. Hamilton,
however, plans to use Siebert in the mile, some 40 or 45 minutes
before the two-lapper.
Hamilton's strategy is sound without Siebert in the mile, Cal
could be shut out. With him in, they're a cinch for three, and pos
sibly five points. Even with an all-out mile behind him, Siebert can
still take second in the halt. And he probably wouldn't do any better

than second even if he ran fresh.
The one fly in the Siehert-dou
ble ointment is that he probably
couldn't come hark with a top re
lay leg. Cal's best quartet is better
than Stanford's best, but without
Siebert to fight, the Indians might
stand a chance in the concluding
event.
At this point in the strategizing,
then, it looks like Cunliffe pri
marily against the clock in the
SSO. He has bests of 1:17.3 for the
full two laps, and 1:46.6 for 800
meters. Tapes and timers will bo
at both points in the event that
he flirts with world records of
1:46.8 and 1:45.7. Barring bad
weather (-especially wind) and as
suming he does not l;o in the mile,
1 foresee splits of 25.5, 51.5, and
1:18.5, with a final 28-seconcl 220,
for 1:46.5 and a new world mark.
The 800-meter clocking would be
1:45.8. one-tenth shy of Roger
Moen's mark.
Back to the rest of the meet:
Dean Smith versus Willie White
in the dashes looks like a good

pair of battles, with White likely to prevail at the shorter distance
hut Smith the better bet around a turn in the 220. Stanford needs
thirds from Norm Pease, but he'll have a tough time getting the
point in the 220 against Bob Karlsrud.
( a I is a virtual cinch for eight points in the quarter with Jack
Yerman and Karlsrud. The toss-up is the show point Kon Kott could
sweep for Cal, or Itob Hesse could keep Stanford in the meet.
Stanford, which has had hurdler troubles all year, might actually
pick up eight points in the barrier races with seconds and thirds.
Cebron Riiss should be an easy double winner for Cal, but the Bears
lack support here, though il wouldn't take much to edge out Stan
ford's crew. White has won the lows for the last two years, but this
season a change in event order has put the lows directly after ihe
220. Hamilton says his man is an unlikely candidate in the lows.
The two-mile could lie both a key race and battle of the walking
wounded. Alan Gaylortl has had arch trouble, and Bob Mon/ingo has
had ankle problems. Throw in unpredictables John North way and
Karl Uebel, and the race could go any of several ways.
Unknowns Battle in the Field
Keys to the field events are in the place and show fights. Don
Bell, Alt Batchelder and Jerry Winters should win the weights for the
Indians. But Bob Besse in the javelin. Bob Atkinson, in the shot, and
Harlan Li miner in the discus must beat out Jerry Nordstrum for sec
ond, third and second respectively to give the Indians point hopes.
Nordstrum came up with Cal's best weight triple since 1949 last
weckpnd 206-10, 49-8 and 1-49-8 1 -. These marks are all in the range
of Besse, Atkinson and Limmer but the Indian trio has been incon
sistent all year.
The pole vault and high jump, Stanford graveyards most of the
year, don't look ready to yield more than four points and two is a
more realistic estimate. Cal's Terry K el ley (14-4» and Knreal Bell
(6-6'a) should win handily. Stanford hopes that Dave Merchant < 13-0)
and Paul Gillespie iB-4 1 :.- > can see their way clear to deadlocks for the
second spots with inconsistent Tom Colton (.14-0) and often-ailing
Dick Dailey ( 6-5 >.
In quick summary, here's where 6G points would have to come
from: 10 in the sprints, 1 in the quarter, 6 each in the half and mile,
3 in the two-mile, 8 in the hurdles, 2 each in the pole vault and high
jump, 6 in the broad jump, 8 each in the discus and javelin, and 6
in the shot.
A bit of a task.

Keys to the field events are in the place and show fights. Don
Bell, Alt Batchelder and Jerry Winters should win the weights for the
Indians. But Bob Besse in the javelin. Bob Atkinson, in the shot, and
Harlan Li miner in the discus must beat out Jerry Nordstrum for sec
ond, third and second respectively to give the Indians point hopes.
Nordstrum came up with Cal's best weight triple since 1949 last
weckpnd 206-10, 49-8 and 1-49-8 1 -. These marks are all in the range
of Besse, Atkinson and Limmer but the Indian trio has been incon
sistent all year.
The pole vault and high jump, Stanford graveyards most of the
year, don't look ready to yield more than four points and two is a
more realistic estimate. Cal's Terry K el ley (14-4» and Knreal Bell
(6-6'a) should win handily. Stanford hopes that Dave Merchant < 13-0)
and Paul Gillespie iB-4 1 :.- > can see their way clear to deadlocks for the
second spots with inconsistent Tom Colton (.14-0) and often-ailing
Dick Dailey ( 6-5 >.
In quick summary, here's where 6G points would have to come
from: 10 in the sprints, 1 in the quarter, 6 each in the half and mile,
3 in the two-mile, 8 in the hurdles, 2 each in the pole vault and high
jump, 6 in the broad jump, 8 each in the discus and javelin, and 6
in the shot.
A bit of a task.

No matter how you look at it, Stanford is going to have plenty of
trouble lining up the (>(> points ii will take to win Saturday's l»iy
with Cal.
Cal's Brutus Hamilton told Northern California track and field
writers Monday that the meet should go down to the relay.
Unfortunately for the local tannery, Payton Jordan's estimate of
a 20-point difference between the two teams with Stanford on the
short end looks far more realistic. 1 figured out one way the Tribe
could dredge up (>(i points but looking without local prejudice, that
(it! points dropped to 54 and Cal had 77 instead of 65.
The most publicized duel between Krnie Cuiiliffe and Jerry Sie
bert in the KXO may not materialize, at least to its maximum poten
tial. Jordon has said for several weeks that Cuiiliffe will run only
the 880 this week, and will not double any more this year. Hamilton,
however, plans to use Siebert in the mile, some 40 or 45 minutes
before the two-lapper.
Hamilton's strategy is sound without Siebert in the mile, Cal
could be shut out. With him in, they're a cinch for three, and pos
sibly five points. Even with an all-out mile behind him, Siebert can
still take second in the halt. And he probably wouldn't do any better

than second even if he ran fresh.
The one fly in the Siehert-dou
ble ointment is that he probably
couldn't come hark with a top re
lay leg. Cal's best quartet is better
than Stanford's best, but without
Siebert to fight, the Indians might
stand a chance in the concluding
event.
At this point in the strategizing,
then, it looks like Cunliffe pri
marily against the clock in the
SSO. He has bests of 1:17.3 for the
full two laps, and 1:46.6 for 800
meters. Tapes and timers will bo
at both points in the event that
he flirts with world records of
1:46.8 and 1:45.7. Barring bad
weather (-especially wind) and as
suming he does not l;o in the mile,
1 foresee splits of 25.5, 51.5, and
1:18.5, with a final 28-seconcl 220,
for 1:46.5 and a new world mark.
The 800-meter clocking would be
1:45.8. one-tenth shy of Roger
Moen's mark.
Back to the rest of the meet:
Dean Smith versus Willie White
in the dashes looks like a good

pair of battles, with White likely to prevail at the shorter distance
hut Smith the better bet around a turn in the 220. Stanford needs
thirds from Norm Pease, but he'll have a tough time getting the
point in the 220 against Bob Karlsrud.
( a I is a virtual cinch for eight points in the quarter with Jack
Yerman and Karlsrud. The toss-up is the show point Kon Kott could
sweep for Cal, or Itob Hesse could keep Stanford in the meet.
Stanford, which has had hurdler troubles all year, might actually
pick up eight points in the barrier races with seconds and thirds.
Cebron Riiss should be an easy double winner for Cal, but the Bears
lack support here, though il wouldn't take much to edge out Stan
ford's crew. White has won the lows for the last two years, but this
season a change in event order has put the lows directly after ihe
220. Hamilton says his man is an unlikely candidate in the lows.
The two-mile could lie both a key race and battle of the walking
wounded. Alan Gaylortl has had arch trouble, and Bob Mon/ingo has
had ankle problems. Throw in unpredictables John North way and
Karl Uebel, and the race could go any of several ways.

1 foresee splits of 25.5, 51.5, and
1:18.5, with a final 28-seconcl 220,
for 1:46.5 and a new world mark.
The 800-meter clocking would be
1:45.8. one-tenth shy of Roger
Moen's mark.
Back to the rest of the meet:
Dean Smith versus Willie White
in the dashes looks like a good

pair of battles, with White likely to prevail at the shorter distance
hut Smith the better bet around a turn in the 220. Stanford needs
thirds from Norm Pease, but he'll have a tough time getting the
point in the 220 against Bob Karlsrud.
( a I is a virtual cinch for eight points in the quarter with Jack
Yerman and Karlsrud. The toss-up is the show point Kon Kott could
sweep for Cal, or Itob Hesse could keep Stanford in the meet.
Stanford, which has had hurdler troubles all year, might actually
pick up eight points in the barrier races with seconds and thirds.
Cebron Riiss should be an easy double winner for Cal, but the Bears
lack support here, though il wouldn't take much to edge out Stan
ford's crew. White has won the lows for the last two years, but this
season a change in event order has put the lows directly after ihe
220. Hamilton says his man is an unlikely candidate in the lows.
The two-mile could lie both a key race and battle of the walking
wounded. Alan Gaylortl has had arch trouble, and Bob Mon/ingo has
had ankle problems. Throw in unpredictables John North way and
Karl Uebel, and the race could go any of several ways.
Unknowns Battle in the Field
Keys to the field events are in the place and show fights. Don
Bell, Alt Batchelder and Jerry Winters should win the weights for the
Indians. But Bob Besse in the javelin. Bob Atkinson, in the shot, and
Harlan Li miner in the discus must beat out Jerry Nordstrum for sec
ond, third and second respectively to give the Indians point hopes.
Nordstrum came up with Cal's best weight triple since 1949 last
weckpnd 206-10, 49-8 and 1-49-8 1 -. These marks are all in the range
of Besse, Atkinson and Limmer but the Indian trio has been incon
sistent all year.
The pole vault and high jump, Stanford graveyards most of the
year, don't look ready to yield more than four points and two is a
more realistic estimate. Cal's Terry K el ley (14-4» and Knreal Bell
(6-6'a) should win handily. Stanford hopes that Dave Merchant < 13-0)
and Paul Gillespie iB-4 1 :.- > can see their way clear to deadlocks for the
second spots with inconsistent Tom Colton (.14-0) and often-ailing
Dick Dailey ( 6-5 >.
In quick summary, here's where 6G points would have to come
from: 10 in the sprints, 1 in the quarter, 6 each in the half and mile,
3 in the two-mile, 8 in the hurdles, 2 each in the pole vault and high
jump, 6 in the broad jump, 8 each in the discus and javelin, and 6
in the shot.
A bit of a task.

No matter how you look at it, Stanford is going to have plenty of
trouble lining up the (>(> points ii will take to win Saturday's l»iy
with Cal.
Cal's Brutus Hamilton told Northern California track and field
writers Monday that the meet should go down to the relay.
Unfortunately for the local tannery, Payton Jordan's estimate of
a 20-point difference between the two teams with Stanford on the
short end looks far more realistic. 1 figured out one way the Tribe
could dredge up (>(i points but looking without local prejudice, that
(it! points dropped to 54 and Cal had 77 instead of 65.
The most publicized duel between Krnie Cuiiliffe and Jerry Sie
bert in the KXO may not materialize, at least to its maximum poten
tial. Jordon has said for several weeks that Cuiiliffe will run only
the 880 this week, and will not double any more this year. Hamilton,
however, plans to use Siebert in the mile, some 40 or 45 minutes
before the two-lapper.
Hamilton's strategy is sound without Siebert in the mile, Cal
could be shut out. With him in, they're a cinch for three, and pos
sibly five points. Even with an all-out mile behind him, Siebert can
still take second in the halt. And he probably wouldn't do any better

than second even if he ran fresh.
The one fly in the Siehert-dou
ble ointment is that he probably
couldn't come hark with a top re
lay leg. Cal's best quartet is better
than Stanford's best, but without
Siebert to fight, the Indians might
stand a chance in the concluding
event.
At this point in the strategizing,
then, it looks like Cunliffe pri
marily against the clock in the
SSO. He has bests of 1:17.3 for the
full two laps, and 1:46.6 for 800
meters. Tapes and timers will bo
at both points in the event that
he flirts with world records of
1:46.8 and 1:45.7. Barring bad
weather (-especially wind) and as
suming he does not l;o in the mile,
