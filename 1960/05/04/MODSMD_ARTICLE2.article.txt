N'o piecemeal settlements would
really relax East-West tension, il

otherwise quiet day. The city is
under martial law as a result of
student demonstrations demand
ing that Turkish Premier Adnan
Menderes' government restore po
litical freedoms.

the NATO Council session as re

Selwyn Lloyd and French Foreign
Minister Maurice Couve de Mur
ville assured their allies any stop
gap deal arranged by President

shchev at the summit meeting in
Paris.
Herter, Lloyd and Couve de
Murville stressed they will de
mand that the Soviets quit trying
to upset governments such as
those of West Germany, Greece
