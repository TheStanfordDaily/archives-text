The brunch is scheduled in Union Court from

Strawberries and Shortcake
A plate of strawberries and shortcake will cost
33 cents, with the price rising to 45 cents for any
one desiring coffee or milk with his cake.
Tickets will be sold at the entrance to the
court. Selling at the brunch will be done by fresh
man women. The food, including both fresh and
frozen strawberries, was donated by Penin.sulans,
and the YWCA Advisory Board baked the cake.
Although the weatherman promises fail 1 wea
ther, the brunch will be moved to the basement
of the Women's Clubhouse if rain should fall.
An attempt will be made, in the shape of the
