## Chilean Students Term Castro's Blasts 'Justified' 
### Maynard Parker 
Eight Chilean student leaders, visiting the United States on a State
Department tour, yesterday termed Cuban Premier Fidel Castro's
recent verbal blasts at the U.S. as "exaggerated but . . . justified."
Speaking through interpreter Donald Barnes, the college students
said that "Castro may be exaggerated but he is justified because his
government has taken action against American business interests and

these interests have, in turn,
burnt 4U tons of sugar cane which
made Castro extremely mad."
The eight will talk today at
4:15 p.m. in Toyon Lounge in an
informal discussion meeting
which is open to the public.
Members of the group include
Fernandez Seyler, 24; Munita
Valdes, 29; Ursic Vesalovic, 22;
Pavez Garcia. 22; Foxley Rioseco,
21; Martinez Miranda. 25; San
hueza Pino, 2(5; and Sidney Ha
molsky, who is the director of
the Chilean-American Binational
Center at Santiago.
Noting the difference in U.S.
and Chilean attitudes on Castro,
the students believed that the
Cuban revolution was "a move
ment which changed Cuba radi
cally. The government there is
trying to completely change the
social structure in order to im
prove the comman man's welfare
and culture.
"VVe realize that Cuba is not a
complete democracy but it would
be futile to write a democratic
constitution until democratic re
alities are attained," they said.
The Chileans expressed hope,
however, that Castro would soon
put Cuba on tho path of legal
and constitutional government.
In their analysis of Chilean-
U.S. relations they criticized U.S.
foreign aid as not enough and not
spent for the right improvements.
They said that the State De
partment should make larger
loans to Chile for social improve
ments, for highways and hospi
tals rather than the present
meager loans for fast return im
provements. The group also asked
for "fairer prices for Chile's cop
per.''
The students were met and
welcomed to Stanford by ASSU
vice president Julie Hirsch and
lIR president Alan Kahn. They
will tour here for three days in
which they will visit classes, see
"Kismet" and tour the Medical
School.
The visitors represent several
student organizations in Chile.
