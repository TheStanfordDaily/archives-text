The Zengakuren, an organiza
tion of Japanese Communist stu
dents, once a useful work tool of
the Japanese Communist Party
(JCP), is today its prodigal son,
disowned hy the father who him
self has reformed.
The Zengakuren's promulgation
in 19 48 was in fact encouraged
and actively helped hy the JCP
which held that "a national stu
dent front must be rapidly unified
and organized for struggle against
power." Subsequently, the student
organization spread its influence
over the universities, and by 1950
thai JCP objective was more or
less achieved.
According to a memorandum
submitted by the Tokyo Univer
sity cell of the JCP to the party
Central Executive Committee in
March 1950, about 5,000 students
had joined the party and MOO stu
dent cells had been formed on the
campuses throughout the country.
The events in the following
years bespeak the considerable
impact tlie JCP had on Japan's
university students. And yet,
since 1958 the influence of the
JCP on the Zengakuren leader
ship has been rapidly waning
while the student radicals them
selves disdainfully branded the
JCP as a "reactionary" and "spur
ious" Communist group.
Today the authorities estimate
the number of JCP members
among university students to be
about 2,000 and that of university
cells to bo about 130.
Of the 850 delegates who at
tended the 14111 national congress
of the Zengakuren in June 1959,
only about 37 per cent of them
were considered pro-JCP minority
while Zengakuren leadership it
sell was in the hands ol' the anti-
JCP majority, the Shagakuren,
constituting 63 per cent of the
conferees.
The difference between the two
stems from the disparity in the
basic concepts of what the student

movement in Japan should be and
the assessments of Ihe political
and economic situation of Japan
and the world today.
The JCP considers the students
movement as a means for univer
sity students to safeguard aca
demic freedom within the cam
puses and to improve the condi
tion of their livelihood and study
of the students. It is not, the JCP
maintains, to be a revolutionary
movement for the cause of social
ism.
On the other hand, the students
are an "ally of the labor class"
and their responsibility is that of
fighting against the reactionary
forces and strengthening and de
veloping the "democratic forces"
whose nucleus should be the work
ing class.
The Zengakuren hold that the
Khrushchev theme of "peaceful
changeover to Socialism," enunci
ated at the 20th Congress of the
Soviet Communist Party, is an
illusion based on ignorance of the
true nature of the monopolistic
capital.
Their basic approach to their
movement is the premise that the
students are the "vanguard" of
the revolutionary force to lead the
workers, farmers and petty bour
geoisie.
For some time now, the JCP has
looked at the student radicals who
comprise the Zengakuren with
disdain and alarm. To JCP, these
students are Trotskyites, anti-
Moscow Communists, who are at
tempting to sabotage the JCP's
efforts.
An editorial in the JCP official
newspaper, "Akahata," stated,
"Let us clearly distinguish the
small group of Trotskyites who,
in control of the leadership of the
Zengakuren, are imposing their
own policy on it, from the mass
of students, and isolate them in
order .to .strengthen, the .joint
struggle of the democratic forces
and the students . . ."
