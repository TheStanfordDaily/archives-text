Editor, the Daily:
Tn his reply to Mr. White's arti-,
cle, "Demoraey Ignored," Dr.'
Mans Wolpe deiends President De
Gaulle as a preserver of republi
can institutions, hut seems to ig- :
no re Mr. White's main point. That
republican forms have been main- j
tained, no one denies: however,
one must question whether this
preserving of forms entails a high
regard for democracy.
Why? The constitution allows
De Gaulle to become dictator at j
will; recently, Hie limited powers
of the National Assembly were
limited even more; the Napole-1
onie behavior of the French presi-'
dent gives one the strong impres
sion that it is not the people who!
are sovereign in France.
Dr. Wolpe, 1 am sure, has a I
deep love for the French nation. ,
Aware of the undoubted benefits]

France ha-s received from her new
leader, he has little patience with
those who criticize him.
I can see Dr. Wolpe's point of
view, but I must take the other
side. Mr. White is aware of
France's many problems and of
the difficulties to be met in solv
ing them; but, being an American,
lie places democracy on a higher
level than the solution of tempo
rary problems.
If to regard democracy as more
important than "stability" las
some call it) is "poor taste and
complacent stupidity." then God
have mercy on us Americans.
If Mr. White's opinion that "de
mocracy is still undoubtedly the
fairest system for the individual"
is "impertinent," then I suggest
that Dr. Wolpe find a country
more suited to his views than the
United States.
