# TRESIDDER UNION
## Grillroom Most Important Facility; Does Type Proposed Fit Stanford? 
### Mike Gordon Dan White 
Editor's Note: This is the third
in a series ol four articles about
the proposed Tresiddcr Union.

According to the preliminary
[plans for the Tresidder Union,
the proposed grillroom is to be
| come "the informal social center
j of the union and the campus."
This eating area, the planners
feel, will be the "most important
: single facility of Tresidder." Yet
! one wonders, after considering
i their reports, whether the type
of grillroom envisioned is alto
gether desirable or necessary.
Stanford can surely use a place
that serves good food; there has
been enough opinion about the
! present Cellar on that 'subject.
But the plans for Tresidder grill
room only grudgingly admit it to
be "ostensibly and even primarily
an eating area." The grillroom is
intended to be much more.
The inside of a room cannot
help but determine the mood of
the persons in it. The planners
of the Tresidder grillroom say
this about their social center:
"Colorful laminated (perhaps
I with custom art work! table tops,
1 molded plastic chairs, colorful
! vinyl wall coverings, suitable
light fixtures, fiberglass printed
draperies, movable, weatherproof
! planters as room dividers, are
| some of the possibilities which
can lend the character of Stan
: ford to ihe room."
Character Consistent?
But it is highly d oubt 112 u 1
whether Ihe character of Stanford
is consistent with such a vinyl
I palace — or if it is, whether it
j should be. The grillroom, as con
' ceivcd in this plan, sounds little
different from a large corpora
tion cafeteria.
Union director Chester Berry
and committees have, to be sure,
; provided for four alcoves within
j the grillroom, seating approxi
mately 125 persons. This leaves
375 others the remainder of the
! intended c a p a c i t y in a large
space unbroken by any barriers.
And from the plans, it is easy to
infer that such partitions as will
exist might be taken down in a
matter of minutes.
The preliminary report sug
gests: "Among the more organ
ized social functions of this room
j may be juke box and orchestra
dancing, entertainment, candle
j light 'night club' programs, open
house, community singing, earni-
I vals, bingo parties, chess or
checker demonstrations, vacation
period parties, jazz concerts, jam
sessions and barber shop quartet
competition."
Widen Rift
This is indeed a full schedule
of organized activities for an "in
| formal social center." It provides
| for a lot of good healthy clean
i living fun. It does not appear to
i hold the prospect of breaking
I down any cleavage between aca
demic and social life. If anything,
[ it might widen this rift.
I A more basic question is that
of whether the university need
I sponsor such activity. If Stanford

is 1o be what Dean Philip Rhine
lander terms an "academic com
munity," it has very little busi-i
ness organizing this kind of rec
reation. This not to say that the
University should not provide,
recreational facilities s u c h a s
those proposed for the union.
Everybody kisses off work some
of the time.
The point here is that Stanford
and the Tresidder Union need not
go beyond fulfilling the responsi
bility that a residence university!
has to provide facilities. As plans
stand for the grillroom, the Uni- ;
versity will be making just this
error.
People complain about the Cel-i
lar jukebox now. What will they
think of one that can dominate
a room of 375 persons? There
are plenty of other places to hold
most of the activities that ihe,
plans look forward to; t he j
lounges, for instance, will also be I
suitable for dancing. And you can
play bingo most anywhere.
Detract from < ulture
In addition, tnere is the ques
tion of how much such social
activity would take away from
the cultural events being held in j
other parts of the union. As I
pointed out yesterday, Ihe draw
can work in just the opposite
manner from that in which the
planners intend.
The point should be clear: Stan
ford does not need a vinyl palace
of bustling activity. It can, as
people like Dean Rhinelander will
agree, use an eating area parti
tioned into 10 or 12 smaller com
partments—in which individuals]
can organize their own activities.
Each of these units can and ought
to have its own character.
For with such a plan, the grill-!
room can be an informal social
center. The present Cellar is 100
small, but it has an easy inli
macy that no area seating 375

will probably attain. Ten areas
for 50 would be much moro likely
to provide such an atmosphere
and if one of them had a juke
box, it wouldn't hurt the rest.
And beyond being a place for
food and talk, a partitioned grill
room might stimulate discussion,
an activity that Berry values
highly; some degree of privacy
would be a help in this direction.
Berry believes that a union should
be "tailor-made" for its campus;
at present, the grillroom that he
and his committees envisage is
not exactly a< good fit for Stan
ford.

And beyond being a place for
food and talk, a partitioned grill
room might stimulate discussion,
an activity that Berry values
highly; some degree of privacy

Berry believes that a union should
be "tailor-made" for its campus;

Editor's Note: This is the third
in a series ol four articles about
the proposed Tresiddcr Union.

According to the preliminary
[plans for the Tresidder Union,
the proposed grillroom is to be
| come "the informal social center
j of the union and the campus."
This eating area, the planners
feel, will be the "most important
: single facility of Tresidder." Yet
! one wonders, after considering
i their reports, whether the type
of grillroom envisioned is alto
gether desirable or necessary.
Stanford can surely use a place
that serves good food; there has
been enough opinion about the
! present Cellar on that 'subject.
But the plans for Tresidder grill
room only grudgingly admit it to
be "ostensibly and even primarily
an eating area." The grillroom is
intended to be much more.
The inside of a room cannot
help but determine the mood of
the persons in it. The planners
of the Tresidder grillroom say
this about their social center:
"Colorful laminated (perhaps
I with custom art work! table tops,
1 molded plastic chairs, colorful
! vinyl wall coverings, suitable
light fixtures, fiberglass printed
draperies, movable, weatherproof
! planters as room dividers, are
| some of the possibilities which
can lend the character of Stan
: ford to ihe room."
Character Consistent?
But it is highly d oubt 112 u 1
whether Ihe character of Stanford
is consistent with such a vinyl
I palace — or if it is, whether it
j should be. The grillroom, as con
' ceivcd in this plan, sounds little
different from a large corpora
tion cafeteria.
Union director Chester Berry
and committees have, to be sure,
; provided for four alcoves within
j the grillroom, seating approxi
mately 125 persons. This leaves
375 others the remainder of the
! intended c a p a c i t y in a large
space unbroken by any barriers.
And from the plans, it is easy to
infer that such partitions as will
exist might be taken down in a
matter of minutes.
The preliminary report sug
gests: "Among the more organ
ized social functions of this room
j may be juke box and orchestra
dancing, entertainment, candle
j light 'night club' programs, open
house, community singing, earni-
I vals, bingo parties, chess or
checker demonstrations, vacation
period parties, jazz concerts, jam
sessions and barber shop quartet
competition."
Widen Rift
This is indeed a full schedule
of organized activities for an "in
| formal social center." It provides
| for a lot of good healthy clean
i living fun. It does not appear to
i hold the prospect of breaking
I down any cleavage between aca
demic and social life. If anything,
[ it might widen this rift.
I A more basic question is that
of whether the university need
I sponsor such activity. If Stanford

is 1o be what Dean Philip Rhine
lander terms an "academic com
munity," it has very little busi-i
ness organizing this kind of rec
reation. This not to say that the
University should not provide,
recreational facilities s u c h a s
those proposed for the union.
Everybody kisses off work some
of the time.
The point here is that Stanford
and the Tresidder Union need not
go beyond fulfilling the responsi
bility that a residence university!
has to provide facilities. As plans
stand for the grillroom, the Uni- ;
versity will be making just this
error.
People complain about the Cel-i
lar jukebox now. What will they
think of one that can dominate
a room of 375 persons? There
are plenty of other places to hold
most of the activities that ihe,
plans look forward to; t he j
lounges, for instance, will also be I
suitable for dancing. And you can
play bingo most anywhere.
Detract from < ulture
In addition, tnere is the ques
tion of how much such social
activity would take away from
the cultural events being held in j
other parts of the union. As I
pointed out yesterday, Ihe draw
can work in just the opposite
manner from that in which the
planners intend.
The point should be clear: Stan
ford does not need a vinyl palace
of bustling activity. It can, as
people like Dean Rhinelander will
agree, use an eating area parti
tioned into 10 or 12 smaller com
partments—in which individuals]
can organize their own activities.
Each of these units can and ought
to have its own character.

people like Dean Rhinelander will
agree, use an eating area parti
tioned into 10 or 12 smaller com
partments—in which individuals]
can organize their own activities.
Each of these units can and ought
to have its own character.
For with such a plan, the grill-!
room can be an informal social
center. The present Cellar is 100
small, but it has an easy inli
macy that no area seating 375

will probably attain. Ten areas
for 50 would be much moro likely
to provide such an atmosphere
and if one of them had a juke
box, it wouldn't hurt the rest.
And beyond being a place for
food and talk, a partitioned grill
room might stimulate discussion,
an activity that Berry values
highly; some degree of privacy
would be a help in this direction.
Berry believes that a union should
be "tailor-made" for its campus;
at present, the grillroom that he
and his committees envisage is
not exactly a< good fit for Stan
ford.
Editor's Note: This is the third
in a series ol four articles about
the proposed Tresiddcr Union.

According to the preliminary
[plans for the Tresidder Union,
the proposed grillroom is to be
| come "the informal social center
j of the union and the campus."
This eating area, the planners
feel, will be the "most important
: single facility of Tresidder." Yet
! one wonders, after considering
i their reports, whether the type
of grillroom envisioned is alto
gether desirable or necessary.
Stanford can surely use a place
that serves good food; there has
been enough opinion about the
! present Cellar on that 'subject.
But the plans for Tresidder grill
room only grudgingly admit it to
be "ostensibly and even primarily
an eating area." The grillroom is
intended to be much more.
The inside of a room cannot
help but determine the mood of
the persons in it. The planners
of the Tresidder grillroom say
this about their social center:
"Colorful laminated (perhaps
I with custom art work! table tops,
1 molded plastic chairs, colorful
! vinyl wall coverings, suitable
light fixtures, fiberglass printed
draperies, movable, weatherproof
! planters as room dividers, are
| some of the possibilities which
can lend the character of Stan
: ford to ihe room."
Character Consistent?
But it is highly d oubt 112 u 1
whether Ihe character of Stanford
is consistent with such a vinyl
I palace — or if it is, whether it
j should be. The grillroom, as con
' ceivcd in this plan, sounds little
different from a large corpora
tion cafeteria.
Union director Chester Berry
and committees have, to be sure,
; provided for four alcoves within
j the grillroom, seating approxi
mately 125 persons. This leaves
375 others the remainder of the
! intended c a p a c i t y in a large
space unbroken by any barriers.
And from the plans, it is easy to
infer that such partitions as will
exist might be taken down in a
matter of minutes.
The preliminary report sug
gests: "Among the more organ
ized social functions of this room
j may be juke box and orchestra
dancing, entertainment, candle
j light 'night club' programs, open
house, community singing, earni-
I vals, bingo parties, chess or
checker demonstrations, vacation
period parties, jazz concerts, jam
sessions and barber shop quartet
competition."
Widen Rift
This is indeed a full schedule
of organized activities for an "in
| formal social center." It provides
| for a lot of good healthy clean
i living fun. It does not appear to
i hold the prospect of breaking
I down any cleavage between aca
demic and social life. If anything,
[ it might widen this rift.
I A more basic question is that
of whether the university need
I sponsor such activity. If Stanford

is 1o be what Dean Philip Rhine
lander terms an "academic com
munity," it has very little busi-i
ness organizing this kind of rec
reation. This not to say that the
University should not provide,
recreational facilities s u c h a s
those proposed for the union.
Everybody kisses off work some
of the time.
The point here is that Stanford
and the Tresidder Union need not
go beyond fulfilling the responsi
bility that a residence university!
has to provide facilities. As plans
stand for the grillroom, the Uni- ;
versity will be making just this
error.
People complain about the Cel-i
lar jukebox now. What will they
think of one that can dominate
a room of 375 persons? There
are plenty of other places to hold
most of the activities that ihe,
plans look forward to; t he j
lounges, for instance, will also be I
suitable for dancing. And you can
play bingo most anywhere.
Detract from < ulture
In addition, tnere is the ques
tion of how much such social
activity would take away from
the cultural events being held in j
other parts of the union. As I
pointed out yesterday, Ihe draw
can work in just the opposite
manner from that in which the
planners intend.
