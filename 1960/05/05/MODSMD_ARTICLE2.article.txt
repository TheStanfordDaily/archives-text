## Russia Makes New Changes In Top Ranks 
### 
MOSCOW (/Pi â€” A sweeping
reform in the upper ranks of the
Soviet government and Commu
nist party was announced last
night. It included the dropping
of Frol Kozlov as a first deputy
premier and removal of Alexei i.
Kirichenko from the party Pre- >
sidium. 1
The Tass news agency said Ko/.-
lov had been relieved of his duties i
as vice premier and elected secre
tary of the party Central Com
mittee.
Kozlov Not Downgraded
There was no reason apparent
here to believe Kozlov has been ,
downgraded. Informants said his
new job as secretary involved
even more rigorous duties and it
had therefore been necessary for
him to quit his old post.
Kozlov had been one of the
Soviet Union's two first deputy
premiers. Anastas I. Mikoyan is
the other.
Another change released Ekat
erina Furtseva from her duties as
a Central Committee secretary.
The highest ranking woman in
the Soviet Communist world, Mrs.
Furtseva was relieved "in view
of her appointment to the post of]
minister of culture of the Soviet
Union," Tass said.

only hours before the Supreme |
Soviet Parliament was scheduled |
to meet to hear an important j
statement from Khrushchev on j
the forthcoming Paris summit j
meeting. Khrushchev himself has |
passed the word about the im
port of his address to be made
to the Supreme Soviet today.
Tass reported tho Central Com-1
mittee elected Alexei Kosygin, |
Niklai Podgorny and Dmitri Po
lynansky as members of the Cen-i
