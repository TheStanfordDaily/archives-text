# ONE HAS STOOD 20 YEARS
## Eight Big Meet Marks in Danger The 						Dope Sheet 
### Dick Barnes 
Eight meet records, including
one that has stood for 20 years,
will be in jeopardy Saturday
when Stanford hosts Cal at 1:30
in the Big Meet.
Five Bears, four Indians, and
relay teams from both schools
all have reasonably good chan
ces to get into the record book.
880 Likely to Go
Most likely record to fall is
Don Bowden's three-year-old
1:50 in the half-mile. Indian
great Ernie Cunliffe is thus far
2960's fastest man in the world
at 1:47.3, and will be running
the half fresh.
Record or no record, Cunliffe
isn't home free as long as Jerry
Siebert is in the race. Siebert
has a more modest 1:49.5 to his
credit, but should get below 1:48
by following the Cunliffe pace
instead of running virtually
alone.
Maury Graves ran a 9:18.1

Eight meet records, including
one that has stood for 20 years,
will be in jeopardy Saturday
when Stanford hosts Cal at 1:30
in the Big Meet.
Five Bears, four Indians, and
relay teams from both schools
all have reasonably good chan
ces to get into the record book.
880 Likely to Go
Most likely record to fall is
Don Bowden's three-year-old
1:50 in the half-mile. Indian
great Ernie Cunliffe is thus far
2960's fastest man in the world
at 1:47.3, and will be running
the half fresh.
Record or no record, Cunliffe
isn't home free as long as Jerry
Siebert is in the race. Siebert
has a more modest 1:49.5 to his
credit, but should get below 1:48
by following the Cunliffe pace
instead of running virtually
alone.
