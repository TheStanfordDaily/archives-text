Proving a point department: What makes a school have consist
ently good teams in one particular sport? Chances are that if you
scouted around you might find that ;i pretty good answer to that
burning issue is emphasis.
For instance, if you talked to someone at Notre Dame, a .school
that usually manages to turn out passable football teams, you'd
probably find that most of the Irish gridders have been aiming for
spots on the Notre Dame team since they were old enough to aim.
Or if you talked to a track star at Abilene Christian, whose track
power since tin* war lias been out of the question, you'd he likely to
find that track takes precedence over all at that Texas school. Con
tinuing' prowess, then, is a question of emphasis.

With the theory thus stated,
we will proceed to the case in
point, namely the University of
Washington crew.
Last Friday, 24 Stanford oars
men. three coxswains and two
coaches landed in Seattle to ready
themselves for a race with the
Washington crew on Saturday.
Not counting a few of the more
solvent Stanfordites who took
taxis, most of them hitchhiked the
13 miles to the Meany Hotel. This
residence was a distinct rise from
the Seattle YMCA where the crew
stayed on its last trip north.
A few hours later the crew went
to Washington's Connibear Boat
house for an afternoon workout.
It was there that the Stanford
crew got its first glimpse of the
Huskie outfit. .
Rowing up to the dock were
three boats manned by 24 men
who looked as though they would
be more at home in a wrestling I
arena. Averaging about 6-4 in
height and around 200 pounds

each, the W ashington aggregation is an impressive group.
How Washington procures this type of crew is now a sort of I
legend among the Stanford rowers. One Washington crew member I
informed 'I rihe veteran Dick Lyon that fully 140 freshman turned
out this year to fight it out for the 24 spots available in 3 frosh boats. !
Huskie Coach Fil Leanderson was in the singularly unique position
oj having to cut seven boatloads of freshmen.

Proving a point department: What makes a school have consist
ently good teams in one particular sport? Chances are that if you
scouted around you might find that ;i pretty good answer to that
burning issue is emphasis.
For instance, if you talked to someone at Notre Dame, a .school
that usually manages to turn out passable football teams, you'd
probably find that most of the Irish gridders have been aiming for
spots on the Notre Dame team since they were old enough to aim.
Or if you talked to a track star at Abilene Christian, whose track
power since tin* war lias been out of the question, you'd he likely to
find that track takes precedence over all at that Texas school. Con
tinuing' prowess, then, is a question of emphasis.

With the theory thus stated,
we will proceed to the case in
point, namely the University of
Washington crew.
Last Friday, 24 Stanford oars
men. three coxswains and two
coaches landed in Seattle to ready
themselves for a race with the
Washington crew on Saturday.
Not counting a few of the more
solvent Stanfordites who took
taxis, most of them hitchhiked the
13 miles to the Meany Hotel. This
residence was a distinct rise from
the Seattle YMCA where the crew
stayed on its last trip north.
A few hours later the crew went
to Washington's Connibear Boat
house for an afternoon workout.
It was there that the Stanford
crew got its first glimpse of the
Huskie outfit. .
Rowing up to the dock were
three boats manned by 24 men
who looked as though they would
be more at home in a wrestling I
arena. Averaging about 6-4 in
height and around 200 pounds

each, the W ashington aggregation is an impressive group.
