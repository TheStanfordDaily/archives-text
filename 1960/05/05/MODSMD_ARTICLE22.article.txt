To Im* oil the Washington crew is to have arrived. A Huskie rower
sleeps, ciils and lives in (ounihear Boat house during Winter and
Spring quarters. He rows mile after mile, day after day, and 30
miles per day during the spring vacation.
His social life, however, is limited. One lucky Huskie had a 12:30
late leave for Saturday night so that he might attend a formal dance .
being given by a sorority. On any other night he would have to be
in bed by 10:30. As a matter of fact a few years ago one member of
the Washington varsity stayed up past the curfew one night and got
engaged. He was seen by one of the coaches at midnight and was 112
promptly demoted to the fifth boat.
After the Tribe crew had its workout and was pulling into the
dock, ihe Washington managers grabbed the Stanford oars and I
pulled Ihe shells gently for fear that their dock would be damaged.
Six shells can bo launched simultaneously from the dock in eompari-!
son with two the Stanford dock can handle.
I'he shells are built in a shop behind the Connibear Boat bouse
and are Hie best made anywhere in the world. Washington's coach
ing launches are 30 feet long with inboard motor, thus comparing
favorably with the dilapidated crafts used by the Stanford coaches
at the liedwood City Yacht Harbor.
A Washington-UCI track meet was started earlier than usual
Saturday so that the fans could get out to Lake Washington to see
the race. Needless to say there were many more people watching 1
the crew race than the track meet.
The Stanford varsity lost by 11» 2 lengths over the 2f, mile course
and the JY's lost by 15 lengths over a similar distance. The frosh
lost by I 1 > lengths over a two-mile course. The -FY's loss was a
distinct improvement over last year when they lost by 22 lengths.
Now, then, what was that about emphasis?
