## Project 'M' Backed by President 
### 
President Eisenhower indicated
yesterday that he will give his
full support to securing authori
zation of Stanford's $107 million
linear accelerator.
Rep. Charles Gubser (R-Gilroy)
said that Eisenhower has instruc
ted his staff to consult with sci
entific advisers and to convey his
support and approval to the min
ority leadership of the House of
Representatives.
The move to force a roll-call
vote in the House, possible to
morrow, on an amendment auth
orizing the Stanford project re
ceived official Republican sanc
tion yesterday in a resolution by
the House Republican policy com
mittee.
Gubser emphasized that he does
not believe the policy committee
action is a purely partisan mat
ter.
However, Robert H. Moult on,
assistant to the president at Stan
ford, commented last night that,
"The unhappy possibility is that
this may harden political lines,
which is what vvc have been trying
to avoid."
Gubser said that he or a mem
ber of the Joint Congressional
Committee on Atomic Energy
would offer the motion to recom
mit the full authorization.
The joint committee voted last
month to cut the $107,200,000
proposed for the project to a $3
million authorization for design
and engineer studies.
Gubser said he believes that the
President's support will fortify
the action of Ihe policy commit
tee in bringing the issue to a
roll call.
A motion to recommit, or force
a roll-call vote on an amendment,
is controlled by the minority.
