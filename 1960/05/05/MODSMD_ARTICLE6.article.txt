# Royal Election, Row Car Wash Continue Today
## 
### Jerry Rankin 
Con Home Week turns down the home stretch today with the re
sumption of king and queen voting and the wind up of car washing.
Balloting at a penny a vote will take up where it left off Tuesday
afternoon, but standings of the candidates will be frozen on the
blackboard at noon. Polls will close at 4 p.m. today.
This is because the voting ends at noon tomorrow and the final

day's voting is always done with
out candidates' supporters know
ing the up-to-the-minute results.
Winners of the contest will he
announced about 3 p.m. tomorrow
at the Carnival on campus.
Dog- Leads
Leaders in the contest right
now are Fritz. Theta Delta Chi's
St. Bernard puppy for king, and
the combination of Mr. and Mrs.
Peter Barnhiesel for queen.
Beverly Aadland is a fairly
close runner-up in the queen bal
loting. while John Callaghan, a
jolly Irish janitor at Toyon Hall,
is second in the king voting.
A slight mistake was made in
reporting that George Sousa, a
king candidate, is a rat. It turns
out he is a bartender at a local
establishment and is nicknamed
"The Rat."
Guthrie and Hurlburt houses
on the Row will end the car wash
ing part of the week today. Guth
rie will wash vehicles for $1 from
1-5 p.m., while Hurlburt will work
from 9 a.m. to dark.
Drive Totals $2311
Incomplete totals for the drive,
announced last night by Terry
Cullinan, drive treasurer, show
$2,311.27 collected so far.
This does not reflect the actual
total of money in hand, though,
since donations from the Penny
Mil c. Hydrofollies concessions,
the on-campus campaign and yes
terday's results from off-campus
solicitations and car washing are
in but not counted.
Contributions so far are from
the following: king and queen,
$150.90; Hydrofollies entries, $40;
Strawberry Brunch, $586.08; and
off-campus, $875.74 from Branner
and $598.13 from Roblc.
Off-campus campaigning will
continue tonight and tomorrow
night as the 614 freshmen work
ers fan out over the Palo Alto-
Atherton-Menlo Park area.
Yesterday
Yesterday's a e t iv i t ie s were
highlighted by the Penny Mile
and a sell-out Strawberry Brunch.
Plans were to have counted the
pennies from the mile yesterday
in the ASSU's penny-counting
machine, but these were thwarted
when it was discovered the pen
nies were too dirty to go through
the delicate contraption.
So, the coppers were shoveled
into cloth bags and will be taken
to the American Trust bank today
and weighed to determine how
much was collected.
The brunch was a delicious, if
somewhat confused, success. It
seems the strawberries or the
cake were alternately being con
sumed faster than the sponsoring
YWCA could supply them.
('ake Kims Out
First, the cake ran out just
before noon. So, strawberries and
whipped cream were served un
til more cake arrived. Then the
strawberries were all gone.
It all wound up with straw
berry juice being poured over
cake as the brunch came to a
close about 4 p.m.
A miniature brunch was served
in the patio of the Hansen Labo
ratories on campus at 3 p.m. to
165 employees who had chipped
in to buy that many servings.
The idea was suggested by
Frederick Pindar, assistant direc
tor of the labs, in the morning.
It mushroomed, and when Pindar
went over to pick up the eats,
over half of the Hansen workers
were in on the mass feed.
Highlighting tomorrow's sched
ule will be the Carnival on cam
pus and the TGIF party al Ma
ma's after the Carnival ends at
4 p.m.
The Carnival, to be held on
campus for the first time this
year, will start at 2 p.m. It will
be located on the corner of Santa
Teresa and Lomita, between Bow
man Alumni House and Roblc.
From 10 to 15 booths are
planned for the Carnival, with all
profits going to Con Home.
A car caravan will head to Ma
ma's after the events at the Car
nival. Admission to the tourna
ment al Mama's will cost 25 eenls.
Games in the tournament will
include such sports as egg throw
ing, horseshoes and miniature
golf. Part of Mama's profits will
L r o to Con Home.

It mushroomed, and when Pindar
went over to pick up the eats,
over half of the Hansen workers
were in on the mass feed.
Highlighting tomorrow's sched
ule will be the Carnival on cam
pus and the TGIF party al Ma
ma's after the Carnival ends at
4 p.m.
The Carnival, to be held on
campus for the first time this
year, will start at 2 p.m. It will
be located on the corner of Santa
Teresa and Lomita, between Bow
man Alumni House and Roblc.
From 10 to 15 booths are
planned for the Carnival, with all
profits going to Con Home.
A car caravan will head to Ma
ma's after the events at the Car
nival. Admission to the tourna
ment al Mama's will cost 25 eenls.
Games in the tournament will
include such sports as egg throw
ing, horseshoes and miniature
golf. Part of Mama's profits will
L r o to Con Home.
Con Home Week turns down the home stretch today with the re
sumption of king and queen voting and the wind up of car washing.
Balloting at a penny a vote will take up where it left off Tuesday
afternoon, but standings of the candidates will be frozen on the
blackboard at noon. Polls will close at 4 p.m. today.
This is because the voting ends at noon tomorrow and the final

day's voting is always done with
out candidates' supporters know
ing the up-to-the-minute results.
Winners of the contest will he
announced about 3 p.m. tomorrow
at the Carnival on campus.
Dog- Leads
Leaders in the contest right
now are Fritz. Theta Delta Chi's
St. Bernard puppy for king, and
the combination of Mr. and Mrs.
Peter Barnhiesel for queen.
Beverly Aadland is a fairly
close runner-up in the queen bal
loting. while John Callaghan, a
jolly Irish janitor at Toyon Hall,
is second in the king voting.
A slight mistake was made in
reporting that George Sousa, a
king candidate, is a rat. It turns
out he is a bartender at a local
establishment and is nicknamed
"The Rat."
Guthrie and Hurlburt houses
on the Row will end the car wash
ing part of the week today. Guth
rie will wash vehicles for $1 from
1-5 p.m., while Hurlburt will work
from 9 a.m. to dark.
Drive Totals $2311
Incomplete totals for the drive,
announced last night by Terry
Cullinan, drive treasurer, show
$2,311.27 collected so far.
This does not reflect the actual
total of money in hand, though,
since donations from the Penny
Mil c. Hydrofollies concessions,
the on-campus campaign and yes
terday's results from off-campus
solicitations and car washing are
in but not counted.
Contributions so far are from
the following: king and queen,
$150.90; Hydrofollies entries, $40;
Strawberry Brunch, $586.08; and
off-campus, $875.74 from Branner
and $598.13 from Roblc.
Off-campus campaigning will
continue tonight and tomorrow
night as the 614 freshmen work
ers fan out over the Palo Alto-
Atherton-Menlo Park area.
Yesterday
Yesterday's a e t iv i t ie s were
highlighted by the Penny Mile
and a sell-out Strawberry Brunch.
Plans were to have counted the
pennies from the mile yesterday
in the ASSU's penny-counting
machine, but these were thwarted
when it was discovered the pen
nies were too dirty to go through
the delicate contraption.
So, the coppers were shoveled
into cloth bags and will be taken
to the American Trust bank today
and weighed to determine how
much was collected.
The brunch was a delicious, if
somewhat confused, success. It
seems the strawberries or the
cake were alternately being con
sumed faster than the sponsoring
YWCA could supply them.
('ake Kims Out
First, the cake ran out just
before noon. So, strawberries and
whipped cream were served un
til more cake arrived. Then the
strawberries were all gone.
It all wound up with straw
berry juice being poured over
cake as the brunch came to a
close about 4 p.m.
A miniature brunch was served
in the patio of the Hansen Labo
ratories on campus at 3 p.m. to
165 employees who had chipped
in to buy that many servings.

machine, but these were thwarted
when it was discovered the pen
nies were too dirty to go through
the delicate contraption.
So, the coppers were shoveled
into cloth bags and will be taken
to the American Trust bank today
and weighed to determine how
much was collected.
The brunch was a delicious, if
somewhat confused, success. It
seems the strawberries or the
cake were alternately being con
sumed faster than the sponsoring
YWCA could supply them.
('ake Kims Out
First, the cake ran out just
before noon. So, strawberries and
whipped cream were served un
til more cake arrived. Then the
strawberries were all gone.
It all wound up with straw
berry juice being poured over
cake as the brunch came to a
close about 4 p.m.
A miniature brunch was served
in the patio of the Hansen Labo
ratories on campus at 3 p.m. to
165 employees who had chipped
in to buy that many servings.
The idea was suggested by
Frederick Pindar, assistant direc
tor of the labs, in the morning.
It mushroomed, and when Pindar
went over to pick up the eats,
over half of the Hansen workers
were in on the mass feed.
Highlighting tomorrow's sched
ule will be the Carnival on cam
pus and the TGIF party al Ma
ma's after the Carnival ends at
4 p.m.
The Carnival, to be held on
campus for the first time this
year, will start at 2 p.m. It will
be located on the corner of Santa
Teresa and Lomita, between Bow
man Alumni House and Roblc.
From 10 to 15 booths are
planned for the Carnival, with all
profits going to Con Home.
A car caravan will head to Ma
ma's after the events at the Car
nival. Admission to the tourna
ment al Mama's will cost 25 eenls.
Games in the tournament will
include such sports as egg throw
ing, horseshoes and miniature
golf. Part of Mama's profits will
L r o to Con Home.
Con Home Week turns down the home stretch today with the re
sumption of king and queen voting and the wind up of car washing.
Balloting at a penny a vote will take up where it left off Tuesday
afternoon, but standings of the candidates will be frozen on the
blackboard at noon. Polls will close at 4 p.m. today.
This is because the voting ends at noon tomorrow and the final

day's voting is always done with
out candidates' supporters know
ing the up-to-the-minute results.
Winners of the contest will he
announced about 3 p.m. tomorrow
at the Carnival on campus.
Dog- Leads
Leaders in the contest right
now are Fritz. Theta Delta Chi's
St. Bernard puppy for king, and
the combination of Mr. and Mrs.
Peter Barnhiesel for queen.
Beverly Aadland is a fairly
close runner-up in the queen bal
loting. while John Callaghan, a
jolly Irish janitor at Toyon Hall,
is second in the king voting.
A slight mistake was made in
reporting that George Sousa, a
king candidate, is a rat. It turns
out he is a bartender at a local
establishment and is nicknamed
"The Rat."
Guthrie and Hurlburt houses
on the Row will end the car wash
ing part of the week today. Guth
rie will wash vehicles for $1 from
1-5 p.m., while Hurlburt will work
from 9 a.m. to dark.
Drive Totals $2311
Incomplete totals for the drive,
announced last night by Terry
Cullinan, drive treasurer, show
$2,311.27 collected so far.
This does not reflect the actual
total of money in hand, though,
since donations from the Penny
Mil c. Hydrofollies concessions,
the on-campus campaign and yes
terday's results from off-campus
solicitations and car washing are
in but not counted.
Contributions so far are from
the following: king and queen,
$150.90; Hydrofollies entries, $40;
Strawberry Brunch, $586.08; and
off-campus, $875.74 from Branner
and $598.13 from Roblc.
Off-campus campaigning will
continue tonight and tomorrow
night as the 614 freshmen work
ers fan out over the Palo Alto-
Atherton-Menlo Park area.
