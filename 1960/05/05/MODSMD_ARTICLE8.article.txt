Competition for the Medaiile
Joffre is an annual event between

debaters from each school com
pete individually for the award.
Old Contest
The contest is the oldest and
longest intercollegiate debate in
the United States, first held at
Memorial Church in 1895 as the
Medaiile Carnot.
The Medaiile Joffre was pre
sented to Kremer by Arthur F.
Domergue, honorary president of
the debate's sponsoring organiza
tion, the Alliance Francaise of
San Francisco.
Franklin 11. Williams, Assistant
Attorney General of California
and one of the judges of the de
bate, indicated that Kremer is one
of the most promising debaters he
has ever heard, according to Jon
M. Ericson, director of the Stan
ford Speech Association.
Extemporaneous
The specific resolution for the
Medaiile Joffre debate is an
nounced three hours before the
debate, so that the event is largely
extemporaneous. The nature of
the contest requires thorough
knowledge of the general question
as well as oratorical proficiency.
Judges of the event were Glenn
M. Anderson. Lieutenant Governor
of California; Earl C. Behrens, po
litical editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle; Dr. Albert E. Fitch,
dean of the Pacific School of Re
ligion; and Louis E. Goodman,
