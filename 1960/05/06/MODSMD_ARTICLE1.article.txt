# CUNLIFFE-SIEBERT DUEL
## Cal Favored in the Big Meet Daily Sports 
### Ron Rapoport 
A track team from the land of
the Golden Bear will journey
across the Pond tomorrow and
come to Stanford Stadium for a
l:3o clash with the Indians in the
03th annual Dig Meet.
Depending upon whom you lis
ten to, the meet is either a toss-up
or a decided victory for tlu* Blue
and Gold. Cal Coac li Brutus Ham
ilton says that the meet will be
close and that he will be happy to
have the win. Stanford Coach
Payton Jordan says that Hamilton
will mcst likely end up by being
happy. Jordan figures Cal the
victor by about 120 points worth.
At any rate. 10,000 fans are ex
pected to see it.

Little Big Meet, pitting the
freshmen spikers. will be held at
the same time as the varsity meet,
with running events alternating.
Stanford, led by 13-9 pole vaulter
Phil White and 6-0 high jumper
John Haynie, is a clear favorite in
this one.
Unfortunately for Stanford pa
trons, Jordan's estimate of the
varsity meet seems more realistic
than Hamilton's and, judging
from the respective list of com
petitors, a Tribe win would be a
definite upset.
No. Double
Indian speedster Ernie Cunliffe
will at least temporarily abandon
his battle with the four-minute
mile and will concentrate on his

specialty, the 880. A world record
in this event is a distinct possi
bility.
Cunliffe's best mark in the hall
mile is 1:47.3, only half a second
off Tom Courtney's world mark.
Cunliffe set that mark against
Fresno, April 2, and has not run
the 880 without doubling in the
mile since. Jerry Siebert, Cal's
top middle distance runner, has a
top 880 time of 1:19.5, and should
force Cunliffe to go all out if he
is to win by his customary wide
margin.
Thus, put a fresh Ernie Cunliffe
up against a fast Jerry Siebert
and a world record could be in the
making. Rich Klier and Dick Las
sen will also go in the 880 for the

Tribe and Chuck Lucas, Rich San
ford and Jack Ycrman will com
pete for Cal.
Lloyd Mile Favorite
With Cunliffe out of the mile,
Stanford's top hope becomes Norm
Lloyd, with a top season mark of
1:10.(i. Siebert will sec action again
for the Bears and has a lop time
of 4:12.4. Bertil Lundh at 4:10.9
and Jeff Evans will also run for
Stanford and Alan Gay10rd,4:12.2.
and Gordon Whitehead will prob
ably go for Cal.
A possible hope for the Tribe to
pick up some badly needed points
appears in the person of Dean
Smith.
Smith, the top Card sprinter,
has been getting bettor every
week and should ho he ahle to
nudge out Cal's Willie White, the
complexion of the meet could
change. White's top time in the
1()() is 9.5 and Smith's is 9.(5. Smith
has the edge in the curve 220 with
a top mark of 21.4 to White's 21.6.
Crowded Field
Stanford will be throwing in a
battery of runners to back up
Smith as Norm Pease, Len Bres
chini and Jim Clouse will also run
in both sprints. Butch deVillers
will run in the 100 for the Bears
and Bob Karlsrud and Jack Yer
man will go iu the 220.
Gaylord should give Cal the win
in the two-mile as he has a best
mark of 9:11.8. Bob Monzingo,
plagued with a sore foot, will lie
the Indians' top hope here. Mon
zingo has a seasn's best of 9:16.7
and John Northway has a 9:19.9
for Stanford.
Jerry Winters should win the
shot-put for Stanford. His sea
son's best is 57-2, while Cal's Dave
Maggard has a best effort of 55-2.
Winters will be backer! up by Bob
Atkinson and Maggard will get
support from Jerry Nordstrom.
High 'lump Key
The high jump is a question
mark. Eurael Bell, with a season's
best of 6-6'i should win for Cal,
but second place is a toss-up. Dick
Dai ley has gone 6-5 for the Bears,
but Stanford's Paul Gillespie
cleared 6-4 'i last week against
Southern Cal and Occidental.
Aim Batchelder should win the
javelin for Stanford and Don Bell
•should have no trouble in the dis
cus.
Cal's Cebron Russ should win
the hurdles easily.
Should the meet go down to
I he relay, the finish will no doubt
be an exciting one. Cal has a best
relay mark of 3:12.3 while Stan
frod has a top time of 3:13.0. De
pending on who runs and who is
fresh anything could happen.

and Gold. Cal Coac li Brutus Ham
ilton says that the meet will be
close and that he will be happy to
have the win. Stanford Coach
Payton Jordan says that Hamilton
will mcst likely end up by being
happy. Jordan figures Cal the
victor by about 120 points worth.
At any rate. 10,000 fans are ex
pected to see it.

Little Big Meet, pitting the
freshmen spikers. will be held at
the same time as the varsity meet,
with running events alternating.
Stanford, led by 13-9 pole vaulter
Phil White and 6-0 high jumper
John Haynie, is a clear favorite in
this one.
Unfortunately for Stanford pa
trons, Jordan's estimate of the
varsity meet seems more realistic
than Hamilton's and, judging
from the respective list of com
petitors, a Tribe win would be a
definite upset.
No. Double
Indian speedster Ernie Cunliffe
will at least temporarily abandon
his battle with the four-minute
mile and will concentrate on his

specialty, the 880. A world record
in this event is a distinct possi
bility.
Cunliffe's best mark in the hall
mile is 1:47.3, only half a second
off Tom Courtney's world mark.
Cunliffe set that mark against
Fresno, April 2, and has not run
the 880 without doubling in the
mile since. Jerry Siebert, Cal's
top middle distance runner, has a
top 880 time of 1:19.5, and should
force Cunliffe to go all out if he
is to win by his customary wide
margin.
Thus, put a fresh Ernie Cunliffe
up against a fast Jerry Siebert
and a world record could be in the
making. Rich Klier and Dick Las
sen will also go in the 880 for the

Tribe and Chuck Lucas, Rich San
ford and Jack Ycrman will com
pete for Cal.
Lloyd Mile Favorite
With Cunliffe out of the mile,
Stanford's top hope becomes Norm
Lloyd, with a top season mark of
1:10.(i. Siebert will sec action again
for the Bears and has a lop time
of 4:12.4. Bertil Lundh at 4:10.9
and Jeff Evans will also run for
Stanford and Alan Gay10rd,4:12.2.
and Gordon Whitehead will prob
ably go for Cal.
A possible hope for the Tribe to
pick up some badly needed points
appears in the person of Dean
Smith.
Smith, the top Card sprinter,
has been getting bettor every
week and should ho he ahle to
nudge out Cal's Willie White, the
complexion of the meet could
change. White's top time in the
1()() is 9.5 and Smith's is 9.(5. Smith
has the edge in the curve 220 with
a top mark of 21.4 to White's 21.6.
Crowded Field
Stanford will be throwing in a
battery of runners to back up
Smith as Norm Pease, Len Bres
chini and Jim Clouse will also run
in both sprints. Butch deVillers
will run in the 100 for the Bears
and Bob Karlsrud and Jack Yer
man will go iu the 220.
Gaylord should give Cal the win
in the two-mile as he has a best
mark of 9:11.8. Bob Monzingo,
plagued with a sore foot, will lie
the Indians' top hope here. Mon
zingo has a seasn's best of 9:16.7
and John Northway has a 9:19.9
for Stanford.
Jerry Winters should win the
shot-put for Stanford. His sea
son's best is 57-2, while Cal's Dave
Maggard has a best effort of 55-2.
Winters will be backer! up by Bob
Atkinson and Maggard will get
support from Jerry Nordstrom.
High 'lump Key
The high jump is a question
mark. Eurael Bell, with a season's
best of 6-6'i should win for Cal,
but second place is a toss-up. Dick
Dai ley has gone 6-5 for the Bears,
but Stanford's Paul Gillespie
cleared 6-4 'i last week against
Southern Cal and Occidental.
Aim Batchelder should win the
javelin for Stanford and Don Bell
•should have no trouble in the dis
cus.
Cal's Cebron Russ should win
the hurdles easily.
Should the meet go down to
I he relay, the finish will no doubt
be an exciting one. Cal has a best
relay mark of 3:12.3 while Stan
frod has a top time of 3:13.0. De
pending on who runs and who is
fresh anything could happen.

Little Big Meet, pitting the
freshmen spikers. will be held at
the same time as the varsity meet,
with running events alternating.
Stanford, led by 13-9 pole vaulter
Phil White and 6-0 high jumper
John Haynie, is a clear favorite in
this one.
Unfortunately for Stanford pa
trons, Jordan's estimate of the
varsity meet seems more realistic
than Hamilton's and, judging
from the respective list of com
petitors, a Tribe win would be a
definite upset.
No. Double
Indian speedster Ernie Cunliffe
will at least temporarily abandon
his battle with the four-minute
mile and will concentrate on his

specialty, the 880. A world record
in this event is a distinct possi
bility.
Cunliffe's best mark in the hall
mile is 1:47.3, only half a second
off Tom Courtney's world mark.
Cunliffe set that mark against
Fresno, April 2, and has not run
the 880 without doubling in the
mile since. Jerry Siebert, Cal's
top middle distance runner, has a
top 880 time of 1:19.5, and should
force Cunliffe to go all out if he
is to win by his customary wide
margin.
Thus, put a fresh Ernie Cunliffe
up against a fast Jerry Siebert
and a world record could be in the
making. Rich Klier and Dick Las
sen will also go in the 880 for the

Tribe and Chuck Lucas, Rich San
ford and Jack Ycrman will com
pete for Cal.
Lloyd Mile Favorite
With Cunliffe out of the mile,
Stanford's top hope becomes Norm
Lloyd, with a top season mark of
1:10.(i. Siebert will sec action again
for the Bears and has a lop time
of 4:12.4. Bertil Lundh at 4:10.9
and Jeff Evans will also run for
Stanford and Alan Gay10rd,4:12.2.
and Gordon Whitehead will prob
ably go for Cal.
A possible hope for the Tribe to
pick up some badly needed points
appears in the person of Dean
Smith.
Smith, the top Card sprinter,
has been getting bettor every
week and should ho he ahle to
nudge out Cal's Willie White, the
complexion of the meet could
change. White's top time in the
1()() is 9.5 and Smith's is 9.(5. Smith
has the edge in the curve 220 with
a top mark of 21.4 to White's 21.6.
Crowded Field
Stanford will be throwing in a
battery of runners to back up
Smith as Norm Pease, Len Bres
chini and Jim Clouse will also run
in both sprints. Butch deVillers
will run in the 100 for the Bears
and Bob Karlsrud and Jack Yer
man will go iu the 220.
Gaylord should give Cal the win
in the two-mile as he has a best
mark of 9:11.8. Bob Monzingo,
plagued with a sore foot, will lie
the Indians' top hope here. Mon
zingo has a seasn's best of 9:16.7
and John Northway has a 9:19.9
for Stanford.
Jerry Winters should win the
shot-put for Stanford. His sea
son's best is 57-2, while Cal's Dave
Maggard has a best effort of 55-2.
Winters will be backer! up by Bob
Atkinson and Maggard will get
support from Jerry Nordstrom.
High 'lump Key
The high jump is a question
mark. Eurael Bell, with a season's
best of 6-6'i should win for Cal,
but second place is a toss-up. Dick
Dai ley has gone 6-5 for the Bears,
but Stanford's Paul Gillespie
cleared 6-4 'i last week against
Southern Cal and Occidental.
Aim Batchelder should win the
javelin for Stanford and Don Bell
•should have no trouble in the dis
cus.
Cal's Cebron Russ should win
the hurdles easily.
Should the meet go down to
I he relay, the finish will no doubt
be an exciting one. Cal has a best
relay mark of 3:12.3 while Stan
frod has a top time of 3:13.0. De
pending on who runs and who is
fresh anything could happen.


NORMAN LLOYD
Seeks mile victory
A track team from the land of
the Golden Bear will journey
across the Pond tomorrow and
come to Stanford Stadium for a
l:3o clash with the Indians in the
03th annual Dig Meet.
Depending upon whom you lis
ten to, the meet is either a toss-up
or a decided victory for tlu* Blue
and Gold. Cal Coac li Brutus Ham
ilton says that the meet will be
close and that he will be happy to
have the win. Stanford Coach
Payton Jordan says that Hamilton
will mcst likely end up by being
happy. Jordan figures Cal the
victor by about 120 points worth.
