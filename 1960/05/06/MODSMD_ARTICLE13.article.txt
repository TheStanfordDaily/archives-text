# LOOKING AROUND
## Sahl at the Conventions 
### Ron Rapoport Associate Editor 
The news*that Mort Sahl is
winding up negotiations with the
National Broadcasting Company
to do commentary on the up
coming presidential • nominating
conventions rates among the
more pleasant bits of informa
tion of the year.
Sahl, the sweater-clad satirist
of just about anything, will pro
vide the television viewers of the
nation with as great a change of
pace from convention oratory as
they are likely to run in 10. At
the same time ho will cause many
of the politicians in the limelight
a few uneasy moments. A few
of Sahl's s t a n d a r d comments
show why.
For instance, his remarks
about Rockefeller (he's prom
ising' the kids little-league polo),
Stevenson (some say he would
be elected if he could only get
nominated) and Nixon (lie had
a tough time when he was in
Russia because he couldn't
ruin anybody's career by call
liim a Communist) are not ex
actly calculated to give these
individuals restful slumber.
Summertime viewers, however,
should be warned that Sahl is
seldom at his best on television.
He remains his caustic and satiri
cal self, but there is no doubt
that he makes a conscious effort
to tone down the severity of his
comments.
Probably the most controversial
remark that television has ever
witnessed came during Sahl's
stint as moderator of the 1958
Academy Awards. Sahl then told
his now-famous story of how,
when General Mac Arthur made
his "I Shall Return" statement
at the beginning of World War
11. some people thought that he
would come back walking on the
water."
Since then it seems that Sahl
has been much more subdued
when on television.
Sahl is far more at home in

night dubs and theaters, for
there he is in his element, lie
can say what he pleases and
know that the more controver
sial he becomes the better the
audience will like it.
When Sahl appeared in a re
vue on Broadway called "The
Next President" a few seasons
Ago, he received a wire l'rom a
member of the audience ad
dressed lo "The Next President,
and I do mean you." It was signed
by Adlai Stevenson.
Sahl has always maintained
that he is not in business to en
tertain, but rather to overthrow
the government ("If I can find
it"). A noble endeavor.
Happily, it seems that the so
cial awareness for which Sahl
stands is coming more and more
to the fore as a part of the lives
of some of his contemporaries.
Steve Allen, who packed up his
television show and moved to Hol
lywood this year, has become a
driving force in the Hollywood
intellectual set. His participation
in conferring with Governor
Brown on Caryl Chessman's exe
cution is a case in point.
Sahl, it must be remembered,
makes his living by taking an
interest in what goes on around
him, while most of the rest of
the entertainment world does
not. Allen's interest once in a
while runs over into his weekly
show and maybe that's a good
sign. As a matter of fact, may
be Said's success and Allen's
interest is a good sign for the
entertainment-consuming public
as a whole.
At any rate, all Sahlites will
be happy to learn that the leader
is currently holding forth at the
hungry, i and from all reports is
better than ever.

Walls' article on Sahl in last Sun
day's San Francisco Chronicle
date hook. Walls calls Sahl the
Schopenhauer of the cell a r s
which all by itself makes the
article a classic of its kind.

would come back walking on the
water."
Since then it seems that Sahl
has been much more subdued
when on television.
Sahl is far more at home in

night dubs and theaters, for
there he is in his element, lie
can say what he pleases and
know that the more controver
sial he becomes the better the
audience will like it.
When Sahl appeared in a re
vue on Broadway called "The
Next President" a few seasons
Ago, he received a wire l'rom a
member of the audience ad
dressed lo "The Next President,
and I do mean you." It was signed
by Adlai Stevenson.
Sahl has always maintained
that he is not in business to en
tertain, but rather to overthrow
the government ("If I can find
it"). A noble endeavor.
Happily, it seems that the so
cial awareness for which Sahl
stands is coming more and more
to the fore as a part of the lives
of some of his contemporaries.
Steve Allen, who packed up his
television show and moved to Hol
lywood this year, has become a
driving force in the Hollywood
intellectual set. His participation
in conferring with Governor
Brown on Caryl Chessman's exe
cution is a case in point.
Sahl, it must be remembered,
makes his living by taking an
interest in what goes on around
him, while most of the rest of
the entertainment world does
not. Allen's interest once in a
while runs over into his weekly
show and maybe that's a good
sign. As a matter of fact, may
be Said's success and Allen's
interest is a good sign for the
entertainment-consuming public
as a whole.
At any rate, all Sahlites will
be happy to learn that the leader
is currently holding forth at the
hungry, i and from all reports is
better than ever.
Recommended reading for

Schopenhauer of the cell a r s
which all by itself makes the
article a classic of its kind.
The news*that Mort Sahl is
winding up negotiations with the
National Broadcasting Company
to do commentary on the up
coming presidential • nominating
conventions rates among the
more pleasant bits of informa
tion of the year.
Sahl, the sweater-clad satirist
of just about anything, will pro
vide the television viewers of the
nation with as great a change of
pace from convention oratory as
they are likely to run in 10. At
the same time ho will cause many
of the politicians in the limelight
a few uneasy moments. A few
of Sahl's s t a n d a r d comments
show why.
For instance, his remarks
about Rockefeller (he's prom
ising' the kids little-league polo),
Stevenson (some say he would
be elected if he could only get
nominated) and Nixon (lie had
a tough time when he was in
Russia because he couldn't
ruin anybody's career by call
liim a Communist) are not ex
actly calculated to give these
individuals restful slumber.
Summertime viewers, however,
should be warned that Sahl is
seldom at his best on television.
He remains his caustic and satiri
cal self, but there is no doubt
that he makes a conscious effort
to tone down the severity of his
comments.
Probably the most controversial
remark that television has ever
witnessed came during Sahl's
stint as moderator of the 1958
Academy Awards. Sahl then told
his now-famous story of how,
when General Mac Arthur made
his "I Shall Return" statement
at the beginning of World War
11. some people thought that he
would come back walking on the
water."
