# 'WHOLESALE PRICES'
## Britannica Salesman Pressures Buyers 
### Andrew W. Nichols 
I write this that others need not
be subjected to the high pressure
barrage of half truths which I
encountered Friday evening. Hope
fully. future "victims" will have
at hand a supply of appropriate
questions to direct to the purport
ed representatives of the "Ency
clopaedia Britannica." If nothing
more, they will save a great deal
of time in so doing.
The come-on: About two weeks
ago 1 inadvertently replied to a
letter from the "Encyclopaedia
Britannica" sent to my dormitory
address. Naturally, no mention
was made of the fact that a sales
man would call.
Phase One: The sales pitch, in
my case, was in four distinct
phases. The first embodies the re
peated affirmation phenomenon.
Prospective buyers are asked if
they would be willing to perform
three absurdly simple tasks in re
turn for a "wholesale" ntudent
rate on the "Britannica." Much in
the manner of the Arthur Murray
telephone qui/,, the bait looks good
and may well lead into the second
phase.
Costs
At this point, however. I insist
ed the salesman get specific about
costs. Compared to a retail cost
of $19/), I was told the new 1960
edition would cost me $378 pay
able over a ten-year period. A re
search service, study guides, etc.,
would be thrown in gratis. I suck
ered for Phase Two.
Phase Two: Mere began the
equivocation over cost. "We have
only found one or two students
who really want to extend their
payments over the ten-year pe
riod." I assured him that they had
now found three. This, he coun
tered, was unfortunate inasmuch
as I would be subject to a "10' '<
bookkeeping charge."
However, they just happened to
have made available a plan for re
tiring the $378 over a two-year
period at less than 3'/ interest.
(At this point I hastily and con
servatively calculated the interest

at 7' '<; the representative was un
able to find my "error.")
Phase Three: With considerably
abated interest, I awaited the next
moveâ€”that of the "big sop." Nat
urally. the company would -save
so much money by closing my ac
count quickly, they could afford
to toss in: 1> a foreign language
dictionary, 2) an atlas, and 3) a
bookcase. They would also pay
mailing and sales tax costs. Even
at the now $400 plus cost, my in
terest was reawakened sufficient
ly to take us into the fourth and
final phase.
Special Offer
Pha-se Four: In accordance with
my real interest, I asked the rep
resentative to leave his card plus
material describing the plan so
that I might reach a decision.
This, unfortunately, was impossi
ble as I was being given a very
"special" offer. An immediate de
cision would be required. My de
cision was indeed immediate, but
it was not to buy the "Britannica."
In the process of telling him what
I thought of such sales tactics, I
lost the opportunity of discover
ing more about the "down pay
ment" (at least S10).
This might have shed light on
the authenticity of my representa
tive. Since then 1 have been told
that "Britannica" salesmen are
noted for the hard sell. Thus, my
man may well have been genuine.
Agreement ?
What can be done? If, as this
gentleman declared, the Univer
sity has an agreement with "En
cyclopaedia Britannica" to call
once on each interested student, I
would, suggest re-examination of
the agreement.
If, as is probably the case, the
University has nothing to do with
the campaign, they might well
take an interest in bringing it to
a halt. These men. if frauds,
should be shown the nearest .jail.
If legitimate representatives of
"Encyclopaedia Britannica," the
student body can at least be made
aware of their tactics and, by in
ference, the quality of the publi
cation which they represent.
