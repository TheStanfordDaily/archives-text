# Berry Sees Diversification As Key-Note of New Union
## 
### Mike Gordon Dan White 
Editor's note: This is the last
article of a series on the proposed
Tresidder Union.

Yesterday's article questioned
the appropriateness of the Uni
; versity's sponsoring organized
activities in the new union be
yond those howling, billiards,
and others the games area will
naturally provide.
In an interview, Director Ches
ter Berry expressed the hope
i that the new union, besides spon
; soring such functions as bingo
parties, carnivals, and checker
demonstrations, could also hold
I student get-togethers like T.G.I.F.
parties.
Why the new union should do
this or why Berry thinks a uni
| versity-sponsored T.G.I.F. party
would be necessary is unclear.
I So far, student initiative has been
sufficiently active in this field
without outside help; no one has
been asking for university guid
| ance here. Obviously, such on
| campus gatherings would be un
' able to offer the attractions found
; in various neighborhood establish
; ments.
Dialectical Process
Botli Berry and Professor John
Merryman insist that the ulti
mate goal of t lie new union is
j to reduce the gap between in
tellectual and social life at Stan
ford. The union may (or may
not i achieve this goal; success
depends upon how well the dia
lectical process by which stu
j dents originally going to the un
! ion for ping-pong will, because
of the proximity of a lecture hall.
1 end up hearing a speaker- will
1 eveniually work.
Even if this dialectic does suc
ceed as expected thus vindicat
ing the predictions of Berry and
i Merryman, it is difficult to see
how T.G.I.F. parties, or similar
I events, will contribute here. Even
a wonderous dialectic has its limi
tations.
Student Advice
Moreover, by holding such ac
tivities in the new union, the
University will, to all affects, be
I admitting it has a serious inter
jest not only in contributing to a
student's intellectual and social
! growt.h, but also in entertaining
i him.
The University has no respon
1 sibility to amuse its members
with such entertainment. Its pro
fessed purpose is to help students
I grow into alert, well-educated
adults not to hold them in an
arrested state of adolescence.
It is probable (but perhaps
equally doubtful* that Berry and
his committees have i n c 1 u d e d
these various activities only be
cause they reflect the desires and
i opinions of most Stanford stu
dents. As mentioned, Berry has
laboriously sought student advice.
Gratification
But when confronted with
choices, especially those involv
! ing only matters of pleasure,
; Stanford students, like most hu
man beings, often select that
which promises to bring the most
instantaneous and satisfying gra
tification. No one ought to expect
the majority of the present group
of students to express their opin
ions on what Tresidder Union
should include in its program
i with regard either to the entire
university or to future students.
And if the present plans for
j Tresidder have included these
! activities without respect to stu
; dent opinion, but with respect
I only to the views of Berry and
his colleagues, then what justi
| fication exists for their inclusion
j in the light of the professed ends
I of a new union?

The purpose of the new union
is to provide Stanford with a
functional community cento r\
Since Stanford is an academic
I community, the union program
| ought to serve ends that will ben
efit its acad e m i c function.
I Whether the program does this
by effecting a long hoped-for
synthesis of intellectual and so
cial life or by other means is
relatively unimportant if the end
; is actually achieved.
Yet as plans now stand, the
I new union will be able to serve
at least 50 bowlers and 150 spec
tators while providing music fa
cilities for 41 listeners at the
most. It will be able to accom
modate at least (>() billiard and
| ping-pong players while offering
a periodicals room that can serve
at most only 2(i readers.
It may eventually provide danc
ing space for 1200 dancers while
offering in four conference rooms,
two lounges, and four meeting
rooms (not contiguous) audience
capacity for 764 listeners. As
pointed out yesterday, the eating
facilities can work either way,
j depending on the direction they
i assume.
Professional Goals
If Tresidder is to be a proper
'community center for Stanford,
I if it is to serve not only under
graduate and graduate students
but also faculty, administration
members, and their families, if it
is to accomplish its professed
goals with a moderate guarantee
if it is to do this, then it must
allow more of its area, more ol
its program, and more of its
attractions for relaxed, quiet
thinking, talking, and listening.
Stanford does need a union,
The union in turn needs a pro
j gram that will benefit Stanford
and the program requires a di
rector who will insure that it does
We believe that Chester Berrv
is this kind of director and thai
with minimum changes the pro
posals that ho and his committees
; have constructed will provide us
! with a Tresidder Union that ultimately
| mately will become a true com
: munity center at Stanford.
