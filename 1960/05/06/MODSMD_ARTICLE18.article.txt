Chileans Speak
We think that Castro's attacks
on the United States are in no
case justifiable in the exagger
ated way in which they have been
made. But they are explainable,
due to the journalistic pressure
placed on the Cuban Government
by American press services and
to the fact, which has been recog
nized by the American Govern
ment itself, that airplanes have
taken off from Florida to burn
sugar cane plantations in Cuba.
In addition, it seems to he essen
tial for any revolution to insti
tutionalize the revolutionary proc
ess. since without institutions
that make for legitimacy and
that channel the dynamic revo
lutionary spirit, and that have
the approval of the clearest na
tional sentiments, genuinely ex
pressed at the polls, a revolution
endangers values of vital impor
tance for its moral justification
and effective work.
We humbly maintain that the
American people, and especially
American students, should make
a great effort to understand the
social changes that are now tak
ing place in Cuba.
We will go to Cuba soon, and
we will have then an opportunity
to compare our opinions with the
facts we will see there.
In the article which was print
ed in the "Stanford Daily", a
statement was marie to the effect
that "the group also asked for
'fairer prices for Chile's copper'."
Our- opinions, expressed in this
way, seem to indicate that we
are asking the U.S. Government

i
for a favor, and this is not true.
What we want is a price that is
fair and duly remunerative for
our copper, as well as the par
ticipation of the Chilean Govern
ment in the establishment of the
price of copper.
