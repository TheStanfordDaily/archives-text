# Russ Down U.S. Plane; 'K' Says Rockets Ready
## Khrushchev Criticizes Ike; Calls Summit Chances Dim 
### 
MOSCOW (/P) Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, in a blister
ing presummit attack on the United States, announced yesterday
that So\iet forces shot down an American plane Sunday on Defense
Ministry orders. He said Soviet rockets are ready to retaliate against
future incidents.
The Soviet Premier and Communist party chief unlimbcred a
wide-ranging attack on the West-

ern Allies. He criticized President
Eisenhower and scoffed at Richard
M. Nixon as a man hardly inter
ested in ending the cold war.
Khrushchev told Parliament
to cheers that the presence of
the American plane over Soviet
territory was an "aggressive act"
intended to frighten the Soviet
Union in advance of the summit.
"One must conclude that ag
gressive forces in the United
States are taking action to inter
fere with the summit." Khrush
chev said. He cont en d e d the
West's attitude "dims chances of
success at the talks" starting May
16.
Khrushchev warned U.S. allies
such as Turkey, Iran and Pakis
tan that nations with U.S. bases
must realize they are playing with
fire and can receive retaliatory
blows.
Khrushchev blasted Eisenhow
er's suggestion that Vice Presi
dent Nixon might sit in for him
at the summit if the President
has to return to Washington.
Khrushchev, saying Nixon could
hardly be thought of a a man in
terested in ending the cold war,
commented: "I am afraid that if
Nixon becomes entitled to carry
on negotiations at the summit, it
would be. as we say in Russia,
like sending a goal to take care
of the cabbage."
He assailed the U.S. State De
partment's Christian A. Herter
and Douglas Dillon for recent
speeches "far from giving hope."
Sunday, when Khrushchev says
the plane was shot down, was
May Day, a major holiday here.
Until Khrushchev spoke. Ameri
cans in Moscow were unaware of
any incident. U.S. officials said
later the plane referred to may
have been a U2 jet manned only
by its pilot. A weather research
plane which took olf in Turkey
Sunday was lost, the U.S. officials

said, and may have strayed into
Soviet Armenia.
Khrushchev started his account
this way: "At i:36 a.m. May 1 an
American airplane crossed our
border and continued to fly into
the interior of Soviet territory."
The 1,200 deputies were hushed.
Khrushchev went on: "The min
ister of defense immediately re
ported to the government about
this aggressive act. The govern
ment said: The aggressor knows
what he is doing when he enters
foreign territory. If he remains
unpunished, he will undertake
new provocations.
"That is why it was necessary
to act —to shoot down the plane."
The deputies roared with ap
plause.
"Preliminary investigation indi
cates it is an airplane belonging
to the United States of America,
although it does not have any
identifiable marks," said Khrush
chev.
Addressing U.S. leaders rhetori
cally. Khrushchev demanded: "If
you think you can take such
measures, why don't you think we
can take similar measures when
a plane appears over our territory
and threatens the security of our
country? We have the same rights
as you, the same means as you.
"We have no bombers on duty,
but we have rockets on duty. They
are more accurate and trustwor
thy than your bombers."

new provocations.
