# Card Golfers In Southland
## 
### 
Stanford's once â€¢ beat on varsity
golfers are spending this weekend
in southern California, attempting
to maintain t heir now unblemished
AAWU record in matches against
USC and UCLA. The Card swing
ers handily outplayed Cal 22 ,^-4
in their first outing.
USC also has but one loss .and
should he tough. Knowledge of
their course gives them an advan
tage over coach Bud Finger's team
of Bill Farrish, Kent VVinton, Ron
Preston. Bill Seanor, Pete Choate,
and Steve Smith, who are playing
only one practice round before the
matches.
However. Farrish and Winton
have both scored 67's on the tough
Stanford Course ihis year, and
Bill Seanor's return to the squad
after an automobile accident
could enable the Tribe to take
both.
Senior Preston finished in fourth
spot in the NorCal Intercollegiate
tournament.
