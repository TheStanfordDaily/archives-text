# Indians Have Two Shots At Slumping California '9'
## 
### Roy Schmidt 
Stanford's varsity baseballers
will finally have a showdown with
California, and the Indians could
n't have picked a better time for
the meeting. The Cards travel to
Berkeley lor today's 3:15 encoun
ter; the two teams will square off
again tomorrow on the Sunken
Diamond.
California, who jumped off to a
big lead early in the season with
eight straight wins, has dropped

off in the hitting department late
ly. Reports from Berkeley have
ii that Coach George Wolfman
may shake up the lineup if the
Bears don't return to their early
season form.
Same Lineup
Stanford, still looking for an
opportunity to even things after
their 4-3 loss to Cal earlier in the
season, is expected to go with the
usual starting lineup.
Coach Dutch Fehring has de
cided on his pitchers for the se
ries hut will wait until the last
minute before naming today's
starter. It'll be Jim Smith and
Marv Mecklenberg in whatever
order Fehring decides on.

Wolfman is expected to counter
with his top moundsmcn, Tod Set
tle and Bob Oakley, but again the
order has not been decided. Settle,
rated by Fehring as one of the
best pitchers in the CII3A, has
an over-all 7-3 record tor the 1 sea
son and is 3-1 in league play. The
only mar on Settle's record was
the Bears' 8-6 loss to USC last
weekend.
Oakley Impressive
Oakley, only a sophomore, has
been a pleasant surprise for the
Bears this year. He has been
working in regular rotation with
Settle lor most of the year and
was impressive against 1 he Tro
jans last week.
The Bears have a potent hilling
combination in Noel Barnes, Bob
Millinich, Bob Milano, and Tom
McGarrey. Barnes tops the league
in hitting with a .125 average de
spite a fruitless series against the
Trojans. Millinich. at .343, is the
sixth leading CIBA hitter; Mi

lano, ,28f>. is ninth; and McGar
rey, .281, is tenth.
Should Meeklenberg or Smith
â€¢silence the Boar bals today, Wolf
man would probably insert some
speed into the lineup by calling on
third baseman Kevin Searpelli
and outfielders Dee Lewis and
Barry Arnett.
Fourth in Loop
Card team captain Jim Burk is
now fourth among CIBA hitters
at .379, although Skip Lawrence
has a higher average for the en
lire season. Burk and Lawrence
are the only Indians over the .300
mark.
California still holds a game
and a half lead over second place
USC but that margin looks even
slimmer with the Trojans playing
three games with cellar-dwelling
UCLA in an eight-day span.
Stanford now rests in fourth
place one and a half games behind
Santa Clara and four and a half
back of Cal. The Indians could
play the spoiler's role tliis year,
for they have three remaining
games with Cal, two wtih USC
and two with Santa Clara.
