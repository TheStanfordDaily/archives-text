A GUIDE FOR THE LOVELESS
fiontlemen, take warning. Juno is almost upon us .111110, the
month of I (rides. Have you got yours yet? If not, don't de
spair. You don't have to he rich or handsome to get a girl. All
you have to he is kind, considerate, thoughtful, and obliging—
in short, a gentleman.
For example, don't ever call a girl for a date at the last min
ute. Always give her plenty of advance notice like three
months for a coke date, six months for a movie, a year for a
I iron), two years for a public execution. This shows the girl that
she is not your second or third choice and also gives her ample
time to select her costume.
And when you ask for a date, do it with a hit of Old World
gallantry. A poem, for instance, is always sure to please a
young lady, like this. *
/ think you're rule,
Dii/iIiiu La France,
J'II put on <1 ftnit,
.1 ml tak< you to a dance.
Tn the unlikely event that you don't know any girls named
Daphne La France, try this:
1 think you'rt cute,
Winifred./<>p/>.
/'II /ml on a suit,
.1 ml take yon to a hop.
Tn the extremely unlikely event that you don't know a Wini
fred Jopp either, try this:
1 think you re cute,
Isabel Frail.
I'll put on a suit,
A 7id take iiou to u ball.

Tf there i- no Isabel I'rull, Winifred Jopp, or Daphne La
France on your campus, it is quite obvious why you've had
trouble finding dates all year: you've enrolled in an all-male
school, you old silly!
Next let us take up the question (tf etiquette once you are
out on a date with Isabel, Winifred, or Daphne. The first thing
you do, naturally, is to offer the young lady a Marlboro. He
sure, however, to offer her an rutin Marlboro—not just a
Marlboro butt. Marlboro butts are good of course, but whole
Marlboros are better. You get an extra inch or two of fine
flavorful tobacco —and I mean flavorful. Do you think flavor
went out when filters came in? Well, you've got a happy sur
prise coining when you light a Marlboro. This one really de
liver- the goods on flavor, and when you hand Isabel, \\ inifred,
or Daphne a whole, complete, brand-new Marlboro, >he will
know how highly you regard and respect her, and she will grow
misty and weak with gratitude, which is very important when
you take her out to dinner, because the only kind of coed a
college man can afford to feed is a weak and mMv coed. Latest
statistics show that a coed in a normal condition eats one and
n half times her own weight every twelve hours.
At the end of your date with Isabel, Winifred, or Daphne,
make certain to get her home by curfew time. That i> gentle
manly. Do not leave her at a bus stop. That is rude. Deliver
her right t<» her door and, if possible, stop the ear when you are
dropping her off.
The next day send a little thank-you note. A poem i- bc-t.
Like this:
For a wonderful ertning, ntani/ thanks,
Isabel, Winifred, nr Daphne.
I'll tak< i/oii nut for somr more merry pranks
,\cjt Saturday if you'll haph mi, n»«» Mm shuim*»

Wr can't give you rhyme but ire'lt give you good reason ivhy
you'll enjoy Marlboro and Marlboro's nnliltered companion
cigarette, I'liilip Morris. One word sags it all: flavor.
