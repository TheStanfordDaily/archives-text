• Institute of International Rela
tions: $3,075.
• Rally Commission: $1,463.

Legislature was also reminded
of an additional $700 lIR appro
priation for the Foreign Policy
Institute, approved as a deferred
budget item earlier this year so
that the lIR could negotiate for
a speaker.
Proposed by-laws changes for
Rally Commissions organization
were tabled until the whole com
mission considers the changes,
and a class government report
stated that since class govern
ments are exclusively social or
ganizations they should be treat
ed no differently than other clubs
under the ASSU.
