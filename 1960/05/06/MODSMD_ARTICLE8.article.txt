# Hajj, Wazir, Ababu Princesses Shine in Ram's Head's 'Kismet'
## 
### Mary Lou Mckinley, Managing Editor 
A roguish Ilajj, a marvelously wicked wazir and three delightful princesses of Ababu created a Bagh
dad and Tartars could never have captured when the Ram's Head production of "Kismet" opened
Wednesday night in Memorial Auditorium.
Everett Nygaard played the poet Hajj with a twinkle in his eye and such contagious zest that the
stage was greatly enlivened whenever he appeared.
Nygaard's familiarity with the role, along with his sense of timing for comedy and well-developed
voice, created a polished characterization that never lagged or failed to entertain. "Gesticulate" showed
him at his best.
As the Wazir of Police, Doug Johnson was equally outstanding. An excellent comic with remark
able facial expression. Johnson played the part with an earnestness that brought out fully the humor
in the role. His "Was 1 Wazir?" was one of the highlights of the production.
Adding a touch of freshness and originality to the musical, the princesses of Ababu. played by

Judy Phillips, Lynn Boatsman and
Mary lane Fitch stole the show
whenever they were on stage.
Choreographer Cally Tanner
was just as responsible for their
success, creating for them some
| of the most original and clever
' movements I've ever seen. Their
1 dance-pantomime of a hunt per
formed for (he Caliph brought a
i hush over the audience and an
{enthusiastic round of well-deserv
ed applause.
Seductive Sparkle
Donna D'Fini. while having
trouble with volume and a few of
her high notes, created a pretty
Marsinah with her clear, silvery
voice. Her actions and songs fre
i quently lacked motivation, how
ever, although this is more for
! givable in a musical than in other
types of productions.
The Caliph, played by Lew
Parker, was, for the most part,
I unconvincing as far as character
| ization goes. However, the role
itself offers little in this respect,
' and Parker's voice was certainly
j equal to the musical demands.
As the seductive Lalume, Judy
I Waterman's sparkle wasn't only
in her headress. With a wink and
a bump-and-grind, Lalume was
[certainly entertaining, although a
j more subtle touch would have
! added to the characterization.
Detached Solids
The 32-member orchestra, un
der the direction of David Wil
liams, played with taste and only
overshadowed the voices in one or
I two instances.
The chorus sounded good as
| well and did a good job of getting
, the words across to the audience.
The production, while adequate
ly directed, could have been more
effectively staged. Many of the
songs seemed to have little con
i nection with the rest of the show,
and I got tired of seeing the leads
, come to the center of the down
, stage area for the obvious pur*
: pose of singing the next song.
Unfortunately, the stage set
tings didn't measure up to the
over-all polish of the rest of the
I production.
The silvery curtain made of
hula-hoops, however, was ex
tremely effective, as was Bob Le
vin's lighting.
"Kismet" continues tonight and
tomorrow night at 8:30 in Memo
rial Auditorium.

Wednesday night in Memorial Auditorium.
Everett Nygaard played the poet Hajj with a twinkle in his eye and such contagious zest that the
stage was greatly enlivened whenever he appeared.
Nygaard's familiarity with the role, along with his sense of timing for comedy and well-developed
voice, created a polished characterization that never lagged or failed to entertain. "Gesticulate" showed
him at his best.
As the Wazir of Police, Doug Johnson was equally outstanding. An excellent comic with remark
able facial expression. Johnson played the part with an earnestness that brought out fully the humor
in the role. His "Was 1 Wazir?" was one of the highlights of the production.
