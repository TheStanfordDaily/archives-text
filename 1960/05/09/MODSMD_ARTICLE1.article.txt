# Cal Ex Com Suspension Considered
## 
### 
A member of the University of
California stud en I Executive
Committee has requested the Ju
dicial Committee, another student
organization, to put an injunction
on the ExCom.
This was (lie latest develop
ment in the incident started by
the letter the ExCom sent May
3 lo the University of Illinois,
censuring them for the dismissal
of biology professor Leo Koch.
Koch was fired by the Illinois
administration for advocating pre
marital sex relations between ma
ture students.
Via Air Mail
Vice - Chancellor of Cal Alex
Sherriffs told student body presi
dent Dave Armor not to mail the
letter. Armor replied that the let
ter was already in the mail.
Glenn T. Seaborg, chancellor at
Berkeley, sent a strongly worded
letter to the ExCom last Wednes
day. He said the Koch resolution
exceeded the authority of the
ASUC (the students' association)
and must be rescinded.
The ASUC, he pointed out. does
not have the power to speak in
the name of the entire student
body with reference to off-campus
issues.
ExCom refused to rescind the
motion. Thur s d a y Sherriffs
charged the committee with be
ing "irresponsible" and said "dras
tis changes" in student govern
ment might occur unless the let
tor is rescinded.
Puppets?
Committee members said they
resented what they termed an
attempt at coercion. Armor made
a statement saying that ExCom
must not rescind the motion un
less they want to become "pup
uets of the administration."
The Judicial Com has the power
to suspend ExCom members from
school, remove them from office
or subject them to other discipli
nary action such as work hours.
In sending the letter, the Ex
Com violated the Kerr Directives,
which state that Ex Corns on
University of California campi
may not take stands on "off-cam
pus issues," this term being in
terpreted by the Chancellor of
each campus.
