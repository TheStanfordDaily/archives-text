# Russ Papers Tells Spy Plane Details
## Farm Family Makes Capture; ‘K’ Says Pilot May Be Tried 
### 
MOSCOW (/P) Soviet newspapers poured out fresh details yester
day on the capture of pilot Francis G. Powers and ribbed the United
States in cartoons for the failure of his acknowledged intelligence
flight over Soviet territory.
"Take-off and landing" was the title of a Pravda drawing on the
case of the 30-year-old American flier whose high altitude Lockheed

U2 jet was downed by a rocket as
it sped above the Urals a week
ago.
The U.S. State Department ad
mitted Saturday night the jet was
on an intelligence flight, but said
it was not authorized by authori
ties in Washington.
Pentagon Satire
The Communist Party newspa
per cartoon showed a pilot in two
situations: First, flying out with
a Pentagon helmet topped by a
dollar sign flag, then shaking un
der guard of Soviet soldiers at a
table loaded with a movie camera,
packets of money, a dagger and
watches confiscated from him.
Soviet readers were given other
cartoons and first person stories
of the May Day capture of Pow
ers, announced by Premier Nikita
Khrushchev Saturday along with
a report that Powers has con
fessed he was on a spying mis
sion.
Khrushchev, who is to meet
with Western Big Three chiefs in
the Paris summit conference a
week from today, indicated Pow
ers will be tried. He also said it
might be well to hold a news con
ference on the case.
Workers Capture
Workers on a state farm near
Sverdlovsk, in the central Urals
900 miles east of Moscow, were
reported to have made the cap
ture. Soviet newspapers said they
rushed to Powers' aid when he
parachuted from his falling plane,
but turned him over to officers
when suspicions were aroused by
his equipment.
That equipment, by Soviet ac
count. included a silencer pistol,
a dagger, a Russian map, Soviet
and foreign money, gold watches
and women's gold rings. Powers
also was reported carrying a sur
vival kit containing extra cloth
ing, a fishing net, pliers and a
saw-edged knife.
"Our suspicions were more and
more confirmed," said Vladimir
Surin. "An enemy was in front of
us, an enemy cunning and impu
dent."
The Surin family was getting

ready for the May Day holiday
! feast when an explosion sounded,
j Surin believed it might be a holi
day rocket, but a column of dust
I arose from a field.
While Surin was watching that,
a fi'iend, Leonid Chuzhakin, drove
up. Chuzhakin, a former sailor,
saw a parachute coming down.
Wire Danger
The drop was toward a pine
forest crossed by electric wire,
j Feeling the jumper was in danger
! from the wires, the two rushed
1 toward the spot. The j umpe r
landed on his back.
"We rushed over to him with
I only one thought in mind, to help
I him," Surin said. Others came up
i and helped remove his gloves,
j helmet and oxygen mask. Then
: they noticed the pilot had a gun.
The party took him to a car
| to drive to the state farm office
and, as they were seating him,
: saw a knife in his flying suit
pocket and removed it.
"We surrounded him just in
case," Surin said. "What if he
| tried to do something to himself?
