# Bears Edge Indians in Big Meet
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
Sparkling come-through per
formances by Norm Lloyd in the
mile. Harlan Limmer in the discus
and John Nourse in the low hur
dles couldn't offset California's
taking the first two places in the
two-mile, and Stanford lost its
fourth straight Big Meet in the
Stadium Saturday.
The final tally was 72Va-58% in
favor of the Bears.
Stanford needed a second place
in the two-mile to take the meet
to tho relay and for a while it
looked as though either Lloyd or
John Northway might get it.
However, the strain of winning
the mile told on Lloyd midway
through the seventh lap and he
fell out of the running. Then
Cal's Karl Uebel caught North
way with half a lao to go and
Northway couldn't summon the
speed to catch him.
Cal's Alan Gay lord won the
event in 9:22.4 with Uebel second
and Northway third.
Stanford then lost the relay,
but if that event had meant the
meet one or two changes in the
line-up could possibly have given
the Tribe the win.
Lloyd beat Cal's Jerry Siebert
in the mile in the most stirring
finish of the afternoon. Indian
Bob Monzingo led the race for
three laps and then both Siebert
and Lloyd passed him and stretch
ed out to a 15-yard lead in the
final back stretch.
Siebert led around the turn, but
about ."iO yards from the finish
line. Lloyd came zooming past
him with a finishing kick that
left the Cal man in the dust.
Lloyd's time was 4:16.9 with Sic-
Bert second at 4:17.2. Monzingo
finished third in 4:21.2.
Limmer came through to take
second in the discus with a toss
of 153-5, nearly 10 feet better than

the event for the Tribe at 156-9' a
and Cal's Jerry Nordtrom was
third at 149-5 1 a.
Nourse took second in the lows
with a time of 24.2, four-tenths
of a second better than his all
time best. Willie White, who ear
lier had won the 100 and the 220,
was an added starter in this one
hoping to give the Bears enough
points to wind up the meet eajly,
but pulled up with a muscle
cramp. Cebron Russ won the
event for Cal in 24.0 and Stan
ford's Dean Smith took third.
Nourse also took second behind
Russ in the highs with an all-time
best of 15.0. Russ had an identical
winning time.

Jerry Winters cracked the Big
Meet and Stanford record in the
shotput with a heave of 58-B , i.
The record breaking toss came on
Winter's first competitive throw
of the afternon. Just for good
measure he broke both records
again on his third throw of 57-5.
A telegram was quickly dis
patched to the publisher of the
Los Angeles Times, Otis Chandler,
telling him that his school record
in the shotput, which had stood
since 1949, was no more. Chand
ler's wark was 52-4 ;! s.
Dave Maggard took second for
Cal in the shot at .">."5-2 and Bob
Atkinson came through with his
all-time best, 52-7 1 2, to take third.
Ernie Cunliffe lost his duel with
the world record in the half-mile,
but set a new Stadium and Meet
record with a time of 1:48.5.
Cunliffe's 800 meter time was
1:47.7, the fastest mark in the
world this year.
John Kelly came through with
his best broad jump of the sea
son with 24-7. Kelly fouled on his
first three jumps, but won Ihe
event with his last leap. Cebron
Russ was second for the Bears
with 23-10.
Eurael Bell won the high jump
for Cal at 6-6's. He just missed
at 6-7. barely knocking off the
bar on his last two jumps.
Art Batchelder won*the javelin
for the Cards with a throw of
218-8 1 and Tom Colton pole
vaulted 14-0 for the Bears to win
that event.

A telegram was quickly dis
patched to the publisher of the
Los Angeles Times, Otis Chandler,
telling him that his school record

Sparkling come-through per
formances by Norm Lloyd in the
mile. Harlan Limmer in the discus
and John Nourse in the low hur
dles couldn't offset California's
taking the first two places in the
two-mile, and Stanford lost its
fourth straight Big Meet in the
Stadium Saturday.
The final tally was 72Va-58% in
favor of the Bears.
Stanford needed a second place
in the two-mile to take the meet
to tho relay and for a while it
looked as though either Lloyd or
John Northway might get it.
However, the strain of winning
the mile told on Lloyd midway
through the seventh lap and he
fell out of the running. Then
Cal's Karl Uebel caught North
way with half a lao to go and
Northway couldn't summon the
speed to catch him.
Cal's Alan Gay lord won the
event in 9:22.4 with Uebel second
and Northway third.
Stanford then lost the relay,
but if that event had meant the
meet one or two changes in the
line-up could possibly have given
the Tribe the win.
Lloyd beat Cal's Jerry Siebert
in the mile in the most stirring
finish of the afternoon. Indian
Bob Monzingo led the race for
three laps and then both Siebert
and Lloyd passed him and stretch
ed out to a 15-yard lead in the
final back stretch.
Siebert led around the turn, but
about ."iO yards from the finish
line. Lloyd came zooming past
him with a finishing kick that
left the Cal man in the dust.
Lloyd's time was 4:16.9 with Sic-
Bert second at 4:17.2. Monzingo
finished third in 4:21.2.
