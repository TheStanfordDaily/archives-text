# Bears Edge Indians in Big Meet

Sparkling come-through per
formances by Norm Lloyd in the
mile. Harlan Limmer in the discus
and John Nourse in the low hur

final back stretch.
Siebert led around the turn, but
about ."iO yards from the finish
line. Lloyd came zooming past
him with a finishing kick that
left the Cal man in the dust.
Lloyd's time was 4:16.9 with Sic-
