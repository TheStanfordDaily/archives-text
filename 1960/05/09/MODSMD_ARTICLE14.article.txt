# The
						American Shame

### 
The embarrassment which undouhtcdlv pervades offleial Wash
ington today must he surpassed only bv the shame of the Ameri
can people.
After first disclaiming any knowledge of the plane which was
shot down in Russia on May I, the State Department has made a
statement that, although no authorization existed for the flight,
the plane was "probably" an unarmed U-2 jet piloted by an Ameri
can civilian.
Furthermore, claims \\ ashington. the United Stales is cer
tainly justified in carrying on such intelligence methods, since
Russia is also spying on this country and has refused to accept
the "Open Skies" proposal.
It is impossible to believe that this plane and others in the
past have flown over Russia without authorization from Washing
ton.
It is deplorable that the United States should try to justify its
action by pointing to the methods which the Russians use.
The American people believe that their system of democracy
is better and stronger than (loin monism. \\ hv, then, if we do not
imitate the Russian government in other matters, do we follow
their example in spying and stoop to methods which are repug
nant and unnecessary ?
Each American should feel ashamed of his country for using
these methods. But this shame will not calm the disdain and
derision other countries will heap on the United States, which
supposedly has led the Western world in the search for peace.
In a few short davs, President Kisenhower must go to the
summit to work for peaceful coexistence. It will be a difficult task
for him to convince Khrushchev and the rest of the world that
America desires peace, when we surround Russia with nuclear
bases and conduct aerial spying to pinpoint bombing targets.
The American people would not tolerate Russian bases in
Cuba, Mexico, or Canada. Nor would they remain quiet if Rus
sian planes were to he shot down over United States territory
while photographing suitable places to drop H-Rombs.
If the United States is to recover from this devastating blow
to its moral integrity, it must show Russia and the rest of the
world that it trulv wants peace, a desire which looks false to many
in light of our aggressive tactics.
