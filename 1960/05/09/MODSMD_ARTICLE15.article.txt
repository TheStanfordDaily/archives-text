# ‘Magician’ Confusing But Worthwhile Film
## 
### Alan Rosenthal 
The trouble with seeing too
much Bergman is that one soon
begins to suffer from intellectual
diarrhea. "The Magician," at the
Vogue Theatre, San Francisco,
only helps further this opinion.
The questions of Bergman's
earlier films are repeated. What
is the meaning of life, death, illu
sion. reality? This time the set
ting for the discussion is the out
skirts of mid-nineteenth century
Stockholm.
A fleeing magical conjuring
troupe which specializes in mes
merism is forced to spend the
night at the home of the local con
sul. To see whether the show is
fit for the public they are forced
to put on a demonstration per
formance on the following day for
the consul, a cynical doctor and
the skeptical police chief.
Each member of the troupe
finds a different way to spend
the night. For the magician it is
one of doubt and questioning, for
the witch grandmother it is a
night of spells, for the servants
a night of seduction.
The resolution takes place in a
strange blend of horror and hu
mor. the macabre and the farci
cal. The magician is finally prov
en a charlatan. Yet he is? Be
cause of him things will never be
quite the same again for the con

stil's wife, the doctor or the po- j
lice chief.
As usual iho acting is brilliant'
with Max von Sydow as tho ma- i
gician and Ingrid Thurlin as his
disguised wife. This combined '
withGunnar Fischer's tremendous ;
photography is something we
have now come to accept as our j
due of Bergman. Subject to a
diet of nauseating rubbish for so |
long from the American industrial I
movie makers, we have almost
forgotten what acting and the po
etic image can do for the screen.
Bui though the technique was
excellent this was too repetetive
of what Bergman has given us he- I
fore. The forest glades step out
of "The Seventh Seal" and these- i
duct ions from "Smiles of a Sum-i
mer Night."
Essentially it is a picture for j
both eye and mind. The interpre- !
tations given to the Christ-like j
figure of the magician will he
various. I like to conceive of him i
as the artist, part humbug but j
who in his own way can reveal the
meaning of life to others. But ]
everyone will have his own inter
pretation.
"The Magician" is a picture of (
confused moods and images. The
mixture doesn't always come off. :
But above all it is vitally holding !
and compelling and not to be 1
missed by anyone who has an in- '
terest in the cinema above eating
popcorn.

as the artist, part humbug but j

"The Magician" is a picture of (
confused moods and images. The
mixture doesn't always come off. :
But above all it is vitally holding !
and compelling and not to be 1
missed by anyone who has an in- '
terest in the cinema above eating
popcorn.
The trouble with seeing too
much Bergman is that one soon
begins to suffer from intellectual
diarrhea. "The Magician," at the
Vogue Theatre, San Francisco,
only helps further this opinion.
The questions of Bergman's
earlier films are repeated. What
is the meaning of life, death, illu
sion. reality? This time the set
ting for the discussion is the out
skirts of mid-nineteenth century
Stockholm.
A fleeing magical conjuring
troupe which specializes in mes
merism is forced to spend the
night at the home of the local con
sul. To see whether the show is
fit for the public they are forced
to put on a demonstration per
formance on the following day for
the consul, a cynical doctor and
the skeptical police chief.
Each member of the troupe
finds a different way to spend
the night. For the magician it is
one of doubt and questioning, for
the witch grandmother it is a
night of spells, for the servants
a night of seduction.
The resolution takes place in a
strange blend of horror and hu
mor. the macabre and the farci
cal. The magician is finally prov
en a charlatan. Yet he is? Be
cause of him things will never be
quite the same again for the con

stil's wife, the doctor or the po- j
lice chief.
As usual iho acting is brilliant'
with Max von Sydow as tho ma- i
gician and Ingrid Thurlin as his
disguised wife. This combined '
withGunnar Fischer's tremendous ;
photography is something we
have now come to accept as our j
due of Bergman. Subject to a
diet of nauseating rubbish for so |
long from the American industrial I
movie makers, we have almost
forgotten what acting and the po
etic image can do for the screen.
Bui though the technique was
excellent this was too repetetive
of what Bergman has given us he- I
fore. The forest glades step out
of "The Seventh Seal" and these- i
duct ions from "Smiles of a Sum-i
mer Night."
Essentially it is a picture for j
both eye and mind. The interpre- !
tations given to the Christ-like j
figure of the magician will he
