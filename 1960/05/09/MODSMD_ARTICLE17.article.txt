# UNRESOLVED IMPASSE
## Strategists Have Perverted Outlook on Peace Planning 
### Joel Meister IIR Political Analyst 
Editor's Note: This is the last
of a serifs of articles on current
strategic planning.

I Despite its distasteful nature.
1 the grand strategy of today seems
necessary if we are to maintain
bargaining power vis-a-vis the So
viet Union.
Yet the current impasse is most
Unlikely to be resolved, at least
I militarily. We are attempting to
, maintain first-strike capabilities,
retaliatory capabilities, attack-ab
| sorbing capabilities, recuperation
I capabilities and so on. We are
! planning in 19G0 for the technol
ogy of 1975. The U.S.S.R. is doing
j the same.
What, then, leads us to make
assumptions that wc are ap
proaching peace through strength;
that the impasse will be resolved?
The strategists maintain that,
until political agreements can be
reached for arms control and in
spection, peace must be maintain
ed by military deterrence. There
fore, military planning is actually
peace planning.
Perverted Planning
Unfortunately, ihis is a most
perverted kind of peace planning,
for as weaponry and warning sys
tems become more sophisticated,
the negotiations for control and
inspection become that much less
hopeful.
International disarmament ne
gotiations were initiated within
the United Nations structure 14
years ago. The current meetings
in Geneva have just adjourned for
the summit. But what little pro
gress has been made is constantly
endangered by further military
advances in technology.
If we admit the current neces
sity of deterrent strength and de
velopment in anticipation of the
U.S.S.R., then we must, if we also
seek peace, have agencies equally
blessed with talent and funds to
develop programs and systems for
nuclear test monitoring, for in
spection and control of arma
ments, for limited war situations,
for economic restructuring in
event of disarmament and for
general consideration of the rami
fications of a shift away from
great dependence on the military.
Little of the Positive
There is little of this positive
planning in the government cur
rently. There is a delegation at
the negotiations in Geneva. With
in the State Department is the of
fice of the Special Assistant for
Arms Limitation, with about 20
members. The Department of
Defense has an Office for Inter
national Security Affairs, staffed
primarily by part-time experts
from the three services.
The President's Joint Disarma
ment Study is a temporary group
consisting of 18 people and a
small group of consultants. As
sisting thorn is Dr. George Kistia
kowsky, the Special Assistant to
the President for Science and
Technology.
This effort to evolve a so-called
peace technology is a badly frag
mented one. Communication and
co-ordination undoubtedly are
lacking between the groups in
State. Defense and the executive
branch. One can only surmise the
cognizance given these groups by
the National Aeronautics and

Space Administration, I ho Atomic
Energy Commission, the armed
services and the Central Intelli
gence Agency.
What seems lacking at this time
is direction from the President.
To state that war is preposterous
is not enough. A re-orientation of
emphasis from the possibility of
war to the possibility of peace is
needed. And as long as we sup
port the grand strategists, let us
make it clear to thorn that they
follow national policy and do not
load it.

peace planning.
Perverted Planning
Unfortunately, ihis is a most
perverted kind of peace planning,
for as weaponry and warning sys
tems become more sophisticated,
the negotiations for control and
inspection become that much less
hopeful.
International disarmament ne
gotiations were initiated within
the United Nations structure 14
years ago. The current meetings
in Geneva have just adjourned for
the summit. But what little pro
gress has been made is constantly
endangered by further military
advances in technology.
If we admit the current neces
sity of deterrent strength and de
velopment in anticipation of the
U.S.S.R., then we must, if we also
seek peace, have agencies equally
blessed with talent and funds to
develop programs and systems for
nuclear test monitoring, for in
spection and control of arma
ments, for limited war situations,
for economic restructuring in
event of disarmament and for
general consideration of the rami
fications of a shift away from
great dependence on the military.
Little of the Positive
There is little of this positive
planning in the government cur
rently. There is a delegation at
the negotiations in Geneva. With
in the State Department is the of
fice of the Special Assistant for
Arms Limitation, with about 20
members. The Department of
Defense has an Office for Inter
national Security Affairs, staffed
primarily by part-time experts
from the three services.
The President's Joint Disarma
ment Study is a temporary group
consisting of 18 people and a
small group of consultants. As
sisting thorn is Dr. George Kistia
kowsky, the Special Assistant to
the President for Science and
Technology.
This effort to evolve a so-called
peace technology is a badly frag
mented one. Communication and
co-ordination undoubtedly are
lacking between the groups in
State. Defense and the executive
branch. One can only surmise the
cognizance given these groups by
the National Aeronautics and

Space Administration, I ho Atomic
Energy Commission, the armed
services and the Central Intelli
gence Agency.
What seems lacking at this time
is direction from the President.
To state that war is preposterous
is not enough. A re-orientation of
emphasis from the possibility of
war to the possibility of peace is
needed. And as long as we sup
port the grand strategists, let us
make it clear to thorn that they
follow national policy and do not
load it.
