Not Foolproof
Editor, The Daily:
The current thinking about
armaments and war is another
instance of our general ability to
equal our stupidity by our ra
t ionali/ation.
The thinking, in outline, runs
thus: We must prepare ourselves
for war with the most destruc
tive force conceivable. If hydro
gen bombs are. not totally de
structive, we must supplement
them with biological attacks on
crops and animals, in addition to
the most lethal chemical warfare
that human ingenuity can con
trive.
These are ihe ARC's of future
war. By the time the ABC is
applied, human life on this earth,
and the state of society, would
be hard to conceive, even with
the wildest science-fiction imagi
nation. But, since both sides know
these ground rules, there will be
no war, since no side desires to
commit suicide.
Thus the more destructive our
weapons become, the safer we
are from war. The argument is
pr o c i se, logical and foolproof.
That's all very well, except for
one very small matter: human
action is not always exactly pre
cise, logical and, least of all,
foolproof.

Good and Hard
Editor, The Daily:
Thank you for your touching
devotion to "democratic institu
tions." Thank heaven that, though
free and responsible citizens be
not found, their institutions re
main (to servo whatever purposes
they will).
In this connection, especially as
regards postwar Franco, a quote
from H. L. Mencken may be par
ticularly apt. "Democracy is the
theory that the common man
knows what he wants and do
serves to got it- good and hard."
