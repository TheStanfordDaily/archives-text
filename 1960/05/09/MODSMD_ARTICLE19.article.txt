Editor's Note: During the last
week of \V'inter Quarter Alan
Kalin, llli President, and Richard
SiiiHleen, ASSU President, attend
ed the Second Annual Air Force
Assembly at the Air Force Acade
: my. The following is a report by
the two of this conference.
The topic of this year's Air
Force Assembly was "The Repre
sentation of the United States
Abroad." Delegates from 34 col
logos and universities of the west- i
ern states, plus the three major
| service academies, attended the
: four-day conference. The Assem
bly approached the topic from
j five directions economic, infor
mation and cultural, military, J
■ multilateral organizations, coordi
nation overseas, and coordination
in Washington.
In the post-World War II nu
clear ago, the United States has
assumed a position of social, eco
nomic, and political leadership for
the free world. In this same era,
the Soviet Union has come forth
I to challenge our position of lead
ership. The prize in I his groat
rivalry is the support of groat
numbers of people in the economi
cally and politically emerging na
: lions of the world.
United States representation
abroad is an essential factor in
projecting the image of America.
By association, one A m e r i c a n
tends to represent all Americans.
Therefore, it behooves each of lis
j to strive to understand the prob
lems of our own country as well
as those that confront the coun
tries to which we may someday
be representatives — whether in
public or private endeavors, at
home or abroad.
Indeed, we must extend our-j
i selves be y on d understanding i
other countries, and apply certain
principles in our dealings with
them. Wo cannot expect countries
with lesser degrees of technologi-
I cal development or different cul-
I tures to accept our standards or
way of life. Rather, we must learn
1 to assist them and work with
| them within their own frame
work.
1. Education: Those people who
may come in contact with peoples i
I of countries — whether on
an ambassadorial, business, or
personal level should bo edu
cated as to the techniques of in
ternational relations, as well as <
to the peculiar problems facing!
the various nations today.
2. Devotion: Those personsl
who represent the United States I
in some official capacity must be
those with a true devotion to our
ideals and purposes. This dedica- j
tion was called for by General 1

Norstad in the keynote address
on the opening evening of the
Assembly.
3. Coordination: To date, our
many activities abroad have boon
without any unifying administra
tion. At home, the supreme co
ordinator should be the Depart
ment of State, and abroad, this
power should go to the ambas
sadors in their respective coun
tries. The overall responsibility
of our representation, of course,
lies with the President. Further,
it is hoped that private institu
tions will attempt to coordinate
their efforts with those of the
government.
Underlying all of the discus
sions at the Assembly was the
recognition that the imago of
America that wo present to for
eign nations must bo a favorable
one. This is not to say that we
should attempt to obscure the

I
unfavorable aspects of our soci
ety. Instead, we must acknowl
edge and explain their existence
and, hopefully, mitigate them
| with more favorable impressions.
Neither programs nor person
nel, however, can be expected to
improve without a clear defini
tion of our national goals and
rectification of short term ap
proaches to the lasting problems
of our age, and an increased na
tional effort is necessary to mar
shall the understanding, appreci
ation and support for our position
in the world community.

United States representation
abroad is an essential factor in
projecting the image of America.
By association, one A m e r i c a n
tends to represent all Americans.
Therefore, it behooves each of lis
j to strive to understand the prob
lems of our own country as well
as those that confront the coun
tries to which we may someday
be representatives — whether in
public or private endeavors, at
home or abroad.
Indeed, we must extend our-j
i selves be y on d understanding i
other countries, and apply certain
principles in our dealings with
them. Wo cannot expect countries
with lesser degrees of technologi-
I cal development or different cul-
I tures to accept our standards or
way of life. Rather, we must learn
1 to assist them and work with
| them within their own frame
work.
1. Education: Those people who
may come in contact with peoples i
I of countries — whether on
an ambassadorial, business, or
personal level should bo edu
cated as to the techniques of in
ternational relations, as well as <
to the peculiar problems facing!
the various nations today.
2. Devotion: Those personsl
who represent the United States I
in some official capacity must be
those with a true devotion to our
ideals and purposes. This dedica- j
tion was called for by General 1

Norstad in the keynote address
on the opening evening of the
Assembly.
3. Coordination: To date, our
many activities abroad have boon
without any unifying administra
tion. At home, the supreme co
ordinator should be the Depart
ment of State, and abroad, this
power should go to the ambas
sadors in their respective coun
tries. The overall responsibility
of our representation, of course,
lies with the President. Further,
it is hoped that private institu
tions will attempt to coordinate
their efforts with those of the
government.
Underlying all of the discus
sions at the Assembly was the
recognition that the imago of
America that wo present to for
eign nations must bo a favorable
one. This is not to say that we
should attempt to obscure the

I
unfavorable aspects of our soci
ety. Instead, we must acknowl
edge and explain their existence
and, hopefully, mitigate them
| with more favorable impressions.
Neither programs nor person
nel, however, can be expected to
improve without a clear defini
tion of our national goals and
rectification of short term ap
proaches to the lasting problems
of our age, and an increased na
tional effort is necessary to mar
shall the understanding, appreci
ation and support for our position
in the world community.
