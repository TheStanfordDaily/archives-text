### 
One of the two con men who
hit Stanford fraternities last week
for $1,097 in orders for non-ex
istent stationery was arrested
over the weekend in the East.
Jim Morris, an ex-employee of
the Columbus Stationery Co., was
picked up by Williamsport, Ind.,
police in the 1960 Chevrolet he
had bought with the money he
pocketed from the orders.
After his arrest, Morris called
Bob D'Allessio, Quad business
manager, to try to explain that
his arrest was all a mistake.
lie claimed the orders would
be filled, but neither Columbus
nor Royal Stationery, for whom
he also worked, is willing to fill
them.
Authorities here did not know
immediately whet h e r Morris
would be extradited on grand
theft charges, as he is wanted
on several counts in the cast.
Morris' companion, also wanted
on grand theft charges, is appar
ently still at large.
All told, 20 Stanford fraterni
ties were hit and losses up to
$220 each were reported. Frater
nities at California and USC also
reported being swindled by the
two men.
