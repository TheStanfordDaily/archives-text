# Indian Linksters Defeated in South
## 
### 
The Stanford golf team found
it harder than usual to put the
ball in the hole this weekend and
suffered a double loss to UCLA
28-26, and USC 43-11.
Playing well in the heart break
er with UCLA were Pete Choate
and Steve Smith, with 69 and 73
respectively. This was not enough,
however, and the Cards lost on
the final hole.
USC. although once beaten by
the Uclans, proved a better team.
Their good golf, coupled with a
bad day for the 1 Tribe, carried the
day.
