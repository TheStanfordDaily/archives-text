## 
### 
Aside from the thrilling one
foot victory by the Indian frosh
crew the Big Race Saturday was
a Cal-dominated event. The Bear
crew swept the varsity and JV
races by considerable margins on
the Redwood City course.
Cal was never threatened in the
three-mile varsity race and led
the Indians across the finish by
about 12 lengths. It was Cal's
third consecutive victory. Cal's
time for the three miles was 15:27
with the Indians turning in a
16:14.
Cal's JV boat won a slightly
shorter race in 14:11.
Stanford's victory in the frosh
race marks the first time this has
happened since 1951. It was by
far the most exciting race of the
day and t ho Stanfrd victory was
not assured until the very finish.
The frosh winning time was 12:14.
