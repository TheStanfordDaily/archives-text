# Tribe Upset by Fired-Up Cal Netmen; First Net Defeat to Bears in Four Years
## 
### John Schwarz 
After a three-year drought, the
■ California tennis leam finally
I caught up with the Stanford Indi
ans and whipped the Cards by <i
lopsided 7-2 score in a match at
Berkeley Saturday. The Bears,
who had lost seven in a row to
the Indians, went out for blood
Saturday and when the match was
over they had drawn enough to
I make a starving vampire come
j up with a case of indigestion.
The Cards, favored to whip the
! Bears in enough singles play to
win the match, found their sup
posed forte their biggest weak
ness. The Bears swept through
live of the six singles matches
and ended the contest right there.
Only George Bates could man

age to gain a singles win for j I
Stanford. All the other Indian |
singles men came up with a ease
of Californiaitis, a • disease well
known to Stanford athletic teams '
the last few years, and could not '
handle the fired-up Bears. 1
The match evened the season 1
series between Cal and Stanford .
at one to one, Stanford having :
defeated the Bears at Palo Alto
earlier. The teams do not play
again this year.
Today the Indians will try to 1
get back in the winner's circle
playing University of British
Columbia, with the only player
coach in college tennis, Paul
Wiley. The match is home and j
begins at 2 p.m.

After a three-year drought, the

I caught up with the Stanford Indi
ans and whipped the Cards by <i
lopsided 7-2 score in a match at
Berkeley Saturday. The Bears,
who had lost seven in a row to
the Indians, went out for blood
Saturday and when the match was
over they had drawn enough to
I make a starving vampire come
j up with a case of indigestion.
The Cards, favored to whip the
! Bears in enough singles play to
win the match, found their sup
posed forte their biggest weak
ness. The Bears swept through
live of the six singles matches
and ended the contest right there.
