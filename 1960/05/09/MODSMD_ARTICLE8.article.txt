LONDON (A J ) West Euro
pean officials appeared deeply
disturbed yeslcrday by Nikita
Khrushchev's success in exposing
Ihe intelligence activities of a
U.S. jet plane over the Soviel
Union.
There were widespread fears
that the American position in tlie
Paris summit conference next
week has been badly weakened.
Allied officials privately ex
pressed the view that President
Eisenhower could hardly sit down
with the Soviet Premier at the
conference table in more embar
rassing ci rcumst ances.
Allies Deny Knowledge
Two allies of the United Stales
Norway and Pakistan -denied
knowledge of any American use
of their territory for Francis G.
Powers' flight over the U.S.S.R
last Sunday.
Khrushchev said the flight,
halted by a Soviet rocket, was
launched from the Pakistani city
of Peshawar and that the landing
was to have been made at Bodo,
a northern Norwegian air base.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman
in Karachi, Pakistani's capital,
said official inquiries showed no
such plane had been in Peshawar.
Khrushchev's claim that Powers'
Lockheed U2 had been at Pesha
war three days was declared to
be "without any foundation."
Pakistan May Protest
Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Moha m m e d Ikramullah said
about the same time that if the
allegation was true Pakistan
would "lodge a strong protest
with the government of the Unit
ed States to insure that such a
thing does not happen again."
In Oslo, Norway's Foreign Min
istry repeated a denial of any
knowledge of the alleged Bodo
landing plan.
U.S. Air Force officials in Tur
key, where Powers operated from
a base at Adana, declined com
ment on the State Department's
admission that he was seeking
information.
The heat may be on Adana offi
cers in view of the State Depart

was not authorized by authorities
in Washington.
