## 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
The House Committee on Un-
American Activities, due to open
hearings in San Francisco Thurs
day, was condemned Friday by
Frank Wilkinson, the Executive
Secretary of the Citizen's Com
mittee to Preserve American
Freedoms.
He asked for the creation of a
climate of opinion in which a
minimum number of people will
lose their jobs as. a result of being
subpoenaed by or standing on
Constitutional rights in the face
of the Committee.
Wilkinson, secretary of the
committee which was founded in
Los Angeles in 1952 to work for
the abolition of the Committee,
spoke before a group of about 75
people in Kepler's Bookstore Fri
day evening.
Wilkinson pvtt the Constitu
tional question this way: if Con
gress cannot, under the First
Amendment, abridge free speech,
then Congress has no right to in
vestigate for the passage of this
kind of legislation.
Propaganda Acts
The mandate of the Committee
is for the investigation of un-
American propaganda acts.
Wilkinson quoted Chief Justice
Earl Warren, who in the Watkins
decision of 1957 asked. "Who can
define the meaning of 'un-Ameri
can'?" and Representative James
Roosevelt, who on April 25 called
for the abolition of the Committee
on the floor of the House.
Roosevelt said that propaganda
activity can only be concerned
with speech, writing and assem
bly. and not with overt acts, trea
son and espionage.
There was no report of the
Roosevelt speech in the Bay Area.
Wilkinson mentioned,

Forty-eight people have been
served with subpoenas by the
Committee, will hold hearings in
the City Hall Thursday, Friday
and Saturday.
Of these, 10 are teachers who
were called last summer when the
Committee was to appear in San
Francisco. That hearing was can
celled because of pressure
throughout the state by union,
church and academic leaders.
Last year, 110 teachers were
subpoenaed. Wilkinson pointed
out that only those whose Boards
of Education had upheld their
rights and retained their contracts
have been called for this session
and that those who have been de
nied teaching jobs were not
called.
Contract Deadline
The deadline on contract re
newals for teachers in May 15.
Wilkinson commented that this
point was not missed by the Com
mittee in scheduling its hearings
for May 12.
The other teachers do not know
why they were called, except that
they have picketed dime store
chains which discriminate against
Negroes in their Southern stores.
The House Committee on Un-
American Activities was estab
lished in 1938 under a mandate
which was originally •set up to
investigate Nazis.
In the 21 years it has been in
operation it has subpoenaed over
3,500 people, a large number of
whom have lost their jobs and
suffered a great deal of other
damage.
Wilkinson himself was taken
from a Los Angeles slum clear
ance project which he had been
working on for 18 years.
First Seven Years
The Committee was a tempo
rary one for the first seven years
of its existence, and during the

war it almost died out completely, j
Wilkinson noted Franklin D.
Roosevelt called lor its abolition
before he died.
Wilkinson said t hat in 1943
Mississippi Representative Ran-j
kin asked to have tho Committee
made permanent. By a show of
hands, the Committee was actu
ally abolished by a vote of 185-140, |
Wilkinson said.
Rankin, however, asked for a
roll call vote, and while it was
being taken, made an anti-Semitic, |
anti-liberal. anti-CIO speech on
the floor of the House, to which
Representative Lehman objected.
Rankin replied that that was
what "one could expect from a
Jewish gentleman."
Rankin called for a showdown,
and the Committee was made per
manent by a vote of 206-190.
Wilkinson noted that among
those who voted against the Com
mittee was Francis E. Walter, j
now its chairman.
liCjfal ('hullengc
The first legal challenge to the
Committee came in 1917 with the
indictment of the Hollywood Ten,
10 members of the film industry I
who used the First Amendment
in their refusal to answer the
Committee's questions. The case
rlid not reach the Supreme Court
and the men went to jail.
It was then, Wilkinson said, j
that fear started spreading and
people started using the Fifth
Amendment.
Wilkinson is part of a group of
.36 people who have been sub
poenaed and who are challenging I
theCommiltee on infringement of
First Amendment rights.
The group includes professors
at V'assar and Michigan, a white
integrationist and a fellow at the'
Princeton Institute of Advanced
Studies. All the cases are now
pending in the courts.

The other teachers do not know
why they were called, except that
they have picketed dime store
chains which discriminate against
Negroes in their Southern stores.
The House Committee on Un-
American Activities was estab
lished in 1938 under a mandate
which was originally •set up to
investigate Nazis.
In the 21 years it has been in
operation it has subpoenaed over
3,500 people, a large number of
whom have lost their jobs and
suffered a great deal of other
damage.
Wilkinson himself was taken
from a Los Angeles slum clear
ance project which he had been
working on for 18 years.
First Seven Years
The Committee was a tempo
rary one for the first seven years
of its existence, and during the

war it almost died out completely, j
Wilkinson noted Franklin D.
Roosevelt called lor its abolition
before he died.
Wilkinson said t hat in 1943
Mississippi Representative Ran-j
kin asked to have tho Committee
made permanent. By a show of
hands, the Committee was actu
ally abolished by a vote of 185-140, |
Wilkinson said.
Rankin, however, asked for a
roll call vote, and while it was
being taken, made an anti-Semitic, |
anti-liberal. anti-CIO speech on
the floor of the House, to which
Representative Lehman objected.
Rankin replied that that was
what "one could expect from a
Jewish gentleman."
Rankin called for a showdown,
and the Committee was made per
manent by a vote of 206-190.
Wilkinson noted that among
those who voted against the Com
mittee was Francis E. Walter, j
now its chairman.

The first legal challenge to the
Committee came in 1917 with the
indictment of the Hollywood Ten,
10 members of the film industry I
who used the First Amendment
in their refusal to answer the
Committee's questions. The case
rlid not reach the Supreme Court
and the men went to jail.
It was then, Wilkinson said, j
that fear started spreading and
people started using the Fifth
Amendment.
Wilkinson is part of a group of
.36 people who have been sub
poenaed and who are challenging I
theCommiltee on infringement of
First Amendment rights.
The group includes professors
at V'assar and Michigan, a white
integrationist and a fellow at the'

The House Committee on Un-
American Activities, due to open
hearings in San Francisco Thurs
day, was condemned Friday by
Frank Wilkinson, the Executive
Secretary of the Citizen's Com
mittee to Preserve American
Freedoms.
He asked for the creation of a
climate of opinion in which a
minimum number of people will
lose their jobs as. a result of being
subpoenaed by or standing on
Constitutional rights in the face
of the Committee.
Wilkinson, secretary of the
committee which was founded in
Los Angeles in 1952 to work for
the abolition of the Committee,
spoke before a group of about 75
people in Kepler's Bookstore Fri
day evening.
Wilkinson pvtt the Constitu
tional question this way: if Con
gress cannot, under the First
Amendment, abridge free speech,
then Congress has no right to in
vestigate for the passage of this
kind of legislation.
Propaganda Acts
The mandate of the Committee
is for the investigation of un-
American propaganda acts.
Wilkinson quoted Chief Justice
Earl Warren, who in the Watkins
decision of 1957 asked. "Who can
define the meaning of 'un-Ameri
can'?" and Representative James
Roosevelt, who on April 25 called
for the abolition of the Committee
on the floor of the House.
Roosevelt said that propaganda
activity can only be concerned
with speech, writing and assem
bly. and not with overt acts, trea
son and espionage.
There was no report of the
Roosevelt speech in the Bay Area.
Wilkinson mentioned,

Forty-eight people have been
served with subpoenas by the
Committee, will hold hearings in
the City Hall Thursday, Friday
and Saturday.
Of these, 10 are teachers who
were called last summer when the
Committee was to appear in San
Francisco. That hearing was can
celled because of pressure
throughout the state by union,
church and academic leaders.
Last year, 110 teachers were
subpoenaed. Wilkinson pointed
out that only those whose Boards
of Education had upheld their
rights and retained their contracts
have been called for this session
and that those who have been de
nied teaching jobs were not
called.

The House Committee on Un-
American Activities, due to open
hearings in San Francisco Thurs
day, was condemned Friday by
Frank Wilkinson, the Executive
Secretary of the Citizen's Com
mittee to Preserve American
Freedoms.
He asked for the creation of a
climate of opinion in which a
minimum number of people will
lose their jobs as. a result of being
subpoenaed by or standing on
Constitutional rights in the face
of the Committee.
Wilkinson, secretary of the
committee which was founded in
Los Angeles in 1952 to work for
the abolition of the Committee,
spoke before a group of about 75
people in Kepler's Bookstore Fri
day evening.
Wilkinson pvtt the Constitu
tional question this way: if Con
gress cannot, under the First
Amendment, abridge free speech,
then Congress has no right to in
vestigate for the passage of this
kind of legislation.
Propaganda Acts
The mandate of the Committee
is for the investigation of un-
American propaganda acts.
Wilkinson quoted Chief Justice
Earl Warren, who in the Watkins
decision of 1957 asked. "Who can
define the meaning of 'un-Ameri
can'?" and Representative James
Roosevelt, who on April 25 called
for the abolition of the Committee
on the floor of the House.
Roosevelt said that propaganda
activity can only be concerned
with speech, writing and assem
bly. and not with overt acts, trea
son and espionage.
There was no report of the
Roosevelt speech in the Bay Area.
Wilkinson mentioned,

Forty-eight people have been
served with subpoenas by the
Committee, will hold hearings in
the City Hall Thursday, Friday
and Saturday.
Of these, 10 are teachers who
were called last summer when the
Committee was to appear in San
Francisco. That hearing was can
celled because of pressure
throughout the state by union,
church and academic leaders.
Last year, 110 teachers were
subpoenaed. Wilkinson pointed
out that only those whose Boards
of Education had upheld their
rights and retained their contracts
have been called for this session
and that those who have been de
nied teaching jobs were not
called.
Contract Deadline
The deadline on contract re
newals for teachers in May 15.
Wilkinson commented that this
point was not missed by the Com
mittee in scheduling its hearings
for May 12.
The other teachers do not know
why they were called, except that
they have picketed dime store
chains which discriminate against
Negroes in their Southern stores.
The House Committee on Un-
American Activities was estab
lished in 1938 under a mandate
which was originally •set up to
investigate Nazis.
In the 21 years it has been in
operation it has subpoenaed over
3,500 people, a large number of
whom have lost their jobs and
suffered a great deal of other
damage.
Wilkinson himself was taken
from a Los Angeles slum clear
ance project which he had been
working on for 18 years.
First Seven Years
The Committee was a tempo
rary one for the first seven years
of its existence, and during the

war it almost died out completely, j
Wilkinson noted Franklin D.
Roosevelt called lor its abolition
before he died.
Wilkinson said t hat in 1943
Mississippi Representative Ran-j
kin asked to have tho Committee
made permanent. By a show of
hands, the Committee was actu
ally abolished by a vote of 185-140, |
Wilkinson said.
Rankin, however, asked for a
roll call vote, and while it was
being taken, made an anti-Semitic, |
anti-liberal. anti-CIO speech on
the floor of the House, to which
Representative Lehman objected.
Rankin replied that that was
what "one could expect from a
Jewish gentleman."
Rankin called for a showdown,
and the Committee was made per
manent by a vote of 206-190.
Wilkinson noted that among
those who voted against the Com
mittee was Francis E. Walter, j
now its chairman.

The first legal challenge to the
Committee came in 1917 with the
indictment of the Hollywood Ten,
10 members of the film industry I
who used the First Amendment
in their refusal to answer the
Committee's questions. The case
rlid not reach the Supreme Court
and the men went to jail.
It was then, Wilkinson said, j
that fear started spreading and
people started using the Fifth
Amendment.
Wilkinson is part of a group of
.36 people who have been sub
poenaed and who are challenging I
