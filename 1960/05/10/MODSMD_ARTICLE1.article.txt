### Jerry Rankin 
Gross income from last week's Con Home Drive topped the $10,000
mark yesterday and is still climbing, according to Terry Cullinan,
drive treasurer.
With a substantial amount of money still to come in, Cullinan
predicted the drive's final total will lie somewhere "between $10,500
and $11,000." This year's goal was $12,000.

This would make it one of the
most profitable campaigns in the
Con Home's 11 years of existence. I
Gross income thus far is $10,-1
002.84. Expenses incurred are
$,">11.84, Cullinan syid, leaving a|
profit for Con Home at this point
of $9,491.
