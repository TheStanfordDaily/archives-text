When the heads of government I
meet in Paris, each in his own
way and for his own reasons will;
be greatly preoccupied with prob
lems that lie outside of Europe
and are, speaking strictly, outside
the competence of the summit
meeting.
On tho strictly European ques-1
lion, which arises out of the par-1
tit ion of Germany, there is, as I 1
have pointed out in preceding ar- :
tides, a very large degree of tacit '
agreement. The two Germanys
are not to be reunited. Moreover,
what both sides are seeking is a
detente in Europe, a relaxation of 1
tension, which accepts in sub
stance, though not in all the for- 1
mal details, the status quo.
This search for a detente is in
spired, of course, by the realiza
tin that there is no European
question which can now, within
the existing balance of power, be
settled by war or by the threat of
war.
But the search for a detente in !
Europe is inspired also, and in 1
growing measure, by tho need to
conserve energy and attention and
resources for the mounting prob
lems outside of Europe in Asia,
Africa, and in this hemisphere.
None of the great powers is great
enough, is strong enough, and is
rich enough, to continue an inten- j
"sificd struggle for the mastery of j
Europe and also to deal adequate- j
ly with its own interests outside
of Europe.
Let us consider the Soviet Un
ion. Mr. K. and his colleagues may ;
hope, they may even believe, that j
all of Germany will become Com
munist. But they know also that
they cannot use force to impose
Communism on Western Ger
many or on West Berlin without
precipitating the war which they,
just as we in the West, must
avoid.
On the other hand, the Russians
know that they cannot take China
for granted, and if they are to 1
protect their interests and their 1
security in Asia, they must not
use up their resources in a race .
of armaments. They must be able
to face towards Asia with a free
hand, which means without being
tied down by the possibility of war
in Europe.
This is the central reason, in
my view, why they want < r i ban on 1
nuclear testing. Such a ban will I
not only promote a detente in Eu- 1
rope but it will also provide them :
with a decisive reason why they
cannot supply China with the 1
means to become a nuclear power. 1
They have every reason in the <
world, far more reason than we t
have, to wish that China should I
not become a nuclear power. I
This is Ihe reason why the pro
posed treaty is so important. It I
is not that cheating is impossible 1
if the perfect crime is commit ted (
by the Russians. It is important I

I because the primary interest of
the Russians will be to maintain
j the ban in the treaty.
It is evident that the main pre
occupation of France today lies
across the Mediterranean in Al
geria and in French Africa. That
is why a detente in Europe is a
French necessity. The French
army is not in Europe bill in Af
rica, and French interests in Af
rica make it impossible for France
to regard tlie NATO military es
tablishment as of vital importance
to French security.
What is more, if the French
presence in Africa is to be main
tained, metropolitan France will
have to draw heavily on its capital
resources. Therefore, in spite of
the two nuclear explosions in the
Sahara Desert, France cannot af
ford to run in the race of arma
ments.
The Commonwealth conference
now being held in London defines
the question which is becoming
the prime preoccupation of British
foreign policy. It is the question
of how the older nations of the
Commonwealth, which are pre
dominantly white in population
and Western in their culture, are
to live with and lo work with the
new nations of South Asia and
Africa.
If the British Commonwealth
can find the road to to inter-racial
amity, it will be at least as great
a contribution as any of thÂ«> great
contributions which Britain has
made to good government and hu
man liberty. But if there is to be
a race of armaments in Europe,
and if the cold war is to become
increasingly deadly, there will not
be the time, the energy, the wis
dom, the patience, or the re
sources to find the path of con
ciliation.
We, too, had our reasons for
seeking a detente in Europe. We
cannot any longer turn our atten
tion away from this hemisphere.
Moreover, to keep up in the race
of armaments we must spend at
least as much as the President
asks for, and to be safe we prob
ably ought to spenrl more.
In order to do this we have been
faced with a choice. Shall we meet
the public needs of our growing
population and the rapid concen
tration of this population in big
cities? Or shall we let these needs
be inadequately mot while we
raise tho standard of private con
sumption?
In the Eisenhower Administra
tion we have sacrificed public
needs and taken military risks in
order to increase private consump
tion. In the days to come we shall
have to reverse the Eisenhower
priorities.
Like all tho other powers, we
have an acute micros) in a de
tente.
