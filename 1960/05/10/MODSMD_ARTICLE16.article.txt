American Shame
Editor, the Daily: â€¢
In Monday's editorial (The
American Shame), it is apparent
that its author has adopted tho
Dullesian "moralistic" approach
to the realities of the Cold War
world. More succinctly, he op
poses our "spying" on Russia as
"repugnant and unnecessary."
In pursuance of its policy of
containment, our government has
established military bases encir
cling Russia. Certainly, no one is
naive enough to think that they
are merely roadblocks to Russian
aggression. Among their func
tions is that of observation (or
"spying," to use less euphonic
verbage).
Assuming that, if war comes,
the U.S. would prefer to limit its
retaliatory attack to tactical ap
plications rather than wholesale
slaughter, it would bo preferable
to destroy military installations
vis-a-vis homes and cities. This
could be done by resorting to wea
pons of lesser magnitude than hy
drogen bombs.
However, in that event, it
would be necessary to have some
knowledge of ihe si/.e and location
of those military establishments.
Herein lies the need for "spying."
If this attempt to focus our
retaliation upon planes and guns,
rather than women and children,
is "repugnant and unnecessary"
to American morality, we are a
short-sighted people. And, moral
myopia being ihe case, therein
lies "the American shame."

Tresidder Union
Editor, the Daily:
The recent series of articles in
the Daily on the proposed pur
poses of the Tresidder Union have
brought forth at least two major
points of controversy.
The first that an "industrial
cafeteria" is hardly conducive to
stimulating bull sessions on aca
demic or any other topics I
heartily agree with. A series of
smaller dining rooms with en
tirely different motifs would pro
vide atmospheres far more con
ducive to intellectual and social
exchange.
The second point is one which
the Daily has belabored to near
exhaustion. That is the miscon
ception that in order to have a
stimulating bull session, a stimu
lating bowling line, or a stimulat
ing T.G.I.F. party, some type of
alcoholic stimulant is needed.
The authors of the Tresidder
article state that the Union need
not provide for non-intellectual
functions because "the University
will, to all effects, be admitting it
has a serious interest not only in
contributing to a student's intel
lectual and social growth, but also
in entertaining him."
Further, that "Obviously, such
on-campus gatherings would be
unable to offer the attractions
found in various neighborhood es
tablishments."
What the Daily overlooks, or at
least glosses over, is that there is
students who do not feel the need

a largo contingent of Stanford
of alcoholic stimulants, and are
therefore non-drinkers. These stu
dents respect the right of others
to drink if they wish.
Unfortunately, the attitudes of
the Stanford drinking contingent
create social pressures which of
ten either subjugate the desires
of non-drinking associates or ef
fectively ostracizing thera. from
most "organized activities."
Therein lies the problem. It is
true that there are numerous
"neighborhood es t ahlishments"
which cater to the social and rec
reational desires of those who
wish'to drink.
However, with the exception of
the natural recreational resources
that have been here for centuries,
the entire Bay Area is notoriously
lacking in social and recreational
"establishments" for those who do
not wish to imbibe. The proposed
Tresidder Union would and should
provide a much needed facility for
these students.
By not making themselves
known, many Stanford students
who prefer not to drink.are allow
ing the drinkers to trod upon
them. The time has again come
to stand for our own rights as
well as for the rights of others.
