The world's space-weather re
port now can be revised from "oc
casional" to "frequent" showers
of meteors on the strength of new

about the origin and lifetime of
interplanetary matter also may
result, according to Drs. Philip B.
Gallagher and Von R. Eshleman
of the Stanford Radioscience Lab
oratory.
