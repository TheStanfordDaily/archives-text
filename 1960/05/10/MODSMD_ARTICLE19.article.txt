## On Other Campi

In the May issue of McCaH's,
Robert M. Hutchins, former Chan
cellor of the University of Chicago
and one of America's leading edu
cators, warns that America's uni
versities are "trivial, frivolous
and irrelevant."
Mr. Hutchins starts his acid
soaked article with a nasty little
quote by Walter P. Metzger of
Columbia University who is also
of the opinion that America's in
stitutions of higher learning are
rather poor.
Metzger refers to universities
as "folk institutions" which are
"motley and mongrelized." In
asking "What should a university
he?" every need has clamored for
recognition, every craft has hoped
to belongâ€”and the result has been
the unhappy association of pid
dling vocational and unimportant
intellectual interests.
He goes on to call the univer
sity in the U.S. hot a community
of scholars, "but an enormous ag
glomerate service station, where
one can be born, go to kindergar
ten, lower sehool, high school,
meet the girl friend and get mar
ried; where one gets religious sol
ace or psychiatric help.
Mr. Hutchins now takes the
club from Mi - . Metzger and- sar
castically prances through two
more pages of invective, not for
getting to blast the overemphasis
on football, a Department of
Mortuary Science at Wayne State
University in Detroit, and a
course at some California school
called itope Chest 61-A and 61-B.
He astutely observes that the
reason why our colleges and uni
versities are so poor is that they
want "to be attractive to students
and donors. Educators believe,
with some reason, that nothing is
so dangerous as to he different."
There are two reasons for this
attitude. First of all, being dif
ferent gets one into arguments.
"If you are different, you have to
explain why." Secondly, to be
different in our society connotes
oddness or intellectuality and
could even come to be associated
with radicalness, or, heaven for
bid, subversiveness.
To keep a rather vulgar story
short, Mr. Hutchins claims that
America's obsession with quan
tity (which includes money, but
not only money) is the great
chink in her educational armor.

In its place he advocates "the
production of disciplined intolli- !
gence." lie claims that colleges
and universities must dedicate 1
themselves to this production and
to nothing else, not even football.
Mr. Hutehins, however, after
brilliantly dissecting our diseased
educational system, fails to come
up with any concrete answer as
to how we are going to make uni
versities the producers of disci
plined intelligence and nothing
else and how this is "the" answer.
Ilis conclusion is pocked with
those phrases which have become
all too familiar and, therefore, all
100 meaningless. .. We confront
new problems, the solution of
which is crucial to lis and to all
civilization," the last paragraph
starts.
"Nothing is more striking than
the absence of connection between
the basic problems of America
and the educational program in
America. Our real needs are to
discover how to make democracy
work, how to survive in Ihe nu
clear age and what to do with
ourselves if we do survive."
Just what are these crucial
problems Mr. Hutehins refers to?
What exactly is meant by "the
absence of connection between the
basic problems of America and
the educational program in Amer
ica? And above all, how does the
production of disciplined intelli
gence necessarily mean that we
will discover how to make democ- i
racy work or how to survive in
the nuclear age?
3lr. Hutehins song is well worth
singing in spite of a surrendering.
Perhaps some reader can supply
Mr. Hutehins with the melodic
ending note he seems to he hulk
ing for.

Ghana, which will adopt a re
publican form of government on
July 1, was formerly known as
the Gold Coast. The west African
nation takes its new name from
a mighty empire that flourished
for some 800 years before Euro
peans came to the Dark Conti
nent.
