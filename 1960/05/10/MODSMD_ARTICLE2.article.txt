## Conformity Discussed 
### 
George Guy and Bob Richard
son presented two viewpoints on
the topic "Social Pressures and
Social Responsibility" at the third
discussion in the "Revolt of Con
science" series sponsored by the
Socialist Caucus of the Political
Union last night.
Guy, ;i graduate student in eco
nomics, stated thai socially ac
ceptable behavior is often the an
tithesis of social responsibility.
Me maintained that pressures for
conformity may order an indi
vidual's life so completely that he
will refrain from taking a stand
against popular practices which
he knows to be wrong.
Silence 'Irresponsible'
Guy cited the relatively slight
response to the peace action peti
tion displayed in the library dur
ing the past week. "Keeping silent
in some situations is social irre
sponsibility." he stated.
Richardson, a graduate student
in philosophy, suggested that
pressure for social conformity
may have practical aspects.
"In any workable society our
ideas and standards must meet
somewhere," he declared. "The
question is, where will they meet
and what actions will result?"
Situations Differ
The complex from which each
decision is made is different,
Richardson suggested, because it
involves a'â€¢particular interaction
of the situation, Ihe individual,
and the social context. Neither
complete individualism nor total
conformity is the realistic answer.
"Perhaps social pressure has a
value as one of many factors, not
one by which all the rest are
judged," Richardson said.
