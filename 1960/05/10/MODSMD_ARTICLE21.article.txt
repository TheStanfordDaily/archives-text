# Card Diamondmen Beat USF
## Daily Sports 
### Roy Schmidt 
Capitalizing on five University of San Francisco errors Stanford's
varsity baseballers downed the Dons 8-.~> yesterday before a meek
crowd of about 25 persons.
The Indians, hoping to boost their reason record to 17-13, face the

Sacramento State Hornets this
afternoon on the Sunken Diamond
at 3:15.
Stanford's Marv Mecklenberg,
changing speed to perfection,
fanned 11 Don hitters but was
touched for five hits and five
runs. Mecklenberg tired in the
ninth, allowing three hits and two
walks, good for two runs. Rich

Simpson finished up, getting the
opposing pitcher, Steve Whittock,
to ground out ending the game.
Fateful Fourth
Stanford erupted for six runs in
the fateful fourth to blow the cap
off a tight 2-1 pitchers' battle. The
Indians made four hits, got two
walks, and took advantage of an
error for the six tallies. Big blow
in the inning was John Hurlbut's
two-run single to center.
The Indians' first two tallies
came on a comedy of errors in
the third. Ilal Schutzmann reach
ed first on an error by third base
man Barbeau and moved around
to third when shortstop John
Alaura committed throwing fold
fielding miscues on Mike Magce's
ground ball. Skip Lawrence drove
both mates across with a booming
double to left.
The Dons hit the scoring column

Dons Threaten
San Francisco threatened in the
ninth when Mecklenberg ran out
of gas. The Card lefthander
struck out two Don hitters but
gave up three hits and one run in
the process. lie then walked two
straight hitters, to give the Dons
their other tally. Simpson was
called on to put out the fire.
Whittock was very effective
against the Indians, holding them
to just five hits. He struck out
12 but was the victim of five
walks and the five Don errors.
Bill Galagher was big man in
the lineup for San Francisco, get
ting four hits in five trips, includ
ing a run-scoring double.

Stanford's defense again turned
in an errorless performance and
pulled off several difficult plays.
Jim Cowart, who has been sta
tioned at first for the last two
games, seems to have adapted
himself to that position quickly.

MIKE MAGEE SCORES
Skip Lawrence Doubled to Drive in This Run
Capitalizing on five University of San Francisco errors Stanford's
varsity baseballers downed the Dons 8-.~> yesterday before a meek
crowd of about 25 persons.
The Indians, hoping to boost their reason record to 17-13, face the

Sacramento State Hornets this
afternoon on the Sunken Diamond
at 3:15.
Stanford's Marv Mecklenberg,
changing speed to perfection,
fanned 11 Don hitters but was
touched for five hits and five
runs. Mecklenberg tired in the
ninth, allowing three hits and two
walks, good for two runs. Rich

Simpson finished up, getting the
opposing pitcher, Steve Whittock,
to ground out ending the game.
Fateful Fourth
Stanford erupted for six runs in
the fateful fourth to blow the cap
off a tight 2-1 pitchers' battle. The
Indians made four hits, got two
walks, and took advantage of an
error for the six tallies. Big blow
in the inning was John Hurlbut's
two-run single to center.
The Indians' first two tallies
came on a comedy of errors in
the third. Ilal Schutzmann reach
ed first on an error by third base
man Barbeau and moved around
to third when shortstop John
Alaura committed throwing fold
fielding miscues on Mike Magce's
ground ball. Skip Lawrence drove
both mates across with a booming
double to left.

the process. lie then walked two

Capitalizing on five University of San Francisco errors Stanford's
varsity baseballers downed the Dons 8-.~> yesterday before a meek
crowd of about 25 persons.
The Indians, hoping to boost their reason record to 17-13, face the

Sacramento State Hornets this
afternoon on the Sunken Diamond
at 3:15.
Stanford's Marv Mecklenberg,
changing speed to perfection,
fanned 11 Don hitters but was
touched for five hits and five
runs. Mecklenberg tired in the
ninth, allowing three hits and two
walks, good for two runs. Rich

Simpson finished up, getting the
opposing pitcher, Steve Whittock,
to ground out ending the game.
Fateful Fourth
Stanford erupted for six runs in
the fateful fourth to blow the cap
off a tight 2-1 pitchers' battle. The
Indians made four hits, got two
walks, and took advantage of an
error for the six tallies. Big blow
in the inning was John Hurlbut's
two-run single to center.
The Indians' first two tallies
came on a comedy of errors in
the third. Ilal Schutzmann reach
ed first on an error by third base
man Barbeau and moved around
to third when shortstop John
Alaura committed throwing fold
fielding miscues on Mike Magce's
ground ball. Skip Lawrence drove
both mates across with a booming
double to left.
The Dons hit the scoring column

Dons Threaten
San Francisco threatened in the
ninth when Mecklenberg ran out
of gas. The Card lefthander
struck out two Don hitters but
gave up three hits and one run in
the process. lie then walked two
straight hitters, to give the Dons
their other tally. Simpson was
called on to put out the fire.
Whittock was very effective
against the Indians, holding them
to just five hits. He struck out
12 but was the victim of five
walks and the five Don errors.
Bill Galagher was big man in
the lineup for San Francisco, get
ting four hits in five trips, includ
ing a run-scoring double.

Stanford's defense again turned
in an errorless performance and
pulled off several difficult plays.
