# Tennis Team Defeated by Cancellations
## 
### 
Stanford's tennis team, having
trouble getting matches played
this year, had their third match
in two weeks called off yesterday
as their match with the Univer
sity of British Columbia, sched
uled for yesterday, had to be can
celled.
Just last week the Indians had
matches with San Jose and Pep
perdine cancelled when rain came
along to wipe out the Spartan
match, and the Waves from Pep
perdine were unable to make the
trip north.
10xtra Burden
These cancellations put an
extra burden on the Indians who
have their tougehst matches of
the season this weekend when
the always powerful teams from
UCLA and USC travel to Palo
Alto from Los Angeles.
On Friday the Trojans will be
at Stanford led by Greg Grant
and Bobby Delgado, and on Sat
urday the Bruins arrive complete
with nationally ranked Larry
Nagler, Alan Fox, and Roger
YVerksman.
In order for some of the Stan
ford players to get toughened up
for the weekend's play, they have
entered the California State Tour
nament which began yesterday at
the California Tennis Club in San
Francisco.
