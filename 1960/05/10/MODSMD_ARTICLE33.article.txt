EUROPE MADE SIMPLE: No. 1
Summer vacation is just around the corner, an<l naturally all of
you arc going to Europe. Perhaps 1 can offer a handy tip or
two. (I must confess I have never been to Europe myself, hut
1 eat a lot of Scotch broth and French dressing, so I am not
entirely without qualification.)
First let me say that no trip to Europe is complete without
a visit to England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, (iermany,
Spain, Portugal, Italy, Lichtenstcin, Holland, Belgium, Switzer
land, Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Po
land, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Russia,
(Irecce, Yugoslavia, Albania, Crete, Sardinia, Sicily, Hungary,
Komania, Bulgaria, Lapland, and Andorra.
Let us take up these countries in order. First, England.
The capital of England is London—or Liverpool, as it is
sometimes called. There are many interesting things to see in
London—chiefly, the changing of the guards. The guards are
changed daily. The old ones arc thrown away.

Another "must" while in London is n vi>it to Buckingham
Palace. Frequently in the afternoons Her Majesty the Queen
conies out on the balcony of the palace and waves to her loyal
subjects below. The loyal subjects wave back at the Queen.
However, they only continue to wave as long as Her Majesty
is waving. This of course is the origin of wave lengths from which
we have derived numerous benefits including radio, television
and the AA: 1' (iypsies.
He sure also when you are in London to visit the palace of
the I Hike of Marlborough. Mnrlborovyh is spelled Marlborotigh,
but pronounced Marlboro. English spelling is very quaint I" 1 '
terribly disorganized. The late (leorgc Bernard Shaw, author of
Jo's Hons, fought all his life to simplify English spelling, lie
once asked a friend, "What does g-h-o-t-i spell?" The friend
pondered a bit and replied, "(loatee." Shaw sniggered. "Pshaw,"
said Shaw, "(1-h-o-t-i does not spell goatee. Jt spells Jis/i. G'h
as in enough, o as in women, li as in motion."
It must be remembered, however, that Shaw was a vegetarian
— which, all in all. was probably a good thing. As Disraeli once
remarked to (luy Fawkes, "If Shaw were not a vegetarian, no
lamb chop in London would be safe.'!
Hut I digress. We were speaking of the palace of the Duke of
Marlborough- or Marlboro, as il is called in the tinted States.
It is called Marlboro by every smoker who knows flavor did
not go out when filters came in. He sure you are well supplied
with Marlboros when you make your trip abroad. After a long,
tiring day of sightseeing, there is nothing so welcome as a tine,
flavorful Marlboro and a foot bath with hot Epsom salts.
Epsom salts can be obtained in England at Epsom Downs.
Kensington salts can be obtained at Kensington Gardens, Al
bert salts can be obtained at Albert Hall, Hyde salts call be
obtained at Hyde Park, and the crown jewels can be obtained
at the Tower of London.
Well sir, now you know all you need to know about England,
rs'ext week we will visit the Land of the Midnight Sun- France.
