## Film Reveals Red China As Land of New Contrasts 
### Daryl Glenney 
A strange combination of the
old and the new, the contrast of
Chinese traditions and progress
under Communism, highlighted
"Inside Red China," the last in
! the travel film series, shown to a
near full house in Memorial Audi
torium last night.
Robert Cohen, photographer
and narrator, took the movies for
NBC while on a tour of China fol
lowing the World Youth Festival
in Moscow in 1957.
A striking characteristic of the
film 'was constant evidence of
Communist Party attempts to
combine socialistic methods with
ancient Chinese traditions and
superstitions, "to keep the confi
dence of the people." Cohen said.
This was illustrated by detailed
pictures of a model hospital which
combines folk medicinc with mod
' ern science.

Cohen visited a prison, ship
yards, factories, resort towns, and
i even a small fishing village-turn
led-commune in his photographic
! tour. In each place he received a
'tremendous reception; in Peking
he was greeted with a chorus of
! "John Brown's Body."
Working conditions revealed by
the film showed women working
! along with the men surrounded by
! slogans urging "Work harder.
( better and faster for Commu
nism." A picture of Manchuria's
industrial skyline was similar to
those of the Western world in the
mid-19th century.
The film concluded with color
ful shots of the National Day Pa
rade in all its military splendor,
| climaxed by the appearance of
j "Uncle" Mao Tse-Tung. "The dra
gon has come to life." said Cohen,
"and all the people of the world
! are watching."
