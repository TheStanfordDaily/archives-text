### Stan Hulett 
Early in 1906 the Stanford Press
became too large for its cramped
quarters in the power house and
Mrs. Stanford told the young man
running the Press at the time.
"One of us is going to have to
move and I think it is going to be
you."
The young man to whom Mrs.
Stanford spoke was Julius An
drew Quelle, a member of the first
class to enter the University in
1891. Quelle had started a press
fin the campus some ten years be
fore through funds given to him
by 12 professors.
Mrs. Stanford's Heel
The exact circumstances lead
ing to the building of a new build
ing did not come to until
Quelle died in January of this
year at the age of <X 9.
Quelle states that Mrs. Stanford
came to him at the press when
it was housed in the old power
house and told him he would have
to move. He then asked her for
a plot of land upon which to build
a new press.
She lead him to a spot to where
the Union now stands, set her heel
in the ground and told him thai he
could have "forty foot each way
from my heel mark."
Quelle says in his notes, . .
quickly got a little stick and

pushed it down into the ground,
and thoro with the help of his
brother-in-law, Bervvyn Stewart,
built the new press building.
Survives Kai'tliquake
The building that Quelle and
Stewart built there survived the
great 1906 earthquake, one of the
few buildings on campus to come
through the tremor undamaged.
Quelle even insisted on putting
out a paper on the day of the
quake, despite the fact a man had
been crushed to death near-by by
a big chimney which collapsed
across from the Press.
The campus newspaper at that
time was called the Daily Palo
Alto, and Quelle was listed' in thl*
mast as the Business Manager <Vl'
the publication.
Marge Bailey on Staff j
Quelle employed many students
in the Press, among them, Dr.
Margery Bailey, formerly a pro
fessor of English at Stanford,
author William Neidig and Theo
dore Hoover.
The first book to carry "Stan
ford University Press," was The
Story of the Innumerable Com
pany, written by then President
of the I diversity. David Starr Jor
dan. The inscription that Dr.
Jordan wrote in the first book
reprinted by Quelle was. "Here
after il will always be known as

the Stanford University Press."
The book was a 39-page pamphlet
set by hand by Quelle.
Thte growth in the printing
caused more problems for Quelle
j since his equipment became in
adequate to handle the work of
all the student publications which
desired to have the Press print
their publications.
Wilbur Builds
It was then that the University
took over the operation of the
University Press from Quelle. Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur was the Presi
dent of the University when the
Press was acquired and built the
new building where it now stands
on the Campus. This was in 1917.
Quelle had come to Stanford
from New York, by way of Den
ver. His first intention when he
left the eastern city was to find
a job that would get him a start
in civil engineering, about which,
"1 knew not liing."
He found the going pretty
rough, and he finally took a job
on a paper in Southern Colorado.
After a time on this job, he de
cided he would come to Californ
ia for the opening of Stanford
University in October. 1891.
Knciiia Food
Quelle finally scraped up enough
money to get a ticket to San
.Jose on the railroad and arrived

in California in late September of
1891. He was housed in Encina
Hall on the campus, where he
worked as a janitor, until he* de
cided there was a need for a press
at the University.
He notes that he was astounded
by the quantities of food that
were brought for the Encina Din
ing Hall. ". . . here they got 300
quarts of milk a day, and 900
pounds of meat and unknown
quantities of other foods. But
most of our food was baked beans
and prunes, the latter principally
in pies."
Quelle mentions that the food
was not satisfactory to many of
the students, mainly because it
was prepared under a steward of
the Southern Pacific Railways, of
which Senator Stanford was di
rector.
Must Visit Bert
Quelle was also apparently pop
ular with the other students at
the time, for he mentions visits
with some of them. One in par
ticular is interesting. Quelle states
in his notes, "I was staying with
Fred Williams when 'Bert' came
to his door and said, 'now you
have visited Fred so you have to
come over to my house, Julius.' "
"Bert" is former President of
the United States, Herbert
Hoover.

in the Press, among them, Dr.
Margery Bailey, formerly a pro
fessor of English at Stanford,
author William Neidig and Theo

The first book to carry "Stan
ford University Press," was The
Story of the Innumerable Com
pany, written by then President
of the I diversity. David Starr Jor
dan. The inscription that Dr.
Jordan wrote in the first book
reprinted by Quelle was. "Here
after il will always be known as

the Stanford University Press."
The book was a 39-page pamphlet
set by hand by Quelle.
Thte growth in the printing

desired to have the Press print

It was then that the University
took over the operation of the
University Press from Quelle. Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur was the Presi
dent of the University when the
Press was acquired and built the
new building where it now stands
on the Campus. This was in 1917.
Quelle had come to Stanford
from New York, by way of Den
ver. His first intention when he
left the eastern city was to find
a job that would get him a start
in civil engineering, about which,
"1 knew not liing."
He found the going pretty
rough, and he finally took a job
on a paper in Southern Colorado.
After a time on this job, he de
cided he would come to Californ
ia for the opening of Stanford
University in October. 1891.
Knciiia Food
Quelle finally scraped up enough
money to get a ticket to San
.Jose on the railroad and arrived

in California in late September of
1891. He was housed in Encina
Hall on the campus, where he
worked as a janitor, until he* de
cided there was a need for a press
at the University.
He notes that he was astounded
by the quantities of food that
were brought for the Encina Din
ing Hall. ". . . here they got 300
quarts of milk a day, and 900
pounds of meat and unknown
quantities of other foods. But
most of our food was baked beans
and prunes, the latter principally
in pies."
Quelle mentions that the food
was not satisfactory to many of
the students, mainly because it
was prepared under a steward of
the Southern Pacific Railways, of
which Senator Stanford was di
rector.
Must Visit Bert
Quelle was also apparently pop
ular with the other students at
the time, for he mentions visits
with some of them. One in par
ticular is interesting. Quelle states
in his notes, "I was staying with
Fred Williams when 'Bert' came
to his door and said, 'now you
have visited Fred so you have to
come over to my house, Julius.' "
"Bert" is former President of
the United States, Herbert
Hoover.
Early in 1906 the Stanford Press
became too large for its cramped
quarters in the power house and
Mrs. Stanford told the young man
running the Press at the time.
"One of us is going to have to
move and I think it is going to be
you."
The young man to whom Mrs.
Stanford spoke was Julius An
drew Quelle, a member of the first
class to enter the University in
1891. Quelle had started a press
fin the campus some ten years be
fore through funds given to him
by 12 professors.
Mrs. Stanford's Heel
The exact circumstances lead
ing to the building of a new build
ing did not come to until
Quelle died in January of this
year at the age of <X 9.
Quelle states that Mrs. Stanford
came to him at the press when
it was housed in the old power
house and told him he would have
to move. He then asked her for
a plot of land upon which to build
a new press.
She lead him to a spot to where
the Union now stands, set her heel
in the ground and told him thai he
could have "forty foot each way
from my heel mark."
Quelle says in his notes, . .
quickly got a little stick and

pushed it down into the ground,
and thoro with the help of his
brother-in-law, Bervvyn Stewart,
built the new press building.
Survives Kai'tliquake
The building that Quelle and
Stewart built there survived the
great 1906 earthquake, one of the
few buildings on campus to come
through the tremor undamaged.
Quelle even insisted on putting
out a paper on the day of the
quake, despite the fact a man had
been crushed to death near-by by
a big chimney which collapsed
across from the Press.
The campus newspaper at that
time was called the Daily Palo
Alto, and Quelle was listed' in thl*
mast as the Business Manager <Vl'
the publication.

ing Hall. ". . . here they got 300
quarts of milk a day, and 900
pounds of meat and unknown
quantities of other foods. But
most of our food was baked beans
and prunes, the latter principally
in pies."
Quelle mentions that the food
was not satisfactory to many of
the students, mainly because it
was prepared under a steward of
the Southern Pacific Railways, of
which Senator Stanford was di
rector.
Must Visit Bert
Quelle was also apparently pop
ular with the other students at
the time, for he mentions visits
with some of them. One in par
ticular is interesting. Quelle states
in his notes, "I was staying with
Fred Williams when 'Bert' came
to his door and said, 'now you
have visited Fred so you have to
come over to my house, Julius.' "
"Bert" is former President of
the United States, Herbert
Hoover.
Early in 1906 the Stanford Press
became too large for its cramped
quarters in the power house and
Mrs. Stanford told the young man
running the Press at the time.
"One of us is going to have to
move and I think it is going to be
you."
The young man to whom Mrs.
Stanford spoke was Julius An
drew Quelle, a member of the first
class to enter the University in
1891. Quelle had started a press
fin the campus some ten years be
fore through funds given to him
by 12 professors.
Mrs. Stanford's Heel
The exact circumstances lead
ing to the building of a new build
ing did not come to until
Quelle died in January of this
year at the age of <X 9.
Quelle states that Mrs. Stanford
came to him at the press when
it was housed in the old power
house and told him he would have
to move. He then asked her for
a plot of land upon which to build
a new press.
She lead him to a spot to where
the Union now stands, set her heel
in the ground and told him thai he
could have "forty foot each way
from my heel mark."
Quelle says in his notes, . .
quickly got a little stick and

pushed it down into the ground,
and thoro with the help of his
brother-in-law, Bervvyn Stewart,
built the new press building.
Survives Kai'tliquake
The building that Quelle and
Stewart built there survived the
great 1906 earthquake, one of the
few buildings on campus to come
through the tremor undamaged.
Quelle even insisted on putting
out a paper on the day of the
quake, despite the fact a man had
been crushed to death near-by by
a big chimney which collapsed
across from the Press.
The campus newspaper at that
time was called the Daily Palo
Alto, and Quelle was listed' in thl*
mast as the Business Manager <Vl'
the publication.
Marge Bailey on Staff j
Quelle employed many students
in the Press, among them, Dr.
Margery Bailey, formerly a pro
fessor of English at Stanford,
author William Neidig and Theo
dore Hoover.
The first book to carry "Stan
ford University Press," was The
Story of the Innumerable Com
pany, written by then President
of the I diversity. David Starr Jor
dan. The inscription that Dr.
Jordan wrote in the first book
reprinted by Quelle was. "Here
after il will always be known as

the Stanford University Press."
The book was a 39-page pamphlet
set by hand by Quelle.
Thte growth in the printing
caused more problems for Quelle
j since his equipment became in
adequate to handle the work of
all the student publications which
desired to have the Press print
their publications.
Wilbur Builds
It was then that the University
took over the operation of the
University Press from Quelle. Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur was the Presi
dent of the University when the
Press was acquired and built the
new building where it now stands
on the Campus. This was in 1917.
Quelle had come to Stanford
from New York, by way of Den
ver. His first intention when he
left the eastern city was to find
a job that would get him a start
in civil engineering, about which,
"1 knew not liing."
He found the going pretty
rough, and he finally took a job
on a paper in Southern Colorado.
After a time on this job, he de
cided he would come to Californ
ia for the opening of Stanford
University in October. 1891.
Knciiia Food
Quelle finally scraped up enough
money to get a ticket to San
.Jose on the railroad and arrived

in California in late September of
1891. He was housed in Encina
Hall on the campus, where he
worked as a janitor, until he* de
cided there was a need for a press
at the University.
He notes that he was astounded
by the quantities of food that
were brought for the Encina Din
ing Hall. ". . . here they got 300
