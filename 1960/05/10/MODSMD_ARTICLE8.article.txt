# U.S. Acknowledges Spy Flight; Moscow Warns May Hit Bases
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/Pi The United States acknowledged yesterday it has sent spy flights into the So
viet Union under President Eisenhower's general orders.
The Stale Department did not discourage a deduction that such flights may continue until Soviet
leaders open their borders to inspection.
Secretary of State Christian A. Herter, in making the acknowledgment, strongly defended intelli
gence flights by unarmed civilian planes as urgently necessary to guard the non-Communist world

I against surprise Soviet attack.
In a special statement, Herter
suggested that next week's sum-
I mit conference make an earnest
attempt to agree on safeguards
which would end the threat that
; either side could suddenly launch
a nuclear onslaught against the
other.
With the approval of President
Eisenhower, Herter frankly ad
; mitted American planes have car
-1 ried out "extensive aerial surveil
-1 lance" of Communist territory un
: der directives issued by the Presi
i dent as part of his national secur
| ity duties.
Speaking- Only of lUc
Here, there was mention of the
National Security Act of 1947, but
the wording made it clear that the
secretary was speaking only of
President Eisenhower, who went
into office in 1953.
"Specific missions of these un-
I armed civilian aircraft have not
! been subject to presidential au
thorization," Herter said.
After Soviet Premier Nikita
' Khrushchev reported the capture
of a 30-year-old American flier
! deep inside the Soviet Union, the
State Department acknowledged
an intelligence flight over Soviet
territory probably was underta
ken. It said "insofar as the author
ities in Washington are concern
ed, there was no authorization for
: any such flight."
To Ease Congress
Herter's disclosures yesterday
came as the administration hur
] riedly sought to ease congres
sional demands for more infor
j mation.

Intelligence Chief Allen W. Dulles

Herter's carefully drafted state
i ment, issued after the 90-minute
j briefing, did not say flatly that
! the United States would continue

I tory.
' But, for the first time, it was
j acknowledged that such flights
1 were undertaken not only along
the frontiers of the Communist
I world, but "by penetration"—that
is, flights deep into Communist
i territory.
Intel-national Law
Herter's statement constituted
!a remarkable admission that the
United States has been violating
international law, intruding with
| out permission into Soviet air
space.
It was learned that Herter and
I Dulles told the Congressional
; leaders that such reconnaissance
I flights had been made into the
Soviet Union for several years.

tures taken on successful plane
flights which one participant de
j scribed as being highly illuminat
| ifig.

some belief that the plane knocked
! down May 1 was not hit at any
thing like a 60,000-foot altitude
but that perhaps something went,
wrong which forced it to descend
! into closer range.
It also was learned that several
highly placed legislators told the
administration officials they be
lieved the timing of the flight was
bad and that it would hurt the
; United States and the rest of the
I free world at the summit.
