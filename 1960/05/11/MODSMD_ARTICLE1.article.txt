# Sterling Slates U.S. to Change
## 
### Ross Hermann 
America is standing on the threshold of a new era in its history
the era of imagination President J. E. Wallace Sterling told gradu
ating seniors last night in Memorial Auditorium.
Sterling's talk was the first in what it is hoped will become an
annual tradition replacing the usual commencement address. His
speech was entitled, "The Senior Lecture on Higher Education:

Changes and Chances."
Sterling cited the frontier as
being representative of the first
era in the nation's development.
Associated with this period were
the images of sell-sufficiency and
individualism. Education, gener
ally de-emphasized, was left as
an individual matter.
'Melting Pot'
The second era, lasting well into
the 20th Century and perhaps not
yet over, is characterized by so
cial amalgamation. Pressures of
the "melting pot" forced people
to live together, and the result
was a. complex society in which
education became a neccesity. In
this period, he said, arose the
dual system of public and private
education.
With the land settled and con
quered and with the United States
having assumed an identity, we
stand at the beginning of the new
era, facing challenges and
chances.
Discipline Key
The key iu this period, he said,
will be discipline, with research
expanding faster than any other
activity. Despite the teamwork
and cooperation that will be nec
essary, the individual will remain
the "chief engine" of scientific
advancement. Upon him will fall
greater demands for original
thought.
The new era will demand, he
said, an increase in the general
level of education beside the
training of the top minds.
Sterling said that higher edu
cation has several important
strengths necessary to meet the
future—among these its autono
mous nature, its diversity, and
its flexibility.
More Financing
Beside these inherent strengths,
it is ill-prepared financially to
meet the new demands. He esti
mated $21 to $40 billion will be
required in the next 10 years to
fully finance education at the col
lege level.
Universities, he said, will be
forced to supplement their his
torical sources of funds with fed
eral aid. The problem will be to
preserve the old sources endow
ments and contributions so as
not to rely too heavily on govern
ment aid.
In concluding his talk, Sterling
posed the problem of what stand
ards are to be used in implement
ing change. "You must take a
good look at the new," he said,
"before discarding the old. The
important thing is to keep the
mind well-stocked and ventilat
ed."

cial amalgamation. Pressures of
the "melting pot" forced people
to live together, and the result
was a. complex society in which
education became a neccesity. In
this period, he said, arose the
dual system of public and private
education.
With the land settled and con
quered and with the United States
having assumed an identity, we
stand at the beginning of the new
era, facing challenges and
chances.
Discipline Key
The key iu this period, he said,
will be discipline, with research
expanding faster than any other
activity. Despite the teamwork
and cooperation that will be nec
essary, the individual will remain
the "chief engine" of scientific
advancement. Upon him will fall
greater demands for original
thought.
The new era will demand, he
said, an increase in the general
level of education beside the
training of the top minds.
Sterling said that higher edu
cation has several important
strengths necessary to meet the
future—among these its autono
mous nature, its diversity, and
its flexibility.
More Financing
Beside these inherent strengths,
it is ill-prepared financially to
meet the new demands. He esti
mated $21 to $40 billion will be
required in the next 10 years to
fully finance education at the col
lege level.
Universities, he said, will be
forced to supplement their his
torical sources of funds with fed
eral aid. The problem will be to
preserve the old sources endow
ments and contributions so as
not to rely too heavily on govern
ment aid.
In concluding his talk, Sterling
posed the problem of what stand
ards are to be used in implement
ing change. "You must take a
good look at the new," he said,
"before discarding the old. The
important thing is to keep the
mind well-stocked and ventilat
ed."
America is standing on the threshold of a new era in its history
the era of imagination President J. E. Wallace Sterling told gradu
ating seniors last night in Memorial Auditorium.
Sterling's talk was the first in what it is hoped will become an
annual tradition replacing the usual commencement address. His
speech was entitled, "The Senior Lecture on Higher Education:

Changes and Chances."
Sterling cited the frontier as
being representative of the first
era in the nation's development.
Associated with this period were
the images of sell-sufficiency and
individualism. Education, gener
ally de-emphasized, was left as
an individual matter.
'Melting Pot'
The second era, lasting well into
the 20th Century and perhaps not
yet over, is characterized by so
cial amalgamation. Pressures of
