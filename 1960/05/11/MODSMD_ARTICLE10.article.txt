# WEST VIRGINIA
## Early Returns Show Kennedy Edging Ahead 
### 
CHARLESTON, W. Va. (J?) ■
Son. John F. Kennedy (D.-Mass.)
got off to a flying start last night
in his West Virginia primary
make-or-break bid for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination.
First returns from scattered
sections of this Protestant state
showed Kennedy, a Catholic, run
ning ahead of Sen. Hubert H.
Humphrey (D.-Minn.) a Congre
gationalist, in total vote and in
some of the areas where the Cath
olic copulation is scant.
The unofficial count from 319
of 2,750 precincts showed: Ken
nedy 24,153, Humphrey 14.648.
Greater Numbers
While it could not be regarded
as a trend, Kennedy fared well in
precincts where Humphrey was
supposed to have considerable
strength.
Despite a cold, drizzling rain
which fell intermittently through
out the state, voters turned out
in greater than usual numbers.
Slugging matches in Democrat
ic and Republican races for nomi
nations for governor helped swell
the turnout. Only registered Dem
ocrats could vote in the presiden
tial popularity contest. Write-ins
were barred.
Confidence
Both the Kennedy and the
Humphrey camps adopted an at
titude of restrained confidence
about the results of a test that
could give Kennedy a leg up on
the nomination or throw the field
wide open.
Both principals flew off sepa
rately for a few hours in Wash
ington before returning to sit out
what promised to be a slow count
from the states 2,750 precincts.
Kennedy's Roman Catholic reli
gion was regarded as a potentially
decisive factor in his contest with
Humphrey, a Congregationalist.
Catholics make up only 4.5 per
cent of West Virginia's popula
tion, compared with a 23.0 per
cent national average.
Religious Issue
Kennedy brought the religious
issue into the open and battled to
get the message over to the voters
that he supports separation of
church and state. Ho said he would
rebuff any Pope who might seek
to influence him as president.
The outcome of Humphrey-Ken
nedy contest could have little, if
any, effeet on West Virginia's 25-
vote convention delegation. From
all outward appearance* it will he
split among several of the presi
dential hopefuls with Johnson ex
pected to ha\o .i ma j<»i i!y.
