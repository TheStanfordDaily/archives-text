# A 						Hasty Subpoena

### 
Ilit' House I n-Ameriean Activities Committee once again has
pitched its tent In the Bav and rolled out its nets to catch a few
red snappers. A Stanford student, a ( al student and forty-aix other
people have received subpoenas, two of them teachers who have
already lost their jobs.
What are "un-American*" activities, and does this Committee
have a right to define them? If we are not mistaken, in this
country a man is innocent until proven guilty; the burden of
this proof is borne bv our judicial system with the aid of the state
prosecutor, the KBJ and the local police.
In taking it upon itself to define '"un-American* activities and
then to judge people by its definition, the Committee often
assumes constabularv and judicial prerogatives far bevond those
granted to Congress bv the Constitution.
Kv en more serious than this misuse of power is tlx* effect of
the House Committee on private lives. |{\ summoning individuals
to prove their innocence, the Committee, in effect, can destrov a
reputation with a liastv subpoena. An individual's career can be
ruined even before he i> judged innocent or guiltv of a deviation
from thÂ«' "American \\ av of Life.*'
We suspect the House Committee, once its nets are pulled in.
will have caught more red herring than edible red snapper.
It Americans are alert, thev will refuse the Committee a fishing
license before it can futher muddv the waters of civil libertv.
