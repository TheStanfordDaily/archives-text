The University of California Executive Committee, the stu
dent body legislature, is now fighting against an order from Chan
cellor Clenn Seaborg to rescind llic resolution which il passed con
demning the (i ring of Leo Koch from the University of Illinois.
Seaborg commanded the Ex Com to <lo this under the Kerr
Directives which forbid student legislatures on all the I niversitv
<>( California campuses from taking stands on off-campus issues.
The Ex Com has refused to rescind its stand and has been up
held by the student Judicial Committee.
I he following is an editorial which appeared on the front page
of the Daily Californian on Friday, May 6. We feel it merits
notice.
"Student government at the I niversitv is no longer a govern
ment: il is an "official organ of the I niversitv* according to the
latest pronouncement of the Chancellor's office.
""Student government at Berkeley i> facing a crisis, one v\liicli
could either make or break it.
"Yesterday Chancellor Seaborg called a closed meeting of the
Executive Committee to discuss its recent violation of the Kerr
I )i re â€¢dives.
"'Chancellor Seaborg v\a.- not present at the meeting but \ ice
Chancellor Alex Sherriffs lold Ex Com to rescind its action which
violated Ihe direct iv es.
"Sherriffs also said that student government is on I \ an admin
istrative arm of the University administration.
"We disagree v\ itli this concept of student government. Student
government should be the official governmental bodv of the stu
dents, not a puppet of the administration.
"'Ex Com was also told that if did not rescind its action, a draft
lie change in student government might occur, that il might he
come another I CI,A of 19f)6 (where the I CEA Chancellor took
over student government and I lie student newspaper for a few
years) .
"The Chancellor has the righl to veto any action of Ex Com.
And the Chancellor should veto the motion himself rathcr.than
forcing Ex Com to back down from a stand il has taken.
"The issue lias become more than academic freedom at the
I niversitv of Illinois, more than the right of Ex (loin to lake stands
on off-campus issues.
""The issue is whether or not Ex Com lias the right to inde
pendent action, whether or not Ex Com is a puppet of the ad
ministration.
"Ex Com must not rescind the motion.
"Ex Com can either go out with a bang or with a whimper.
"\\ e would prefer to see it go out with a bang.
\\ e commend the action of ihe Ex Com in standing on its prin
ciples. We feel that Chancellor Seaborg acted unwiselv in ordering
Ex Com to rescind its resolution, and v\e think that the Kerr Direc
tives represent a needless and narrow-minded attempt to control
student thought and action. We, too. hope lliat if the Ex Com goes
out, it exits with a bang and one that reverberates loudly in the
ears of Drs. Seaborg and Kerr.
