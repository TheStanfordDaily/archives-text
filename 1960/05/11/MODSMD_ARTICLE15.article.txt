# House Committee Returns After Cancelling Last Year
## 
### John Simmons Dick White Contributing Editor 
The House Committee on Un-
American activities is coming to
San Francisco tomorrow to in
vestigate Communist activities in
Northern California.
Ii has subpoenaed 48 people for
its hearings to be held in the San
Francisco City Hall.
Repeating last year's perform
ance. the Committee has begun to
reschedule its date for the hear
ings, which was originally Tues
day.
Last summer when the Commit
tee came to town, it subpoenaed
110 people for hearings to be held
in June, but these were resched
uled throughout the summer and
were finally cancelled entirely,
leaving the 110 without a chance
to clear themselves.
Cancellation of the hearings re
sulted from the unprecedented
public censure of the Committee
and its methods.
Old Practice
The San Francisco Chronicle, in
an editorial, said: "Forty North
ern California teachers (plus 70
in Southern California) who are
under subpoena and whose names
have been made public (though
not printed by this newspaper)
stand accused with no opportunity
to clear themselves. This kind of
procedure is hardly in accord with
the besi American practice, though
it is not new with the House Un-
American Activities Committee."
The Rt. Rev. Bishop James A.
Pike, Episcopal Bishop of the
State of California, said: "The in
vestigating procedure of ihe Un-
American Activities Committee
has proven to be so threatening
to the public welfare of countless
individuals that the public con
science is and must therefore be
outraged."
The California State Labor Fed
eration, AFL-CIO, made this in
dictment : "One of the greatest
violators of civil liberties has been
the House Un-American Activities
Committee which has repeatedly

j used the subversive issue as a ve
hicle for obtaining newspaper
headlines without regard for our
j cherished American institutions
of speech and assemblv and the
Constitutional rights of individu
als."
This was not the only criticism
|of the Committee. The Friends
j Committee on Legislation of
! Southern California, Elea no r
Roosevelt, tlie California Demo
cratic Council, the St. Louis Post
; Dispatch, the Washington Post,
the American Federation of
Teachers and the San Francisco
News-Call Bulletin all joined in
denouncing the- Committee's ac
t ivities.
Injunction Suit
After the cancellation of the
| hearings, the American Civil Lib
erties Union filed an injunction
; suit to keep the Committee from
turning its files over to the Cali
fornia State Board of Education.
In order to beat the injunction,
the Committee dumped the files
i of more than 90 of the subpoenaed
witnesses in Sacramento.
At the request of the Superin
-1 tendent of the Board of Educa
tion, the files were given to At
torney-General Stanley Mosk, who
said that he would give the matter
j careful study and keep the con
tents of the files confidential un
til the courts had reached a deei
j sion on the Committee's rights to
i distribute 1 he files.
Mosk concluded that the files
were worthless as evidence since
the authors of the information
were not identified.
Copies of Files
Undaunted by this statement,
the Committee had copies of the
' files sent directly to officials in
counties in which the teachers
were employed.
The raincheck of last year's
performance is now upon us: the
Committee is returning.
It has subpoenaed no one who
! was fired after last summer's
episode. This is graphic proof
that the Committee is interested
only in intimidation and threats
I and not in the dangers they claim
to be investigating.
