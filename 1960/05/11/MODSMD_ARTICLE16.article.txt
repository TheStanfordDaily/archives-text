## The 						Serious Humorist 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
Jules Feiffer has done it again.
The man, it seems, is infallible.
A new hook appeared in the
Stanford Bookstore (and else
where) last week or so, a book
entitled "The Explainers," subti

. . Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Feiffer is a cartoonist; his
books arc paperbacks. But in re
ality Ins cartoons are more cap
tions than drawings, and his cap
tions are more socio-econoinic-re
ligio - politico • psychological com
mentary than more quips.
Ffeiffer calls himself a "serious,
humorist" who "writes" cartoons.
He draws with a pared stick, and
he usually gets the drawings right
on the first try. He finds, how
ever, that he must rewrite cap
tions up to 115 times.
Feiffer is a slight, introspective
New Yorker who until two years
agej had appeared only in the Vil
lage Voice, Greenwich Village's
weekly rag sheet. And there with
out pay.
Today his cartoons (syndicated
by the Hall Syndicate along with
Herbloek and Pogo) appear in the
London Observer, the Boston
Globe, the Minneapolis Star-Trib
une, the Newark Star Ledger, the
Detroit Free Press, the San Fran
cisco Examiner, and on and on
and on to .SO papers.
Feiffer has a provision in his
contract which other writers sim
ply do not enjoy: not a word of a
cartoon of his can be changed by
the syndicated paper-s.
His first book, "Sick, Sick,
! Sick," sells 5,000 copies a week
j and has now been published in
I England.
It contains some of the most
I incisive comments on modern life
i ever written.
"Fassionella and Other Stories,"

i the second masterpiece, is a col
lection of longer cartoon-stories,
Passionella being 1 a chimney
sweep who is turned into a movie
star by her fairy godmother.
This hook's hardest hitting com
ment, surpassing even Passion
ella, is the story about the "black
specks" that keep falling from the
sky.
He was born in tho Bronx in
1930. His father held a variety of
jobs from dental technician to
! salesman, and his mother was a
fashion designer.
Feiffer says that echoes of his
j childhood keep creeping into his
work. "I'm sneaky I hide behind
! my pictures."
When he graduated from high
| school, he was lacking a half
i credit to get into college. He de
cided it wasn't worth the effort to
make it up, and promptly went 1o
, work as a cartoonist's assistant.
He was drafted into the Korean
: War and finished as a PFC. Said
1 he."I didn't want them to give
me anything."
Feiffer lives in an apartment in
Brooklyn Heights, writing for the
Village Voice, making penetrating
I observations on the mores of ur
ban, suburbian, exurbian etc. life,
and acting as one of the most en
! tertaining satirists around.
