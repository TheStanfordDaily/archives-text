Letter to Mosk
Editor, The Daily:
The following letter lias been
i sent to Attorney General Stanley
| Mosk:
"The undersigned p e r so n s,!
members of the Executive Com
mittees of the Stanford Univer
sity and San Jose State College
Chapters of the American Asso
ciation of University Professors,
would like to bring to your atten-j
tion a fundamental issue involved
in the forthcoming hearings be
fore the House of .Representatives
j Un-American Activities Commit
tee.
"Among the persons,who have
been subpoenaed to appear before I
the committee are a number of j
teachers. Without any judgment
i concerning the innocence or guilt
j of these individuals, it is clear
| that great dangers to effective;
education are inherent in the
hearing itself. As Chief Justice
Earl Warren has said, 'Scholar
ship cannot flourish in an atmo
sphere of suspicion and distrust.
Teachers and s t u d en t s must
always remain free to inquire,
to study and to evaluate, to gain
new maturity and understanding;
otherwise our civilization will
j stagnate and die.'
"Unfortunately, as Professor|
! Ralph Fuchs pointed out in a I
brief submitted to the Supreme
Court by the A.A.U.P., there is â€¢
' a 'tendency of investigations such
| as those of the Un-American Ac
tivities Committee to lead stu
dents in particular to prefer a
posture of safety to the exercise
of their freedoms.'
"As teachers, we can attest 1o
the accuracy of these statements
' by Chief Justice Warren and Pro
-1 fessor Fuchs, and we therefore
urge you to take every possible
step to protect the rights of
teachers and other citizens who
have been subpoenaed to appear
I before this committee."

Functional Building
Editor, the Daily:
Those of us who have spent this
past year in study and research ;
of what specific facilities must go
into a Union appropriate for Stan
ford have noticed several mis
! statements of fact and some sig
nificant omissions in the series of
four articles of the Tresidder
! Union as presented in last week's
; issues of the Daily.
First of all, the articles inrli
j cated that with the inclusion of
the bowling, billiards and table
: tennis areas, the rift between the
academic and social spheres of j

I Stanford life would be widened,
rather than narrowed.
This would be the case if the
recreational area*; were the only
areas to be included. However, the
articles have failed to discuss the
two 2,000 square-foot lounges of
cultural and intellectual pro
grams, such as debates, speakers,
discussions, music recitals and
concerts, will be held.
The articles make no mention
i of the continuous art exhibits
which will be displayed, nor of
the art print and record libraries
which will be accessible to every
one. Only four words are used in
j listing the more than 4,000 square
feet devoted to student organi/.a-
I tions.
I The discrepancy between the
150-seat spectator space in the
j bowling area, and the 26-person
| capacity reading room is mislead
ing. In noting that discrepancy,
the articles ignore the fact that
the two lounges will provide read
ing and contemplative space for
j hundreds of people. The reading
room, which will hold 3."5 people,
is merely to serve as a center for
the good books and periodicals
which will be found in the new
union. And Ihe 150 seats in Ihe
bowling area are mostly for the
participants.
The Jast article, appearing in
Friday's' Daily, deprecated the
'idea' of a university-sponsored

TGIF party in the new Union.
There lias been no thought of de
sire given to such a university
sponsored activity to take place in
Tresidder. All activities of this
nature will come as a result of
student intci-est and student plan
ning.
We are confident that the com
ponents as suggested will nroduce
an attractive, functional building
which will indeed house "a social,
cultural, recreational and intel
lectual program for the whole
campus.

Plea of Guilt
Kditor, i lie Daily:
The tyranny of ihe United
States go v e r n m en t in world
affairs has too long passed un
noticed. Let us hope that the
American people are silent only
because of their awe at the atro
ciousness of t heir co un try ' s
crimes against mankind.
They must consider war and
destruction war into which they
may plunge the world without its
consent to be a crime to which
none can plead innocent.
