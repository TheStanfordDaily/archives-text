# LOST SHIP
## Hate, Prejudice Tear East Mediterranean 
### Fran Fisher 
Editor's note: Fran Fisher, for
mer Daily staffer, is now travel
ling in the Mediterranean and has
sent this story direct to the Daily.
If an observer noted our ship,
the S.S. Excalibur, as it zigzagged
across the eastern Mediterranean,
he would think it was a lost ship
wandering at sea.
We were bound for the sites of
ancient civilization Thebes, Me
mphis, Luxor, Crete.
The demons Odysseus encoun
tered in his travels in the same
area are gone, but as long as there
are hale and prejudice in the Near
East, no traveller can be certain
of his destination.
Near the end of April an Ameri
can ship was denied flesh water
at the Suez Canal by the Egyptian
authorities because it had previ
ously (locked at an Israeli port.
The New York Seaman's Union
retaliated by picketing the Egyp
lion 112 re i g h t e r, the Cleopatra,
which was docked in New York.
Although the seamen had nothing
to do with Ihe Egyptian line, the
New York longshoremen refused
to cross the picket line, and the
ship remained unloaded.
Nassar Refuses
Nassar, with his government
controlled state, could not con
ceive of this action being taken
without the order or at least the
consent of the U.S. Government,
so he has refused to unload Am
erican ships in Egyptian port s.
Our American Export Line ship,
carrying 50 passengers and a va
ried cargo, had left Naples Mon
day evening, Mav 2, bound for

Alex, as the seamen call the an
cient port of Alexandria. We knew
of anti-American riots there and
rumors flew thick and fast among
both passengers and crew about
how tlie trouble would affect us.
II owev e r, speculations ended
i abruptly when, on May 4, Bernie
Garland, the Chief Purser, posted
this note: "This vessel will not
j call at Alexandria."
We felt the sudden change in
j weather as we turned from our
| southeast direction to due east,
heading for Beirut, Lebanon. Our
i ship had been pitching and rock
ing in Ihe teeth of a 42-mile-an
hour gale, but the change in
I course caused us to be in calm
I seas and balmy sun within an
, hour.
Sympathy tor L'.A.K.
Knowing the Lebanese sympa
thies for t lie United Aral) Repub
lic, we now speculated on the pos
sibility of our not being allowed i
to dock at Beirut. And on the j
evening of May 4, Captain Ellis
received this cablegram: "Leba-1
nese Government requests you j
not call at Beirut."
Again we changed our course, 1
swinging around the eastern tip j
of Crete, bound for Piraeus, the ,
port of Athens. The Purser's bill- j
let in now read, "The vessel's des-j
tination is now Piraeus."
All was in an uproar as passen
gers who had made plans months
in advance sent cables all over the !
world.
Grece appears to be friendly -
let us hope we don't lose their
friendship. Even Odysseus had
I some friends in his journeys.
