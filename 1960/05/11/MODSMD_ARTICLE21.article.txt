### Doug Willis 
The case of Smith vs. the Apex
Finance Company tried be
fore San Mateo County Superior
Court Judge Wayne R. Millington
Saturday.
A jury of 13 undergraduates
heard student lawyers for Smith
and the finance company argue on
five legal actions, and a battery of
student witnesses were examined
and cross-examined in a sober
courtroom on tlie third floor of
the Law School.
â€¢ This full-scale Moot Court mock
trial was presented by the 1 Stan
ford Law School and was com
plete in every detail.
On March 30 a group of volun
teer students were assigned roles
in a hypothetical situation which
led to the suit tried Saturday.
Each person was then shown
films of what he "saw" when the
Apex Finance Company repos
sessed Smith's car.
The films viewed by witnesses
and principals a different film
for each participant show two
collectors from the Apex Finance
Company who appear at the
house of John Smith.
Smith is two months behind on
his car payments. When a collec
tor tells Smith that he has to give
up the car, he refuses. One of the
collectors grabs the keys and
takes the car while the other
holds Smith. Smith's mother-in
law, who lias watched the action,
has a heart attack.
Student lawyers Beach Kuhl
and Art Varden represented plain
tiff Smith. They charged the fi
nance company With assault and
battery, defamation and inten
tional conduct that caused emo
tional stress for Smith's mother
in-law, leading to bodily harm.
Witnesses on the stand gave
conflicting testimony during ex
amination and cross-examination
a hurdle introduced in the con
flicting films.
Neighbor Pauline Pcotter tesii
fied that when the second collec

tor held Smith that "they wres
tled on the ground 1 didn't see
any blows."
"They hit each other several
times, the collector hit John first,"
said mother-in-law Barbara Mor
lan.
"He grabbed me from behind, 112
broke away and hit him once,"
said Phil DeCaro, who saw
Smith's view of the action.
"Smith slugged Tony," said col
lector Ed Laing. "He had mo
around the neck, then got me
down on the ground and slugged
me," said the other collector, Tony
Trepel.
The jury ruled, after almost an
hour and one-half of deliberation
for the defendant finance com
pany, and allowed no damages.
Another trial will take place
Saturdav morning with an en
tirelv different cast.
