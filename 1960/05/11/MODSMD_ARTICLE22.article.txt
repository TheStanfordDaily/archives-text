# U.S. Plane Incident Gives Russians Summit Weapon
## 
### 
The United States has handed I
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrush-I
chev an excuse for failure at tlie
summit .just when he may be'
looking for one, and just at a \
time when the terrible danger
attending the arms race has once
again been paramounted.
As for the exact situation re-j
gai'ding the plane incident, a num
ber of questions remained to be i
answered. Some of them, involv
ing espionage practices, may not
be answered at all.
But one result is clear. An im
portant weapon on the allied side
in the cold war has been the
reputation of the United States
for trustworthiness. That reputa
tion has been damaged by the
devious and speculative first
attempts to explain away the
Powers flight.
At the same time, the long
standing charges against Soviet
trustworthines have been dulled.
America's allies now are ex
pressing feelings about her
closely akin to the one she ex
pressed against Britain and
France in the Suez matter in 19/>G.
They are afraid her position
! at the summit table has been

weakened just when agile lead
ership was needed.
American aerial reconnaissance
over tiie Soviet Union has been
reported intermittently tor years.
With indications that the Soviets
had not complained because they
would not publicly admit an in
ability to stop it.
Hut reports of a rising curve
of espionage activity on ;ill sides
have piled up this year. The FBI
says Soviet spying has reached a
peak in the United States and on
the high seas. Japan, West Ger
many and all countries with im
portant military establishments
have experienced it.
Amid such tension, the Soviets
see an American plane penetrate
hundreds of miles into their terri
tory, and the world asks "What
could come next?"
If Khrushchev has wanted a
summit conference merely for the
purpose of putting the West in a
hole in the cold war, his cause
has been aided. But the danger
|of cold war and arms race has
i been newly highlighted. Perhaps
I fear can do something about stop
ping both.
