### JOHN SCHWARZ 
The One That Never Developed
One column I was very interested in writing this year but was
unable to gather the necessary statistics to do justice to, was a
comparative study of the grade point averages of the various Stan
lord athletic teams. Two reasons come to my mind why this would
have been an interesting study, at least to me. First of all, since I'm
primarily a tennis writer, as I guess is supposed to be evident by
the somewhat suggestive title of this column, I was impressed with
the fact that the over-all average of this year's first-string tennis
team is slightly above three point, an average that would fare well
against any women's living group on campus no less against the
sparkling grades of our footballers, baseballers or trackmen.

Seeondly, I thought this column
might be interesting, because
when Stanford athletics have as
disastrous a year as this one has
been, the first rationalization of
most alumni, players, and follow
ers, is always something to the
effect that, well, we have intelli
gent athletes anyway even if they
don't win games. This probably
is true, but it would certainly be
reassuring to see this rationaliza
tion .justified in the hard cold
facts from the registrar's office.
Taking the study a little out of
campus and placing it on an inter
collegiate level I think most ob
servers, the unbiased as well as
myself, would agree that the
Stanford athlete is a rare animal
(I use this term loosely) in col
lege athletics as he is for the most
part an intellectually curious as
well as a physically capable indi
vidual. Not that athletes at other
schools aren't intelligent, it's just
that the Stanford athlete seems
to put more pride and desire in

being something other than a football player or swimmer. This
should serve as a proper brainwashing for all those intent on being
red-hot alumni and living in highly partisan USC or Cal neighbor
hoods.
This Friday and Saturday Stanford's tennis team, if I can return
to the subject for which I guess most of you are reading this column,
are playing two of the best, if not the best, college tennis teams in
the nation. UCLA and USC, which always have the great ones and
are loaded again this year. I don't know an awful lot about the IQ's
of the members of their teams, but the tennis IQ's of these two
teams could be classified in the genius level.
Most of the class in the Los Angeles teams lies in the fact that
almost everyone of the players on both the Bruin and Trojan squads
has had umpteen years of good hard', tennis experience, a vital essen
tial to-success in the net game.
UCLA has three players that have played the Eastern circuit in
the summer and have been able to garner top-notch national rankings.
Larry Nagler, Alan Fox, and Roger Werksman are all in the nation's
top thirty in amateur tennis. Norm Perry, a fourth member of the
squad, is practically an equal in experience and ability to his team
mates, but has kept his tournament play for the most part restricted
to Southern California play and is therefore not sufficiently known
for national ranking.
The Big Time
The SC -squad has a few boys who have also made the rounds in
the bigtime. Greg Grant has been playing tennis in tough competi
tion for several years. A couple of years older than most of his
teammates and opponents, he has that much more behind him. Talk
ing about Grant, he is probably one of the greatest athlete tennis
players around. The solid Trojan first man resembles a football full
back and hits some of the most powerful strokes in collegiate tennis.
Along with Grant the Trojans have a thoroughly experienced duo
in Bob Delgado and Ed Atkinson. Both players have taken the East
ern swing in the summer and each has been brought up with a regu
lar diet of tennis. Al Tong another Trojan ace was last year's Na
tional Public Park's Champion.
With talent like this there seems to be little hope for the less
experienced players that make up the Stanford squad. However,
Stanford, although not holding many wins over the Southern Cali
fornians, always manages to make the matches interesting if not
down-right exciting. Last year against UCLA the Indians grabbed
the first set in six of the nine matches and though the final score
was 8-1. UCLA, no one went home feeling he hadn't gotten his
money's worth.
For the tennis fan who wants to watch this weekend in hopes
that he or she might pick up a few pointers which would help im
prove their game, I can suggest a few players to watch.
On Friday, Ed Atkinson of USC will display one of the best serve
and volley sequences around. He is a master at a high volley shot.
Bob Delgado of the same Trojan team has one of the best overheads
in college tennis. Al Tong on the other hand, ha-s one of t lie best lobs.
On Saturday Roger Werksnian's forehand is pretty tougli, Alan Fox
another Bruin covers net and volleys as well as anyone around in
college circles. On Stanford's team one might watch Jim Jeffries'
ground strokes, Dick Gould's service return, or Dick Ogden's tre
mendous shot anticipation.

of the members of their teams, but the tennis IQ's of these two
teams could be classified in the genius level.
Most of the class in the Los Angeles teams lies in the fact that
almost everyone of the players on both the Bruin and Trojan squads
has had umpteen years of good hard', tennis experience, a vital essen
tial to-success in the net game.
UCLA has three players that have played the Eastern circuit in
the summer and have been able to garner top-notch national rankings.
Larry Nagler, Alan Fox, and Roger Werksman are all in the nation's
top thirty in amateur tennis. Norm Perry, a fourth member of the
squad, is practically an equal in experience and ability to his team
mates, but has kept his tournament play for the most part restricted
to Southern California play and is therefore not sufficiently known
for national ranking.
The Big Time
The SC -squad has a few boys who have also made the rounds in
the bigtime. Greg Grant has been playing tennis in tough competi
tion for several years. A couple of years older than most of his
teammates and opponents, he has that much more behind him. Talk
ing about Grant, he is probably one of the greatest athlete tennis
players around. The solid Trojan first man resembles a football full
back and hits some of the most powerful strokes in collegiate tennis.
Along with Grant the Trojans have a thoroughly experienced duo
in Bob Delgado and Ed Atkinson. Both players have taken the East
ern swing in the summer and each has been brought up with a regu
lar diet of tennis. Al Tong another Trojan ace was last year's Na
tional Public Park's Champion.
With talent like this there seems to be little hope for the less
experienced players that make up the Stanford squad. However,
Stanford, although not holding many wins over the Southern Cali
fornians, always manages to make the matches interesting if not
down-right exciting. Last year against UCLA the Indians grabbed
the first set in six of the nine matches and though the final score
was 8-1. UCLA, no one went home feeling he hadn't gotten his
money's worth.
For the tennis fan who wants to watch this weekend in hopes
that he or she might pick up a few pointers which would help im
prove their game, I can suggest a few players to watch.
On Friday, Ed Atkinson of USC will display one of the best serve
and volley sequences around. He is a master at a high volley shot.
Bob Delgado of the same Trojan team has one of the best overheads
in college tennis. Al Tong on the other hand, ha-s one of t lie best lobs.
On Saturday Roger Werksnian's forehand is pretty tougli, Alan Fox
another Bruin covers net and volleys as well as anyone around in
college circles. On Stanford's team one might watch Jim Jeffries'
ground strokes, Dick Gould's service return, or Dick Ogden's tre
mendous shot anticipation.

The One That Never Developed
One column I was very interested in writing this year but was
unable to gather the necessary statistics to do justice to, was a
comparative study of the grade point averages of the various Stan
lord athletic teams. Two reasons come to my mind why this would
have been an interesting study, at least to me. First of all, since I'm
primarily a tennis writer, as I guess is supposed to be evident by
the somewhat suggestive title of this column, I was impressed with
the fact that the over-all average of this year's first-string tennis
team is slightly above three point, an average that would fare well
against any women's living group on campus no less against the
sparkling grades of our footballers, baseballers or trackmen.

Seeondly, I thought this column
might be interesting, because
when Stanford athletics have as
disastrous a year as this one has
been, the first rationalization of
most alumni, players, and follow
ers, is always something to the
effect that, well, we have intelli
gent athletes anyway even if they
don't win games. This probably
is true, but it would certainly be
reassuring to see this rationaliza
tion .justified in the hard cold
facts from the registrar's office.
Taking the study a little out of
campus and placing it on an inter
collegiate level I think most ob
servers, the unbiased as well as
myself, would agree that the
Stanford athlete is a rare animal
(I use this term loosely) in col
lege athletics as he is for the most
part an intellectually curious as
well as a physically capable indi
vidual. Not that athletes at other
schools aren't intelligent, it's just
that the Stanford athlete seems
to put more pride and desire in

being something other than a football player or swimmer. This
should serve as a proper brainwashing for all those intent on being
red-hot alumni and living in highly partisan USC or Cal neighbor
hoods.

On Friday, Ed Atkinson of USC will display one of the best serve
and volley sequences around. He is a master at a high volley shot.
Bob Delgado of the same Trojan team has one of the best overheads
in college tennis. Al Tong on the other hand, ha-s one of t lie best lobs.
On Saturday Roger Werksnian's forehand is pretty tougli, Alan Fox
another Bruin covers net and volleys as well as anyone around in
college circles. On Stanford's team one might watch Jim Jeffries'
ground strokes, Dick Gould's service return, or Dick Ogden's tre
mendous shot anticipation.

Good Ground Strokes
The One That Never Developed
One column I was very interested in writing this year but was
unable to gather the necessary statistics to do justice to, was a
comparative study of the grade point averages of the various Stan
lord athletic teams. Two reasons come to my mind why this would
have been an interesting study, at least to me. First of all, since I'm
primarily a tennis writer, as I guess is supposed to be evident by
the somewhat suggestive title of this column, I was impressed with
the fact that the over-all average of this year's first-string tennis
team is slightly above three point, an average that would fare well
against any women's living group on campus no less against the
sparkling grades of our footballers, baseballers or trackmen.

Seeondly, I thought this column
might be interesting, because
when Stanford athletics have as
disastrous a year as this one has
been, the first rationalization of
most alumni, players, and follow
ers, is always something to the
effect that, well, we have intelli
gent athletes anyway even if they
don't win games. This probably
is true, but it would certainly be
reassuring to see this rationaliza
tion .justified in the hard cold
facts from the registrar's office.
Taking the study a little out of
campus and placing it on an inter
collegiate level I think most ob
servers, the unbiased as well as
myself, would agree that the
Stanford athlete is a rare animal
(I use this term loosely) in col
lege athletics as he is for the most
part an intellectually curious as
well as a physically capable indi
vidual. Not that athletes at other
schools aren't intelligent, it's just
that the Stanford athlete seems
to put more pride and desire in

being something other than a football player or swimmer. This
should serve as a proper brainwashing for all those intent on being
red-hot alumni and living in highly partisan USC or Cal neighbor
hoods.
This Friday and Saturday Stanford's tennis team, if I can return
to the subject for which I guess most of you are reading this column,
are playing two of the best, if not the best, college tennis teams in
the nation. UCLA and USC, which always have the great ones and
are loaded again this year. I don't know an awful lot about the IQ's
of the members of their teams, but the tennis IQ's of these two
teams could be classified in the genius level.
Most of the class in the Los Angeles teams lies in the fact that
almost everyone of the players on both the Bruin and Trojan squads
has had umpteen years of good hard', tennis experience, a vital essen
tial to-success in the net game.
UCLA has three players that have played the Eastern circuit in
the summer and have been able to garner top-notch national rankings.
Larry Nagler, Alan Fox, and Roger Werksman are all in the nation's
top thirty in amateur tennis. Norm Perry, a fourth member of the
squad, is practically an equal in experience and ability to his team
mates, but has kept his tournament play for the most part restricted
to Southern California play and is therefore not sufficiently known
for national ranking.
The Big Time
The SC -squad has a few boys who have also made the rounds in
the bigtime. Greg Grant has been playing tennis in tough competi
tion for several years. A couple of years older than most of his
teammates and opponents, he has that much more behind him. Talk
ing about Grant, he is probably one of the greatest athlete tennis
players around. The solid Trojan first man resembles a football full
back and hits some of the most powerful strokes in collegiate tennis.
Along with Grant the Trojans have a thoroughly experienced duo
in Bob Delgado and Ed Atkinson. Both players have taken the East
ern swing in the summer and each has been brought up with a regu
lar diet of tennis. Al Tong another Trojan ace was last year's Na
tional Public Park's Champion.
With talent like this there seems to be little hope for the less
experienced players that make up the Stanford squad. However,
Stanford, although not holding many wins over the Southern Cali
fornians, always manages to make the matches interesting if not
down-right exciting. Last year against UCLA the Indians grabbed
the first set in six of the nine matches and though the final score
was 8-1. UCLA, no one went home feeling he hadn't gotten his
money's worth.
For the tennis fan who wants to watch this weekend in hopes
that he or she might pick up a few pointers which would help im
prove their game, I can suggest a few players to watch.
