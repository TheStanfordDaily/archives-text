# CARD ELEVEN SEEKS REVENGE
## Varsity to Meet Alumni Daily Sports 
### Russ Allen Sports Editor 
Stanford gridders are polishing
up their offensive and defensive
assignments this week in readi
ness for the annual Alumni-Var
sity game this Saturday at 3:45
p.m. in the, Stadium.
The griddeis want revenge for
last year's 23-14 defeat at the
hands of the Alumni but last
year's Alumni stars John Brodie
and Bill McColl will be back to
give them plenty of trouble, so
Coach Jack Curtice should have
his problems this weekend and
will have a few next season.
Last year he had a top quarter
back and several first-rate ends
but suffered from a lack of big,
experienced, interior linemen and
experienced backfield men. Next
season all the backs will return
but Curtice can't find any experi
enced pass catchers to grab the
throws of the talented Dick Nor
man.
Ends Gone
Four of the top six receivers
graduate this year and obviously
the biggest headache for Curtice
is finding replacements for the
likes of Chris Burford, Ben Rob
inson, Irv Nikolai, Dick Bowers,
etc.
Only George tjonore and Tom
McDonald are returning and Mc-

Donald has been out of most of
| spring practice. New faces in the
I end department this year will be
Rich Hearney, injured tor mosl
of last season; Steve Pursell,
Doug's "little" brother; Vic Preis
! ser, up from the Braves of 195G;
Chet Hinshaw, brother of co-cap
tain Dean, and Chris Jessen, two
| talented members of this year's
frosh team.
Strong at Tackle
However, as we move down the
line the grid picture brightens
j up considerably. Al tackles we
find Phil Toorvald from the '57
i frosh team and co-captain Dean
Hinshaw. These men are probably
the biggest starting tackles a
! Stanford coach has seen since
Paul Wiggin suited up. They are
J ably b a c k e d by C.B. Simons,
Frank Atkinson, Bob Drakulich,
Chuck Buehler and Jon Brandin
* no small men in the bunch. Sim
ons and Buehler were also line
stars on the Papooses this year.
At guard we find several re
turning lettermen. Ron Fernan
des, Don Peler, and Tom Walsh
I saw a lot of action last year and

should give passer Norman a lot
of protection, up the middle. Krrol
Scott, John Butler out with a
knee injury t his spring and
Steve Player, an outstanding Pa
poose lineman, give Curtice a lot
of important depth next season.
The lack of depth at guard was
his chief worry all last year.
Doug Pursell, Chris Cottle and
Jack Gordon are all returning
lettermen and make center the
most solid position in the line this
year. Pursell and Cottle were
definitely outstanding offensive
and linebacking stars last season

and Gordon was a pleasant sur
prise at tackle for Curtice.
Dick Norman, at quarterback,
is a definite All-American possi
bility next season and should only
be hold down by the length of
time it takes the receivers to de
velop. Dick is backed up by let
ter-winner Rod Sears and Bob
Price.
Backs Return
Experienced backs may give
Stanford the best ground attack
since the 1957 season. Skip Face,
out this spring; Mac VVylie, Gil
Dowd; John Bessey, Hal Steuber
and Archie Schmitt are all letter
winners and Bessey, Schmitt and
Wylie have gotten the starting
nods this Saturday.
This Saturday's game may
prove to be quite interesting with
the possibility of a ground attack
opening up if no one can catch
Norman's passes, but once again
the varsity will go into the tilt
as underdogs.

back and several first-rate ends
but suffered from a lack of big,
experienced, interior linemen and
experienced backfield men. Next
season all the backs will return
but Curtice can't find any experi
enced pass catchers to grab the
throws of the talented Dick Nor
man.
Ends Gone
Four of the top six receivers
graduate this year and obviously
the biggest headache for Curtice
is finding replacements for the
likes of Chris Burford, Ben Rob
inson, Irv Nikolai, Dick Bowers,
etc.
Only George tjonore and Tom
McDonald are returning and Mc-

Donald has been out of most of
| spring practice. New faces in the
I end department this year will be
Rich Hearney, injured tor mosl
of last season; Steve Pursell,
Doug's "little" brother; Vic Preis
! ser, up from the Braves of 195G;
Chet Hinshaw, brother of co-cap
tain Dean, and Chris Jessen, two
| talented members of this year's
frosh team.
Strong at Tackle
However, as we move down the
line the grid picture brightens
j up considerably. Al tackles we
find Phil Toorvald from the '57
i frosh team and co-captain Dean
Hinshaw. These men are probably
the biggest starting tackles a
! Stanford coach has seen since
Paul Wiggin suited up. They are
J ably b a c k e d by C.B. Simons,
Frank Atkinson, Bob Drakulich,
Chuck Buehler and Jon Brandin
* no small men in the bunch. Sim
ons and Buehler were also line
stars on the Papooses this year.
At guard we find several re
turning lettermen. Ron Fernan
des, Don Peler, and Tom Walsh
I saw a lot of action last year and

should give passer Norman a lot
of protection, up the middle. Krrol
Scott, John Butler out with a
knee injury t his spring and
Steve Player, an outstanding Pa
poose lineman, give Curtice a lot
of important depth next season.
The lack of depth at guard was
his chief worry all last year.
Doug Pursell, Chris Cottle and
Jack Gordon are all returning
lettermen and make center the
most solid position in the line this
year. Pursell and Cottle were
definitely outstanding offensive
and linebacking stars last season

and Gordon was a pleasant sur
prise at tackle for Curtice.
Dick Norman, at quarterback,
is a definite All-American possi
bility next season and should only
be hold down by the length of
time it takes the receivers to de
velop. Dick is backed up by let
ter-winner Rod Sears and Bob
Price.
Backs Return
Experienced backs may give
Stanford the best ground attack
since the 1957 season. Skip Face,
out this spring; Mac VVylie, Gil
Dowd; John Bessey, Hal Steuber
and Archie Schmitt are all letter
winners and Bessey, Schmitt and
Wylie have gotten the starting
nods this Saturday.
This Saturday's game may
prove to be quite interesting with
the possibility of a ground attack
opening up if no one can catch
Norman's passes, but once again
the varsity will go into the tilt
as underdogs.
