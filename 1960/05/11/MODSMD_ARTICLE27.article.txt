# Outburst Gives Indians Win Over Hornets
## 
### 
A nine-run outburst powered
j the Stanford varsity to a 13-7 vic
tory over the Sacramento State
' Hornets at the Sunken Diamond
1 yesterday.
The Indians, still in fourth place
in CIBA standings, face a rugged
weekend. They travel to Berkeley
for a Friday-the-13th encounter
with league-elading Cal and host
Santa Clara for a doubleheader
on Saturday.
In that wild first frame, the In
dians capitalized on seven hits and
three walks to push across the
nine tallies. The rally was spark
ed by doubles off the bats of Mike
Magoe, Hal Schutzmann, and Jay
Winter and a triple by John Hurl
but.
Hornet starter Gene Schroeder
gave up all nine runs and was
! mercifully removed- after facing
13 Indian butchers. A 1 Smith came
on and caught Jim Cowart look
ing on the third -strike to end the
inning.
Stanford starter Earl Russell
was coasting along comfortably
with a six-hitter until he weak

ened in t lie ninth. Hornet bats
men touched him up for two hits
and two walks good for three
runs. Rich Simpson came on to
bail him out, getting Darrell
Strickland on strikes.
Skip Lawrence continued to
wield the big bat for Stanford,
getting three hits good for two
RBl's. Jim Cowart, who seems to
have found himself a home at
first base, came through with two
hits including a long triple to
right in the sixth.
The Indians pounded Ihree Hor
net pitchers for 19 hits, seven of
which were for extra bases.
Third baseman Darrell McCro
rie and catcher Dean Andoe led
the Sacramento attack with two
hits apiece.
