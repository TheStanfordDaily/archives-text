# SUBMERGED
## Atom-Powered U.S. Sub Goes Around World 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P> The big
gray hull of a submarine, scum
streaked from S3 days submer
gence surfaced off the Delaware
coast at dawn yesterday. The USS
Triton was back from an epochal
around-the-world voyage beneath
all the earth's great oceans.
The Triton, a huge 7,750-ton sub
powered with two atomic engines,
had done in less than three
months what a sailing ship of
Ferdinand Magellan's fleet had
done in a three-year cruise more
than 420 years ago.
'Proud Day'
Aboard the Triton on her 41.-
519-mile voyage 30,708 of it rep
resenting the circumnavigation
route were 183 men, including
half a dozen scientists and tech
nicians.
It was another proud day for
the Navy, for Capt. Edward L.
Beach of the Triton and for
President Eisenhower.
The President welcomed Beach
at the White House, where he
was brought by helicopter from
his ship.
Eisenhower pinned the Legion
of Merit decoration on the crew
cut, square-jawed captain and told
him "maybe your White House
service didn't hurt." Beach served
for four years as Eisenhower's
naval aide four years in which
the captain privately fretted be
cause he wasn't at sea in a sub
marine.
Sub's Course
The Triton started from New
London, Conn., the Triton's home
port; moved southeastward
across the Atlantic to St. Paul's
Rock, an islet in the eastern At
lantic which Magellan passed
outward-bound from Cadiz, Spain,
Here the Triton changed her head
ing and steered off on the course
of the ancient navigator, follow
ing the route but faster and
deeper than any course of which
Magellan ever dreamed.
Down a ro un d stormy Cape
horn at South America's tip,
west w a r d across the broad
reaches of the South Pacific,
threading the straits of the East
Indies, steaming under the sun
and storm-touched Indian Ocean,
rounding the Cape of Good Hope
and up to pass St. Paul's Rocks
between Africa and South Ameri
ca and complete the submerged
navigation.
Moments of Worry
From there the Triton headed
to a point off Cadiz, took a cere
monial look through her peri
scope at Magellan's port of de
parture and then headed for the
United States.
Still, the Triton's voyage had
its moments of worry.
Explosion
There was an exciting moment
when an explosion-like sound sig
naled the failure of a hydraulic
line controlling the diving planes.
A submarine, driven along a 4. 20
or more miles per hour, could
dive deep and unchecked if the
diving planes fail. But a torpedo
man groped his way through the
compartment and shut off the
pressure. The trouble was re
paired and the Triton resumed
her journey.

There was an exciting moment
when an explosion-like sound sig
naled the failure of a hydraulic
line controlling the diving planes.
A submarine, driven along a 4. 20
or more miles per hour, could
dive deep and unchecked if the
diving planes fail. But a torpedo
man groped his way through the
compartment and shut off the
pressure. The trouble was re
paired and the Triton resumed
her journey.
WASHINGTON (/P> The big
gray hull of a submarine, scum
streaked from S3 days submer
gence surfaced off the Delaware
coast at dawn yesterday. The USS
Triton was back from an epochal
around-the-world voyage beneath
all the earth's great oceans.
The Triton, a huge 7,750-ton sub
powered with two atomic engines,
had done in less than three
months what a sailing ship of
Ferdinand Magellan's fleet had
done in a three-year cruise more
than 420 years ago.
'Proud Day'
Aboard the Triton on her 41.-
519-mile voyage 30,708 of it rep
resenting the circumnavigation
route were 183 men, including
half a dozen scientists and tech
nicians.
It was another proud day for
the Navy, for Capt. Edward L.
Beach of the Triton and for
President Eisenhower.
The President welcomed Beach
at the White House, where he
was brought by helicopter from
his ship.
Eisenhower pinned the Legion
of Merit decoration on the crew
cut, square-jawed captain and told
him "maybe your White House
service didn't hurt." Beach served
for four years as Eisenhower's
naval aide four years in which
the captain privately fretted be
cause he wasn't at sea in a sub
marine.
Sub's Course
The Triton started from New
London, Conn., the Triton's home
port; moved southeastward
across the Atlantic to St. Paul's
Rock, an islet in the eastern At
lantic which Magellan passed
outward-bound from Cadiz, Spain,
Here the Triton changed her head
ing and steered off on the course
of the ancient navigator, follow
ing the route but faster and
deeper than any course of which
Magellan ever dreamed.
Down a ro un d stormy Cape
horn at South America's tip,
west w a r d across the broad
reaches of the South Pacific,
threading the straits of the East
Indies, steaming under the sun
and storm-touched Indian Ocean,
rounding the Cape of Good Hope
and up to pass St. Paul's Rocks
between Africa and South Ameri
ca and complete the submerged
navigation.
Moments of Worry
From there the Triton headed
to a point off Cadiz, took a cere
monial look through her peri
scope at Magellan's port of de
parture and then headed for the
United States.
Still, the Triton's voyage had
its moments of worry.
