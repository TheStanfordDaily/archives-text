# Airman to Face USSR Trial; U.S. Pledges to Defend Allies
## Russ Deliver Stiff Protest 
### 
MOSCOW (/H) The Soviet
Union notified the United States
yesterday that Francis G. Pow
ers, pilot of the American spy
plane downed deep inside Russia
on May Day, "will be brought to
account under the laws of the
Soviet state."
This indication that the pilot
may undergo a trial for espio
nage. probably not long after the
end of the summit conference,
was contained in a stiff protest
delivered through the U.S. Em
bassy.
The Soviet government protest
ed what it called the espionage
reconnaissance flight of Powers'
high-flying Lockheed IJ2 jet.
Interview Asked
The United States countered
with a request for permission for
an embassy officer to interview
Powers, a 30-year-old Lockheed
test pilot from Pound, Va., who
is reported by the Russians to
have confessed lie was spying for
the Central Intelligence Agency.
The protest note was handed
by Foreign Minister Andrei Gro
myko to the U.S. charge d'af
faires, Edward L. Frcars, at the
Foreign Ministry.
It declared that "hostile acts of
American aviation which have
taken place numerous times in
relation to the Soviet Union are
not simply the result of the activ
ity of the military command of
the U.S.A. in various areas but
are an expression of a calculated
U.S.A. policy."
â€¢Premeditated'
"These violations are premedi
tated," it said. ". . . All this testi
fies that the government of the
U.S.A., instead of taking meas
ures to stop such action by Ameri
can aviation, the danger of which
has more than once been pointed
out by the Soviet government,
officially announces such action
as its national policy."
It said that the United Slates,
by sanctioning such action, aggra
vates international tension.
"Military intelligence activity
of one nation," the note declared,
"by means of intrusion of its air
craft into the area of another
country can hardly be called a
method for improving relations
and strengthening such."
Summit
The note touched at one point
on the summit meeting, to open
in Paris Monday.
"The government of the
U.S.S.R. regretfully states that,
while it undertakes everything
possible for the normalization
and improvement of the interna
tional situation, the government
of the U.S.A. follows a different
path," it said.
