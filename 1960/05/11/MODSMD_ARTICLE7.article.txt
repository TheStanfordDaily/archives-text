## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)—Tho Unit
ed States pledged yesterday to go
to the aid of its allies which might
be attacked by (he Soviet Union
for allowing American spy planes
to use its bases.
The State Department also ac
cused Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev of waging a cam
paign of threats and intimidation
against small countries innocent
of any wrongdoing.
. The State Department fired this
double-barreled reply to Khrush
chev's threat to aim Soviet rock
ets against any foreign bases
which serve as takeoff or landing
points for intelligence flights into
the Soviet Union.
War of Words
"There should be no doubt that
the United States will honor these
defense treaty commitments," the
State Department said.
This rejoinder came amid these
other developments in the war of
words over the American spy
plane downed in the Soviet Union
May 1:
1. The Soviets indicated in a
note to tlie United States that the
captured pilot, 30-year-old Francis
G. Powers, would be brought to
account under Soviet law.
"Forced Down"
2. Chairman Clarence Cannon
(D.-Mo.) of the House Appropria
tions Committee reported U.S. in
telligence planes have ranged as
far as 1,300 miles inside the So
viet Union in a series of espionage
flights since 1946.
Cannon, who heard the Central
Intelligence Agency chief, Allen
W. Dulles, at a secret briefing
Monday, said the high-altitude U2
plane had not been shot down by
a Soviel rocket as Khrushchev
claimed, but was forced down by
"some unforeseen and unavoida
ble mechanical or physiological
defect."
3. The State Department as
sured Japan that future U2 flights
from Japanese bases would be
"utilized only for legitimate and
normal purposes of weather ob
servation."
Conference
This assurance was clearly
aimed at quieting the storm in
the Japanese Diet which is now
considering ratification of a Japa
nese-American security treaty.
4. President Eisenhower, Vice
President Richard M. Nixon and
Secretary of State Christian A.
Herter conferred for 75 minutes

er tho talk had dealt with the spy
plane episode.
No Plans

press secretary, told newsmen
that the White House, as of yes
terday afternoon, had made no
plans for Eisenhower to address

hower will visit Japan and Korea
as scheduled next month even if
the internationally explosive
plane incident should lead him to
cancel plans for a trip to the So
viet Union. A White House

plane downed in the Soviet Union

Intelligence Agency chief, Allen
W. Dulles, at a secret briefing

plane had not been shot down by
a Soviel rocket as Khrushchev
claimed, but was forced down by
"some unforeseen and unavoida
ble mechanical or physiological
defect."

sured Japan that future U2 flights
from Japanese bases would be
