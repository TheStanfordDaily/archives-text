## McCord Commends Student Picketing; Active Group Forms NAACP Chapter 
### Sherry Welch 
Inspired and advised by Dr. Wil
liam McCord and t wo members of
the Palo Alio Chapter of the NA
ACP, the group of Stanford stu
dents which have ben picketing
the Woolwortii stores in the Stan
ford Shopping Center and Palo
Alto yesterday formed a chapter
of the NAACP.
Commending them for their
courageous action and great sense
ef social responsibility, Dr. Mc-
Cord, assistant professor of soci
ology, discussed the students' role
in the picketing of the chain
stores which discriminate against
Negroes in the South.
Picketing Effective
"The picketing aems to be hav
ing direct effect," said McCord.
"Just last Saturday a member of
Woolworth's personnel approach
ed the picketers and threatened
that each day the picketing con
tinues they would fire one Negro
working for them."
However, McCord advised the
students, it would be a great help
if they would form a student or
ganization or perhaps affiliate
with the NAACP. He said he re
alized the sense of "romantic in

dividualism" individual action
gave the picketers, but he stressed
that it would not lead to continu
ity of action.
The percentage of the students
in the present group are seniors
and graduate students who will
not be here to continue the work
of the group next year. And al
though the present issue will lose
its immediate significance, Mc-
Cord emphasized that there are
other issues toward which a group
of students interested in further
ing the Negro rights cause could
direct their energies.
He cited, in particular, the con
tinuing problem in the area, say
ing that students could use their
influence to push the state law
allowing Negroes to live in track
housing.
Student Action Needed
Citing instances in which stu
dent action would be profitable,
Mr. Emery Curtiss, president of
the Palo Alto Chapter of the NA
ACP, then said that the university
must realize its responsibility to
ward attracting and educating
members of minority groups.
Only through student recruiting
and endeavor to accept Negro stu

dents once they are accepted
would this prove possible.
Then, having been first assured
that they would maintain almost
absolute control over their ac
tions, the students voted to join
the national organization. They
have scheduled a meeting for next
Tuesday at 4:15 p.m. on the third
floor of the Women's Clubhouse
when they hope other students
who sympathize with their ideals
will join them to elect officers.

Then, having been first assured
that they would maintain almost
absolute control over their ac
tions, the students voted to join
the national organization. They
have scheduled a meeting for next
Tuesday at 4:15 p.m. on the third
floor of the Women's Clubhouse
when they hope other students
who sympathize with their ideals
will join them to elect officers.
Inspired and advised by Dr. Wil
liam McCord and t wo members of
the Palo Alio Chapter of the NA
ACP, the group of Stanford stu
dents which have ben picketing
the Woolwortii stores in the Stan
ford Shopping Center and Palo
Alto yesterday formed a chapter
of the NAACP.
Commending them for their
courageous action and great sense
ef social responsibility, Dr. Mc-
Cord, assistant professor of soci
ology, discussed the students' role
in the picketing of the chain
stores which discriminate against
Negroes in the South.
Picketing Effective
"The picketing aems to be hav
ing direct effect," said McCord.
"Just last Saturday a member of
Woolworth's personnel approach
ed the picketers and threatened
that each day the picketing con
tinues they would fire one Negro
working for them."
However, McCord advised the
students, it would be a great help
if they would form a student or
ganization or perhaps affiliate
with the NAACP. He said he re
alized the sense of "romantic in

dividualism" individual action
gave the picketers, but he stressed
that it would not lead to continu
ity of action.
The percentage of the students
in the present group are seniors
and graduate students who will
not be here to continue the work
of the group next year. And al
though the present issue will lose
its immediate significance, Mc-
Cord emphasized that there are
other issues toward which a group
of students interested in further
ing the Negro rights cause could
direct their energies.
He cited, in particular, the con
tinuing problem in the area, say
ing that students could use their
influence to push the state law
allowing Negroes to live in track
housing.
Student Action Needed

dent action would be profitable,

must realize its responsibility to
