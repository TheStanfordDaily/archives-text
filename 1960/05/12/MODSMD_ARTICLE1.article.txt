## Kennedy's Hopes High After Win 
### 
CHARLESTON, W.Va. <4 J >
The Democ r a 11 c presidential
hopes of Sen. John F. Kennedy
of Massachusetts soared high on
Ihe wings of a sweeping victory
in Tuesday's West Virginia pri
mary.
As the late returns mounted.
Kennedy continued to rack up
more than 60 per cent of the
vote in a Contest in which he
knocked Sen. Hubert H. Hum
phrey of Minnesota out of the
presidential nomination conten
tion.
With 2,615 of 2,750 precincts
tabulated the count stood: Ken
nedy 219.216; Humphrey 141,941.
Victory Significant
Kennedy's victory was impres
sive beyond the boundaries of
West Virginia because of the way
it was achieved. A Roman Catho
lic, he took on Humphrey, a Con
gregationalist, and thrashed him
soundly in a state where only 4.5
per cent of the population is
Catholic.
Flushed with victory, Kennedy
said this should settle the reli
gious issue which has caused
some Democratic leaders to op
pose his nomination on the
ground he could not win in No
vember.
"We discussed the matter of
religion, and in detail," Kennedy
told an informal news conference.
A 1 Smith Parallel
"This free discussion helped
dispose of that matter. I hope it
is disposed of now. I will not
object to discussing it again, but
1 hope now it won't be considered
an issue."
Some of Kennedy's critics were
bound to point, however, to the
parallel of what happened to A 1
Smith, a Catholic and the Demo
cratic nominee, in West Virginia
in 1925.
In that year Smith beat Sen.
James Reed (D-Mo.i by 81,739 to
76.796 in the primary but ran
behind his ticket and lost the
state to Republican Herbert
Hoover in the general election.
Neither Smith nor Reed cam
paigned in the state, which was
covered this time from mine shaft
to mountain lookout tower by
Kennedy and Humphrey.
