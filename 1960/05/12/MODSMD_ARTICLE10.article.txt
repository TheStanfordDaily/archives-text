# Spring Sing Story
## 
### 
When spring appears al Stanford, students' attention quickly
turns to thoughts of . . . tomorrow's Spring Sing.
Eighteen years ago Tom Howard, chairman of Rally Com, was
looking for an original project for his organization to sponsor during
spring quarter. He came up with the idea of a singing competition,
and it has been an annual affair ever since.
Nearly 3,400 people attended the first performance, at which the
Medical School and the Chi Omegas took top honors.
It was not until after World War II that the present name. "Spring
Sing," was given to the competition. Previously it had been called
"All University Sing'' and the "Spring Songfest."
In 1945 Spring Sing was made a part of the Senior Week activities,
but it has since been returned as a Rally Com function.
A huge street dance was held behind Memorial Auditorium in
conjunction with the 1947 Spring Sing. That year also featured a
carillon concert an unrehearsed community sing.
Several traditions are connected with Spring Sing. The match
lighting ceremony, which was first performed in 1949, has become
a highlight of the event. This year it will be held at the end of the
sing, rather than in the middle, followed by the Alma Mater.
Before this year the last appearance of the year's head cheer
leader has been a part of the program. This has been abolished due
to the change in election time of cheerleaders.
Several other changes will be initiated in Friday's version of
Spring Sing. This was tlu 4 first year that tryouts have been required,
which should cut flown the length of the program and improve the
quality.
