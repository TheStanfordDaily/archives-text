## Khrushchev Throws Doubt On Eisenhower Reception 
### 
MOSCOW (/P) Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev yesterday ex
pressed doubt whether President Eisenhower can be welcomed to
the Soviet Union next month.
"The Russian people would say I was mad to welcome a man who
sends spy planes over here like that," he told reporters.
Khrushchev said the ill-fated May Day espionage flight has "of

| course" changed his opinion of j
] the American President, whom he
i visited last September.
Khrushchev added the two of
| them can exchange views in Paris,
[ where they are to meet in the Big
Four summit conference Monday,'
j as to whether Eisenhower should 1
; come to Moscow. Eisenhower is 1
' due here June 10 on a tour taking
him on to Japan and South Ko-
I rea.
CIA Okays Spy Flight
The Premier -said the spy flight j
' had been approved by Allen W.
' Dulles, head of the Central Intel
; ligence Agency and under the di-
I rection of the President.
"Don't expect me to say after
I that what nice people these are,"
he said.
Khrushchev sidestepped a spe-!
j eifie question whether he would
! want Eisenhower to postpone the :
I visit.
See Ike in Paris
"J woidd not like to comment," !
he said. "We can exchange views |
; with the President on that in
| Paris."
Standing on a wicker chair at
| a display of "spy equipment"
j from the downed American flier,
I Francis G. Powers, in a hall where
i captured Nazi aircraft were exhib- J
; ited at the end of World War II, |
! Khrushchev said: "You know my
| friendly attitude toward the Presi
dent. My hopes have not been jus
tified. I am a human being. I
have feelings.
"Mad" to Welcome Ike
"The people of Russia are open
hearted. Can I urge the Russian
people to greet him as a dear
guest? The Russian people would
| say I was mad to welcome a man
who sends spy planes over here
; like that," he said.
! "Just imagine what would have
; been the reaction if, on the eve of
- my visit to America, we had sent
j a plane over the United States."
