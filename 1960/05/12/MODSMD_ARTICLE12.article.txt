# Ike Hits Russ Secrecy, OKs U.S. Espionage

### 
WASHINGTON (/P) President
Eisenhower denounced yesterday
a Soviet "fetish of secrecy" as a
major cause of world tension.
And he defended American espio
nage as a "distasteful but vital
necessity" to prevent massive
surprise attack.
Calm, poised, but firm, Eisen
hower once more challenged the
Soviet Union to join in opening
the skies to international aerial
inspection in order to guard
against sneak attacks. Moscow
again gave clear indications of
rejecting the idea.
Eisenhower chose his regular
news conference for his first pub
lic pronouncements relating to
the Soviet's May Day downing
of an American U2 jet plane on
an intelligence mission high and
deep in Soviet territory.
In a quick spur of the moment
reaction to a tough-talking speech
by Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko Wednesday morn
ing, the President said it is abso
lutely ridiculous to accuse the
United States of provocative acts,
since:
"We are looking to our own
security and defense and we have
no idea of promoting any kind of
conflict or war."
There were assurances from
the President that he still has
hopes for progress oti the great
issues dividing East and West at
tho summit conference starting
in Paris May 16.
He told reporters, too, that his
plans to visit the Soviet Union
in June remain unchanged â€” "I
expect to go."
