In the muddle and mess of the
affair of the spy plane there is
one critical question of particular
urgency and importance which
needs to be deall with. This is the
official statement made with the
President's approval that "it has
been established that insofar as
the authorities in Washington are
concerned there was no authoriza
tion for such flight as described
by Mr. Khrushchev."
If this is true, then Ihe com
mand of very dangerous military
missions is not securely and un
questionably in the hands of the
responsible authorities in Wash
ington in the hands, that is to
say, of the President, the Secre
tary of State, the Chiefs of Staff,
and ihe Director of Central Intel
ligence.
Who, then, has the authority?
If the authority to order a deep
penetration of Soviet territory
with a military reconnaissance
plane is in some headquarters
command not in Washington, how
do we know, how does the world
know, that the authority to strike
a blow is not also outside of Wash
ington?
In denying that, it authorized
the flight, the Administration has
entered a plea of incompetence.
For there can be no acceptable
excuse for an unauthorized flight
of this kind. The President cannot
afford to let the question of where
the responsibility to authorize
such flights resides go by without
an unequivocal answer. By word
and by deed he must remove all
doubt that the authority to com
mand in these dangerous matters
is in Washington and no where
else. The honor, the self-respect,
and the self-confidence of the
country demand it.
Although it is no doubt true
that the President did not him
self authorize this particular
flight, it is no doubt true also that
he knew such flights were being
made. The general public was
perhaps surprised to hear about
them. But for ihe Russians and
for others among us there was no
surprise at all.
Why, then, knowing fliat such
flights were being made, did the
President tail to realize the risks
of continuing them right up to
fhe meeting at the summit? Is it
because he was not paying suffi
cient attention? Is if because his

closest advisors were not paying
sufficient attention? It looks like
that. It seems as if the country
has been humiliated by absent
mindedness in the highest quar
ters of the government.
There is nothing shocking or
novel, of course, in the disclosure
that we have been spying on the
Russians. They have been spying
on us. Spying is in its very na
ture a dirty business, outside the
law and outside the moral code.
The only crime recognized in the
spy business is to be caught, al
though this crime can be com
pounded by lying about it and
then being caught in the lie itself.
In this affair, there is on the
record as we know it serious pri
ma-facie evidence, not of unusual
immorality but, of inefficiency.
Why did not the President forbid
all such flights when ihe summit
meeting was agreed to? It is not
enough to say that he did not au
thorize this flight. Why did he not
forbid it?
There is no reason to suspect,
also, that whoever did authorize
the flight and was responsible for
preparing it was unaware that
the Russians bad developed a mis
sile capable of knocking the plane
down. The equipment carried by
the pilot, file Soviet money and
the poison needle, suggests fliaf
he was prepared for a forced land
ing through engine trouble per
haps, after which lie would work
his way across country, or failing
that and having been caught,
would commit suicide.
What the pilot was not prepared
for was to have his plane disabled
by a Russian missile. For thi-s
meant that the Russians had him
spotted. Under these circum
stances once his plane had been
hit, his money and his poison nee
dle were useless. If he had killed
himself, if he had exploded his
plane, there would still have been
his corpse and the wreckage of
the plane 1,200 miles inside the So
viet Union.
It was a failure of Intelligence
not to realize that the Soviets had
a missile capable of knocking
down so high flying a plane. It
was inefficient not to take this
possibility into account as a fac
tor which greatly multiplied the
risks of making such a flight on
Ihe eve of the summit meeting,

such flights resides go by without
an unequivocal answer. By word
and by deed he must remove all
doubt that the authority to com
mand in these dangerous matters
is in Washington and no where
else. The honor, the self-respect,
and the self-confidence of the
country demand it.
Although it is no doubt true
that the President did not him
self authorize this particular
flight, it is no doubt true also that
he knew such flights were being
made. The general public was
perhaps surprised to hear about
them. But for ihe Russians and
for others among us there was no
surprise at all.
Why, then, knowing fliat such
flights were being made, did the
President tail to realize the risks
of continuing them right up to
fhe meeting at the summit? Is it
because he was not paying suffi
cient attention? Is if because his

closest advisors were not paying
sufficient attention? It looks like
that. It seems as if the country
has been humiliated by absent
mindedness in the highest quar
ters of the government.
There is nothing shocking or
novel, of course, in the disclosure
that we have been spying on the
Russians. They have been spying
on us. Spying is in its very na
ture a dirty business, outside the
law and outside the moral code.
The only crime recognized in the
spy business is to be caught, al
though this crime can be com
pounded by lying about it and
then being caught in the lie itself.
In this affair, there is on the
record as we know it serious pri
ma-facie evidence, not of unusual
immorality but, of inefficiency.
Why did not the President forbid
all such flights when ihe summit
meeting was agreed to? It is not
enough to say that he did not au
thorize this flight. Why did he not
forbid it?
There is no reason to suspect,
also, that whoever did authorize
the flight and was responsible for
preparing it was unaware that
the Russians bad developed a mis
sile capable of knocking the plane
down. The equipment carried by
the pilot, file Soviet money and
the poison needle, suggests fliaf
he was prepared for a forced land
ing through engine trouble per
haps, after which lie would work
his way across country, or failing
that and having been caught,
would commit suicide.
What the pilot was not prepared
for was to have his plane disabled
by a Russian missile. For thi-s
meant that the Russians had him
spotted. Under these circum
stances once his plane had been
hit, his money and his poison nee
dle were useless. If he had killed
himself, if he had exploded his
plane, there would still have been
his corpse and the wreckage of
the plane 1,200 miles inside the So
viet Union.
It was a failure of Intelligence
not to realize that the Soviets had
a missile capable of knocking
down so high flying a plane. It
was inefficient not to take this
possibility into account as a fac
tor which greatly multiplied the
risks of making such a flight on
Ihe eve of the summit meeting,

In the muddle and mess of the
affair of the spy plane there is
one critical question of particular
urgency and importance which
needs to be deall with. This is the
official statement made with the
President's approval that "it has
been established that insofar as
the authorities in Washington are
concerned there was no authoriza
tion for such flight as described
by Mr. Khrushchev."
If this is true, then Ihe com
mand of very dangerous military
missions is not securely and un
questionably in the hands of the
responsible authorities in Wash
ington in the hands, that is to
say, of the President, the Secre
tary of State, the Chiefs of Staff,
and ihe Director of Central Intel
ligence.
Who, then, has the authority?
If the authority to order a deep
penetration of Soviet territory
with a military reconnaissance
plane is in some headquarters
command not in Washington, how
do we know, how does the world
know, that the authority to strike
a blow is not also outside of Wash
ington?
In denying that, it authorized
the flight, the Administration has
entered a plea of incompetence.
For there can be no acceptable
excuse for an unauthorized flight
of this kind. The President cannot
afford to let the question of where
the responsibility to authorize
such flights resides go by without
an unequivocal answer. By word
and by deed he must remove all

law and outside the moral code.
The only crime recognized in the
spy business is to be caught, al
though this crime can be com
pounded by lying about it and
then being caught in the lie itself.
In this affair, there is on the
record as we know it serious pri
ma-facie evidence, not of unusual
immorality but, of inefficiency.
Why did not the President forbid
all such flights when ihe summit
meeting was agreed to? It is not
enough to say that he did not au
thorize this flight. Why did he not
forbid it?
There is no reason to suspect,
also, that whoever did authorize
the flight and was responsible for
preparing it was unaware that
the Russians bad developed a mis
sile capable of knocking the plane
down. The equipment carried by
the pilot, file Soviet money and
the poison needle, suggests fliaf
he was prepared for a forced land
ing through engine trouble per
haps, after which lie would work
his way across country, or failing
that and having been caught,
would commit suicide.
What the pilot was not prepared
for was to have his plane disabled
by a Russian missile. For thi-s
meant that the Russians had him
spotted. Under these circum
stances once his plane had been
hit, his money and his poison nee
dle were useless. If he had killed
himself, if he had exploded his
plane, there would still have been
his corpse and the wreckage of
the plane 1,200 miles inside the So
viet Union.
It was a failure of Intelligence
not to realize that the Soviets had
a missile capable of knocking
down so high flying a plane. It
was inefficient not to take this
possibility into account as a fac
tor which greatly multiplied the
risks of making such a flight on
Ihe eve of the summit meeting,

In the muddle and mess of the
affair of the spy plane there is
one critical question of particular
urgency and importance which
needs to be deall with. This is the
official statement made with the
President's approval that "it has
been established that insofar as
the authorities in Washington are
concerned there was no authoriza
tion for such flight as described
by Mr. Khrushchev."
If this is true, then Ihe com
mand of very dangerous military
missions is not securely and un
questionably in the hands of the
responsible authorities in Wash
ington in the hands, that is to
say, of the President, the Secre
tary of State, the Chiefs of Staff,
and ihe Director of Central Intel
ligence.
Who, then, has the authority?
If the authority to order a deep
penetration of Soviet territory
with a military reconnaissance
plane is in some headquarters
command not in Washington, how
do we know, how does the world
know, that the authority to strike
a blow is not also outside of Wash
ington?
In denying that, it authorized
the flight, the Administration has
entered a plea of incompetence.
For there can be no acceptable
excuse for an unauthorized flight
of this kind. The President cannot
afford to let the question of where
the responsibility to authorize
such flights resides go by without
an unequivocal answer. By word
and by deed he must remove all
doubt that the authority to com
mand in these dangerous matters
is in Washington and no where
else. The honor, the self-respect,
and the self-confidence of the
country demand it.
Although it is no doubt true
that the President did not him
self authorize this particular
flight, it is no doubt true also that
he knew such flights were being
made. The general public was
perhaps surprised to hear about
them. But for ihe Russians and
for others among us there was no
surprise at all.
Why, then, knowing fliat such
flights were being made, did the
President tail to realize the risks
of continuing them right up to
fhe meeting at the summit? Is it
because he was not paying suffi
cient attention? Is if because his

closest advisors were not paying
sufficient attention? It looks like
that. It seems as if the country
has been humiliated by absent
mindedness in the highest quar
ters of the government.
There is nothing shocking or
novel, of course, in the disclosure
that we have been spying on the
Russians. They have been spying
on us. Spying is in its very na
ture a dirty business, outside the
law and outside the moral code.
The only crime recognized in the
spy business is to be caught, al
though this crime can be com
pounded by lying about it and
then being caught in the lie itself.
