Editor, The Daily:
The Un-American Activities!
Committee (HUACi on May 121
in San Francisco, will add an
other to ils long series of inquisi-1
tions which began back in 1938.
; Character assassination and expo-1
sure to public shame are ihej
methods they have used and
there is no evidence that they
will not continue to use this
' method to obtain conformity.
There is no doubt that theyj
i have been successful in harras
i sing and "blasting" ihe lives of >
I countless of the 3500 or so people
who have been called before this I
type of committee as "witnesses." i
At present four people called!
before the UUAC, or the state j
counterparts, are serving jail |
sentences for basing their right j
to remain silent before these coin-!
mittees on the First Amendment.!
Thirty-two more have been cited!
| for contempt for the same offense
and are in danger of imprison-j
j ment.
| This list includes Lloyd Baren
! blatt, psychology instructor, Vas
j sar; Chandler Davis, mathemati
cian, Univ. of Michigan; Willard
Uphaus, lay minister; Peter See- j
ger, folk singer.
It is deplorable that people are |
being jailed for defending their
right to "stand silent before Con
gress on matters of thought, asso
ciation, and affiliation." Countless
others called before these com-!
mittees have lost their jobs or in
other ways have had their lives j
unfavorably altered.
However, it must be kept in 1
mind that it is not only those i
who are directly involved who are ]
harmed. In fact, the greatest
danger is to those not directly
involved. This was clearly stated j
in the Supreme Court's Watkins
decision, when it said:
"And when those forced reve
lations concern matters that are ,
unorthodox, unpopular, or even
hateful to the general public, the
reaction in the life of the witness
may be disastrous. . . . Nor does
the witness alone suffer the con
sequences.
"Those who are identified . . . |
are equally subject to public stig
ma, scorn and obloquy. Beyond
that, there is the more subtle and
immeasurable effect upon those :
j who tend to adhere to the most
i unorthodox and uncontroversial
i views and associations in order
, to avoid a similar fate at some 1
| future time."
This Committee is an instru
ment of fear and as such it is
tampering with the right of the
American people to think
through, in a free and objective
manner, the many complex and
perplexing problems facing us
and all of humanity.

Reason for Existence
Editor, The Daily:
The Supreme Court, in Dennis
vs. U.S. (1951) not only upheld
1 the activities of the Committee
on Un-American Activities, but it
: gave a reason for the existence
for such a Committee. Justice
Jackson, in his concurring opinion
with the Court, said, "The authors
of the clear and present danger

| test never applied it to a ease
like this . . . If applied as it is
( proposed here, it means that the
! Communist plotting is protected
during its period of incubation;
its preliminary stages of organi
zation and preparation are im
mune from the law; the Govern
ment can move only after immi
i nent action is manifest, when it
| would, of course, he too late . .
Hence, written into our Const i
' tutional Law is the Smith Act of
; 1940 along with the clear and
I probable danger doctrine. The
Supreme Court has established a
; need which was to be solved by
; the Committee on Un-American
Activities.
It is very simple to criticize
I the actions of this congressional
committee, to call it undemocratic
j and unconstitutional in its prac
tices. Yet are we going to ignore
i the need of some kind of a check
on the Communist Party, which
: has been written into our Con
stitution by the United States
i Supreme Court? So far I have
searched in vain for a new pro
; posal to replace the system our
I critics wish to abolish and to ful
j fill the need they have completely
| ignored. It is not enough to
I merely attack the status quo.

Deterrent Force
Editor, the Daily:
A direct outgrowth of the Am
erican people's belief that their
i system of government is better
! than Communism is their willing
j ness to defend it against Commu
nist threats.
In the absence of any concrete
i disarmament treaty, the current
! method of defense is based upon
the concept of a "deterrent retali
atory force." I submit that with
out the help of the CIA. the free
world would have no deterrent
I force at all.
The strength of a deterrent
I force does not depend upon so
many planes, missiles, etc., but
upon a well-informed plan of ac
tion, presently consisting of pre
determined flight destination and
refueling orders revised daily for
all SAC bombers.
Thus if you concede tho neces
sity of a deterrent force, you may
: criticize the ClA's methods in spe
cific instances but not its purpose
! â€”obtaining information. If you
do not concede the necessity of a
deterrent force, I would be inter
ested in what alternative you sug
; gest.
