# MARCEL CAMUS
## Another Adaptation Of Orpheus Theme 
### Alan Rosenthal 
The Orpheus theme is undoubt
edly one of the world's best and
the moderns know it. For Cocteau
Orpheus twice became a poet.
Anouilh conceived of him as an
accordionist, and Tennessee Wil
liams makes him a guitarist. â€¢
In "Black Orpheus," directed
by France's Marcel Camus from
the play by de Moraes, Orpheus
is a guitar playing bus conductor
whose music can cause the sun
to rise. The setting is the slums
and hills of Rio de Janeiro a few
days prior to the Carnival where
Orpheus loses his Eurydiee. The
camera moves over the hills and
the children and the skyline till
the tragedy unwinds itself on a
screen vibrant with dance, music
and colour.
"Black Orpheus," now at. the
Larkin, San Francisco, won the
Palme d'Or at Cannes so we are
led to expect great things. It
turns out so-so. Whilst the film,
essentially a ballet, sticks to dance
it is fine. Unfortunately the at
tempt to formulate Orpheus in
modern terms doesn't really come
off. The treatment is superficial
and one is always conscious of
the artificiality of tlie whole busi
ness.
As Eurydiee, Marpessa Dawn,
the only professional in the all
colored cast, is exquisitely beau
tiful and does not have to soil
the screen with acting. Breno
Mello makes a not too embarras

sing attempt at Orpheus hut 11
was surprised that with his play
ing the sun managed to struggle
weakly over the horizon, let alone
soar to the heavens.
The fault of the film is its mon
otony of pace, which is about
mach one. There are not enough
calm moments to contrast the
fury of the whirling carnival, or
to express the tenderness of the
love. But there are many sequen
ces one would not want to lose:
the highly surrealistic death
chase, Eurydice's agony of love, 1
and the final dance of the chil
dren as one of their number be
comes the new Orpheus.
Where the film succeeds and
overwhelms one is in the excite
ment it manages to convey as
crowds swirl, l'eet hammer and
Death moves quietly against the
blackness. Rarely have 1 seen a
screen so alive with colour, move
ment and melting images. This
interplay of form, line, music and
a vivid palette seems to me one
of the things that film is essen
tially suited to do.
So I say see it in spite of its
faults. Now please excuse me
whilst I go away and finish my
scenario about this here ocharina
playing Eskimo who seeks his
Japanese Eurydice in the (acous
tically accommodating i echo
chambered sewers of Rome.
