The year 19(H) is destined to go down as one without parallel it
the history of Wilbur Hall. For this was the year that the freshmar
men's dormitory saw a jock house created in its midst: Arroyo.
Arroyo House is the first frosh house ever to lie a serious con
tender for the intramural athletic championship and, notwithstanding
the caliber of athletic prowess which their teams have displayed
it must have been a mistake.

Kveryone knows (hat frosh
men are assigned lo the various
dorms in Wilbur with an eye to
ward making each house (for
lack of a better phrase) "well
ronnded." The intellectually ori
ented, the socially adaptable and
the athletically inclined are sup
posed to lie divided up into eight
separate groups and shelved in
the eight separate houses so thai
110 one house will have a dearth
or an overabundance of any type
of freshman.
That the Splitting â– Up - The -
Freshman - Men - Com was not on
the ball last summer is obvious.
One of those houses in Wilbur
must have all the brains and an
other one must have all the party
boys, because Arroyo's got all the
jocks.
Arroyo has competed in every
intramural sport that there is,
from football to ping-pong (in
which they were eliminated in the
semi-finals by the eventual
chnmns. thp Internalional Cluh).

In some they have done better than in others, but no matter how
things end up. what they'have done up to now is quite a feat.
They started off with football. The Arroyo gridders advanced
unbeaten to the playoffs and administered a 2(i-(> defeat to the I)l"s.
Arroyo quarterback Sandy I'ofahl and bis favorite receivers Bill
Teusch and Kd Ferry along with a huge line, then beat the Sigma
Chi's 11-8 and became the first froslr dorm ever to win the mural
football title.
Everybody Wrestled
Then came wrestling. The enthusiasm that swept the dorm after
winning the football championship took the form of a sort of get
out-the-team campaign. If you were in Arroyo and weren't wrestling
you were a back number. The pressure was applied and when the
sign-up sheets were posted, everybody wrestled. Philosophy majors,
four-footers, cripples; everybody. Between 40 ar*l ."50 (exact count
was lost i Arroyans signed up and began to practice.
Four sets of weights were installed at strategic spots throughout
the dorm and when the boys bad a free moment they lifted. The result
was that, by the sheer weight of numbers, Arroyo won the mural
wrestling championship.
At the end of winter quarter when the redoubtable Ehvyn Bugge,
Stanford's intramural director, added up the scores, Arroyo was
ahead ... of everybody. The score read Arroyo 210, Sigma Chi and
Phi Delt 188 each-
Things have changed since Ihen. The Sigma Chi's won the League
I team basketball championship and got to the semi-finals of the
League II team playoffs, which put them ahead of Arroyo, prob
ably for good.
Arroyo mural chairman, Glenn Alford, figures that his teams
will have to win either the 1 or II softhall championship and make a
good showing in the mural track meet if they are to have any chance
of winning the University championship. Arroyo is going all out for
track. There will be fwo men in every running event, a relay team
and two shotputters.
Perhaps it should also be reported that a small portion of the
Arroyo athletic abundance has been relieved by men's council for
violation of training regulations. When they celebrate in Arroyo
they really celebrate.
