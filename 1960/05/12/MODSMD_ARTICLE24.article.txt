# Spikers Journey To Fresno Relays
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Stanford's "Grand Slam" distance relay combine makes its first
start of the 19(50 track season Saturday night at Fresno's West Coast |
Relays.
Though missing two faces from the combine that won titles at !
the Drake, West Coast, Coliseum and California Relay meets, this
year's team could better 1959 performances.

Last year, Ernie Cunliffe, Don i
Chesarek, Dick Lassen and Bertil
Lundh posted ihe nation's fastest
two-mile relay time and beat the
best of the rest of distance med
ley units at Drake.
Coach Payton Jordan has en
tered his team in both the dis-j
lance medley and two-mile events
at Fresno, but since the medley j
is earlier on the program, it is j
expected to produce the better
showing.
The medley unit will have Bob.
Besse running the 4-11), Rich Klier
ihe 880, Norm Lloyd the 1320 and
Cunliffe the mile. Lassen will run j
only on the two-mile team, re
placing Besse and joining the j
other three.
Mark Could Fall
In the medley, the Indians will
be out after the all-time world |
best of 9:42.0, hung up at Fresno
several years ago by the Los An
geles St riders.
Stanford figures to crack the
mark if Besse and Klier can get
past the first two legs in 2:40,
and Lloyd and Cunliffe can run
even time for their seven laps.
Besse can run 48.5, and Klier
has turned the half in 1:51.3, so
the 2:40 is nothing unreasonable.
This leaves Lloyd as probably
the key man. He's run under 3
minutes for three laps several
times in workouts, but has had
the advantages of following Cun
liffe's pace. If Stanford is going
for a record, they'll probably be,
leading the race.
Thus, Lloyd must go out on
his own and set the pace, even |
though he doesn't like to run this
way.
Cunliffe The Master
Cunliffe, of course, is the mas- 1
ter of pace —he leads all his races, j
He's run 4:00.4 from a standing
start, and can cut off that four j
tenths simply with the advantage
of a running start.
Who'll be running against the I
Tribe-is still a matter of conjec
ture. The St riders usually have
a strong team, and will probably j
feature Jerome Walters on the 1
anchor mile. The Emerald AC
from Oregon, with men like Otis
Davis (46.2) and Jim Gr e lie i
(4:01 > is also a possible entry.
The two-mile team has a 7:20
potential, but the earlier race
will make this hard to achieve
Saturday.
.Shot-putter Jerry W inters
heads the field event entries. His
58-B'i topper puts him second
among U.S. collegians and only
a notch below the "Big Four."

The medley unit will have Bob.
Besse running the 4-11), Rich Klier
ihe 880, Norm Lloyd the 1320 and
Cunliffe the mile. Lassen will run j
only on the two-mile team, re
placing Besse and joining the j
other three.

In the medley, the Indians will
be out after the all-time world |
best of 9:42.0, hung up at Fresno
several years ago by the Los An
geles St riders.
Stanford figures to crack the
mark if Besse and Klier can get
past the first two legs in 2:40,
and Lloyd and Cunliffe can run
even time for their seven laps.
Besse can run 48.5, and Klier
has turned the half in 1:51.3, so
the 2:40 is nothing unreasonable.
This leaves Lloyd as probably
the key man. He's run under 3
minutes for three laps several
times in workouts, but has had
the advantages of following Cun
liffe's pace. If Stanford is going
for a record, they'll probably be,
leading the race.
Thus, Lloyd must go out on
his own and set the pace, even |
though he doesn't like to run this
way.
Cunliffe The Master
Cunliffe, of course, is the mas- 1
ter of pace —he leads all his races, j
He's run 4:00.4 from a standing
start, and can cut off that four j
tenths simply with the advantage
of a running start.
Who'll be running against the I
Tribe-is still a matter of conjec
ture. The St riders usually have
a strong team, and will probably j
feature Jerome Walters on the 1
anchor mile. The Emerald AC
from Oregon, with men like Otis
Davis (46.2) and Jim Gr e lie i
(4:01 > is also a possible entry.
The two-mile team has a 7:20
potential, but the earlier race
will make this hard to achieve
Saturday.
.Shot-putter Jerry W inters
heads the field event entries. His
58-B'i topper puts him second
among U.S. collegians and only
a notch below the "Big Four."
Stanford's "Grand Slam" distance relay combine makes its first
start of the 19(50 track season Saturday night at Fresno's West Coast |
Relays.
Though missing two faces from the combine that won titles at !
the Drake, West Coast, Coliseum and California Relay meets, this
year's team could better 1959 performances.

Last year, Ernie Cunliffe, Don i
Chesarek, Dick Lassen and Bertil
Lundh posted ihe nation's fastest
two-mile relay time and beat the
best of the rest of distance med
ley units at Drake.
Coach Payton Jordan has en
tered his team in both the dis-j
lance medley and two-mile events
at Fresno, but since the medley j
is earlier on the program, it is j
expected to produce the better
showing.
