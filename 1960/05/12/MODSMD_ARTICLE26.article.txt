NEW YORK </P) Sports Illus
trated charges football stars at
some Big Ten universities are
paid in cash after a game and
| others receive weekly payments
in unsigned envelopes through
the mail. The schools were not
named.
The accusations were made by
j the sports weekly magazine in its
May 16 issue in an article dis
cussing recruiting practices and
the NCAA's drastic action last
1 month against the University of
Indiana. Indiana was placed on
probation for four years for alleg
edly violating NCAA rules in re-
I cruiting six prospective football
players.
Sports Illustrated quoted un
identified recruiters from other
I Big Ten schools as saying "Indi
ana had to get caught because it
didn't use any class," and Indi
; ana recruiters used "no finesse."
