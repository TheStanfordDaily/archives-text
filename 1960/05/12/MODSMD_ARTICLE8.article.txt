# Dobbs Says Cuba Shows Progress, No Socialism
## 
### Bob Frank 
Socialist Workers Party presidential candidate Fan ell Dobbs told a Political Union meeting last
night that in his recent trip to Cuba he found great signs of progress, but "I found no evidence tHat
the government of Cuba is embarking on a socialistic program."
The conditions which tod the Cuban people to support the revolution originally, Dobbs said to the So
cialist Caucus of Poli Union, included intolerable living conditions, unemployment of one-third of the
working force and illiteracy of | —

two million adults.
The program proposed by the
Castro government was agrarian
reform, economic planning, build
ing houses, providing medical ser
vice and education and nationali
zation of utilities.
What were the results Dobbs
found in his three-week trip to
Cuba in April and early May?
Smash Batista Tyranny
"We found they had thoroughly
smashed the old Batista tyranny,"
The enormous standing army Ba
tista had maintained to maintain
his government was abolished,
and a much smaller army of vet
erans and leaders of the revolu
tion took its place.
The army is supplemented by a
much larger militia, which is
armed. If you wish proof that the
Cuban people support the Castro
government, said Dobbs, hotice
that the government provides all
members of the volunteer militia
with arms.
Contrary to impresions given
by the press in this country, de
clared Dobbs, large landowners
were compensated for the land
they lost in 20-year bonds for the
assessed value.
Hands Off Private Production
The government has taken no
action touching the capitalist sys
tems of private ownership of the
means of production, Dobbs said,
although they have attempted to
co-ordinate production to meet the
needs of government programs.
Thirty per cent of the million
people formerly unemployed have
been put to work.
Again contrary to socialist and
Marxist analysis, said Dobbs, the
government has frozen wages.
The workers do not object to this
measure when it is taken, he said,
because they have confidence in
the long-range plans of the gov
ernment.
Rather than socialism, the Cu
bans are adopting what we call a
"welfare state" in an attempt to
prove that capitalism can cure
poverty and provide a good life
for everybody.
New Schools
Almost 10,000 new schools have
been built or opened in the 15
months since the revolution, said
Dobbs, compared to 13 new
schools since Cuba became an in
dependent nation.
The platform of the Socialist
Workers Party, as far as Cuba is
concerned, is recognition of the
justice of the new system, and
extension of a helping hand to
the people of Cuba rather than
threats.
The Socialist Workers Party
advocates nationalization of the
basic means of production, and
formation of a national Labor
Party, even though the party
would probably not advocate so
cialism at first.
No Help From Demos
"People in need are finding less
and less help from the Democratic
Party," Dobbs said, citing the
Kennedy-Landrum-Griffin Act as
one example.
Automation is an issue which
would be dissolved under a so
cialist economy, Dobbs declared.
The trouble is not automation it
self, but the fact that utilization
of automation under the capitalist
system leads to unemployment.
Action is needed at the govern
ment level to reduce hours of
work, said Dobbs, so the people
as a whole can live a good life.

Marxist analysis, said Dobbs, the
government has frozen wages.
The workers do not object to this
measure when it is taken, he said,
because they have confidence in
the long-range plans of the gov
ernment.
Rather than socialism, the Cu
bans are adopting what we call a
"welfare state" in an attempt to
prove that capitalism can cure
poverty and provide a good life
for everybody.
New Schools
Almost 10,000 new schools have
been built or opened in the 15
months since the revolution, said
Dobbs, compared to 13 new
schools since Cuba became an in
dependent nation.
The platform of the Socialist
Workers Party, as far as Cuba is
concerned, is recognition of the
justice of the new system, and
extension of a helping hand to
the people of Cuba rather than
threats.
The Socialist Workers Party
advocates nationalization of the
basic means of production, and
formation of a national Labor
Party, even though the party
would probably not advocate so
cialism at first.
No Help From Demos
"People in need are finding less
and less help from the Democratic
Party," Dobbs said, citing the
Kennedy-Landrum-Griffin Act as
one example.
Automation is an issue which
would be dissolved under a so
cialist economy, Dobbs declared.
The trouble is not automation it
self, but the fact that utilization
of automation under the capitalist
system leads to unemployment.
Action is needed at the govern
ment level to reduce hours of
work, said Dobbs, so the people
as a whole can live a good life.
Socialist Workers Party presidential candidate Fan ell Dobbs told a Political Union meeting last
night that in his recent trip to Cuba he found great signs of progress, but "I found no evidence tHat
the government of Cuba is embarking on a socialistic program."
The conditions which tod the Cuban people to support the revolution originally, Dobbs said to the So
cialist Caucus of Poli Union, included intolerable living conditions, unemployment of one-third of the
working force and illiteracy of | —

two million adults.
The program proposed by the
Castro government was agrarian
reform, economic planning, build
ing houses, providing medical ser
vice and education and nationali
zation of utilities.
What were the results Dobbs
found in his three-week trip to
Cuba in April and early May?
Smash Batista Tyranny
"We found they had thoroughly
smashed the old Batista tyranny,"
The enormous standing army Ba
tista had maintained to maintain
his government was abolished,
and a much smaller army of vet
erans and leaders of the revolu
tion took its place.
The army is supplemented by a
much larger militia, which is
armed. If you wish proof that the
Cuban people support the Castro
government, said Dobbs, hotice
that the government provides all
members of the volunteer militia
with arms.
Contrary to impresions given
by the press in this country, de
clared Dobbs, large landowners
were compensated for the land
they lost in 20-year bonds for the
assessed value.
Hands Off Private Production
The government has taken no
action touching the capitalist sys
tems of private ownership of the
means of production, Dobbs said,
although they have attempted to
co-ordinate production to meet the
needs of government programs.
Thirty per cent of the million
people formerly unemployed have
been put to work.
Again contrary to socialist and
Marxist analysis, said Dobbs, the
government has frozen wages.
