time this year by Stanford's hon
orary fraternity for spcech activi
ties. This is not intended as an
annual award, but will be given
in those years when a graduat
ing senior deserves recognition
for special distinction in forensic
activities.
The Outstanding Freshman in
Forensics Award was given to
Mike Hall. Robert Sayler re
ceived the Ronald Kay Memorial
Award, given to the outstanding
sophomore debater of the year.
The Ray Lyman Wilbur Award
for excellence in the academic
area and leadership in varied
forms of student activities was
won by Oscar Wood Moyle 111.
Leadership
Driscoll was awarded the Don
aid B. Tresidder Perpetual Award
for consistent qualities of excel
lence and leadership in debating,
in addition to sharing the Mellin
koff Award with Kremer.
Regarding Kremer's sweep, Di
rector of Forensics Jon M. Eric
son comemnted, "It is highly un
usual for one person to receive
several awards in one year. There
is no precedent for such a circum
stance. Daniel Kremer, who was
the captain of the Stanford de
bate team this year, is the most
outstanding collegiate debater I
have known."
Kremer tentatively plans to at
tend the University of Washing
ton Law School next year while
Moyle will enroll at Harvard's
Law School.
Bill Dysart, a junior majoring
in political science, was elected
president of next year's associa
tion at the banquet.
