# U.S. Doubts Russia Heady To End Tension
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/I 3 ) The United States said last night the Soviet
Union's handling of the American spy plane case raises doubts about
the Soviets' readiness to reduce tensions at the East-West summit
conference.
At the same time, the United States rejected the Soviet Union's

charge that American spy flights I
over Soviet territory are deliber- j
ate hostile acts. The State Depart
ment, acting with unusual speed,!
gave this formal reply in a note i
just two days after Moscow offi
cially protested the flights.
The Soviet government had de
manded an immediate halt to all 1
such aerial intelligence gathering
and threatened what il called "re- I
taliatory measures" if it contin- 1
ues.
Flights Needed
Informants reported the reply
politely but firmly upheld the U.S. i
view that spy flights are needed
unless the Soviet Union agrees
to open its borders to interna- j
tional inspection against surprise
attacks.
Yesterday in Moscow, Premier
Nikita Khrushchev declared that
Secretary of State Christian A. j
Herter's defense of the spy plane
incident "is the kind of statement :
that could only be made by a
country in a state of war."
"If the United States is going
to unleash war and if they have
never experienced an atom bomb
on their territory, they certainly]
will in the first minutes of a
war," he added.
Khrushchev castigated Francis;
G. Powers, pilot of the U2 jet
reconnaissance plane downed May
Day deep inside the Soviet Union
for making "a gangster and ban- •
dit raid."
Tried as Spy
"We shall try him try him j
severely as a spy." he said. The .
penalty for spying is from 101 <
years in prison to death before j
a firing squad. ]
But Khrushchev saved his i
sharpest remarks for Herter.
Herter had defended the right i ,
of a nation to make reeonnais-;'
sance flights over the territory
of a possible enemy and declared
such flights would continue.
This, said Khrushchev, is "a •
threat to peace. If there are any j
further such aggressions we will
strike out at the aggressors." ij
Shaking his fist and looking <
very angry, the Premier declared: i
"These are audacious and brazen i
statements. This is the kind of ,
statement that could only be made
by a country in a state of war
with another country, and we are i
not at war with the United States, i (
"And that is why I say these
statements were audacious and ~
brazen. Impudence! Impudence! .
Impudence!"
