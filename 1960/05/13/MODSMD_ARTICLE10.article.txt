# Witnesses Stay Silent In Un-American Hearings
## Near-Riot Mars Meet 
### Mary Lou McKinley Managing Editor 
Three witnesses, including an
18-year-old University of Califor
nia sophomore, stood on their con
stitutional rights and refused for
the most part to answer questions
put to them by the House Com
mittee on Un-American Activities
yesterday.
The hearings were brought to
a halt several times due to stormy
protests both inside and outside
the Supervisors' Chambers in the
City Hall by hundreds of demon
strators.
Climaxed by the forced ejection
by police of longshoreman Archie
Brown, subpoenaed witness, when
he tried to protest the hearing,
the morning session brought to
the stand a self-described former
Communist, Mrs. Barbara Hartle,
who described party recruitment
techniques and its appeal to
youth.
Student Called
Cal student Douglas Wachtcr
was called to testify during the
morning session.
A statement by Wachter con
cerning the hearings appeared in
the Daily Cal yesterday morning:
"1 think the Committee wanted
to subpoena someone on campus
in order to tag Cal's political
movement as Un-American.
"I don't know why they picked
my name. Other people have been
involved in actions similar to
mine."
Wachter participated in the
CURE picketing of Kress and
Woolworth stores in Berkeley
and was the only university stu
dent to walk the 18 miles from
San Francisco to Sen Quentin in
February to protest Caryl Chess
man's execution, according to the
Daily Cal.
Statement Read
Staff director Richard Arens
read Wachter's statement and
then asked him if ho knew of
any other reason why he had
been subpoenaed.
In reply, Wachter said, "The
House Un-American Activities
Committee serves no real legisla
tive purpose. It punishes individ
uals for their political ideas and
associations." This statement was
greeted by applause from the
back of tho room which lasted
about 1.5 seconds.
Martin Marcus of Pacific Grove,
the last witness to appear yester
day, also refused to answer Ar
en's probing questions on consti
tutional grounds. Marcus told
newsmen afterward that he is a
teacher "in a district in Monterey
County."
Protested
For nearly an hour, Merrill
Brodsky, an unemployed tile ma
son from Oakland, was on the
stand. Brodsky, after lengthy con
sultations with his lawyer, stood
on the constitution in refusing
to answer any questions about
alleged Communist activities and
protested the constitutionality of
the Committee.
Mrs. Hartle said she had been
a Communist Party member from
1933 to 19.33, and agreed with
Arens who said, you have now
"found your way back to God
and Patriotism."
Arens referred frequently to
the "suckers and dupes used by
the Communist Party."
The Subcommittee is scheduled
to continue hearings today and
tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.

my name. Other people have been
involved in actions similar to
mine."
