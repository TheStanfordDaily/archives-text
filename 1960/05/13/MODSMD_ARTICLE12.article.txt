# Back in Town

The In-Americans are hack in town.
As llic article on page one ol today's Daily shows, nearly 200
people had an exciting lime watching a witch hunt yesterday.
As is the case with all witch hunts, nothing was accomplished
except for the tearing of a jacket, the fainting ol a woman and
the charging of a lew emotions.
The hearings took place before a packed house; literally and
figurativeh packed. The Daughters of the American Revolution
were there in full force, at the committee's special invitation, to
make sure that a large part of the audience would have a favor
able altitude toward the Committee.
Notwithstanding the attitude of the DAK and a few other
throwbacks, the committee is hunting for witches in a decidedly
hostile atmosphere. Three hundred professors at (lal have signed
a blistering resolution condemning the committee, as did 1500
other people in the Berkeley area.
Ki\e hundred Isa\ Area students stood outside the hearing
room and chanted to be let in. There were riots inside the hear
ing room and outside.
The Un-Americans are living on borrowed time and we sus
pect that the reaction of the May Area citizenry at large to their
witch-hunt has made them know it.
California Congressman Jimmv Roosevelt has a resolution
pending before the House which would make the House Un-
American Activities Committee onk a bitter memory.
Mounting public opinion against the committee, as expressed
in San Francisco Cit\ Hall vesterday, should hasten the passage
of such a bill.
Thus, there is a an excellent chance that this is the last time
that the witch-hunters will be in town.
