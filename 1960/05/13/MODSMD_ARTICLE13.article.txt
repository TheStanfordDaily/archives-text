# A 						Vote of Confidence

### 
WC lire ven pleased lo note I lie improvements which have
heen proposed lor the Health Scr\icc in a lar-sighled plan to
be partialK completed this summer.
In the past, the Health Service has done a «zoo<l job of s<»r\ iii«jc
tlie Stanford campus, however, there ha\e been main problems
concerning inadequate fa<*ilities and >tu<lent-doetor relationships
which have hindered somew hat the work of the Sen ice.
I his new plan promises to alleviate much of the difficulty
and to relieve the worries of students who. because of previous
unpleasant experiences due to the problems of the Service, have
become concerned about the medical care that the\ receive.
The Health Service does |>la\ an important part in the lives
of students at Stanford: however, to carrv (till its role, it must
have the full confidence of the student body. With the explana
tion bv Dr. bussel Lee in toda\ s article and the advent of this
program of improvement, we can sec no reason why this confi
dence -lionid not be forthcoming.
