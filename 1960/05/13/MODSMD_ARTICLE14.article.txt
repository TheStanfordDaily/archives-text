## 
### Associated Press 
.With Sen. Hubert Humphrey
out of the running and Vice Presi- j
dent Richard M. Nixon aboul j
ready to shift into gear, Ihe po-1
litical situation has lost some of
its proconvenlion aspects for this
moment and begins to take on
some of the flavor of an actual
presidential campaign.
And this comes at a time when
the nation is heavily preoccupied j
with international affairs, ihe
Republican administration is in a .
muddle over its handling of them, j
and with important international
conferences beginning.
The color of the political scene [
will of course still depend heavily 1
on the tactics of Sen. Lyndon B. !
Johnson of Texas and the consid-1
erable company of voters which j
hopes to bring Adlai E. Stevenson
to the fore once more.

Both of these forces are power
fid, and Kennedy is not in yet.
Stuart Symington of Missouri is
still working hard, of course, but
the campaign among the Demo
crats just isn't what it was before
West Virginia. Johnson, who is
making a powerful run behind the

In the meantime, Nixon faces
new problems just when his cam
paign is about to open.
President Eisenhower's cam
paign for peace, which was ex
pected to prove a strong plank for
bridging some of the streams
Nixon will have to cross, has ta
ken a setback. Relations with the
Soviet Union are worse.
The domestic political aspects
of this are being soft-pedaled to
give the nation a unified front at
the summit conference. But the
administration is under criticism
that it is inept, has bad judgment
