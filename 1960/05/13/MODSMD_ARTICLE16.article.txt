## Director Plans Health Service Improvements 
### Daryl Glenney 
A slow moving reform program
has been triggered into action at
the Health Service.
Dr. Russel Lee. medical director
of (he Palo Alto Clinic which con
trols the Service, explained in an
interview Tuesday a series of re
forms planned to improve public
relations and correct sump of the
faults of the cur lent Health Serv
ice program.
The first step of a long range
plan will be initiated this summer
when a new administrator lakes'
over the service a Harvard doc
tor with whom the Clinic has been
negotiating for some lime. The
Service hopes eventually to in
clude on its staff doctors who will
also serve as professors at the
Medical School.
In the meantime, steps are be
ing taken to improve public rela
tions, an area in which, -says Lee,
the Service is unquestionably
poor. An executive board met last
week for this purpose.
Although the Health Service
has an extraordinary 14-year rec
ord of "coming through when the
chips are down," Lee admitted
that something is lacking in the
everyday service and treatment of
minor ailments.
Most of Ihe complaints, said
Lee, have been traced to doctors
who do not know how to handle
students effectively. Action will
be taken to place doctors at the
Service who are interested in be
ing there and working with stu
dents.
"If there's anything a neurotic
hates to be told," said Lee, "it is
that his illness is all in his mind
when it is." He again stressed the
importance ofÂ»tact in the doctors'
handling of student illnesses.
Lee also revealed plans to send
a specialist in problems of adoles
cence to be available at the Health
Service two days a w r eek.
A primary goal of the improve
ment program is to more closely
associate the Stanford Health Ser
vice wtih the Palo Alto Clinic.
More serious cases will be re
ferred to the Clinic in the future.
The current expansion program at
the Clinic will help facilitate this.
W. L. Wat kins, administrator of
the Clinic, said that public rela
tions at the Health Service leave
something to be desired and that
doctor-patient relationships could
be improved.
Wat kins and Lee both explained
that they have for some time rec
ognized the inadequacies of the
Health Service and begun to for
mulate a reform program in Jan
uary to become effective over the
summer. Recent controversy
brought the subject to a head and
convinced them that more imme
diate steps should he taken.
