Inquisition
Editor, the Daily:
Miss Rutledge's letter of yester*
day is strikingly inept. The House
| Un-American Activities Commit
' tee is not, according to its orig
i inal mandate, concerned with
| "clear and present danger.*' It is
j to investigate propaganda activi-l
: ties; that is, speech, press, and
assembly.
In doing so, it has violaled the I
First Amendment and is violating
Jit right now in San Francisco. It
i has far exceeded its mandate. It
: has condemned by innuendo. It ;
has become an inquisition rather
, than an investigation.
The Supreme Court in the Wat- j
, kins decision recognized unequivo-
I cally the danger of the committee |
; to civil liberties.
Mis-s Rut ledge should know too
that for the Supreme Court to
write into the Constitution a
check on the Communist Party
would be a twofold violation of
that document. Too many people
these days seem well disposed to
ward this sort of rape.

Con Home Proceeds
Kditor, the Daily:
The reference to fraternity do
nations for the Con Home which
appeared in Thursday's Daily was
! in bad taste and not a justified
statement.
There were at least four ways
in which fraternity men could con
tribute to the Con Home drive*
on-campus solicitations, the penny
mile, the carnival, and the king
and queen contest.
The fraternities and the eating
clubs are noted for their strong
support for such activities as the
king and queen contest and the
carnival. As an example, one fra
ternity contributed more than two

, dollars per member toward the
i king and queen contest in addi
j lion to campaigning for their can
, didate at other living groups.
The fact that the drive did not
attain the $12,000 goal is not suf
ficient reason for Mr. Cullinan to
look for excuses by noting that
the house to house solicitation at
' fraternities did not raise as much
as in other years. The net pro
ceeds are higher than last year,
i each group on campus having con
tributed whatever they wished in
the way that interested them.

An Explanation
Editor, the Daily:
In your issue of May 11, 1960,
| there appeared a statement made
' by Dr. William McCord that quot
ed an employee of the Stanford
Woolworth store on the matter of
the recent picketing of the store.
If anyone in this store made
such a distasteful remark or said
something that might convey such
an impression, those offended
have my profound apology and
my strong assurance that it does
not represent in the slightest de
gree the true thinking or policy
of store management or higher
level management.
I have served many years with
YVoolworths in a large number of
stores and know that Woolworth
stores in the Western States do
not segregate nor discriminate.
Our racial relationships nave been
excellent and we expect ihem to
continue so.
This store proudly serves and
1 employs colored people and has
every intention of continuing to
do so.
