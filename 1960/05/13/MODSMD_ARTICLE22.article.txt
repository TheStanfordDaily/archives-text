## 
### Roy Schmid 
Stanford's varsity baseballers may get a chance to knock rival
California out of first place today as they journey to Berkeley for
a 3:1."> encounter with the Bears. Tomorrow the Indians return home
for a double header against Santa Clara. Game time is 10 a.m.
California now leads second-place USC' by just one-half game, and

| the combination of a Trojan win
and Bear loss would drop them
Ito second. USC faces third place
Santa Clara.
The Indians will call on their
most effective pitcher of late, Jim
Smith, winner of his last three
starts. Smith hasn't pitched since
last Saturday when he Cal
18-1.
I.ow E.lt A.
The sophomore fireballer has
been nursing a blister on one of
his pitching fingers, but will be
ready to go this afternoon. He
has posted a deceiving record of
two wins and three losses, but
has a fine 1.82 BRA.
Cal Coach George Wolfman is
expected to counter with either
Jerry Montgomery or Ray Rohde,
both of whom have 1-0 records.
Cal faces I ISC in a doubleheader
tomorrow and is expected to save
their two top hurlers, Ted Settle

Coach Dutch Fehring will call
on lefty Marv Mecklenberg to
face Santa Clara in the first game
but has not yet decided on a
second-game pi t che r. Me will
choose either Earl Russell, who
pitched five good innings Tuesday
against Sacramento State, Mark
Miller or Rich Simpson, who have
looked sharp in relief. His deci
sion hinges on whether or not
Smith can go the full nine innings
this afternoon. The Card pitching
ranks have been depleted by the
absence of Terry Lindeman who
is out with a bad back.
The Indians are expected to go
with their usual starting lineup
of Jim Cowart at first, Mike Ma
gee at second, Jim Burk at third,
Mike Filice at shortstop, and Jay
Winter behind the plate. The out
field combination will be John
Hurlbut in left, Hal Sehutzmann
' in center, and Skip Lawrence in
i right.
