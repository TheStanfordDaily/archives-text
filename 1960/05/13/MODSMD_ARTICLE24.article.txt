### 
Stanford joins the hopefuUrec
ord-brcakers tomorrow in Fresno
in the West Coast Relays first
of the major late-spring meets
leading up to ihe Olympic trials.
A distance medley team capable
of 9:40 will carry the principal
Indian record hopes as it aims at
the unofficial world and official
American best of 9:-12. Bob Besse
(440), Rich Klier (880), Norm
Lloyd (1320) and Ernie Cunliffe
(mile) will carry the Stanford
baton.
Klier, Lloyd and Cunliffe will
join Dick Lassen later in the meet
in an attempt to successfully de
fend the four-man two-mile title
Stanford won at Fresno last year.
Tough Double
How much the earlier race will
take out of the two-mile team is
difficult to predict. But based on
dual meet doubles the Tribe group
has run, the unit should wage a
successful defense.
Lassen and Besse will combine
with Chris Hungerland and Rich
Parker in the mile relay, last
event on the program. Parker is
a newcomer to the unit, since Cun
liffe. Lloyd and Klier all mem- !
hers of the mile team in various

races already.,
Stanford's only other runner j
will be John Northway, who'll go
in the 5000 meters.

Long and Dave Davis all well over
63 feet this year.

frosh Sheridan Downey will all

leading up to ihe Olympic trials.
A distance medley team capable
of 9:40 will carry the principal
Indian record hopes as it aims at
the unofficial world and official
American best of 9:-12. Bob Besse
(440), Rich Klier (880), Norm
Lloyd (1320) and Ernie Cunliffe
(mile) will carry the Stanford
baton.
Klier, Lloyd and Cunliffe will
join Dick Lassen later in the meet
in an attempt to successfully de
fend the four-man two-mile title
Stanford won at Fresno last year.
Tough Double
How much the earlier race will
take out of the two-mile team is
difficult to predict. But based on
dual meet doubles the Tribe group
has run, the unit should wage a
successful defense.
Lassen and Besse will combine
with Chris Hungerland and Rich
Parker in the mile relay, last
event on the program. Parker is
a newcomer to the unit, since Cun
liffe. Lloyd and Klier all mem- !
hers of the mile team in various
meets—will have each run two
races already.,
Stanford's only other runner j
will be John Northway, who'll go
in the 5000 meters.
Winters Meets Best
Jerry Winters tops a nine-man
field event lrst which includes
four freshmen.
Winters, the new Stanford shot
put record holder at is now

tition, with Bill Neider, Dallas'
Long and Dave Davis all well over
63 feet this year.
John Kelly, Charles Barth and
frosh Sheridan Downey will all
broad jump, and Kelly and Dow
ney will hop-step-jump as well.
