# Whyte Sees Slowdown in U.S. Economy
## 
### Ross Hermann 
William H. Whyte Jr., noted
American social critic, predicted
a general slowdown of the United
States economy during the early
1960's in a talk last night in Me
morial Auditorium.
As a result of this, "life will
have a bit more of an edge to ii
and the pursuit of happiness will
really be a pursuit."
These remarks were part of a
speech entitled "A Decade of
Sanctimony."
Stock Market
The sobering life of the next
few years, he said, will be a result
of widespread specul a t i on
throughout the 19o0's and com
monly hold middle-class altitudes.
Americans were under the delu
sion that what was going on was
sober and conservative, while
actually the 1950's was a decade
of speculation rivaling the 1920'5.
Behind this common delusion is
a myriad of middleclass attitudes
and characteristics.
"Participation in the stock mar
ket," he said, "is ever growing.
They are comparatively sophisti
cated investors who are interested
in the higher priced ratios, not
speculation, because we are deal
ing in a new era in growth rate,
in research and in new technol
ogy that has made the old stock
market rules-of-thumb obsolete."
Sanctimony
"In short, by buying, safe, de
pendable gilt-edge stocks and
tucking them away, or by partici
pating in the popular mutual fund
systems, you are going to make
lots of money without having to
do much to get it, and feel very
proud of yourself."
Whyte said that much of this
attitude can he ascribed to the so
cial atmosphere of the 1950'5, "a
decade of sanctimony, the high
water mark of materialism and
the celebration of consumption,
the apologetics of cupidity." .
The year of culmination, he
said, was 1959; the now era began
on January 6 when the stock mar
ket took an unexpected plunge.
This event drew the typical sanc
timonious response that it was a
necessary readjustment and a
healthy situation. People failed to
realize that an era had come to
an end.
Pinched
The first impact, he said, will
be a jolt to the lower segments of
the middle class. The economic
slowdown will result in a period
of disbelief and a slow breakdown
of the prevailing attitudes of the
1950'5. The slow realization of the
new situation will create new po
litical issues within the next two
years. Whyte predicted a redis
covery of the value of saving.
lie saw further that as profit
margins are pinched the smooth
progression from college .into or
ganizational life will be disrupted.
This could affect the classes of
19(12 and 19(53.
He felt these factors constitute
no great tragedy but will make
life in the immediate years more
exciting and challenging.

WILLIAM H. WIIYTI
Slowdown
William H. Whyte Jr., noted
American social critic, predicted
a general slowdown of the United
States economy during the early
1960's in a talk last night in Me
morial Auditorium.
As a result of this, "life will
have a bit more of an edge to ii
and the pursuit of happiness will
really be a pursuit."
These remarks were part of a
speech entitled "A Decade of
Sanctimony."
Stock Market
The sobering life of the next
few years, he said, will be a result
of widespread specul a t i on
throughout the 19o0's and com
monly hold middle-class altitudes.
Americans were under the delu
sion that what was going on was
sober and conservative, while
actually the 1950's was a decade
of speculation rivaling the 1920'5.
Behind this common delusion is
a myriad of middleclass attitudes
and characteristics.
"Participation in the stock mar
ket," he said, "is ever growing.
They are comparatively sophisti
cated investors who are interested
in the higher priced ratios, not
speculation, because we are deal
ing in a new era in growth rate,
in research and in new technol
ogy that has made the old stock
market rules-of-thumb obsolete."
Sanctimony
"In short, by buying, safe, de
pendable gilt-edge stocks and
tucking them away, or by partici
pating in the popular mutual fund
systems, you are going to make
lots of money without having to
do much to get it, and feel very
proud of yourself."
Whyte said that much of this
attitude can he ascribed to the so
cial atmosphere of the 1950'5, "a
decade of sanctimony, the high
water mark of materialism and
the celebration of consumption,
the apologetics of cupidity." .
