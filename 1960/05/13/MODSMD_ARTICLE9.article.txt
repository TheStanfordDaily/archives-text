Police were called in by Rep.
Edwin E. Willis (D.-La.), commit
tee chairman, after the students
present and a dozen adults who
said they had been subpoenaed
got out of hand in the Board of
Supervisors chambers in the City
Hall.
The action came as the commit
tee attempted to resume the hear
ing at 1:30 p.m. after a lunch
break.
The hundreds of people outside
in the corridor mostly students
began shouting to be let into the
already jammed room.
Archie Brown, a subpoenaed
longshoreman who h ad been
thrown out in the morning ses
sion, hollered that the committee
members had packed the audience
by giving supporters of the com
mit lee white cards which allowed
them entrance, while much of the
public couldn't get in.
Force Doors Shut
The crowd then tried to barge
in. but six policemen forced the
doors shut after a struggle. The
demonstrators inside began sing
ing "The Star Spangled Banner"
and"The Battle Hymn of the Re
public."
During this, Brown was joined
at a railing by 11 other adults who
said they had been served sub
poenas. All began screaming that
those outside be admitted or that
a larger hearing room be found.
Brown and the others, cheered
by much of the audience, taunted
Willis with "This is not Louisiana
. . . This is California. Let the
people in. What are you hiding
. . . what are you afraid of?"
Willis withstood this for about
10 minutes then summoned the
cops.
Defiance of Congress
He charged that the mob was
in open defiance of Congress, and
committee counsel Richard Arens
added, "The Congress of Ihe
United States is not going to be
intimidated by this mob of Com
mies."
The police then stormed the
railing, pushing and bodily carry
ing the do/en, including three wo
men, out of the room. Several
members of the audience tried to
help the police, pointing out peo
ple who had been demonstrating
so the officers could eject them.

STCDENTS PICKET UN AMKKK'AN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE HEARING
Hundreds of area students picketed yesterday's stormy session in San Francisco
tried to shove her out. The purse
flew into pieces, showering its
contents on those neaijiy.
The session then resumed, with
10 policemen stationed in the
room to prevent any further dis
order. They were effective, as the
hearing went on in a tense quiet,
although those in the hall sang
songs all afternoon.
Witness Quieted
When another witness began
shouting as Arens questioned
him, the counsel quieted him by
noting that they had "guys here

. who can make you look like a
creampuff."
The students, from Stanford,
California, San Francisco City
and State colleges and San Jose
State, picketed the building
I throughout the day. They also
held a mass rally at Union Square
at noon, at which local churchmen
and a state assemblyman congrat
ulated them for their stand.
The picket line stretched com
pletely around the City Hall at all
times. Some of the signs said:
"We Refuse to Sponsor Another
Rigged Qui/ Show," and "House
Un-American Activities Commit
tee: The Thinking Man's Filter."
