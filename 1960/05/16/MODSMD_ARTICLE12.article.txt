# Grad Hits Committee
## 
### Steve Ereidberg, Editor 
Louis Zeitz, a 38-year-old Stan
ford graduate student in biophys
ics, appeared before the House
Un-American Activities Sub-Com
mittee Saturday in response to a
subpoena.
After giving information as to
his occupation and education,
Zeitz declined to answer other
questions of the Committee by in
voking the First and Fifth amend
ments of the Constitution.
The First Amendment grants
freedom of speech, assembly, and
petition; and the Fifth Amend
ment states that no man shall be
compelled to be a witness against
himself.
Zeitz read a prepared statement
to the Committee in which he ac
cused it of being "an instrument
of fear,"
Conformity of Thought
"Its goal is the establishment of
conformity of thought," he said.
"I will take no part in the efforts
of this monstrosity of a commit
tee to ossify people's minds, to
paralyze people with fear."
He stated that intellectuals play
an important part in the forma
tion of public opinion and must do
their duty "in refusing to cooper
ate in any undertaking thai vio
lates the constitutional rights of
the individual." (See entire state
ment. page 2.)
In an interview with the Daily
after his appearance, Zeitz said
the Committee's reasons for sub
poenaing him dealt with his po
litical thoughts and associations.
He disclaimed the right of the
Committee to question him on
these things.
Nothing to TTidÂ« i
"I have nothing to hide or be
ashamed of," he affirmed, "but
no committee is going to tell me
what I can believe."
Zeitz said that in view of the
methods which the Committee
uses and their motives, he decided
not to cooperate in any way with
them. The objective of the Com
mittee, he claimed, is to expose
people who disagree with them
and to subject these people to
harrassment. 1
"The American people are com
ing to understand more clearly
what the Committee is," he con
cluded.
The Committee during its stay
in San Francisco interrogated 48
witnesses, most of whom refused
to answer questions about their
political affiliations and beliefs
and invoked the First and Fifth
amendments.
One of the most outspoken of
the witnesses was Archie Brown,
a well-known Communist, who
was ejected from the hearings for
the third time Saturday after he
tried to read a motion proposing
the removal of Representative
Edwin Willis (D.-La.) from Con
gress un der the Fourteenth
Amendment. Willis, who headed
the hearings, got 89(32 votes in the
last election out of a constituency
of 325,000.
A news commentary of the hear
ings may be heard over KZSU to
night from 7:45 to 8.
