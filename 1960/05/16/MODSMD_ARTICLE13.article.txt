# It Cost a Dime

The Committee Int.- left San Francisco. and tlieir visit lias
indeed been a revealing one. It should he fairlv obvious to all
that the Committee's avowed purpose ol investigating! Communist
activities is simplv a distortion ol llie truth.
Archie Brown told a reporter, " I he Committee spent $100,000
to come out here and find out il I am a Communist. I picked up
a newspaper todav and read il there. It cost me a dime. Perhaps
if the Committee members spent more time reading the news
papers, thev would he able to learn about this "secret ami con
.-piratorial force'" thev purport to investigate.
The fact is thai (he Committee does not consider itself an
investigating bodv hut rather combined judge, jury and prose
cution. What one would expect to find only in the totalitarian
countries exists here: there is no defense counsel allowed as in
most court proceedings.
Defenders of the Committee claim il is not a court nor does
it even Irv to he one, hut the incidents of lasl week, betray the
falseness of this claim. Representative Cordon Scherer I R-Ohio)
when motioning to evict a witness wanted him "removed Iroin
tlie court room."
They met in Ihe Supervisors' Chambers in San Francisco, cer
not a court room. Committees do not meet in court rooms; they,
surprisingly enough, meet in committee rooms. And yet in Mr.
Scherer's mind, his job is that of a judge, a function Congress has
never given him.
Il became clear through the hearings that the Committee
was reallv not interested in ha\ ing their questions answered. Kven
when people seemed willing to lalk about themselves, the Com
mittee did not w ail lo listen.
Mr. Arens ranted and shouted as a man totally unaware of the
concept of freedom. The Committee, members chatted amongst
themselves; the marshal Is inside the Supervisors" Chambers lis
tened to Ihe ball game: and onlv the recorder at his "shorthand
machine and llie crowd of spectators listened to the witnesses.
There is another danger that is even more threatening. I his
Committee is trying to link the California Democratic Clubs with
the Communist conspiracy. One reporter said that when he got
back to Santa Clara Countv, he would expose the CDC for what
it is, probably at an American Legion meeting, he added.
Thus in time for the November elections, we can expect to
see a new smear develop, a new attempt to link Communism and
i lie Democratic Party. The Committee is out t<» destroy its opposi
tion not bv direct accusation of Communist affiliation, but rather
bv innuendo. The Hearst press will finish the job.
The Committee's tactics are the same as those of the days of
McCarthy and Wide. The sensational charges may he less rabid,
but the intent to destroy by intimidation and innuendo is still
their objective. Americans should protest this un-American Com
mittee and call for its abolition. The Committee itself endangers
our Constitutional liberties and freedoms.
