# The 						Police State
## 
### 
While the House Un-American Activities Committee was dis
plaving a striking disregard of civil liberties inside the Super
visors" room at City 1 lull Friday, the riot squad outside the room
was doing its best to further the impression of a police state.
The 100 or so people assembled were, it is true, overly noisy;
but that does not excuse the brutality of the police in expelling
them from the building.
The cause of the riot has been attributed to one student s
grubbing a policeman's night stick, and attacking him. Ihe crowd
supposedly had been asked to quiet down, and when the incident
occurred, the fire hoses were turned on: and the police went into
unrestrained action.
One student was held bv four policemen while a filth hit him
in the back, with a nightstick. Several policemen were giving stu
dents "rabbit punches" and kicking ami hitting other students
King on the floor, some of them semi-conscious.
Shoving the crowd down the steep flight of stairs, the police
dragged or carried those who couldn t walk, banging tliein against
the steps as thev descended. Several people were pushed down the
i-tairs and were injured. It was miraculous that no one was killed
in the one-sided melee. .
The building was cleared of protesters and the Committee
continued its proceedings undaunted bv the brutality of the
police which protected the Committee's own brutality.
The purpose of the police is to uphold the law and preserve
the peace, but the cruelty which occurred Friday was neither
called for nor needed.
