# Un-American Committee Powers, Duties Outlined
## 
### Mary Lou McKinley Managing Editor 
The present House Committee
on Un-American Activities came
into existence Jan. 3, 194.5. The
following information about the
committee was taken from House
Document No. 18, prepared and
released by the Committee in
July 1958.
Public Law GOl of the 70th Con
gress (1946) defines the powers
and duties of the Committee as
such:
"To make from time to time
investigations of (li the extent,
character, and objects of un-
American propaganda activities
in the United States; (2) the dif
fusion within the U.S. of subver
sive and un-American propaganda
that is instigated from foreign
countries, or of a domestic origin,
and attacks the principle of the
form of government as guaran
teed by our Constitution;
"Watchfulness"
"(3) All other questions in rela
tion thereto that would aid Con
gress in any necessary remedial
legislation; and (4) to exercise
watchfulness over the execution
by administrative agencies of
laws relating to subversive activi
ties and internal security."
The first House special commit
tee to investigate this type of ac
tivity was set up in 1930. The sec
ond was created in March 1934, to
specifically investigate Nazi prop
aganda and functioned until Feb
ruary 1935.
In 1938 the Special Committee
to Investigate Un-American Ac
tivities and Propaganda was set
up and functioned until the pres
ent committee took its place.
According to the House Docu

ment, investigations usually begin
when committee members receive
lead information "indicating the
necessity for an investigation."
Then, "normally ... a preliminary
inquiry to ascertain the reliability
of the informatoin" is conducted.
Why is live Committee neces
sary when the Federal Bureau of
Investigation carries on similar
invest igal ions?
The Committe pamphlet has
this to say:
"The FBI ... is primarily de
voted to developing evidence upon
which to base criminal prosecu
tions. As a result the information
which the FBI acquires becomes
public only if there is a prosecu
tion disclosing it in Federal Court,
Ihe Subversive Activities Control
Board or in certain administrative
proceedings.
"Recommendations"
"On the other hand, a congres
sional committee must seek and
receive public information upon
which to base legislation and leg
islative recommendations. Furth
er, the FBI is precluded from fur
nishing information to congres
sional committees by Executive
order of the President."
On procuring testimony, the
Document says, "in many cases,
witnesses appear voluntarily." It
goes on to say, "in others, a sub
poena is issued."
The booklet emphasizes that a
subpoena is not "an indictment or
statement of charges against the
individual upon whom it is
served."
"The committee is not a court
of law, and has no punitive pow
ers." What does the Committee
consider as punitive powers? The
Document does not say.
Private Hearings?
Executive (private) sessions
may be held "if a majority of the
committee feels that the interro
gation of a witness in public hear
ing might . . . unjustly injure his
reputation . . . , for the purpose
of determining the necessity or
advisability of having a public
hearing at a later date."
The booklet further says, "every
possible precaution is taken to
assure elimination of mistakes
and prevention of false testimony.
Witnesses are not subpoenaed at
random." Explaining, it says
"competent and well-trained in
vestigators are assigned to make
thorough investigation before wit
nesses are subpoenaed." It does
not say how or in what context
investigations are made.
Defining a "Communist Front,"
the House Document says "an or
ganization, committee, or group
of people, or a printed publication
which is substantially direct
ed, dominated, or controlled by
the Communist Party. It is pri
marily operated for the purpose
of giving aid and support to the
Communist Party, a Communist
foreign government, or the world
Communist movement'."
Who applie this definition? The
Committee.
