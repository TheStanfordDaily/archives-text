### 
Editor's Note: The following is
a statement given, by Stanford
student Louis Zeitz at a hearing
of tlie House Un-American Activi
ties Committee on Saturday.
I respect the rights of congres
sional committees to investigate
in the interest of developing legis
' lation. However, it is obvious
| after sitting thorugh sessions of
this committee that it has no leg
islative purpose.
j This committee is an instru
ment of fear. Its goal, the estab
lishment of conformity of
j thought. This committee may be
i successful in establishing con
i formity with the aid of clubs and
I water hoses which were used on
| the students yesterday. But, if it
! is successful in establishing con
formity, it will have killed Ameri
| eanism. For Americanism is syn
onymous with dissent. The birth
I of this country is a result of dis
sent, and thai which is great in
I this country came about because
: we were free to dissent.
I will take no part in the efforts
! of this monstrosity of a commit
j tee to ossify people's minds, to
i paralyze people with fear.
Albert Einstien years ago, as
I a result of his experience with
j Nazi Germany, warned against
! this type of committee. In 1953,
| Einstein stated:
'"The strength of the Constitu
tion fies entirely in the determi-
I nation of each citizen to defend
jit. Only if every single citizen
! feels duty bound to do his share
; in this defense are the constitu
tional rights secure.
"The intellectuals have a par
i ticular influence on the formation
I of public opinion. This is the rea
son why those who are about to
I lead us toward an authoritarian
government are particularly con
j corned with intimidating and muz-
I zling that group.
"It is. therefore, especially im
portant for the intellectuals to do
! their duty. I see this duty in re
fusing to cooperate in any under
taking that violates the constitu
tional rights of the individual.
| This holds in particular for all
: inquisitions that are concerned
| with the private life and political
affiliations of the citizens."
VVitli the above in mind, I de
cline to answer the question
basing this refusal on the right
to remain silent on questions of
thought, affiliation and associa
tion guaranteed under the First
Amendment, and the privilege of
not being compelled to be a wit
ness against myself granted in
the Fifth Amendment.

I zling that group.
"It is. therefore, especially im
portant for the intellectuals to do

fusing to cooperate in any under
taking that violates the constitu

affiliations of the citizens."
VVitli the above in mind, I de
cline to answer the question
basing this refusal on the right
to remain silent on questions of
thought, affiliation and associa
tion guaranteed under the First
Amendment, and the privilege of
not being compelled to be a wit
ness against myself granted in
the Fifth Amendment.
Editor's Note: The following is
a statement given, by Stanford
student Louis Zeitz at a hearing
of tlie House Un-American Activi
ties Committee on Saturday.
I respect the rights of congres
sional committees to investigate
in the interest of developing legis
' lation. However, it is obvious
| after sitting thorugh sessions of
this committee that it has no leg
islative purpose.
j This committee is an instru
ment of fear. Its goal, the estab
lishment of conformity of
j thought. This committee may be
i successful in establishing con
i formity with the aid of clubs and
I water hoses which were used on
| the students yesterday. But, if it
! is successful in establishing con
formity, it will have killed Ameri
| eanism. For Americanism is syn
onymous with dissent. The birth
I of this country is a result of dis
sent, and thai which is great in
I this country came about because
: we were free to dissent.
I will take no part in the efforts
! of this monstrosity of a commit
j tee to ossify people's minds, to
i paralyze people with fear.
Albert Einstien years ago, as
I a result of his experience with
j Nazi Germany, warned against
! this type of committee. In 1953,
| Einstein stated:
'"The strength of the Constitu
tion fies entirely in the determi-
I nation of each citizen to defend
jit. Only if every single citizen
! feels duty bound to do his share
; in this defense are the constitu
tional rights secure.
"The intellectuals have a par
i ticular influence on the formation
I of public opinion. This is the rea
son why those who are about to
I lead us toward an authoritarian
government are particularly con
j corned with intimidating and muz-
I zling that group.
