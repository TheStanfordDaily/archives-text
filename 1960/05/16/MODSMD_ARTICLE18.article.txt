# Roosevelt Calls for End to Committee
## 
### 
Editor's Note: Following' art'
major excerpts of the address by
Rep. James Roosevelt (I)-Calif.j,
urging the aholition of the tin-
American Activities Committee,
in the House of Representatives
April 25.
Mr. Speaker, I again rise to
speak in behalf of the necessity
and the responsibility of this body
to abolish the Committee on Un-
American Activities.
. . . My conviction is that the
Committee is closer to being dan
gerous to America in its concep
tion than most of wjiat it investi
gates. . . . Specifically, I am con
vinced that the major activity of
ihe Committee which we have
licensed is the abridgement of tho
citizen's freedoms; that insofar
as the Committee lias legitimate
functions which it occasionally
performs, those functions belong
more properly and effectively to
the purviews of our other Stand
ing Committees long antedating
this one. . . .
The Indictment
The Committee indicts itself by
its very conduct. . . . These, I
submit, are the unanswerable
counts against the Committee in
ascending order of seriousness.
• First of all, it spends large
amounts of needed time, energy
and money in ponderously inves
tigating and restating the obvi
ous. . . .
• Second, however, it combines
with this a contrasting inability
to understand the very real ■com
plexities of human behavior, or
even to try to do so.
• Third, . . . the Committee
has repeatedly shown its inability
to stick to its own business. 11
seems to have an uncontrollable
tendency to encroach upon the
jurisdiction of our other Commit
tees and of other governmental
agencies, including tho police, the
Justice I) e p a r 1 m en t and the
Courts.
• Fourth, the Committee has
no real usefulness or justifica
tion. . . . The various police and
counter-espionage agencies in
reality do what the Committee
merely claims to do in guarding
this country against internal dan
ger. . . .
• Fifth, despite the existence
of the police and prosecuting
agencies of the United States and
their effectiveness, tho Commit
tee has undertaken to constitute
itself as a roving police and prose
cution agency. . . . Yet it acts
with the aid of immunities and
powers which we woidd not
dream of granting our police and
public prosecutors.
Acts as a Court
• Sixth, the Committee also
acts as a Court, for it judges those
who come before it. Yet, again it
is not subject to the restraints of
fairness and impartiality which
we impose upon our judiciary.
• Seventh, the mandate which
we did in fact give the Commit
tee is itself defective and inher

ently contrary to our democratic
traditions.
How did we come to establish
a Committee to decide what was
"un-American," forsooth; and still
worse, how did we persuade our
selves that propaganda, speech
was a fit subject for regulation
by inquisitional techniques such
as the Committee employs? . . .
We have, in effect, created and
empowered an agency to super
vise the exercise of First Amend
ment rights, an organ for censor
ship and suppression.
Destruction of Dignity
Finally, then we come to what
I think is the most serious criti
cism of the Committee the fact
that it lias become an agency for
the destruction of human dignity
and constitutional rights. . . .
We have become accustomed to
think of those whom it subpoenas
or labels as victims rather than
witnesses. . . .
. . . We have no mandate to abuse
the rights and feelings of our citi
zens, nor are we obligated to pro
fane ourselves in the eyes of the
rest of the world. . . .
Then those who return here
next January can complete this
imperative task. . . . Let us set
our House aright.
