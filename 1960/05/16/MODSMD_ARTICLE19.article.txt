Stanford's Marv Mecklenberg, throwing with untiring effort,
pitched and won both ends of Saturday's doubleheader 2-0 and 3-1
against Santa Clara. Meekienberg's performance pulled the Indians
into a third-place tie in the CIBA.
Mecklenbcrg threw relatively few pitches in the two contests. Ho

walked only six in the l(i innings
he worked, showing good control.
The Cai'd hurler struck out five,
but had made the Bronco hitters
pop up or hit weak grounders.
Stanford scored its first run of
the Santa Clara opener in the first
inning. Hal Schut/.mait opened
the inning by getting in the way
of a Steve Schott pitch. Mike Ma
gee bunted him to second. Schutz
man took a big lead and stole
third, coming home when the
pitch got past catcher Ned Brown.
Stanford Scores
Stanford's final run in the con
test came in the sixth inning.
Skip Lawrence singled to right to
open the inning. Jim Burk sacri
ficed successfully, sending Law
rence to second. He scored on
Jim Cowart's safety to left field.
Mecklenbcrg won the second
game with a minimum of hitting
support. Santa Clara pitcher Dick
Williams was stingy in the hit and
run column, giving up only a sin
gle hit. and one earned run.
Stanford drew first blood, pick
ing up a single tally in the fourth
011 a Lawrence walk, a wild pitch
and an infield error or John Hurl
hut's grounder. Santa Clara tied
it up 1 lie next frame when F. X.
McClellan and Manny Sereno sin
gled safely, and first baseman
Cowart misplayed Larry Kaaha's
bunt into a run.
Tribe Ahead
The Indians went ahead to slay
in their half of the fifth when
Mike Filice walked and later
scored on Magee's squeeze bunt.
One great fielding play helper!
Mecklenbcrg in the second game.
Serena hit a towering fly to deep
light center in the second inning
that Schutzman chased and final
ly dived after, catching the ball
just before it dropped in.
On Friday, California defeated

Stanford 8-4, mainly due to pit
cher Jim Smith's wildness. He
gave up five hits, five walks, a
hit batter, and two wild pitches in
his three and two-thirds inning
■stint on the mound. Sloppy field
ing also contributed to t he defeat.
Four hits by Schutzman were
Stanford's only consolation.
Stanford will play San Fran
cisco State here today at 3:l.Vin
a re-scheduled rained-out game of
May 3.
