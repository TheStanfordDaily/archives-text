Opera House down Market Street
in a Peace Walk which climaxed

The Conference recommended
immediate cessation of nuclear
weapons tests and complete dis
armament, leaving all countries
with police forces only. The re
unification of Germany was also
called for.

Dr. Linus Pauling, Nobel Prize
winner, spoke to the rally about
the present nuclear impasse. Ac

annihilate almost the entire U.S.
and a similar number the U.S.S.R.
The U.S. now has 100,000 II- and
A-bombs, and the Soviet Union
has about 50,000.
Before the Peace Rally Pauling
had been picketing the House
Committee on Un-American Activ
ities at City Hall, and he asked
the crowd to support its abolition.
