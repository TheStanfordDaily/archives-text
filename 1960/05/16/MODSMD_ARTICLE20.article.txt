fection. the Indians ran a 440-880-1320-mile in 9:40.6 to crack the

unofficial world standard by 1.4 [
seconds in a feature event of the!
West Coast Relays.
Unfortunately, a team from the
Santa Clara Valley Youth Village
ran 9:34.9 to grab the new official j
American and unofficial world
standard, and leave the Indians !
the national collegiate records as I
their consolation.
A Two-Team Race
The race was strictly a two- ,
teamer after the Stridors dropped
out on the fourth lap and UCLA
fell back on the third leg. The !
Indians took a one-yard lead with
the pass to anchor man Ernie
Cunliffe and held it until there;
were 220 yards to go.
Laszlo Tabori. the Youth Vil
lage's Hungarian miler who had ;
stayed with Cunliffe's torrid pace,
then pulled a Burleson and won
going away with a 3:39.6 or better
mile.
Bob Besse ran his finest-ever
quarter from Ihe blocks, leading
off in about 48 flat, i Press box
clockings ranged from 47.8 to 18.3
due to the officials surrounding
the quarter post across the field.' '

stretch.

yard back as ihe St riders had
moved up. He covered his leg in
1:51.4.

pass a yard back of Jim Beatty as
the Stridors dropped out. The 1320
laps were a blistering 56.5, 61.5
and 48.6 as Lloyd hung with Beat

one of the fastest three-lappers
ever run.

to the lead as Tabori refused to
hold it. Knowing Tabori's kick.
