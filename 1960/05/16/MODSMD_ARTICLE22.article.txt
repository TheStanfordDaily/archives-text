Stanford's varsity golfers,
sharpening up for the coming
AAYVU Championships, took an
easy victory over Cal on the fit
ter's Orinda course.
The team of Pete Choate, Steve
Smith, Phil Underwood, Bill Far
rish, Kent Winton, and Ron Pres
ton all had rounds of 74 or better
to compile a total of 18 1 u points
to 8 1 l> for their traditionally ane
mic rivals.
Leading ihe squad were Choate
with a two under par 70, and
Smith, with a 71. Smith was four
under par with as many holes to
go, but ran into bogey troubles
and had to settle for second hon
ors.
Cal's best was Jim Giffen. who
was even par with a 72. Jim chose
the wrong opponent, however, and
fell to Smith's fine round.
Although this is the final match
of the year for both teams, they
will meet again next week on the
Stanford course in the AAWU In
dividual and Team Champion
ships.
