EUROPE MADE SIMPLE: NO. 2
Last week we discussed England, the first stop on the tour ol
Europe that every American college studenl is going to 1 make
tlii> summer. Today we will discuss your next stop, France—or
the Pearl of the Pacific, as it is generally called.
To get from England to France, one greases one's body and
swims the English Channel. Similarly, to get from 1 ranee to
Spain, one greases one's body and slides down the Pyrenees.
As you can see, the most important single item to take to Europe
is a valise full of grease.
Xo, I am wrong. The most important single item to take to
Europe is a valise full of Marlboro Cigarettes. Oh, what a piece
of work is Marlboro! If you think flavor went out when filters
came in, treat yourself to a Marlboro. The filter works perfect ly,
and yet you get the full, zestful, edifying taste of the choice
tobaccos that precede the filter. This remarkable feat of cigarette
engineering was achieved by Marlboro's research team —l'red
Softpack and Walter Fliptop—and I, for one, am grateful.
Rut I digress. We were speaking of France—or the Serpent of
the Nile, as it is popularly termed. ✓
First let us briefly sum up the history of France. The nation
was discovered in 1402 by Madame Guillotine. There followed
a series of costly wars with .Sehleswig-1 lolstein, the Cleveland
Indians, and Captain Dreyfus. Stability finally came to this
troubled land with the coronation of Marshal l och, who
married Lorraine Alsace and had three children: Flopsy, Mopsy,
and Charlemagne. This later became known as the Petit Trianon.

Marshal Foch—or the Boy Orator of tlie Platte, as lit* was
affectionately called -was succeeded by Napoleon who intro
duced shortness t<> France. I ntil Napoleon, the French were the
tallest nation in Europe. After Napoleon, most Frenchmen were
able to walk comfortably under card tables. This later became
known as the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
Napoleon was finally exiled to Elba where he made the
famous statement, "Able was I ere I saw Elba,' which reads
the same whether you spell it forwards or backwards. Vm can
also spell Marlboro backwards Oroblram. Do not, however,
try to smoke Marlboro backwards because that undoes all the
efficacy of the great Marlboro filter.
After Napoleon's death the French people fell into a great
depression, known as the Louisiana Purchase. For over a cen
tury everybody sat around moping and refusing his food. Phis
torpor was not lifted until Fiffel built his famous tower, which
made everybody giggle so hard that today France is the gayest
country in all Europe.
Each night the colorful natives gather at -idewalk cafes and
shout "00-la-la" as Maurice Chevalier promenades down the
Champs Elysees swinging his Malacca cane. Then, tired but
happy, everyone goes to the Louvre for bowls of onion soup.
The principal industry of France is cashing travelers checks.
Well -ir, I guess that's all you need to know about France.
Next week we'll visit the Land of the Midnight Sun- Spain.

troubled land with the coronation of Marshal l och, who
married Lorraine Alsace and had three children: Flopsy, Mopsy,
and Charlemagne. This later became known as the Petit Trianon.

Marshal Foch—or the Boy Orator of tlie Platte, as lit* was
affectionately called -was succeeded by Napoleon who intro

tallest nation in Europe. After Napoleon, most Frenchmen were
able to walk comfortably under card tables. This later became
known as the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
Napoleon was finally exiled to Elba where he made the
famous statement, "Able was I ere I saw Elba,' which reads
the same whether you spell it forwards or backwards. Vm can
also spell Marlboro backwards Oroblram. Do not, however,
try to smoke Marlboro backwards because that undoes all the
efficacy of the great Marlboro filter.
After Napoleon's death the French people fell into a great
depression, known as the Louisiana Purchase. For over a cen
tury everybody sat around moping and refusing his food. Phis
torpor was not lifted until Fiffel built his famous tower, which
made everybody giggle so hard that today France is the gayest
country in all Europe.
Each night the colorful natives gather at -idewalk cafes and
shout "00-la-la" as Maurice Chevalier promenades down the
Champs Elysees swinging his Malacca cane. Then, tired but
happy, everyone goes to the Louvre for bowls of onion soup.
The principal industry of France is cashing travelers checks.
Well -ir, I guess that's all you need to know about France.
Next week we'll visit the Land of the Midnight Sun- Spain.

EUROPE MADE SIMPLE: NO. 2
Last week we discussed England, the first stop on the tour ol
Europe that every American college studenl is going to 1 make
tlii> summer. Today we will discuss your next stop, France—or
the Pearl of the Pacific, as it is generally called.
To get from England to France, one greases one's body and
swims the English Channel. Similarly, to get from 1 ranee to
Spain, one greases one's body and slides down the Pyrenees.
As you can see, the most important single item to take to Europe
is a valise full of grease.
Xo, I am wrong. The most important single item to take to
Europe is a valise full of Marlboro Cigarettes. Oh, what a piece
of work is Marlboro! If you think flavor went out when filters
came in, treat yourself to a Marlboro. The filter works perfect ly,
and yet you get the full, zestful, edifying taste of the choice
tobaccos that precede the filter. This remarkable feat of cigarette
engineering was achieved by Marlboro's research team —l'red
Softpack and Walter Fliptop—and I, for one, am grateful.
Rut I digress. We were speaking of France—or the Serpent of
the Nile, as it is popularly termed. ✓
First let us briefly sum up the history of France. The nation
was discovered in 1402 by Madame Guillotine. There followed
a series of costly wars with .Sehleswig-1 lolstein, the Cleveland
Indians, and Captain Dreyfus. Stability finally came to this
troubled land with the coronation of Marshal l och, who
