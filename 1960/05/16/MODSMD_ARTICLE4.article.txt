# Alumni Tips Gridders In Thriller
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
Stanford's 1960 football team
served notice in the Stadium Sat
urday that it may be a you
should pardon the expression
winner.
In their 29-28 loss to a star
studded Tribe alumni aggrega
tion, the varsity gridders came up
with some sparkling individual
tnd team play which, if typical of
their capabilities, could mean a
decided improvemnt in the Farm's
football fortunes.
Dick Norman, that pass throw
ing fellow, threw not much, but
well. He hit seven out of 15 aer
ials while being harrassed by a
hefty and hard-charging alumni
line. One of these was a 30-yard
beauty which found Rich I-learney
behind the sleeping alumni pass
defense on the alum's -40. Kear
ney loafed into the end /one.
One situation which was sup
posed to be a real problem for
the' Tribe, turned out to be a
bright spot; namely pass receiv -
ers. With the departure of Chris
Burford and Ben Robinson. Nor
man was supposed to have a hard
time finding targets for his tosses.
He didn't.
Hearney, George Honore and
Steve Pursell. up from the frosh,
will fill the bill nicely and just
as an added attraction, the Cur
t icemen have a cute tackle eligible
play worked out with Dean Hin
shaw as Norman's target.
Then there was the running.
Norman may be throwing less as
of next September, because the
horses look ready. Gil Dowd and
Mike Doherty, another frosh,
cracked through for good yardage
often and even Norman, not the
fastest of men, once broke loose
for a 35-yard gain.
Defen.se Problem
Defensively there will be prob
lems next year, but there were
flashes of competence here too.
All that need be added is a little
consistency. Frosh Tim Hansel
along with the Pursell combina
tion Steve and Doug the Hin
shaw duo Dean and Chet Hear
ney, Honor© and Dowd dropped
the alums for losses every so
often.
As a matter of fact at one time
in the game Sid Garber in his first
appearance as an alum got dump
ed by Dowd and Honore for a
loss of It), made it up with a 16-
yard pass to Carl Isaacs and on
the next play ended up with
Hearney sitting on him eight
yards behind the line of scrim
mage.
As for the alumns what can be

said? They won and deservedly
so. John Brodie and Gary Kerko
rian taught the undergrads how
passes are thrown and Bill McColl,
Chris Burford and Ben Robinson
showed how they are caught.
Wiggin
For a while it looked like Paul
Wiggin mighi not see action in
the alumni line, but in the third
quarter the Cleveland Brown lum
bered in and cracked a few skulls.
It was a happy day for the
alumni rooters and their misera
ble band, but present day Stan
fordites also had something to
cheer about. Maybe they will
next vear too.

It was a happy day for the
alumni rooters and their misera

cheer about. Maybe they will

Stanford's 1960 football team
served notice in the Stadium Sat
urday that it may be a you
should pardon the expression
winner.
In their 29-28 loss to a star
studded Tribe alumni aggrega
tion, the varsity gridders came up
with some sparkling individual
tnd team play which, if typical of
their capabilities, could mean a
decided improvemnt in the Farm's
football fortunes.
Dick Norman, that pass throw
ing fellow, threw not much, but
well. He hit seven out of 15 aer
ials while being harrassed by a
hefty and hard-charging alumni
line. One of these was a 30-yard
beauty which found Rich I-learney
behind the sleeping alumni pass
defense on the alum's -40. Kear
ney loafed into the end /one.
One situation which was sup
posed to be a real problem for
the' Tribe, turned out to be a
bright spot; namely pass receiv -
ers. With the departure of Chris
Burford and Ben Robinson. Nor
man was supposed to have a hard
time finding targets for his tosses.
He didn't.
Hearney, George Honore and
Steve Pursell. up from the frosh,
will fill the bill nicely and just
as an added attraction, the Cur
t icemen have a cute tackle eligible
play worked out with Dean Hin
shaw as Norman's target.
Then there was the running.
Norman may be throwing less as
of next September, because the
horses look ready. Gil Dowd and
Mike Doherty, another frosh,
cracked through for good yardage
often and even Norman, not the
fastest of men, once broke loose
for a 35-yard gain.
Defen.se Problem
Defensively there will be prob
lems next year, but there were
flashes of competence here too.
All that need be added is a little
consistency. Frosh Tim Hansel
along with the Pursell combina
tion Steve and Doug the Hin
shaw duo Dean and Chet Hear
ney, Honor© and Dowd dropped
the alums for losses every so
often.
As a matter of fact at one time
in the game Sid Garber in his first
appearance as an alum got dump
ed by Dowd and Honore for a
loss of It), made it up with a 16-
yard pass to Carl Isaacs and on
the next play ended up with
Hearney sitting on him eight
yards behind the line of scrim
mage.
As for the alumns what can be

said? They won and deservedly
so. John Brodie and Gary Kerko
rian taught the undergrads how
passes are thrown and Bill McColl,
Chris Burford and Ben Robinson
showed how they are caught.
