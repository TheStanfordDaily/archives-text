# Stanford Student Declines To Answer Sub-Committee
## Riot Scene Described 
### Barry Greenberg 
The largo group of students
who congregated Friday morning
outside of the courtroom in City
Hall where the House Un-Ameri
can Committee Hearings were
proceeding were, in the main,
quite orderly.
The students' songs and chants
barely filtered through the huge,
closed oak doors to reach the audi
ence inside. "Battle Hymn of the
Republic" and"The Star Spangled
Banner" held the lop spots on
these students' Hit Parade. Such
chants as "Committee go home!"
"Committee go home!" could also
be heard.
As the Hearings were about to
recess for a long lunch, tension
began to rise and the students
were warned not to riot. As the
people within the court slowly
filtered out and down the marble
steps to the outside, the students
remained orderly as requested.
There seemed to be no danger
of any riot.
But the quiet that reigned at
the beginning of the lunch recess
was deceiving. The students, none
of whom recessed for lunch, re
mained adamantly stationed be
hind the wooden blockades that
the police had set up in front of
the Hearings room.
Riot Starts
At 1:15, approximately a half
hour before the hearings were to
reconvene, emotions reached a
bubbling-over point and all hell
broke loose.
The bloody riot was reputedly
touched off when a student
g r a b be d a black-shirted cop's
night-stick and crunched him over
the head with it. This apparently
didn't go over too well with the
black- s hi r t who promptly
crunched the student.
The cops, all of whom looked
rougher than a stucco bathtub,
were ordered to turn fire hoses
upon the heated students, but this
stunt accomplished little except
to make City Hall look as if it
had been inundated by a gigantic
tidal wave.
Wedge Formed
The students refused to back
up from the powerful torrents of
water, chanting over and over
again, "We won't be hosed,'' "We
won't be hosed." So, the cops were
ordered to form a flying wedge
to push the soggy students down,
the steps and into the street
where some nice, dry paddy wa
gons were waiting for them.
This tactic was more successful
than the hose affair, but the stu
dents gave ground dearly. One
student, obviously one of the
leaders, got into a scuffle with
one bruiser of a black-shirt, who.
with the assistance of some of
his cohorts, dragged the student
behind a pillar where they pro
ceeded to belt the living daylights
out of him.
Many Injured
The cops were finally called off
the hunt but not before they had
left the student a bloody ness.
Many others were injured as stu
dents were dragged down the
steps along with the cascading
water. Some policemen suffered

heart attacks from the activity.
Among those thrown into the
waiting paddy wagons was Stan
ford student Ken Pureell who ran
in the recent ASSU elections for
president.
Pureell saw Inspector Cahill
dragging a girl down the steps
and rushed to her defense, push
ing Inspector M cGuire in the
process. Pushing Inspector Me-
Guire is perhaps not the wisest
thing one can do, although Pur
cell seemed justifiably provoked,
so off he was whisked.
Released 011 Buil
Held two hours at the city
prison before being released, Pur
cell was charged with inciting a
riot, disturbing the peace and re
sisting arrest. He was released
on $210 bail and his hearing comes
up today at 10 a.m. in Municipal
Court, San Francisco.
"I am no agitator, but I want
to register an honest and serious
complaint against the police
force," Pureell said. "Once one

witnessed the police brutality, one ,
! could not stay neutral," he con- i
tinned.
Pureell related that it seemed
j to him that the police were of the
I opinion that the riots were only
| another instance of juveniles hav-1
i ing a good time for themselves.j
i "If this badly mistaken assump
tion continues, then it will cer- j
tainly be a black day in the his- j
; tory of San Fran c is c o," he
strongly asserted.
Not Communist-Led
"The students were sincere in I
i their protest against this infrac
; tion of American civil liberties,"
j Pureell said. He also stated that
| he was sure that the riots were
; not Communist-led or Communist-
Agitated.
One of Purcell's comments
seems to sum up the general
feeling of most of the students:
j "There were some hot-heads in
j the group, but most of the stu
j dents were orderly and did not
| resort to violence; they could have
; been brought under control by
better means ... if the cops didn't
I commit blunders."

At 1:15, approximately a half
hour before the hearings were to
reconvene, emotions reached a
bubbling-over point and all hell
broke loose.
The bloody riot was reputedly
touched off when a student
g r a b be d a black-shirted cop's
night-stick and crunched him over
the head with it. This apparently
didn't go over too well with the
black- s hi r t who promptly
crunched the student.
The cops, all of whom looked
rougher than a stucco bathtub,
were ordered to turn fire hoses
upon the heated students, but this
stunt accomplished little except
to make City Hall look as if it
had been inundated by a gigantic
tidal wave.
Wedge Formed
The students refused to back
up from the powerful torrents of
water, chanting over and over
again, "We won't be hosed,'' "We
won't be hosed." So, the cops were
ordered to form a flying wedge
to push the soggy students down,
the steps and into the street
where some nice, dry paddy wa
gons were waiting for them.
This tactic was more successful
than the hose affair, but the stu
dents gave ground dearly. One
student, obviously one of the
leaders, got into a scuffle with
one bruiser of a black-shirt, who.
with the assistance of some of
his cohorts, dragged the student
behind a pillar where they pro
ceeded to belt the living daylights
out of him.
Many Injured
The cops were finally called off
the hunt but not before they had
left the student a bloody ness.
Many others were injured as stu
dents were dragged down the
steps along with the cascading
water. Some policemen suffered

heart attacks from the activity.
Among those thrown into the
waiting paddy wagons was Stan
ford student Ken Pureell who ran
in the recent ASSU elections for
president.
Pureell saw Inspector Cahill
dragging a girl down the steps
and rushed to her defense, push
ing Inspector M cGuire in the
process. Pushing Inspector Me-
Guire is perhaps not the wisest
thing one can do, although Pur
cell seemed justifiably provoked,
so off he was whisked.
Released 011 Buil
Held two hours at the city
prison before being released, Pur
cell was charged with inciting a
riot, disturbing the peace and re
sisting arrest. He was released
on $210 bail and his hearing comes
up today at 10 a.m. in Municipal
Court, San Francisco.
"I am no agitator, but I want
to register an honest and serious
complaint against the police
force," Pureell said. "Once one

witnessed the police brutality, one ,
! could not stay neutral," he con- i
tinned.
Pureell related that it seemed
j to him that the police were of the
I opinion that the riots were only
| another instance of juveniles hav-1
i ing a good time for themselves.j
i "If this badly mistaken assump
tion continues, then it will cer- j
tainly be a black day in the his- j
; tory of San Fran c is c o," he
strongly asserted.
Not Communist-Led
"The students were sincere in I
i their protest against this infrac
; tion of American civil liberties,"
j Pureell said. He also stated that
| he was sure that the riots were
; not Communist-led or Communist-
Agitated.
One of Purcell's comments
seems to sum up the general
feeling of most of the students:
j "There were some hot-heads in
j the group, but most of the stu
j dents were orderly and did not
| resort to violence; they could have
; been brought under control by
better means ... if the cops didn't
I commit blunders."
The largo group of students
who congregated Friday morning
outside of the courtroom in City
Hall where the House Un-Ameri
can Committee Hearings were
proceeding were, in the main,
quite orderly.
The students' songs and chants
barely filtered through the huge,
closed oak doors to reach the audi
ence inside. "Battle Hymn of the
Republic" and"The Star Spangled
Banner" held the lop spots on
these students' Hit Parade. Such
chants as "Committee go home!"
"Committee go home!" could also
be heard.
As the Hearings were about to
recess for a long lunch, tension
began to rise and the students
were warned not to riot. As the
people within the court slowly
filtered out and down the marble
steps to the outside, the students
remained orderly as requested.
There seemed to be no danger
of any riot.
But the quiet that reigned at
the beginning of the lunch recess
was deceiving. The students, none
of whom recessed for lunch, re
mained adamantly stationed be
hind the wooden blockades that
the police had set up in front of
the Hearings room.

heart attacks from the activity.
Among those thrown into the
waiting paddy wagons was Stan
ford student Ken Pureell who ran
in the recent ASSU elections for
president.
Pureell saw Inspector Cahill
dragging a girl down the steps
and rushed to her defense, push
ing Inspector M cGuire in the
process. Pushing Inspector Me-
Guire is perhaps not the wisest
thing one can do, although Pur
cell seemed justifiably provoked,
so off he was whisked.
Released 011 Buil
Held two hours at the city
prison before being released, Pur
cell was charged with inciting a
riot, disturbing the peace and re
sisting arrest. He was released
on $210 bail and his hearing comes
up today at 10 a.m. in Municipal
Court, San Francisco.
"I am no agitator, but I want
to register an honest and serious
complaint against the police
force," Pureell said. "Once one

witnessed the police brutality, one ,
! could not stay neutral," he con- i
tinned.
Pureell related that it seemed
j to him that the police were of the
I opinion that the riots were only
| another instance of juveniles hav-1
i ing a good time for themselves.j
i "If this badly mistaken assump
tion continues, then it will cer- j
tainly be a black day in the his- j
; tory of San Fran c is c o," he
strongly asserted.
Not Communist-Led
"The students were sincere in I
i their protest against this infrac
; tion of American civil liberties,"
j Pureell said. He also stated that
| he was sure that the riots were
; not Communist-led or Communist-
Agitated.
One of Purcell's comments
seems to sum up the general
feeling of most of the students:
j "There were some hot-heads in
j the group, but most of the stu
j dents were orderly and did not
| resort to violence; they could have
; been brought under control by
better means ... if the cops didn't
I commit blunders."
The largo group of students
who congregated Friday morning
outside of the courtroom in City
Hall where the House Un-Ameri
can Committee Hearings were
proceeding were, in the main,
quite orderly.
The students' songs and chants
barely filtered through the huge,
closed oak doors to reach the audi
ence inside. "Battle Hymn of the
Republic" and"The Star Spangled
Banner" held the lop spots on
these students' Hit Parade. Such
chants as "Committee go home!"
"Committee go home!" could also
be heard.
As the Hearings were about to
recess for a long lunch, tension
began to rise and the students
were warned not to riot. As the
people within the court slowly
filtered out and down the marble
steps to the outside, the students
remained orderly as requested.
There seemed to be no danger
of any riot.
But the quiet that reigned at
the beginning of the lunch recess
was deceiving. The students, none
of whom recessed for lunch, re
mained adamantly stationed be
hind the wooden blockades that
the police had set up in front of
the Hearings room.
Riot Starts
At 1:15, approximately a half
hour before the hearings were to
reconvene, emotions reached a
bubbling-over point and all hell
broke loose.
The bloody riot was reputedly
touched off when a student
g r a b be d a black-shirted cop's
night-stick and crunched him over
the head with it. This apparently
didn't go over too well with the
black- s hi r t who promptly
crunched the student.
The cops, all of whom looked
rougher than a stucco bathtub,
were ordered to turn fire hoses
upon the heated students, but this
stunt accomplished little except
to make City Hall look as if it
had been inundated by a gigantic
tidal wave.
Wedge Formed
The students refused to back
up from the powerful torrents of
water, chanting over and over
again, "We won't be hosed,'' "We
won't be hosed." So, the cops were
ordered to form a flying wedge
to push the soggy students down,
the steps and into the street
where some nice, dry paddy wa
gons were waiting for them.
