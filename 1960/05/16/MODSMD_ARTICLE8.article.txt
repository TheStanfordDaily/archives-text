# Committee Has No Choice In Methods, Says Chairman
## 
### Austin Scott 
"The House Committee on Un-
American Activities subpoenas
only known Communists â€” per
sons the committee knows with
out doubt are actively working in
the Communist Party toward the
overthrow of the United States
Government.
"We get our information from
certain confidential unimpeacha
ble sources. We know Ihe per
sons we question are active in
the Communist Party, but the
only way we can act on our knowl
edge is to get the information on
the public record.
"For this reason we must fol
low the line of questioning you
have seen here today. We cannot
let these people make a mockery
of the United States Congress."
The above words were spoken
by Congressman Edwin E. Willis

(D.-La.), chairman of the House
Un-American- Activities subcom
mittee, which sal in San Fran
cisco last Thursday, Friday and
Saturday.
No Choice
He told this reporter in a half
hour private interview that the
committee has no choice but to
operate in the manner it does:
"The House Committee on Un-
American Activities exists under
a mandate from the United States
Congress for the purpose of in
quiring into the extent, character
and objectives of the Communist
Party in order to appraise the
effectiveness of legisation design
ed to protect the internal security
of this nation.
"We keep a watchful eye on
Communist activities and recom
mend to Congress new legislation
and changes in old legislation so
as to keep track mor<* effectively
of Communist activity in the
United States.
"These people (the ones sub
poenaed by the committee) come
in here and disrupt the orderly
manner of our procedure. You
saw the fuss Archie Brown
made." (Brown was thrown out
of the hearings three times in two
days for raising a rucus.)
Tliey Hun Over You
"You saw what happens when
we try to be nice to them. If you
give them a little bit of leeway,
they run right over you. We know
these people are active Commu
nists. They are dangerous and
are trying to make fools of us
(United Slates). We cannot have
this."
Commenting on the charge that
the committee issued passes to
its friends way in advance of the
hearings, Willis said:
"The first time I heard about
the passes was yesterday (Fri
day* in the hearings. I don't know
anything about them. Mr. Whee-
ler (private investigator for the
committee) makes all the ar
rangements months in advance."
On the demonstration* and dem
onstrators:
"I think this whole affair most
unfortunate. These students are,
I am sure, very intelligent and
sincere. I wouldn't want to say
whether they are being led by
Communist sympathizers.
"My guess is that they are not,
but that Communists are infil
trating the crowd. These ele
ments are causing all the trouble.
"The Communist Party in San
Francisco is having a field day.
(This reporter had previously
interviewed Archie Brown who in
response to the question "What
line of questioning do you think
the committee will take?" said:
"Well, they'll ask me if I'm a
Communist. Sure I'm a Commu
nist. I've been a Communist for
23 years. They have my name on
a hundred lists as being a Com
munist, and they can look it up
if they want to know. I'm not go
ing to tell them."
