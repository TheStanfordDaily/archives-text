# HR Unveils Project Africa For Next Year
## 
### 
Africa, the continent which enlightened people no longer consider
the "sleeping giant," has aroused the interest of the Institute of
International Relations which is in the process of planning a pro
gram to send Stanford students to this land of fast-growing impor
tance.
The name of the program is Project Africa and has been conceived

as a diplomatic mission of Stan
ford students to promote better
understanding between Africans
and Americans.
The lIR plans to send the first
group of students next summer,
who will present and explain the
ideas and ideals of America, and
will learn about those of Africa.
Students will be presenting
America's ideas and ideals not as
representatives of official U.S.
policy, but rather as individual
Americans with differing points
of view. In the year following
they will work to promote the un
derstanding of Africa in the U.S.
via speeches, panel discussions,
personal contacts, etc.
Coordinator
Under the auspices of the lIR
and the Associated Students, Proj
ect Africa requires at least the
part-time service of one person to
coordinate the selection and train
ing of the students, travel plans,
finances, and so on. Anyone in
terested in serving as chairman
should contact A 1 Kahn or Bill
Sterling at the lIR Shack before
the end of the quarter.
The entire trip would take ap
proximately three months, includ
ing a short duration spent in New
York for special training, and two
to two and one-half months in
Africa itself.
It is hoped that the students
vvould be able to visit the three
different types of African states,
such as Ghana, Kenya, and the
Union of South Africa, although
the trip may have to be restricted
to one area such as eastern Af
rica.
Applicants
The plan is to spend time in
African communities of all types,
but with special emphasis placed
on visiting colleges and universi
ties.
Next fall, approximately thirty
students will be selecetd by a com
mittee composed of faculty mem
bers. Deans, and students. In ad
dition to applications, students
will be interviewed and will have
mental and physical tests; they
will be selected for their mental
maturity and balance, stability,
and stamina.
After an intensive training pe
riod the final five to ten will be
selected by a committee which
will include the leader of the
training seminars, Deans, faculty
members, and students.
Members of this committee will
have sat in on the training semi
nars and the final selection will
be made on the basis of participa
tion in them and the following
three requirements: the group
should be composed of at least
three girls; as a minimum, half of
the group should be boys; and
over half of the group should be
returning to Stanford the follow
ing Fall quarter.
Project Africa will cost roughly
$12,000 to $16,000. probably closer
to the upper figure, according to
A 1 Kahn, president of the lIR.
Students wanting more infor
mation on Project Africa are
asked by Kahn to drop over to the
lIR Shack as soon as possible.

Coordinator
Under the auspices of the lIR
and the Associated Students, Proj
ect Africa requires at least the
part-time service of one person to
coordinate the selection and train
ing of the students, travel plans,
finances, and so on. Anyone in
terested in serving as chairman
should contact A 1 Kahn or Bill
Sterling at the lIR Shack before
the end of the quarter.
The entire trip would take ap
proximately three months, includ
ing a short duration spent in New
York for special training, and two
to two and one-half months in
Africa itself.
It is hoped that the students
vvould be able to visit the three
different types of African states,
such as Ghana, Kenya, and the
Union of South Africa, although
the trip may have to be restricted
to one area such as eastern Af
rica.
Applicants
The plan is to spend time in
African communities of all types,
but with special emphasis placed
on visiting colleges and universi
ties.
Next fall, approximately thirty
students will be selecetd by a com
mittee composed of faculty mem
bers. Deans, and students. In ad
dition to applications, students
will be interviewed and will have
mental and physical tests; they
will be selected for their mental
maturity and balance, stability,
and stamina.
After an intensive training pe
riod the final five to ten will be
selected by a committee which
will include the leader of the
training seminars, Deans, faculty
members, and students.
Members of this committee will
have sat in on the training semi
nars and the final selection will
be made on the basis of participa
tion in them and the following
three requirements: the group
should be composed of at least
three girls; as a minimum, half of
the group should be boys; and
over half of the group should be
returning to Stanford the follow
ing Fall quarter.
Project Africa will cost roughly
$12,000 to $16,000. probably closer
to the upper figure, according to
A 1 Kahn, president of the lIR.
Students wanting more infor
mation on Project Africa are
asked by Kahn to drop over to the
lIR Shack as soon as possible.
Africa, the continent which enlightened people no longer consider
the "sleeping giant," has aroused the interest of the Institute of
International Relations which is in the process of planning a pro
gram to send Stanford students to this land of fast-growing impor
tance.
The name of the program is Project Africa and has been conceived

as a diplomatic mission of Stan
ford students to promote better
understanding between Africans
and Americans.
The lIR plans to send the first
group of students next summer,
who will present and explain the
ideas and ideals of America, and
will learn about those of Africa.
Students will be presenting
America's ideas and ideals not as
representatives of official U.S.
policy, but rather as individual
Americans with differing points
of view. In the year following
they will work to promote the un
derstanding of Africa in the U.S.
via speeches, panel discussions,
personal contacts, etc.
