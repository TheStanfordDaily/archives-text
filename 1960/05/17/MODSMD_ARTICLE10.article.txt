# Russian Chief Calls Off Ike's June Trip to Moscow
## 
### 
PARIS (/P) —British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan strove des
perately today to revive the collapsed summit conference.
The conference boiled to an angry end yesterday over a blaze of
Soviet-American recriminations.
One thing was sure: President Eisenhower's June visit to the

soviet Utuon is oil.
In his initial efforts late last j
night, Macmillan failed in a talk i
lasting an hour and 35 minutes \
to placate Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev.
But the British said contact is
| being maintained with the Rus
sians on the off chance that the
breach could be healed.
Macmillan a n d Khrushchev
were expected to confer again to
day.
But a source close to the French
delegation said, "It would be ex
tremely difficult to see how the'
; summit conference could con
tinue."
Spy Incident
Despite official statements to
ihe contrary, all meetings here
the last two days with regard to
the summit have dealt exclusively
with the spy plane incident.
The general impression in
French circles was that President
Charles de Gaulle does not want
the conference to resume at all
unless Khrushchev drops all talk
about the plane incident.
President Eisenhower's order
to suspend U.S. intelligence
flights went out last Thursday to
! U.S. Defense Secretary Thomas S.
Gates Jr. and the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
Trade Charges
Eisenhower and Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev traded charges
| yesterday with all the chill of the
j cold wars' bleakest days.
Each accused the other of tor
| pedoing the session,
j At yesterday's first meeting of
the Big Four. Khrushchev tensely
refused to negotiate with the U.S.
chief executive unless the Presi
dent apologized for the flight of
the intelligence plane shot down
May 1 over the Soviet Union.
Khrushchev called for a delay
: of six or eight months in the Big
| Four session — a delay which
would convene it near or beyond
the end of Eisenhower's second
four-year term.
Eisenhower grimly accused
! Khrushchev of c o m i n g to Paris
armed with an ultimatum and
iwith "the sole intention of sabo
taging this meeting, on which so
much of the hopes of the world
I have rested."
Spy Mights Knd
lie promised there would be no
more U.S. spy flights over the So
1 viet Union, but announced he
came to Paris to seek agreements
; to end all forms of espionage. He
i said if it proved impossible U*
; come to grips here with that and
other issues threatening world
peace, lie planned to submit to
tho United Nations soon a propo-
I sal for creation of a U.N. aerial
■surveillance to detect preparations
i for attack.
! In an atmosphere of gloom un
relieved by the splendor of the
Elysee Palace, the site of the
gathering, the four leaders of the
.world's great powers sat through
| a stormy session of three hours
! and five minutes.
Little Hope
When it was all over, there
seemed little left of the hopes for
the summit but a pile of wreckage
(buried under a torrent, of bitter
i words. It was a Soviet-American
| show.
The faint hope for more ses
sions rested mainly with Dc
| Gaulle.
Dc Gaulle proposed that the
American and Soviet leaders take
a day off for reflection and cool
ing down. White House Press sec
! rotary James C. Hagerty said any
I initiative for resuming the meet
ing would have to come from
De Gaulle.
Western sources said De Gaulle,
in an attempt to avert complete
j collapse of the summit, would see
j Khrushchev today.
Macmillan had a meeting late
i in the day with De Gaulle to
1 discuss "methods of continuing
the conference."
Middleman
The British Prime Minister,
who has regarded himself a mid
dleman in efforts to case East-
West troubles, emerged looking
much as if he had just been to
a funeral.
Macmillan had told Krushchev
