It is difficult to write a tribute befitting Alexander Miller,
lor one does not know where to begin. His lile was filled with;
an eager interest in students, a eonstant striving for academic
know ledge, a heartfelt desire to make friends and a clear devo
tion to his faith.
His main friends and acquaintances at Stanford and all over j
the world will retain a warm memory of a man whose lile was
well spent and intelligent l\ directed.
President \\ allace Sterling has expressed an extremely appro
priate encomium to Alexander Miller:
.
'"'llis contributions to the Stanford community were manifold.
}1 is scholarship was of 11 i «.•: 11 quality, his interest in undergraduate,
education and in the lives of the students was lively and construc
tive. His sympathy for his fellow-man was ready and warm. His
resources of friendship were abundant and were brightened by
gifts of wit and speech. Stanford's strength as a university has
been diminished l>\ his passing. Stanford men and women have
suffered a personal loss."
