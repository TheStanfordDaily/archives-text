South' of tlic newspaper comment on llic student protests
against the House Un-American Activities Committee lias been
extremeh unfair and reflects a traditional yet unsubstantiated
attitude toward university students.
It seems, according to Hearst s Fxaminer, that the students '
who were arrested on Friday and the more than 3000 students
who assemhh'd before City Hall on Saturday were "(loaded into
defiance of the established order 1>\ people who are Communists. j
Furthermore, these students were "lull ol the restless audi
reckless energy of springtime: a pantv raid would have served i
their purposes as well.
Undeniably, some of the crowd protesting the Committee's
hearings had come along for the fun, and others may have been
incited In Communist agitators, as the Committee wasted an
hour Saturday trying frantically to prove.
But a very large segment ol the picketers and protesters were i
mature college students who actually (ell that the Committee!
infringes on civil liberties and who were determined to show!
their opposition in the most effective way they could find.
'lo dismiss their protest as a college stunt is to deny the intel
ligence and education ol those students. Certainly, lew students j
would picket for eight hours and forego lunch in the same spirit
in which they would join a pantv raid.
Although the demonstrations may have been organized by j
professional agitators, the Examiner was the only paper that
had that impression after interviewing a number of the arrested
st udents.
The fact that most of the demonstrators were college students
does not show, as Mr. Hearst would like people to think, that the
protests were onl\ signs of emotion inspired b\ warm weather, j
The convictions of these students indicate that their opposition
was the result of careful and informed thought.
