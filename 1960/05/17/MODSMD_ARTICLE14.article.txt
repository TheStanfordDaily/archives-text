# LOOKING AROUND
## The 						Committee 
### Ron Rapoport Associate Editor 
To gain a little perspective out
of the Bay Area appearance of
the House un-American Activities
Subcommittee over the weekend,
perhaps it would be a good idea
to start out with a question.
Namely, were the Committee's
hearings successful? Unfortu
nately for most people concerned
with freedom of the individual,
the answer must be that the hear
ings were indeed a success.
Speaking at Kepler's Bookstore
a few days before the Committee
started proceedings, Frank Wil
kinson, executive secretary of a
group organized to fight tho Com
mittee, said that the main objec
tive of his organization was to
keep as many people as possible
from losing their jobs merely be
cause they receive subpoenas. His
group and the rest of the mob out
side city hall failed in this respect.
Notwithstanding tho large num
ber of witnesses who refused to
answer the Committee's ques
tions, some of the testimony was
of a job-losing nature such that
Arens, Willis and the rest of the
boys are probably very happy
with the results of their inquisi
tion.
Star Witness
Star witness for the un-Ameri
cans was Karl Prussion, a fami
liar type. Prussion is another in
the seemingly endless line of the
"1 was a Communist for the FBI
and found God" variety which are
permanent fixtures in such hear
ings.
His particular story was that he
joined the Communists in 1933
(his impressionable youth) and
became a special agent for the
FBI in 1947, but kept his party
membership until last year so he
could keep an eye on the goings
on for the feds.
At the hearings Prussion named
24 people as having been mem
bers of tho Palo Alto-Los Altos-
Mountain View cell of the Com
munist Party. Included in the

group were six teachers, a ball
bearing salesman, a civil engineer,
a welder and a lady farmer.
Beside the Point
Whether these people ever did
go to the meeting that Prussion
says he saw them at and whether
they were or are members of the
Communist Party is beside the
point. These people will have no
chance to publicly clear them
selves of the very serious charges
that this ex-Communist turned su
per-patriot has leveled at them.
There will be no trial. Prussion
will never have to prove his
charges and have them subjected
to cross-examination by the law
yers of the accused. Tho Commit
tee has done its job and left, and
six teachers, a ball-bearing sales
man, a civil engineer, a welder, a
lady farmer and 14 others may
lose their jobs.
Prussion is not tho only "friend
ly" witness who appeared before
the committee. There were a few
others who also "named names"
and as a result several other peo
ple are in the kind of trouble that
is impossible to get out of. Be
assured of one thing, the hearings
were a definite success.
Is the End Near?
As for the riots, another ques
tion presents ilself. Are they like
ly to lead to the end of the Com
mittee?
Right now the anti-Committee
sentiment in the House of Repre
sentatives is at its peak. Jimmy
Roosevelt's bill to abolish the
Commit too is ponding. It report
edly has a lot of support includ
ing that of the most influential
single member of the House, Sam
Rayburn.
The public reaction in San Fran
cisco could have one of two ef
fects. It could convince the ma
jority of the House that the Com
mittee has outlived its usefulness
and should be abolished. Or op
position to Roosevelt's bill could
stiffen under a "Congress won't
be intimidated by a bunch of
Commies and kids" sentiment.
Hopefully the House will see
where its duty lies.

Star Witness
Star witness for the un-Ameri
cans was Karl Prussion, a fami
liar type. Prussion is another in
the seemingly endless line of the
"1 was a Communist for the FBI
and found God" variety which are
permanent fixtures in such hear
ings.
His particular story was that he
joined the Communists in 1933
(his impressionable youth) and
became a special agent for the
FBI in 1947, but kept his party
membership until last year so he
could keep an eye on the goings
on for the feds.
At the hearings Prussion named
24 people as having been mem
bers of tho Palo Alto-Los Altos-
Mountain View cell of the Com
munist Party. Included in the

group were six teachers, a ball
bearing salesman, a civil engineer,
a welder and a lady farmer.
Beside the Point
Whether these people ever did
go to the meeting that Prussion
says he saw them at and whether
they were or are members of the
Communist Party is beside the
point. These people will have no
chance to publicly clear them
selves of the very serious charges
that this ex-Communist turned su
per-patriot has leveled at them.
There will be no trial. Prussion
will never have to prove his
charges and have them subjected
to cross-examination by the law
yers of the accused. Tho Commit
tee has done its job and left, and
six teachers, a ball-bearing sales
man, a civil engineer, a welder, a
lady farmer and 14 others may
lose their jobs.
Prussion is not tho only "friend
ly" witness who appeared before
the committee. There were a few
others who also "named names"
and as a result several other peo
ple are in the kind of trouble that
is impossible to get out of. Be
assured of one thing, the hearings
were a definite success.
Is the End Near?
As for the riots, another ques
tion presents ilself. Are they like
ly to lead to the end of the Com
mittee?
Right now the anti-Committee
sentiment in the House of Repre
sentatives is at its peak. Jimmy
Roosevelt's bill to abolish the
Commit too is ponding. It report
edly has a lot of support includ
ing that of the most influential
single member of the House, Sam
Rayburn.
The public reaction in San Fran
cisco could have one of two ef
fects. It could convince the ma
jority of the House that the Com
mittee has outlived its usefulness
and should be abolished. Or op
position to Roosevelt's bill could
stiffen under a "Congress won't
be intimidated by a bunch of
Commies and kids" sentiment.
Hopefully the House will see
where its duty lies.
To gain a little perspective out
of the Bay Area appearance of
the House un-American Activities
Subcommittee over the weekend,
perhaps it would be a good idea
to start out with a question.
Namely, were the Committee's
hearings successful? Unfortu
nately for most people concerned
with freedom of the individual,
the answer must be that the hear
ings were indeed a success.
Speaking at Kepler's Bookstore
a few days before the Committee
started proceedings, Frank Wil
kinson, executive secretary of a
group organized to fight tho Com
mittee, said that the main objec
tive of his organization was to
keep as many people as possible
from losing their jobs merely be
cause they receive subpoenas. His
group and the rest of the mob out
side city hall failed in this respect.
Notwithstanding tho large num
ber of witnesses who refused to
answer the Committee's ques
tions, some of the testimony was
of a job-losing nature such that
Arens, Willis and the rest of the
boys are probably very happy
with the results of their inquisi
tion.
