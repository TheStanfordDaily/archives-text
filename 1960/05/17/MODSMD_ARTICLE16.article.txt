# 'TOUCH OF VENUS'
## Production of Weill Play Now in S.F. 
### Jerry Clinton 
The Venus of Kurt Weill'*; One
Touch of Venus is the Homeric
love goddess herself, miraculously
returned from statue to life by
a chance encounter, in Lower
Manhattan, with Rodney Hatch,
an unsuccessful barber, with
whom, for no special reason, she
falls in love.
Venus, ossified, has reached
New York through the kind
offices pf Whitelaw Savory, a
wealthy patron of modern art
who abhors anything more than,
say, ten years old, save this one
ancient statue which has a curi
ous resemblance to an old flamo
of his.
Other participants in this farci
cal excursion into mythology and
satire are Rodney's five year fi
ance, Gloria, a neat amalgam of
feminine vices, her mother, Sav
ory's secretary, a conscientious
vamp, assorted New York types,
and a gaggle of singing-dancing
art students.
The production of Weill's work
—book-lyrics by S. J. Perelman
and Ogden Nash—presently being
staged by the Great Plays Com
pany has much to recommend it.
Both Yvonne Lynn, who plays
Venus, and Jack Bull, the extra
ordinarily fortunate barber, have
good, rich voices and wonderfully
clear, firm projection.
Miss Lynn plays Venus as a
frolicsome, honestly sensual god
dess whose straightforward pur
suit of what she knows is peren
nially most dear to the human
heart is a continuing source of
anguish to Rodney, played by Bull
as the very type of the frustrated
young man who doesn't quite
know what to do when the lady,
at last, says yes.
Muffin Preston also gives a
fine rendering of Rodney's coun
terpart, the inverted Miss Ameri
ca, and the best of Nash's lyrics
provide some fresh comic insights
on the innately cliche subject of
young romance.
Unfortunately, the progress of
this promising comedy is periodi
cally interrupted by spates of
choreography, unmatchable for
their tedious obscurity. And while
much is made of a few of the
minor roles, too often they are
merely tepid caricatures.
Dean Goodman's direction fails
to unite the various elements of
the work, giving the impression
rather of a patchily successful
review than a continuous dra
matic production.

a chance encounter, in Lower
Manhattan, with Rodney Hatch,
an unsuccessful barber, with
whom, for no special reason, she
falls in love.
Venus, ossified, has reached
New York through the kind
offices pf Whitelaw Savory, a
wealthy patron of modern art
who abhors anything more than,
say, ten years old, save this one
ancient statue which has a curi
ous resemblance to an old flamo
of his.
Other participants in this farci
cal excursion into mythology and
satire are Rodney's five year fi
ance, Gloria, a neat amalgam of
feminine vices, her mother, Sav
ory's secretary, a conscientious
vamp, assorted New York types,
and a gaggle of singing-dancing
art students.
The production of Weill's work
—book-lyrics by S. J. Perelman
and Ogden Nash—presently being
staged by the Great Plays Com
pany has much to recommend it.
Both Yvonne Lynn, who plays
Venus, and Jack Bull, the extra
ordinarily fortunate barber, have
good, rich voices and wonderfully
clear, firm projection.
Miss Lynn plays Venus as a
frolicsome, honestly sensual god
dess whose straightforward pur
suit of what she knows is peren
nially most dear to the human
heart is a continuing source of
anguish to Rodney, played by Bull
as the very type of the frustrated
young man who doesn't quite
know what to do when the lady,
at last, says yes.
Muffin Preston also gives a
fine rendering of Rodney's coun
terpart, the inverted Miss Ameri
ca, and the best of Nash's lyrics
provide some fresh comic insights
on the innately cliche subject of
young romance.
Unfortunately, the progress of
this promising comedy is periodi
cally interrupted by spates of
choreography, unmatchable for
their tedious obscurity. And while
much is made of a few of the
minor roles, too often they are
merely tepid caricatures.
Dean Goodman's direction fails
to unite the various elements of
the work, giving the impression
rather of a patchily successful
review than a continuous dra
matic production.
