An Explanation
I lOditor, the Daily:
Having been questioned via a
letter in Friday's Daily concerning
the statement attributed to me in
Thursday's Con Home article, an
I explanation follows posthaste.
The quote concerned the relative
j absence (19 of 24 to be exact > of
[ fraternity "on-campus" contribu
i tions.
I My original report to the Daily
contained a full summary of all
phases of the Drive. The remark
about lack of fraternity contribu
tions to the specific category of
| "on-campus" collections was made
| in passing and subsequent sen
| tences, unfortunately omitted by
i the Daily's final article, pointed
out precisely what was stated in
j Friday's letter: that increases
(noted in other drive categories
j offset the on-campus drop. There
iis no doubt that many living
I groups used their lump-sum con-
I tri buttons to boost King and
Queen candidates.
j My own breakfast was some
what spoiled Thursday morning
after reading the statement. Iso-
I lated as it was, without support
j from the omitted qualifying state
ments, it definitely created an un
! intended impression. No slight
was intended either by the Con
: Home committee or by ihe Daily,
I and apologies are made to the of
i fended.
I would, however, suggest that
!in the future all living groups
I contribute at least a token amount
specifically to the "on-campus"
; section of the Drive, so that the
i list of campus groups contribut
i ing, which is turned in to the di
â€¢ rectors of the Con Home, can
: definitely show 100 per cent par
ticipation by the University.

Right or Wrong
I Kriitor, (In* Daily:
Good gracious. I was horrified
by the most liberal view thai you
: have been taking on the current
] Communist riots in San Fran-
I cisco. What do you think this is?
I We can't have all of those nasty
Communists running around. The
Un-American Activities Commit
tee was set up by the House of
i Representatives of the United
; States of America. Coshes, should
we harbor any doubts about the
ability and brilliance of these
I wonderful and intelligent repre
sentatives of tlie people, and
, about the loyalty of such a truly
i American organization as our
Congress? And if this committee
I has been approved by the DAR,
i how can we possibly doubt its
! righteous and pat r i o t i c inten
' tions? a
! We must use any method of
intimidation and inquisition at
jour disposal to eliminate all of
these dreaded "Commies," to
j quote a phrase from two staunch
| defenders of Americanism, the
I late Sen. J. McCarthy and that
Honorable Mr. Richard Arens.
I We must remember, "My country
... my country, right or wrong."
If it becomes necessary to hold
these sessions in private, goshes,
by all means let us do so. We
must continue to uphold those
rights that seem "self-evident,"
and so obviously are, and we must
continue to Trust in God and the
House Committee on Un-Ameri
can Activities.
