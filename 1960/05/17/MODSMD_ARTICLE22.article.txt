A I iiii k Performance
Although most of Stanford's gridders and fans are perfectly will
ing to forget all about the pigskin till next fall after last Saturday's
fine exhibition in the Stadium, Coach Jack Curtice and most of his
crew are spending the week in I..A. recruiting and talking to alums.
Yes. the varsity football team is all through with practice until
the first of September but they certainly treated alum and student
fans to a great game against the talented Alumni team in their last
outing.
Even though the Alumni won 29-2H the ."5,000 spectators and
Alumni gridders alike all admitted that this year's Varsity-Alumni
contest was the toughest and best yet, and that Stanford's football
fortunes might actually be realized in that "wait until next year"
proverb.
While most of the grid staff was away, former Card gridder and
assistant coach Jack McKenna was around and presented the coaches'
views of the weekend contest. McKcnna reported that there were no
serious injuries save for Larry Laeey, alumni guard, who injured

his knee in the game for which
coaches Curtice and Frankie Al
bert were grateful.
The varsity had concentrated
their spring practice on defense
in the secondary especially key
ing for the likes of receivers Hill
Mc( oil, Chris Kuri'ord and Hen
Kohinson and McKcnna reported
that the coaching staff was very
pleased with the result. Consider
ing the always present Indian grid
problem of lack of speed in the
backfield or anywhere, the fine
defensive performances of frosh
Tim Hansel who may break into
the starting lineup in the defen
sive backfield next year and
ends liicli llearney, George lion
ore and diet Hinsliaw made an
excellent showing on their defen
sive assignments even though
with the exception of Honore
none had seen much varsity ac
t ion.
Although last year's game
pitted Norman with more experi
enced receivers against the Alum-

ni, most of the "old men" believed that Curtice has a tougher team
this year. The depth will be better next season in the line and back
field and the boys were just tackling their older opponents better
last Saturday.
McKenna commented that the Indians have never been stronger
at center with veterans Doug* Pursell, Chris Cottle and Jack Gordon.
The guard position has six men who could fill the starting duo's
shoes they include: Ron Fernandas, Don Peter, Tom Walsh, Errol
Scott, Steve Player a froshâ€”and John Butler.
However as we move away from the center of the line the coaches
are worried about experience. At tackles, the two goliaths Dean
Hinshaw and Phil Toorvahl are taking charge but the team will have
to count on fine performances from freshmen C. B. Simons, Chuck
Ifartwig and Chuck Buehler to make the picture rosy. The coaches
were pleased with the performances of Hearney who streaked away
from all defenders for a touchdown after grabbing Dick Norman's
pass; Steve Pursell, Honor** and Dean's cousin diet; but will have
to wait and see how the ends hold up against hostile competition
next year.
Dowel's l>est Day?
Of course the backs are all returning and McKenna reported that
Norman should be joined by Skip Face, Mac YVylie, Gil Dowd or
John Bessey in the Card backfield. The best backfield performance
in the game according to the coaches was the fine running, blocking
and tackling of Dowd. Gil ran at his best in the tilt and may force
Wylie out to a wing spot with Dowd playing in the running spot with
Face. This year (iil played behind Wylie at right half but the coaches
believe he may be a starter if he can keep the injury jinx away.
Next year the coaches will once again look for some speedy back
or end possibly Danny Spence, Tom Featherston or Bessey will fit
the bill and hope that the defense can pull down the opposing back
field with a little more regularity than has been the case of late.
If their dreams are answered, Norman and company may compile a
winning season for Cactus Jack.
A special tip of the hat for one of the best- and least publicized
sports feats of the year. Marv "Bucky" Mecklenberg's double win
over Santa Clara last Saturday definitely proves to be the 1 best college
pitching effort of the year. He gave up nine hits and one run in
liis sixteen inning stint on the hill and never was the left-hander's
control as good. The lefty really has his curve dropping as Bronco
hitters will all admit.
