# STANFORD HITS AND LOSES
## SF State Drops Indians Daily Sports 
### John Osmundson 
II was open war on horsehide
yesterday as the Stanford base
ball team met San Francisco
State. Stanford's hitters had an
enjoyable afternoon, launching 15

hits within the extravagant con
fines of their sunken diamond and j
batting .417 as a team.
The Indians' power hitters also
did well, crashing three doubles.
Local baserunnors contributed by
pi 1 112 e r in g half a do/en bases;
fancy field work accounted for
two Stanford double plays.
However, San Francisco State j
had a slight edge in runs, 10-7.
In other words, Stanford lost. ,
One Hun Up
The game started mildly and,
happily enough with the Cards J
one run up at the end of the I
first frame. But that was the }
end of the farm domination. San
Francisco bounced back like a J
handball off the front wall as!
they scored five tallies in the
second inning, two in the fourth, j
a single run in the sixth and two
more in the ninth.
Stanford added to their own
total, but followed their guests 1
at a polite distance. The Indians
scored one in the third and five j
more times in the fourth through
sixth innings.

Terry Lindeman opened on the
hill for the Cards and he gave
up five runs before being lifted

in tlie second inning. Three Stan
ford errors accounted for two. un
earned runs in the visitors' 10-
run total.
Iliirlbut Hits
John Hurlbut led the locals in
a busy afternoon at the plate
with three hits, including a
double, in four trips while Hal
Sehutzmann got three for five.
Gehre of San Francisco topped
all hitters with a perfect four
for four mark.
Today Coach Dutch Feh ring's
crew hosts San Diego Marines
Recruit Depot in a 3:15 sunken

! diamond encounter. The fray will
be (he third of the season between
the two antagonists and it will
Ibe the crucial one Stanford heal
; ing the Marines and then losing
during a southern road trip early
I in the season.
