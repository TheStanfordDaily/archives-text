# Big 4 Talk Near Collapse As Ike, Khrushchev Clash
## Congressmen Charge 'k' Blew Up Summit Parley 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) â€”Congressmen said yesterday Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev coldbloodedly blew up the summit conference
because he really didn't want to negotiate and because he wanted
an excuse to keep President Eisenhower from visiting the Soviet
Union.
On all sides, Republican and Democratic senators and House mem-

bers deplored what they said was
Khrushchev's insulting treatment
of Eisenhower.
Many said they had had little
advance hope the summit talks
would lead to much good, and also
that Khrushchev's bull-in-the-chi
na-shop actions, as they described
them, confirmed their misgivings.
There was at least one bit of
speculation that Khrushchev act
ed as he did because of internal
difficulties in the Soviet Union.
Sen. Theodore Francis Green
(D-RI), chairman emeritus of the
Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee. said Khrushchev "has cruelly
dashed the hopes of hundreds of
millions that at least some slight
progress toward a relaxation of
international tensions could be
made."
Senate Democratic Leader Lyn
don B. Johnson of Texas said
Khrushchev's ballooning of the
spy plane incident "was clearly an
indication that he planned to
make either a shambles or a for
um for Soviet propaganda."
Senate Republican Leader Ev
erett M. Dirksen of Illinois told
the Senate it is clear that the
Kremlin leadership was alarmed
over the effect Eisenhower's
warm personality would have had
on the Russian people.
Son. Hugh Scott (R-Pa) said
the Soviet Premier "evidently had
stirred up considerable fear and
fright in his own country" over
the spy plane, Scott opined, and
| "has obviously decided the most
: damaging rebuttal to his postur
ings would be the presence in
Russia of President Eisenhower."
