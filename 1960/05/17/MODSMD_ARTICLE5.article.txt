"Anarchism is a logical out
growth of pa c i fi s m," Larry
Shumm, a Stanford undergradu
ate who has been sentenced to six j
months in prison for trespassing I
on an Omaha ICBM base, lold !
those attending the Socialist Cau-;
cus "Revolt of Conscience" series
last night.
"The true pacifist must in no !
way associate himself with the;
state," according to Shumm who :
pointed out that the state is mili- j
tant and therefore must be immo-!
ral. Non-participation should in- j
elude refusal to vote and pay
taxes since they are "an indirect
connection with the war ma
chine."
Shumm related pacificism to
Christianity. "Sacrificing and suf
fering cant' be separated from,
non-violence." he said.
Law Student Michael Freemand
based his argument for pacifism
on the commonly accepted beliefs
that there is nothing more valu
able than a human being.
