The Big Four summit meeting
which began in Paris yesterday
almost immediately readied an
impasse from which, as some ob
servers said, it would l>e "ex
tremely difficult" to continue.
As of late last night, the situa
tion was this:
• British Prime Minister Mac m i I -
lan and Rusian Premier Nikita
Khrushchev failed last night to
arrange for a further summit
meeting of the Big Four at a pri
vate meeting.
• French sources believe Presi
dent Charles de Gaulle does not
want the conference to continue
unless Khrushchev drops all talk
about the spy plane incident.
• Khrushchev refused to negoti
ate yesterday with President Ei
senhower unless the latter apolo
gized for the flight of the spy
plane, and concurrently withdrew
his invitation to Eisenhower to
visit Moscow scheduled for June
10.
• It was revealed that Eisenhower
ordered a halt to intelligence
flights over the Soviet Union last
Thursday, although the order was
not made public until the start of
the summit conference.
• According to an American offi
cial, Eisenhower's private reaction
to Khrushchev's tactics at the con
ference showed him "absolutely
furious" at what he regards an
insulting stand taken by the Rus
sian premier.
• Khrushchev put on one of his
most emotional displays yester
day, at one point waving his arms
above his head and declaring "As
God is my witness, my hands are
clean and my soul is clear."
• A secret, world-wide alertness
test of U.S. armed forces was set
off shortly before the collapse of
the summit conference. The De
fense Department refused any di
rect comment oil whether develop
ments at the conference were
linked with the exercise.
• A Voice of America spokesman
said that the Soviet Union has
stepped up its jamming of Voice
short-wave broadcasts since Khru
shchev announced the downing of
an American spy plane.
