# 'INTERPLAY OF IDEAS'
## Scratch Sheet on Sale 
### Judy Sklar Associate Editor 
The Scratch Sheet in its first
appearance as a permanent publi- 1
cation provides students with a
guide to perhaps four courses of ,
unquestioned value and devotes,
the rest of its space to a"free
interplay of ideas" between stu
dents and faculty.
The Sheet is on sale today |
through Friday at Engineering
Corner at 20 cents a copy.
In the evaluation of 23 basic
courses, the issue has compiled
the thoughts of five to 13 stu
dents per class into constructive
(and probably very toned-down)
criticism and, in a few cases, ex
tremely high praise.
I'Vw (iood Courses
The "successful" course evalu
ations are the highlight of the
publication, since they restore

one's feelings that there may be
one or two courses worth taking
after all.
There are comments on bril-j
liant lectures, reading "so funda
mentally bound up with lectures
that il is imposisble to tell which!
supplements which" and finals
demanding a comprehensive, criti-i
cal evaluation of the course.
Real Unanimity
It would appear, however, that
the case for each course is always
clear-cut. There is only one eval
uation that conceives of the fact
that perhaps five to 13 students
might disagree in their feelings
about a course, and this unanimi
ty detracts somewhat from tho j
trust one might give the Scratch
Sheet as a lasting document.
It is very difficult to believe
that everyone agrees about what
ought to be done to improve a I

course and still more difficult to
acc op I a complete agreement
about its value as it is given
now.
The editorial, which is actually
an introduction, raises some ques
tions about the direction of edu
cation which, if one is not care
ful, could be answered in one or
two sentences. If the questions
fire given much thought, they
may prove to be penctrating; but
in their present form, they tempt
the reader t<> turn them aside
with very little effort.
Criticism a Stimulant
Nevertheless the criticism of
the courses stands as highly con
structive and, as far as one can
tell, quite accurate. The Scratch
Sheet, which is obviously a
thoughtful publication, may prove
to be an important stimulus to
thought on individual courses by
both students and faculty.

It is very difficult to believe
that everyone agrees about what
ought to be done to improve a I

course and still more difficult to
acc op I a complete agreement
about its value as it is given
now.
The editorial, which is actually
an introduction, raises some ques
tions about the direction of edu
cation which, if one is not care
ful, could be answered in one or
two sentences. If the questions
fire given much thought, they
may prove to be penctrating; but
in their present form, they tempt
the reader t<> turn them aside
with very little effort.
Criticism a Stimulant
Nevertheless the criticism of
the courses stands as highly con
structive and, as far as one can
tell, quite accurate. The Scratch
Sheet, which is obviously a
thoughtful publication, may prove
to be an important stimulus to
thought on individual courses by
both students and faculty.
The Scratch Sheet in its first
appearance as a permanent publi- 1
cation provides students with a
guide to perhaps four courses of ,
unquestioned value and devotes,
the rest of its space to a"free
interplay of ideas" between stu
dents and faculty.
The Sheet is on sale today |
through Friday at Engineering
Corner at 20 cents a copy.
In the evaluation of 23 basic
courses, the issue has compiled
the thoughts of five to 13 stu
dents per class into constructive
(and probably very toned-down)
criticism and, in a few cases, ex
tremely high praise.
I'Vw (iood Courses
The "successful" course evalu
ations are the highlight of the
publication, since they restore

one's feelings that there may be
one or two courses worth taking
after all.
There are comments on bril-j
liant lectures, reading "so funda
mentally bound up with lectures
that il is imposisble to tell which!
supplements which" and finals
demanding a comprehensive, criti-i
cal evaluation of the course.
Real Unanimity
It would appear, however, that
the case for each course is always
clear-cut. There is only one eval
uation that conceives of the fact
that perhaps five to 13 students
might disagree in their feelings
about a course, and this unanimi
ty detracts somewhat from tho j
trust one might give the Scratch
Sheet as a lasting document.
