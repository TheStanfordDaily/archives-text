# SUMMIT TALKS COLLAPSE
## Khrushchev Stands Firm; Western Allies Withdraw 
### 
PARIS (A 3 )- The summit conference ended last night with East and
West bit terly blaming each other for its failure.
To the last minute Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev insisted that
he could not meet with the West unless President Eisenhower apolo
gized for the U2 spy incident and promised to punish those respon
sible.
Eisenhower refused to go beyond a statement that such flights
over the Soviet Union ate ended. I

The Western leaders met twice I
during the day, waiting for Khru
shchev to appear. He refused to |
do so until, as he put it, the Unit- i
I ed States gave him satisfaction.!
j Last-ditch efforts by the British, I
j through a meeting between For-j
eign Ministers Andrei Gromyko j
I and Selwyn Lloyd, failed to break I
| the impasse.
Communique
Finally, at 10:30 p.m., the West- J
| ern powers issued this communi- j
que:
"The President of the United
I States, the President of the
; French Republic and the Prime j
Minister of the United Kingdom 1
lake note of the fact that because 1
of the attitude adopted by the j
Chairman of the Council of Min- !
| isters of the Soviet Union it has j
| not been possible to begin, at the
| summit conference, the examina
j tion of the problems which it had |
been agreed would be discussed I
! between the four chiefs of state
! or government.
"They regret that these discus
i sions, so important for world
i peace, could not take place. For
| their part, they remain unshaken
1 in their conviction that all out
j standing international questions
| should be settled not by the use
! or threat of force but by peaceful i
■means through negotiation. They;
themselves remain ready to take'
part in such negotiations at any |
suitable time in the future."
Geneva Talks
White House Press Secretary j
James C. Hagerty was asked I
whether the breakup of the sum
mit would affect Soviet-Western
talks on disarmament at Geneva.
"So far as I know," Hagerty re
plied, "those conferences are in
session—or will be in session, 1
rather. The United States will
continue to attend."
A spokesman for the British
said the Russians still expressed
interest in a summit six or eight
months hence. There will be a '
new administration in Washing
ton next Jan. 20.
When the summit session con
vened Monday for its fruitless
i three-hour preliminary meet ing,
i Khrushchev withdrew his invita
' tion to Eisenhower to visit Soviet
1 Russia in June. American spokes
| men yesterday pictured Eisenhow
er's attitude as one of complete
j disgust with the Soviet leader's,
j attitude.
Khrushchev Still Firm
i Khrushchev declined to budge j
j from the stand he took Monday
i morning when he blew up the
summit meeting by refusing to'
| talk to Eisenhower without an
American apology for the spy [
' plane.
Western diplomats regarded as
an open snub Khrushchev's deci-1
sion to spend most of the day ]
traveling about the countryside j
j while the Western leaders were
• trying to save the summit.
Khrushchev scattered off-the-1
cuff remarks throughout his out-1
ing, even at one time using a
group of peasants in a cowbarn
as an audience to repeat his de- 1
; mands for American self-abase-'
ment.
Efforts to revive the conference
rested largely with De Gaulle and
, Macmillan. De Gaulle sent tol
Khrushchev, Eisenhower and
Macmillan letters expressing hope j
| for reconciliation; only Khrutsh-1
chev did not answer.
Soviet Conference
The Soviet delegation announc-)
ed that Khrushchev will hold aj
news conference Wednesday after j
his farewell call on De Gaulle.
Khrushchev's account of yester-!
day's maneuvering, as told in the j
I Soviet delegation's final state
ment, was that the Western lead
ers called a meeting while he was
on a trip outside Paris.
Khrushchev said the first he
knew of it was while he was at
l he village of Pleurs Sur Marnc j
talking with peasants.
The Russians said they then at-:
tempted to learn whether this was ]
a preliminary conference or an |
I attempt to convoke the summit I
"unilaterally." Khrushchev re-j
fused to attend anything but a
preliminary meeting.
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrush-1
chev spurned the summit confer
ence yesterday for a cow barn i
meeting with French peasants in j
the countryside. 1
