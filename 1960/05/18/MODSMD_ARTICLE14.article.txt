William Graham Colo, chair
man of the Department of Reli
gion and Dean of Freshmen at
Williams College, is the latest in
a long line of educators to try
to figure out a way to curb the
increasing cheating that is going
on at this nation's universities
and colleges.
Cole's remedy, however, is re
freshingly provocative since it
entails the revamping of our en
tire educational system. The ar
ticle, which appears in the May
14 issue of "The Nation," starts
out by stating that the answer
to the cheating problem is not
to moralize, that "little is gained
by rushing to the wailing wall."
Instead, Cole suggests that we
take an objective look at our edu
cational system. And what do we
find when we have taken this
objective look? We find that the
main reason for increased cheat
ing is the ridiculous importance
that is being placed on grades.
"Admission to college and uni
versity today requires, more than
ever before, a record liberally
sprinkled with A's and B's. The
graduate schools, becoming in-1
ereasingly selective, also place a i
high premium on the marks re
ceived in college," Cole relates.
"This means that as the stu- j
dent climbs the academic stair
way, he finds at each successive |
level a sign reading 'Reserved for j
those with good grades.' Thus, if |
he is not content to abandon his I
ascent, he must produce his pass-'
port," Cole continues.
But why must a student cheat?
Because, Cole says, it is easier
to cheat, and more importantly, j
"it is the final mark received in
the course, not what one has
learned, that is really important."
Cole also points out that every
institution has teachers who have
their pets, who favor students
who flatter them while penalizing
those who remain personally in-j
different and intellectually Inde- 1
pendent. "Lea rning, then, be-1
comes a game which must be
played with skill, gaining aptitude
in the arts of 'one upmanship,'"
Cole states.
Popular methods utilized to
combat cheating are quickly ana-1
lyzed by Cole. He finds all of j
those methods missing the real j
problem.
The honor system, such as the i

one employed at Stanford, fails
j to prove to the student that cheat-
I ing is morally wrong. The student
| refrains from cheating only be
; cause he sees no one else cheat-
I ing; not because he feels that
cheating is morally reprehensible.
Cole also looks at the proctor
i ing method and dismisses it as
simply a spying technique which
; underlines the intensifying rival
ry between student and teacher.
Cole's solution to the cheating
problem must go under that huge
classification known as "idealist
ic," but like so many other solu
tions which reside there, it is not
entirely impractical nor unattain
able.
"Somehow, some fundamental
re-examination must take place
so that students will realize that,
when they cheat, they are actu
ally harming no one more than
themselves," Cole suggests.
"The undergraduate who relies
on crib-notes instead of careful
preparation has cheated his par
ents, who have paid for his edu
cation; he has cheated himself,
for he has learned nothing," Cole
| says.
lie sums up his feelings by
stating that it is not the high
grade for which a student should
work, but rather for what a high
| grade represents; comprehension,
j imagination, skill, sympathy, dili-
I gence.
"More fundamental is the stu
dent's attitued toward education
| itself. American education, by and
. large, produces a maximum of
passivity; s t u d en t s do not so
; much learn anything as they are
taught something," Cole says.
"There is precious little corre
lation that is obvious to them
between what is going on in the
classroom and in the marketplace
where they intend to spend the
rest of their lives. We need far
j more independent study in our
j colleges and far more contact
with the workaday world than
! we now have.
"If students can l>e encouraged
i to pursue their own research out
of sheer curiosity, for the mere
joy of learning, and then be asked
to relate what they are doing to
the larger commonwealth of man
kind, in which they share citizen
ship, then cheating on the cam
pus will wither and die, because
the waters which now keep it
alive will have dried up."
