# SPY PLANE CRISIS
## U.S. in Shaky Position At Paris Summit Talks 
### Tom Clover 
From the United States point
of view, the world situation has
taken some unfortunate turns in
the last few days.
The U-2 humiliation, insulting
personal attacks on our President,
and the subsequent crisis at the
summit have been carefully
arranged to make our nation and
leaders appear to the world's im
pressionable neutral segment as
bungling, unsure and even aggres
sive. The reaction in Washington
and other committed western bloc
capitals to this propaganda offen
sive has been "righteous indigna
tion."
In our own country we .see all
factions uniting to defend against
attacks on our dignity and justify
ihe actions of the United States
by grabbing at suggested ration-,
alizations, be they oxygen failure
stories, "necessary for defense"
claims, or internal strife in the
Soviet Union rumors. After all
we are all loyal Americans and
believe our causes and ideals are
light.
In Russia the clouds are nol
so black. The Russian people at
last have proof of U.S. lying and
aggression, vivid examples of
American impudence toward then
nation and its leader, and good
reason for not trusting the West
in the future on any proposals.

Moscow's react ion has been
"righteous indignation." After all
they are loyal Russians and be
lieve in their causes and ideals.
Meanwhile, there are certain
impasse areas of tension, such
as Berlin, Formosa, spying, and
so on, in which neither side can
afford to recant its obligation,
yet maintenance of them means
global war. All that is necessary
is one pressure move, the signing
of an East German-Russian treaty
or the discovery of another U.S.
spy plane. Even though the na
tions involved may not want war,
their statements and obligations
require counteraction.
War has been avoided in the
recent past by fear of the conse
quences. There simply has not
been enough justification to over
come this fear. The quickest way
to obtain justification, however,
is to. build up "righteous indig
nation." This can justify any con
sequences.
War will not start now. We
are not yet indignant enough.
But how many more such inci
dents will it take before that
narrow line is reached? Unless we
stop seeking rationalizations for
any actions of the United States
merely because we believe in its
ideals and goals, and until we
begin to judge these actions on
their own value, it won't be long.

sive has been "righteous indigna
tion."
In our own country we .see all
factions uniting to defend against
attacks on our dignity and justify
ihe actions of the United States
by grabbing at suggested ration-,
alizations, be they oxygen failure
stories, "necessary for defense"
claims, or internal strife in the
Soviet Union rumors. After all
we are all loyal Americans and
believe our causes and ideals are
light.
In Russia the clouds are nol
so black. The Russian people at
last have proof of U.S. lying and
aggression, vivid examples of
American impudence toward then
nation and its leader, and good
reason for not trusting the West
in the future on any proposals.

Moscow's react ion has been
"righteous indignation." After all
they are loyal Russians and be
lieve in their causes and ideals.
Meanwhile, there are certain
impasse areas of tension, such
as Berlin, Formosa, spying, and
so on, in which neither side can
afford to recant its obligation,
yet maintenance of them means
global war. All that is necessary
is one pressure move, the signing
of an East German-Russian treaty
or the discovery of another U.S.
spy plane. Even though the na
tions involved may not want war,
their statements and obligations
require counteraction.
War has been avoided in the
recent past by fear of the conse
quences. There simply has not
been enough justification to over
come this fear. The quickest way
to obtain justification, however,
is to. build up "righteous indig
nation." This can justify any con
sequences.
War will not start now. We
are not yet indignant enough.
But how many more such inci
dents will it take before that
narrow line is reached? Unless we
stop seeking rationalizations for
any actions of the United States
merely because we believe in its
ideals and goals, and until we
begin to judge these actions on
their own value, it won't be long.
From the United States point
of view, the world situation has
taken some unfortunate turns in
the last few days.
The U-2 humiliation, insulting
personal attacks on our President,
and the subsequent crisis at the
summit have been carefully
arranged to make our nation and
leaders appear to the world's im
pressionable neutral segment as
bungling, unsure and even aggres
sive. The reaction in Washington
and other committed western bloc
capitals to this propaganda offen
sive has been "righteous indigna
tion."
