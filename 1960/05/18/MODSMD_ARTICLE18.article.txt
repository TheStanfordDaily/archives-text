Uphold the Peace
Editor, the Daily:
i The Daily's treatment of the
; riot was disgusting. Granted the
Committee may suppress civil
; rights, but the police (black
j shirts) are sworn to uphold the
I peace, and that is the job they
must do, whether they like it or
i not.
The precipitating cause of the
riot seems to have been when
the crowd .demanded seats in the
filled committee room, and since
i they didn't have their request
1 filled, they decided to take col
lective action. The Constitution
guarantees peaceful assembly.
And our illustrious Don Qui
j xote who tried to save a female
in distress overlooked or was ig
| norant of the fact that one of the
j officers had a bite on his hand.
! One can assume, with some de
bate, that that is a female tactic.
And those females inclined to use
' such tactics are not ladies and
, in a mob, will probably get treat -
! ed accordingly.
I'll grant that the police used,
perhaps too, much force. Whether
■ we like it or not, we < now or will
| soon) pay them to do a job.
j The only people who could pos
i sibly have had any gripe con
cerning the lack of seats were
1 those who had the foresight to
{ write their Congressmen request
l ing passes and who were denied
because they might riot inside the
committee room.
Michael Panero
Editor's Note: The Daily will
present later this week a detailed
account of the cause of the riots
based on interviews wit li eyewit
nesses, which may help to clear
up some of the misinterpretations
which have arisen.

Editor, the Daily:
We wish to express our con
gratulations and gratitude to the
Daily for their courageous expo
sure of the true purposes of the
House Un-American Act ivities
Committee in Monday's sterling
edition of the Stanford Daily.
We were shocked and horrified
to learn that the Democratic
| Party is to be the target of a
cleverly planned smear campaign.

We are nearly ready 1o call mass
meetings, to sot up picket lines,
etc., in indignant protest. How
ever, one small point remains ob
scure and we beg illumination.
Why is a committee, headed by
a Democrat, having a majority
of Democrats on it and belonging
to a Democratic Congress, em
barking upon a campaign of vili
cation (sic> against the Demo
cratic Party?

I have just finished Mr. Green
i berg's profoundly moving article
I covering the events of Friday,
May 13. It is a black Friday in
! deed when officers of the law
1 ("blackshirts" ) actually defend
themselves from quiet, orderly
intellectuals. Why didn't that
; nasty old "black shirt" turn the
| other cheek to the quiet, orderly
| intellectual who (quietly, orderly
and intellectually?) "crunched"
I him? At least the officer ("black
shirt") should have allowed the
j quiet, orderly intellectual to keep
his "black-shirted cop's night
| stick" for a souvenir.
