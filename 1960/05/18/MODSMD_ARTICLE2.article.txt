## 'Employment To Be U.S.'s Big Worry' 
### daryl Glenney 
America's greatest economic
problem in the decade ahead will
be that of employment. Erwin D.
Canham. editor of the Christian
Science Monitor, said in a Tuesday
Evening Series lecture last night.
"We will need to create some
thing like 25.000 brand new jobs
every week just to take care of
the flow of youthful workers,"
said Canham.
He predicted that the number
of producers in relation to the to
tal population will grow, whereas
now growth is concentrated in
the number of consumers.
Tax Incentives
"Capital is the indispensable ele
ment in the creation of jobs." Can
ham said. Much of the needed
capital for industry could come
through "reasonable tax incen
tives," he added; just to tax the
private sector of the economy to
support public projects would hin
der economy's most generative
forces.
Canham mentioned the current
debate among economists between
advocates of accumulation of pri
vate capital and accumulation of
public capital. This may become
a campaign issue, he said, since
the Democratic party is in favor
of public capital. However, a cam
paign advocating high taxes
would not be very appealing.
Balance of Power
"If we are to have stable
growth in our economy, we must
have a better balance of economic
power," said Canham. He cited
government control, the power of
organized labor, and changes in
our concept of ownership as cur
rent factors affecting this balance.
Canham expressed concern for
the spread of the American eco
nomic system to the rest of the
world. "Venality and corruption
have poisoned many of the ele
ments of private business which
have sprung up or been revived in
many crucial parts of the world,"
he said. "We must define the lot
of man: we must give priority to
values."
