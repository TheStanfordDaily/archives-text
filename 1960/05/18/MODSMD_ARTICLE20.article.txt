Papers fall due, finals draw
near . . . the winds blow . . . ever
more.
Bui possibilities of relief . . . for
the tired, the tense, the nervous
are herein offered.
Hal Holbrook's back at the
Geary Theatre with his "Mark
Twain Tonight" as of next Mon
day night when he opens a two
week engagement.
The great mop of white hair,
the queer shuffling gait, the
drawling infirmity of speech, the
flamboyant white suit of the 70-
year-old Twain, Holhrook dupli
cates precisely. With nothing on
stage, hut an old oriental rug, an
elaborate wood table and chair
Twain, the works and the actions
and a podium, Holhrook recreates
of America's Court Jester.
He does not read his selections.
He wanders rather in a seemingly
aimless fashion throughout his
material, using the pause with
powerful effect. He acts out
scenes from Twain's books, from
Huckleberry Finn, from Roughing
It. He tells a devastating ghost
story and "just talks" other sclec
tal way of Twain which is both
tions in the spontaneous, anecdo
unconventional and delightful.
Tickets ranging from $1.55 to
$4.85 are available at ihc Geary
Box Office.
Then this Saturday at the Ber
keley Community Theatre and
Monday at the San Jose Civic Au
ditorium. it's Victor Borge with

edy in Music, arriving here after

for the two and one-half hour
show, partly because of the audi
ence participation and Borge's
asking for requests. And music
from Bach to Bop, from Chop
Sticks to Chopin is likely to be
heard.

Resignedly, the program for
Comedy in Music reads, "Frankly,
we don't know what Mr. Korgc
will do hut we're sure he'll keep
lis posted from time to time.
There is also an intermission but
only Mr. Borge knows when."

The great mop of white hair,
the queer shuffling gait, the
drawling infirmity of speech, the
flamboyant white suit of the 70-
year-old Twain, Holhrook dupli
cates precisely. With nothing on
stage, hut an old oriental rug, an
elaborate wood table and chair
Twain, the works and the actions
and a podium, Holhrook recreates
of America's Court Jester.
He does not read his selections.
He wanders rather in a seemingly
aimless fashion throughout his
material, using the pause with
powerful effect. He acts out
scenes from Twain's books, from
Huckleberry Finn, from Roughing
It. He tells a devastating ghost
story and "just talks" other sclec
tal way of Twain which is both
tions in the spontaneous, anecdo
unconventional and delightful.
Tickets ranging from $1.55 to
$4.85 are available at ihc Geary
Box Office.

keley Community Theatre and
Monday at the San Jose Civic Au
ditorium. it's Victor Borge with

edy in Music, arriving here after
reco r d breaking performances
throughout the country.
The humor- is never the same
for the two and one-half hour
show, partly because of the audi
ence participation and Borge's
asking for requests. And music
from Bach to Bop, from Chop
Sticks to Chopin is likely to be
heard.

Resignedly, the program for
Comedy in Music reads, "Frankly,
we don't know what Mr. Korgc
will do hut we're sure he'll keep
lis posted from time to time.
There is also an intermission but
only Mr. Borge knows when."
