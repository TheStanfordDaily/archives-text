Los Angeles State, we understand, is entertaining an ambitious
desire to land Payton Jordan as its head track coach. These inten
tions haven't been too often publicly stated; Jordan himself isn't
too aware of them. But that's the word.
It would be a temptation for Jordan, understandably. He has
developed Stanford track to its all-time best and now is faced with
the graduation of most of the top point-producers of the past several
seasons. The ranks will still be tough next year, but terribly thin.
Now L.A. State beckons. L.A. State, never great shakes in track
before, would have one obvious aim in seeking a coach like Jordan:
to become great shakes.
II was Jordan who picked up Occidental College from a tromped
on, obscure small college team to become one of the nation's great
track powers. It is a perch from which Oxy has yet to fall. Yet
Occidental is still strictly small-time in all other sports.
Obviously we do not recommend that Payton Jordan move, and
don't think that he will. Success at L.A. Stale, which most everyone
would admit as certain, would be another feather in Jordan's cap.
But Payton would be the first to say that better years are ahead for
Stanford. ,
But the rub . . . the big question ... is this: How much better
can Stanford get? With an undergraduate enrollment already small
er than that of nearly every opponent, and the percentage of athletes
in that enrollment smaller yet what is the future?
This year more than 6.500 high school seniors applied for admis
sion to Stanford. Less than 1,300 can lie accepted. That means that
nearly 5,500 outstanding high school students engineers, scientists
and lawyers as well as athletes were turned down. It will get
worse every year.
A Great Team Looks Weak
Under Payton Jordan, Stanford track has risen to its greatest
level. Stanford has met what is unquestionably the toughest schedule
in the nation: San Jose Stale, Kansas, Oregon, Southern California,
UCLA, Occidental, California and the Santa Clara Youth Village. We
didn't beat a one of them. (But who would have?) This was Stan
ford's finest track team, maybe not relatively speaking, but certainly
performance-speaking, and it won one dual meet Fresno Suite.
Progress is leaving us behind, you might say. Collegiate athletics
are getting tougher and tougher. Stanford's teams are getting strong
as well. But Stanford's entrance requirements are getting tougher
and tougher, too. Right now, we're losing.
Stanford can't afford to let any interested, academically qualified
athlete "get away." Unfortunately, it will never work that way.
Some "almost" make it (Dallas Long); some apply too late (Jerry
Siebert); some can't make it (Dixon Farmer).
Last fall, somebody panicked and said we'd never have another
winning football team. They had a point, though. We've had only
two gridiron winners since 1953.
The record shows it: Stanford just isn't getting the athletes, in
quantity mainly, but, we're sorry to say, in quality too. Not enough
qualify for admission; not enough of those who do, show up.
And we can't blame the high school stars for being snowed by
the glitter of Figueroa Avenue. Or the free rides of the Northwest.
There is little to do but battle the odds with what equipment we
have which is one of the nation's finest coaching staffs.
The Start of a Winning Attitude
One of Payton Jordan's greatest contributions to Stanford ath
letics has been one rather intangible. Jordan has done much to
create a true team spirit in track, an individual sport. A team spirit
of confidence, desire to win, and sincere pride in the individual accom
plishment of a teammate.
The environment for athletics here is such that Stanford people
almost seem disposed to apologize for the fact that we, the mighty
stronghold of private education in the West, still stoop to participate
in big time intercollegiate athletics. Such an atmosphere is not the
sort that would attract the impressionable young high school ath
letes. Not enough of them can separate immediate glitter from a
more long-range goal.
Perhaps the manifestation of an enthusiastic "Stanford Spirit,"
obvious in all teams, could became a great selling point. Of late,
Stanford Spirit has waned.
Stanford will stay big time. To date, good coaches, great sched
ules and a beautiful layout apparently haven't been attraction
enough. Possibly Stanford Spirit could be.
The attitudes are picking up. . . . Good years in basketball appear
very near; tennis, too. and maybe football. As for track, it would
be tough to lose right now a coach like Payton Jordan. If L.A. State
wants him. they're not so dumb. We hope they lose.

developed Stanford track to its all-time best and now is faced with
the graduation of most of the top point-producers of the past several
seasons. The ranks will still be tough next year, but terribly thin.
Now L.A. State beckons. L.A. State, never great shakes in track
before, would have one obvious aim in seeking a coach like Jordan:
to become great shakes.
II was Jordan who picked up Occidental College from a tromped
on, obscure small college team to become one of the nation's great
track powers. It is a perch from which Oxy has yet to fall. Yet
Occidental is still strictly small-time in all other sports.
Obviously we do not recommend that Payton Jordan move, and
don't think that he will. Success at L.A. Stale, which most everyone
would admit as certain, would be another feather in Jordan's cap.
But Payton would be the first to say that better years are ahead for
Stanford. ,
But the rub . . . the big question ... is this: How much better
can Stanford get? With an undergraduate enrollment already small
er than that of nearly every opponent, and the percentage of athletes
in that enrollment smaller yet what is the future?
This year more than 6.500 high school seniors applied for admis
sion to Stanford. Less than 1,300 can lie accepted. That means that
nearly 5,500 outstanding high school students engineers, scientists
and lawyers as well as athletes were turned down. It will get
worse every year.
A Great Team Looks Weak
Under Payton Jordan, Stanford track has risen to its greatest
level. Stanford has met what is unquestionably the toughest schedule
in the nation: San Jose Stale, Kansas, Oregon, Southern California,
UCLA, Occidental, California and the Santa Clara Youth Village. We
didn't beat a one of them. (But who would have?) This was Stan
ford's finest track team, maybe not relatively speaking, but certainly
performance-speaking, and it won one dual meet Fresno Suite.
Progress is leaving us behind, you might say. Collegiate athletics
are getting tougher and tougher. Stanford's teams are getting strong
as well. But Stanford's entrance requirements are getting tougher
and tougher, too. Right now, we're losing.
Stanford can't afford to let any interested, academically qualified
athlete "get away." Unfortunately, it will never work that way.
Some "almost" make it (Dallas Long); some apply too late (Jerry
Siebert); some can't make it (Dixon Farmer).
Last fall, somebody panicked and said we'd never have another
winning football team. They had a point, though. We've had only
two gridiron winners since 1953.
The record shows it: Stanford just isn't getting the athletes, in
quantity mainly, but, we're sorry to say, in quality too. Not enough
qualify for admission; not enough of those who do, show up.
And we can't blame the high school stars for being snowed by
the glitter of Figueroa Avenue. Or the free rides of the Northwest.
There is little to do but battle the odds with what equipment we
have which is one of the nation's finest coaching staffs.
The Start of a Winning Attitude
One of Payton Jordan's greatest contributions to Stanford ath
letics has been one rather intangible. Jordan has done much to
create a true team spirit in track, an individual sport. A team spirit
of confidence, desire to win, and sincere pride in the individual accom
plishment of a teammate.
The environment for athletics here is such that Stanford people
almost seem disposed to apologize for the fact that we, the mighty
stronghold of private education in the West, still stoop to participate
in big time intercollegiate athletics. Such an atmosphere is not the
sort that would attract the impressionable young high school ath
letes. Not enough of them can separate immediate glitter from a
more long-range goal.
Perhaps the manifestation of an enthusiastic "Stanford Spirit,"
obvious in all teams, could became a great selling point. Of late,
Stanford Spirit has waned.
Stanford will stay big time. To date, good coaches, great sched
ules and a beautiful layout apparently haven't been attraction
enough. Possibly Stanford Spirit could be.
The attitudes are picking up. . . . Good years in basketball appear
very near; tennis, too. and maybe football. As for track, it would
be tough to lose right now a coach like Payton Jordan. If L.A. State
wants him. they're not so dumb. We hope they lose.
Los Angeles State, we understand, is entertaining an ambitious
desire to land Payton Jordan as its head track coach. These inten
tions haven't been too often publicly stated; Jordan himself isn't
too aware of them. But that's the word.

Now L.A. State beckons. L.A. State, never great shakes in track
before, would have one obvious aim in seeking a coach like Jordan:
to become great shakes.
II was Jordan who picked up Occidental College from a tromped
on, obscure small college team to become one of the nation's great
track powers. It is a perch from which Oxy has yet to fall. Yet
Occidental is still strictly small-time in all other sports.
Obviously we do not recommend that Payton Jordan move, and
don't think that he will. Success at L.A. Stale, which most everyone
would admit as certain, would be another feather in Jordan's cap.
But Payton would be the first to say that better years are ahead for
Stanford. ,
But the rub . . . the big question ... is this: How much better
can Stanford get? With an undergraduate enrollment already small
er than that of nearly every opponent, and the percentage of athletes
in that enrollment smaller yet what is the future?
This year more than 6.500 high school seniors applied for admis
sion to Stanford. Less than 1,300 can lie accepted. That means that
nearly 5,500 outstanding high school students engineers, scientists
and lawyers as well as athletes were turned down. It will get
worse every year.
A Great Team Looks Weak
Under Payton Jordan, Stanford track has risen to its greatest
level. Stanford has met what is unquestionably the toughest schedule
in the nation: San Jose Stale, Kansas, Oregon, Southern California,
UCLA, Occidental, California and the Santa Clara Youth Village. We
didn't beat a one of them. (But who would have?) This was Stan
ford's finest track team, maybe not relatively speaking, but certainly
performance-speaking, and it won one dual meet Fresno Suite.
Progress is leaving us behind, you might say. Collegiate athletics
are getting tougher and tougher. Stanford's teams are getting strong
as well. But Stanford's entrance requirements are getting tougher
and tougher, too. Right now, we're losing.
Stanford can't afford to let any interested, academically qualified
athlete "get away." Unfortunately, it will never work that way.
Some "almost" make it (Dallas Long); some apply too late (Jerry
Siebert); some can't make it (Dixon Farmer).
Last fall, somebody panicked and said we'd never have another
winning football team. They had a point, though. We've had only
two gridiron winners since 1953.
The record shows it: Stanford just isn't getting the athletes, in
quantity mainly, but, we're sorry to say, in quality too. Not enough
qualify for admission; not enough of those who do, show up.
And we can't blame the high school stars for being snowed by
the glitter of Figueroa Avenue. Or the free rides of the Northwest.
There is little to do but battle the odds with what equipment we
have which is one of the nation's finest coaching staffs.
The Start of a Winning Attitude
One of Payton Jordan's greatest contributions to Stanford ath
letics has been one rather intangible. Jordan has done much to
create a true team spirit in track, an individual sport. A team spirit
of confidence, desire to win, and sincere pride in the individual accom
plishment of a teammate.
The environment for athletics here is such that Stanford people
almost seem disposed to apologize for the fact that we, the mighty
stronghold of private education in the West, still stoop to participate
in big time intercollegiate athletics. Such an atmosphere is not the
sort that would attract the impressionable young high school ath
letes. Not enough of them can separate immediate glitter from a
more long-range goal.
Perhaps the manifestation of an enthusiastic "Stanford Spirit,"
obvious in all teams, could became a great selling point. Of late,
Stanford Spirit has waned.
Stanford will stay big time. To date, good coaches, great sched
ules and a beautiful layout apparently haven't been attraction
enough. Possibly Stanford Spirit could be.
The attitudes are picking up. . . . Good years in basketball appear
very near; tennis, too. and maybe football. As for track, it would
be tough to lose right now a coach like Payton Jordan. If L.A. State
wants him. they're not so dumb. We hope they lose.
Los Angeles State, we understand, is entertaining an ambitious
desire to land Payton Jordan as its head track coach. These inten
tions haven't been too often publicly stated; Jordan himself isn't
too aware of them. But that's the word.
It would be a temptation for Jordan, understandably. He has
developed Stanford track to its all-time best and now is faced with
the graduation of most of the top point-producers of the past several
seasons. The ranks will still be tough next year, but terribly thin.
