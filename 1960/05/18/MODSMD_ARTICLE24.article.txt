# S.F., Dodgers Power to Wins
## 
### 
CINCINNATI f/P) --The slug
ging San Francisco Giants nudged
higher into the National League
lead last night with a 9-2 trounc
ing of Cincinnati's Reds, high
lighted by three Giant home runs.
The Reds, who cuffed Giant
pitching freely in a Cincinnati
victory Monday night, were held
nearly powerless by righthander
Jack Sanford. He allowed only
six hits and struck out four.
MILWAUKEE (/P)--Big Frank
Howard, recalled from the minors
last Friday, cracked a bases-load
ed homer in the eighth inning last
night to boost the Los Angeles
Dodgers to a 6-4 victory over the
Milwaukee Braves.
Handcuffed on six hits and one
run for seven innings, the Dodg
ers caught up with Milwaukee's
Bob Buhl in the eighth with the
help of an error.
