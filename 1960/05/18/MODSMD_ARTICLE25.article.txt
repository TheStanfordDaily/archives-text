Burk's drive came after Hal
Schutzmann reached first on a
fielder's choice and Rich Ferraz
zano had walked. (). J. Solander

r then singled to right, scoring one
before Burk cleared the bases

for three hits, and hit a batter,

; four runs. Smith finally ended
the inning by getting Joe Meckel
to ground into a fielder's choice.

ing effortlessly, struck out nine,
j but was hurt by eight walks. The
