## 
### 
BALTIMORE </P> — Sen. John
F. Kennedy (D-Mass.) last night
scored an easy, impressive victory
in the Maryland presidential pri
mary.
Kennedy jumped to a quick lead
over Sen. Wayne Morse (D-Ore.)

and almost every precinct thai j
reported gave him another boost, j
With 802 of 1,3.16 polling places
reported, Kennedy had 94,454 and
Morse 23,233.
Voters could have decided to
send an uninstructed delegation
to the National Democratic Con
vention. but this also fared poorly.
It drew 11,291.
In Montgomery County, which
has a Stevenson - for ■ president
club, the uninstructed delegation
made a fairly good showing. Yet ,
even here Kennedy was running
far ahead.
70% of Total Vote
Kennedy was collecting about
TO per cent of all the Democratic
votes cast.
No Republican competed in the j
presidential primaries here.
Although entirely expected, it ;
nonetheless was an important i
victory for Kennedy.
It gives him 24 votes in the!
convention, and in theory at least I
the delegates will stick with him 1
as long as he has a chance for I
the nomination. In practice, they I
sometimes desert after the first
ballot.
'i \ Convention Votes
'These 24 votes boost Kennedy's
unofficial total to 294'ij. He needs !
761 for the nomination.
The first precinct that reported
sent Kennedy flying away, 73 to
20 for Morse. This came only five
minules after the polls officially
closed.
From the start this lined up as
a tepid race, and the only ques
tion to be answered was: How
big will Kenendy's margin be?
Even the candidates in effec
conceded this was true. Both
checked out early, and hustled
out to Oregon and the important
primary there Friday.
