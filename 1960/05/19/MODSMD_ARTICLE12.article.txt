# An Election Year
## 
### 
In a week of uglv, genuinely depressing political developments
at the Summit arid in San Francisco's t.ilv llall. one local bit ol
political action is deserving of some optimism. We refer to the
manner in which the "National Dealt Stevenson lor President
petitions were given circulation on campus.
An amendment to the Stanford Founding (.rant stales tliat.
''The I niversilv must be forever maintained upon a strictly non
partisan and non-sectarian basis. We believe the only reasonable
interpretation of this statement is that the name of llic I Diversity
shall not be identified with partisan politics or sectarian commit
ments.
The Stevenson petitions in no wav mentioned Stanford I ni
versit\ as a sponsor and the\ provided a useful opportunity lor
individual citi/ens to express and exercise political preference.
Moreover, tliev stimulated Nixon supporters to make an appear
ance at F.ngineering Corner on fnesday.
To sa\ that knowledge can he put to practical use only olT
campus would be, in ellect, to prevent such use bv liarrassment.
It would be futile to attempt to separate the discussion ol ideas
Irom their direct utilization. Issues discussed in a classroom can
not be contained simplv bv closing the door: likewise, issues dis
cussed in our residences cannot be kept oil Quad.
The private university plays an important and critical role
in our nation. Uccause Stanford is an independent university, it
must continue to encourage and protect the individuals right to
think and to ad political!) as ;i responsible human being par
ticularly in an election year.
