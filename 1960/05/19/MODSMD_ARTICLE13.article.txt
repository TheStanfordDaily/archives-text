# Spontaneous Action
## 
### 
Ycslenhn morning al Engineering Lorner there was. in addi
tion to the Sle\enson petition, another manifestation of serious
student thought and action which was promptly quashed hy offi
cers of the ASSI . A group of students attempting to collect funds
for the legal defense of Stanford students arrested in the battle
of (1 i1 \ Hall were told to disperse because their acli\ities were
illegal.
The reason given for this action on the part of ASSI was
that the students had failed to get permission from Legislature
for their fund raising, and that the campus must he protected
from possible fraud.
No mention was made of the fund for the students arrested in
the South, which continued at Engineering Lorner for two weeks
before the Legislature decided to "approve.
The obvious reason for the illegal approach ol the students
was the lime element. In fund raising activities, a week or even
several days can mean the difference between success and failure.
By quick action at the I Diversity of California, Lai students have
alreadv raised more than $500 in a similar campaign for the legal
defense of the members of their student body who were arrested.
Another possible motivation for the illegal means employed
In students who raised monev for Stanford and southern students,
and a motivation which Legislature would do well to consider
before it meets tonight, is a more or less subconscious mistrust of
student government and its ability to grasp the importance ol
spontaneous student action on this campus.
