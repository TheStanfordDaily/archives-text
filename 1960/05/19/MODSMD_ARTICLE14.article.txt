## Collapse of the Summit 
### Dick White Contributing Editor 
The Summit Conference thai j
never officially started has now
ended. Five years of planning
and hope were almost completely
destroyed by the events of the'
last month. Western unity has
been restored hut at the cost of
the greatest East-West tension;
since ihe Hungarian Revolution..
The U-2 plane incident was the I
official precipitant of the crisis.
Khrushchev had trapped the
Uniled States in a very embarras
sing position. He had caught us
spying, although this is a per
missible activity in the game of
international politics. It is some
what worse for America to do
this since most people, Ameri
cans included, expected more of
this government than of the
others.
However this incident was not
too shattering' of our prestige.
The lie we were caught in was.
Khrushchev seized upon this op
portunity to act willi moral indig
nation and to advise the United
States on the operation of a gov-1
ernnient.
His speech as translated in our
newspapers was a mild one. He
was adamant, however, that this
government should publicly apol
ogi/e for the spy incident and
punish those people who directed
the flight. Mi'. Eisenhower, act-1
ing lor our country, refused.
Eisenhower has called off all'
spy flights over Russia after Â«'i
somewhat confusing period at
first. This would seem to indi-!
cate our good intentions for peace. |
Khrushchev has made no such
conciliatory moves toward the
West. Colonel Abel, a leading!
Russian espionage agent in this
country, is still serving his 30- 1
year term in prison having been
sentenced in 1958.
One important difference sepa-1
rates the United States and Rus
sia in the area of spying. Our
government has admitted its epi-1
sode of espionage and avowed its'

intention to stop. No such decla
ration has been forthcoming from
the Russian government.
The charges Khrushchev lev
eled at the United States in Paris
sound almost humorous in light
of an investigation of espionage.
The United States made a mis
take, perhaps even committed a
crime, in its flight over Russia,
but we have publicly rectified
this. Russia has never admitted
its mistakes.
It seems clear from the short
duration of the Summit that
Khrushchev is not ready for peace
or perhaps does not even want
it. This may be due to pressure
from the Army within Russia or
from China. Whatever the cause
of his helligeranee, it indicates
that the Cold War will get hotter
and that new incidents will spring
lip all over the world.
There are so many trouble spots
now. Each of these will probably
be reopened, and new ones will
appear. Khrushchev has gone to
East Germany. It is now believed
that a conference will be called
shortly to sign a separate peace
treaty with East Germany. Ten
sions will rise over Berlin.
The offshore islands of China
have been the center of world
attention at various periods. They
shall probably have that oppor
tunity again in the not far dis
tant future.
The United States has a very
difficult future already mapped.
We must continually strive to
lessen tensions but be prepared
for their continuation. We must
attempt to draw the Free World
together in a somewhat stronger
bond than now exists. We should
not depend on just military alli
ances but also extend our trade
sphere to include much more for
eign commerce.
The next five years will he
very difficult. Although not en
gaged in a shooting war, we must
be prepared to make great sacri
fices. The peace that we are en
gaged in is not a pleasant one,
but it is certainly preferable to
the war that could follow.
