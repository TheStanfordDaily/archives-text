Editor's Note: The following is i
an open letter t« Mayor George j
Christopher of San Francisco.
To the Hon. George Christopher:
Wo the undersigned members
of the faculty of Stanford Univer
sity, as individuals and without !
implying any official University
position, wish to record a strong
and sharp protest to the measures ;
which the San Francisco Police
Department took on Friday, May I
13th, to end the student demon
stration against the hearings of |
the House Un-American Activities
Committee. We examined with ;
care the accounts of the police
action given in the two leading I
city newspapers and several of us ;
have queried a number of eye wit
nesses. The evidence drives us to
conclude that the police acted with
unwarranted brutality and their
actions require an investigation by |
the authorities of the city. Our \
understanding of the evidence j
also leads us to declare that, con
trary to wifie misinterpretation in |
the press, the demonstration was!
for the most part a responsible
protest by mature college stir-:
dents against what they deeply
felt to be the Committee's intoler
able infringement on civil free- j
dom.
To support our case, we submit
the following summary of the
events which we believe to be fac-1
tually accurate.
J. A crowd of less than 200 stu- j
dents seeking admission to the j
hearings had been promised by ■
Sheriff Carberry Friday morning !
that seats for the 2:00 session
would bo available on a first-come j
first-served basis.
2. Shortly after 1:00 thp crowd
was informed that, except for a i
few places, only holders of tickets j
previously issued by the Commit-1
tee would be admitted. One of j
the students thereupon called on
the rest to register protest by sit
ting down in the hall and making
noise. Nearly everyone heeded his
request. j
3. Police Inspector McGuire has ;
since asserted that he told the
crowd to quiet down and move
back. Many students report that
they did not hear him.
4. At this poii,it, four or five stu
dents surged to the front of the
demonstration and pressed toward
the police line guarding the room.
One demonstrator may have as
saulted a policeman who promptly
arrested him. By far the greater
part of the crowd were still seat
ed and singing.
5. Following a lapse of several j
minutes, Inspector McGuire or
dered two fire hoses turned on
the crowd of sitting students. He
gave no effective warning of his

intention. About half the crowd
rose in protest, much of it for t lie
first time angry. A lew close to
the hoses tried to advance, but
the force of water drove them
back.
6. A few minutes later, the
hoses were stopped and a force
of about 20 policemen was com
manded to charge the crowd. In
the act of pushing the students
(few of whom resisted) down 5
steps to the upper landing of the
rotunda stairs, the police were ob
served by a large number of wit
nesses to have kicked and tram
pled students already knocked
down and to have held one student
immobile while one of their num
ber clubbed him in the head.
7. Having forced the crowd on
to the landing, the police let up
their charge. The students sat
down again and resumed their
singing. No student heard anyone
in authority at this time order
them to leave the building.
8. Five minutes later, for a sec
ond time without warning, the
hoses were suddenly turned on
the seated students. Those in
front rose and turned their backs
against the water to shield the
rest. Several witnesses have de
clared that none of the students
seated on the landing at this point
offered any active resistance.
9. Aided by the force of water,
ihe police renewed their charge.
Some shoved students down the
flight of slippery stairs while
others from below dragged them
one by one to the ground floor and
into the streets. One student,
shoved from the top, fell all the
way to the bottom of the stairs.
Others, dragged by their legs,
were battered against the steps as
they descended. Some students
had fallen to the ground and were
kicked in the face to force them
to rise. At no time did more than
a small number of the demonstra
tors offer more than passive re
sistance to the police.
Our view of the facts impels us
to request an investigation of the
manner in which the police han
dled the crisis. It is our conviction
that a well-trained professional
police force should be expected to
have exercised more temperate
and effective methods for control
ling a legitimate demonstration,
which took place during a sched
uled Committee recess and which
was triggered by the Committee's
own action in awarding tickets.
The police and the press, we are
convinced, have seriously rrnsrep

resented the nature of this demon- )
strut ion. The demonstration took
place because a largo number of
students held careful and inform
ed convictions of the injustice of
the Committee's work. The fail
ure of the police in assessing the
nature of the crowd and their bru
tality in dispersing them turned a
! reasonable demonstration into a
j riot.
