# Grow Up
## 
### 
Kditor, the Daily:
Both you a iul Ken Purcell
should grow up. You have a long
way 1o go before you can lay
claim to being mature individuals.
Mr. Editor, if the objectively bi
ased "reporting" of Friday's free
for-all in San Francisco is an ex
ample of the type of journalism J
you favor, then you had better
give thoughts to another line of;
endeavor as your life's work,
since no reputable paper would
employ you - unless it be one of
the Hearst papers you so "fear
lessly" impale upon your ever so
sweeping sword of purity.
The references to "black-shirt
ed" police were unwarranted and
uncalled for. The Nazi overtones
to that statement are a foul re- i
flection upon a fine and hard
working police force. Further, the
police did not drag those who
"couldn't walk"; they dragged
those who would not walk, and
did so only when necessary.
A look at the injury list shows
that the fray was far from one
•sided as you stated. Out of 12 in
juries reported, eight of those in
jured were policemen. It would
seem that the police showed ad
mirable restraint in not whomp
ing more of those who resisted.
The police were given orders
and did their duty as best they
could. They did not enjoy that
duty, either, as you so obviously
imply. The looks on their faces
as they went about it showed dis
gust rather than delight. And the
motorcycle policeman who said,
"What a hell of a way to make a i
living; I had to hit that kid,'' did
not seem to be leaping in joy.
Your slur on the San Francisco
Police Department for something j
that was not their responsibility
and which they did all in their
power to prevent is an example
of irresponsible journalism at its
worst. An apology is in order to
the Department but I doubt if you
are perceptive or mature enough
to see it.
Mi-. Purcell was a fool—gallant, i
but still a fool. And he deserves 1
whatever Judge Underwood gives
him. For you to make a martyr
out of him in the manner you
have, along with a few others, is
ridiculous. So a policeman was
dragging a girl about; that is no
reason for Master Purcell to race
up on his white charger and bowl ,
over a policeman in the process.
The policeman was doing his duty
and it was not the place of Master
Purcell to tell him how to do it.
He should shut up and take his
medicine like the mature indi
vidual he isn't.
I wish I could be as good as
you two think you are.
