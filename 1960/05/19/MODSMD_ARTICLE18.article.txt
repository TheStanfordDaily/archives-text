### Ron Rapoport 
During basketball season the state of Indiana goes out of its
collective mind. When the Hoosier liigh school hoop tournament is
underway the emotions that are in evidence seem just the other |
side of fanaticism.
Whole towns close down and follow their high schools' teamsi
to cheer them on wherever they go. Towns with schools and city;
halls which date back to the Civil War hasp brand new basketball
pavilions which seat spectators by the thousands. Kids play basket
ball before they are strong enough to throw the ball up to the basket :
and it is said that Indiana babies have been known to teeth on j
basketballs.
Some of the greatest basketball players in the history of the
game went to high school in Indiana. Oscar Robertson is a current
prime example.
However, the University of Indiana has not always shared in the
wealth of hoop talent produced in its own back yard. Indiana is
indeed a perennial hoop power in the Big Ten, but it is seldom way
above the rest of the conference and more than once in a while has
a bad year.
The best Indiana high school prospects don't always go to IU j
(Robertson exemplifies this, too) and that is a source of great an
guish to ;i large number of Hoosiers. However the university has
never hit a basketball slump which was prolonged enough for any
drastic action to be taken. Such is not the case with football.
The Football Teams Were Bad
The football teams at IU for as far back as memory will reach
have been, without exception, absolutely lousy. Many a Big Ten
team has picked up its only conference win during a season from the
Hoosiers. Also the grid competition in the Big Ten is fierce and this,
added to non-conference games with the likes of Notre Dume, have
made for seasons in which IU lost over half their games by upwards j
of 30 points.
That this set of events irked some Indiana alums is evident, bo- j
cause awhile ago some sharp recruiters got into action.' They got !
themselves a good, recruit-attracting coach in Phil Dickens, and went j
out to rebuild the football fortunes of Indiana.
As a result, things began to look up. In 1958 the Hoosiers won !
five games out of nine and last year they did equally well. But then
came the reason why.
Two weeks ago, the National Collegiate Athletic Association said 1
that Indiana has been recruiting illegally and gave out with the
penalties. The policy making council of the NCAA had some pretty
concrete charges. The council charged that one alumnus of the uni
versity, working with an assistant football coach, had offered a flat
payment of $800 and $30 to $75 a month to a high school player in
Virginia. Another player had been offered $100 as a bonus for com
ing to Indiana.
The penalties imposed by the NCAA were severe. No member
of an Indiana athletic team may compete in NCAA championship
competition for four years. No Indiana team may compete in any
post-season bowl games. No Indiana team may have any of its
games televised.
Should these penalties stick, and there is every reason to think
lhat they will, Indiana will be ruined athletically for years to come, i
Few serious trackmen or swimmers will come to a school in which
they can't compete in NCAA competition. Few good football players
will come to a school where they are barred from bowl games and
television and where the recruiting tactics have been shown to be
illegal.
A Dirly Deal?
J
The governor of Indiana and the president of the university, j
Herman Wells, feel that ihe university was given a dirty deal and
a pretty good case can be made for this point of view.
Recruiting tactics in the Big Ten are pretty generally rotten. So I
are those of more than a few other schools. It is fairly obvious that 1
the most serious of Indiana's sins was that of getting caught.
Hopefully, the tough policy that the NCAA has adopted for the :
rule-violators will be effective. No school's athletic program can ;
afford the kind of penalties that have recently been applied to
Auburn, North Carolina State and now to Indiana. Good athletes,!
practical individuals all, just are not going to go to schools where
their competitive life is restricted. It also seems like a pretty good
bet that many athletes are wary of going to schools where the break
ing of rules that the majority of other schools are following is an j
accepted practice.
The University of Indiana has been taught a tough lesson, but
it's the kind of lesson that usually is learned well.

A Dirly Deal?
J
The governor of Indiana and the president of the university, j
Herman Wells, feel that ihe university was given a dirty deal and
a pretty good case can be made for this point of view.
Recruiting tactics in the Big Ten are pretty generally rotten. So I
are those of more than a few other schools. It is fairly obvious that 1
the most serious of Indiana's sins was that of getting caught.
Hopefully, the tough policy that the NCAA has adopted for the :
rule-violators will be effective. No school's athletic program can ;
afford the kind of penalties that have recently been applied to
Auburn, North Carolina State and now to Indiana. Good athletes,!
practical individuals all, just are not going to go to schools where
their competitive life is restricted. It also seems like a pretty good
bet that many athletes are wary of going to schools where the break
ing of rules that the majority of other schools are following is an j
accepted practice.
The University of Indiana has been taught a tough lesson, but
it's the kind of lesson that usually is learned well.

During basketball season the state of Indiana goes out of its
collective mind. When the Hoosier liigh school hoop tournament is
underway the emotions that are in evidence seem just the other |
side of fanaticism.
Whole towns close down and follow their high schools' teamsi
to cheer them on wherever they go. Towns with schools and city;
halls which date back to the Civil War hasp brand new basketball
pavilions which seat spectators by the thousands. Kids play basket
ball before they are strong enough to throw the ball up to the basket :
and it is said that Indiana babies have been known to teeth on j
basketballs.
Some of the greatest basketball players in the history of the
game went to high school in Indiana. Oscar Robertson is a current
prime example.
However, the University of Indiana has not always shared in the
wealth of hoop talent produced in its own back yard. Indiana is
indeed a perennial hoop power in the Big Ten, but it is seldom way
above the rest of the conference and more than once in a while has
a bad year.
The best Indiana high school prospects don't always go to IU j
(Robertson exemplifies this, too) and that is a source of great an
guish to ;i large number of Hoosiers. However the university has
never hit a basketball slump which was prolonged enough for any
drastic action to be taken. Such is not the case with football.
The Football Teams Were Bad
The football teams at IU for as far back as memory will reach
have been, without exception, absolutely lousy. Many a Big Ten
team has picked up its only conference win during a season from the
Hoosiers. Also the grid competition in the Big Ten is fierce and this,
added to non-conference games with the likes of Notre Dume, have
made for seasons in which IU lost over half their games by upwards j
of 30 points.
That this set of events irked some Indiana alums is evident, bo- j
cause awhile ago some sharp recruiters got into action.' They got !
themselves a good, recruit-attracting coach in Phil Dickens, and went j
out to rebuild the football fortunes of Indiana.
As a result, things began to look up. In 1958 the Hoosiers won !
five games out of nine and last year they did equally well. But then
came the reason why.

pavilions which seat spectators by the thousands. Kids play basket
ball before they are strong enough to throw the ball up to the basket :
and it is said that Indiana babies have been known to teeth on j
basketballs.
Some of the greatest basketball players in the history of the
game went to high school in Indiana. Oscar Robertson is a current
prime example.
However, the University of Indiana has not always shared in the
wealth of hoop talent produced in its own back yard. Indiana is
indeed a perennial hoop power in the Big Ten, but it is seldom way
above the rest of the conference and more than once in a while has
a bad year.
The best Indiana high school prospects don't always go to IU j
(Robertson exemplifies this, too) and that is a source of great an
guish to ;i large number of Hoosiers. However the university has
never hit a basketball slump which was prolonged enough for any
drastic action to be taken. Such is not the case with football.
The Football Teams Were Bad
The football teams at IU for as far back as memory will reach
have been, without exception, absolutely lousy. Many a Big Ten
team has picked up its only conference win during a season from the
Hoosiers. Also the grid competition in the Big Ten is fierce and this,
added to non-conference games with the likes of Notre Dume, have
made for seasons in which IU lost over half their games by upwards j
of 30 points.
That this set of events irked some Indiana alums is evident, bo- j
cause awhile ago some sharp recruiters got into action.' They got !
themselves a good, recruit-attracting coach in Phil Dickens, and went j
out to rebuild the football fortunes of Indiana.
As a result, things began to look up. In 1958 the Hoosiers won !
five games out of nine and last year they did equally well. But then
came the reason why.
Two weeks ago, the National Collegiate Athletic Association said 1
that Indiana has been recruiting illegally and gave out with the
penalties. The policy making council of the NCAA had some pretty
concrete charges. The council charged that one alumnus of the uni
versity, working with an assistant football coach, had offered a flat
payment of $800 and $30 to $75 a month to a high school player in
Virginia. Another player had been offered $100 as a bonus for com
ing to Indiana.
The penalties imposed by the NCAA were severe. No member
of an Indiana athletic team may compete in NCAA championship
competition for four years. No Indiana team may compete in any
post-season bowl games. No Indiana team may have any of its
games televised.
Should these penalties stick, and there is every reason to think
lhat they will, Indiana will be ruined athletically for years to come, i
Few serious trackmen or swimmers will come to a school in which
they can't compete in NCAA competition. Few good football players
will come to a school where they are barred from bowl games and
television and where the recruiting tactics have been shown to be
illegal.
A Dirly Deal?
J
The governor of Indiana and the president of the university, j
Herman Wells, feel that ihe university was given a dirty deal and
a pretty good case can be made for this point of view.
Recruiting tactics in the Big Ten are pretty generally rotten. So I
are those of more than a few other schools. It is fairly obvious that 1
the most serious of Indiana's sins was that of getting caught.
Hopefully, the tough policy that the NCAA has adopted for the :
rule-violators will be effective. No school's athletic program can ;
afford the kind of penalties that have recently been applied to
Auburn, North Carolina State and now to Indiana. Good athletes,!
practical individuals all, just are not going to go to schools where
their competitive life is restricted. It also seems like a pretty good
bet that many athletes are wary of going to schools where the break
ing of rules that the majority of other schools are following is an j
accepted practice.
The University of Indiana has been taught a tough lesson, but
it's the kind of lesson that usually is learned well.
