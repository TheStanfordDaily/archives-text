# Lloyd's Cramp LA Peril

The verdict on a muscle cramp
'will tell the story of whether
i Stanford goes for merely a vic
tory, or for both a win and a
world record in the two-mile relay
Friday at the Coliseum Relays in
Los Angeles.
Norm Lloyd, who suffered the
cramp a few yards before the end
of his brilliant 1320 stint in the
West Coast Relays distance med
ley, is the question mark for to
morrow's action.
If Lloyd can make the trip, he'll
join Ernie Cunliffe, Dick Lassen
and Rich Klier in the run at the
University of California's 7:20.9
mark, also set at the Coliseum Re
lays.
To get the mark, the Cards have
to average 1:50.2 per man. This
boils down to 1:48 for Cunliffe,
1:19 for Lloyd. 1:51 for Klier, 1:52
for Lassen, and eight-tenths to
■scatter around. Such would be
strong performances for each
man, but not impossible or even
remote.
Stanford's mile relay team,

though invited to compele, is
probably out of the meet unless
Lloyd ean run. Without him, the i
Indians would probably trail even
the USC and Oeeidental frosh.
Shot-putter Jerry Winters and
broad-jumper and hop-step-jump
man John Kelly will round out
the Stanford entries. Winters is
the second-ranking collegiate shot
putter in the nation. Kelly has
been a consistent placer in both
events at most of the big coast
meets the past two years.
