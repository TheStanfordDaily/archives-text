# Allen's Hit Topples S.H.
## 
### 
Jack Allen's three-run homer j
broke up a 4-4 tie in the seventh
inning here yesterday as the Stan
ford frosh beat Sacred Heart High
School of San Francisco, 7-4.
Joel Shulman, who had singled,
and Bob Hensler, who had walked,
were on base when Allen hit his ;
line shot over the left field fence. j
Hensler was walked with good !
reason, since he had hit singleton I
four-basers in the third and sixth !
innings. Both of his home runs
were also to left.
Daryl Sutherland, who walked
nine but struck out ten, got the j
victory.
