## Russia Asks UN to Act on U2 Incident 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. </P)â€”
The Soviet Union brought the
U2 spy plane case to the United
Nations last night, declaring
American flights over Soviet soil
threaten world peace.
The Russians demanded urgent
action by the U.N. Security Coun
cil to stop all such flights.
In Paris this week President
Eisenhower said the flights over
the U.S.S.R. had been ordered
stopped as of last Thursday.
Unexpected Quick Move
The Soviet move to the United
Nations from Paris as the arena
of Premier Nikita Khrushchev's
loud protests came quicker than
American and other diplomats
had expected.
The announcement of the So
viet maneiTver came as diplomatic
sources disclosed U.S. Ambassa
dor Henry Cabot Lodge is going
to Washington for urgent week
end conferences with President
Eisenhower on the U.S. course
now in the U.N.
Diplomatic informants said the
Washington talks would prepare
Lodge's presentation of an Eisen
hower plan for internationl aerial
surveillance in the wake of the
summit-wrecking U2 incident.
From Paris
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
A. Gromyko cabled the request
from Paris, where the summit
conference broke up Tuesday.
Gromyko sent the cable to Sir
Claude Corea of Ceylon, presi
dent of the 11-nation Council this
month, with a copy to U.N. Secre
tary General Dag Hammarskjold.
The cable from Gromyko said:
"Mr. President:
"The government of the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics re
quests that the Security Council
should be convened urgently to
examine the question of aggres
sive acts by the Air Force of the
United States of America against
the Soviet Union, creating a
threat to universal peace."
'Immediate Examination'
"The need for immediate exam
ination of this question arises
from the fact t hat military air
craft of the United States of
ernment of the United States of
America have repeatedly en
croached upon the air space of
the U.S.S.R. and that the gov-
America has declared these ac
tions on its part which violate
the frontiers of other sovereign
states to be its state policy.
"Under the United Nations
Charter the Security Council
bears the main responsibility for
the maintenance of international
peace and security.
"In view of the foregoing, the
Soviet government expects that
the Security Council will urgently
consider the question referred to
above and will take the necessary
measures to halt the unheard of
provocative actions of the United
States of America which repre
sent a threat to peace.
