# Professors Clash On Red Probers

"The House Un-American Activities Committee has frightened countless thousands of people, flaunted
principles of justice and diverted public attention and funds from more worthwhile uses," Economics
Professor William Capron told a Political Union audience last night in urging abolition of the com
mittee.
Political Science Professor Robert A. Horn, while refusing to defend the committee, felt that the

"case for a not disadvantage in
the committee's activities has
never been presented backed by
preponderant evidence," and op
posed its abolition.
Horn pointed out that the real
threat from a subversive organi
zation is not internal revolution,
but the aid it can give to a for
eign government, by attempting
to hinder our government's poli
cies and waiting for an opportu
nity to aid Russia in conquest.
Public Interest
Capron, reading from a Su
preme Court opinion by Justice
Black, pointed out the public in
terest in allowing people to join
organizations even though they
may err politically, and in allow
ing them privacy in their associa
tions.
There is a necessary distinction,
Capron held, between investiga
tion into espionage activties and
investigation of membership in
college study groups or beliefs of
teachers.
Horn denied that the Committee
is "simply attacking political dis
sent"; the Communist Party is a
subversive organization and its
members and study groups should
be a proper subject for investiga
tion.
"Brlieve a Great Deal"
"I believe in a great deal of dis
closure of the activities of such
organizations," Horn said.
Capron brought tho charge that
the House committee is in effect
trying people and punishing them
with humiliation and public scorn
without giving them the protec
tion of judicial procedures of a
criminal trial.
The members of the House
committee, he declared, take ad
vantage of their congressional im
munity to slander witnesses at
hearings.
Horn replied that if Congress
attempted to prevent public reac
tion against witnesses who take
the fifth amendment, it would
take away our right to express
our own opinions about the be
liefs of others. He urged that
often witnesses provoke Con
gressmen to their outbursts.
The best way to improve the
committee, Horn said, is 1o get
abler members appointed to it.
Unconstitutional
The resolution authorizing the
House committee, Capron said,
should be declared unconstitu
tional because it is so vague as to
give the committee a roving com
mission to investigate all activi
ties considered "Un-American,"
all varieties of expression of opin
ion classified as "propaganda."
The committee ought to be abol
ished. he said, because it has a
tradition of depriving people of
their lights under the first amend
ment, and other committees of
the House already have jurisdic
tion over this field.
Horn, admitting that congres
sional investigation is not neces
sarily the only or the best method
of meeting the subversive prob
lem, urged that a balancing of the
private against tho public interest
would show no net gain in abolish
ing the committee.
