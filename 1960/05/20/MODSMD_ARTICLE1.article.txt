Stanford's student Legislature gave official ASSU authorization
last night to on-campus collections for the legal defense of Stanford
students arrested at tlie recent House Un-American Activities Sub
committee hearings in San Francisco.
Funds from the collection will be deposited in the Student Or-

ganization Fund through the Po
litical Union account, and will be
administered by the collection
committee the ASSU Business
Manager and a Legislature rep
resentative.
A fraction of the monies col
lected will be used for the publica
tion of a booklet concerning the
hearings. No time limit was set
on the collections.
Legislature unanimously drop
ped a resolution endorsing the
faculty letter to Mayor Christo
pher of San Francisco published
in yesterday's Daily.
Legislature members observed
that the faculty letter was based
on factual information not now
available to them for study and
that Legislature would be "follow
ing the actions of the Committee
in endorsing something about
which we have no information
that we can verify ourselves."
Legislature observed that it
would be pointless to attach a ri
der to the faculty petition and
that student petitions now being
circulated speak for themselves.
In other business Legislature
gave final approval to a 160-61
ASSU budget totaling $37,930.50
in direct appropriations and $950
deferred items.
Estimated total income for
1960-61 is $40,985. allowing $2,105
for the contingency fund.
Legislature also agreed that Ju
dicial Council has no right to judi
cial review of ASSU boards and
commissions since Judicial Coun
cil authority is delegated from
Legislature. This deplored a Coun
cil ruling fall quarter on the en
tertainment booklet distribution.
Legislature tabled until next
week a motion to set up movie
discount card -sales as a conces
sion to be delegated to needy AS
SU organizations and a resolution
pertaining to Bookstore outside
shelves.
