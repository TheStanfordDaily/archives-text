j LISBON, Portugal (/P) — Presi
dent Eisenhower flew in yester
day from the cold of a dead sum
mit conference to a warm wel
come from 250,000 Portuguese
; shouting "Viva Eisenhower" and
J "We like Ike."
The wave of affection rolling
over the President brought out
ithe famous Eisenhower smile as
! he rode in an open car through
this capital's streets in a down
pour of confetti.
Once in his quarters in Queluz
Palace, however, his mood so
bered as he called for the West
ern powers to work even harder
1 for peace, despite the failure of
the Paris summit meeting.
Tighten Belts
"Rather than being dismayed,"
he told assembled U.S. employes,
J "we must tighten our belts, keep
j our chins up and each of us work
a little harder for the great cause
of peace with justice and free
! dom."
Eisenhower discussed briefly
the breakup of the summit meet
ing over Soviet Premier Nikita
' Khrushchev's demand that he
publicly apologize for the U2
I spy flight over the Soviet Union,
i "While none of the free world
thought that there would be any
revolutionary gains at the sum
mit conference, they did feel that
I there was a good chance of some
amelioration of some of the ten
sions in the world," Eisenhower
I said.
Dignity and Logic
"You deserve to know that the
; representatives of the Unite d
States, the United Kingdom and
i France did our very best to bring
j a bout that condition. We an
swered abuse with dignity and
logic. We answered accusations
'with facts."
The President referred to Por
tugal, a partner with the United
States in the North Atlantic
: Treaty Organization, as a tre
| mendous friend and ally.
In another allusion to the sum
mit debacle, he said: "Whenever
I these situations occur, we have
; to work ever stronger to strength
ien our own camp and bring it
ever close together."
Private Reception
Eisenhower spoke at a private
reception for Americans working
in Portugal. His remarks, based
jon notes taken by White House
; press secretary James C. Hag
j crty, then were made public.
Before leaving Paris, Eisen
hower made his first public com
; mcnt on the collapse at the sum
! Mit but without answering the
' insults hurled at him by Khrush
j chcv.
| "I share the disappointment of
jmy colleagues that, because of
| our inability to convene the sum
! Mit conference, we could make no
progress for easing the tensions
which So plague mankind," he
j said at Paris' Orly Field.
j "But I fully share their confi
dence that because of this set
back we of the Western Allies,
' and particularly France, Britain
; and the United States, both
{through their governments and
through their people, are joined
i even closer than before in a de
j termined pursuit of peace with
i justice in the world."
Replying to Portuguese report
ers' questions at a news confer
| ence, Hagerty said once again
| that Eisenhower is "completely
j disgusted and fed up with the
tactics and antics of Khrushchev."
