# Students and the Sheriff
## 
### 
Editor's note: The following
was taken from the KPFA tape
which was recorded outside the
hearing room Friday morning, a
few hours before the rioting
broke out.
KPFA announcer: A lot of what
the students happened to be pro
testing were the white cards.
These are small pieces of white
paper, which are the official in
vitations to the hearings. There
are from 260 to 300 seats in the
hearing room. There must have
been from 240 to 280 of these in
vitations issued by the committee.
The students maintained .hat
the hearing was not an open hear
ing at all since only these so-called
friends of the committees were
permitted 1o come in on the white
tickets. They maintained that yes
terday some of ihem had been
able to bo seated but after the
disturbance in the morning only
the people with white tickets had
been admitted. The students main
tained that this was an open hear
ing and they wanted to go in.
Shortly before the lunch recess
the Sheriff of San Francisco Coun
ty, Matthew Carberry, spoke to
the students:
White Cards
Student: Are the white cards
still going to be let in first?
Sheriff: My dear young lady, I
explained yesterday and today, as
far as white cards I know nothing
about it, I did not know anything
about it. As far as I am con
cerned the people who are here
will be admitted by the commit
tee. They've been spoken to in
regard to it.
Student: You're directing the
policemen. They're letting the
white cards in.
Sheriff: They are not directing
anyone in unless there are vacant
scats within. May I tell you that
yesterday the people who got
those invitations did not repre
sent 15 per cent of the audience.
Student: That's not true. No
body was let in except with white
cards.
Sheriff: Let me suggest that
you come back this afternoon in
an orderly manner, and I am sure
that a representative group — a
sufficient number will get in. I
am asking you to do that. All we
are concerned about is the preser
vation of law and order, and I am
telling you now that the police re
sponsibility this afternoon is in
protecting the due process for all
these other civil courts in this
building. I am not going to tell
you any more. My office is on the
third floor. Come up next week
and we'll talk about it.
Student: We want to see these
people. I'd like to know why you
threw us out.
Sheriff: No one has thrown you
out.
Student: We were thrown out.
Sheriff: I don't know anything
about your being thrown out. I
haven't seen you before.
Student: There are twenty va
cant seats in there.
Sheriff: There are a lot of ques
tions I hear. There are a lot of
answers I don't know. I told you
what we are trying to do within
our legal responsibility in law en
forcement and preserving peace.
I am suggesting to you that this
committee will adjourn in a mat
ter of a few minutes.
Subject to Arrest
If you would like to come back
and wait in an orderly manner
and act in an orderly manner, you
may wait here. But if you act in
a disorderly manner to the dis
turbance of peace, you are placing
yourself subject to arrest.
Student: The courts adjourned
yesterday and we were not kicked
out. Why is this not happening
today.
Sheriff: Did you learn anything
from yesterday? (Shouts.)
Student: I learned when a po
liceman tells you to leave the
room and you will be able to come
back after lunch, he doesn't know
what he's talking about. I was
twenty men from this door in the
afternoon: I was in there in the
morning. No one got in without
a white card.
Student: Sheriff, the point of
this is. we're here to protest.
Student: We do want to get in.

Sheriff: I told you what the
situation is. I appreciate your co
operation. 1 understand the situ
ation. I am cooperating to the
fullest extent. 1 am only telling
you what the situation is in this
building. The (seating) inside is
inadequate to handle everyone.
Student: I suggest we keep it
orderly. If the Sheriff will be kind
enough to stay around and an
swer questions and not make it
necessary for us to act in any
arbitrary way, either at his sug
gestions, as he admits in some
cases uninformed, or in ours
which may be uninformed. Can
we have hands.
Here All Day
Sheriff: I will be here all day.
Student: Here?
Sheriff: Here. I will be here
all day. I will be available all day.
Student: Sheriff, would it be
possible ... it seems to me the
same people have been in there
all day. . . .
Sheriff: I'll be here at two
o'clock. I have been here all day
as I was yesterday and you've had
complete cooperation.
Student: . . . and if he (doesn't)
cooperate with us at two o'clock
on an equal come basis, then at
two o'clock he'll hear from us
again. At two o'clock. VVe shall
cooperate with you until two
o'clock and if you keep your
promise and let everybody go in
to that hall on a first come, first
serve basis, we'll cooperate.
But if we're kept out of here
. . . if at that time we find out
that our law enforcement agen
cies, including 1 lie committee
which says it is a law enforce
ment agency, will allow people to
go into that hall on a free and
democratic basis, that is first
come and first serve, we will co
operate with the law enforcement
agencies. However, I would sug
gest to the group that the law
enforcement agencies, either true,
or not so true, cannot cooperate
with us, that we do organize, we
do use our free assembly, our
right to petition, we do it orderly,
but we do it loudly. Are you with
me? (Cheer.l
Ladies and Gentlemen
Sheriff: (To student) Ask them
to adjourn quietly. Will you ad
journ a moment or so? You may
stay here, it's entirely up to you,
but I'm suggesting you act like
ladies and gentlemen.
KPFA announcer: That was the
discussion with the Sheriff, which
in my opinion led to a great deal
of trouble. Many of the students
regarded this discussion as a hard
bargain drawn with the Sheriff
that would permit them to enter
the chamber when the hearings
were reconvened after lunch on a
first come, first serve basis, equal
with everybody, white card hold
ers included.
Many of them remained before
the hearing room doors, during
the lunch hour, but remained
there quietly. Some of the stu
dents were rather cynical and
somehow procured white cards
and lined up with the friends of
the hearing. At 1:15 or there
abouts, the police began letting
the friends of the court in and
the students remained quietly
packed behind their barricade
very strongly.
Self-Appointed Leaders
Every now and then they tried
to surge forward and they would
start shouting, and their self-ap
pointed leaders woidd shout and
■say: "No, no, everyone be quiet.
Wait. Lot's be patient, let's see
what they're going to olo." And
the friends of the committee filed
in, on and on and on. Soon the
hearing room was filled, the po
lice came out, and they said OK,
we have room for fifteen more.
The students were very angry
at this and they began yelling.
They let fifteen students in. They
let seven more in to my knowl
edge, perhaps a few more, cer
tainly not too many more. The
students felt that iheir bargain
with the Sheriff had been abro
gated, and so they began protest
ing by beginning their chants and
their singing all over again in the
rotunda. And shortly thereafter
the San Francisco motorcycle po
lice arrived with fire hoses.
