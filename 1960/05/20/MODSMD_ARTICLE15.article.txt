# Text of Prussion, Mandel Testimony
## 
### 
Editor's Note: The following 1 is
unedited testimony which was
given before the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee. One of
the witnesses, Karl l'russion, a
counterspy, was a friendly wit
ness who named people that he
said were members of the Com
munist Party.
The other witness, William
Mandel, refused to answer most
of the committee's questions.
Karl Prussion: My name is Karl
I Prussion. I reside in Los Altos,
California. My address is Box 39(5.
Los Altos. I am a metallurgical
j engineer by profession and a
builder by choice.
Staff Counsel Richard Arens:
Have you ever been a member
of tho Communist Party?
• Prussion: I have been a mem
i ber of ihe Communist Party for
: approximately 26 years.
Arens: When did you join the
| Communist Party and when did
j you finally irrevocably disassoci
i ate yourself from Communist
! Party?
I Prussion: I joined the Cotn
| munis't Party in 1933. I irrevoc
! ably disassociated myself from
the Communist Party August 12,
I 1959.
Rack to God
Arens: Mr. Prussion, earlier in
these hearings 1 was interrogat
ing a lady, Mrs. Barbara Hactle,
Who had been in the conspiracy
and who had broken with the con
spiracy and in the course of the
j interrogation I observed that in
finding her way out of Ihe con
i spiracy back as an anti-commu
nist, she had found her way back
to God. And I heard snickering
here by these young people.
In the Communist Party . . .
j within the framework of the Com
munist operation, is there room
for concepts of God and spiritual
| values as we are taught them at
; our mother's knee?
Prussion: The Communist Par
ty lowers man to that of a beast
in the field, (sic). As far as the
j Communists are concerned, man
is material not spiritual, he has
i no soul, he has no spirit, there
! is no God. This is* elementary,
j fundamental to every Communist,
j One cannot live a peaceable life
under Communism and believe in
God at the same time. Belief in
God tears to shreads the entire
, Communist conspiracy.
The Conspiracy
Arens: Would you tell us
I whether or not in the process by
which you disassociate yourself
; from the conspiracy, you were
! able to find any strength, any
spiritual faith, and a re-emphasis
in your own life in concepts of a
divine, being?
Prussion: It was during the
i very early part of my activities
in the Communist Party when I
i participated in the provocation of
violence and I was partly respon
sible for the death of many people
in riots, at that time asked God
| many times for forgiveness and
was trying to find a way out of
the Communist Party. . . .
(Prussion continues to list
associations with clergymen who
i helped him to find spiritual faith.)

Staff Counsel Richard Arens:
Kindly identify yourself by name,
residence, and occupation.
William Mandel: My name is
William Mandel. I live at 233
Lake Drive, Berkeley. By occu
pation I am a translator of .sci
entific material, a lecturer, a
leader of travel tours, an author,
a radio and television commenta
tor, and have been a newspaper
man at various times until com
mittees such as these have made
it difficult for me to continue in
some of these fields.
Arens: Where and when were
you born, please, sir?
Mandel: I was horn in New
York City, on June 4, 1917.
Arens: Would you give us a
word about your education?
Mandel: Yes, sir. I was edu
cated in the public schools, the
junior high schools, and high
schools of New York City. 1 had
one semester of biochemistry at
the age of 14 at the University of
Moscow, USSR. 1 specify my age
so that no nonsense about the
school can he asked of me.

I then had one year at City j
College in New York. I was ex
pelled for opposition to compul
sory military training in 1933 at
age 16.
In 1947 the Hoover Institute at
Stanford University engaged me
as a Fellow at post-doctoral sti
pend for the specific purpose of!
compiling an encyclopedia of thej
USSR. This is my education.
Arens: Are you now or have
you ever been a member of the
Communist Party?
Mandel: Sir. I am 42 years of ;
age, have never hatr to face a
jury as defendant, or a grand
jury as a witness in my life. My
research and writing have been
so public that two committees j
similar to this one, the Senate
Sub-Committee, and the McCar
thy committee, subpoenoed me as j
far back as eight and seven years j
ago respectively for having writ
ten a book entitled "The Soviet
Far East and Central Asia." No
indictment resulted from those
hearings either or from my con
tinued public speaking and writ
ing since that date.
Committed No Crime
Clearly, therefore, 1 have com- i
mitted no under any of the
laws of this country and am not
an agent of Russia.
Consequently, I refuse to testify
on the grounds that as a radio
and TV public affairs broadcaster
active in those capacities today,
the subpoena issued to me inter
fers with the rights of my sta
tions to schedule informational
programs on their merits and is
thus a direct violation of the First |
Amendment guaranteeing free- j
dom of speech and of the people's 1
right to hear.
Further, as a scholar with a j
20-year record of public writing
and lecturing in my chosen field, j
the study'of the Soviet Union, a J
field admitted by all to be one in
which this country is in vital need
of knowledge:
I refuse to testify on the
grounds that the subpoena is a
violation of freedom of enquiry,
which can only be expressed with
the free speech and free press
guarantees of the First Amend
ment to the academic community
as to all others.
Allegations
Lastly, I certainly shall not
answer questions representing
allegations against me made by \
persons not present and not iden
tified, whom I cannot confront,
and whom my lawyer cannot
cross-examine as to their trulh-j
fulness.
To rest my case solely on the
First Amendment would be. as;
36 cases now on the books show,
condemn me to years of court j
action at enormous cost it would
cost me my home, impoverish my
family for a very long lime to
come, which of course is what
this committee desires.
Therefore, I also refuse to tes
tify under my right not to be a
witness against myself, a right
originated to protect the innocent.
The guilty can be convicted by
the testimony of others if there i
is any real evidence to present.
Arens: Do you honestly appre
hend. sir, that if you told this
committee truthfully while you
are under oath whether or not

you are now this instant or ever
have been a member of the Com
munist Party, you would be sup
plying information which might
be used against you in a criminal
proceeding?
Mandel: Honorable beaters of
children, sadists, uniformed and
in plain clothes, distinguished
Dixiecrat wearing a clothing of
a gentleman, enfinent Republican
who opposes an accommodation
with the one country with which
we' must live at peace in order
for us all and our children to
survive, my boy of 15 left this
room a few minutes ago in sound
health and not jailed solely be
cause 1 asked him to be in here
and learn something about the
procedures of the United States
government and one of its com
mittees.
These Goons
Had he been outside where the
son of a friend of mine had his
head split by these goons operat
ing under your orders, my boy
today might pay the penalty of
permanent injury or a police rec
ord for desiring to come here and
hear how this committee oper
ates.
If you think that I am going
to cooperate with this collection
of Judases, of men who sit there
in violation of ihe United States
Constitution, if you think I will
cooperate with you in any way,
you are insane, i Cheers I
Arens: Were you a lecturer in
the California Labor School in
San Francisco in 1917?
Mandel: Yes, sir. I was. And I
lectured on Shostokovich's ora
torio, "Song of ihe Forest." What
do you know about that?
Laws on the Hooks
Mandel: As I told you before,
sir, it there are laws on the books
of this country under which any
of the activities in which I have
engaged, publicly and openly, and
I would be delighted to bring you
a list of hooks literally this long,
which either I have written or
which have been cited as authori
ties in books written years later
in other countries or journals to
which I have contributed, if any
of this public record, almost all
of it scholarly by anybody's defi
nition, is to be regarded or were
regarded by anyone as criminal
activity, there are laws on the
books under which the proper
I authorities of the United Slates
could have taken or could now
! take action against me.
I have never disappeared from
my home; I have been available
■ at all times. This question has
no purpose other than to harrass
me. When 1 was asked this ques
tion in 1943 (sic> by the late Joe

McCarthy, and let me say that I
am honored when people come
up to me on the street, perhaps
I don't deserve this honor, and
say you're the man who killed
Joe McCartny, because I hap
pened to appear on the first day
of the book burning hearing and
I did my best to conduct myself
in the manner in which I am
conducting myself today, if there
were any such evidence against
me under any law. ihe proper
authorities could move against
me.
This body is improperly con
stituted. It is a kangaroo court.
It does not have my respect it
has my utmost contempt, and 1
am not going to answer that
question.

counterspy, was a friendly wit
ness who named people that he
said were members of the Com
munist Party.
The other witness, William
Mandel, refused to answer most
of the committee's questions.
Karl Prussion: My name is Karl
I Prussion. I reside in Los Altos,
California. My address is Box 39(5.
Los Altos. I am a metallurgical
j engineer by profession and a
builder by choice.
Staff Counsel Richard Arens:
Have you ever been a member
of tho Communist Party?
• Prussion: I have been a mem
i ber of ihe Communist Party for
: approximately 26 years.
Arens: When did you join the
| Communist Party and when did
j you finally irrevocably disassoci
i ate yourself from Communist
! Party?
I Prussion: I joined the Cotn
| munis't Party in 1933. I irrevoc
! ably disassociated myself from
the Communist Party August 12,
I 1959.
Rack to God
Arens: Mr. Prussion, earlier in
these hearings 1 was interrogat
ing a lady, Mrs. Barbara Hactle,
Who had been in the conspiracy
and who had broken with the con
spiracy and in the course of the
j interrogation I observed that in
finding her way out of Ihe con
i spiracy back as an anti-commu
nist, she had found her way back
to God. And I heard snickering
here by these young people.
In the Communist Party . . .
j within the framework of the Com
munist operation, is there room
for concepts of God and spiritual
| values as we are taught them at
; our mother's knee?
Prussion: The Communist Par
ty lowers man to that of a beast
in the field, (sic). As far as the
j Communists are concerned, man
is material not spiritual, he has
i no soul, he has no spirit, there
! is no God. This is* elementary,
j fundamental to every Communist,
j One cannot live a peaceable life
under Communism and believe in
God at the same time. Belief in
God tears to shreads the entire
, Communist conspiracy.
The Conspiracy
Arens: Would you tell us
I whether or not in the process by
which you disassociate yourself
; from the conspiracy, you were
! able to find any strength, any
spiritual faith, and a re-emphasis
in your own life in concepts of a
divine, being?
Prussion: It was during the
i very early part of my activities
in the Communist Party when I
i participated in the provocation of
violence and I was partly respon
sible for the death of many people
in riots, at that time asked God
| many times for forgiveness and
was trying to find a way out of
the Communist Party. . . .
(Prussion continues to list
associations with clergymen who
i helped him to find spiritual faith.)

Staff Counsel Richard Arens:
Kindly identify yourself by name,
residence, and occupation.
William Mandel: My name is
William Mandel. I live at 233
Lake Drive, Berkeley. By occu
pation I am a translator of .sci
entific material, a lecturer, a
leader of travel tours, an author,
a radio and television commenta
tor, and have been a newspaper
man at various times until com
mittees such as these have made
it difficult for me to continue in
some of these fields.
Arens: Where and when were
you born, please, sir?
Mandel: I was horn in New
York City, on June 4, 1917.
Arens: Would you give us a
word about your education?
Mandel: Yes, sir. I was edu
cated in the public schools, the
junior high schools, and high
schools of New York City. 1 had
one semester of biochemistry at
the age of 14 at the University of
Moscow, USSR. 1 specify my age
so that no nonsense about the
school can he asked of me.

I then had one year at City j
College in New York. I was ex
pelled for opposition to compul
sory military training in 1933 at
age 16.
In 1947 the Hoover Institute at
Stanford University engaged me
as a Fellow at post-doctoral sti
pend for the specific purpose of!
compiling an encyclopedia of thej
USSR. This is my education.
Arens: Are you now or have
you ever been a member of the
Communist Party?
Mandel: Sir. I am 42 years of ;
age, have never hatr to face a
jury as defendant, or a grand
jury as a witness in my life. My
research and writing have been
so public that two committees j
similar to this one, the Senate
Sub-Committee, and the McCar
thy committee, subpoenoed me as j
far back as eight and seven years j
ago respectively for having writ
ten a book entitled "The Soviet
Far East and Central Asia." No
indictment resulted from those
hearings either or from my con
tinued public speaking and writ
ing since that date.
Committed No Crime
Clearly, therefore, 1 have com- i
mitted no under any of the
laws of this country and am not
an agent of Russia.
Consequently, I refuse to testify
on the grounds that as a radio
and TV public affairs broadcaster
active in those capacities today,
the subpoena issued to me inter
fers with the rights of my sta
tions to schedule informational
programs on their merits and is
thus a direct violation of the First |
Amendment guaranteeing free- j
dom of speech and of the people's 1
right to hear.
Further, as a scholar with a j
20-year record of public writing
and lecturing in my chosen field, j
the study'of the Soviet Union, a J
field admitted by all to be one in
which this country is in vital need
of knowledge:
I refuse to testify on the
grounds that the subpoena is a
violation of freedom of enquiry,
which can only be expressed with
the free speech and free press
guarantees of the First Amend
ment to the academic community
as to all others.
Allegations
Lastly, I certainly shall not
answer questions representing
allegations against me made by \
persons not present and not iden
tified, whom I cannot confront,
and whom my lawyer cannot
cross-examine as to their trulh-j
fulness.
To rest my case solely on the
First Amendment would be. as;
36 cases now on the books show,
condemn me to years of court j
action at enormous cost it would
cost me my home, impoverish my
family for a very long lime to
come, which of course is what
this committee desires.
Therefore, I also refuse to tes
tify under my right not to be a
witness against myself, a right
originated to protect the innocent.
The guilty can be convicted by
the testimony of others if there i
is any real evidence to present.
Arens: Do you honestly appre
hend. sir, that if you told this
committee truthfully while you
are under oath whether or not

you are now this instant or ever
have been a member of the Com
munist Party, you would be sup
plying information which might
be used against you in a criminal
proceeding?
Mandel: Honorable beaters of
children, sadists, uniformed and
in plain clothes, distinguished
Dixiecrat wearing a clothing of
a gentleman, enfinent Republican
who opposes an accommodation
with the one country with which
we' must live at peace in order
for us all and our children to
survive, my boy of 15 left this
room a few minutes ago in sound
health and not jailed solely be
cause 1 asked him to be in here
and learn something about the
procedures of the United States
government and one of its com
mittees.
These Goons
Had he been outside where the
son of a friend of mine had his
head split by these goons operat
ing under your orders, my boy
today might pay the penalty of
permanent injury or a police rec
ord for desiring to come here and
hear how this committee oper
ates.
If you think that I am going
to cooperate with this collection
of Judases, of men who sit there
in violation of ihe United States
Constitution, if you think I will
cooperate with you in any way,
you are insane, i Cheers I
Arens: Were you a lecturer in
the California Labor School in
San Francisco in 1917?
Mandel: Yes, sir. I was. And I
lectured on Shostokovich's ora
torio, "Song of ihe Forest." What
do you know about that?
Laws on the Hooks
Mandel: As I told you before,
sir, it there are laws on the books
of this country under which any
of the activities in which I have
engaged, publicly and openly, and
I would be delighted to bring you
a list of hooks literally this long,
which either I have written or
which have been cited as authori
ties in books written years later
in other countries or journals to
which I have contributed, if any
of this public record, almost all
of it scholarly by anybody's defi
nition, is to be regarded or were
regarded by anyone as criminal
activity, there are laws on the
books under which the proper
I authorities of the United Slates
could have taken or could now
! take action against me.
I have never disappeared from
my home; I have been available
■ at all times. This question has
no purpose other than to harrass
me. When 1 was asked this ques
tion in 1943 (sic> by the late Joe

McCarthy, and let me say that I
am honored when people come
up to me on the street, perhaps
I don't deserve this honor, and
say you're the man who killed
Joe McCartny, because I hap
pened to appear on the first day
of the book burning hearing and
I did my best to conduct myself
in the manner in which I am
conducting myself today, if there
were any such evidence against
me under any law. ihe proper
authorities could move against
me.
This body is improperly con
stituted. It is a kangaroo court.
It does not have my respect it
has my utmost contempt, and 1
am not going to answer that
question.

of the committee's questions.
Karl Prussion: My name is Karl
I Prussion. I reside in Los Altos,
California. My address is Box 39(5.
Los Altos. I am a metallurgical
j engineer by profession and a
builder by choice.
Staff Counsel Richard Arens:
Have you ever been a member
of tho Communist Party?
• Prussion: I have been a mem
i ber of ihe Communist Party for
: approximately 26 years.
Arens: When did you join the
| Communist Party and when did
j you finally irrevocably disassoci
i ate yourself from Communist
! Party?
I Prussion: I joined the Cotn
| munis't Party in 1933. I irrevoc
! ably disassociated myself from
the Communist Party August 12,
I 1959.
Rack to God
Arens: Mr. Prussion, earlier in
these hearings 1 was interrogat
ing a lady, Mrs. Barbara Hactle,
Who had been in the conspiracy
and who had broken with the con
spiracy and in the course of the
j interrogation I observed that in
finding her way out of Ihe con
i spiracy back as an anti-commu
nist, she had found her way back
to God. And I heard snickering
here by these young people.
In the Communist Party . . .
j within the framework of the Com
munist operation, is there room
for concepts of God and spiritual
| values as we are taught them at
; our mother's knee?
Prussion: The Communist Par
ty lowers man to that of a beast
in the field, (sic). As far as the
j Communists are concerned, man
is material not spiritual, he has
i no soul, he has no spirit, there
! is no God. This is* elementary,
j fundamental to every Communist,
j One cannot live a peaceable life
under Communism and believe in
God at the same time. Belief in
God tears to shreads the entire
, Communist conspiracy.
The Conspiracy
Arens: Would you tell us
I whether or not in the process by
which you disassociate yourself
; from the conspiracy, you were
! able to find any strength, any
spiritual faith, and a re-emphasis
in your own life in concepts of a
divine, being?
Prussion: It was during the
i very early part of my activities
in the Communist Party when I
i participated in the provocation of
violence and I was partly respon
sible for the death of many people
in riots, at that time asked God
| many times for forgiveness and
was trying to find a way out of
the Communist Party. . . .
(Prussion continues to list
associations with clergymen who
i helped him to find spiritual faith.)

Staff Counsel Richard Arens:
Kindly identify yourself by name,
residence, and occupation.
William Mandel: My name is
William Mandel. I live at 233
Lake Drive, Berkeley. By occu
pation I am a translator of .sci
entific material, a lecturer, a
leader of travel tours, an author,
a radio and television commenta
tor, and have been a newspaper
man at various times until com
mittees such as these have made
it difficult for me to continue in
some of these fields.
Arens: Where and when were
you born, please, sir?
Mandel: I was horn in New
York City, on June 4, 1917.
Arens: Would you give us a
word about your education?
Mandel: Yes, sir. I was edu
cated in the public schools, the
junior high schools, and high
schools of New York City. 1 had
one semester of biochemistry at
the age of 14 at the University of
Moscow, USSR. 1 specify my age
so that no nonsense about the
school can he asked of me.

I then had one year at City j
College in New York. I was ex
pelled for opposition to compul
sory military training in 1933 at
age 16.
In 1947 the Hoover Institute at
Stanford University engaged me
as a Fellow at post-doctoral sti
pend for the specific purpose of!
compiling an encyclopedia of thej
USSR. This is my education.
Arens: Are you now or have
you ever been a member of the
Communist Party?
Mandel: Sir. I am 42 years of ;
age, have never hatr to face a
jury as defendant, or a grand
jury as a witness in my life. My
research and writing have been
so public that two committees j
similar to this one, the Senate
Sub-Committee, and the McCar
thy committee, subpoenoed me as j
far back as eight and seven years j
ago respectively for having writ
ten a book entitled "The Soviet
Far East and Central Asia." No
indictment resulted from those
hearings either or from my con
tinued public speaking and writ
ing since that date.
Committed No Crime
Clearly, therefore, 1 have com- i
mitted no under any of the
laws of this country and am not
an agent of Russia.
Consequently, I refuse to testify
on the grounds that as a radio
and TV public affairs broadcaster
active in those capacities today,
the subpoena issued to me inter
fers with the rights of my sta
tions to schedule informational
programs on their merits and is
thus a direct violation of the First |
Amendment guaranteeing free- j
dom of speech and of the people's 1
right to hear.
Further, as a scholar with a j
20-year record of public writing
and lecturing in my chosen field, j
the study'of the Soviet Union, a J
field admitted by all to be one in
which this country is in vital need
of knowledge:
I refuse to testify on the
grounds that the subpoena is a
violation of freedom of enquiry,
which can only be expressed with
the free speech and free press
guarantees of the First Amend
ment to the academic community
as to all others.
Allegations
Lastly, I certainly shall not
answer questions representing
allegations against me made by \
persons not present and not iden
tified, whom I cannot confront,
and whom my lawyer cannot
cross-examine as to their trulh-j
fulness.
To rest my case solely on the
First Amendment would be. as;
36 cases now on the books show,
condemn me to years of court j
action at enormous cost it would
cost me my home, impoverish my
family for a very long lime to
come, which of course is what
this committee desires.
Therefore, I also refuse to tes
tify under my right not to be a
witness against myself, a right
originated to protect the innocent.
The guilty can be convicted by
the testimony of others if there i
is any real evidence to present.
Arens: Do you honestly appre
hend. sir, that if you told this
committee truthfully while you
are under oath whether or not

you are now this instant or ever
have been a member of the Com
munist Party, you would be sup
plying information which might
be used against you in a criminal
proceeding?
Mandel: Honorable beaters of
children, sadists, uniformed and
in plain clothes, distinguished
Dixiecrat wearing a clothing of
a gentleman, enfinent Republican
who opposes an accommodation
with the one country with which
we' must live at peace in order
for us all and our children to
survive, my boy of 15 left this
room a few minutes ago in sound
health and not jailed solely be
cause 1 asked him to be in here
and learn something about the
procedures of the United States
government and one of its com
mittees.
These Goons
Had he been outside where the
son of a friend of mine had his
head split by these goons operat
ing under your orders, my boy
today might pay the penalty of
permanent injury or a police rec
ord for desiring to come here and
hear how this committee oper
ates.
If you think that I am going
to cooperate with this collection
of Judases, of men who sit there
in violation of ihe United States
Constitution, if you think I will
cooperate with you in any way,
you are insane, i Cheers I
Arens: Were you a lecturer in
the California Labor School in
San Francisco in 1917?
Mandel: Yes, sir. I was. And I
lectured on Shostokovich's ora
torio, "Song of ihe Forest." What
do you know about that?
Laws on the Hooks
Mandel: As I told you before,
sir, it there are laws on the books
of this country under which any
of the activities in which I have
engaged, publicly and openly, and
I would be delighted to bring you
a list of hooks literally this long,
which either I have written or
which have been cited as authori
ties in books written years later
in other countries or journals to
which I have contributed, if any
of this public record, almost all
of it scholarly by anybody's defi
nition, is to be regarded or were
regarded by anyone as criminal
activity, there are laws on the
books under which the proper
I authorities of the United Slates
could have taken or could now
! take action against me.
I have never disappeared from
my home; I have been available
■ at all times. This question has
no purpose other than to harrass
me. When 1 was asked this ques
tion in 1943 (sic> by the late Joe

McCarthy, and let me say that I
am honored when people come
up to me on the street, perhaps
I don't deserve this honor, and
say you're the man who killed
Joe McCartny, because I hap
pened to appear on the first day
of the book burning hearing and
I did my best to conduct myself
in the manner in which I am
conducting myself today, if there
were any such evidence against
me under any law. ihe proper
authorities could move against
me.
This body is improperly con
stituted. It is a kangaroo court.
It does not have my respect it
has my utmost contempt, and 1
am not going to answer that
question.
Editor's Note: The following 1 is
unedited testimony which was
given before the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee. One of
the witnesses, Karl l'russion, a
counterspy, was a friendly wit
ness who named people that he
said were members of the Com

Staff Counsel Richard Arens:
Have you ever been a member
of tho Communist Party?
• Prussion: I have been a mem
i ber of ihe Communist Party for
: approximately 26 years.
Arens: When did you join the
| Communist Party and when did
j you finally irrevocably disassoci
i ate yourself from Communist
! Party?
I Prussion: I joined the Cotn
| munis't Party in 1933. I irrevoc
! ably disassociated myself from
the Communist Party August 12,
I 1959.
Rack to God
Arens: Mr. Prussion, earlier in
these hearings 1 was interrogat
ing a lady, Mrs. Barbara Hactle,
Who had been in the conspiracy
and who had broken with the con
spiracy and in the course of the
j interrogation I observed that in
finding her way out of Ihe con
i spiracy back as an anti-commu
nist, she had found her way back
to God. And I heard snickering
here by these young people.
In the Communist Party . . .
j within the framework of the Com
munist operation, is there room
for concepts of God and spiritual
| values as we are taught them at
; our mother's knee?
Prussion: The Communist Par
ty lowers man to that of a beast
in the field, (sic). As far as the
j Communists are concerned, man
is material not spiritual, he has
i no soul, he has no spirit, there
! is no God. This is* elementary,
j fundamental to every Communist,
j One cannot live a peaceable life
under Communism and believe in
God at the same time. Belief in
God tears to shreads the entire
, Communist conspiracy.
The Conspiracy
Arens: Would you tell us
I whether or not in the process by
which you disassociate yourself
; from the conspiracy, you were
! able to find any strength, any
spiritual faith, and a re-emphasis
in your own life in concepts of a
divine, being?
Prussion: It was during the
i very early part of my activities
in the Communist Party when I
i participated in the provocation of
violence and I was partly respon
sible for the death of many people
in riots, at that time asked God
| many times for forgiveness and
was trying to find a way out of
the Communist Party. . . .
(Prussion continues to list
associations with clergymen who
i helped him to find spiritual faith.)

Staff Counsel Richard Arens:
Kindly identify yourself by name,
residence, and occupation.
William Mandel: My name is
William Mandel. I live at 233
Lake Drive, Berkeley. By occu
pation I am a translator of .sci
entific material, a lecturer, a
leader of travel tours, an author,
a radio and television commenta
tor, and have been a newspaper
man at various times until com
mittees such as these have made
it difficult for me to continue in
some of these fields.
Arens: Where and when were
you born, please, sir?
Mandel: I was horn in New
York City, on June 4, 1917.
Arens: Would you give us a
word about your education?
Mandel: Yes, sir. I was edu
cated in the public schools, the
junior high schools, and high
schools of New York City. 1 had
one semester of biochemistry at
the age of 14 at the University of
Moscow, USSR. 1 specify my age
so that no nonsense about the
school can he asked of me.

I then had one year at City j
College in New York. I was ex
pelled for opposition to compul
sory military training in 1933 at
age 16.
In 1947 the Hoover Institute at
Stanford University engaged me
as a Fellow at post-doctoral sti
pend for the specific purpose of!
compiling an encyclopedia of thej
USSR. This is my education.
Arens: Are you now or have
you ever been a member of the
Communist Party?
Mandel: Sir. I am 42 years of ;
age, have never hatr to face a
jury as defendant, or a grand
jury as a witness in my life. My
research and writing have been
so public that two committees j
similar to this one, the Senate
Sub-Committee, and the McCar
thy committee, subpoenoed me as j
far back as eight and seven years j
ago respectively for having writ
ten a book entitled "The Soviet
Far East and Central Asia." No
indictment resulted from those
hearings either or from my con
tinued public speaking and writ
ing since that date.
Committed No Crime
Clearly, therefore, 1 have com- i
mitted no under any of the
laws of this country and am not
an agent of Russia.
Consequently, I refuse to testify
on the grounds that as a radio
and TV public affairs broadcaster
active in those capacities today,
the subpoena issued to me inter
fers with the rights of my sta
tions to schedule informational
programs on their merits and is
thus a direct violation of the First |
Amendment guaranteeing free- j
dom of speech and of the people's 1
right to hear.
Further, as a scholar with a j
20-year record of public writing
and lecturing in my chosen field, j
the study'of the Soviet Union, a J
field admitted by all to be one in
which this country is in vital need
of knowledge:
I refuse to testify on the
grounds that the subpoena is a
violation of freedom of enquiry,
which can only be expressed with
the free speech and free press
guarantees of the First Amend
ment to the academic community
as to all others.
Allegations
Lastly, I certainly shall not
answer questions representing
allegations against me made by \
persons not present and not iden
tified, whom I cannot confront,
and whom my lawyer cannot
cross-examine as to their trulh-j
fulness.
To rest my case solely on the
First Amendment would be. as;
36 cases now on the books show,
condemn me to years of court j
action at enormous cost it would
cost me my home, impoverish my
family for a very long lime to
come, which of course is what
this committee desires.
Therefore, I also refuse to tes
tify under my right not to be a
witness against myself, a right
originated to protect the innocent.
The guilty can be convicted by
the testimony of others if there i
is any real evidence to present.
Arens: Do you honestly appre
hend. sir, that if you told this
committee truthfully while you
are under oath whether or not

you are now this instant or ever
have been a member of the Com
munist Party, you would be sup
plying information which might
be used against you in a criminal
proceeding?
Mandel: Honorable beaters of
children, sadists, uniformed and
in plain clothes, distinguished
Dixiecrat wearing a clothing of
a gentleman, enfinent Republican
who opposes an accommodation
with the one country with which
we' must live at peace in order
for us all and our children to
survive, my boy of 15 left this
room a few minutes ago in sound
health and not jailed solely be
cause 1 asked him to be in here
and learn something about the
procedures of the United States
government and one of its com
mittees.
These Goons
Had he been outside where the
son of a friend of mine had his
head split by these goons operat
ing under your orders, my boy
today might pay the penalty of
permanent injury or a police rec
ord for desiring to come here and
hear how this committee oper
ates.
If you think that I am going
to cooperate with this collection
of Judases, of men who sit there
in violation of ihe United States
Constitution, if you think I will
cooperate with you in any way,
you are insane, i Cheers I
Arens: Were you a lecturer in
the California Labor School in
San Francisco in 1917?
Mandel: Yes, sir. I was. And I
lectured on Shostokovich's ora
torio, "Song of ihe Forest." What
do you know about that?
Laws on the Hooks
Mandel: As I told you before,
sir, it there are laws on the books
of this country under which any
of the activities in which I have
engaged, publicly and openly, and
I would be delighted to bring you
a list of hooks literally this long,
which either I have written or
which have been cited as authori
ties in books written years later
in other countries or journals to
which I have contributed, if any
of this public record, almost all
of it scholarly by anybody's defi
nition, is to be regarded or were
regarded by anyone as criminal
activity, there are laws on the
books under which the proper
I authorities of the United Slates
could have taken or could now
! take action against me.
I have never disappeared from
my home; I have been available
■ at all times. This question has
no purpose other than to harrass
me. When 1 was asked this ques
tion in 1943 (sic> by the late Joe

McCarthy, and let me say that I
am honored when people come
up to me on the street, perhaps
I don't deserve this honor, and
say you're the man who killed
Joe McCartny, because I hap
pened to appear on the first day
of the book burning hearing and
I did my best to conduct myself
in the manner in which I am
conducting myself today, if there
were any such evidence against
me under any law. ihe proper
authorities could move against
me.
This body is improperly con
stituted. It is a kangaroo court.
It does not have my respect it
has my utmost contempt, and 1
am not going to answer that
question.
Editor's Note: The following 1 is
unedited testimony which was
given before the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee. One of
the witnesses, Karl l'russion, a
counterspy, was a friendly wit
ness who named people that he
said were members of the Com
munist Party.
The other witness, William

of the committee's questions.

• Prussion: I have been a mem
i ber of ihe Communist Party for
: approximately 26 years.
Arens: When did you join the
| Communist Party and when did
j you finally irrevocably disassoci
i ate yourself from Communist
! Party?
I Prussion: I joined the Cotn
| munis't Party in 1933. I irrevoc
! ably disassociated myself from
the Communist Party August 12,
I 1959.
Rack to God
Arens: Mr. Prussion, earlier in
these hearings 1 was interrogat
ing a lady, Mrs. Barbara Hactle,
Who had been in the conspiracy
and who had broken with the con
spiracy and in the course of the
j interrogation I observed that in
finding her way out of Ihe con
i spiracy back as an anti-commu
nist, she had found her way back
to God. And I heard snickering
here by these young people.
In the Communist Party . . .
j within the framework of the Com
munist operation, is there room
for concepts of God and spiritual
| values as we are taught them at
; our mother's knee?
Prussion: The Communist Par
ty lowers man to that of a beast
in the field, (sic). As far as the
j Communists are concerned, man
is material not spiritual, he has
i no soul, he has no spirit, there
! is no God. This is* elementary,
j fundamental to every Communist,
j One cannot live a peaceable life
under Communism and believe in
God at the same time. Belief in
God tears to shreads the entire
, Communist conspiracy.
The Conspiracy
Arens: Would you tell us
I whether or not in the process by
which you disassociate yourself
; from the conspiracy, you were
! able to find any strength, any
spiritual faith, and a re-emphasis
in your own life in concepts of a
divine, being?
Prussion: It was during the
i very early part of my activities
in the Communist Party when I
i participated in the provocation of
violence and I was partly respon
sible for the death of many people
in riots, at that time asked God
| many times for forgiveness and
was trying to find a way out of
the Communist Party. . . .
(Prussion continues to list
associations with clergymen who
i helped him to find spiritual faith.)

Staff Counsel Richard Arens:
Kindly identify yourself by name,
residence, and occupation.
William Mandel: My name is
William Mandel. I live at 233
Lake Drive, Berkeley. By occu
pation I am a translator of .sci
entific material, a lecturer, a
leader of travel tours, an author,
a radio and television commenta
tor, and have been a newspaper
man at various times until com
mittees such as these have made
it difficult for me to continue in
some of these fields.
Arens: Where and when were
you born, please, sir?
Mandel: I was horn in New
York City, on June 4, 1917.
Arens: Would you give us a
word about your education?
Mandel: Yes, sir. I was edu
cated in the public schools, the
junior high schools, and high
schools of New York City. 1 had
one semester of biochemistry at
the age of 14 at the University of
Moscow, USSR. 1 specify my age
so that no nonsense about the
school can he asked of me.

I then had one year at City j
College in New York. I was ex
pelled for opposition to compul
sory military training in 1933 at
age 16.
In 1947 the Hoover Institute at
Stanford University engaged me
as a Fellow at post-doctoral sti
pend for the specific purpose of!
compiling an encyclopedia of thej
USSR. This is my education.
Arens: Are you now or have
you ever been a member of the
Communist Party?
Mandel: Sir. I am 42 years of ;
age, have never hatr to face a
jury as defendant, or a grand
jury as a witness in my life. My
research and writing have been
so public that two committees j
similar to this one, the Senate
Sub-Committee, and the McCar
thy committee, subpoenoed me as j
far back as eight and seven years j
ago respectively for having writ
ten a book entitled "The Soviet
Far East and Central Asia." No
indictment resulted from those
hearings either or from my con
tinued public speaking and writ
ing since that date.
Committed No Crime
Clearly, therefore, 1 have com- i
mitted no under any of the
laws of this country and am not
an agent of Russia.
Consequently, I refuse to testify
on the grounds that as a radio
and TV public affairs broadcaster
active in those capacities today,
the subpoena issued to me inter
fers with the rights of my sta
tions to schedule informational
programs on their merits and is
thus a direct violation of the First |
Amendment guaranteeing free- j
dom of speech and of the people's 1
right to hear.
Further, as a scholar with a j
20-year record of public writing
and lecturing in my chosen field, j
the study'of the Soviet Union, a J
field admitted by all to be one in
which this country is in vital need
of knowledge:
I refuse to testify on the
grounds that the subpoena is a
violation of freedom of enquiry,
which can only be expressed with
the free speech and free press
guarantees of the First Amend
ment to the academic community
as to all others.
Allegations
Lastly, I certainly shall not
answer questions representing
allegations against me made by \
persons not present and not iden
tified, whom I cannot confront,
and whom my lawyer cannot
cross-examine as to their trulh-j
fulness.
To rest my case solely on the
First Amendment would be. as;
36 cases now on the books show,
condemn me to years of court j
action at enormous cost it would
cost me my home, impoverish my
family for a very long lime to
come, which of course is what
this committee desires.
Therefore, I also refuse to tes
tify under my right not to be a
witness against myself, a right
originated to protect the innocent.
The guilty can be convicted by
the testimony of others if there i
is any real evidence to present.
Arens: Do you honestly appre
hend. sir, that if you told this
committee truthfully while you
are under oath whether or not

you are now this instant or ever
have been a member of the Com
munist Party, you would be sup
plying information which might
be used against you in a criminal
proceeding?
Mandel: Honorable beaters of
children, sadists, uniformed and
in plain clothes, distinguished
Dixiecrat wearing a clothing of
a gentleman, enfinent Republican
who opposes an accommodation
with the one country with which
we' must live at peace in order
for us all and our children to
survive, my boy of 15 left this
room a few minutes ago in sound
health and not jailed solely be
cause 1 asked him to be in here
and learn something about the
procedures of the United States
government and one of its com
mittees.
These Goons
Had he been outside where the
son of a friend of mine had his
head split by these goons operat
ing under your orders, my boy
today might pay the penalty of
permanent injury or a police rec
ord for desiring to come here and
hear how this committee oper
ates.
If you think that I am going
to cooperate with this collection
of Judases, of men who sit there
in violation of ihe United States
Constitution, if you think I will
cooperate with you in any way,
you are insane, i Cheers I
Arens: Were you a lecturer in
the California Labor School in
San Francisco in 1917?
Mandel: Yes, sir. I was. And I
lectured on Shostokovich's ora
torio, "Song of ihe Forest." What
do you know about that?
Laws on the Hooks
Mandel: As I told you before,
sir, it there are laws on the books
of this country under which any
of the activities in which I have
engaged, publicly and openly, and
I would be delighted to bring you
a list of hooks literally this long,
which either I have written or
which have been cited as authori
ties in books written years later
in other countries or journals to
which I have contributed, if any
of this public record, almost all
of it scholarly by anybody's defi
nition, is to be regarded or were
regarded by anyone as criminal
activity, there are laws on the
books under which the proper
I authorities of the United Slates
could have taken or could now
! take action against me.
I have never disappeared from
my home; I have been available
■ at all times. This question has
no purpose other than to harrass
me. When 1 was asked this ques
tion in 1943 (sic> by the late Joe

McCarthy, and let me say that I
am honored when people come
up to me on the street, perhaps
I don't deserve this honor, and
say you're the man who killed
Joe McCartny, because I hap
pened to appear on the first day
of the book burning hearing and
I did my best to conduct myself
in the manner in which I am
conducting myself today, if there
were any such evidence against
me under any law. ihe proper
authorities could move against
me.
This body is improperly con
stituted. It is a kangaroo court.
It does not have my respect it
has my utmost contempt, and 1
am not going to answer that
question.
Editor's Note: The following 1 is
unedited testimony which was
given before the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee. One of
the witnesses, Karl l'russion, a
counterspy, was a friendly wit

said were members of the Com

of the committee's questions.

j you finally irrevocably disassoci
i ate yourself from Communist
! Party?
I Prussion: I joined the Cotn
| munis't Party in 1933. I irrevoc
! ably disassociated myself from
the Communist Party August 12,
I 1959.
Rack to God
Arens: Mr. Prussion, earlier in
these hearings 1 was interrogat
ing a lady, Mrs. Barbara Hactle,
Who had been in the conspiracy
and who had broken with the con
spiracy and in the course of the
j interrogation I observed that in
finding her way out of Ihe con
i spiracy back as an anti-commu
nist, she had found her way back
to God. And I heard snickering
here by these young people.
In the Communist Party . . .
j within the framework of the Com
munist operation, is there room
for concepts of God and spiritual
| values as we are taught them at
; our mother's knee?
Prussion: The Communist Par
ty lowers man to that of a beast
in the field, (sic). As far as the
j Communists are concerned, man
is material not spiritual, he has
i no soul, he has no spirit, there
! is no God. This is* elementary,
j fundamental to every Communist,
j One cannot live a peaceable life
under Communism and believe in
God at the same time. Belief in
God tears to shreads the entire
, Communist conspiracy.
The Conspiracy
Arens: Would you tell us
I whether or not in the process by
which you disassociate yourself
; from the conspiracy, you were
! able to find any strength, any
spiritual faith, and a re-emphasis
in your own life in concepts of a
divine, being?
Prussion: It was during the
i very early part of my activities
in the Communist Party when I
i participated in the provocation of
violence and I was partly respon
sible for the death of many people
in riots, at that time asked God
| many times for forgiveness and
was trying to find a way out of
the Communist Party. . . .
(Prussion continues to list
associations with clergymen who
i helped him to find spiritual faith.)

Staff Counsel Richard Arens:
Kindly identify yourself by name,
residence, and occupation.
William Mandel: My name is
William Mandel. I live at 233
Lake Drive, Berkeley. By occu
pation I am a translator of .sci
entific material, a lecturer, a
leader of travel tours, an author,
a radio and television commenta
tor, and have been a newspaper
man at various times until com
mittees such as these have made
it difficult for me to continue in
some of these fields.
Arens: Where and when were
you born, please, sir?
Mandel: I was horn in New
York City, on June 4, 1917.
Arens: Would you give us a
word about your education?
Mandel: Yes, sir. I was edu
cated in the public schools, the
junior high schools, and high
schools of New York City. 1 had
one semester of biochemistry at
the age of 14 at the University of
Moscow, USSR. 1 specify my age
so that no nonsense about the
school can he asked of me.

I then had one year at City j
College in New York. I was ex
pelled for opposition to compul
sory military training in 1933 at
age 16.
In 1947 the Hoover Institute at
Stanford University engaged me
as a Fellow at post-doctoral sti
pend for the specific purpose of!
compiling an encyclopedia of thej
USSR. This is my education.
Arens: Are you now or have
you ever been a member of the
Communist Party?
Mandel: Sir. I am 42 years of ;
age, have never hatr to face a
jury as defendant, or a grand
jury as a witness in my life. My
research and writing have been
so public that two committees j
similar to this one, the Senate
Sub-Committee, and the McCar
thy committee, subpoenoed me as j
far back as eight and seven years j
ago respectively for having writ
ten a book entitled "The Soviet
Far East and Central Asia." No
indictment resulted from those
hearings either or from my con
tinued public speaking and writ
ing since that date.
Committed No Crime
Clearly, therefore, 1 have com- i
mitted no under any of the
laws of this country and am not
an agent of Russia.
Consequently, I refuse to testify
on the grounds that as a radio
and TV public affairs broadcaster
active in those capacities today,
the subpoena issued to me inter
fers with the rights of my sta
tions to schedule informational
programs on their merits and is
thus a direct violation of the First |
Amendment guaranteeing free- j
dom of speech and of the people's 1
right to hear.
Further, as a scholar with a j
20-year record of public writing
and lecturing in my chosen field, j
the study'of the Soviet Union, a J
field admitted by all to be one in
which this country is in vital need
of knowledge:
I refuse to testify on the
grounds that the subpoena is a
violation of freedom of enquiry,
which can only be expressed with
the free speech and free press
guarantees of the First Amend
ment to the academic community
as to all others.
Allegations
Lastly, I certainly shall not
answer questions representing
allegations against me made by \
persons not present and not iden
tified, whom I cannot confront,
and whom my lawyer cannot
cross-examine as to their trulh-j
fulness.
To rest my case solely on the
First Amendment would be. as;
36 cases now on the books show,
condemn me to years of court j
action at enormous cost it would
cost me my home, impoverish my
family for a very long lime to
come, which of course is what
this committee desires.
Therefore, I also refuse to tes
tify under my right not to be a
witness against myself, a right
originated to protect the innocent.
The guilty can be convicted by
the testimony of others if there i
is any real evidence to present.
Arens: Do you honestly appre
hend. sir, that if you told this
committee truthfully while you
are under oath whether or not

you are now this instant or ever
have been a member of the Com
munist Party, you would be sup
plying information which might
be used against you in a criminal
proceeding?
Mandel: Honorable beaters of
children, sadists, uniformed and
in plain clothes, distinguished
Dixiecrat wearing a clothing of
a gentleman, enfinent Republican
who opposes an accommodation
with the one country with which
we' must live at peace in order
for us all and our children to
survive, my boy of 15 left this
room a few minutes ago in sound
health and not jailed solely be
cause 1 asked him to be in here
and learn something about the
procedures of the United States
government and one of its com
mittees.
These Goons
Had he been outside where the
son of a friend of mine had his
head split by these goons operat
ing under your orders, my boy
today might pay the penalty of
permanent injury or a police rec
ord for desiring to come here and
hear how this committee oper
ates.
If you think that I am going
to cooperate with this collection
of Judases, of men who sit there
in violation of ihe United States
Constitution, if you think I will
cooperate with you in any way,
you are insane, i Cheers I
Arens: Were you a lecturer in
the California Labor School in
San Francisco in 1917?
Mandel: Yes, sir. I was. And I
lectured on Shostokovich's ora
torio, "Song of ihe Forest." What
do you know about that?
Laws on the Hooks
Mandel: As I told you before,
sir, it there are laws on the books
of this country under which any
of the activities in which I have
engaged, publicly and openly, and
I would be delighted to bring you
a list of hooks literally this long,
which either I have written or
which have been cited as authori
ties in books written years later
in other countries or journals to
which I have contributed, if any
of this public record, almost all
of it scholarly by anybody's defi
nition, is to be regarded or were
regarded by anyone as criminal
activity, there are laws on the
books under which the proper
I authorities of the United Slates
could have taken or could now
! take action against me.
I have never disappeared from
my home; I have been available
■ at all times. This question has
no purpose other than to harrass
me. When 1 was asked this ques
tion in 1943 (sic> by the late Joe

McCarthy, and let me say that I
am honored when people come
up to me on the street, perhaps
I don't deserve this honor, and
say you're the man who killed
Joe McCartny, because I hap
pened to appear on the first day
of the book burning hearing and
I did my best to conduct myself
in the manner in which I am
conducting myself today, if there
were any such evidence against
me under any law. ihe proper
authorities could move against
me.
This body is improperly con
stituted. It is a kangaroo court.
It does not have my respect it
has my utmost contempt, and 1
am not going to answer that
question.
