Name-Calling
Editor, the Daily:
Mr. Rolls' shrill, slanderous let
ter attacking those who sympa
thize with the student "rioters"
j stood in marked contrast to the
j moderate and mature letter above
j itâ€” a letter signed by eighty-nine
of Stanford's most respected fac
ulty, who sympathize wi 1 h those
same students and their cause.
| Perhaps Mr. Rolls should pause
i lo reflect upon his own maturity,
before indulging in name-calling.
