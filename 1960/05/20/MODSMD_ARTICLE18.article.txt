# STEVE BAFFREY LOOKS AT LIFE
## 
### 
A communique from the editorial
offices of LIFE this week informed
the magazine's many columnists
across the nation 1o devote this
week's column, the final one we
will write in this series, to America's
national purpose as we see it.
THE REASON. Not totally uncon
nected with the magazine, the re
quest actually coincides with a five
part series which starts in the new
(May 23 I issue of the book.
The ser:-: will pT-ynt the writ
ings of eight distinguished spokes
men, and they will endeavor to artic
ulate the •national purpose as they
see it.
Among the eight are Adlai Stev
enson, Archibald MacLeish, Billy
Graham, David Sarnoff and Walter
Lippmann.
In the coming weeks these men
will discuss whether or not we need
a stated purpose and, if so, what it
should be.
LIFE points out that while these
men will be most articulate on the
topic, we are the ones to be most
vitally affected by its implications.
And LIFE is obviously right.
The picture of today's world is
one in which a discussion of our na
tional purpose has more import than
it would have had a month ago; the
timing is perfect, the topic deserv
ing of the time.
ON THE PURPOSE OF PURPOSE.
One thing is sure, whatever the
stated purpose of any man's feelings
about the national direction was a
while ago, events triggered by one
American "w e a t h e r observation"
plane and the succeeding pronounce
ments by a bald-headed and dra
matic Soviet premier have most likely
changed many feelings.
I have no idea what my fellow
columnists will be writing on the
subject of national purpose this
week. I wonder how many, on such
short notice, and with busy class
schedules to boot, will sit down to
bat out 18 column-inches of news
paper copy on so steep a topic for
the sum forthcoming.
For sure, the columnists will rea
lize they have been challenged like
th,?y have probably never.been jour
nalistically challenged before.
At least they should.
Hopefully they will realize that
you just don't sit down and reel off
pronouncements on the American
national purpose without much fore
thought.
This columnist has been trying all
week to come up with something
worth saying on the topic. Each time

he begins, the thought "Where do
you start?" pops up.
Is it an external or internal pur
pose we need most? Do we start at
home, from our position as a leader
of a large segment of the world's
population, or can we —or should we
—try to do both at once?
Then, off on a cloud, comes the
thought "How many small, less
than-national purposes do we have
to define and proceed to accomplish
before we can get to a real national
one?"
There seems to be so many things
lacking in political, judicial and so
cial aspects of American life that to
turn to international affairs in the
statement of a purpose is almost
comical.
Yet to say this country has a pur
pose which is not international in
its scope is too naive.
Here's a purpose for America
which is so general as to be useless,
but yet it is one which this columnist
feels must be stated.
America—her statesmen and or
dinary citizens alike —should under
take to clean up its own house.
Among others, civil rights, labor,
social and legislative issues often
threaten our internal stability in
this period when threats from ideo
logical international aggressors are
most demanding of our national
energies.
We cannot expect to solve these
internal problems without a great
deal of effort, but it is effort we
should be glad to spend, and it should
be spent in the earnest desire to
solve them for once and for all. And
we should get busy at it.
Americans should begin to think
of their actions and desires in terms
of what they mean to the nation as
a whole. We should not leave to the
lawmakers, the school teachers, and
the executives the task of making
America a great nation.
This handful of men and women,
who are in most cases striving to
contribute to the noble ideals we in
dividually ascribe to the nation, can
not do the task alone. They are much
to small in number.
The national purpose, then, as this
columnist sees it, should take the
form of more than 165 million pur
poses—one for every citizen of the
U.S.A.—and should be simply stated
much in the manner of the follow
ing:
"I wish to live in a great nation,
one which is a leader in the fight
for rights and freedoms and democ
racy. In order that I shall be able to
fulfill my wish, I shall measure each
of my acts in terms of the national
goal and see that none fall short."

population, or can we —or should we
—try to do both at once?
Then, off on a cloud, comes the
thought "How many small, less
than-national purposes do we have
to define and proceed to accomplish
before we can get to a real national
one?"
There seems to be so many things
lacking in political, judicial and so
cial aspects of American life that to
turn to international affairs in the
statement of a purpose is almost
comical.
Yet to say this country has a pur
pose which is not international in
its scope is too naive.
Here's a purpose for America
which is so general as to be useless,
but yet it is one which this columnist
feels must be stated.
America—her statesmen and or
dinary citizens alike —should under
take to clean up its own house.
Among others, civil rights, labor,
social and legislative issues often
threaten our internal stability in
this period when threats from ideo
logical international aggressors are
most demanding of our national
energies.
We cannot expect to solve these
internal problems without a great
deal of effort, but it is effort we
should be glad to spend, and it should
be spent in the earnest desire to
solve them for once and for all. And
we should get busy at it.
Americans should begin to think
of their actions and desires in terms
of what they mean to the nation as
a whole. We should not leave to the
lawmakers, the school teachers, and
the executives the task of making
America a great nation.
This handful of men and women,
who are in most cases striving to
contribute to the noble ideals we in
dividually ascribe to the nation, can
not do the task alone. They are much
to small in number.
The national purpose, then, as this
columnist sees it, should take the
form of more than 165 million pur
poses—one for every citizen of the
U.S.A.—and should be simply stated
much in the manner of the follow
ing:
"I wish to live in a great nation,
one which is a leader in the fight
for rights and freedoms and democ
racy. In order that I shall be able to
fulfill my wish, I shall measure each
of my acts in terms of the national
goal and see that none fall short."


A communique from the editorial
offices of LIFE this week informed
the magazine's many columnists
across the nation 1o devote this
week's column, the final one we
will write in this series, to America's
national purpose as we see it.
THE REASON. Not totally uncon
nected with the magazine, the re
quest actually coincides with a five
part series which starts in the new
(May 23 I issue of the book.
The ser:-: will pT-ynt the writ
ings of eight distinguished spokes
men, and they will endeavor to artic
ulate the •national purpose as they
see it.
Among the eight are Adlai Stev
enson, Archibald MacLeish, Billy
Graham, David Sarnoff and Walter
Lippmann.
In the coming weeks these men
will discuss whether or not we need
a stated purpose and, if so, what it
should be.
LIFE points out that while these
men will be most articulate on the
topic, we are the ones to be most
vitally affected by its implications.
And LIFE is obviously right.
The picture of today's world is
one in which a discussion of our na
tional purpose has more import than
it would have had a month ago; the
timing is perfect, the topic deserv
ing of the time.
ON THE PURPOSE OF PURPOSE.
One thing is sure, whatever the
stated purpose of any man's feelings
about the national direction was a
while ago, events triggered by one
American "w e a t h e r observation"
plane and the succeeding pronounce
ments by a bald-headed and dra
matic Soviet premier have most likely
changed many feelings.
I have no idea what my fellow
columnists will be writing on the
subject of national purpose this
week. I wonder how many, on such
short notice, and with busy class
schedules to boot, will sit down to
bat out 18 column-inches of news
paper copy on so steep a topic for
the sum forthcoming.
For sure, the columnists will rea
lize they have been challenged like
th,?y have probably never.been jour
nalistically challenged before.
At least they should.
Hopefully they will realize that
you just don't sit down and reel off
pronouncements on the American
national purpose without much fore
thought.
This columnist has been trying all
week to come up with something
worth saying on the topic. Each time

he begins, the thought "Where do
you start?" pops up.
Is it an external or internal pur
pose we need most? Do we start at
home, from our position as a leader
of a large segment of the world's
population, or can we —or should we
—try to do both at once?
Then, off on a cloud, comes the
thought "How many small, less

part series which starts in the new
(May 23 I issue of the book.
The ser:-: will pT-ynt the writ
ings of eight distinguished spokes
men, and they will endeavor to artic
ulate the •national purpose as they
see it.
Among the eight are Adlai Stev
enson, Archibald MacLeish, Billy
Graham, David Sarnoff and Walter
Lippmann.
In the coming weeks these men
will discuss whether or not we need
a stated purpose and, if so, what it
should be.
LIFE points out that while these
men will be most articulate on the
topic, we are the ones to be most
vitally affected by its implications.
And LIFE is obviously right.
The picture of today's world is
one in which a discussion of our na
tional purpose has more import than
it would have had a month ago; the
timing is perfect, the topic deserv
ing of the time.
ON THE PURPOSE OF PURPOSE.
One thing is sure, whatever the
stated purpose of any man's feelings
about the national direction was a
while ago, events triggered by one
American "w e a t h e r observation"
plane and the succeeding pronounce
ments by a bald-headed and dra
matic Soviet premier have most likely
changed many feelings.
I have no idea what my fellow
columnists will be writing on the
subject of national purpose this
week. I wonder how many, on such
short notice, and with busy class
schedules to boot, will sit down to
bat out 18 column-inches of news
paper copy on so steep a topic for
the sum forthcoming.
For sure, the columnists will rea
lize they have been challenged like
th,?y have probably never.been jour
nalistically challenged before.
At least they should.
Hopefully they will realize that
you just don't sit down and reel off
pronouncements on the American
national purpose without much fore
thought.
This columnist has been trying all
week to come up with something
worth saying on the topic. Each time

he begins, the thought "Where do
you start?" pops up.
Is it an external or internal pur
pose we need most? Do we start at
home, from our position as a leader
of a large segment of the world's
population, or can we —or should we
—try to do both at once?
Then, off on a cloud, comes the
thought "How many small, less
than-national purposes do we have
to define and proceed to accomplish
before we can get to a real national
one?"
There seems to be so many things
lacking in political, judicial and so
cial aspects of American life that to
turn to international affairs in the
statement of a purpose is almost
comical.
Yet to say this country has a pur
pose which is not international in
its scope is too naive.
Here's a purpose for America
which is so general as to be useless,
but yet it is one which this columnist
feels must be stated.
America—her statesmen and or
dinary citizens alike —should under
take to clean up its own house.
Among others, civil rights, labor,
social and legislative issues often
threaten our internal stability in
this period when threats from ideo
logical international aggressors are
most demanding of our national
energies.
We cannot expect to solve these
internal problems without a great
deal of effort, but it is effort we
should be glad to spend, and it should
be spent in the earnest desire to
solve them for once and for all. And
we should get busy at it.
Americans should begin to think
of their actions and desires in terms
of what they mean to the nation as
a whole. We should not leave to the
lawmakers, the school teachers, and
the executives the task of making
America a great nation.
This handful of men and women,
who are in most cases striving to
contribute to the noble ideals we in
dividually ascribe to the nation, can
not do the task alone. They are much
to small in number.
The national purpose, then, as this
columnist sees it, should take the
form of more than 165 million pur
poses—one for every citizen of the
U.S.A.—and should be simply stated
much in the manner of the follow
ing:
"I wish to live in a great nation,
one which is a leader in the fight
for rights and freedoms and democ
racy. In order that I shall be able to
fulfill my wish, I shall measure each
of my acts in terms of the national
goal and see that none fall short."
