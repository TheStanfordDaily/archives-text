(Editor's Note: The following'
reconstruction of what look place
at San Francisco City Hall on
Friday, May 13, 1 !)(>(>, was com
piled from accounts of eyewit
nesses and participants.)
The difficulties at City Hall
began Thursday morning when
a large group of students gath
ered to protest the hearings of
the House Un-American Activities
Committee.
Most of the space in the hear
ing room itself was taken by
people with white cards which
had been distributed by William
Wheeler, Northern California
assistant to the House commit
tee. People with white cards were
granted priority in being seated,
and the extra room was given
to students and others lined up
outside the chambers.
Some of the large group of stu
dents who did not gain admit
tance proceeded to picket on t lie
sidewalk outside City Hall. The
remainder stayed in the rotunda
by the hearing room and showed
their displeasure with loud sing
ing and chanting.
At one point, the police stated
that approximately 30 students
could be admitted and asked the
group to form an orderly line in
front of the door, which was done.
Then, a door further down the
hallway was opened and 30
people, most of them not students,
were admitted. The main group
waiting outside the other door
immediately began to yell and
chant loudly at this trick.
Police Charged
Shortly after the hearings had
convened in the afternoon, a cor
don of police, without warning,
charged the students who were
singing and trying to push their
way into the room. Meanwhile,
inside the hearings room, violence
broke out when a group of wit
nesses advanced to the front of
the room shouting "Let our
families in . . ."
The committee ordered the
police to eject the witnesses, and
for several minutes chaos pre
vailed. After the room was cleared
of the witnesses and some of the
students who had been admitted,
the rest of the afternoon was un
eventful although students con
tinued to protest outside the door.
Friday morning, the group of
protestors arrived early, and
approximately TO took positions
outside the hearings room. As
had occurred the day before, the
people holding white cards were
granted seating priority. A large
group of students Were once
again picketing outside the build
ing.
Protestors Sang
The protestors outside the
hearing room throughout the
morning sang and yelled loudly;
however, the thick walls and
doors of the room prevented the
noise from disturbing the pro
ceedings. The police told the dem- j
onstrators that the noise was dis
turbing the city courts and that
they would have to be quiet or
be evicted.
The crowd inside the room was
much more orderly than the pre
vious day after several people ]
were evicted for demonstrating. (
Shortly before noon, Sheriff i
Carberry gave the impression to
the crowd waiting for admittance
outside the committee door that
after the noon rece s s people i
would lie let in the room on the I
basis of first come, first served, i
In the afternoon, two lines were !
formed outside two different
doors, and then one door was j
opened, admitting those holding!
white cards, with no explanation
being given for this. The crowd ;
began to shout loudly in protest
of this action, and it was an-1
nounced that there was still room
for five people without white
cards.
Students Displeased
The students outside the room !
continued to show their displcas-1
ure vocally, and the word was
passed around by students to sit
down and not to act aggressively. !
Four or five students outside i
the main group of demonstrators
tried to force their way through
the barricades but were shoved |
back by the police. At no time
did any of the eyewitnesses or
participants interviewed sec a;
policeman hit or knocked down
by anyone in the crowd, although 1
this has been reported to have
occurred by Chief of Police Ca
hill. All the eyewitnesses agreed
that there had been no aggres-j
siveness on the part of the crowd, j
and that, in fact, the greater per

centage of the crowd had been
seated.
During this time no one told
1 the crowd to leave, nor were they
told that force would be used to
! evict them.
Sudden 1 y, fire hoses were
turned on the crowd. The police
have claimed that ample warning
was given that such action would
be used; however, none of the
Stanford or Cal students in the
crowd heard such a statement.
When the hoses proved ineffec
tive to drive the crowd back, they
were turned off, and a wedge of
policemen shoved the demonstra
tors down to the landing at the
top of the stairs, swinging clubs
in the process and hitting several
people on the head.
Five or six students were
trampled by the crowd or held
back by the police. In one case,
four policemen held one person
while a fifth policeman hit him
in the back with a nightstick.
Most of these five or six students
were putting up no resistance to
the police; however, strong-arm
tactics were used to put hand
cuffs on them and lead them
away.
The group which had been
pushed to the landing at the top
of the stairs sat down, still mak
ing noise, although not aggres
sively, and it seemed as if they
would be allowed to remain in
the building. Then the hoses were
turned on again, and several stu
dents stood up linking arms with
their backs to the police in order
to shield the crowd from the force
of the water.
The hoses were again turned
off and police charged the crowd
from the front and also from up
the stairs. They began dragging
students away, forcibly in some
cases; but the students were, for
the most part, resisting passively.
One girl was dragged down the
stairs by her ankles, hitting her
head on each step. Several others
who remained seated were taken
away by this method. Those who
held on to the banister in an at
tempt not to be pushed or dragged
were hit on the hands and arms, as
were those who continued to link
their arms. Several people were
shoved down the stairs by the
charge of the police, and a few
were bleeding either from falling
or from being hit by clubs. Sev
eral students were kicked in the
face and body by police who tried
to make them get up.
Roughly Handled
The students who tried to re
sist the police were handled much
more roughly than those who
acted passively. On the whole,
however, the group realized the
futility of putting up a struggle.
In the process of evicting the
students, eight policemen were
injured, one of them having a
heart attack. The others either
slipped on the wet stairs or were
kicked or otherwise harmed dur
ing the melee. Most of the police
men had only minor injuries.
Four students were reported
injured, one of them seriously;
however, most of the students
who were harmed probably did
not report the injuries, since a
larger number were seen bleed
ing or in pain.
Many of those involved, 63 in
total, were led out of the building
into patrol wagons and arrested
for disturbing the peace, resisting j
arrest, and inciting to riot.
Reporter Arrested
Some of the arrested people had
not been involved in the demon- !
st rations, but were merely watch
ing from the side. The Daily Cali
fornian reporter who was cover- j
ing the demonstrations requested
to be allowed through the barri
cade after the hoses were turned I
on but was pushed into the crowd j
and subsequently arrested. An i
attorney doing business at City
Hall wandered into the area and |
was arresled in the confusion.
The Committee has charged
that the student protests were;
Communist organized; however,:
most of the leaders of the dem-!
onstrations were students, includ
ing Dave Armor, president of the i
Associated Students of the Uni
versity of California.
The hearings proceeded smooth- \
ly Friday after the demonstrators
had been cleared from the build
ing.
On Saturday, City Hall nor
mally closed over the weekend,
was open only to committee mem
bers, witnesses, press, white card
holders, and a few students for'
whom there remained places. A
crowd of about 4000 protestors

| remained outside the building
during the day shouting and
j singing. After the hearings had
ended, there were a few minor
skirmishes as police tried to clear
| the street; but most of the dem-
I onstrators left without trouble.
