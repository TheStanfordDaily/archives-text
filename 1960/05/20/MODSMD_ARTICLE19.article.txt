# Witnesses Reconstruct Friday the Thirteenth
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: The following'
reconstruction of what look place
at San Francisco City Hall on
Friday, May 13, 1 !)(>(>, was com
piled from accounts of eyewit
nesses and participants.)
The difficulties at City Hall
began Thursday morning when
a large group of students gath
ered to protest the hearings of
the House Un-American Activities
Committee.
Most of the space in the hear
ing room itself was taken by
people with white cards which
had been distributed by William
Wheeler, Northern California
assistant to the House commit
tee. People with white cards were
granted priority in being seated,
and the extra room was given
to students and others lined up
outside the chambers.
Some of the large group of stu
dents who did not gain admit
tance proceeded to picket on t lie
sidewalk outside City Hall. The
remainder stayed in the rotunda
by the hearing room and showed
their displeasure with loud sing
ing and chanting.
At one point, the police stated
that approximately 30 students
could be admitted and asked the
group to form an orderly line in
front of the door, which was done.
Then, a door further down the
hallway was opened and 30
people, most of them not students,
were admitted. The main group
waiting outside the other door
immediately began to yell and
chant loudly at this trick.
Police Charged
Shortly after the hearings had
convened in the afternoon, a cor
don of police, without warning,
charged the students who were
singing and trying to push their
way into the room. Meanwhile,
inside the hearings room, violence
broke out when a group of wit
nesses advanced to the front of
the room shouting "Let our
families in . . ."
The committee ordered the
police to eject the witnesses, and
for several minutes chaos pre
vailed. After the room was cleared
of the witnesses and some of the
students who had been admitted,
the rest of the afternoon was un
eventful although students con
tinued to protest outside the door.
Friday morning, the group of
protestors arrived early, and
approximately TO took positions
outside the hearings room. As
had occurred the day before, the
people holding white cards were
granted seating priority. A large
group of students Were once
again picketing outside the build
ing.
Protestors Sang
The protestors outside the
hearing room throughout the
morning sang and yelled loudly;
however, the thick walls and
doors of the room prevented the
noise from disturbing the pro
ceedings. The police told the dem- j
onstrators that the noise was dis
turbing the city courts and that
they would have to be quiet or
be evicted.
The crowd inside the room was
much more orderly than the pre
vious day after several people ]
were evicted for demonstrating. (
Shortly before noon, Sheriff i
Carberry gave the impression to
the crowd waiting for admittance
outside the committee door that
after the noon rece s s people i
would lie let in the room on the I
basis of first come, first served, i
In the afternoon, two lines were !
formed outside two different
doors, and then one door was j
opened, admitting those holding!
white cards, with no explanation
being given for this. The crowd ;
began to shout loudly in protest
of this action, and it was an-1
nounced that there was still room
for five people without white
cards.
Students Displeased
The students outside the room !
continued to show their displcas-1
ure vocally, and the word was
passed around by students to sit
down and not to act aggressively. !
Four or five students outside i
the main group of demonstrators
tried to force their way through
the barricades but were shoved |
back by the police. At no time
did any of the eyewitnesses or
participants interviewed sec a;
policeman hit or knocked down
by anyone in the crowd, although 1
this has been reported to have
occurred by Chief of Police Ca
hill. All the eyewitnesses agreed
that there had been no aggres-j
siveness on the part of the crowd, j
and that, in fact, the greater per

centage of the crowd had been
seated.
During this time no one told
1 the crowd to leave, nor were they
told that force would be used to
! evict them.
Sudden 1 y, fire hoses were
turned on the crowd. The police
have claimed that ample warning
was given that such action would
be used; however, none of the
Stanford or Cal students in the
crowd heard such a statement.
When the hoses proved ineffec
tive to drive the crowd back, they
were turned off, and a wedge of
policemen shoved the demonstra
tors down to the landing at the
top of the stairs, swinging clubs
in the process and hitting several
people on the head.
Five or six students were
trampled by the crowd or held
back by the police. In one case,
four policemen held one person
while a fifth policeman hit him
in the back with a nightstick.
Most of these five or six students
were putting up no resistance to
the police; however, strong-arm
tactics were used to put hand
cuffs on them and lead them
away.
The group which had been
pushed to the landing at the top
of the stairs sat down, still mak
ing noise, although not aggres
sively, and it seemed as if they
would be allowed to remain in
the building. Then the hoses were
turned on again, and several stu
dents stood up linking arms with
their backs to the police in order
to shield the crowd from the force
of the water.
The hoses were again turned
off and police charged the crowd
from the front and also from up
the stairs. They began dragging
students away, forcibly in some
cases; but the students were, for
the most part, resisting passively.
One girl was dragged down the
stairs by her ankles, hitting her
head on each step. Several others
who remained seated were taken
away by this method. Those who
held on to the banister in an at
tempt not to be pushed or dragged
were hit on the hands and arms, as
were those who continued to link
their arms. Several people were
shoved down the stairs by the
charge of the police, and a few
were bleeding either from falling
or from being hit by clubs. Sev
eral students were kicked in the
face and body by police who tried
to make them get up.
Roughly Handled
The students who tried to re
sist the police were handled much
more roughly than those who
acted passively. On the whole,
however, the group realized the
futility of putting up a struggle.
In the process of evicting the
students, eight policemen were
injured, one of them having a
heart attack. The others either
slipped on the wet stairs or were
kicked or otherwise harmed dur
ing the melee. Most of the police
men had only minor injuries.
Four students were reported
injured, one of them seriously;
however, most of the students
who were harmed probably did
not report the injuries, since a
larger number were seen bleed
ing or in pain.
Many of those involved, 63 in
total, were led out of the building
into patrol wagons and arrested
for disturbing the peace, resisting j
arrest, and inciting to riot.
Reporter Arrested
Some of the arrested people had
not been involved in the demon- !
st rations, but were merely watch
ing from the side. The Daily Cali
fornian reporter who was cover- j
ing the demonstrations requested
to be allowed through the barri
cade after the hoses were turned I
on but was pushed into the crowd j
and subsequently arrested. An i
attorney doing business at City
Hall wandered into the area and |
was arresled in the confusion.
The Committee has charged
that the student protests were;
Communist organized; however,:
most of the leaders of the dem-!
onstrations were students, includ
ing Dave Armor, president of the i
Associated Students of the Uni
versity of California.
The hearings proceeded smooth- \
ly Friday after the demonstrators
had been cleared from the build
ing.
On Saturday, City Hall nor
mally closed over the weekend,
was open only to committee mem
bers, witnesses, press, white card
holders, and a few students for'
whom there remained places. A
crowd of about 4000 protestors

| remained outside the building
during the day shouting and
j singing. After the hearings had
ended, there were a few minor
skirmishes as police tried to clear
| the street; but most of the dem-
I onstrators left without trouble.
ress was made toward pinning
down Communist activities in the
San Francisco Bay Area. Some
half dozen witnesses balked at
answering questions, and six per-1
sons had to be forcibly ejected;
from the room."
This positive attitude toward
the Committee and its activities
appeared out of place in a report
which supposedly gave readers
information upon which to base
their opinion of the committee.
The incident when one boy was j
held by three policemen and beat
en with a club by the fourth was
reported by the Los Angeles
Times as:
"A young man, grabbed by four (
policemen, kicked so wildly that
he shattered the glass of a revolv
ing door."
In an unexpectedly tentative!
paragraph the Times said:
"Three of the demonstrators :
had head injuries. They said they
were clubbed."
Perhaps the most uncalled for
information in the Los Angeles
account was the reference to Vin- |
cent Hallinan, an attorney for j
some of the witnesses before the
committee who protested the po
lice's methods for dispersing the
demonstrators:
•I'm a Lawyer'
"I'm a lawyer and I've got a
light to be here," protested Halli
nan. whose list of past clients in
clude longsh o i' e m a n Harry
Bridges. Hallinan recently return
ed to law practice. Several years
ago he completed serving a pris
on term for income tax violation.
"In the 1952 Presidential cam
paign Hallinan ran as the Inde
pendent Progressive Party candi
date."
The story ended with the sen
tence, "The House subcommittee
is headed by Rep. Edwin E. Willis
(D-La)." But the Times failed to
point out that Willis was elected
to his position by some 8,000 votes
in a constituency of 325,000.
The UPI report was repeated in ;
the Washington Post but the Her- |
akl Tribune's phrase, "women col- 1
lege students, and older 'beatnik'
- types," was changed to "college
students and others objecting to
the hearings."
"A general riot call brought 300

to 400 policemen to the scene in
what was described as the worst
rioting here since V-J Day," said
the Post. No source was given for
this judgment and no explanation
was given of the association of
V-J Day and The Battle of City
Hall.
The Post did say that the po
lice first used fire hoses to dis
perse sitting demonstrators, and
that after this failed, "about 50
policemen went down an elevator
and came up the stairs behind the
defiant students."
This latter account was com
pletely eliminated in the Herald
Tribune's version of the story.
As in the Herald' Tribune's UPI
release, the Post claimed accord
ing to Sheriff Carberry a patrol
man was knocked down by the
students and that his name was
Frank Dunphy. This again is in
contradiction to the AP story
which said Ralph Schaumleffel,
ihe doorkeeper, was beaten on
the head with his own club.
Unexpected Objectivity
The most unexpected objectiv
ity was found in the Chicago Tri
bune. Although the Tribune used
the favorite phrase, "(demonstra
tors I battle police," it reported
that many bystanders yelled,
"Leave the kids alone."
The Chicago Tribune also print
ed the comments of Mary Mcin
tosh, a University of California
student from London:
"They (the police) washed us
down the first flight of stairs,
then when we stood there for a,
while they washed us down the
second. Then they started using
the clubs. We didn't have any
clubs.' "
However, the Chicago Tribune
report included the widespread
generalizations about beatnik pro
testers. Attributing the observa
tion to newsmen at the scene,
the Tribune said:
"Some were youths badly in
need of h a i rc u t s, some were
bearded and at least one marcher
was more than 50 years old with
a dirty white cap and rough
working clothes. One was a little
old lady with sneakers and a bel
ligerent expression."
(Garbled Report
The Toronto Globe and Mail
gave a singularly garbled AP re
port to its Canadian readers:
' The ruckus started while Ver
non Bonn, a San Francisco ware
houseman, was refusing to say
if he had been a Communist. A
woman at tlie back of the room
screamed. Then the disturbance
spread."
Boun had testified in the morn
ing session on Friday and was
simply sitting in the hearing
room during the noon recess
when the disturbances began.
The Christian Science Monitor
had no mention of Friday's
trouble at City Hall in their Sat
urday edition. Hearst's Seattle
Post Intelligencer used the more
objective account of the New
York Times news service.
The Atlanta Constitution was
substantially the same as the
Los Angeles Times' AP report
with the addition of:
"There were shouts of: 'Com
mittee go home,' 'Go back to the
South.' "

Protection
Kditor, I lie Daily:
I have always thought* that it
was rather useless for readers to
argue back and forth in the letter
column of the Daily, but I really
must take exception to Mi'. Rolls'
defense of the San Francisco goon
squads in Thursday's Daily.
I was not present, at the "riot,"
but I certainly wish I could have
been. It would have been worth
having my clothes ruined by fire
hoses and maybe even a clout on
the head by some uniformed gor
illa to get a firsthand impression
of what really went on.
When I saw q newspaper photo
graph of two policemen dragging
two slightly-built girls down a
flight of stairs by their ankles, I
absolutely recoiled in disgust. I
wonder how Mr. Rolls would jus
tify this as "duty"?
The girls certainly did not seem
to be trying to injure the gallant
policemen by striking them on
their s turd y helmets. Perhaps
they tried to pierce their leather
jackets with their fingernails.
There was nothing in the photo
graph, however, to imply any
thing but complete passiveness.
I just wonder who is supposed
to protect the public from the
police force.
Ed Senior
Nothing at All
Editor, the Daily:
I vvrite in reference to several
letters appearing in the Daily the
last couple of days, the first being
one written by Mr. Panero.
For some reasons your attack
against our Don Quixote rings
with the same tone of the "gas
Chessman" appeals of a few
weeks ago. Your attacks on Mr.
Quixote were based on the de
fense of an undeserving maiden
in distress.
If Mr. Panero wishes to argue
in this vein, it might be interest
ing to know exactly what Mr. Po
liceman did to deserve said tooth
marks from said damsel. I should
like to think that Mr. Quixote was
not spurned on by the emotional
effects of a maiden in distress but
of a gross human injustice.
The most fortunate of the en
tire incident are certain members
of the San Francisco police de
partment who are lucky enough
to possess employment for their
various services on the side of the
law. I guess 1 should be satisfied
that there were at least some
human beings on one end of the 4
billy club.
It also does my heart good to
•see individuals getting bothered
to the point of action over major
issues and wanting to voice opin
ion in this our society for the pre
vention of false security in the
individual.
Some people cannot find refuge
behind a deluge of propaganda
and lies. Some people cannot ac
cept the "American" religion of
the legionnaires and the D.A.R.
Some people are not satisfied with
the status quo. Some people can
not accept the "we know what's
best for you" attitude, the answer
to the impractical, idealistic col
lege punk.
Let the crime rate, the alcoholic
rate, the Caryl Chcssmans, the
segregation problem, and the sum
mit failure speak for the ultimate
knowledge of our philosopher
kings. Write your Congressman
—this is done. Vote as one man
so inadequately put it. Picket or
voice opinion—No! This is radi
cal or at least with the assistance
of a police department.
I'm afraid my faith in human
ity rests with the Stanford pro
fessor and wife who picketed
lunch counters, the petition car
riers against capital punishment,
and the' Don Quixotes. However. I
am wrong and immature, for all
these people can fall under the
gross titles of leftists, atheists,
and commies; and I still happen
to like being an American.
As for Mr. Rolls, who appears
to he seeking employment for the
Hearst papers, someone should
tell him that Kilgallen's job is
not available. He almost takes
the ridiculousness out of the
statement, "If you do not have
anything good to say, do not say
anything at all."
