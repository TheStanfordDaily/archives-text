# Nation Gets Distorted Report of Riot
## 
### Dave Quarles Associate Editor 
Editor's note: The Saturday,
May 14, editions of the following
newspapers were used in compil
ing this article: The New Vork
Times, The New York Herald Tri
| hune, The Christian Science Mon
itor, The Washington Post, The
Atlanta Constitution, The Chicago
Tribune, The Los Angeles Times
anil the Toronto Globe and Mail.
The greater part of the United
States has and will see the Battle
of City Hall only through the eyes
of the Associated Press and the
United Press International. Pub
j lie opinion and the future of the
House Un-American Activities
Committee are both in the hands
of the national press services.
Considering such far-reaching
1 implications, it would appear ex
tremely important that these serv
' ices present accurate, objective
and complete accounts of the
events at the San Francisco City
Hall, Friday, May 13.
Yet the news stories which ap
peared throughout the countr.y on
I May 14 were generally inaccurate,
subjective and incomplete. More
over, stories attributed to the
same wire service gave complete
ly different views.
The number of possible sources
: of error from the event to the
printed page is admittedly large.
But this fact should not silence
Americans from demanding that
their newspapers be reliable.
• • •
Of all the accounts, the New
I York Times presented t lie most
| objective. The Times clearly stat
| ed that once the hoses were turn
ed on, the students tried to hold
j their ground by sitting down. Yet
at the beginning of the front page
article, the Times claimed that
"students battled the police for
j thirty minutes before yielding to
| swinging clubs and high-pressure
I streams from fire hoses."
This phrase failed ,to catch the
| tenor, as reported to the Daily, of
I the protest. It also implied that

j fighting went on for 30 minutes
j before the hoses were turned on
which was not true.
The New York Times News Ser
; vice, as well as the AP and the
j UPI, reported 12 persons injured
—eight policemen and four stu-
I dents. This bare statement with
out mention of numerous injuries
to many more than four students
was certainly inadequate.
The key point in the whole af
| fair, whether the students were
J warned to move back or not, and
a point which has yet to be estab
lished with any certainty except
according to police reports, was,
in the New York Times, stated as
! fact:
"Murmurs of discontent arose.
Cries of 'first come first served'
went up. The police called for
quiet and ordered the crowd back.
The crowd moved forward. Fire
hoses were unreeled. Demanding
I admittance to the hearing, the
| crowd surged forward and swept
Ralph Schaumleffel, a policeman,
from his feet."
Biased Account
The New York Herald Tribune,
which subscribes to the United
Press International, carried an ex
tremely biased account.
Again the demonstrators "bat
i tied police in City Hall . . . until
I quelled by riot squads with billy
I clubs."
Perhaps the most slanted para
graph in the report was the one
' containing a description of the
1 components of the crowd:
"A general riot call brought 300
to 400 policemen to the wild melee
during which fire hoses were in
ieffective against the dernonstra
! tors who included women college
I students, and older 'beatnik-type
pickets.'"
Such a statement implies that
j a large percentage of the crowd
were not serious students, when
in reality a large majority of the
demonstrators were serious stu
! dents.
j In explaining the disturbance,
| the Tribune reported:
"Sheriff Matthew Carberry said
i the riot broke out when the dem

onstrators, who were trying to get j
into the subcommittee hearing
room, knocked do\yn policeman j
Frank Dunphy, 61, guarding the
door. Mr. Dunphy suffered a pos-;
sible heart seizure."
This account is in direct con- j
tradiction to the Associated Press i
report and the New York Times
write-up, both of which claimed t
that the attack on Policeman
Ralph Schaumleffel was the inci
dent which triggered the violence
on the part of the police.
This particular incident, like
that of the warning, has yet to be ;
firmly established by witnesses
and comes only from police re
ports.
Complete Report
The most complete Associated
Press report was in the Los An
geles Times. In this article "200
jeering demonstrators were dous
ed by fire hoses, scores were ar
rested and 12 persons injured . . .
during an attempt to storm a
hearing of the House Subcommit
tee on Un-American Activities."
The Times' account of the cru
cial question of student provoca
tion was that, "A policeman' who
closed the hearing room door and
announced no more could be ac
commodated was knocked to the
floor and beaten with his own
club."
In one paragraph the newspa
per tended to devaluate the integ
rity of the demonstrators by im
plying that they were all juve
niles:
"The city jail was filled quickly.
Patrol wagons then took full
loads to eight other stations.
Many prisoners were so young

that they had to be transferred
to juvenile hall."
Later on in the story, the Times
referred to "today's demonstra
tion, involving many who appear
ed to be teen-agers."
The statement that "earlier
they (the demonstrators) three
times shouted down appeals by
Sheriff Matt Carberry to maintain
order" again implied a definite
warning to the students by the
police not yet substantiated.
The Times stated that, "Inside

Complete Report
The most complete Associated
Press report was in the Los An
geles Times. In this article "200
jeering demonstrators were dous
ed by fire hoses, scores were ar
rested and 12 persons injured . . .
during an attempt to storm a
hearing of the House Subcommit
tee on Un-American Activities."
The Times' account of the cru
cial question of student provoca
tion was that, "A policeman' who
closed the hearing room door and
announced no more could be ac
commodated was knocked to the
floor and beaten with his own
club."
In one paragraph the newspa
per tended to devaluate the integ
rity of the demonstrators by im
plying that they were all juve
niles:
"The city jail was filled quickly.
Patrol wagons then took full
loads to eight other stations.
Many prisoners were so young

that they had to be transferred
to juvenile hall."
Later on in the story, the Times
referred to "today's demonstra
tion, involving many who appear
ed to be teen-agers."
The statement that "earlier
they (the demonstrators) three
times shouted down appeals by
Sheriff Matt Carberry to maintain
order" again implied a definite
warning to the students by the
police not yet substantiated.
The Times stated that, "Inside

Of all the accounts, the New

| ed that once the hoses were turn
ed on, the students tried to hold
j their ground by sitting down. Yet
at the beginning of the front page
article, the Times claimed that
"students battled the police for
j thirty minutes before yielding to
| swinging clubs and high-pressure
I streams from fire hoses."
This phrase failed ,to catch the
| tenor, as reported to the Daily, of
I the protest. It also implied that

j fighting went on for 30 minutes
j before the hoses were turned on
which was not true.
The New York Times News Ser
; vice, as well as the AP and the
j UPI, reported 12 persons injured
—eight policemen and four stu-
I dents. This bare statement with
out mention of numerous injuries
to many more than four students
was certainly inadequate.
The key point in the whole af
| fair, whether the students were
J warned to move back or not, and
a point which has yet to be estab
lished with any certainty except
according to police reports, was,
in the New York Times, stated as
! fact:
"Murmurs of discontent arose.
Cries of 'first come first served'
went up. The police called for
quiet and ordered the crowd back.
The crowd moved forward. Fire
hoses were unreeled. Demanding
I admittance to the hearing, the
| crowd surged forward and swept
Ralph Schaumleffel, a policeman,
from his feet."
Biased Account
The New York Herald Tribune,
which subscribes to the United
Press International, carried an ex
tremely biased account.
Again the demonstrators "bat
i tied police in City Hall . . . until
I quelled by riot squads with billy
I clubs."
Perhaps the most slanted para
graph in the report was the one
' containing a description of the
1 components of the crowd:
"A general riot call brought 300
to 400 policemen to the wild melee
during which fire hoses were in
ieffective against the dernonstra
! tors who included women college
I students, and older 'beatnik-type
pickets.'"
Such a statement implies that
j a large percentage of the crowd
were not serious students, when
in reality a large majority of the
demonstrators were serious stu
! dents.
j In explaining the disturbance,
| the Tribune reported:
"Sheriff Matthew Carberry said
i the riot broke out when the dem

onstrators, who were trying to get j
into the subcommittee hearing
room, knocked do\yn policeman j
Frank Dunphy, 61, guarding the
door. Mr. Dunphy suffered a pos-;
sible heart seizure."
This account is in direct con- j
tradiction to the Associated Press i
report and the New York Times
write-up, both of which claimed t
that the attack on Policeman
Ralph Schaumleffel was the inci
dent which triggered the violence
on the part of the police.
This particular incident, like

Complete Report

jeering demonstrators were dous
ed by fire hoses, scores were ar
rested and 12 persons injured . . .

hearing of the House Subcommit

The Times' account of the cru
cial question of student provoca
tion was that, "A policeman' who
closed the hearing room door and
announced no more could be ac
commodated was knocked to the
floor and beaten with his own
club."
In one paragraph the newspa
per tended to devaluate the integ

plying that they were all juve
niles:
"The city jail was filled quickly.
Patrol wagons then took full
loads to eight other stations.
Many prisoners were so young

that they had to be transferred
to juvenile hall."
Later on in the story, the Times
referred to "today's demonstra
tion, involving many who appear
ed to be teen-agers."
The statement that "earlier
they (the demonstrators) three
times shouted down appeals by
Sheriff Matt Carberry to maintain
order" again implied a definite
warning to the students by the
police not yet substantiated.
