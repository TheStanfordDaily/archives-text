Fear of Communism
Kditor, the Daily:
In its coverage of the House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities h e a ring s , the Daily
stressed the innocence of those
subpoenaed and the insincerity of
the Committee members. Concen
tration on these criticisms ob
scures the real issues involved.
First, the avowed purpose of
the hearings is to educate people
as to the danger of communism.
Innuendo and propaganda never
educate. The public association of
communism with various groups
creates an unthinking fear of any
vaguely "radical" group. This
causes an apathy toward reform
equally as dangerous as the Com
munist threat.
Second, even if the people ques
tioned are Communists, they have
the right to defend themselves be-'
fore the serious accusation of
"near treason." A» person accused
of conspiring to violently over
throw the government should be
tried by legal procedures, not by
public opinion. This would pre
vent vague or irrelevant charges
from unidentified accusers. Per
sonal rights must be defended
through legal codes. Those for
non-violent met hods of change, be
their goal communism or democ
racy, violate no laws. Hence, they
deserve the full rights of this
country.
Fear of communism has led to
these modes of persuasion which
we desire to resist.

Disarmament
Editor, the Daily:
I write in response if) Mr. Gret
tenberg's request thai those who
know of an alternative to the
arms race come forward and pre
sent it, but I must admit that my
proposal is not an original one.
Senator Humphrey and Secretary
Herter, among olhers, thought of
it first.
My alternative is multilateral
disarmament.
The stock answer to this pro

posal is, "But we can't disarm
because the Russians won't agree
to adequate safeguards." This
viewpoint has a psychological ad
vantage over other possible prior
conclusions in that it protects the
believer from unwanted feelings
of responsibility, but it has little
correspondence to the facts.
The fact is that we have many
reasons to believe thai the Soviet
Union will agree to adequate
safeguards.
Even Dr. Teller has admitted
that adequate inspection is per
fectly p os s i-b 1 e. The principal
issues come up in the context of
negotiation on the number of on
site inspections to be permitted
under conditions of partial dis
armament, i.e. nuclear disarma
ment.
This difficulty is the direct re
sult of the American decision to
reject total disarmament as the
goal of the talks. If there is such
a thing as a Russian passion for
secrecy that will necessarily pre
vent adequate inspection, we have
yet to give them an opportunity
to display it.
But even in the context of just
nuclear disarmament the Russian

proposal of March 19 is a satis
factory one, as such prominent
A m e r i c a n physicists as Hans
' Bethe have pointed out. The prin
cipal features of the Soviet pro
posal of March 19 should l)e ac
cepted.
I do not ascribe altruistic mo
tives to the Russians. But I do
believe that the Russians realize
that disarmament is to their in
terest. (Do not recent events sug
gest that it is also very much to
t.he interests of the Soviet Union
to devise an adequate inspection
system?) For a short and com
prehensive report on this subject
see Senate Subcommittee on Dis
armament Report on Attitudes of
Soviet Leaders Toward Disarm
ament, Staff Study No. 8, June,
: 1957.
American acceptance of disarm
ament will not come easily. After
all, disarmament will very prob
ably result in a depression. Lock
heed, Douglas Aircraft, Bell Lab
oratories, DuPont, General Me
ters et. al. will sustain heavy
losses if they do not go bankrupt.
Millions of us soldiers, sailors,
I airmen, scientists, many of the
workers at SRI, Varian, and Hew-

Lett-Packard will ioin the ranks
of the unemployed.
We must choose in full view
of the undesirable economic con
sequences that peace will have for
our nation and for nearly all of
us personally whether we will
or will not collectively commit
suicide.

posal is, "But we can't disarm
because the Russians won't agree
to adequate safeguards." This
viewpoint has a psychological ad
vantage over other possible prior
conclusions in that it protects the
believer from unwanted feelings
of responsibility, but it has little
correspondence to the facts.
The fact is that we have many
reasons to believe thai the Soviet
Union will agree to adequate
safeguards.
Even Dr. Teller has admitted
that adequate inspection is per
fectly p os s i-b 1 e. The principal
issues come up in the context of
negotiation on the number of on
site inspections to be permitted
under conditions of partial dis
armament, i.e. nuclear disarma
ment.
This difficulty is the direct re
sult of the American decision to
reject total disarmament as the
goal of the talks. If there is such
a thing as a Russian passion for
secrecy that will necessarily pre
vent adequate inspection, we have
yet to give them an opportunity
to display it.
But even in the context of just
nuclear disarmament the Russian

proposal of March 19 is a satis
factory one, as such prominent
A m e r i c a n physicists as Hans
' Bethe have pointed out. The prin
cipal features of the Soviet pro
posal of March 19 should l)e ac
cepted.
I do not ascribe altruistic mo
tives to the Russians. But I do
believe that the Russians realize
that disarmament is to their in
terest. (Do not recent events sug
gest that it is also very much to
t.he interests of the Soviet Union
to devise an adequate inspection
system?) For a short and com
prehensive report on this subject
see Senate Subcommittee on Dis
armament Report on Attitudes of
Soviet Leaders Toward Disarm
ament, Staff Study No. 8, June,

American acceptance of disarm
ament will not come easily. After
all, disarmament will very prob
ably result in a depression. Lock
heed, Douglas Aircraft, Bell Lab
oratories, DuPont, General Me

losses if they do not go bankrupt.

Fear of Communism
Kditor, the Daily:
In its coverage of the House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities h e a ring s , the Daily
stressed the innocence of those
subpoenaed and the insincerity of
the Committee members. Concen
tration on these criticisms ob
scures the real issues involved.
First, the avowed purpose of
the hearings is to educate people
as to the danger of communism.
Innuendo and propaganda never
educate. The public association of
communism with various groups
creates an unthinking fear of any
vaguely "radical" group. This
causes an apathy toward reform
equally as dangerous as the Com
munist threat.
Second, even if the people ques
tioned are Communists, they have
the right to defend themselves be-'
fore the serious accusation of
"near treason." A» person accused
of conspiring to violently over
throw the government should be
tried by legal procedures, not by
public opinion. This would pre
vent vague or irrelevant charges
from unidentified accusers. Per
sonal rights must be defended
through legal codes. Those for
non-violent met hods of change, be
their goal communism or democ
racy, violate no laws. Hence, they
deserve the full rights of this
country.
Fear of communism has led to
these modes of persuasion which

: 1957.
American acceptance of disarm
ament will not come easily. After
all, disarmament will very prob
ably result in a depression. Lock
heed, Douglas Aircraft, Bell Lab
oratories, DuPont, General Me
ters et. al. will sustain heavy
losses if they do not go bankrupt.
Millions of us soldiers, sailors,
I airmen, scientists, many of the
workers at SRI, Varian, and Hew-

Lett-Packard will ioin the ranks
of the unemployed.
We must choose in full view
of the undesirable economic con
sequences that peace will have for
our nation and for nearly all of
us personally whether we will
or will not collectively commit
suicide.

Fear of Communism
Kditor, the Daily:
In its coverage of the House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities h e a ring s , the Daily
stressed the innocence of those
subpoenaed and the insincerity of
the Committee members. Concen
tration on these criticisms ob
scures the real issues involved.
First, the avowed purpose of
the hearings is to educate people
as to the danger of communism.
Innuendo and propaganda never
educate. The public association of
communism with various groups
creates an unthinking fear of any
vaguely "radical" group. This
causes an apathy toward reform
equally as dangerous as the Com
munist threat.
Second, even if the people ques
tioned are Communists, they have
the right to defend themselves be-'
fore the serious accusation of
"near treason." A» person accused
of conspiring to violently over
throw the government should be
tried by legal procedures, not by
public opinion. This would pre
vent vague or irrelevant charges
from unidentified accusers. Per
sonal rights must be defended
through legal codes. Those for
non-violent met hods of change, be
their goal communism or democ
racy, violate no laws. Hence, they
deserve the full rights of this
country.
Fear of communism has led to
these modes of persuasion which
we desire to resist.

Disarmament
Editor, the Daily:
I write in response if) Mr. Gret
tenberg's request thai those who
know of an alternative to the
arms race come forward and pre
sent it, but I must admit that my
proposal is not an original one.
Senator Humphrey and Secretary
Herter, among olhers, thought of
it first.
My alternative is multilateral
disarmament.
The stock answer to this pro

posal is, "But we can't disarm
because the Russians won't agree
to adequate safeguards." This
viewpoint has a psychological ad
vantage over other possible prior
conclusions in that it protects the
believer from unwanted feelings
of responsibility, but it has little
correspondence to the facts.
The fact is that we have many
reasons to believe thai the Soviet
Union will agree to adequate
safeguards.
Even Dr. Teller has admitted
that adequate inspection is per
fectly p os s i-b 1 e. The principal
issues come up in the context of
negotiation on the number of on
site inspections to be permitted
under conditions of partial dis
armament, i.e. nuclear disarma
ment.
This difficulty is the direct re
sult of the American decision to
reject total disarmament as the
goal of the talks. If there is such
a thing as a Russian passion for
secrecy that will necessarily pre
vent adequate inspection, we have
yet to give them an opportunity
to display it.
But even in the context of just
nuclear disarmament the Russian

proposal of March 19 is a satis
factory one, as such prominent
A m e r i c a n physicists as Hans
' Bethe have pointed out. The prin
cipal features of the Soviet pro
posal of March 19 should l)e ac
cepted.
I do not ascribe altruistic mo
tives to the Russians. But I do
believe that the Russians realize
that disarmament is to their in
terest. (Do not recent events sug
gest that it is also very much to
t.he interests of the Soviet Union
to devise an adequate inspection
system?) For a short and com
prehensive report on this subject
see Senate Subcommittee on Dis
armament Report on Attitudes of
Soviet Leaders Toward Disarm
ament, Staff Study No. 8, June,
: 1957.
American acceptance of disarm
ament will not come easily. After

ably result in a depression. Lock
