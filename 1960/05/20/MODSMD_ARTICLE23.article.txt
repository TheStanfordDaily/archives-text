# HOME COURSE ADVANTAGE
## Tribe Hosts AAWU Golf 
### Pete James 
The Stanford golfers open a
two-day display of what (hey hope
will he poor hospitality as play
begins in the AAWU Champion
ships with the Card divoters as
hosts. The event is a grueling 72-
hole affair, with two rounds
played each day. There will be
prizes for th£ low individuals as
well as the low team and runner
up.
Although the Indians have lost
to both USC and UCLA, their
undefeated home season places
them with the Trojans as co
l'avorites. Both of these teams
have only three losses against
them, while compiling an impres
sive list of victories.
In their first meeting the Cards
fell, 4.3-11 • This, however, was
played on USC's home course, and
against a Stanford team whose
lowest score was 75. Last week
against Cal the highest round
shot by a Card was 74, and there
was a 70. 71 and 73 also turned in.
The individual title is up for
grabs, and many capable hands
are reaching. Two years ago,
Allen Geiburger of USC, now
turned professional officially, won
the PCC title here with a score
of 288, four over par.
The winning score litis year
will probably be over 290, a score
which many of the top golfers in
the conference have beaten. The

higher score will be because the
'Stanford course is friendly only
to those who know it. Only one
visiting golfer has broken par in
varsity competition this year, and
that was former NCAA champion
Phil Rodgers, now playing for the
San Diego Marines.
Among the Tribe swingers are
three who have finished under
the magic figure. Both Kent Win
ton and Bill Farrish have had
67's, and Ron Preston has shot

70. They do not stand alone, but
have to watch for Pete Choate,
who shot 69 against UCLA and
70 in the Cal match, and Steve
Smith, 73 and 71, respectively.
Despite lack of local knowledge,
the names of Gerald Zar, Larry
Carr and John Nichols of USC,
Bill Moore and Jerry Kestenberg
of UCLA, Bob Holt of Cal and
Washington basketballer Clint
Names should appear high on
the list of finishers.

played on USC's home course, and
against a Stanford team whose
lowest score was 75. Last week
against Cal the highest round
shot by a Card was 74, and there
was a 70. 71 and 73 also turned in.
The individual title is up for
grabs, and many capable hands
are reaching. Two years ago,
Allen Geiburger of USC, now
turned professional officially, won
the PCC title here with a score
of 288, four over par.
The winning score litis year
will probably be over 290, a score
which many of the top golfers in
the conference have beaten. The

higher score will be because the
'Stanford course is friendly only
to those who know it. Only one
visiting golfer has broken par in
varsity competition this year, and
that was former NCAA champion
Phil Rodgers, now playing for the
San Diego Marines.
Among the Tribe swingers are
three who have finished under
the magic figure. Both Kent Win
ton and Bill Farrish have had
67's, and Ron Preston has shot

70. They do not stand alone, but
have to watch for Pete Choate,
who shot 69 against UCLA and
70 in the Cal match, and Steve
Smith, 73 and 71, respectively.
Despite lack of local knowledge,
the names of Gerald Zar, Larry
Carr and John Nichols of USC,
Bill Moore and Jerry Kestenberg
of UCLA, Bob Holt of Cal and
Washington basketballer Clint
Names should appear high on
the list of finishers.

The Stanford golfers open a
two-day display of what (hey hope
will he poor hospitality as play
begins in the AAWU Champion
ships with the Card divoters as
hosts. The event is a grueling 72-
hole affair, with two rounds
played each day. There will be
prizes for th£ low individuals as
well as the low team and runner
up.
Although the Indians have lost
to both USC and UCLA, their
undefeated home season places
them with the Trojans as co
l'avorites. Both of these teams
have only three losses against
them, while compiling an impres
sive list of victories.
In their first meeting the Cards
fell, 4.3-11 • This, however, was
