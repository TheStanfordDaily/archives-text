# Lloyd Still Question Mark For Relay Record Attempt
## 
### Dick Harries 
A question mark still hangs over the head, or rather ihe log, of
two-mile relay man Norm Lloyd.
Whether Stanford's second-best half miler can join in an assault
at the world two-mile relay record at. tonight's Coliseum Relays in
Los Angeles won't be known until noon today.

Lloyd strained a lower leg
muscle at Fresno last week, and
has been undergoing training
quarters treatment all week.
Trainer Connie Jarvis said yes
terday that Lloyd had a "better
than 50-50 chance" of boarding
a noon plane for the race.
He'll join Ernie Cunliffe, Dick
Lassen and Rich Klier in an
attempt to better California's
world standard of 7:20.9. Chief
opposition is expected to come
from Illinois. Michigan, the Ohio
Relays -champ, was invited but
is on tho doubtful list.
No Mile Team
Even if he runs the 880, Lloyd
has been advised to stay out of
a leg on the mile relay team.
As a result, the Indians are not
expected to go against the loaded
field in that event.
Shot-putter Jerry Winters gets
a chance to place high in a big
meet, with three of the four "Big
Four" in various states of disre
pair. Dallas Long has shoulder
trouble, Bill Neider has a muscle
spasm, and Parry O'Brien has
sinusitis. Only Dave Davis seems
hale and hearty.
John Kelly will go in the broad
jump and hop-step-jump. Ho was
back in his old form at Fresno
with every jump over 24 feet.
In the triple jump, however, he

has yet to approach his 49-plus
leap of last year.
Highlight of the meet will be
the 1960 American debut of Aus
tralian miler and Olympic 1500
meter favorite Herb Elliott. He'll
try to improve his American mile
record of 3:."57.8, and will be prep
ping for his race against Dyrol
Burleson next week at Modesto.
Norton Out
Ray Norton is (Hit of the 100
due to a cold, weight loss and
had teeth. But Bobby Morrow and
Dave Sime will have a go at tho
rest of the best western dashmen,
including Bobby Poynter and
Doug Smith.
San Jose will find it has to do
some decent baton-passing in the
sprint relays if it is to fend off
outstanding teams from Abilene
Christian, Baylor. Northeast
Texas State and USC.
