The Indians took the good with
the bad when they found out at
the same time that Mike Magee
would be able to play despite an
ankle injury. The spunky second
baseman was injured in the Santa
Clara doubleheader last weekend
I and has missed the last two
games.
Rich Ferrazzano will probably
. be called on to fill in for Lawrence
'in right field. Ferrazzano has
played there in the last two games
when Lawrence was moved onto
•second base for Magee.
This afternoon coach Dutch
Fehring will call on lefty Marv
iMecklenberg to f 'aee the hard-hit
ting Trojans. Mecklenberg's last
j appearance was one of the high
spots in the 1960 season as he won
j both ends of the doubleheader
from Santa Clara.
Smith Tomorrow
Sophomore Jim Smith, who
holds the only Stanford victory
over the Trojans this year, will go
j tomorrow.
The Trojans are expected to

CIBA's leading pitcher with a 0-0
mark. The other is ques
tionable.
L Stanford starting lineup will in
clude Jim Cowart at first, Magee
lat second, Mike Filice at short
and Jim Burk at third. The out
field combination will be John
Hurlbut in left, Hal Schutzmann
in center and Ferrazzano in right,
j Jay Winter will be behind the
