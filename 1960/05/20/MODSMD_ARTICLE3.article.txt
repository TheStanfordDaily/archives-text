# NEXT FALL
## Boarding, Room Rates To Increase 
### 
Effective next fall, room and
board rales will increase by $20
a quarter, according to an an
nouncement made yesterday by
the Board of Trustees.
This breaks down into a $5
quarterly raise in board rates,
and a $15 quarterly raise in room
rates in most University resi
dences. Dormitory facilities at
Stanford Village will increase by
$5 a quarter, and room rates for
married students at Escondido
Village and Stanford Village will
remain the same.
$00 Increase
This means that the total board
and room rate for the academic
year will increase from $855 to
$915.
During last quarter's Stanford
Today and Tomorrow talks, it was
predicted that both room and
board and tuition would undergo
an increase to become effective in
September 1961.
In commenting on the raise.
University Housing Director John
Forsberg said that the Univer
sity's housing plans are at present
operating in a deficit and that the
increase "more nearly reflects the
cost of maintaining the dormito
ries."
SI ill a Deficit
This raise would not make up
the deficit, he said, but it would
help.
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler said that the "deficit
for this year in maintaining dor
mitories is proving larger than
we anticipated. Making this raise
active as of next fall will mean
that there will not bo a raise in
board and room as of fall, 1961,
when tuition will probably go up."
