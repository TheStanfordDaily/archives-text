# New Era For U.S. --Canham
## 
### Mavnard Parker 
Concluding his final lecture
yesterday afternoon in Memorial
Auditorium, Erwin D. Canham,
editor of the Christian Science
Monitor, prophesied that the
United States is "moving into a
new, dynamic period . . . one
which will see set in motion
forces of adaption and change."
Canham then named his eight
"central issues of our times"
which he believes Americans
must meet in the 60's:
• "Awaken the need for a
stronger, more dedicated society
based on sounder national and
individual and human values."
Canham believes this can be done
by a general education of the
entire American people.
Work Harder
• The United States, Canham
said, must work harder at dis
armament. "We do this," he said,
by realizing now that genuine
disarmament negotiations have
really begun—that we still have
to prepare a concrete disarma
ment program."
• Americans must pursue new
and old contacts with the Soviel
Union in the hope that we will
not only learn more about them,
but that they will learn more
about us.
• Build a constructive policy
toward Communist China, which
Canham believes will be a greal
force in the 60's. At the present
time, Canham said, we have no
policy toward China.
Create Jobs
• Create more jobs in the mid
-1960's for the population explo
sion which will occur as a result
of the baby boom of the depres
sion. Canham foresees a need for
25,000 new'jobs a day.
• "Stabilize the dollar, control
inflation and bring costs into a
balance so that we can retain an
export market and avoid moun
tainous tariffs . . . thus ruining
world trade." Canham also called
on the U.S. to conceive a broader
Western-Europe and Atlantic
economy by helping the Euro
pean Common Market and the
Outer Seven.
Tax System
• "Achieve a tax system which
will not only provide jobs but
will create and support the im
proved facilities we require:
schools and cities." He looks on
urbanism and education as two
of the greatest challenges in the
coming decade.
• Help American agriculture
"get off the hook" of costly sur
pluses by adjusting to the new
technological changes while keep
ing the agrarian values of the
colonial days.
Since the next administration
will be faced with these goals,
Canham predicts that the new
administration will "face grave
dangers, but it will have the op
portunity of contributing to the
making of a new America and a
new world."
President Eisenhower recently
appointed Canham to his National
Goals Commission to "identify
the great issues of our genera
tion."
Canham's talks conclude this
year's Harry Camp Memorial
Lot-) ures.

Work Harder
• The United States, Canham
said, must work harder at dis
armament. "We do this," he said,
by realizing now that genuine
disarmament negotiations have
really begun—that we still have
to prepare a concrete disarma
ment program."
• Americans must pursue new
and old contacts with the Soviel
Union in the hope that we will
not only learn more about them,
but that they will learn more
about us.
• Build a constructive policy
toward Communist China, which
Canham believes will be a greal
force in the 60's. At the present
time, Canham said, we have no
policy toward China.
Create Jobs
• Create more jobs in the mid
-1960's for the population explo
sion which will occur as a result
of the baby boom of the depres
sion. Canham foresees a need for
25,000 new'jobs a day.
• "Stabilize the dollar, control
inflation and bring costs into a
balance so that we can retain an
export market and avoid moun
tainous tariffs . . . thus ruining
world trade." Canham also called
on the U.S. to conceive a broader
Western-Europe and Atlantic
economy by helping the Euro
pean Common Market and the
Outer Seven.
Tax System
• "Achieve a tax system which
will not only provide jobs but
will create and support the im
proved facilities we require:
schools and cities." He looks on
urbanism and education as two
of the greatest challenges in the
coming decade.
• Help American agriculture
"get off the hook" of costly sur
pluses by adjusting to the new
technological changes while keep
ing the agrarian values of the
colonial days.
Since the next administration
will be faced with these goals,
Canham predicts that the new
administration will "face grave
dangers, but it will have the op
portunity of contributing to the
making of a new America and a
new world."
President Eisenhower recently
appointed Canham to his National
Goals Commission to "identify
the great issues of our genera
tion."
Canham's talks conclude this
year's Harry Camp Memorial
Lot-) ures.
Concluding his final lecture
yesterday afternoon in Memorial
Auditorium, Erwin D. Canham,
editor of the Christian Science
Monitor, prophesied that the
United States is "moving into a
new, dynamic period . . . one
which will see set in motion
forces of adaption and change."
Canham then named his eight
"central issues of our times"
which he believes Americans
must meet in the 60's:
• "Awaken the need for a
stronger, more dedicated society
based on sounder national and
individual and human values."
Canham believes this can be done
by a general education of the
entire American people.
