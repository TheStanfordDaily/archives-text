# Nikita Calls for Summit; Ike Thronged in Portugal
## Khrushchev Accuses U.S. 
### 
j BERLIN (/P) Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev arrived from
! Paris in worried, divided Berlin
j yesterday and spoke soothingly
i about another summit conference
in six to eight months.
"It is clear," said the solemn
Soviet Premier, "that the Soviet
Union and other freedom-loving
countries must analyze the con
sequences, but we do not renounce
our policy of seeking a relaxation
|of tension and of peaceful coex
istence."
Bui once more he accused the
United States of wrecking the
1 summit conference.
Communist Greeting'
He arrived at the airport, out
side East Berlin, and was greeted
by top East German Communists
and about 1,300 party function
aries. Then he rode into East
Berlin past crowds of cheering
| thousands. West Berliners said it
was the biggest reception he ever
I received in East Berlin.
Clouds were threatening, but
the rain held off.
"In this situation," Khrushchev
isaid mildly, in an airport speech.
' time is required, the effort of
all peoples and governments is
required to carry out a summit
conference after six or eight
months."
Tired-Looking
The tired-looking bespectacled
man with his fringe of white hair
, read his speech in a dull, routine
. tone. The German translator who
i towered over him put a lot more
, emotion into his version.
Accusing the United States of
torpedoing the summit confer
ence, Khrushchev declared: "Ob
viously, in determining policy in
the United States those circles
have won the upper hand which
.want no reduction of international
. tensions and no removal of the
danger of a new war."
No Apology
But in speaking of a new sum
! Mit conference after the U.S. elec
tion, he did not say anything
about again demanding an apolo-
Igy from the United States for
the spy flight over the Soviet
I Union.
This demand sent t lie summit
meeting onto the rocks. He did
i not even mention the "obstacles"
i which he said, before leaving
Paris, must be removed before
j another top-level meeting could
I bo held.
No New Threats
Nor did he make any new
j threats against West Berlin,
whose border is only aboul three
miles from where he spoke. He
mentioned it only once, as a prob
lem that has to be settled within
1 the framework of a treaty with
, Germany.
He did say there was a new
situation now. The Soviet govern-
I ment, he went on, would discuss
iit with the other Communist
countries and draw the necessary
j conclusions.
This may have been an allusion
to Red China, which some West
erners believe may have played
a major role in collapsing the
' summit conference.
