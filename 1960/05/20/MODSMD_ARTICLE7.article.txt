PARIS (/P) -Western statesmen quit the scene of the fantastic
summit parley yesterday virtually convinced that a crisis in the
Kremlin forced Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to blow up the
talks.
First assessment of their experts suggested further that the Soviet

Premier's performance in Paris J
was dictated bt a light for politi- j
cal survival.
The governments led by Presi- j
dent Eisenhower, French Presi- !
dent Charles de Gaulle and British
Prime Minister Harold Macmillan :
also seemed to share the view thai
Soviet leaders have not yet de- I
cided irrevocably whether to bury j
or keep alive the policy of relax- |
ing East-West tensions.
Leaders Agreed
As a result the Western leaders
have agreed on a policy of wait 1
and see.
According to information from ;
the highest authorities, this prob- j
ably will mean that for their part
the Allies will do nothing to make
an East-West accommodation im
possible. i
They intend to insure that their
guard is raised, their defenses are ,
ready and their plans up-dated to
meet any emergency that might
arise in Berlin or elsewhere.
A quick show of Western so
lidarity came from the Council of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organ
ization. After hearing the three
Western foreign ministers report
on the summit debacle, the 15-
nation council in special session
unanimously supported the West
ern position.
Paid Tribute
A NATO spokesman said the
delegates "paid tribute to the
spirit of conciliation of the three
Western chiefs of government and
the calm and dignity they show
ed." They expressed regret that j
Khrushchev's position "made the !
negotiations in Paris impossible." j
The council also approved the
foreign ministers' readiness to
continue to seek a solution of |
world problems by "peaceful
means through negotiation," the
spokesman added.
Winds Blowing'
With the cold war winds blow- :
ing at full blast again, the council ;
also took up the question of tight
ening the Atlantic defenses, the I
spokesman said.
"You can take it our defenses I
are being looked after," he said.
In assaying the quick change in I
Khrushchev's tactjcs, Western au- !
thorities noted that in the week ;
beginning May 8 two distinct dei
velopments took place.
In Washington on May 9 and 11, j
Secretary of State Christian A. '
Herter and then the President j
himself, admitted knowledge and
responsibility for the U2 spy i
flight over the Soviet Union and '
indicated they were not being j
halted.
An American spokesman said j
Herter told the NATO councilj
yesterday the U2 flights had been 1
going on for four years and pro
duced information of value to the j
West.
Extraordinary Session
In Moscow about the same time,
Communist party and Red army
heads met in extraordinary ses- !
sion for three or four days before !
Khrushchev's departure for Paris.,
This evidently was the setting for
the internal crisis that produced
a return to the toughness of the
cold war.
Western officials said they had
no doubt the Herter and Eisen-.
howcr statements in Washington â– 
helped to recast the Soviet atti- j
tude toward the summit.
