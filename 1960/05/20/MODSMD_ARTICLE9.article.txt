## Russ Troops Unreliable 
### Elna Rodenhouse Staff Editor 
The reason for bringing in
Russian troops during the Hun
garian Revolution in 1956 was
that Russian troops stationed in
Budapest were not reliable, stated
Richard Selby, in a talk last night
at Jordan House.
This point was explained fur
ther by Miklos Tottossy, a Stan
ford student from Hungary, who
pointed out that the Russians sta
tioned in Budapest prior to the
revolution had grown to like the
people, and that Communist lead
ers felt that these troops were
not doing as good a job in put
tin u down the revolution as would
troops who didn't know the
people.
In addition, Tottossy pointed
out, the troops sent in Were ill
trained in geography, had been
told they were to fight the Ameri
cans, French and British in the
Suez and hence believed they
were in the Suez region, regard
less of what was told them.
Selby, who was second secre
tary to the United States legation
in Budapest from the end of the
revolution in 1956 until 1958, said
that the reason for the revolution
was the "quiet opposition" of stu
dents and writers to the pro-com
munist government of Hungary.
This opposition, he said, came
into the open with Russian Pre
mier Khrushchev's denunciation
of Stalin. The students in Buda
pest began peaceful demonstra
tions against the communists in
Hungary. This grew into' fighting
when the secret police were or
dered to fight the students.
Selby, during his talk, played
a tape recording of the sounds
of the battle. The recording was
made by a French diplomat from
a window above a street where
fighting was going on. It included
recordings of music and an
nouncements which came over
the radio, which told of tlie prog
ress of the revolution.
When the secret police could
not stop tlie students, the gov
ernment took "confused" action,
and asked for military protection.
"Nobody knows," Selby comment
ed. "who ordered Ihem (the Rus
sian troopsi to come."
