cars love SHELL
Why do so many of the liveliest cars on the road use Super Shell with TCP? One clue is
that Shell is America's largest supplier of commercial aviation fuels (we have been for
10 years). And many of Shell's aviation developments have been carried over into Shell
gasolines. TCP*additive is just one of these developments. TCP in Super Shell neutralizes
the combustion deposits which make engines run rough. Why not discover how smooth
your car can run-how far you can go on a gallon? Your Shell dealer is the man to see.
