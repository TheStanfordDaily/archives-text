## Fate of Downed Plane Unknown 
### 
BERLIN </P) The Russians took their time yesterday deciding
whether to make a major incident of the latest American plane
forced down on Communist territory.
More than 48 hours after a lumbering old C-47 landed nine Ameri
cans just inside East Germany, it was not yet clear whether Moscow

would handle the matter, or. in
keeping with past practice, turn
it over to the Communist East
German regime.
A Communist East German
press spokesman. Kurt Blecha, de
clined to say if he considered the
plane an East German or a Soviet
responsibility. The only informa
tion he would give reporters was:
"You don't have to worry about
the crew. They're all right."
Blecha would not say if the
Americans were actually in So
viet or East German hands.
The unarmed, twin-engine U.S.
Air Force transport was on a
flight from Copenhagen, Den
mark, to Hamburg, West Ger
many. Friday noon with a woman !
among its four passengers when
it vanished. Its normal course
took it close to the Ea-st German
border.
Forced Down
The Russians announced they 1
forced it down near the village of
Grundshagen, less than 20 miles
from West Germany, and arrested I
those aboard. U.S. Air Force
sources lacked detailed informa
tion about just what happened -
and the Russians, did not help!
much.
One Air Force source saw no j
reason to doubt that Soviet jets
forced the plane to land with j
warning shots. He immediately j
adfled. however, that the Soviet j
planes usually do not get that j
close to the Iron Curtain border ;
and there was no radio message j
from the C-47 that it was under '
fire.
"But it's possible there was a j
situation which developed so sud- 1
denly that there was no time for,
a message," he added.
Medical Care
The Russians reported all nine 1
occupants of the plane were in
good shape. If they were not, they
had American medical care at
hand.
One of the passengers, Capt. ;
Paul K. McCash, 2."5, of Atlanta,
Ga.. is an Air Force doctor. His i
24-year-old wife the woman pas-!
senger is a nurse. Based at
Wheelus Field in Libya, North 1
Africa, they were on a European ;
vacation.
Soviet military authorities re-j
plied promptly to the first Ameri-'
can inquiry about the plane. This ;
was a surprise.
But .Gen. Clyde D. Eddleman,
U.S. Army commander in Europe,
still awaits a response from Gen.
I. I. Yakubovsky, commander of I
Soviet forces in East Germany, to
his request for immediate release '
of the Americans and the plane.
A second surprise: The Soviet
army commander did not immedi
ately say that the matter was one j
for the "German Democratic Re
public." Such a contention usually
is advanced to emphasize a claim
that the East German satellite is !
a fully sovereign state. The West-1
ern powers consider it a puppet
and refuse to recognize it.
