UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (A 3 ) —The president of the U.N. Security
Council was reported yesterday to be working on a proposal to pre
vent unauthorized flights "by one power over the territory of an
other."
A press officer of the Ceylon delegation made that disclosure as

Sir Claude Corea of Ceylon, head
of the 11-nation Council this
month conferred with U.S. Dele
gate Henry Cabot Lodge and ar
ranged to see Soviet Foreign Min
ister Andrei A. Gromyko today.
The Council will meet today to
take up a Soviet complaint against
U.S. reconnaissance flights over
Soviet territory. Delegates ex-j
pected a Soviet resolution at that
time calling for cessation of such
flights.
Corea's Activities
The Ceylonese press officer,
questioned on Corea's activities,
told a reporter: "Discussions with
the nonpermanent members and
others have been going on to de
vise a positive formula that can I
be presented at the Security Coun- j
oil meeting, especially regarding]
the future prevention of unauth
orized flights by one power over
the territory of another.
"There has been close touch
with the Soviet and the U.S. mis
sions up to now."
There was no comment from
either of those two missions.
The expectation was that a So
viet resolution would be put in
today and that another from other
delegations might go in tomor
row.
Discounted
The press offices discounted
diplomatic reports that Corea was
suggesting that Lodge state to the
Council that spy flights were not
U.S. government policy.
He said it. was "very possible"
that any formula for Ihe Council
would refer to Ihe failure of the
summit conference, but he added
the emphasis would be on the pre
vention of overflights.
Some informants had spoken of
the possibility of the Council call- >
ing for revival of the Big Four ,
summit meeting.
Diplomatic sources said somei
of the six nonpermanent members 1
of the Council were talking about I
putting forward a resolution on
last week's wrecked summit con
ference. They said any such reso
lution probably would deplore the
failure and the causes for the fail- j
ure and then call for early efforts
to set up another.
No Decision
Delegates connected with the :
Council, however, said there had
been no decision yet to present
any resolution other than the one j
the Soviet Union has promised.
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
A. Gromyko is expected to sub
mit the Soviet resolution when the
Council meets this afternoon. In
an explanatory memorandum, he
has demanded that the Council j
condemn U.S. flights over other
countries and call for their cessa- j
lion.
