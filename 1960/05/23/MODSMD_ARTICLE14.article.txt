# Disorganization
## 
### 
As more information is available to tlx' public about the riot
of Friday the 13th. it becomes apparent that I Ik* oh I \ real fault
of the students involved was, disorganization.
If they had had the foresight to ask for ground rules from
the Mayor before the hearings began, the Bay Area students who
participated would not have been subject to so much misrepre
sentation in the national and local press.
There still remain, however, a few questions as to the prep
aration and organization on the part of city officials:
1. The constitutionalitv of the House Un-American Activities
Committee has been called into question by main people through
out the nation. It has aroused intense emotions on both sides
wherever it has held hearings.
\\ by, then, did Mayor Christopher allow a controversial Com
mittee of the federal government to appear in a city building,
thereby taking on himself the responsibility of maintaining order,
a responsibility which logically belonged to the federal govern
ment.
2. The Committee failed to appear in California last year
because of strongly adverse public opinion. Could not Mayor
Christopher have foreseen trouble and prevented it by establish
ing ground rules for picketing before the hearings started?
3. If the cit\ was responsible for maintaining order and guard
ing the entrance to the committee room, win were city officials,
in particular Sheriff Carberrv, not completely informed and artic
ulate about the "while cards tin* real point of Iriction between
the students and the police'
4. Why was Sheriff' Carberrv at tin* hearings at all when he,
as Sheriff of San Francisco County, had no jurisdiction over the
Â« itv police who were guarding (.it\ Mall and who were letting
people in with "white cards ?
If the police guarding Citv Hall were under the direction
of Police Chief Cahill, why did he not speak with the students
Fridav morning ami explain hi> position with regard to the "white
cards'"?
I ntil these questions and that of the degree of student provo
cation have been answered, we must fail to agree with the Mayor
that this is a "closed case.
