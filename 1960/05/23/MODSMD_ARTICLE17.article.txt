Mature Desire
Editor, (lie Daily:
I was disgusted to read in Sun
day's Chronicle the article com
menting on the recent increase of
interest in current affairs shown
by California students.
What kind of attitude must mo
tivate the American public imme
diately to suspect any intelligent
interest and enthusiasm of being
Communist-inspired? The press
has recently been much to blame
for this condescension. They have
insisted on dismissing student
demonstrations on ihe assumption
that they are lerl by mere beatniks
and radicals who are obviously
dupes of Communist plotters.
That the student demonstra
tions are "left of center" is indeed
true, if the center is the compla
cency evidenced by the one smug
university official quoted in the
article:
"We must remember that Ihe
tendency is to become more con
servative with age ... If they're
a bit wild now, I think they'll set
tle down."
It is heartening to note that
such patronizng officials as the
one quoted above have not suc
ceeded in attributing to Commu
nists Stanford students' most re
cent triumphs of intelligent in
quiry and initiative: the Hoover
Institution expose and the Draft
Stevenson Petiton.
Let us hope that the recent dem
onstrations, caused by a mature
desire to learn the truth about po
litical events will continue, un
hampered by any American Le
gion ideas of the American's duty
to settle down and maintain the
status quo.
Betty Kantor
Little Round Man
Editor, the Daily:
While reading last Monday's
Daily, I had to assure myself that
it, indeed, was the Daily, by re
ferring to the heading on page
one which says,"The Stanford
Daily." That issue would certainly
do justice to a Communist organ:
e.g. "The Daily Worker."
If ever I have read pro-Commu
nist, and Anti-American reporting
and editorializing, that was it. It
was, without doubt, the most dis
gusting. and distasteful publica
tion I have read here.
We are Americans, dedicated to
the freedom of the individual, and
to our country. But, I begin to
wonder, and seriously. I am sure,
however, that the majority of
student demonstrators, along with
our editor and his cohorts, are
not pro-communist, but genuine in
their concern for individual free
dom. What transpired in San
Francisco last weekend, proves
how succesful these Communist
conspirators can be in advancing
their propaganda campaign.
The minds of these demonstra
tors have been duped into the
Communist line of thought. What
could be more successful to the
Communist movement in this
country, that to have abolished a
congressional committee estab
lished for the purpose of exposing
Communist activity?
Any American who rightfully
calls himself an American, should
take pride in being asked to di
vulge any information which may
help to curtail this activity. The
Communist conpiracy is a serious
one. Communism should be recog
nized for what it is an ugly ogre
haunting the face of the globe,
and no amount of effort should
be spared in the fight for its total
and utter destruction.
The realization that it is not

merely a harmless ideology and
political theory, as many of our
writers, commentators, and col
lege professors would have us be
lieve, would be a giant step step
in this fight. Communism must
be obliterated.
And while the House Un-Ameri
can .Activties Committee itself,
certainly won't obliterate it, ii
seeks to expose its activities, and
it is while thus exposed that they
are rendered less dangerous. One
of the most effective means of
hindering subversive progress is
to publicize it. -
I sincerely urge all those taking
part in last weekend's irresponsi
ble demonstration, to do a little
responsible thinking for a change.
How on God's earth can "intelli
gent" students believe 1 hat these
destroyers of freedom should be
protected under the rights of a
constitution, the very destruction
of which is their goal. What man
ner of logic is this?
Such enemies must necessarily
forfeit all such rights. They
should be stripped of their Ameri
can citizenship, and deported; ev
ery livng, last rotten one of them.
The little round man behind the
iron curtain will welcome them
with open arms, T am sui>c.

Editor, (lie Daily:
I was disgusted to read in Sun
day's Chronicle the article com
menting on the recent increase of
interest in current affairs shown
by California students.
What kind of attitude must mo
tivate the American public imme
diately to suspect any intelligent
interest and enthusiasm of being
Communist-inspired? The press
has recently been much to blame
for this condescension. They have
insisted on dismissing student
demonstrations on ihe assumption
that they are lerl by mere beatniks
and radicals who are obviously
dupes of Communist plotters.
That the student demonstra
tions are "left of center" is indeed
true, if the center is the compla
cency evidenced by the one smug
university official quoted in the
article:
"We must remember that Ihe
tendency is to become more con
servative with age ... If they're
a bit wild now, I think they'll set
tle down."
It is heartening to note that
such patronizng officials as the
one quoted above have not suc
ceeded in attributing to Commu
nists Stanford students' most re
cent triumphs of intelligent in
quiry and initiative: the Hoover
Institution expose and the Draft
Stevenson Petiton.
Let us hope that the recent dem
onstrations, caused by a mature
desire to learn the truth about po
litical events will continue, un
hampered by any American Le
gion ideas of the American's duty
to settle down and maintain the
status quo.

Editor, the Daily:
While reading last Monday's
Daily, I had to assure myself that
it, indeed, was the Daily, by re
ferring to the heading on page
one which says,"The Stanford
Daily." That issue would certainly
do justice to a Communist organ:
e.g. "The Daily Worker."
If ever I have read pro-Commu
nist, and Anti-American reporting
and editorializing, that was it. It
was, without doubt, the most dis
gusting. and distasteful publica
tion I have read here.
We are Americans, dedicated to
the freedom of the individual, and
to our country. But, I begin to
wonder, and seriously. I am sure,
however, that the majority of
student demonstrators, along with
our editor and his cohorts, are
not pro-communist, but genuine in
their concern for individual free
dom. What transpired in San
Francisco last weekend, proves
how succesful these Communist
conspirators can be in advancing
their propaganda campaign.
The minds of these demonstra
tors have been duped into the
Communist line of thought. What
could be more successful to the
Communist movement in this
country, that to have abolished a
congressional committee estab
lished for the purpose of exposing
Communist activity?
Any American who rightfully
calls himself an American, should
take pride in being asked to di
vulge any information which may
help to curtail this activity. The
Communist conpiracy is a serious
one. Communism should be recog
nized for what it is an ugly ogre
haunting the face of the globe,
and no amount of effort should
be spared in the fight for its total
and utter destruction.
The realization that it is not

merely a harmless ideology and
political theory, as many of our
writers, commentators, and col
lege professors would have us be
lieve, would be a giant step step
in this fight. Communism must
be obliterated.
And while the House Un-Ameri

Editor, the Daily:
While reading last Monday's
Daily, I had to assure myself that
it, indeed, was the Daily, by re
ferring to the heading on page
one which says,"The Stanford
Daily." That issue would certainly
do justice to a Communist organ:
e.g. "The Daily Worker."
If ever I have read pro-Commu
nist, and Anti-American reporting
and editorializing, that was it. It
was, without doubt, the most dis
gusting. and distasteful publica
tion I have read here.
We are Americans, dedicated to
the freedom of the individual, and
to our country. But, I begin to
wonder, and seriously. I am sure,
however, that the majority of
student demonstrators, along with
our editor and his cohorts, are
not pro-communist, but genuine in
their concern for individual free
dom. What transpired in San
Francisco last weekend, proves
how succesful these Communist
conspirators can be in advancing
their propaganda campaign.
The minds of these demonstra
tors have been duped into the
Communist line of thought. What
could be more successful to the
Communist movement in this
country, that to have abolished a
congressional committee estab
lished for the purpose of exposing
Communist activity?
Any American who rightfully
calls himself an American, should
take pride in being asked to di
vulge any information which may
help to curtail this activity. The
Communist conpiracy is a serious
one. Communism should be recog
nized for what it is an ugly ogre
haunting the face of the globe,
and no amount of effort should
be spared in the fight for its total
and utter destruction.
The realization that it is not

merely a harmless ideology and
political theory, as many of our
writers, commentators, and col
lege professors would have us be
lieve, would be a giant step step
in this fight. Communism must
be obliterated.
And while the House Un-Ameri
can .Activties Committee itself,
certainly won't obliterate it, ii
seeks to expose its activities, and
it is while thus exposed that they
are rendered less dangerous. One
of the most effective means of
hindering subversive progress is
to publicize it. -
I sincerely urge all those taking
part in last weekend's irresponsi
ble demonstration, to do a little
responsible thinking for a change.
How on God's earth can "intelli
gent" students believe 1 hat these
destroyers of freedom should be
protected under the rights of a
constitution, the very destruction
of which is their goal. What man
ner of logic is this?
Such enemies must necessarily
forfeit all such rights. They
should be stripped of their Ameri
can citizenship, and deported; ev
ery livng, last rotten one of them.

iron curtain will welcome them

I was disgusted to read in Sun

menting on the recent increase of
interest in current affairs shown
by California students.
What kind of attitude must mo
tivate the American public imme
diately to suspect any intelligent
interest and enthusiasm of being
Communist-inspired? The press
has recently been much to blame
for this condescension. They have
insisted on dismissing student
demonstrations on ihe assumption
that they are lerl by mere beatniks
and radicals who are obviously
dupes of Communist plotters.
That the student demonstra
tions are "left of center" is indeed
true, if the center is the compla
cency evidenced by the one smug
university official quoted in the
article:
"We must remember that Ihe
tendency is to become more con
servative with age ... If they're
a bit wild now, I think they'll set
tle down."
It is heartening to note that
such patronizng officials as the
one quoted above have not suc
ceeded in attributing to Commu
nists Stanford students' most re
cent triumphs of intelligent in
quiry and initiative: the Hoover
Institution expose and the Draft
