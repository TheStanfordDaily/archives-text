Amid the wreckage, and as wo
recover from the shock, the long
work of rebuilding will have to
begin. Where must it begin? It
I must begin at the point where the
j most critical damage has been
done. Where is that point? It is
I not in what Mr. Khrushchev said
; or did to us. It is in what we did
'to ourselves. It i-s that we" first
I did help to wound ourselves."
The wound has been made by
| the series of blunders on the grav-
Iest matters in the highest quar
j ters. These blunders have not only
angered the Russians and wrecked
| the summit conference but. much
j worse than all that, they have cast
j doubt among our allies and among
our own people on our compe
tence to lead the Western alliance
; on the issues of peace and war.
Mr. Khrushchev's harsh and in
temperate language has produced
a reaction and revoked sympathy
! for the plight of the President.
But we must have no illusions
i about the depth and the extent of
the loss of confidence in American
leadership, in the judgment, sa
gacity, and political competence of
the government in Washington.
This is the damage to which we
j must address ourselves. We are
| a free people, and one of the bless-
I ings of a free society is that, un
! like an unfree society, it provides
a way to deal with error and cor
rect mistakes.
In a situation like ours the dam
! age to outj prestige would be irre
; parable if we all rallied around
jthe President and pretended to
! think that there was nothing seri
| ously wrong. For that would
prove to the world that the blund
ers will not be corrected but will
be continued, and that our whole
people are satisfied with bad gov-
I ernment. , ,
These are hard words. But in
what other words shall we de
scribe the performance on Sunday
night when the Secretary of De
1 fense, who is in Paris as one of
the President's advisors, ordered
a worldwide alert of American
combat forces?
On Sunday night Mr. Macmillan
and General fie Gaulle were still
struggling to find some way out
- of the affair of the spy plane. Yet
i this was the time chosen by the
! Secretary of Defense to "stage a
i world-wide . readiness . exercise"
which, though not the last stage
before actual war, is one of the
preliminary stages to it.
I Why Sunday of all days? This
blunder was not the work of some

i forgotten Colonel on a Turkish air
i field. This was the work of the
| Sercetary of Defense and of the
' President. The timing of the "ex
ercise" was just a shade worse
than sending off the U-2 on its
perilous mission two weeks before
i the summit. The liming of the
! so-called exercise makes no sense
I whatever. For if the alert was
concerned with a possible surprise
attack, when in the name of com
: moil sense would there be less
, danger of a surprise attack on the
Western world than when Mr. K.
j in person was in Paris?
Ull happ i 1 y, too, Secretary
Gates's "exercise" was jusl about
as incompetently administered at
the top as was the affair of the
spy plane. This time, it appears,
the top people forgot to say any
thing about (lie "exercise" to their
press officers who did not know
what to say, and were not even in
their offices, when the public was
, being I'rightened by Hie "exer
| cise."
A great government faced with
la most formidable adversary, it
j self the leader, champion, and
mainstay of the non-Communist
world, cannot be conducted in
such a reckless and haphazard
way. That is the damage that
first must be repaired before we
can begin to deal with the general
international wreckage, and to
regain our confidence in our
selves.
