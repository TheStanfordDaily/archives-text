# SU Golfers Sweep AAWU Matches
## 
### Pete James 
The Stanford golf team, caring little about the fact that they had
lost to both UCLA and USC in regular season matches, won the
AAWU team championship by a whopping 41 strokes. The final
scores showed Stanford with a total of 1192 -strokes, or an average
of 74.25 shots per round, far ahead of second place UCLA, with a

1 77.06 average.
The Cards picked up all of the
individual prizes, using local
knowledge to take first, second,
third, and fifth places. Sophomore
Pete Choate, medalist in throe of
the last five Tribe matches, won
the tournament with a score of
293. Bill Seanor was three strokes
back at 297. Kent Winton's 299
was good enough for third, and
! Steve Smith's 303 gave him a tie
for fifth with Tom Thompson of
i UCLA. Washington's Clint Names
1 was fourth with 300.
Choate and Seanor
The tournament soon developed
into a match between Choate and
Seanor. Choate shot a 70 in the
I first round to give himself a two

! stroke lead over Seanor and Bill
' Mott of UCLA. The gusty winds
I of the afternoon raised the scores,
and when the dust settled. Choate
was sitting uneasily in the lead
! at 146, one stroke ahead of Seanor
and Mott.
Seanor pulled even on the first
hole of the third round, and in the
process picked up two shots on
Mott. At the end of nine holes he
i had taken the lead with a one over
I par 37 as Choate slipped to a 40
and Mott put himself out of seri
ous contention with a 12. Choate's
deadly putting enabled him to
' play the second nine in one under
par 34, but lie could only pick up
one stroke on Seanor's 35. At the
three quarter mark SeAnor led by
one over Choate, and Stanford's
Kent Winton had moved into third
; position, five shots away.
Last Round
The last round was all Choate.
His wind-defying 73 was the low
| est of the afternoon, and it gave
him the tournament by four shots
over the fading Seanor.
As is the case in so many sports
stories, the sentimental favorite
didn't win. Bill Seanor was first
man on the Stanford divot team
two years ago, only to have a
very promising collegiate career
interrupted by an automobile ac
; cident. He spent last summer on
crutches and sat out the first few
matches this year because he was
still too weak to walk 18 holes.
Yet his display of shots and putts
almost carried him to the top.
He didn't win, but he has two
months to gather strength for the
NCAA Tournament at Broad
moor. where Stanford has hopes
of duplicating or improving on its
third place showing of last year.
