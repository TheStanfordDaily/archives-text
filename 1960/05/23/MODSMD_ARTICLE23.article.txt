# Card Nine Loses Pair
## 
### 
Stanford's v&rsity baseballers
ended the 1960 season on a dismal
note as they were mauled by the
powerful Southern California Tro
jans 9-3 and 19-6 over the week
end. The twin wins enabled USC
to tie Cal for the CIBA champion
ship and gave them an NCAA
playoff berth. The Indians finish
ed in a tie with Santa Clara for
third place with a 6-10 record.
The final game Saturday was a
nightmare as five Card pitchers
yielded the 19 runs on 10 hits, and
the defense committed five errors.'
Trojans Bob Levingston and
Tony Glassman didn't help mat
ters as both belted grand-slam
home runs in the fracas. Catcher
Bill Heath also connected for the
circuit with one aboard.
The Indians matched SC with
10 hits, but two ,Trojan double
plays and some clutch pitching by
Jim Withers held Stanford to six
runs. Mike Magee, still ailing
from an ankle injury, led the Card
attack with three hits. John Hurl
but, and Rich Ferrazzano had two
apiece.
Friday the Indians went into
the game hoping to knock SC out
of the CIBA race and jumped off
to an early 2-0 lead. Three back
to-back homers dimmed their
chances as Tom Satriano, Leving
ston, and Art Ersepke cleared the
fences.
Bruce Gardner notched his sev
enth league victory without a
loss, allowing just five Stanford
hits. Marv Meeklenberg, hero of
last weekend's double win over
Santa Clara, started but was ta
ken out in the five-run third. Mark
Miller came on but coiddn't halt
the 11 -hit Trojan attack.

Stanford's v&rsity baseballers
ended the 1960 season on a dismal
note as they were mauled by the
powerful Southern California Tro
jans 9-3 and 19-6 over the week
end. The twin wins enabled USC
to tie Cal for the CIBA champion
ship and gave them an NCAA
playoff berth. The Indians finish
ed in a tie with Santa Clara for
third place with a 6-10 record.
The final game Saturday was a
nightmare as five Card pitchers
yielded the 19 runs on 10 hits, and
the defense committed five errors.'
Trojans Bob Levingston and
Tony Glassman didn't help mat
ters as both belted grand-slam
home runs in the fracas. Catcher
Bill Heath also connected for the
circuit with one aboard.
The Indians matched SC with
10 hits, but two ,Trojan double
plays and some clutch pitching by
Jim Withers held Stanford to six
runs. Mike Magee, still ailing
from an ankle injury, led the Card
attack with three hits. John Hurl
but, and Rich Ferrazzano had two
apiece.
Friday the Indians went into
the game hoping to knock SC out
of the CIBA race and jumped off
to an early 2-0 lead. Three back
to-back homers dimmed their
chances as Tom Satriano, Leving
ston, and Art Ersepke cleared the
fences.
Bruce Gardner notched his sev
enth league victory without a
loss, allowing just five Stanford
hits. Marv Meeklenberg, hero of
last weekend's double win over
Santa Clara, started but was ta
ken out in the five-run third. Mark
Miller came on but coiddn't halt
the 11 -hit Trojan attack.

Stanford's v&rsity baseballers
ended the 1960 season on a dismal
note as they were mauled by the
powerful Southern California Tro
jans 9-3 and 19-6 over the week
end. The twin wins enabled USC
to tie Cal for the CIBA champion
ship and gave them an NCAA
playoff berth. The Indians finish
ed in a tie with Santa Clara for
third place with a 6-10 record.
The final game Saturday was a
nightmare as five Card pitchers
yielded the 19 runs on 10 hits, and
the defense committed five errors.'
Trojans Bob Levingston and
Tony Glassman didn't help mat
ters as both belted grand-slam
home runs in the fracas. Catcher
Bill Heath also connected for the
circuit with one aboard.
The Indians matched SC with
10 hits, but two ,Trojan double
plays and some clutch pitching by
Jim Withers held Stanford to six
runs. Mike Magee, still ailing
from an ankle injury, led the Card
attack with three hits. John Hurl
but, and Rich Ferrazzano had two
apiece.
Friday the Indians went into
the game hoping to knock SC out
of the CIBA race and jumped off
to an early 2-0 lead. Three back
to-back homers dimmed their
chances as Tom Satriano, Leving
ston, and Art Ersepke cleared the
fences.
Bruce Gardner notched his sev
enth league victory without a
loss, allowing just five Stanford
hits. Marv Meeklenberg, hero of
last weekend's double win over
Santa Clara, started but was ta
ken out in the five-run third. Mark
Miller came on but coiddn't halt
the 11 -hit Trojan attack.

Stanford's v&rsity baseballers
ended the 1960 season on a dismal
note as they were mauled by the
powerful Southern California Tro
jans 9-3 and 19-6 over the week
end. The twin wins enabled USC
to tie Cal for the CIBA champion
ship and gave them an NCAA
playoff berth. The Indians finish
ed in a tie with Santa Clara for
third place with a 6-10 record.
The final game Saturday was a
nightmare as five Card pitchers
yielded the 19 runs on 10 hits, and
the defense committed five errors.'
Trojans Bob Levingston and
Tony Glassman didn't help mat
ters as both belted grand-slam
home runs in the fracas. Catcher
Bill Heath also connected for the
circuit with one aboard.
The Indians matched SC with
10 hits, but two ,Trojan double
plays and some clutch pitching by
Jim Withers held Stanford to six
runs. Mike Magee, still ailing
from an ankle injury, led the Card
attack with three hits. John Hurl
but, and Rich Ferrazzano had two
apiece.
Friday the Indians went into
the game hoping to knock SC out
of the CIBA race and jumped off
to an early 2-0 lead. Three back
to-back homers dimmed their
chances as Tom Satriano, Leving
ston, and Art Ersepke cleared the
fences.
Bruce Gardner notched his sev
enth league victory without a
loss, allowing just five Stanford
hits. Marv Meeklenberg, hero of
last weekend's double win over
Santa Clara, started but was ta
ken out in the five-run third. Mark
Miller came on but coiddn't halt
the 11 -hit Trojan attack.
