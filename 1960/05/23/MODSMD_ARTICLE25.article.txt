# Giants Lose to Pirates in Eleven
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH (/P) â€”Pinchhitter
Hal Smith's bases-loaded single in
the 11th inning at rain-soaked
Forbes Field Sunday carried the
National League - leading Pitts
burgh Pirates to an unphill 8-7 vic
tory over second-place San Fran
cisco.
The triumph moved the Pirates
1 'y games in front of the Giants,
who used six pitchers in an effort
to salvage the rubber contest of
their three-game series.
Twice delayed by tain for a to
tal of 63 minutes, the game was a
see-saw battle of batters with
pitchers wearing a rut to the
mound.
