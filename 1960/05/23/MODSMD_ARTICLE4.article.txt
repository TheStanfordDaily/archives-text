# Indonesian Economic Policy Explained in Soeharto Report
## 
### 
Justice and prosperity for the
whole nation is the aim of the
social revolution in Indonesia,
according to Dr. R. Soeharto,
Minister of People's Industries of
the Republic of Indonesia.
Soeharto spoke to members of
the International Business Club
and interested Business School
students Friday afternoon during
his day-long visit to Stanford.
Indonesian government is seek
ing to accomplish its aim through
a policy of driving and guiding
the country's economy. "That
means, simply, that we have re
jected the idea of a liberal or
laissez faire economy," he said.
To clarify his point further,
Soeharto added that there is per
haps no free country in the world
in which liberal economy or
where classical patterns of capi
talism are stiil used. All states
have found it necessary to devise
and use some controls over its
free functioning economy.
"It is our conviction that, in

the present world picture, capi
talization and capital growth arc
too serious a matter to be left to
capitalists," he added.
Soeharto denied the fact that
Indonesia can be compared to the
United States a 100 years ago.
He pointed out that there is no
land hunger or capital looking for
investment in his country. The
basis upon which they must build
is a large supply of labor unequal
ly distributed over tho country's
7,900 islands and an abundance
of natural resources.
The guidance of industry in In
donesia is divided into two minis
tries â€” People's Industries and
Basic Industries.
Basic industry, including min
ing, is state enterprise, or at least
there is state intervention. Indus
tries too costly, too large, and
which are necessary before small
private industries can flourish
fall in this category. State inter
vention is involved in all aspects
of basic industry.
People's Industries are home,

and small scale basic industry
employing less than 300 workers.
They are mainly engaged in pro
ducing consumer goods.
Soeharto further explained that
these industries are open to pri
vate national enterprise. They are
under the guidance of the state.
Non-nationals can only interfer
indirectly through such things as
state bonds.
Indonesia is under-industrial
ized, an agricultural country de
pending upon extractive indus
tries. The existing home and small
industries are grossly underme
chanized. As in all insufficiently
capitalized countries, their output
is low and the wages poor, Soe
harto said.
He pointed out that modern
manufacturing firms in the coun
try must dependend almost en
tirely upon imports since the
basic industry is not yet fully
developed. As an example he cited
the importation of 90'; of the
paper consumed by the printing
industry.
