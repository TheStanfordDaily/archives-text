# STRAVINSKY OPERA
## Chorus, Orchestra Production Of 'Oedipus' I Called Rare Treat 
### Elna Rodenhouse Staff Editor 
Anyone who missed the Stan- i
ford Chorus and Orchestra's pre
sentation of Stravinsky's "Ocdi
pus Rex" this weekend missed a
rare treat a generally excellent (
production on the parts of these!
two groups.
The opera-oratorio, â€¢ based on j
Sophocles' tragedy, was a prod
uct of Stravinsky's wish to do
something monumental, and his
subsequent collaboration w i th
Jean Cockteau. Cockteau's text j
and Stravinsky's score demands
that the principals become "living
statues" on stage, thus symboliz
ing the element of greatness!
which one feels in the original 1
work.
Most of the principals portrayed
their characters with an excel
lence that is unusual for a stu
dent production.
Oedipus, played by a very fine-!
voiced Patrick Daugherty, became
all that the role demands in the
way of majestic dignity. His reac-:

tion to the prophesy of the oracle
and to the final revelation of the
shepherd as to Oedipus' ancestry
bespoke of the h e i gh t s from
which he was to fall.
Daugherty's voice carried well
when he sang alone or with muted
accompaniment, but did not have
the strength to overpower full
orchestral accompaniment. His
most powerful impact came when
Oedipus, blinded by his own hand,
came groping onto the stage, only
to be gently turned away by the
people.
Creon was wonderfully por
trayed by Irving Pearson, as was
Tiresias, sung by Robert Oliver,
whose powerful voice belied Tire
sias' beard and stooped carriage.
It is indeed a pity that these two
could not have had more promi
nent roles, as their voices would
have added many dimensions to
any role they undertook.
Henry McGuckin as the messen
ger and Leonard Weeks as the
shepherd sang their parts as if
they lived them. Especially good
was their duet, where their well
matched voices superbly comple
mented each other.
Jocasta, sung by Nancy Cron
burg, took on a queenly atmos
phere entirely proper for the role.
Unfortunately, Miss Cronburg's
voice did not have the carrying
power typical of the other singers,
and she seemed to end phrases at
a less audible level than they
began.
Narrator Alec Ross, in his own
way added to the controlled emo
tion flowing out into the audi
ence. Though his part called for
little acting, Ross' voice and ges
tures complemented an already
excellent production.
