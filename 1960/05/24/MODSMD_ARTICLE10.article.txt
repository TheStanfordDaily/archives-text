## Spring Sequoia on Sale; Fine Cover; Fair Content 
### Judy Sklar, Associate Editor 
The spring Sequoia, on sale today, is a wonderfully covered but
only fairly filled issue.
The fiction and poetry are both excellent but there is a conspicuous
lack of articles and of art (except for the fine cover by Gilda Meyers).

j L. S. Simekes are Ihe outstanding
pieces of the magazine. Kakfa

sions of moments and events in
time.
Both of the other stories, "Ben
, nie's Miss Moffet" by Jim Thayer
I and "The Baseball Business" by
David MeCullough, are also ex
tremely well done.
All four arc quite well illus-
I trated.
Excellent Poetry
The poetry by Ralph Smith, a
Petaluma house painter, is very
powerful and exciting, and the
| poems by Wendell Berry (this is
! his second appearance in the Sc
' quoia) are a fine contrast to them,
jjudy Rascoe's poetry and draw-
I ings are an excellent addition to
the magazine.
The problems of the magazine
center on the non-fiction. The
i conversation with Alexander Ke
' rensky, which is the lead article,
is limited by the artificial form of
question and answer. It gives an
1 impression of Kerensky the man,
but a great deal of his character
is lost in its getting down.
Article on Hamlet
John Lawrence's article on
Hamlet is an interesting but far
too long refutation of the Ernest
i Jones interpretation.
The editor's note by David
; Quarles is a comment on the re
cent resurgence of campus "acti
vism," which, traces it from its
beginning in the spring of '.18.
Quarles attributes the interest
; to the "infusion of European
blood and European ideas as a
result of the Stanford overseas
program."
The publication is on sale at
Engineering Corner for 50 cents

Both of the other stories, "Ben
, nie's Miss Moffet" by Jim Thayer
I and "The Baseball Business" by
David MeCullough, are also ex
tremely well done.
All four arc quite well illus-
I trated.
Excellent Poetry
The poetry by Ralph Smith, a
Petaluma house painter, is very
powerful and exciting, and the
| poems by Wendell Berry (this is
! his second appearance in the Sc
' quoia) are a fine contrast to them,
jjudy Rascoe's poetry and draw-
I ings are an excellent addition to
the magazine.
The problems of the magazine
center on the non-fiction. The
i conversation with Alexander Ke
' rensky, which is the lead article,
is limited by the artificial form of
question and answer. It gives an
1 impression of Kerensky the man,
but a great deal of his character
is lost in its getting down.
Article on Hamlet
John Lawrence's article on
Hamlet is an interesting but far
too long refutation of the Ernest
i Jones interpretation.
The editor's note by David
; Quarles is a comment on the re
cent resurgence of campus "acti
vism," which, traces it from its
beginning in the spring of '.18.
Quarles attributes the interest
; to the "infusion of European
blood and European ideas as a
result of the Stanford overseas
program."
The publication is on sale at
Engineering Corner for 50 cents
