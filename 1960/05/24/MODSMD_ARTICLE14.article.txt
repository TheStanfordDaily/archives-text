# Uproar Develops As Brown Speaks
## 
### Jerry Rankin 
A tomato-tossing student, a Palo Alto housewife and a booing, clapping Memorial Auditorium crowd
turned Archie Brown's speech against the House Un-American Activities Subcommittee into an uproar
last night.
Brown, a declared Communist, was nearing the end of his prepared talk when the student popped up

from the front of
the audience,dug
into a paper sack
and heaved four
ripe tomatoes at
the 48 -year -old
longshoreman.
None of the to
matoes came
close to Brown,
all of them splat
tering against
the wooden par
tition in the back
of the band pit.

The student, who iater identi
fied Jiimself as Julio Fernandez-
Sintes, was grabbing for more
vegetables -as those in front of
him scrambled for cover -when
he was collared by several student
policemen and hustled out into
the lobby.
ClosÂ« to Blows
Another unidentified foreign
student, who had razzed Brown
earlier, ran out and tried to pull
the student police away from
Sintes, who was standing quietly.
The unidentified student and a
student cop were close to exchang
ing blows when Stanford Police
Chief Gordon Davis, who was in
ihe audience, appeared and calm
ed things down.
He asked the tomato-throwing
person to produce his student
body card. He showed Davis the
card identifying him as Sintes, a
graduate student majoring in
aeronautical engineering.
Davis restored order, telling
Sintes to "drop in" and see him
today, as the other student went
back in and sat down.
Brown and Sintes are known to
have fought on opposite sides in
the Spanish Civil War. Brown
campaigned with the Abraham
Lincoln Brigade on the Loyalist
side, while Sintes was a member
of Franco's opposing Fascists.
Booing and Shouting
The talk, sponsored by the In
dependent Caucus of the Political
Union, boiled over right after the
start. As Brown told of the May
14 student riot, about a dozen
Stanford men began to boo him.
They were joined by several
adults. The booing and shouting,
such as "Take the fifth. Brown,"
and "shoot him!," went on dur
ing the entire hour and a half
meeting.
The portly woman stood up
during the question period with
a handful of notes and announced
she was the "opposing speaker"
to Brown. She defended the com
mittee, and wound up on the
stage with Brown.
She wouid not give her name,
saying "I have no name," but later
was identified by several mem
bers of the audience as Mrs. Ken
neth Wallick of Palo Alto.
Brown Accuses
Brown accused the committee
of causing several witnesses who
have appeared before it to com
mit. suicide. He said the student
protests in San Francisco are just
a sign of the growing determina
tion on the students' parts to
fight for their civil rights.
The slight, smiling Brown ac
knowledged that he is "now a
member of the C o m m u n i s t
Party," and that he believes the
best way to obtain socialism in
the United States is through the
Communist Party.
He said, however, that he is
against violent overthrow of the
government and that he feels so
cialism can be brought about
peacefully in this country.
