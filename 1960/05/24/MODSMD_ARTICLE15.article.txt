# Upsurge of Student Interest In Public Affairs Noticed
## 
### Lynn DeLargey 
The last six monlhs have seen a
remarkable upsurge in student
participation in public affairs in
this country. The number of im
portant issues on which students I
have taken an intelligent and re- i
sponsible stand is impressive.
Some of the issues have had an :
obvious and direct relation to edu-1
cation, for .example, the wide
spread protest of the disclaimer)
affidavit provision of the loan
funds of the National Defense Ed- i
ucation Act. Many student legis
latures, including Stanford's, sent S
' official protests to Congress ask
ing for repeal of the provision.
Another instance is the resist-:
ance to the Kerr Directives at the '
University of California. The stu- j
dent legislature at Cal protested
what they thought was a breach j
of academic freedom in the firing \
of University of Illinois professor i
Leo Koch.
Then the student Ex-Corn was
faced with its own battle for free-!
dom from administrative decision!
on what issues the student body i
may express an official, collective j
opinion. The ASSU has commend- j
ed the Ex-Com for refusing to re-;
seind its letter on Koch.
There seems to be a new con
sciousness of the necessity for j
students to speak officially, all to- i
get her, in their role as students, j
on academic issues.
Students have also begun to ex-:
press concerted opinion on some i
national issues -segregation, dis-1
armament, freedom of speech—
which are eminently moral prob-,
lems. These problems call for
idealism and intellectual acuity, j
which should be college students' j
peculiar contribution to public af- j
fairs.
Funds 1o defend sit-in strikers |
against segregation in Southern |
lunch counters have been gath-j
ered from students all over the ■
nation, including over $600 from
Stanford students.
Bay Area students have actively j
yet pacifically shown their oppo- 1
sit ion to capital punishment and !
to the House Un-American Activi-,
lies Subcommittee. Other stu-1
dents took part in a disarmament,
demonstration following the Lit- j
tie Summit Conference at San 1

Francisco State College last Sat
urday.
Although many students are
not aware it exists, the National
Student Association, which works
toward national student coopera
tion through its yearly confer
ences, also exerts influence on na
tional policy.
It holds conferences to promote
student interests, for example the
April 2.3 conference in Washing
ton, D.C., on the sit-in strikes in
the South. It has been called up
on from time to time to testify be
fore Congress on the attitudes of
students to pending legislation.
It seems unlikely that student
organizations will ever attain the
power and unity of those in Euro
pean nations, due to greater di
vergence among colleges and uni
versities and also to the much
greater area of the nation, but the
NSA will grow in strength in the
next few years.
Even non-student, publications
have noticed the increased politi
cal activity of American students
recently.
In speaking of the recent stu
dent revolts in Korea and in Tur
key, a Life editorial (May 9) re
marked, "Political revolt by uni
versity students is a well-known
story abroad, though not common
to our own land. This may be a
reflection of the seriousness and
maturity of U.S. students but,
whatever the cause, other stu
dents around the world are politi
cally minded by tradition and are
accepted as a dynamic political
force."
The editorial cites the sit-in
strikes by Southern students as
an example of this kind of "revolt
of the young." The student atti
tude is not necessarily one of per
petual revolt, but probably a
greater feeling of kinship with
other students throughout the
country, and an awareness of the
potential force of student opinion
labelled as such, could have good
effects on the nation.
The good results would be chief
ly two: improvement of govern
ment generally for the whole
country, and certainly an im
provement in the education of the
students themselves, who would
thus be able to test ideas and re
late them lo life in the course of
pursuing that precious sheepskin.

ing for repeal of the provision.
Another instance is the resist-:

The last six monlhs have seen a
remarkable upsurge in student
participation in public affairs in
this country. The number of im
portant issues on which students I
have taken an intelligent and re- i
sponsible stand is impressive.
Some of the issues have had an :
obvious and direct relation to edu-1
cation, for .example, the wide
spread protest of the disclaimer)
affidavit provision of the loan
funds of the National Defense Ed- i
ucation Act. Many student legis
latures, including Stanford's, sent S
' official protests to Congress ask
ing for repeal of the provision.
Another instance is the resist-:
ance to the Kerr Directives at the '
University of California. The stu- j
dent legislature at Cal protested
what they thought was a breach j
of academic freedom in the firing \
of University of Illinois professor i
Leo Koch.
Then the student Ex-Corn was
faced with its own battle for free-!
dom from administrative decision!
on what issues the student body i
may express an official, collective j
opinion. The ASSU has commend- j
ed the Ex-Com for refusing to re-;
seind its letter on Koch.
There seems to be a new con
sciousness of the necessity for j
students to speak officially, all to- i
get her, in their role as students, j
on academic issues.
Students have also begun to ex-:
press concerted opinion on some i
national issues -segregation, dis-1
armament, freedom of speech—
which are eminently moral prob-,
lems. These problems call for
idealism and intellectual acuity, j
which should be college students' j
peculiar contribution to public af- j
fairs.
Funds 1o defend sit-in strikers |
against segregation in Southern |
lunch counters have been gath-j
ered from students all over the ■
nation, including over $600 from
Stanford students.
Bay Area students have actively j
yet pacifically shown their oppo- 1
sit ion to capital punishment and !
to the House Un-American Activi-,
lies Subcommittee. Other stu-1
dents took part in a disarmament,
demonstration following the Lit- j
tie Summit Conference at San 1

Francisco State College last Sat
urday.
Although many students are
not aware it exists, the National
Student Association, which works
toward national student coopera
tion through its yearly confer
ences, also exerts influence on na
tional policy.
It holds conferences to promote
student interests, for example the
April 2.3 conference in Washing
ton, D.C., on the sit-in strikes in
the South. It has been called up
on from time to time to testify be
fore Congress on the attitudes of
students to pending legislation.
It seems unlikely that student
organizations will ever attain the
power and unity of those in Euro
pean nations, due to greater di
vergence among colleges and uni
versities and also to the much
greater area of the nation, but the
NSA will grow in strength in the
next few years.
Even non-student, publications
have noticed the increased politi
cal activity of American students
recently.
In speaking of the recent stu
dent revolts in Korea and in Tur
key, a Life editorial (May 9) re
marked, "Political revolt by uni
versity students is a well-known
story abroad, though not common
to our own land. This may be a
reflection of the seriousness and
maturity of U.S. students but,
whatever the cause, other stu
dents around the world are politi
cally minded by tradition and are
accepted as a dynamic political
force."
The editorial cites the sit-in
strikes by Southern students as
an example of this kind of "revolt
of the young." The student atti
tude is not necessarily one of per
petual revolt, but probably a
greater feeling of kinship with
other students throughout the
country, and an awareness of the
potential force of student opinion
labelled as such, could have good
effects on the nation.
The good results would be chief
ly two: improvement of govern
ment generally for the whole
country, and certainly an im
provement in the education of the
students themselves, who would
thus be able to test ideas and re
late them lo life in the course of
pursuing that precious sheepskin.
