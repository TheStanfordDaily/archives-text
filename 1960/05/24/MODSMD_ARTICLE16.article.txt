# LOOKING AROUND
## Take a Giant Step 
### Ron Rapoport Associate Editor 
Every so often a movie appears
that makes the viewer wonder
about that great beast called ad
vertising which is supposed to
have taken over our lives.
The movie-goer will never have
heard or have read a word about
it, yet he will think it far more
worthy of attention than some of
the collosal bores that get the day
lights publicized out of them.
Those who saw "Bad Day at
Black Rock" at the flicks a couple
of Sundays ago will know what
we are talking about. This was
a mo\ ie that was too good to rate
anything more than a mention
during the Academy Awards pres
entation.
Another Sleeper
Currently there is another one
of these sleeper" going around
which is worthy of being called to
your attention. "Take a Giant
Step." The only rea-son that any
one has seen this movie is because
it is being coupled with the latest
Marlon Brando, Tennessee Wil
liams shocker, "The Fugitive
Kind," at many Peninsula thea
ters.
"Take a Giant Step" is a study
in race relations, not of the South
ern Negro struggling for his life
against a violent mob, but of his
Northern counterpart struggling
for a measure of happiness and
belonging in a white environment.
Negro Cast
The predominantly Negro cast
is an excellent one yet contains
none of the "name" Negro actors.
As a matter of fact the only recog
nizable people in the movie are
Johnny Nash, a young singer, and
Ruby Dee. an experienced actress
of some years standing.
Nash gets thrown out of school
for taking offense to his history
teacher's bigoted remark about
the Negroes during the civil war.
Directly after this, four of his
white friends come to his house
to ask him to pitch for their base
ball team, yet make a point of not
asking him to a party afterwards.
Nash blows up and throws them
out of the house and then decides
to run away from home. He wan
tiers around and ends up in a bar.
Here, he has a scene with three
prostitutes which is done with a

kind of sensitivity so foreign to
the screen that many members of
the audience couldn't believe what
they were seeing. The highlight of
this scene is when the naive and
unsuspecting Nash begins to catch
on and says, "Are you girls pros
titutes or something?"
Nash finally goes home and
faces his parents. Their fear of
the consequences of hi-s getting
thrown out of school takes the
form of real anguish about their
situation in the community. His
mother says, "You must never
talk back to a white woman!
Never, under any circumstances.
In the South you could be lynched
for that and we'd be powerless to
protect you."
.Must Be Better
His father, a teller at a local
batik, says, "A colored boy has got
to be better 1 than a white boy just
to be as good*as he is. I've got to
be better than any white man at
the bank just to keep my job."
It is then that Nash's grand
mother. played to perfection by
Estelle Hemsley, gets into the act
and sums up the whole problem:
"I told you not to move into
this neighborhood. 'Stay with
your own kind,' 1 said. Now
you've got a problem you can't
handle. He is at an age where he
needs to be accepted, but none of
his pals will accept him.
"They're all starting to go
around with girls, but no girl's
father wants his daughter to go
around with a colored boy. He's
not accepted so he does the only
thing he can do, tight back.
You've made it impossible for him
not to do what you didn't want
him to do."
High Comedy
There are moments of high com
edy and moments of unbelievably
plausible action and speech in this
movie. The NAAC'P could be ex
pected not to like some of the
characterization of the Negroes as
they are not always shown in a
favorable light. They curse at
and they hit one another, yet they
ait? shown to love each other with
a devotion which is uncommon to
the screen.
One wonders why he has never
heard of "Take a Giant Step," yet
suspects that he is liable to hear
of it in the future.

Johnny Nash, a young singer, and
Ruby Dee. an experienced actress
of some years standing.
Nash gets thrown out of school
for taking offense to his history
teacher's bigoted remark about
the Negroes during the civil war.
Directly after this, four of his
white friends come to his house
to ask him to pitch for their base
ball team, yet make a point of not
asking him to a party afterwards.
Nash blows up and throws them
out of the house and then decides
to run away from home. He wan
tiers around and ends up in a bar.
Here, he has a scene with three
prostitutes which is done with a

kind of sensitivity so foreign to
the screen that many members of
the audience couldn't believe what
they were seeing. The highlight of
this scene is when the naive and
unsuspecting Nash begins to catch
on and says, "Are you girls pros
titutes or something?"
Nash finally goes home and
faces his parents. Their fear of
the consequences of hi-s getting
thrown out of school takes the
form of real anguish about their
situation in the community. His
mother says, "You must never
talk back to a white woman!
Never, under any circumstances.
In the South you could be lynched
for that and we'd be powerless to
protect you."
.Must Be Better
His father, a teller at a local
batik, says, "A colored boy has got
to be better 1 than a white boy just
to be as good*as he is. I've got to
be better than any white man at
the bank just to keep my job."
It is then that Nash's grand
mother. played to perfection by
Estelle Hemsley, gets into the act
and sums up the whole problem:
"I told you not to move into
this neighborhood. 'Stay with
your own kind,' 1 said. Now
you've got a problem you can't
handle. He is at an age where he
needs to be accepted, but none of
his pals will accept him.
"They're all starting to go
around with girls, but no girl's
father wants his daughter to go
around with a colored boy. He's
not accepted so he does the only
thing he can do, tight back.
You've made it impossible for him
not to do what you didn't want
him to do."
High Comedy
There are moments of high com
edy and moments of unbelievably
plausible action and speech in this
movie. The NAAC'P could be ex
pected not to like some of the
characterization of the Negroes as
they are not always shown in a
favorable light. They curse at
and they hit one another, yet they
ait? shown to love each other with
a devotion which is uncommon to
the screen.
One wonders why he has never
heard of "Take a Giant Step," yet
suspects that he is liable to hear
of it in the future.
Every so often a movie appears
that makes the viewer wonder
about that great beast called ad
vertising which is supposed to
have taken over our lives.
The movie-goer will never have
heard or have read a word about
it, yet he will think it far more
worthy of attention than some of
the collosal bores that get the day
lights publicized out of them.
Those who saw "Bad Day at
Black Rock" at the flicks a couple
of Sundays ago will know what
we are talking about. This was
a mo\ ie that was too good to rate
anything more than a mention
during the Academy Awards pres
entation.
Another Sleeper
Currently there is another one
of these sleeper" going around
which is worthy of being called to
your attention. "Take a Giant
Step." The only rea-son that any
one has seen this movie is because
it is being coupled with the latest
Marlon Brando, Tennessee Wil
liams shocker, "The Fugitive
Kind," at many Peninsula thea

"Take a Giant Step" is a study
in race relations, not of the South
ern Negro struggling for his life
against a violent mob, but of his
Northern counterpart struggling
for a measure of happiness and
belonging in a white environment.

to be as good*as he is. I've got to
be better than any white man at
the bank just to keep my job."
It is then that Nash's grand
mother. played to perfection by
Estelle Hemsley, gets into the act
and sums up the whole problem:
"I told you not to move into
this neighborhood. 'Stay with
your own kind,' 1 said. Now
you've got a problem you can't
handle. He is at an age where he
needs to be accepted, but none of
his pals will accept him.
"They're all starting to go
around with girls, but no girl's
father wants his daughter to go
around with a colored boy. He's
not accepted so he does the only
thing he can do, tight back.
You've made it impossible for him
not to do what you didn't want
him to do."
High Comedy
There are moments of high com
edy and moments of unbelievably
plausible action and speech in this
movie. The NAAC'P could be ex
pected not to like some of the
characterization of the Negroes as
they are not always shown in a
favorable light. They curse at
and they hit one another, yet they
ait? shown to love each other with
a devotion which is uncommon to
the screen.
One wonders why he has never
heard of "Take a Giant Step," yet
suspects that he is liable to hear
of it in the future.
Every so often a movie appears
that makes the viewer wonder
about that great beast called ad
vertising which is supposed to
have taken over our lives.
The movie-goer will never have
heard or have read a word about
it, yet he will think it far more
worthy of attention than some of
the collosal bores that get the day
lights publicized out of them.
Those who saw "Bad Day at
Black Rock" at the flicks a couple
of Sundays ago will know what
we are talking about. This was
a mo\ ie that was too good to rate
anything more than a mention
during the Academy Awards pres
entation.
Another Sleeper
Currently there is another one
of these sleeper" going around
which is worthy of being called to
your attention. "Take a Giant
Step." The only rea-son that any
one has seen this movie is because
it is being coupled with the latest
Marlon Brando, Tennessee Wil
liams shocker, "The Fugitive
Kind," at many Peninsula thea
ters.
"Take a Giant Step" is a study
in race relations, not of the South
ern Negro struggling for his life
against a violent mob, but of his
Northern counterpart struggling
for a measure of happiness and
belonging in a white environment.
Negro Cast
The predominantly Negro cast
is an excellent one yet contains
none of the "name" Negro actors.
As a matter of fact the only recog
nizable people in the movie are
Johnny Nash, a young singer, and
Ruby Dee. an experienced actress
of some years standing.
Nash gets thrown out of school
for taking offense to his history
teacher's bigoted remark about
the Negroes during the civil war.
Directly after this, four of his
white friends come to his house
to ask him to pitch for their base
ball team, yet make a point of not
asking him to a party afterwards.
Nash blows up and throws them
out of the house and then decides
to run away from home. He wan
tiers around and ends up in a bar.
Here, he has a scene with three
prostitutes which is done with a

kind of sensitivity so foreign to
the screen that many members of
the audience couldn't believe what
they were seeing. The highlight of
this scene is when the naive and
unsuspecting Nash begins to catch
on and says, "Are you girls pros
titutes or something?"
Nash finally goes home and
faces his parents. Their fear of
the consequences of hi-s getting
thrown out of school takes the
form of real anguish about their
situation in the community. His
mother says, "You must never
talk back to a white woman!
Never, under any circumstances.
In the South you could be lynched
for that and we'd be powerless to
protect you."
.Must Be Better
His father, a teller at a local
batik, says, "A colored boy has got
to be better 1 than a white boy just
to be as good*as he is. I've got to
be better than any white man at
the bank just to keep my job."
It is then that Nash's grand
mother. played to perfection by
Estelle Hemsley, gets into the act
and sums up the whole problem:
"I told you not to move into
this neighborhood. 'Stay with
your own kind,' 1 said. Now
you've got a problem you can't
handle. He is at an age where he
needs to be accepted, but none of
his pals will accept him.
"They're all starting to go
around with girls, but no girl's
father wants his daughter to go
around with a colored boy. He's
not accepted so he does the only
thing he can do, tight back.
You've made it impossible for him
not to do what you didn't want
him to do."
