Student Action
Editor, the Daily:
We were encouraged to learn of
the participation of students from
your University in a protest
against the House Un-American
Activities Committee. We were
shocked at reports of police bru
tality in the face of peaceful, dem
onstration. The unfair policy of
seating which heightened tension
during the picketing indicated the
hostile attitude of the authorities
toward dissent.
This much is clear: Increased
awareness and activity by stu
dents everywhere have become
evident: in the South against seg
regation, in the North against
businesses which allow their
branches to support segregation,
in San Francisco against extra
legal forms of intimidation.
The political atmosphere of the
'50's was not conducive to student
protest. The shadow of McCarthy
and his tactics hung over the
whole decade. Indeed, not since
the '30\s has American society had
to contend with a discontented
student population. The resurg
ence of student activty, while non
violent in nature, has been met
by authorities with force and in
timidation.
It is encouraging to note in
creasing student protest over the
reactionary policies behind racial
segregation, disclaimer affidavits
and loyalty oaths, and Ihc House
Un-American Activities Commit
tee. Student action against these
forces indicates a new sense of
democracy in this country.
We believe that such activity,
when undertaken with a sense of
responsibility, should be support
ed on all fronts. We therefore
express our confidence in the stu
dents who joined to demonstrate
their disapproval of the House
Un-American Activities Commit
tee and welcome this as symbolic
of a new and vital trend toward
student action in the 1960'5.

Immodest Proposal
Editor, the Daily:
The letter from Mr. Roger was
a testimony to everything that
the Un-American Committee stood
for narrow, infantile name-call
ing.
To speak of Communism as "an
ugly ogre haunting the face of
the globe'' and Khrushchev as
"the little round man behind the
Iron Curtain" is, if nothing else,
reminiscent of the Salem witch
days, when the Black Man was
said to lurk about every forest,
waiting for some evil-loving per
son to pass by.
I'm surprised that Mr. Roger
did not propose burning, rather
than stopping at deportation of
"every living, last rotten one of
them." After all, he is allowing
them to be passed right into the
grasp of that ugly ogre. Why not
dispose of them entirely, and then
scatter the ashes abroad? An
immodest proposal, perhaps, but
certainly one that any upholder
of ihe American Constitution and
the Rights of Man would applaud.

YWCA Protest
Editor, tlk* Daily:
During the Friday, May 20,
lunch meeting of the YWCA, a
discussion of the functions, meth
ods and implications of the House
Un-American Activities Commit-1
tee was conducted.
The consensus expressed was j
that the committee's methods in-1
fringe on the basic civil liberties
guaranteed by the Constitution. J
Members and guests present who!
felt that the investigating com
mittee should be abolished or sub
stantially modified in its methods j
of operation are as follows:
I'riscillu Cowles
(jail Grmisky
Carol Mcßae
I'at Beard
Jerry Fickliri

Reggie Zelnik
Miriam Hrattain
Nancy Robinson
Mary Allen
Elsa Hilnier

New Bookstore
Editor, Hie Daily:
While the new bookstore was
intended to provide better and
faster service to Stanford stu
dents and faculty, it seems that
much remains to be improved.
It is my impression that, for
the average purchase, it now
takes longer than before to get
in and out of the store. This is
mainly because of the long lines
that seem always to be at the
cashiers' desk. The cashiers seem
to be extremely slow and, at the
same time,, uncordial. Just see

how many will put your pur
chases in ;i bag without your ask
ing. When their service is com
pared with that obtainable in a
typical super market, the defi
ciency is even more glaring.
Furthermore, some of the other
help could never keep a job in
an off-campus business because
of their cold and discourteous alti
tudes. One should not feel that
he is imposing merely because
he asks the location of some item
he cannot find.
If enough other people feel this
way about the new operation, per
haps something ought to be done
to change it.

While the new bookstore was
intended to provide better and
faster service to Stanford stu
dents and faculty, it seems that
much remains to be improved.
It is my impression that, for
the average purchase, it now
takes longer than before to get
in and out of the store. This is
mainly because of the long lines
that seem always to be at the
cashiers' desk. The cashiers seem
to be extremely slow and, at the
same time,, uncordial. Just see

how many will put your pur
chases in ;i bag without your ask
ing. When their service is com
pared with that obtainable in a
typical super market, the defi
ciency is even more glaring.
Furthermore, some of the other
help could never keep a job in
an off-campus business because
of their cold and discourteous alti
tudes. One should not feel that
he is imposing merely because
he asks the location of some item
he cannot find.
If enough other people feel this
way about the new operation, per
haps something ought to be done
to change it.

We were encouraged to learn of
the participation of students from
your University in a protest
against the House Un-American
Activities Committee. We were
shocked at reports of police bru
tality in the face of peaceful, dem
onstration. The unfair policy of
seating which heightened tension
during the picketing indicated the
hostile attitude of the authorities
toward dissent.
This much is clear: Increased
awareness and activity by stu
dents everywhere have become
evident: in the South against seg
regation, in the North against
businesses which allow their
branches to support segregation,
in San Francisco against extra
legal forms of intimidation.
The political atmosphere of the
'50's was not conducive to student
protest. The shadow of McCarthy
and his tactics hung over the
whole decade. Indeed, not since
the '30\s has American society had
to contend with a discontented
student population. The resurg
ence of student activty, while non
violent in nature, has been met
by authorities with force and in
timidation.
It is encouraging to note in
creasing student protest over the
reactionary policies behind racial
segregation, disclaimer affidavits
and loyalty oaths, and Ihc House
Un-American Activities Commit
tee. Student action against these
forces indicates a new sense of
democracy in this country.
We believe that such activity,
when undertaken with a sense of
responsibility, should be support
ed on all fronts. We therefore
express our confidence in the stu
dents who joined to demonstrate
their disapproval of the House
Un-American Activities Commit
tee and welcome this as symbolic
of a new and vital trend toward
student action in the 1960'5.

The letter from Mr. Roger was
a testimony to everything that
the Un-American Committee stood
for narrow, infantile name-call
ing.
To speak of Communism as "an
ugly ogre haunting the face of
the globe'' and Khrushchev as
"the little round man behind the
Iron Curtain" is, if nothing else,
reminiscent of the Salem witch
days, when the Black Man was
said to lurk about every forest,
waiting for some evil-loving per
son to pass by.
I'm surprised that Mr. Roger
did not propose burning, rather
than stopping at deportation of
"every living, last rotten one of
them." After all, he is allowing
them to be passed right into the
grasp of that ugly ogre. Why not
dispose of them entirely, and then
scatter the ashes abroad? An
immodest proposal, perhaps, but
certainly one that any upholder
of ihe American Constitution and
the Rights of Man would applaud.

I'm surprised that Mr. Roger
did not propose burning, rather
than stopping at deportation of
"every living, last rotten one of
them." After all, he is allowing
them to be passed right into the
grasp of that ugly ogre. Why not
dispose of them entirely, and then
scatter the ashes abroad? An
immodest proposal, perhaps, but
certainly one that any upholder
of ihe American Constitution and
the Rights of Man would applaud.

YWCA Protest
Editor, tlk* Daily:
During the Friday, May 20,
lunch meeting of the YWCA, a
discussion of the functions, meth
ods and implications of the House
Un-American Activities Commit-1
tee was conducted.
The consensus expressed was j
that the committee's methods in-1
fringe on the basic civil liberties
guaranteed by the Constitution. J
Members and guests present who!
felt that the investigating com
mittee should be abolished or sub
stantially modified in its methods j
of operation are as follows:

New Bookstore
Editor, Hie Daily:
While the new bookstore was
intended to provide better and
faster service to Stanford stu
dents and faculty, it seems that
much remains to be improved.
It is my impression that, for
the average purchase, it now
takes longer than before to get
in and out of the store. This is
mainly because of the long lines
that seem always to be at the
cashiers' desk. The cashiers seem
to be extremely slow and, at the
same time,, uncordial. Just see

how many will put your pur
chases in ;i bag without your ask
ing. When their service is com
pared with that obtainable in a
typical super market, the defi
ciency is even more glaring.
Furthermore, some of the other
help could never keep a job in
an off-campus business because
of their cold and discourteous alti
tudes. One should not feel that
he is imposing merely because
he asks the location of some item
he cannot find.
If enough other people feel this
way about the new operation, per
haps something ought to be done
to change it.

Student Action
Editor, the Daily:
We were encouraged to learn of
the participation of students from
your University in a protest
against the House Un-American
Activities Committee. We were
shocked at reports of police bru
tality in the face of peaceful, dem
onstration. The unfair policy of
seating which heightened tension
during the picketing indicated the
hostile attitude of the authorities
toward dissent.
This much is clear: Increased
awareness and activity by stu
dents everywhere have become
evident: in the South against seg
regation, in the North against
businesses which allow their
branches to support segregation,
in San Francisco against extra
legal forms of intimidation.
The political atmosphere of the
'50's was not conducive to student
protest. The shadow of McCarthy
and his tactics hung over the
whole decade. Indeed, not since
the '30\s has American society had
to contend with a discontented
student population. The resurg
ence of student activty, while non
violent in nature, has been met
by authorities with force and in
timidation.
It is encouraging to note in
creasing student protest over the
reactionary policies behind racial
segregation, disclaimer affidavits
and loyalty oaths, and Ihc House
Un-American Activities Commit
tee. Student action against these
forces indicates a new sense of
democracy in this country.
We believe that such activity,
when undertaken with a sense of
responsibility, should be support
ed on all fronts. We therefore
express our confidence in the stu
dents who joined to demonstrate
their disapproval of the House
Un-American Activities Commit
tee and welcome this as symbolic
of a new and vital trend toward
student action in the 1960'5.

Immodest Proposal
Editor, the Daily:
The letter from Mr. Roger was
a testimony to everything that
the Un-American Committee stood
for narrow, infantile name-call
ing.
To speak of Communism as "an
ugly ogre haunting the face of
the globe'' and Khrushchev as
"the little round man behind the
Iron Curtain" is, if nothing else,
reminiscent of the Salem witch
days, when the Black Man was
said to lurk about every forest,
waiting for some evil-loving per
son to pass by.
