# Art Students: Studio House Will Be Open
## 
### 
A group of 25 qualified ad
vanced art students who plan on
attending the summer session will
now be able to enroll in a Studio
House.
The University has made a
large campus residence available
in order that these students may
live together throughout the sum
mer quarter.
Bay Area Artists
The students will also have the
advantage of contact with six
prominent Bay Region artists who
will each spend a day at Studio
House. They will function as crit
ics and their visits will be spaced
throughout the quarter.
Professor Matt Kahn, who will
be director of Studio House, is
particularly enthusiastic about
the visiting artists. He says the
Bay region is full of active artists
and critics and Studio House will
be able to tap this source in a way
in which conventional teaching is
unable.
The Art Department faculty on
the campus this summer will also
participate.
Admittance Requirements
To be admitted to the Studio
House program, students must be
registered for a minimum of 8
units in art for the summer quar
ter. These must include a mini
mum of 3 units in either Art 200
(individual work in drawing,
painting, or sculpture), or in Art
220 (individual work in design).
The Studio House membership
fee is $276.00 for the 8-week sum
mer quarter. This includes board
and room but not tuition.
