A Backward (ilance
After this week the Daily and the Pressbox close up shop after a
very interesting and exciting year of Stanford sports.
This week the Daily sports staff like all of newspaperdom's self
styled sports experts will select the Stanford athlete of the year,
the top athletes in each major sport, the coach of the year and the
outstanding frosh athlete. The At hlete-of-t he-Year story will be writ
ten by ex-sports editor Bob Payne of "On the Line" fame and will
come out on Friday so that Bob can get a head start before all dis
gruntled fans and athletes catch up to him. Stan Unlett will write
ihe Daily selection of Coach of the Year and Glenn Alford will tell
about the top frosh. This writer will pick the year's thrill of the year
in Farm sports, which seems to be a tradition.
Now 112 suppose it's time to review the year in sports as we saw
it from the Pressbox. We especially want to give pats on the back
to all the outstanding Card athletes who have played in their last
season for Stanford.
In the fall Stanford football

fans were treated to the greatest
offensive show in the Nation as
junior quarterback and sometime
All-Aiiierican ion Time and other
sports publication teams) Dick
Norman passed to seniors Chris
Biirford, Hen Robinson, Dick Bow
ers and John Bond and led the
nation in passing and total of
fense. In ten games Dick com
pleted 152 out of 263 pases for
3,963 yards and 11 touchdowns.
He added 55 more yards on the
ground to top the individual total
offense column with 2,018 yards.
Certainly Biirford will be re
membered as one of the outstand
ing Card receivers of all time.
He made nearly everybody's All-
American team and led the Nation
in receiving with sixty-one grabs
for 756 yards and scored six touch
downs. Bnrf was joined on the
other wing by Hobinson, in the
NCAA pass receiving stats at the
fourth spot. Koby grabbed 34 of
Norman's and Rod Sear's tosses

for 595 total yards. Needless to say. both Robinson and Burton! will
be sorely missed by Coach Jack Curtice next season.
Junior Skip Face also made national stats as he tied for second
in total scoring with an even hundred points. Both Face and Norman
will be back next year to lead the Tribe offensive show but certainly
the defense will have to improve. The one black spot in Stanford's
3-7 record was the worst defense in Stanford grid history. This situa
tion will definitely have to improve if Curtice is to got a winning
season next year.
In basketball we saw a year for improvement. John Arrillaga—
moved to guard this year teamed with junior Bub Bowling to a
•spotty 11-14 record in a season which can be best described as a
building one for Coach Howie Dallmar.
The big news in the Card cage season was the improvement of
front line men Neal Brockmeyer who wrestled the starting center
spot from sophomore John Windsor; Windsor, who came into his
own at forward; and John Hendry. Although big Brock will be lost
to Dallinar and the team next year due to graduation, both Windsor,
Hendry and Rich Ilosley should make Stanford's front line a formid
able one indeed. Bowling may team with John Font ins or Don Clem
etson at guard next year but the team will have to look far to replace
Arrillaga whose jump-shot was beauty to behold.
A Fine Guard Leaves
Arrillaga led the team in scoring with a 14.3 point per game
average and made the first string on the AAWC cage team. Of
course Stanford's record suffered due to injuries and a tough sched
ule that incuded powerhouses West Virginia and that old rival across
the Bay—California.
Although baseball didn't work out as well as many fans and
players would have liked certainly the performances of veteran sen
ior third-baseman Jim Burk, >larv Mecklenberg, .Alike Magee, and
the rapid finishing llal Scliutzinann made Coach Dutch Fell ring a
little happy. Certainly the number of sophomore players who gained
valuable experience this year e.g. Skip Lawrence, Rich Ferrazzano,
Pete Verdunian and Bob Overman will give Fehring a lot to work
with next year. Also the return of pitchers Jim Smith and Terry
Lindeman, outfielders John Hurlbut, Schiitzmami, C). J Solander,
Jim ( owart and Mike Filice when he wasn't playing shortstop
and others will greatly aid the Tribe cause next year.
As for track I'm afraid that besides congratulating Ernie Cun
lit'tV, the best 880 man in the country at present, and Jerry Winters,
one of the top college shot putters—that I will leave all the plaudits
to Dick Barnes tomorrow and next year's sports editor Ron Rapoport.
Good luck next year Ron.
