TILL WE MEET AGAIN
Today I conclude my sixth year of writing columns for the
makers of Marlboro and Philip Morris cigarettes. It lias been
my custom during these six years to make no attempt to lie
funny in this final column. (I have achieved this objective
many times during the year also, but never on purpose.) The
reasons for the lack of levity in this final column are two: first,
you are preparing for final exams and, short of holding you
down and tickling you, there is no way in the woijd to make you
laugh at this time; and, second, for many of us this is a leave
taking, and leave-takings, I think, ought not be flippant.
If I have brought you a moment or two of cheer during the
past year, I am rewarded. If I have persuaded you to try
Marlboro or Philip Morris cigarettes, you are rewarded.
Let me pause here to express my heartfelt gratitude to the
makers of Marlboro and Philip Morris. They have given me
complete freedom in the writing of these columns. There has
not been the slightest hint of censorship. They have never
changed so much as one comma in my cojjv. 1 wish to take this
occasion to state publicly that I am forever grateful to these
enlightened tobacconists and I hereby serve notice that if they
find it in their corporate heart to engage me for another year
of colunming, I shall require a substantial increase in salary.
The money is not what matters—not as money, that is, but
only as a token. I want to be assured that they love me as
much as I love Marlboro and Philip Morris. And what, indeed,
is not to love? Marlboro is a cigarette which proves beyond
cavil that flavor did not go out when filters came in. Philip
Morris is a cigarette that is pure mildness from lip-end to tip
end. Both of these estimable smokes come in soft-pack or
flip-top box. Neither is ever sold in bulk.

The summer lies ahead. For underclassmen summer will be
a hiatus, a breather in which to restore yourselves for next
year's resumption of busy college life. For seniors (here will
be no more college. You must not, however, despair and abandon
yourself to idleness. There are other things to do in the world
besides going to school—basket weaving, for example, or build
ing boats in bottles, or picking up tinfoil, or reading "War and
Peace." Many graduates fall into the erroneous belief that tlieir
lives :ire over when they leave college. This is not so. It is
possible to make some sort of life for yourself with a bit of
ingenuity ... or, if that fails, dye your hair, change your name,
and enroll at some other college.
Whatever the future holds for you, be assured that the makers
of Marlboro and Philip Morris join me in wishing you the best
of everything. We have taken great pleasure—the makers and
I in bringing you this column each week throughout the school
year. We hope a little pleasure has accrued to you too.
May good fortune attend your ventures. Stay happy. Stay
healthy. Stay loose.

funny in this final column. (I have achieved this objective
many times during the year also, but never on purpose.) The
reasons for the lack of levity in this final column are two: first,
you are preparing for final exams and, short of holding you
down and tickling you, there is no way in the woijd to make you
laugh at this time; and, second, for many of us this is a leave
taking, and leave-takings, I think, ought not be flippant.
If I have brought you a moment or two of cheer during the
past year, I am rewarded. If I have persuaded you to try
Marlboro or Philip Morris cigarettes, you are rewarded.
Let me pause here to express my heartfelt gratitude to the
makers of Marlboro and Philip Morris. They have given me
complete freedom in the writing of these columns. There has
not been the slightest hint of censorship. They have never
changed so much as one comma in my cojjv. 1 wish to take this
occasion to state publicly that I am forever grateful to these
enlightened tobacconists and I hereby serve notice that if they
find it in their corporate heart to engage me for another year
of colunming, I shall require a substantial increase in salary.
The money is not what matters—not as money, that is, but
only as a token. I want to be assured that they love me as
much as I love Marlboro and Philip Morris. And what, indeed,
is not to love? Marlboro is a cigarette which proves beyond
cavil that flavor did not go out when filters came in. Philip
Morris is a cigarette that is pure mildness from lip-end to tip
end. Both of these estimable smokes come in soft-pack or
flip-top box. Neither is ever sold in bulk.

The summer lies ahead. For underclassmen summer will be
a hiatus, a breather in which to restore yourselves for next
year's resumption of busy college life. For seniors (here will
be no more college. You must not, however, despair and abandon
yourself to idleness. There are other things to do in the world
besides going to school—basket weaving, for example, or build
ing boats in bottles, or picking up tinfoil, or reading "War and
Peace." Many graduates fall into the erroneous belief that tlieir
lives :ire over when they leave college. This is not so. It is
possible to make some sort of life for yourself with a bit of
ingenuity ... or, if that fails, dye your hair, change your name,
and enroll at some other college.
Whatever the future holds for you, be assured that the makers
of Marlboro and Philip Morris join me in wishing you the best
of everything. We have taken great pleasure—the makers and
I in bringing you this column each week throughout the school
year. We hope a little pleasure has accrued to you too.
May good fortune attend your ventures. Stay happy. Stay
healthy. Stay loose.

Today I conclude my sixth year of writing columns for the
