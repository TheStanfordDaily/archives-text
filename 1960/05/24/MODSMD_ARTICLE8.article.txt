# U.S. Charges Soviet Keeps Spy Network
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (/P>
The United States accused the So
viet Union last night of maintain
ing a vast spy network while try
ing to curb U.S. efforts to guard
against surprise Communist at
tack.
U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge made the charge in the
U.N. Security Council.
Ho was replying to a demand
from Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko that the United
States be condemned as an aggres
sor for aerial spying on Soviet ter
ritory. Gromyko warned that such
action ran the risk of kindling
the flames of World War 111.
"Grave < onsequeuces"
Unless immediate action is
taken by the U.N., Gromyko
asserted, "g r a v e consequences"
could result.
Lodge said that the Soviets
have thousands of spies every
where, and that since the death
of Stalin 360 actually had been
convicted in the free world.
"If it ever should be accepted
that the Soviet Union can main
tain a double standard while they
have thousands of spies every
where . . . then the free world
would surely be in peculiar dan
ger," Lodge asserted.
Galleries Jammed
He spoke for only 15 minutes
in comparison to an hour-long
speech by Gromyko. The galleries
in the Council chamber were
jammed with both diplomats and
ordinary spectators.
Gromyko denounced President
Eisenhower and accused the Unit
ed States of perfidy comparable
to that of Japanese diplomats in
Washington just prior to the
sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.
He called on the Council not
only to condemn the United States
as an aggressor for aerial spying,
but also to request that the Unit
ed States put an end to such
flights.
But Lodge denied that the Unit
ed States had committed any
aggressive acts" "against the So
viet Union or any other country,
either through its Air Force or
through any other agency of the
U.S. government."
Lodge Names Spies
Lodge named a dozen spies he
said were arrested in the United
States since the death of Stalin.
He said the United States in
addition to naming spies could
also bring up the presence of a
Soviet vessel off Long Island's
Montauk Point a few weeks ago
that was "deliberately interfering
with operations of the U.S. Navy."
He made these additional
points:
1. The United States has sus
pended spy flights similar to the
U2 spy plane downed over the
Soviet Union last May 1 and the
free world could only speculate
why the Soviet Union sought to
bring up the matter in the United
Nations.
2. The United States is prepared
to negotiate an open skies treaty
with the Soviet Union that would
obviate forever any need for
attempts at aerial espionage by
any nation.
Will Make Proposals
"At an appropriate time we in
tend to make proposals to get at
the heart of the matter and we
hope our proposals will prove con
structive," he added.
He denied the Soviet charges
as fallacious and said the United
Stales was glad of the chance to
air the issues involved in the
Council.

from Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko that the United
States be condemned as an aggres
sor for aerial spying on Soviet ter
ritory. Gromyko warned that such
action ran the risk of kindling
the flames of World War 111.
"Grave < onsequeuces"
Unless immediate action is
taken by the U.N., Gromyko
asserted, "g r a v e consequences"
could result.
Lodge said that the Soviets
have thousands of spies every
where, and that since the death
of Stalin 360 actually had been
convicted in the free world.
"If it ever should be accepted
that the Soviet Union can main
tain a double standard while they
have thousands of spies every
where . . . then the free world
would surely be in peculiar dan
ger," Lodge asserted.
Galleries Jammed
He spoke for only 15 minutes
in comparison to an hour-long
speech by Gromyko. The galleries
in the Council chamber were
jammed with both diplomats and
ordinary spectators.
Gromyko denounced President
Eisenhower and accused the Unit
ed States of perfidy comparable
to that of Japanese diplomats in
Washington just prior to the
sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.
He called on the Council not
only to condemn the United States
as an aggressor for aerial spying,
but also to request that the Unit
ed States put an end to such
flights.
But Lodge denied that the Unit
ed States had committed any
aggressive acts" "against the So
viet Union or any other country,
either through its Air Force or
through any other agency of the
U.S. government."
Lodge Names Spies
Lodge named a dozen spies he
said were arrested in the United
States since the death of Stalin.
He said the United States in
addition to naming spies could
also bring up the presence of a
Soviet vessel off Long Island's
Montauk Point a few weeks ago
that was "deliberately interfering
with operations of the U.S. Navy."
He made these additional
points:
1. The United States has sus
pended spy flights similar to the
U2 spy plane downed over the
Soviet Union last May 1 and the
free world could only speculate
why the Soviet Union sought to
bring up the matter in the United
Nations.
2. The United States is prepared
to negotiate an open skies treaty
with the Soviet Union that would
obviate forever any need for
attempts at aerial espionage by
any nation.
Will Make Proposals
"At an appropriate time we in
tend to make proposals to get at
the heart of the matter and we
hope our proposals will prove con
structive," he added.
He denied the Soviet charges
as fallacious and said the United
Stales was glad of the chance to
air the issues involved in the
Council.
