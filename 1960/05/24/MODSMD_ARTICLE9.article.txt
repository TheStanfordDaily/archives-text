up by Dr. Wasserstrom. "Power
today depends on who is given the

"The strongest criticism of this
method of determining sovereign
ty is the difficulty of being able
to find a single source of power
in a society." he said.
The question of who the sover
eign should be was also brought
up by Dr. Wasserstrom. "Power
today depends on who is given the

opportunity to use the instru
ments of force which we associate
with the political state," he said.
"Sovereigns are made not born
today because the power of who
ever can get hold of instruments
of force is multiplied many
times."
Wasserstrom is currently teach
ing Philosophy of Law, and will
teach Ihe Law School Jurispru
dence course summer quarter.

of his own. He must go on farther
and must find a positive way of
relating to other people." *
She cites submission to a higher
power, domination of his environ
ment and attachment to family or
elan as Fromm's major methods
of achieving this.
The discussion, entitled "Escape
to Freedom," was the final meet

series.
