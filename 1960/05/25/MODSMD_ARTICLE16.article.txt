# History of Class of 1960

In September of 1956, a large
group of graduated high school
•seniors from all over the United
States and various foreign coun
tries arrived in swarms on the
Stanford campus.
We were loaded down with
stuffed animals, desk lamps, golf
clubs, and too many clothes; with
intentions, advice, doubts, and
soaring dreams for the four years
of LIFE which we were beginning
thai day. We were the Class of
Nineteen hundred and sixty.
During that year of 1956, the
Class of 1960 got to know itself.
We wasted no time relaxing and
taking in our new surroundings.
Pre-reg reached out its claws
and herded, lectured, and enter
tained us through a week of ori
entation. We found out what an
"exchange" was, and we learned
that Hoover Tower and the Cam
panile were not one and the same
thing.
"Jolly-Lipped"
We "jolly-upped" and wore
"used" instead of "new" Stanford
jackets. We received green sheets
that informed us we were part of
a new, improved General Studies
Program. We went to the homes
of faculty members and, after five
minutes of reception-line-conver
sation, stood in corners nursing
cups of punch.
Then, it all began to slow down,
and one warm evening in Frost
Amphitheater, we sat before some
of the members of the Stanford
faculty and sang the Stanford
Hymn.
Soon classes began, we left pre
liminaries behind us. and began to
study. Western Civ and English
themes, typed faithfully each
week at two o'clock in the morn
ing, occupied a large portion of
our time, but Autumn Quarter
was football season, and this,
among other things, was easily
fitted into our new seven a.m. to
one a.m. schedules.
Football at Stanford was never
Ihe same as it was that freshman
year. We did not win the Big
Game, nor did we go to the Rose
Bowl, but Chuck Taylor and his
varsity team gave students and
fans games that were thrilling to
watch!
Prematurely Burned
Big Game was spectacular that
year. John Brodie received an
All-American Award, and the Big
Game Bonfire, built by Ihe Class
of '60, was prematurely burned to
the ground. This was the first
time since 1928 (and before that,
since the tradition had begun),
that the fire had been successfully
lighted ahead of schedule.
The blaze was predicted by
some to be Stanford's last when
freshmen of the Class of '60 set
a truck driven by invaders from
Menlo College on fire. Not only
did the freshmen have to combat
outside forces from Menlo Col
lege, several attempts to light the
fire were also made by Stanford
upperclassmen, who, to quote The
Daily, were "full of spare energy,
not to mention extra spirits."
Thursday before the Friday
rally, the freshmen men, sacrific
ing Thanksgiving dinners, began
an all-out drive to rebuild the fire,
and the second fire was officially
lighter! as planned at the Big
flame Rally.
( lass Officers
In the fall, we also elected class
officers. Someone named Wally
Ilawley plastered his name on a
convertible in front of Roble Hall
and became President of the class.
With the help of Kay German,
our Vice-President, and Jim Stan
ley, Business Manager, the Class
of '60 sold Class Cards to <S9.s'<
of its members, created a larger
treasury than any previous class,
and promised four years of activi
ties and fun.
The first of these was a Class
party held in the Women's Gym.
The theme was "Anything Goes,"
and the Stardusters provided mu
sic for the first class function.
Later on. we hold a Triad ex
change at Wilbur Hall with the

University of California and San
Jose State College, and in the
spring, a class beach party was
held.
Football season passed, and so
did most of us. Winter came with
rain and supposedly more time to
study. Some of us plunged into
our books with renewed ambition,
and some of u« did not.
Studying was postponed, for a
short time, at least, when eating
clubs and fraternities began for
mal rushing.
Bookstore Lines
After the hectic days of the be
ginning of the Quarter, and Ihe
bookstore lines had vanished, the
annual Winter Charity Drive be
gan. One outstanding contribu
tion of the Class of 1960 was Pete
Donnelly who, with the help of
Branner women, was elected "Ug
liest Man on Campus," and whose
votes represented $117.79 for the
Winter Charity Drive.
That freshman year, Ihe Stan
ford Medical School was still a
sketch on a page in the Quad, and
tuition was about to be raised to
help make it a reality. Eisenhower
was re-elected President of the
United States, and the Hungarian
revolt occurred.
Stanford's William Shockley
won the Nobel Prize for physics,
and, at the same lime, Leo the
Lion was "blasted into immortal
ity" in the front yard of the SAE
House.
College life presented many
new experiences to its youngest
class. Among some of these ex
periences were fire drills, cellar
coffee, overnights, and "extra-cur
ricular activities."
Activities
Rally Com, the Political Union,
The"I" Center, the Tuesday Eve
ning Series, and the Concert Se
ries. the Ski Club, the Alpine Club.
Gaieties and Ram's Hear!, the
Chappie Staff, ROTC, KZSU, and
Phi Beta Kappa were a few of
them.
We entered them! We learned
to study and to play, and we
learned some things we never
knew existed before. Then, we
went home for summer vacation.
In 1957, Howie Anawalt as
President, Carol Conroy as Vice-
President, and Dave Fisher as
Business Manager became the
new officers of the Sophomore
Class.
The Sophomore Cotilion, plan
ned by the Ex-Com. was one of
the highlights of the year for the
whole campus. The theme was
"Something in the Wind," and
people enjoyed dancing to the mu
sic of Jack Fisher and listening
to entertainment by the Four
Freshmen.
Sophomore women moved to
Lagunita and other dormitories,
while the men moved from Wil
bur to residences all over the cam
pus and the Palo Alto area. The
Administration announced a new
policy for fraternities that includ
ed a "cluster system" of resi
dences.
Regained the Axe
That year, we won ihe Big
Game and regained the Axe, but
we lost Coach Chuck Taylor, gain
ing Jack Curtice as new head foot
ball coach.
Eleanor Roosevelt, Claire Booth
Luce, and Frank Lloyd Wright
visited ihe campus, while students
demonstrated against nuclear
tests in the spring.
Also in the spring, "back to na
ture movements" were occurring
among the students, and a "battle
at sea" took place on Lake Lag
between a group of Stanford men
in a tugboat, the "Aquawazoo,"
and several aggressors in home
made rafts. Everyone went over
board while "Victory at Sea" was
played on Hi-Fi from the boat
house, and the tugboat sank.
Then, suddenly, as quickly as the
year had come, it passed, and we
were juniors.
As Juniors, many of us were
finishing up General Studies re
quirements and changing our ma
jors. We had completed half our
college life, and were beginning

to think more-seriously about the
years ahead.
Stanford had opened a campus
in Germany, and several members
of the Class of 1960 were at Stutt
gart studying and learning to live
in a foreign country.
The Junior Class led by Mike
Immell as President, Sara Good
win as Vice-President, and Bill
Bailey. Business Manager, hired
Billy May for the Junior Prom,
and at Ihe Sophomore-Junior Ski
Weekend at the Yosemite Lodge,
listened to songs by June Christi.
Spring passed with Spring Sing,
the opening of the"I" Center out
door cafe, and the second wave
of the Asian Flu. We filled Ihe
Pavilion to hear the Kingston
Trio.
The Homestretch
Then the Class of 1960 began
the homestretch, its senior year.
Now we went to Senior Happy
Hours legally, or still stood out
side the fence at Rossotti's for the
first few weeks of the year until
that climactic twenty-first birth
day finally came.
Many of us now are turning
eyes to the future again, as we
did four years ago, only this time
not to college applications, but to
the Placement Service, weddings,
the Army and the Navy, and to
graduate schools.
Jim Allen was elected President
of the Class with Sally Drinker as
Vice-President and Smith Ketch
um. Business Manager. They
planned the Senior Bail with Nel
son Riddle, the popular Smug
gler's banjo band from San Fran
cisco's Red Garter, and the Four
Freshmen.
They warned us that graduation
announcements and pr o g r a m s
would not be on sale indefinitely
and that Full Moon nights were
running short.
Khrushchev Visit
This year, Khrushchev visited
San Francisco, and. in the face of
a coming Presidential election,
Vice-President Nixon and Senator
Kennedy spoke on the campus to
future voters.
The old Post Office was de
stroyed. and with its replacement
came many other new develop
ments and innovations. The Medi
cal School, no longer a sketch on
a page in the Quad, went into full
operation, and its hospital opened.
The new Bookstore eliminated
the institution of book lines, and
a New Student Union began form
ing plans and committees. Palm
Drive was changed to a maze of
one-way streets, and Stanford an
nounced the opening of Stanford
in France and Stanford in Italy.
Among the innovations of the
Stanford campus was Kartozian,
"an ideal, not a man," as his cam
paign posters claimed. He ran for
every office, and, having won
many of them in the primary elec
tions, including several women's
offices, lie decided (with the per
suasion of the Legislature) to run
for one office, Head Yell Leader.
He won the election and the
hearts of "sports-apathetic stu
dents" who all end e d football
games probably as much to watch
Kartozian and Dr. James Wat kins,
the Most Rod-Hot Professor, as

the Stanford team.
The Heritage Fund Committee
began its annual collection of
scholarships for next year's fresh
men students and surpassed the
Class of '59 and its own goal of
$20,000.
Before this, the traditional sen
ior Olympic Day reunion held its
annual relay race to the Alpine
Inn, more commonly known as
Rossotti's, with Jim Allen and
Rich Sundeen (ASSU President*,
running the last laps. This event
set the pace for many Senior
Happy Hours to come.
The "happy hours" on the Stan
ford campus, however, are thaw
ing to a close for most of us. We
have gained many things in our
Stanford experience, among them,
a better awareness of ourselves,
our world, and the roles we must
play.
We have grown, experienced,
and felt life in different ways, but
all of us, because of this experi
ence. are changed from the wide
eyed graduating high school sen
iors we were when we arrived
here.
We have many things to re
member; certain teachers, places,
and ideals, and some things we
cannot classify like the service in
the RBR and Heidi. President
Sterling's flog, standing in the li
brary fountain looking for her
tennis ball. The Class of 1960 is
graduating and passing on, but
part of Stanford University will
leave with it.
