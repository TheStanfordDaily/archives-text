# Class of 1960 Will
## 
### Jim Freed 
As wo, the Class of 1960, look
forward to our passing and back
upon the four years of our brief
life, we proclaim this last will and
testament to be the final disposi
tion of our acquired fortune.
We leave with the fervent hope
that the heritage of our years will
come alive through the bequeathal
of our property to the classes who
will soon reach our revered
heights. We are deeply indebted
to our life al Stanford University
and feel that our gratitude will be
adequately expressed in this, our
last will and testament.
We began our youth at Stanford
ably directed by the mother of all
freshmen, the pre-rcg committee.

With 1 hanks in our hearts we
were initiated into our new life
in the community and due to the
masterful organization of our pa
rent, few of us were able to find
the Quad until it was too late.
Here we express our first vote
of thanks and we leave this excel
lent model to the intellectual lead
ers of our class who we must sad
ly bequeath to the Class of 1961.
Our precious incubators, Wil
bur, Branner and Roble, must re
main behind and these we graci
ously present to the Stanford
School of Architecture and add
that they must be shared with all
future students of criminology.
As we grew, our thirst for the
intellectual quest became exceed
ingly difficult to satisfy and
though we are unable to leave be
hind the nourishment, the bottles
and utensils must be properly dis
tributed. It is a rare member of
any graduating class whose heart
is not torn when departing from
our intellectual dinner table, the
Reserve Book Room. It was in this
sacred hall that a young student
was able to escape from wordly
realities and here he refreshed his
mind, surrounded by the requi
sites of solemnity, peace, quiet,
solitude and remorse.
Luxury Shop
We bequeath this trough to all
those who will feed at it. Our
utensils were purchased from the
inexhaustible Waives of the book
store. With some degree of regret
we now see this famed institution
being replaced. The new luxury
•shop, while available to us in our
last quarter, came at a lime when
few members of the Class Of 1960
had much use for its produce.
This, however, we leave to future
students to make of it what they
will.
With maturity and old age came
the sudden realization that much
of what we could hand down to
our progeny would consist of the
memories and experiences that
have gone into our lives and pre
pared us for our demise.
We will and bequeath the mem
ory of those who. at peril to life
and limb, walked, not rode, into
the blitz that was Inner Quad.
May their bravery serve as an in
spiration to the pedestrian world.
We will the bicycle brigade either
to a new and revived Stanford
Freikorps or the French Army;
whichever soms most in need.
To all Stanford students we be
queath those elements which have
gone into making ihe toddler into
the mature, intelligent Stanford
individual.
Library Fountain
To the Intellectual leaders of
the future we will those hours of
frolicking jvith Heidi in the library
fountain which are part of the
essential make-up of any young
sophisticate.
To ihe scientists wo offer Lake
Lagunita— the mecca of the bac
teriologists.
The Stanford parking system
we leave to future university fac
ulties and administrations as a
perfect example of how a general
studies program is conducted.
We will the Senior Happy
Hours to those who thirst — for
knowledge.
These are the elements which
have gone into making us the un
witting and unprepared middle
roaders of the future.
The last gift is. to each of us,
the most important and it is with
some regret that we bestow it
upon our successors. To future
generations we leave the gift that
we have called by the name of
Stanford.
This name has meant much

more than a single classroom, dor
mitory or bookstore. It has been
a way of life that has given us a
sense of community and pride un
known to us in the past. We have
changed a great deal in these four
brief years and this force we call
Stanford has set its mark upon
us and made of us what we are.
We owe it a sincere debt of
gratitude and respect which we
can fulfill only by bestowing it
with pride upon those who will
replace us. We ask only that they
treat it with care and the sense of
duty which is necessary in order
for it to serve them as it has
served us.
