Though harsh and massive stone
Have held us here together,
We have remained apart,
Alike in lacking art,
Or wisdom, to atone
Much academic bother.
And much of this was waste.
Though brute, unmeasured haste,
And inconclusive thought,
Suffice for who have sought
Some trivial social grace,
Or trade, leave not this place
Content; O let the mind,
Incisive, querulous,
Be tough the undefined
Yields slowly, yet men learn.
In knowledge, may we earn
Some shift from nothingness.
