# THE Finish Line
## U.S. Mile of the Century 
### Dick Barnes 
Dyrol Burleson will regain a measure of mile glory for- tho United
Slates Saturday in Modesto when he edges Australia's Herb Klliott
in American record time of 3:57.6.
At least, that's The Finish Line prediction.
The best match race since liannistcr-Landy, and certainly the host
in U.S. history will begin at 8:30, the featured event at the California
Relays. It matches the two-year world record holder and acknowl
edged best-ever miler against a slim Oregon sophomore who seems
to have all the tools necessary to inherit the Elliott mantle.
The race gains added spice in that it is an almost-certain preview
of the Olympic (lames 1500-meter final in slightly more than three
months.
If ever a race seemed assured of a fast final lap, this is it. lOlliott
blazed a last quarter in 55.4 en route to his 3:54.5 world record. Bur
leson always waits until his last quarter before turning on the steam.
Against Lrnie ( unllffe, he ripped off a 57.4 to produce a 3:58.0.
Burleson is strictly a pace-follower who runs only to win. Elliott,
however, is as fully at home setting a pace as he is following one.
Burleson will undoubtedly force Elliott to take the lead, and it seems
likely that the Aussie will try to shake the Oregonian with a blister
ing second or third lap at least that's the strategy he's used against
other noted kickers.
Burleson, since leaving high school, has never been shaken from
a pace, so there's no telling how fast a one he can stay with. The
only times he has ever lost were when he kicked into the lead and
then let up before the tape. He says he has learned now to kick all
the way through.
The Finish Lino pi edict ion is not based solely on the notion that
Burleson is the new world champ. Granted he may be by the end
of the summer, but there are as yet no grounds for a valid com
parison. Elliott, however, does not seem as far along in conditioning
this year. Burleson has been under four this spring. Elliott has run
only one serious race and it only a week ago. And Elliott isn't as
serious about running as he was before he married.
It looks from here, admittedly based on last month's look at
Burleson, like he can stay with the pace Elliott will set. and that he
will be able to out kick him sufficiently to win by somewhere be
tween two and five yards..
