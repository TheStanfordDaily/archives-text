While that race is an Olympic preview in one event, Stanford area
track fans will get a pre-Rome look at every event, at least from the
U.S. standpoint, in the men's final Olympic Trials at Stanford Sta
dium July 1-2.
America's finest track and field menâ€”l 3 to 15 in each of IT events
will fight for one of the top three berths in their specialty and
tho accompanying ticket to Rome.
A list of the outstanding stars expected to he on hand would take
pages suffice to say, then, that world records in every event except
the hop-step-jump, steeplechase and 5000 meters will be in degrees
of danger ranging from near-certain to moderate.
The Stanford facilities, including training track, athletes quarters
and weather conditions should be the finest the trials have ever seen.
In addition, and this is a bit of a surprise, attendance looks like it
might top tiie 60-plus thousand that saw the '56 meet in Los Angeles,
Reservations are nearing the 50.000 mark for the two days, and
the meet is still more than five weeks away. A note to prospective
ticket buyers (who may pick up applications at the Athletic Depart
ment): the Friday session is a twilight meet, the Saturday session
is in the afternoon. Finals in eight events will be held the first day.
and nine the second.
