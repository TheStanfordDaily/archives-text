# Cunliffe Stanford's Best Bet
## 
### 
Turning to a local angle, what are Stanford's chances of placing
men on the I .S. team? As ol now, the answer looks like Ernie Cun
lit'fe. Everyone must know by now that he is the world's leading
half-miler this year, and third-fastest of all time.
Early in the season, it looked like the 1500 might turn out to be
his best race. But events of the past months have proven that Cun
liffe has a far better chance to place high in the U.S. and Rome in
the 800 meters.
In the mile, he has developed into a rabbit. It's fine for the fans,
who see a fast race when CunJiffe pulls his opponents (Burleson
and Tabori) along to great times. But Cunliffe simply does not have
the back-breaking kick to hold off outstanding runners at four laps.
In the half, however, his kick is both greatly improved over last
year and strong enough for all competition. If he doesn't get excited
and run the first lap in 50 flat, Cunliffe should win the trials over
.Murphy and Carroll and Siebert and Walters and all the rest.
Stanford should have two others at the trials John Kelly and
Jerry Winters. Kelly has placed in the NCAA and AAU hop-step
jump for two years, and should get a sufficient enough place to
bring him to the trials ibis year. It would take a minor miracle for
him to make it over 51 feet and onto the team, however.
Winters is almost the best collegiate shot-putter in the country,
and could even be in the first three at the NCAA meet: Except for
Dallas Long, however, the nation's outstanding men aren't in college
competition. But they'll be at the trials in full force, shunting the
collegians (except for Long) down to the also-ran category.
Speaking of the Olympics the bookstore now has on sale two
styles of the official summer Olympics lapel pin. "Official" is a term
that often gets used where it shouldn't, but this isn't one of those
times. The blue and gold rectangular pin is strictly legitimate, and
is the official souvenir pin for the Games. At Squaw Valley, Olympic
pins were quite the rage, even to the point that one collector turned
flown several thousand dollar* for his hatful. A liberal percentage
of the $1 and $2 purchase price goes to help send the United States
team to Rome. From what we've heard, lots of Stanford people will
be in Koine come Olympics time it might be a good idea to pick up
a pin now, so you'll be strictly "in."

This, for once and for all (there was a false stop last spring)
concludes Ibe I* inish Line. 'I he race has been going on for three
years (except for this falli, and it's been kicks. But at this point
the typewriter and 1 have hit The Finish Line.
