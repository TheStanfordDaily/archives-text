# Darrell Sutherland Named Freshman Athlete of Year
## 
### Glenn Alford 
Choosing the freshman athlete
of the year was no real problem.
Only one freshman was a first
stringer in two major sports. This
was Darrell Sutherland, a guard
forward on the basketball team,
and a baseball pitcher.
Sutherland came to Stanford
with quite a reputation as a has
jketball and baseball player at
' Glendale High School. He had
been named CIF basketball player
of the year in his senior year, and
had made the all-CIF baseball
team for two years in a row.
Darrell Catches Fire
The basketball season started,
and Darrell played steadily, but
wasn't near the scorer he was sup
posed to be. All of a sudden he
i caught fire, breaking into double
figures several times before the
close of the season.
He capped his freshman basket
' ball career by scoring 24 points
against Cal. Sutherland was the
leading scorer with a 12.6 aver
age. and shot a good 46 per cent.
As a baseball player, he came
into his first game as a relief
pitcher, without having more than
a week of practice, and shut out
heavy-hitting San Jose State for
five innings before getting the
win.
Three Close Defeats
He finished the season with a
5-3 record and a 2.91 earned run
average. Of his three loses, one
came to Cal. by two runs, and the
other two were against Santa
Clara.
Sutherland was by no means
1 the only fine freshman athlete. In
football, S t eve PI a v e r, Starr

I Rounds, and Mick Doherty are
varsity prospects. Don Clemet
son and Bob Summers were fine
basketball players. Bob Hensler
is a definite threat to make the
! varsity baseball team next year.
Phil White and John Haynie stood
out all season on the frosh track
team.
In minor sports, Bill Burley,
tennis; Cappy Hurst, golf; and
Roberto Santa-Cruz and Bob Cor
mack in soccer were all freshman
standouts, but above them all
stands Darrell Sutherland, the
freshman athlete of the year.
