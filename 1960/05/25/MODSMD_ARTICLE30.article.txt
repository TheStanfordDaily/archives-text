# Sad Sam Hurls Giants Into First Place
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA </»»> Sam
Jones last night pitched the San
Francisco Giants into first place
in the National League wtih a 1-0
shutout over the Philadelphia
Phillies as he won his first road
game in six starts.

The victory, coupled with Pitts
burgh's 12 loss to Los Angeles,
moved the Giants eight percent
age points ahead of the Pirates.
Jones gave up only four hits
land didn't walk a man. He k»-
I tired the last 15 men in order to
1 make his record 5-3.
