Wave after towering wave,
ranging as high as 20 feet, un
leashed fury on 25 communities.
At least 10 were inundated.
The waves left havoc and chaos
along the rugged coast, stretch
ing like a bow for 500 miles from
Kushiro, Hokkaido, to Shiogama
on Japan's main island of Hon
shu.
A survivor at Onagawa. one of
the hard hit towns in northern
Honshu, said: "As dawn began
breaking across the horizon we
saw the tide recede. It kept re
ceding. We realized it was a tidal
wave so we dashed for the hills.
Two hours later we returned. Our
homes were a mass of debris but
we saved our lives."
An eight-foot tidal wave lashed
U.S.-administered Okinawa in the
Ryukyus south of Japan. It left
three dead, 1,000 homes flooded,
and hundreds of acres of rice pad
dies blanketed with salt water.
