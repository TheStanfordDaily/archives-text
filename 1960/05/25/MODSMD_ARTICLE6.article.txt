# Sequoia Protests
## 
### 

Staff members of Sequoia, Stanford's Literary Magazine, picketed
the Bookstore this morning during their first day of sales. The
pieketers passed out circulars stating that the Bookstore asks for
a ten cent cut per copy for handling the magazine, whereas Kepler's
Bookstore and the Cellar ask for only a nickel. The picketer's
sandwich board reading "Stanford Bookstore Unfair" and "Kepler's
Cares" was complemented with a collapsible top hat. Above Karen
Williams takes her turn at the picket line.
