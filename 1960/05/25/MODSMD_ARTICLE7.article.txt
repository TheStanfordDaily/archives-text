# WASHINGTON INVESTIGATION
## Senate to Conduct Hearing Inquiry About Spy Plane 
### 
WASHINGTON (/Pi Without a dissent, the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee agreed yesterday to open Friday "an objective, im
partial inquiry" into the spy plane incident and other events culmi
nating in the summit breakdown.
Announcing this, Chairman J. William Fulbright (D-Ark) stressed

every effort will be made to keep
politics out of the closed-door in
quiry which will begin with Sec
retary of State Christian A. Her
ter.
These other things happened:
The National Security Council,
with President Eisenhower in the
chair, held a two-hour special
meeting.
Speaking in a TV interview on
NBC-Today, Sen. John F. Kenne
dy contended that if Eisenhower
had expressed regret, and the
East-West talks then foundered,
the responsibility would more
clearly have rested on Khrush
chev.
As Fulbright outlined them, the
Senate hearings will last a mat
ter of days and will be conducted
much like the celebrated Senate
probe nine years ago after Presi
dent Harry S. Truman stripped
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur of his
Korea War command.
During the 1951 Mac Arthur in
quiry, censored transcripts were
made public after the testimony
had been screened for security.
All members of the Senate will
be invited to sit in, but question
ing will be reserved for members

of the committee.
There was no discussion of
whether to summon White House
press secretary James C. Hagerty,
Fulbright told questioners, but
the committee "didn't foreclose on
l ho calling of anyone."
He didn't rule out the possi
bility that the committee might
question Arllai E. Stevenson, twice
a Democratic presidential candi
date, although Fulbright said he
didn't see any purpose in this.
Stevenson is the target of con
siderable .Republican fire for say
ing that Eisenhower administra
tion bungling, as he termed it,
put summit wrecking tools in
Khrushchev's hands.
GOP senators also went after
Stevenson for a presummit inter
view in which a Paris newspaper
quoted him as suggesting con
cessions might be made to the
Soviets on Berlin. Stevenson ac
knowledged talking to reporter
Robert Bo u lay at his Illinois
home, but said his views were
misrepresented.
Fulbright indicated the commit
tee conceivably might call Bou
lay, who has stood on his story.
