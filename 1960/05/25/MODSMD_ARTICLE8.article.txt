Members of the Stanford family, may I present
SIPSIM. the year-old creation of the Graduate
School of Business and International Industrial
Development Center of SRI.
Stanford International Program in Small Indus
try Management was initiated last July and is a
pioneer in management training. It is designed to
provide candidates for newly developing countries
with an intensive 6-month course in American
management principles and their relationship to
economic development.
Thirty Participants
Thirty participants from over 13 countries are
expected to take part in the program this year,
according to co-director Frank K. Shallenberger of
the Business School. They will live in Hurlburt.
SIPSIM is another Stanford first, as it is the
first formal course in American management tech
niques for a group representing various countries.
Correspondingly, requirements for acceptance
to the program are high. Candidates are required
to have several years of experience in industry or
in industrial development organizations; be em
ployed as owner-manager, managing director or
operating partner in a small manufacturing com
pany; or administrator or technician in a govern
mental or private organization that offers advis
ory services to small industry.
Proficiency in written and spoken English is
naturally also required.
Course Divided
The course is divided into two sections: the first
which will be from June 22, to Sept. 18, is for
managers and counselors and the second from
Sept. 19, to Dec. 9. is for counselors only.
The first section of the course is divided into
three sections. During the first two months, the
participants have classes which cover accounting
and control, production, marketing, small business

finance, industrial relations and small business
managements.
These courses are given by professors in tlie
Business School and experts from SRI.
Following the courses, the participants are sent
out into the field for personal observation of small
industries at work. They serve one to three week
internships in plants after which they return to
campus for a week of seminars.
The second part of the course covers counseling
techniques and industrial development organiza
tions. Arrangements similar to those made during
the first part of the program are made for intern
ships with various types of advisory services and
development organizations.
Most existing training programs for men from
newly developing areas stress industrial technol
ogy as opposed to management procedures.
SIPSIM is designed to help alleviate scarsity of
management skills and facilities to develop these
skills.
Tuition Expo use
Tuition $1,000 for 3 months and $1,800 for 6
months plus travel expenses and room and board
while here make it impossible for the individuals
to pay for the program.
Recognized interest anrl realization of the need
for management training is evident in the funds
made available by Asia Foundation, international
cooperation and governments to help assist par
ticipants.
SIPSIM succeeded in stimulating interest in this
field as is shown by the fact that three such cen
ters Hong Kong, Mexico City and Tokyo are
now operating as a result of its first session last
summer.
The program will be under the co-direction of
Dr. A. Eugene Staley. senior international econo
mist. 11 DC. and Shallenberger, professor of indus
trial management. Course oordinalor is Donald
R. LiiJLclt. research analyst, SIU.

Members of the Stanford family, may I present
SIPSIM. the year-old creation of the Graduate
School of Business and International Industrial
Development Center of SRI.
Stanford International Program in Small Indus
try Management was initiated last July and is a
pioneer in management training. It is designed to
provide candidates for newly developing countries
with an intensive 6-month course in American
management principles and their relationship to
economic development.
Thirty Participants
Thirty participants from over 13 countries are
expected to take part in the program this year,
according to co-director Frank K. Shallenberger of
the Business School. They will live in Hurlburt.
SIPSIM is another Stanford first, as it is the
first formal course in American management tech
niques for a group representing various countries.
Correspondingly, requirements for acceptance
to the program are high. Candidates are required
to have several years of experience in industry or
in industrial development organizations; be em
ployed as owner-manager, managing director or
operating partner in a small manufacturing com
pany; or administrator or technician in a govern
mental or private organization that offers advis
ory services to small industry.
Proficiency in written and spoken English is
naturally also required.
Course Divided
The course is divided into two sections: the first
which will be from June 22, to Sept. 18, is for
managers and counselors and the second from
Sept. 19, to Dec. 9. is for counselors only.
The first section of the course is divided into
three sections. During the first two months, the
participants have classes which cover accounting
and control, production, marketing, small business

finance, industrial relations and small business
managements.
These courses are given by professors in tlie
Business School and experts from SRI.
Following the courses, the participants are sent
out into the field for personal observation of small
industries at work. They serve one to three week
internships in plants after which they return to
campus for a week of seminars.
The second part of the course covers counseling
techniques and industrial development organiza
tions. Arrangements similar to those made during
the first part of the program are made for intern
ships with various types of advisory services and
development organizations.
Most existing training programs for men from
newly developing areas stress industrial technol
ogy as opposed to management procedures.
SIPSIM is designed to help alleviate scarsity of
management skills and facilities to develop these
skills.
Tuition Expo use
Tuition $1,000 for 3 months and $1,800 for 6
months plus travel expenses and room and board
while here make it impossible for the individuals
to pay for the program.
Recognized interest anrl realization of the need
for management training is evident in the funds
made available by Asia Foundation, international
cooperation and governments to help assist par
ticipants.
SIPSIM succeeded in stimulating interest in this
field as is shown by the fact that three such cen
ters Hong Kong, Mexico City and Tokyo are
now operating as a result of its first session last
summer.
The program will be under the co-direction of
Dr. A. Eugene Staley. senior international econo
mist. 11 DC. and Shallenberger, professor of indus
trial management. Course oordinalor is Donald
R. LiiJLclt. research analyst, SIU.
