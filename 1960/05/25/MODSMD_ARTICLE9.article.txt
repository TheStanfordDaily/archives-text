# NEW CHAPPIE ISSUE
## Crash Comics Boosts Gross National Product 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
Crash Comics are upon us again. Many of its staunch supporters
will be disappointed to know that it doesn't have a chance of being
banned on the campus or in Palo Alto ("The Boston of the West").
This is not because they aren't trying.
I just, showed a copy to an econ major I know, who pronounced it

"a significant contribution to the
gross national product." But it's
been grosser.
The same old comics are paro
died. "The Prone Ranger" has a
cute trick ending. "Little Orphan
Anita" is a cleaned-up title for
the most pseudo-licentious theme.
"Dunald Duck" lays an egg.
Political Opinions
John Frankenstein shows his
political opinions, and his wit, in
the "Dick Tricky" strip. Appar
ently he is left of the right, but
not in the center. Maybe he is a
member of the Sahl-for-president
movement. Don't read it too fast
to catch the allusion to the man
who erected a prominent campus
landmark.
The dead week queen, Ceci
Witt man, is an all-timer, and the
glossed-over fact that she used
to work for the Daily is a fact
indeed.
The cartoon on page nine, show
ing a double-decker privvy with
faculty upstairs and students be
low, is a clever idea. That's prob
ably why it appeared in Mad over
a year ago. (It was a fraternity
head then, with actives above and
pledges on the ground floor. But
plagarism is becoming a regular
faeel of college life, with so many
term papers due all the time.)
C'hoppable Doiuli
Back to the parodies: Dondi,
the most choppable character in
comics today, gets only one four
frame line. Perhaps the old boy
thought he might lose his ham
mer in all that mush.
On the other hand, Charlie
Brown makes the venerable pages
of the Chappie in two separate
places. Neither rises to the
heights of great satire. I guess
it's hard to ridicule something
that is funny in the first place.
Oh, I almost forgot "World's
Finest Tails." Captain Marbles,
Stuporman, and Fratman (for
merly Batman). I haven't been
able to forget it yet, but I'll keep
trying. The whole thing is a pre
lude to one (barfl pun.

The dead week queen, Ceci
Witt man, is an all-timer, and the
glossed-over fact that she used
to work for the Daily is a fact
indeed.
The cartoon on page nine, show
ing a double-decker privvy with
faculty upstairs and students be
low, is a clever idea. That's prob
ably why it appeared in Mad over
a year ago. (It was a fraternity
head then, with actives above and
pledges on the ground floor. But
plagarism is becoming a regular
faeel of college life, with so many
term papers due all the time.)
C'hoppable Doiuli
Back to the parodies: Dondi,
the most choppable character in
comics today, gets only one four
frame line. Perhaps the old boy
thought he might lose his ham
mer in all that mush.
On the other hand, Charlie
Brown makes the venerable pages
of the Chappie in two separate
places. Neither rises to the
heights of great satire. I guess
it's hard to ridicule something
that is funny in the first place.
Oh, I almost forgot "World's
Finest Tails." Captain Marbles,
Stuporman, and Fratman (for
merly Batman). I haven't been
able to forget it yet, but I'll keep
trying. The whole thing is a pre
lude to one (barfl pun.
Crash Comics are upon us again. Many of its staunch supporters
will be disappointed to know that it doesn't have a chance of being
banned on the campus or in Palo Alto ("The Boston of the West").
This is not because they aren't trying.
I just, showed a copy to an econ major I know, who pronounced it

"a significant contribution to the
gross national product." But it's
been grosser.
The same old comics are paro
died. "The Prone Ranger" has a
cute trick ending. "Little Orphan
Anita" is a cleaned-up title for
the most pseudo-licentious theme.
"Dunald Duck" lays an egg.
Political Opinions
John Frankenstein shows his
political opinions, and his wit, in
the "Dick Tricky" strip. Appar
ently he is left of the right, but
not in the center. Maybe he is a
member of the Sahl-for-president
movement. Don't read it too fast
to catch the allusion to the man
who erected a prominent campus
landmark.
