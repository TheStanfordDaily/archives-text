If statistics mean anything . . .
then you, as a Stanford graduate, will
own far more life insurance, some
day, than the average fellow with
only a high-school education.
"Of course!" you'll probably say . . .
But, do you realize what a priceless
advantage you have in looking into
it now, while your rate is low, and
your health is good, and your occu
pation is non-hazardous?
Well, the New York Life has a plan
which is made - to - order for the
young potential business or profes
sional man. It provides $10,000
immediate protection 112 about 27
cents per day.
Through such a plan, you can guar
antee your right to provide further
protection as you grow and prosper.
This plan is certainly worthy of your
consideration while on the threshold
of a bright future.
