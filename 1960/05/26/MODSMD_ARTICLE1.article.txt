: wave alert that sent thousands of
Hawaii residents and vacationers
to high ground yesterday, was
j called off at 3:38 p.m.--after 2
hours, 48 minutes.

newed Chilean earthquakes and a
radioed warning from Christmas
1 Island chain.
There was no high water except
j a 10-inch rise in a river on Hilo,
I the southernmost Hawaiian is
land, but officials took no chances
in view of the tidal wave damage
done on that island Monday.
Famed Waikiki Beach was de
serted within an hour, except for
beach boys. Patrons fled restau
rants without taking time to pay
their checks. Thousands of mo
torists jammed streets and roads
| to high ground in Honolulu and
| at Hilo.

at 1:37 a.m. In the city of Val
divia. a previously damaged high
' steel tower fell. Most of the city's
people were in the near-by hills.

Tidal waves caused panic along
more than 750 miles of the coast.
They struck heavily at ports rang
| ing from Caldera, a village of 1,-
500 that is the outlet for much
of the north's copper, gold, silver,
! nitrates and borax, to Talcahuano,
a southern resort town, manufac
i luring center and submarine base
j of 35,000.

He said unusual tidal actions at
Christmas Island west of South

Panama Canal Zone indicated a
tidal wave may be headed this
way.
