### Richard Sundeen ASSU President 
During the past year several
persons have posed various ques
tions of similar nature to me as
President: "What do you do?"
"What do you think of student
government?" "What has been
the highlight of holding such a
position?"
Such questions and the various
experiences I have had through
out this year have constantly
aroused my thoughts concerning
student government and that
which goes along with it. Conse
quently, my attitudes and reac
tions toward this institution have
varied.
It seems to me that student gov
ernment may be considered in
many aspects and as many things,
none of them being absolute. Per
haps student government and its
activities may appear to be simi
lar to a game a sort of shadow
boxing affair.
Another i'acet of your ASSU
government consists of providing
services for this university com
munity in which we live.
Thirdly, a student government
represents a part of the triad that
exists within a university —the
students, the faculty, and the ad
minislrative officers.
Each of these three general cat
egories, I feel comprises a neces
sary part of student government
on this campus. Even if the peti
tions on the National Defense Ed
ucation Act or for Caryl Chess
man. the irate letters to the Daily
and the editor's retorts, or the
many hours spent by student
groups on controversial issues,
are only the motions of a shadow
boxer and will not effect tlie mak
ers of policies in question (this is
not to say they have no "effect
at all), they are still necessary.
For such student activity not only
acls in a lobbyist manner, but also
in an educational manner hope
fully bringing all of the facts to
the fore.
Likewise, all of the services per
formed for the student body fi
nancial, .social, educational, or
cultural could nol be handled by
independent interest groups ol
factions. One only need glance at
the social calendar for Ihe multi
tude of events and services offer
er! each quarter, whether they be
dances, concerts, or 1.1. R. discus
sions.
As part of this university triad,
the students can play an integral
part. Through student-faculty-ad
ministration committees the stu
dents' voice can be heard on aca
demic programs, administrative
policies, and, yes, even on univer
sity or student unions.
Larry Royse and I recently at
tended a western states' student
body presidents' conference. In
comparing our Associated Stu
dent's organizations with others,
we have something of which to

be proud. Yet self improvement
is always necessary. I offer a few
comments in regard to next year.
I am particularly impressed
with our organizations such as
Political Union and 1.1. R. This
past year there has been an em
phasis to educe an even greater
awareness of current affairs
through bringing specific issues
to the student body on a level
more personal than a magazine or
a metropolitan newspaper.
I would suggest, that in order
to erivoke an even more vivid con
sciousness, that groups, such as
the 1.1. R. or Political Union, insti
tute, along with their already line
programs, a method in which pro
grams on current issues may be
presented immediately to the stu
dent body. This already exists to
an extent, but an even greater
emphasis will not let spontaneous
interest die out.
Our Stanford Daily has also im
pressed me. . . . The front page
with its international and national
news coverage is probably unique
among western university dailies.
I once heard that the purpose t>f
a newspaper is to comfort those
who are unjustly irritated and to
irritate those who are unjustly
comfortable. The Daily seems to
have purported these goals this
past year.
I would like to irritate the Daily
with two comments. Perhaps the
Daily should bear a greater part
of ils responsibility to the stu
dents by covering more student
organizations and their activities.
There are a myriad of campus is
sues that should be aired out.
This, I realize, depends a great
deal on what is happening and
•space available in each issue.
Secondly, if the Daily is sincere
in its appeals for academic objec
tivity as Hoover Institution or Un-
American Activities Committee,
less editorializing in its news cov
erage would seem consistent.
The last point that 1 would like
to comment upon is the Funda
mental Standard and lienor Code
which has greatly impressed me.
At the presidents' conference men
tinned above, the most frequent
question posed to me concerned
our Honor Code.
Our University's honor code is,
so to speak, renown among other
universities and colleges. Yet, is
it so renown or revered at our
own university? Perhaps re-eval
uation of the student and faculty
attitudes toward this institution
could serve to re-emphasize its
importance.
1 have enjoyed and benefited
from this past year. I could not
have had a better crew to work
with than Julie Ilirsch, Bob Best,
and the many other persons in
the ASSU organizations. Thank
you very much for your coopera
tion (and opposition to make it
interesting) and for giving me an
opportunity to serve as an officer
of the Associated Students.

Such questions and the various
experiences I have had through
out this year have constantly
aroused my thoughts concerning
student government and that
which goes along with it. Conse
quently, my attitudes and reac
tions toward this institution have
varied.
It seems to me that student gov
ernment may be considered in
many aspects and as many things,
none of them being absolute. Per
haps student government and its
activities may appear to be simi
lar to a game a sort of shadow
boxing affair.
Another i'acet of your ASSU
government consists of providing
services for this university com
munity in which we live.
Thirdly, a student government
represents a part of the triad that
exists within a university —the
students, the faculty, and the ad
minislrative officers.
Each of these three general cat
egories, I feel comprises a neces
sary part of student government
on this campus. Even if the peti
tions on the National Defense Ed
ucation Act or for Caryl Chess
man. the irate letters to the Daily
and the editor's retorts, or the
many hours spent by student
groups on controversial issues,
are only the motions of a shadow
boxer and will not effect tlie mak
ers of policies in question (this is
not to say they have no "effect
at all), they are still necessary.
For such student activity not only
acls in a lobbyist manner, but also
in an educational manner hope
fully bringing all of the facts to
the fore.
Likewise, all of the services per
formed for the student body fi
nancial, .social, educational, or
cultural could nol be handled by
independent interest groups ol
factions. One only need glance at
the social calendar for Ihe multi
tude of events and services offer
er! each quarter, whether they be
dances, concerts, or 1.1. R. discus
sions.
As part of this university triad,
the students can play an integral
part. Through student-faculty-ad
ministration committees the stu
dents' voice can be heard on aca
demic programs, administrative
policies, and, yes, even on univer
sity or student unions.
Larry Royse and I recently at
tended a western states' student
body presidents' conference. In
comparing our Associated Stu
dent's organizations with others,
we have something of which to

be proud. Yet self improvement
is always necessary. I offer a few
comments in regard to next year.
I am particularly impressed
with our organizations such as
Political Union and 1.1. R. This
past year there has been an em
phasis to educe an even greater
awareness of current affairs
through bringing specific issues
to the student body on a level
more personal than a magazine or
a metropolitan newspaper.
I would suggest, that in order
to erivoke an even more vivid con
sciousness, that groups, such as
the 1.1. R. or Political Union, insti
tute, along with their already line
programs, a method in which pro
grams on current issues may be
presented immediately to the stu
dent body. This already exists to
an extent, but an even greater
emphasis will not let spontaneous
interest die out.
Our Stanford Daily has also im
pressed me. . . . The front page
with its international and national
news coverage is probably unique
among western university dailies.
I once heard that the purpose t>f
a newspaper is to comfort those
who are unjustly irritated and to
irritate those who are unjustly
comfortable. The Daily seems to
have purported these goals this
past year.
I would like to irritate the Daily
with two comments. Perhaps the
Daily should bear a greater part
of ils responsibility to the stu
dents by covering more student
organizations and their activities.
There are a myriad of campus is
sues that should be aired out.
This, I realize, depends a great
deal on what is happening and
•space available in each issue.
Secondly, if the Daily is sincere
in its appeals for academic objec
tivity as Hoover Institution or Un-
American Activities Committee,
less editorializing in its news cov
erage would seem consistent.
The last point that 1 would like
to comment upon is the Funda
mental Standard and lienor Code
which has greatly impressed me.
At the presidents' conference men
tinned above, the most frequent
question posed to me concerned
our Honor Code.
Our University's honor code is,
so to speak, renown among other
universities and colleges. Yet, is
it so renown or revered at our
own university? Perhaps re-eval
uation of the student and faculty
attitudes toward this institution
could serve to re-emphasize its
importance.
1 have enjoyed and benefited
from this past year. I could not
have had a better crew to work
with than Julie Ilirsch, Bob Best,
and the many other persons in
the ASSU organizations. Thank
you very much for your coopera
tion (and opposition to make it
interesting) and for giving me an
opportunity to serve as an officer
of the Associated Students.
During the past year several
persons have posed various ques

President: "What do you do?"
"What do you think of student
government?" "What has been

ernment may be considered in
many aspects and as many things,
none of them being absolute. Per
haps student government and its
activities may appear to be simi
lar to a game a sort of shadow
boxing affair.
Another i'acet of your ASSU
government consists of providing
services for this university com
munity in which we live.
Thirdly, a student government
represents a part of the triad that
exists within a university —the
students, the faculty, and the ad
minislrative officers.
Each of these three general cat
egories, I feel comprises a neces
sary part of student government
on this campus. Even if the peti
tions on the National Defense Ed
ucation Act or for Caryl Chess
man. the irate letters to the Daily
and the editor's retorts, or the
many hours spent by student
groups on controversial issues,
are only the motions of a shadow
boxer and will not effect tlie mak
ers of policies in question (this is
not to say they have no "effect
at all), they are still necessary.
For such student activity not only
acls in a lobbyist manner, but also
in an educational manner hope
fully bringing all of the facts to
the fore.
Likewise, all of the services per
formed for the student body fi
nancial, .social, educational, or
cultural could nol be handled by
independent interest groups ol
factions. One only need glance at
the social calendar for Ihe multi
tude of events and services offer
er! each quarter, whether they be
dances, concerts, or 1.1. R. discus
sions.
As part of this university triad,
the students can play an integral
part. Through student-faculty-ad
ministration committees the stu
dents' voice can be heard on aca
demic programs, administrative
policies, and, yes, even on univer
sity or student unions.
Larry Royse and I recently at
tended a western states' student
body presidents' conference. In
comparing our Associated Stu
dent's organizations with others,
we have something of which to

be proud. Yet self improvement
is always necessary. I offer a few
comments in regard to next year.
I am particularly impressed
with our organizations such as
Political Union and 1.1. R. This
past year there has been an em
phasis to educe an even greater
awareness of current affairs
through bringing specific issues
to the student body on a level
more personal than a magazine or
a metropolitan newspaper.
I would suggest, that in order
to erivoke an even more vivid con
sciousness, that groups, such as
the 1.1. R. or Political Union, insti
tute, along with their already line
programs, a method in which pro
grams on current issues may be
presented immediately to the stu
dent body. This already exists to
an extent, but an even greater
emphasis will not let spontaneous
interest die out.
Our Stanford Daily has also im
pressed me. . . . The front page
with its international and national
news coverage is probably unique
among western university dailies.
I once heard that the purpose t>f
a newspaper is to comfort those
who are unjustly irritated and to
irritate those who are unjustly
comfortable. The Daily seems to
have purported these goals this
past year.
I would like to irritate the Daily
with two comments. Perhaps the
Daily should bear a greater part
of ils responsibility to the stu
dents by covering more student
organizations and their activities.
There are a myriad of campus is
sues that should be aired out.
This, I realize, depends a great
deal on what is happening and
•space available in each issue.
Secondly, if the Daily is sincere
in its appeals for academic objec
tivity as Hoover Institution or Un-
American Activities Committee,
less editorializing in its news cov
erage would seem consistent.
The last point that 1 would like
to comment upon is the Funda
mental Standard and lienor Code
which has greatly impressed me.
At the presidents' conference men
tinned above, the most frequent
question posed to me concerned
our Honor Code.
Our University's honor code is,
so to speak, renown among other
universities and colleges. Yet, is
it so renown or revered at our
own university? Perhaps re-eval
uation of the student and faculty
attitudes toward this institution
could serve to re-emphasize its
importance.
1 have enjoyed and benefited
from this past year. I could not
have had a better crew to work
with than Julie Ilirsch, Bob Best,
and the many other persons in
the ASSU organizations. Thank
you very much for your coopera
tion (and opposition to make it
interesting) and for giving me an
opportunity to serve as an officer
of the Associated Students.
During the past year several
persons have posed various ques
tions of similar nature to me as
President: "What do you do?"
"What do you think of student
government?" "What has been
the highlight of holding such a
position?"
Such questions and the various
experiences I have had through
out this year have constantly
aroused my thoughts concerning
student government and that
which goes along with it. Conse
quently, my attitudes and reac
tions toward this institution have
varied.
