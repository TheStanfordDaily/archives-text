# 1960 QUAD
## I Am a Schizo 
### Alan Rosenthal 
It was my last day or so in
England. Exams were over. In a
low days we were to leave for
God's Own Country. In despera
tion I rustled up a few of my
American friends. "Quick. You
gotta help me. Tell me about
American college life."
"Well, you gotta he groupy,
■ that's the key. Throw away your
| comb, get a crew cut and sharpen
; the ends. The women are better
! looking but they wear socks. You
must learn to say ili' at the faint
j est sign of recognition. And you
I must get into the yearbook if you
consider yourself anybody."
Thus I breathed ;i sigh of relief
to find that I, though somewhat
obscurely, had taken my place in
this year's noble record. I w;is
obviously loved, wanted and ad
justed.
An Institution
The yearbook is a very Ameri
can institution. The idea isn't at
all bad: to give a review of the
events, people and organizations
1 within the University as a me
mento, in particular* for the sen
i iors. An immense amount of work
| goes into it and I gather over 100
| people devoted their time to pro-
J paring this year's Quad.
I feel it an extreme pity that
I the result of so much effort is
' flat and rather mediocre.
Let us grant that pictures of
the graduating seniors have to
go in. Also the living groups. 1
have my reservations, but they
can pass.
The book invites you with about
30 pages that abstract iho uni
versity. This section is extremely
well done with the photo signi
fying art leaving you thirsting
for the rest of the book. But there

| may be a few cynics who will
wonder at the conjunction of the
| symbols for a man.
Good Sports Section
The other really good section'
is that on sports. There would
i be only one trifling complaint.!
: Slightly too much emphasis on
the football. However the photo
' graphs are excellent.
Unfortunately the other 200-
' odd pages pall. The key, i think,
is a lack of imagination in pho
tography or planning.
The straight head-on photos of
j group after group, or the por
i trayal of so many bowed heads
J or professors with the inevitable
| book in hand just becomes mean
-1 ingless.
There is little attempt to put
i life into the pictures and few
of the photographers would seem
to have had even a cursory ac
j quaintance with "The Family
| Man." Nor do the 1 page layouts
exhibit any thought.
What I received was ihe con-
I viction that this was the way it
| had been done in the past, and
l so it must continue.
Mass Fiery Chariot
I As for the passage "Bursts of
I sunlight, the play of green shad
ows . . . the shimmer of robes!
... Stanford smiles and bids
farewell ..." I expected the sen-
I ior class to rise to Heaven in a
j mass fiery chariot.
Lastly there are too many
j omissions: the protest forms on
j engineering corner; the election
; posters on the trees; and above
all, the lack of real feeling of i
! the beauty of the university, the
| long shadows and the real peace
jon a weekend. This is what the
; Quad should have given us, but
didn't.

An Institution
The yearbook is a very Ameri
can institution. The idea isn't at
all bad: to give a review of the
events, people and organizations
1 within the University as a me
mento, in particular* for the sen
i iors. An immense amount of work
| goes into it and I gather over 100
| people devoted their time to pro-
J paring this year's Quad.
I feel it an extreme pity that
I the result of so much effort is
' flat and rather mediocre.
Let us grant that pictures of
the graduating seniors have to
go in. Also the living groups. 1
have my reservations, but they
can pass.
The book invites you with about
30 pages that abstract iho uni
versity. This section is extremely
well done with the photo signi
fying art leaving you thirsting
for the rest of the book. But there

| may be a few cynics who will
wonder at the conjunction of the
| symbols for a man.
Good Sports Section
The other really good section'
is that on sports. There would
i be only one trifling complaint.!
: Slightly too much emphasis on
the football. However the photo
' graphs are excellent.
Unfortunately the other 200-
' odd pages pall. The key, i think,
is a lack of imagination in pho
tography or planning.
The straight head-on photos of
j group after group, or the por
i trayal of so many bowed heads
J or professors with the inevitable
| book in hand just becomes mean
-1 ingless.
There is little attempt to put
i life into the pictures and few
of the photographers would seem
to have had even a cursory ac
j quaintance with "The Family
| Man." Nor do the 1 page layouts
exhibit any thought.
What I received was ihe con-
I viction that this was the way it
| had been done in the past, and
l so it must continue.
Mass Fiery Chariot
I As for the passage "Bursts of
I sunlight, the play of green shad
ows . . . the shimmer of robes!
... Stanford smiles and bids
farewell ..." I expected the sen-
I ior class to rise to Heaven in a
j mass fiery chariot.
Lastly there are too many
j omissions: the protest forms on
j engineering corner; the election
; posters on the trees; and above
all, the lack of real feeling of i
! the beauty of the university, the
| long shadows and the real peace

didn't.
It was my last day or so in
England. Exams were over. In a
low days we were to leave for
God's Own Country. In despera

American friends. "Quick. You
gotta help me. Tell me about
American college life."
"Well, you gotta he groupy,
