Summit Torpedo
Editor, the Daily:
"Who torpedoed the summit
! conference?"
The U.S. designed the plans for
i the torpedo in allowing such a
flight to lie marie so close to the
date of the summit meeting.
The Russians built the torpedo
by playing the incident up for
| propaganda purposes and shot the
I projectile in the direction of Pa-
I l is.
However, it was unarmed.and
would only have made a large
dent in the meeting had not the
President inserted the fuse by as
; suming full responsibility for the
j incident, after Khrushchev had
! exonerated him from any blame.
He then set the fuse by declar
ing he would continue to use the
U-2 on spying missions behind the
iron curtain.
This left Khrushchev with no
I "face saving" alternative other
i than blowing the conference to
smithereens.

Evaluation
Editor, the Daily:
It is heartening to note that stu
dents have recently been taking
an active part in expressing their
interest in and opinions on na
tional and international issues.
However, there is also a very
great danger that student ener
gies, already being channelled into
active protest and questioning,
will be channelled into protest and
questioning of issues that can be
used to their own detriment.
As students, vitally concerned
with current issues, it is our re
sponsibility not only to act, but
also rationally to evaluate our ac
tions and their justifications.
Rather than impulsively and

blindly rejecting Iho innuendos
that have been recently directed
towards the motivations of stu
dent protests, we should objec
tively examine them for whatever
truths they might hold.

What Intention?
Editor, the Daily:
In an otherwise well-written
Scratch Sheet, one happy phrase
piques the imagination in one
of the reviews, it is stated that
Charles N. Fifcr of the English
Department is possessed of an
"unripened intellect." Dare one
ask the reviewer's intention?
