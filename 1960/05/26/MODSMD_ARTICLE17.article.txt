# Norman Was Fantastic...

"There are 10 seconds left . . .
Norman fades back . . . Stanford
receivers are covered . . . Norman
starts to the right . . . moves past
the five-yard line, is tackled . . .
tries for the sidelines. . . Yes,
the gun went off before Dick
could ever get to the sidelines in
Stanford's last-ditch r!rive deep
in Cal territory and the Bears
won the Big Game 20-17, but his
afternoon of passing ranks as this
year's Thrill of the Year.
Once again the Daily sports
staff has chosen the electrifying
Big Game as Stanford's top sports
thrill. Certainly the 90,000 fans
plus a few thousand swarming
kids all agreed that last season's
Big One was one of the greatest
football circuses ever.
After all the shouting died
down, Stanford fans realized that
Norman, Chris Burl'ord and Co.
had lost another close one to the
referees and the Wayne Crow-led
Bears from across the Bay; this
time by the slim margin of three
points.
Passing Show Supreme
But there was the greatest foot
ball passing show ever presented
in a collegiate football season and
even the last second Indian drive
was anti-climactic to the phenome
nal passing performance of quar
terback Norman to receivers Bur
lord, Ben Robinson, Dick Bowers,
Skip Face, clc. Dick set two
NCAA records that day and
'clinched his national passing and
total offense titles.
He busted Don Klosterman's
(of Loyola) eight-year record for
single game completions with his
34 for 39 passes and an .875 per
centage. The Card QB also set a
new yardage record for passing
in a single game with 401 total
yards.
Stanford was a definite favor
ite in last year's Big Contest but
the Bears liked their role as un
derdogs and quickly scored two

touchdowns on Crow's passing to
end Gael Barsotti.
Norman finally got the ball
team moving and drove for 132
yards in the closing moments of
the first half only to have 60
passing yards in that last ditch
drive and no score go into the
record books. This frustrating
drama was due to the referees'
sudden liking for their whistles.
Best Yet to Come
But the best was yet to come
for Dick as his passing picked
up to a torrid pace. The third
quarter finished with the ball
game all tied up and the Indians
edging toward the goal lino once
again.

Early in the last stanza Face
was called to boot one of his
three-point specials and the Tribe
led 17-14.
Cal scored, led 20-17 and set
, the stage for the final climactic
Stanford scoring attempt.
Cunliffe vs. Burleson
There were o th e r thrilling
events this year in Stanford
sports that should be mentioned
at this time. Ernie Cunliffe's four
minute mile duel with Dyrol
Burleson up in Oregon was a
great event. Marv Mecklenberg's
16 consecutive innings and double
header win against -Santa Clara
gave the baseball fans a lot to
cheer about. But any way you
look at it, the overwhelming thrill

of this year was the Rig Game
classic.
