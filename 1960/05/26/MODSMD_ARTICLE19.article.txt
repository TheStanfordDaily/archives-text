# Ray Lunny--Coach of Year
## 
### Stan Hulett 
Boxing mentor Ray Lunny is this year's Stanford Daily Coach of
the Year. Lunny guided his 1960 fighters to the championship in the
California Collegiate Boxing Conference, and to a tic for fifth in
the NCAA.
This season was the finest for the dynamic coach, who is in his

14th season at Stanford. His box
ers compiled a 7-1 record last sea
son, the lone loss coming in the
opener ai Chico State.
Prime Mover
Lunny was one of the prime
» movers in forming the new con
ference. which opened last season
and has added a seventh member,
Cal Poly, for next season. In a
i "crucial" time for college boxing,
ihe CCBC, a small-scale confer
ence of true amateurs, appears
the .sane solution that may save
the sport from its critics.
Lunny took two fighters to the
NCAA championships at Madison,
and brought a fifth place tie back
to the Farm. Ed Rothman, fight
i ing in his first season, went to
the finals in the heavyweight di
vision where he lost to Archie
Milton of San Jose State.
Another Card fighter in his
first year got into the semi-final
round of the tournament. He was
Bruce Bellows, 156 pounder, who
was decisioned in a tough fight
I with the eventual champion, Terry
Smith of Sacramento State.
Long Way
Both Rothman and Bellows
were products of the boxing
classes at Stanford and last year
were winners in the intramural
'championships. Lunny certainly
'took them a long way in their
first year of collegiate boxing.
This represented the first time
that a Stanford boxing team has
ever placed in the NCAA finals,
and of course the first time a
Stanford fighter has ever reached
the national finals.
Quite a Boxer
Lunny was quite a boxer him
self. in his day. Tom Laird, for
mer sport.swriter for the San
Francisco News, once called the
flashy Lunny, "The class of the
Lightweights," after Ray had won
a decisive decision in his first 10-
rounder in San Francisco,
i In his professional career from
1938 to 1944, he won 39 of 43
fights and at one time had gone
34 consecutive fights without a
loss. The •string was finally bro
ken by Chalky Wright, the feath
erweight champion of the world.
Lunny was ranked third na
tionally in the lightweight class
by Ring Magazine before World
War 11. When the war came
along, his career slowed down a
bit and finally ended in 19-11.
It is a fitting climax to a highly
successful year for Lunny to be
recognized as Coach of Ihe Year.
