# Lawrence Finishes As Top Indian Hitter
## 
### 
Led by the strong hitting of
Skip Lawrence, Mike Magee, Jim
Burk. and Hal Schutzmann the
Stanford Indians concluded their
1960 baseball campaign hy post
ing twenty wins against seventeen
losses.
Outfielder Lawrence — the out
standing Card hitter all season
finished with 45 safeties in 125 at
bats for a tremendous .360 per
centage.
Mike Magee with 36 for 118
batted .305 as he and Lawrence
were the only regulars to join the
celebrated "300" club.
Three pitchers accounted for 31
of the 37 victories recorded by the
diamondmen in an amazing dis
play of endurance.
Terry Lindeman (4-1), Marv

Mecklenberg (8-8) and Jim Smith
(5-51 did the firing as they helped
Stanford over the .500 mark.
Team totals showed that Stan
ford out hit their opponents .255
to .228. This was a very exacting
measure because of the extremely
rare coincidence of Stanford and
all their opponents coming to bat
the same number of times over
the entire season.
The .255 team batting mark was
established through the steady
swinging of Jim Burk (.290), Hal
Schutzmann (.284). Mike Filice
(.2751, John Hurlbut (.255), and
Rich Ferrazzano (.250) to name a
few.
The season was certainly a re
warding one for both the players
and their loyal fans.
