under four minutes for the mile
run here Saturday when he races
America's best at the California
Relays.

record of 3:54.5 in 1958, faces Dy
rol Burleson, the University of
Oregon sophomore, who ran a
3:58.0 on April 23, fastest ever for
a United States runner.
"I certainly feel I can run under
four minutes here," Elliott de
clared. He didn't rule out the
possibility of a new record pro
viding the pace is fast enough for
the first half-mile.

1500 meters at last Friday
night's Coliseum Relays in Los
Angeles in a comparatively slow
3:45.4. He feels stronger this
week.
"1 have no definite plan for the
race," he said. "If 1 think I'm
strong enough, I'll open up much
sooner than I did in Los Angeles."
