WASHINGTON (/P) â€” Presi
dent Eisenhower declared yester
day America must continue "busi
nesslike dealings with the Soviet
leaders" despite the blowup of
the Paris summit conference.
The President conceded that
Soviet action leading to the col
lapse "has turned the clock back
in some measure."
But he added that it should be
noted that Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev "did not go beyond
invective a limeworn Soviet de
vice to achieve an immediate ob
jective."
Eisenhower again vigorously
defended espionage for the pur
pose of protecting national secur
ity:
"The plain truth is this: When
a nation needs intelligence activ
ity. there is no time when vigi
lance can be relaxed."
But the President pointed out
once again that he had notified
Khrushchev in Paris that flights
over Soviet territory had been
halted and would not be resumed.
