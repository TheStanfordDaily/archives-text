# DAY IN COURT
## â€˜Not Guilty': Students in City Hall Riot 
### 
J
SAN* FRANCISCO (/P> Sixty
three students yesterday pleaded
innocent some boldly and some
in whispers to charges of riot
ing two weeks ago at the City
Hall demonstrations against a
House subcommittee on Un-Amer
ican Activities.
A joint trial date will be set
tomorrow.
The mass of defendants, largest
in local judicial history, appeared
before Municipal Judge Lenore
L. Underwood.
Dozen Coeds
The group included about a
dozen coeds. Some of the young
men sported beards, and their
garb ranged from sneakers to
Ivy League. Most were from the
University of California and San
Francisco State campuses.
One Stanford student also was
included in the group: Kenneth
Purcell, a junior.
When asked by Judge Under
wood if an innocent plea was their
desire, some students snapped,
"Yes!" Others whispered a mild
assent. One replied courteously,
"If you please."
They were charged with mis
demeanor counts of inciting to
riot, resisting arerst and disturb
ing the peace.
"Violence Excites Tyranny"
After hearing the pleas, Judge
Underwood told the young de
fendants:
"At times our actions defeat
the very principles they seek to
uphold. I believe, as perhaps you
do, that eternal vigilance is the
price of liberty. But remember
also that violence excites tyranny.
"Let me conclude by suggesting
that unless all who love this na
tion respect law and order you
may be* telling your children what
it was like in America when men
were free."
Most of the students listened
in sober attention. Several smiled.
Judge Underwood, whose court
room is in the Hall of Justice,
then ordered the defendants to
appear tomorrow morning at City
Hall where Albert Axclrod, pre
siding judge of the municipal
court, will assign the trial.
Laughter
Jack Berman, San Francisco
attorney representing 45 of the
accused rioters, was granted per
mission to tell the students how
to reach the City Hall.
"You all know where City Hall
is . . ." Berman began.
The students roared with laugh
ter.
"Be sure and tell them not to
go up the main stairs," Judge
Underwood interrupted.
There was another burst of
laughter.
The main stairs was the scene
of a struggle May 13 between
demonstrators and police, who
turned fire hoses on them and
dragged many down the stairs.
Faculty Requests
Sixty-six University of Califor
nia faculty members, meanwhile,
asked Atty. Gen. Stanley Mosk
to make an impartial inquiry in
to the May 13 riot.
Eighty-eight Stanford faculty
members addressed a similar re
quest last week to Mayor George;
Christopher. The mayor then de
clared the incident was closed.
The California faculty group*
explaining they acted as individ
uals, said in the request to Mosk:
"The pictorial and other ac
counts of the situation available
to us indicate that the police bru
tality displayed that day was
neither provoked nor necessary
for the maintenance of law and
order.
