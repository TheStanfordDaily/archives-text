# BARZUN SAYS
## Science, Humanities One Culture 
### Marcia Loer 
"The chief cultural characteris
tic of the ag'e is not the difference
i between science and humanities
but rather that science is not for
us an object of contemplation,"
Jaques Barzun, author and dean
of the faculties at Columbia Uni
versity, said last night.
Barzun, speaking on "One Cul
ture,' Not Two," distinguished be
tween science and other academic
| subjects on the grounds that "sci
ence ceases to be science when
one Ls not at work at it in research
and discovery."
He made the point that science
| cannot contribute to culture foi'
pleasure and edification due to the
existence of a communication bar
: rier which is "inherent but acci
dental due to the preoccupation of
science with discovery."
"Stupendous Triumph"
Barzun cited the need for a criti
cal vocabulary to bring science be
fore the contemplative mind in
terms it can understand, as the
major method of overcoming this
! problem.
He called modern science "one
of the most stupendous triumphs
of the human mind" and conclud
ed that "science has made the
power of the mind visible as noth
ing else has done."
He dated the modern attitude
of respect for abstract ways of
thought from a century ago when
I the debate over Darwin's theories
■ made people conscious of scien
tific methods of analysis. For the
educated science offered a strict
ness of method and to the masses
it gave an explanation of the ma
chinery which had come to domi
nate their lives.
Parallel
Barzifn drew a parallel between
the medieval theologian and the
: modern scientist. Both belong to
minority groups which have tre
mendous influence on their cul
! tures, he said.
He defines the scientific culture
j as "a type of contemporary soci
ety through which elements of
science have filtered until they
characterize the whole."
Barzun. one of America's fore
most intellectuals, is the author
of "The Pleasures of Music."
"God's Country and Mine," and
"The House of Intellect."
