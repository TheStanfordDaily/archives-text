# Construction Starts on ‘Clusters' Next Autumn
## 
### 
Eight Stanford fraternities will see construction begin in the fall on their new houses, the first two
units of the fraternity "cluster" system.
The new program in undergraduate men's housing, adopted in 1957, is designed to integrate the social
and residential with the cultural and academic life of Ihe University.
Each house will be ■separate, but houses will be integrated in groups of four.

The first four Phi Doha Theta,
Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon and Theta Delta Chi—will be
built on the oak-dotted slopes near
The Knoll, once the home of the
late Ray Lyman Wilbur, third
president of Stanford. Occupancy
is expected by the fall of J961.
The site for the second group
Kappa Alpha. Zeta Psi, Alpha Del
ta Phi and Alpha Kappa Lambda
has not yet been selected.
The cost of each group will be
about $1,500,000, financed by a
combination of sources: a fund
drive among alumni of the frater
nities, other gifts and a loan from
the federal government's Housing
and Home Financing Agency.
Other Undergrad Housing
Emphasizing that architectural
ideas developed in the first eight
houses are to be carried into addi
tional undergraduate housing
men's as well as women's, Asso
ciate Dean of Students William
G. Craig said:
"Stanford's future foretells a
much closer linking of residential
life to our educational program.
The housing program is aimed to
ward that goal."
The two-story houses will bo
built to residential scale, using
warm and attractive materials to
blend with nearby faculty resi
dences.
Features
Features intended to further
the University's new housing phi
losophy include study-bedroom
suites for two men, individual
house libraries and study rooms
and a "master's house" adjoining
each four-unit group, to be occu
pied by a senior faculty member
and his family.
While each house will harmo
nize with its neighbors, individu
ality will be expressed in eleva
tions, floor plans, the use of ex
terior materials and in decoration.
Each house will have its own
dining room. There will be a cen
tral kitchen supplemented by
smaller serving kitchens. There
will lie social areas, large outdoor
patios, and recreation areas with
basketball-volleyball courts.
Parking and landscaping costs
are included.
Special Interest
Warnecke, the architect of the
design and a member of the Stan
ford Class of 1911. took a special
interest in the plans because of
his familiarity with housing needs
as a student.
Basic premise of the new pro
gram has been set forth by Presi
dent Wallace Sterling:
VA residential university like
Stanford." he said, "offers the op
portunity to carry into living
areas discussions which originate
in the classroom.
"The new undergraduate hous
ing program is designed to en
courage and facilitate construc
tive rapport between what hap
pens where a student learns and
where he lives.
"The eighl fraternities to be
housed in the new residence units
will be pioneers in a vigorous Uni
versity effort to broaden and
strengthen the entire undergrad
uate housing program."
