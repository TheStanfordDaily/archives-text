# UNIVERSITY MUST APPROVE
## Legislature Okays Plans For $20,000 Hostel Site 
### 
Plans to establish a $20,000
permanent Stanford hostel site
have received the official okay
from LASSU. If University
; approval can be obtained during
' the summer, construction may
i begin fall quarter.
The Ad Hoc Committee appoint -
| ed by Legislature has recommend
ed an area near Jasper Ride, close
to Searsville Lake, for the hostel
; site. Travel time from campus
i would total about 30 minutes, in
cluding a walk from the parking
lot to the actual cabin.
Ultra-Modern
Scott Danielson, an architecture
j student, has designed the building
i in ultra-modern style. Features
include a common room to be
used for discussion, dining and
social activities; and an adjacent
kitchen for quick preparation and
serving of simple meals.
Sleeping decks would provide
1 covered mattresses for students.
[Adequate separation is provided
! between men and women. Faculty
members have p r i v a t e rooms
I with beds and furniture.
Utilities would include a gas
j stove, refrigerator and hot and
j cold running water. Kerosene
lamps provide adequate night
j time lighting, since electricity
would be too expensive.
Total footage of the building
is 1,400 square feet. On the basis
of current construction costs, the
! project is estimated to cost be
| tween $20,000 and $25,000, includ
ing land preparation, construction
and furnishing. Legislature has
appropriated $20,000 in tne ex
pectation that the administration
will provide the remainder if
necessary.
UsÂ«mI by Many
The hostel building could be
used by students, faculty and
alumni. In addition to present
hostel program activities, the site
might be used for foreign campus
groups, living groups and further
class and seminar hostels. The
faculty could use the site for de
partmental meetings and social
events, and alumni conferences
might also be held there.
A permanent hostel site has
been anticipated since the ASSU
Hostels Board was founded in
1956. A decided increase in stu
dent interest and attendance has
prom pled definite planning. Des
pite the relatively smooth opera
tion of the hostels program, the
board has frequently encountered
problems with temporary sites.
The main problem has been a
lack of suitable accommodations
for students and faculty within a
reasonable distance. Because of
the excessive time and money re
quired to reach many of the sites,
faculty members have been re
| luctant to attend hostels.
The Hostels Board, headed this

year by John Nickerson, said
that the time previously spent to
obtain prope r accommodations
and convince faculty members to
travel the distance can be used
more effectively in planning an
improved program.
The hostels program this year
drew 252 students, including 99
students at the eight regular
ASSU hostels. Topics ranged from
"The Responsibility of the Amer
ican Press" to "Castro, Commu
nism, and Cuba." Several promi
nent faculty members as well as
outside guests provided discus
sions.
Hostels next fall probably again
will be held at temporary sites,
but it is hoped that the perma
nent site will be ready for use
winter quarter.
The Hostels Program was initi
ated at Stanford to accommodate
"the growing seriousness and ma
turity among the students." Its
chief aim has been to disprove the
theory that the intellectual pur
suits of Stanford students are con
fined only to the classroom.
