with Kishi." "Don't come Ike" and
'"crush the U.S.-Japan security

Later, a column of 16.000 snake
danced past the U.S. Embassy in
a noisy 2 , i'-hour demonstration,

tered windows with chants like
"Send hack the U-25." Commu
nists chanted: "Yankee, go home."
Biggest Protest
I The demonstrations in Tokyo
'were the biggest and noisiest in
the history of both the Diet and
Hie embassy. They were by far
the biggest of the nationwide pro
tests against Kishi and the secur
-1 ity pact in which a million people
were reported to have participated
throughout Japan.
Circling the Diet from after
noon until night, the leftists —
mostly Socialists, unionists and
university students were under
■ orders to prevent Kishi from leav
j ing the structure. They held him
prisoner inside for eight hours,
: forcing him to cancel a meeting

Under Control
In spite of the din and the dust
t t hey raised, most of the demon
strators were kept under control
by their leaders. The police also
exercised unusual restraint.
Kishi told membens of his party
he would not bow to mob pres
sure and intended to remain in
office until the U.S.-Japan secur
ity pad goes into effect. Ratified
by the Diet's lower house last Fri
day, it allows American troops to
stay in Japan at least ten years
