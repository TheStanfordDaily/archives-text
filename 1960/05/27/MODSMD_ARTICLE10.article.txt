# Gromyko: U.S. Acts Mean Brink of War
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, NrY. (/P)~ Andrei Gromyko charged last night President Eisenhower has made
i clear the United States will continue acts of espionage and sabotage against the Soviet Union. He said
| this policy puts the world on the brink of a nuclear war.
The Soviet foreign minister unleashed a scathing attack on Eisenhower and U.S. policy in the Security
Council, where earlier the Soviet Union met overwhelming defeat in an attempt to have the United

States branded an aggressor for
spy flights over Russian territory.
Gromyko spoke as the council
considered a four-power resolu
tion calling on the Big Four to
resume negotiations on outstand
ing issues with the help of the
United Nations.
Toothless
He termed the resolution "tooth
less and pointier" and .submitted
a series of amendments, among
them one declaring violation of
air space a threat to world peace.
Gromyko said of Wednesday
night's address by President Ei
senhower on the collapse of the
summit conference:
"This statement expresses with
particular clarity the imperialistic
foreign policy line of the United
States, a line aimed at exacerbat
ing the international situation."
The White House said early
public reaction to Eisenhower's
report was "just tremendous."
Hagerty said that of the first 300
telegrams received, just'two were
unfriendly.
Meanwhile, 55 Democrats — 8
senators and 47 House members—
asked that Adlai E. Stevenson,
their party's presidential candi
date in 1952 and 1956, be given
equal air time to reply to Eisen
hower's summit U-2 report.
Party Leaders
Invited to the White House
breakfast were House and Senate
floor leaders of both parties, to
gether with Democratic chairmen
and senior .Republican members
of committes dealing with foreign
policy, defense and appropriations.
Also present were Secretary of
State Christian A. Herter, Secre
tary of Defense Thomas S. Gates
Jr., and Undersecretary of State
Livingston T. Merchant.
If the President told the Con
gress leaders more than he told
the public Wednesday night, there
was no immediate word of this
from those who breakfasted with
him.

UNITED NATIONS, NrY. (/P)~ Andrei Gromyko charged last night President Eisenhower has made
i clear the United States will continue acts of espionage and sabotage against the Soviet Union. He said
| this policy puts the world on the brink of a nuclear war.
The Soviet foreign minister unleashed a scathing attack on Eisenhower and U.S. policy in the Security
Council, where earlier the Soviet Union met overwhelming defeat in an attempt to have the United

States branded an aggressor for
spy flights over Russian territory.
Gromyko spoke as the council
considered a four-power resolu
tion calling on the Big Four to
resume negotiations on outstand
ing issues with the help of the
United Nations.
Toothless
He termed the resolution "tooth
less and pointier" and .submitted
a series of amendments, among
them one declaring violation of
air space a threat to world peace.
Gromyko said of Wednesday
night's address by President Ei
senhower on the collapse of the
summit conference:
"This statement expresses with
particular clarity the imperialistic
foreign policy line of the United
States, a line aimed at exacerbat
ing the international situation."
The White House said early
public reaction to Eisenhower's
report was "just tremendous."
Hagerty said that of the first 300
telegrams received, just'two were
unfriendly.
Meanwhile, 55 Democrats — 8
senators and 47 House members—
asked that Adlai E. Stevenson,
their party's presidential candi
date in 1952 and 1956, be given
equal air time to reply to Eisen
hower's summit U-2 report.
