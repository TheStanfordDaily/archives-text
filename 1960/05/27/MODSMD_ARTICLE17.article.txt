# A 						Little Rebellion
## 
### 
I hold it, that a little rebellion, now ami then, is a good thing,
and as necessarv in the political world as storms in the physical.
Thomas Jefferson to James Madison, January 30, 1787
Jefferson's words have application far heyond the political
arena. The\ are particularlv appropriate to an aeadeinie com
munity which, without disagreement, controversy, and perhaps
a touch of revolt, can easil\ stagnate.
In the last four months the Daily has attempted to loster a
lebellion, a rehellion against apathy, against the ivory tower,
against unrealized student potential and against limitation from
within and without on student thought and activity.
This has not been a revolt without a definite goal, although
the aims have been onl\ partialis realized and await further ful
fillment. The insurgence, perhaps heresy to some, has been an
effort to dispel the myths of student incompetence and imma
turity myths which are held l>\ a large number of students as
well as their elders.
The main value of this sort of rebellion is that it engenders
thought and discussion without which no university can right!idly
claim to he great.
student thought and discussion must not be limited
by the confines of the academic community itself; a university
education is not a stopping point but rather a transition leading
to an even broader life after graduation. While a student is at
college, he should keep in mind the purposes of his education as
well as the means by which he acquires it.
The l)ail\ has endeavored to extend its scope of coverage and
coinmentarv past the boundary of hi ("-amino Heal to include in
its pages events and issues which may or may not directly apply
to the University, but which certainly concern the present and
future lives of every individual in the Stanford community.
At the same time, there has been an effort to present matters
which directly affect the campus with due regard to their impor
tance and interest to the student body.
The idea that any event which occurs on campus is or should
be important to the students is fallacious, (lampus issues should
be judged on their relevance to and effect on the purposes of a
liberal education and receive editorial attention accordingly.
There has been evidence that Stanford students are more and
more willing to take their proper role in the political world
a role which cannot be assumed without some rebellion against
stagnation and arbitrary limitations.
This year, an election vear, will hopefully see the further dis
integration of the ivorv tower which tends to isolate students from
the real world and enclose them in a make-believe life of mid
terms and late leaves.
Interest and activity in political and international affairs will
continue to grow, unless obstacles are placed in the way by those
v ho wish to see student initiative stifled.
The Daily can and must play an important part in stimulating
thought and interest bv its presentation of news and editorial
comment.
Hut this part can be, at best, only supplementary to students'
own efforts to become more aware of their role as citizens of the
United States and of their responsibility as future leaders to use
their education wisely.

I hold it, that a little rebellion, now ami then, is a good thing,
and as necessarv in the political world as storms in the physical.
Thomas Jefferson to James Madison, January 30, 1787
Jefferson's words have application far heyond the political
arena. The\ are particularlv appropriate to an aeadeinie com
munity which, without disagreement, controversy, and perhaps
a touch of revolt, can easil\ stagnate.
In the last four months the Daily has attempted to loster a
lebellion, a rehellion against apathy, against the ivory tower,
against unrealized student potential and against limitation from
within and without on student thought and activity.
This has not been a revolt without a definite goal, although
the aims have been onl\ partialis realized and await further ful
fillment. The insurgence, perhaps heresy to some, has been an
effort to dispel the myths of student incompetence and imma
turity myths which are held l>\ a large number of students as
well as their elders.
The main value of this sort of rebellion is that it engenders
thought and discussion without which no university can right!idly
claim to he great.
student thought and discussion must not be limited
by the confines of the academic community itself; a university
education is not a stopping point but rather a transition leading
to an even broader life after graduation. While a student is at
college, he should keep in mind the purposes of his education as
well as the means by which he acquires it.
The l)ail\ has endeavored to extend its scope of coverage and
coinmentarv past the boundary of hi ("-amino Heal to include in
its pages events and issues which may or may not directly apply
to the University, but which certainly concern the present and
future lives of every individual in the Stanford community.
At the same time, there has been an effort to present matters
which directly affect the campus with due regard to their impor
tance and interest to the student body.
The idea that any event which occurs on campus is or should
be important to the students is fallacious, (lampus issues should
be judged on their relevance to and effect on the purposes of a
liberal education and receive editorial attention accordingly.
There has been evidence that Stanford students are more and
more willing to take their proper role in the political world
a role which cannot be assumed without some rebellion against
stagnation and arbitrary limitations.
This year, an election vear, will hopefully see the further dis
integration of the ivorv tower which tends to isolate students from
the real world and enclose them in a make-believe life of mid
terms and late leaves.
Interest and activity in political and international affairs will
continue to grow, unless obstacles are placed in the way by those
v ho wish to see student initiative stifled.
The Daily can and must play an important part in stimulating
thought and interest bv its presentation of news and editorial
comment.
