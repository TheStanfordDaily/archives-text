## U.S. Foreign Aid 
### Dick White Contributing Editor 
Sometimes the American Con-
I gress acts in a most irrational
manner. They seem to look at a
| situation, decide what is best for
our country and then do just the
opposite.
The shock of the U-2 incident
I has worn off the world, been re
j placed by the shock of the sum-
I mit collapse. America is now en
! gaged in a propoganda war with
; the Soviet Union, and we have a
! great deal of ammunition with
which to load our guns. But need
we load theirs too?
The Foreign Aid Bill is now
! before the Appropriations Com
mittee of the House of Repre
sentatives. The President has
I asked for $4.1 billion for our
allies. Much of this is spent in
'building their armies but some
j is constructively used to foster
economic development in these
I areas.
This is one of the greatest pro
poganda weapons that we in this
country posses s. The United
States is an extremely wealthy
nation, probably the only one in
the world that can truly afford
to support a foreign aid program.
As an instrument . of fighting
Communism, this is probably the
most effective one.
The Southern Dixiecrats and
1 Republicans, not en masse but to
a large extent, have lined up to
oppose our foreign aid program.
i When the chips are down and the
score cards tallied, it is these
| groups that hamper effective op
i position to the forces of totali
tarian government.
Those are the people that sup
port the public witchhunts in
I America and who are content to
I label all liberation movements as
; Communist dominated. By their
I very shallowness of perception,
i they alienate our country from
(he rest of the world and actually
; give s up p or t to Communism.
1 their dreaded enemy.
They have a new goal now.
They want to destroy the appro
priation hill for foreign aid, ema
ciate it to the point of dismal
vapidity. I< is their desire to re
duce it from the President's re
quested $4.1 billion to $2.(5 bil
lion.
The money to be slashed from
the bill is mainly that going to
; questionable allies. Aid to our
jtrusted friends would remain
[approximately the same. In other
j words, if a country is not willing
to give undying fealty to the
United States, we will help push
them into the Communist orbit.
This indeed seems to be a
rather risky policy. America is
daily blasted by the foreign lan
guage broadcasts of Radio Mos-
I cow as being an imperialist na
tion. Our attempt to bribe coun
tries to be allies through our for
; eign policy program will not de-
I tract from these charges.
It is true that the United States
must be selective in its allotment
of foreign aid. We certainly would
not want to support and finance
Russia's defense, program. How
ever, we do not want to drive
most of the remaining free world
into the Russian camp either. In
deed some discriminatory judg
ment must be used.
This is the basic Â£rror of (Air
policy. We have been too afraid
of change. The United States now
finds herself in a position of des
perately wanting to maintain the
status quo. We must realize that

this is an impossible and foolish
objective. ,
There are many dictatorships
throughout the world not allied
with the Communist block, but
taking aid from us. It is certainly
not surprising when the people
in these areas finally arise and
throw off the years of oppression.
America cannot be blamed for
supporting' countries when dicta
tors rule, for some of the money
does benefit the people. We should
not, however, so identify our
selves with ihe totalitarian forces
that we are unable to deal with
the popular leaders when they
! come to power.
This has unfortunately been 1 ho
case in Cuba. Batista was over
thrown and Castro came to power.
Ever since ihon in our press and
even on the floors of Congress,
there has been a continual deluge
of criticism. Certainly, Castro is
not the greatest democrat of his
itory. But when compared with
Batista, a considerable improve
! ment may be seen.
j America must not be surprised
lat the consequences of foreign
aid. We bring economic progress
to tiiese countries and with this
the people demand political prog
ress. Our foreign policy is a con
structive and progressive one. It
is one of our most effective weap
i ons and we should not allow il
to be destroyed in this period of
intensified Cold War.
