Re-examination
Editor, tin* Daily:
We, the women of Branner,
feel that certain actions and atti
tudes among the students eon-:
cerning the main ideals governing
this University indicate a serious
lack of universal understanding
of or possibly direct opposition
to the purposes, privileges and
responsibilities of the Fundamen-,
tal Standard and Honor Code. |
These feelings have resulted from
the following:
• The lack of regard for and
pride in the Fundamental Stand
ard expressed by many upper
classmen as well as freshmen.
• Disagreement as to the spe
cific responsibilities of the indi
vidual under the Fundamental
Standard and diverse opinion con
cerning the necessity of the third
person responsibility.
• Apparent acceptance by some
professors that the Honor Code
is not upheld.
On these bases, the women of
Branner believe thai the Stanford
students should either understand
and uphold their obligations or
change the existing policies so
that Stanford does not have one
system in theory and another in
practice. . . .

We offer 1 ho following sugges
tions as a basis for study of the
problem:
Evaluation of the Present Fun
damental Standard:
• Redefine the Fundamental
Standard to foster a better under
standing and to increase pride in
it.
• Provide a program for more
intensive education of incoming
freshmen and for yearly re-em
phasis to the students.
• Resolve the conflict between
the use of judgment by the in
dividual and the rules as stated
in the Standard.
• Emphasize the positive as
pects of third person responsibil
ity.
Possible Changes:
• Revise the Fundamental
Standard so that third person
responsibility applies only to aca
demics and not to social conduct.
• R e vi s e t he Fundamental
Standard to eliminate the third
person responsibility completely, j
o Eliminate the Honor Code
and substitute the use of proctors
for examinations.
. . . We, the undersigned, agree
that there is a need for re-exami
nation of the Fundamental Stand
ard in regard to its validity and
practicability. As a group, how

ever, we do not advocate the adop
tion of any one of the above sug
gestions but offer them all as
evidence that we have considered
the problem from several aspects.

• The lack of regard for and
pride in the Fundamental Stand
ard expressed by many upper
classmen as well as freshmen.
• Disagreement as to the spe
cific responsibilities of the indi
vidual under the Fundamental
Standard and diverse opinion con
cerning the necessity of the third
person responsibility.
• Apparent acceptance by some
professors that the Honor Code
is not upheld.
On these bases, the women of
Branner believe thai the Stanford
students should either understand
and uphold their obligations or
change the existing policies so
that Stanford does not have one
system in theory and another in
practice. . . .

We offer 1 ho following sugges
tions as a basis for study of the
problem:
Evaluation of the Present Fun
damental Standard:
• Redefine the Fundamental
Standard to foster a better under
standing and to increase pride in
it.
• Provide a program for more
intensive education of incoming
freshmen and for yearly re-em
phasis to the students.
• Resolve the conflict between
the use of judgment by the in
dividual and the rules as stated
in the Standard.
• Emphasize the positive as
pects of third person responsibil
ity.
Possible Changes:
• Revise the Fundamental
Standard so that third person
responsibility applies only to aca
demics and not to social conduct.
• R e vi s e t he Fundamental
Standard to eliminate the third
person responsibility completely, j
o Eliminate the Honor Code
and substitute the use of proctors
for examinations.
. . . We, the undersigned, agree
that there is a need for re-exami
nation of the Fundamental Stand
ard in regard to its validity and
practicability. As a group, how

ever, we do not advocate the adop
tion of any one of the above sug
gestions but offer them all as
evidence that we have considered
the problem from several aspects.

lack of universal understanding
