We must begin by reminding
ourselves where we are now. Curi
ously enough, if we look behind
the uoroar to the record itself, we
find that both sides proclaim their
desire to resume negotiations.
VV'e find, too, that the USSR and
the USA have both made substan
tial concessions, designed to make
possible a resumption of negotia
tions. There is a great gap be
tween the action of the govern
ments, which are on the record,
and the emotions drummed up by
propaganda and by counter-prop
aganda.
Tims, alter Mr. Khrushchev had
insulted the President and de
manded the break-up of the con
ference, the Western allies issued
a communique which concludes
willi the statement that "they
(that is to say, Eisenhower, de
Gaulle, and Macmillan) remain
unshaken in their conviction that
all outstanding international ques
tions should be settled not by the
use or threat of force but by
peaceful means through negotia
tion. They themselves remain
ready to take part in such negotia
tions at any suitable time in the
future."
Mr. Khrushchev for his part,
suggested that "the best thing to
do was to postpone the conference
for six or eight months until the
dust has settled, so to speak."
The record shows too that dur
ing the break-up in Paris the Pres
ident conceded that the 1 U-2 flights
had been stopped and would not
be resumed. Mr. Khrushchev, a
few days after the break-up when
ho was in East Berlin, conceded
that he would not disturb the sta
tus quo in Germany before the
next summit meeting.

So much for the record. The |
first thing' to be said about it, it
seems to nie, is that it won't be
at all easy to resume negotiation,
and that what has occurred is a
breakdown not of diplomatic rela
tions but of diplomatic communi
cations between Moscow and
Washington. The difficulties of
rest or in g communications, al
though they are not insuperable,
are very great indeed, and until
there is communication there can ,
be no negotiation.
It is evident that Mr. Khrush
chev's timetable—a summit meet
ing in six or eight months — is
quite unrealistic. He does not
seem to understand the mechanics
of ihe American political system.
Six months hence Mr. Eisen
hower will still ho President and
the President-elect will, of course,
have no power to do anything.
Eight months hence, the new Pres
ident will just be taking office,
and it is inconceivable that he
would or could go to a summit !
meeting before he had organized j
his administration and entered
himself into negotiations to pre-1
pare for a meeting.
M or e o v e r, Mr. Khrushchev
should learn to understand that
after his treatment of Mr. Eisen
hower personally no President
will go to a summit meeting with
out a radical change in the atmos
phere and without reliable assur
ances that the area of negotiation
has been made precise and that
the issues have become negotia
ble.
For these reasons, it is, I think,
a conservative estimate to say
that negotiations at the summit,
if they are ever resumed, cannot
take place much before the sum
mer of 1961.
There may be some who will
rejoice in this prospect. But the
sober and responsible view is, I
submit, that with the failure, or
at least the indefinite postpone
ment of summitry, there is an ur

j gent need to restore communica
, tions through quieter and more se
; cured and protected means.
For the United States and the
Soviet Union cannot take the
risks of being unable to communi
cate effectively for a long period
of time. This would produce in
tolerable risks of miscalculation
which would be a threat to all
mankind.
What is more, it is an illusion
to imagine that the alliance of
which we are supposed to be the
leader will stand fast and hold its
breath and clench its fist indefi
! nitely. The strain of watching the
| two gianis glowering at each
I other and unable to communicate
I would be greater than the alliance
could endure.
Communication will have to be
1 restored by quiet diplomacy in
I which our allies will have to play
! a principal part. This could, per
! haps, be supplemented by making
i a new use of an old idea.
As originally conceived when
the Charter of the United Nations
was written, the Security Council
; was to be attended regularly by
the Foreign Ministers themselves.
: Fifteen years ago it seemed incon
venient, and perhaps not too im
portant, for the Foreign Ministers
to cross the ocean once a month
to attend the meetings of the Se
curity Council.
But now, it might do much good
if they did come once.a month for
at least a few days. Then it would
not be necessary for them to have
:so many special meetings in vari
ous parts of the world.
When they were at the U.N. in
| New York City on regular busi-
I ness, they could discuss anything
I they liked. The meetings would
! be normal and routine and there
! fore much quieter and more effec
! live. In addition, they would be
assisted by the extraordinarily ef-
I ficient Secretariat of the United
I Nations.
This would provide the great
! powers with a means and with an
adequate reason for communicat
! ing officially and unofficially with ;
1 the Soviet Foreign Minister.
If the affair of the U-2 is dis
i posed of amicably, which, as the
record now stands, it ought to be,
it might be a good idea for Secre
tary Herter to jjo to New York,
assuming that Mr. Lloyd and Mr.
Couve de Murville came too. He
might go there to discuss our
open skies proposal, disarmament,
and above all what have you.
