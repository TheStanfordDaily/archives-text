# Business School Joins Two Worlds

"The business school should
provide a research service to the
business community. It should be
a place to which industry can
come for the latest developments
in research into business practice
and in decision - making tech
niques," said Dean Ernest Ar
buckle of the Stanford Graduate
School of Business.
Upon earning his M.B.A.at Stan
ford, he pursued an extensive bus
iness career and held a position as
executive vice-president of a divi
sion of Grace Lines until he de
cided fo accept the deanship. Al
ready closely associated with
Stanford, he was at that time a
member of the Board of Trustees,
and actively engaged in the
search for a replacement for Dean
Jackson who was then retiring.
Business Experience
Arbuckle brought with him a
wealth of business experience, but
admits to having had doubts re
garding his qualifications as a
business school administrator.
His non-academic experience
has strengthened his convictions
regarding the purposes, goals and
methods of a business school. "Re
search must be emphasized," he
asserts. "It should be that kind
of research that makes for more
live, imaginative, creative teach
ing." A proper balance of the two
results in superior training for
students and at the same time ful
fills the school's responsibility for
creating new knowledge.
Weighty Title
"The importance of research is
outlined here," he said, tapping a
red-covered booklet bearing the
weighty title "Long Range Pro
gram, Graduate School of Busi
ness, Stanford University: A
Statement of Philosophy, Objec
tives, and Needs."
The real need of industry for
research centers, according to Ar
buckle, is illustrated by the re
cent $1.5 million Ford Foundation
grant which emphasizes research
activities. And at least a partial
basis for their decision was estab
lished by the Foundation after a
study of the contents of the 60-
page report.

Related to this is the Dean's in
sistence on broad training. He
concedes that development of the
curriculum is a job that must be
worked on continuously. "In our
overhaul we are giving more em
phasis to the relevant behavioral
I sciences, quantitative analysis,
j and the external environment of
business."
Fund-Raising Campaign
Arbuckle, who recently headed
a $10 million fund-raising cam
paign for the United Bay Crusade,
i is deeply concerned with the mu
tual responsibilities and relation
ships of school and community.
| "We must avoid the danger of be
coming a cloistered community,
but still maintain an essentially
academic character," he points
out.
At Ihe same time the Dean
hopes to develop a closer relation
ship between the school and lead
ers in business and industry. A
I significant mark towards this end,
j of Dean Arbuckle's own devising,
, is tlie establishment of the Stan
' ford Affiliates. This group is
"dedicated to the development of
tomorrow's business leadership."
Composed of outstanding busi
ness figures from all over the
United States, the Affiliates serve
in an advisory capacity. They
have devised a unique study-now
| pay-later loan program through

i which graduate students may ob
j tain a business education using
regular banking channels. The
plan is based on the potential in
| creased earning capacity the stu
dent will gain from his two years
in the business school.
The Dean outlined specific areas
of emphasis within the school it
self. "First of all," lie states, "we
I want the best students in the
country." He was pleased to relate
that over 800 applications have
been received for next fall's class
which is limited to 200 students.
! This high ratio is indicative of a
I growing recognition of Stanford's
: leading role among the business
; schools across the nation.
Recruiting Program
The school lias embarked upon
j plans to acquaint students and
i businessmen of the opportunities
j derived from business education,
j A part of this is a recruiting pro
i gram, in which Deans Charles An
i derson and Leonar d Marks visited
| 41 major universities this year.
Arbuckle added that another
major program is the recruitment
lof faculty. "Like most .schools,
i we are plagued with the problem
i of professors, not having enough
; time for students. Large classes
and heavy teaching loads leave in
sufficient time for research and
individual projects, as well as stu
! dent counselling."

This emphasis is linked with
plans for strengthening the Ph.D.
program. Supplementing the fac
ulty will allow the school to ac
cept more and better Ph.D. candi
dates. This is particularly impor
tant. according to Arbuckle. "In
the near future there will he a
great demand for qualified pro
fessors in the field of business."
Educational Programs
In addition to projects designed
to forward the regular 13.A. and
doctoral programs, the adminis
tration is actively engaged in ed
ucational programs for those al
ready holding administrative po
sitions. These include a summer
program which will open campus
facilities for informal seminars
conducted by the faculty for busi
nessmen.
A $3..") million Ford Foundation
sponsored project is an innovation
in international business educa
tion. This program, just getting
under way, will attract leading
business educators from all ovei
the world to the Stanford campus
and focus attention on the Busi
ness School as a center of educa
tion for the management of inter
national business.
"The business school is the
bridge between the world of ideas
and the world of business, the syn
thesis of theory and practice,"
Dean Arbuckle concluded.
