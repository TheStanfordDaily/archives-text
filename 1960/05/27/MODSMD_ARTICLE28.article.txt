Congratulations
Editor, the Daily:
Before this volume of the Daily
comes to an end, I want to con
gratulate the present editors.
Your reporting of the Hoover In
stitute problem and the recent
Un-American Activities Commit
tee hearings was in the 1 highest
tradition of responsible journal
ism objective, thorough, intelli
gent.
In my ten years at Stanford I
have never real a volume of the
Daily with more pleasure and
profit, and many of my colleagues
have expressed a similar opinion.
By addressing your audience in
this mature way, you have, I sus
pect, done a good deal to create
a demand in that audience for
similar treatment in the future.
I wish good luck to the new
editors and hope that they profit
by the precedents you have estab
lished.

Appreciation
Editor, the Daily:
,1 am writing to express my
appreciation for the. fine job you
have do n e dur in g Ihe past
months. I think the paper has
struck an excellent balance be
tween concern with off-campus
issues and local matters.
In the former connection many
of your editorial positions have
seemed to me good ones, and I
wish to especially commend your
treatment of the recent Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee hear
ings.
On the other hand, you have
shown that local news need not
be confined to social and sports
events; the reporting of the con
troversy over the purposes of the
Hoover Institute was, in my opin
ion, a real service to the Univer
sity.
Thanks again, and best wishes.

Foreign Scholars
Editor, tlie Daily:
Our year as A.S.S.U. Foreign
Scholars will soon be over and
we will scatter to our home coun
tries or to other parts of the
United States. Before we do so,
we want to claim a little of your
space in which to express our
t hanks.
To spend a year in a leading
American university, with a dis
tinguished faculty, exacting stand
ards and lively students is an
experience which any young per
son from another country should
value highly.
Our thanks are due primarily
to the students of Stanford whose
Legislature maintains the pro
gram which brought us here. It
is quite common for university
administrations to give scholar
ships to students from other coun
tries but much less common for
student bodies 1o do so. We salute
the L.A.S.S.U. for providing 11
scholarships each year.
The members of the Foreign
Scholarship Commission were our
guides and shepherds during the
year. Our debt to them is very
great. We tried their patience
often but they never failed to
smile and be at our service. In
particular, we wish to thank the
Co-Chairmen, Dan Young and
Yvonne Olson, on whom the main
responsibility for our program
rested.
During the year, we were the
guests of the students in many
fraternities and residences. We
learned how friendly, generous
and considerate American stu
dents could be. We want them
to know how much we appreci
ated the chance to share in their
group living.
To President and Mrs. Sterling,
who received us in their home;
to Dr. Warmbrunn. the staff of
the I. Center and ihe Community
Committee; to the members of
the faculty, administration and
student body who showed us
American ways and discussed
them with us; to the staff of the
A.S.S.U. office - our grateful
thanks. We have gained a great
deal. We hope that we have given
something in return by our par

ticipation in thd life of the uni
versity.

Revitalization
l-;dilor, the Daily:
Before retiring from active duty
as lifeguards at Lake Lag. we
would like to present to the stu
dent body a few impressions and
suggested improvements in hopes
that the potential of the lake can
some day be more fully realized.
We know of no other campus
which can boast of a private lake
with 50 readily available canoes
only one block from a dormitory,
yet a typical afternoon crowd con
sists of perhaps 2."5 students using
112) canoes. Surely there are more
girls than those lying on the
cramped, land-locked, maleless
Flo Mo sun porch during the same
afternoon.
To eliminate this Lake Lag
phobia, we would first like to
quel 1 a few rumors circulating
around Quad.
1. No the lake is not contami
nated unless you feel tadpoles
and water lilies are dangerous.
2. No the lake is not too cold,
unless you cannot bear 67 degree
water.
3. No—you will not be classi
fied as a social climber or play
boy by walking over for a pre
dinner swim.
4. Yes — there are competent
lifeguards on duty every after
noon, although purposely incon
spicuous.
With the support of the student
body, very little money would be
required to make the following
improvements:
1. Paint the boathouse and
floats.
2. Initiate a publicity campaign
to eliminate Lake Lag phobia. We
would therefore like to propose
that the new ASSU undertake a
complete revitalizing of the facili
ties at the lake as their first proj
ect.

Letter of Thanks
Editor, the Daily:
. This is a letter of thanks from
one of the numberless many who
had always formerly assumed
that the Daily was predestine!
to be merely a collection of irrele
vant mealy ■mo u th ing s. You
showed us in the past few months
that the contrary is true, that
the Daily need only maintain a
standard of excellence in order
to maintain a position of import
ance in the Stanford Community.
This standard of excellence was
nowhere more evident than in
the Daily's covering of the Hoover
Institution mess and of the House
Un-American Activities Subcom
mittee meeting in San Francisco.
Your coverage of these two inci
dents successfully gave the lie to
those few bigots who seem to
think that the best way to achieve
freedom and unity in this coun
try is to suppress all controversy.
Good luck to your successors.

Criticism
liilitor, 4lm* Daily:
Ii is inconceivable that well-in-
I tentioned American citizens can
heap destructive criticism on the
! House Un • American Activities
1 Committee and understand com
munism or freedom. If they did,
normal reaction would be to write
constructive criticism designed to
eliminate injustices and improve
democratic procedures I'm- expos
ing communism.
Thursdays' Palo Alto Times
states "ST Stanford teacher's rap
S.F. police Brutality at Red
i probe charged; inquiry asked."
J Only the naive would not realize
the Communists would use this
scene for propaganda as they
used the summit conference. If
violence was necessary, Commu
nists would cause it. Communists
want the Committee abolished
| and nothing else established to
continue exposing their above
ground activities. Truly they di-
I vided and confused the citizens.
What a victory for the Commu
nists! Housewives, husbands, stu
dents and professors are engaged
in debate about the riot instead
of using brainpower to analyze
what the Committee said and why
(how many of us know what they
said?), how we can eliminate
abuses, what plans could we en
courage for exposing communism
above ground, why has commu
nism spread, have we failed in
enlightening ourselves and our
children? If so, is it not the great
privilege, the great moral duty of
mothers, fathers and professors to
I protect our children and ourselves
by doing so?
In J. Edgar Hoover's book "Mas
ters of Deceit." Hoover informs us
what William 'A. Foster, long-time
head of the Communist movement
in our country advocates. Fostor
said, "Under the dictatorship all
the capitalist parties- Republican,
Democratic. Progressive. Socialist,
etc. will lie liquidated, the Com
munist Party functioning alone
as the party of the toiling masses.
Likewise, will bo dissolved all
other organizations that are polit
ical props of the bourgeois rule,
including chambers of commerce,
Ie m pi o ye r s' association, rotary
clubs, American Legion, YMCA,
and such fraternal" organizations
as the Masons, Odd Fellows, Elks,
j Knights of Columbus, etc."
Hoover explains saying, "Under
this schedule many Americans are
eligible for liquidation not once
but several times, depending on
their present freely chosen affilia
tions and social interests."
Surely we understand the ruth
lessness and lawlessness of com
munism. Can we not unite in
forms of encouragement and con
structive criticism to defeat it?
Mrs. B. W. Meyer
Bookstore
Editor, l!»«* Daily:
Many congratulations to Mr.
Beltner N. Fleisher on his excel
lent letter one of the best I have
read in recent times. He certainly
did point up some of the biggest
faults of the bookstore.
It must be realized that a mere
new building does not make for
a new bookstore as such; and
how this is merely the latest proof
of the University's failure of its
policy of hiring the cheapest pos
sible non-academic help. When
will it learn? We are indeed lucky
to have persons of Mr. Fleisher 1 s
perceptivity around in order to
have ourselves reminded of such
; factors.
J. Stewart

Liberal Leftish
Editor, tlx* Daily:
According to a recent editorial
of May 19th in the Daily you
I quote "The University must be
forever maintained upon a strictly
non-part isan and non-sectarian
basis." And may I add if the
i Stanfords had anticipated the
; Communist threat of today they
would have no doubt added "Loy
j altv to one's Country and Law and
j Order."
Your Staff represents a very
small segment of the student
' body of Stanford and still for
: many years 1 he same small group
has retained control and consist
ently advocated the liberal leftish
slant villifying the American Le
i gion, the Daughters of the Amer
! ican Revolution and now the
Hou s e Un-American Activities
Committee. Why is this? How
can young Americans who should
[love and respect the country be
fooled by the tactics of the so
i called Liberals? I can only feel
i that the University Administra
i tion and the professors to a large
degree are responsible for this.
Parents send their children to
Stanford with the highest hopes.
We take it for granted that a
school such as Stanford will not
I only try to strengthen their in
tellectual and moral development
but that the Professors will in-
I spire them to be good citizens
and instill a love of Country in
i them.
May I close by saying that "It
is the genius of American free
dom that il must be rewon gen
eration after generation. There is
1 a tendency these days to think
100 much of its gifts and privi
leges and too little of ils obliga
tions and responsibilities."
Mrs. Elizabeth ('otter
A Disappointed Mother
Organization
Editor, the Daily:
| In his series of stimulating lec
! tures last week, Mr. Erwin D.
! Canham, "Editor of the Christian
Science Monitor, commented not
only on the economic condition
of this country but also on its
international relations.
In listing some eight important
factors needing attention in the
planning of our foreign policy,
he scarcely hinted at one which
may well be the most .important
of all. political organization of
the free democratic nations.
E\en now. too few people in
this country realize that the boast
ed greatness of the United States
is due not to its size, the intelli
gence of its people or its great
natural resources, but to the in
genious federal political system,
the federal union, embodied in
its constitution of 1787.
Today the free democratic na
tions of the world suffer from
the weakness which springs from
inadequate organization, repre
sented by .the UN, NATO. etc.
They cannot hope to make full
use of their great economic and
human resources until they de
vise and establish a political sys
tem which will ensure the effec
tive unification of the democratic
nations.
Eliot Blaekwelder

Ludicrous
Editor, the Daily:
Concerning the letter to The
Daily signed h\ the Antioeh Peace
Group, NAACP, and Socialist Dis
cussion Group. 1 confess 1 find
it ludicrous that a Socialist group
is "shocked at reports of police
brutality in the face of a peaceful
demonstration." I should like to
see what would happen if a group
of citizens in the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics attempted a
peaceful demonstration- for the
cause of a free economy.

4. Yes — there are competent

With the support of the student

required to make the following

1. Paint the boathouse and

Letter of Thanks
Editor, the Daily:
. This is a letter of thanks from
one of the numberless many who
had always formerly assumed
that the Daily was predestine!
to be merely a collection of irrele
vant mealy ■mo u th ing s. You
showed us in the past few months
that the contrary is true, that
the Daily need only maintain a
standard of excellence in order
to maintain a position of import
ance in the Stanford Community.
This standard of excellence was
nowhere more evident than in
the Daily's covering of the Hoover
Institution mess and of the House
Un-American Activities Subcom
mittee meeting in San Francisco.
Your coverage of these two inci
dents successfully gave the lie to
those few bigots who seem to
think that the best way to achieve
freedom and unity in this coun
try is to suppress all controversy.
Good luck to your successors.

liilitor, 4lm* Daily:
Ii is inconceivable that well-in-
I tentioned American citizens can
heap destructive criticism on the
! House Un • American Activities
1 Committee and understand com
munism or freedom. If they did,
normal reaction would be to write
constructive criticism designed to
eliminate injustices and improve

Thursdays' Palo Alto Times
states "ST Stanford teacher's rap

J Only the naive would not realize

used the summit conference. If
violence was necessary, Commu
nists would cause it. Communists
want the Committee abolished
| and nothing else established to
continue exposing their above
ground activities. Truly they di-
I vided and confused the citizens.
What a victory for the Commu
nists! Housewives, husbands, stu
dents and professors are engaged
in debate about the riot instead
of using brainpower to analyze
what the Committee said and why
(how many of us know what they
said?), how we can eliminate
abuses, what plans could we en
courage for exposing communism
above ground, why has commu
nism spread, have we failed in
enlightening ourselves and our
children? If so, is it not the great
privilege, the great moral duty of
mothers, fathers and professors to
I protect our children and ourselves
by doing so?
In J. Edgar Hoover's book "Mas
ters of Deceit." Hoover informs us
what William 'A. Foster, long-time
head of the Communist movement
in our country advocates. Fostor
said, "Under the dictatorship all
the capitalist parties- Republican,
Democratic. Progressive. Socialist,
etc. will lie liquidated, the Com
munist Party functioning alone
as the party of the toiling masses.
Likewise, will bo dissolved all
other organizations that are polit
ical props of the bourgeois rule,
including chambers of commerce,
Ie m pi o ye r s' association, rotary
clubs, American Legion, YMCA,
and such fraternal" organizations
as the Masons, Odd Fellows, Elks,
j Knights of Columbus, etc."
Hoover explains saying, "Under
this schedule many Americans are
eligible for liquidation not once
but several times, depending on
their present freely chosen affilia
tions and social interests."
Surely we understand the ruth
lessness and lawlessness of com
munism. Can we not unite in
forms of encouragement and con
structive criticism to defeat it?

Bookstore
Editor, l!»«* Daily:
Many congratulations to Mr.
Beltner N. Fleisher on his excel
lent letter one of the best I have
read in recent times. He certainly
did point up some of the biggest
faults of the bookstore.
It must be realized that a mere
new building does not make for
a new bookstore as such; and
how this is merely the latest proof
of the University's failure of its
policy of hiring the cheapest pos
sible non-academic help. When
will it learn? We are indeed lucky
to have persons of Mr. Fleisher 1 s
perceptivity around in order to
have ourselves reminded of such
; factors.

Editor, tlx* Daily:
According to a recent editorial
of May 19th in the Daily you
I quote "The University must be
forever maintained upon a strictly
non-part isan and non-sectarian
basis." And may I add if the
i Stanfords had anticipated the
; Communist threat of today they
would have no doubt added "Loy
j altv to one's Country and Law and
j Order."
Your Staff represents a very
small segment of the student
' body of Stanford and still for
: many years 1 he same small group
has retained control and consist
ently advocated the liberal leftish
slant villifying the American Le
i gion, the Daughters of the Amer
! ican Revolution and now the
Hou s e Un-American Activities
Committee. Why is this? How
can young Americans who should
[love and respect the country be
fooled by the tactics of the so
i called Liberals? I can only feel
i that the University Administra
i tion and the professors to a large
degree are responsible for this.
Parents send their children to
Stanford with the highest hopes.
We take it for granted that a
school such as Stanford will not
I only try to strengthen their in
tellectual and moral development
but that the Professors will in-
I spire them to be good citizens
and instill a love of Country in
i them.
May I close by saying that "It
is the genius of American free
dom that il must be rewon gen
eration after generation. There is
1 a tendency these days to think
100 much of its gifts and privi
leges and too little of ils obliga
tions and responsibilities."

A Disappointed Mother
Organization
Editor, the Daily:
| In his series of stimulating lec
! tures last week, Mr. Erwin D.
! Canham, "Editor of the Christian
Science Monitor, commented not
only on the economic condition
of this country but also on its
international relations.
In listing some eight important
factors needing attention in the
planning of our foreign policy,
he scarcely hinted at one which
may well be the most .important
of all. political organization of
the free democratic nations.
E\en now. too few people in
this country realize that the boast
ed greatness of the United States
is due not to its size, the intelli
gence of its people or its great
natural resources, but to the in
genious federal political system,
the federal union, embodied in
its constitution of 1787.
Today the free democratic na
tions of the world suffer from
the weakness which springs from
inadequate organization, repre
sented by .the UN, NATO. etc.
They cannot hope to make full
use of their great economic and
human resources until they de
vise and establish a political sys
tem which will ensure the effec
tive unification of the democratic
nations.

Ludicrous
Editor, the Daily:
Concerning the letter to The
Daily signed h\ the Antioeh Peace
Group, NAACP, and Socialist Dis
cussion Group. 1 confess 1 find
it ludicrous that a Socialist group
is "shocked at reports of police
brutality in the face of a peaceful
demonstration." I should like to
see what would happen if a group
of citizens in the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics attempted a
peaceful demonstration- for the
cause of a free economy.

Congratulations
Editor, the Daily:
Before this volume of the Daily
comes to an end, I want to con
gratulate the present editors.
Your reporting of the Hoover In
stitute problem and the recent
Un-American Activities Commit
tee hearings was in the 1 highest
tradition of responsible journal
ism objective, thorough, intelli
gent.
In my ten years at Stanford I
have never real a volume of the
Daily with more pleasure and
profit, and many of my colleagues
have expressed a similar opinion.
By addressing your audience in
this mature way, you have, I sus
pect, done a good deal to create
a demand in that audience for
similar treatment in the future.
I wish good luck to the new
editors and hope that they profit
by the precedents you have estab
lished.

Appreciation
Editor, the Daily:
,1 am writing to express my
appreciation for the. fine job you
have do n e dur in g Ihe past
months. I think the paper has
struck an excellent balance be
tween concern with off-campus
issues and local matters.
In the former connection many
of your editorial positions have
seemed to me good ones, and I
wish to especially commend your
treatment of the recent Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee hear
ings.
On the other hand, you have
shown that local news need not
be confined to social and sports
events; the reporting of the con
troversy over the purposes of the
Hoover Institute was, in my opin
ion, a real service to the Univer
sity.
Thanks again, and best wishes.

Foreign Scholars
Editor, tlie Daily:
Our year as A.S.S.U. Foreign
Scholars will soon be over and
we will scatter to our home coun
tries or to other parts of the
United States. Before we do so,
we want to claim a little of your
space in which to express our
t hanks.
To spend a year in a leading
American university, with a dis
tinguished faculty, exacting stand
ards and lively students is an
experience which any young per
son from another country should
value highly.
Our thanks are due primarily
to the students of Stanford whose
Legislature maintains the pro
gram which brought us here. It
is quite common for university
administrations to give scholar
ships to students from other coun
tries but much less common for
student bodies 1o do so. We salute
the L.A.S.S.U. for providing 11
scholarships each year.
The members of the Foreign
Scholarship Commission were our
guides and shepherds during the
year. Our debt to them is very
great. We tried their patience
often but they never failed to
smile and be at our service. In
particular, we wish to thank the
Co-Chairmen, Dan Young and
Yvonne Olson, on whom the main
responsibility for our program
rested.
During the year, we were the
guests of the students in many
fraternities and residences. We
learned how friendly, generous
and considerate American stu
dents could be. We want them
to know how much we appreci
ated the chance to share in their
group living.
To President and Mrs. Sterling,
who received us in their home;
to Dr. Warmbrunn. the staff of
the I. Center and ihe Community
Committee; to the members of
the faculty, administration and
student body who showed us
American ways and discussed
them with us; to the staff of the
A.S.S.U. office - our grateful
thanks. We have gained a great
deal. We hope that we have given
something in return by our par

ticipation in thd life of the uni
versity.

Revitalization
l-;dilor, the Daily:
Before retiring from active duty
as lifeguards at Lake Lag. we
would like to present to the stu
dent body a few impressions and
suggested improvements in hopes
that the potential of the lake can
some day be more fully realized.
We know of no other campus
which can boast of a private lake
with 50 readily available canoes
only one block from a dormitory,
yet a typical afternoon crowd con
sists of perhaps 2."5 students using
112) canoes. Surely there are more
girls than those lying on the
cramped, land-locked, maleless
Flo Mo sun porch during the same
afternoon.
To eliminate this Lake Lag
phobia, we would first like to
quel 1 a few rumors circulating
around Quad.
1. No the lake is not contami
nated unless you feel tadpoles
and water lilies are dangerous.
2. No the lake is not too cold,
unless you cannot bear 67 degree
water.
3. No—you will not be classi
fied as a social climber or play
boy by walking over for a pre
dinner swim.
4. Yes — there are competent
lifeguards on duty every after
noon, although purposely incon
spicuous.
With the support of the student
body, very little money would be
required to make the following
improvements:
1. Paint the boathouse and

2. Initiate a publicity campaign
to eliminate Lake Lag phobia. We
would therefore like to propose
that the new ASSU undertake a

i Stanfords had anticipated the

would have no doubt added "Loy
j altv to one's Country and Law and
j Order."
Your Staff represents a very
small segment of the student
' body of Stanford and still for
: many years 1 he same small group
has retained control and consist
ently advocated the liberal leftish
slant villifying the American Le
i gion, the Daughters of the Amer
! ican Revolution and now the
Hou s e Un-American Activities
Committee. Why is this? How
can young Americans who should
[love and respect the country be
fooled by the tactics of the so
i called Liberals? I can only feel
i that the University Administra
i tion and the professors to a large
degree are responsible for this.
Parents send their children to
Stanford with the highest hopes.
We take it for granted that a
school such as Stanford will not
I only try to strengthen their in
tellectual and moral development
but that the Professors will in-
I spire them to be good citizens
and instill a love of Country in
i them.
May I close by saying that "It
is the genius of American free
dom that il must be rewon gen
eration after generation. There is
1 a tendency these days to think
100 much of its gifts and privi
leges and too little of ils obliga

A Disappointed Mother
Organization
Editor, the Daily:
| In his series of stimulating lec
! tures last week, Mr. Erwin D.
! Canham, "Editor of the Christian
Science Monitor, commented not
only on the economic condition
of this country but also on its
international relations.
In listing some eight important
factors needing attention in the
planning of our foreign policy,
he scarcely hinted at one which
may well be the most .important
of all. political organization of
the free democratic nations.
E\en now. too few people in
this country realize that the boast
ed greatness of the United States
is due not to its size, the intelli
gence of its people or its great
natural resources, but to the in
genious federal political system,
the federal union, embodied in
its constitution of 1787.
Today the free democratic na
tions of the world suffer from
the weakness which springs from
inadequate organization, repre
sented by .the UN, NATO. etc.
They cannot hope to make full
use of their great economic and
human resources until they de
vise and establish a political sys
tem which will ensure the effec
tive unification of the democratic
nations.

Ludicrous
Editor, the Daily:
Concerning the letter to The
Daily signed h\ the Antioeh Peace
Group, NAACP, and Socialist Dis
cussion Group. 1 confess 1 find
it ludicrous that a Socialist group
is "shocked at reports of police
brutality in the face of a peaceful
demonstration." I should like to
see what would happen if a group
of citizens in the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics attempted a
peaceful demonstration- for the
cause of a free economy.

Congratulations
Editor, the Daily:
Before this volume of the Daily
comes to an end, I want to con
gratulate the present editors.
Your reporting of the Hoover In
stitute problem and the recent
Un-American Activities Commit
tee hearings was in the 1 highest
tradition of responsible journal
ism objective, thorough, intelli
gent.
In my ten years at Stanford I
have never real a volume of the
Daily with more pleasure and
profit, and many of my colleagues
have expressed a similar opinion.
By addressing your audience in
this mature way, you have, I sus
pect, done a good deal to create
a demand in that audience for
similar treatment in the future.
I wish good luck to the new
editors and hope that they profit
by the precedents you have estab
lished.

Appreciation
Editor, the Daily:
,1 am writing to express my
appreciation for the. fine job you
have do n e dur in g Ihe past
months. I think the paper has
struck an excellent balance be
tween concern with off-campus
issues and local matters.
In the former connection many
of your editorial positions have
seemed to me good ones, and I
wish to especially commend your
treatment of the recent Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee hear
ings.
On the other hand, you have
shown that local news need not
be confined to social and sports
events; the reporting of the con
troversy over the purposes of the
Hoover Institute was, in my opin
ion, a real service to the Univer
sity.
Thanks again, and best wishes.

Foreign Scholars
Editor, tlie Daily:
Our year as A.S.S.U. Foreign
Scholars will soon be over and
we will scatter to our home coun
tries or to other parts of the
United States. Before we do so,
we want to claim a little of your
space in which to express our
t hanks.
To spend a year in a leading
American university, with a dis
tinguished faculty, exacting stand
ards and lively students is an
experience which any young per
son from another country should
value highly.
Our thanks are due primarily
to the students of Stanford whose
Legislature maintains the pro
gram which brought us here. It
is quite common for university
administrations to give scholar
ships to students from other coun
tries but much less common for
student bodies 1o do so. We salute
the L.A.S.S.U. for providing 11
scholarships each year.
The members of the Foreign
Scholarship Commission were our
guides and shepherds during the
year. Our debt to them is very
great. We tried their patience
often but they never failed to
smile and be at our service. In
particular, we wish to thank the
Co-Chairmen, Dan Young and
Yvonne Olson, on whom the main
responsibility for our program
rested.
During the year, we were the
guests of the students in many
fraternities and residences. We
learned how friendly, generous
and considerate American stu
dents could be. We want them
to know how much we appreci
ated the chance to share in their
group living.
To President and Mrs. Sterling,
who received us in their home;
to Dr. Warmbrunn. the staff of
the I. Center and ihe Community
Committee; to the members of
the faculty, administration and
student body who showed us
American ways and discussed
them with us; to the staff of the
A.S.S.U. office - our grateful
thanks. We have gained a great
deal. We hope that we have given
something in return by our par

ticipation in thd life of the uni
versity.

Revitalization
l-;dilor, the Daily:
Before retiring from active duty
as lifeguards at Lake Lag. we
would like to present to the stu
dent body a few impressions and
suggested improvements in hopes
that the potential of the lake can
some day be more fully realized.
We know of no other campus
which can boast of a private lake
with 50 readily available canoes
only one block from a dormitory,
yet a typical afternoon crowd con
sists of perhaps 2."5 students using
112) canoes. Surely there are more
girls than those lying on the
cramped, land-locked, maleless
Flo Mo sun porch during the same
afternoon.
To eliminate this Lake Lag
phobia, we would first like to
quel 1 a few rumors circulating
around Quad.
1. No the lake is not contami
nated unless you feel tadpoles
and water lilies are dangerous.
2. No the lake is not too cold,
unless you cannot bear 67 degree
water.
3. No—you will not be classi
fied as a social climber or play
boy by walking over for a pre
dinner swim.
4. Yes — there are competent
lifeguards on duty every after
noon, although purposely incon
spicuous.
With the support of the student
body, very little money would be
required to make the following
improvements:
1. Paint the boathouse and
floats.
2. Initiate a publicity campaign
to eliminate Lake Lag phobia. We
would therefore like to propose
that the new ASSU undertake a
complete revitalizing of the facili
ties at the lake as their first proj
ect.

Letter of Thanks
Editor, the Daily:
. This is a letter of thanks from
one of the numberless many who
had always formerly assumed
that the Daily was predestine!
to be merely a collection of irrele
vant mealy ■mo u th ing s. You
showed us in the past few months
that the contrary is true, that
the Daily need only maintain a
standard of excellence in order
to maintain a position of import
ance in the Stanford Community.
This standard of excellence was
nowhere more evident than in
the Daily's covering of the Hoover
Institution mess and of the House
Un-American Activities Subcom
mittee meeting in San Francisco.
Your coverage of these two inci
dents successfully gave the lie to
those few bigots who seem to
think that the best way to achieve
freedom and unity in this coun
try is to suppress all controversy.
Good luck to your successors.

Criticism
liilitor, 4lm* Daily:
Ii is inconceivable that well-in-
I tentioned American citizens can
heap destructive criticism on the
! House Un • American Activities
1 Committee and understand com
munism or freedom. If they did,
normal reaction would be to write
constructive criticism designed to
eliminate injustices and improve
democratic procedures I'm- expos
ing communism.
Thursdays' Palo Alto Times
states "ST Stanford teacher's rap
S.F. police Brutality at Red
i probe charged; inquiry asked."
J Only the naive would not realize
the Communists would use this
scene for propaganda as they
used the summit conference. If
violence was necessary, Commu
nists would cause it. Communists
want the Committee abolished
| and nothing else established to
continue exposing their above
ground activities. Truly they di-
I vided and confused the citizens.
What a victory for the Commu
nists! Housewives, husbands, stu
dents and professors are engaged
in debate about the riot instead
of using brainpower to analyze
what the Committee said and why
(how many of us know what they
said?), how we can eliminate
abuses, what plans could we en
courage for exposing communism
above ground, why has commu
nism spread, have we failed in
enlightening ourselves and our
children? If so, is it not the great
privilege, the great moral duty of
mothers, fathers and professors to
I protect our children and ourselves
by doing so?
In J. Edgar Hoover's book "Mas
ters of Deceit." Hoover informs us
what William 'A. Foster, long-time
head of the Communist movement
in our country advocates. Fostor
said, "Under the dictatorship all
the capitalist parties- Republican,
Democratic. Progressive. Socialist,
etc. will lie liquidated, the Com
munist Party functioning alone
as the party of the toiling masses.
Likewise, will bo dissolved all
other organizations that are polit
ical props of the bourgeois rule,
including chambers of commerce,
Ie m pi o ye r s' association, rotary
clubs, American Legion, YMCA,
and such fraternal" organizations
as the Masons, Odd Fellows, Elks,
j Knights of Columbus, etc."
Hoover explains saying, "Under
this schedule many Americans are
eligible for liquidation not once
but several times, depending on
their present freely chosen affilia
tions and social interests."
Surely we understand the ruth
lessness and lawlessness of com
munism. Can we not unite in
forms of encouragement and con
structive criticism to defeat it?

Bookstore
Editor, l!»«* Daily:
Many congratulations to Mr.
Beltner N. Fleisher on his excel
lent letter one of the best I have
read in recent times. He certainly
did point up some of the biggest
faults of the bookstore.
It must be realized that a mere
new building does not make for
a new bookstore as such; and
how this is merely the latest proof
of the University's failure of its
policy of hiring the cheapest pos
sible non-academic help. When
will it learn? We are indeed lucky
to have persons of Mr. Fleisher 1 s
perceptivity around in order to
have ourselves reminded of such
; factors.

we want to claim a little of your
space in which to express our
t hanks.
To spend a year in a leading
American university, with a dis
tinguished faculty, exacting stand
ards and lively students is an
experience which any young per
son from another country should
value highly.
Our thanks are due primarily
to the students of Stanford whose
Legislature maintains the pro
gram which brought us here. It
is quite common for university
administrations to give scholar
ships to students from other coun
tries but much less common for
student bodies 1o do so. We salute
the L.A.S.S.U. for providing 11
scholarships each year.
The members of the Foreign
Scholarship Commission were our
guides and shepherds during the
year. Our debt to them is very
great. We tried their patience
often but they never failed to
smile and be at our service. In
particular, we wish to thank the
Co-Chairmen, Dan Young and
Yvonne Olson, on whom the main
responsibility for our program
rested.
During the year, we were the
guests of the students in many
fraternities and residences. We
learned how friendly, generous
and considerate American stu
dents could be. We want them
to know how much we appreci
ated the chance to share in their
group living.
To President and Mrs. Sterling,
who received us in their home;
to Dr. Warmbrunn. the staff of
the I. Center and ihe Community
Committee; to the members of
the faculty, administration and
student body who showed us
American ways and discussed
them with us; to the staff of the
A.S.S.U. office - our grateful
thanks. We have gained a great
deal. We hope that we have given
something in return by our par

ticipation in thd life of the uni
versity.

Revitalization
l-;dilor, the Daily:
Before retiring from active duty
as lifeguards at Lake Lag. we
would like to present to the stu
dent body a few impressions and
suggested improvements in hopes
that the potential of the lake can
some day be more fully realized.
We know of no other campus
which can boast of a private lake
with 50 readily available canoes
only one block from a dormitory,
yet a typical afternoon crowd con
sists of perhaps 2."5 students using
112) canoes. Surely there are more
girls than those lying on the
cramped, land-locked, maleless
Flo Mo sun porch during the same
afternoon.
To eliminate this Lake Lag
phobia, we would first like to
quel 1 a few rumors circulating
around Quad.
1. No the lake is not contami
nated unless you feel tadpoles
and water lilies are dangerous.
2. No the lake is not too cold,
unless you cannot bear 67 degree
water.
3. No—you will not be classi
fied as a social climber or play
boy by walking over for a pre
dinner swim.
4. Yes — there are competent
lifeguards on duty every after
noon, although purposely incon
spicuous.
With the support of the student
body, very little money would be
required to make the following
improvements:
1. Paint the boathouse and
floats.
2. Initiate a publicity campaign
to eliminate Lake Lag phobia. We
would therefore like to propose
that the new ASSU undertake a
complete revitalizing of the facili
ties at the lake as their first proj
ect.

Letter of Thanks
Editor, the Daily:
. This is a letter of thanks from
one of the numberless many who
had always formerly assumed
that the Daily was predestine!
to be merely a collection of irrele
vant mealy ■mo u th ing s. You
showed us in the past few months
that the contrary is true, that
the Daily need only maintain a
standard of excellence in order
to maintain a position of import
ance in the Stanford Community.
This standard of excellence was
nowhere more evident than in
the Daily's covering of the Hoover
Institution mess and of the House
Un-American Activities Subcom
mittee meeting in San Francisco.
Your coverage of these two inci
dents successfully gave the lie to
those few bigots who seem to
think that the best way to achieve
freedom and unity in this coun
try is to suppress all controversy.
Good luck to your successors.

Criticism
liilitor, 4lm* Daily:
Ii is inconceivable that well-in-
I tentioned American citizens can
heap destructive criticism on the
! House Un • American Activities
1 Committee and understand com
munism or freedom. If they did,
normal reaction would be to write
constructive criticism designed to
eliminate injustices and improve
democratic procedures I'm- expos
ing communism.
Thursdays' Palo Alto Times
states "ST Stanford teacher's rap
S.F. police Brutality at Red
i probe charged; inquiry asked."
J Only the naive would not realize
the Communists would use this
scene for propaganda as they
used the summit conference. If
violence was necessary, Commu
nists would cause it. Communists
want the Committee abolished
| and nothing else established to
continue exposing their above
ground activities. Truly they di-
I vided and confused the citizens.
What a victory for the Commu
nists! Housewives, husbands, stu
dents and professors are engaged
in debate about the riot instead
of using brainpower to analyze
what the Committee said and why
(how many of us know what they
said?), how we can eliminate
abuses, what plans could we en
courage for exposing communism
above ground, why has commu
nism spread, have we failed in
enlightening ourselves and our
children? If so, is it not the great
privilege, the great moral duty of
mothers, fathers and professors to
I protect our children and ourselves
by doing so?
In J. Edgar Hoover's book "Mas
ters of Deceit." Hoover informs us
what William 'A. Foster, long-time
head of the Communist movement
in our country advocates. Fostor
said, "Under the dictatorship all
the capitalist parties- Republican,
Democratic. Progressive. Socialist,
etc. will lie liquidated, the Com
munist Party functioning alone
as the party of the toiling masses.
Likewise, will bo dissolved all
other organizations that are polit
ical props of the bourgeois rule,
including chambers of commerce,
Ie m pi o ye r s' association, rotary
clubs, American Legion, YMCA,
and such fraternal" organizations
as the Masons, Odd Fellows, Elks,
j Knights of Columbus, etc."
Hoover explains saying, "Under
this schedule many Americans are
eligible for liquidation not once
but several times, depending on
their present freely chosen affilia
tions and social interests."
Surely we understand the ruth
lessness and lawlessness of com
munism. Can we not unite in
forms of encouragement and con
structive criticism to defeat it?
Mrs. B. W. Meyer
Bookstore
Editor, l!»«* Daily:
Many congratulations to Mr.
Beltner N. Fleisher on his excel
lent letter one of the best I have
read in recent times. He certainly
did point up some of the biggest
faults of the bookstore.
It must be realized that a mere
new building does not make for
a new bookstore as such; and
how this is merely the latest proof
of the University's failure of its
policy of hiring the cheapest pos
sible non-academic help. When
will it learn? We are indeed lucky
to have persons of Mr. Fleisher 1 s
perceptivity around in order to
have ourselves reminded of such
; factors.
J. Stewart

Liberal Leftish
Editor, tlx* Daily:
According to a recent editorial
of May 19th in the Daily you
I quote "The University must be
forever maintained upon a strictly
non-part isan and non-sectarian
basis." And may I add if the
i Stanfords had anticipated the
; Communist threat of today they
would have no doubt added "Loy
j altv to one's Country and Law and
j Order."
Your Staff represents a very
small segment of the student
' body of Stanford and still for
: many years 1 he same small group
has retained control and consist
ently advocated the liberal leftish
slant villifying the American Le
i gion, the Daughters of the Amer
! ican Revolution and now the
Hou s e Un-American Activities
Committee. Why is this? How
can young Americans who should
[love and respect the country be
fooled by the tactics of the so
i called Liberals? I can only feel
i that the University Administra
i tion and the professors to a large
degree are responsible for this.
Parents send their children to
Stanford with the highest hopes.
We take it for granted that a
school such as Stanford will not
I only try to strengthen their in
tellectual and moral development
but that the Professors will in-
I spire them to be good citizens
and instill a love of Country in
i them.
May I close by saying that "It
is the genius of American free
dom that il must be rewon gen
eration after generation. There is
1 a tendency these days to think
100 much of its gifts and privi
leges and too little of ils obliga
tions and responsibilities."
Mrs. Elizabeth ('otter
A Disappointed Mother
Organization
Editor, the Daily:
| In his series of stimulating lec
! tures last week, Mr. Erwin D.
! Canham, "Editor of the Christian
Science Monitor, commented not
only on the economic condition
of this country but also on its
international relations.
In listing some eight important
factors needing attention in the
planning of our foreign policy,
he scarcely hinted at one which
may well be the most .important
of all. political organization of
the free democratic nations.
E\en now. too few people in
this country realize that the boast
ed greatness of the United States
is due not to its size, the intelli
gence of its people or its great
natural resources, but to the in
genious federal political system,
the federal union, embodied in
its constitution of 1787.
Today the free democratic na
tions of the world suffer from
the weakness which springs from
inadequate organization, repre
sented by .the UN, NATO. etc.
They cannot hope to make full
use of their great economic and
human resources until they de
vise and establish a political sys
tem which will ensure the effec
tive unification of the democratic
nations.
Eliot Blaekwelder

Ludicrous
Editor, the Daily:
Concerning the letter to The
Daily signed h\ the Antioeh Peace
Group, NAACP, and Socialist Dis
cussion Group. 1 confess 1 find
it ludicrous that a Socialist group
is "shocked at reports of police
brutality in the face of a peaceful
demonstration." I should like to
see what would happen if a group
of citizens in the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics attempted a
peaceful demonstration- for the
cause of a free economy.

Congratulations
Editor, the Daily:
Before this volume of the Daily
comes to an end, I want to con
gratulate the present editors.
Your reporting of the Hoover In
stitute problem and the recent
Un-American Activities Commit
tee hearings was in the 1 highest
tradition of responsible journal
ism objective, thorough, intelli
gent.
In my ten years at Stanford I
have never real a volume of the
Daily with more pleasure and
profit, and many of my colleagues
have expressed a similar opinion.
By addressing your audience in
this mature way, you have, I sus
pect, done a good deal to create
a demand in that audience for
similar treatment in the future.
I wish good luck to the new
editors and hope that they profit
by the precedents you have estab
lished.

Appreciation
Editor, the Daily:
,1 am writing to express my
appreciation for the. fine job you
have do n e dur in g Ihe past
months. I think the paper has
struck an excellent balance be
tween concern with off-campus
issues and local matters.
In the former connection many
of your editorial positions have
seemed to me good ones, and I
wish to especially commend your
treatment of the recent Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee hear
ings.
On the other hand, you have
shown that local news need not
be confined to social and sports
events; the reporting of the con
troversy over the purposes of the
Hoover Institute was, in my opin
ion, a real service to the Univer
sity.
Thanks again, and best wishes.

Thursdays' Palo Alto Times

J Only the naive would not realize

used the summit conference. If
violence was necessary, Commu
nists would cause it. Communists
want the Committee abolished

continue exposing their above
ground activities. Truly they di-
I vided and confused the citizens.
What a victory for the Commu
nists! Housewives, husbands, stu

in debate about the riot instead
of using brainpower to analyze
what the Committee said and why
(how many of us know what they
said?), how we can eliminate

enlightening ourselves and our
children? If so, is it not the great
privilege, the great moral duty of
mothers, fathers and professors to

by doing so?
In J. Edgar Hoover's book "Mas

what William 'A. Foster, long-time
head of the Communist movement
in our country advocates. Fostor
said, "Under the dictatorship all
the capitalist parties- Republican,
Democratic. Progressive. Socialist,
etc. will lie liquidated, the Com
munist Party functioning alone
as the party of the toiling masses.
Likewise, will bo dissolved all
other organizations that are polit
ical props of the bourgeois rule,
including chambers of commerce,
Ie m pi o ye r s' association, rotary
clubs, American Legion, YMCA,
and such fraternal" organizations
as the Masons, Odd Fellows, Elks,
j Knights of Columbus, etc."
Hoover explains saying, "Under
this schedule many Americans are
eligible for liquidation not once
but several times, depending on
their present freely chosen affilia
tions and social interests."
Surely we understand the ruth
lessness and lawlessness of com
munism. Can we not unite in
forms of encouragement and con
structive criticism to defeat it?

Bookstore
Editor, l!»«* Daily:
Many congratulations to Mr.
Beltner N. Fleisher on his excel
lent letter one of the best I have
read in recent times. He certainly
did point up some of the biggest
faults of the bookstore.
It must be realized that a mere
new building does not make for
a new bookstore as such; and
how this is merely the latest proof
of the University's failure of its
policy of hiring the cheapest pos
sible non-academic help. When
will it learn? We are indeed lucky
to have persons of Mr. Fleisher 1 s
perceptivity around in order to
have ourselves reminded of such
; factors.

Editor, tlx* Daily:
According to a recent editorial
of May 19th in the Daily you
I quote "The University must be
forever maintained upon a strictly
non-part isan and non-sectarian
basis." And may I add if the
i Stanfords had anticipated the
; Communist threat of today they
would have no doubt added "Loy
j altv to one's Country and Law and
j Order."
Your Staff represents a very
small segment of the student
' body of Stanford and still for
: many years 1 he same small group
has retained control and consist
ently advocated the liberal leftish
slant villifying the American Le
i gion, the Daughters of the Amer
! ican Revolution and now the
Hou s e Un-American Activities
Committee. Why is this? How
can young Americans who should
[love and respect the country be
fooled by the tactics of the so
i called Liberals? I can only feel
i that the University Administra
i tion and the professors to a large
degree are responsible for this.
Parents send their children to
Stanford with the highest hopes.
We take it for granted that a
school such as Stanford will not
I only try to strengthen their in
tellectual and moral development
but that the Professors will in-
I spire them to be good citizens
and instill a love of Country in
i them.
May I close by saying that "It
is the genius of American free
dom that il must be rewon gen
eration after generation. There is
1 a tendency these days to think
100 much of its gifts and privi
leges and too little of ils obliga
tions and responsibilities."

Organization
Editor, the Daily:
| In his series of stimulating lec
! tures last week, Mr. Erwin D.
! Canham, "Editor of the Christian
Science Monitor, commented not
only on the economic condition
of this country but also on its
international relations.
In listing some eight important
factors needing attention in the
planning of our foreign policy,
he scarcely hinted at one which
may well be the most .important
of all. political organization of
the free democratic nations.
E\en now. too few people in
this country realize that the boast
ed greatness of the United States
is due not to its size, the intelli
gence of its people or its great
natural resources, but to the in
genious federal political system,
the federal union, embodied in
its constitution of 1787.
Today the free democratic na
tions of the world suffer from
the weakness which springs from
inadequate organization, repre
sented by .the UN, NATO. etc.
They cannot hope to make full
use of their great economic and
human resources until they de
vise and establish a political sys
tem which will ensure the effec
tive unification of the democratic
nations.

Ludicrous
Editor, the Daily:
Concerning the letter to The
Daily signed h\ the Antioeh Peace
Group, NAACP, and Socialist Dis
cussion Group. 1 confess 1 find
it ludicrous that a Socialist group
is "shocked at reports of police
brutality in the face of a peaceful
demonstration." I should like to
see what would happen if a group
of citizens in the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics attempted a
peaceful demonstration- for the
cause of a free economy.

Congratulations
Editor, the Daily:
Before this volume of the Daily
comes to an end, I want to con
gratulate the present editors.
Your reporting of the Hoover In
stitute problem and the recent
Un-American Activities Commit
tee hearings was in the 1 highest
tradition of responsible journal
ism objective, thorough, intelli
gent.
In my ten years at Stanford I
have never real a volume of the
Daily with more pleasure and
profit, and many of my colleagues
have expressed a similar opinion.
By addressing your audience in
this mature way, you have, I sus
pect, done a good deal to create
a demand in that audience for
similar treatment in the future.
I wish good luck to the new
editors and hope that they profit
by the precedents you have estab
lished.

Appreciation
Editor, the Daily:
,1 am writing to express my
appreciation for the. fine job you
have do n e dur in g Ihe past
months. I think the paper has
struck an excellent balance be
tween concern with off-campus
issues and local matters.
In the former connection many
of your editorial positions have
seemed to me good ones, and I
wish to especially commend your
treatment of the recent Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee hear
ings.
On the other hand, you have
shown that local news need not
be confined to social and sports
events; the reporting of the con
troversy over the purposes of the
Hoover Institute was, in my opin
ion, a real service to the Univer
sity.
Thanks again, and best wishes.

Foreign Scholars
Editor, tlie Daily:
Our year as A.S.S.U. Foreign
Scholars will soon be over and
we will scatter to our home coun
tries or to other parts of the
United States. Before we do so,
we want to claim a little of your
space in which to express our
t hanks.
To spend a year in a leading
American university, with a dis
tinguished faculty, exacting stand
ards and lively students is an
experience which any young per
son from another country should
value highly.
Our thanks are due primarily
to the students of Stanford whose
Legislature maintains the pro
gram which brought us here. It
is quite common for university
administrations to give scholar
ships to students from other coun
tries but much less common for
student bodies 1o do so. We salute
the L.A.S.S.U. for providing 11
scholarships each year.
The members of the Foreign
Scholarship Commission were our
guides and shepherds during the
year. Our debt to them is very
great. We tried their patience
often but they never failed to
smile and be at our service. In
particular, we wish to thank the
Co-Chairmen, Dan Young and
Yvonne Olson, on whom the main
responsibility for our program
rested.
During the year, we were the
guests of the students in many
fraternities and residences. We
learned how friendly, generous
and considerate American stu
dents could be. We want them
to know how much we appreci
ated the chance to share in their
group living.
To President and Mrs. Sterling,
who received us in their home;
to Dr. Warmbrunn. the staff of
the I. Center and ihe Community
Committee; to the members of
the faculty, administration and
student body who showed us
American ways and discussed
them with us; to the staff of the
A.S.S.U. office - our grateful
thanks. We have gained a great
deal. We hope that we have given
something in return by our par

ticipation in thd life of the uni
versity.

Revitalization
l-;dilor, the Daily:
Before retiring from active duty
as lifeguards at Lake Lag. we
would like to present to the stu
dent body a few impressions and
suggested improvements in hopes
that the potential of the lake can
some day be more fully realized.
We know of no other campus
which can boast of a private lake
with 50 readily available canoes
only one block from a dormitory,
yet a typical afternoon crowd con
sists of perhaps 2."5 students using
112) canoes. Surely there are more
girls than those lying on the
cramped, land-locked, maleless
Flo Mo sun porch during the same
afternoon.
To eliminate this Lake Lag
phobia, we would first like to
quel 1 a few rumors circulating
around Quad.
1. No the lake is not contami
nated unless you feel tadpoles
and water lilies are dangerous.
2. No the lake is not too cold,
unless you cannot bear 67 degree
water.
3. No—you will not be classi
fied as a social climber or play
boy by walking over for a pre
dinner swim.
4. Yes — there are competent
lifeguards on duty every after
noon, although purposely incon
spicuous.
With the support of the student
body, very little money would be
required to make the following
improvements:
1. Paint the boathouse and
floats.
2. Initiate a publicity campaign
to eliminate Lake Lag phobia. We
would therefore like to propose
that the new ASSU undertake a
complete revitalizing of the facili
ties at the lake as their first proj
ect.

Letter of Thanks
Editor, the Daily:
. This is a letter of thanks from
one of the numberless many who
had always formerly assumed
that the Daily was predestine!
to be merely a collection of irrele
vant mealy ■mo u th ing s. You
showed us in the past few months
that the contrary is true, that
the Daily need only maintain a
standard of excellence in order
to maintain a position of import
ance in the Stanford Community.
This standard of excellence was
nowhere more evident than in
the Daily's covering of the Hoover
Institution mess and of the House
Un-American Activities Subcom
mittee meeting in San Francisco.
Your coverage of these two inci
dents successfully gave the lie to
those few bigots who seem to
think that the best way to achieve
freedom and unity in this coun
try is to suppress all controversy.
Good luck to your successors.

may well be the most .important
of all. political organization of
the free democratic nations.
E\en now. too few people in
this country realize that the boast
ed greatness of the United States
is due not to its size, the intelli
gence of its people or its great
natural resources, but to the in
genious federal political system,
the federal union, embodied in
its constitution of 1787.
Today the free democratic na
tions of the world suffer from
the weakness which springs from
inadequate organization, repre
sented by .the UN, NATO. etc.
They cannot hope to make full
use of their great economic and
human resources until they de
vise and establish a political sys
tem which will ensure the effec
tive unification of the democratic
nations.

Ludicrous
Editor, the Daily:
Concerning the letter to The
Daily signed h\ the Antioeh Peace
Group, NAACP, and Socialist Dis
cussion Group. 1 confess 1 find
it ludicrous that a Socialist group
is "shocked at reports of police
brutality in the face of a peaceful
demonstration." I should like to
see what would happen if a group
of citizens in the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics attempted a
peaceful demonstration- for the
cause of a free economy.

Congratulations
Editor, the Daily:
Before this volume of the Daily
comes to an end, I want to con
gratulate the present editors.
Your reporting of the Hoover In
stitute problem and the recent
Un-American Activities Commit
tee hearings was in the 1 highest
tradition of responsible journal
ism objective, thorough, intelli
gent.
In my ten years at Stanford I
have never real a volume of the
Daily with more pleasure and
profit, and many of my colleagues
have expressed a similar opinion.
By addressing your audience in
this mature way, you have, I sus
pect, done a good deal to create
a demand in that audience for
similar treatment in the future.
I wish good luck to the new
editors and hope that they profit
by the precedents you have estab
lished.

Appreciation
Editor, the Daily:
,1 am writing to express my
appreciation for the. fine job you
have do n e dur in g Ihe past
months. I think the paper has
struck an excellent balance be
tween concern with off-campus
issues and local matters.
In the former connection many
of your editorial positions have
seemed to me good ones, and I
wish to especially commend your
treatment of the recent Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee hear
ings.
On the other hand, you have
shown that local news need not
be confined to social and sports
events; the reporting of the con
troversy over the purposes of the
Hoover Institute was, in my opin
ion, a real service to the Univer
sity.
Thanks again, and best wishes.

Foreign Scholars
Editor, tlie Daily:
Our year as A.S.S.U. Foreign
Scholars will soon be over and
we will scatter to our home coun
tries or to other parts of the
United States. Before we do so,
we want to claim a little of your
space in which to express our
t hanks.
To spend a year in a leading
American university, with a dis
tinguished faculty, exacting stand
ards and lively students is an
experience which any young per
son from another country should
value highly.
Our thanks are due primarily
to the students of Stanford whose
Legislature maintains the pro
gram which brought us here. It
is quite common for university
administrations to give scholar
ships to students from other coun
tries but much less common for
student bodies 1o do so. We salute
the L.A.S.S.U. for providing 11
scholarships each year.
The members of the Foreign
Scholarship Commission were our
guides and shepherds during the
year. Our debt to them is very
great. We tried their patience
often but they never failed to
smile and be at our service. In
particular, we wish to thank the
Co-Chairmen, Dan Young and
Yvonne Olson, on whom the main
responsibility for our program
rested.
During the year, we were the
guests of the students in many
fraternities and residences. We
learned how friendly, generous
and considerate American stu
dents could be. We want them
to know how much we appreci
ated the chance to share in their
group living.
To President and Mrs. Sterling,
who received us in their home;
to Dr. Warmbrunn. the staff of
the I. Center and ihe Community
Committee; to the members of
the faculty, administration and
student body who showed us
American ways and discussed
them with us; to the staff of the
A.S.S.U. office - our grateful
thanks. We have gained a great
deal. We hope that we have given
something in return by our par

ticipation in thd life of the uni
versity.

Revitalization
l-;dilor, the Daily:
Before retiring from active duty
as lifeguards at Lake Lag. we
would like to present to the stu
dent body a few impressions and
suggested improvements in hopes
that the potential of the lake can
some day be more fully realized.
We know of no other campus
which can boast of a private lake
with 50 readily available canoes
only one block from a dormitory,
yet a typical afternoon crowd con
sists of perhaps 2."5 students using
112) canoes. Surely there are more
girls than those lying on the
cramped, land-locked, maleless
Flo Mo sun porch during the same
afternoon.
To eliminate this Lake Lag
phobia, we would first like to
quel 1 a few rumors circulating
around Quad.
1. No the lake is not contami
nated unless you feel tadpoles
and water lilies are dangerous.
2. No the lake is not too cold,
unless you cannot bear 67 degree
water.
3. No—you will not be classi
fied as a social climber or play
boy by walking over for a pre
dinner swim.
4. Yes — there are competent
lifeguards on duty every after
noon, although purposely incon
spicuous.
With the support of the student
body, very little money would be
required to make the following
improvements:
1. Paint the boathouse and
floats.
2. Initiate a publicity campaign
to eliminate Lake Lag phobia. We
would therefore like to propose
that the new ASSU undertake a
complete revitalizing of the facili
ties at the lake as their first proj
ect.

Letter of Thanks
Editor, the Daily:
. This is a letter of thanks from
one of the numberless many who
had always formerly assumed
that the Daily was predestine!
to be merely a collection of irrele
vant mealy ■mo u th ing s. You
showed us in the past few months
that the contrary is true, that
the Daily need only maintain a
standard of excellence in order
to maintain a position of import
ance in the Stanford Community.
This standard of excellence was
nowhere more evident than in
the Daily's covering of the Hoover
Institution mess and of the House
Un-American Activities Subcom
mittee meeting in San Francisco.
Your coverage of these two inci
dents successfully gave the lie to
those few bigots who seem to
think that the best way to achieve
freedom and unity in this coun
try is to suppress all controversy.
Good luck to your successors.

Criticism
liilitor, 4lm* Daily:
Ii is inconceivable that well-in-
I tentioned American citizens can
heap destructive criticism on the
! House Un • American Activities
1 Committee and understand com
munism or freedom. If they did,
normal reaction would be to write
constructive criticism designed to
eliminate injustices and improve
democratic procedures I'm- expos
ing communism.
Thursdays' Palo Alto Times
states "ST Stanford teacher's rap
S.F. police Brutality at Red
i probe charged; inquiry asked."
J Only the naive would not realize
the Communists would use this
scene for propaganda as they
used the summit conference. If
violence was necessary, Commu
nists would cause it. Communists
want the Committee abolished
| and nothing else established to
continue exposing their above
ground activities. Truly they di-
I vided and confused the citizens.
What a victory for the Commu
nists! Housewives, husbands, stu
dents and professors are engaged
in debate about the riot instead
of using brainpower to analyze
what the Committee said and why
(how many of us know what they
said?), how we can eliminate
abuses, what plans could we en
courage for exposing communism
above ground, why has commu
nism spread, have we failed in
enlightening ourselves and our
children? If so, is it not the great
privilege, the great moral duty of
mothers, fathers and professors to
I protect our children and ourselves
by doing so?
In J. Edgar Hoover's book "Mas
ters of Deceit." Hoover informs us
what William 'A. Foster, long-time
head of the Communist movement
in our country advocates. Fostor
said, "Under the dictatorship all
the capitalist parties- Republican,
Democratic. Progressive. Socialist,
etc. will lie liquidated, the Com
munist Party functioning alone
as the party of the toiling masses.
Likewise, will bo dissolved all
other organizations that are polit
ical props of the bourgeois rule,
including chambers of commerce,
Ie m pi o ye r s' association, rotary
clubs, American Legion, YMCA,
and such fraternal" organizations
as the Masons, Odd Fellows, Elks,
j Knights of Columbus, etc."
Hoover explains saying, "Under
this schedule many Americans are
eligible for liquidation not once
but several times, depending on
their present freely chosen affilia
tions and social interests."
Surely we understand the ruth
lessness and lawlessness of com
munism. Can we not unite in
forms of encouragement and con
structive criticism to defeat it?
Mrs. B. W. Meyer
Bookstore
Editor, l!»«* Daily:
Many congratulations to Mr.
Beltner N. Fleisher on his excel
lent letter one of the best I have
read in recent times. He certainly
did point up some of the biggest
faults of the bookstore.
It must be realized that a mere
new building does not make for
a new bookstore as such; and
how this is merely the latest proof
of the University's failure of its
policy of hiring the cheapest pos
sible non-academic help. When
will it learn? We are indeed lucky
to have persons of Mr. Fleisher 1 s
perceptivity around in order to
have ourselves reminded of such
; factors.
J. Stewart

Liberal Leftish
Editor, tlx* Daily:
According to a recent editorial
of May 19th in the Daily you
I quote "The University must be
forever maintained upon a strictly
non-part isan and non-sectarian
basis." And may I add if the
i Stanfords had anticipated the
; Communist threat of today they
would have no doubt added "Loy
j altv to one's Country and Law and
j Order."
Your Staff represents a very
small segment of the student
' body of Stanford and still for
: many years 1 he same small group
has retained control and consist
ently advocated the liberal leftish
slant villifying the American Le
i gion, the Daughters of the Amer
! ican Revolution and now the
Hou s e Un-American Activities
Committee. Why is this? How
can young Americans who should
[love and respect the country be
fooled by the tactics of the so
i called Liberals? I can only feel
i that the University Administra
i tion and the professors to a large
degree are responsible for this.
Parents send their children to
Stanford with the highest hopes.
We take it for granted that a
school such as Stanford will not
I only try to strengthen their in
tellectual and moral development
but that the Professors will in-
I spire them to be good citizens
and instill a love of Country in
i them.
May I close by saying that "It
is the genius of American free
dom that il must be rewon gen
eration after generation. There is
1 a tendency these days to think
100 much of its gifts and privi
leges and too little of ils obliga
tions and responsibilities."

Editor, the Daily:
| In his series of stimulating lec

only on the economic condition
of this country but also on its
international relations.
In listing some eight important
factors needing attention in the
planning of our foreign policy,
he scarcely hinted at one which
may well be the most .important
of all. political organization of
the free democratic nations.
E\en now. too few people in
this country realize that the boast

Revitalization
l-;dilor, the Daily:
Before retiring from active duty
as lifeguards at Lake Lag. we
would like to present to the stu
dent body a few impressions and
suggested improvements in hopes
that the potential of the lake can
some day be more fully realized.
We know of no other campus
which can boast of a private lake
with 50 readily available canoes
only one block from a dormitory,
yet a typical afternoon crowd con
sists of perhaps 2."5 students using
112) canoes. Surely there are more
girls than those lying on the
cramped, land-locked, maleless
Flo Mo sun porch during the same
afternoon.
To eliminate this Lake Lag
phobia, we would first like to
quel 1 a few rumors circulating
around Quad.
1. No the lake is not contami
nated unless you feel tadpoles
and water lilies are dangerous.
2. No the lake is not too cold,
unless you cannot bear 67 degree
water.
3. No—you will not be classi
fied as a social climber or play
boy by walking over for a pre
dinner swim.
4. Yes — there are competent
lifeguards on duty every after
noon, although purposely incon
spicuous.
With the support of the student
body, very little money would be
required to make the following
improvements:
1. Paint the boathouse and
floats.
2. Initiate a publicity campaign
to eliminate Lake Lag phobia. We
would therefore like to propose
that the new ASSU undertake a
complete revitalizing of the facili
ties at the lake as their first proj
ect.

Letter of Thanks
Editor, the Daily:
. This is a letter of thanks from
one of the numberless many who
had always formerly assumed
that the Daily was predestine!
to be merely a collection of irrele
vant mealy ■mo u th ing s. You
showed us in the past few months
that the contrary is true, that
the Daily need only maintain a
standard of excellence in order
to maintain a position of import
ance in the Stanford Community.
This standard of excellence was
nowhere more evident than in
the Daily's covering of the Hoover
Institution mess and of the House
Un-American Activities Subcom
mittee meeting in San Francisco.
Your coverage of these two inci
dents successfully gave the lie to
those few bigots who seem to
think that the best way to achieve
freedom and unity in this coun
try is to suppress all controversy.
Good luck to your successors.

Criticism
liilitor, 4lm* Daily:
Ii is inconceivable that well-in-
I tentioned American citizens can
heap destructive criticism on the
! House Un • American Activities
1 Committee and understand com
munism or freedom. If they did,
normal reaction would be to write
constructive criticism designed to
eliminate injustices and improve
democratic procedures I'm- expos
ing communism.
Thursdays' Palo Alto Times
states "ST Stanford teacher's rap
S.F. police Brutality at Red
i probe charged; inquiry asked."
J Only the naive would not realize
the Communists would use this
scene for propaganda as they
used the summit conference. If
violence was necessary, Commu
nists would cause it. Communists
want the Committee abolished
| and nothing else established to
continue exposing their above
ground activities. Truly they di-
I vided and confused the citizens.
What a victory for the Commu
nists! Housewives, husbands, stu
dents and professors are engaged
in debate about the riot instead
of using brainpower to analyze
what the Committee said and why
(how many of us know what they
said?), how we can eliminate
abuses, what plans could we en
courage for exposing communism
above ground, why has commu
nism spread, have we failed in
enlightening ourselves and our
children? If so, is it not the great
privilege, the great moral duty of
mothers, fathers and professors to
I protect our children and ourselves
by doing so?
In J. Edgar Hoover's book "Mas
ters of Deceit." Hoover informs us
what William 'A. Foster, long-time
head of the Communist movement
in our country advocates. Fostor
said, "Under the dictatorship all
the capitalist parties- Republican,
Democratic. Progressive. Socialist,
etc. will lie liquidated, the Com
munist Party functioning alone
as the party of the toiling masses.
Likewise, will bo dissolved all
other organizations that are polit
ical props of the bourgeois rule,
including chambers of commerce,
Ie m pi o ye r s' association, rotary
clubs, American Legion, YMCA,
and such fraternal" organizations
as the Masons, Odd Fellows, Elks,
j Knights of Columbus, etc."
Hoover explains saying, "Under
this schedule many Americans are
eligible for liquidation not once
but several times, depending on
their present freely chosen affilia
tions and social interests."
Surely we understand the ruth
lessness and lawlessness of com
munism. Can we not unite in
forms of encouragement and con
structive criticism to defeat it?
Mrs. B. W. Meyer
Bookstore
Editor, l!»«* Daily:
Many congratulations to Mr.
Beltner N. Fleisher on his excel
lent letter one of the best I have
read in recent times. He certainly
did point up some of the biggest
faults of the bookstore.
It must be realized that a mere
new building does not make for
a new bookstore as such; and
how this is merely the latest proof
of the University's failure of its
policy of hiring the cheapest pos
sible non-academic help. When
will it learn? We are indeed lucky
to have persons of Mr. Fleisher 1 s
perceptivity around in order to
have ourselves reminded of such
; factors.
J. Stewart

Liberal Leftish
Editor, tlx* Daily:
According to a recent editorial
of May 19th in the Daily you
I quote "The University must be
forever maintained upon a strictly
non-part isan and non-sectarian
basis." And may I add if the
i Stanfords had anticipated the
; Communist threat of today they
would have no doubt added "Loy
j altv to one's Country and Law and
j Order."
Your Staff represents a very
small segment of the student
' body of Stanford and still for
: many years 1 he same small group
has retained control and consist
ently advocated the liberal leftish
slant villifying the American Le
i gion, the Daughters of the Amer
! ican Revolution and now the
Hou s e Un-American Activities
Committee. Why is this? How
can young Americans who should
[love and respect the country be
fooled by the tactics of the so
i called Liberals? I can only feel
i that the University Administra
i tion and the professors to a large
degree are responsible for this.
Parents send their children to
Stanford with the highest hopes.
We take it for granted that a
school such as Stanford will not
I only try to strengthen their in
tellectual and moral development
but that the Professors will in-
I spire them to be good citizens
and instill a love of Country in
i them.
May I close by saying that "It
is the genius of American free
dom that il must be rewon gen
eration after generation. There is
1 a tendency these days to think
100 much of its gifts and privi
leges and too little of ils obliga
tions and responsibilities."

A Disappointed Mother
Organization
Editor, the Daily:
| In his series of stimulating lec
! tures last week, Mr. Erwin D.
! Canham, "Editor of the Christian
Science Monitor, commented not
only on the economic condition
of this country but also on its
international relations.
In listing some eight important
factors needing attention in the
planning of our foreign policy,
he scarcely hinted at one which
may well be the most .important
of all. political organization of
the free democratic nations.
E\en now. too few people in
this country realize that the boast
ed greatness of the United States
is due not to its size, the intelli
gence of its people or its great
natural resources, but to the in
genious federal political system,
the federal union, embodied in
its constitution of 1787.
Today the free democratic na
tions of the world suffer from
the weakness which springs from
inadequate organization, repre
sented by .the UN, NATO. etc.
They cannot hope to make full
use of their great economic and
human resources until they de
vise and establish a political sys
tem which will ensure the effec
tive unification of the democratic
nations.
Eliot Blaekwelder

Ludicrous
Editor, the Daily:
Concerning the letter to The
Daily signed h\ the Antioeh Peace
Group, NAACP, and Socialist Dis
cussion Group. 1 confess 1 find
it ludicrous that a Socialist group
is "shocked at reports of police
brutality in the face of a peaceful
demonstration." I should like to
see what would happen if a group
of citizens in the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics attempted a
peaceful demonstration- for the
cause of a free economy.

Congratulations
Editor, the Daily:
Before this volume of the Daily
comes to an end, I want to con
gratulate the present editors.
Your reporting of the Hoover In
stitute problem and the recent
Un-American Activities Commit
tee hearings was in the 1 highest
tradition of responsible journal
ism objective, thorough, intelli
gent.
In my ten years at Stanford I
have never real a volume of the
Daily with more pleasure and
profit, and many of my colleagues
have expressed a similar opinion.
By addressing your audience in
this mature way, you have, I sus
pect, done a good deal to create
a demand in that audience for
similar treatment in the future.
I wish good luck to the new
editors and hope that they profit
by the precedents you have estab
lished.

Appreciation
Editor, the Daily:
,1 am writing to express my
appreciation for the. fine job you
have do n e dur in g Ihe past
months. I think the paper has
struck an excellent balance be
tween concern with off-campus
issues and local matters.
In the former connection many
of your editorial positions have
seemed to me good ones, and I
wish to especially commend your
treatment of the recent Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee hear
ings.
On the other hand, you have
shown that local news need not
be confined to social and sports
events; the reporting of the con
troversy over the purposes of the
Hoover Institute was, in my opin
ion, a real service to the Univer
sity.
Thanks again, and best wishes.

Foreign Scholars
Editor, tlie Daily:
Our year as A.S.S.U. Foreign
Scholars will soon be over and
we will scatter to our home coun
tries or to other parts of the
United States. Before we do so,
we want to claim a little of your
space in which to express our
t hanks.
To spend a year in a leading
American university, with a dis
tinguished faculty, exacting stand
ards and lively students is an
experience which any young per
son from another country should
value highly.
Our thanks are due primarily
to the students of Stanford whose
Legislature maintains the pro
gram which brought us here. It
is quite common for university
administrations to give scholar
ships to students from other coun
tries but much less common for
student bodies 1o do so. We salute
the L.A.S.S.U. for providing 11
scholarships each year.
The members of the Foreign
Scholarship Commission were our
guides and shepherds during the
year. Our debt to them is very
great. We tried their patience
often but they never failed to
smile and be at our service. In
particular, we wish to thank the
Co-Chairmen, Dan Young and
Yvonne Olson, on whom the main
responsibility for our program
rested.
During the year, we were the
guests of the students in many
fraternities and residences. We
learned how friendly, generous
and considerate American stu
dents could be. We want them
to know how much we appreci
ated the chance to share in their
group living.
To President and Mrs. Sterling,
who received us in their home;
to Dr. Warmbrunn. the staff of
the I. Center and ihe Community
Committee; to the members of
the faculty, administration and
student body who showed us
American ways and discussed
them with us; to the staff of the
A.S.S.U. office - our grateful
thanks. We have gained a great
deal. We hope that we have given
something in return by our par

ticipation in thd life of the uni
versity.
