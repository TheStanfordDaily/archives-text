# Cunliffe Picked Top Athlete
## Daily Sports 
### Bob Payne 
Ernie Cunliffe, Stanford's "relentless runaway from Claremont,"
is The Stanford Daily's 1959-60 Athlete of the Year.
Already Cunliffe has niched for himself an honored spot in the
Stanford athletic Hall of Fame, and yet most will agree, this senior's

greatest triumphs are yet to come
Ernie has commanded the head
lines almost every week since
early March; his brilliant week
after-week running performances
have stamped him as one of
America's brightest Olympic pros
pects in the middle distances; all
the experts have said it. . . . The
Sky is the Limit for this kid.
Making the United States Olym
pic team will be no small task,
but Ernie was good enough last
year to make the Pan-American
Games when he was far short of
the runne'r he is today.
Now, nothing short of a world
record or a four-minute mile is a
bad day for Cunliffe.
Ernie was the Pacific Coast
Conference's last SBO-yard cham
pion by a hair in 1:49.2 and a
dying finish. A determined aut
umn of tough cross-country work
eliminated this dying finish for
the blistering pace-setter and the
results were seen this year before
the season even started.
A (ireat >1 si* 1
March 5, Ernie rocketed into
national headlines when he ran a
mile in 4:04.4 in an intrasquad
meet. Sports Illustrated noted
that 25 years ago that this would
have been a world record, and not
only was this done now in a
warm-up meet, but was done by
an 880 man getting in shape for
his specialty. Two weeks later Er
nie blistered a 2:55.7 three-quarter
mile, one of the fastest ever run,
and a fantastic season was under
way.
In successive weeks, Cunliffe
followed with a 4:02.4 mile an
choring the season's fastest four
mile relay; a 1:47.3 half mile
third fastest ever run; a 4:02.3
mile; a 4:06.7 and 1:49.1 double;
a 4:00.4 mile third fastest ever
by an American and the pace by
which Dyrol Burleson set a na
tional record; a 1:47.8 half mile
on the end of a 4:12 mile double;
a 1:48.5 half mile with a cold
pool' time for Ernie; a 4:01 and
1:53 relay double; a 1:48.9 half
mile relay leg on the pitifully slow
Los Angeles Coliseum grass track.
Now it's the NCAA, the Olym
pic Trials, and possibly Rome.
The Sky is the Limit. Ernie . . .
best of luck.
Burford Close Second
Truly, it would take an athlete
such as one of the world's great
est middle distance runners to
keep Chris Burford from Athlete
of the Year honors. Last year.
Chris was also a close second to
basketball great Paul Neumann.
To take a place among Stan
ford's all-time football ends is
quite an order. Chris Burford can
fill it. In two seasons as a Stan
ford regular, Chris caught 106
passes. Sixty-one of those tying
an NCAA record- were last year.
And the last 12 of those came in
the Big Game, one of the greatest
exhibitions of passing and receiv
ing (Dick Norman throwing) in
the history of football.
Burford is a pass receiver Su

preme. Faking, leaping and grab
bing, he pulled in many a toss thai
a lesser end would not even have
given a try.
In the big ones he was great.
Big Game attests to that. In the
titanic struggle with USC at the
Coliseum, he scored two limes,
once on a full-tilt grab that doubt
less has two Trojan defenders still
wondering how he got it. After
his Stanford career was over,
Chris electrified the nation when
he made a leaping, falling, over
the-head touchdown catch of a
Don Meredith pass that tied up
one of the most thrilling ever
East-West Shrine Games.
Near the Too
Good receiver, Burford? Yes,
but he was also team captain,
great defensive end. 60-minute.bal
player. He commands a place
among Stanford's greatest all
time ends; a place VERY NEAR
I he top.
Certainly the greatest all
around swimmer in the world
would lie a strong candidate for
Athlete of the Year at any school.
According to the experts, that
swimmer is at Stanford. He is
junior George Harrison, the
Sports Illustrated-tabbed "blond,
inverted pyramid," and Stanford's
top swimmer of the year.
As a high school student,
George was on the 1956 U.S.
Olympic team; he starred in the
Pan-Am Games last summer; for
1960, he seems a virtual cinch to
represent the U.S. in Rome.
At AAU championships in New
Haven, Conn., in April, Harrison
strayed from his distance free
style specialties to enter a non-
Olympic event, the 400-yard indi
vidual medley, "just to see what
he could do."
Greatest Ail-Around
Ile s how e d th e m . I larrison
stroked th r o ugh the medley
( backstroke, butt e r 112 1 y, breast
stroke, freestyle) in a record
smashing 4:28.6, and was so flaw
lessly impressive all the way that
Yale's emeritus coach, Bob Kip
hut h, said afterward, "Technical
ly, the greatest all-around swim
mer in Ihe world."
Scoring in the 220. 440 and 1500
meters in the NCAA meet, he
paced Stanford to a fifth place
finish, ahead of such powers as
Yale and Ohio State. But George
was far from Stanford's only top
swimmer. Also rating mention is
senior Tom Petersen (a slightly
taller blond, inverted pyramid)
who set an American and collegi
ate record in the 100-yard breast
stroke in 1:03.1.
Stanford basketball was expect
ed to experience a "down" year
last -season, and truly things look
ed gloomy without Paul Neumann

and Dick Haga around. The team
never got sensational; but it never
would have reached Hie peak it
did without the terrific help of a
guy who was supposed to ride the
bench for his third straight year.
Neal Brockmeyer, 6-8 senior
who had been a lifeless, unimpres
sive reserve for two seasons,
turned Tiger in January. Battling
Cal's Great Darrall Imhoff to a
standstill for one half in the first
Card-Cal clash, Brockmeyer quick
ly fought his way into the start
ing lineup. His rebounding
through the stretch was among
the league's best, and his clutch
scoring kept the Tribe in many
games. The peak was in mid-
February. Out-rebounding USC's
musclemen all the way, Brock
meyer threw home 22 points and
for his work received the most
astounding standing ovation

heard in the Pavilion all year.
Stanford's tennis team met this
year, among others, Lamar Tech,
UCLA and USC. That's about
The Tops in collegiate tennis.
Ogden Teamed
Against Lamar, Dick Ogden
teamed with Jim Jeffries to score
a doubles victory one of two
Card points; against UCLA, Dick
Ogden whipped nationally ranked
Larry Nagl c r , No. 1 Bruin;
against USC. Dick Ogden came
back from an 8-10 first set loss
to rout the Trojan ace, Greg
Grant, and pace a startling Stan
ford upset.
Junior Dick Ogden is The
Daily's tennis star of the year.
Quick as a cat and amazingly ac
curate. Ogden has extended the
very best to play their best game
in order to beat him; as the rec
ord shows, they haven't always
succeeded.
The walls of the Sunken Dia
mond have been reached only, 53
times in history by collegians'
home runs. In the last at-bat he
will ever have there as a Stanford
collegian, Jim Burk slammed a
three-run drive far over the left
field wall. It won a game for the
Indians, and (fittingly wound up a
three-year career as one of the
CIBA's toughest batsmen.
Third baseman Jim Burk gar
ners baseball honors this year
after terrorizing hurlers all sea
son with terrific shots. He led the

Tribe in home runs, runs-bat ted-in
and getting on base, and ranked
third among the hitters.
C'hoate in Golf
Playing on their homo course,
Stanford golfers asserted them
s e Iv e s m os t emphatically last
weekend by gobbling up the AA
\VU championship by a whopping
II strokes. The well-balanced
Cards had a different star nearly
every week through the season
but in the big tournament, it was
sophomore Pete Choate all the
way, capturing the AAWU indi
vidual crown with a 72-hole 293.
In the "small" sports. Stanford
found another great performer.
With tHe Indian team proving it
self the class of the minor-scale
collegiate boxing world, a sopho
more of just a few months experi
ence blossomed into one of the
nation's leading belters.
liothmun Makes It
fcddie Rothman, a punishing
body-puncher who demolished
about everything in his path dur
ing the regular season, fought his
way to the finals of the NCAA
tournament at Madison, Wis. the
first time a Card boxer lias made
it that far. He was decisioned in
the final by San Joses' two-time
champ. Archie Milton, but Stan
ford had found itself on the na
tional boxing map.
. The list of Indian athletes wor
thy of mention is a long one. Stars
in their respective sports were
Bernie Knaggs. soccer; Dick Den
ny. wrestling; Keith Wallace,
cross-country; Doug Cox. gymnas
tics; Kyrk Reid. Rugby, and Ward
DeWitt, crew.
