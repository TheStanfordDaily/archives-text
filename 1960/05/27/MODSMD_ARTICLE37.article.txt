# Card Riflemen 8th in Country
## 
### 
Stanford's rifle team finished
a strong Bth place out of four
hundred schools competing in the
National Collegiate Rifle team
championships. The shooters com
peted at the Berkeley range in
the Western division last month
and scores have been just com
piled and released of all division
shooting.
Gene Daniels made the All
American second team this year
the first Stanford marksman to
ever receive this honor. He ranked
thirteenth in the Nation.
This was the first time in
twelve years that the Tribe
marksmen have finished ahead of
their arch-rivals across the Bay
the California Bears.
