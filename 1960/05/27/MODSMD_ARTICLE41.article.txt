# Tribe Spikers Go North For AAWU Track Finale
## 
### Dick Barnes 
While the eyes of the track
world focus on Modesto's Cali
fornia Relays Saturday, a small
band of West Coast spike stal
warts have journeyed to the
Northwest for the AAWU cham
pionships.
Stanford, USC, UCLA, Califor
nia and Washington all are pass
ing up the Modesto spikefest to
hold their own little meet In
what is theoretically a successor
to the Pacific Coast Conference
title meet in Seattle.
Eight Indians went north with
Coach Payton Jordan for today's
trials and finals tomorrow. Three
of the eight Ernie Cunliffe, Rich
Klier and Dick Lassen will go
in the 880.
Cunliffe, perhaps a bit tired and
definitely a second or two slower
the past couple of weeks, will
face a stern test from California's
Jerry Siebert.
If form holds, Siebert should
win. In each of the past two years
the winner between Cunliffe and
Siebert in Big Meet has been de
feated by the other at the con
ference title meet. And Cunliffe
won Big Meet this year.
Cunliffe is the world's best at
the distance this year 1:47.3
and Siebert is the only other
American to as yet be under the*
Olympic qualifying time.
Klier and Lassen could both be
in the scoring column in what
is definitely Stanford's strongest
event.
Stanford's other entries are Art
Batchelder (javelinei, Don Bell
(discus), Jerry Winters (shot),
John Kelly (broad jump and hop
step-jump), and Bob Besse (440).
Norm Lloyd and Dean Smilh will

not make the trip due to an in
jury and personal reasons respec
tively.
USC is a cinch to capture the
loop's first meet. Troy boasts the
top man in every field event, and
should continue to pick up plenty
of firsts while the would-be con
tenders kill each other off.
Five other Indians, four of them
frosh, will compete at Modesto.
Varsity runner Rich Parker goes
in the 880 off his recent relay
showings. The Papoose entries
are John Haynie (high jump),
Dave Weill (discus), Sheridan
Downey (hop-skip-jump) and Ken
Emanuels (440 or 2201.
The same Stanford contingent
that goes to Seattle, with the ex
ctption of Besse, will compete in
ihe NCAA meet June 17-18 at
Berkeley. Lloyd is also expected
to be back for that one.
Next Saturday, Stanford will
host the State High School cham
pionships, and July 1-2 will be
the site of the men's final Olym
pic trials.
