Work came to ail abrupt halt at the Daily Shack yesterday as
Stanford's five new pompon girls came by to have their pictures
taken. Wishing to prolong the interlude, our photographer re
sourcefully suggested that the pictures be taken out of doors.
Traffic slowed considerably 011 Loniita Drive as the yirls perched
atop various ears. In the top row we have Lana Caffey, Katliy Pajje
and Pat Murman. Below them sit Wendy Anderson and Suzanne
Horney.
