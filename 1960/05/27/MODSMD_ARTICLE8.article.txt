## School Construction Bill Granted House Approval 
### 
. WASHINGTON (/P> The

$1,300,000,000 school construclion
bill containing an anti-segregation
provision.
The roll call vote was 206-189.
The - segregation amend
ment, put into the bill by a 218-
181 vote, could endanger the
chances of Senate agreement to
the measure.
Under the a m endment, no
money could go to schools that
refuse to obey court integration
orders.
Southern senators are unlikely
to accept this provision. Their
support would be needed in the
usual House-Senate conference
proceedings in such situations.
House approval of the bill came
after an eight-hour session in
which the legislation at one time
seemed doomed.
The Senate has passed a $1,-
800,000,000 bill which contains a
controversial provision — not in
the House measure authorizing
the states to use the money for
teachers' salaries as well as for
school construction. .

bill authorizes $323 million a year
for four years.

ing an administration demand]
that the states match all federal
money received.
The final vote marked the first '
time the House has approved a
bill providing federal aid for
school construction.
