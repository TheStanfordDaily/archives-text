# Don't Sit There, Do Something
## 
### 
Summertime is the perfect time to enjoy yourselves swimming,
playing tennis, dancing, golfing, and horseback riding; and facilities
for all of these sports are available at Stanford.
If it's a cool day and you feel full of energy, the tennis courts will
change that state of affairs after a set or two. The courts are located

behind the women's gym and be
•side the pavilion. Tennis shoes
must be worn at all times; tennis
classes have court priority.
Or if you feel like a little
calmer type of outdoor action, try
using the Stanford golf course fa
cilities. The golf course is open
for Stanford people Monday
through Friday 7:30 a.m. to 6:30
p.m. and the golf club fountain is
open 8 to 5 except Monday.
Those students, faculty or .staff
members really interested in play
ing golf can obtain scrip cards for
10 plays or may pay for the use
of the green by day. After the
women's collegiate tournament
this week, a clinic will be con
ducted for those who want to
learn from woman professional
golfer Betty Hicks.
Volleyball is also available daily
at the men's gym for men. On
weekends women students and
their guests may use the women's
volleyball court; women may use
their own field daily.
Throughout the summer ASSU
is sponsoring tournaments in ten
nis, golf and volleyball. And if
your exercise is more the mental
than the physical kind, why not
enter the bridge game rounds
also set up by ASSU?
Out by Lagunita residence is a
Red Barn which houses horses.
Here special lessons and classes
are conducted for children and
adults in all phases of equitation.
Arrangements for conducted trail
rides may be made. Call DA 2-
5713 for arrangements and spe
cific information.
