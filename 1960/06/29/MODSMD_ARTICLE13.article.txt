# Wanted: Tired, Hot, Thirsty Customers

After the heat of the afternoon, what could be more thirst appeal
ing than sipping a cool lemon frappe, continental style or an "Izzy
VVahoo," designed to "delight the most jaded palate."
All this and more awaits those who have yet to make their first visit
to the I Center's Sidewalk Cafe. Under a starry sky, in an atmosphere

of cosmopolitan France, with quiet
jazz background—or live enter
tainment if anyone is interested—
the checkered cloths and lovely
waitresses all contribute to a
unique experience.
Lighting the evening hours from
8:30 to 10:30 p.m. Sunday through
Thursday, the flickering candles
provide a romantic note to an al
ready picturesque setting.
Summer student manager
Charles Landis has reported that
espresso has also been known to
keep many going on the midnight
oil come midterm and final time.
He has also said that anyone in
terested in helping will be most
welcome. It is really a valuable
experience to get to know many
people, and girls are needed espe
cially to contribute a few hours
each as waitresses. Landis may
be reached during the day by call
ing the I Center are better yet, in
the evenings at the Cafe.
