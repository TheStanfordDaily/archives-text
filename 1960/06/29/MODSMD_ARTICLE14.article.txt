# Old Chappies To Sell Today
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: Here, for your
perusal, is a letter, printed exactly
as handed to us, to publicize prod
ucts which did not sell the first
time. We won't mention the ob
vious conclusion; we'll let the let
ter speak for itself.)
"The CHAPARRAL wishes to
announce that on Wednesday (the
29th?) it will put a limited num
ber of 1959-60 Chaparrals up for
sale on its stands. Actually, we'll
have one stand at engineering cor
ner (though I doubt most students
will be familiar with that geo
graphical term).
The issues we'll have will be:
Jan. (the city with a parody insert
on Herb Caen's "Guide to San
Francisco"), Feb. (hate cops, in
which the Old Boy swings his
famed hammer at the campus'
most nagging problem—the Stan
ford Police), Mar. (Mass Media,
with a cover that demonstrates the
importance of The Daily to Stan
ford life) and May (the renouned
(sic) Crash Comics, Chappie's end
of the year unleashing of the dirt

ier things on the minds of our
humor men. If you would like
copies, I'll stop by here (Daily of
fice) Sat. sometime with them
(Imagine, trying to bribe the edi
tor!) Leave me a note on the bul
liten (sic) board.
For the summer students who
aren't familiar with the Chappie
you might point out that the Chap
arral is always voted among the
top five college humor magazines
in the nation by all editors of such
publications. We are unable to of
fer the Pile, our parody on Post
which sold out faster than our
salesgirls could make change.
The stand will be at engineering
corner from morning till after
noon (8-1). This is the first time
in several years that we have
thought the summer students suf
ficiently sophisticated andintelli
gent (sic) to offer them our
prescious (sic) publication." (And
we tactfully omit the name of the
author after THAT comment.

"The CHAPARRAL wishes to
announce that on Wednesday (the
29th?) it will put a limited num
ber of 1959-60 Chaparrals up for
sale on its stands. Actually, we'll
have one stand at engineering cor
ner (though I doubt most students
will be familiar with that geo
graphical term).
The issues we'll have will be:
Jan. (the city with a parody insert
on Herb Caen's "Guide to San
Francisco"), Feb. (hate cops, in
which the Old Boy swings his
famed hammer at the campus'
most nagging problem—the Stan
ford Police), Mar. (Mass Media,
with a cover that demonstrates the
importance of The Daily to Stan
ford life) and May (the renouned
(sic) Crash Comics, Chappie's end
of the year unleashing of the dirt

ier things on the minds of our
humor men. If you would like
copies, I'll stop by here (Daily of
fice) Sat. sometime with them
(Imagine, trying to bribe the edi
tor!) Leave me a note on the bul
liten (sic) board.
For the summer students who
aren't familiar with the Chappie
you might point out that the Chap
arral is always voted among the
top five college humor magazines
in the nation by all editors of such
publications. We are unable to of
fer the Pile, our parody on Post
which sold out faster than our
salesgirls could make change.
The stand will be at engineering
corner from morning till after
noon (8-1). This is the first time
in several years that we have
thought the summer students suf
ficiently sophisticated andintelli
gent (sic) to offer them our
prescious (sic) publication." (And
we tactfully omit the name of the
author after THAT comment.
