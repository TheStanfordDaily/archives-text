the Stanford Summer Choir,
which will sing for the Sunday

sing some of the finest choral lit
erture, drawn from Bach cantatas,
Mozart song masses, Renaissance
motets of Byrd, Lassus, and many
others. Miss Hiatt is the musical
director and conductor of the
Sfnith College Chamber Singers.
Those interested should come to

are held Tuesdays, 5-6 p.m., Wed
nesdays, 7-9 p.m., and Sunday
mornings at 9:45 before the church
service.
