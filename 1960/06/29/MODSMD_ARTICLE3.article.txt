## 
### Frances Fisher 
SIPSIM, Stanford's program for helping un
derdeveloped countries, began classes Monday.
This program, more formally known as the Stan
ford International Program in Small Industry
Management, is designed to help alleviate scar
city of management skills and facilities and to
help develop these skills.
Twenty-five businessmen from Africa, South
America and Asia are living at Hurlburt House
while participating in the beginning three
months of the six month program. These men,
who are all well experienced in business in their
respective countries, will be learning American
management skills during the first part of the
course through both clarses and on the job ex
perience in local firms.
The second part of the course will concern
helping the growth of industry in their own coun
tries through private and governmental develop
ment.
Students Welcome
Students who would like to talk with these fas
cinating and delightful men are invited to call
Dave Korten (DA 6-0937), director of Ilurlburt
House, for arrangements for dining with the
group.
All the participants, whose ages range from 27
to 55, write and speak English fluently, though
they come from the far -off countries of Chile,

Colombia. Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South
ern Rhodesia, Formosa, Tanganyika, and Thai
land.
The classes these men are attending are di
rected by Stanford professors and are built
around the case study method with much discus
sion, thus making use of the wide and varied
experience of the participants.
Trainers of Trainers
Financial aid for the members is being sup
plied by the International Cooperation Adminis
tration, the Asia Foundation, foreign govern
ments and private organizations. These agencies
and Stanford firmly believe that by training
these men who will train others in their own
countries by giving lectures, seminars and by
opening their plants to future management
trainees, SIPSIM can help the economic develop
ment of underdeveloped countries.
Stanford's Own

in the U.S., was instituted last summer by the
Stanford Business School and the Stanford Re
search Center as a pioneer in management train
ing.
Co-directors of SIPSIM are Profesor Frank K.
Shallenberger of the Business School and Dr.
