# Final U.S. Olympic Trials In Field, Track At Stanford
## 
### Dick Barnes 
The United States' 221 finest track and field men compete in the world's second-greatest spike
classic Friday and Saturday in Stanford Stadium, intent on gaining berths in the greatest of all meets,
the Olympic Games.
The final Olympic trials, a gruelling test to select this country's three best competitors in each of 17
events for the Rome Olympiad, returns here for the first time since 1932.

A two-day crowd total of 75,000
is predicted. Friday's meet, a twi
light affair beginning at 5:30, will
see team members selected in the
100, 5,000, 400 meet hurdles, high
jump, shot put, javelin, and broad
jump. Hammer throwers will be
chosen Friday beginning at 2:30
in competition on Angell Field.
Starting Saturday at 1 p.m., fi
nals will be held in the remaining
nine events —200, 400, 800 and 1,500
meter runs, 3,000 meter steeple
chase, 110 high hurdles, discus,
hop-step-jump and pole vault.
Though virtually all reserved
seats have been gone for two
weeks, thousands of general ad
mission tickets will be on sale
right up to meet time. Prices are
$2.50 for both days or $1.50 for
each day.
The final group of qualifiers
into the meet was chosen after last
weekend's National AAU cham
pionships in Bakersfield. Others
had already gained entry to the
meet by virtue of placings in the
NCAA championships and Armed
Services meet. With all names in,
speculation has immediately cen
tered about the fact that the meet
should present the finest compe
tition and marks ever seen in this
country.
The rundown by events:
SPRINTS — Ray Norton, for
merly of San Jose State, and
Charley Tidwell of Kansas posted
double wins in the AAU and NCAA
meets respectively, and are strong
favorites to pick off two of the
three spots in each race. Senti
ment rides with world record hold
ers Dave Sime and Bobby Morrow,
each past his peak but still with
plenty left. Morrow was given up
for through when he failed in his
100 heat at Bakersfield. But he
showed lots of zip in running to a
fourth in the 200. Paul Winder of
Morgan State, possessor of the
best start in the field, is also a
strong threat.
400—Two refugees from other
sports highlight the field here. Ted
Woods went to Colorado on a foot
ball scholarship, but wound up
running 45.7 in the NCAA meet;
Otis Davis moved over from base
ball a couple of years ago at Ore
gon, and wound up winning the
AAU title last week in 45.8. Al

most anyone else in the field could
take the third spot.
800—Stanford hopes ride with
Ernie Cunliffe, third-fastest half
miler of all time and pace-setter
supreme. As usual, he's expected
to be the rabbit for the field and
then try to unleash enough kick to
hold off the speed boys. Tom Mur
phy of New York, Jerry Siebert of
Cal, and Jim Cerveny of Occiden
tal—surprise winner at Bakers
field—should offer the stiffest
battles.
1500—Two Oregonians, Dyrol
Burleson and Jim Grelle, are
heavy favorites here. Who'll take

the third spot will seemingly de
pend on whether the race is tacti
cal or blistering.
5000 —Max Truex, Jim Beatty
and Bill Dellinger heavily favored
here.
110 Hurdles—Hayes Jones and
'56 Olympic champ Lee Calhoun
should take two spots, with ex-
Stanford ace Chuck Cobb, Willie
May and perhaps James Johnson
of UCLA in contention for third.
400 Hurdles—'s6 winner Glenn
Davis has looked very strong in
his last two races. But the field
is well-balanced with Dick How
