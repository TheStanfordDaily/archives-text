# 3 World Records Set; Cunliffe Makes Team
## 
### 
The tension was off. The 28
who made the U.S. Olympic Team
had room only for joy in their
hearts—including Stanford's Er
nie Cunliffe.
On July 25th they meet in Eu
gene, Ore., to begin training for
the Olympics to be held in Rome.
Cunliffe sweated for two hours
while four officials examined fin
ish-line films and finally decided
he had beaten James Dupree of
New Mexico by an inch and one
half to win third place in the 800
meters and a ticket to Rome.
Cunliffe led to the last 100 me
ters when Tom Murphy of New
York AC and Jerry Siebert of
California passed him.
"I gave up too soon," Cunliffe
said. "After Murphy and Siebert
went by me, I thought the herd
would be on their tail. I kept
waiting and waiting. When they
didn't charge past I took new

heart. I picked up again. I
thought I had Dupree by an inch."
Three new world records were
set in the meet. Friday saw John
Thomas of Tennessee A.&I. make
an "impossible" 7 foot 3% inch
high jump, exceeding everything
ever done before, outdoors or in
doors.
Ray Norton, of Santa Clara
Youth Village, two-turned a siz
zling time of 20.5 in the 200 meter
finals, stealing the 20.6 record
which has stood for nine years.
Stone Johnson of Grambling, sec
ond in the final, ran in 20.5 in
the first preliminary heat.
The last world record set Sat
urday was Don Bragg's 15 foot
9% inch pole vault. He hit the
sawdust, scooped up two hand
l'uls, then ran laughing, hollering,
and jumping back down the run
way.
His fiancee, Terry F i or e ,

charged out of the stands and ran
to the Army hero, who picked her
up on the run, and carried her
over his shoulder.
