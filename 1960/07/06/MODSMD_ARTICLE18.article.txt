## 
### WARD McAFEE 
The Stanford Players' produc
tion of William Saroyan's "The
Beautiful People" last Friday
night presented acting which,
while not as convincing as it could
have he-en, nevertheless richly de
livered the mood and philosophy
of the play.
"The Beautiful People" por
trays glimpses into the life of a
frmily that lives simply and beau
tifully, with a reverence for life.
Edmund Roney, starring as the
father of the family, delivers a
performance that is in itself beau
tiful. Mr. Roney, upon his en
trance into the play, picks up the
theme, which is not until then ade
quately defined by the other ac
tors, and gives it to the audience.
Elizabeth Forest, who portrays
a little old lady, does a good job
defining the character of the boy.
Philip Clarkson, who as a busi
ness executive, represents the out
side world's reaction to the Bohe
mian family's way of life, also
does very well. Doyne Mraz, as a
Catholic priest, is also convincing
in his role.
Luke Vania, who portrays the
fredom-loving fiften-year-old son,
is given a major role. Mr. Vania
improved as the play progressed,
and by the end of the perform
ance he too was successful.
Louise Carter, as the daughter
in the family, also in a starring
role, had the difficult task of
playing a young girl who, through
pity for a young man. is discover
ing the feeling of humanity for
all things. Her role often slipped
into melodrama and lost its poig
nancy.
Paul Hennig does a fair job in
portraying a man fearful of the
naked brutality in the world.
By the end of "The Beautiful
People" the audience is convinced.
The mood of joy and intense love
for all living things, whether mice
or men, reaches the viewer. Saro
yan's religion is clearly defined
by a wonderful performance. One
should not miss this beautiful
play—"The Beautiful People."
Additional performances to be
held in the Little Theater are
scheduled tomorrow, Friday, and
Saturday nights, and Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday nights next
week (July 14-16). Tickets are on
sale at the Memorial Hall box
office.

night presented acting which,
while not as convincing as it could
have he-en, nevertheless richly de
livered the mood and philosophy
of the play.
"The Beautiful People" por
trays glimpses into the life of a
frmily that lives simply and beau
tifully, with a reverence for life.
Edmund Roney, starring as the
father of the family, delivers a
performance that is in itself beau
tiful. Mr. Roney, upon his en
trance into the play, picks up the
theme, which is not until then ade
quately defined by the other ac
tors, and gives it to the audience.
Elizabeth Forest, who portrays
a little old lady, does a good job
defining the character of the boy.
Philip Clarkson, who as a busi
ness executive, represents the out
side world's reaction to the Bohe
mian family's way of life, also
does very well. Doyne Mraz, as a
Catholic priest, is also convincing
in his role.
Luke Vania, who portrays the
fredom-loving fiften-year-old son,
is given a major role. Mr. Vania
improved as the play progressed,
and by the end of the perform
ance he too was successful.
Louise Carter, as the daughter
in the family, also in a starring
role, had the difficult task of
playing a young girl who, through
pity for a young man. is discover
ing the feeling of humanity for
all things. Her role often slipped
into melodrama and lost its poig
nancy.
Paul Hennig does a fair job in
portraying a man fearful of the
naked brutality in the world.
By the end of "The Beautiful
People" the audience is convinced.
The mood of joy and intense love
for all living things, whether mice
or men, reaches the viewer. Saro
yan's religion is clearly defined
by a wonderful performance. One
should not miss this beautiful
play—"The Beautiful People."
Additional performances to be
held in the Little Theater are
scheduled tomorrow, Friday, and
Saturday nights, and Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday nights next
week (July 14-16). Tickets are on
