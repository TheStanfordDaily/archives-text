The first of four outstanding musical events scheduled for July at
Stanford will be a folk song festival presented by the Committee on
Public Exercises, Monday in Memorial Hall.
Featured artists will be Peggy Seeger, daughter of American Folk
Musicologists Ruth Charles and Crawford Seegar and half-sister of

Pete Seeger; and Ewan Mac Coil
of Scotland whose parents passe.i
down to him their great reper
torie of folk song ballads, and
their simple way of presenting
songs without accompaniment.
Miss Seeger spent tv/o years a
Radcliff and toured Europe ex
tensively where she first met Mac-
Coll. She accompanied his singing
there before returning to this
country. Mac Coil, in addition to
his singing, has authored several
books on folk music, has broad
casted musical programs for BBC
and has edited three folk music
anthologies.
Accompanying the pair will be
the New Lost City Ramblers, a
string group who play and sing
as if they were straight out of
the 1920'5. Instruments include
guitar, five-string banjo, mando
lin, and an autoharp. This group
has made several recordings and
is currently on its first West
Coast tour.
On July 14, the Department of
Music will present the California
Woodwind Quintet, on June 17
and 24, the Stanford Summer
Youth Symphony under Profes
sor Wolfgang Kuhn, and on July
29, Theodor Uppman, baritone, in
