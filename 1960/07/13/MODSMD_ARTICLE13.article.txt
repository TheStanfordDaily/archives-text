# STANFORD EMERITUS
## Professor Returns Home From Indonesian Project 
### 
After six years of working on an education-medical project in
Indonesia, Dr. Edwin W. Schultz has returned to his Stanford home.
Schultz was director of the project between the University of
California and the University of Indonesia School of Medicine in
Djakarta, Indonesia. He and 31 Americans, all highly trained sci-

entists and technicians in the
medical field, worked with the
permanent staff at the University,
teaching courses, advising on cur
riculum, course content, books,
equipment, and even the design of
new buildings.
And now Indonesians may rea
sonably fee) that adequate medical
care is close at hand. Before this
project, sponsored by the Interna
tional Cooperation Administra
tion, Indonesia had about one phy
sician for 66,000 people, compared
to America's one for each 750
people.
Successful Project
Now graduating classes average
about 150 well-trained doctors to
be added each year to Indonesia's
original 1200 physicians. The pro
ject has been successful in accom
plishing its purpose of developing
a strong school of medicine by
training teachers and physicians.
Another part of the program
allowed for 125 Indonesian faculty
members and assistants in instruc
tion to study and train in the
medical field in the United States
or other countries. Returning to
Indonesia as more fully qualified
teachers, specialists and scientists,
they are reinforcing the Indone
sian medical staffs.

In his lab at Indonesian School
After six years of working on an education-medical project in
Indonesia, Dr. Edwin W. Schultz has returned to his Stanford home.
Schultz was director of the project between the University of
California and the University of Indonesia School of Medicine in
Djakarta, Indonesia. He and 31 Americans, all highly trained sci-

entists and technicians in the
medical field, worked with the
permanent staff at the University,
teaching courses, advising on cur
riculum, course content, books,
equipment, and even the design of
new buildings.
And now Indonesians may rea
sonably fee) that adequate medical
care is close at hand. Before this
project, sponsored by the Interna
tional Cooperation Administra
tion, Indonesia had about one phy
sician for 66,000 people, compared
to America's one for each 750
people.
Successful Project
Now graduating classes average
about 150 well-trained doctors to
be added each year to Indonesia's
original 1200 physicians. The pro
ject has been successful in accom
plishing its purpose of developing
a strong school of medicine by
training teachers and physicians.
Another part of the program
allowed for 125 Indonesian faculty
members and assistants in instruc
tion to study and train in the
medical field in the United States
or other countries. Returning to
Indonesia as more fully qualified
teachers, specialists and scientists,
they are reinforcing the Indone
sian medical staffs.
