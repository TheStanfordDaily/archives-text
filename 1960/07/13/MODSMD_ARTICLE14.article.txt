# Beautiful People' Finishes Successful Run Saturday
## 
### 
The Stanford Players will give
their last performances of Wil
liam Saroyan's fantasy "The
Beautiful People" at 8:30 p.m. to
morrow, Friday, and Saturday in
the Little Theatre.
The play is the whimsical story
of an eccentric family who try to
live a carefree life in a dilapidated
San Francisco house.
Designer Richard Hay's un
usual sets show a modernistic ap
proach to Bohemian living and
succeed in getting across the
mood of freedom which is essen-

tial to the play. Particularly effec
tive is the pale filmy curtain with
seemingly luminescent figures of
small furry animals. The set it
self, with lack of ponderous high
walls, ceilings and imprisoning
doors and windows, greatly sup
ports the feeling of free breathing.
Those who have so well por
trayed the family are Edmund
Roney, the father; Luke Vania,
the son; and Louise Carter, the
daughter. The supporting roles
are amply filled by Philip Clark
son, Elizabeth Forest, Paul Hen
nig, Doyne Marz, and Marshall
Fisher.
James Kerans directs the group
in this play. Assisting him have
been Paul Landry, technical direc
tor, and Jan Pratt, in charge of
co-stumes.
Tickets are on sale for $1.25 and
$1.75 at Memorial Hall box office
and Peninsula box office.
