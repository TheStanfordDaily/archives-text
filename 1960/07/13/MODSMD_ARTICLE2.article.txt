# Dance Planned For July 30
## 
### 
Mark this one down on your
calendar â€” all campus dinner
dance Saturday, July 30, at the
famed Cliff House, San Francisco.
ASSU has made arrangements
for a room overlooking the ocean,
a complete dinner at 7 and danc
ing from 9-1. Cocktails will be
served. Other details will be
known later, says Dick Sayles,
chairman.
This one dance will take the
place of the Lagunita Semi-formal
and the Men's All-Campus dances
planned for this quarter. Because
of this, ASSU is taking extra
pains to make the July 30 dance an
all-inclusive good time before fi
nals.
