# Physicist Develops Nitrocellulose Film
## 
### 
A Stanford physicist, Dr. Saara
Asunmaa, lias developed a new

type of X-ray film that will enable
medical researchers to probe
deeper than ever before into rta
ture's secrets.
The Finnish-born biophysics re
search associate developed the
film in an effort to solve a prob
lem that has bothered researchers
for years.
The problem: How to combine
the X-ray microscope's depth per
ception with the electron micro
scope's high magnification.
The obvious solution, Dr. Asun
maa thought, would be to take
an X-ray photograph and enlarge
it with an electron microscope.
Ordinary light microscopes, like
X-ray microscopes, will resolve
objects down to about 2,000 ang
stroms. The X-ray microscope has
the advantage of seeing through
an object, thereby giving depth to
the picture.
This solution had been thought
of before, and the stumbling block
had always been the film used in
the X-ray picture. Even the finest
commercial films were too grainy,
and the electron microscope could
not resolve anything smaller than
the grains in the film.
Resolving Problem
Dr. Asunmaa prepared a practi
cally grainless film by casting
nitrocellulose, ordinarily called
guneotton, on a flat glass slide.
She mixed a special silver com
pound with the nitrocellulose to
help the X-rays register on the
film.
The grains in this new film are
on the order of one micron in size.
They may be enlarged by the elec
tron microscope up to 40,000 di
ameters without showing appreci
ably.
The new method combines the
X-ray microscope's variable pene
tration powers and depth percep
tion with the electron micro
scope's high resolving power.
Its first practical use will be to
study chromosomes with an eye

to finding out if they contain any
thing too small to show on ordi
nary light or X-ray microscopes.
The new method may also be
used to measure mass distribution
of matter, either organic, such as
cells, or inorganic. With this
method, biological specimens may
be studied without resorting to
the often damaging methods of
preparation such as vacuum
chambers, electron bombardment
or chemical stains.
Details down to 600 angstrom
units, about two-millionths of an
inch, may be resolved.
Although the development is
most promising at the moment in
the field of biological research, it
holds much promise for metal
lurgical and nuclear research.
It will be possible with this
method to see the crystal struc

ture of metals in detail and in
three dimensions rather than just
two. The film can be used for
radioactive tracer studies, where
a radioactive object is placed on
the film and dark spots show con
centrations of radiation.
Dr. Asunmaa's nitrocelluluose
film is less than 1,000 angstroms,
about 1/250,000 inch, thick. The
procedure she uses is a follows:
The film is placed in an X-ray
contact microscope with the
specimen to be examined. Follow
ing X-ray exposure, the film is
treated with a solution of alcohol
and sodium cyanide. This dis
solves the radiochemical com
pounds which have been formed,
leaving the image of the specimen
to be examined in a varied pattern
of film densities that can be seen
with an electron microscope. De

tails smaller than 600 angstroms
arc resolvable.
Dr. Asunmma held a fellowship
from the Technical University of
Finland for study at the Royal
Institute of Technology in Stock
holm, where she worked in the
Swedish Forest Products Re
search Laboratory.
She has worked at Stanford un
der Dr. Howard Pat tee Jr. since
10:17 after receiving a fellowship
from the American Association of
University Women to study here.
She holds the Ph.D. degree from
the University of Helinski. Her
work appears in the current issue
of Nature, a British scientific
journal.

DR. SAAHA ASUNMAA AND FRIEND
"Friend" utilizes a new type of film to permit microscope studies of minute parts in great detail
A Stanford physicist, Dr. Saara
Asunmaa, lias developed a new

type of X-ray film that will enable
medical researchers to probe
deeper than ever before into rta
ture's secrets.
The Finnish-born biophysics re
search associate developed the
film in an effort to solve a prob
lem that has bothered researchers
for years.
The problem: How to combine
the X-ray microscope's depth per
ception with the electron micro
scope's high magnification.
The obvious solution, Dr. Asun
maa thought, would be to take
an X-ray photograph and enlarge
it with an electron microscope.
Ordinary light microscopes, like
X-ray microscopes, will resolve
objects down to about 2,000 ang
stroms. The X-ray microscope has
the advantage of seeing through
an object, thereby giving depth to
the picture.
This solution had been thought
of before, and the stumbling block
had always been the film used in
the X-ray picture. Even the finest
commercial films were too grainy,
and the electron microscope could
not resolve anything smaller than
the grains in the film.
Resolving Problem
Dr. Asunmaa prepared a practi
cally grainless film by casting
nitrocellulose, ordinarily called
guneotton, on a flat glass slide.
She mixed a special silver com
pound with the nitrocellulose to
help the X-rays register on the
film.
The grains in this new film are
on the order of one micron in size.
They may be enlarged by the elec
tron microscope up to 40,000 di
ameters without showing appreci
ably.
The new method combines the
X-ray microscope's variable pene
tration powers and depth percep
tion with the electron micro
scope's high resolving power.
Its first practical use will be to
study chromosomes with an eye

to finding out if they contain any
thing too small to show on ordi
nary light or X-ray microscopes.
The new method may also be
used to measure mass distribution
of matter, either organic, such as
cells, or inorganic. With this
method, biological specimens may
be studied without resorting to
the often damaging methods of
preparation such as vacuum
chambers, electron bombardment
or chemical stains.
Details down to 600 angstrom
units, about two-millionths of an
inch, may be resolved.
Although the development is
most promising at the moment in
the field of biological research, it
holds much promise for metal
lurgical and nuclear research.
It will be possible with this
method to see the crystal struc

ture of metals in detail and in
three dimensions rather than just
two. The film can be used for
radioactive tracer studies, where
a radioactive object is placed on
the film and dark spots show con
centrations of radiation.

Dr. Asunmaa prepared a practi
cally grainless film by casting
nitrocellulose, ordinarily called
guneotton, on a flat glass slide.
She mixed a special silver com
pound with the nitrocellulose to
help the X-rays register on the
film.
The grains in this new film are
on the order of one micron in size.
They may be enlarged by the elec
tron microscope up to 40,000 di
ameters without showing appreci
ably.
The new method combines the
X-ray microscope's variable pene
tration powers and depth percep
tion with the electron micro
scope's high resolving power.
Its first practical use will be to
study chromosomes with an eye

to finding out if they contain any
thing too small to show on ordi
nary light or X-ray microscopes.
The new method may also be
used to measure mass distribution
of matter, either organic, such as
cells, or inorganic. With this
method, biological specimens may
be studied without resorting to
the often damaging methods of
preparation such as vacuum
chambers, electron bombardment
or chemical stains.
Details down to 600 angstrom
units, about two-millionths of an
inch, may be resolved.
Although the development is
most promising at the moment in
the field of biological research, it
holds much promise for metal
lurgical and nuclear research.
It will be possible with this
method to see the crystal struc

ture of metals in detail and in
three dimensions rather than just
two. The film can be used for
radioactive tracer studies, where
a radioactive object is placed on
the film and dark spots show con
centrations of radiation.
Dr. Asunmaa's nitrocelluluose
film is less than 1,000 angstroms,
about 1/250,000 inch, thick. The
procedure she uses is a follows:
The film is placed in an X-ray
contact microscope with the
specimen to be examined. Follow
ing X-ray exposure, the film is
treated with a solution of alcohol
and sodium cyanide. This dis
solves the radiochemical com
pounds which have been formed,
leaving the image of the specimen
to be examined in a varied pattern
of film densities that can be seen
with an electron microscope. De

tails smaller than 600 angstroms
arc resolvable.
Dr. Asunmma held a fellowship
from the Technical University of
Finland for study at the Royal
Institute of Technology in Stock
holm, where she worked in the
Swedish Forest Products Re
search Laboratory.
She has worked at Stanford un
der Dr. Howard Pat tee Jr. since
10:17 after receiving a fellowship
from the American Association of
University Women to study here.
She holds the Ph.D. degree from
the University of Helinski. Her
work appears in the current issue
of Nature, a British scientific
journal.
