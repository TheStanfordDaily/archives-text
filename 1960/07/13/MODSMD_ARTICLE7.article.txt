# New Light Developed-Beats Sun
## 
### 
A former Stanford student has
created an atomic radio-light
brighter than the center of the sun,
officials at Hughes Aircraft Com
pany, Los Angeles, announced last
week.
Dr. Theodore H. Maiman calls
his development a ' Laser," from
Light Amplification by Stimulated
Emission of Radiation.
The laser emits a sharp, co
herent light beam in the extreme
ly high frequencies of optics,
about 500,000 billion cycles per
second. This is the range where
electromagnetic waves become
light.
Pinpoint Beam
The beam generated may be
only a few hundredths of a degree
wide, and spreads less than one
foot for every 30,000 feet traveled.
The laser beam could be aimed at
the moon and illuminate an area
less than 10 miles wide.
The beam is coherent in the
sense that it uses atomic reson
ance to increase vastly the effi
ciency of the light - producing
energy transferral. In order to
create a beam of light as bright
as that of the laser, an ordinary
light source would have to operate
at a temperature greater than
several billion degrees Centigrade.
By contrast, the surface of the
sun is G,OOO degrees centigrade.
Ruby Heart
The laser is a solid-state elec
tronic device smaller than a water
tumbler. Its heart is a synthetic

ruby, which generates the light
beam.
In a paper submitted to the
Journal of Applied Physics, Mai
man describes the steps of opera
tion. First, a powerful light source
such as a flash tube lamp irradi
ates the synthetic ruby crystal.
The energy released is absorbed
by the ruby atoms. They move to
a higher energy state, and then l^e

radiate the energy in a narrow
hand of frequencies. These fre
quencies depend on the composi
tion of the synthetic ruby.
The excited atoms are paired
with an atomic resonator, and the
two emit radiation together, hence
the term "coherent."
This is in contrast to ordinary
light sources where the atoms

radiate individually at random,
which accounts for the incoher
ence and inefficiency of these light
sources.
Parallel Beam
The almost parallel beam and
high power of the laser make it
suitable for a number of new
tasks previously unattainable. It
may be used as a "light radar"
to direct light waves to a target,
such as one in outer space.
The laser's needle-sharp beam
provides a secure "private line"
free from static and almost un
jammable.
The high resolution resulting
from the laser's sharp beam
would enable man to take detailed
pictures of any area. Lasers can
also generate the purest colors
known.
True Amplification
The laser achieves true amplifi
cation of light for the first time,
due to the principle of resonance.
Maiman received an A.B. de
gree in engineering physics from
the University of Colorado in 1949,
a M.A. degree in electrical engi
neering from Stanford in 1951 and
a Ph.D. in physics from Stanford
in 1955.
For the past four years Maiman
has worked at Hughes as a senior
staff physicist of the atomic
physics department concentrating
his research in the fields of elec
tronics and spectroscopy.
