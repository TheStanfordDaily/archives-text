# High School Science Honor Students Probe Deeply Into Life's Mysteries
## 
### MADELYN BARKER 
Alfred Braun, assistant to the
director of the Microwave Lab at
Hansen Laboratory, heads 14 high
school graduates and two high
school seniors in the "Earn and
Learn" program now in its fifth
year of training serious physics
students.
"This is significant employment
in the student's lives which will
affect their future careers," stated
Braun.
The science enthusiasts come
from local high schools around

the San Francisco area as far
south as San Jose. They work in
the three Hansen Laboratories,
Micro-Wave, High Energy, and
Bio-Physics, all summer.
An eight-week seminar is held
for the group. Prominent mem
bers of the faculty from the Uni
versity will be guest speakers dur
ing the workshop. A basic review
of physics in electricity, magne
tism and mechanics has been com
pleted.
Research Thesis
A new addition to the summer
training is the preparing of a
2500-word thesis concerning the
scientific research each student is
doing. Braun works individually
with each member of the study
group on his report. They obtain
skill in technical writing, and have
concrete knowledge in hand at the
conclusion of their employment.
Several of the students will at
tend Stanford in the fall; others
have enrolled at San Jose State,
the University of California,
Princeton, and Harvard.
In March, Braun began his cam
paign to select the most qualified
graduating seniors for the sum

mer project. By the end of May
he had employed one-sixth of the
100 candidates that applied. Sci
ence teachers from the high
schools nominate their excep
tional senior physics student.
Dennis Taylor and Gary Stein
back are working in basic re
search concerning ferites in solid
state physics. Roger Creamer, Liz
MacCauley and Margaret Mana
ger's project concerns cesium
plasma. Liz is a senior attending
South San Francisco High School
next fall.
Electron Project
Mark Linton is working with
Dr. Kenneth Harker on an elec
tron gun which is being designed
mathematically. James Barstad is
learning the technique of making
cesium plasma clear glass vacuum
tubes. These distinctive structure
shapes are four or five feet long
and are a self-contained unit hold
ing a cathode and heater in one
end that causes cesium to turn
into plasma.
David Copenhagen's project is
a complicated glass enclosed de
vice called an electron stick. This
two or three foot long tube will
generate tremendous powers.
Mike Wagner is studying the
millimeter wave tube in relation
to the micro-wave frequency. Rob
ert Convey and George Beck are
designing components of basic re
search on the linear electron ac
celerator project "M." This larg
est of electron accelerators will
be two miles in length to be built
in the back of Stanford hills.
Cell Prober
Linda Shook is the only student
working in the Bio-Physics labora
tory. She is making a minute ex
amination of the structure of
cells using an X-ray microscope
which can photograph, with clar
ity and detail, the four millionth
part of an inch and enlarge it
forty times.
Four boys are working in the
High Energy laboratory with the
famous 300-foot electron accelera
tor. Richard Harvie, Victor Le
baeqz, Richard Post and Emit
Wallace are doing advanced re
search centering around ten mil
lions of electron volts produced by
the huge accelerator.
This is the second summer for
the professor to help the stu
dents learn a great amount while
earning a small amount. Visitors
are welcome to Hansen Monday
through Friday from 8 to 5 p.m.


Roger Creamer of Atherton and Elizabeth MacCauley of South San Francisco work on plasma tube
project, attempting' to alter shape of light in tube.

Electron Project
Mark Linton is working with
Dr. Kenneth Harker on an elec
tron gun which is being designed
mathematically. James Barstad is
learning the technique of making
cesium plasma clear glass vacuum
tubes. These distinctive structure
shapes are four or five feet long
and are a self-contained unit hold
ing a cathode and heater in one
end that causes cesium to turn
into plasma.
David Copenhagen's project is
a complicated glass enclosed de
vice called an electron stick. This
two or three foot long tube will
generate tremendous powers.
Mike Wagner is studying the
millimeter wave tube in relation
to the micro-wave frequency. Rob
ert Convey and George Beck are
designing components of basic re
search on the linear electron ac
celerator project "M." This larg
est of electron accelerators will
be two miles in length to be built
in the back of Stanford hills.
Cell Prober
Linda Shook is the only student
working in the Bio-Physics labora
tory. She is making a minute ex
amination of the structure of
cells using an X-ray microscope
which can photograph, with clar
ity and detail, the four millionth
part of an inch and enlarge it
forty times.
Four boys are working in the
High Energy laboratory with the
famous 300-foot electron accelera
tor. Richard Harvie, Victor Le
baeqz, Richard Post and Emit
Wallace are doing advanced re
search centering around ten mil
lions of electron volts produced by
the huge accelerator.
This is the second summer for
the professor to help the stu
dents learn a great amount while
earning a small amount. Visitors
are welcome to Hansen Monday
through Friday from 8 to 5 p.m.


Roger Creamer of Atherton and Elizabeth MacCauley of South San Francisco work on plasma tube
project, attempting' to alter shape of light in tube.
Alfred Braun, assistant to the
director of the Microwave Lab at
Hansen Laboratory, heads 14 high
school graduates and two high
school seniors in the "Earn and
Learn" program now in its fifth
year of training serious physics
students.
"This is significant employment
in the student's lives which will
affect their future careers," stated
Braun.
The science enthusiasts come
from local high schools around

the San Francisco area as far
south as San Jose. They work in
the three Hansen Laboratories,
Micro-Wave, High Energy, and
Bio-Physics, all summer.
An eight-week seminar is held
for the group. Prominent mem
bers of the faculty from the Uni
versity will be guest speakers dur
ing the workshop. A basic review
of physics in electricity, magne
tism and mechanics has been com
pleted.
Research Thesis
A new addition to the summer
training is the preparing of a
2500-word thesis concerning the
scientific research each student is
doing. Braun works individually
with each member of the study
group on his report. They obtain
skill in technical writing, and have
concrete knowledge in hand at the
conclusion of their employment.
Several of the students will at
tend Stanford in the fall; others
have enrolled at San Jose State,
the University of California,
Princeton, and Harvard.
In March, Braun began his cam
paign to select the most qualified
graduating seniors for the sum

mer project. By the end of May
he had employed one-sixth of the
100 candidates that applied. Sci
ence teachers from the high
schools nominate their excep
tional senior physics student.
Dennis Taylor and Gary Stein
back are working in basic re
search concerning ferites in solid
state physics. Roger Creamer, Liz
MacCauley and Margaret Mana
ger's project concerns cesium
plasma. Liz is a senior attending
South San Francisco High School
next fall.
