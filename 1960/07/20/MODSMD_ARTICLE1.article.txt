# Elaborate Plans Made for Dance
## 
### 
A full moon overhead, the Pacific Ocean and cliffs in view, a roast
chicken dinner, continuous cocktails and dancing—these are the high
lights of the all-campus dance to be held at the Cliff House in San
Francisco on July 30 from 7-1.
The Cliff House is on a terraced level, enclosed on three sides by

glass walls, overlooking Seal
Rock and the Pacific Ocean on
one side, and the cliffs and beach
on another. There are walks along
the cliffs and beach; Playland
and Sutra's Museum are also very

near by.
Drinks may be pui'chased
throughout the evening, and mu
sic will be supplied by "a very
danceable and somewhat progres
sive" five-piece orchestra. Attire
is semi-formal: dressy cocktail
dresses, and dark suits for the
man—no corsages, for by tradi
tion they are reserved for the
Graduation Ball.
Formal invitations have been
issued to all groups and individ
uals connected with Stanford.
Each Stanford person is welcome
to invite a female guest or an
escort from outside the campus.
Tickets
Dinner-dance tickets can be
purchased for approximately six
dollars in all living groups on
campus and at the ASSU office.
The supply is limited, however, so
Dick Sayles, chairman of the
dance, suggests that they be pur
chased as soon as possible.
Tickets for the dance alone,
valid after 9:15 p.m., can also be
purchased for $2.50 through the
living groups or ASSU office, and
also at the Cliff House itself on
the evening of the dance.
Direction for getting to the
Cliff House will be published,
along with a map, in next week's
paper.
