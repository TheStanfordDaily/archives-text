# Coffee Hours Here to Stay
## 
### 
"The last Coffee Hour at the
International Center was so suc
cessful that we decided to con
tinue them during the whole .sum
mer quarter. Many foreign stu
dents gather there, but we would
also like to see more Americans
in order to exchange views and
opinions with them.
"The coffee and the cookies are
free and the atmosphere is relaxed
and casual. Inside we have a hi-fi
set for music lovers; outside, a
sunny porch and a ping-pong ta
ble.
"Besides the off-campus Happy
Hours, the I-Club Coffee Hours
are the only regular get-togethers
for all students. Very often week
end trips and part ies are planned
spontaneously there.
"So don't hesitateâ€”drop in next
Friday around 5 p.m. at the I
Center."
Rudy Meiner,
President, I Club
