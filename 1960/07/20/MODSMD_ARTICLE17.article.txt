Mrs. Romana Palvolgyi, who
has been an assistant in the Engi
neering Department at McGill
while working on her master's
thesis, will work toward the Ph.D.
degree. She will continue her
studies in a research program of
hypersonic airflow, one of the
basic problems of jet engines and
rocket designs.
The scholarships are offered an
