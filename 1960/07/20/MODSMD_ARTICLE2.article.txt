# NEXT WEDNESDAY
## Tables Up For Bridge 
### 
For a change from the regular
after-dinner games of dormitory
bridge, ASSU suggests that all
kibbitzers, novices, and world
champion bridge playere come for
an "Evening of Bridge" at the
Women's Clubhouse, next Wednes
day night, from 7 to 10:30.
Plenty of tables will be set up
in the lower lounge of the club
house, which is located on the
west side of Union court, across
the street from the post office.
Thos having the dummy hand can
get a coke in the machine above
the Cellar right across the court.
For trying your hand with a
new bridge partner, this evening
is an opportunity not to miss.
