# Historical Economist Tackles Topic of Jazz
## 
### 
An odd combination, jazz and economicsâ€”but Tuesday Evening
Series listeners next week will be shown some connections between
these two areas in America by Dr. Eric Hobsbawm, visiting professor
in the economics department.
In fact, his book, The Jazz Scene, which deals with such problems as

the economics involved in making
records and the pay in performing
jazz, has just been released in the
United States. Hobsbawm de
scribes this book as "an introduc
tion to jazz for 'squarer' readers."
Hobsbawm found himself im
mersed in jazz while in high
school. A friend of his, one of the
early jazz musicians, helped him
cultivate his interest. Now he
writes weekly criticisms on Eng
lish performances, such as Ballads
and Blues Concerts, for the week
ly paper, New Statesman.
In England, Hobsbawm de
clares, more jazz records are pro
duced than here, but there are no

jazz stations comparable to some
F.M. American stations, which de
vote their entire broadcasting
time to jazz artists. With this out
let and with our present economic
state of affairs, Hobsbawm won
ders why more Americans do not
appreciate jazz. It is this question
which will concern him Tuesday
night.
The economic historian earned
the Ph.D. degree in history at
Cambridge and is teaching history
at the University of London. He
is at present instructing a class in
the Economic History of Modern
Europe during the Stanford sum
mer session.
