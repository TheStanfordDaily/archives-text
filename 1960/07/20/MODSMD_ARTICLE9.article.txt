### 
The Stanford Players is proud to present its
two-week run of Jean Giraudoux's "Eleetra" start
ing Thursday night, July 28.
The play, based on an old Greek myth, is cen
tered around Eleetra, sister of Orestes, who seeks
to avenge his father's death.
Astrid Willsrud will play the title role of the
young girl whose passionate concern for justice
outweighs her consideration of human values.
Miss Willsrud has just finished four seasons of
professional theatre in New York, Boston, and
Washington, D.C. A Stanford graduate of the
class of 1956, she has also appeared on major
television productions.
Edmund Roney will take the role of Aegisthus,
King of Argos. The King of the Beggars in this
sophisticated, witty drama is Alec Ross, who ap
peared in the lead role of "Under Milkwood"
earlier at Stanford.
The petty queen, Clytemnestra, will be acted
by Elizabeth Forest, seen in the current produc

tion of "The Beautiful People." Robert Sessions,
also in earlier Stanford productions this year,
will play the role of Orestes, the exile who re
turns to reclaim his throne.
The gardener will be played by Luke Vania;
the President, by Floyd Witham; Agath, by Ellen
Cowley; Narse's wife, by Flora Kirschner; Cap
tain, by James Lyon; and the Furies by Susan
James, Louise Carter, and Lorraine Amirian.
Directing the play is George Forest, with the
set design by Wendell Cole, costume design by
Jan Pratt and lighting by Paul Landry. Original
music has been composed by the director and
will be played by flutists Ann Cleary and Judy
Gant; oboist Bard Brutsman, percussionists Jo
seph Byrd and Robert Schuneman; trumpeter
Ralph La Canna; and harpist Anne Trammel.
