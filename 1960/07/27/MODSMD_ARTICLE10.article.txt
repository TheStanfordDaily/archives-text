# Students Try International Folk Dances
## 
### 
Throughout the quarter, the Stanford Folk
Dancers have offered summer people a chance to
learn an international custom by doing.
For the past four Friday evenings, campus
people have come to Bowman Alumni House or
the Dinkelspiel parking lot to dance their way
through international folk dances in the cool
outdoors.
After an introductory demonstration of a
dance new to the group, the members dance cir

cle dances, such as the Israeli Mayim or Lech
Lamidbar, and couple and group dances includ
ing the American square dance. Often regular
members of the folk dancers don costumes and
portray the spirit of native dancers from other
lands.
Although only two Friday evenings remain,
the folk dancers welcome all enthusiasts to their
informal gatherings. The dancers will meet at
Bowman Alumni House this Friday at 8 p.m.
