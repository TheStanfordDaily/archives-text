# Human Forgiveness Fights Ideal In Players' Version of 'Electra'
## 
### 
The persistence of an ideal ver
sus human forgiveness provides
the conflict in the mind of Electra
in the Stanford Players' presenta
tion of Giraudoux's version of
"Electra" opening tomorrow night
at the Stanford Little Theatre.
Electra is faced with the deci
sion of whether to save the city
from the Corinthians or to let her
ideal of justice triumph. It is her
decision and the consequences
which follow that make this ver
sion an heroic drama rather than
a tragedy.
The happenings in the contem
porary version develop a caustic
and ironic wit not present in the

Greek drama. The Greek usage
of a chorus to hover over the ac
tion and foretell the dire conse
quences has been placed in the
person of the King of the Beggars.
Personal Conflicts
The main conflict of persons ex
ists between the protagonist - an
tagonist Electra and Aegisthus as
Electra seeks justice for her fa
ther's death. Clytemnestra takes
little part on either sideâ€”she is
too preoccupied with self-pity and
sympathy for the plight of women
to be described as anything other
than the petty queen.
An unusual characteristic of the
Stanford version concerns the Fu
ries, who, during the play, grow
up from nine years of age to 21.
These three Furies haunt Orestes,
brother of Electra, trying to con
vince him of the "best" way to
attain happiness and security in
the situation ho faces.
The settings designed by Wen
dell Cole support the surrealistic
mood of the Giraudoux interpre
tation. For example, the roof of
the castle consists of pieces of
rocks floating from the ceiling,
giving a feeling of the heavy doom
and foreboding destiny which
hangs over the castle. Even the
walls can be recognized as facades
of pretense as Aegisthus and Cly
temnestra try to pretend that all
is well.
The music which Director
George Forest has originally cre
ated is in keeping with the play.
The harp, flutes, oboe, trumpet
and percussion instruments com
bine, in semi-classical "Debussy
like" modes in some places and
in discordant sounds where they
are appropriate.
Players
Starring in the play are Astrid
Willsrud as Electra. Miss Wills
rud, a Stanford graduate from
Redwood City, has completed four
seasons of professional theater in
New York, Boston, and Washing
ton, D.C.
