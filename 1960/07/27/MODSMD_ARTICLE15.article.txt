# Civil Engineering Head At International Union
## 
### 
Fall students of Dr. Ray K. Linsley, head of the Civil Engineering
Department, will undoubtedly learn some first-hand x-esults about
the International Geophysics Year from information Linsley is
gathering at a meeting of the International Union of Geodesy and

Geophysics in Helsinki, Finland.
During the next few weeks,
Linsley will also present before
one association of this Union, the
International Association of Hy
drology, a paper in which he will
describe a project of estimating
stream flow on Los Trancos
Creek.
Waterflow Problem
Hydrologists have been con
cerned with the problem of find
ing machinery or some other
means of accomplishing this task
for many years. Co-author of the
paper entitled "Computation of
Synthetic Streamflow Records on
a Digital Computer," is Stanford
graduate student Norman Craw
ford, also in the department of
Civil Engineering.
Union Composition
The Union, which meets every
three years, is composed of rep
resentatives from the United
States, Russia, France, England,
Germany and other countries
which have delved only into the
scientific side of geophysics and
geodesy, the science of the spheri
cal shape of the earth.
For the presentation of papers
such as Linsley's, the Union is
divided into such associations as
meteorology, hydrology, terrestial
magnetism, geochemistry.
Linsley has been invited by the
Israeli government to discuss and
advise Israeli hydrologists on the
problem Israel has of recovering
water. After his visit there he will
return home August 15.
