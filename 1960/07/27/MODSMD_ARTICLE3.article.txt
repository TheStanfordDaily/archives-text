# All Campus Dinner-Dance Tickets For Saturday Evening Going Fast
## 
### 
Tickets are going fast for the all-campus dinner dance this Satur
day from 7-1 at the Cliff House, San Francisco.
The affair features a roast chicken dinner, dancing to a modern
five-piece orchestra, cocktails served throughout the evening, and a
view of the full moon over the cliffs and ocean.
Tickets should be purchased as soon as possible, says Dick Sayles,
dance chairman, for the supply of dinner-dance tickets is limited to

100 couples, and the dance is only
three days away. Dinner-dance
tickets are $6. available in all cam
pus living groups and at the
ASSU office.
Dance Tickets
Tickets for the dance alone,
valid after 9:15 p.m., are also
available at $2.50 and they may
be purchased at the Cliff House
itself on the evening of the dance.
Stags are encouraged, says ASSU
President Dave Montgomery, and
two persons may come in on one
$2.50 ticket.
The dance is semi-formal:
dressy cocktail dresses for women
and dark suits for men. No
corsages are required; by Stan
ford tradition they are reserved
for the Senior Ball.
Romatic Setting
San Francisco's famous Cliff
House overlooks Seal Rock and
the Pacific Ocean on one side and
the cliffs and beach on another. It
is on a terraced level enclosed on
three sides by glass walls, and
around it are walks along the
cliffs and beach. Playland-at-the-
Beach and Sutro's Museum are
near by.
Saturday's dinner dance takes
the place of the Lagunita Semi
formal and the All Campus Dance
sponsored by Crothers.
Each Stanford person may in
vite a female guest or an escort
from outside the campus.
