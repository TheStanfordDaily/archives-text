# Recent Hannibal Trip Tuesday Evening Topic
## 
### 
In 218 B.C. Hannibal marched
37 war elephants and 37 thousand
warriors across the Alps. In 1956
A.D. a British Alpine Hannibal
Expedition from Cambridge de
cided to find out which route Han
nibal took in making this journey,
and after three years of prepar
ing one elephant and seven men,

a group set out from France last
summer and crossed the Alps to
Turin, Italy.
This contemporary journey will
be ably described by the head of
that expedition, John M. Hoyte,
who will accompany his lecture
with slides and films taken during
the trek, Tuesday night at 8 p.m.
in Memorial Auditorium.
Hoyte has written a book de
scribing all phases of the trip,
including the special knee pads
and boots made for Jumbo, the
elephant, and the route they chose
â€”the Iseri-Arc-Mount Cenis route.
Because of his participation in
the project, he was asked by the
British Foreign Office to tour
Germany to lecture on Hannibal.
