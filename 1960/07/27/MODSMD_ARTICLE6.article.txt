# Group Studies Documents, Crises, To Learn Why Wars Are Fought
## 
### FRANCES FISHER 
"Why do countries fight wars?" is a crucial
question under study here at Stanford.
The Conflict Study Project, started in 1947 un
der Dr. Robert C. North, associate professor of
political science, has recently been awarded $250,-
000 by the Ford Foundation which will enable
research to continue for five years.
Dr. North, an authority on Sino-Soviet rela
tions, is working with teams of Stanford political
scientists, historians, economists, psychologists,
anthropologists and sociologists to find out what
causes a nation to choose violence as a means to
settle a conflict.
Documents Analyzed
The governmental documents issued during
certain periods of crisis are one type of material
used by the researchers in their studies. It is
hoped that through study of these documents
new principles can be discovered about the essen
tial differences between situations which end vio
lently and those which are settled peacefully.
For example, Howard Koch, Dina Zinnis, Jon
Bridgman, Belva Borgquist and Wilfrid Kone
are conducting detailed research into the Euro
pean situation in 1914 immediately before World
War I and the comparable situation in 1908 dur
ing the Bosnian crisis. The elements involved in
each crisis are extremely similar. These people
are asking why the Bosnian crisis remained non
violent when the events in 1914 started World
War I. They will examine documents published
in the affected countries at that time.

In their studies, the researchers are also test
ing existing theories as to why wars start. One
widely held theory which the group is question
ing is the assumption that a nation only goes to
war when it feels that it is stronger than its ene
mies. Their analysis may reveal that rational
calculation of power is not the determining fac
tor between war and peace.
Another type of study being carried on in the
Research House, located near Bowman Alumni
House, is an analysis of one-half million feet of
German war film. Earnest Rose is conducting
this study to try to find the principles which the
German film producer Gobels employed to use
theater newsreels as a propaganda medium.
Contemporary studies are also conducted by
the group, such as a comparison of the policies
issued from Peking and Moscow, to see where
China and Russia differ in their policies.
Graduate Seminar
A graduate research seminar, "International
Political Behavior," has emerged from this con
flict story. During the past term advanced grad
uate students have collected and compiled exten
sive records of the goals and decisions of the
major countries of Europe before the outbreak
of World War I.
In summarizing the general aim of the project,
Dr. North stated, "History suggests that even
two hostile nations can learn to control their
conflicts. We want to find out more about the
ways in which such conflicts can be limited and
handled peacefully."
