# Students Study, Live Together To Learn Japanese, Chinese
## 
### CAROLE CRAYNE 
""Mickey Mouse-Magic Slates and Spanish guitar music do not seem
very Oriental, but those are two characteristics of Stanford's Asian
House, the coeducational living group for students taking the 15-unit
intensive Japanese and Chinese language courses this summer.
The magic slates are used for practicing Japanese and Chinese

characters. Though many students
are taking an interest in Oriental
music, Spanish guitar seems to re
main popular there.
Asian House is sponsored by the
University to give the students a
chance to live and study together,
talk over their problems, and, es
pecially, have a chance to speak
the language. The house, in its
second year of operation, is lo
cated at Stillman, a women's row
house during the rest of the year.
Women live on the second floor
and men on the third, and the
downstairs is a recreation area
open to both.
Asian House has 12 men and 9
women out of the 46 students tak
ing intensive or second-year Japa
nese or Chinese. The courses in
clude graduate students, teachers,
and students from as far away as
Princeton as well as regular Stan
ford students.
The main occupation at the
house is studying, for these stu
dents are taking a normal year's
work in the language crammed
into eight weeks. They have 19
hours of classes a week and heavy
outside assignments.
Students are screened carefully
before being admitted to the
courses. Their past academic per
formance and previous training in
language are considered to see if
they have language aptitude. Only
one student has had to drop the
course.
The intensive program is good

if a student can have a regular
course afterwards, says Tom
Turnbull, first-year Japanese stu
dent, for otherwise it would soon
be forgotten. He says the big
problem in learning the language
is the vocabulary â€” there aren't
any words related to the English.
Learning to read and write the
languages is especially difficult
because the Chinese and Japanese
use picture characters rather than
a phonetic alphabet. Students at
Asian House spend a lot of time
practicing characters on black
boards and magic slates. They
also have a tape listening room to
help them learn the language.
Special cultural activities are
part of the Asian House program.
They range from Professor Hiro
shi Miyaji's Tuesday programs
about Japan to informal trips to
the City for Chinese or Japanese
food. They have had slides and
tapes of Japanese No plays and
history of the Kabuki drama, dem
onstrations of Chinese classical
theatrical dancing and a Japanese
tea ceremony, and a talk on Japa
nese religions, Buddhism and
Shinto.
The students have many varied
reasons for wanting to learn Chi
nese or Japanese. A big aim of
most of them is to get to the
countries whose languages they
are studying.
For example, Jack Huddleston
Jr., first-year Japanese student,
hopes to do teaching or govern
ment work. He taught English to
businessmen in Japan in 1958.
Caroline Hastings is taking first
year Chinese because she wants to
read the works of the poets Li Po
and Tu Fu in the original.
Their housemother, Lois Ander
son, studies Russian and serves
as a neutral party between the
two languages studied in the
house.
