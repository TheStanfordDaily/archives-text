# 'Electra' Termed Very Professional Job; Dramatics and Stage Effects Powerful
## 
### Ward McAfee 
The Stanford Players' second
1960 summer production, "Elec
tra," is presented very profes
sionally.
The stage effects are handled
with great taste. Wendell Cole's
setting, designed with artistic
magnificance, is made powerful
by Paul Landry's excellent light
ing. The music and costumes help
to give the viewer complete faith
in the production.
No flaws were evident in the
acting itself. What "The Beautiful
People" lacked in convincing act
ing "Electra" has. Alec Ross,
playing a begger who is more like
an oracle, does an excellent job.
His explanation of the mistakes
the gods make in dealing out
punishment to sinners—hedgehog
variety—should not be missed.
Astrid Willsrud as Electra
clutches the viewers' full atten
tion with her flashes of hate di
rected at her mother, Clytemnes
tra, played by Elizabeth Forest.
Miss Forest, seen as a kind old
lady in "The Beautiful People,"
ably shifts among compassion,
frustration and hate in her role
as the queen mother.
Edmund Roney, Clytemnestra's
cousin and lover Aegisthus, does
an able job in presenting the char
acter of a man who would issue a
sentence of execution for the
petty thief of the murderer. Mr.
Roney's costume and makeup add
to his effectiveness. Robert Ses
sions as Electra's brother Orestes
does well as the strong youth
destined to carry out Electra's
sense of justice.
Susan James, Louise Carter,
and Lorraine Amirian are mag
nificant as the three Furies. At
times their actions and voices give
the viewer the impression that
they are spirits and not human
beings on a stage. The lighting
and their makeup combine to en
hance the acting of the Furies. Of

course, a play is no better than its
director, and this play is excellent.
George Forest, the director of
"Electra," is therefore deserving
of praise.
The philosophy of Existential
ism is present in the theme of
"Electra." The individual, in this
case Electra, in carrying out her
idea of justice, effects others; and
in doing so she becomes unjust.

Electra, convinced something is
rotten in the state of Denmark
proceeds to destroy Denmark, in
this case Argos. A question is
raised: is there justice?
The remaining performances are
tomorrow, Friday and Saturday
nights. Tickets may be purchased
at the Memorial Auditorium Box
Office. Performances are held in
the Little Theater.


AGATIIA AND TIIE PRESIDENT, FROM "ELECTRA"
Agatha, played by Ellen Cowley, remains obstinate as her husband,
the President, played by Floyd Witham, demands her lover's name.

rotten in the state of Denmark
proceeds to destroy Denmark, in
this case Argos. A question is
raised: is there justice?
The remaining performances are
tomorrow, Friday and Saturday
nights. Tickets may be purchased
at the Memorial Auditorium Box
Office. Performances are held in
the Little Theater.


AGATIIA AND TIIE PRESIDENT, FROM "ELECTRA"
Agatha, played by Ellen Cowley, remains obstinate as her husband,
the President, played by Floyd Witham, demands her lover's name.
The Stanford Players' second
1960 summer production, "Elec
tra," is presented very profes
sionally.
The stage effects are handled
with great taste. Wendell Cole's
setting, designed with artistic
magnificance, is made powerful
by Paul Landry's excellent light
ing. The music and costumes help
to give the viewer complete faith
in the production.
No flaws were evident in the
acting itself. What "The Beautiful
People" lacked in convincing act
ing "Electra" has. Alec Ross,
playing a begger who is more like
an oracle, does an excellent job.
His explanation of the mistakes
the gods make in dealing out
punishment to sinners—hedgehog
variety—should not be missed.
Astrid Willsrud as Electra
clutches the viewers' full atten
tion with her flashes of hate di
rected at her mother, Clytemnes
tra, played by Elizabeth Forest.
Miss Forest, seen as a kind old
lady in "The Beautiful People,"
ably shifts among compassion,
frustration and hate in her role
as the queen mother.
Edmund Roney, Clytemnestra's
cousin and lover Aegisthus, does
an able job in presenting the char
acter of a man who would issue a
sentence of execution for the
petty thief of the murderer. Mr.
Roney's costume and makeup add
to his effectiveness. Robert Ses
sions as Electra's brother Orestes
does well as the strong youth
destined to carry out Electra's
sense of justice.
Susan James, Louise Carter,
and Lorraine Amirian are mag
nificant as the three Furies. At
times their actions and voices give
the viewer the impression that
they are spirits and not human
beings on a stage. The lighting
and their makeup combine to en
hance the acting of the Furies. Of

course, a play is no better than its
director, and this play is excellent.
George Forest, the director of
"Electra," is therefore deserving
of praise.
The philosophy of Existential
ism is present in the theme of
"Electra." The individual, in this
case Electra, in carrying out her
idea of justice, effects others; and
in doing so she becomes unjust.

Electra, convinced something is
rotten in the state of Denmark
proceeds to destroy Denmark, in
this case Argos. A question is
raised: is there justice?
