# Radiation Preventatives Found in Foods, Drugs
## 
### 
Since the end of World War II the danger of radiation has come
before the public. The fright of radioactive fallout and its terrible
consequences is present in all of us. The worker in nuclear plants
must be protected as well as the cancer patient deliberately exposed

to high radiation.
Because of the need for protec
tion from poisonous radioactivity
modern science is working on
methods to safeguard human be
ings from undue radiation. Stan
ford Research Institute is working
on this problem through two proj
ects, one for the Quartermaster
Research and Engineering Com
mand and the other for Walter
Reed Army Institute of Research.
Several years ago other re
searchers discovered that a high
percentage of animals that had
cabbage in their diet lived through
radiation exposure that killed non
cabbage-eating animals. Through
methods of trial and elimination
the SRI group working for the
Quartermaster project are discov
ering which foods give the most
protection.
Toxic to Humans
The SRI workers on the Walter
Reed project have found that
drugs which give protection from
radiation are toxic to humans.
Their goal is to maintain the anti
radiation qualities of the drugs
while simultaneously reducing
toxicity.
If and when methods are found
to protect humans from the dan
gers of radiation, cancer patients
will be able to receive larger tu
mor-killing radiation doses. Other
applications are also awaiting suc
cessful conclusions to these two
experiments.
