# New Spectrometer Sorts, Deflects, Probes Electrons
## 
### AUSTIN SCOTT 
A gigantic new machine designed to look inside the heart of an atom was unveiled last week at Stan
ford's Electronic Labs.
The 150-ton instrument, a magnetic spectrometer, will probe the innards of particles of matter so
small it would take 16,000 billion of them side by side to reach one inch.
Goal of the research work to be done by the instrument is an understanding of the electrical and mag-

netic structure of the particles
that form atomic nuclei, the pro
ton and the neutron.
Despite the near miracles sci
entists have performed with
atoms, little is known about the
nature of the insides of atomic
nuclei. A lot more knowledge is
needed to understand the nature
of matter and to account for its
electrical and magnetic behavior.
Professor Robert Hofstadter
and a group of associates are us
ing the new machine.
A magnetic spectrometer bends
the paths of electrons as they
speed through space. The greater
their speed, the less they are bent.
This particular spectrometer is
more powerful than any that have
been built before — one million
watts. It will be used in con
junction with Stanford's billion
volt Mark 111 Linear accelerator.
Discrepancies
Using a smaller spectrometer,
Professor Hofstadter found some
discrepancies in the behavior of
nuclei that undermine the basic
theories of eloctromagnetism.
There is a difference in what the
theories say the neutron charge
should be, and what it seems to
be. (Yes, the neutron does have a
charge, although not in the ordi
nary sense.)
The discrepancy led some phys
icists to wonder if their theories,
although good for most electro
magnetic phenomena, are not in
valid for objects of such fine di
mensions as the proton and neu
tron. Dr. Hofstader hopes to find
out.
Electrons passing close to a
target nuclear particle are de
flected in various ways depending
on the construction of the particle
and how close the electrons come.
As they bounce off at different

angles, the spectrometer sorts
them into groups corresponding
to the amount of deflection they
have undergone. By counting the
electrons in the different groups,
Professor Hofstadter gets a pic
ture of the particle.
Spectrometer tests such as this
first hinted that electrons, pro
tons and neutrons were not the
smallest possible particles, but
were themselves made up of
smaller particles — mesons. Dr.
Hofstadter hopes to go even
further.
Defection Measured
The spectrometer is basically a
30 foot high,, 200 ton electro
magnet mounted on a rotating
gun mount. It is equipped with
devices to measure the angles to
which electrons are deflected, and
to count them.
Dr. Hofstader received the 1959
California Scientist of the Year
award for his work with smaller
spectrometers — ones that probed
within 30 millionths of a billionth
of a centemeter of nuclear cores.
The new spectrometer should do
quite a bit better.

tons and neutrons were not the
smallest possible particles, but
were themselves made up of
smaller particles — mesons. Dr.
Hofstadter hopes to go even
further.
Defection Measured
The spectrometer is basically a
30 foot high,, 200 ton electro
magnet mounted on a rotating
gun mount. It is equipped with
devices to measure the angles to
which electrons are deflected, and
to count them.
Dr. Hofstader received the 1959
California Scientist of the Year
award for his work with smaller
spectrometers — ones that probed
within 30 millionths of a billionth
of a centemeter of nuclear cores.
The new spectrometer should do
quite a bit better.
A gigantic new machine designed to look inside the heart of an atom was unveiled last week at Stan
ford's Electronic Labs.
The 150-ton instrument, a magnetic spectrometer, will probe the innards of particles of matter so
small it would take 16,000 billion of them side by side to reach one inch.
Goal of the research work to be done by the instrument is an understanding of the electrical and mag-

netic structure of the particles
that form atomic nuclei, the pro
ton and the neutron.
Despite the near miracles sci
entists have performed with
atoms, little is known about the
nature of the insides of atomic
nuclei. A lot more knowledge is
needed to understand the nature
of matter and to account for its
electrical and magnetic behavior.
Professor Robert Hofstadter
and a group of associates are us
ing the new machine.
A magnetic spectrometer bends
the paths of electrons as they
speed through space. The greater
their speed, the less they are bent.
This particular spectrometer is
more powerful than any that have
been built before — one million
watts. It will be used in con
junction with Stanford's billion
volt Mark 111 Linear accelerator.
Discrepancies
Using a smaller spectrometer,
Professor Hofstadter found some
discrepancies in the behavior of
nuclei that undermine the basic
theories of eloctromagnetism.
There is a difference in what the
theories say the neutron charge
should be, and what it seems to
be. (Yes, the neutron does have a
charge, although not in the ordi
nary sense.)
The discrepancy led some phys
icists to wonder if their theories,
although good for most electro
magnetic phenomena, are not in
valid for objects of such fine di
mensions as the proton and neu
tron. Dr. Hofstader hopes to find
out.
Electrons passing close to a
target nuclear particle are de
flected in various ways depending
on the construction of the particle
and how close the electrons come.
As they bounce off at different

angles, the spectrometer sorts
them into groups corresponding
to the amount of deflection they
have undergone. By counting the
electrons in the different groups,
Professor Hofstadter gets a pic
ture of the particle.

first hinted that electrons, pro
tons and neutrons were not the
smallest possible particles, but
