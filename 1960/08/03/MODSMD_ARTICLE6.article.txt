# ASSU Legislature Retires With a Bang of the Gavel
## 
### 
"The summer ASSU acts as the social planning board for Sum
mer Quarter. Its functions and powers are limited to matters per
taining to summer quarter. As we come to the close of this session,
perhaps it is appropriate to reflect on the weeks behind us.
"From the outset, this summer's legislature endeavored to provide
a balanced program of activities in order to include every interested
student. Since well over half the summer student body is in graduate
school and two-thirds of the men are married, the ASSU sought to
provide as many family activities as possible. For example, the
summer legislature requested and received an additional $50 in order
to finance a third watermelon picnic because these picnics have been
very successful family affairs in the past. Even the dinner-dance
was subsidized in an effort to hold down the cost for the budget
conscious student.
"Particular highlights of the summer were the pre-reg dance at
Bowman, the picnic at Huddart Park, the happy hours at Zott's, and
finally 'Moonlight on the Cliffs' this past Saturday. My special thanks
go to Bob Sangster, my administrative assistant; Dick Sayles, dinner
dance chairman, and Ann Heywood and Ward McDonald, vice-chair
men of the dance, for their time and talents in making these events
the top ones on the summer calendar.
' While on the subject of my personal 'thank you's' for jobs well
done, I would like to thank the summer legislature: Nancy Loomis,
Pam McCain, Rosemary George, Lawson Lowe, Jim Wisner, Lois
Root, Beau Bianchi, Lynn Bramkamp, vice president Dave Peterson,
and business manager Ed Warren. Particular thanks on publicity
go to Sandy Rosa, director of Pub. Rel., and Lynn Bramkamp for
getting the word to his "troops" in the education school. Finally, my
thanks to Miss Aten, Mrs. Farmer, Sally and Margaret in the ASSU
office, without whose help student government would collapse at
Stanford.
