# Hoover Comes For Meeting
## 
### Anne Rose, Hoover Institution 
"Today, August 1, 1960, the Ad
visory Board of the Hoover In
stitution held its annual meeting
at Stanford. Seated around the
tables were many and varied dis
tinguished members of the board.
Among those present was a man
well-known to Stanford, the Unit
ed States, and the world, Herbert
Hoover.
"At the conclusion of the meet
ing, the staff of the Hoover Insti
tution gathered in the reading
room to pay tribute to a great
man commemorating his eighty
sixth birthday.
"Miss Marianne Thalmann rep
resented the entire staff as she
spoke, 'presenting to you this
photograph of the Hoover Institu
tion as a token of our affection
and wish you many years of hap
piness and continued good health.'
She also told him of a portfolio
of colored photographs taken of
the Lou Henry Hoover room
which would be sent to him in
New York upon its completion.
The tall man graciously accepted
the picture and in a clear, strong
voice filled with emotion, said he
really didn't have a suitable pic
ture and he was most grateful.
"After speaking to the group as
a whole, he went all the way
around the room shaking hands
firmly with each of us, speaking
to each as if at that moment you
were his only concern. He made
us feel as if we were doing him
the favor of coming.
"And therein his greatness lies.
In his friendliness he is modest,
kind and considerate. His atten
tion to each of U3 was almost
more important than the hand
shake."
