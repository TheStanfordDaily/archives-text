With the independence of Nigeria scheduled for October, the
Nigerian officials are attempting to plot out their economic needs
and to develop plans of action.
To study the country's transportation requirements as they relate
to economic development in the next ten years and to plan a program

for the development of the Nige
rian transport industry, a team of
specialists from Stanford Re

and the Treasury Department.
Recently appointed to SRI as an

dustrial Development Center,
Stanton R. Smith will aid the team
with his experience gained from
