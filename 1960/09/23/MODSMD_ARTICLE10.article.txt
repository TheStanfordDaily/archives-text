# Freshmen Start Third Busy Orientation Day
## Sterling Calls For Leadership 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Stanford President Walla re
Sterling called on the Class of 'G1
to produce its best "in order to
clarify and advance our national
purpose" at the Freshman Con
vocation Wednesday evening in
Frost Amphitheater.
In welcoming the 1.275) mem
ber's of the University's 69th
freshman class, Sterling intro
duced them to the school, de
scribed their characteristics as a
class and also challenged them to
respond to claims that the nation
needs "better leadership and
deeper individual commitment."
STERLING, who leaves next
Thursday on an extended Euro
pean trip, spoke a-s part of an im
pressive 50-minute convocation
which began as dusk fell over the
cool greenness of the amphi
theater.
Noting the debate over the na
tional purpose, he asked the class
"What are you . . . going to do
about it?"
Then he declared: "Opportunity
is here all about us -rich and
varied—to love life, to learn of it.
and to live it. So go 1o it and
see what you can do in response
to those who claim that we need
better leadership and deeper in
dividual commitment."
THE PRESIDENT pointed out
the circumstances which have
combined to produce the discus
sion on national purpose. Among
these he cited the cold war and
"conditions . . . peculiar to the i
United States."
He talked of the "complex, mo
bile and highly industrialized so
ciety" in the U.S. and the problem
of how the individual can "retain I
his individuality and find expres-!
sion for his creative powers'
amidst such a trend."
Also prompting the national!
purpose debate, he said, is the j
charge that material abundance!
has made the U.S. "soft and self
centered. As one observer puts it: J
'Our problem is how to stay
awake on a full stomach.' "
THEN HE ADDED: "... there
is broad and basic agreement that
we do have a national purpose:
We want peace with justice; we
want to assure and. if possible,
o'evate the dignity of all men; we
want to reduce ignorance and !
disease.
"That these constitute a truly
noble national purpose there can
be no doubt. But we have had es- I
sentially this kind of national j
purpose for decades.
"The current debate is con
cerned, therefore, with explana- j
tions for our falling short of its
achievement, and suggestions for
our doing much better."

sion for his creative powers'
amidst such a trend."
Also prompting the national!
purpose debate, he said, is the j
charge that material abundance!
has made the U.S. "soft and self
centered. As one observer puts it: J
'Our problem is how to stay
awake on a full stomach.' "
THEN HE ADDED: "... there
is broad and basic agreement that
we do have a national purpose:
We want peace with justice; we
want to assure and. if possible,
o'evate the dignity of all men; we
want to reduce ignorance and !
disease.
"That these constitute a truly
noble national purpose there can
be no doubt. But we have had es- I
sentially this kind of national j
purpose for decades.
"The current debate is con
cerned, therefore, with explana- j
tions for our falling short of its
achievement, and suggestions for
our doing much better."
Stanford President Walla re
Sterling called on the Class of 'G1
to produce its best "in order to
clarify and advance our national
purpose" at the Freshman Con
vocation Wednesday evening in
Frost Amphitheater.
In welcoming the 1.275) mem
ber's of the University's 69th
freshman class, Sterling intro
duced them to the school, de
scribed their characteristics as a
class and also challenged them to
respond to claims that the nation
needs "better leadership and
deeper individual commitment."
STERLING, who leaves next
Thursday on an extended Euro
pean trip, spoke a-s part of an im
pressive 50-minute convocation
which began as dusk fell over the
cool greenness of the amphi
theater.
Noting the debate over the na
tional purpose, he asked the class
"What are you . . . going to do
about it?"
Then he declared: "Opportunity
is here all about us -rich and
varied—to love life, to learn of it.
and to live it. So go 1o it and
see what you can do in response
to those who claim that we need
better leadership and deeper in
dividual commitment."
THE PRESIDENT pointed out
the circumstances which have
combined to produce the discus
sion on national purpose. Among
these he cited the cold war and
"conditions . . . peculiar to the i
United States."
He talked of the "complex, mo
bile and highly industrialized so
ciety" in the U.S. and the problem
of how the individual can "retain I
his individuality and find expres-!
sion for his creative powers'
amidst such a trend."
