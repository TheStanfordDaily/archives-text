# NEW OVERSEAS BRANCHES
## Italy, France Welcome Undergrad Pioneers 
### 
An adventure in living and learning begins for 160 Stanford
undergrade Sunday when they dock at Le Havre, Franee, and head
for the new Stanford campuses in Italy and France.
The two pioneer groups of 80 each will file down the gangplank
from the niotorship T.S.S. Aseania and depart for Florence, Italy

and I ours, France.
INSTRUCTION at both branch
es starts Oct. 3. Dedication cere
monies are set for Tours Oct. 8
and Florence Oct. 12.
Assembled from their homes all
over the United States, the stu
dents sailed from New York Sept.
15.
Parents, girlfriends, boyfriends
and just plain friends gathered at
San Francisco International Air
port the evening of Sept. 14 to say
goodbye 10 121 of the students.
TEARS WERE SHED, hasty
kisses exchanged and final "have
funs" yelled as the visibly excited
students departed for their six
month European stay.
Eighty will take up residence in
a new building in the cultural cen
ter of the City of Tours, in the
heart of the Chateau country.
The other 80 will bo quartered
in Villa S. Paolo in the hills of
Florence, treasure city of Renais
sance.
Both groups, equally divided be
tween men and women, will be
visited by University President
Wallace Sterling and other digni
taries when the two branches
formally become part of Stanford.
THE FRENCH CAMPUS inaug
ural will be held in the Tours city
hall Saturday, Oct. 8.
Scheduled to participate besides
Sterling, are Louis Joxe, French
minister of education, U.S. Am
bassador Amory Houghton, May
or Jean Royer of Tours and Rec
tor Andre Loyen of the University
of Poitiers.
Columbus Day. Wednesday, Oct.
12, has been chosen for the Flor
ence ceremony.
Site will be the historic Palazzo
Vecchio, with Giacinto Bosco,
Italian minister of education, U.S.
Ambassador James D. Zellerbach,
Lorenzo Salazar, acting mayor of
Florence and Rector Paolo La
manna of the University of Flor
ence as honored guests.
THE FARM'S first overseas
campus, the "Burg" near Stutt
gart, Germany, has been operat
ing with 68 students since June
1958.
Success of this program led the
University to establish the two
new centers. Wilh fresh groups
going to each of the three exten
sions every six months, 456 stu
dents will study abroad each year.
In time, about 35 per cent of the
University's undergraduates will
take part. Possible sites for cam
puses in Tokyo and Hong Kong
also are being investigated.
"For so large a cross-section of
the undergraduate student body
to have this opportunity makes
the Stanford Overseas Program a
truly pioneering venture in Amer
ican education," Sterling said.
TWO RESIDENT FACULTY
members are on the permanent
staff of the Tours and Florence
centers and two regular Stanford
faculty members arrive with each
student group.
Courses are selected from the
regular curriculum, normally fit
ting in with the country of resi
dence. Intensive language study
is included in the study list.
Lectures by Europeans and or
ganized and independent field
trips make the overseas sessions
particularly enriching. Classroom
work is concentrated into four
days to allow long weekends for
personal excu rs ion s.
Tuition, room and board and
book fees are the same as here,
with the school providing trans
portation to Europe and students
finding their own way back.
I,EASED FROM the French
Ministry of Education, the Tours
building is located on the banks
of the Loire River, 145 miles from
Paris. Nearby buildings in the
Cultural Center being developed
by Tours and the University of
Poitiers house the Institute of
Fine Arts and the municipal li
brary.
Stanford students will eat one
meal a day with the French stu
dents.
