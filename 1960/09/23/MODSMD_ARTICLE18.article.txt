NEW YORK (UPI) — Soviet
Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev
said yesterday that he considered
President Eisenhower's address
before the United Nations as
"conciliatory."
Khrushchev made the state
ment while answering questions
by Henry Shapiro, UPI Moscow
correspondent, at a reception in
the Hotel Plaza given by the Togo
Republic.
"The President must have been
ashamed of the U-2 incident since
he did not mention it," Khrush
chev' said. "He only saw fit to
mention the RB--17."
THE State Department relented
last night and gave the Soviet '
Premier permission 10 go to the
Russian estate at Glen Cove,!
Long Island, N.Y., for the week'
end.
Last week the department an
nounced that the Russian leader
would be restricted to Manhattan
Island while he is in the United
States to attend the United Na
tions General Assembly meeting.
Khrushchev has said he felt like
he was in prison.
In his address earlier yester
day, Eisenhower denounced Rus
sia for shooting down the Ameri
can RB-47 plane over interna-1
tional waters.
Khrushchev was asked what he I
thought was affirmative in the!
speech given by Eisenhower.
.."Its concialiatory tone," he re-|
plied.
IN REFERENCE to Eisenhow
er's African proposals, Khrush-j
chev said that "I saw nothing new ]
in them."
Khrushchev earlier exchanged -
boos with residents of the Plaza I

one of the most staid and fashion
able hotels in the United States.
LAST NIGHT'S reception and
the give-and-take between the ro
tund leader of world communism
and dignified Plaza residents oc
curred after a day in which
Khrushchev made his third Park
Avenue balcony appearance in 21
hours and then went to the Unit
ed Nations where he sat stonily
through Eisenhower's speech and
chatted amiably with his old foe,
Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia.
Khrushchev apparently was
nettled when he arriyed ut the
Plaza overlooking Central Park,
and was roundly booed and hec
kled by thousands gathered out
