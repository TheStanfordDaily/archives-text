# U.S., Russians Head for U.N. Clash on China
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (UPI)
The United States and Russia
headed last night into their first
major clash of the "heads of gov
ernment" United Nations General
Assembly session on the question
of a seat for Red China.
Despite President Eisenhower's
deliberately low-keyed and propa
ganda-free address to the Assem
bly yesterday morning, the start
of the East-West word battle
seemed inevitable in the 21-mem
ber general, or steering, commit
tee which assembled yesterday
afternoon.
IN PAST YEARS India has
raised the proposal that Commu
nist China be admitted to U.N.
membership. But this year, Rus
sia will bring up the question.
While India is at odds with Pei
ping in a border dispute, it is ex
pected to argue for Red Chinese
admission.
The United States has success
fully prevented membership for
Peiping in votes that have had
steadily dwindling margins over
the years.
The Red bloc sees a chance to
turn the tide with the admission
of 14 new members, 13 of them
African states where Red China
has been assiduously wooing new
government leaders.
The Soviet proposed bringing
in Red China and ousting the Na
tionalist Chinese.
A MINOR CONFLICT on dis
armament arose after the com
mittee. which approves items for
Assembly debate and assigns
them to standing committees for
preliminary debate, had routinely
disposed of a number of U.N.
"housekeeping" items.
U. S. Ambassador James J.
Wadsworth suggested lumping
together under one head the over
all disarmament question, suspen
sion of nuclear weapons tests and
Ireland's proposal to limit the
spread of atomic arms to nations
which now possess them.
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister
Valerian A. Zorin opposed the
proposal and said it would lead to
"endless debates" which would
make it impossible to move closer
to solution of this question.
Coming up today is Soviet Pre
mier Nikita S. Khrushchev's ma
jor address to the Assembly and
it is expected to be on the "ques
tion of questions," disarmament.
WADSWOKTII agreed with Zo
rin that the United States did not
want ceaseless debates and sug
gested that the question of dis
cussing disarmament fields sepa
rately or in an over-all group
should be left to the Assembly's
96-nation Political Committee.
The reaction to the President's
five-point program and his call
for a world aid program through
the United Nations for emerging
African states was cut and dried
along ideological lines. Only in
dependent-minded Wladyslaw Go
mulka of Poland reserved deci
sion in the Communist bloc.
Sylvanus Olympio, prime min
ister of the new African Togolese
Republic, was ecstatic. "It was
wonderful, simply wonderful," lie
said of the Eisenhowci proposal
of help to Africa.
A high Russian official said
there was "nothing new" in the
Eisenhower policy speech. "Old
stuff," said another Russian.
Khrushchev stared solidly
ahead as Eisenhower delivered
the address. None of the Russians
applauded the speech, although
President Tito of Yugoslavia, sit
ting directly behind them, ap
plauded briefly.
