# Tribe Bent on Vengeance Against Wisconsin
## 
### RON RAPOPORT Sports editor 
Somebody once told Whitlow Wyatt, a groat curveball pitcher,
that tho curve was a mere optical illusion. "Mister," Wyatt replied,
you go stand behind a tree 60 feet away and 1 will whomp you to
death with an optical illusion."
It Stanford whomps Wisconsin to death in the Stadium tomorrow,

il may very well be dune with
will look, to most Indian parti
sans, like an optical illusion;
namely a ground game and de
fense. Those used to seeing Stan
ford teams pass will just have to
get used to it.
WITNESS poor Jack Curtice, a
coach who dearly loves to see his
quarterbacks throw the ball. He
has in his possession only the best
passing quarterback in college
football today. Dick Norman, but
Cactus has hardly anybody who
can hold on to a passed pigskin.
To be sure. Skip Face has sticky
fingers and so does Mac Wylie.
But Skip is a fullback and how
many passes can you throw to a
fullback in the course of the
game? And Wylie is a halfback
and besides he's out of the lineup
with a wracked toe. Mac will be
suited up tomorrow, but his
chances of playing are slim.
So without discounting the pos
sibility that the nation's top quar
terback may throw to his back
field. and here and there an end,
Stanford will present its optical
illusion tomorrow with the hope
that il will leaf I to the first win '»1
a still young season.
KVKN though Wisconsin is the
defending Big Ten champion, the
Badgers don't figure to provide
the stifl'est of competition. They
lost 17 lettermen because of di
plomas and have only nine letter
winners returning. Of these nine
only four were regulars, so Coach
Milt Bruhn is not expecting any
bowl bids this year.
Fully six sophomores have
cracked the starting Badger line
up; both ends, the quarterback,
both halfbacks and the left
guard. The two of these who seem
as though they bear some at
tention are the right end Hugh
Richter and the quarterback Ron
Miller.
Richter is labeled by Wisconsin
end coach Paul Shaw as one of
the top prospects to grace the
Badger camp in years.
MILLER IS a longer story. He
entered Wisconsin several years
ago as one of the most highly
sought after preps in the country.
He was waylaid by a serious in
jury, however, dropped out of
school and joined the service.
Now he appears ready, however,
and should he live up to what was
once his potential he could pro
vide problems for the Tribe.

In the backfield the Badgers
have only two important return
ees, .Jim Bakken, a quarterback
whom Miller has moved out of the
top spot, and fullback Tom
Wiesner.
lIOI'EFFLLY, then, the Indians
can take advantage of the Badg
ers' inexperience and repeat the
successful maneuvers of last Sat
urday's ill-fated Washington State
game, while correcting the mis
takes of that contest.
The running game that the
Tribe unveiled in Spokane was a
good one and almost won for
them. Stanford took advantage of
two breaks and scored early with
out the benefit of a long pass or
even of very many short ones.
The first break came halfway
through the first quarter when
the Cougar's Keith Lincoln stood
back on the,"50 yard line to punt.
The ball was hiked about half a
mile over his head and Stanford
got Hie ball on WSU's 2fl. Five
plays later Norman hit Face on
ihe right flank and Skip stepped
into the end /one.
TIJi: SECOND break occured
in the second period when Gary
Craig, a sophomore whom you
should keep your eye on by the
way. punted for ihe Indians and
watched in glee as tho ball rolled
dead on the Cougar's one.
The defense held, Washington
Stale got precisely nowhere on
two plays, Keith Lincoln kicked
ihe ball all of 51 yards, Craig ran
it back beautifully and Stanford
had the ball on WSC's 24.
In nine plays NONE of which
were passes, the Indians scored
and were leading by two whole
touchdowns. Norman threw one
more pass in the half and it was
not until about 15 playing min
utes later that he threw another
one.
TIME AFTER time when the
Cards had the ball. Face, Cii 1
Dowd, Archie Schmitt or even
Norman himself would run
around the end, over- the guard,
through the middle. The Indians
were playing ball control! And
for a quarter- and a half they
pulled it off.
Then the roof fell in. In 87 sec
onds the Cougars completed a •17-
yard pass to set up one touch
flown, then intercepted a Norman
aerial for another one. One of the
extra points was run and the Cou

| gars led 15-14.
The Tribe thundered back and
j got in position for Face the man
was everywhere- to try a field
goal from the 37. Skiuhad the dis
tance but the boot wmwlde.
THE INDIANS gdpthe ball by
making WSU punt on their first
set of downs and took over at mid
field. Norman pitched out to Face,
good for 12. Norman pitched out
to Face, lost three. Norman jump
passed to Face, good for five.
Norman jumped passed 1o Face,
good for 11. Stanford first down
on Washington State 25. Less
than two minutes to go.
Here you had it. Behind by one.
plenty close for Face to make a
field goal. But it was only first
down. Why not get a little closer
: to make dead sure? Throw an
i other jump pass. They won't be
| watching for it after it's been
I used twice in a row and it's a
! sure thing for seven or eight
' yards.
So Norman threw a jump pass,
| but a tackle named Bob Hoien
I WAS watching for it. He inter
cepted and the Indians were dead.
STANFORD HAD shown the
best running game and the best
defense they only gave the Cou
gars one touchdown if you don't
count an interception since Jack
Curtice's reign began.
The Cougars had been held
to 08 yards on the ground while
the Tribe rolled up 175. The whole
defensive team made tackling
look positively easy and a junior
guard named John Butler was a
tiger when it came to knocking
. down the man who had the ball.
If Norman. Face. Hinshaw,
| Pur sell, Butler and company are
up to last week's standard, and if
maybe someone can he found who
can hold on to Norman's passes,
the Wisconsins will find il tough
! sledding tomorrow.

TIME AFTER time when the
Cards had the ball. Face, Cii 1
Dowd, Archie Schmitt or even
Norman himself would run
around the end, over- the guard,
through the middle. The Indians
were playing ball control! And
for a quarter- and a half they
pulled it off.
Then the roof fell in. In 87 sec
onds the Cougars completed a •17-
yard pass to set up one touch
flown, then intercepted a Norman
aerial for another one. One of the
extra points was run and the Cou

The Tribe thundered back and
j got in position for Face the man
was everywhere- to try a field
goal from the 37. Skiuhad the dis

THE INDIANS gdpthe ball by
making WSU punt on their first
set of downs and took over at mid
field. Norman pitched out to Face,
good for 12. Norman pitched out
to Face, lost three. Norman jump
passed to Face, good for five.
Norman jumped passed 1o Face,
good for 11. Stanford first down
on Washington State 25. Less
than two minutes to go.
Here you had it. Behind by one.
plenty close for Face to make a
field goal. But it was only first
down. Why not get a little closer
: to make dead sure? Throw an
i other jump pass. They won't be

I used twice in a row and it's a
! sure thing for seven or eight
' yards.
So Norman threw a jump pass,
| but a tackle named Bob Hoien
I WAS watching for it. He inter
cepted and the Indians were dead.
STANFORD HAD shown the
best running game and the best
defense they only gave the Cou
gars one touchdown if you don't
count an interception since Jack
Curtice's reign began.
The Cougars had been held
to 08 yards on the ground while
the Tribe rolled up 175. The whole
defensive team made tackling
look positively easy and a junior
guard named John Butler was a
tiger when it came to knocking
. down the man who had the ball.
If Norman. Face. Hinshaw,
| Pur sell, Butler and company are
up to last week's standard, and if
maybe someone can he found who
can hold on to Norman's passes,
the Wisconsins will find il tough
! sledding tomorrow.


STANFORD CO CAPT S DICK NORMAN, DEAN HINSHAW
Quarterback and tackle lead Cards
Somebody once told Whitlow Wyatt, a groat curveball pitcher,
that tho curve was a mere optical illusion. "Mister," Wyatt replied,
you go stand behind a tree 60 feet away and 1 will whomp you to
death with an optical illusion."
It Stanford whomps Wisconsin to death in the Stadium tomorrow,

il may very well be dune with
will look, to most Indian parti
sans, like an optical illusion;
namely a ground game and de
fense. Those used to seeing Stan
ford teams pass will just have to
get used to it.
WITNESS poor Jack Curtice, a
coach who dearly loves to see his
quarterbacks throw the ball. He
has in his possession only the best
passing quarterback in college
football today. Dick Norman, but
Cactus has hardly anybody who
can hold on to a passed pigskin.
To be sure. Skip Face has sticky
fingers and so does Mac Wylie.
But Skip is a fullback and how
many passes can you throw to a
fullback in the course of the
game? And Wylie is a halfback
and besides he's out of the lineup
with a wracked toe. Mac will be
suited up tomorrow, but his
chances of playing are slim.
So without discounting the pos
sibility that the nation's top quar
terback may throw to his back
field. and here and there an end,
Stanford will present its optical
illusion tomorrow with the hope
that il will leaf I to the first win '»1
a still young season.
KVKN though Wisconsin is the
defending Big Ten champion, the
Badgers don't figure to provide
the stifl'est of competition. They
lost 17 lettermen because of di
plomas and have only nine letter
winners returning. Of these nine
only four were regulars, so Coach
Milt Bruhn is not expecting any
bowl bids this year.
Fully six sophomores have
cracked the starting Badger line
up; both ends, the quarterback,
both halfbacks and the left
guard. The two of these who seem
as though they bear some at
tention are the right end Hugh
Richter and the quarterback Ron
Miller.
Richter is labeled by Wisconsin
end coach Paul Shaw as one of
the top prospects to grace the
Badger camp in years.
MILLER IS a longer story. He
entered Wisconsin several years
ago as one of the most highly
sought after preps in the country.
He was waylaid by a serious in
jury, however, dropped out of
school and joined the service.
Now he appears ready, however,
and should he live up to what was
once his potential he could pro
vide problems for the Tribe.

In the backfield the Badgers
have only two important return
ees, .Jim Bakken, a quarterback
whom Miller has moved out of the
top spot, and fullback Tom
Wiesner.
lIOI'EFFLLY, then, the Indians
can take advantage of the Badg
ers' inexperience and repeat the
successful maneuvers of last Sat
urday's ill-fated Washington State
game, while correcting the mis
takes of that contest.
The running game that the
Tribe unveiled in Spokane was a
good one and almost won for
them. Stanford took advantage of
two breaks and scored early with
out the benefit of a long pass or
even of very many short ones.
The first break came halfway
through the first quarter when
the Cougar's Keith Lincoln stood
back on the,"50 yard line to punt.
The ball was hiked about half a
mile over his head and Stanford
got Hie ball on WSU's 2fl. Five
plays later Norman hit Face on
ihe right flank and Skip stepped
into the end /one.
TIJi: SECOND break occured
in the second period when Gary
Craig, a sophomore whom you
should keep your eye on by the
way. punted for ihe Indians and
watched in glee as tho ball rolled
dead on the Cougar's one.
The defense held, Washington
Stale got precisely nowhere on
two plays, Keith Lincoln kicked
ihe ball all of 51 yards, Craig ran
it back beautifully and Stanford
had the ball on WSC's 24.
In nine plays NONE of which
were passes, the Indians scored
and were leading by two whole
touchdowns. Norman threw one
more pass in the half and it was
not until about 15 playing min

winners returning. Of these nine
only four were regulars, so Coach
Milt Bruhn is not expecting any
bowl bids this year.
Fully six sophomores have
cracked the starting Badger line
up; both ends, the quarterback,
both halfbacks and the left
guard. The two of these who seem
as though they bear some at
tention are the right end Hugh
Richter and the quarterback Ron
Miller.
Richter is labeled by Wisconsin
end coach Paul Shaw as one of
the top prospects to grace the
Badger camp in years.
MILLER IS a longer story. He
entered Wisconsin several years
ago as one of the most highly
sought after preps in the country.
He was waylaid by a serious in
jury, however, dropped out of
school and joined the service.
Now he appears ready, however,
and should he live up to what was
once his potential he could pro
vide problems for the Tribe.

In the backfield the Badgers
have only two important return
ees, .Jim Bakken, a quarterback
whom Miller has moved out of the
top spot, and fullback Tom
Wiesner.
lIOI'EFFLLY, then, the Indians
can take advantage of the Badg
ers' inexperience and repeat the
successful maneuvers of last Sat
urday's ill-fated Washington State
game, while correcting the mis
takes of that contest.
The running game that the
Tribe unveiled in Spokane was a
good one and almost won for
them. Stanford took advantage of
two breaks and scored early with
out the benefit of a long pass or
even of very many short ones.
The first break came halfway
through the first quarter when
the Cougar's Keith Lincoln stood
back on the,"50 yard line to punt.
The ball was hiked about half a
mile over his head and Stanford
got Hie ball on WSU's 2fl. Five
plays later Norman hit Face on
ihe right flank and Skip stepped
into the end /one.
TIJi: SECOND break occured
in the second period when Gary
Craig, a sophomore whom you
should keep your eye on by the
way. punted for ihe Indians and
watched in glee as tho ball rolled
dead on the Cougar's one.
The defense held, Washington
Stale got precisely nowhere on
two plays, Keith Lincoln kicked
ihe ball all of 51 yards, Craig ran
it back beautifully and Stanford
had the ball on WSC's 24.
In nine plays NONE of which
were passes, the Indians scored
and were leading by two whole
touchdowns. Norman threw one
more pass in the half and it was
not until about 15 playing min
utes later that he threw another
one.
TIME AFTER time when the
Cards had the ball. Face, Cii 1
Dowd, Archie Schmitt or even
Norman himself would run
around the end, over- the guard,
through the middle. The Indians
were playing ball control! And
for a quarter- and a half they
pulled it off.
Then the roof fell in. In 87 sec
onds the Cougars completed a •17-
yard pass to set up one touch
flown, then intercepted a Norman
aerial for another one. One of the
extra points was run and the Cou

| gars led 15-14.
The Tribe thundered back and
j got in position for Face the man
was everywhere- to try a field
goal from the 37. Skiuhad the dis
tance but the boot wmwlde.
THE INDIANS gdpthe ball by
making WSU punt on their first
set of downs and took over at mid
field. Norman pitched out to Face,
good for 12. Norman pitched out
to Face, lost three. Norman jump
passed to Face, good for five.
Norman jumped passed 1o Face,
good for 11. Stanford first down
on Washington State 25. Less
than two minutes to go.
Here you had it. Behind by one.
plenty close for Face to make a
field goal. But it was only first
down. Why not get a little closer
: to make dead sure? Throw an
i other jump pass. They won't be
| watching for it after it's been
I used twice in a row and it's a
! sure thing for seven or eight
' yards.
So Norman threw a jump pass,
| but a tackle named Bob Hoien
I WAS watching for it. He inter
cepted and the Indians were dead.
STANFORD HAD shown the
best running game and the best
defense they only gave the Cou
gars one touchdown if you don't
count an interception since Jack
Curtice's reign began.
The Cougars had been held
to 08 yards on the ground while
the Tribe rolled up 175. The whole
defensive team made tackling
look positively easy and a junior
guard named John Butler was a
tiger when it came to knocking
. down the man who had the ball.
If Norman. Face. Hinshaw,
| Pur sell, Butler and company are
up to last week's standard, and if
maybe someone can he found who
can hold on to Norman's passes,
the Wisconsins will find il tough
! sledding tomorrow.

Somebody once told Whitlow Wyatt, a groat curveball pitcher,

WITNESS poor Jack Curtice, a
coach who dearly loves to see his
quarterbacks throw the ball. He
has in his possession only the best
passing quarterback in college
football today. Dick Norman, but
Cactus has hardly anybody who
can hold on to a passed pigskin.
To be sure. Skip Face has sticky
fingers and so does Mac Wylie.
But Skip is a fullback and how
many passes can you throw to a
fullback in the course of the
game? And Wylie is a halfback
and besides he's out of the lineup
with a wracked toe. Mac will be

So without discounting the pos

| but a tackle named Bob Hoien
I WAS watching for it. He inter
cepted and the Indians were dead.
STANFORD HAD shown the
best running game and the best
defense they only gave the Cou
gars one touchdown if you don't
count an interception since Jack
Curtice's reign began.
The Cougars had been held
to 08 yards on the ground while
the Tribe rolled up 175. The whole
defensive team made tackling
look positively easy and a junior
guard named John Butler was a
tiger when it came to knocking
. down the man who had the ball.
If Norman. Face. Hinshaw,
| Pur sell, Butler and company are
up to last week's standard, and if
maybe someone can he found who
can hold on to Norman's passes,
the Wisconsins will find il tough
! sledding tomorrow.

Somebody once told Whitlow Wyatt, a groat curveball pitcher,
that tho curve was a mere optical illusion. "Mister," Wyatt replied,
you go stand behind a tree 60 feet away and 1 will whomp you to
death with an optical illusion."
It Stanford whomps Wisconsin to death in the Stadium tomorrow,

il may very well be dune with
will look, to most Indian parti
sans, like an optical illusion;
namely a ground game and de
fense. Those used to seeing Stan
ford teams pass will just have to
get used to it.
WITNESS poor Jack Curtice, a
coach who dearly loves to see his
quarterbacks throw the ball. He
has in his possession only the best
passing quarterback in college
football today. Dick Norman, but
Cactus has hardly anybody who
can hold on to a passed pigskin.
To be sure. Skip Face has sticky
fingers and so does Mac Wylie.
But Skip is a fullback and how
many passes can you throw to a
fullback in the course of the
game? And Wylie is a halfback
and besides he's out of the lineup
with a wracked toe. Mac will be
suited up tomorrow, but his
chances of playing are slim.
So without discounting the pos
sibility that the nation's top quar
terback may throw to his back
field. and here and there an end,
Stanford will present its optical
illusion tomorrow with the hope
that il will leaf I to the first win '»1
a still young season.
KVKN though Wisconsin is the
defending Big Ten champion, the
Badgers don't figure to provide
the stifl'est of competition. They
lost 17 lettermen because of di
plomas and have only nine letter
winners returning. Of these nine
only four were regulars, so Coach
Milt Bruhn is not expecting any
bowl bids this year.
Fully six sophomores have
cracked the starting Badger line
up; both ends, the quarterback,
both halfbacks and the left
guard. The two of these who seem
as though they bear some at
tention are the right end Hugh
Richter and the quarterback Ron
Miller.
Richter is labeled by Wisconsin
end coach Paul Shaw as one of
the top prospects to grace the
Badger camp in years.
MILLER IS a longer story. He
entered Wisconsin several years
ago as one of the most highly
sought after preps in the country.
He was waylaid by a serious in
jury, however, dropped out of
school and joined the service.
Now he appears ready, however,
and should he live up to what was
once his potential he could pro
vide problems for the Tribe.

In the backfield the Badgers
have only two important return
ees, .Jim Bakken, a quarterback
whom Miller has moved out of the
top spot, and fullback Tom
Wiesner.
lIOI'EFFLLY, then, the Indians
can take advantage of the Badg
ers' inexperience and repeat the
successful maneuvers of last Sat
urday's ill-fated Washington State
game, while correcting the mis
takes of that contest.
The running game that the
Tribe unveiled in Spokane was a
good one and almost won for
them. Stanford took advantage of
two breaks and scored early with
out the benefit of a long pass or
even of very many short ones.
The first break came halfway
through the first quarter when
the Cougar's Keith Lincoln stood
back on the,"50 yard line to punt.
The ball was hiked about half a
mile over his head and Stanford
got Hie ball on WSU's 2fl. Five
plays later Norman hit Face on
ihe right flank and Skip stepped
into the end /one.
TIJi: SECOND break occured
in the second period when Gary
Craig, a sophomore whom you
should keep your eye on by the
way. punted for ihe Indians and
watched in glee as tho ball rolled
dead on the Cougar's one.
The defense held, Washington
Stale got precisely nowhere on
two plays, Keith Lincoln kicked
ihe ball all of 51 yards, Craig ran
it back beautifully and Stanford
had the ball on WSC's 24.
In nine plays NONE of which
were passes, the Indians scored
and were leading by two whole
touchdowns. Norman threw one
more pass in the half and it was
not until about 15 playing min
utes later that he threw another
one.
TIME AFTER time when the
Cards had the ball. Face, Cii 1
Dowd, Archie Schmitt or even
Norman himself would run
around the end, over- the guard,
through the middle. The Indians
were playing ball control! And
for a quarter- and a half they
pulled it off.
Then the roof fell in. In 87 sec
onds the Cougars completed a •17-
yard pass to set up one touch
flown, then intercepted a Norman
aerial for another one. One of the
extra points was run and the Cou

| gars led 15-14.
The Tribe thundered back and
j got in position for Face the man
was everywhere- to try a field
goal from the 37. Skiuhad the dis
tance but the boot wmwlde.
THE INDIANS gdpthe ball by
making WSU punt on their first
set of downs and took over at mid
field. Norman pitched out to Face,
good for 12. Norman pitched out
to Face, lost three. Norman jump
passed to Face, good for five.
Norman jumped passed 1o Face,
good for 11. Stanford first down
on Washington State 25. Less
than two minutes to go.
Here you had it. Behind by one.
plenty close for Face to make a
field goal. But it was only first
down. Why not get a little closer
: to make dead sure? Throw an
i other jump pass. They won't be

I used twice in a row and it's a

' yards.
