Congratulations are in order to
Sports Illustraled and their diag
nosticians of college football
teams. In their football issue of
I Sept. 19, ran a picture of Indian
| halfback Rick McMillen and came
to this conclusion about Stan
ford's football chances;
"Three men do no! make a line,
nor do touchdowns alone make a
victory. Any games ihe Indians
win will be glorious upsets."
Since McMillen graduated from
Stanford last year and therefore
will see limited action, we can
only hope that their information
about Stanford's chances is as
faulty as their informal ion about
the Tribe's personnel.
