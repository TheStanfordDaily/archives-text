To the class of '61 (making about the third "open letter" you've
read today):
After having been herded around these hallowed halls for nearly
two days now you are probably getting some sort of an idea as to the
amount of tradition thai there is connected with the Fa m. For in
stance. if you were lucky enough to get someone who knew his busi
ness to guide you around campus, you probably got an earful about
the exploits of the legendary Doodles Weaver.
I iidouhtedly, you have by now been informed as to the signifi
cance ol the circle in front of the church in inner quad, and how its
importance to the morale of Stanford's senior males increases in re
lationship to the amount of moon that there is to be seen. Tradition?
The place reeks with it
And without question the greatest single contributor to Stanford
tradition and legend is athletics. Not only men and events that belong

to the past and there were many
great ones in both of those cate
gories but happenings that will
occur during your own school
career are part of the Stanford
athletic tradition.
When Big (lame time rolls
around in November your reac
tion will be the same as the re
action of every freshman class he
fore you; it will be one of disbe
lief. Roth the Stanford and Cal
campuses, and the million or so
people in between them, will go
just a little bit mad.
If neither the Indians nor the
Golden Bears wins a single game
ail season, if neither team could
generate an offense against Bryn
Mawi', if Jack Curtice and Marv
Levy die in mid season of humili
ation; on ihe 1!) of November 80,-
i)i)H people will crowd into Cal's
Memorial Stadium to see Cal and

Stanford do battle, and the Stanford, California and San Francisco
press will make you think that the prize for winning the game is the
right to guillioline the losers. .
To Build a Bonfire
As freshmen you will spend much of Bitf Game Week building an
SO or 90 tool wooden structure the only purpose of which is to h:irn
to the ground the night before the game. That's Big (.ante and when
it conies you slili won't believe it.
A little bit more of the contemporary sort of Tribe legend has
been in the making in the last few years. When ihe Indians lost last
week's football game to Washington State by a point, Stanford
sports publicity director Don Liebendorfer whipped out a pencil and
decided that oui of the 21 games that Stanford lias played under
Jack Curtice, seven have been lost by a total of 12 points.
Last year the Cards were racking up so many "moral" victories
that many fans were beginning to wonder if they'd ever see any of
the real kind. Coming within two points of one of the eventual Rose
Bowl participants, and within 10 points of the team that won that
classic by over 30, and then making it to only two points away from
the fearsome University of Southern McKeever; now that's the
stuff of which moral victories are made.
These Were the Great Ortes
As for the name-dropping end of Stanford tradition, well, there
were footballers like Krnie N'evers, Bobby Grayson, Norm Slandlee,
< buck Taylor, John Brodie, Bill MeC'oll, Bob (Jarrett, Gary Kcrkorian,
Paul Wiggin, Chris Burford, and on and on. In basketball the list
starts with only the greatest one ever to pull on a pair of shoes, llank
I.uisetti, and continues with the likes of George Yardley and Jim
Pollard. Bnh Vlathias, Ben ICa.stman, Gay Bryan, Dink Templeton
and Krnie Cunliffe in track, Ted Sehroeder in tennis, I.aw son Little
in golf. The list grows and grows until it is positively awesome.
Coaches like Pop Warner, Clark Shaughnessy, Frankie Albert and
Marchie Schwartz have meant a lot to the Stanford tradition too
and have helped to make it even more diversified.
At any rate, that's the Stanford athletic tradition and whether
the Indians win or lose, they'll be producing some of the most ex
citing collegiate sport around.


JACK CURTICE
Lost seven by twelve
