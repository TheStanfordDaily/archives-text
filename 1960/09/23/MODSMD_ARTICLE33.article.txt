# AAWU Football Action Enters Second Week
## 
### 
A probable win, a probable 10-ss I
and a couple of toss-ups seem to |
b(> the order of the day as the in- I
dividual members of the AAWU I
swing into their second week of |
football action.
Washington should m u r d e r
hapless Idaho as they play host
to the Vandal-; ;il Washington. Cal
seems likely 1o lake it on the chin
in South Bend this weekend from
Notre Dame. And hardly any
body seems willing to bet his shirt
on the SC-Texas Christian game
or the UCLA-Purdue tussle.
TIIIO WOliI) from Washington
is that when the Huskies beat
Idaho they will have set their
longest win streak in 37 years,
eight in a row. Washington took
care of an out-classed College of
the Pacific team to the tunc of
55-fi last Saturday, while Idaho
bowed to a tough Oregon State
squad, 33-0. Huskie Coach Jim
Owens will have his team pretty
much unhampered by injuries
and. as if that weren't enough,
Idaho must go into the contest
knowing that it hasn't beaten
Washington since 1905.
After their miserable showing
against a so-so Tulane team, no
one is figuring Cal to beat Notre
Dame at South Bend this weekend.
This is Notre Dame's opener and
it should be a successful one, pro
viding the Irish have any kind of
a team at all. After this one Cal
faces Army, the prospect of which
is probably not exactly cheering
up Marv I.evy in this his initial
year at the helm of the Golden!
Hears.
U.C.L.A. WILL travel to Lafay
ette. Ind., to provide Purdue with
■ its season opener Saturday.
The Boilermakers' stout de
fense could give Bruin tailbacks
Bill Kilmer and K/.ell Singleton :
some trouble, but the Uclans have |
proven themselves a tough squad j
after dumping highly-touted Pitt !
8-7 last Saturday.
Down in Los Angeles Southern
Cal will be trying to make up for i
its 1 1-0 upset beating last week at
the hands of ()iegon. The Trojans !
v ill take on Texas Christian, also
the victim of upset football last
weekend by Kansas. SC is rated

the slight favorite and Coach
John McKay has done some line
up shaking to see what he can do
about insuring a Trojan victory.

Idaho they will have set their
longest win streak in 37 years,
eight in a row. Washington took
care of an out-classed College of
the Pacific team to the tunc of
55-fi last Saturday, while Idaho
bowed to a tough Oregon State
squad, 33-0. Huskie Coach Jim
Owens will have his team pretty

Washington since 1905.
After their miserable showing
against a so-so Tulane team, no

This is Notre Dame's opener and
it should be a successful one, pro
