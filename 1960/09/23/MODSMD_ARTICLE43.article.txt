# EDUCATION'S THREE LEVELS
## National Purpose Is Leadership Without Rulingâ€”Rhinelander 
### ROSS HERMANN 
Philip 11. Rhinelander, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, in an
address to the l'reshman class yes
terday, posed the question of
what should be America's na
tional purpose and ventured his
own thought fid conclusions.
Our national purpose, lie said,
should be world leadership with
out domination. "We must guide
without ruling."
HE DESC RIHKI) this purpose
as a logical extension of the prin
ciples of liberal education in an
effort to show the importance of
an educational system in charting
the course of a society. America's
tradition of free thought and free
expression in the process of edu
cation leads to such a national
purpose.
The Soviet Union, on the other
hand, with an educational system
bound by ideology and strict
dogma, is imbued with the pur
pose of world domination by any
possible means. It is this strict
ness that has given rise to clarity

and seriousness of purpose and
the discipline vital to promoting
it, lie believes.
Rhinelander described the ideo
logical and spiritual battleground
as perhaps the most important of
the three levels on which Amer
ica is being challenged by Com
munism the fronts of physical
force, economic and political force,
and ideological force.
AS FKKSII.MKN beginning col
lege experience, the students were
urged by Rhinelander to consider
where this country is heading and
what eventual decisions must be
made. Such decisions should not
l)o made quickly, and he urged
that the new students learn to dis
tinguish between the urgent and
the essential issues.
In line with the principles of
free thought and expression, the
freshmen were told that they are
not here to be indoctrinated but to
develop their natural capacities of
mind and spirit. The responsibil
ity for acquiring an education is
on the student, not the faculty
members.
Rhinelander outlined three basic
levels of education through which
the student should progress.
It The student learns what he
is taught basic information that
can be accepted with little dis
cussion or argument.
21 The student progresses to
the point where he can be stimu
lated to do his own thinking.
3) The final level, and the ob
jective of the university, is at
tained when the student can en
gage in self education. This habit
should be developed before the
end of four years.
EDUCATION was defined as the
attitudes that are left once all
learned information has been for
gotten. These attitudes are intel
lectual curiosity, the capacity for
learning, and intellectual humil
ity (or tolerance of the views of
others and recognition of the fact
that there is always more to
learn >.
He posed the question, too, of
what sacrifices we are willing to
undergo in support of our be
liefs to combat the zeal of ad
herents to the Soviet system.
The difference between the
American and Soviet systems is
that universities in this country
offer a liberal education over and
above the acquisition of technical
skills.
The freedom embodied in lib
eral education, he said, is only of
value if the student knows how to
use it. There must be disciplined,
ordered pursuit of a freely chosen
course.
He stressed that all university
activities must have an academic
focus in order that the intellec
tual and social realms will blend.

mind and spirit. The responsibil
ity for acquiring an education is
on the student, not the faculty
members.
Rhinelander outlined three basic
levels of education through which
the student should progress.
It The student learns what he
is taught basic information that
can be accepted with little dis
cussion or argument.
21 The student progresses to
the point where he can be stimu
lated to do his own thinking.
3) The final level, and the ob
jective of the university, is at
tained when the student can en
gage in self education. This habit
should be developed before the
end of four years.
EDUCATION was defined as the
attitudes that are left once all
learned information has been for
gotten. These attitudes are intel
lectual curiosity, the capacity for
learning, and intellectual humil
ity (or tolerance of the views of
others and recognition of the fact
that there is always more to
learn >.
He posed the question, too, of
what sacrifices we are willing to
undergo in support of our be
liefs to combat the zeal of ad
herents to the Soviet system.
The difference between the
American and Soviet systems is
that universities in this country
offer a liberal education over and
above the acquisition of technical
skills.
The freedom embodied in lib
eral education, he said, is only of
value if the student knows how to
use it. There must be disciplined,
ordered pursuit of a freely chosen
course.
He stressed that all university
activities must have an academic
focus in order that the intellec
tual and social realms will blend.
Philip 11. Rhinelander, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, in an
address to the l'reshman class yes
terday, posed the question of
what should be America's na
tional purpose and ventured his
own thought fid conclusions.
Our national purpose, lie said,
should be world leadership with
out domination. "We must guide
without ruling."
HE DESC RIHKI) this purpose
as a logical extension of the prin
ciples of liberal education in an
effort to show the importance of
an educational system in charting
the course of a society. America's
tradition of free thought and free
expression in the process of edu
cation leads to such a national
purpose.
The Soviet Union, on the other
hand, with an educational system
bound by ideology and strict
dogma, is imbued with the pur
pose of world domination by any
possible means. It is this strict
ness that has given rise to clarity

and seriousness of purpose and
the discipline vital to promoting
it, lie believes.
Rhinelander described the ideo
logical and spiritual battleground
as perhaps the most important of
the three levels on which Amer
ica is being challenged by Com
munism the fronts of physical
force, economic and political force,
and ideological force.
AS FKKSII.MKN beginning col
lege experience, the students were
urged by Rhinelander to consider
where this country is heading and
what eventual decisions must be
made. Such decisions should not
l)o made quickly, and he urged
that the new students learn to dis
tinguish between the urgent and
the essential issues.
In line with the principles of
free thought and expression, the
freshmen were told that they are
not here to be indoctrinated but to
develop their natural capacities of
mind and spirit. The responsibil
ity for acquiring an education is
