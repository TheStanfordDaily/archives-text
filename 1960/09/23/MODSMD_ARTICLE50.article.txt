# An Open Letter

Dear Freshmen:
If your tenure at Stanford is spent in the pursuit of nothing
else i >lll high grades, llien you are doing not only a great disserviee
to yourselves hut to your eountry as well.
\\ Â«' all know that United States prestige is eontinuing to dwin
dle, that Russia's prestige continues to improve, and that the fu
tnre of Deinocraev hinges on whether or not we can reverse this
trend.
In order to promote Democracy and to defeat Communism,
much more is needed than Strategic Air Command, a huge stock
pile of missiles and the House I n-Aineriean Activities Committee.
What is urgently needed is a greater understanding of what
Drmocracv reallv is, what are its tenets, what it offers new-horn
nations which Communism does not offer.
Right now, our foreign policy is hypocritical, enigmatic, and
hoprlesk impotent. \\ h\ ? Heeause Americans are no longer sure
of what they stand for. The task of reinserting purpose into our
society falls on students' shoulders.
As students, we have the time to learn what Democracy means
and how to promote its ideals. If we are to once again instill pur
pose into our existence, a concerted effort on the part of every
student, whether he plans to he a statesman, politician, engineer,
physicist, businessman, or housewife, is necessary.
\\ e must remember, however, that Democracy's ideals cannot
be learned purely from hooks, anymore so than can our way of
life he preserved bv simplv reading the Constitution.
In order to understand Democracy we must participate in it.
Participate in some of the myriad activities which e\ist on this
campus. Join student government, or a fraternity, or become a
member of one of the publications.
The complexities and idiosyncrasies of Pemocracv cannot he
learned by simply earning A's in all of your subjects. Good grades,
of course, are important but are not the alpha and omega of uni
versity life.
Good grades are not always indicative of a good education.
Too often, students swallow a huge quantity of knowledge but do
not now know to digest it, therefore giving knowledge little prac
tical purpose.
In the next four years you have an important dutv to perform.
V hen someone asks you what is freedom, you must he capable of
telling him something more elaborate and meaningful than, '"Free
dom is the antithesis of slavery." 1
ou must he capable of telling a person or a nation something
a little more substantial than, "Communism is morallv, ethically,
politically, economically and sociologicallv reprehensible.''' You
must support your belief with facts, not histrionics and vitupera
t ion.
The future of Democracy largely rests with the college students
of \merica. mi are now part of that group. The duty we must
perform is clear.
