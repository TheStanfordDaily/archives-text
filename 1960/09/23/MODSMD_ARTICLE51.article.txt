(Editor's Note: This is the first
in a series of columns to be

John Schwarz is a former Sports
Editor of The Daily and will be

Judy Sklar, who is studying at
Florence, and Sue Wotring, study

Besides putting a squeeze on
the West Berlin population, the
new travel restriction set up by
East Germany also deprives the
\\ est of one o(' its greatest propa
ganda weapons. A comparison
of the two sectors of Germany*
leaves very few people with any
douhts as to which section lias
had the most economic success
since the war.
Most West Germans, for ex
ample. who have seen the East
ern sector of their country, espe
cially East Berlin, have returned
thoroughly disturbed at the sight
and thankful that their homes lay
in the Western sector of the coun
try.
The West German of today is
interested in eradicating all traces
of the war which ended some 15
years ago. He wants to rebuild
lK>th the material structures
which were destroyed during the
lighting and also the foreign
opinion of Germany which took a
severe setback during the Hitler
regime.
In both these departments the
West Germans have been making
a great deal of progress. In Mu
nich, for example, where there
were 72 air raids during the war
and where the whole center of the
city was reduced to the ground, a
new modern city has arisen.
While the Western section of J
Germany has done so much re
building and clearing away of
wartime destruction, the West

German visiting East Berlin finds
almost the same conditions which
prevailed shortly after the war.
Ruins which covered the whole
city of Berlin after the war are
still quite evident in the Eastern
sector of the city. Very little
building has taken place and the
contrast between East and West
Germany is astounding.
The reaction of the German
viewing the documentary film,
Mein Kampf, (the story of the de
velopment of Hitlerism in Ger
many), gives some indication of
how the post war German views
events of the past.
The most horrifying of scenes
from the Jewish extermination
camps are shown on the screen
and very few Germans are able
to utter any words. Strained faces
and horrified expressions can be
seen in almost every seat. Hitler's
I appearance on the screen brings
occasional buzzing and some scof
fing. Very few Germans leave the
theater without showing some
signs of mental strain and emo
tional upset.
When asked about the Neo-
Nazism that got such big writeups
in the newspapers some months
back, most Germans say that it is
merely a very small minority
which got a big boost by foreign
newspaper correspondents.
One German when asked about
this subject compared it to the
Negro segregation problem in the
United States. "The opinions of a
small minority are blown up in
the press to appear as the opinion
of an entire nation."
The zoning of Germany pre
sents a deep problem to the Ger
man. He feels the U.S. committed
' a great error in the war when it
did not continue its drive through
-1 out all of Germany. By leaving
the country divided as the U.S.
did, the Germans feel they were
dealt a deeper wound than even
the material destruction that the
country absorbed.

German visiting East Berlin finds
almost the same conditions which
prevailed shortly after the war.
Ruins which covered the whole
city of Berlin after the war are
still quite evident in the Eastern
sector of the city. Very little
building has taken place and the
contrast between East and West
Germany is astounding.
The reaction of the German
viewing the documentary film,
Mein Kampf, (the story of the de
velopment of Hitlerism in Ger
many), gives some indication of
how the post war German views
events of the past.
The most horrifying of scenes
from the Jewish extermination
camps are shown on the screen
and very few Germans are able
to utter any words. Strained faces
and horrified expressions can be
seen in almost every seat. Hitler's
I appearance on the screen brings
occasional buzzing and some scof
fing. Very few Germans leave the
theater without showing some
signs of mental strain and emo
tional upset.
When asked about the Neo-
Nazism that got such big writeups
in the newspapers some months
back, most Germans say that it is
merely a very small minority
which got a big boost by foreign
newspaper correspondents.
One German when asked about
this subject compared it to the
Negro segregation problem in the
United States. "The opinions of a
small minority are blown up in
the press to appear as the opinion
of an entire nation."
The zoning of Germany pre

did not continue its drive through

the country divided as the U.S.
did, the Germans feel they were
dealt a deeper wound than even
the material destruction that the
country absorbed.
