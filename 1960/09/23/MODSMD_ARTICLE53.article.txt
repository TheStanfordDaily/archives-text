## 
### 
BY BARRY GRKENBERG, Editor
A thin, prominent-looking gen
tleman steps up to the podium
after refusing to be introduced
and says'* to his excited audience:
"I am a very distinguished pro
fessor at Stanford University. If
you want to be impressed look in
Who's Who."
Conceited? An egomaniac? No,
it's just Professor James T. Wat
kins IV of the political science
department, loved by students,
faculty and administrators alike.
Watkins is a perfect example
of why first impressions don't
count. A person first meeting
Watkins would think him austere,
rude, unsympathetic, aloof, com
pletely wrapped tip in himself.
Nothing could be further from
the truth. The only thing he is
wrapped up in is Stanford Uni
versity; its buildings, its land
scape. its greatness, but most of
all, its students.
Robert L. leree, director of
the Alumni association and a
close friend of Watkins. tells a
story of the time when Watkins
was supposed to meet Pierce and
a very important man at. 12
o'clock. Pierce and the guest
were still waiting at 12:30 and
Watkins wasn't even in sight.
Pierce turned to the distin
guished man and said: "1 know
jnst what happened. Watkins fell
his office and started towards us
hut met a student on ({uud who
was having problems. 11<* stopped

to talk to the student, tried to
console liim, went and save lull
to the Dean who was giving tlx*
student a hard time, and right
now he should he coming around
the corner."
Sure enough, Wat kins rounded
the corner at that very moment.
He got into the car where Pierce
and the guest had been waiting
and said: "I was on my way over
here and met a student on Quad
who was having problems. I tried
to console him and then went and
gave hell to the Dean who was
giving him a hard time."
"He's really Ihat predictable,"
says Pierce. "I have never known
a man with so much compassion,
i He always says that "you've got
! to think a little more in this
j stinkin' life than about yourself."
"His one great concern in life
is that he is afraid people are hurt
when he brushes them off so
quickly," Pierce continues. "But
it's not true. It's just that he is
always so preoccupied."
Watkins is one of Stanford's
best salesmen. He met seven stu
dents in Denver a couple of years
ago, all of whom were planning
to attend Ivy League schools.
Watkins spoke to the students for
a few minutes then told them: "I
would rather ear hamburgers at
Stanford than steak at Harvard.
But my wife wouldn't. My wife
is just like Stanford absolutely
perfect with lots of room for im-

I provement." Five of the seven
students came to Stanford.
"Ilis greatest virtue is to make
the ugly duckling think lie is go
ing to turn into a swan," Pierce
I says. "This man has the respect
and admiration of everyone. Ilis
great enthusiasm for anything
lie does is transmitted to his asso
ciates. lie makes everyone
happy."
Although tolerant of almost
i anything or anybody, Watkins
does have his idiosyncrasies. He
has an absolute fetish on gram
mar. He will not hesitate to stop
and correct someone who is mak
ing a speech before a large audi
ence.
He also believes that no one
over forty should be seen wearing
a bathing suit. "Just look at them
and you know why," he says.
Watkins is a graduate of Stan
ford, earning his B.A. in 1929,
M.A. in 1934 and I'h.l). in 1911.
lie taught at the University of
Chicago for a while and also at
Ohio State University, lint, natu
rally, at the first opportunity he
returned to Stanford.
A deeply religious man and a
pacifist, Watkins went through
World War II with an unloaded
gun. "He was in the middle of
some fierce action, too," Pierce
relates.
The above information tells you
a little about the inimitable Pro
fessor Watkins. If you want to
find out more about this fantastic
character and if you have plenty
of nerve, walk up to him some
morning when you see him on
Quad and introduce yourself. You
won't regret it.

it's just Professor James T. Wat
kins IV of the political science
department, loved by students,
faculty and administrators alike.
Watkins is a perfect example
of why first impressions don't
count. A person first meeting
Watkins would think him austere,
rude, unsympathetic, aloof, com
pletely wrapped tip in himself.
Nothing could be further from
the truth. The only thing he is
wrapped up in is Stanford Uni
versity; its buildings, its land
scape. its greatness, but most of
all, its students.
Robert L. leree, director of
the Alumni association and a
close friend of Watkins. tells a
story of the time when Watkins
was supposed to meet Pierce and
a very important man at. 12
o'clock. Pierce and the guest
were still waiting at 12:30 and
Watkins wasn't even in sight.
Pierce turned to the distin
guished man and said: "1 know
jnst what happened. Watkins fell
his office and started towards us
hut met a student on ({uud who
was having problems. 11<* stopped

to talk to the student, tried to
console liim, went and save lull
to the Dean who was giving tlx*
student a hard time, and right
now he should he coming around
the corner."
Sure enough, Wat kins rounded
the corner at that very moment.
He got into the car where Pierce
and the guest had been waiting
and said: "I was on my way over
here and met a student on Quad
who was having problems. I tried
to console him and then went and
gave hell to the Dean who was
giving him a hard time."
"He's really Ihat predictable,"
says Pierce. "I have never known
a man with so much compassion,
i He always says that "you've got
! to think a little more in this
j stinkin' life than about yourself."
"His one great concern in life
is that he is afraid people are hurt
when he brushes them off so
quickly," Pierce continues. "But
it's not true. It's just that he is
always so preoccupied."
Watkins is one of Stanford's
best salesmen. He met seven stu
dents in Denver a couple of years
ago, all of whom were planning
to attend Ivy League schools.
Watkins spoke to the students for
a few minutes then told them: "I
would rather ear hamburgers at
Stanford than steak at Harvard.
But my wife wouldn't. My wife
is just like Stanford absolutely
perfect with lots of room for im-

I provement." Five of the seven
students came to Stanford.
"Ilis greatest virtue is to make
the ugly duckling think lie is go
ing to turn into a swan," Pierce
I says. "This man has the respect
and admiration of everyone. Ilis
great enthusiasm for anything
lie does is transmitted to his asso
ciates. lie makes everyone
happy."
Although tolerant of almost
i anything or anybody, Watkins
does have his idiosyncrasies. He
has an absolute fetish on gram
mar. He will not hesitate to stop
and correct someone who is mak
ing a speech before a large audi
ence.
He also believes that no one
over forty should be seen wearing
a bathing suit. "Just look at them
and you know why," he says.

wrapped up in is Stanford Uni
versity; its buildings, its land
scape. its greatness, but most of
all, its students.
Robert L. leree, director of
the Alumni association and a
close friend of Watkins. tells a
story of the time when Watkins
was supposed to meet Pierce and
a very important man at. 12
o'clock. Pierce and the guest
were still waiting at 12:30 and
Watkins wasn't even in sight.
Pierce turned to the distin
guished man and said: "1 know
jnst what happened. Watkins fell
his office and started towards us

was having problems. 11<* stopped

to talk to the student, tried to
console liim, went and save lull
to the Dean who was giving tlx*
student a hard time, and right
now he should he coming around
the corner."
Sure enough, Wat kins rounded
the corner at that very moment.
He got into the car where Pierce
and the guest had been waiting
and said: "I was on my way over
here and met a student on Quad
who was having problems. I tried
to console him and then went and
gave hell to the Dean who was
giving him a hard time."

says Pierce. "I have never known
a man with so much compassion,

! to think a little more in this
j stinkin' life than about yourself."
"His one great concern in life
is that he is afraid people are hurt
when he brushes them off so
quickly," Pierce continues. "But
it's not true. It's just that he is
always so preoccupied."
Watkins is one of Stanford's
best salesmen. He met seven stu
dents in Denver a couple of years
ago, all of whom were planning
to attend Ivy League schools.
Watkins spoke to the students for
a few minutes then told them: "I
would rather ear hamburgers at
Stanford than steak at Harvard.

is just like Stanford absolutely
perfect with lots of room for im-

students came to Stanford.

BY BARRY GRKENBERG, Editor
A thin, prominent-looking gen
tleman steps up to the podium
after refusing to be introduced
and says'* to his excited audience:
"I am a very distinguished pro
fessor at Stanford University. If
you want to be impressed look in
Who's Who."
Conceited? An egomaniac? No,
it's just Professor James T. Wat
kins IV of the political science
department, loved by students,
faculty and administrators alike.
Watkins is a perfect example
of why first impressions don't
count. A person first meeting
Watkins would think him austere,
rude, unsympathetic, aloof, com
pletely wrapped tip in himself.
Nothing could be further from
the truth. The only thing he is
wrapped up in is Stanford Uni
versity; its buildings, its land
scape. its greatness, but most of
all, its students.
