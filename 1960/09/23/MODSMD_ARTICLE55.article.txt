## Calif. 'Education' 
### 
Millions of California's high
school students boarded tlicit - yel
low buses and headed back lo
classes this month for anolher|
rugged year of football games, i
student council meetings, driving!
cars, pep rallies and when time
permits education.
Nino months from now most
will emerge in the same condition
as when they entered gay, ener
getic and intellectually dormant.)
The deplorable quality of the
state's secondary school instruc
tion is finally getting some long
needed attention, though.
The Citizens Advisory Commis
sion during the summer turned in
a scathing report on the "life ad- i
justment" theory of education
prevalent in this state. It recom
mended abolition of required driv
er and physical education.

The committee]
apparently feels j
the time spent on
these subjects
might be better
utilized in edu
cating the stu
dent, leaving the
parents to ex e r
cise a bit of theirj
res p on si hility
and teach theirl

youngsters the difficult art of
turning the ignition key, stopping
on the gas and twisting the radio
dial.
And it also presumably thinks
that physical activity is something
best left to the individual, a novel
notion in these days.
As the group's report states,
"The school has neither the chief
responsibility nor the means for
dealing with all aspects of per
sonal development . .
While unlikely, it is not incon
ceivable that stndcnts' br;iiim

someday may be stimulated by
writing themes or learning just
where on the map The Congo is,
in place of the trying homo eco
nomics and student government
courses.
It (.lie commission were to have
its way, the high schools would
require four years of English and
four of history for all students. I
A year of world geography and |
one of American history are added
to the required list.
And it's quite possible that the
commission, which was headed by
former University of California
President Robert Sproul, would
also toss out the window a course
called Senior Problems, one of the
most ridiculous courses ever to be
taught in the classroom.
Enacting these suggestions
would, of course, necessitate the
axing of a number of "classes"
now on the report card. Some
how. we think that a close exami
nation of the classes offered at
a typical California high school
would reveal quite a few useless,
pointless, empty courses.
It's up to the state legislature
(o enact the proposals. What ac
tion they take, and the reaction of
the citizens of California to such
action, should provide an illmiii- j
nating: commentary on how the
eon temporary < alifornian regards
his most important asset and re
sponsibilityâ€”his educational sys
tem.
If he values il highly enough,
the day may come when the odor
of burnt toast from the home ec
room, screech of tires from the
driver ed car and echo of student
council voices debating the pom- j
pon budget have faded away, re
placed by the sounds-and si- I
iences- of students gaining a true
cd ucation.
