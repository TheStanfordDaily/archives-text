## Stranger President 
### 
Candidates Kennedy and Nixon
have been campaigning for two
months and only one aspect of
the forthcoming election has
clearly emerged; neither candi
date seems prepared to tackle any
issues seriously.
An examination of the candi
dates' acceptance speeches re
veals that both are shrewd poli
ticians, armed with time-worn
platitudes, Harvard professors
and enigmatic party platforms.

| The Vice Presi-
I dent informs us
I I hat "in this dec-
I ade of decision
| and progress we
Swill witness the
| continued revi-
J aliza t i on of
| America's moral
I and sp ir i1 ua 1
jj strength, with a
I renewed faith in

the eternal ideals of freedom and
justice under God which are our
priceless heritage as a people."
Mr. Nixon, however, fails to in
form us as to how he would re
vitalize our moral and spiritual
st length.
Kennedy's speech is full of his
torical allusions which signify
little in relation to America's
present and future problems. He
beckons us to the New Frontier, a
land for the "young in heart, re
gardless of age 1 o the stout, re
gardless of party to all who
respond to the Scriptural call: 'Be
strong and of a good courage; be
not afraid, neither be thou dis
mayed.' "
1 would lie much less afraid or
dismayed if Kennedy would be a
little more precise. The New
Frontier may be the land of milk
and honey but it can't lie seen be
cause of the trees. If Kennedy

would pick up an axe and lead the
way, then suspicious people could
discern what lies beyond.
Nixon, who Spews forth plati
tudes at an alarming rate, says:
"The United States must never
settle for second best in any
thing" and that "America will not
tolerate being pushed around by
anybody."
Three cheers. Now, Mr. Nixon,
how do you propose to keep us on
top? Build more missiles? De
clare war on Russia? Play a hand
of showdown poker with Khru
shchev, winner take all?
Granted, Mr. Kennedy, that we
give you the courage, perserver
ance, imagination and votes you
request. Can't you be a little more
categorical, positive and analyti
cal in your assertions?
Of the two, Kennedy certainly
offers a more provocative and
stimulating challenge. Nixon
states: "What 1 propose is not
new, it is as old as America, and
as young as America, because
America will never grow old."
Kennedy at least does not go in
for such metaphysical, esoteric
statements as that!
But how do they propose to
ameliorate racial segregation, ihe
slum problem, the farm problem?
What do they intend to do about
Communism besides hurl epithets
;it it? And how do they stand on
capital punishment, or compul
sory military training?
Surely they have opinions and
most likely wo won't hear them
between now and November.
Meanwhile, voters will walk into
the booths without really know
ing either candidate. At a time
like this, a "siranger" President
menaces the freedom of our coun
try, the one thing he has sworn to
oreserve.
