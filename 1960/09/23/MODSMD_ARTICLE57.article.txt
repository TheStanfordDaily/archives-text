## A 						'Sterling' Story 
### 
When they told me he was go
ing I got all choked up. Tears
even came lo my eyes. I felt, too,
a pang of remorse that he was
leaving in a few days and I have
n't even met him.
You see, I am a student here
and Wallace Sterling is President
of the good old Farm. So you see,
it just isn't a quirk of fate that
lias kept us apart.

Of course I
have tried, but
every time I get
the nerve to
push open the
big black door
and go in and
see the President
just 1i k o it
show s all the
students d oing
in the booklet

they send to the frosh I just
loose my nerve.
1 did run into him once —or
rattier he ran into me. It hap
pened one morning. I was talking
to my freshman Knglish teacher.
(The prof and I were chuckling
over the many F's and IVs he had
given out. Of course, be said this
year he was going to break bis
record. It'' had also come up with
the idea to make Inner Quad into
a foreign legion post by hiring a
few camels and putting tliein be
tween the palms and putting the
faculty into w bite bermuda
shorts outfits with matching pith
helmets.)
As we were talking, a big man
walked by and said a friendly
"good morning."
I gave him my usual sarcastic

look and snorted, "1-Ii ya fella."
1 didn't know who he was, I just
greet everyone 1 don't know as
"fella."
I'll say one thing, though, ho
didn't have me expelled. But on
the other hand, I haven't got any-'
where ;it Stanford, either. Like
you know when the Tours and
Florence students took off, I
wasn't with them.
Well, when my esteemed editor
(he's a true great of the news
paper game) told me to write a
tribute to a man I've never met,
I did what any good reporter
would do —I called (lie people who
knew him best to get his back
ground. I figured I could bluff
the rest.
First I called a Dean. "What
do you know about him?" 1
asked.
"What do you want to know?"
he demanded. "What's this all
about?"
I explained I just wanted in
formation for a column.
"Quote me," the Dean said, his
voice returning to its usual calm
orderliness. "You can say he's
aces with me."
I hung up on him and called up
another Dean. "What can you tell
me about him?"
"Gee," she said, "why ask me?"
"You sure you can't remember
something?" I prodded.
"Well, 1 never got to know him
too well, but 1 always remember
him as the man walking across
Quad saying 'good morning.' lie's
such a friendly man."
Well, it isn't much, but it's
clean.
