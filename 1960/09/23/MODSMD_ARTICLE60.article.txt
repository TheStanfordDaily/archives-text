# Electronics Professor Angell New Hoover Carillon Ringer
## 
### MARY LOU McKINLEY Associate Editor 
Bells are ringing they were and they will be. But instead of
Judy Holliday at the switchboard, Professor James B. Angell will
be at the Hoover Tower carillon.
Leaving his office in the new Applied Electronics Laboratory each
week to cross the campus to the 35-bell instrument placed high in

Hoover Tower, Angell has per
haps the most unconventional
combination of talents here at
Stanford.
SERVING as an associate pro
fessor in the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, Angell is also a
talented musician, having played
the piano since he was four years
old, the organ and, for the last
eight years, t he carillon.
Formerly with Philco Corp. in
Philadelphia, the carilloneur re
ceived his 5.8.. S.M. and Doctor
of Science degrees at Massachu
setts Institute of Technology.
WHILE in Philadelphia, he be
longed to the First Methodist
Church in Germantown which had
a four-octave carillon.
One of the primary differences
between playing the carillon and
the piano, according to Angell, is

that the carillon's keyboard con
sists of a sel of "baton keys," each
about the size of a baton or
broomstick. "These arc swatted
with the side of the fist," lie said,
causing hammers to strike the
bells.
"It's a marvelous blister-gen
erating machine," he said, and
added that once he knocked the
80-pound clapper out of a bell in
the middle of a piece.
Instead of the two fields, engi
neering and music, conflicting,
Angcll said, "they supplement
each otherâ€”one appeals to scien
tific inquiry, the other to the emo
tions."
The difficult thing about learn
ing to play a carillon is that
there's not always one around to
practice 011, the musician-engi
neer continued, although some in
struments have a pr actice clavier.
HIS PLAYING will probably be
limited to once a week, and will
consist of sacred or classical
music or variations of hymn tunes
on Sundays and more secular
music on weekdays.
