# Capt. Midnight, Big Motorcycle Ready to Ride
## 
### CECI WITTMAN 
Some people think that Captain
! Midnight is a comic strip char-
I actor. But Stanford students know
j differently. Captain Midnight to
them is a traffic policeman who
| is a well-dressed Brando who goes
I jazzin' around campus on a three
i ton Harley.
Midnight, known to Chief Gor
don Davis as Carl Gielitz, has been
giving out tickets for legal and
! illegal parking around Stanford
' for many full moons.
SURPRISINGLY, he regards
j his name, which he acquired in
I some obscure way in 7)2, as a
"term of affection." It also gives
[ him a certain degree of recogni
: tion. "I don't mind what they call
me as long as it's printable," he
says.
He is well-known for being the
j most-dressed policeman on the
j Peninsula: lid, shades, even at
j night, immaculate blue shirt,
jodhpurs with creases that look
| wired in, patent leather boots and
I assorted incidental items that no
cop trying out for the Best
i Dressed awards should be with
| out: whistle, two blackjacks, po
lice special, chrome badge.
Tins PSKI IX) I Al)li:s* man is
: 11 and has no steady girl friend.
In his words, "I'm available," he
I adds with a chuckle,
i In addition to being a plain or
dinary traffic cop, he often takes
it upon himself to single-handedly
| quiet down riots, fights and gen
eral out of-the-ordinary uproar.
An example: the Phi Kaps' fa
mous Aqua Wazoo, which got
most disastrously demolished one
year. Arriving on the scene, Sher
lock Gielitz made a brilliant de
duction upon seeing debris scat
tered for a radius of 100 years: "I
! think someone put a bomb in that
j boat."
AND O\i; spring: Kappa Alpha
; was holding a quiet, orderly seces
sion from the Union on the Row.
Grant was being hung in effigy,
the Southern flag was flying, the
Ist reel was barricaded and Upper
Row was marching for Vicksburg.
