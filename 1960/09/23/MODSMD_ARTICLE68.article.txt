# INTELLECTUAL-SOCIAL CHOICES'
## Purpose of Pre-Reg Program Told by Chairman Bill Sterling 
### 
One of the busiest students on campus this week, and someone
who will undoubtedly be just as busy all year, is Bill Sterling, Pro-
Registration Committee Chairman.
Sterling has some very definite ideas as to what is the purpose of
the pre-reg program. "Its purpose is lo indicate the variety of intel-

A crucial water fight followed.
In action: Joe Friday Midnight
came spinning onto lawn on cycle,
hitting people with rubber slap
per. After running people into
hedges, etc., etc.. Midnight finally
called for reinforcements from
the department. "They were cre-
ating a traffic jam." he said. "I
just quieted them down a bit."
It is rumored thai Carl the Cam-
pus Cop, as Carl Gielitz Midnight
is also known, entered the force
on Aug. 23. 1949. However, when
questioned on this matter, he
would swear on his Policeman's
Manual that he entered in June.
THEN THERE WAS the '55
fire at Encina, which was started
when a frosh tried lo soften a
can of shoe polish over a flame.
It seems that Midnight was in the
courtyard directing traffic and
making a general nuisance of
himself when he got hit with a
bucketful of water.
Understandably irked, lie bomb
ed over to his motor, got his
Ã¼biquitous ticket book and scram
bled madly up to the fifth floor
only to be locked out.
His deeds have not always been
unprofitable to Stanford students.
When George Ralph ran for stu-
dent body president in '55, his
campaign stunt was a motorcycle
caravan around the Quad. In case
you haven't noticed, traffic is not
allowed. Midnight, bucking for a
promotion, saw his chance to give
out a complete book.of tickets and
then some.
WUKTIII K ( AKI. was pro
moted for this is uncertain, but
Ralph got elected.
In spite of being bull's eye for
numerous water balloons play
fully thrown by fraternity boys,
and having his toes run over while
directing traffic out by the post
office, he says thai after ten hell
raising years here, he plans to
stay another 20 more. "I get a big
kick out of their pranks," he said
as he polished his deputy mar
shal's badge.

leetual and social choices facing
the entering Stanford freshman,"
he says.
Sterling has been d art in g
around from one dormitory to an
other; a speech at Wilbur, a din
ner at Hranner. then across cam
pus to Roble to make sure every
thing is functioning smoothly
over there.
\VI!K\ in: has a moment to sit
down and rest, Sterling likes to
philosophize. "The fundamental
activity of the University is the
development of one's mind and
tjie continual quest for self-im
provement," he says.
"The various pre-reg events are
designed to aid the freshman in
developing the framework for ra
tional choice. The student must
face on a typical week night the
choice of whether to study, attend
a talk or concert, or go on a date."
Also President of the Institute
of International Relations < 11R >.
Sterling feels that each student
upon his arrival is trying lo find
out where he fits into the social
structure of Stanford.
"i;.\< II one of them is groping,
trying to earn a place. Part of the
pre-reg committee's job is to help
the freshmen begin to find their
way." he states.
A major innovation which Ster
ling has made in this year's ac
tivities is the establishment of a
book list which was sent out to
freshmen at the beginning of the
summer.
Tonight there will be the "Fri
day Evening Show," offering
freshmen the choice of attending
one of three talks. Professor
Leonard I. Schiff. Executive Head
of ihe Physics Department, will
speak on "Science and General
Education." Thomas Barclay, Pro
fessor Emeritus of Political Sci
ence. will give a presentation of
the currenl election and political
parties, while a professional the
atrical group will stage Oscar
Wilde's comedy. "The Importance
of Being Earnest."
