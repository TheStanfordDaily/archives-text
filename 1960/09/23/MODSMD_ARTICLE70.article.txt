## 
### 
About 100 foreign scholars were
officially welcomed to Stanford
Wednesday as speakers told them
that their pre. ; i nce here improves
tiie academic and social life of tlie
campus.
Welcoming speakers were Bill
Sterling, president of the Insti
tute of International Relations;
Robert Wert, vieeprovost of the
University; Lariy Royse, ASSU
President; Ann Howell; and Paul
IBundy, co-chairman of the I-Cen
ter Committee.
•STHKI.EXfa told the gathering
that the transition between two
cultures can be accomplished only
by the proper attitudes on the
part of the guest and'the host.
Each must be willing to go half
way in social contacts.
He told the foreign students
1 hat they can learn as much
through contact with their col
leagues as they can in the class
loom and asked that they take
the initiative in such activities.
Wert contrasted American uni
versities with foreign schools,
outlining the problems that might
be caused by the differences.
Stanford, he said, is chiefly a
residential university, an arrange
ment that leads to greater social
contact, thereby promoting more
efficient learning.
TIIK (»IiAl)lX(i system, in con
trast to foreign universities, is "a
series of hurdles rather than one
final high jump," Wert said. This
situation requires almost con
stant preparation for examina
tion. In the past, foreign students,
not accustomed to receiving letter
grades, have been disturbed by
Stanford's system.
ASSU President Larry Royse

extended the welcome of the stu
dent body. Ile asked that they call
upon him at any time for advice
and counseling.
Paul Bundy and Ann Howell
outlined upcoming social activi
ties designed to integrate the for
l n students with the rest of the
