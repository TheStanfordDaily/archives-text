# Nervous, Starry-Eyed Frosh Invade Campus, Get Prepared
## 
### MAVNAKD PARKER Managing Editor 
It was Arrival Day for some
1 279 freshmen Wednesday. They
came by car, nus, train, and plane.
And they came early.
By 8 a.m. there were lines in
front of Branner, Roble, Wilbur,
and Stern. And when the doors
opened the freshmen began a
frenzied week with a frenzied day.
One pert new Branner coed ex
claimed, "Looks as if confusion
reigns." Another in Roble, Judy
Lovelace, said, "Pre-Reg is organ
ized. it's just that I'm not."
Among the first to arrive at
Wilbur was part of the freshman
football team. Marshall Howard
"liked what I saw nice layout"
while Mike Beattv thought "the
architecture beautiful."
Across the street at Branner, the
girls, with their parents close be
hind or as close as possible, ar
rived at the front entrance loaded
with clothes, luggage, tennis
rackets, ski is. racks of shoes and
one little miss with a big "Nixon"
button.
One girl wanted to know where
are the porters. Alpha Phi Omega
doesn't belong to the Porter's
I nion, but they helped the gals
with ihe loads.
ONE It R A N N E Ii girl was
thrilled that she got a single bed.
"I had to sleep on the top bunk
one ve;'i in camp and . . . ooohh!"
At Roble one girl sat down and
cried because she didn't have
enough closet space.
Two upperclasmen manned the

j Roble door. One was Roble Presi
! dent Joan Lambert who stopped
j shaking hands and smiling at her
| newly arrived flock long enough
to say "that this year's class
seems*, self-assured and mature
and should be a definite asset to
Stan ford."
THE OTHER was Jim Johnson,
I a student cop, who, after turning
| away scores of what ho termed
"dolly hustlers" moaned. "Take
mo back to Los Angeles."
All through the morning Pre-
Reg Committee Chairman Bill
Sterling and his stalwarts in the
red armbands could be seen lend
ing a hand.
They were down at the train
station at 7:10 in the morning to
greet the more than 100 freshmen
from Southern California who ar
rived on Southern Pacific's Lark
streamliner.
TIIE NEW INDIANS seemed
excited, a litle curious, and sur
prised at all of the hulabaloo at
trainside. The band was there to
play the fight song and the pom
pon gills made their first public
appearance which the train crew
applauded.
As she bounced off the train,
Judy Wyler of Los Angeles
summed up her reaction with a
breathless, "It's very exciting."
For a brief moment .Judy
thought she lost her luggage or
someone had taken it until a
helpful A Phi O lad, seeing a
lady in distress, explained that it
was being taken to the dorm.
