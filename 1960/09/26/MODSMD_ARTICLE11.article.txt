A foolish consistency is I lie hobgoblin of lit 110 minds . . .

Students are on tbe move. The silent generation of the fillies is
becoming the belligerent generation of the sixties.
And no small wonder. Students are fed up. I hey are sickened
by I lie hypocrisy which permeates onr society. I hey are banding
together in hope that in numbers there is strength.
Thev are marching throughout the land. Sit-inners in the south
and ant i-eapi ta I punish men I groups, especially preva lent right here
in the S;m Francisco area where (!ar\l Chessman was executed.
Then there was the huge mass of students in May who protested
the meeting of the House I n-Ainerican Activities <'.omtnitlee in
San Francisco.
Students know that many changes must be made if America is
to remain the citadel of freedom in the eyes of the world. I hey
seem to sense that a status quo cannot alleviate the mammoth
problems which threaten lo strangle the I nited Stales.
Most of all. students realize that history repeats its* If because
nobody was listening the first lime. Now they are listening. Now
thev are revolting against what I hey hear, what lliey see and what
they fear.
As a great institution of higher learning, Stanford must play
an active role in litis student rebellion. We must not make this
university a land of ivory towers where one can so easily find
refuge from the important job which lies ahead.
Rebellion does not mean bloody revolution. The Bolsheviks
used that method and the outcome has been a regime built and
maintained on fear. But rebellion can also develop into llie more
pacific and more intelligent form of dissent.
Throughout our history il has been the dissenters who made
and kept America strong. Men like Ralph \\ ahlo Mmerson, whose
quote is above. Men like Thomas Jefferson who said: '*1 hold il,
that a little rebellion now and then, is a good thing, and as neces
sary in the political world as storms in the physical."
I lie time lo start earnestly criticizing such issues as capital
punishment, segregation, llie nuclear arms race, is now, for as
Mmerson said : k 'ln skating over thin ice, our safel\ is in our speed."
