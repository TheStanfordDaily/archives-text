# The 						Great Debates?

Toni«il11 marks the first in the series of four television debates
between the two Presidential candidates. I lie subject is '"I)oniestie
Policy" and air time is 9:30 p.m. on channels 4, ."> and 7.
I lie impact these televised debates are supposed to have on the
outcome of the election is generally considered to he enormous.
And, indeed, it is possible that with between 60 and 7.") million
people watch in jr. both candidates speaking in the same place and on
the same subject, much could he said vhich might influence ihe
\oting public on its choice of candidates.
In llie midst of all the publicity about ihe significance and
importance of the debates, however, we find ourselves growing
slightly uneasv. We hear much about how much time and effort
the candidates are expending on the form and shape of these de
bates, but little about what they are going to sav.
Nixon's camp is reported as wanting straight debates because
this will enable him to use his forensic ahil it\ that he picked up
in college, and which he has sharpened against his opponents for
\arious political offices and against the Russian premier.
Kennedy is supposed to want something more in the way of
speeches with question and answer sessions by newsmen afterwards.
This, so his thinking goes, will allow the greater force of his per
sonality to shine through.
Some sort of an intricate compromise has been worked out with
the form of each of the four debates changing In allow each candi
date a chance at what he wants.
We suppose that this type of jockeying is inevitable, but we
cannot help hut consider it unimportant when compared to the
issues at hand. Hopefully, each candidate will have something
important and challenging to say tonight and will not spend his
time trying to create an "image."
