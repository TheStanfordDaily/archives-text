## United States Must Fullfill Twofold Role in United Nations Relations 
### 
This country has a double role |
in its relations with Ihe United j
Nations and during the past few
hectic days we have acted in both
roles. In the one we are one of the
members, in our legal lights like
all the others except that we are
one of the five great powers with
a permanent seat and the right
of veto in ihe Security Council.
In our other role we are ihe host
of the United Nations organiza
tion in New York, a role in which
we have special duties and re
sponsibilities, some of them writ
ten and some of them unwritten.
In the second and special role
we are committed to something
more than the defense and pro
motion of our own national in
terests — to something more than
the defense of our own alliance.
We are committed to the defense
and promotion of the United Na
tion* as a world institution. We
are committed to the protection,
not only of the physical presence
i of its buildings and its members
' on Manhattan Island, but also to
the protection of its dignity and
its authority. The United Nations
is a universal society and all the
world has access to it. lis dignity
and authority require that all
I shall have access who have a
| legitimate right to come to its j
headquarters, and that includes
! even non-members seeking re
; dress against what they regard
as their grievances.
It is a complete misunderstand
ing of the special character of our
relations with the U.N. to speak I
of Khrushchev, Castro, Kadar.
and the others, as "unwelcome
and uninvited guests." They are
not in New York as Ihe guests
of the Uniled States or anyone
else. They received no invitations
from anyone and ihey needed
none. The fact that Ihey are not ;
welcome to Americans has noth-i
ing to do with anything. They are j
members in good standing of the

United Nations, and we are com
mitted to defend their right to
be here.
We are under no obligation, of
course, to grant them the right
to do more than to have free ac
cess to the United Nations. They
are not visitors to the United
Slates, and they have no unre
stricted right to travel. Whether
the restrictions imposed on Khru
shchev and Castro were smart is
another question. Mr. K. was able
to make a bigger show in Harlem,
which is open to him, than he
could have made by spending his
nights on Long Island. The offi
cial who designed the restrictions
on Mr. K. and Castro seems not
to have been told that the main
and opening theme of the Assem
bly turned on ihe admission of
thirteen Negro republics.
Our commitment to the U.N. is
deeper and is older than the loca
tion of its headquarters in New
York. Indeed the headquarters
were located in New York be
cause we pleaded for this and per
suaded our allies, including at the
time the Soviet Union, to vote for
New York. The argument, which
Cor my own part I never agreed
with, was that instead of placing'
the U.N. in a small and neutral
country, it should he placed in
the United States. Why? Because
this was the only way to make
sure that, unlike 1919 when we re
pudiated the League of Nations,
we would stay in the United Na
tions.
In any event, the United Nations
is in New York, and its presence
there is a monument to the fact
that twice in this century, after
each of the world wars, we have
been the principal champions of
a universal society to maintain
the peace. This is what confers
upon us the privileges and the
duties and the vexations of our
second and special role.

We should play this role proud
ly. We should realize that the de
fense of Die U.N., as the Congo
is demonstrating, is the defense
of our true interest in Africa
which is to remain in contact and
in collaboration with the new
African states. What is more, it
may yet come to pass that the
U.N., if it lives through its great
ordeal in Africa, will provide the
means for an accommodation in
Berlin. There are many things
that are harder to imagine than
that.

United Nations, and we are com

We are under no obligation, of

are not visitors to the United

the restrictions imposed on Khru
shchev and Castro were smart is
another question. Mr. K. was able
to make a bigger show in Harlem,
which is open to him, than he
could have made by spending his
nights on Long Island. The offi
cial who designed the restrictions
on Mr. K. and Castro seems not
to have been told that the main
and opening theme of the Assem
bly turned on ihe admission of
thirteen Negro republics.
Our commitment to the U.N. is
deeper and is older than the loca
tion of its headquarters in New
York. Indeed the headquarters
were located in New York be
cause we pleaded for this and per
suaded our allies, including at the
time the Soviet Union, to vote for
New York. The argument, which
Cor my own part I never agreed
with, was that instead of placing'
the U.N. in a small and neutral
country, it should he placed in
the United States. Why? Because
this was the only way to make
sure that, unlike 1919 when we re
pudiated the League of Nations,
we would stay in the United Na

In any event, the United Nations
is in New York, and its presence
there is a monument to the fact
that twice in this century, after
each of the world wars, we have
been the principal champions of
a universal society to maintain
the peace. This is what confers
upon us the privileges and the
duties and the vexations of our
second and special role.

We should play this role proud
ly. We should realize that the de
fense of Die U.N., as the Congo
is demonstrating, is the defense
of our true interest in Africa
which is to remain in contact and
in collaboration with the new
African states. What is more, it
may yet come to pass that the
U.N., if it lives through its great
ordeal in Africa, will provide the
means for an accommodation in
Berlin. There are many things
that are harder to imagine than
that.

second and special role.

We should play this role proud
ly. We should realize that the de
fense of Die U.N., as the Congo
is demonstrating, is the defense
of our true interest in Africa
which is to remain in contact and
in collaboration with the new
African states. What is more, it
may yet come to pass that the
U.N., if it lives through its great
ordeal in Africa, will provide the
means for an accommodation in
Berlin. There are many things
that are harder to imagine than
that.

This country has a double role |
in its relations with Ihe United j
Nations and during the past few
hectic days we have acted in both
roles. In the one we are one of the
members, in our legal lights like
all the others except that we are
one of the five great powers with
a permanent seat and the right
of veto in ihe Security Council.
In our other role we are ihe host
of the United Nations organiza
tion in New York, a role in which
we have special duties and re
sponsibilities, some of them writ
ten and some of them unwritten.
In the second and special role
we are committed to something
more than the defense and pro
motion of our own national in
terests — to something more than
the defense of our own alliance.
We are committed to the defense
and promotion of the United Na
tion* as a world institution. We
are committed to the protection,
not only of the physical presence
i of its buildings and its members
' on Manhattan Island, but also to
the protection of its dignity and
its authority. The United Nations
is a universal society and all the
world has access to it. lis dignity
and authority require that all
I shall have access who have a
| legitimate right to come to its j
headquarters, and that includes
! even non-members seeking re
; dress against what they regard
as their grievances.
It is a complete misunderstand
ing of the special character of our
relations with the U.N. to speak I
of Khrushchev, Castro, Kadar.
and the others, as "unwelcome
and uninvited guests." They are
not in New York as Ihe guests
of the Uniled States or anyone
else. They received no invitations
from anyone and ihey needed
none. The fact that Ihey are not ;
welcome to Americans has noth-i
ing to do with anything. They are j
members in good standing of the

United Nations, and we are com
mitted to defend their right to
be here.
We are under no obligation, of
course, to grant them the right
to do more than to have free ac
cess to the United Nations. They
are not visitors to the United
Slates, and they have no unre
stricted right to travel. Whether
the restrictions imposed on Khru
shchev and Castro were smart is
another question. Mr. K. was able
to make a bigger show in Harlem,
which is open to him, than he
could have made by spending his
nights on Long Island. The offi
cial who designed the restrictions
on Mr. K. and Castro seems not
to have been told that the main
and opening theme of the Assem
bly turned on ihe admission of
thirteen Negro republics.
Our commitment to the U.N. is
deeper and is older than the loca
tion of its headquarters in New
York. Indeed the headquarters
were located in New York be
cause we pleaded for this and per
suaded our allies, including at the
time the Soviet Union, to vote for
New York. The argument, which
Cor my own part I never agreed
with, was that instead of placing'
the U.N. in a small and neutral
country, it should he placed in
the United States. Why? Because
this was the only way to make
sure that, unlike 1919 when we re
pudiated the League of Nations,
we would stay in the United Na
tions.
In any event, the United Nations
is in New York, and its presence
there is a monument to the fact
that twice in this century, after
each of the world wars, we have
been the principal champions of
a universal society to maintain
the peace. This is what confers
upon us the privileges and the
duties and the vexations of our
second and special role.

We should play this role proud
ly. We should realize that the de
fense of Die U.N., as the Congo
is demonstrating, is the defense
of our true interest in Africa
which is to remain in contact and
in collaboration with the new
African states. What is more, it
may yet come to pass that the
U.N., if it lives through its great
ordeal in Africa, will provide the
means for an accommodation in
Berlin. There are many things
that are harder to imagine than
that.
