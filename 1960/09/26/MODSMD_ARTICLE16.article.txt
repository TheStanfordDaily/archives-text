(Editor's "Vot<•: John Schwa rz,

ford Daily, is traveling' through
Europe.)
Many segments of American
(culture have been brought into
i European life in recent years.
Beginning with the ascension!
1 of Coca Cola in Europe several I
years ago and working on through '
the 19 cent hamburger, the hot-
I dog, Elvis Presley, the hula hoop
i and Ivy League suits, American
i fads have been quick to catch on !
j in many sectors of the Old World,
The most recent American import
; into Europe has been the Ameri
can folk song.
In Stockholm it is common to
j hear a young Swedish girl with
no more* knowledge of conversa
tional English than hello and
goodbye strolling down the street
singing the lyrics of "Tom
Donley," "The Streets of Laredo,"
or even the "Ballad of Sherman
Wu,"
LOCATED IV the center of
Stockholm is theTetley Teahouse,
known by those around the Swed
ish capital as the Thehussen. At
the Thehussen, students of Stock
holm sit around discussing world
affairs and sipping unlimited
quantities of lea for the price of

7.") ore or 1.1 cents.
Austrian, British, Dutch and
French students as well as some
American students seem to find
this Scandanavian city a summer
vacation paradise. When the run
of political questions have been
hashed over, the first question
most European students bring up
to American visitors is, "Can you
teach me some American folk
songs?"
The Kingston Trio, Pete Seeger,
The Weavers and other popular
American folk artists have had
smatterings of t heir records played
in Europe and their success has
led the European to search out
more of such entertainment.
TKAYELEVCJ American college
students who play banjos or gui
tars fulfill some of the demand
while the record libraries of ihe
local American Embassy or Con
sulate provides another way of
satisfying the European's desires.
With the current popularity of
the American folk song in Europe,
perhaps the best propoganda
weapon the U.S. could use would
be to send a group of folksingers
abroad. A Ballad of Frances
Powers might be a fitting answer
to Russia's big August theatrical
production.
