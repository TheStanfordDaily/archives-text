mier Nikita S. Khrushchev told
the West yesterday to choose be
tween his United Nations reor
ganization plan or a continuation
of the cold war.
Under his plan, the single Sec
retary General would be replaced
with a Soviet-style three-man Sec
retariat, representing Capitalism,
Communism and Neutralism.
"IF THERE had been three sec
retaries-general, no crisis in the
Congo would have occurred," he
said.
Khrushchev repeater! his charges
that Hammarskjold served Ihe in
terests of capitalist countries by
ordering U.N. Forces to occupy
airports and power stations in the
Congo and "did his utmost to as
sist the Belgian colonials to re
sume rule in the Congo."
This policy, he said, "paralyzed
the activities of the legally consti
tuted Congolese government."
"I NHEK three secretaries-gen
eral this would not have come
about," he said. "The interna
tional forces then would have been
used to support the legally con
stituted government and there
would not have been a crisis."
Concerning disarmament. Khru
shchev' spoke in mild tones when
he said that resumption of dis
armament talks in Geneva would
be all right with him if:
They were conducted by a
group other than the 10-nation
United Nations disarmament com
mittee, which broke off talks in
Geneva last June after months of
dragged-out negot iat ions.
They included members of
neutral nations.
KHRI SIICIIK\ also made it
clear that the Soviet Union would
not resign from the United Na
tions if the West turned down his
demand for a reorganization of
the executive branch to include
three secretaries-general instead
of the present one.
And he also said he would not
insist upon the resignation of Dag
Hammarskjold as secretary gen
eral. He repeated his statements
of last night that lie would have
no objection if the West chose
Hammarskjold as its representa
tive on a three-man secretariat, to
serve with representatives of the

the executive branch to include
three secretaries-general instead
of the present one.
And he also said he would not
insist upon the resignation of Dag
Hammarskjold as secretary gen
eral. He repeated his statements
of last night that lie would have
no objection if the West chose
Hammarskjold as its representa

serve with representatives of the
Communist and neutralist eoun
t ties.
GLEN COVE. N.Y. < UPII Pre
mier Nikita S. Khrushchev told
the West yesterday to choose be
tween his United Nations reor
ganization plan or a continuation
of the cold war.
Under his plan, the single Sec
retary General would be replaced
with a Soviet-style three-man Sec
retariat, representing Capitalism,
Communism and Neutralism.
"IF THERE had been three sec
retaries-general, no crisis in the
Congo would have occurred," he
said.
Khrushchev repeater! his charges
that Hammarskjold served Ihe in
terests of capitalist countries by
ordering U.N. Forces to occupy
airports and power stations in the
Congo and "did his utmost to as
sist the Belgian colonials to re
sume rule in the Congo."
This policy, he said, "paralyzed
the activities of the legally consti
tuted Congolese government."
"I NHEK three secretaries-gen
eral this would not have come
about," he said. "The interna
tional forces then would have been
used to support the legally con
stituted government and there
would not have been a crisis."
Concerning disarmament. Khru
shchev' spoke in mild tones when
he said that resumption of dis
armament talks in Geneva would
be all right with him if:
They were conducted by a
group other than the 10-nation
United Nations disarmament com
mittee, which broke off talks in
Geneva last June after months of
dragged-out negot iat ions.
They included members of
neutral nations.
KHRI SIICIIK\ also made it
clear that the Soviet Union would
not resign from the United Na
tions if the West turned down his
demand for a reorganization of
the executive branch to include
three secretaries-general instead
of the present one.
And he also said he would not
insist upon the resignation of Dag
Hammarskjold as secretary gen
eral. He repeated his statements
of last night that lie would have
no objection if the West chose
Hammarskjold as its representa
tive on a three-man secretariat, to
serve with representatives of the
