# Barclay States Class, Religion Influence Vote

### ROSS HERMANN 
Thomas S. Barclay, Professor
Emeritus of Political Science,
told freshmen Friday night that
the chief difference between
America's political parties lies in
methods rather than goals.
Barclay's statement came while
outlining I lie major weaknesses
and strengths of the party system
in the United States. His talk was
one of three offered to freshmen
as part of pre-reg week activities.
UK CITED the chief weak
nesses of the two parties as being
a lack of clear-cut principles and
strong issues, a lack of unity and
discipline, and little "intensity of
conviction" on the part of poli
ticians.
The strengths of the two
parties, on the other hand, lie in
the efficiency of their organiza
tion and the vitality of their tra
ditions.
Barclay also listed a series of
factors l hat tend to determine
how a person will vote. Although
sectionalism is declining, ho said,
it is still an important factor, with
the nation still split along north
south lines.
ANOTHER important factor is
locality the city dweller gen
erally votes Democratic while the
rural resident is traditionally Re
publican. The suberb, a phenom
enon of recent years that may
hold the key to the future of pol
itics. has been mixed in its politi
cal preferences, although pre
dominantly Republican to date.
Class position, too, tends to de
termine voting with the upper
middle and upper class generally
voting Republican and the lower
middle and lower classes voting
Democratic.
In terms of education, the intel
lectual elite and the most ignor
ant are found in the Democratic
party while the middle class per
son with average or better educa
tion is generally found in the
Republican column.
NATIONAL background is also
a factor with English, Scandi
navians, Germans, and others of
immigrant stock who came to this
country before the turn of the
century voting Republican and
the Irish, Poles, Italians, and
Slavs who have emigrated since
1900 voting Democratic.
As a result of the allegiance of
the most recent immigrants, the
Democratic party is considerably
more Catholic Ihan the Republi
can party which finds its support
generally among older American
Protestant stock.
Barclay noted also that between
fi."> and 7.1 per cent of American
voters follow the views of their
parents, although there seems to
be a growing tendency today to
break with parental prccendence.
WHEN ASKED if the electoral
college should be abolished in fa
vor of a popular vote, Barclay an
swered negatively, expressing the
view that such a change would
shift more political power to the
mammoth city machines.

Thomas S. Barclay, Professor
Emeritus of Political Science,
told freshmen Friday night that
the chief difference between
America's political parties lies in
methods rather than goals.
Barclay's statement came while
outlining I lie major weaknesses
and strengths of the party system
in the United States. His talk was
one of three offered to freshmen
as part of pre-reg week activities.
UK CITED the chief weak
nesses of the two parties as being
a lack of clear-cut principles and
strong issues, a lack of unity and
discipline, and little "intensity of
conviction" on the part of poli
ticians.
The strengths of the two
parties, on the other hand, lie in
the efficiency of their organiza
tion and the vitality of their tra
ditions.
Barclay also listed a series of
factors l hat tend to determine
how a person will vote. Although
sectionalism is declining, ho said,
it is still an important factor, with
the nation still split along north
south lines.
ANOTHER important factor is
locality the city dweller gen
erally votes Democratic while the
rural resident is traditionally Re
publican. The suberb, a phenom
enon of recent years that may
hold the key to the future of pol
itics. has been mixed in its politi
cal preferences, although pre
dominantly Republican to date.
Class position, too, tends to de
termine voting with the upper
middle and upper class generally
voting Republican and the lower
middle and lower classes voting
Democratic.
In terms of education, the intel
lectual elite and the most ignor
ant are found in the Democratic
party while the middle class per
son with average or better educa
tion is generally found in the
Republican column.
NATIONAL background is also
a factor with English, Scandi
navians, Germans, and others of
immigrant stock who came to this
country before the turn of the
century voting Republican and
the Irish, Poles, Italians, and
Slavs who have emigrated since
1900 voting Democratic.
As a result of the allegiance of
the most recent immigrants, the
Democratic party is considerably
more Catholic Ihan the Republi
can party which finds its support
generally among older American
Protestant stock.
Barclay noted also that between
fi."> and 7.1 per cent of American
voters follow the views of their
parents, although there seems to
be a growing tendency today to
break with parental prccendence.
WHEN ASKED if the electoral
college should be abolished in fa
vor of a popular vote, Barclay an
swered negatively, expressing the
view that such a change would
shift more political power to the
mammoth city machines.
