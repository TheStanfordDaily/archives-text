# Iron Posts Signal New Mall; Create Roadblocks for Autos
## 
### 
Progress took another bite out
of Stanford life this summer
when 13 iron posts were strung
across Lasuen Street at the Wo
men's Clubhouse, signaling the
permanent barring of cars from
the stretch of street lying be
tween Engineering Corner and
the site of the old Post Office.
Another group of posts is
placed across Panama Street at
the telephone exchange, cutting
off the half-block between the ex
change and Lasuen where cus
tomers of the Cellar formerly
parked.
THE MOVES, made Sept. 1,
were two more steps toward the
completion of the new multi-mil
| lion dollar student activities com-
I plex which will be climaxed with
the construction of Tresidder
Union.
The closed area will eventually
become a pedestrian mall, accord
ing to S. F. Post, assistant busi
ness manager.
Someday Lasuen will be forbid
den area to traffic as far as Cam
pus Drive, the street which runs
past Florence Moore Hall, as part
of the program to turn that entire
part of the campus into a student
activities center.
Westbound autos now will be
turned aside at the intersection of
Escondido Road and Alvarado
Row, at the corner of the Educa
tion Building, as they have been
during business hours for many
years.

TRAFFIC on Lasuen Street to
and from Fraternity Row will be
tinned aside at its intersection
with Santa Teresa Street at Din
kelspiel Auditorium, Post said.
Duenna Street, which run« past
the police station to the Union
residence, will give access to the
Union residents' parking lot. Pan
ama will continue to be one-way
toward the Women's Gymnasium.
Post, in explaining the measure,
said lhat stopping auto traffic
through the street i.s part of the
ultimate plan for the activities
complex.
Thus, gone forever is the fa
miliar scene of hundreds of hur
rying students emerging from
Quad going toward the Row,
bookstore, post office and so
forth, mixing in grand confusion
with those heading for the li
brary, Quad and points east
with everyone dodging cars on |
Lasuen.
However, most of those driving
to tho post office will have to park
in the bookstore lot, which has
ample space and no time limit.
WIIILF Ihe changes are un
doubtedly necessary, driving stu
dents are letting loose with a few
gripes.
As one coed, who preferred to
remain anonymous, put it, "I'd
like to bash 'em in the head" for
closing the street. Even better,
she gleefully added, "I'd give 'em
the Axe!"

THE MOVES, made Sept. 1,
were two more steps toward the
completion of the new multi-mil

I plex which will be climaxed with
the construction of Tresidder
Union.
The closed area will eventually
become a pedestrian mall, accord

Someday Lasuen will be forbid
den area to traffic as far as Cam
pus Drive, the street which runs
past Florence Moore Hall, as part
of the program to turn that entire
part of the campus into a student
activities center.
Westbound autos now will be
turned aside at the intersection of
Escondido Road and Alvarado
Row, at the corner of the Educa
tion Building, as they have been
during business hours for many

tinned aside at its intersection
with Santa Teresa Street at Din
kelspiel Auditorium, Post said.
Duenna Street, which run« past
the police station to the Union
residence, will give access to the
Union residents' parking lot. Pan

Lasuen.

to tho post office will have to park
in the bookstore lot, which has
ample space and no time limit.

gripes.
As one coed, who preferred to
remain anonymous, put it, "I'd
like to bash 'em in the head" for
closing the street. Even better,
she gleefully added, "I'd give 'em
the Axe!"
Progress took another bite out
of Stanford life this summer
when 13 iron posts were strung
across Lasuen Street at the Wo
men's Clubhouse, signaling the
permanent barring of cars from
the stretch of street lying be
tween Engineering Corner and
the site of the old Post Office.
