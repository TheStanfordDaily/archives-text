### RON RAPOPORT Sports Editor 
Stanford's grid squad won itself
lialf a football game against Wis
consin in Iho Stadium Saturday,
hut whon iho Tribe fame out for
the second half they ran into a
sophomore quarterback who pass
ed them right out of the park.
The final tally was 217 for the
Badgers.
The game proved more than a
littlo cosily for the Tribe as start
ing linemen Doug Pursell and
Dean Hinshaw came up with knee
injuries which may curtail their
activities for the season.
TIIIO W ISC ONSIN signal caller
who ran away with hero-of-the-day
honors was Ron Miller, who, after
completing only one pass out of
six tries in the first half, came
back to connect on 15 for 19 and
three touchdowns in the last two
periods.
Miller was hitting everybody in
sight as he threw strike after
strike which found his receivers
usually away from ihe tiring
Stanford defenders. Miller threw
for 117 yards and Iwo scores in
the third quarter alone as he hit
on 11 out of 13 in that 15-minute
space. At one point he was work
ing on a string of 11 for' 16.
The crowd of 29,,"500 sitting in
85-degreo heat could do nothing
but wonder what had happened to
a Stanford team that had had the
first half entirely its own way.
Tribe quarterback Dick Norman
had been the passer of old and he
had even found a couple of ends. |
The Indians had scored once, had j
lost two more on what are com
monly called "the breaks," and
had been pretty tough defensively, j
Til 10 Tltllti: score came in the j
first quarter with Norman direct-i
ing a 75-yard drive which look
only nine plays. Three of these
were passes to sophomore end
Dale Ostrander. The TD pass
came with Ostrander pulling in a
11-yard Norman aerial and falling
into the end zone for the score.
Dale ended the game with five
catches for 6i5 yards, high for the
Indians.
The next time the Tribe got the
ball they looked just as tough.
Jim Bakken, the Badger quarter
back. punted dead on the Stanford j
seven. Three plays later Face i
punted and Miller grabbed it at
midfield.
Tim Hansel smashed into Miller, j
jarring tho ball loose, and Errol I
Scott fell on the ball on Wiscon-j
