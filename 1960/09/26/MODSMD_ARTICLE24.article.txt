### 
BOSTON, Sept. 25 (UPD—The
New York Yankees today won
their tenth American League pen
nant in 12 years under Manager
Casey Stengel, beating the Boston

sin's 32 for the Indians.
Norman passed in the end zone
to Skip Face, but the ball just slid
off the fullback's fingertips. An
other pass went incomplete in the
end zone, but then Norman hit
Jerry Winters and the Cards had
first down on the 17.
N'OKMA.N hit Winters again,
this time on the five-yard line, but
Jerry made a tactical error. Win
ters saw three blockers rushing
up to clear a path for him. so he
cut toward the center of the field
to follow his interference, but was
pulled down from behind on the
three. What Winters couldn't see.
but what everyone in the stands
could see with painful clarity was
that if he had cut to the sideline
he would have scored in a walk.
There was no one close enough to
touch him.
On the next play Norman bob
bled the handoff and Ron Perkins
fell on the ball for the Badgers.
Late in the second period, the
Indians started rolling again, this
time from their own 10. A 20-yard
pass to Winters and a 21-yard
pitch to Face helped get the ball
♦ o Wisconsin's 32. Norman passed
to Ostrander for three, then Face
faked a field goal attempt, but the
resulting Norman pass was in
complete. Face then tried a field
goal for real from the 40, but the
kick was short and to the right.
The half ended a minute later and
that was the last chance the In
dians got at the Wisconsin goal
line.

Till-: SECOND half began and
Miller came out passing. Hugh
Richter and a fourth-string end
named Ron Staley were Miller's
favorite receivers, catching seven
and five losses respectively. Miller
threw six complete passes the first
time Wisconsin got the ball, and
less than four minutes after the
half began he found Staley in the
end /one and the score was tied.
The Tribe was saved from fur
ther Badger scoring for the mo
ment when, after Wisconsin got
the ball again, Miller directed a
drive to the Indian's 1(5, Staley
dropped a pass after he caught it
and Stanford recovered on the
five.
Wisconsin made no similar mis
takes and fi'om then on with one
exception every time the Badgers
had the ball, they scored:

end /.one, 14-7. Ervin Kunesh kick
ed a field goal, 17-7. Miller had a
pass intercepted by Gary Craig.
Miller passed to Tom Anthony.
24-7.
Unquestionably the heat helped
wear the Indians down, as did the
loss of Purcell, Hinshaw and C. B.
Simons, who was tossed out after
a personal foul.
Norman, who had completed 15
out of 27 losses for 173 yards in
the first half, completed not a one
in the second half.

nie Mack led Philadelphia to nine
pennants while managing the Ath
letics for half a century.
New York failed to win the pen
nant only twice behind Stengel,
finishing third in back of Chicago

lost a bid for his third straight
shutout when Vic Wert/, singled

100 th and 101st runs of the year.
Terry had pitched 2.i consecutive
scoreless innings until then. The
tall right-hander retired the next

i eighth.
IT WAS the 10th victory against
J eight losses for Terry, who was a
key factor in N'ew York's stretch
drive, blossoming as consistent
winner six weeks ago.
Left-hander Luis Arroyo came
on to retire the final Boston batter
in the ninth after the Red Sox
nicked Terry for three singles and
their third run of the game. Terry
had doubled home what proved to
be the deciding run in the sixth
inning following Tony Kubek's
two-bagger.
Roger Maris led a nine-hit New

1 third runs in the third inning. The

winner six weeks ago.
Left-hander Luis Arroyo came
on to retire the final Boston batter
in the ninth after the Red Sox
nicked Terry for three singles and
their third run of the game. Terry
had doubled home what proved to
be the deciding run in the sixth

Casey Stengel, beating the Boston

sin's 32 for the Indians.
Norman passed in the end zone
to Skip Face, but the ball just slid
off the fullback's fingertips. An
other pass went incomplete in the
end zone, but then Norman hit
Jerry Winters and the Cards had
first down on the 17.
N'OKMA.N hit Winters again,
this time on the five-yard line, but
Jerry made a tactical error. Win

up to clear a path for him. so he
cut toward the center of the field
to follow his interference, but was
pulled down from behind on the
three. What Winters couldn't see.
but what everyone in the stands
could see with painful clarity was
that if he had cut to the sideline
he would have scored in a walk.
There was no one close enough to
touch him.
On the next play Norman bob
bled the handoff and Ron Perkins
fell on the ball for the Badgers.
Late in the second period, the
Indians started rolling again, this
time from their own 10. A 20-yard
pass to Winters and a 21-yard
pitch to Face helped get the ball
♦ o Wisconsin's 32. Norman passed
to Ostrander for three, then Face
faked a field goal attempt, but the
resulting Norman pass was in
complete. Face then tried a field
goal for real from the 40, but the
kick was short and to the right.
The half ended a minute later and
that was the last chance the In

line.

Till-: SECOND half began and
Miller came out passing. Hugh
Richter and a fourth-string end

favorite receivers, catching seven
and five losses respectively. Miller
threw six complete passes the first
time Wisconsin got the ball, and
less than four minutes after the
half began he found Staley in the
end /one and the score was tied.
The Tribe was saved from fur

the ball again, Miller directed a
drive to the Indian's 1(5, Staley
dropped a pass after he caught it
and Stanford recovered on the

Terry, a 24-year-old Oklahoman,
lost a bid for his third straight
shutout when Vic Wert/, singled
home two unearned Boston runs
in the third inning, driving in his
100 th and 101st runs of the year.
Terry had pitched 2.i consecutive
scoreless innings until then. The
tall right-hander retired the next

key factor in N'ew York's stretch
drive, blossoming as consistent
winner six weeks ago.
Left-hander Luis Arroyo came
on to retire the final Boston batter
in the ninth after the Red Sox
nicked Terry for three singles and
their third run of the game. Terry
had doubled home what proved to
be the deciding run in the sixth
inning following Tony Kubek's

BOSTON, Sept. 25 (UPD—The
New York Yankees today won
their tenth American League pen
nant in 12 years under Manager
Casey Stengel, beating the Boston

sin's 32 for the Indians.
Norman passed in the end zone
to Skip Face, but the ball just slid
off the fullback's fingertips. An
other pass went incomplete in the
end zone, but then Norman hit
Jerry Winters and the Cards had
first down on the 17.
N'OKMA.N hit Winters again,
this time on the five-yard line, but
Jerry made a tactical error. Win
ters saw three blockers rushing
up to clear a path for him. so he
cut toward the center of the field
to follow his interference, but was
pulled down from behind on the
three. What Winters couldn't see.
but what everyone in the stands
could see with painful clarity was
that if he had cut to the sideline
he would have scored in a walk.
There was no one close enough to
touch him.
On the next play Norman bob
bled the handoff and Ron Perkins
fell on the ball for the Badgers.
Late in the second period, the
Indians started rolling again, this
time from their own 10. A 20-yard
pass to Winters and a 21-yard
pitch to Face helped get the ball
♦ o Wisconsin's 32. Norman passed
to Ostrander for three, then Face
faked a field goal attempt, but the
resulting Norman pass was in
complete. Face then tried a field
goal for real from the 40, but the
kick was short and to the right.
The half ended a minute later and
that was the last chance the In
dians got at the Wisconsin goal
line.

Till-: SECOND half began and
Miller came out passing. Hugh
Richter and a fourth-string end
named Ron Staley were Miller's
favorite receivers, catching seven
and five losses respectively. Miller
threw six complete passes the first
time Wisconsin got the ball, and
less than four minutes after the
half began he found Staley in the
end /one and the score was tied.
The Tribe was saved from fur
ther Badger scoring for the mo
ment when, after Wisconsin got
the ball again, Miller directed a
drive to the Indian's 1(5, Staley
dropped a pass after he caught it
and Stanford recovered on the
five.
Wisconsin made no similar mis
takes and fi'om then on with one
exception every time the Badgers

end /.one, 14-7. Ervin Kunesh kick
ed a field goal, 17-7. Miller had a
pass intercepted by Gary Craig.
Miller passed to Tom Anthony.
24-7.
Unquestionably the heat helped
wear the Indians down, as did the
loss of Purcell, Hinshaw and C. B.
Simons, who was tossed out after
a personal foul.
Norman, who had completed 15
out of 27 losses for 173 yards in
