# Pursell, Hinshaw Might Play Later Says Card Trainer Connie Jarvis
## 
### 
Dean Hinshaw and Doug Pur
sell still have chances to play at
least a few games for Stanford
this year, but they're mighty slim.
Such was the word from the In
dians' trainer Connie Jarvis yes
terday.
"Yesterday we said, 'That's it.'
But today, well, we're more opti
mistic."
HINSHAW AND PI'HSELL suf
fered severely sprained knees in
Saturday's game against Wiscon
sin, and first word was that they
were out for the season. Hinshaw,
a 6-7, 230-pound tackle, is one of
the team's co-captains and was
being touted for Ail-American hon
ors. Pursell is 0-2' l>, weighs 219
and starts at center for the In
dians.
"We're not going to operate on
either one right away," Jarvis
said. "We're hoping we won't have
to."
Jarvis said it was possible that
either Pursell or Hinshaw might
be able to play in the last five
games, but it would be a miracle
if they played against Washington
in two weeks.
"IF THEY weren't seniors and

so vital to the team, they'd be out
for sure," Jarvis said. "We could
red-shirt them or something.
"But the way things stand now,
we're sure going to try to salvage
them if possible."
I linshaw's trouble a c t u a 11 y
stems from an injury he incurred
last year. He hurt his knee on the
first play of the Indians' first
game last year. He was allowed
to save his aligibility and use it up
this year.
Pursell and Hinshaw provided
most of the strength in the Indian
line. Besides their strong offen
sive play, they were vital cogs in
the Tribes' newly found defen
sive strength.
ODDLY ENOlHill, both have
relatives playing football for Stan
ford. Doug's brother Steve is a
207-pound end who has been see
ing a good deal of action on de
fense. and Dean's cousin Chet is a
201-pound end. Both Steve and
Chet are sophomores.
Last year, though ho still had a
year of college eligibility, Dean
Hinshaw was drafted by the San

Francisco 19ers. His tremendous
size and agility have made him a
top professional prospect.
Jarvis said that Mac Wylio, star
halfback for the Indians who lias
been out of the lineup with ;i
cracked toe, would see action
against the Air Force Academy
next Saturday in Denver.
".MAC could have played Satur
day," Jarvis said, "but we didn't
want to take any chances.
"We really want to see Hinshaw
and Pursell back in that lineup."
lie said. "Remember, there's ;il
ways Big Game."
