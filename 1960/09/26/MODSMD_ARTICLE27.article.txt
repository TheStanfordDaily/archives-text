# AFTER GAME
## Bruhn Cites Depth, Fine Quarterbacking 
### RUSS ALLEN 
While a dismal setting of gloom prevailed on the Stanford vside,
over in the visiting locker room a hunch of happy Wisconsin sopho
mores and a smiling Coach Mill Bruhn greeted the world after the
game Saturday.
Coming from behind after Stanford completely dominated first-

half stats to win going away
21-7, Ihe Wisconsin coach had .just
reason to he happy. His team
started only five letlermen, had
eighteen sophomores on the 38

man traveling squad and vol in
thai second hall' his men looked
like any Big Ten team should in
rolling over the Indians.
Coach Bruhn said ihat ho sub
stituted his first two units freely
in the first half and believed that
their relative freshness over the
Cards finally wore the Tribe line
down in the third quarter.
BIiUHX DID remark that he
thought the Tribe played a much
bettor defensive game in the line
this year than last but did not
pick out any individual Stanford
lineman as the cause.
The Indians ran up against a
different pass defense theory
from the Badgers than the one
they faced up in Spokane last
week against Washington State.

Bruhn counted on hisstrongseven I
man rush at times rather then
dropping back men to cover
Stanford receivers as did the
Washington Slate Cougars.
"Norman is tremendous, im
proved and runs heticr this year)
. . . and certainly Curtice's pass
patterns will bother people this
season," commented Bruhn, when
isked what lie thought of the
Indian grid future this year.
ItiU'HN WAS very happy with
his sophomore quarterback Ron
Miller wiui completed nine straight
passes, sparked two Badger touch
downs. and generally spearheaded
ihe group of sophs that seemed
to jell as soon as they got the
ball in the second half.
The temperature didn't bother
the Badgers in the game,although
their unit substitution was an im
portant factor.
Bruhn commented on the con
troversial "wild-card" substitu
tion rule i his year which enables
one player to he substituted on
each side every play besides the
normal substitution rules in ef
fect last year.
AI/ril6u(>!l he had heard that
coaches as USC's .Jim McKay and
OSC's Tommy Prothro -sending
in plays with the wild-card substi
tute. Bruhn left most of the play
calling to his quarterbacks Miller,
Jim Bakken and John Fabry.
Bruhn used his one-man substi
tution to send in wings or ends to
keep his receivers fresh.
Wisconsin, figured to being j
near the bottom of the pile in \
Big Ten standings this season, j
play Marquette next week and
the Badgers by getting better |
and better each week could beat i
some of their bigger brothers in I
Ihe Midwest this year.


MILT BRUHN
Happiness reigned
