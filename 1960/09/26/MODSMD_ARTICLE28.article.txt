third in ;i row to tin 1 Milwaukee Braves. 4-2, today on Eddie Mathews'
two-run homer in the 10th, but backed into their first National
League pennant in 33 years when the Cubs eliminated the second*
piace St. Louis Cardinals in nearby Chicago.
The Pirates, anxious to win their first title -since 1927 in cham-

pionship fashion, blow a 2-0 lead

walked off Pirate relief ace, Elroy
Face. Mathews hit Face's first
pitch high into the right field
bleachers to lift Milwaukee into
second place.
But the defeat didn't matter lie
cause the Cubs had beaten the
Cardinals .>0 about an hour be
fore this game ended. A short
time before that ihe scoreboard
told the Pirates they would be

Waner, and thin! baseman Pie
Traynor, were humiliated by one
of the greatest Yankee teams,
losing four in a row to Babe Ruth,
Lou Gehrig and company.
The Pirates arrived here with
a six-game winning streak and
cold champagne, anxious to wrap
up the title against the team that
had been the pro-season favorite,

runnerup spot and a bigger slice
of the World Series money, went
with their best lineup and swept
Ihe series.

the way. The Pirates built up
their 2-0 lead on Bill Mazcroski's
11th homer of the season in the
fifth, and a double by Smith in
the seventh that scored Roberto
(Memento who had singled.
Ironically, it was Smith who
permitted the Braves to tie the
score. After Del (Yandall had
scored Lee Mave with a sacrifice
fly in the eighth Smith tried to

pick Eddie Mathews off first ,
base and tho ball bounced off
Mathews' leg into right field.
Billy Brut on scored from second
base with the tying run.
