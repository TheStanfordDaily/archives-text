## 
### 
Members of Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity, whose house on the
upper row burned in August, will
live off-campus this quarter and
will be offered housing for winter
quarter in the Stanford Village.
In order that the fraternity can
be kepi together, the University
has provided the men with a
meeting place at Union for week
ly gatherings. Union will serve as
on-campus headquarters for the
Fijis.
The fraternity plans to continue j
\ with its intramural and social i
| activities as usual. The men will
| eat at Encina Commons.
After Ihe first cluster of fra
j ternity houses is completed in i
1962, the Fijis will be given one ■
of the vacated houses on the row, !
probably the one in best condition, j
Although they have been of
fered space in Stanford Village
once ii becames available, the
men have already indicated that
they aren't interested. It will be
al least five quarters before they •
will be able to move into a house
on the row.
