# Coach Says Cards Are 'Outmanned'
## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Superior Wisconsin manpower
which wore down the thin Stan-
I ford first string was blamed by
Coach Jack Curtice for the second
half collapse of his Indian squad.
"If only we could have played
them II for 11 like we did in the
first half," moaned Cactus Jack
in the dressing room after the
I game, "but we just haven't got
that kind of material to match
! those Big Ten teams."
C URTH 10 IIAI) no criticism for
I his "outmanned kids," who were
I hurt by serious injuries to key
linemen as well as the free pla
looning used by Badger Coach
I Milt Bruhn in the Sf> degree heat
of the stadium floor. "We played
a helluva first half but we just
ran out of air," he commented.
"Tliey were running 36 players
more than three full teams into
the game in one quarter, and
their third string was just as
good as their first string. I had to
use left tackles to play right
tackle and left ends to play right
end," Curtk-e added.
Asked why the Indians were
unable to stop Wisconsin quarter
back Ron Miller in the second half
after muffling him in the first
| two pei'iods, Curtice pointed out
that injuries to his two top line
men, Dean Hinshaw and Doug
Pursell, made it impossible for
the previously hard-pushing Stan
lord line to put pressure on the
1 opposing quarterback.
I DON'T know how long Ilin-
I shaw and Pursell will be out,"
commented Cactus Jack in the
I locker room. "Maybe two or three

weeks, maybe they're through for
the year, if thal's what Ihe Dor
says. That hurt us because it put
the pressure on the two sopho
mores in ihe secondary, Craig
and Hansel, and they had to cover
those tall, big ends (Pat Riehter,
(? 5'L». and Ron Staley C> 3>."
Other injuries to key personel
hurt the Stanfordites but did not
prove serious. John Bessey and
Dale Ostrander came up with leg
cramps. First string flanker back
Mac Wylie sat out the game but
should be ready at least by tlie
next home game. Skip Face
missed practice for the entire
week because of broken ribs and
his wife's new baby, and as a re
sult the normally reliable full
hack dropped three passes, one of
them a sure touchdown.
"\VK SIIOI U> ham: had three
touchdowns in the first half," re
called Coach Curtice. Resides the
dropped pass there was a fumble
by Dick Norman on the Wisconsin
three-yard line, and both Face
and Winters were in the clear but
didn't use their interference.
Curt ice didn't blame first string
quarterback Dick Norman for the
defeat. "He was passing well, but
ihe receivers dropped a lot of
passes," he added. "Rod Sears
looked pretty good, and he's a
good runner."
