## ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH, DEAR FRIENDS 
### Author of "I Was a Teen-age Dwarf", "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis", etc 
Today, if I am a little misty, who can blame mo? For today T
begin my seventh year of writing columns for 11 if makers of
Marlboro ( igarottes.
"■even years! Can it he possible? It seems only yesterday 1
walked into the Marlboro offices, my knickers freshly pressed,
my cowlick wetted down, my oilcloth pencil box clutched in
my tiny hand. "Sirs,"' I said to the makers of Marlboro- as
handsome an aggregation of men as you will find in a month
of Sundays, as agreeable as the cigarettes they make mild yet
hearty, robust yet gentle, flip-top yet soft pack "Sirs/' I
said to this assemblage of honest tobacconists, "I have come to
write a column for .Marlboro Cigarettes in college newspapers
across the length and breadth of this great free land of America."
We shook hands then silently, not trusting ourselves to
speak and one of the makers whipped out a harmonica and wo
sang sea chanties and bobbed for apples and played "Hun,
Sheep, Hun," and smoked good Marlboro Cigarettes until the
eampfire had turned to embers.
"What will you write about in your column?" asked one of
the makers whose name is Trueblood Strongheart.

"About the burning issues tliat occupy the lively mind< of
college America," I replied. "About such vital questions as:
Should the Student Council have the power to levy (axes?
Should proctors be armed? Should coeds go out for football?''
"And will you say a kind word from time to time about
Marlboro Cigarette?:,'' asked one of the makers whose name is
Honor Bright.
"Why, bless you, sirs," T replied, chuckling silverlv, "there
is no other kind of word except a kind word to say about,
Marlboro Cigarettes —the filter cigarette with the unfiltercd
taste that happy combination of delicious tobacco and ex
clusive select rate filter —t hat loyal companion in fair weather or
foul that joy of the purest ray serene."
There was another round of handshakes then and the makers
squeezed my shoulders and 1 squeezed theirs and then we each
squeezed our own. And then I hied me to my typewriter and
began the first of seven years of columning for the maker- of
Marlboro ('igarettes.
And today as I find myself once more at my typewriter, once
more ready to begin a new scries of columns, perhaps it would
be well to explain my writing methods. I use the term "writing
methods" advisedly because I am, above all thing-a methodical
writer. I do not wait for the muse: 1 work every single day of
the year. Sundays and holiday- included. I set myself a daily
quota and I don't let anything prevent me from achieving it.
My quota, to be sure, is not terribly difficult to attain (it is,
in fact. one word per day) but the important thing is that I do
it iiir// .• im/lt <la;/. This may -cent to you a grueling schedule
luit you must remember that some day- are relatively casv
for example, the day- on which I write "the" or "a". < >n these
day- I can usually fini-h my work by noon and can devote the
re-t of the day to happy pur-nit- like bird-walking, monopoly,
and smoking Marlboro Cigarettes.

Today, if I am a little misty, who can blame mo? For today T
begin my seventh year of writing columns for 11 if makers of
Marlboro ( igarottes.
"■even years! Can it he possible? It seems only yesterday 1
walked into the Marlboro offices, my knickers freshly pressed,
my cowlick wetted down, my oilcloth pencil box clutched in
my tiny hand. "Sirs,"' I said to the makers of Marlboro- as
handsome an aggregation of men as you will find in a month
of Sundays, as agreeable as the cigarettes they make mild yet
hearty, robust yet gentle, flip-top yet soft pack "Sirs/' I
said to this assemblage of honest tobacconists, "I have come to
write a column for .Marlboro Cigarettes in college newspapers
across the length and breadth of this great free land of America."
We shook hands then silently, not trusting ourselves to
speak and one of the makers whipped out a harmonica and wo
sang sea chanties and bobbed for apples and played "Hun,
Sheep, Hun," and smoked good Marlboro Cigarettes until the
eampfire had turned to embers.
"What will you write about in your column?" asked one of
the makers whose name is Trueblood Strongheart.

"About the burning issues tliat occupy the lively mind< of
college America," I replied. "About such vital questions as:
Should the Student Council have the power to levy (axes?
Should proctors be armed? Should coeds go out for football?''
"And will you say a kind word from time to time about
Marlboro Cigarette?:,'' asked one of the makers whose name is
Honor Bright.
"Why, bless you, sirs," T replied, chuckling silverlv, "there
is no other kind of word except a kind word to say about,
Marlboro Cigarettes —the filter cigarette with the unfiltercd
taste that happy combination of delicious tobacco and ex
clusive select rate filter —t hat loyal companion in fair weather or
foul that joy of the purest ray serene."
There was another round of handshakes then and the makers
squeezed my shoulders and 1 squeezed theirs and then we each
squeezed our own. And then I hied me to my typewriter and
began the first of seven years of columning for the maker- of
Marlboro ('igarettes.
And today as I find myself once more at my typewriter, once
more ready to begin a new scries of columns, perhaps it would
be well to explain my writing methods. I use the term "writing
methods" advisedly because I am, above all thing-a methodical
writer. I do not wait for the muse: 1 work every single day of
the year. Sundays and holiday- included. I set myself a daily
quota and I don't let anything prevent me from achieving it.
