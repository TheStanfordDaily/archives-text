NEW YORK <UPI> Indian
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
said yesterday that he has a
"good deal of admiration" for
United Nations Secretary-General
Dag Hammarskjold whose Congo
policies have been denounced by
the Communist bloc.
The neutralist leader declined,
however, to take a stand on So
viet Premier Nikita S. Khru
shchev's demand that Hammar
skjold be replaced by a three-man
executive committee that would
include Communist and Neutral
bl<>c i epiesen t atives.
"I should like to know more
about what Mr. Khrushchev said
before I could express any opin
ions." Nehru said. "It is not quite
clear how a group of three per
sons pulling in three directions
would function."
The Prime Minister met with
newsmen in a Manhattan hotel
after arriving earlier by plane
from India to take part in the

U.N. General Assembly session.
"The most important question
(before the U.N.) is disarma
ment," Nehru said. "It is a ques
tion largely of what possibly can
be found to deal with it."
Nehru will meet today in New
York with President Eisenhower.
He is also is scheduled to have
lunch today with British Prime
Minister Harold Macmillan.
Nehru indicated that he might
meet with Khrushchev tonight,
and possibly Marshal Tito of Yu
goslavia tomorrow.
He said Khrushchev had "ex
pressed a wish to see me."
Nehru declined to comment on
developments in the Congo which
led to Khrushchev's blasts against
Hammarskjold. He said lie did
not know the full facts of the
sit uat ion.
Nehru said that the emergence
of a large number of independent
African nations, together with
their critical problems, had "ere

ated a powerful impression on
India." He said he particularly
wanted to meet with the leaders
of these countries.
He said he considered it "rather
embarrassing" to be regarded as
a focal point of efforts to bring
the East and West together.
