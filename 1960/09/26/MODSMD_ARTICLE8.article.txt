# $25 Million Ford Grant Given Stanford
## Hailed as Challenge to Unlimited Opportunity 
### 
A $25 million grant by the Ford Foundation to Stanford Saturday
was hailed as "a tremendous challenge which opens the door to op
portunity unparalleled in Stanford's history," by President Wallace
Sterling.
The grant is the largest single unrestricted one ever given a uni-

versity, and is dependonl upon
Stanford's raising $75 million
under a three-for-one matching
requirement.
L'NDIOR terms of the agree
ment, Stanford has five years to
raise t he $73 million.
The University head confidently
predicted that Stanford could
muster the extra effort and
achieve the goal "hopefully in less
than four, rather than five, years.
"We're going after it and we're
goint to succeed," he told the
press conference.
Use of the foundation money is
left up to the school. The founda
tion agreed to advance Stanford
$1,075,000 to meet several im
mediate needs and for which
matching will be deferred.
or THIS, $250,000 will ho for
I faculty and salary increases,
$375,000 for renovation of class
i room and laboratory space, $50,-
000 for library books, $100,000 for
architectural planning of high
priority buildings including the
long - needed undergraduate li
brary and $300,000 toward a new
physics building.
Commenting on the award,
Sterling said "Stanford is deeply
grateful to the foundation not
only for its great generosity but
also for its recognition that our
faculty and students are worthy
of this order of support.
"The foundation is literally
making an investment, in Stan
ford's future and in our ability to
justify large-scale support from
other donors. This is a tremen
dous challenge and I am confi
dent we can meet it."
Under the University's tenta
tive plans, the largest share
about one-third- of the prospec
tive money would be used for
strengthening the faculty through
salary gains, new appointments
and establishment of additional
distinguished professorships.
OTHER major shares would be
used for erasing the sea is of long
deferred maintenance and for
renovation on Quad, and for new
construction.
Library operations, administra
tive services and student aid would
get most of the balance.
Referring to the student aid,
Sterling said: "Our real objective
is to organize student aid so that
any well qualified kid who wants
a Stanford education will not be
denied it."
While unexpected, the Ford
bonanza did not catch the Uni
versity unprepared.
"AS WK CAMK to the end of
the fifties," Sterling said, "we
began an 18-month study of our
goal, our resources, our needs.
We did a lot of homework, and
then along came the Ford Foun
dation with this proposal."
Explaining Stanford's choice.
Henry T. Heald, president of the
foundation, said, ". . . we sought
private universities already em
barked on future - development
: programs commensurate in scope,
imagination, and practicability to
the vast needs of American so
ciety."
In accepting the Ford offer.
Sterling declared "The scale of
our projected financial growth
springs from a conviction that
strong, privately-supported higher
education is essential to all higher
education, and that in the West
a strong Stanford is indispens
i able."
Sterling sketched the following
as some of the Stanford academic
goals for the 10 years ahead:
1.) Continued emphasis on un-
I dergrad education. More student
[ faculty contacts.
2.) Strengthening of liumani
i ties departments to bring them
! into balance with engineering,
j medicine and the natural sciences,
| for which external funds are more
i readily available.
M.) Building more bridges be
tween the humanists and the sci
entists by appointing broadly ed
ucated people to the faculty and
extending the practice of inter
depart mental appoint ments.
I.) (Jiving increased consider
ation to study on non-western na
tions.
!i.) Further strengthening of
professional schools and increased
emphasis on advanced graduate
education.

A $25 million grant by the Ford Foundation to Stanford Saturday
was hailed as "a tremendous challenge which opens the door to op
portunity unparalleled in Stanford's history," by President Wallace
Sterling.
The grant is the largest single unrestricted one ever given a uni-

versity, and is dependonl upon
Stanford's raising $75 million
under a three-for-one matching
requirement.
L'NDIOR terms of the agree
ment, Stanford has five years to
raise t he $73 million.
The University head confidently
predicted that Stanford could
muster the extra effort and
achieve the goal "hopefully in less
than four, rather than five, years.
"We're going after it and we're
goint to succeed," he told the
press conference.
Use of the foundation money is
left up to the school. The founda
tion agreed to advance Stanford
$1,075,000 to meet several im
mediate needs and for which
matching will be deferred.
or THIS, $250,000 will ho for
I faculty and salary increases,
$375,000 for renovation of class
i room and laboratory space, $50,-
000 for library books, $100,000 for
architectural planning of high
priority buildings including the
long - needed undergraduate li
brary and $300,000 toward a new
physics building.
Commenting on the award,
Sterling said "Stanford is deeply
grateful to the foundation not
only for its great generosity but
also for its recognition that our
faculty and students are worthy
of this order of support.
"The foundation is literally
making an investment, in Stan
ford's future and in our ability to
justify large-scale support from
other donors. This is a tremen
dous challenge and I am confi
dent we can meet it."
Under the University's tenta
tive plans, the largest share
about one-third- of the prospec
tive money would be used for
strengthening the faculty through
salary gains, new appointments
and establishment of additional
distinguished professorships.
OTHER major shares would be
used for erasing the sea is of long
deferred maintenance and for
renovation on Quad, and for new
construction.
Library operations, administra
tive services and student aid would
get most of the balance.
Referring to the student aid,
Sterling said: "Our real objective
is to organize student aid so that
any well qualified kid who wants
a Stanford education will not be
denied it."
While unexpected, the Ford
bonanza did not catch the Uni
versity unprepared.

Commenting on the award,
Sterling said "Stanford is deeply
grateful to the foundation not
only for its great generosity but
also for its recognition that our
faculty and students are worthy
of this order of support.
"The foundation is literally
making an investment, in Stan
ford's future and in our ability to
justify large-scale support from
other donors. This is a tremen
dous challenge and I am confi
dent we can meet it."
Under the University's tenta
tive plans, the largest share
about one-third- of the prospec
tive money would be used for
strengthening the faculty through
salary gains, new appointments
and establishment of additional
distinguished professorships.
OTHER major shares would be
used for erasing the sea is of long
deferred maintenance and for
renovation on Quad, and for new
construction.
Library operations, administra
tive services and student aid would
get most of the balance.
Referring to the student aid,
Sterling said: "Our real objective
is to organize student aid so that
any well qualified kid who wants
a Stanford education will not be
denied it."
While unexpected, the Ford
bonanza did not catch the Uni
versity unprepared.
"AS WK CAMK to the end of
the fifties," Sterling said, "we
began an 18-month study of our
goal, our resources, our needs.
We did a lot of homework, and
then along came the Ford Foun
dation with this proposal."
Explaining Stanford's choice.
Henry T. Heald, president of the
foundation, said, ". . . we sought
private universities already em
barked on future - development
: programs commensurate in scope,
imagination, and practicability to
the vast needs of American so
ciety."
In accepting the Ford offer.
Sterling declared "The scale of
our projected financial growth
springs from a conviction that
strong, privately-supported higher
education is essential to all higher
education, and that in the West
a strong Stanford is indispens
i able."
Sterling sketched the following
as some of the Stanford academic
goals for the 10 years ahead:
1.) Continued emphasis on un-
I dergrad education. More student
[ faculty contacts.
2.) Strengthening of liumani
i ties departments to bring them
! into balance with engineering,
j medicine and the natural sciences,
| for which external funds are more
i readily available.
M.) Building more bridges be
tween the humanists and the sci
entists by appointing broadly ed
ucated people to the faculty and
extending the practice of inter
depart mental appoint ments.
I.) (Jiving increased consider
ation to study on non-western na
tions.
!i.) Further strengthening of
professional schools and increased
emphasis on advanced graduate
education.
