### SCOTTY THOMPSON Political Union President 
(Editor's Note: This is the first
of a two-part article by Political
Cnion President Scotty Thomp
son. The articles will cover the
program and philosophy of I'oliti- !
cal Union.)
With a national campaign rush
ing ahead, and with a latent politi
cal interest among Stanford stu
dents in recent quarters, the Po
litical Union is planning an ambi
tious program for the year ahead:
hoping to stimulate, clarify and
broaden political thinking on cam
pus in all directions.
Present program plans include
men as far to the right as William
Knowland and as far 1o tin 1 left
as "Soapy" Williams or Harry
'I: uman, or men as serious as the
Socialist poet, Kenneth Roxaell,
and on the other hand, hopefully,
Mort Sahl.
The organization itself is set
up for the student body to provide
a varied program on current polit
ical and social issues. It was the
Political I nion that sponsored the
Nixon and Kennedy appearances!
of last year. The organization, in
its eight year history, has thrived
during election years, but has ;
normally reduced its activity in 1
off-years.
But with campus observers j
across the country predicting the
students of the sixty's to show a
far more vigorous political inter
est than his predecessors of the
forty's and fifty's, our plans for I
1 his year are aimed at creating a
Political Union that will be a po
tent focus of campus thought at
any time as at Yale or Oxford.
Our primary plans are con
cerned with the national cam
paign. The year will begin to
night with an Open Debate and
w ill end before the Reg Dance.
This Thursday, Michigan's six
term governor, "Soapy" Williams,
will deliver an address in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium. Although lie
has not yet announced the sub
ject of his talk, it is certain to be
controversial.
On October 5, Chester Bowles,
tlx 1 successful chairman of the
Platform Committee at the duly
Cos Angeles Convention, will de-j
liver a major address in Mem
And, at 3 p.m., co-sponsored with
the Citizenship Clearing House.)
Later in the month, Governor!
ilatficld of Oregon will deliver an :
address. Stanley Mosk, Attorney
General of California, will also
speak.
On Oct. Ifi, Bishop James Pike
will speak in Cubberley on "Poli
tics and Religion." He recently!
published book considering the •

[ wisdom of choosing a Catholic
! President, and will center his lalk
on this issue. Following his
speech, there will lie four dis
! cussion groups, debating his po
j sition. Sign-up sheets will be
| posted on Quad earlier thai week.
The Discussions Committee of
Poly Union will be planning many
more discussions during the cam
paign on issues such as "Divided
Government," where 112 acuity
members or bay-area figures will
be engaged to lead discussions.
Two faculty debates are being
planned before November 0, one
revolving around the two candi
dates, the other around the two
plat forms.
Incorporated within the Politi
cal Cnion are the caucuses, which
can present issues from their re
spective viewpoints, although by
Cniversity statute, cannot engage
in partisan activity. The Demo
cratic Caucus will debate with the
Republican Caucus, and will pre
sent independent programs, using
campus talent or such men as Ted
Kennedy. The Socialist < aliens
also has a series of programs for
the fall ranging from the alterna
tive to war to the Socialist choice
iu the coming election.
The caucuses will be advert is
! ing their meetings broadly and it
; is hoped students interested in
(political issues and activity will
take part in these programs. Stu
dents may also receive activity
credit units for this, as well as
all Political Union work.
A new part of the Political
Union's expanded program is
"Poly Union in the laving
(»roups," under tbe chairmanship
of Carol Forbes. The committee
will try to bring campaign discus
sions to all living groups, fresh
men in particular, during the cam
paign. and will expand, hopefully,
to living groups all over the cam
pus.
Climaxing our campaign activ
ity will be a "straw vote" on elec
tion day, where students may vote
either for Kennedy or Nixon, or
may write in candidates. Since
such does not count, it is hoped
that students will register pro
tests if so inclined by writing in
| a man who stand? for a particular
j ideology.
After the tumult and shouting
dies down, Professor Otis Pease
will discuss the significance of the
election on November 16.
(Tomorrow. Thompson will eon
| tinue his discussion of the Polif
j ical Union program for the year,
which includes a major forum
and a possible \isil I coin Presi
dent llarry Truman, lie will also
briefly discuss Poly I nion pliil
