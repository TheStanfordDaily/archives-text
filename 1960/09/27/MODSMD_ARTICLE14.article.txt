# United States Must Help Stop African Problems
## 
### DAVE FRENCH IIR Political Analyst 
"The common cause of the
darker races against the intoler
able assumption and insults of!
Europeans has already found ex- j
pression. Most men in the world !
are colored. The future world will,
in all reasonable probability, be
what colored men make it."
Could this quotation be drawn
from the speech of Ghana's
Kwame Nkrumah before the!
United Nations General Assembly
last week? It is quite possible. !
But in point of fact, those words
were spoken forty-five years ago
by the "father" of Pan-African
ism. an American Negro by the
name of W. E. B. Dußois. The!
African nationalism which is
achieving such a remarkable
fruition in the current U.N. ses
sion has deep roots.
To b<» sure, this movement lias
progressed tar since its concep
tion at the beginning of the cen
tury. At that time, a West Indian
barrister convened a conference
in l.ondon which served primarily
as a means of protesting the pol
icies of colonialists of that day.
Little came of the gathering, the
barrister passed away shortly
thereafter, and the Pan-African
concept remained dormant until
it was revived by Dr. Dußois
nearly two, decades later.
Dußois' first Pan-African Con
gress met in Paris during the
peace conference of 1919. Its most
immediate concern was to effect
international supervision of for
mer German colonies. In addition,
however, the delegates adopted a
resolution embodying broad de
mands concerning the rights of
"natives of Africa and the peoples
of African descent" in such areas
as capital management, labor, ed
ucation, and politics. The pattern
of Pan-Africanism, a pattern em
bracing colored peoples anywhere
in the world, had been established.
Today, there are many factors
contributing to African solidarity.
Some of these are the organiza
tions which work to coordinate
economic development, industrial
management training, and politi
cal direction in various regional
groupings. But more significant,
today as at the beginning of the
century, is the spiritual momen
tum which seeks to throw off the
shackles which Africans feel they
have been subjected to by the
colonial powers. And this drive
transcends geographical or polit
ical boundaries. As Ja.ja Wachu
ku, speaker of the Nigerian House
of Representatives, told a NAACP
rally this summer, "We look upon
our independence in October as a ;
means to an end ... an attempt
to raise all peoples of African de
scent to a position of respecta
bility." J
This aspiration, or more limited
aspects nl it, will seemingly be
directed through the United Na
tions to a large degree. This is to
be fervently hoped for, at least;
and such would seem to be tin*
direction of the policies enunci
ated by President Eisenhower
and the African delegates at the
U.N. last week Only in this way I

can the grasping hands of Mos
cow, IViping, and Cairo be effec
tively barred from the African
cookie jar.
In the future, of course, the
bogey of colonialism will fade
from view in much of Africa; and
this will be the critical period for
Pan-Africanism. A community of
economic and political interest
must be cultivated to prevent the
chaos which could otherwise de
velop at that time from the wran
glings of the Nkrumahs, the
Toures, the Mboyas. We should
help, in other words, to provide
the substance for such dreams as
that of Tanganyika's Julius
Nyercre:
"We must create an Africa
which the outside world will look
at and say, 'Here is a continent
i hat has truly free human beings.
If you wanl to see a people who
live up to their ideals of human
society go to Africa! That is Ihe
Continent of Hope for the human
race.' "

To b<» sure, this movement lias
progressed tar since its concep
tion at the beginning of the cen
tury. At that time, a West Indian
barrister convened a conference
in l.ondon which served primarily
as a means of protesting the pol
icies of colonialists of that day.
Little came of the gathering, the
barrister passed away shortly
thereafter, and the Pan-African
concept remained dormant until
it was revived by Dr. Dußois
nearly two, decades later.
Dußois' first Pan-African Con
gress met in Paris during the
peace conference of 1919. Its most
immediate concern was to effect
international supervision of for
mer German colonies. In addition,
however, the delegates adopted a
resolution embodying broad de
mands concerning the rights of
"natives of Africa and the peoples
of African descent" in such areas
as capital management, labor, ed
ucation, and politics. The pattern
of Pan-Africanism, a pattern em
bracing colored peoples anywhere
in the world, had been established.
Today, there are many factors
contributing to African solidarity.
Some of these are the organiza
tions which work to coordinate
economic development, industrial
management training, and politi
cal direction in various regional
groupings. But more significant,
today as at the beginning of the
century, is the spiritual momen
tum which seeks to throw off the
shackles which Africans feel they
have been subjected to by the
colonial powers. And this drive
transcends geographical or polit
ical boundaries. As Ja.ja Wachu
ku, speaker of the Nigerian House
of Representatives, told a NAACP
rally this summer, "We look upon
our independence in October as a ;
means to an end ... an attempt
to raise all peoples of African de
scent to a position of respecta
bility." J
This aspiration, or more limited
aspects nl it, will seemingly be
directed through the United Na
tions to a large degree. This is to
be fervently hoped for, at least;
and such would seem to be tin*
direction of the policies enunci
ated by President Eisenhower
and the African delegates at the
U.N. last week Only in this way I

can the grasping hands of Mos
cow, IViping, and Cairo be effec
tively barred from the African
cookie jar.
In the future, of course, the
bogey of colonialism will fade
from view in much of Africa; and
this will be the critical period for
Pan-Africanism. A community of
economic and political interest
must be cultivated to prevent the
chaos which could otherwise de
velop at that time from the wran
glings of the Nkrumahs, the
Toures, the Mboyas. We should
help, in other words, to provide
the substance for such dreams as
that of Tanganyika's Julius
Nyercre:
"We must create an Africa
which the outside world will look
at and say, 'Here is a continent
i hat has truly free human beings.
If you wanl to see a people who
live up to their ideals of human
society go to Africa! That is Ihe
Continent of Hope for the human
race.' "
"The common cause of the
darker races against the intoler
able assumption and insults of!
Europeans has already found ex- j
pression. Most men in the world !
are colored. The future world will,
in all reasonable probability, be
what colored men make it."
Could this quotation be drawn
from the speech of Ghana's
Kwame Nkrumah before the!
United Nations General Assembly
last week? It is quite possible. !
But in point of fact, those words
were spoken forty-five years ago
by the "father" of Pan-African
ism. an American Negro by the
name of W. E. B. Dußois. The!
African nationalism which is
achieving such a remarkable
fruition in the current U.N. ses
sion has deep roots.
