We're hack in school and tln* time has conic to open tip The I'ress
hox for another year. Before rushing into the Fall Sports Scene here
at the Farm, let's look hack sit summer activities and especially the
performances ol Stanford athletes in the trials and finals of the !!)(»<)
Olympics (.anit's.
This summer the track Final trials were hero in the Stadium and
.'ill who saw were very impressed with the athletes' performances at
the fine meet put on by Payton Jordan, Jim Terill, Don Liehendorfer,
Dick Barnes and others.
In the track trials, Lrnie Ciinliffc's team placing showing:,in the
S0(l meters came as expected lint shotpntler Jerry Winter's effort —of
almost (50 feet —went by almost unnoticed behind the tosses of Messrs.
Long, O'Brien, Davis and Xieder. Winters —currently playing end for
Jack Curt ice—was t lie second best collegiate putter, behind s< "s Dallas
Long, and should give the Trojan a lot of competition in the NCAA
meet this spring. John Kelly was another Stanford athlete in the trials
last July hot he too did not make tile trip to Koine.
Besides Cunliffe Stanford had two swimmers who competed and
won medals for the U.S. in Rome. George Harrison and Paul Hail both
picked up gold medallions.

Besides the track and swim
ming stars, Stanford's Kent Mitch
ell, Conn Findlay and Dick l>rae
ger piloted and propelled the cox
with two shell to a bronze medal
oil Lake Alba no. Mitchell, a Stan
ford senior, coxswained both Find
lay and Draeger lo the third place
finish behind the (Hermans and
Russians.
Mitchell had quite a bit to say
about his experiences during their
trials, Olympic Rowing, and life
at the Village.
lie said that Findlay and Drae
ger had been working out for the
games since January when most
( alil'ornians were traveling to
Squaw for the Winter Olympics.
They approached Kent —who had
been a cox on one of the Varsity
eight-man shells last spring—in
May—and he started in the new
task with workouts on Seattle's
Lake Washington Kowing Club

Down to 110 Pounds
Mitchell who normally weighs in at around 130 lbs. found that
both Findlay and Draeger were not going to let him get into the shell
weighing more than 110 lbs. during the whole series ol trials and
finals. He said this was the only drawback of his whole trip.
The three men trained together through June and the fiist of July
up North then moved to Syracuse July 7-X-5) where they won tin* pre
liminary heat and t he 112 inal. After being outfitted tor the 112 rip w illi Ihe
U.S. uniforms, blazers, etc., the boys returned tor more practice. I he>
left New York August IMt-li and after twice-a day rowing sessions on
Lake Albano, they eventually were beaten by tile favored Germans
and a surprising group from Russia in flic finals.
Kent pointed out that the real reason for German success in the
six-odd crew events in the Olympics was not their new and contro
versial oars but rather their precision and training. "Germany has
approximately 300 active rowing clubs with top coaches to our eleven.'
explained Kent, "and have a lot better rowing conditions on their
lakes."
Germany had used oars with a shorter, fatter blade but their better
training and organization enabled them to row away from anyone they
faced because of their faster stroke. The Germans used a stroke of
from 10 to IS which means they dipped their oars ten more times a
minute than any U.S. crew can do at present.
Friendliness af fhe Village
Mitchell commented on the friendliness of other athletes at the
Olympic Village. He enjoyed swapping pins and bags as well as shop
talk with members of other teams. The Village was a complete town
within itself with each country having its own dorms, post office and
there were stores, a bank and dining rooms for the athletes.
One of several reasons given for the I'.S collapse in the Games and
especially in the track events was their wild living in Koine.
Kent repudiated these accusations and said thai there was a strict
lights-out policy at 10 o'clock and because all the U.S. male athletes
were housed together it would have been very hard for individuals
to break training and do all the after-hour "sightseeing" that they
were accused of without others seeing them. Also Kent remarked that
there was too much to do to get in trouble. Training, talking with
other teams and sightseeing kept the U.S. team members very busy.
Right now Kent is starting classes with the rest of us but already
he is thinking of getting hack at the Germans and Russians in file
1984 Olympics. His shellniate Findlay will still lie around coaching
the Frosli Crew and is on the lookout for another medal-winning crew
for those same Games during !!)(>! in Tokyo.

Kent pointed out that the real reason for German success in the
six-odd crew events in the Olympics was not their new and contro
versial oars but rather their precision and training. "Germany has
approximately 300 active rowing clubs with top coaches to our eleven.'
explained Kent, "and have a lot better rowing conditions on their
lakes."
Germany had used oars with a shorter, fatter blade but their better
training and organization enabled them to row away from anyone they
faced because of their faster stroke. The Germans used a stroke of
from 10 to IS which means they dipped their oars ten more times a
minute than any U.S. crew can do at present.
Friendliness af fhe Village
Mitchell commented on the friendliness of other athletes at the
Olympic Village. He enjoyed swapping pins and bags as well as shop
talk with members of other teams. The Village was a complete town
within itself with each country having its own dorms, post office and
there were stores, a bank and dining rooms for the athletes.
One of several reasons given for the I'.S collapse in the Games and
especially in the track events was their wild living in Koine.
Kent repudiated these accusations and said thai there was a strict
lights-out policy at 10 o'clock and because all the U.S. male athletes
were housed together it would have been very hard for individuals
to break training and do all the after-hour "sightseeing" that they
were accused of without others seeing them. Also Kent remarked that
there was too much to do to get in trouble. Training, talking with
other teams and sightseeing kept the U.S. team members very busy.
Right now Kent is starting classes with the rest of us but already
he is thinking of getting hack at the Germans and Russians in file
1984 Olympics. His shellniate Findlay will still lie around coaching
the Frosli Crew and is on the lookout for another medal-winning crew
for those same Games during !!)(>! in Tokyo.

We're hack in school and tln* time has conic to open tip The I'ress

at the Farm, let's look hack sit summer activities and especially the
performances ol Stanford athletes in the trials and finals of the !!)(»<)
Olympics (.anit's.
This summer the track Final trials were hero in the Stadium and
.'ill who saw were very impressed with the athletes' performances at
the fine meet put on by Payton Jordan, Jim Terill, Don Liehendorfer,
Dick Barnes and others.
In the track trials, Lrnie Ciinliffc's team placing showing:,in the
S0(l meters came as expected lint shotpntler Jerry Winter's effort —of
almost (50 feet —went by almost unnoticed behind the tosses of Messrs.
Long, O'Brien, Davis and Xieder. Winters —currently playing end for
Jack Curt ice—was t lie second best collegiate putter, behind s< "s Dallas
Long, and should give the Trojan a lot of competition in the NCAA
meet this spring. John Kelly was another Stanford athlete in the trials
last July hot he too did not make tile trip to Koine.
Besides Cunliffe Stanford had two swimmers who competed and
won medals for the U.S. in Rome. George Harrison and Paul Hail both
picked up gold medallions.

Besides the track and swim
ming stars, Stanford's Kent Mitch
ell, Conn Findlay and Dick l>rae
ger piloted and propelled the cox
with two shell to a bronze medal
oil Lake Alba no. Mitchell, a Stan
ford senior, coxswained both Find
lay and Draeger lo the third place
finish behind the (Hermans and
Russians.
Mitchell had quite a bit to say
about his experiences during their
trials, Olympic Rowing, and life
at the Village.
lie said that Findlay and Drae
ger had been working out for the
games since January when most
( alil'ornians were traveling to
Squaw for the Winter Olympics.
They approached Kent —who had
been a cox on one of the Varsity
eight-man shells last spring—in
May—and he started in the new
task with workouts on Seattle's
Lake Washington Kowing Club

Down to 110 Pounds
Mitchell who normally weighs in at around 130 lbs. found that
both Findlay and Draeger were not going to let him get into the shell
weighing more than 110 lbs. during the whole series ol trials and
finals. He said this was the only drawback of his whole trip.

last July hot he too did not make tile trip to Koine.
Besides Cunliffe Stanford had two swimmers who competed and
won medals for the U.S. in Rome. George Harrison and Paul Hail both
picked up gold medallions.

Besides the track and swim
ming stars, Stanford's Kent Mitch
ell, Conn Findlay and Dick l>rae
ger piloted and propelled the cox
with two shell to a bronze medal
oil Lake Alba no. Mitchell, a Stan
ford senior, coxswained both Find
lay and Draeger lo the third place
finish behind the (Hermans and
Russians.
Mitchell had quite a bit to say
about his experiences during their
trials, Olympic Rowing, and life
at the Village.
lie said that Findlay and Drae
ger had been working out for the
games since January when most
( alil'ornians were traveling to
Squaw for the Winter Olympics.
They approached Kent —who had
been a cox on one of the Varsity
eight-man shells last spring—in
May—and he started in the new
task with workouts on Seattle's
Lake Washington Kowing Club

Down to 110 Pounds
Mitchell who normally weighs in at around 130 lbs. found that
both Findlay and Draeger were not going to let him get into the shell
weighing more than 110 lbs. during the whole series ol trials and
finals. He said this was the only drawback of his whole trip.
The three men trained together through June and the fiist of July
up North then moved to Syracuse July 7-X-5) where they won tin* pre
liminary heat and t he 112 inal. After being outfitted tor the 112 rip w illi Ihe
U.S. uniforms, blazers, etc., the boys returned tor more practice. I he>
left New York August IMt-li and after twice-a day rowing sessions on
Lake Albano, they eventually were beaten by tile favored Germans
and a surprising group from Russia in flic finals.
Kent pointed out that the real reason for German success in the
six-odd crew events in the Olympics was not their new and contro
versial oars but rather their precision and training. "Germany has
approximately 300 active rowing clubs with top coaches to our eleven.'
explained Kent, "and have a lot better rowing conditions on their
lakes."
Germany had used oars with a shorter, fatter blade but their better
training and organization enabled them to row away from anyone they
faced because of their faster stroke. The Germans used a stroke of
from 10 to IS which means they dipped their oars ten more times a
minute than any U.S. crew can do at present.
Friendliness af fhe Village
Mitchell commented on the friendliness of other athletes at the
Olympic Village. He enjoyed swapping pins and bags as well as shop
talk with members of other teams. The Village was a complete town
within itself with each country having its own dorms, post office and
there were stores, a bank and dining rooms for the athletes.
One of several reasons given for the I'.S collapse in the Games and
especially in the track events was their wild living in Koine.
Kent repudiated these accusations and said thai there was a strict
lights-out policy at 10 o'clock and because all the U.S. male athletes
were housed together it would have been very hard for individuals
to break training and do all the after-hour "sightseeing" that they
were accused of without others seeing them. Also Kent remarked that
there was too much to do to get in trouble. Training, talking with
other teams and sightseeing kept the U.S. team members very busy.
Right now Kent is starting classes with the rest of us but already
he is thinking of getting hack at the Germans and Russians in file
1984 Olympics. His shellniate Findlay will still lie around coaching
the Frosli Crew and is on the lookout for another medal-winning crew
for those same Games during !!)(>! in Tokyo.
