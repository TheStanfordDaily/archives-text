## GRID Practice Report 
### 
The shift from daylight savings
lime to tho standard variety has
caught the varsity football squad
out in the cold these days as a
good part of the Indians' daily
practice sessions are now spent
in the grimmer parts of twilight.
Yesterday the starters got a
break from the- shivering and. !
after practicing punts and field j
goals for an hour, they went in- 1
side where it was warm.
Coach Jack Curtice then re- i
mained with the third and fourth
strings and for an hour and a
half watched them knock heads. 1
This* is standard procedure for I
Monday practice.
Curtice's big problem at the |
moment is that of figuring out i
just who is going to fill the giant- ]
sized gaps in the line left by Ihe 1
untimely departure of Dean Hin- ,
shaw and Doug Pursell. The I
starting center and guard were j
both injured in tho Wisconsin !
game Saturday.
So far it looks like Chris Cottle !
and Eri'ol Scott will split the cen- ;
tor duties and any of three sopho- i
mores could fill in for Hinshaw.
Randy Vahan, Bob Drakulich i
and C. 15. Simons will see duty in j
the tackle spot.
