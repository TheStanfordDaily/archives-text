# Pirates Try to Explode Old World Series Myth
## 
### 
NEW YORK il'Pri The Pitts
burgh Pirates will try to live
down one of the oldest myths in
World Series history this year:
; that they quit to the mighty Yan
kees in the 1927 classic.
That was another generation of
Pirates, of course, hut tho onus
| of the four-game sweep they suf
fered at I lie hands of the '27 Yan
kees remains a black mark in the
club's history. It was the first
time a National League team ever
, lost four straight in ihe Series.
TIIE STOKY that the Pirates
"gave up" before a ball was
pitched in the first game has
come down to the modern genera
tion because of the home-run
show staged by the Yankees'
Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in bat
ting practice before the Oct. 5
i opener in Pittsburgh.
The two sluggers sent drive
after drive into ihe distant right

! tiee while Paul and Lloyd Waner.
a pair of 150-pounders, and other
j Pirates watched in amazement.
But the facts are that the Yan
kees didn't out-slug the Pirates at
all they won the Series on pitch
i ing and defense. The Yankees hit
j only two home runs in the Series,
both by Ruth, and won by scores
i of 5-4,'6-2, 8-1 and 4-3.
The Yankees were confident
I so confident that some experts
thought it could cost them the
| Series. They had set an American
i League record by winning 110
j games and they won the flag by
| 19 games. Ruth has hit 60 homers
; and Gehrig had driven in 175 runs
I and hit 47 homers. They were so
1 physically superior to the modest
! sized Pirates that it looked like
â€¢'the men were playing the boys."
KUTII SUM3IIOi) up the Yan

kees' attitude when a Pittsburgh
newspaperman told him before
the first game that the Pirates
had eight good pitchers.
"What good is that gonna do
'em in a four-game series?"
snorted Ruth.
The Yankees won the first
game with the aid of three un
earned runs. First, P. Waner
misser a shoe-string catch on a
short fly by Gehrig producing a
run-scoring triple in the first in
ning.
Then errors by George Grant
ham and Earl Smith treated Ihe
Yankees to three runs and a l-l
lead in the third. Waite Iloyt went
7 1 ;; innings and Wiley Moore, the
brilliant New York relief special
ist, finished up.
(iEOKGE I'IPGIiAS pitched a
seven hitter in the second game
for the Yankees, whose 11 -hit at
tack was led by Mark Koenig's
three hits and two hits each by
Bob Meusel and Tony Lazzeri.
The third game was even worse.
Herb Pennock pitched a no-hitter
for 7' ; innings for the Yankees,
who wrapped up the game with a
six-run seventh-inning rally cli
maxed by Ruth's three-run homer.
Lee Meadows, first big leaguer
ever to wear glasses, had made
Ruth look foolish the first three
times he batted but Babe caught
hold of a fast ball by Mike Cven
gros on his fourth try and losl one
in the Yankee Stadium's right
field bleachers.
THE SEKIES ended on Oct. 8
at Yankee Stadium when John
Miljus uncorked a wild pitch in
the ninth inning, the ball bounc
ing off catcher Johnny Gooch's
knees and rolling toward short
stop. as Earl Combs scored the
tie-breaking run from third base.
