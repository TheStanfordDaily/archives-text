# Nixon, Kennedy Clash Over Nation's Ability To Battle Communism
## TV Debate Viewed by Millions 
### 
CHICAGO < UP!) Vice Presi
dent Richard M. Nixon and Sen.
John F. Kennedy came to grips in
an unprecedented face to face de
bate last night on the issue of how
to keep the United States strong
enough to withstand the threat of
Communist Russia.
Kennedy said "1 do not think we
are doing enough" to keep the na
tion moving. "I am not satisfied
as an American with the progress
we are making," he said.
Nixon retorted "We are ahead of
the Russians" and charged that the
programs Kennedy has urged to
spur the nation's economic growth
"will lead to stagnation of the mo
tive power which we need so badly
in this country."
AN ESTIMATED (50 to 100 mil
lion Americans halt the nation's
population tuned in their tele
vision sets and radio stations on
modern history's first head-on de
bate between the two major can
didates for President of the United
States.
The candidates came closest 1o
taking the gloves off on the issues
of national strength, executive ex
perience, farm policy and social
welfare legislation.
Kennedy, first speaker in the
hour-long debate by virtue of a
coin toss, departed immediately
from Ihe pre-arranged topic of do
mestic affairs because "the ques
tion this year is whether the world
can exist half slave, half free."
Kennedy said ho could not bo
satisfied with the state of the na
tion with 50 per cent of its steel
mill capacity unused, "the lowest
rate of economic growth of any
major industrialized society," and
S9 billion worth of surplus food
stored in government storage
houses.
CALUN'ti for effective govern-
I mental action, Kennedy said "1
j think we can do a better job I
| think we are going to have to do
| a better job to meet the responsi
bilities which time and events
have placed upon us."
Nixon agreed that international
| issues are tied to any debate on
j national affairs and that the na
! tion must keep moving.
"When you are ahead the only
| way to stay ahead is to move
! ahead," ixon said.
But he rejected what he s;iid
was Kennedy's implication "to the
1 effect that the United States has
j been standing still."
The record of the Eisenhower
i Administration is not one of
standing still. Nixon said, adding
"Good as this period is. it isn't
enough. A record is never some
thing lo stand on. It is something
to build on."

John F. Kennedy came to grips in
an unprecedented face to face de
bate last night on the issue of how
to keep the United States strong
enough to withstand the threat of
Communist Russia.
Kennedy said "1 do not think we
are doing enough" to keep the na
tion moving. "I am not satisfied
as an American with the progress
we are making," he said.
Nixon retorted "We are ahead of
the Russians" and charged that the
programs Kennedy has urged to
spur the nation's economic growth
"will lead to stagnation of the mo
tive power which we need so badly
in this country."
AN ESTIMATED (50 to 100 mil
lion Americans halt the nation's
population tuned in their tele
vision sets and radio stations on
modern history's first head-on de
bate between the two major can
didates for President of the United
States.
The candidates came closest 1o
taking the gloves off on the issues
of national strength, executive ex
perience, farm policy and social
welfare legislation.
Kennedy, first speaker in the
hour-long debate by virtue of a
coin toss, departed immediately
from Ihe pre-arranged topic of do
mestic affairs because "the ques
tion this year is whether the world
can exist half slave, half free."
Kennedy said ho could not bo
satisfied with the state of the na
tion with 50 per cent of its steel
mill capacity unused, "the lowest
rate of economic growth of any
major industrialized society," and
S9 billion worth of surplus food
stored in government storage
houses.
CALUN'ti for effective govern-
I mental action, Kennedy said "1
j think we can do a better job I
| think we are going to have to do
| a better job to meet the responsi
bilities which time and events
have placed upon us."
Nixon agreed that international
| issues are tied to any debate on
j national affairs and that the na
! tion must keep moving.
"When you are ahead the only
| way to stay ahead is to move
! ahead," ixon said.
But he rejected what he s;iid
was Kennedy's implication "to the
1 effect that the United States has
j been standing still."
The record of the Eisenhower
i Administration is not one of
standing still. Nixon said, adding
"Good as this period is. it isn't
enough. A record is never some
thing lo stand on. It is something
to build on."
