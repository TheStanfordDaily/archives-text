## 
### United Press International 
Fidel Castro yesterday said
Cuba was "seriously considering"
demanding United States with
drawal from Ihe Guantanamo
Naval Base and threw his support
behind the entire Soviet diplo
matic program before the United
Nations.
In a marathon four-hour and
28-minute speech to the U.N. Gen
eral Assembly, the bearded Cuban,
sometimes repeating himself, as
sailed United States dealings with
Cuba from the 19th Century to
date. Ho repeated every charge
he ever has made in his anti-
American harangues in Havana.
The Assembly president had to
reprimand him when he tried to
| bring in the American presiden
j tial campaign.
The Soviet Union applauded
â–  lustily. The United States said he
; was playing a broken record.
Neutralists were bored.
CASTKO accused the United
States of maintaining the $70
million Guantanamo base for ag
gressive purposes and "to justify
an attack on our country."
He paid high personal tribute
to his bear-hugging new friend,
Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khru
shchev, and said Cuba supports
without reservation the Russian's
plan for total disarmament with
in four years. Significantly, how
ever, he did not once mention Dag
Hammarskjold, the U.N. secre
tary-general whom Khrushchev
wants dismissed.
After finishing his speech, Cas
tro returned immediately to his
Harlem hotel. He entered quickly
between a double line of Cuba
security agents backed by New
York police. High police brass, in
cluding the police commissioner
and the chief of detectives, were
i on hand.
C'ASTItO blamed Ihe U.S. for
i the deaths of "scores of Cubans"
j killed in raids on sugar fields by
i planes and the mysterious explo
! sion of a French munitions ship
! in Havana harbor.
He accused Sen. Styles Bridges.
R-N.H., of the Senate Armed
Services Committee of threaten
j ing Cuba with atomic weapons.
He ridiculed President Eisen
hower's $500-million aid plan for
; Latin American development and
derided the President's offer of
U.S. particpation in a stand-by
U.N. force.
He also attacked Ihe U.S. presi
. dential candidates, Vice President
Richard M. Nixon and Sen. John
F. Kennedy to such a violent de
gree that he was called to order
by General Assembly President
I Frederick H. Boland.
I'IAKUKH in the day,Secretary
jGeneral Dag Hammarskjold
[ spurned Khrushchev's demand
i I hat he resign and reaffirmed im
partial United Nations principles
I in a moving speech that drew a
table-pounding outburst from the
! displeased Russian.
As Western and many neutral
: delegates erupted in thunderous
I applause for the U.N. chief, Khru
| shchev pounded an anvil chorus
I of disapproval with his lists on
I the desk in front of him.
As though surprised. Foreign
| Minister Andrei Gromyko stopped
I clapping to join in the pounding
i and soon the entire nine-member
Russian delegation was hammer
ing away in a rendition that lasted
i 2~) seconds after the Western ap
: plause ceased.
Khrushchev at one point had a
' on his face, but he said
| later that he was registering his
i opposition to Hammarskjold and
the Secretary-General's policies in
the Con^o.
