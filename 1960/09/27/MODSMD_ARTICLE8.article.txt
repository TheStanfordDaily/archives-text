# Students Crowd TV Sets To Watch Historic Debate
## 
### 
Some of the campus might have been getting in its last social fling
before classes begin, but a Daily spot check of University living
groups last night revealed a majority watching the historic Nixon-
Kennedy debate.
On the Row ;nd in the dorms the story was the same a group

huddled around the television set.
At 'Francos, in Wilbur, il was
a noisy, cheering crowd of 50
people, many with Branner dates,
who enjoyed making jokes about
the candidates mistakes.
I'iI.SI'yWUMRK on campus the
audiences were more solemn. In
Stern's Serra House, more than
100 silently listened to the debate,
with only an occasional laugh,
Michael Randall reported.
At Iloble Ihe small audience of
less than 30 was attributed to the
freshman testing program run
ning concurrent with the debate.
On the Row and at the eating
clubs the audiences were the
largest, percentage wise. Most of
them had at least half of their
membersh ip watch ing.
LATH KOI* House reported 23,
Hurlburt House 22. Theta Chi 20
most serious and eager to get
off the phone and back to the
debale.
Comments on the quality of the
debate ran along partisan lines,
with most Republicans believing
Nixon came off best and Demo
crats favoring Kennedy.
Two Serra listeners had differ
ent reactions. Randall, a Demo
crat, believed "Both made a good
general impression, aside from
their nervousness. They handled
themselves very well both ap
pear to be very well experienced."
KANDAIJj said he did not be
lieve the debates influenced parti
san voters. "Foi someone who
agreed with either candidate's
point of view was swayed." Ran
dall said, "but I don't know how
much an independent's vote was
influenced."
One Republican, Rob Mushen,
said, "I'm disappointed in Nixon.
I feel that he is leaning too much
on supporting tlie last administra
tion iihl not giving his own ideas
on the subject.
"I am looking forward to the
foreign policy debate, which I
think Nixon will win," he said.
