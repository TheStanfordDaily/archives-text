# Stanford-in-Tokyo Plans Announced
## Japanese Center Due To Open Early April 
### 
Stanford's burgeoning overseas program look a giant step for
ward yesterday with the announcement that the University's first
combined undergraduate-graduate study center will open in Tokyo
next April 1.
Unlike the Stuttgart, Tours and Florence blanches, there will be
no campus in Tokyo. Undergrads will attend classes at Waseda Uni
versity, while grad students will enroll at the University of Tokyo
because Waseda has no graduate school.
The pioneer class, chosen from students interested primarly in
East Asia and Japan, will be made up of 10 undergraduates and five
gi aduates. Dr. John D Goheen, head of the Philosophy Department
and chairman of the faculty committee which chose the site, said
that the I niversity hopes to expand the center to 13 or more students
within five years.
STANFORD TODAY and Tomorrow speakers revealed that plans

for a Tokyo extension were being
stidied in their talks last winter
quarter.
Tokyo will be the third over
sous branch to open within l'ive
months. Tours and Florence are
preparing to handle their first
classes next Monday.
Students at the Jap a nose
branch will pay the same tuition,
room and board fees as those at
Stanford-in-Palo Alto. However,
in another departure from the
European campuses, these fees
also will cover transportation to
and from Japan. Students in Eu
rope must find their own way
back.
Another change will allow the
Tokyo group to -stay one year in
stead of six months, as in Europe.
Graduates may be able to stay
; even longer.
WOMEN students will be
housed in a dormitory at Waseda
University and the men in a pri
vately endowed dormitory near
the Waseda campus.
Married graduate students will
be responsible for finding their
own quarters, but information
concerning housing will be avail
able at the center.
The students will take as many
of their meals as possible with
the Japanese students, although
diet problems will probably re
quire some meals to be arranged
just for the Stanford group at the
university faculty club.
BETWIiIiN semesters at the
University, students will be free
to travel or do whatever they pre
fer, but will be responsible for
their living costs during the
break.
The center will conduct some
programs be t we en semesters.
Most scholarships will remain in
effect while the students are
abroad, and loan funds and some
grants-in-aid to cover expenses
such as travel are expected to be
made available for those needing
them.
The curriculum for undergrads
will be arranged to meet individ
ual programs. Grad students will
have their study mapped out in
dividually. Approximately 50 per
cent of the time will be spent in
language training.
Aplications for the first session

Graduate Division, room 2K. They

They must provide themselves
with passports, take the required
innoculations, participate in pre
paratory sessions and be ready to

Stanford's burgeoning overseas program look a giant step for
ward yesterday with the announcement that the University's first
combined undergraduate-graduate study center will open in Tokyo
next April 1.
Unlike the Stuttgart, Tours and Florence blanches, there will be
no campus in Tokyo. Undergrads will attend classes at Waseda Uni
versity, while grad students will enroll at the University of Tokyo
because Waseda has no graduate school.
The pioneer class, chosen from students interested primarly in
East Asia and Japan, will be made up of 10 undergraduates and five
gi aduates. Dr. John D Goheen, head of the Philosophy Department
and chairman of the faculty committee which chose the site, said
that the I niversity hopes to expand the center to 13 or more students
within five years.
STANFORD TODAY and Tomorrow speakers revealed that plans

for a Tokyo extension were being
stidied in their talks last winter
quarter.
Tokyo will be the third over
sous branch to open within l'ive
months. Tours and Florence are
preparing to handle their first
classes next Monday.
Students at the Jap a nose
branch will pay the same tuition,
room and board fees as those at
Stanford-in-Palo Alto. However,
in another departure from the
European campuses, these fees
also will cover transportation to
and from Japan. Students in Eu
rope must find their own way
back.
Another change will allow the
Tokyo group to -stay one year in
stead of six months, as in Europe.
Graduates may be able to stay
; even longer.
WOMEN students will be
housed in a dormitory at Waseda
University and the men in a pri
vately endowed dormitory near
the Waseda campus.
Married graduate students will
be responsible for finding their
own quarters, but information
concerning housing will be avail
able at the center.
The students will take as many
of their meals as possible with
the Japanese students, although
diet problems will probably re
quire some meals to be arranged
just for the Stanford group at the
university faculty club.
BETWIiIiN semesters at the
University, students will be free
to travel or do whatever they pre
fer, but will be responsible for
their living costs during the
