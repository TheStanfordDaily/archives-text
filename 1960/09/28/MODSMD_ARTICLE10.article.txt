# It's Not the Last

### 
The fir-l Nixon-Kennedv debate took place Monday night and
for all intents and purposes it might as well he the last.
Location of the debate was a Chicago studio which is normally
used for wrestling shows, hut the candidates did little more than
111Â«r at a couple of sensitive political hairs.
ll was obvious from the outset that neither candidate was go
ing to risk hi- political future by stating; anything of a truly con
troversial nature. The topi< was supposed to be domestic issues
lint odd l\ enough Kennedv and \i\on did not consider civil rights
a national problem. The problem of segregation was never men
tioned. Ihe word itself was never mentioned.
Hotli men stressed the same ideas they have been expressing
in their aerial campaigns across the country.
kennedv pointed out that he is not satisfied with I'.S. progress.
\i\on disagreed. Kennedy called for more governmental action
on such things as aid to education and the farm problem. Nixon
disagreed. Kennedv claimed that the Democrats have done a
belter job in the J twentv years than the Republicans. Nixon
disagreed.
Hoth stated that they have bad comparable experience, some
thing wliieli few people any longer doubt. This was never an issue
in the first place and the sooner forgotten the better.
Nixon managed to get in a few innuendos as could be expected.
\t one point he said: '"1 know what it is to he poor." Ihe infer
ence is ob\ ions. At another point he stated that he has been in
the executive branch of government while Kennedy has spent his
lime in the legislative branch. Again the inference is ob\ ions.
One political observer compared the show to the early rounds
of a prize fight with the opponents boxing careful!) and feeling
out each other's strength without getting into a real slugging
match. I his is a good appraisal, only quite often prize fights never
get rolling. The combatants feel each other out for ten or more
rounds and no one w ins.
I nless the ne\t three rounds of the \ixon-Kennedy battle be
come a little bit more ferocious, neither candidate is going to
gain a verdict from the people, who. by the way. stand to be the
real losers.
