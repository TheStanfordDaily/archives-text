# SHERRY WELCH
## Stop and Perceive 
### 
Cro-Magnon man's painted bi
son, Egypt's pyramids. Athens'
Parthenon, the Nike from
Samothraee, the plays of Euripi
des, the Byzantine Hagia Sophia,
Reims Cathedral, Leonardo's Last
Supper, the Sistene Chapel. . . .
Herein are reflected, embodied,
the ideals, the spirit, the dreams
of men. Records of the pulse of
rial ions.
The unify and commitment of a
national and individual ideology,
of a new spirit—it's constantly
stressed —we must formulate to
meet flie communist challenge.
And we grope in search of such
an ideology, striving through •'du
ration, through inner examina
tion, through religion to attain it.
Vet this necessary spirit al
ready exists—and a concrete em
bodiment of it. an embodiment
which we should stop our groping |
long enough to perceive.
If we were simply to shift our
focus from nebulous discussion j
to taking a close look at the near
by, the obvious, at the products—
artistic, scientific, intellectual—
of our society. But then look past
the immediate reality of the ex
ternals of these products to per
ceive the pulse, the dreams, the
spirit of our society embodied |
within them.
As Ortega V.C.asset says: "Take
:i garden seen through a window.
Looking at the garden we adjust
our eyes in such a way that the
ray of vision travels through the
pane without delay and rests on
the shrubs and flowers. Since we
are focusing on the garden and
our ray of vision is directed to
ward it, we do not see the window
hut look clear through it. The
purer the glass, the less we see it.
Itnt we can also deliberately dis
rcgard the garden and, withdraw
ing the ray of vision, detain it
:it the window. We then lose sight
ot the ciirden: what we still lw

hold of if is a confused mass of
color which appears pasted jo the
pane."
The window — the w i n d o w
through which we should train
ourselves to look could be ex
ternal reality - the reality of a
sculptured form, of a painting, of
a play, of a building, of a scien
tific accomplishment.
In music Debussy led the way,
in poetry Mallarme led the way,
in art, likewise, the romanticists
instilled spirit in their work. They
recorded the pulse of their so
ciety. The guitarists followed
eventually Balla. Severini, Du
champ. Boccioni, Brancusi. The
dynamism of the twentieth cen
tury was what they created in
their works the spirit of their
times not the external reality.
Too often t Me average person
is. incapable or unwilling to try to
partake of the sacrament of art,
especially of Ihe art of the pres
ent. We enjoy the painting of the
Renaissance, the works of the
ancients. We analyze other so
ciety's through their aesthetic ac
complishments. But we often fail
to analyze our own, fail to feel
for our own pulse, by trying to
understand and look at the
aesthetic as if is embodied in the
products of our society.
Trying to understand modern
art, to understand ihe language
of organic architecture but it
goes beyond thai. 11 means seeing
the embodiment of our spirit in
all things in the towering build
ings, in the beeps from the sput
niks encircling the earth, in Ihe
roar of a rocket taking off. in the
clean sweeping lines of the IT-2.
It means looking from the Re
vival Givek and Romanesque
architecture of the City Hall to
the jet soaring overhead as it
climbs upward the product of
our society climbing toward the
heavens.
