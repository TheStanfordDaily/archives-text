# Forum, Possible Truman Visit Feature Program

### SCOTTY THOMPSON Political Union President 
(Editor's Note: This is Hie sec
ond of a two-part arti«l«» on this
year's Political Union program
and philosophy.)

Poly Union's program will
broaden in many directions. For
instance, in lale November, we
are co-sponsoring with the 1111 a
speech by Chief-Inspector Sullivan
of the FBI, who will talk on the
dangers of "student participation
in demonstrations, and the dan
gers there of Communist organ
izing." Students will remember
t lie prime example of such demon
strations, when the House Un-
American Activities Committee
was in San Francisco last spring, j
In the winter, we are planning i
another new phase of activity, al
though one not new to many cam- j
puses: two "Discussions of Basic
Issues" similar to the "Challenge" |
programs pioneered at Yale. The !
first will be January 24-25 on
Education, and will present Ihe
great educator and spokesman,
Robert Ilutchins, who is currently
president ol the Fund for the Re
public.
Perhaps the most ambitions
plan of the year so far is for a
major forum on "The Responsi
bility of the American Press in
Politics." After a few months
time, when the sting of the cam
paign is gone and issues are
clearer and clean« ■, if wiil »?- time
to look in retrospect at Hie role of
the press in the campaign. Was I
: the victor aided or hindered by the i
so-called "one-party press?" Is re
porting honest or slanted to the
views of those supporting the
press i t se I I—the1 —the advertisers?
These and many other questions
will Ih» considered and discussed
at this February forum, to which
Allen Drury, Palmer Hoyt (Edi
j tor, the Denver Post), and YV'il
j liani Knowland (Ass't. Publisher,
The Oakland Tribune) have been
! invited. Also to be invited is the
press agent of the defeated can- I
didate, as well as bay-area report
; ers and critics. As with the Educa- i
tion forum, there will be a major :
speech, several panels, and nil- i
nierous small discussions, both
after major meetings, and in liv-1
ing groups.
Tentatively, that month will

| also include a visit by Harry
! Truman who, upon retirement,
promised to "devote himself to
the education of American Youth
j in Politics."
I In the spring, we plan to hold
a "Political Institute" similar to
the Foreign Policy Institute of
the IIR. No speaker has yet been
invited for this, as it hinges on
the results of the November elec
tion. We would hope to have a
man prominent, or of recent
prominence, in American politics
on campus for a large part of a
week to speak and to meet infor
mally as much as possible with
students on campus.
Student participation, not ,jusf
through attendance, but in voicing
of views, is our goal. One has only
to look at similar organizations al
; Oxford or Cambridge to see how
effeelive we could be. There, every
•
national politician is anxious to
j speak, lor the voice of the stu
dents is powerful. II is sobering
; to consider what other groups of
students have done throughout
j the world ibis past year: two gov
ernments were overthrown by
students, and many others have
1 toppled with the aid of students.
In this atomic age, i( is essential
that the future leaders of our
country begin early in forming
and expressing opinions, if Ibis
country is to maintain a position
j of leadership. With Stanford sup
plying so many of these very
men, il is equally essential lhat
such interests continue to develop
1 al Stanford. The proper channels
do exist.

I In the spring, we plan to hold
a "Political Institute" similar to
the Foreign Policy Institute of

prominence, in American politics
on campus for a large part of a

mally as much as possible with
students on campus.
Student participation, not ,jusf
through attendance, but in voicing
of views, is our goal. One has only
to look at similar organizations al
; Oxford or Cambridge to see how
effeelive we could be. There, every

national politician is anxious to
j speak, lor the voice of the stu
dents is powerful. II is sobering
; to consider what other groups of
students have done throughout
j the world ibis past year: two gov

students, and many others have
1 toppled with the aid of students.
In this atomic age, i( is essential
that the future leaders of our
country begin early in forming
and expressing opinions, if Ibis
country is to maintain a position
j of leadership. With Stanford sup
plying so many of these very
men, il is equally essential lhat
such interests continue to develop
1 al Stanford. The proper channels
