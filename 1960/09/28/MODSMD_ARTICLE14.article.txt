# Snap Judgments Indicate Nixon, Kennedy Fail To Hurt Themselves in Initial Political Debate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (DPI) Snap
judgments from politicians in
both parties suggested that nei
ther Presidential nominee won
(he 19G0 election in their first
national debate and that neither
was hurt very badly, if at all.
Campaign managers in both
parlies had suffered from a case of
nerves as they awaited Monday
night's radio-television debate be
tween Vice President Richard M.
Nixon, the Republican Presiden
tial candidate, and Sen. John F.
Kennedy, the Democratic nomi
nee.
Both sides breathed more easily
after the debate, in which I he
candidates spurred cautiously and
seemed somew hat nervous lest a
slip of the tongue bring disaster.
"If the fight had been judged
on points, Nixon might have had
the edge," was one Democratic
comment. "If you listened to hol
lers from Ihe crowd, we might get
the edge."
This Democrat said he would
give Kennedy points for contrast
ing the record of the Democratic
and Republican Parties on wel
fare legislation without drawing a
direct reply from Nixon.
A Republican wanted to give
Nixon points for asserting that

the Democratic Platform would
inflate the Federal Budget by 13
to IS billion dollars a year com
pared with increased costs of four
to five billion dollars for the GOP
program.
These Nixon estimates drew no
direct reply from Kennedy, who
did argue, however, that a faster
rale of national economic growth
would yield more lax revenue to
finance the programs he favors.
Although both parties wel
comed the free time given by the
networks, one question asked in
political circles was what per
centage of the TV audience stuck
with the show through the entire
hour?

Another question was whether
the two and one-half minutes al
lowed for a candidate i<> answer
a question and one and a half
minute to comment on the rival's
answer gave the nominees ample
time to make their views clear?
If the pace semed too fast, the
format presumably could be al
tered lo allow more lime for an
swers in the iwo or three debates
still to come.
The debate gave ihe candidates
a chance to reach the biggest au
dience measured in lens of mil
lions over available to two men
matched in a political campaign.
Vol noil her used ihe opportunity
to try to drop a block-buster.
