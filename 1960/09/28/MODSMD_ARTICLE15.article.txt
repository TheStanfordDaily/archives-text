### TOD HINDIN 
Stanford's freshman football team, tho most highly touted year
ling squad in recent years, has begun practice for what many ex
peris deem a winning and possibly undefeated season.
The youthful team, which numbers 84 and includes members from
15 states, looked very impressive in opening drills. The squad, a

result of a new rigorous recruit
ing policy of tho Alumni and
Coaching Staff, includes 17 all
slate or all-star pigskiners. Coach
Dan Stavely, who hopes to open
his premiere season as freshman
coach with a victory over San
Jose State, October 1described
the boys as "large, strong and
with a lot of hustle."
Speediest of the swift aggrega
tion is Colorado prep sprint star
Chris Babbs who will play flank
er back in the free-wheeling Car
dinal aerial attack. Chris holds
three prep sprint records with a
9.7 100, a 21.2 220, and a 48.7 440,
iill of which were set in the same
meet.
OF TIIK frosh schedule consist
ing of San Jose State, UCLA, SC
and Cal, it is the majority opinion
of the coaching staff that South
ern Cal will be the toughest. How
ever Coach Stavely is optimistic
that his team can lace any oppo
nent and emerge victorious.
Among the hardest workers in
the opening drills were Ruff All
dors, an all-state guard from Mid
land, Texas, and Frank Pata
toucho, a rugged end from Los
Angeles.
Frosh footballers will be taught
fundamentals in the opening
drills by a coaching staff headed
by Coach Stavely, and including
Jack Marrin, Ric McMullin, Billy
Stevens and Bill Donahue.
Stavely, in his second year on
the Indian coaching staff, was
an assistant varsity mentor last
season. Previously he was on the
coaching staffs of Washington
for ten years. Denver for two and
Eastern Washington for three.
NO member of the squad will
be cut and it is hoped by the
coaching staff that all will stick
it out and matriculate to Cactus
Jack's varsity. After Saturday's
opening scrimmage, the squad
will be formed into approximately!
six strings, with each given a
chance to play in one of the four
frosh tes 1 s.

and star halfback from Pendle
ton, Oregon; Bill Hanking, all
state halfback from Wyoming;
Dennis Twitchell, star guard from
Santa Maria, California; Don
