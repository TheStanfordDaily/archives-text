# Battle-Weary Cards Face Mayo, Falcons
## 
### 
A beaten and battered bunch
of Stanford football players will
run up against the high-flying
Air Force Academy in Denver-
Saturday.
Indian Coach Jack Curtice will
try to put together some sort of a
line to face the Falcons and he is
going 1o rely heavily on a group
of untested sophomores to fill in
the gaps left by the injuries to
his starting center and tackle.
Doug Pursell and Dean Hinshavv.
SOPHS ('. K. Simons. Boh Dra
kulieh and Randy Vahan will
probably split the tackle duties,
while juniors Chris Cottle and
Errol Scott will have to fill Pur
sell's shoes.
The Falcons are a formidable
ball club and are sure to enter
the game odds-on favorites to
present the Tribe with its third
straight defeat. As one of San
Francisco's better sportscribes
put it, "Last week Stanford was
beaten by a quarterback nobody
ever heard of. This week they'll
probably lose to one whom every
body knows."
Thai well known signal-caller
is Rich Mayo, ;i prime candidate
for Ail-American honors. Last
week, against Colorado State for

| instance, Mayo threw touchdown
passes of 11, 16 and 24 yards,
: while connecting on 20 out of 30
I passes for 197 yards. lie is also
! a strong runner.
THE OTHER members of the
Falcon hackfield aren't slouches
either, with Don Baucom and
| Mike Quinlan at the halfback
I slots and Chris Dixon at fullback.
Baucom averaged an excellent
1.6 yards per carry last year.
Quinlan ran for an average of 4.5 i
yards per try.
Dixon, who has reportedly
beaten out last year's starting
fullback, Monte Moorberg. for the
number one spot, was a spring
training sensation.
THINGS AKE not all darkness
on the Stanford front, however,
as the Indian' will finally have
the services their ace halfback
and pass Mac Wylie. Out
with a ('"V, ;s.ed toe up to now,
this first start.
