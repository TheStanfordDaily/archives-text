NEW YORK (UPI) President
Eisenhower dealt Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev a stinging dip
lomatic defeat yesterday and won
a thunderous ovation from hun
dreds of thousands overflowing
the sidewalks of New York.
Before he returned to Washing
ton, Eisenhower rejected a pro
posal that he meet with the Soviet
Premier. Khrushchev, who ear
lier indicated he also was opposed
to a meeting, modified his stand
last night while making the
rounds of diplomatic receptions.
In shifting position, Khrush
chev hinted he might be willing
to meet with Eisenhower, but that
the initiative would have to come
from l he President.
"IT is NOT I who destroyed
relations," Khrushchev said. "It
was those who sent the l T -2 plane.
The initiative should go to the
side which caused a break in the
discussions. We want peace and
friendly relations with all na
tions."
The Russian leader made his
remarks to members of the Uru
guayan delegation to the United
Nat ions.
New Yorkers poured out of of
fice buildings to cheer the Presi
dent as he left the Waldorf-As
toria Hotel in a motorcade and
drove to Newark Airport.
