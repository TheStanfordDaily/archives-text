# U.N. VOTE
## Committee Backs U.S. On China 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. lUPI >
The General Assembly's steer
ing committee hist night en
dorsed a U.S. proposal to shelve
for the rest of this session the
question of ousting Nationalist
China from the United Nations in
favor of the Chinese Communist.
The vote was 12 to 7. with 1
abstention.
The U.S. resolution now faces
a test in the full General Assem
bly. It was designed to kill Rus
sia's proposal for a full debate on
the Chinese representation issue.
It also would have the world par
liament decide "not to consider
at its 15th regular session any
proposals to exclude the repre
sentatives of the Government of
the Republic of China or to seat
representatives of the Central
People's Government of the Peo
ple's Republic of China."
RUSSIA counted on the influx
of new members 13 from Africa
and Cyprus to cut down, if not
reverse, the 44 to 2S vote by
which the Assembly upheld a sim
ilar U.S. resolution last year.
U.S. Ambassador .lames J.
Wadsworth put the issue before
the 21-nation committee, presided
over by Assembly President
Frederick H. Boland. who nor
mally does not cast a vote.
Without making any mention
of India which in previous years
had called for admission of the
Peiping regime Wadsworth told
the 21-member committee that
the Chinese Communists "By
armed incursions have been push
ing southward from Tibet to ex
tend control over other nations."
Voting for last night's U.S. reso
lution were Canada. Nationalist
China, Costa Rica, France. Haiti.
Italy, Japan, Pakistan, Panama,
Britain, the United States and
Venezuela. Opposing it were Bul
garia, Ceylon, Iraq, Romania, Su
dan. Russia and Yugoslavia.
Libya abstained.
The China question was the
main topic at the meeting of the
steering committee which has the
job of determining the agenda for
the assembly as a whole.
"Here is Communist China,"
Wadsworth said, "a land 8,000
miles from the Congo, which never
had relations of any consequence
with the Congo or nearby areas,
which has seen fit to vilify the
United Nations and its distin
guished Secretary-General."
Soviet Ambassador Valerian A.
Zorin retorted, in effect, that the
United States was no better than
Communist China in its interna
tional conduct. He referred to
Cuban Premier Fidel Castro's
castigation of the United States
in the assembly vesterday.

It also would have the world par
liament decide "not to consider
at its 15th regular session any
proposals to exclude the repre
sentatives of the Government of
the Republic of China or to seat
representatives of the Central
People's Government of the Peo
ple's Republic of China."
RUSSIA counted on the influx
of new members 13 from Africa
and Cyprus to cut down, if not
reverse, the 44 to 2S vote by
which the Assembly upheld a sim
ilar U.S. resolution last year.
U.S. Ambassador .lames J.
Wadsworth put the issue before
the 21-nation committee, presided
over by Assembly President
Frederick H. Boland. who nor
mally does not cast a vote.
Without making any mention
of India which in previous years
had called for admission of the
Peiping regime Wadsworth told
the 21-member committee that
the Chinese Communists "By
armed incursions have been push
ing southward from Tibet to ex
tend control over other nations."
Voting for last night's U.S. reso
lution were Canada. Nationalist
China, Costa Rica, France. Haiti.
Italy, Japan, Pakistan, Panama,
Britain, the United States and
Venezuela. Opposing it were Bul
garia, Ceylon, Iraq, Romania, Su
dan. Russia and Yugoslavia.
Libya abstained.
The China question was the
main topic at the meeting of the
steering committee which has the
job of determining the agenda for
the assembly as a whole.
"Here is Communist China,"
Wadsworth said, "a land 8,000
miles from the Congo, which never
had relations of any consequence
with the Congo or nearby areas,
which has seen fit to vilify the
United Nations and its distin
guished Secretary-General."
Soviet Ambassador Valerian A.
Zorin retorted, in effect, that the
United States was no better than
Communist China in its interna
tional conduct. He referred to
Cuban Premier Fidel Castro's
castigation of the United States
in the assembly vesterday.
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. lUPI >

ing committee hist night en
dorsed a U.S. proposal to shelve
for the rest of this session the
question of ousting Nationalist
China from the United Nations in
favor of the Chinese Communist.
The vote was 12 to 7. with 1
abstention.
The U.S. resolution now faces
a test in the full General Assem
bly. It was designed to kill Rus
sia's proposal for a full debate on
the Chinese representation issue.
It also would have the world par
liament decide "not to consider
at its 15th regular session any

sentatives of the Government of
the Republic of China or to seat
