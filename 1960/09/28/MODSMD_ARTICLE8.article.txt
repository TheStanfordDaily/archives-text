## First Chapparal Hits Campus Today Sporting New Look; It Makes Very Little Difference 
### ELLINGTON K. FARTHINGALE 
The first issue of Chaparral is
out today and (here will un
doubtedly be more later in Hie
year, although no one will go in
sane if there aren't.
In an effort to reverse the trend
of sagging sales, The Chappie has
instituted a number of changes,
but to no avail. If they really
wanted to produce a good humor
magazine they could have simply
copied an old Lampoon or Pelican
and simply have changed all the
Harvards and Californias to Stan
fords.
()N( K VOI recover from"The
Beginning of the Ilainbow," you
look behind it and discover the
"Jabberproffy," a fail'attempt at
translating Lewis Carroll's "Jab
berwocky." People shouldn't fool
around with Carroll.
Carroll was ;i very confused
man. Anybody who writes about
nice little girls talking to screwy
hares and disappearing Cheshire

cats can't be all there. The person
I who wrote that junk on the in
| side cover isn't all there either.
Actually, if you read it about a
dozen times, it begins to make
sense, but who has time?
Bill Kitchen, illustrious editor,
informs us at the end of his two
bits' worlh that "tis better to
have lived and laughed than never
to have lived at all." Sounds like
a threat. Okay, okay, I'm laugh
ing.
BY NOW, you're ready to give
up but something forces you to
go on, hoping you didn't blow
your forty cents in vain. Bv the
way, The Chappie used to be
thirty-five cents, but now that
you are getting serious material
instead of the normal funny stuff
you must pay more.
Anyhoo, you go on and on. '
through "Stanfordismla." "Is ii
Worlh It?" iit most certainlv
isn'ti and other assorted trash, j
and then you hit your forty cents
worth, llcr name i>s Valerie Jan-

| /en and lor once we must agree
| with the OJcJ Hov she really is
a creature of rare beauty. See
you in the library, kiddies.
"OXCK UPON a Pillow" is
pretty funny but the boys botched
it up by messing up the last
quote. I'll "lieve" you alone in a
sec, bovs.
Nothing much else worth wast
ing space on. except to make men
tion of the joke section. What
lewd fellow's. Nasty, nasty, gentle
men, you might have the admin
istration to contend with it you
don't use a little soap. They even
thought three jokes were so funny
that they ran them twice. You
guys should know that once a day
is enough.
Some of the advertisements are
pretty funny but the staff prob
ably couldn't help that. You might
as w ell buy The Chappie anyway,
just so the boys can scrape up
enough dough to give it another
try. The next issue certainly has j
to be an improvement.

"OXCK UPON a Pillow" is
pretty funny but the boys botched
it up by messing up the last
quote. I'll "lieve" you alone in a
sec, bovs.
Nothing much else worth wast
ing space on. except to make men
tion of the joke section. What
lewd fellow's. Nasty, nasty, gentle
men, you might have the admin
istration to contend with it you
don't use a little soap. They even
thought three jokes were so funny
that they ran them twice. You
guys should know that once a day
is enough.
Some of the advertisements are
pretty funny but the staff prob
ably couldn't help that. You might
as w ell buy The Chappie anyway,
just so the boys can scrape up
enough dough to give it another
try. The next issue certainly has j
to be an improvement.
The first issue of Chaparral is
out today and (here will un
doubtedly be more later in Hie
year, although no one will go in
sane if there aren't.
In an effort to reverse the trend
of sagging sales, The Chappie has
instituted a number of changes,
but to no avail. If they really
wanted to produce a good humor
magazine they could have simply
copied an old Lampoon or Pelican
and simply have changed all the
Harvards and Californias to Stan
fords.

Beginning of the Ilainbow," you

"Jabberproffy," a fail'attempt at

around with Carroll.
Carroll was ;i very confused
man. Anybody who writes about
nice little girls talking to screwy
hares and disappearing Cheshire

cats can't be all there. The person
I who wrote that junk on the in

Actually, if you read it about a

sense, but who has time?
Bill Kitchen, illustrious editor,
informs us at the end of his two

have lived and laughed than never
to have lived at all." Sounds like
a threat. Okay, okay, I'm laugh

up but something forces you to
go on, hoping you didn't blow
your forty cents in vain. Bv the
way, The Chappie used to be
thirty-five cents, but now that
you are getting serious material
instead of the normal funny stuff
you must pay more.
