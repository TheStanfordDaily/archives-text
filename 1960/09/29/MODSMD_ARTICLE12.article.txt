NEW YORK (UPI) — Vice
President Richard M. Nixon,
drawing ever-increasing crowds
campaigned in heavily-Republican
Long Island tonight defending the
administration's stand against
communism.
In a hid for the suburban vote,
Nixon also outlined a seven-point
program for "urban transfor
mation."
NIXON drew cheers in Hicks
ville and Mincola in Nassau
County when he denounced "ap
peasement" of the Communists
and called for "keeping the peace
without surrender."
"People are making a mistake
in blaming our country and our
President for what the Commu
nists are doing. We're not going
to change our policies to what
the Communists would like, be
cause if we do that means sur
render."
NIXON also reiterated his ear
lier statements that President Ei
senhower should not have been
expected to "apologize" to Soviet
Premier Nikita Khrushchev for
the U-2 flight in order to save the
Paris summit conference.
"That would not have saved the
conference," Nixon shouted, "it
would only have made him ask
for more."
The political coolness mani
fested by small crowds which
heard Nixon earlier in Queens
Borough of New York City
warmed up as he traveled further
east on Long Island.
