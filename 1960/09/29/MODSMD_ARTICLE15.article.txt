# Success and Failure
## 
### 
Tlio experimental open debate hold Tuesday night was half
success and half failure.
A full house was on hand attempting lo determine whether
the Eisenhower Administration has been a failure. This question
was not resolved nor was even half of the debate centered around
this concept.
The reason for this failure is rather obvious. Such an all en
compassing question can not conceivably be answered in a month,
much less an hour. Future open debates should attempt to re
solve more specific questions such as socialized medicine or the
arms race and where it is leading us.
The duration of the debate should he considerably lengthened
in order to give students the opportunity to express their views
more fully. Kacli debater was given two minutes for rebuttal,
hardly enough time to state your political affiliation. I here prob
ably should lie no time limit set at all. I In 1 debate should last
until no one is left.
In spite of these unforseeable problems, the debate must he
considered a success simply because it permitted students inter
ested in this nation's future to defend their views against intelli
gent people of other parties.
It is highly unlikely that the debate will change anyone's
political beliefs overnight, but the seeds of thought should be
planted and future debates could result in numerous movements
from right to left and visa versa.
An interesting sidelight to the debate was the surprisingly
equal proportion of Democrats, Republicans, Conservatives and
Socialists. Stanford is normally considered a strongly Republican
universitv, but if it is fair to judge from one program, Democrats
and Socialists have large followings as well.
All in all, the debate was worthwhile and we hope there are
more being planned, provided that they are longer and more
specific. . «
