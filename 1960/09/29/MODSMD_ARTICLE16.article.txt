Mr. Khrushchev's speech re
veals how Soviet policy has
evolved since the crack-up at Ihe
summit last May. The subject of
his speech was Ihe historic up
rising of the submerged peoples
in Asia, Africa, and Latin Amer
ica, against the political and eco
nomic hegemony of Western Eu
rope and North America. There
is no issue between him and us
over the historic fact that this
hegemony is being liquidated and
that it is being replaced by new
constellations of sovereign states.
The issue between us is not
whether what he calls colonial
ism is to be ended. The issue is
how the transition from depend
ence to independence is to be
brought about.
It is on this point that his po
sition has changed since the dip
lomatic disaster which wrecked
the summit and lias brought
about a rupture of communica
tions and negotiations between
the Soviet Union and the West
ern powers. Until the crack-up, as
late as April when he visited
President (!e Gaulle in Paris, Mr.
K.. though a champion of the co
lonial revolution, was prepared
to recognize that the Western
powers have interests, as for ex
ample in the security of the Euro
pean settlers, and that a certain
tolerance and patience were neces
sary in making the difficult tran
sition to independence.
A crucial example of this was
his public indorsement of Presi
dent de Gaulle's Algerian policy,
and this carried with it the under
standing that during the series
of summit meetings which were
then contemplated, the liberation
in Africa would be helped and
guided by the United Nations and
the great powers.
Now we see that since the crack
up in May Mr. K.'s position is
that he will not facilitate the
transition to independence by al
lowing the Western powers to col
laborate. His new position is un
conditional support of the ouster
of the Western powers and a re
fusal to let them play any part
in the transition to independence.
The West, because of its imperial
ist history and because of the cer
tain residue of semi-imperialistic
privileges today, is in his present
mood disqualified from assisting
and guiding the new states.
The assault on the Secretary-
General is a corollary of, is inci
dental to, his policy of excluding
the West from the transition. Mr.
Hammarskjold's conduct of the
Congo operation has been a faith
ful and a skillful attempt to facil
itate the transition from Belgian
colonialism to Congolese inde
pendence. Mr. Harrimarskjold's
sin in Mr. Khrushchev's eyes has
been that the U.N. mission has

been dedicated to helping Ihe
Congo, which is not ready for in
dependence, to overcome the ob
stacles on Ihe way to self-govern
ment. Mr. K.'s post summit policy
does not permit Westerners to
play any important part in such a
transition.
It is not clear as of now how
much of Mr. K.'s new position is
a continuation of his wrath after
the U-2 and President Eisen
hower's avowal of our right to
over-fly the Soviet Union. It is
not clear how much of his new
position is considered policy. I
would guess that not even Mr. K.
himself could answer these ques
tions today.
For what is now evident is that
these questions will be answered
only if, when, and as the crack-up
is repaired and communication is
restored. The speech Mr. K. de
livered on Friday is not the speech
he would have delivered last
April. For then he recognized
that Britain. France, and the
United States had a necessary and
useful part to play in the rise of
the new nations. On Friday he
seemed to say that we were un
touchables and have no part to
; play.
The i-ssue he raised on Friday
will have to be arbitrated by the
new nations. They must decide
whether they want the help of the
West, the help of the Common
wealth, and the help of the
French Community, and the help
of the United States. We have no
power and no desire to compel
them to accept our help. But. if
they are wise in their own inter
ests, they will take help where
they can get it, and with the
smallest amount of string at
tached to it. They will make sure
that they do not become wholly
dependent on any one govern
ment, and they will guard, as
they would the apple of their
eye, the authority and the dignity
and the universality of the
United Nations.
They will find if they look into
it while they are here that in
these matters there has been a
great change of opinion in the
past few years. There was a time
when we regarded their neutral
ity in the cold war as immoral
and equal to taking sides with
Moscow. That is no longer the
official American opinion. We
have gotten our bearings in the
world as it is. We have remem
bered our history. Ami we know
that the American Founding
Fathers were right when they
laid down the precept that the
policy of a newly liberated coun
try is to he neutral in the con
flicts of the great powers.
