# Mr. K. Chooses U.N. as Battleground To Help Africans, Hinder Chinese
## 
### BILL JUNE IIR Political Analyst 
Premier Khrushchev has cho
sen to make New York City the
major battleground of the cold
war. We know from experience
that Mr. K. doesn't feel obligated
to work through the U.N. unless
he thinks he can gain by it. The
questions this week: What is
Khrushchev after and why is he
going after it from within the
United Nations?
First among his major objec
tives is gaining the friendship of
the nations of emerging Africa.
Last week, thirteen African com
munities were admitted to the
U.N. These newcomers are espe
cially proud of their status as
U.N. members. Membership al
lows these nations, some with
only a dozen college graduates, to
sit in world council with more
prominent states.
The U.N. has an additional ap
peal to these Africans. Having
just escaped European domina
tion, they are understandably
jealous of their new sovereignty.
They seek to avoid direct entan
glement with either Eastern or
Western blocs.
Their loyalty for the time being
is to Ihe U.N. where as members
of the large neutralist voting bloc,
they can demand to be heard by
the mighty. Mr. K. knows that
approaching Africans outside Ihe
U.N. would only awaken their
fears of domination by a more
powerful country.
So the Russian leader has come
to Now York to show these now
nations that the organization of
which they are proud members
has been used recently in the
Congo as a Western tool. He
urges the neutrals to use their
voting power to clean up the
United Nations along lines which
he has suggested.
Mr. K.'s interest In the Afri
cans is shared by the West of

course; and even more signifi
cantly by Red China. China is
reason number two why the Rus
sians have started doing their
big business in ihe U.N. China and
Russia have fallen out on meta
physics of Marxism. Translated
into ordinary terms, this split
means that ihese two large pow
ers are in a scrap for the leader
ship of the Red World.
China once confined activities
to an Asian sphere but is now
competing with Moscow for the
loyalties of non-Asian nations,
especially in newly independent
Africa. So the Russian chiefs, in
order to lessen Chinese compel i
tion. have moved the business of
world affairs into the U.N. where
the Chinese Communist are not
admitted.

Red Bloc loyalties will require
the Russians to sponsor U.N. mem
bership for Red China, but don't
look for Mr. K. to push very hard
for Communist China's entry. The
Russians have a good thing in
the United Nations and they aren't
overly eager to share it with the
Chinese.
Khrushchev's American trip is
not, then, just for windy noise
making, but part of a hard-headed
challenge. This challenge must be
met by an aggressive West dur
ing the next weeks or the Rus
sians may emerge from the fif
teenth meeting of the U.N. Gen
eral Assembly as the dominant
power in world affairs. The cur
rent battle in the U.N. could be
the battle that ultimately decides
I the cold war.
