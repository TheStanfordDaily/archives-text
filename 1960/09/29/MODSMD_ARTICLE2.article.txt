## Asian Majors Pick Up Forms 
### 
Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock,
400 applications for the newest
addition to tlie Farm family ar
rived at the Registrar's Officeâ€”
and by 10 a.m. they had been
picked up by 400 hopeful candi
dates for the premiere class of
Stanford's Tokyo branch.
More application forms are be
ing printed.
While the Department of Asian
Languages has only about 10 un
dergraduate majors and 27-28
graduate students at present, Pro
lessor Shau Wing Chan said that
this quarter's enrollment in both
beginning Japanese and Chinese
classes has increased appreciably
over the 1959 fall term.
"THERE has been a noticeable
increase in Stanford students dis
playing an interest in Asian lan
guages over the past few years,"
he said, and expressed the hope
that the new Tokyo center would
provide even further encourage
ment.
Chan, who is the head of the
department, mentioned the Asian
House among the probable influ
ences producing this swing tow
ard Asian study. Looking for
ward to its third year of existence
next summer quarter, the House
has proved to be a "successful ex
periment," Chan said,
all the facilities for those who
lived in the house to learn and
speak the language."
CHAN believes there is a good
chance for sophomores to be
eventually included in the pro
gram. At present, candidates for
the first session must have
reached junior-class status by the
end of this school year.
While the number of students
who can be accepted is necessarily
small, Chan said, the figure of I*o
undergraduates and 5 graduates
given in yesterday's daily is only
a "tentative goal." The enroll
ment may be determined to some
degree by the qualifications of
the students who apply, he ex
plained.
