Most of the athletes who competed in Ihe Rome Olympics came
hack with a carload of stories to tell. Paul Hait is no exception.
Hait, a Stanford junior, won a gold medal for swimming the breast
stroke leg for the winning American medley relay team.
"You probably read about that time with the Russians," he said,
launching into that now-famous incident. "The first day we got there
we had a training period at Aqua Acetocia. The Russians had four
lanes and we had four. When they found out that we were Americans
and we found out that they were Russians everybody went over to
meet each other.
"The Russians all pointed at themselves and each one would say,
'.Me Kossolov (or whatever his name was), greatest Russian back
stroker.' We all said, 'Yeah, sure buddy,' and started introducing
ourselves the same way. I pointed at myself and said 'My name is
Hait.'

"Well, the Russians all looked
at each other and then started
saying, 'No Hait; peace, friend
ship.' When we finally explained
to them that Hait was my name
they said, 'No Hait. We'll call you
Mr. Paul.' And I was Mr. Paul
to them the whole time in Rome."
The story of how Hail got to
Rome at all is another one which
he candidly admits means a lot
to him.
"In my frosh year I injured my
back by weight lifting. My back
and legs were so screwed up that
1 couldn't even sit down. I even
had to take my winter and spring
quarter finals standing up.
"They put me in traction over
the Easter vacation for two and
a half weeks, but it didn't do any
good. When I came back to
school I was sleeping in a steel
brace on a mattress on the floor.

"Alter school was out I had a hack operation. They took a disk
out and just left a hole there. I was paralyzed for two weeks and
couldn't move at all. I spent the summer recuperating. Also a nerve
in my leg was cut a third of the way through and that took six
months to heal.
"Well, when I came back to school in the f;ril T told Haynie (Tom
Ilaynie, then Stanford swim coach) that I wanted to swim around a
little. 1 went to a specialist in San Francisco and he said it would
be foolish to try to swim and that it might cause a serious injury.
The operating doctors had said that I could use the exercise and
that it would be foolish not to swim.
'My Times Were Slow'
"Anyhow Haynie let me swim, hut 1 was really out of shape. Tom
Peterson and Jim Cooper, our breaststroke men, just waxed me. My
leg would jump like made when I kicked because of that nerve and
my times were ridiculously slow. I was eighth in tin* 200 meters in
the Pacific Coast meet in tin' beginning of March.
"After swim season 1 told Haynie that I wanted to try out for
the Olympic team and I joined the Santa Clara Swim Club under
George Haines, who was the women's Olympic swim coach.
"During spring quarter I was swimming two and a half miles a
day. After school was out I really led a Spartan existence. Up at
six, swim two and a half miles, rest, eat, two and a half more miles,
more rest, more eat. I even gave up girls for four months. That
was the hardest part," he grinned. "My times were really getting
down there, though.
"On June 23, 21 and 25 were the West Coast A AIT championships
in the L.A. Coliseum and I set American records in the 100 and 200
meter breast stroke. On .luly 9 \ve went to Toledo for the Men's AAU
championships. I took second in the 100 and third in the 200. That
was sort of a premonition for the Olympic trials which were held
in Detroit.
"They pick the guys that go to Rome by adding up your 100 and
200 times in the Detroit and Toledo meets and I about had to take
first to qualify for Rome. I qualified first in the 200 in Detroit,
breaking my L.A. record, but in the finals the water was 64 degrees
and 1 froze up and took seventh. Lance Larson and a lot of the
California boys had the same trouble.
Nine-Tenths of a Second to Rome
"The officials had a 'sure fire' list and Chet Jastremski was on
it for the breasts!roke. lie had his clothes all tailored, a suitcase
made and was all ready to go to Rome. He finished second in the 200
in Detroit, but my qualifying time was faster, so when they added
up all the times from both meets I beat him out of the trip by .9 of
n second.
"Over in Koine the medley team broke the world's record by 11
seconds in tile prelims and then with an entirely different team —
except for me —in the finals, we broke that record by 4 seconds."
Hait's plans as of now are pretty exciting.
"I have offers for all-expenses-paid trips to Japan and India if
I give swimming exhibitions, so I'll take spring quarter off to do
that. Also the number one and two finishers in both the 100 and 200
meter breaststroke in the AAU championships this year get four
weeks in Russia.
"Right now I'll be playing water polo unless my hack gets fouled
up. Then I'll just train for swimming."
