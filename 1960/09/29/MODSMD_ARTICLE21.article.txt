Arlam Bianehi, ami Rune Enge
brellsen, all starters returning
from last season.
The extremely talented players
in the starting front lint are push
ing such able players as Dick
Bart let t, Pete Magowan and Rich
Givens to the bench, at least tem
porarily.
Stanford opens the season
against Balboa, one of the better
teams in San Francisco, and
should win handily.
- This Saturday will see the un
veiling of the 1960 version of the
Stanford soccer team.
Coach Fred Priddle's entry in
the West Coast Soccer Conference
figures to end up high in confer
ence standings. An abundance of
reserve strength, a potent attack
and a rock ribbed defense could
carry the Indians all the way to
the title.
THE TEAM TO BEAT this year,
as always, is USF, with its fine
group of foreign soccer stars.
Other top teams, along with Stan
ford, City College of San Fran
.cisco, last year's league champs,
and California, with All-American
goalie Fred Becker.
Stanford has many individual j
stars back from last year. Second j
Team All - American B ernie
Knaggs will be shifted from in
side to halfback to take advantage
of his ball-handling and defensive
ability.
Others shoring up Ihe defense
will be goalies Beau Bianchi and
Hunt Bascom. Bascom was last
year's starting goalie most of the
season. Bianchi, who will get a
starting shot in Saturday's game,
is a sophomore who turned out
for soccer for the first time this
year.
THE FULLBACKS are Dick
Voake, a goalie vast year, and
Dan Farthing. At halfbacks are i
Knaggs, Jan Achenbach, second
team all-conference last year, and
Rusty Williams. Bob Cormack and
Don Burr are tough reserves at
this spot.
Stanford's front line should be
high-scoring this year with the j

addition of two foreign players.
The starting center forward, Em
manuel Andah is a cracker jack
soccer player from Ghana. Andah
could he one of the top scorers
in the league. The other foreign
player is Georges de la Tour d'
Auvergne from Buenos Aires.
George and Roberto Santa-Cruz
are competing for the inside spot
left vacant bv Knaggs. Santa-Cruz

will start Saturday, but George
will probably split playing time
with him.
