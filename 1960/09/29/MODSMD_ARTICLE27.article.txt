Country squad is working out
on the 4.2.mile path which winds
around the Stanford Golf Course,
in preparation for their first meet
on October 14 against San Jose
State.
Jordan reports that 1 bo team
members are an extremely en
thusiastic group, and the squad
shows more depth and balance
than in the past. This is impor
tant, for cross country is essen
tially a team race in which the
placing of the number-five man
can make all the difference in
the world.
THE KAKI.V choice for number
one man is John North way, a

.l 7 junior who was the top var
sity two-miler last spring. "North"
will be very strongly challenged,
however, by Dave Boore, a fresh
man from Los Altos, who set a
national high school two-mile rec
ord of 9:28.
Several other freshmen are top
cross country prospects, prompt
ing Jordan to call them, "un
questionably the best group of
freshmen in the last four years."
Robin Ruble, Boore's teammate
at Los Altos High, ran a 4:12.3
mile last year. Bill Pratt, Wash
ington State half-mile champion
from Wenatchee, and Dave Stone
of Berkeley are other lop frosh
prospects for the long distance
event.
