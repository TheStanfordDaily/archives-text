## 
### 
HAVANA (UPI) Two bombs exploded near the Presidential
palace tonight while Premier Fidel Castro was denouncing United
States "imperialism" in a speech to 150,000 persons on his return
from the U.N, General Assembly in New York.
Castro blamed the bombings on the United States. The bombs

apparently were small types de
signed to produce a loud noise.
There were no injuries.
The explosions interrupted the
speech being given by Castro, who
flew back to Havana from New
York in a Soviet turbo-prop when
his Cubana Airliner piano was im
pounded by court order.
The Soviet ambassador was
among other distinguished guests
on the balcony of the Presidential
palace during Castro's address.
BOTH BOMBS touched off up
roars in the crowd, and Castro
had his lieutenants lead the audi
ence in singing the Cuban na
tional anthem, apparently in an
effort to quiet it.
After the first explosion, Castor
told the crowd: "Everybody
knows who paid for that bomb.
Those ait; the bombs of imperial
ism."
His audience responded with
shouts of "To the wall, to the
wall," (The firing squad).
During his speech. Castro
brought up the question of the
U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo.
lIE CHARGED that a deliber
ate hysteria is being created in
regard to the base and said he
wanted to make clear that any
effort he made to recover the base
will be through legal channels
and under international law. He
made the same assertion in his
lengthy speech to Ihe General
Assembly Monday.
In his speech, Castro warned
his enemies that they "are play
ing with fire but do not know it
yet."
Castro announced that a "big
brother type of vigilance com
mittee would be established in
every block so that the activities
of all residents could be checked.
"We are going to see if the
lackeys of imperialism can make
any moves then," he said.
"WE ARE going to implant
in the face of aggressions by im
perialism a system of collective
revolutionary vigilance wherein
everybody can know who lives on
the block and what relations they
had with tyranny. . .
He said the move will be co
ordinated wilh an in the
civilian militia "zone by zone"
throughout Cuba.
The explosions wereheard

throughout Cuba over the radio
and television networks carrying
the bearded Premier's speech.
Police cars with wailing sirens
raced through the streets.
Castro, after regaining his com
posure. scoffed at the bombs.
CASTRO SAID: "I believe to
morrow they will go to charge
your excellency," an apparent
reference to U.S. Ambassador
Philip Ronsal.
"Mark this well," he added.
"The moment I was talking of
imperialism, the bomb exploded."

wanted to make clear that any
effort he made to recover the base
will be through legal channels
and under international law. He
made the same assertion in his
lengthy speech to Ihe General
Assembly Monday.
In his speech, Castro warned
his enemies that they "are play
ing with fire but do not know it
yet."
Castro announced that a "big
brother type of vigilance com
mittee would be established in
every block so that the activities
of all residents could be checked.
"We are going to see if the
lackeys of imperialism can make
any moves then," he said.
"WE ARE going to implant
in the face of aggressions by im
perialism a system of collective
revolutionary vigilance wherein
everybody can know who lives on
the block and what relations they
had with tyranny. . .
He said the move will be co
ordinated wilh an in the
civilian militia "zone by zone"
throughout Cuba.
The explosions wereheard

throughout Cuba over the radio
and television networks carrying
the bearded Premier's speech.
Police cars with wailing sirens
raced through the streets.
Castro, after regaining his com
posure. scoffed at the bombs.
CASTRO SAID: "I believe to
morrow they will go to charge
your excellency," an apparent
reference to U.S. Ambassador
Philip Ronsal.
"Mark this well," he added.
"The moment I was talking of
imperialism, the bomb exploded."
HAVANA (UPI) Two bombs exploded near the Presidential
palace tonight while Premier Fidel Castro was denouncing United
States "imperialism" in a speech to 150,000 persons on his return
from the U.N, General Assembly in New York.
Castro blamed the bombings on the United States. The bombs

apparently were small types de
signed to produce a loud noise.
There were no injuries.
The explosions interrupted the
speech being given by Castro, who
flew back to Havana from New
York in a Soviet turbo-prop when
his Cubana Airliner piano was im
pounded by court order.
The Soviet ambassador was
among other distinguished guests
on the balcony of the Presidential
palace during Castro's address.
BOTH BOMBS touched off up
roars in the crowd, and Castro
had his lieutenants lead the audi
ence in singing the Cuban na
tional anthem, apparently in an
effort to quiet it.
After the first explosion, Castor
told the crowd: "Everybody
knows who paid for that bomb.
Those ait; the bombs of imperial
ism."
His audience responded with
shouts of "To the wall, to the
wall," (The firing squad).
During his speech. Castro
brought up the question of the
U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo.
