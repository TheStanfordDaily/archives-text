# Exhausted by Pre-Reg Frosh Welcome Books
## 
### 
"Frantic but fun" could well
sum up the freshmen reaction to
Pre-Reg week, held Sept. 21-27.
Consensus of opinion deemed
that it was well-planned and quite
helpful, but a little too crowded.
New students appreciated the
helpfulness of upperclassmen and
the attempts of organizers to get
the freshmen acquainted with
each other and the campus.
"The next pre-reg week should
have one-half day of absolutely
nothing, so one can sit and medi
tate," one girl voiced, echoing a
number of her classmates. Some
commented that the week was so
hectic they couldn't remember
what they'd been doing. Although
a chance to catch up on one's
thirfl <ing was desired, the fatigued
freshmen eagerly praised the ac
tivities.
"I LOVED everything" was
heard often, but most students
singled out activities they par
ticularly enjoyed. The Jolly-Up
met with most comment, both pro
and con. The opportunity to mix
and meet people was generally ap
prover!. although some dancers
disliked "being thrown at the
boys < or girls>."
The females were heard to com
plain that they either "lost a
partner in the crowd" or "couldn't
get i id of him." Other events en
joyed were President Wallace

Sterling's reception and the pic
nic at Wilber Hall.
"You get the feeling of the
place from walking around," said
one girl of the myriad of activi
ties. The events also filled the
"empty feeling," helped arrivals
get settled, and kept them from
being homesick, revealed fresh
men.
UNANIMOUS praise was given
concerning the attentions of up
perclassmen, organizations, and
all other concerned with Pre-Reg
Week. Frosh welcomed the ab
sence of hazing. Numbers
"blessed" the A Phi O boys who
met trains and planes, helping
with luggage and transportation,
and were grateful for sponsors'
advice. Rides to the shopping
center were appreciated.
Meeting one's classmates is im
i portant to freshmen, and they
liked the name tags and general
gatherings. Officials should "con
tinue those (tags) with upper
classmen during the quarter"
commented a co-ed.
"I liked being here before the
| uppri classmen because you know
j all the kids wandering around are
i freshmen." a girl summed up th<*
J week. Fiul many felt it was not a
typical week and. since they were
1 exhausted, actually would "like to
! <jet down to a routine" (even if
; il means studying).
