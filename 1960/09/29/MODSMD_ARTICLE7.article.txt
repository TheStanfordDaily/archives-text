## 
### 
NEW YORK ( UPI â€¢ - The first
sign of a thaw in the four-month
old East-West summit freeze
came today with an announce
ment that Soviet Premier Nikita
S. Khrushchev and British Prime
Minister Harold Macmillan will
meet today.
The two statesmen will meet at:
6:30 p.m. EDT at the Soviet man
sion on Park Avenue.
There still was no indication of
a possible meeting between Presi
dent Eisenhower and the Soviet
leader, however. Khrushchev ap
parently stuck to his statement
that the initiative would have to
be taken by the President, and
the White House said Eisenhower
had no plans to bring up the sub
ject.
THE MEETING of Macmillan
and Khrushchev was arranged by
top-level go-betweens, British For
eign Secretary Lord Home and
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko, according to a British
Foreign Office spokesman.
The first meeting of the two
men since Khrushchev scuttled
the summit conference in Paris
last May will come several hours
after Macmillan addresses the
United Nations General Assem
bly.
After the two leaders agreed to
meet, their deputies then con
ducted negotiations for the site
of the conference. It was agreed
that Macmillan would go to the
Russian Embassy on Park Ave
nue because Khrushchev called
him during the Paris summit
meeting.
THE SPOKESMAN said that
Home and Sir Patrick Dean, Chief
of the British Delegation to the
IT.N., had breakfast at the Soviet
headquarters on Park Avenue
with Gromyko. It was not indi
cated whether the two Britons
saw Khrushchev at that time.
Shortly after the British-Rus
sian "little summit meeting" was
negotiated, Khrushchev received
his sometime Communist adver
sary, President Tito of Yugosla
via.
Khrushchev seemed to be in
better spirits this morning than
he had been for the last two days.
When he appeared on the front
stoop of the Russians' Park Ave
nue mansion to await Tito, he
saluted Ihe press and said "good
morning," then waved at a group
of Hunter College girls across the
street.
DIPLOMATIC SOURCES said
world-wide disarmament probably
would be the main subject of Mac
millan's talk with Khrushchev.
It was recalled that Macmillan
was the go-between who set up
the Paris summit conference, but
British sources doubted ho would
try to .arrange another such meet
ing.
Khrushchev was reported plan
ning to push ahead with his ef
forts to reorganize the United
Nations along his own lines de
spite a succession of defeats in
the General Assembly.
