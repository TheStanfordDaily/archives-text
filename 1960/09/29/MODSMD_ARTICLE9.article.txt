# Michigan Governor To Meet Student Body
## 
### 
President Kisculiower lias failed lo hark positiveK his edict iu
reference t<Â» integration; llie Eisenhower administration has made
the United States a "second-best" 1 nation.
So feels Michigan's Democratic (Governor G. Menneii "Soapy"
Williams who is to address the public free of charge this morning

at 11 in Mom Aud. Following his
forty minutes of remarks, stu
dents will be free to ask questions
for a twenty-minute period.
Holding Michigan's gubernato
rial post for an unprecedented
six terms, the Governor will not
be seeking re-election. As one of
Kennedy's earliest and most en
thusiastic supporters, it is likely
that the green polka dot bow-tie
clad Democrat will hold a cabinet
position should Kennedy win in
November.
A bare five months before the
Los Angeles convention nominat
ed Kennedy, Williams was seen
aiming for the vice-presidency.
Soon after statements to this ef
fect were launched, he declared
he would accept the number two
spot on the Demo ticket. Ironi
cally Senate majority leader Lyn
don Johnson is a man with whom
the governor has had several po
litical tiffs.
IN AUGUST, "Soapy" charged
that Johnson tried to use Con
gressional influence to bar Michi
gan's endorsement of Kennedy.
Two months previous to that, the

j Governor had stated that any
Democratic candidate with the
exception of Johnson could cany
Michigan.
In mid-July Williams hinted he
desires the position of Secretary
of State should the Demo's be
swept into the Presidency.
Michigan's Democratic conven
tion, held in late April, picked a
slate pledged to Williams. By mid-
May, backing of Kennedy was re
vealed as reports of the release
of the favorite son delegation
were circulated. When early June
saw a formal Kennedy backing in
a move giving Michigan's 51
votes, Kennedy hailed the Gover
nor's support to the nation's
press.
AN INSTIGATOR of the con
troversial Health - Insurance-tor
the-Aged Bill. Williams is also
concerned with nuclear testing.
In a conference of the nation's
leaders sponsored by him, U.S.
speed in nuclear disarmament
was urged. Attending the Sane
Nuclear Policy Committee Rally,
he signed a petition circulated
asking continuation of the Gen
eva talks.


GOVERNOR WILLIAMS
Will speak at 1 1 a.m.
