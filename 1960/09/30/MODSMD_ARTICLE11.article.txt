Governor G. Mermen Williams' speech yesterday afternoon
followed an all 100 familiar pattern. One of Kennedy's most valu
able assistants, Williams sounded very much like the Democratie
candidate.
He spoke enthusiastically of ihe great challenge facing Ameri
cans in the coining years, lfe lashed out. at Nixon and his shady
past and indicated that llie \ ice President is still np to his old
t rieks.
\\ illiams has justification for attacking Nixon. He is not the
most trustworthy character, as this anonymous poem intimates:
1 do not like thee, Mr. Nix
The reason why, it somehow clix
This I know, I know thy trix
I do not like thee, Dr. Fix.
Tint denouncing Nixon does not tell us any more about Ken
nedy, which is ostensibly the reason for Williams' speech. As most
of the other Kennedy Democrats who are heading for the New
Frontier, Williams refuses to tell the non-elite just where and
what the New Frontier is.
\\ illiams did point out that Kennedy dared to cross swords
with the omnipotent Mr. McCarthy, that Kennedy led the battle
against the loyally oath and against the non-Communist affidavit
in the Taft-Hartley Act.
All of these stands have been well-publicized and do not con
stitute earth-shaking news. What has not been well-publicized,
what is not known, what will probably not be divulged, is what
Kennedy intends to do in the future. What are his ideas con
cerning foreign policy? Just how does he plan to deal with the
Communists?
We have had hints from the past hut nothing of any substance.
"Vf illiams added nothing in the way of enlightenment. Perhaps
< .hester Bowles, who is speaking here next week and who is known
to be more specific than many other politicians, will tell us a
little more about the mystical Mr. Kennedy.
Although be said little about the issues, Williams was, never
theless, very impressive. Someone asked him about his feelings
concerning the choice of Johnson as Kennedy's running mate.
Williams, of course, had an excellent chance for that post.
\\ illiams diplomatically answered that he would not be fool
ing anyone if he said he was glad about the choice but that Johnson
has proven himself to be a courageous individual and that Wil
liams is not happy, but is content.
We are happy that Governor \\ illiams spoke, but not content.
Someone, somewhere, must have the answers.
