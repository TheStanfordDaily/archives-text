For several hundred freshmen,
by now accustomed to the intrica
cies of Farm life, Fall quarter is
a melting pot of all they've heard
before concerning "collegian
spirit."
But after the "spirit" has been
poured on — and subsequently
soaked in or run off — San Fran
cisco beckons, and at night the
campus becomes a place of sign
out slips and closing hours.
By all means, "The City" is
worthy of the Bayshore exodus
which occurs every weekend. But
all too often the cars rush through
campus and the surrounding area
without realizing that good enter
tainment exists within a 15-min
ute drive.
Herb Caen's darling is bustling
with theatrical and niteclub en
tertainment this tall. But, while
lacking the latter, Stanford has
a good amount of theatrical bustle
herself, with three big produc
tions scheduled by the Stanford
Players.
The first on the list is Shake
speare's marvelous duel between
Beatrice and Benedick, scheduled
for Oct. 28, 29 and Nov. 3-5. The
show's director will be James
Kerans who showed his skill last
year with his excellent staging of
Sean O'Casey's "I Knock at the
Door" and imaginative "Richard
11."
February. Jean Anouilh's "The
Waltz of the Toreadors" will be
brought to the stage of Memorial
Auditorium, and Henrik Ibsen's
"Peer Gynt" promises to be out
standingly staged in Frost Amphi
theater in May.
In charge of these latter two
shows will be Robert B. Loper, a
man of great acting ability as well
as directorial skill. A veteran di
rector and actor with the Oregon
Shakespearean Festival in Ash
land as well, Loper took sabbati
cal leave from Stanford last year
1o continue theatrical and literary
research in England. This sum
mer at Ashland he directed "The
Taming of the Shrew" and cre
aled an excellent Prospero.
Two years ago, Loper directed
"A ."Midsummer Night's Dream"
here —a stunning production with
the enchanting background of
Frost Amphitheater. Thus, Loper

can Ire counted on to produce an
equally amazing: "Peer Gynt" in
that samp setting;.
As a testimonial to the achieve
ments of the Stanford Players,
last fall the Ford Foundation
granted assistance to the group
to produce an original play selec
ted through ihe Foundation's
program to aid new playwrights.
The only other group in this
area to receive this recognition
was The Actor's Workshop which,
under the same program, pro
duced "The Plaster Bambino"
starring Viveca Lindfors and
Burgess Meredith.
This company is by far the
leader in San Francisco 1 heater—
and is rapidly becoming a leader
in American theater, having been
chosen to represent American
Regional Theater with its "Wait
ing for Godot" production at the
Brussels World Fair in 1959.
The Workshop is currently
sponsoring a line production ol'
the Kurt Weil-Bret Breclit "Three
penny Opera" at the Marines'
Theater.
Written during Ihe spring of
1928 in a Riviera village, the show
has played to sold-out audiences
ever since its first performance in
Berlin that year. Productions
spread throughout Europe, finally
reaching this country on March
10, 1954, when Carmen Capalbo
and Stanley Chase opened the
musical show in New York City.
The new English adaptation
was by Marc Blitzstein and was
an instantaneous hit. Proof of its
success comes with the fact that
it is still playing to sold-out audi
ences in New York City in its
sixth year!
Weill's haunting music alone
would be worth the ticket prices
—add to this some fine acting
and musical performances plus
outstanding, fusedcolor stage set
tings and the result is an exciting
and interesting production.
The "Opera" is destined to
reach classic status even though
Hitler used it as an example of
"decadent music" in his "Museum
of Decadent Art." It didn't work,
however, and the music was re
moved from the museum when
crowds came to applaud not
sneer.
