# Mr. K. Using U.N. to Battle Red Chinese
## 
### 
NEW YORK fUPT) â€” Soviet
Premier Nikita Khrushchev's
lough stand at the United Nations
stems directly from his bitter
struggle vvilh Red China for con
trol of world Communism.
That is the conclusion of top
American authorities after watch
ing Khrushchev in action for the
past week.
KHRUSHCHEV is talking with
in the United Nations and on the
streets of New York, but his
words are addressed to the Com
munist parties of the world. He
is under increasing pressure 1o
demonstrate that ihe Chinese
Communists are wrong when
they charge him with having gone
soft, with having lost his revolu
tionary fervor.
The split between Red China
and Russia, according to infor
mation reaehingthe United States,
has grown steadily wider and
reached ihe point where Khru
shchev fell that strong action was
necessary before the gathering of
international Communism's lead
ers in Moscow Nov. 7.
AMERICAN authorities believe
that the Congo and other issues
here are secondary 1o Khru
shchev's real purpose in turning
the cold war on full blast again
and attacking the very structure
of the United Nations.
There is no doubt that he will
try to pick up any dividends along
the way and tie may have some
success if Soviet-supported Pa
trice Lumumba emerges on lop
again in the Congo
He also is expected to squeeze
for all its worth the anti-colonial
issue to pull into the Soviet camp
any new African states he can.
These and other issues, how
ever, are regarded as only minor
when compared 1o the titantie
struggle which Khrushchev is
now waging against Communist
China's Mao Tse-Tung.
