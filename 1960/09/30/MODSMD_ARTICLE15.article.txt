# Gov. Williams’ Excerpts

### 
"One of the best areas to show
I ho wide difference between the
Democratic and the Republican
parties is the issue of Civil Liber
ties.
The McCarthy issue is a good
yardstick to separate men of in
tegrity from men of opportunism.
It is almost unkind to compare
the Nixon record on civil liberties
with ary other person. The mere
name of Nixon recalls to mind the
many Herblock cartoons of Nixon
| with the tarbrush, Nixon emerg
-1 ing from the sewer and so on.
Kut it would be unfair to tlie
people not to reveal the whole
I character of both Presidential
candidates. So let's see where
Nixon stands on civil liberties.
Here in California it is too pain
| ful to fill in all the details for
Nixon invented McCarthyism be
fore anyone ever heard of Mc-
Carthy.
Nixon impugned the loyalty of
a Congressman, a nominee ol the
Senate, a Secretary of State and
a President of the United States.
He drafted a piece of legislation
which Thomas E. Dewey, his own
party's presidential candidate, de
nounced in Ihe following lan
guage:
"Stripped of its naked essential,
1 his is nothing but the method of
Hitler and Stalin. It is thought
control borrowed from Ihe Jap
anese. It is an attempt to heat
down ideas with a club. It is sur
render of everything we believe
in."
Senator Kennedy's response to
the whole McCarthy era—never
to indulge in what is called Mc-
Carthyism in any form - never to
sacrifice fundamental constitu
tional principles out of fear of
internal dangers, or out of fear
of McCarthy this is the stuff of
integrity.
The crucial consideration for
j all of us should he that through
out the Senator's life, and never
more clearly than in his primary
: and presidential campaigns, lie
lias shown a respect for human
i dignity.
John Kennedy's record in this
regard stands in stark contrast
1 to Nixon. Nixon now tells us we

should declare a moratorium on
criticism of the Administration,
but he once said, and I quote:
"Mr. Truman and his associates,
either through stupidity or po
litical expediency, were primarily
responsible for the unimpeded
growth of the Communist con
spiracy within the United States."
And in Los Angeles in 19.12 he
also said: "Stevenson holds a
Ph.D degree from Acheson's col
lege of cowardly Communist con
tainment the State Department."
And his recent speeches show
that he has not lost his penchant
for character assassination nor
his technique of distortion and
innuendo.
The civil liberties issue is a
good Democratic issue. The con
sistent decency of the Democratic
Party's Presidential nomine e,
Senator John F. Kennedy, will
help win him the White House in
November."
As Justice William O. Douglas
pointed out, "The way to combat
noxious ideas is with other ideas.
The way to combat falsehoods is
with truth."
This is the principle of our civil
liberties. And this is the principle
which I believe will bring victory
for the Democratic Party!
