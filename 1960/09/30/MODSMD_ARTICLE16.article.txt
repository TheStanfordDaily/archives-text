Stanford's football team will
fly to Denver today for tomor
row's eonlest against the Air
Force Academy. The Indians are
still looking for their first win of
the season and indications are
that they are looking in the
wrong place.
The kickoff will be at 1:30
mountain time 12:30 here in
the Denver ['diversity Stadium.
Falcon coach Ren Martin finds
himself in the enviable spot of
having a slarting backfield that

has played together for three
years. Martin has lost only six
men from his entire squad of last
year.
QUARTERBACK Rich Mavo,
who is putting on a rush for All-
American honors, halfbacks Phil
Lane and Mike Quinlan, and full
back Monte Moorberg comprise
the starting back field for the Air
Force and each is a formidable
True, the Tribe will outweigh
the Falcon line you can't get in
those service academies if you
weigh a lot but Stanford coach
Jack Curtice has been having his
problems on the line and finds
himself starting three men who
didn't start last week. Added to
this, Curtice is going to have to
rely heavily on sophomores to
come in and spell the starters. i
CHRIS COTTLE will take over
the offensive center spot from the ]
out-for-the-season Doug Pursell.
Ron Fernandes will start at right
guard instead of Chuck More
house and C. B. Simons will go
at right tackle for injured co-cap-1
tain Dean Hinshaw.
Curtice says that he is going to !
play platoon football on the line,
hoping to avoid the overtiring of
the first team, which led to defeat ;
last Saturday. This means that
Steve Pursell. Randy Vahan, Er-;
rol Scott, Tom Walsh and others
will be seeing heavy duty.
Cheering Curtice and his pass
throwing quarterback Dick Nor
man no end, is the return of half
back Mac Wylie to the crippled
Tribe lineup. Wylie has seen no j
action this year as he was out of |
things with a broken too. Wylie
is one of the team's top running i
threats and an excellent pass re
ceiver to boot. Along with half- j

back r;il Dowd and fullbacks Skip
Face and Archie Schmilt, Wvlie
could make trouble for the Fal
cons on the ground.
Wylie is still having a little
1 rouble moving at top speed, how
ever, so he probably won't see
any defensive action.
A RUNDOWN of the list of the
flyboys' attributes, however, pre
sents no joy to Stanford parti
sans. As Curtice tells all who
will listen, "You can just bet that
Ihey are in good shape. Service
teams always are." Condition
leads 1o speed and speed, of
course, wins football games.
Then there's that back field.
Mayo is out of the question. Last
week against Colorado State, for
instance, he completed 20 passes
out of 30 for 197 yards and three
touchdowns. These three scoring
pitches were caught by three dif
ferent receivers, indicating that

Mayo has a certain amount of
choice in picking his targets.
Lane also looks to be impossi
ble. Last year he carried the ball
43 times for a 4.2 yards per carry
average, caught 20 passes for 214
yards, completed a touchdown
pass, returned punts and kickoffs
like mad and was a general all
around handyman.
QUINLAN is more of the same.
In two seasons he has scored 90
points, rushed for an average of
4.n yards per carry, caught 43
passes for 484 yards and two
scores and been a top threat on
punt and kickoff returns.
Moorberg ran for 408 yards last
year and a 4.3 average. Repeat

ing, these boys have played to
gether for three years now and
will be just that much tougher to
bring down.
Curtice will be relying on line
j backer John Butler to do the tac
! kling along with sophomore Gary
Craig and tlie rest of the defen
sive unit.
THE FALCONS play out of a
basic "T" formation or a double
wing "T". Martin says that they
arc the best team that the Acad
emy lias had in five years.
Two years ago the Air Force
beat Stanford 16-0 in the Stadium.
Stanford would like to avenge
that defeat but it'll be quite an
upset if they do.
