## 
### 
West Coast contingent of foot
ball "teams, ranging from an un
defeated national power to aver
age, hot and cold elevens, down
to ihe hopefuls looking for their
first win meet opponents from the
East, Midwest and Southwest to
morrow in an attempt to protect
and perfect their respective rec
ords.
University of Southern Cali
fornia has been holding scrim
mages during Ihe last week in
preparation for their encounter
with Ohio State on the Buckeye's
field. The supposedly powerful
Trojans have surprised fans and
] new head coach John McKay by
: bowing to OSC, 14-0, and dropping
I a close one to TCU. 7-6, last week.
Tin: southlandi:ks might
have a rough time 4 ending that
losing streak because the Mid
west squad just finished blanking
SMU, 24-0, in their last outing.
California faces the same two
loss, no-win situation as does USC,
except that Cal's demise is les-s
surprising and might he more
permanent. The Golden Bears
I host Army, who scored 27 points
to Boston College's 7 last week,
j in what is expected to lie an un
| successful attempt to add to
; Western grid prestige.
Prospects for the northern
| schools are brighter. Although
I Oregon's second-string quarter
back Sandy Fraser will be out of
action in the Duck's weekend fray
with Utah, the Oregonians are

favored to bounce back from a >
21-0 loss to Michigan.
UN l)M FI. ATEI) Washington
hosts Navy, hoping to preserve
their national standings. Wash
ington made quick work of COP
and Idaho in previous games this
year, bin the Huskies will get a
much sterner test against the
Middies, who walked over Vii a
nova by 34 points in their I.st
game.
Washington State University
travels to the land of sunshine 1
and Arizona State and if the Ari- i
zona school's 20-point loss to
Idaho State is any indication of i
form, the Cougars should chalk i
up one more win.
Oregon State figures in the last
intersectional, this one featuring !
the Beavers and Houston at Cor- j
vallis. OSC has much to recom
mend them, including their vie-

Tory over IJSC and a closo deci
sion to Michigan State.
UCLA, another power in Coast
football, is idle this week aftor
being uiidefealed in Iwo games.
In 1110 season opener iho Bruins
edged Pitt. 8-7, and then they tiod
a strong Purdue team. 27-27.
