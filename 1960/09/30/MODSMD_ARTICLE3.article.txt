## 
### ROSS HERMANN 
G. Mennen "Soapy" Williams, Democratic governor of Michigan, in
a Memorial Auditorium appearance yesterday morning, portrayed
Republican presidential nominee Richard M. Nixon as a villain who
has subverted American civil liberties.
The governor's attacks on Nixon came as part of a highly partisan

appraisal of the differences be
tween the two political parties be
fore a partly filled auditorium.
He said that there is nothing
more pernicious than views that
there is little difference between
the parties.
USING the civil liberties issue
as a point of comparison, Wil
liams said, "It is almost unkind
to compare the Nixon record on
civil liberties with that of any
other person. The mere name of
Nixon recalls the many Her block
cartoons of Nixon with the tar
brush. Nixon emerging from the
sewer . . .
"Here in California it is too
painful to fill in all the details—
for Nixon invented McCarthyism
before anyone heard of McCar
thy.
"Nixon impuned the loyalty of
a Congressman, a nominee of the
Senate, a Secretary of State, and
a President of the United States.
He drafted a piece of legislation
which Thomas E. Dewey, his own
party's presidential nominee, de
nounced . .
WILLIAMS praised Democratic
candidate John Kenn e d y for
"never indulging in McCarthyism
in any form and for never sacri
ficing fundamental constitutional
principles out of fear of internal
or external dangers, or out of fear
of McCarthy."
The governor cited the facts
that Kennedy led the opposition
to the non-Communist affidavit in
the Taft-Hartley Act, opposed the
loyalty oath in the scholarship
section of the Education Act, op
posed tho immunity hill compell
ing waiver of the Fifth Amend
ment. and fought the expansion
of wire tapping.
Williams said it was no acci
dent that America's image both
lat home and abroad was at its
lowest ebb during the McCarthy
era.
THK OLD IMAGU abroad of
America as a land of freedom and
I opportunity is gone, he sairl, hav
ing been replaced by feelings of
suspicion and distrust.
Williams attributed this loss of
prestige to moral degeneration
promoted by the McCarthy era
and also to such domestic issues
as racial discrimination and the
huge farm surpluses which exist
while people throughout the
world starve.
He called for sacrifices and the
election of a Democratic president
for renewal of the national pur
pose and military and economic
strength.
In a question and answer se.s
-1 sion following Ihe speech, the
governor was asked if candidate
Kennedy showed any consistency
of principle in his advocacy of
repealing authorization for right
to work laws in view of Ihe fact
