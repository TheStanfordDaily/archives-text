Nikita Khrushchev broke into
British Prime Minister Harold
Macmillan's United Nations ad
dress and shouted furiously in
Russian at some of his sharp com
ments on Russian policy until
Macmillan had to cease speaking.
When Macmillan began by
throwing his support to Hammar
skjold and rejecting Khrushchev's
proposal to abolish the post of
Secretary-General and set up a
three-man Communist style Pre
sidium in its place, the tumult
began.
Macmillan turned at one point
to the break-up of the summit
conference last May and started
to give his version of why it
failed.
Khrushchev leaned forward in
his seat. He pointed a wagging
finger at Macmillan and shouted:
"Yes, let us talk about Paris.
Don't send your spy planes to our
country. Don't send U-2."
The scene was unprecedented
in the history of the United Na
tions. There have been shouts
from the floor before but never
on such a solemn occasion and in
volving two heads of government.
At the end, Macmillan got a
longer and louder ovation than
either Khrushchev or President
Eisenhower had received. Khru
shchev twiddled his fingers and
scowled.
