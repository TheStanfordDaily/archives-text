### ILENE STRELITZ 
"The Atomic Energy Commis
sion is tyrannical; almost un-
American." So remarked Michi
gan's Governor "Soapy" Williams
in a backstage interview after his
address in Mem And yesterday
morning.
Definitive remarks and strong
statements such as this high
lighted the Governor's appearance
both on stage and afterwards. An
alternately groaning and applaud
ing audience -but a continually
responsive one was sparked by
the sharp replies and polished
oratory of the renowned poli
tician.
AS A POLITICAL enemy of
Senate Majority Leader Johnson,
Williams replied with a nervous
laugh when questioned backstage
about Johnson as a "ticket bal
ancer." After stating on stage
that if the Vice Presidential can
didate didn't make him "happy."
he was "content," he went on to
demonstrate party unity by prais
ing some of the Senator's latest
actions. "We may lose some in
the South; we may carry some;
either way it won't have much to
do with Johnson. You know, a lot
of Southerners are displeased
with him," were his closing off
stage statements.
Williams used the revelation of
the fact that he was president of
the Young Republicans at Prince
ton in his senior year to tell the
audience "the truth will out." In
emphatic terms he declared to an
audience where the GOP held a
majority. "Some of you born into
Republican families as I was will
see the light as I did. In a mill
pond period, our nation is Re
publican. When we are called
upon to meet our 'Rendezvous
with Destiny' though, America
turns to the Democratic Party as
the party with more verve, an
open mind, and free thinking."
REALIZING THK make-up of
his audience, the experienced pol
itician went on with renewed fer
vor both before and after his
speech, "Our future won't be
changed by tough talk in the
kitchen (in reference to Nixon's
'kitchen debate' with Mr. K.) or
even shouting in the IJ.N." Ac
cording to "Soapy," we must re
habilitate our nation in reference
to Civil Rights.

"The Atomic Energy Commis
sion is tyrannical; almost un-
American." So remarked Michi
gan's Governor "Soapy" Williams
in a backstage interview after his
address in Mem And yesterday
morning.
Definitive remarks and strong
statements such as this high
lighted the Governor's appearance
both on stage and afterwards. An
alternately groaning and applaud
ing audience -but a continually
responsive one was sparked by
the sharp replies and polished
oratory of the renowned poli
tician.
AS A POLITICAL enemy of
Senate Majority Leader Johnson,
Williams replied with a nervous
laugh when questioned backstage
about Johnson as a "ticket bal
ancer." After stating on stage
that if the Vice Presidential can
didate didn't make him "happy."
he was "content," he went on to
demonstrate party unity by prais
ing some of the Senator's latest
actions. "We may lose some in
the South; we may carry some;
either way it won't have much to
do with Johnson. You know, a lot
of Southerners are displeased
with him," were his closing off
stage statements.
Williams used the revelation of
the fact that he was president of
the Young Republicans at Prince
ton in his senior year to tell the
audience "the truth will out." In
emphatic terms he declared to an
audience where the GOP held a
majority. "Some of you born into
Republican families as I was will
see the light as I did. In a mill
pond period, our nation is Re
publican. When we are called
upon to meet our 'Rendezvous
with Destiny' though, America
turns to the Democratic Party as
the party with more verve, an
open mind, and free thinking."
REALIZING THK make-up of
his audience, the experienced pol
itician went on with renewed fer
vor both before and after his
speech, "Our future won't be
changed by tough talk in the
kitchen (in reference to Nixon's
'kitchen debate' with Mr. K.) or
even shouting in the IJ.N." Ac
cording to "Soapy," we must re
habilitate our nation in reference
to Civil Rights.
