liams' heels, Rep. Chester Bowles,
a leading Democratic foreign pol

HIS TALK will be sponsored by

Prof. John H. Bunzel, who is a

A former Ambassador to India
as well as being mentioned for
Sec. of State, Bowles is expected
to continue to campaign against
Vice President Richard M. Nixon's
insistence discussion of foreign
policy should be avoided while
Soviet Premier Nikita Khru
shchev is in the country.
YESTERDAY at a rally in New
York City, Bowles slashed out at
Nixon. "He tells us that foreign
policy is the most important issue
in the campaign. But then he says
we cannot talk about it while
Khrushchev is in the country,"
Bowles said.
"Well, Mr. 'K* can rule out for
eign poiley in Russia, but I think
it would be granting him too
much power and influence to let
him do it here," Bowles con
tinued.
As co-founder of Benton &
Bowles, a New York advertising
agency, Bowles had a successful
business career before he entered
politics as general manager of
the war-time Office of Price Ad
ministration in 1943.
He was Governor of Connecti
cut, 1949 to 19.31. and served as
United States Ambassador to
India and Nepal from 1951 to
1933. His book about this experi
ence. "Ambassador's Report, was
a national best-seller.
After serving several high
posts in the field of production
during World War 11, Mr, Bowles
was sent to Paris as an American
delegate to the United Nations
Economic Scientific and Cultural
Organization Conference in 1946.
