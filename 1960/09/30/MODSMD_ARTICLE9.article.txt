NEW YORK i UPII Premier
Nikita S. Khrushchev and Prime
Minister Harold Macmillan held
a two-man sUmmit conference
for 2 hours and 12 minutes last
night that ended in a stalemate.
Khrushchev said before he went
into the session that he doubted
it would get anywhere. Macmillan
entered in a spirit of willingness
to talk as long as there was any
thing to say.
THE BRITISH disclosed that
the two men agreed to meet
again early next week alter think
ing over their discussion on dis
armament. Berlin and the struc
ture of the United Nations.
When Khrushchev was asked
how the meeting with Macmillan
came out, he replied:
"I cannot answer in his absence
because you probably have asked
him the same tiling. If I answer,
I may say something different,
and I don't want any differences
with him."
A FEW MINUTES after Mac
millan's departure, the British
issued a statement at the Wal
dorf-Astoria Hotel saying:
"Mr. Macmillan and Mr. Khru
shchev have just had a two-hour
meeting.
"This was the first time they
had met since Mr. Khrushchev
came to say goodbye to Mr. Mac
millan after the failure of the
summit meeting earlier this year.
"THE PURPOSE of the meet
ing was to have an exchange of
views which might enable each
to understand the other's ap
proach to the basic problems of
ihe day in the hope that it might
be possible to find again a com
mon language of negotiation.
"They considered the main
problems which should have been
tackled at the summit meeting
had it taken place.
"Among the subjects discussed
this afternoon were disarmament.
Berlin and the structure of the
United Nations.
"They agreed to think all these
things over for a further discus
sion at some later date.
"The purpose of the meeting
was for an exchange of views.
"The atmosphere was calm and
reasonable. Each side expressed
its views and held to theirs."
The Foreign Office spokesman
said the last sentence actually
summed up the outcome of the
conference and that neither side
had given an inch of ground to
the other.
