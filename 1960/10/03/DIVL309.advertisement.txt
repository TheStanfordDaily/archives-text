On the riddle of
rolling friction
General Motors is pioneering research into the mystery of energy losses in the
rolling ball. With a unique measuring device Cabove), investigators have not
only confirmed the hypothesis of how a rolling ball loses energy (Answer: elastic
hysteresis), but have also learned where this lost energy is dissipated (Answer:
in the interior of the material, not on the surface).
The effectiveness of automation depends upon the ingenuity of the
scientist and engineer. If you are about to begin a career in the field
of technology you'll benefit yourself by working where ingenuity and
enthusiasm pay off. At General Motors they do, and in a big way.
What is your main interest? GM's diversification covers many fields.
Automotive research, production engineering and manufacturing, elec
tronics and astronautics are just a few. With so many and varied
divisions, GM can offer men who qualify the choice of specialization or
the opportunity to work on vastly different projects.
GM also has a financial aid program for both postgraduate and under
graduate students. For complete information, write to General Motors,
Personnel Staff, Detroit 2, Mich.
