# Air Force Deals Cards Third Loss
## 
### RON RAPOPORT Sports Editor 
DENVER Nineteen hundred
Air Force cadets rode in here
Saturday in buses decorated with
sucli things as "Stew the Sioux,"
"Rout the Redskins," "Beat the
Braves," and (yeccch!) "Yes, Mr.
Custer, we will beat the Indians."
By the time tha't the Stanford-
Air Force game was over, the
Indians were stewed, routed and
beaten, and Custer had his re
venge by the score of 32-9.
ACTUALLY, the game was, for
a while at least, much closer than
a 23-point spread indicates. In
deed, save for one unfortunate
penalty (and a couple of pass in
terceptions), the whole outcome
might have been different.
Midway through the third quar
ter. with the Tribe down 21-9,
Stanford quarterback Dick Nor
man led a drive which brought
them to a first down on the Air
Force's 24-yard line.
Norman gave the ball to full
back Skip Face, who proceeded
to negotiate the distance to the
goal line in what was without
question the best Stanford run of
the year. Face exploded through
the middle of the line, cut to his
left, broke away from three men
in the AF's secondary and just
plain outran the safetyman to
the goal line and a touchdown.
THE SCORE was nullified when
a referee called Stanford end Dale
Ostrander for clipping. Two plays
later Norman threw a pass at half
back Mac Wylie, only to watch it
bounce high in the air off Wylie's
hands, finally to be intercepted
by the Falcons' Dean Hess.
Twice more in the fourth quar
ter, Stanford scoring bids were
abruptly halted by Air Force in
terceptions of Norman aerials.
Overall, the Tribe star had a
wretched day, completing only
five out of 16 passes for 49 yards.
He had three interceptions.
The Falcons' rushing game at
limes bordered on the incredible.
In the first half alone they gained
328 yards on the ground, includ
ing a 49-yard scoring burst by
halfback Mike Quinlan. The fabled
passing of quarterback Rich Mayo
was hardly in sight as he com
pleted only two out of four passes
for 26 yards in the first half.
IN THE SECOND half the Stan
ford defense stiffened and held
the Air Force to 48 yards on the
ground. Mayo took to the air, how
ever, and finished the day with
nine completions out of 16 tries
for 105 yards. In 13 carries, Quin
lan gained 148 yards (you figure
out the average, it's too painful)
and a third string fullback named
Bob McDonough carried the ball
twice for 54 yards, one a 39-yard
touchdown run.
Again- once the score is for
gotten Stanford had several
bright spots. One was Skip Face.
Without a doubt, Skip played the
best game of his career. He car
ried the ball 11 times for 257
yards which averages out to
(we'll figure it, thanks* 14.3 yards
per carry. He returned three kick
offs for 89 yards and was his
usual ferocious self on defense.
Also this was the first game
that the Tribe didn't let down in
the second half. As a matter of
fact, they got better. Coach Jack
Curtice played 34 of the 37 men
on the travelling squad and pla
tooned on offense and defense
with the desired effect. The de-
fenders withstood the pressure
better because they were less
1 i red.
TIIE OFFENSE too proved that
free substitution is a boon. Stan
ford's one scoring drive in the
second quarter was led by second
string quarterback Rod Sears, un
til Norman took over at the Air
Force 20-yard line. Gil Dowd even
tually .scored from the 11.
Reserve backs Hal Steuber and
Archie Schmitt gained 49 and f>B
yards respectively and everybody
seemed that much fresher for the
relief. The return of Mac Wylie
was an expected shot in the arm—
he caught the longest Norman
completion of ihe afternoon and
can only be more of the same as
he picks up speed while shedding
the after-effects of his toe injury.
Gary Craig's punting continues
to be phenomenal as the soph
halfback booted six times for a
■1 l-vard average.

Fullback had one of his best days
DENVER Nineteen hundred
Air Force cadets rode in here
Saturday in buses decorated with
sucli things as "Stew the Sioux,"
"Rout the Redskins," "Beat the
Braves," and (yeccch!) "Yes, Mr.
Custer, we will beat the Indians."
By the time tha't the Stanford-
Air Force game was over, the
Indians were stewed, routed and
beaten, and Custer had his re
venge by the score of 32-9.
ACTUALLY, the game was, for
a while at least, much closer than
a 23-point spread indicates. In
deed, save for one unfortunate
penalty (and a couple of pass in
terceptions), the whole outcome
might have been different.
Midway through the third quar
ter. with the Tribe down 21-9,
Stanford quarterback Dick Nor
man led a drive which brought
them to a first down on the Air
Force's 24-yard line.
Norman gave the ball to full
back Skip Face, who proceeded
to negotiate the distance to the
goal line in what was without
question the best Stanford run of
the year. Face exploded through
the middle of the line, cut to his
left, broke away from three men
in the AF's secondary and just
plain outran the safetyman to
the goal line and a touchdown.
THE SCORE was nullified when
a referee called Stanford end Dale
Ostrander for clipping. Two plays
later Norman threw a pass at half
back Mac Wylie, only to watch it
bounce high in the air off Wylie's
hands, finally to be intercepted
by the Falcons' Dean Hess.
Twice more in the fourth quar
ter, Stanford scoring bids were
abruptly halted by Air Force in
terceptions of Norman aerials.
Overall, the Tribe star had a
wretched day, completing only
five out of 16 passes for 49 yards.
He had three interceptions.
The Falcons' rushing game at
limes bordered on the incredible.
In the first half alone they gained
328 yards on the ground, includ
ing a 49-yard scoring burst by
halfback Mike Quinlan. The fabled
passing of quarterback Rich Mayo
was hardly in sight as he com
pleted only two out of four passes
for 26 yards in the first half.
IN THE SECOND half the Stan
ford defense stiffened and held
the Air Force to 48 yards on the
ground. Mayo took to the air, how
ever, and finished the day with
nine completions out of 16 tries
for 105 yards. In 13 carries, Quin
lan gained 148 yards (you figure
out the average, it's too painful)
and a third string fullback named
Bob McDonough carried the ball
twice for 54 yards, one a 39-yard
touchdown run.
Again- once the score is for
gotten Stanford had several
bright spots. One was Skip Face.
Without a doubt, Skip played the
best game of his career. He car
ried the ball 11 times for 257
yards which averages out to
(we'll figure it, thanks* 14.3 yards
per carry. He returned three kick
offs for 89 yards and was his
usual ferocious self on defense.
Also this was the first game
that the Tribe didn't let down in
the second half. As a matter of
fact, they got better. Coach Jack
Curtice played 34 of the 37 men
on the travelling squad and pla
tooned on offense and defense
with the desired effect. The de-
fenders withstood the pressure
better because they were less
1 i red.
TIIE OFFENSE too proved that
free substitution is a boon. Stan
ford's one scoring drive in the
second quarter was led by second
string quarterback Rod Sears, un
til Norman took over at the Air
Force 20-yard line. Gil Dowd even
tually .scored from the 11.
Reserve backs Hal Steuber and
Archie Schmitt gained 49 and f>B
yards respectively and everybody
seemed that much fresher for the
relief. The return of Mac Wylie
was an expected shot in the arm—
he caught the longest Norman
completion of ihe afternoon and
can only be more of the same as
he picks up speed while shedding
the after-effects of his toe injury.
Gary Craig's punting continues
to be phenomenal as the soph
halfback booted six times for a
■1 l-vard average.

FACE PICKS UP 10 YARDS TO SET UP TRIBE SCORE
Fullback had one of his best days
DENVER Nineteen hundred
Air Force cadets rode in here
Saturday in buses decorated with
sucli things as "Stew the Sioux,"
"Rout the Redskins," "Beat the
Braves," and (yeccch!) "Yes, Mr.
Custer, we will beat the Indians."
By the time tha't the Stanford-
Air Force game was over, the
Indians were stewed, routed and
beaten, and Custer had his re
venge by the score of 32-9.
ACTUALLY, the game was, for
a while at least, much closer than
a 23-point spread indicates. In
deed, save for one unfortunate
penalty (and a couple of pass in
terceptions), the whole outcome
might have been different.
Midway through the third quar
ter. with the Tribe down 21-9,
Stanford quarterback Dick Nor
man led a drive which brought
them to a first down on the Air
Force's 24-yard line.
Norman gave the ball to full
back Skip Face, who proceeded
to negotiate the distance to the
goal line in what was without
question the best Stanford run of
the year. Face exploded through
the middle of the line, cut to his
left, broke away from three men
in the AF's secondary and just
plain outran the safetyman to
the goal line and a touchdown.
THE SCORE was nullified when
a referee called Stanford end Dale
Ostrander for clipping. Two plays
later Norman threw a pass at half
back Mac Wylie, only to watch it
bounce high in the air off Wylie's
hands, finally to be intercepted
by the Falcons' Dean Hess.
Twice more in the fourth quar
ter, Stanford scoring bids were
abruptly halted by Air Force in
terceptions of Norman aerials.
Overall, the Tribe star had a
wretched day, completing only
five out of 16 passes for 49 yards.
He had three interceptions.
The Falcons' rushing game at
limes bordered on the incredible.
In the first half alone they gained
328 yards on the ground, includ
ing a 49-yard scoring burst by
halfback Mike Quinlan. The fabled
passing of quarterback Rich Mayo
was hardly in sight as he com
pleted only two out of four passes
for 26 yards in the first half.
IN THE SECOND half the Stan
ford defense stiffened and held
the Air Force to 48 yards on the
ground. Mayo took to the air, how
ever, and finished the day with
nine completions out of 16 tries
for 105 yards. In 13 carries, Quin
lan gained 148 yards (you figure
out the average, it's too painful)
and a third string fullback named
Bob McDonough carried the ball
twice for 54 yards, one a 39-yard
touchdown run.
Again- once the score is for
gotten Stanford had several
bright spots. One was Skip Face.
Without a doubt, Skip played the
best game of his career. He car
ried the ball 11 times for 257
yards which averages out to
(we'll figure it, thanks* 14.3 yards
per carry. He returned three kick
offs for 89 yards and was his
usual ferocious self on defense.
Also this was the first game
that the Tribe didn't let down in
the second half. As a matter of
fact, they got better. Coach Jack
Curtice played 34 of the 37 men
on the travelling squad and pla
tooned on offense and defense
with the desired effect. The de-
fenders withstood the pressure
better because they were less
1 i red.
TIIE OFFENSE too proved that
free substitution is a boon. Stan
ford's one scoring drive in the
second quarter was led by second
string quarterback Rod Sears, un
til Norman took over at the Air
Force 20-yard line. Gil Dowd even
tually .scored from the 11.
Reserve backs Hal Steuber and
Archie Schmitt gained 49 and f>B
yards respectively and everybody
seemed that much fresher for the
relief. The return of Mac Wylie
was an expected shot in the arm—
he caught the longest Norman
completion of ihe afternoon and
can only be more of the same as
he picks up speed while shedding
the after-effects of his toe injury.
Gary Craig's punting continues
to be phenomenal as the soph
halfback booted six times for a
■1 l-vard average.
