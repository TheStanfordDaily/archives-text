NEW YORK (UPI) â€” Soviet
Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev, in
a surprise maneuver, will address
the United Nations General As
sembly today, presumably to re
ply to Western speakers and to
the neutralist proposal that he
meet President Eisenhower.
Shortly after the President in
Washington rejected the five
nation proposal for an "urgent"
summit meeting with the Soviet
leader, Khrushchev filed a request
with the U.N. for the permission
to speak under 1 lie parliamentary
maneuver known as Ihe "right to
reply" to previous speakers.

Permission was granted im
mediately. He will speak as soon
as the Assembly convenes < 10:30
a.m. EDT). He would be squeezed
into the roster of debate first,
ahead of King Hussein of Jordan
and Prime Minister Jawaharlal
Nehru of India.
KHRUSHCHEV returned toNew
York last night from a weekend
at suburban Glen Cove, L.1., where
he said he would return to Amer
ica after his present visit and in
dicated that he believed Soviet-
American relations would relax
to the point where he could go
fishing on his next visit.
Upon returning to New York,
Khrushchev spent about 20 min
utes at the cocktail party by
Guinea. He refused to hold a for
mal news conference at the party,
but when asked about his conver
sations during the afternoon with
Algerian rebel leaders and the
possibility that Russia might rec
ognize the Algerian rebel govern
ment, Khrushchev said:
"IF THE PEOPLE of Algeria
are strong and continue fighting
for their independence they will
win it eventually. The Imperial
ists want to crush Algeria."
A member of the Algerian rebel
delegation said his party was
highly pleased with its talks with
Khrushchev.

will fully support Algerian inde
pendence." an Algerian rebel
