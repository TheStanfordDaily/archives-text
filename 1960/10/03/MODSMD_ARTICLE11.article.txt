No suspects have been found,
Assistant Fire Chief Frank Julian
reported.
MARINO WAS overcome by
smoke while trying to remove the
can emitting an unidentifiable
noxious gas. The can was placed

and then started to kick the burn

at the other end of the hall, pound
ing on doors and shouting as he
went.
Mal ino collapsed at the door

freshmen on the floor, warned by
Marino, poured out of the build
ing.
Fire equipment arrived about
7:53, and an inhalator was used
on Marino before he was taken
to Palo Alto-Stanford hospital. He
was released after treatment and
suffered no after-effects.
"I'VE BEEN HERE for 20
years, and I've seen a lot of tricks
pulled, but I've never seen any
thing like this, where a noxious
fire was deliberately set inside a
building," Fire Chief John Mar
ston told Madera men.
The chief later told a reporter
that if the fire had occurred in
the early morning hours the entire
first and second floors might have
been hospitalized. There were 88
boys in the dormitory, 32 on the
second floor.
Firemen said the fire did not
spread from the trash can and
no damage resulted.
