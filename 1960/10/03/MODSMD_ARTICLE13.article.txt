# An Endorsement
## 
### 
After careful deliberation and after an objective analysis of
parly platforms, The Stanford Daily endorses Senator John F. Ken
nedy for President of the United States.
This endorsement is made with some misgivings. Senator Ken
nedy leaves much to be desired, as has been stated in past Daily
editorials. His campaign speeches have indicated a disregard for
specifies and a tendency to deal in highly mystical abstractions.
Bnt Senator Kennedy is a nnin of dynamics, as opposed to
\ ice President Nixon, who seems satisfied lo run an administra
tion similar to ihe existing one; an administration which has been
rather feeble in its attempts to handle domestic and foreign
problems.
In the last eight years, Communism has strengthened ils posi
tion in the world while the United Slates has languished in the
depths of vacillation.
As in the earlier years of our history and as in the l ( )20"s and
30 s, America must once again prove that it is the land of challenge.
It must prove that it still has the fortitude and the desire to defeat
anti-democratic movements.
Senator Kennedy seems prepared to lead the challenge. Al
though his New Frontier concept is enigmatic, at least we know
that under his guidance America will once again be on the move,
that it. will not perish from intellectual and phvsieal stagnation.
I lie Democratic Party, as well as Senator Kennedy, is pre
pared to meet the challenge. Senator Kennedy has surrounded
himself with braintrusts, similar to those who gathered around
President Roosevelt. They are men of action, of new ideas, of hope.
What is the challenge? At home, it is the destruction of racial
prejudice, slums, the farm problem. Abroad, it is the destruction
of Communism. Communism cannot be destroyed by missiles and
the Strategic Air Command. It must be defeated bv words and
deeds, not threats. Communism, as every other totalitarian regime,
needs someone to blame everything on. Take away the scapegoat
and Communism will slowly wilt away. e arc Communism's
scapegoat.
\\ e are not sure that Senator Kennedy and the Democratic
Party are capable of ameliorating our hypocritical policies, but
we do know that President Eisenhower and the Republican Party
have proven incapable of following a straight line. Therefore, a
change is necessary. Hopefully, the change will be for ihe better.
Senator Kennedy is a gamble, for he will not maintain the status
quo and any change could conceivably be for the worse.
But we have been living under a regime of status quo for the
last eight years while the rest of the world moves forward. We,
too, must pick up momentum if we are to survive. In other decades
Americans have met the challenge. We are now faced with the
most serious challenge in our history, the challenge of "we will
bury you." There is a man who promises lo lead us through I lie
challenge.
As Senator Kennedy said: "If you are satisfied with the way
things are going, vole for Mr. Nixon. If you are not satisfied, vote
lor me. It is difficult to see how anyone can be satisfied.

As in the earlier years of our history and as in the l ( )20"s and
30 s, America must once again prove that it is the land of challenge.
It must prove that it still has the fortitude and the desire to defeat
anti-democratic movements.
Senator Kennedy seems prepared to lead the challenge. Al
though his New Frontier concept is enigmatic, at least we know
that under his guidance America will once again be on the move,
that it. will not perish from intellectual and phvsieal stagnation.
I lie Democratic Party, as well as Senator Kennedy, is pre
pared to meet the challenge. Senator Kennedy has surrounded
himself with braintrusts, similar to those who gathered around
President Roosevelt. They are men of action, of new ideas, of hope.
What is the challenge? At home, it is the destruction of racial
prejudice, slums, the farm problem. Abroad, it is the destruction
of Communism. Communism cannot be destroyed by missiles and
the Strategic Air Command. It must be defeated bv words and
deeds, not threats. Communism, as every other totalitarian regime,
needs someone to blame everything on. Take away the scapegoat
and Communism will slowly wilt away. e arc Communism's
scapegoat.
\\ e are not sure that Senator Kennedy and the Democratic
Party are capable of ameliorating our hypocritical policies, but
we do know that President Eisenhower and the Republican Party
have proven incapable of following a straight line. Therefore, a
change is necessary. Hopefully, the change will be for ihe better.
Senator Kennedy is a gamble, for he will not maintain the status
quo and any change could conceivably be for the worse.
But we have been living under a regime of status quo for the
last eight years while the rest of the world moves forward. We,
too, must pick up momentum if we are to survive. In other decades
Americans have met the challenge. We are now faced with the
most serious challenge in our history, the challenge of "we will
bury you." There is a man who promises lo lead us through I lie
challenge.
As Senator Kennedy said: "If you are satisfied with the way
things are going, vole for Mr. Nixon. If you are not satisfied, vote

After careful deliberation and after an objective analysis of
parly platforms, The Stanford Daily endorses Senator John F. Ken
nedy for President of the United States.
This endorsement is made with some misgivings. Senator Ken
nedy leaves much to be desired, as has been stated in past Daily
editorials. His campaign speeches have indicated a disregard for
specifies and a tendency to deal in highly mystical abstractions.
