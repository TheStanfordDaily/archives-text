# The 						Capitalist Dilemma
## 
### HOWARD RICHARDS Socialist Caucus Chairman 
"Wo are looking for a situation
Ihal will result in tho maximiza
tion of freedom for everyone con
cerned," said a spokesman for the
Conservatives at last Monday's
Poly Union debale. A Republican
gill also expressed the beliefs
that conservatives, Americanism,
capitalism and freedom are all the
same thing.
Our two pro-capitalist friends
were understandably disturbed at
the growing centralization and
bureaucratization of American
life. Individualism, self-reliance
and the dignity of the individual
are certainly high and worthy
ideals.
But is it true that capitalism
and freedom are the same thing?
After all, the charters of our
freedom were written when we
were an agricultural nation. The
landscape has changed: instead of
small family farms, we live in a
world of suburbs. Lockheed, Sun
nyvales and freeways. Is it not
probable that the economic means
for achieving democratic ideals
have also changed?
The key question is: How may
the freedom of the individual be
maximized in his new environ
ment?
Capitalism, which is essentially
the survival of 17th century prop
erty law into the 20 century, gives
a dismal answer to this question.
The individual, who could once
work whenever he chose, must
now seek the permission of an
entrepreneur to work—he must
"find a job."
The self-reliant farmer finds
that he must fit into the outward
ly casual but inwardly tense rit
uals of modern corporation job
holding and ladder-climbing.
The dignified individual finds
that in the central part of hi«
life his career—he is not an in
dividual at all but forty manhours
of obedience per week that is

sold at a price of so much per
hour.
And centralization— the bogey
of the conservatives —continues
apace. Every week new mergers
are announced. Groceries are re
placed by supermarkets, and su
permarkets by chains of super
markets. Steel, sparkplugs, cig
arettes, refrigerators and razor
blades are made by fewer and
fewer and bigger' and bigger
profit-machines.
The capitalist dilemma is that
while many of the capitalist na
tions are heirs of a proud tradi
tion of individual freedom, the de
velopment of modern capitalism
has been such that capitalism has
become in important respects,
antithetical to individual freedom.

Richards' article will be printed
tomorrow. It will analyze "Mod
