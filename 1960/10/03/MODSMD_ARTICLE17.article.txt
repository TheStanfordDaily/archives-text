The TV debate was a bold in
novation which i« bound lo be car
ried forward inlo future cam
paigns, and could not now be
abandoned. From now on it will
be impossible for any candidate
for any important elective office
to avoid this kind of confrontation
with his opponent. This will have
considerable consequences. One of
the most interesting is that it will
break down the synthetic candi
dates, the men who communicate
with the public only by reading
speeches that other men have
written. The TV confrontation
forces a man to speak for him
self. For while he will still be able
to recite passages written by
others—as both Kennedy and
Nixon did—the whole effect is
the product of the candidate him
self, and not of his ghost writers
and public relations men.

In 1 his first
try, which can be
improved in the
future, the main
impact was not
that of a real de
bate. It was the
showing, as no
other medium
could, of the two
personalities. TV,
it is often said, is

a truth machine. What the ma
chine revealed is hard to put into
words. But we may be sure that
the chief effect of what it re
vealed will not bo felt immediately
in the opinions of the voters but
on their unconscious attitude to
wards the two men. That is prob
ably the reason why immediately
after the debate it proved impos
sible to measure the effect on the
election.
Of the experiment itself, T
would make two criticisms. The
first is that the cameras, which
can be very searching: but can also
be cruel and at times unfair, were
very hard on Mr. Nixon. I do not
for a moment suggest that they
were intended to be unfair. Al
most; certainly, however, they
were not corrected for his photo
genie defects. They made him
look sick, which he is not, and
they made him look older and
more worn than he is. I do not
understand the technical reasons
for this. But they should be
studied. For it was a misrepresen
tation ami we must make sure for
the future that the cameras are
in fact impartial.
My second criticism is that, the
producer, as agreed to by the can
didates themselves, prevented the
exchange from becoming a genu
ine debate. The candidates should
be able to question one another,
subject to the right of the mod
erator to rule a question as out
of order. There is no reason, ex
cept; of course the prudence of
the candidates themselves, why
there should be interposed be
tween them a panel of inter
rogators.
Furthermore, in my view if
there is to be a genuine debate
which is to have a decisive in
fluence on a national election, an
hour is too short of time to tie
vote to domestic affairs. There is
something unsuitable in having
the two men, one of whom is to
be the next President of the
United States, told that they have
"three minutes and twenty sec
onds" to sum up. If these debates
are worth having at all, they
should be allowed to run on with
out rigid time limits until the two
principals themselves have had
their full say. If that proves to
be boring to some of the audi
ence, it will be enlightening 1o
the rest of it.
As for the show itself, each
person's reactions are personal
and subjective. My general feel
ing was that both men treated
each other with dignity and re
spect, and behaved as the citizens
of a free country are supposed to
behave.
My main surprise came from
the fact that I expected Mr. Nixon
to be more aggressive of the two.
It turned out that be was on the
defensive, responding to the chal
lenges which >Ir. Kennedy put to
him. I have since read the text of
the debate, and it supports this
impression of Kennedy's holding
the initiative. But the impression

is less vivid in the text than it
was, for me at least, in the view
ing. And I hat difference was due,
1 believe, to what the cameras
did to Mr. Nixon and to the gen
eral effect of his physical vitality
being lower than Mr. Kennedy's
In fact, so much did he seem
to be on the defensive that I be
came convinced that he was far
from happy and comfortable in
the position he occupies on Ihe
welfare measures, and on the
question of economic growth. It
would be only a little exaggerated
to say that he sounded as if he
wished he had Kennedy's side of
the argument. Certainly he had
no burning convictions against
the Kennedy position, and to my
ear he was diffident and apolo
getic in dealing with it.
This effect of being in a minor
key may well be the result —I am
reasonably sure it is'the result —
of his trying to deal with three
conflicting pressures, one coining
from the Gold water reactionaries,
one from the Rockefeller progres
sives, and one from the Eisen
hower record itself. As a result of
these pressures he looked and
sounded like a man who knew
that he was in a difficult position
and was determined to preserve
his dignity and to make the best
of it.

be impossible for any candidate
for any important elective office
to avoid this kind of confrontation
with his opponent. This will have
considerable consequences. One of
the most interesting is that it will
break down the synthetic candi
dates, the men who communicate
with the public only by reading
speeches that other men have
written. The TV confrontation
forces a man to speak for him
self. For while he will still be able
to recite passages written by
others—as both Kennedy and
Nixon did—the whole effect is
the product of the candidate him
self, and not of his ghost writers
and public relations men.

In 1 his first
try, which can be
improved in the
future, the main
impact was not
that of a real de
bate. It was the
showing, as no
other medium
could, of the two
personalities. TV,
it is often said, is

a truth machine. What the ma
chine revealed is hard to put into
words. But we may be sure that
the chief effect of what it re
vealed will not bo felt immediately
in the opinions of the voters but
on their unconscious attitude to
wards the two men. That is prob
ably the reason why immediately
after the debate it proved impos
sible to measure the effect on the
election.
Of the experiment itself, T
would make two criticisms. The
first is that the cameras, which
can be very searching: but can also
be cruel and at times unfair, were
very hard on Mr. Nixon. I do not
for a moment suggest that they
were intended to be unfair. Al
most; certainly, however, they
were not corrected for his photo
genie defects. They made him
look sick, which he is not, and
they made him look older and
more worn than he is. I do not
understand the technical reasons
for this. But they should be
studied. For it was a misrepresen
tation ami we must make sure for
the future that the cameras are
in fact impartial.
My second criticism is that, the
producer, as agreed to by the can
didates themselves, prevented the
exchange from becoming a genu
ine debate. The candidates should
be able to question one another,
subject to the right of the mod
erator to rule a question as out
of order. There is no reason, ex
cept; of course the prudence of
the candidates themselves, why
there should be interposed be
tween them a panel of inter
rogators.
Furthermore, in my view if
there is to be a genuine debate
which is to have a decisive in
fluence on a national election, an
hour is too short of time to tie
vote to domestic affairs. There is
something unsuitable in having
the two men, one of whom is to
be the next President of the
United States, told that they have
"three minutes and twenty sec
onds" to sum up. If these debates
are worth having at all, they
should be allowed to run on with
out rigid time limits until the two
principals themselves have had
their full say. If that proves to
be boring to some of the audi
ence, it will be enlightening 1o
the rest of it.
As for the show itself, each
person's reactions are personal
and subjective. My general feel
ing was that both men treated
each other with dignity and re
spect, and behaved as the citizens
of a free country are supposed to
behave.
My main surprise came from
the fact that I expected Mr. Nixon
to be more aggressive of the two.
It turned out that be was on the
defensive, responding to the chal
lenges which >Ir. Kennedy put to
him. I have since read the text of
the debate, and it supports this
impression of Kennedy's holding
the initiative. But the impression

is less vivid in the text than it
was, for me at least, in the view
ing. And I hat difference was due,
1 believe, to what the cameras
did to Mr. Nixon and to the gen
eral effect of his physical vitality
being lower than Mr. Kennedy's
In fact, so much did he seem
to be on the defensive that I be
came convinced that he was far
from happy and comfortable in
the position he occupies on Ihe
welfare measures, and on the
question of economic growth. It
would be only a little exaggerated
to say that he sounded as if he
wished he had Kennedy's side of
the argument. Certainly he had
no burning convictions against
the Kennedy position, and to my
ear he was diffident and apolo
getic in dealing with it.
This effect of being in a minor
key may well be the result —I am
reasonably sure it is'the result —
of his trying to deal with three
conflicting pressures, one coining
from the Gold water reactionaries,
one from the Rockefeller progres
sives, and one from the Eisen
hower record itself. As a result of
these pressures he looked and
sounded like a man who knew
that he was in a difficult position
and was determined to preserve
his dignity and to make the best
of it.

break down the synthetic candi
dates, the men who communicate
with the public only by reading
speeches that other men have
written. The TV confrontation
forces a man to speak for him
self. For while he will still be able
to recite passages written by
others—as both Kennedy and
Nixon did—the whole effect is
the product of the candidate him
self, and not of his ghost writers
and public relations men.

In 1 his first
try, which can be
improved in the
future, the main
impact was not
that of a real de
bate. It was the
showing, as no
other medium
could, of the two
personalities. TV,
it is often said, is

a truth machine. What the ma
chine revealed is hard to put into
words. But we may be sure that
the chief effect of what it re
vealed will not bo felt immediately
in the opinions of the voters but
on their unconscious attitude to
wards the two men. That is prob
ably the reason why immediately
after the debate it proved impos
sible to measure the effect on the
election.
Of the experiment itself, T
would make two criticisms. The
first is that the cameras, which
can be very searching: but can also
be cruel and at times unfair, were
very hard on Mr. Nixon. I do not
for a moment suggest that they
were intended to be unfair. Al
most; certainly, however, they
were not corrected for his photo
genie defects. They made him
look sick, which he is not, and
they made him look older and
more worn than he is. I do not
understand the technical reasons
for this. But they should be
studied. For it was a misrepresen
tation ami we must make sure for
the future that the cameras are
in fact impartial.
My second criticism is that, the
producer, as agreed to by the can
didates themselves, prevented the
exchange from becoming a genu
ine debate. The candidates should
be able to question one another,
subject to the right of the mod
erator to rule a question as out
of order. There is no reason, ex
cept; of course the prudence of
the candidates themselves, why
there should be interposed be
tween them a panel of inter
rogators.
Furthermore, in my view if
there is to be a genuine debate
which is to have a decisive in
fluence on a national election, an
hour is too short of time to tie
vote to domestic affairs. There is
something unsuitable in having
the two men, one of whom is to
be the next President of the
United States, told that they have
"three minutes and twenty sec
onds" to sum up. If these debates
are worth having at all, they
should be allowed to run on with
out rigid time limits until the two
principals themselves have had
their full say. If that proves to
be boring to some of the audi
ence, it will be enlightening 1o
the rest of it.
As for the show itself, each
person's reactions are personal
and subjective. My general feel
ing was that both men treated
each other with dignity and re
spect, and behaved as the citizens
of a free country are supposed to
behave.
My main surprise came from
the fact that I expected Mr. Nixon
to be more aggressive of the two.
It turned out that be was on the
defensive, responding to the chal
lenges which >Ir. Kennedy put to
him. I have since read the text of
the debate, and it supports this
impression of Kennedy's holding
the initiative. But the impression

is less vivid in the text than it
was, for me at least, in the view
ing. And I hat difference was due,
1 believe, to what the cameras
did to Mr. Nixon and to the gen
eral effect of his physical vitality
being lower than Mr. Kennedy's
In fact, so much did he seem
to be on the defensive that I be
came convinced that he was far
from happy and comfortable in
the position he occupies on Ihe
welfare measures, and on the
question of economic growth. It
would be only a little exaggerated
to say that he sounded as if he
wished he had Kennedy's side of
the argument. Certainly he had
no burning convictions against
the Kennedy position, and to my
ear he was diffident and apolo
getic in dealing with it.
This effect of being in a minor
key may well be the result —I am
reasonably sure it is'the result —
of his trying to deal with three
conflicting pressures, one coining
from the Gold water reactionaries,
one from the Rockefeller progres
sives, and one from the Eisen
hower record itself. As a result of
these pressures he looked and
sounded like a man who knew
that he was in a difficult position
and was determined to preserve
his dignity and to make the best
of it.
