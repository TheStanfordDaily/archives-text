# Institute of International Relations Starts Quarter With Big Challenge
## 
### JOEL MEISTER Conference Vice president 
(Editor's Note: This is the first
in a series of four articles describ
ing the functions and philosophy
of the Institute of International
Relations.)

The Institute of International
Relations begins its 14th year
with a challenge of necessity. It
is necessary for us to provide the
best programs possible. It is nec
essary for you to take advantage
of them. The current session of
the United Nations Assembly
should leave most of us with no
doubts about the importance of
foreign affairs and the urgent
need for progress in the interna
tional relations field.
Through the Conference Divi
sion, IIR will bring to Stanford
this year important people, un
important but well informed peo
ple, scholars, students, films and
anyone or anything else which
can bring us all somewhat closer
to understanding our pressing in
ternational situation.
On October (», a noted film,
"Masters of the Congo .lungle,"
will be shown in Mem. And. This
program is the first of many this
quarter which will concern Africa.
In the last week of November a
two-day African Forum will ana
lyze the current status of the new
A f r i c a n countries, emerging
trends and our relations with the
country.
During Winter and Spring quar

j tors other programs of interna
tional scope will he presented. The
nationally known Foreign Policy
Institute will hold its fourth ses
sion this January or February.
But for the present, let us con
centrate on the challenge which
the IIR brings to us as students.
Compared to I ho students of Asia
or Latin America, we in the
United States have always seemed
apathetic politically.
Last year something happened.
Even Life magazine took note.
But in perhaps one of it« greater
misappraisals it decided that
American students had probably
been more "mature" in the past
by staying out of politics. We
think, however, 1hat criticism of
the established order, the sit-in
demonstrations or whatever form
the criticism takes, short of vio
lence, is an indication of maturity.
We have seen it here at Stan
ford. Petitions to abolish capital
punishment and collections for
demonstrators in the South have
vied with dance lickot sales on
Engineering Corner. Great inter
est and enthusiasm were shown
last Spring at Mi". Nixon's and
Mr. Kennedy's appearances.

Is all this activity simply the
<'tt<>ct of an election year? The
lilt in particular, hopes not. The
presidential campaign should in
dicate that emphasis on more
deadly defenses and on increases
in foreign aid will take us, in the
end, nowhere unless imagination
and understanding are employed
at the same time. This must he
true not. only of the candidates
hut of us, the electorate and the
electoral e-to-be.
Assuming that Stanford stu
dents are endowed with vigorous
imaginations, the lIR urges you,
as never before, 1o participate in
its activities as a slop toward bet
ter understanding of our current
and t r a d i t i on a 1 international
problems.

But for the present, let us con
centrate on the challenge which
the IIR brings to us as students.
Compared to I ho students of Asia

United States have always seemed
apathetic politically.
Last year something happened.
Even Life magazine took note.
But in perhaps one of it« greater
misappraisals it decided that
American students had probably
been more "mature" in the past
by staying out of politics. We
think, however, 1hat criticism of
the established order, the sit-in
demonstrations or whatever form
the criticism takes, short of vio
lence, is an indication of maturity.
We have seen it here at Stan
ford. Petitions to abolish capital
punishment and collections for
demonstrators in the South have
vied with dance lickot sales on
Engineering Corner. Great inter
est and enthusiasm were shown
last Spring at Mi". Nixon's and
Mr. Kennedy's appearances.

Is all this activity simply the
<'tt<>ct of an election year? The
lilt in particular, hopes not. The
presidential campaign should in
dicate that emphasis on more
deadly defenses and on increases
in foreign aid will take us, in the
end, nowhere unless imagination
and understanding are employed
at the same time. This must he
true not. only of the candidates
hut of us, the electorate and the
electoral e-to-be.

The Institute of International

should leave most of us with no
doubts about the importance of
foreign affairs and the urgent
need for progress in the interna

Through the Conference Divi

this year important people, un

anyone or anything else which
can bring us all somewhat closer
to understanding our pressing in
