# Top Demo Party Aide Sure of Kennedy Win
## 
### MAYNARD PARKER Managing Editor 
Senator Kennedy's top braintrust flew into Stanford Saturday
to help dedicate the Bernard De Voto collection at the library, but
the Harvard Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. seemed more inter
ested in talking politics.
The man who writes many of Kennedy's speeches said, "I am

much more optimistic than I was
two weeks ago."
"The more Kennedy talks, the
more Stevenson talks; and the
moit? Nixon talks, the more I
think that Kennedy will win."
AND IT IS important to the
rapid- talking, conservatively
dressed liberal that Jack Kennedy
wins.
For it is Schlesinger. along with
economist John Kenneth Gal
braith, whose ideas make up I he
Democratic Platform. And Schles
inger's interpretation of history,
that strong presidents alternate
with weak ones, forms the basic
assumption of Kennedy's plank.
Kennedy's campaign is built
around Sehlesinger's theory that
the nation is facing a crisis, as it
was in the Great Depression of
1933.
"IT IS A MUCH different kind
of crisis than it was in 1933, when
mass unemployment was com
mon. It is less tangible but not
any less serious," Schlesinger be
lieves.
"Jack is doing a wonderful job
of bringing this two-point crisis
home to the people in his speeches
and in his writings," says Schles
inger.
Whether Kennedy is successful,
Schlesinger believes, hinges on
which way New York and Cali
fornia turn. "These two states are
always important, but this year
they are doubly important. Who
ever wins them wins the nation."
TURNING to the offensive,
Schlesinger attacked Nixon for
wanting a morilorium on foreign
policy debate while Khrushchev is
in the country.
Blasts Schlesinger, "I think it
is h shocking idea to cut off de
bate on foreign policy when "K"
is in the country. It shows a very
limited faith in democracy espe
cially when it serves a partisan
means."
The touchy religious issue
doesn't bother Schlesinger. "I
don't think Jack is ailing on his
religion it (nay hurt him in the
Bible belts but it isn't an im
portant issue."
The Southern States question
doesn't bother Schlesinger, "The
Johnson nomination was a states
manlike thing to d<> it implicates
the South."


LOOK AT BOOKâ€”Harvard Historian Arthur Schlesinger,
jr., right, and John Lickinger, look over one of Schlesinger's
books on Franklin D. Roosevelt during a pause in the recep
tion for Bernard DeVoto yesterday in the Bender Room of
the Main Library.
