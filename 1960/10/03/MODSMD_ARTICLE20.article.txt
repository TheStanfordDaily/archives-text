# Black Day For AAWU Grid Teams
## 
### 
It was a black day Saturday
for ihe Athletic Association of
Western Universities, as the only
school to escape defeat was
UCLA, which did not plav.
A 31-yard field goal in the final
14 seconds of play sent Washing
ton's highly ranked Huskies down
to stunning 15-14 defeat at the
hands of Navy Saturday after
noon.
THE ROSE BOWL champions,
who entered the game ranked
third in the nation, never could
break loose against the spirited
Middies. Washington scored first,
but Navy matched them touch
down for touchdown in the first
and third periods, missing only
the extra points, to set up the
last-second heroics.
With only two minutes to go,
the Huskies' two-point load
seemed safe as Quarterback Bob
Schloredt dropped back to punt.
But Schloredt fumbled the pass
from center and Navy took over
on ihe Washington 24, and Greg
ory Mather of the Middies capi
talized on I lie opportunity a few
plays later with his game-winning
kick.
Another AAWU "power," at

ITSCl T SC Trojans went down to their
third consecutive loss against
Ohio State, 20-0.
THE VAUNTED Southern Cal
leam was shut out for the second
time in three games and now has
scored a total of six points for

unable to move the ball on the
ground and were plagued in the
air by four pass interceptions.
Fullback Bob Ferguson sparked
the Buckeyes, scoring all three
of their touchdowns on runs of
74, 2 and 19 yards.
California held Army at bay j
for three quarters, but. then the i
floodgates opened up and the
Golden Bears were swamped by j
the Cadets, 28-10.
LEADING BY TEN points at
Ihe half and by four points enter
ing the final period, Cal was un
able to cope with Ihe line plunges
of Army fullback A 1 .Rushatz and
Ihe passing of quarterback Tom
Blanda, and the Black Knights
roared 1o three touchdowns in
seven minutes to put the game
out of reach.
Coast independents also faced
tough going Saturday night, j
Washington State lost to Arizona
State at Tempe, 24-21, while Ore
gon State held off a late Houston
rush to win 29-20, and Oregon
rallied to nip Utah 20-17.
