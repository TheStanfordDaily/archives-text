# Curtice Is Stoical
## 
### 
Jack Curtice has about the stiff
est upper lip around these days.
"They were trying so hard," the
Stanford coach moaned after the
Air Academy gave his Indi
ans their third straight beating
Saturday. "And that scoreboard
didn't nearly tell the story of the i
game.
"THIS MAY sound silly," he
sighed, "but I believe in my
heart that we'd have won if that
penalty hadn't nullified Face's
touchdown. Why that would have
put the pressure on the Air Force
and we just might have done it."
Somebody ventured that this
was the first time this year that
Stanford had looked better in the
second half than it had in the first.
His face lit up like a convict
being given a reprieve at the
chance to talk about a silver lin
ing among the dismal cloudiness
of the afternoon.
"YES, IT looks like the platoon
idea is a good one," Curtice said
he had played two and three men
at every position on both offense
and defense—"and it's great for
morale, too. Those boys all want
to play and I surely want to let
them.
"Those teams we play have so
much depth thai platooning'is the
only way we can exist. We didn't
have any serious injuries today
either, and this was probably bo
cause the kids were fresher and

didn't get knocked around as
much in the second half."
Not wanting to return to as
pects of the game best left for
gotten, one benevolent reporter
mentioned a few blocks by C. B.
Simons.
For the second time that after
noon, Curtice grinned. And he had
help in this discussion.
"OH, HE'S a good 'un, he is,"
Cactus said.
"He's really got what it takes,"
said assistant coach Andy Ever
est. "C.B. is big and fast and
mean. He's a real comer."
Simons, but a sophomore, is in
deed big and fast, and there is
sufficient evidence as to his mean
ness. One referee was so im
pressed by it that he tossed C.B.
out of a game. Admittedly that
was last week against Wisconsin,
but you can't impress all of the
people all of the time.
No one wished to change the
prevailing calm by mentioning
Stanford's next opponent, Wash
ington, so the gathering died
away.
Later on the plane, however,
assistant coach Homer Smith put
his finger on the situation when
he came over to congratulate Gary
Craig on his continued excellent
punting.
"Let's get ready for the Husk
ies," he said softly. "It'll be the
upset of the year if we win."

"OH, HE'S a good 'un, he is,"
Cactus said.
"He's really got what it takes,"
said assistant coach Andy Ever
est. "C.B. is big and fast and
mean. He's a real comer."
Simons, but a sophomore, is in
deed big and fast, and there is
sufficient evidence as to his mean
ness. One referee was so im
pressed by it that he tossed C.B.
out of a game. Admittedly that
was last week against Wisconsin,
but you can't impress all of the
people all of the time.
No one wished to change the
prevailing calm by mentioning
Stanford's next opponent, Wash
ington, so the gathering died
away.
Later on the plane, however,
assistant coach Homer Smith put
his finger on the situation when
he came over to congratulate Gary
Craig on his continued excellent
punting.
"Let's get ready for the Husk
ies," he said softly. "It'll be the
upset of the year if we win."

Jack Curtice has about the stiff
est upper lip around these days.
"They were trying so hard," the
Stanford coach moaned after the
Air Academy gave his Indi
ans their third straight beating
Saturday. "And that scoreboard
didn't nearly tell the story of the i
game.
"THIS MAY sound silly," he
sighed, "but I believe in my
heart that we'd have won if that
penalty hadn't nullified Face's
touchdown. Why that would have
put the pressure on the Air Force
and we just might have done it."
Somebody ventured that this
was the first time this year that
Stanford had looked better in the
second half than it had in the first.
His face lit up like a convict
being given a reprieve at the
chance to talk about a silver lin
ing among the dismal cloudiness
of the afternoon.
"YES, IT looks like the platoon
idea is a good one," Curtice said
he had played two and three men
at every position on both offense
and defense—"and it's great for
morale, too. Those boys all want
to play and I surely want to let
them.
"Those teams we play have so
much depth thai platooning'is the
only way we can exist. We didn't
have any serious injuries today
either, and this was probably bo
cause the kids were fresher and

didn't get knocked around as
much in the second half."
Not wanting to return to as
pects of the game best left for
gotten, one benevolent reporter
mentioned a few blocks by C. B.
Simons.
For the second time that after
noon, Curtice grinned. And he had
help in this discussion.
