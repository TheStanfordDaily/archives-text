PITTSBURGH (UPI) â€” Vern

he "probably" will be ready to
face Ihe New York Yankees in
Wednesday's World Series opener
although he held off his final de
cision until he works out tomor
row.
Pittsburgh Manager Danny
Murtaugh was encouraged by
Law's optimism but delayed defi
nite word on whether he would
start the 30-year-old right-hander
Wednesday until he got the green
light from Law himself.
