# Ike Turns Down Talk Proposal
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPH Pres
ident Eisenhower tonight rejected
a suggestion by five neutral na
tions that he meet with Soviet
Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev. In
view of present Soviet attitudes
he saw no reason to believe such
talks would accomplish anything.
Eisenhower told the leaders of
the five countries, in a letter sent
separately to each, that he under
stood and sympathized with then
motives in making the proposal.
But he added:
"I would not wish to participate
in a mere gesture which, in pres
ent circumstances, might convey
a thoroughly misleading and un
fortunate impression to the peo
pies of the world."
IN TURNING down the neu
tralists' suggestion, Eisenhower
made several specific points on
which he said the Soviets ap
peared to have "undertaken with
deliberate intent a policy of in
creasing tension throughout the
world."
He laid down again the condi
tion which he said the Soviets
must meet before there can be
any chance of hi-s meeting at the
summit with Khrushchev. One ol
these involved the shooting dowr
of a U.S. RB47 airplane and the
capture of two of its crewmen
who still are being held incom
municado by the Russians.
The White House emphasized
in releasing the text of Eisen
bower's letter, that the Chief Ex
ecutive was repeating these con
ditions purely to explain to the
neutralist leaders his refusal tr.
see Khrushchev, and not out oj
any feeling that the Soviets migh
have relented on any of the points
THIS LETTER, forwarded im
mediately to the five leader;
through the U.S. Delegation at th(
United Nations, was released aftei
Eisenhower spent a busy day con
ferring with Prime Ministers Har
old Macmillan of Britain anc
Robert G. Menzies of Australia
and with his top foreign policj
advisers.
In his letter to the five neu
tralist leaders, Eisenhower laic
down three steeps by which ar
eventual summit meeting wit!
Khrushchev and other heads o
government might be achieved.
He said, first, "If the Sovie
Union seriously desires a reduc
tion in tensions it can readilj
pave the way for useful negoti
at ions by actions in the Unitec
Nations and elsewhere."
.SECONDLY, Herter and othei
American officials "are alway;
available" if Russian representa
tives "should wish to discuss con
crete measures to reduce ten
sions."
Thirdly, if "such exploratory
discussions reveal that the Sovie
Union is prepared to return to tin
path of peaceful negotiations witt
some prospect of fruitful results
then I personally would be pre
pared to meet and negotiate wit!
the representative of the Sovie
government and with the head;
of other governments as their in
terests were involved."

ferring with Prime Ministers Har
old Macmillan of Britain anc
Robert G. Menzies of Australia
and with his top foreign policj
advisers.
In his letter to the five neu
tralist leaders, Eisenhower laic
down three steeps by which ar
eventual summit meeting wit!
Khrushchev and other heads o
government might be achieved.
He said, first, "If the Sovie
Union seriously desires a reduc
tion in tensions it can readilj
pave the way for useful negoti
at ions by actions in the Unitec
Nations and elsewhere."
.SECONDLY, Herter and othei
American officials "are alway;
available" if Russian representa
tives "should wish to discuss con
crete measures to reduce ten
sions."
Thirdly, if "such exploratory
discussions reveal that the Sovie
Union is prepared to return to tin
path of peaceful negotiations witt
some prospect of fruitful results
then I personally would be pre
pared to meet and negotiate wit!
the representative of the Sovie
government and with the head;
of other governments as their in
terests were involved."
WASHINGTON (UPH Pres
ident Eisenhower tonight rejected
a suggestion by five neutral na
tions that he meet with Soviet
Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev. In
view of present Soviet attitudes
he saw no reason to believe such
talks would accomplish anything.
Eisenhower told the leaders of
the five countries, in a letter sent
separately to each, that he under
stood and sympathized with then
motives in making the proposal.
But he added:
"I would not wish to participate
in a mere gesture which, in pres
ent circumstances, might convey
a thoroughly misleading and un
fortunate impression to the peo
pies of the world."
IN TURNING down the neu
tralists' suggestion, Eisenhower
made several specific points on
which he said the Soviets ap
peared to have "undertaken with
deliberate intent a policy of in
creasing tension throughout the
world."
He laid down again the condi
tion which he said the Soviets
must meet before there can be
any chance of hi-s meeting at the
summit with Khrushchev. One ol
these involved the shooting dowr
of a U.S. RB47 airplane and the
capture of two of its crewmen
who still are being held incom
municado by the Russians.
The White House emphasized
in releasing the text of Eisen
bower's letter, that the Chief Ex
ecutive was repeating these con
ditions purely to explain to the
neutralist leaders his refusal tr.
see Khrushchev, and not out oj
any feeling that the Soviets migh
have relented on any of the points
