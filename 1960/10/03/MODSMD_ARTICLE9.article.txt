KZSU, Stanford's student-oper
ated radio station, returns to the
air at 4 p.m. today, with a full
complement of programs for the
fall quarter. A number of new
programs will be heard, in addi
tion to the old schedule.
Familiar to KZSU listeners will
be Mike Ledgerwood's interviews}
and comments on the "Sports
Scene" Thursday evenings at 7:30
and Stew Gillmor's presentation
of progressive jazz Friday nights
at 8:30 on "Swingshift." "As You
Like It," music of the '30's and
'40's, moves to a new time, 7:30

COMPLETE REPORTS of na

again be presented six times each
night.
New in this year's schedule are

discuss and defend his editorial
stand with interested students
every Thursday evening at 8
o'clock; and Marty Mandles who
will be putting himself "On a
Limb" at 7 p.m. Tuesdays, Wed

Returning to KZSU is Stanford
Sadie, "Siren of the Airwaves."
Her traditional fall quarter ap
pearances, interrupted only in the
last two years when KZSU was
off the air, will occur Monday
evenings at 8:30.
THIS YEAR'S Sadie has a spec
tacular history of mystery, advice
to t he lovelorn and Date-with-
Sadie contests, which began in
1946 when KZSU first went on
the air. Production is already un
der way on the I960 Sadie howâ€”
all that is needed is a Sadie.
In past years, many glamorous
ladies have reigned as the sultry
siren, their identities unmasked
only at the end of the quarter.
Any girls interested in audition
ing for the role of Sadie or in
trying out for the production staff
have been asked to call DA 5-0880
or to drop by the KZSU studios
in the back of Memorial Hall.
KZSU broadcasts on a carrier
current transmission system,
separate transmitters being locat
ed in each dormitory. A complete
listing of KZSU's programs will
be found every day in the Daily
on page four.
