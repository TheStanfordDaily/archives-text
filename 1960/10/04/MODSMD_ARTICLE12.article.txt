# Dollies Turn Into Women!
## 
### 
Many of Stanford's freshman
girls will become S t a n I' o i d
women tonight provided the
Farm's senior men are on their
toes and have noted that a full
moon is scheduled to sail over
Inner Quad about midnight.
For the uninitiated, Stanford
tradition holds that no coed is
a Stanford woman until she has
been kissed by a senior on Inner
Quad at the stroke of midnight
on a full moon night.
This is the way it is supposed
to go. Daily members can attest,
however, that it is not unkown
for underclassmen (andwomen)
also to somehow wander onto
Inner Quad as the Man in the
Moon casts his romantic glow
over Leland's memorial.
