Education Vice President
The current news from the
United Nations has once again
headlined the ideological conflicts
in Ihe world community. Because
these meetings are being held in
New York, the American people
have become more aware than
ever before of the involvement of
our nation in international rela
tions and of the role our top lead
ers have played in similar meet
ings in more distant parts of the
globe.
While U.N. issues capture the
headlines, and agreement or com
promise seems currently unattain
able, work continues to be done
behind the scenes for the improve
ment of international relations.
Programs of the U.N. in health,
education, technical assistance,
welfare and economic aid con
tinue to function.
This practical aid accomplished
through the U.N. or on a nation
to nation basis eventually has its
effect on political negotiations
and discussions. Consequently,
the individual citizen's critical
analysis of the United States' in
ternational policies and U.N. pol
icies is important if these are to
become more effective in increas
ing international relations.
The Institute of International
Relations here at Stanford is en
deavoring to offer to all students
programs in which information
about international issues and
problems is presented, followed
by the opportunity for discussion
and analysis. Further, through
ihe Institute students in all fields
of study may utilize their creativ
ity, ideas, and capabilities to con
tribute to progress in interna
tional understanding.
The lIR conference programs
contribute to the dissemination
of international information. In
conjunction with these programs,
the Education Division offers the
student an opportunity to work in
specific areas of concern or con
tact. The United Nations Educa
tion desk publishes "The United
Nations News," distributed

through the living groups and to
subscribing high schools.
Similarly, it has sponsored a
weekly newscast of United Na
tions events over KZSU. Trained
Stanford delegates attend the an
nual Model United Nations held
on the California campus. News
letters, U.N. publications ami sim
ilar international reading ma
terials are kept on file for the
reference of students.
In another field, the Affilia
tions Department, arranges the
programs for exchange scholars
to universities overseas with
whom we currently have an af
filiation. The extension of this
program is planned along with
the formation of cultural ex
changes with other universities.
The Stanford Overseas Relief
Organization will sponsor this
quarter the drive for funds for
the World University Service,
which through its international
headquarters in Switzerland as
sists students and educational
programs throughout the world.
In addition, SIRO forms a chan
nel through which Stanford stu
dents can assist in world disaster
areas.
Students interested in travel
abroad will find the Stanford
Overseas Information Service an
outlet for travel information, tips,
and traveler education. This de
partment will publish "Travel
Tips" during winter quarter, and
provide a program during Travel
Week to discuss the opportuni
ties and representative obliga
tions of traveling abroad. Return
ing travelers and foreign students
presently on the Stanford campus
will present their views on inter
national relations to the students
through the IIR magazine, "The
Bridge," to be published several
times during the academic year.
These departments of the Ed
ucational Division, though dedi
cated to certain fields of interest,
are not isolated from one another
nor limited in expansion. The ini
tiative of students in all fields
can be utilized to improve inter
national relations once the con
cern for international problems is
awakened and the desire to act
constructively in some field is
kindled.
