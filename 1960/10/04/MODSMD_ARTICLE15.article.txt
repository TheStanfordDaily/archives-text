# Socialist Alternatives

### HOWARD RICHARDS Socialist Caucus Chairman 
Democratic socialism is often
Ihought of as a sort of half-way
station between capitalism and
communism. It is thought to be
an attempt to make the best of
both worlds —to adopt the more
efficient economic system of the
Soviet Union while retaining the
democracy and civil liberties of
the West.
To some extent at least it is
true that most Socialists propose
to both these things. But to char
acterize socialism in these terms
is to miss the point. It is to over
look the main trend of modern
socialists' thinking.
Socialism sets itself a task no
less than the Immunization of the
conditions of life —the accomoda
tion of the machine to human life
rather than human life to the
machine.
I refer to the writing of such
modern radical thinkers as Erich
Fromm, Daniel Bell, Mahatma
Gandhi and Aldous Huxley. I re
fer to such social experiments as
the Kibbutzim of Israel, the
Worker Management Councils of
Yugoslavia and Sweden, the
worker-ownership program of
Olivetti (typewriters) in Italy
and the internal government of
the International Typographical
Union in the U.S.A.
Modern socialism is democratic
not only politically, but economic
ally. Economic democracy means
the participation of the individual
in the conduct of his life on the
job; it means the dignity of the
individual as a partner in a social
enterprise rather than a commod
ity in the "labor market."
What conservatives need to re
member is that a regime can be
democratic politically hut author
itarian economically. They need
to realize, too, that there is an
other alternative besides control
by the federal government — the
alternative of reorganization of
our private institutions.
This is true decentralism. It is
not a phony decentralism where
Washington steps aside for Wall
Street or Madison Avenue to take

lover. It is putting Ihe means of
j production in the hands of the
people.
At the same time modern social
ism stands, as socialists have al
! ways stood, for the principle of
the brotherhood of man and our
common human responsibility to
help those in need. Socialism will
mean that no one need fear un
employment, that no one need
fear hunger, that no one need fear
lack of medical care in his old age.
And the overcoming of insecur
ity, too, is a part of freedom.
For, in a very profound sense, is
it not our insecurity that prevents
us from becoming truly free?
