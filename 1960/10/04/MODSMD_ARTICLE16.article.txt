, Dear Editor:
The Daily declared "a change is
necessary" as its reason for en
dorsing Kenedy over Nixon. May
be there is room for improvement
in the United States, but this
doesn't necessarily mean that
Kennedy is the logical choice
for the Presidency.
Even forgetting Kennedy's far
from brilliant past political ca
reer, we must hesitate in our sup
port when we look to his stand.
Even the Daily believes that Ken
nedy deals in "highly mystical
abstractions." There is one defi
nite point, though. Kennedy's
braintruster, Arthur Schlesinger,
Jr., makes this point clear when
he states that a whopping $10-12
billion increase in federal spend
ing would be necessary to pay for
Kennedy's programs. Thus, Ken
nedy's weak past and expensive
future hardly forecast much of
a New Frontier.
On the other hand, Nixon's
stand is hardly Ihe status quo.
Rather he advocates a mildly lib
eral program including federal
aid for school construction and
medical care for the needy aged
at only one-third to one-half the
cost of his opponent's program.
Should wo run to oblivion under
Kennedy's "enigmatic" concepts
or walk to greatness under
Nixon's concrete proposals?
