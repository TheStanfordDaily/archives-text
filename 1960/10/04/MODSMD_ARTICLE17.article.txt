Dear Editor:
A misquotation in Saturday's
Palo Alto Times may have caused
resentment and grievance among
Stanford students, in particular
freshmen.
Allow mo to present the cor
rect version of the relevant re
marks. In a letter addressed to
the local Board of Education I
followed some warnings about
the slowness of American school
education by:
"As newly appointed freshman
adviser at Stanford, 1 see the out
come of the American system and
can compare 17- 18-year-old uni
versity entrants on the two sides
of the Atlantic. Granted, your
boys have the maturity of south
ern rather than northern Euro
peans, but their English, Math
and other skills are one to two
years behind. Their knowledge as
it is lacks that assuredness which
only comes with early learning."
This was meant to indicate that
the maturity of the American stu
dent seems ABOVE average. The
newspaper version indicated the
contrary, to my dismay.

Dear Editor:
According to Dale Carnegie's
formula for winning friends and
influencing people, criticism is
much more effective if it is pre
ceded by a compliment. So duti
fully following his sage advice, I
will say that I do think "The Pen
insula's Only Morning News
paper" is indeed a fine one. How
ever . . .
I am far from being an ardent
supporter of Governor Williams
but I did object to the wording—
or rather a word—in the front
page article of September 29. This
presumably was a news story; yet
the instigator—with all it:, un
pleasant connotations—was used
to describe Governor Williams.
The literal meaning of the word
instigator, like the word propa
ganda, is quite respectable. Never
theless, according to my diction
ary, "instigate always implies re
sponsibility for initiating the ac
tion and usually connotes a bad
or evil purpose."
It is in a sense a compliment to
your responsible journalism that
one word should impress me
enough to write "a letter to the

Dear Editor:
A week ago in Monterey there
was a forum conducted in refer
ence to the riots in San Francisco
when the House Committee on
Un-American Activities was hold
ing its session in Ihe City Hall.
The question which we learned
at the forum when we arrived
there was whether or not we
could retain our civil liberties and
still have internal security against

the inroads of communism, par
ticularly. My close friend, Ad
miral Raymond Spruance, and I
took tho stand that while tho Com
mittee might leave a good deal
to bo desired, that at tho present
time it was the only moans avail
able to tho FBI to definitely de
termine those who were using
subversive tactics to mislead par
ticularly the students in our
country.
Neither one of us thinks that
the Committee is a perfect setup,
but it is the best thing available,
and we both felt that until some
thing bettor i« devised that we
had better hang on to it and sup
port it.
Anyone who reads Karl Marx
knows that one of his basic doc
trines was to roach the youth in
countries that were to be taken
over and it was pretty evident, in
fact an established fact, that the
riots in San Francisco were the
result of definite leadership on
the part of well-known Commun
ists working on the University of
California student body.
A great deal of the weakness of
the Committee is flue to the fact
that the late Senator McCarthy
misused it unquestionably, but
nevertheless, Ihe basic fact re
mains that loyal Americans never
hesitate to swear to the fact or
to take loyalty oaths whenever
they are asked 10. Tho writer fools
that tho civil liberty issue is used
as a screen behind which Com
munist sympathizers hide when
they need a shield of any kind.
The foregoing was prompted by
the fact that Governor Williams
of Michigan made a speech, I be
lieve directly to the Stanford stu
dents, berating the deceased Sen
ator McCarthy, advocating the
reappeal of the Un-American Ac

tivities Committee, if I road his
quotations correctly, criticising
Nixon vigorously and advocating
the election of Senator Kennedy,
II is my privilege to know both
Nixon and Cabot Lodge person
ally. I cannot think of a bolter
trained or equipped toam to han
dlo our international problems
which, whether wo like it or not,
is principally the conduct of the
cold war with Russia.

Dear Kriitor:
In Monday's issue, the Daily en
dorsed Senator Kennedy. To take
such a step tho editors must have
disregarded many i m p or t ant
facts, if indeed thoyo wore not
ignorant of thom in the first
place.
You slate lhat "in the last eight
years Communism has strength
ened itself in the world, while
the United States has languished
in Ihe depths of vacillation." If
vacillation means ending tho
Korean War, preventing a war in
Lebanon, and being on tho win
ning side of every major U.N.
vote, thon lot's vacillate some
more.

One cannot possibly prefer the
Democratic record before Eisen
hower and Nixon, if you believe
that Communism has strength
ened itself lately, ask yourself
what ole Harry Truman was doing
while the Communists "strength
ened themselves" by swallowing
up Poland, Hungary, Albania,
C/echslovakia, Bulgaria, China,
North Kniva, Manchuria, etc. You
say the Democratic Party is ready
to meet the challenge. Unfor
tunately we already have seen
how they "meet the challenge."
"Senator Kennedy has sur
rounded himself with braintrusts
similar to those which gathered

around Roosevelt," you say. If
this is so to be desired ask your
self where the hraintrust was and
what good it did while Roosevelt
watched Hitler conquer Europe
and when Roosevelt sold Eastern
Europe out at Yalta, against the
advice of Churchill.
I can agree with only one of
your statements. "Senator Ken
nedy is a gamble." But can we
really afford to gamble while he
gets on-the-job training in Wash
ington? Nixon has over seven
years of experience, the confi
dence of Eisenhower, and i* any
thing but a gamble.

Dear Kriitor:
In Monday's issue, the Daily en
dorsed Senator Kennedy. To take
such a step tho editors must have
disregarded many i m p or t ant
facts, if indeed thoyo wore not
ignorant of thom in the first
place.
You slate lhat "in the last eight
years Communism has strength
ened itself in the world, while
the United States has languished
in Ihe depths of vacillation." If
vacillation means ending tho
Korean War, preventing a war in
Lebanon, and being on tho win
ning side of every major U.N.
vote, thon lot's vacillate some
more.

One cannot possibly prefer the
Democratic record before Eisen
hower and Nixon, if you believe
that Communism has strength
ened itself lately, ask yourself
what ole Harry Truman was doing
while the Communists "strength
ened themselves" by swallowing
up Poland, Hungary, Albania,
C/echslovakia, Bulgaria, China,
North Kniva, Manchuria, etc. You
say the Democratic Party is ready
to meet the challenge. Unfor
tunately we already have seen
how they "meet the challenge."
"Senator Kennedy has sur
rounded himself with braintrusts
similar to those which gathered

around Roosevelt," you say. If
this is so to be desired ask your
self where the hraintrust was and
what good it did while Roosevelt
watched Hitler conquer Europe
and when Roosevelt sold Eastern
Europe out at Yalta, against the
advice of Churchill.
I can agree with only one of
your statements. "Senator Ken
nedy is a gamble." But can we
really afford to gamble while he
gets on-the-job training in Wash
ington? Nixon has over seven
years of experience, the confi
dence of Eisenhower, and i* any
thing but a gamble.

Dear Editor:
A week ago in Monterey there
was a forum conducted in refer
ence to the riots in San Francisco
when the House Committee on
Un-American Activities was hold
ing its session in Ihe City Hall.
The question which we learned
at the forum when we arrived
there was whether or not we
could retain our civil liberties and
still have internal security against

the inroads of communism, par
ticularly. My close friend, Ad
miral Raymond Spruance, and I
took tho stand that while tho Com
mittee might leave a good deal
to bo desired, that at tho present
time it was the only moans avail
able to tho FBI to definitely de
termine those who were using
subversive tactics to mislead par
ticularly the students in our
country.
Neither one of us thinks that
the Committee is a perfect setup,
but it is the best thing available,
and we both felt that until some
thing bettor i« devised that we
had better hang on to it and sup
port it.
Anyone who reads Karl Marx
knows that one of his basic doc
trines was to roach the youth in
countries that were to be taken
over and it was pretty evident, in
fact an established fact, that the
riots in San Francisco were the
result of definite leadership on
the part of well-known Commun
ists working on the University of
California student body.
A great deal of the weakness of
the Committee is flue to the fact
that the late Senator McCarthy
misused it unquestionably, but
nevertheless, Ihe basic fact re
mains that loyal Americans never
hesitate to swear to the fact or
to take loyalty oaths whenever
they are asked 10. Tho writer fools
that tho civil liberty issue is used
as a screen behind which Com
munist sympathizers hide when
they need a shield of any kind.
The foregoing was prompted by
the fact that Governor Williams

A week ago in Monterey there
was a forum conducted in refer
ence to the riots in San Francisco
when the House Committee on
Un-American Activities was hold
ing its session in Ihe City Hall.
The question which we learned
at the forum when we arrived
there was whether or not we
could retain our civil liberties and
still have internal security against

the inroads of communism, par
ticularly. My close friend, Ad
miral Raymond Spruance, and I
took tho stand that while tho Com
mittee might leave a good deal
to bo desired, that at tho present
time it was the only moans avail
able to tho FBI to definitely de
termine those who were using
subversive tactics to mislead par
ticularly the students in our
country.
Neither one of us thinks that
the Committee is a perfect setup,
but it is the best thing available,
and we both felt that until some
thing bettor i« devised that we
had better hang on to it and sup
port it.
Anyone who reads Karl Marx
knows that one of his basic doc
trines was to roach the youth in
countries that were to be taken
over and it was pretty evident, in
fact an established fact, that the
riots in San Francisco were the
result of definite leadership on
the part of well-known Commun
ists working on the University of
California student body.
A great deal of the weakness of
the Committee is flue to the fact
that the late Senator McCarthy
misused it unquestionably, but
nevertheless, Ihe basic fact re
mains that loyal Americans never
hesitate to swear to the fact or
to take loyalty oaths whenever
they are asked 10. Tho writer fools
that tho civil liberty issue is used
as a screen behind which Com
munist sympathizers hide when
they need a shield of any kind.
The foregoing was prompted by
the fact that Governor Williams
of Michigan made a speech, I be
lieve directly to the Stanford stu
dents, berating the deceased Sen
ator McCarthy, advocating the
reappeal of the Un-American Ac

tivities Committee, if I road his
quotations correctly, criticising
Nixon vigorously and advocating
the election of Senator Kennedy,
II is my privilege to know both
Nixon and Cabot Lodge person
ally. I cannot think of a bolter
trained or equipped toam to han
dlo our international problems
which, whether wo like it or not,
is principally the conduct of the
cold war with Russia.

Dear Kriitor:
In Monday's issue, the Daily en
dorsed Senator Kennedy. To take
such a step tho editors must have
disregarded many i m p or t ant
facts, if indeed thoyo wore not
ignorant of thom in the first
place.
You slate lhat "in the last eight
years Communism has strength
ened itself in the world, while
the United States has languished
in Ihe depths of vacillation." If
vacillation means ending tho
Korean War, preventing a war in
Lebanon, and being on tho win
ning side of every major U.N.
vote, thon lot's vacillate some
more.

One cannot possibly prefer the
Democratic record before Eisen
hower and Nixon, if you believe
that Communism has strength
ened itself lately, ask yourself
what ole Harry Truman was doing
while the Communists "strength
ened themselves" by swallowing
up Poland, Hungary, Albania,
C/echslovakia, Bulgaria, China,
North Kniva, Manchuria, etc. You
say the Democratic Party is ready
to meet the challenge. Unfor
tunately we already have seen
how they "meet the challenge."
"Senator Kennedy has sur
rounded himself with braintrusts
similar to those which gathered

around Roosevelt," you say. If
this is so to be desired ask your
self where the hraintrust was and
what good it did while Roosevelt
watched Hitler conquer Europe
and when Roosevelt sold Eastern
Europe out at Yalta, against the
advice of Churchill.
I can agree with only one of
your statements. "Senator Ken
nedy is a gamble." But can we
really afford to gamble while he
gets on-the-job training in Wash

years of experience, the confi

According to Dale Carnegie's
formula for winning friends and
influencing people, criticism is
much more effective if it is pre
ceded by a compliment. So duti
fully following his sage advice, I
will say that I do think "The Pen
insula's Only Morning News
paper" is indeed a fine one. How
ever . . .
I am far from being an ardent
supporter of Governor Williams
but I did object to the wording—
or rather a word—in the front
page article of September 29. This
presumably was a news story; yet
the instigator—with all it:, un
pleasant connotations—was used
to describe Governor Williams.
The literal meaning of the word
instigator, like the word propa
ganda, is quite respectable. Never
theless, according to my diction
ary, "instigate always implies re
sponsibility for initiating the ac
tion and usually connotes a bad
or evil purpose."
It is in a sense a compliment to

one word should impress me

A week ago in Monterey there
was a forum conducted in refer

when the House Committee on
Un-American Activities was hold
ing its session in Ihe City Hall.
The question which we learned
at the forum when we arrived
there was whether or not we
could retain our civil liberties and
still have internal security against

the inroads of communism, par
ticularly. My close friend, Ad
miral Raymond Spruance, and I
took tho stand that while tho Com
mittee might leave a good deal
to bo desired, that at tho present
time it was the only moans avail
able to tho FBI to definitely de
termine those who were using
subversive tactics to mislead par
ticularly the students in our
country.
Neither one of us thinks that
the Committee is a perfect setup,
but it is the best thing available,
and we both felt that until some
thing bettor i« devised that we
had better hang on to it and sup
port it.
Anyone who reads Karl Marx
knows that one of his basic doc
trines was to roach the youth in
countries that were to be taken
over and it was pretty evident, in
fact an established fact, that the
riots in San Francisco were the
result of definite leadership on
the part of well-known Commun
ists working on the University of
California student body.
A great deal of the weakness of
the Committee is flue to the fact
that the late Senator McCarthy
misused it unquestionably, but
nevertheless, Ihe basic fact re
mains that loyal Americans never
hesitate to swear to the fact or
to take loyalty oaths whenever
they are asked 10. Tho writer fools
that tho civil liberty issue is used
as a screen behind which Com
munist sympathizers hide when
they need a shield of any kind.
The foregoing was prompted by
the fact that Governor Williams
of Michigan made a speech, I be
lieve directly to the Stanford stu
dents, berating the deceased Sen
ator McCarthy, advocating the
reappeal of the Un-American Ac

tivities Committee, if I road his
quotations correctly, criticising
Nixon vigorously and advocating
the election of Senator Kennedy,
II is my privilege to know both
Nixon and Cabot Lodge person
ally. I cannot think of a bolter
trained or equipped toam to han
dlo our international problems
which, whether wo like it or not,
is principally the conduct of the
cold war with Russia.

Dear Kriitor:
In Monday's issue, the Daily en
dorsed Senator Kennedy. To take
such a step tho editors must have
disregarded many i m p or t ant
facts, if indeed thoyo wore not
ignorant of thom in the first
place.
You slate lhat "in the last eight
years Communism has strength
ened itself in the world, while
the United States has languished
in Ihe depths of vacillation." If
vacillation means ending tho
Korean War, preventing a war in
Lebanon, and being on tho win
ning side of every major U.N.
vote, thon lot's vacillate some
more.

One cannot possibly prefer the
Democratic record before Eisen
hower and Nixon, if you believe
that Communism has strength
ened itself lately, ask yourself
what ole Harry Truman was doing
while the Communists "strength
ened themselves" by swallowing
up Poland, Hungary, Albania,
C/echslovakia, Bulgaria, China,
North Kniva, Manchuria, etc. You
say the Democratic Party is ready
to meet the challenge. Unfor
tunately we already have seen
how they "meet the challenge."
"Senator Kennedy has sur
rounded himself with braintrusts
similar to those which gathered

around Roosevelt," you say. If
this is so to be desired ask your
self where the hraintrust was and
what good it did while Roosevelt
watched Hitler conquer Europe
and when Roosevelt sold Eastern
Europe out at Yalta, against the
advice of Churchill.
I can agree with only one of
your statements. "Senator Ken
nedy is a gamble." But can we
really afford to gamble while he
gets on-the-job training in Wash
ington? Nixon has over seven
years of experience, the confi
dence of Eisenhower, and i* any
thing but a gamble.

Dear Kriitor:
In Monday's issue, the Daily en
dorsed Senator Kennedy. To take
such a step tho editors must have
disregarded many i m p or t ant
facts, if indeed thoyo wore not
ignorant of thom in the first
place.
You slate lhat "in the last eight
years Communism has strength
ened itself in the world, while
the United States has languished
in Ihe depths of vacillation." If
vacillation means ending tho
Korean War, preventing a war in
Lebanon, and being on tho win
ning side of every major U.N.
vote, thon lot's vacillate some
more.

One cannot possibly prefer the
Democratic record before Eisen
hower and Nixon, if you believe
that Communism has strength
ened itself lately, ask yourself
what ole Harry Truman was doing
while the Communists "strength
ened themselves" by swallowing
up Poland, Hungary, Albania,
C/echslovakia, Bulgaria, China,
North Kniva, Manchuria, etc. You
say the Democratic Party is ready
to meet the challenge. Unfor
tunately we already have seen
how they "meet the challenge."
"Senator Kennedy has sur
rounded himself with braintrusts
similar to those which gathered

around Roosevelt," you say. If
this is so to be desired ask your
self where the hraintrust was and
what good it did while Roosevelt
watched Hitler conquer Europe
and when Roosevelt sold Eastern
Europe out at Yalta, against the
advice of Churchill.
I can agree with only one of
your statements. "Senator Ken
nedy is a gamble." But can we
really afford to gamble while he
gets on-the-job training in Wash
ington? Nixon has over seven
years of experience, the confi
dence of Eisenhower, and i* any
thing but a gamble.

Dear Editor:
A misquotation in Saturday's
Palo Alto Times may have caused
resentment and grievance among
Stanford students, in particular
freshmen.
Allow mo to present the cor
rect version of the relevant re
marks. In a letter addressed to
the local Board of Education I
followed some warnings about
the slowness of American school
education by:
"As newly appointed freshman
adviser at Stanford, 1 see the out
come of the American system and
can compare 17- 18-year-old uni
versity entrants on the two sides
of the Atlantic. Granted, your
boys have the maturity of south
ern rather than northern Euro
peans, but their English, Math
and other skills are one to two
years behind. Their knowledge as
it is lacks that assuredness which
only comes with early learning."
This was meant to indicate that
the maturity of the American stu
dent seems ABOVE average. The
newspaper version indicated the
contrary, to my dismay.

According to Dale Carnegie's
formula for winning friends and
influencing people, criticism is
much more effective if it is pre
ceded by a compliment. So duti
fully following his sage advice, I
will say that I do think "The Pen
insula's Only Morning News
paper" is indeed a fine one. How
ever . . .
I am far from being an ardent
supporter of Governor Williams
but I did object to the wording—
or rather a word—in the front
page article of September 29. This
presumably was a news story; yet
the instigator—with all it:, un
pleasant connotations—was used
to describe Governor Williams.
The literal meaning of the word
instigator, like the word propa
ganda, is quite respectable. Never
theless, according to my diction
ary, "instigate always implies re
sponsibility for initiating the ac
tion and usually connotes a bad
or evil purpose."
It is in a sense a compliment to
your responsible journalism that
one word should impress me
enough to write "a letter to the
editor."

Dear Editor:
A week ago in Monterey there
was a forum conducted in refer
ence to the riots in San Francisco
when the House Committee on
Un-American Activities was hold
ing its session in Ihe City Hall.
The question which we learned
at the forum when we arrived
there was whether or not we
could retain our civil liberties and
still have internal security against

the inroads of communism, par
ticularly. My close friend, Ad
miral Raymond Spruance, and I
took tho stand that while tho Com
mittee might leave a good deal
to bo desired, that at tho present
time it was the only moans avail
able to tho FBI to definitely de
termine those who were using
subversive tactics to mislead par
ticularly the students in our
country.
Neither one of us thinks that
the Committee is a perfect setup,
but it is the best thing available,
and we both felt that until some
thing bettor i« devised that we
had better hang on to it and sup
port it.
Anyone who reads Karl Marx
knows that one of his basic doc
trines was to roach the youth in
countries that were to be taken
over and it was pretty evident, in
fact an established fact, that the
riots in San Francisco were the
result of definite leadership on
the part of well-known Commun
ists working on the University of
California student body.
A great deal of the weakness of
the Committee is flue to the fact
that the late Senator McCarthy
misused it unquestionably, but
nevertheless, Ihe basic fact re
mains that loyal Americans never
hesitate to swear to the fact or
to take loyalty oaths whenever
they are asked 10. Tho writer fools
that tho civil liberty issue is used
as a screen behind which Com
munist sympathizers hide when
they need a shield of any kind.
The foregoing was prompted by
the fact that Governor Williams
of Michigan made a speech, I be
lieve directly to the Stanford stu
dents, berating the deceased Sen
ator McCarthy, advocating the
reappeal of the Un-American Ac

tivities Committee, if I road his
quotations correctly, criticising
Nixon vigorously and advocating
the election of Senator Kennedy,
II is my privilege to know both
Nixon and Cabot Lodge person
ally. I cannot think of a bolter
