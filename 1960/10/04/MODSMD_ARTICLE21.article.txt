A philosophy professor at the
University ol San Francisco has
.jumped into the statewide debate
on capital punishment with an
academic plea for the retention
of the death penalty in California.
Desmond J. Fitzgerald, an as
sistant professor of philosophic
basis, offers his arguments in the
current issue of "The San Fran
ciscan," a publication of the San
Francisco Junior Chamber of
Commerce.
Fitzgerald said that despite the
impassioned pleas of social scien
tists ami legal theorists, public
opinion polls show that the ma
jority of people questioned favor
retention of the death penalty.
This majority opinion, accord
ing to Fitzgerald, lias deep roots
in both philosophy and in human
nature.
Fitzgerald enumerated the
three classical theories of punish
ment—retributive, deterrent, and
reformative and of 112 e r e d the
thesis that the death penalty is
the most effective known retri
butive and deterrent factor.
He urged that the views of
police officers that capital pun
ishment is an effective deterrent
for the "thinking criminal"—be
upheld.
Said Fitzgerald, "The conscience
of society expects the death pen
alty for certain crimes which cry
for justice."
This fundamental notion is
rooted in equality, a concept so
basic that it can be seen in the

child's cry of "that isn't fair."
"To meaningfully speak of requir
ing someone to pay for his crime,"
■said Fitzgerald, is to employ retri
butive justice in the form of the
death penalty.
The professor, countering the
emotional, indignant voices of
those who would abolish the death
penalty, emphasized that the de
fense of capital punishment does
not mean a suppression of hu
manitarian feelings. Neither does
it carry with it the desire to in
crease the number of executions,
he said.
"There is no desire to return to
the calculated brutality of public
executions of former times," he
said, "but in our sympathy for the
wrongdoer "we must not forget
the victim."

The Daily Kansan reported last
week that apathy is widespread
in the University of Kansas stu
dent body concerning the forth
coming presidential election.
Some would xU>wy apathy, but
actually little else can be expected
because neither presidential can
didatc has offered a farm pro
gram over which the farmer can
become enthused. In the case of
the farm belt student, apathy rep
resents as effective a means of
political expression as fervent
support of one candidate or the
other, heralding perhaps a low
tur 11 -out of farm votes in
November.
