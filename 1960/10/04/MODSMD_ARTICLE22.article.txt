WASHINGTON (UPI)
Atomic Energy Chairman
John A. McCone surmised
yesterday that Russia is car
rying on underground nu
clear weapons tests and said
the United States should do
so if a control agreement is
not reached quickly.
McCone told a news confer
ence he was not prepared to
set a deadline for working
out a ban. But said he was
"gratified" by a statement by
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey,
D-Minn., that nuclear weap
ons tests should be resumed
if an agreement is not worked
out by mid-1961.
