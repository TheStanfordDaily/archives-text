rightwing youths shouting for a
"French Algeria" battled police
with iron bars and stones on ihe
Champs Elysee last night in Iho
bitterest Paris street lighting
since President Charles Do Gaulle

which lasted an hour and a half
in an area only a few blocks from

POLIC'E BLOCKED an attempt
by the mob to head for the presi
dential palace and the rightwing
demonstrators turned their fury
on the office of the loft wing

The riot broke out when youths
of the outlawed neo-fascist
"Young Nation" organization in
vaded an orderly demonstration
by 5,000 army veterans at the
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,

I under the Arch of Triumph at
the top end of Paris' famed bou
| levard.
! The veterans, representing six
associations, were protesting the
mounting "intellectual" campaign
against the Algerian war.
DOZENS OF demonstrators
were hustled off in police wagons
as Paris Police Chief Maurice Pa
pon himself directed the clean-up
action from a vantage point near
the "Rond-Point" the half-way
mark of the Champs Elysoes.
Just as soon as the mob was
cleared from the intersection,
battles erupted at other points
along the boulevard.
But gradually the rioters who
managed to escape police arrest
and handcuffing melted into side
streets and by 0 p.m. the Champs
Elysoes was calm again.
