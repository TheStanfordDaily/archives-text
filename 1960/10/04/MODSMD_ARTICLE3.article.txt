# Kennedy Seeks Illinois Support
## 
### 
Springfield, III. (UPD Sen.
John F. Kennedy crammed a day
| of campaigning yesterday along a
southern Illinois trail followed in
1948 by former President Harry
S. Truman, and confidently said
his reception convinced him lie
would win as Truman did 12
years ago.
The Democratic presidential
nominee, drawing big crowds in
j traditionally Republican areas as
'well as Democratic strongholds,
| climaxed his grueling aid-and-auto
grind at the state capital of
Springfield where many thou
sands turned out to cheer him.
"I'M NOT so sure Illinois is a
Republican state," Kennedy said
after a tumultuous ovation at the
armory here where more than
8,000 packed the inside and thou
sands of others were turned away
or waited outside.
Traveling through Illinois ter
ritory from which Abraham Lin-
I coin moved to the White House
| 100 years ago. Kennedy said the
ination again needs the great
j emancipator's brand of "deter
; mined leadership."
He said Vice President Richard
M. Nixon, his Republican rival,
wouldn't provide it if only be
cause he is a Republican.
ShAMMINO at Nixon for the
second consecutive day as "An
other Dewey," Kennedy said he
was complimented by Nixon's ref
erence to him as another "Tru
| man." He forecast he would do
I to Nixon in 19(50 what Truman
did to Dewey in 1918.
K e n n e d y said some people
j might wonder how a Democrat
could embrace Lincoln, the Re
publican patron saint. But he said
I Lincoln "belongs to the ages"
while "the Lincoln tradition is
not found" in a candidate obvi
ously referring to Nixon who
considers a $1.2."> minimum wage
and federal aid for teachers' sala
ries as "extreme."
The candidate accused the Re
publicans of trying to solve the
problems of depressed areas with
"a bargain basement approach."
In last night's address. Kennedy
said "the Nixon-Benson program,
based on a three-year moving av
erage of previous market prices,
can only drive farm income
down."
