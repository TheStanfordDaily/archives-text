Picking Football Winners, An Ecisy Art
Tho day is Wednesday, September 2<S, 19(><), and the place is South
Bend, Indiana. There is a pleasant excitement prevailing on the
Notre Dame campus for this coming Saturday the beloved, home
town football team plays host to Purdue.
Optimism is exceptionally high because the football picking ex
perts, or "bookies," have established the Irish of Notre Dame as
2 1 a-point favorites.
THE SCKNK now switches to Saturday, October 1, and underdog
Purdue has just crushed Notre Dame 51-19, scoring the most points
against an Irish football team in sixteen years.

What happened? Did the Notre
Dame linemen all break their
legs? What about these "pro
fessional" prognosticators?
THE ANSWER is really a sim
ple one which anyone who has
tried to pick football games will
readily tell you it's not as easy
as it looks.
The real proof is that if it were
so easy to pick football winners,
more people would be doing it
and making money in the process,
for while bookmaking is illegal in
the United States, tho practice
still goes on.
In addition to bookmaking,
Ihere are many legitimate de
vices that enable experts to prove
themselves or to become more
trust rated.
There are newspaper football
pools that give away all sorts of
prizes for correctly choosing Sat-

urelay's victors; there are innumerable personal hels throughout the
country each week; and there are millions of people who just try
lo guess the outcomes for fun.
The Business Of Bookmaking
BUT THE MAIN "action" as gamblers refer to it is conducted
through local bookmakers. This is a complex business with the usual
"bookie," or bet taker getting a cut of 10';. It has been said that
the only bookies who wind up making any money after all the scores
have been posted are those who took their 10 per cent and didn't
bet themselves.
Let's lake a look at other games of last weekend and see how these
"professional" pickers came out. They seem to have done pretty
well on their point spreads in some of the games they established
Rice as a three-point favorite over Tulane and Rice won 10-7. The
odds makers saw the Spartans of Michigan State as 6'2 points
better than Michigan and the score was 24-17 in favor of Michigan
State. Texas University was rated thirteen points better than Texas
Tech and Texas came through by a 17-0 count. Of course there were
many other games where the established favorite won by more than
ihe predicted point spread, but what about the upsets that make the
games so interesting to those millions of fans every Saturday after
noon?
A Typical Week Of Upsets
NORTHWESTERN, supposedly the sixth-best team in the coun
try, met lowa, supposedly the eighth-best team and the 4 1 a-point
favorite Wildcats were edged by lowa 42-0. It must be noted that
Northwestern played without the services of their top quarterback
Dick Thornton, who was out with a muscle injury in his leg, but
this shouldn't have caused a mistaken 46'--point spread by the
experts.
The list goes on: Florida, a fi'a-point underdog to highly touted
Georgia Tech scored a thrilling 18-17 upset. Tennessee figured by
the experts as two touchdowns better than Mississippi State had to
fight for its life to get out with a 0-0 tie.
By this time the experts, amateur and "professional" must be
feeling those pains again. Dartmouth, a 6'a-point second choice in
ihe Ivy League game of the day with Pennsylvania, shut out last
year's conference chanmp 15-0. Penn State was given a three-point
edge over Missouri, but they forgot to win; the score was 21-8. And
finally in a game that shook the entire state of Washington, the
beloved Huskies, last year's Rose Bowl Champions by trampling
Wisconsin of the powerful Big Ten 44-8, were toppled by a plucky
Navy team 15-14. This Washington team, last year's starting unit
complete to the man, was an 11-point favorite, but a football takes
strange bounces.
LAST SATURDAY'S games were typical of the hard-fought
brand of competition seen in collegiate football. The rest was there
too cheerleaders, fans ate peanuts, and millions of "experts" tried
their luck at picking winners. How well dirl you do?
