# Brash Pirates Calm Before Series Start
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH (UPI) â€” Bat
tling Danny Murtaugh and his
un d e r d o g Pittsburgh Pirates
threw down the gauntlet to the
mighty New York Yankees last,
night by labeling the start of the
World Series tomorrow as "just
another opening game."
"So they're favored," grunted
the tobacco-chewing Murtaugh as
he quietly watched his National
League champions go through a

batting drill. "Well, we weren't
favored all year."
The Pirates were calm and re
laxed and, like .starter Vernon
(Deacon) Law, the tall right
hander who will open for them
Wednesday, showed no evidence
of tension.
And even the Yankees admitted
that the Pirates' 20-game winner
might have an edge on their sur
prise starter, right-hander Art
Ditmar, a 10-game winner.
