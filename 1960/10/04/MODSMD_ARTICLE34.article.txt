Wicket distance between
pitcher and batter
Yorker— a ball which passes
the bat before bouncing
Duck no score
Kiiu out put out
Keeper —catcher
Declared state score is com
pleted before all baiters are
out
All out- all batsmen dis
missed
Stanford Cricket Club, although
markedly inferior in batting and
bowling, showed great potential
in giving Cal C.C. her first vic
tory of the season.
To offset their tendency to
pitch short Cal shortened the
wicket a yard.
BIRCH ELEC TED to bat and
a flurry of red beard and energy

erupted momentarily as A. D.
Milton's yorker got the opener
for a duck. G. G. Ball beguiled
batsman Smith by emerging from
ihc smoke-screen of his pipe to
run out the unsuspecting Caiman
for 38. J. A. Harrop, newly ar
rived, bowled as much against
keeper J. O. Neill's cowboy hat
as against the Cal batsmen, yet
had Birch for 7. Meantime Cal
C.C. had scored 12-1, and so de
clared.
Opening for Stanford C.C., D.
F. Lomax smote lustily to edge
extras for high score before fall
ing to a mystical hall from a tur
baned Shik: more earthy stuff
disposed of the other Stanford
batsmen, each of whom contrib
uted, if mildly, and Stanford were
all out for 69.
