They walked out when Hungary's
Janos Kadar stood up to speak.
A good half of the delegates to
the United Nations General As
sembly rose from their seats and
left the big hall. The Communist
nations, of course, stood fast.
Perhaps it was the sense of
anti-climax.
\NVTI!I.\(i would have been
i second-rate after Dag Hammar
skjold's ringing defiance of Nikita
! Khrushchev without question
I the most dramatic moment the
Assembly has seen this two
weeks.
Delegates were on their feet
| applauding and stomping for the
Secretary-General, with even the
"Neutralist" nations of India.
Ghana and Egypt caught up in
the swell of appreci itjpn for the
Swedish head of ih£ Secretariat.
Hammarskjold said he would
not quit. And the double-fisted
j table-pounding of Khrushchev
, though done with a grin seemed j
almost universally to strike the
assembly as petulance.
THEN IT WAS the turn for
' Kadar, the Hungarian who pre
tended to ask for a truce in the
19."56 Hungarian revolt and there- i
by gave Soviet tanks time to
move into Budapest.
As Kadar began, there was a
long line of people trying to get
out of the hall. The Latin Ameri
can delegation seats were virtu
ally empty and only one or two
second-stringers held their posts
in the neutralist nations.
"HUNGARY IS AN outworn
question, settled by history and
belonging to the past," Kadar i
said.
There were few who would
agree. The United States will see
to it that the question is fully
explored at this session.
"Our people are indebted to tho
Soviet army for their reconquered
national independence and their
present peaceful and secure life,"
he said.
"The Hungarian people get on
well with these Soviet troops."

yawned openly in their seats. A
number flitted around the hall
shaking hands and renewing old
acquaintances.
When Kadar had finished, there
was a momentary smattering of
applause. He returned to his seat
with the same emotionless ex
! pression he had worn along. He
had said his piece.


POUNDING FlSTS—Premier Nikita Khrushchev called
uponSecretary-Ceneral Dag Hammarskjold today to "mus
ter enough courage" to resign from his U.N. post. When
Hammarskjold flatly rejected Nikita"? demand, Khrush
chev and his Communist followers set off a bedlam of
double-fisted table-pounding.
