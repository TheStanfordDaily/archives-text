# Dramatic Talk Gains Applause
## 
### 
United Nations, N.Y.—(UPI)-
Secretary-General Dag Hammar
skjold, in one of the most dra
matic- moments of United Nations
history, yesterday defied Nikita S.
Khrushchev's demand for his res
ignation.
"I shall remain at my post,"
he told the General Assembly as
delegates leaped to their feet with
a thunderous ovation.
HAMMARSKJOLD won the
greatest applause given any
speaker yet in this crisis-filled
15th session of the world parlia
ment.
Khrushchev, who only this
morning had called on Hammar
skjold "To muster up enough
courage to resign," pounded his
desk in a drumbeat of disapproval
that echoed under the rolling
applause.
Hammarskjold's dram a t i c
statement came only a few hours
after Khrushchev had taken a di
rect slap from Indian Premier
Jawaharlal Nehru who threw his
full support behind the U.N. ac
tion in the Congo—thus support
ing Hammarskjold and said that
foreign intervention in the Afri
can country could only "lead to
conflict."
DESPITE PRESIDENT Eisen
hower's rejection of a neutralist
call for a meeting between him
and Khrushchev, Neht u asked the
Assembly to endorse unanimously
a resolution containing the pro
posal. Assembly President Fred
crick H. Boland announced that
the measure would be taken up
at the end of today's session.
Hammarskjold was given the
stand at the start of this after
noon's meeting to reply to
Khrushchev's resignation demand.
The Russian wanted Hammar
skjold's post abolished and re
placed by a three-member presi
dium, each of whom would have
; a veto over U.N. action.
Khrushchev's plan for his re
placement, Hammarskjold said,
j "would make it impossible to
maintain an effective executive"
at the top of the U.N. secretariat.
"in' RESIGNING, I would,
i therefore, at the present difficult
I and dangerous juncture throw the
organization to the winds," he
I said.
"... It is not the Soviet Union
I or, indeed, any other big powers
i who need the United Nations for
j their protection; it is all the
I others. In this sense, the organi
zation is first of all their Organ
ization, and 1 deeply believe in
the wisdom with which they will
! be able to use and guide it."
