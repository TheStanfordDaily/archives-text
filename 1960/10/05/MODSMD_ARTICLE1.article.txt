sion.
"He tells us that foreign policy
is the most important issue in the
campaign," Bowles said, "but
then he says we can't talk about
it while Mr. Khrushchev is
here. . . ."
"I THINK it would bo granting
him too much power," Bowles
added.
In his position as Kennedy's
In aintrust expert on foreign pol

litical observers as a likely choice

for Secretary of State should the
Kennedy-Johnson team be elected
in November.
