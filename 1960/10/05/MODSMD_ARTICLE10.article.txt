## U.S. Fires Military Satellite

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
(UPI) â€” The United States yes
terday orbited a 500-pound mili
tary communications system
which promptly received and re
layed a message from President
Eisenhower to Secretary of State
Christian A. Herter.
The launching from the Cape
Canaveral space center was the
nation's 28th and most complex
space success since Russia orbit
ed its first Sputnik exactly three
years ago.
U.S. scientists and military offi
cials said the successful orbiting
of the "Courier" satellite, which
can receive and record high speed
radio-teletype and voice messages
from one station and relay them
to another, represented the first
step in a plan to provide free
world military forces with an
instantaneous and unjammable
communications system.
TRANSMISSION of the mes
j sage from Eisenhower to Herter
j between U.S. Army ground sta
j tions at Fort Monmouth, N.J., and
I Salinas. Puerto Rico, via the satel
| lite, was announced in Washing
; ton by Richard S. Morse, director
!of Army research and develop
ment.
The message was flashed to the
satellite at the rate of 68.000
words a minute as the 51-inch
sphere shot above the horizon on
its first pass around the earth.
From Puerto Rico, it was relayed
by radio to Herter at the United
Nations in New York.
Contents of the message were
not disclosed immediately.
Morse, who called the satellite's
performance "excellent," said a
message from Army Secretary
Wilbur Brucker, which had been
carried aloft by the radio satel
lite, also was beamed back suc
cessfully.
BRUCKKR'S message hailed
the new satellite communications
system as "another important
step in the area of space com
munications that will contribute
immeasurably to modern military
needs as well as to the general
improvement of communications."
Jubilant officials announced the
orbit had been attained two hours
after an 80-foot Thor-Able Star
rocket carried the ball-shaped orb
off its launching pad in a burst
of orange flame at 10:45 a.m.
PST.
