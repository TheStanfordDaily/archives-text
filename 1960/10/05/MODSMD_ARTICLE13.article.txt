# Specious Statements

### 
Our endorsement of Senator Kennedy lias led to a strong re
action on campus, some of it favorable, most of it unfavorable.
Stanford has been and still is a predominantly Republican
campus so we are not at all surprised that most of the reaction
has been that of opposition to the Kennedy endorsement.
However, one aspect of the reaction is very difficult to under
stand and deserves analysis. Apparently a few narrow-minded
individuals consider an endorsement of Kennedy tantamount to
an endorsement of the Socialist Party.
As far as we know, Kennedy is a candidate of the Democratic
Party which does represent this election year a more active govern
ment playing a larger role in domestic and foreign affairs.
This could he construed as a Socialist tendency but should not
he confused with the removal of individual rights. The Demo
cratic Party is just as "American" as the Republican Party and
is not a usurper of the Constitution.
Kennedy and his party feel that a stronger and more outspoken
federal government is the panacea for our ills. We tend to agree
and that is one of the reasons for our endorsement. Hut we resent
the accusation that we represent the extreme Left simply because
we like the Democratic Party.
Such unfounded, unjustified and specious statements reveal
a lack of serious concern for the approaching election. Senator
Goldwater and his following are doing the nation a grave injustice
by referring to the Democrats as Socialists. Name-calling has never
accomplished anything in the past nor will it accomplish anything
in the future.
