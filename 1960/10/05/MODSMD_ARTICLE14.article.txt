## The 						Defectors 
### 
The recent defection to Russia
of two employes of the National
Security Agency has caused quite
an uproar in many official Wash
ington circles, and numerous de
mands have been heard for a
tightening of security checks in
"sensitive agencies."
It i.s difficult to fathom the rea
sons for the action of William H.
Martin and Bernon F. Mitchell,
who incidently is a Stanford grad
uate; but their defection is cer
tainly no cause for panic or for
wholesale dismissal of govern
ment employes, as some Congress
men have advocated. Instead a
careful look should be taken at
possible motives for their action
and at the effect upon govern
ment agencies if a strict security
crackdown should result.
The Defense Department has
stated that one of the men,
Mitchell, was "mentally sick" and
had been undergoing psychiatric
treatment. Although this may
have been a factor in his decision,
the actions of both these men may
be better attributed to naivete.
In a statement released from
Moscow, they accused the United
States of intelligence practices
which "mislead public opinion"
and which are "dangerous to
world peace." They also said that
the United States government
suppresses information, curtails
freedom of expression, harrasses
people with unpopular political
beliefs, and in general does not
respect civil liberties and individ
ual rights
It is possible that they were
motivated by money or other in
ducements and did not believe
their statement, but the non
political background of the two
men and the advantage of a free
system seem to support the theory
of naivete.
By implication and by their
presence in Russia, they appeared
to believe that the Soviet Union is
not guilty of such practices for
which they condemned the U.S.
and, to the contrary, is a sanctu
ary of human freedoms. One has
only to look at Hungary, at Korea,
at the millions of defectors who
have come to the West (200.000
or more a year into West Ger
many alone) and at the author
itarian government of Russia to
realize how naive Mitchell and
Martin's statement was.
Their arguments will convince
no one that freedom really exists
in the Soviet Union. And even the
many people in this country who
disapprove, and with some justi
fication, of the U-2 ami similar
U.S. intelligence methods do not
believe that Russia abstains from
even worse practices.
In contrast to the millions of
people who have fled from the
East, there have been only nine
defectors from the West in the
past year. There are, however,
many loyal citizens of the United
States employed by the govern
ment who would be in danger of
losing their jobs and ruining their
lives if the reaction against Mar-

tin and Mitchell is allowed to take
form. And even more harmful to
the country than this injustice
would be the loss of many quali
fied people who would shun gov
ernment service because of "witch
hunts."
Fran c is Walter (D-Penn.),
chairman of the House Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee, has
jumped in feet first as usual and
has demanded a thorough investi
gation of all intelligence agencies.
He has requested that President
Eisenhower release the names of
one thousand government em
ployes who had been fired as se
curity risks and rehired after a
1956 SupremeCourt ruling against
their dismissal.
His intent, undoubtedly, is to
persecute these people, but the
President has wisely refused to
divulge the names. However, even
Eisenhower has advocated, per
haps less wisely, a review of the
national security system.
There is, obviously, no screen
ing system which is perfect. No
FBI agent can determine the
thoughts which pass through the
minds of an employe of the NSA
nor can a man's past record ac
curately reveal his future inten
tions.
The answer is, then, not an ex
haustive effort to find minute and
often wrongly interpreted evi
dence for the dismissal and ruina
tion of government employes.
Although a security check is nec
essary in sensitive jobs to protect
against Communists in high posi
tions, a much greater amount of
time and effort should be devoted
to assuring that the United States
does not become the type of coun
try which Martin and Mitchell
wrongly claim it is today.
We must constantly be alert
that a man does not lose his job
and become an outcast merely be
cause he expresses displeasure
with a government policy or be
cause he favors disarmament, in
tegration. atheism, or other be
liefs which may happen to be un
popular with some officials in
high places. There are a few peo
ple, numbering among them
groups such as the House Un-
American Activities Committee,
the Daughters of the American
Revolution, the American Legion,
and other "American" organiza
tions which would advocate the
use of any means necessary to de
feat Russia in the cold war, even
suppression of constitutional free
doms and civil rights. However,
such an America would justify
Mitchell and Martin's flight and
the flight of future defectors.
The way for this country to re
main strong and to prove con
stantly the falsity of the two de
fectors' claims is not to adopt the
methods of McCarthy ami Walters
hut to safeguard and foster free
expression of thought and free
dom of political beliefs. If this is
done, there will he fÂ»>w Mitchells
and Martins and certainly no
need for the panic and demands of
a few Washington politicians.

The recent defection to Russia
of two employes of the National
Security Agency has caused quite
an uproar in many official Wash
ington circles, and numerous de
mands have been heard for a
tightening of security checks in
"sensitive agencies."
It i.s difficult to fathom the rea
sons for the action of William H.
Martin and Bernon F. Mitchell,
who incidently is a Stanford grad
uate; but their defection is cer
tainly no cause for panic or for
wholesale dismissal of govern
ment employes, as some Congress
men have advocated. Instead a
careful look should be taken at
possible motives for their action
and at the effect upon govern
ment agencies if a strict security
crackdown should result.
The Defense Department has
stated that one of the men,
Mitchell, was "mentally sick" and
had been undergoing psychiatric
treatment. Although this may
have been a factor in his decision,
the actions of both these men may
be better attributed to naivete.
In a statement released from
Moscow, they accused the United
States of intelligence practices
which "mislead public opinion"
and which are "dangerous to
world peace." They also said that
the United States government
suppresses information, curtails
freedom of expression, harrasses
people with unpopular political
beliefs, and in general does not
respect civil liberties and individ
ual rights
It is possible that they were
motivated by money or other in
ducements and did not believe
their statement, but the non
political background of the two
men and the advantage of a free
system seem to support the theory
of naivete.
By implication and by their
presence in Russia, they appeared
to believe that the Soviet Union is
not guilty of such practices for
which they condemned the U.S.
and, to the contrary, is a sanctu
ary of human freedoms. One has
only to look at Hungary, at Korea,
at the millions of defectors who
have come to the West (200.000
or more a year into West Ger
many alone) and at the author
itarian government of Russia to
realize how naive Mitchell and
Martin's statement was.
Their arguments will convince
no one that freedom really exists
in the Soviet Union. And even the
many people in this country who
disapprove, and with some justi
fication, of the U-2 ami similar
U.S. intelligence methods do not
believe that Russia abstains from
even worse practices.
In contrast to the millions of
people who have fled from the
East, there have been only nine
defectors from the West in the
past year. There are, however,
many loyal citizens of the United
States employed by the govern
ment who would be in danger of
losing their jobs and ruining their
lives if the reaction against Mar-

tin and Mitchell is allowed to take
form. And even more harmful to
the country than this injustice
would be the loss of many quali
fied people who would shun gov
ernment service because of "witch
hunts."
Fran c is Walter (D-Penn.),
chairman of the House Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee, has
jumped in feet first as usual and
has demanded a thorough investi
gation of all intelligence agencies.
He has requested that President
Eisenhower release the names of
one thousand government em
ployes who had been fired as se
curity risks and rehired after a
1956 SupremeCourt ruling against
their dismissal.
His intent, undoubtedly, is to
persecute these people, but the
President has wisely refused to
divulge the names. However, even

system seem to support the theory
of naivete.
By implication and by their
presence in Russia, they appeared
to believe that the Soviet Union is
not guilty of such practices for
which they condemned the U.S.
and, to the contrary, is a sanctu
ary of human freedoms. One has
only to look at Hungary, at Korea,
at the millions of defectors who
have come to the West (200.000
or more a year into West Ger
many alone) and at the author
itarian government of Russia to
realize how naive Mitchell and
Martin's statement was.
Their arguments will convince
no one that freedom really exists
in the Soviet Union. And even the
many people in this country who
disapprove, and with some justi
fication, of the U-2 ami similar
U.S. intelligence methods do not
believe that Russia abstains from
even worse practices.
In contrast to the millions of
people who have fled from the
East, there have been only nine
defectors from the West in the
past year. There are, however,
many loyal citizens of the United
States employed by the govern
ment who would be in danger of
losing their jobs and ruining their
lives if the reaction against Mar-

tin and Mitchell is allowed to take
form. And even more harmful to
the country than this injustice
would be the loss of many quali
fied people who would shun gov
ernment service because of "witch
hunts."
Fran c is Walter (D-Penn.),
chairman of the House Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee, has
jumped in feet first as usual and
has demanded a thorough investi
gation of all intelligence agencies.
He has requested that President
Eisenhower release the names of
one thousand government em
ployes who had been fired as se
curity risks and rehired after a
1956 SupremeCourt ruling against
their dismissal.
His intent, undoubtedly, is to
persecute these people, but the
President has wisely refused to
divulge the names. However, even
Eisenhower has advocated, per
haps less wisely, a review of the
national security system.
There is, obviously, no screen
ing system which is perfect. No
FBI agent can determine the
thoughts which pass through the
minds of an employe of the NSA
nor can a man's past record ac
curately reveal his future inten
tions.
The answer is, then, not an ex
haustive effort to find minute and
often wrongly interpreted evi
dence for the dismissal and ruina
tion of government employes.
Although a security check is nec
essary in sensitive jobs to protect
against Communists in high posi
tions, a much greater amount of
time and effort should be devoted
to assuring that the United States
does not become the type of coun
try which Martin and Mitchell
wrongly claim it is today.
We must constantly be alert
that a man does not lose his job
and become an outcast merely be
cause he expresses displeasure
with a government policy or be
cause he favors disarmament, in
tegration. atheism, or other be
liefs which may happen to be un
popular with some officials in
high places. There are a few peo

groups such as the House Un-
American Activities Committee,
the Daughters of the American
Revolution, the American Legion,
and other "American" organiza
tions which would advocate the
use of any means necessary to de
feat Russia in the cold war, even
suppression of constitutional free
doms and civil rights. However,
such an America would justify
Mitchell and Martin's flight and
the flight of future defectors.
The way for this country to re

The recent defection to Russia
of two employes of the National
Security Agency has caused quite
an uproar in many official Wash
ington circles, and numerous de
mands have been heard for a
tightening of security checks in
"sensitive agencies."
It i.s difficult to fathom the rea
sons for the action of William H.
Martin and Bernon F. Mitchell,
who incidently is a Stanford grad
uate; but their defection is cer
tainly no cause for panic or for
wholesale dismissal of govern
ment employes, as some Congress
men have advocated. Instead a
careful look should be taken at
possible motives for their action
and at the effect upon govern
ment agencies if a strict security
crackdown should result.
The Defense Department has
stated that one of the men,
Mitchell, was "mentally sick" and
had been undergoing psychiatric
treatment. Although this may
have been a factor in his decision,
the actions of both these men may
be better attributed to naivete.
In a statement released from
Moscow, they accused the United
States of intelligence practices
which "mislead public opinion"
and which are "dangerous to
world peace." They also said that
the United States government
suppresses information, curtails
freedom of expression, harrasses
people with unpopular political
beliefs, and in general does not
respect civil liberties and individ
ual rights

motivated by money or other in
ducements and did not believe
their statement, but the non

The recent defection to Russia
of two employes of the National
Security Agency has caused quite
an uproar in many official Wash
ington circles, and numerous de
mands have been heard for a
tightening of security checks in
"sensitive agencies."
It i.s difficult to fathom the rea
sons for the action of William H.
Martin and Bernon F. Mitchell,
who incidently is a Stanford grad
uate; but their defection is cer
tainly no cause for panic or for
wholesale dismissal of govern
ment employes, as some Congress
men have advocated. Instead a
careful look should be taken at
possible motives for their action
and at the effect upon govern
ment agencies if a strict security
crackdown should result.
The Defense Department has
stated that one of the men,
Mitchell, was "mentally sick" and
had been undergoing psychiatric
treatment. Although this may
have been a factor in his decision,
the actions of both these men may
be better attributed to naivete.
In a statement released from
Moscow, they accused the United
States of intelligence practices
which "mislead public opinion"
and which are "dangerous to
world peace." They also said that
the United States government
suppresses information, curtails
freedom of expression, harrasses
people with unpopular political
beliefs, and in general does not
respect civil liberties and individ
ual rights
It is possible that they were
motivated by money or other in
ducements and did not believe
their statement, but the non
political background of the two
men and the advantage of a free
system seem to support the theory
of naivete.
By implication and by their
presence in Russia, they appeared
to believe that the Soviet Union is
not guilty of such practices for
which they condemned the U.S.
and, to the contrary, is a sanctu
ary of human freedoms. One has
only to look at Hungary, at Korea,
at the millions of defectors who
have come to the West (200.000
or more a year into West Ger
many alone) and at the author
itarian government of Russia to
realize how naive Mitchell and
Martin's statement was.
Their arguments will convince
no one that freedom really exists
in the Soviet Union. And even the
many people in this country who
disapprove, and with some justi
fication, of the U-2 ami similar
U.S. intelligence methods do not
believe that Russia abstains from
even worse practices.
In contrast to the millions of
people who have fled from the
East, there have been only nine
defectors from the West in the
past year. There are, however,
many loyal citizens of the United
States employed by the govern
ment who would be in danger of
losing their jobs and ruining their
lives if the reaction against Mar-

tin and Mitchell is allowed to take
form. And even more harmful to
the country than this injustice
would be the loss of many quali
fied people who would shun gov
ernment service because of "witch
hunts."
Fran c is Walter (D-Penn.),
chairman of the House Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee, has
jumped in feet first as usual and
has demanded a thorough investi
gation of all intelligence agencies.
He has requested that President
Eisenhower release the names of
one thousand government em
ployes who had been fired as se
curity risks and rehired after a
1956 SupremeCourt ruling against
their dismissal.
His intent, undoubtedly, is to
persecute these people, but the
President has wisely refused to
divulge the names. However, even
Eisenhower has advocated, per
haps less wisely, a review of the
national security system.
There is, obviously, no screen
ing system which is perfect. No
FBI agent can determine the
thoughts which pass through the
minds of an employe of the NSA
nor can a man's past record ac
curately reveal his future inten
tions.
The answer is, then, not an ex
haustive effort to find minute and
often wrongly interpreted evi
dence for the dismissal and ruina
tion of government employes.
Although a security check is nec
essary in sensitive jobs to protect
against Communists in high posi
tions, a much greater amount of
time and effort should be devoted
to assuring that the United States
does not become the type of coun
try which Martin and Mitchell
wrongly claim it is today.
We must constantly be alert
that a man does not lose his job
and become an outcast merely be
cause he expresses displeasure
with a government policy or be
cause he favors disarmament, in
tegration. atheism, or other be
liefs which may happen to be un
popular with some officials in
high places. There are a few peo
ple, numbering among them
groups such as the House Un-
American Activities Committee,
the Daughters of the American
Revolution, the American Legion,
and other "American" organiza
tions which would advocate the
use of any means necessary to de
feat Russia in the cold war, even
suppression of constitutional free
doms and civil rights. However,
such an America would justify
Mitchell and Martin's flight and
the flight of future defectors.
The way for this country to re
main strong and to prove con
stantly the falsity of the two de
fectors' claims is not to adopt the
methods of McCarthy ami Walters
hut to safeguard and foster free
expression of thought and free
dom of political beliefs. If this is
done, there will he fÂ»>w Mitchells
and Martins and certainly no
need for the panic and demands of
a few Washington politicians.
