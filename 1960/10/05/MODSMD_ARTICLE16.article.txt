Editor, flip Daily:
In a letter to the Daily on Oe
tober 4, Mr. S. F. B. Morse de
clared that "the basic fart re
mains that loyal Americans never
hesitate to swear to the fact or
to take loyalty oaths whenever
they are asked to."
A logical problem is raised:
Does Mr. Morse have a criterion
for "loyal American" outside the
scope of this sentence, or is the
taking of loyalty oaths to be ac
cepted as the definition of a loyal
American? In the former case Mr.
Morse is asserting an empirical
constant conjunction between
non-swearing and non-loyalty.
If he will set up standards for
loyalty which do not include
oaths, he will admit at least the
logical possibility of there being
people who meet this standard,
yet do not "swear . . . whenever
asked." If I show him people who
meet these standards, but refuse
to take oaths, I will have shown
his statement (under the first in
terpretation) 1o be false. Indeed,
it would make his statement slan
derous of those who pass his other
test.
Under the second interpreta
tion, the Trustees of Harvard,
Yale, Oberlin, etc., will be defined
unloyal because of their rejection
of Federal loan funds with the
oath clause. Will Mr. Morse, who
knows nothing about me, label
me "unloyal" because I refused
to sign the oath required for a
Federal scholarship? Mr. Morse's
problem is acute: either he will
have to show that I do not meet
his other standards. If he is not
defining my loyally, and if I

meet his other standards, I have
been slandered.
But. this situation is not un
usual. In fact, his letter was the
perfect example of the workings
of the House Un-American Activ
ities Committee which he defends.
The Committee places people in
the position where they may bo
defined unloyal, beyond any usual
meaning of the word, or imputed
unloyal by an organization which
cannot be sued for its slanderous,
even libelous statements. It is
this fundamental structure of
the Commit lee which raises so
much antagonism, not abuse of
its powers.
Stephen Miehelson
Editor, the Daily:
With so much talk of positive
action, it is encouraging to see a
student organization act posi
tively. Your recent editorial en
dorsing the Democratic candidate
represents the commitment of
mind and spirit which undergrad
uates as well as allegedly mature
adults too often avoid. Therefore,
more power to you.
Your example, regardless of its
political bias, with which many
may correctly disagree, is hope
fully the first of many occasions
this year where students assume
the responsibility of living up to
what Ihey profess. By arguing co
herently, consistently and forth
rightly in favor of an intelligent
viewpoint, Ihe Daily can assist not
only those who agree with it. but
it can also give incentive to those
opposed to its editorial position.
I trust that those who disagree

with the Daily will speak out as
articulately as Iho Daily editor
and will receive fair space on the
paper's pages.

In a letter to the Daily on Oe
tober 4, Mr. S. F. B. Morse de
clared that "the basic fart re
mains that loyal Americans never
hesitate to swear to the fact or
to take loyalty oaths whenever
they are asked to."
A logical problem is raised:
Does Mr. Morse have a criterion
for "loyal American" outside the
scope of this sentence, or is the
taking of loyalty oaths to be ac
cepted as the definition of a loyal
American? In the former case Mr.
Morse is asserting an empirical
constant conjunction between
non-swearing and non-loyalty.
If he will set up standards for
loyalty which do not include
oaths, he will admit at least the
logical possibility of there being
people who meet this standard,
yet do not "swear . . . whenever
asked." If I show him people who
meet these standards, but refuse
to take oaths, I will have shown
his statement (under the first in
terpretation) 1o be false. Indeed,
it would make his statement slan
derous of those who pass his other
test.
Under the second interpreta
tion, the Trustees of Harvard,
Yale, Oberlin, etc., will be defined
unloyal because of their rejection
of Federal loan funds with the
oath clause. Will Mr. Morse, who
knows nothing about me, label
me "unloyal" because I refused
to sign the oath required for a
Federal scholarship? Mr. Morse's
problem is acute: either he will
have to show that I do not meet
his other standards. If he is not
defining my loyally, and if I

meet his other standards, I have
been slandered.
But. this situation is not un
usual. In fact, his letter was the
perfect example of the workings
of the House Un-American Activ
ities Committee which he defends.
The Committee places people in
the position where they may bo
defined unloyal, beyond any usual
meaning of the word, or imputed
unloyal by an organization which
cannot be sued for its slanderous,
even libelous statements. It is
this fundamental structure of
the Commit lee which raises so
much antagonism, not abuse of
its powers.
Stephen Miehelson
Editor, the Daily:
With so much talk of positive
action, it is encouraging to see a
student organization act posi
tively. Your recent editorial en
dorsing the Democratic candidate
represents the commitment of
mind and spirit which undergrad
uates as well as allegedly mature
adults too often avoid. Therefore,
more power to you.
Your example, regardless of its
political bias, with which many
may correctly disagree, is hope
fully the first of many occasions
this year where students assume
the responsibility of living up to
what Ihey profess. By arguing co
herently, consistently and forth
rightly in favor of an intelligent
viewpoint, Ihe Daily can assist not
only those who agree with it. but
it can also give incentive to those
opposed to its editorial position.
