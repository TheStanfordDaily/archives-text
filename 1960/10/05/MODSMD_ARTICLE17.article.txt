### 
Letters to the Editor should not
exceed 2.10 words. Name, address
and phone number should he in
cluded. Typewritten letters have
a better chance of appearing. Let
ters shall be printed without
change except in the case of po
tentially libelous material. The
fact that any letters hold an op
posite viewpoint from Ihe Edi
torial Board will not matter.
