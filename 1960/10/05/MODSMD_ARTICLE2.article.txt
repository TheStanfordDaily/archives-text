# Nikita, Macmillan Hold 'Useful' Talk
## Disarmament Is Main Topic 
### 
NEW YORK iUPI» British
Prime Minister Harold Macmillan
and Soviet Premier Nikita Khru
shchev talked yesterday for an
hour and a half in a meeting a
British spokesman said had made
a start toward restoring good re
lations between East and West.
Khrushchev agreed that the meet
ing was "very productive."
They discussed the possibility
of a Big Four summit conference
in the spring after the American
Presidential elections—but de
voted most of their "long and use
ful discussion" to disarmament
which both sides contend is the
key to world peace.
It was the second New York
meeting betwen Khrushchev and
Macmillan and their last Mac
millan flies home to London to
night. Their first meeting last
week ended in complete stalemate
but spokesmen on both sides indi
cated progress had been made
yesterday.
NEWSMEN pointed out to the
British spokesman that no agree
ment had been announced on any
subject and asked why Macmillan
thought the meeting was any
thing more than an "utter fail
ure."
"We feel we have kept things in
play," the spokesman said.
Khrushchev's statement to re
porters in front of the Soviet
headquarters after the meeting
was the most optimistic he has
made since he came to New York
and ran into a series of diplo
matic defeats.
Macmillan saw Khrushchev last
week and then flew to Washing
ton for talks Sunday morning
with President Eisenhower. A
spokesman denied yesterday he
was acting as any sort of go be
tween in a direct meeting be
tween Khrushchev and Eisen
hower as demanded by five neu
tralist nations at the United
Nations.
SINCE Macmillan had visited
Khrushchev for their last meet
ing. the Soviet leader did the call
ing today, arriving two minutes
early at the Waldorf for the con
ference in Macmillan's 23rd flood
suite. Their encounter was so
friendly that Khrushchev invited
Macmillan to visit his hunting
lodge some time.
Their parting was even more
cordial. Macmillan took the ele
vator to the street with Khru
shchev and they smiled their way
across the sidewalk to a last
minute flurry of handshakes be
fore Macmillan escorted the Rus
sian into his waiting limousine.
The farewells were in sharp
contrast to the parting last Thurs
day when Khrushchev did not
escort Macmillan to the curb as
he usually does with visiting dig
nitaries.

A Productive Conference
