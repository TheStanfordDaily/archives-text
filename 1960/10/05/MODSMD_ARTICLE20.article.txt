# THREE BYWORDS
## Nixon Depicted as Wise, Mature; Excellent Judge 
### MICHAEL TOBRINER IIR Political Analyst 
Three words saturate current
Republican rhetoric. The words
are wisdom, maturity, and judg
ment. GOP orators daily allege
that the qualities these words de
note are endowment of Vice Pres
ident Nixon. Assuredly, there is
nothing unusual in such an alle
gation.
What is unusual is that the Re
publicans not only make this al
legation but attempt to prove it.
Their proof hinges on the con
cept that Nixon possesses the
qualities in question because of
his experience. Eight years as
Vice President, the argument
runs, have produced in Nixon the
wisdom, maturity, and judgment
so necessary in the next Presi
dent.
It is a wry comment on the
vagaries of American political
life that this argument, the heart
and soul of the Republican nomi
nee's campaign for the Presi
dency, is entirely untenable.
In amassing what is referred
to as his experience Nixon has en
gaged in four main types of ac
tivity: he lias traveled to foreign
countries on ceremonial goodwill
tours; he has campaigned domes
tically for himself and for other
candidates; he has presided over
the groups that coordinated Exec
utive affairs during President
Eisenhower's illnesses; and he
has been present at meetings of
and occasionally advised the Cab
inet and the National Security
Council and served as Chairman
of the President's Committee on
Governmental Contracts and the
Cabinet Committee on Price Sta
bility and Economic Growth.
The individual who undergoes
experience of this sort need not
necessarily emerge wiser, more
mature, or with better judgment.
No necessary casual relationship
exists between undergoing such
experiences and acquiring wis
dom, maturity, and judgment.
Certainly many of those who have
been subjected to such experi
ences have sadly lacked these
qualities. The power to produce
these qualities in an individual
resides not in these experiences
nor in any other experiences but
in the individual himself.
In short, the proven method to
create wisdom and maturity in
the human animal simply docs
not exist. If it did, wise and ma
ture men could be manufactured
at will. To argue simply that
Nixon is possessed of the quali
ties in question is at least to pay

lip service to plausibility, but to
claim that his experience has pro
duced these qualities in him is to
spit in the face of rationality.
Despite its fatal weaknesses,
the Nixon argument convinces
many voters. Its efficacy results
from a peculiar foible in the vot
ers' political understanding:.
Americans identify occupational
competence with technical com
petence. They assume that jobs of
power and responsibility require
a high degree of technical skill.
Such skill can only be acquired
through complete familiarity with
the job at hand and thorough
training in the methods of getting
it done. Nixon argues that his
eight years' experience in the Ex
ecutive Branch have provided him
the greatest possible familiarity
and best conceivable training for
the Presidency.
What the voters do not under
stand is that the Presidency is
not a technical job. To use the
powers of his office to their full
est advantage the President needs
neither knowledge of nor facility
with any definite body of facts
or any specific system of analysis.
No laboratory, no textbook, no
lecturer, no tutor can teach a
man how to be President, for the
problem the President faces is
not how to do it but what to do.
In "Mr. Citizen." Harry Truman
puts it succinctly: "There's noth
ing in our history, so far as I am
able to find out, that shows a
man can be trained to be Presi
dent of the United Slates."
But few see through the Nixon
arguments. To most, the image he
has so assiduously cultivated is
clear. Nixon appears the calm,
wise, mature, experienced admin
istrator, eminently capable of
sailing the ship of state on an
even keel. As a candidate prom
ising smooth, efficient, orderly
government, Nixon is superb.

qualities in question because of
his experience. Eight years as
Vice President, the argument
runs, have produced in Nixon the
wisdom, maturity, and judgment
so necessary in the next Presi
dent.
It is a wry comment on the
vagaries of American political
life that this argument, the heart
and soul of the Republican nomi
nee's campaign for the Presi
dency, is entirely untenable.
In amassing what is referred
to as his experience Nixon has en
gaged in four main types of ac
tivity: he lias traveled to foreign
countries on ceremonial goodwill
tours; he has campaigned domes
tically for himself and for other
candidates; he has presided over
the groups that coordinated Exec
utive affairs during President
Eisenhower's illnesses; and he
has been present at meetings of
and occasionally advised the Cab
inet and the National Security
Council and served as Chairman
of the President's Committee on
Governmental Contracts and the
Cabinet Committee on Price Sta
bility and Economic Growth.
The individual who undergoes
experience of this sort need not
necessarily emerge wiser, more
mature, or with better judgment.
No necessary casual relationship
exists between undergoing such
experiences and acquiring wis
dom, maturity, and judgment.
Certainly many of those who have
been subjected to such experi
ences have sadly lacked these
qualities. The power to produce
these qualities in an individual
resides not in these experiences
nor in any other experiences but
in the individual himself.
In short, the proven method to
create wisdom and maturity in
the human animal simply docs
not exist. If it did, wise and ma
ture men could be manufactured
at will. To argue simply that
Nixon is possessed of the quali
ties in question is at least to pay

lip service to plausibility, but to
claim that his experience has pro
duced these qualities in him is to
spit in the face of rationality.
Despite its fatal weaknesses,
the Nixon argument convinces
many voters. Its efficacy results
from a peculiar foible in the vot
ers' political understanding:.
Americans identify occupational
competence with technical com
petence. They assume that jobs of
power and responsibility require
a high degree of technical skill.
Such skill can only be acquired
through complete familiarity with
the job at hand and thorough
training in the methods of getting
it done. Nixon argues that his
eight years' experience in the Ex
ecutive Branch have provided him
the greatest possible familiarity
and best conceivable training for
the Presidency.
What the voters do not under
stand is that the Presidency is
not a technical job. To use the
powers of his office to their full
est advantage the President needs
neither knowledge of nor facility
with any definite body of facts
or any specific system of analysis.
No laboratory, no textbook, no
lecturer, no tutor can teach a
man how to be President, for the
problem the President faces is
not how to do it but what to do.
In "Mr. Citizen." Harry Truman
puts it succinctly: "There's noth
ing in our history, so far as I am
able to find out, that shows a
man can be trained to be Presi
dent of the United Slates."
But few see through the Nixon
arguments. To most, the image he
has so assiduously cultivated is
clear. Nixon appears the calm,
wise, mature, experienced admin
istrator, eminently capable of
sailing the ship of state on an
even keel. As a candidate prom
ising smooth, efficient, orderly
government, Nixon is superb.
Three words saturate current
Republican rhetoric. The words
are wisdom, maturity, and judg
ment. GOP orators daily allege
that the qualities these words de
note are endowment of Vice Pres
ident Nixon. Assuredly, there is
nothing unusual in such an alle

tivity: he lias traveled to foreign
countries on ceremonial goodwill
tours; he has campaigned domes
tically for himself and for other
candidates; he has presided over
the groups that coordinated Exec
utive affairs during President
Eisenhower's illnesses; and he
has been present at meetings of
and occasionally advised the Cab
inet and the National Security
Council and served as Chairman
of the President's Committee on
Governmental Contracts and the
Cabinet Committee on Price Sta
bility and Economic Growth.
The individual who undergoes
experience of this sort need not
necessarily emerge wiser, more
mature, or with better judgment.
No necessary casual relationship
exists between undergoing such
experiences and acquiring wis
dom, maturity, and judgment.
Certainly many of those who have
been subjected to such experi
ences have sadly lacked these
qualities. The power to produce
these qualities in an individual
resides not in these experiences
nor in any other experiences but
in the individual himself.
In short, the proven method to
create wisdom and maturity in
the human animal simply docs
not exist. If it did, wise and ma
ture men could be manufactured
at will. To argue simply that
Nixon is possessed of the quali
ties in question is at least to pay

lip service to plausibility, but to
claim that his experience has pro
duced these qualities in him is to
spit in the face of rationality.
Despite its fatal weaknesses,
the Nixon argument convinces
many voters. Its efficacy results
from a peculiar foible in the vot
ers' political understanding:.
Americans identify occupational
competence with technical com
petence. They assume that jobs of
power and responsibility require
a high degree of technical skill.
Such skill can only be acquired
through complete familiarity with
the job at hand and thorough
training in the methods of getting
it done. Nixon argues that his
eight years' experience in the Ex
ecutive Branch have provided him
the greatest possible familiarity
and best conceivable training for
the Presidency.
What the voters do not under
stand is that the Presidency is
not a technical job. To use the
powers of his office to their full
est advantage the President needs
neither knowledge of nor facility
with any definite body of facts
or any specific system of analysis.
No laboratory, no textbook, no
lecturer, no tutor can teach a
man how to be President, for the
problem the President faces is
not how to do it but what to do.
In "Mr. Citizen." Harry Truman
puts it succinctly: "There's noth
ing in our history, so far as I am
able to find out, that shows a
man can be trained to be Presi
dent of the United Slates."
But few see through the Nixon
arguments. To most, the image he
has so assiduously cultivated is
clear. Nixon appears the calm,
wise, mature, experienced admin
istrator, eminently capable of
sailing the ship of state on an
even keel. As a candidate prom
ising smooth, efficient, orderly
government, Nixon is superb.
Three words saturate current
Republican rhetoric. The words
are wisdom, maturity, and judg
ment. GOP orators daily allege
that the qualities these words de
note are endowment of Vice Pres
ident Nixon. Assuredly, there is
nothing unusual in such an alle
gation.
What is unusual is that the Re
publicans not only make this al
legation but attempt to prove it.
Their proof hinges on the con
cept that Nixon possesses the
qualities in question because of
his experience. Eight years as
Vice President, the argument
runs, have produced in Nixon the
wisdom, maturity, and judgment
so necessary in the next Presi
dent.
It is a wry comment on the
vagaries of American political
life that this argument, the heart
and soul of the Republican nomi
nee's campaign for the Presi
dency, is entirely untenable.
In amassing what is referred
to as his experience Nixon has en
gaged in four main types of ac
tivity: he lias traveled to foreign
countries on ceremonial goodwill
tours; he has campaigned domes
tically for himself and for other
candidates; he has presided over
the groups that coordinated Exec
