# Bowles States Future of India Vital to World
## 
### 
The current political debate
should bo measurably stimulated
with the appearance here today
of Representative Chester Bowles,
a leading spokesman on foreign
policy for the Democratic Party.
An early and active Kennedy sup
porter, he would be almost
assured of a Cabinet post, very
possibly Secretary of State, should
Kennedy win in November.
Bowles was Governor of Con
necticut from 1949-1958 and he
has served as a frequent adviser
and administrator for (lie United
Nations. Following are some of
his stands on U.S. foreign policy:
INDIA. India's success in
achieving satisfactory economic
growth and political stability from
her cur rent and forthcoming
(1961-1966) Five-Year Plans is
vital to the future of democratic
freedom in uncommitted Asia and
Africa. Hundreds of millions of
Asians and Africans are coming
to see that the only practical po
litical and economic alternative to
the ruthlessly totalitarian pro
gram of Communist China is the
pragmatic approach as exempli
fied by democratic India. There
fore, our aid must be adequately
increased, long term and without
political strings.
FOREIGN AID. It must be in
creased markedly. "Today our to
tal national output of goods and
services is double what it was in
those days (of the Marshall Plan*.
There are idle men and idle re
sources ready to be put to work.
The inflationary consequences are
immeasurably less. And the total
additional cost of a truly adequate
economic effort in all of Asia,
Africa and Latin America is only
half the cost of the Marshall
Plan."
RED CHINA. We should "re
move all technical obstacles to the
travel of correspondents still ex
isting on our side so that respon
sibility for the continuing com
munications barrier will clearly
rest with Peking." The U.S. should
oppose "by all necessary means"
any movement by Red China into
Southeast Asia or Formosa.
Recognizing that in fact two
Chinas exist, we should make
clear that we do not intend to
"aid or abet a Nationalist attack
against the mainland." To this
end "we should encourage the neu
tralization of the offshore islands
immediately adjacent to the Chi
nese coast," since they incorrectly
seem to put Red China on the
defensive and serve as rationali
zation for communist military
' buildup.

economic effort in all of Asia,
Africa and Latin America is only
half the cost of the Marshall
Plan."
RED CHINA. We should "re
move all technical obstacles to the
travel of correspondents still ex
isting on our side so that respon
sibility for the continuing com
munications barrier will clearly
rest with Peking." The U.S. should
oppose "by all necessary means"
any movement by Red China into
Southeast Asia or Formosa.
Recognizing that in fact two
Chinas exist, we should make
clear that we do not intend to
"aid or abet a Nationalist attack
against the mainland." To this
end "we should encourage the neu
tralization of the offshore islands
immediately adjacent to the Chi
nese coast," since they incorrectly
seem to put Red China on the
defensive and serve as rationali
zation for communist military
' buildup.
The current political debate
should bo measurably stimulated
with the appearance here today
of Representative Chester Bowles,
a leading spokesman on foreign
policy for the Democratic Party.
An early and active Kennedy sup
porter, he would be almost
assured of a Cabinet post, very
possibly Secretary of State, should
Kennedy win in November.
Bowles was Governor of Con
necticut from 1949-1958 and he
has served as a frequent adviser
and administrator for (lie United
Nations. Following are some of
his stands on U.S. foreign policy:
INDIA. India's success in
achieving satisfactory economic
growth and political stability from
her cur rent and forthcoming
(1961-1966) Five-Year Plans is
vital to the future of democratic
freedom in uncommitted Asia and
Africa. Hundreds of millions of
Asians and Africans are coming
to see that the only practical po
litical and economic alternative to
the ruthlessly totalitarian pro
gram of Communist China is the
pragmatic approach as exempli
fied by democratic India. There
fore, our aid must be adequately
increased, long term and without
political strings.
FOREIGN AID. It must be in
creased markedly. "Today our to
tal national output of goods and
services is double what it was in
those days (of the Marshall Plan*.
There are idle men and idle re
sources ready to be put to work.
The inflationary consequences are
immeasurably less. And the total
additional cost of a truly adequate
economic effort in all of Asia,
Africa and Latin America is only
half the cost of the Marshall
Plan."
