If you are students with any
interest in promoting better un
derstanding among the peoples of
the world, you should stir from
your complacency and approach
the foreign students here at Stan
ford. By taking the initiative you
will develop a better understand
ing of their background. By tak
ing the initiative you will develop
close friendships with many of
the foreign students, begin to de
velop a better understanding of
their backgrounds, and begin to
realize their inspirations.
The Social Division of the In
stitute of International Relations
attempts to make the approach
to the foreign students a more
related one. Every Friday after
noon th<> International Club, a
branch of the lIR, gives a coffee
hour from 4-<i at the International
Center. On Saturday evenings
t here is an "Evening Abroad" pro
gram which includes movies and
music sponsored by students from
one of the various nations repre
sented here at Stanford.
The Sidewalk Cafe is another
feature in the lIR program to
create more opportunities for
American and foreign students to
become acquainted in an infor
mal setting. The International
Center is located two doors up
from the Post Office. We invite
all students to drop by.
During the year lIR and the
International Club will offer nu
merous social activities, specifi
cally, an International Cabaret,
an inexpensive trip to Mexico and
places of interest within the Unit
ed States. This is your opportun
ity to become acquainted with the
! foreign students and to realisti
cally support the cause of Inter
nationalism.
Before you again complain of
"The Ugly American" in our dip
| lomatic corps, stop short and look
at yourself in the mirror! Do you
actually know what is going on
or do you merely scan the head

lines? Have you attempted to 1111-1
veil nil the mysterious facets of
the international problem? liven
more basically â€” what have you 1
done to further the cause of In
ternationalism on the Stanford
campus? The lilt needs your sup
port and so docs International
ism !
