# Stanford's First Nigerian Students Tell of Nation's Independence
## 
### GREGG HOPKINS 
Last Saturday was Indepen
dence Day for two Stanford fresh
men living in Stern Hall. Oye
beamiji Alabi Oladele and Michael
Iserheim Osarugiwa Ero watched
with pride ast heir homeland, the
Federation of Nigeria, became a
completely independent member
of the British Commonwealth on
October 1.
The first students to attend
Stanford from Nigeria. Alabi and
Mike are both graduates of Brit
ish-style secondary schools in the
Western region of the three-state
: Nigerian confederation. They're
; two of 24 Nigerian students in
this country this year on four
: year all-expense scholarships.
ERO, who said he felt "person
ally very proud" of the nation's
j complete break with outside rule,
| explained that Nigeria has been
for several years nearly indepen
dent, with only aßritish gover
nor-general to oversee matters,
j The Nigerian federal government,
with its capital at Lagos, is simi
j lar to that of the U.S., said Ola
dele.
Eliminating illiteracy among its

136 million people is the new na
tion's greatest task, Oladele said.
Compulsory free elementary
schools exist for children in the
rich Western region of the coun
try and the East and North areas
are moving toward this goal. Ni
geria's two universities, one brand
new and established along Ameri
! can university lines, are full, said
Ero, as are the three Institutes
of Art, Science and Technology
which train engineers and other
technical professions. The Niger
ian government is s ending as
many students as possible abroad
to study.
The men are both enrolled in
Western Civ and English I. Ero
said he found semantic difficul
ties at first; the words he used
had different interpretations in
his Nigerian experience. Oladele
mentioned that he had already
done much of ihe work assigned
in his chiemstry class, hut he
took the rather philosophic atti
tude that "it's best for the ma
jority," and looks forward to
greater challenges.
ERO has been impressed with
the international aspect of Amer
ican affairs being stressed in the
national election campaign. Ni
geria, he said, has had little con
tact with the U.S. because of close
political and economic ties with
Britain, but he thinks there will
be more now that Nigeria is free
to choose what associations it
wants. Ero also feels there is
little chance for Communism to
succeed in his country.
There has been no racial or
inter-tribal strife in Nigeria, Ero
said, despite the fact that there
j are three distinct language
groups, one of them Moslem Bcr

hers, each with several subdivi
sions. Referring to people, "Words
such as black and white are mean
ingless in Nigeria," he remarked.
Oladele pointed out that although
each of the three major groups
I has a majority in one of the re
gions, there is nowhere any dis
crimination. "Everyone is simply
a Nigerian," said Ero. English is
i the country's official language.
Oladele is a civil engineering
major. He commentedo n the rel
| ative informality of S t a n 112 or d
| classes - particularly discussions
las stressed in Western Civ —
and remarked that one "can hard
ly tell a student froma profes
sor." Although he said he's sat
isfield with everything at Stan
ford — the men are arbitrarily
assigned to Stanford and to dif
ferent rommates at Stern Ero
declined to voice an impression
I of the University in general. That
will come much later, he said.

Last Saturday was Indepen
dence Day for two Stanford fresh
men living in Stern Hall. Oye
beamiji Alabi Oladele and Michael
Iserheim Osarugiwa Ero watched
with pride ast heir homeland, the
Federation of Nigeria, became a
completely independent member
of the British Commonwealth on
October 1.
The first students to attend
Stanford from Nigeria. Alabi and
Mike are both graduates of Brit
ish-style secondary schools in the
Western region of the three-state
: Nigerian confederation. They're
; two of 24 Nigerian students in
this country this year on four
: year all-expense scholarships.
ERO, who said he felt "person
ally very proud" of the nation's
j complete break with outside rule,
| explained that Nigeria has been
for several years nearly indepen
dent, with only aßritish gover
nor-general to oversee matters,
j The Nigerian federal government,
with its capital at Lagos, is simi
j lar to that of the U.S., said Ola
dele.
Eliminating illiteracy among its

136 million people is the new na
tion's greatest task, Oladele said.
Compulsory free elementary
schools exist for children in the
rich Western region of the coun
try and the East and North areas
are moving toward this goal. Ni
geria's two universities, one brand
new and established along Ameri
! can university lines, are full, said
Ero, as are the three Institutes
of Art, Science and Technology
which train engineers and other
technical professions. The Niger
ian government is s ending as
many students as possible abroad
to study.
The men are both enrolled in
Western Civ and English I. Ero
said he found semantic difficul
ties at first; the words he used
had different interpretations in
his Nigerian experience. Oladele
mentioned that he had already
done much of ihe work assigned
in his chiemstry class, hut he
took the rather philosophic atti
tude that "it's best for the ma
jority," and looks forward to
greater challenges.
ERO has been impressed with
the international aspect of Amer
ican affairs being stressed in the
national election campaign. Ni
geria, he said, has had little con
tact with the U.S. because of close
political and economic ties with
Britain, but he thinks there will
be more now that Nigeria is free
to choose what associations it
wants. Ero also feels there is
little chance for Communism to
succeed in his country.
There has been no racial or
inter-tribal strife in Nigeria, Ero
said, despite the fact that there
j are three distinct language
groups, one of them Moslem Bcr

hers, each with several subdivi
sions. Referring to people, "Words
such as black and white are mean
ingless in Nigeria," he remarked.
