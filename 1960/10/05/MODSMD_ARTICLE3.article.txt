## Campaigning Opponents Hit Platform Costs 
### United Press International 
Sen. John F. Kennedy said last
night that President Eisenhower
showed "good judgment" in re
jecting a proposal by five top
neutralist nations for him to meet
with Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev.
Speaking in Indianapolis, the
Democratic Presidential candidate
said the President made a wise
decision in view of Khrushchev's
"harsh, intransigent statements
over the last three weeks."
The statement came as a climax
to a campaign day which found
Kennedy and his opponent, Vice
President Richard M. Nixon, hit
ting hard at the cost of each par
ty's platform promises,
NIXON, campaigning through
New Jersey, said the Democratic
farm program would increase
overall food prices by 25 per cent
and cut beef and pork supplies
below the rationing levels of
World War 11.
He said city families would
have to pay "almost six cents
more for a quart of milk. 22
cents a pound more for chicken,
23 cents a pound more for pork,
15 cents more for a pound of
choice beef, and two cents more
for a loaf of bread."
Kennedy, in a tour of Indiana
districts, accused Nixon of using
"wholly fictitious" figures to esti
mate the cost of the 1960 Demo
cratic platform.
Furthermore, he said, during
the 1/ years of Republican rule,
"the government has operated at
a deficit exceeding $18 billion."
The GOP administration, he add
ed. "ran up the highest peacetime
deficit in our nation's history."
In New Jersey, Nixon was go
ing through much the same ter
ritory that Kennedy visited last
month. GOP leaders acknowl
edged that the Democratic nomi
nee had much strength there, but
said that Nixon's campaigning
could swing the state to the Re
publicans.
NIXON hit at the cost of the
Democratic farm program. He
said it would throw out of work
about one million people engaged
in "serving the needs of farm
people and handling their prod
ucts."
His own farm program was
"sound," Nixon said, but the
Democrats' would lead to higher
food prices, shorter supplies of
some food, and more controls.
Kennedy, in his attack on the
"hidden" cost of the Republican
plans, had this to say on farm j
problems: "Our farm budget has I
not been managed in a way that
brought prosperity to the farmer
for his income is the lowest in
20 years."

His own farm program was
"sound," Nixon said, but the
Democrats' would lead to higher
food prices, shorter supplies of
some food, and more controls.
Kennedy, in his attack on the
"hidden" cost of the Republican
plans, had this to say on farm j
problems: "Our farm budget has I
not been managed in a way that
brought prosperity to the farmer
for his income is the lowest in
20 years."
Sen. John F. Kennedy said last
night that President Eisenhower
showed "good judgment" in re
jecting a proposal by five top
neutralist nations for him to meet
with Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev.
Speaking in Indianapolis, the
Democratic Presidential candidate
said the President made a wise
decision in view of Khrushchev's
"harsh, intransigent statements
over the last three weeks."
The statement came as a climax
to a campaign day which found
Kennedy and his opponent, Vice
President Richard M. Nixon, hit
ting hard at the cost of each par
ty's platform promises,
NIXON, campaigning through
New Jersey, said the Democratic
farm program would increase
overall food prices by 25 per cent
and cut beef and pork supplies
below the rationing levels of

He said city families would
have to pay "almost six cents
more for a quart of milk. 22
cents a pound more for chicken,
23 cents a pound more for pork,
15 cents more for a pound of
choice beef, and two cents more
for a loaf of bread."
Kennedy, in a tour of Indiana
districts, accused Nixon of using
"wholly fictitious" figures to esti
mate the cost of the 1960 Demo
cratic platform.
Furthermore, he said, during
the 1/ years of Republican rule,
"the government has operated at
a deficit exceeding $18 billion."
The GOP administration, he add
ed. "ran up the highest peacetime
deficit in our nation's history."
In New Jersey, Nixon was go
ing through much the same ter
ritory that Kennedy visited last
month. GOP leaders acknowl
edged that the Democratic nomi
nee had much strength there, but
said that Nixon's campaigning
could swing the state to the Re
publicans.
NIXON hit at the cost of the
Democratic farm program. He
said it would throw out of work
about one million people engaged
in "serving the needs of farm
people and handling their prod
ucts."
