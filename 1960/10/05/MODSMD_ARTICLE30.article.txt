# CHURCH RENEWS CRITICISM
## Castro Attacks Rebel Camps 
### 
HAVANA (UPIt Fidel Castro I
was reported yesterday to have |
ordered 15,000 men into an all-1
out campaign to wipe out rebel
nests of resistance in central
Cuba's Sierra de Escambray.
Extent of the armed resistance]
to the Castro regime was indi-j
cated by reports that government
forces captured a $500,000 air j
drop of arms and equipment to
the Sierra rebels last Thursday.
THE REPORTS said an uniden
tified twin-engined B-26 plane
mistakenly dropped 17 arms laden
parachutes near Cienfuegos when
its pilot mistook ground signals
flashed by government men as
coming from a rebel source.
The arms drop was said to in
clude 40 Garand rifles, three ..10-

caliber machineguns, three bazoo-1
kas, several mortars, three radio j
transmitters, a large supply of |
hand grenades and an estimated
10,01)0 rounds of ammunition for
each rifle and maehinegun.
There was no indication where
the arms-smuggling flight origi-1
nated. The arms crates were said ;
to be stamped "Long live Christ !
the King . . . against Communist :
Fidel Castro" and a Spanish ver
sion of the World War II song
"Praise the Lord and Pass the
Ammunition."
THERE WAS no official indi
cation of what success the gov
ernment drive was meeting. Au- j
thoritative sources said the army i
and militia troops had rounded!
up "about 115 counter-revolution '
aries" in the past three weeks. :

[ However, two oilier unidenti
fied planes were said to have
flown over the rebel Esoambray
hideouts last Sunday and it was
assumed they parachuted supplies
or reinforcements to the guer
rillas.
THE ROMAN Catholic Church,
meanwhile, renewed its criticism
of Cuba's drift into the Commu
nist camp.
A pastoral letter signed by San
tiago Archbishop Enrique Perez
Serrantes charged communists
were trying to take over the rev
olution.
Distribution of the circular co-
I incided with reports that anti
| Castro elements are uniting
I against communist infiltration of
I Cuba, however much they may
l differ on other issues.

HAVANA (UPIt Fidel Castro I
was reported yesterday to have |
ordered 15,000 men into an all-1
out campaign to wipe out rebel
nests of resistance in central
Cuba's Sierra de Escambray.
Extent of the armed resistance]
to the Castro regime was indi-j
cated by reports that government
forces captured a $500,000 air j
drop of arms and equipment to
the Sierra rebels last Thursday.
THE REPORTS said an uniden
tified twin-engined B-26 plane
mistakenly dropped 17 arms laden
parachutes near Cienfuegos when
its pilot mistook ground signals
flashed by government men as
coming from a rebel source.
The arms drop was said to in
clude 40 Garand rifles, three ..10-

caliber machineguns, three bazoo-1
kas, several mortars, three radio j
transmitters, a large supply of |
hand grenades and an estimated
10,01)0 rounds of ammunition for
each rifle and maehinegun.
There was no indication where
the arms-smuggling flight origi-1
nated. The arms crates were said ;
to be stamped "Long live Christ !
the King . . . against Communist :
Fidel Castro" and a Spanish ver
sion of the World War II song
"Praise the Lord and Pass the
Ammunition."
THERE WAS no official indi
cation of what success the gov
ernment drive was meeting. Au- j
thoritative sources said the army i
and militia troops had rounded!
up "about 115 counter-revolution '
aries" in the past three weeks. :

[ However, two oilier unidenti
fied planes were said to have
flown over the rebel Esoambray
hideouts last Sunday and it was
assumed they parachuted supplies
or reinforcements to the guer
rillas.
THE ROMAN Catholic Church,
meanwhile, renewed its criticism
of Cuba's drift into the Commu
nist camp.
A pastoral letter signed by San
tiago Archbishop Enrique Perez
Serrantes charged communists
were trying to take over the rev
olution.
