offered to those who wish them.
The Stanford Public Relations
Board is revitalizing its program
according to Anne Feichtmeir and
Roger Fitch, co-chairmen of the
board. This year Ihe board will
concentrate on public relations in
stead of publicity work and poster
pr in t in g, thus necessitating a
larger staff.
The board will be headed by a
20-member board of directors,
each of whom will have charge
of a specific field, such as rela
tions with high schools and other
colleges. The board will keep files
on all aspects of Stanford life,
including campus organizations,
the Speaker's Bureau, and social
activities. The board is also re
sponsible for the banner hanging
over the street in front of the
Cellar, the silk screen, and the
Christmas cards for the ASSU.
