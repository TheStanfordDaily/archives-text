A NEW COLUMN REQUIRES a word of introduction. First of
all, its been a hectic week trying to decide on a name for this space.
A proper name should be catchy, or relate to sports or have the word
"STANFORD" appeal* at least once or . . . Actually this writer fa
vored something a hit more honest, such as "Out of It."
Of all the journalistic fields, sports writing seems to generate
the biggest share of "experts." It's easy. Anyone can predict ;i foot
ball game the hardest part is growing a thick skin for next Mon
day morning. And as far as reporting goes, even the most illogical
alibi sounds plausible to the disillusioned Monday morning fan.
BUT THIS ISN'T A criticism of sports writing. It's only a recog
nition that sports writing is part of tne ritual of sports, a ritual that
often enlightens the fan and creates interest.
Don't expect any new format in this space. There'll still be pre
dictions, analysises and mumbo-jumbo. And you can believe what
you like.
With that let's get right down to business with a look at West
Coast football.
Wasn't so long ago that the Big Five schools and the three North
west schools, Oregon, Oregon State and Washington State plus junior

member Idaho formed what was
known as the Pacific Coast Con
ference. It was a conference that
included football, baseball, basket
ball and track competition and it
was based on a rivalry that lasted
from the first intercollegiate foot
ball games on the West Coast
until the breakup in 1958.
THIS SI'LIT came mainly be
cause of financial reasons; weak
sister northern schools just
weren't good drawing crowds in
Ihe football-happy Los Angeles
area . And southern schools
couldn't afford long trips to the
North for games attended by only
a few thousand people.
Recent developments have
brought the issue into new focus.
University of Southern Cali
fornia has lost three games in a
row this season and five in a row
since the end of last year. UCLA,
while off to a good start, has an
enforced two-week rest because of
difficulty in lining up suitable op
ponents. At the same time two

professional football teams, including the new Los Angeles Chargers,
Dodgers and <i host of other professional athletes are competing for
the spectator dollar in Southern California.
TO THE NOKTII, Oregon. Washington State and Oregon State
are considering joining a new conference that might include Arizona
State, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Utah State, Wyoming, and BYU.
This might be a crucial time for West Coast football. As Assistant
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor put it. "We've just about given up
on the idea of an airplane conference with independents across the
nation. That means that if the AAWU is going to expand to include
new schools, then the northwest schools are the logical ones to in
clude, and if they join a new conference, that will make it that much
tougher on us."
AAWU expansion is a necessity. Football is a sport that must
stay tuned to the public's whims and right now the public isn't buy
ing a five-team conference. What does it mean to bo champion of The
Big Five? To Mr. Football Fan it means that the champs were better
than the four other schools and that's all.
A FIVE-TEAM CONFERENCE just doesn't have any meaning.
When Stanford plays four conference games and six nonconferenee
games are they independents or a member of a conference? It takes
eight or ten schools to provide a good rivalry.
Pressure s On
The pressure is on. True, the northwest schools have schedules
filled through 1966, but if they have to join a new conference they
will have to commit themselves and start laying plans before 196.").
Los Angeles area schools may find that expanding the conference is
an economic necessity. And if there is to be an eight-team confer
ence that excludes old PCC members, it will be a fairly make-shift
group.
Feeling is in the North that the proposed new conference involv
ing the three independents and southwest teams would strictly bo
a step down from the quality of the old PCC. The northern schools
would probably welcome an invitation to join the AAWU. Stanford,
Cal and Washington also might be ammenable toward the idea of
including northwest schools. The only schools really resisting are
those in the Los Angeles area; they may change their viewpoints
when the pro football pinch begins to hurt.
THE 1)1 EE.IIA KIMNCJS us light back to the ritual of spoil. USC
probably won't be able to offer a substitute for pro ball; what they
can offer is interesting football between traditional intercollegiate
rivals. Fifty years of rivalry, based on old school ties is something
that appeals to every sports fan and it is something that the pros
can never offer.
The PCC may be a necessitv.

AAWU Needs Northwest?
A NEW COLUMN REQUIRES a word of introduction. First of
all, its been a hectic week trying to decide on a name for this space.
A proper name should be catchy, or relate to sports or have the word
"STANFORD" appeal* at least once or . . . Actually this writer fa
vored something a hit more honest, such as "Out of It."
Of all the journalistic fields, sports writing seems to generate
the biggest share of "experts." It's easy. Anyone can predict ;i foot
ball game the hardest part is growing a thick skin for next Mon
day morning. And as far as reporting goes, even the most illogical
alibi sounds plausible to the disillusioned Monday morning fan.
BUT THIS ISN'T A criticism of sports writing. It's only a recog
nition that sports writing is part of tne ritual of sports, a ritual that
often enlightens the fan and creates interest.
Don't expect any new format in this space. There'll still be pre
dictions, analysises and mumbo-jumbo. And you can believe what
you like.
With that let's get right down to business with a look at West
Coast football.
Wasn't so long ago that the Big Five schools and the three North
west schools, Oregon, Oregon State and Washington State plus junior

member Idaho formed what was
known as the Pacific Coast Con
ference. It was a conference that
included football, baseball, basket
ball and track competition and it
was based on a rivalry that lasted
from the first intercollegiate foot
ball games on the West Coast
until the breakup in 1958.
THIS SI'LIT came mainly be
cause of financial reasons; weak
sister northern schools just
weren't good drawing crowds in
Ihe football-happy Los Angeles
area . And southern schools
couldn't afford long trips to the
North for games attended by only
a few thousand people.
Recent developments have
brought the issue into new focus.
University of Southern Cali
fornia has lost three games in a
row this season and five in a row
since the end of last year. UCLA,
while off to a good start, has an
enforced two-week rest because of
difficulty in lining up suitable op
ponents. At the same time two

professional football teams, including the new Los Angeles Chargers,
Dodgers and <i host of other professional athletes are competing for
the spectator dollar in Southern California.
TO THE NOKTII, Oregon. Washington State and Oregon State
are considering joining a new conference that might include Arizona
State, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Utah State, Wyoming, and BYU.
This might be a crucial time for West Coast football. As Assistant
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor put it. "We've just about given up
on the idea of an airplane conference with independents across the
nation. That means that if the AAWU is going to expand to include
new schools, then the northwest schools are the logical ones to in
clude, and if they join a new conference, that will make it that much
tougher on us."
AAWU expansion is a necessity. Football is a sport that must
stay tuned to the public's whims and right now the public isn't buy
ing a five-team conference. What does it mean to bo champion of The
Big Five? To Mr. Football Fan it means that the champs were better
than the four other schools and that's all.
A FIVE-TEAM CONFERENCE just doesn't have any meaning.
When Stanford plays four conference games and six nonconferenee
games are they independents or a member of a conference? It takes
eight or ten schools to provide a good rivalry.
Pressure s On
The pressure is on. True, the northwest schools have schedules
filled through 1966, but if they have to join a new conference they
will have to commit themselves and start laying plans before 196.").

AAWU expansion is a necessity. Football is a sport that must

than the four other schools and that's all.
A FIVE-TEAM CONFERENCE just doesn't have any meaning.
When Stanford plays four conference games and six nonconferenee
games are they independents or a member of a conference? It takes
eight or ten schools to provide a good rivalry.

CHUCK TAYLOR
AAWU Needs Northwest?
A NEW COLUMN REQUIRES a word of introduction. First of
all, its been a hectic week trying to decide on a name for this space.
A proper name should be catchy, or relate to sports or have the word
"STANFORD" appeal* at least once or . . . Actually this writer fa
vored something a hit more honest, such as "Out of It."
Of all the journalistic fields, sports writing seems to generate
the biggest share of "experts." It's easy. Anyone can predict ;i foot
ball game the hardest part is growing a thick skin for next Mon
day morning. And as far as reporting goes, even the most illogical
alibi sounds plausible to the disillusioned Monday morning fan.
BUT THIS ISN'T A criticism of sports writing. It's only a recog
nition that sports writing is part of tne ritual of sports, a ritual that
often enlightens the fan and creates interest.
Don't expect any new format in this space. There'll still be pre
dictions, analysises and mumbo-jumbo. And you can believe what
you like.
With that let's get right down to business with a look at West
Coast football.
Wasn't so long ago that the Big Five schools and the three North
west schools, Oregon, Oregon State and Washington State plus junior

member Idaho formed what was
known as the Pacific Coast Con
ference. It was a conference that
included football, baseball, basket
ball and track competition and it
was based on a rivalry that lasted
from the first intercollegiate foot
ball games on the West Coast
until the breakup in 1958.
THIS SI'LIT came mainly be
cause of financial reasons; weak
sister northern schools just
weren't good drawing crowds in
Ihe football-happy Los Angeles
area . And southern schools
couldn't afford long trips to the
North for games attended by only
a few thousand people.
Recent developments have
brought the issue into new focus.
University of Southern Cali
fornia has lost three games in a
row this season and five in a row
since the end of last year. UCLA,
while off to a good start, has an
enforced two-week rest because of
difficulty in lining up suitable op
ponents. At the same time two

professional football teams, including the new Los Angeles Chargers,
Dodgers and <i host of other professional athletes are competing for
the spectator dollar in Southern California.
TO THE NOKTII, Oregon. Washington State and Oregon State
are considering joining a new conference that might include Arizona
State, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Utah State, Wyoming, and BYU.
This might be a crucial time for West Coast football. As Assistant
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor put it. "We've just about given up
on the idea of an airplane conference with independents across the
nation. That means that if the AAWU is going to expand to include
new schools, then the northwest schools are the logical ones to in
clude, and if they join a new conference, that will make it that much
