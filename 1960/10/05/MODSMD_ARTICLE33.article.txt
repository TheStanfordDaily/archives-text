# Huskies Have Speed, Depth
## Daily Sports 
### KEN DERY 
The Washington Huskies are
fighting mad and it's just too
bad that Stanford is next on their
schedule.
Stunned 15-14 by Navy last Sat
urday on a last-minute field goal,
coach Jim Owens' squad invades
Palo Alto in an effort to regain
their national prestige. This week
finds the Huskies ranked 15th,
while just one week ago the boys
from Seattle were thought to be
tbet hird best team in the coun
t ry.
IN THIS lIOI'E of crushing
Stanford before a national televi
sion audience, Washington's pow
erful line and exceptional back
field will no doubt go all out.
The team is led by All Ameri
can quarterback Rob Schloredt.
This one-eyed hero led the Hus
kies to the Rose Bowl champion
ship last season and his general
ship and elusive ball handling
were tremendous in the rout of
Big Ten representative Wiscon
sin. Last season Schloredt hit on
39 of 75 passes for 52' < and five
touchdowns. He and Indian Dick
Norman should have a splendid
duel indeed.
Bob is considered the best pun
ter in Husky history and his de
fensive play is outstanding as he
stole six enemy aerials last sea
son.
IN THE BACKFIRED with
Schloredt are halfbacks George
Fleming and Charlie Mitchell and
fullback Ray Jackson.
Mitchell is the boy who every
one in the Northwest is talking
about for he is the exciting break
away type runner that the fans
adore. Just 19 years old and a
sophomore, Charlie is the darling
of all except the opposition when
he breaks into the open.
Mitchell's running mate is vet
eran George Fleming, a two-year
letterman from Dallas, Texas.
One of the heroes in last year's
Rose Bowl game, George adds
maturity and balance to the
spurts of young Mitchell.
AI)I) TO THIS the power of
small (5-9, 180) Ray Jackson at
fullback and you have a back
field that can really move the
football.
The linemen are nothing to for
get either. Lee Folkins at end
played -436 minutes last season
and c e r t a in 1 y knows his way
around.
Kurt Gegner and Chuck Allen.
All-Coast selections last season,
are back, as is every other mem
ber of that championship starting
unit. Roy McKasson is leading
the defense and Cactus Jack Cur
tis' Indians should really have a
busv afternoon.
