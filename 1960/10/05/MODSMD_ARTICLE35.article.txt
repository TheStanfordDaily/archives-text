Stanford's Indians open their
1960 water polo schedule with a
new coach and a nearly new team
wien they tangle with the power
ful California Boars this Friday
at 3:30 in the varsity pool.
The new coach is Jim Gaugh
ran, a former Stanford swimming
and water polo star. Gaughran,
who cavorted for the Indians dur
ing the 1950-1934 seasons, was a
member of the U.S. water polo
team in the 1956 Olympic Games
at Melbourne.
This is only the Indians' second
year of water polo since Stanford
stopped participating in the sport
after the 1955 campaign. Reviv
ing activity last season, the Cards
came up with a one-win, seven
loss record, but look to be im
proved this season.
Coach Gaughran, who said that
Stanford is about two years away
I from a championship calibre

i squad, expects the Indians to
break even this year.
Beating California this Friday
! will be a large order for the
Cards, but with the likes of re
turning goalie John Bates and the
Lorton Brothers, Bob and John,
Stanford expects to improve on
last year's shellacking at the
I hands of the Bears.
Also slated to se heavy duty
| for the water polo squad are
; Roger Johnson, Rich Rosenber
. gor, Bob Spence and Mike Conn.
I A bright spot for future Indian
water polo teams is this year's
frosh crop. Led by Don Buehler
and the third Lorton brother, Bill,
both of whom participated in this
year's U.S. Olympics trials, Hie
frosh might well come through
the season without a loss.
The Papooses also open their
| campaign this Friday, meeting
i the Cal frosh at 4:30 in the var
' sily pool.
