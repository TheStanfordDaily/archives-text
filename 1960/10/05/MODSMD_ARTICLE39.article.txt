# Planning of WUS Drive Underway
## 
### 
The World University Service
is under way in the planning of
its annual "WUS Drive."
WUS is a world-wide organiza
tion engaged in aiding some 40
countries in such varied problems
as those of student health, lodg
ing, and living. It also maintains
refugee services.
This year's ExCom at Stanford
consists of Holly Gruhun, Chair
man of the Stanford International
Relief Organization; Patsy Reilly,
Drive Chairman; Marcia Brooks,
Educational Chairman; Steve
Corker, Fund Raising Chairman;
Rich Garlinghouse, Publicity
Chairman; and Steve Foster, Fi
nancial Manager. The faculty ad
viser to WUS is Dr. William Alia
way, Assistant Dean of Men.
In planning the drive, the com
mittee meets weekly in its newly
acquired WUS shack behind the
IIR building. The dates of the
drive will be announced later in
the Daily.
