UNITED NATI O N S, N.Y.
(UPI i â€” The Soviet Union yester
day backed down on its attacks
on the United Nations and Secre
tary-General Dag Hammarskjold,
and informed -sources predicted
Russia would touch off no new
world crisis until after the U.S.
election.
They believed it possible So
viet Premier Nikita Khrushchev
would demand a new summit ses
sion in January or February.
The predictions were based on
talks between Khrushchev and
British Prime Minister Harold
Macmillan and included the ques
tion of a showdown on West Ger
many and the mounting Com
munist pressure on West Berlin.
MACMILLAN and Khrushchev
had the only high-level East-West
contacts of the present 15th Gen
eral Assembly of the United Na
tions.
Indicative of the softening of
the Soviet attitude toward Ham
marskjold was a statement by a
member of the Soviet delegation
yesterday that Russia's attitude
toward Hammarskjold henceforth
will depend on his future conduct.
The delegation source said there
had been no decision yet as to
whether the Communist nations
would boycott Hammarskjold as
they did former Secretary Trygve
Lie. The Communist boycott
eventually forced Lie's resigna
tion.
INFORMED sources said the
British had reached the conclu
sion that Khrushchev would not
force the issue on Germany or
Berlin, by signing a separate
peace treaty with the East Ger
mans, or any other major issue
without offering the possibility
for further talks with the West.
If the West refused such talks,
the sources said, Khrushchev
could be expected to take forceful
action.
Neutralist leaders also ex
pressed determination to press
their efforts to bring President
Eisenhower and Khrushchev face
to-face despite the two's reluc
tance to meet.
"We intend to push our reso
lution with all our might and
main." said Prime Minister Ja
waharlal Nehru of India.
NEHRU took leadership for
pushing the five-power neutralist
call for an Eisenhower-Khru
shchev meeting, according to Bur
mese Ambassador U Thant. this
month's Afro-Asian chairman.
Other sponsors of the resolu
tion who addressed the Afro-
Asians were President Gamal
Abdel Nasser of the United Arab
Republic, President Kwarae Nkru
mah of Ghana and President Su
karno of Indonesia. President
Tito of Yugoslavia, the fifth spon
sor, sailed for home yesterday.
