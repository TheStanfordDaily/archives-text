NEW YORK (UPIt- Marshal
Tito of Yugoslavia and President
Gamal Abdei Nasser of the Unit
ed Arab Republic left for home
yesterday in what appeared to be
the start of an exodus of gov
ernment leaders frorr United Na
tions headquarters.
TITO, a member of the neutral
ist camp, said as he sailed home
that the U.N. General Assembly
session had disappointed him. He
said "some sharp statements"
showed lho cold war atmosphere
had worsened, but predicted that
relations eventually would im
prove between the United States
and the Soviet Union.
Nasser, also a key neutralist
leader, left by chartered U.A.R.
plane last night for Cairo, some
what more cheerful. He described
his stay in New York as a "period
of great expectations, hard work
and high hopes."
