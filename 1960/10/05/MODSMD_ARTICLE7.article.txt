## 
### ILENE STRELITZ 
A state senator and audience participation highlighted "An Old
Fashioned Political Rally" staged by the Stanford Area Young
Republicans last night at the Stanford Elementary School.
Sen. Richard Dolwig praised the excellent administration Cali
fornia had been given under the Republicans. This was compared to

"some of the things messed up
under the Brown administration."
Dolwig stated, "We don't know
what elects a candidate—emory
boards, supermarket speeches,
matchbooks. . . ." He also said
"This (the rally) is a workshop;
I don't believe we need talk about
issues."
A SHORT question and answer
period following the senator's
speech brought up his denuncia
tion of the Brown water plan for
one of his own origin. According
to the senator, the Brown plan will
cost $4 billion, not the estimated
one and one-quarter billion.
His plan, Dolwig stated, will
cost only $660 million. The sen
ator is opposed to entering any
water project right now, how
ever, as "Los Angeles doesn't
need any additional water until
1990."
THE SPIRIT of the rally was
conveyed through a motion picture
in which Vice President Nixon de
livered an address geared to Re
publican Party workers through
out the nation. The Republican
standard-bearer stated, "I will
make no speech to a more im
portant group of people. The Re
publican Party must attract the
votes of independents and change
people's votes. For this we em
ploy billboards, newspaper adver
tisements. radio and TV as well as
knocking on doors done in a cour
tous and persuasive manner by
you."
To invite audience participa
tion. questions were tossed at the
onlookers by YR leaders. "Are
we going to put Nixon in office?"
was greeted by a hearty cheer.
"Do we want Junior Kennedy in
office?" received immediate no's
and hissing.
The evening proceeded with
| speeches by prominent local Re
' publicans -stressing I lie value of
j individual campaigning at a local
I level.
