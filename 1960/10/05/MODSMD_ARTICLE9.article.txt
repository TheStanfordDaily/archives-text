## Impossible To Pick Best Films-Critic 
### JUDY SEABORG 
Saturday Review film critic Ar
thur Knight opened the Tuesday
Evening Series last night by
maintaining that "new concepts
of directors and whole new vistas
of what film can and should bo"
make it impossible to determine
"the best films of all time."
The critic-author declared that
"pictures do mean a great deal
to people and have come to be
realized as an art form" in his
discussion of the characteristics
of great films.
Using as a working list a group
of 12 films judged "best" at the
Brussels World Fair, Knight list
ed among common earmarks of
those movies original conception
as a film, vitality of a personal
point of view, a sense of human
ity and an awareness of the cam
era as an instrument of expres
sion rather than reproduction.
KNIGHT, who has written a
history of the movies entitled
"The Liveliest Art." television
scripts, commentaries for docu
mentary films and magazine ar
ticles on the cinema, stated that
Hollywood still speaks of film as
"collaborative ait because it
sounds 'artistic.'"
Discussing his disapproval of
films adapted from another liter
ary medium. Knight said, "The
more successful the original was,
the less successful it will be as a
filmic adaptation," adding in ex
planation that t lie film audience
has an "intimate relationship with
the characters on the screen"
which differs from the essentially
impersonal relationship of the
legitimate theater and the omnis
cient view of the characters in a
book.
KNIGHT also made occasional
reference to film historians, who
"cherish films of the past and
look askance" at new concepts
and experiments in film making.
When asked about the "new
wave" of European films, Knight
offered his belief that the pictures
were concerned more with sensa
tionalism than with social criti
cism.
A film becomes a "work of
art," he concluded, when the
characteristics of originality and
a "sense of humanity" are present
and it "leaps the barriers of time
and language and speaks to us
all."
