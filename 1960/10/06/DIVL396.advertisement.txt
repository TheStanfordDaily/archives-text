fej MEN
The mighty Stanford Crewcut Kings are mighty be
cause we are good. We are good because we are famous
and we are famous because we are the best.
Ask anyone, anytime, on or off the campus who has
been here before and they will agree: "Yes! They are
the best."
Stanford men, we are close by. Right off the campus.
By bike or car drive down Escondido to Stanford Avenue,
then turn left to El Camino to California Avenue. The 10
Stanford Crewcut Kings are here!
We like Stanford men. We challenge you to come visit
us for your next haircut.
