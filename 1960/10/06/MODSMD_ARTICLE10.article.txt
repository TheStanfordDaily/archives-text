# Rep. Bowles Calls for New Approach to Disarmament; Supports Aid Through UN
## Leading Democrat Cites Four Challenges to U.S. 
### ROSS HERMANN 
Representative Chester Bowles, leading Democratic expert on
foreign policy, told students here yesterday afternoon that the next
President of the United Slates must grind out a new approach to
the problem of disarmament.
Speaking to a capacity audience in Memorial Auditorium, Bowles
said that such an approach, based on compromise, must be worked
out because time is running out in the arms race.
His statements on disarmament came while he outlined the role
the United States should play in meeting the challenges of the future.
Bowles summarized these challenges as being:
The world revolution of rising expectations in which people in
backward countries are demanding their share in growth and de
velopment that has been experienced elsewhere.
China, with its 650 million people under totalitarian rule and
with its historical tradition of imperalism. With two acres of

land for every rural family and
a tremendous shortage of oil,
China is looking increasingly to
the oil rich and fertile lands of
Southeast Asia for room to ex
pand.
THE SOVIET Union, the world's
second largest economic power,
which is now experiencing an 8
per cent rate of economic growth.
Nuclear power, with its inher
ent dangers which have been
made more deadly by the fact
that man has progressed little
through the ages in learning how
to live together.
He noted while posing his ques
tion as to the role of the United
States that some people prefer
the nation to follow a policy of
isolationism and let the rest of
the world go its way.
"Bue we know this is impos
sible," Bowles said. "The world
will pass us by."
TO MEET the challenges that
have been put to us, we must
maintain a military machine ade
quate for survival, seek new ap
proaches with the Soviet Union
in achieving disarmament and
easing world tensions, and in
crease economic aid to underde
veloped areas, Bowles said.
He said that more funds should
be put into economic rather than
military aid and that all aid
should be given without political
strings attached.
Bowles gave his appraisal of
the working of Khrushchev's
mind during the current U.N. ses
sion, saying that the Premier has
come to realize only recently that
there is a common bond of inter
ests between the United States
and the newly emmerging na
tions, such as those of Africa. "He
is trying to destroy the United
Nations because it poses a threat
to his plans to conquer Africa."
TO COUNTER his maneuvers,
Bowles said, we must provide our
aid through the framework of the
United Nations, in this way
thwarting Khrushchev and keep
ing the beneficiaries of the aid
out ol the cold war struggle.

He noted while posing his ques

States that some people prefer
the nation to follow a policy of
isolationism and let the rest of
the world go its way.
"Bue we know this is impos
sible," Bowles said. "The world
will pass us by."
TO MEET the challenges that
have been put to us, we must
maintain a military machine ade
quate for survival, seek new ap
proaches with the Soviet Union
in achieving disarmament and
easing world tensions, and in
crease economic aid to underde
veloped areas, Bowles said.
He said that more funds should
be put into economic rather than
military aid and that all aid
should be given without political
strings attached.
Bowles gave his appraisal of
the working of Khrushchev's
mind during the current U.N. ses
sion, saying that the Premier has
come to realize only recently that
there is a common bond of inter
ests between the United States
and the newly emmerging na
tions, such as those of Africa. "He
is trying to destroy the United
Nations because it poses a threat
to his plans to conquer Africa."
TO COUNTER his maneuvers,
Bowles said, we must provide our
aid through the framework of the
United Nations, in this way
thwarting Khrushchev and keep
ing the beneficiaries of the aid
out ol the cold war struggle.
Representative Chester Bowles, leading Democratic expert on
foreign policy, told students here yesterday afternoon that the next
President of the United Slates must grind out a new approach to
the problem of disarmament.
Speaking to a capacity audience in Memorial Auditorium, Bowles
said that such an approach, based on compromise, must be worked
out because time is running out in the arms race.
His statements on disarmament came while he outlined the role
the United States should play in meeting the challenges of the future.
Bowles summarized these challenges as being:
The world revolution of rising expectations in which people in
backward countries are demanding their share in growth and de
velopment that has been experienced elsewhere.
China, with its 650 million people under totalitarian rule and
with its historical tradition of imperalism. With two acres of

land for every rural family and
a tremendous shortage of oil,
China is looking increasingly to
the oil rich and fertile lands of
Southeast Asia for room to ex
