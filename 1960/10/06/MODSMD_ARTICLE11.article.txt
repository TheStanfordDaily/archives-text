# Philadelphia Greets Nixon
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (UPI) Vice
President Richard M. Nixon
ripped into his opponent on the
Civil Rights issue in New York
City and Philadelphia, two of the
nation's biggest cities, and re
ceived perhaps the hugest wel
coming crowd of his entire cam
paign to date here yesterday.
Police estimated that total
crowds of from 400,000 to 500.000
lined the streets in a tremendous
reception for Nixon in this tradi
tionally Democratic stronghold.
The estimates topped those for
any of Nixon's campaign recep
tions to date, including enormous
turnouts in such cities as Boston
and Atlanta.
