General Chairman, African Desk
The African Desk, newly crea
ted division of the lIR, invites
students to answer the increas
ingly obvious need for understand
ing mercurial changes in Africa
and their far-reaching effects. Its
proposed program of self-educa
tion opportunities is for any stu
dent eager to explore Africa's
immediate and potential meaning
for himself and the rest of the
world.
Three main departments within
the Desk—Home Education, Ex
change, and Research—of 112 e r a
range of possibilities for student
participation as African Desk per
sonnel or audience.
A luncheon discussion group
chaired by African s 111 d en t s
attending Stanford; a non-credit
seminar of topical discussion
guided by Peter Duignan, cu
rator of the African Collection at
Hoover Library; formal all-cam
pus presentations with special
speakers and films; and informal
I) r o g r a in s available to living
groups by request make up part
of the Home Education Depart
ment's plans.
To establish a context for even
tual student exchange with Afri
can universities in Ghana, Nigeria,
Southern Rhodesia, East Africa,
and the Union of South Africa,
the Exchange Department begins
its work by exchanging cultural
and academic information with
the universities. Major responsi
bility of the department is the
design and financing of the hoped
for s t u d en t exchange through
which approximately six Stanford
students could receive one-year
scholarships for the specific topic
at an African university. An Ex
change Department Host Commit
tee drawn from seminar partici
pants, would meet African student
exchanges and invite them to
share in African Desk program
at Stanford.
Accomplishment in one depart
ment of the Desk simultaneously
depends on and contributes to
ai-complishment in another: The

| If o m e Education Department
seeks to create Intelligent hosts
| for the Africans already at Stan
i ford and for those anticipated
through stud eat exchange. In
turn, the Exchange Department's
African guests provide richer re
sources for the Home Education
i Department. And only through
the work of the third department,
the Research Department, are the
two others effectively coordinated.
An envisioned file of knowledg
eable people and institutions, of
informative books and the events
stands at the center of the Afri
can Desk's structure and serves
other departments as the Re
search Department, and all inter
ested individuals. Ingenious de
partment members collect and
assemble information on people
and other resources at Stanford
and elsewhere. Exciting personal
contact and correspondence pre
cede file entry and assembly by
geographical area, interest topic,
and function. Ever-growing and
stimulating resources are avail
able to and enriched by other de
partments, students, and institu
tions.
The plans above developed in
discussions among students
already committed to an interest
in Africa. Effective implementa
tion of these ideas at Stanford
and the appearance of their po
tential rewards is dependent on
a more general student interest
which it is the dual aim of the
African Desk to stimulate and to
channel. The details of the ideas
sketched here will appear only as
students appear at IIR to work
with the African Desk.
A film on the Belgian Congo,
"Masters of the Belgian Congo,"
will be shown at 7:30 this eve
ning in Memorial Auditorium. Stu
dents interested in the African
Desk are especially invited and
| asked to stay for an organiza
! tional meeting of Desk personnel.
Tonight any student sharing tin'
| belief that it is an offensive in
| congruity for this nation to claim
: to be an effective world leader
i while ignorant of large areas of
I the world, has the first of many
I opportunities the African Desk
hopes to offer for the incongru
; ity's erasure.
