# Conservative Viewpoint
## 
### MICHAEL GORDON IIR Political Analyst 
Conservatives in this age, and
indeed for many ages past, have
been quite fond of representing
themselves as the realists of
political life. One difficulty with
their claim, however, is that
whereas reality is relentlessly
changing, continually creating
new problems and situations, the
conservatives' approach to it
scarcely changes at all. Mesmer
ized by beatific memories of what
once was, they sometimes fail to
understand the meaning of what
now is.
Nevertheless, in his recent book,
"The Conscience of a Conserva
tive," Senator Barry Goldwater
applies his penetrating conserva
tive gaze to the entire range of
the present political situation in
order to see what he can see. And
what he sees in American foreign
policy in the cold war, he does
not like. The communists mean
it when they say they will bury
us, and it's high time that we
realize this by adopting a realistic
policy to meet their challenge.
His basic contention Ls that in
the cold war America must strive
for nothing short of victory —a
contention that is hardly striking
in itself. But what is striking is
Goldwater's definition of that vic
tory: peace based upon destruc
tion of any and all Soviet threats.
Although he nowhere says this
explicitly, it is clear enough that
by "destruction" he means mili
tary destruction.
For his proposed policy to
achieve victory relies almost ex
clusively upon his country's hav
ing and using superior military
strength (coupled, of course, with
superior spiritual strength*. By
doing this the United States will
be able to asume an offensive
position, the thesis continues, that
will supposedly frustrate all So
viet penetration into the free
world; frustrated, the Soviet bloc
will in turn be penetrated by us,
and in this drive will rely upon
the captive nations now under
communism to revolt, as well as
upon the unleashed strength of
friendly forces like the National
ist Chinese.
Of course, Mr. Goldwater rea

lized that such an offensive might
provoke total war with the So
viets, "But any policy, short of
war, does that." Meanwhile, to
insure that Americans do not suc
cumb to any temptation to settle
I their differences with the Soviets
j peacefully, he next proposes to
declare all communist nations out
laws—and sever diplomatic rela
tions with them.
Admittediry this is an interest
ing thesis, but it seems to suffer
from one outstanding flaw. Were
I it ever actually to be enforced,
the result for America and for
the world could only be disaster.
For in spite of what Mr. Gold
water insists, not every policy,
short of war, carries the same
I danger of starting that war. Two
! powerful blocs, each possessing
sufficient nuclear strength to de
stroy much of the world, there
fore hold its fate in balance, since
this balance is maintained only
by the hope of somehow avoiding
open conflict through negotiation
of differences. By barring that
hope, that balance would be upset,
then the chances of war would be
greatly increased.
Perhaps it is true that diplo
! matic negotiations have not been
entirely fruitful so far, but they
have certainly been fruitful to a
considerable extent: Austria has
been given independence, disarm
ament talks have been initiated,
! Soviet society has opened up to
the outside world, with the result
that at least a common ground
of negotiation has been estab
lished.
An arms race that absorbs a
considerable amount of the an
nual budget of two nations simply
cannot continue indefinitely: it
must terminate some time. The
ability of men to communicate,
to resolve their differences peace
fully may be only slim, but it at
least has a goal of peace. Since
Mr. Goldwater's policy, however,
has only the goal of one side ren
dering the other impotent, it will
insure that the arms race will
most likely terminate in war.
(Editor's Note: Gordon will fin
ish his discussion of a Conserva
tive's view of foreign policy to
morrow.)
