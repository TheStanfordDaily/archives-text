The intervention of the five neu
trals, which was made last Fri
day, has for its object the renewal
of diplomatic contact, now broken,
between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.
As a means of accomplishing this,
the neutrals ask "as a first urgent
step" the renewal of contact be
tween Mr. Eisenhower and Mr.
Khrushchev. This has been inter
preted as meaning personal con
tact, a face-to-face reconciliation
between the two men, and some
remarks of Mr. N'krumah support
this interpretation.
Rut the draft resolution offered
by the five neutrals is carefully
worded. It does not specifically

call for personal
contact. Its pur
pose would be
realized if offi
cial diplomatic
contact were re
stored, and to
this the Presi
dent in his state
ment on Sunday,
jf The door is,
■therefore, open

unless Mr. K slams it shut and
locks and bolts it.
In emphasizing the distinction
between personal contact and dip
lomatic contact, we shall, I be
lieve, be thinking realistically.
Since the U-2 and the aftermath
at Paris in May, 3Ir. K has con
ducted a violent feud against Mr.
Eisenhower personally. The cru
cial question is whether this irre
concilable personal feud is sepa
rate from or is part of an irre
concilable and lasting lend be
tween the Soviet Union and the
United States.
The neutrals assume, or at lpast
they hope, that the personal l'eud
is transitory, and that underneath
it there still exists the possibility
of and the need for negotiations.
For my own part, I am not sure
that they are right, that is to say
right in believing that if the per
sonal feud were healed, negotia
tion would be resumed. I hope
they are right. But there are some
disturbing signs that since the
U-2, which was a personal humili
ation for Mr. K, there has been
a real change of course in Soviet
policy. But, be that as it may,
the neutrals are right in refusing
to accept the defeatist view that
diplomatic negotiation cannot be
renewed.
The neutrals will be wiser, il
seems to me, not to emphasize,
not to press too hard for, a per
sonal meeting. Both men have
been humiliated, Khrushchev by
the avowal that we had some kind
of right to fly over his territory,
Mr. Eisenhower by the insults
heaped upon him. Both men are
angry. They cannot forgive and
forget. They cannot be expected
to meet and talk away their quar
rel and shake hands. Nothing can
be done with this quarrel except
to outlive it.
What can be done, however, is
to restore diplomatic contact at
lower levels. Even this cannot he
done quickly because Mr. Gromy
ko and Mr. Herter dare not for
get or forgive the quarrel of their
chiefs.
The U.N. is faced with the ques
tion of whether the Eisenhower-
Khrushchev quarrel will be pro
longed into the next administra
tion. It may be. We cannot be
sure that Mr. K is not 011 a new
line —one of intransigent cold war.
It is also possible that the can
didates may talk themselves into
a box where they are in honor
bound to continue the feud —to
show how brilliantly they can
stand up to Mr. K by making it
impossible to sit down with him.
If so, the prospect is dark. An
irreparable break which split the
world, which broke the United
Nations, might not lead to war,
but it would surely lead to wide
spread disorder and violence in

all the continents and to a con
dition of profound and universal
uneasiness. It is the duty of the
nations which are not directly in
volved in the feud to bring about
diplomatic contacts. They will
probably not lead to any quick
results. But they may make it
possible to continue diplomatic
intercourse after the personal
feud has receded into the past.
This may not be easy to do. But
the U.N. should not grow weary
of trying and it should not walk
away from this, the central prob
lem of the world.
