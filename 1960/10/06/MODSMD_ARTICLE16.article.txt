Editor, <he Daily:
I am happy to see (hat the Daily
divides letters into two classes:
praise and thoughtless, hotheaded
blasts of criticism. Good old Daily!
What conceits we students would
have were it not for your attitude
of intellectual belittlement!
Larry Breed
Editor, the Daily:
I was simply overawed by the
undisguised brilliance of Harvard
"historian" Arthur Schlesinger,
Jr. The pure, honest beauty of
Mr. Schlesinger's theory "that
strong presidents alternate with
weak ones" may help some young
professor of biology to win a No
bel Prize or something. I can see
that distant day when he theorizes
that ".some trees are tall and some
trees are small."
It. J. Smith
Editor, the Daily:
The title of our campus news
paper is so dull, so common. A
newspaper's masth e a fl name
should be more appealing, more
full of life, more expressive Of
the declared purposes of the paper
itself. With this in mind, may I
suggest that you change the pa
per's name to Tin* Stanford Dem
ocraf.
