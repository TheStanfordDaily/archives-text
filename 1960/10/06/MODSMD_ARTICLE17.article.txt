Editor, the Daily:
After reading your editorial
endorsing the candidacy of Sen
ator Kennedy in the Daily of Octo
ber 3 some thoughts occurred to
me which I would like to pass on
to you.
In regard to newspaper endorse
ments in general, it has been a
very fortunate tiling for the Dem
ocratic Party that such pleas, ema
nating as they have from a heav
ily Republican press, are so often
ignored by the American people.
In regard to your support of Sen
ator Kennedy in particular, it may
well develop that your endorse
ment means less in this election
than the recent support lent Nixon
by the Grand Dragon of the Ku
Klux Klan.
It seems to me that the Daily
is in danger of succumbing to the
fallacy, fostered by both political!

parties, of thinking in terms of,
black and white. I suggest that ;
in the past it has not been wholly |
true that tlie Republican Party j
has been the party of big business ■
and unemployment (A relative of j
mine will not vote for Nixon "lie
cause of what Hoover did").
Neither has it been precisely
correct to picture the Democrat
as favoring war, labor leaders and
economic irresponsibility (An
other relative has referred to
every Democratic candidate since
AI Smith as a "socialist 5.0.b.").
I suggest that, in 1960, there is
the same illogic in blatantly brand
ing the Republicans the party of

.stagnation (your term is "status
| quo"), or in deprecating the Dem
ocratic leadership as one typified
jby callow youth and ignorance
' ("A Man for a Man's Job").
i
I have examined the programs
of both parties, what there is of
them to examine, and have de
cided that I prefer that of Nixon
and the Republican Party. I ad
mit to prior prejudice. It seems
to me that, if the Daily intends
to support Senator Kennedy, it
should conduct a similar examina
tion of the real issues. There must
be better reasons for such a stand
than you have so far presented.
