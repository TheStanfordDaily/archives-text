# Nikita Invited, Club Scolded

### 
MADISON, Wis. (UPI) â€” The
University of Wisconsin yesterday
reprimanded and punished the
campus Socialist Club for inviting
Russia Premier Nikita S. Khru
shchev and Yugoslav President
Josip Tito to speak.
The club was forbidden to pre
sent off-campus speakers until
after Dec. 1 by the University's
Social Life and Interests Commit
tee.
The club was reprimanded for
publicizing the Invitations before
registering them with the Stu
dent Activities Committee.
Ronald Radosh, President of the
50-member Socialists Club, said
the ruling "under the circum
stances was a fair decision."
Radosh and Steve Scheinberg,
Socialist Club member, said they
had not expected Khrushchev to
come to the campus. They had in
tended the publicity of their invi
tation to him to be a means of
showing that the Socialist Club
members disagreed with the
State Department's restriction of
Khrushchev to Manhattan Island.
