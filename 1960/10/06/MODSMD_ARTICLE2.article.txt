# General Assembly Strikes Principals From Resolution
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (UPH - The world's lop neutralist
powers early today withdrew their call for renewed contacts be
tween President Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khru
shchev after the General Assembly knocked out any reference to
the two leaders.
On a motion by Argentina to strike from the neutralist resolu-

tion the words "President" of the
United States and "Chairman of
the Council of Ministers" of the
Soviet Union, the Assembly re
turned a 40 to 37 vote to retain
them.
But Assembly President Fred
erick H. Boland ruled that a two
thirds vote was required to retain
the disputed words. Indian De
fense Minister V. K. Krishna
Menon challenged Boland's rul
ing but the Assembly upheld its
President by a 40 to 37 vote.
Secretary of State Christian A.
Herter took the rostrum to sup
port the Argentine delegation
move. He argued that the Assem
bly could not call for a meeting
of specific principals who "are
here today and gone tomorrow."
THE MAJORITY of the Assem
bly supported the State Depart
ment's position that the United
Nations could not pin down any
specific person, in this instance
President Eisenhower, to do a
specific thing.
With the Argentine move suc
cessfully carried, the resolution
proposed by India's Jawaharlal
Nehru, Indonesia's Sukarno. Yu
goslavia's Tito, the United Arab
Republic's Gamal Abdel Nasser
and Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah
was left reading that the Assem
bly:
"Expresses the hope that, as a
first urgent step, the United
States of America and the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics re
new their contacts interrupted re
cently, so that their declared will
ingness to find solutions of the
outstanding problems by negotia
tion may be progressively imple
mented."
NEHRU TOLl) the Assembly
the change had robbed the resolu
tion of its sense and taken the
tone of urgency away from it. He
asked permission, on behalf of
the sponsors, to withdraw it. The
Assembly agreed.
Nkrumah said an Eisenhower-
Khrushchev meeting "would at
least break the ice and possibly
pave the way for a summit meet
ing."
"The important thing," he said,
"is that the two heads of govern
ment would have met and broken
the ice."
PRESIDENT Kwame Nkrumah
of Ghana told the Assembly:
"Whether we like it or not, the
key to war and peace is in the
hand of the governments of the
U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. But then
the balance of world moral
strength lies within these very
walls of this great Assembly.
"For the sake of the peace of
the world, let the heads «>f the
United States and the Soviet
Union come together. It does not
matter where. It may lip in the
center of the Atlantic or in the
middle of the Baltic Sea. Human
ity demands that every effort be
made to avoid war."
