# TO FEATURE PRESIDENT'S TALK
## Stanford Today and Tomorrow Selects Crew, Forms Plans 
### 
Because of its success in past years, the Stanford Today and
Tomorrow program is being repeated this year*.
This program, which has grown from students' questions con
cerning Stanford and its policies, is carried out to acquaint the
student body with the organization of the University.
Named to the 1960 ST&T committee to assist Chairman Bob

Sayler are Carrie Coman, Floss
Haines, Joy Howard. Judy Jen
nings, Tina Rodi, Martha Sweeney
Margot Woolfolk, Bill Butler,
flank Dahlberk, Tom Gompertz,
John Herrington, Gregg Hopkins
and Bob McGuffin.
The main objectives of the
ST&T program are to give the
students an opportunity to hear
and to know key academic and
administrative personnel in the
informal atmosphere of the liv
ing groups, and to give the stu
dent an opportunity to ask ques
tions, the answers to which are
not easily obtainable in published
form or by inquiry at accessible
offices.
THE HIGHLIGHT of this year's
program will be the annual stu
dent body address by Dr. Ster
ling. Three evenings of informal
living group discussions con
ducted by top faculty personnel,
will follow the President's speech.
Those sessions will round out
ST&T week, which is set for the
second week in January.
"An extensive spring quarter
program is now being formu
lated," reports Chairman Sayler.
"With the continued support of
the student body, ST&T will be
able to expand its scope some
what this year."
