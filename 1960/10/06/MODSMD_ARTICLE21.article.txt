## 
### 
Organization changes in the sci
ence faculty have resulted in the
addition of two departments to
the School of Engineering, it was
announced today by University
Provost Frederick E. Terman.
The new Department of Mate
rials Scicnce was formerly the De
partment of Metallurgical Engi
neering in the School of Mineral
Sciences.
The Department of Chemical
Engineering was a division of the
Chemistry Department.
Professor O. Cutler Shepard,
head of the Department of Mate
rials Science, says of the change:
"The evolving of this department
has brought us from the days
when we were linked to the
West's mining industry. Now, we
move again to answer more fully
today's challenge â€” the develop
ment of new and improved basic
materials."
Plans for the future in Chem
ical Engineering include faculty
expansion and curriculum addi
tions, said Professor David M.
Mason, executive head of the de
partment.
