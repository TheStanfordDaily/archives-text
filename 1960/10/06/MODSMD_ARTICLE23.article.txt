# Scratch Sheet to Hold Meeting, Needs Workers
## 
### 
r
The Scratch Sheet, an ASSU
published student evaluation of
courses, will hold an organiza
tional meeting today at 4:00 in
the lower lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse.
First published four years ago
by an independent group of stu
dents who thought there was a
need for a regular statement of
student opinion about classes and
courses, the Scratch Sheet, under
the leadership of former editor
Stan Johnson, last year became a
non-profit publication under the
auspices of the ASSU.
PUBLISHED three times a
year, the Scratch Sheet will sell
for twenty cents at the beginning
of each quarter. The mechanics
of gathering the information for

! the booklet will be different this !
year. Booths will be set up in the !
; center of the campus for students
to collect questionnaires. These
questionnaires will provide space
for the student's opinion of one
I of the courses he has taken.
THE CO-EDITORS, Larry Pry
or and Arvin Brown, have stressed ;
the need for a better-rounded I
staff. Staff members foi* past
issues have been predominantly I
! majors in the Humanities and the
j Social Sciences, and a scientific
and mathematical viewpoint of
courses and classes has been miss
ing. For this reason, pre-engineer
ing students and future scientists
J and mathematicians are especially
I invited to work on the Scratch
Sheet.
