# Cards Prepare for Huskies
## 
### KEN DERY 
Tin: STAN FORI) Indians take
the field against powerful Wash
ington in the Stanford stadium
Saturday and the situation is
somewhat reminiscent of last sea
son's encounter with USC.
That game with the Trojans
was the sixth of the year and
Stanford had won only one con
test up to that time., USC was
the class of the west, hut Cactus
Jack Curtis' boys rose to the occa
sion and almost pulled off the
whole tiling, finally bowing 30-28.
A capacity crowd will be there
Saturday to see if the Cards can
duplicate their feat.
I.FADING the Indians if they
are to have a chance at all must
be quarterback Dick Norman. As
seen in Sports Editor Ron Rapo
port's column, this tremendous
passer can turn the tide in any
game.
Willi the graduation of fine
ends Ben Robinson and Chris Bur
ford, the pass receiving depart
ment has been a bit on the erratic
side, but last week fullback Skip
Face proved that he is to lie reck
oned with and senior* Dale Ostra
ner has been a pretty good tar
get in Stanford's three losing tilts.
Dale is short on experience, but
has fine hands and runs the pat
terns well.
FACK, the "Back of the Week"
in I he AAWU last week, was mag
nificent against the Air Force,
carrying 11 times for 157 yards,
returning three kick-offs for 89
and returning one punt for 14
yards.
Mac Wylie, a workhorse of the
backfield last season, is ready to
go alter being Limited to offense
in last week's game by a healing
foot injury. The stocky ((5-0, 190t
halfback, along with Face, just
might keep the Huskie defense
honest if the line can hold.
Last week coach Curtis tried
platooning his linemen and the
team seemed to hold up better!
in the second half. The same sys- j
tem will be employed against
Washington and if the Cards don't j
outlast the Huskies, they will at
least keep them alert looking at
all the different faces.
OXi: OF the bright hopes in I
the line is right tackle C. B. Sim
ons. Filling in for injured co-cap
tain Dean Hinshaw, the fi-1 22b-1
pound Si m on s did a fine job !
against the Air Force and drew j
praise from his coaches. C. B. is j
physically the best of the boys
up from the l'rosh team. He has j
all the necessary attributes to be i
a fine tackle size, speed and '
quickness. I lis effective pursuit j

and strong line charge have also
played a major part in his fast
development.
Ron Fernandes is another of the
Card linemen who could play a
big part in this one. A senior, Ron
is Stanford's most experienced
guard.
Coach Curtis is hoping that the
other Card linemen will really
come up with that outstanding
game that would give Stanford
a chance.
