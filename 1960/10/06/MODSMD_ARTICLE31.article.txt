FRUSTRATION DEPARTMENT: During every Stanford fool
ball game at home and away there are always at least two photog
raphers taking movies. One of these is Dick Keeble, the operator of
a photography studio in Palo Alto, who takes pictures for the poach
ing staff to look over during the following week.
The other is usually somebody hired to take pictures for alumni
gatherings and for use on a Sunday night television show which

features half an hour of Stanford
films and half an hour of Cal
films. (The audience rating of the
show has been pretty low so far
this year.r
During the Stanford-Washing
ton State game in Spokane a few
weeks ago a fellow was hired to
take the movies for television and
the alumni. He had a little trou
ble. Keeble, who had come along
to take his usual pictures for the
coaches, tells the story:
"This poor guy drives all the
way across the state from Seattle
to take the pictures. lie brings a
$4,000 outfit, the kind I intend
to have some day. Anyhow, he
sets up all his equipment next to
me and then gives out with, 'OH
DAMN.'
" 'What's the matter?' says I.
"'I forgot the motor,' says he.
'You can't wind this camera with-

out a motor. I'm going into Spokane lo borrow another camera from
a friend."
"So off lie goes into Spokane to get another camera. I don't mess
around with motors. I always wind by hand, hut iiis camera is so
expensive that you've got to haw a motor.
Just the Half of It
"Well, Ihc game starts and I forget about him and start taking
my pictures. He comes back during halftime and starts setting up
for the second half. Then I hear him say, 'OH MY GOD.'
" 'What's the matter?' says I.
"'No film,' says he. 'And the film I've got for my new camera
won't fit.'
"Well, I always carry some extra film, so I lend him some, but
the lens he's got isn't big enough so he ends up with nothing. The
poor guy was almost crying."
What happened to the waiting television show and the alums?
Well, the Sunday viewers were treated to a whole hour of Cal get
ting beat by Tulane, with the explanation that the films were "lost
in transit." And the alums were sent a screening of the 1957 Big
Game. It was the last one that Stanford had won.
And Now for Mr. Norman
STATISTIC S DEPARTMENT (RECORD DIVISION): In t lie
history of college football there have been only six players who have
completed over 300 forward passes in their careers. At the end of
this year there should be two more, the Air Force's Rich Mayo and
Stanford's Dick Norman.
The big six are Don Klosterman of Loyola of Los Angeles with
368, Zeke Bratowski of Georgia with 360. Don Heinrich of Washing
ton with 335, Babe Parelli of Kentucky with 331, Ken Ford of Hardin-
Simmons with 315, and Chuck Maloy of Holy Cross with 304.
At the beginning of the current season Norman had completed
228 passes. 158 of these completions had been made during the 1959
seasonâ€”a Stanford record which means that if Norman has as
good a year this year as he did last year, he will break Klosterman's
all-time record by 20.
So far this year he has completed .'*o passes, bringing his total
up to 258 overall. Norman thus needs 111 passes to beat Klosterman,
which averages out to just under 16 completions per game, just about
his last season's average.
Admittedly, going by his present rate, it doesn't look like he'll
make it. but this is what Dick Norman probably WILL do this year:
1. Join the "300" club. He only needs 42.
2. Set the all-time Stanford passing record, John Brodie now
holds it with 296.
3. Set the Stanford passing yardage record. Brodie holds that
one too, with 3,594 yards, while Norman now has 2,964, leaving him
with 630 yet to get, 90 per game.
If Norman starts throwing passes that Margaret Mead couldn't
drop, Klosterman had better watch out, but as it is now Dick's nitcli
in the Farm record book seems secure.
