## 
### 
STANFORD may ho winless in
1 lneo outings and slated to drop
No. 4 to powerful Washington at
Palo Alto Saturday, hut the Indi
ans are second to none in Big
Five individual statistics.
Skip Face, Indian back, leads
in rushing with 244 yards in 26
carries for a 9.4 yards per carry
average; quarterback Dick Nor
man leads in passing completions
with 30 out t>f 63 for 284 yards;
Face is tops in pass receiving with
13 for 123 yards; and Gary Craig
leads in punting with 44.3 yards
per kick average.
Otherwise, Bill Kilmer of UCLA,
although only playing two games,
leads iti total offense with 429

yards in 64 plays; and Charley
Mitchell of Washington is the trip
scorer with 18 points on a trio
of touchdowns.
ON TFAM totals, Washington
leads in total offense (370 yards
per game); rushing offense (257
yards); and rushing defense (47);
and UCLA is tops in passing of

An interesting thing about
Washington is that while the Hus
kies seem to be best team on the
West Coast, the thing that held
them back against Navy last week
was their pass defense, which had
been so strong in the past.
