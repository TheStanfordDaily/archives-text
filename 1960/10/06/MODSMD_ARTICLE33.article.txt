# Bucs Rally Wins First Series Game
## 
### OSCAR FRALEY 
PITTSBURGH (UPI> The battling Pittsburgh Pirates ended
33 years of baseball ignominy yesterday when chunky little Elroy
Face's last-ditch relief pitching swept them to a (5-4 victory over the
favored New York Yankees in the opening game of the World Series.
The hit-and-run Bucs hadn't won a series game since beating

Washington in 192.1 and had been
•slaughtered four in a row by
these same Yankees the last time
they were in the classic 'way
back in 1927.
BUT yesterday, before a roaring
ly partisan crowd of 36,676 at sun
swept Forbes Field, they spotted
their long-ago conquerors a first
inning lead on hawkfaced Roger
Maris' solo home run and then
pecked their way back to an upset
triumph despite, a late Yankee
rally on Elston Howard's two-run
homer.
They were a battling band of
hungry heroes and there were
enough laurels to go all the way
around:
To Vernon (Deacon) Law, the
Mormon minister who kept them
up front for seven innings; to
Face, little reliefer who came on
to choke off a late Yankee rally
by cutting down the heart of the
Yankee batting order; to Bill Ma
zeroski, whose two-run homer in
the fourth was the Hue's biggest
blow, and to National League bat
ting champion Dick Groat, whose
ice-breaking double pulled them
even and gave them the heart for
victory.
BUT IT was Facc. the five-foot,
eight-inch mighty mite of the Buc
caneer mound corps, who came on
as he had 68 times this season in
relief to save it for them when the
burly Yankees threatened to pull
il out of the fire.
That was in the eighth inning
when the tiring Law gave up
back-to-back singles to Hector
Lopez and the menacing Maris.
There were none away and as the
shadows lengthened on the rock
hard infield the long-jawed Law
took that long walk to the showers
and the bantam Face moved in.
He got them out of that im
mediate spot to save the decision
for Law and pin the defeat on
lanky Art Ditmar by curling a
third called strike past the mighty
Mickey Mantle, getting the always
dangerous Yogi Berra on a fly
ball and then striking out the
burly Moose Skowron.
IT WAS to get rougher for him.
Because in the ninth, lean Gil
McDougald greeted him with a
single to right center and then,
after Bobby Richardson forced
McDougald, Howard hoisted a
pinch hit homer into the right
field stands. That closed the gap
to 6 to 4 and the crowd moaned
when Tony Kubeck followed right
up with a single. But that's when
Face tightened up again. He
served a double play ball to Lope/,
and had ended their long drought.
IT LOOKED bad for those Pi
rates in the beginning because in
the first inning, with two away.
Maris laced that leading home run
into the upper right field stands
and it brought back memories of
that "L>27 series when the Yan
kees' famed Murderers' Row
crushed the Bucs.
But the battling Bucs weren't
long in getting il back with a
vengeance.
Bill Virdon started them off
with a walk which doomed the

quiet Ditmar. For with Groat, the
National League's hatting cham
pion at the plate, Virdon stole sec
ond base.
GROAT followed by slashing a
double down the right field line
which scored Virdon and Bob
Skinner came through with a
single to center which scored the
balding Groat. Ditmar got Dick
Stuart but, with Roberto Cle
mente up, the Bucs were running
again. Skinner stole second stand
ing up as Yogi Beria's peg was
high and Kubek had to make a
fine backup play to keep the ball
from going into center field again.
Clemente then slashed a clean
single to center to send Skinner
scampering home with the third
Pittsburgh run.
The Pirates were on the move
then and were not to be denied.

GROAT followed by slashing a
double down the right field line
which scored Virdon and Bob
Skinner came through with a

balding Groat. Ditmar got Dick

PITTSBURGH (UPI> The battling Pittsburgh Pirates ended
33 years of baseball ignominy yesterday when chunky little Elroy
Face's last-ditch relief pitching swept them to a (5-4 victory over the
favored New York Yankees in the opening game of the World Series.
The hit-and-run Bucs hadn't won a series game since beating

Washington in 192.1 and had been
•slaughtered four in a row by
these same Yankees the last time
they were in the classic 'way
back in 1927.
BUT yesterday, before a roaring
ly partisan crowd of 36,676 at sun
swept Forbes Field, they spotted
their long-ago conquerors a first
inning lead on hawkfaced Roger
Maris' solo home run and then
pecked their way back to an upset
triumph despite, a late Yankee
rally on Elston Howard's two-run
homer.
They were a battling band of
hungry heroes and there were
enough laurels to go all the way
around:
To Vernon (Deacon) Law, the
Mormon minister who kept them
up front for seven innings; to
Face, little reliefer who came on
to choke off a late Yankee rally
by cutting down the heart of the
Yankee batting order; to Bill Ma
zeroski, whose two-run homer in
the fourth was the Hue's biggest
blow, and to National League bat
ting champion Dick Groat, whose
ice-breaking double pulled them
even and gave them the heart for
victory.
BUT IT was Facc. the five-foot,
eight-inch mighty mite of the Buc
caneer mound corps, who came on
as he had 68 times this season in
relief to save it for them when the
burly Yankees threatened to pull
il out of the fire.
That was in the eighth inning
when the tiring Law gave up
back-to-back singles to Hector
Lopez and the menacing Maris.
There were none away and as the
shadows lengthened on the rock
hard infield the long-jawed Law
took that long walk to the showers
and the bantam Face moved in.
He got them out of that im
mediate spot to save the decision
for Law and pin the defeat on
lanky Art Ditmar by curling a
third called strike past the mighty
Mickey Mantle, getting the always
dangerous Yogi Berra on a fly
ball and then striking out the
burly Moose Skowron.
IT WAS to get rougher for him.
Because in the ninth, lean Gil
McDougald greeted him with a
single to right center and then,
after Bobby Richardson forced
McDougald, Howard hoisted a
pinch hit homer into the right
field stands. That closed the gap
to 6 to 4 and the crowd moaned
when Tony Kubeck followed right
up with a single. But that's when
Face tightened up again. He
served a double play ball to Lope/,
and had ended their long drought.

when the tiring Law gave up
back-to-back singles to Hector
Lopez and the menacing Maris.
There were none away and as the
shadows lengthened on the rock
hard infield the long-jawed Law
took that long walk to the showers
and the bantam Face moved in.
He got them out of that im
mediate spot to save the decision
for Law and pin the defeat on
lanky Art Ditmar by curling a
third called strike past the mighty
Mickey Mantle, getting the always
dangerous Yogi Berra on a fly
ball and then striking out the
burly Moose Skowron.
IT WAS to get rougher for him.
Because in the ninth, lean Gil
McDougald greeted him with a
single to right center and then,
after Bobby Richardson forced
McDougald, Howard hoisted a
pinch hit homer into the right
field stands. That closed the gap
to 6 to 4 and the crowd moaned
when Tony Kubeck followed right
up with a single. But that's when
Face tightened up again. He
served a double play ball to Lope/,
and had ended their long drought.
IT LOOKED bad for those Pi
rates in the beginning because in
the first inning, with two away.
Maris laced that leading home run
into the upper right field stands
and it brought back memories of
that "L>27 series when the Yan
kees' famed Murderers' Row
crushed the Bucs.
But the battling Bucs weren't
long in getting il back with a
vengeance.
Bill Virdon started them off
with a walk which doomed the

quiet Ditmar. For with Groat, the
National League's hatting cham
pion at the plate, Virdon stole sec
ond base.
GROAT followed by slashing a
double down the right field line
which scored Virdon and Bob
Skinner came through with a
single to center which scored the
balding Groat. Ditmar got Dick
Stuart but, with Roberto Cle
mente up, the Bucs were running
again. Skinner stole second stand
ing up as Yogi Beria's peg was
high and Kubek had to make a
fine backup play to keep the ball
from going into center field again.
Clemente then slashed a clean
single to center to send Skinner
scampering home with the third
Pittsburgh run.
The Pirates were on the move
then and were not to be denied.
PITTSBURGH (UPI> The battling Pittsburgh Pirates ended
33 years of baseball ignominy yesterday when chunky little Elroy
Face's last-ditch relief pitching swept them to a (5-4 victory over the
favored New York Yankees in the opening game of the World Series.
The hit-and-run Bucs hadn't won a series game since beating

Washington in 192.1 and had been
•slaughtered four in a row by
these same Yankees the last time
they were in the classic 'way
back in 1927.
BUT yesterday, before a roaring
ly partisan crowd of 36,676 at sun
swept Forbes Field, they spotted
their long-ago conquerors a first
inning lead on hawkfaced Roger
Maris' solo home run and then
pecked their way back to an upset
triumph despite, a late Yankee
rally on Elston Howard's two-run
homer.
They were a battling band of
hungry heroes and there were
enough laurels to go all the way
around:
To Vernon (Deacon) Law, the
Mormon minister who kept them
up front for seven innings; to
Face, little reliefer who came on
to choke off a late Yankee rally
by cutting down the heart of the
Yankee batting order; to Bill Ma
zeroski, whose two-run homer in
the fourth was the Hue's biggest
blow, and to National League bat
ting champion Dick Groat, whose
ice-breaking double pulled them
even and gave them the heart for
victory.
BUT IT was Facc. the five-foot,
eight-inch mighty mite of the Buc
caneer mound corps, who came on
as he had 68 times this season in
relief to save it for them when the
burly Yankees threatened to pull
il out of the fire.
