THE PLEDGE YOU SAVE
MAY BE YOUR OWN
Today's column is directed at those young female under
graduates who have recently pledged sororities and are wor
ried, poor lambs, that they won't make good. Following is a
list of simple instructions which, if faithfully observed, will
positively guarantee that you will be a mad success as a
sorority girl.
First,, let us take up the matter of housemothers. The
housemother is your friend, your guide, your mentor. You
must treat her with respect. When you wish to speak to her,
address her as "Mother Kigafoos" or "Ma'am.'.' In no circum
stances must you say, ''Hey, fat lady."
Second, let us discuss laundry. Never hang your wash on
the front porch of the sorority house. This is un>ightly and
shows a want of breeding. I'se the Chapter Koom.
Third, meals. Always remember that planning and preparing
meals for a houseful of healthy girls is no simple task. Your
cook goes to a great deal of trouble to make your menu varied
and nourishing. The least you can do is show your apprecia
tion. Don't just devour your food: praise it. Exclaim with
delight, "\\ hat delicious pork jowls!'' or "What a yummy soup
bone!" or "What scrumptious fish heads!" or "What clear
water!"
Fourth, clothing. Never forget that your appearance re
flects not just on yourself but on the whole house. It was
well enough before you joined a sorority to lounge around
campus in your old middy blouse and gym bloomers, but now
you must take great pains to dress in a manner which excites
admiring comments from all who observe you. A few years ago,
for example, there was a Chi Omega named Camille Ataturk
at the Fniversity of lowa who brought gobs of glory to all her
sorors. Camille hit on the ingenious notion of suiting her garb
to the class she was attending. For instance, to English Lit she
wore a buskin and jerkin. To German she wore lederhosen and
carried a stein of pilsener. To Econ she wore 12(1 yards of
ticker tape. Her shiningest hour came one day when she
dressed as a white mouse for Psvch Lab. Not only her Chi
Omega sisters, but the entire student body went into deep
mourning when she was killed by the janitor's cat.

Finally, let us take up the most important topic of all. I
refer, of course, 1o dating.
As we have seen, the way you dress reflects on your sorority,
but the men you date reflect even more. He absolutely certain
that your date is an acceptable fellow. Don't beat about the
bush; ask him point-blank,' "Are you an acceptable fellow?"
I'nless he replies, "Yeah, hey," send him packing.
But don't just take his word that lie is acceptable. Inspect,
him closely. Are his fingernails clean? Is his black leather
jacket freshly oiled? Is his ukelele in tune? Does he carry
public liability insurance? And, most significant of all. does
he smoke Marlboros?
If lie's a Marlboro man, you know he has taste and discern
ment, wit and wisdom, character and sapience, decency and
warmth, presence and poise, talent and grit, filter and flavor,
soft pack and flip-top box. You will be proud of him, your
sorority will he proucl of him, the makers of Marihoro will be
proud of him, and I will be paid for this column.

The makers of Marlboro, having paid for this column, would
like to mention another of their fine cigarettes—mild, tin
filteredPhilip Morris —available in regular size or the sensa
tional new king-size Commander. Have a Commander—
