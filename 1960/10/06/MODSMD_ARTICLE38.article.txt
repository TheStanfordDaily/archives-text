# Very unusual
## 
### 
One of many unusual projects at the
Lawrence Radiation Laboratory â€” the only
national laboratory active in virtually all
phases of the atomic energy program.
OX OCTOBER 20
Lawrence Radiation Laboratory stafT members
will be on campus to answer your questions
about a career in nuclear research.
They will interview outstanding:
chemists electronic engineers
physicists mechanical engineers
metallurgists ceramic engineers
mathematicians chemical engineers

Tory TIA is the first of a series of test reactors
being developer! under the Lawrence Radiation
Laboratory's nuclear Ramjet program.
A reactor for ramjet propulsion must operate
at high power levels yet be of minimum size
and mass, Its design must consider the very high
pressure drop across its length, the stress loads
due to flight maneuvering, and the extremely

high radiation fiux level which itself leads to
severe heat transfer and radiation damage prob
lems. Because the operating temperature exceeds
that at which most conventional structural ma
terials fail, the core itself consists of bundled
tubes of sintered uranium and beryllium oxide
fabricated with central holes for continuous air
passage.
