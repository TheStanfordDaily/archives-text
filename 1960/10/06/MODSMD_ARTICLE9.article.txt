## 
### 
NEW YORK (UPI) Prime
! Minister Harold Macmillan left
; for Britain yesterday urging the
j free world to work quietly to
; ward peace and never surrender
its principles of freedom.
The Prime Minister did not
bring Khrushchev and Eisen
hower together but in a brief ex
! temporaneous statement just be
' fore his departure called on all
; nations to continue to negotiate
! with one another.
"I GO BACK inspired by the
; renewal of great friendships." he
said. "In spite of all the difficul
, ties and tasks before us, I am still
[ hopeful that as each year goes
by. we may gradually make prog
ress towards a more peaceful
state of the world.
"I would not now want to say
anything about the great issues
being debated before the Assem
bly," he said. "I tried to make my
contribution in a speech a few
days ago.
"There are, of course, moments
in the history of the world where
the confusion, doubts and ani
mosities make us a little uncer
tain and doubtful of the future.
But on the other hand, there cer
tainly was a thrill in seeing 100
nations gathered together to do
their best through debate and dis
cussion.
"IT WILE be a long time, and
it will not be easy for us to reach
some settlement of our problems.
But we must not be either foolish
optimists or too much of a pessi
mist. We must work quietly and
never surrender the principles of
freedom for which we stand. We
must always be ready to negoti
ate arrangements for a better
way in which to live together in
the world."
