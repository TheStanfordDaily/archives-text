# A 						Nonpartisan Cheer

In the past, Stanford lias been blessed witli many great speak
ers and speeches. Another one must now be added to that list;
tlie speech given by Representative Chester Bowles Wednesday
afternoon.
This commendation is not a matter of partisanship. Stanford
Democrats and Republicans alike seem to agree that Bowles"
speech was illuminating, exciting and educational. \\ bat is even
more amazing, Bowles spoke without the assistance of a text. But
lie didn't need one. A man who truly believe* in what be says
has no use for prepared statements.
Bowles did not come here to praise Kennedy or lo bury Nixon.
He came here to tell us that regardless of politica I affiliation the
future of the world largely rests on our shoulders. He came here
to tell us that we must not "stand on the sidelines, whether we
be politicians or businessmen.
He told us clearly and succinctly how communism can be de
feated. All we have lo do is follow the principles and ideals formu
lated in the Constitution, to follow tbe beliefs of Thomas Jefferson
and Abraham Lincoln.
All we have to realize is that people our age all over the world
are just like us. All they want is freedom and justice and this, not
arms and goods, is what we must give them.
We must once again find a sense of purpose, Bowles says. We
must not only do good things out of fear of communism. \\ e
must do them out of love for democracy.
To sum it up rather brashly: \\ E HAVE TO 01\E A DAMN!
Bowles has been Ambassador to India and has traveled exten
sively throughout the world. He has seen enslaved people, almost
enslaved people and people who are struggling to remain free.
The point he reiterated is that Americans do not understand what
these people want and that if we don't soon discover what they
want we may lose them entirely.
Many Republicans in the audience must have felt a little un
easy as they listened to Bowles analyze weaknesses in the Republi
can administration. They couldn't chuckle or say. "Oh, he's just
biased" because you somehow sense that Bowles is pointing out
these weaknesses not to further the cause of the Democratic Party,
but to further the cause of democracy. This man is a statesman,
not a politician. He was here representing America, not one of
America's parties.
If Kennedy wins the election Bowles will probably be Secre
tary of State or Ambassador to the United Nations. He would be
a great asset in either position. If Nixon wins, we hope that he
has enough foresight to assign Bowles some position where he
will not be wasted. America has already wasted 100 many great
Americans. ,
