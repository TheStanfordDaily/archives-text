### MICHAEL GORDON IIR Political Analyst 
The Goldwater foreign policy
analyzes the value of such meas
ures as foreign aid. disarmament,
the United Nations, defensive al
liances and exchange programs.
His analysis concludes that so far
as America is concerned, they all
have been of little use. And what
in conservative realism is of lit
tle use must be realistically jet
tisoned.
His arguments for doing this
are hardly unimpeachable. Con
sider his objections—three in all
—to foreign aid. First of all it
is unconstitutional (though, curi
ously enough, almost everything
Mr. Goldwater opposes in foreign
and domestic policy is likewise
unconstitutional).
Next, it is doubtful if American
aid prevented Western Europe
from going Communist after the
Second World War; in fact it is
doubtful if that aid even helped
this area recover much. To prove
this, he cites the example of West
Germany, which recovered eco
nomically faster than France or
Italy, though receiving little
American aid.
But this simply is not true.
West Germany received consider
able aid: directly from aid plans,
indirectly through military sup
port that bolstered its economy.
Finally, just as a poor man who
receives economic aid from his
fellows is that much less spiritu
ally rich, so impoverished coun
tries that receive American aid
are turning socialistic because of
greediness, and thus will lose
their freedom. Rut the question
may be asked, just what does
freedom mean to starving people
in an impoverished land? In fact,
it means nothing; it is an abstrac
tion neither good nor bad but
meaningless.
Throughout his entire thesis on
foreign policy, Mr. Goldwater no
whet.' considers the differences
evidenced in Soviet policy since
the Stalin era. To him, a Com
munist is a Communist and a
Communist policy only a Com
munist policy. But in truth, that
policy has changed, and no matter
how difficult it still is to face the
Soviet leaders at the negotiating
table, it is much more difficult to
face the prospects of a war be
cau.se of the refusal on the West

era side to take Into account any
change on the Soviet side.
What is really striking about all
his conservative realism, however,
is the failure of Mr. Goldwater 1o
consider the real defects of re
cent American foreign policy. The
Soviet gains in Cuba, for instance,
resulted not from more Soviet
missiles, but from the appearance
it was able to give the new Cuban
leaders of wanting to aid them
economically and technically with
out first trying to convert them
to Communism. That is the se
cret. of the Communist's approach
and the secret of their gain there.
Until American policy utilizes
a similarly imaginative approach
in many problems of foreign
policy—as it seems to have done
in the Congo—it shall continue to
find itself less and less applicable
to the reality of events, and more
and more dazzled by Soviet gains.
I?i the end, one wonders, after
all, just how realistic Senator
Goldwater's realism in foreign
policy is. In a recent speech of
iiis, for instance, he was agitating
for a possible armed intervention
by America in Cuba —thus furn
ishing proof to what was other
wise Castro's empty gibes at the
same time in tin* United Nations
that certain warmongers in the
American government wanted to
invade his island. If such gauche
agitation is really evidence of dip
lomatic acumen, then perhaps
Barry Goldwater is .justified in
representing his conservative ap
proach to foreign policy as the
realistic one.

lomatic acumen, then perhaps
Barry Goldwater is .justified in
representing his conservative ap
proach to foreign policy as the
realistic one.
The Goldwater foreign policy
analyzes the value of such meas
ures as foreign aid. disarmament,
the United Nations, defensive al
liances and exchange programs.
His analysis concludes that so far
as America is concerned, they all
have been of little use. And what
in conservative realism is of lit
tle use must be realistically jet
tisoned.
His arguments for doing this
are hardly unimpeachable. Con
sider his objections—three in all
—to foreign aid. First of all it
is unconstitutional (though, curi
ously enough, almost everything
Mr. Goldwater opposes in foreign
and domestic policy is likewise
unconstitutional).
Next, it is doubtful if American
aid prevented Western Europe
from going Communist after the
Second World War; in fact it is
doubtful if that aid even helped
this area recover much. To prove
this, he cites the example of West
Germany, which recovered eco
nomically faster than France or
Italy, though receiving little
American aid.
But this simply is not true.
West Germany received consider
able aid: directly from aid plans,
indirectly through military sup
port that bolstered its economy.
Finally, just as a poor man who
receives economic aid from his
fellows is that much less spiritu
ally rich, so impoverished coun
tries that receive American aid
are turning socialistic because of
greediness, and thus will lose
their freedom. Rut the question
may be asked, just what does
freedom mean to starving people
in an impoverished land? In fact,
it means nothing; it is an abstrac
tion neither good nor bad but
meaningless.
Throughout his entire thesis on
foreign policy, Mr. Goldwater no
whet.' considers the differences
evidenced in Soviet policy since
the Stalin era. To him, a Com
munist is a Communist and a
Communist policy only a Com
munist policy. But in truth, that
policy has changed, and no matter
how difficult it still is to face the
Soviet leaders at the negotiating
table, it is much more difficult to
face the prospects of a war be
cau.se of the refusal on the West

era side to take Into account any
change on the Soviet side.
What is really striking about all
his conservative realism, however,
is the failure of Mr. Goldwater 1o
consider the real defects of re
cent American foreign policy. The
Soviet gains in Cuba, for instance,
resulted not from more Soviet
missiles, but from the appearance
it was able to give the new Cuban
leaders of wanting to aid them
economically and technically with
out first trying to convert them
to Communism. That is the se
cret. of the Communist's approach
and the secret of their gain there.
Until American policy utilizes
a similarly imaginative approach
in many problems of foreign
policy—as it seems to have done
in the Congo—it shall continue to
find itself less and less applicable
to the reality of events, and more
and more dazzled by Soviet gains.
I?i the end, one wonders, after
all, just how realistic Senator
Goldwater's realism in foreign
policy is. In a recent speech of
iiis, for instance, he was agitating
for a possible armed intervention
by America in Cuba —thus furn
ishing proof to what was other
wise Castro's empty gibes at the
same time in tin* United Nations
that certain warmongers in the
American government wanted to
invade his island. If such gauche
agitation is really evidence of dip
