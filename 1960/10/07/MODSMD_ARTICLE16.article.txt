## Gateways and Debate 
### 
Instead of competing with the
Nixon-Kennedy debate tonight,
the Gateway Singers will compli
ment the TV program when thoy
and the debate appear at the
Loft Theater in Palo Alto.
To enable Gateway fans to see
both events, the Loft is planning
to install a television set In the
theater. Thus, the singers will
sing and the debaters will . . . well
. . . debate.
While some speculate (hat Ken
nedy will emerge victorious, sonic
| Nixon, and others, neither, I'm
betting on the Gateway Singers.
| While some tear the debate will
be colorless, the Loft's color tele-
I vision set promises otherwise.
Perhaps now puzzled voters can
choose on the basis of whether or
not Nixon's tie harmonizes with
his suit —or if Kennedy's socks
are conservative enough.
After the hour-long debate, the
Gateway Singers will go on at
9 p.m. They will also sing twice
tomorrow, at 8 and 10:30 p.m.,
and on Sunday, at 3 and 8:30 p.m.
The performances have been
scheduled as a benefit to aid
Comedia Repertory Company in
building a new theater. This is
certainly a vital and worthy goal,
Comedia being the only near
professional little theater on the
Peninsula.
Noted for outstanding shows,
musical and dramatjo, the group
is currently housed in an upstairs
theater which seats only 150 per
sons. There is a lack of space
both audience and performance
wise—and a new theater would
do much toward boosting the com
l pany's capabilities.
Tickets for the weekend shows
are priced at $3, with a student
price' of $1.50 for the Sunday
matinee.
The Gateway Singers began
their career together five years
ago and were one of the first folk
singing group to really come into
the public eye.
Jerry Walter, who does the ar
ranging for the quartet, said in

an interview that folk music lias
become so popular in recent years
because "it is the kind of music
willi which people can easily iden
tify. More than any other music,
folk sotiffs can move people —in
ways thai can't l>e identified."
The success stories of the first
folk-singing gro up s prompted
others to enter the field, he con
tinued, and mentioned his group
and the Kingston Trio as the first
trend-setters.
The return to folk music could
bo listed as a "revolt against
music which is moving away from
people such as certain aspects
of modern jazz," Walter said.
"And folk music has no such dif
ficulty."
Walter is a devotee of Stani
slavski's "Method," and explained
that it provides "avenues of ap
proach to a dramatic role or
any performance in the enter
tainment field."
The Gateway Singers first per
formed at the Hungry i in San
Francisco —ami became such a
drawing-card that they stayed
there for two years. Their per
formances at the Loft, located on
Kmerson at Hamilton St., in Palo
Alto, will be the last in this area.
Monday they will leave for Van
couver where they will stay for
two weeks, then go to Washington,
Santa Monica and San Diego.
If standing ovations mean any
thing, perhaps Lionel Hampton
jshould be named as another rival
of the two Presidential candi
dates. The applause he received
in Memorial Auditorium last Sat
urday night was comparable to
the receptions given both Nixon
and Kennedy when they visited
the campus last year.
While Saturday's auditorium
was unfortunately only about
half full, those who were there
were completely caught up in the
"swingin' rhythm." In fact, I've
never seen anyone so swingin' as
one enthusiast in the front row
whose rh>.hmic gyrations caused
one of the trumpet players on
stage nearly to lose a note.

Perhaps now puzzled voters can
choose on the basis of whether or

his suit —or if Kennedy's socks
are conservative enough.
After the hour-long debate, the
Gateway Singers will go on at
9 p.m. They will also sing twice
tomorrow, at 8 and 10:30 p.m.,
and on Sunday, at 3 and 8:30 p.m.
The performances have been
scheduled as a benefit to aid
Comedia Repertory Company in
building a new theater. This is
certainly a vital and worthy goal,
Comedia being the only near
professional little theater on the
Peninsula.
Noted for outstanding shows,
musical and dramatjo, the group
is currently housed in an upstairs
theater which seats only 150 per
sons. There is a lack of space
both audience and performance
wise—and a new theater would
do much toward boosting the com
l pany's capabilities.
Tickets for the weekend shows
are priced at $3, with a student
price' of $1.50 for the Sunday
matinee.
The Gateway Singers began
their career together five years
ago and were one of the first folk
singing group to really come into
the public eye.
Jerry Walter, who does the ar
ranging for the quartet, said in

an interview that folk music lias
become so popular in recent years
because "it is the kind of music
willi which people can easily iden
tify. More than any other music,
folk sotiffs can move people —in
ways thai can't l>e identified."
The success stories of the first
folk-singing gro up s prompted
others to enter the field, he con
tinued, and mentioned his group
and the Kingston Trio as the first
trend-setters.
The return to folk music could
bo listed as a "revolt against
music which is moving away from
people such as certain aspects
of modern jazz," Walter said.
"And folk music has no such dif
ficulty."
Walter is a devotee of Stani
slavski's "Method," and explained
that it provides "avenues of ap
proach to a dramatic role or
any performance in the enter
tainment field."
The Gateway Singers first per
formed at the Hungry i in San
Francisco —ami became such a
drawing-card that they stayed
there for two years. Their per
formances at the Loft, located on
Kmerson at Hamilton St., in Palo
Alto, will be the last in this area.
Monday they will leave for Van
couver where they will stay for
two weeks, then go to Washington,
Santa Monica and San Diego.
If standing ovations mean any
thing, perhaps Lionel Hampton
jshould be named as another rival
of the two Presidential candi
dates. The applause he received
in Memorial Auditorium last Sat
urday night was comparable to
the receptions given both Nixon
and Kennedy when they visited
the campus last year.
While Saturday's auditorium
was unfortunately only about
half full, those who were there
were completely caught up in the
"swingin' rhythm." In fact, I've
never seen anyone so swingin' as
one enthusiast in the front row
whose rh>.hmic gyrations caused
one of the trumpet players on
stage nearly to lose a note.
Instead of competing with the
Nixon-Kennedy debate tonight,
the Gateway Singers will compli
ment the TV program when thoy
and the debate appear at the
Loft Theater in Palo Alto.
To enable Gateway fans to see
both events, the Loft is planning
to install a television set In the
theater. Thus, the singers will

Gateway Singers will go on at
9 p.m. They will also sing twice
tomorrow, at 8 and 10:30 p.m.,
and on Sunday, at 3 and 8:30 p.m.
The performances have been
scheduled as a benefit to aid
Comedia Repertory Company in
building a new theater. This is
certainly a vital and worthy goal,
Comedia being the only near
professional little theater on the
Peninsula.
Noted for outstanding shows,
musical and dramatjo, the group
is currently housed in an upstairs
theater which seats only 150 per
sons. There is a lack of space
both audience and performance
wise—and a new theater would
do much toward boosting the com
l pany's capabilities.
Tickets for the weekend shows
are priced at $3, with a student
price' of $1.50 for the Sunday
matinee.
The Gateway Singers began
their career together five years
ago and were one of the first folk
singing group to really come into
the public eye.
Jerry Walter, who does the ar
ranging for the quartet, said in

an interview that folk music lias
become so popular in recent years
because "it is the kind of music
willi which people can easily iden
tify. More than any other music,
folk sotiffs can move people —in
ways thai can't l>e identified."
The success stories of the first
folk-singing gro up s prompted
others to enter the field, he con
tinued, and mentioned his group
and the Kingston Trio as the first
trend-setters.
The return to folk music could
bo listed as a "revolt against
music which is moving away from
people such as certain aspects
of modern jazz," Walter said.
"And folk music has no such dif
ficulty."
Walter is a devotee of Stani
slavski's "Method," and explained
that it provides "avenues of ap
proach to a dramatic role or
any performance in the enter
tainment field."
The Gateway Singers first per
formed at the Hungry i in San
Francisco —ami became such a
drawing-card that they stayed
there for two years. Their per
formances at the Loft, located on
Kmerson at Hamilton St., in Palo
Alto, will be the last in this area.
Monday they will leave for Van
couver where they will stay for
two weeks, then go to Washington,
Santa Monica and San Diego.
If standing ovations mean any
thing, perhaps Lionel Hampton
jshould be named as another rival
of the two Presidential candi
dates. The applause he received
in Memorial Auditorium last Sat
urday night was comparable to
the receptions given both Nixon
and Kennedy when they visited
the campus last year.
While Saturday's auditorium
was unfortunately only about
half full, those who were there
were completely caught up in the
"swingin' rhythm." In fact, I've
never seen anyone so swingin' as
one enthusiast in the front row
whose rh>.hmic gyrations caused
one of the trumpet players on
stage nearly to lose a note.
Instead of competing with the
Nixon-Kennedy debate tonight,
the Gateway Singers will compli
ment the TV program when thoy
and the debate appear at the
Loft Theater in Palo Alto.
To enable Gateway fans to see
both events, the Loft is planning
to install a television set In the
theater. Thus, the singers will
sing and the debaters will . . . well
. . . debate.
While some speculate (hat Ken
nedy will emerge victorious, sonic
| Nixon, and others, neither, I'm
betting on the Gateway Singers.
| While some tear the debate will
be colorless, the Loft's color tele-
I vision set promises otherwise.
Perhaps now puzzled voters can
choose on the basis of whether or
not Nixon's tie harmonizes with
his suit —or if Kennedy's socks
are conservative enough.
