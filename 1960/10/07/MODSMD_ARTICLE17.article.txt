# De Gaulle's Europe of Fatherlands'
## 
### DAN WHITE IIR Political Analyst 
A little more than a month ago,
Charles de Gaulle spoke to the
press. This was only the third
news conference the French Pres
ident has held since his return to
power in 1958, and his audience
in ihe Elysee Palace numbered
650. For many of the newsmen,
however, the interview was a dis
appointing one.
In speaking about a union of
Western European nations, De
Gaulle outlined a scheme which
continental journalists quickly
tabbed a "Europe of fatherlands."
The proposal calls for periodical
meetings of the premiers of the
six Common Market nations at
which policies are to be formu
lated and decisions fastened upon.
An assembly elected from mem
bers of national parliaments
would review the actions of the
ministers. According to De Gaulle,
who referred to the presently
functioning organs of economic
integration among the "six" as
purely technical bodies subordi
nate to national governments, co
operation should be based on the
"reality" of state sovereignty.
That state sovereignity is a re
ality, in the popular mind as well
as for leaders, is little to he
doubted: one need look no fur
ther than our own controversy
over the Connally Amendment.
Jurisdictional powers are not
easily parted with, and De Gaulle's
projection is not inconceivable as
a first step toward political unity
in Western Kurope. Hut from the

tone the General used, it appears
lie considers it as near a final
step. It is this tone, as much as
the plan itself, which caused upset
among De Gaulle's Western al
j lies, who Indieve his unified Eu
rope would be little different from
the old Europe of ententes and
rivalries.
Periodic meetings of premiers
would not have the permanent
character of a separate super
national institution. More impor
tant, the orientation of the parties
would be aligned probably more
upon national interests than would
be the case with an organization
whose members considered prob
lems from a European point of
view and then sought to iron out
the national difficulties which a
general policy might entail. In
short, De Gaulle's pronounce
ments leave the impression that
while he retains power in France,
plans for European unity won't
proceed very far.
Such an impression is rein
forced by the General's negative
attitude toward integration of
NATO forces and by his desire
for a NATO superdirectorate com
posed of the U.S., Britain and
France, which would determine
not only European, but world
policies.
With regard to military inte
gration. De Gaulle doesn't seem
worried by the prospect of a Ger
man national army, a prospect

which makes many Frenchman as
well as Konrad Adenauer uneasy.
As far as a superdirectorate goes,
(he U.S. and Britain are probably
not interested, and smaller NATO
partners fear they would lose
what voice they now possess in
policy making.
This weekend, French Premier
Dcbre and Foreign Minister
Couve de Mnrville journey t«
Bonn for talks concerning De
(iaulle's plans. Some compromise
plan may come out of these dis
cussions. "With an election in the
offing, Adenauer, who has based
his foreign policy on European
union, may l'eel the need for some
result. More likely, the meeting
will lead to more talks, elsewhere
and in the future. After De
Gaulle's news conference, one
10 n g Ii s h spokesman remarked,
"De Gaulle has certainly stirred
up the pot a bit." The direction
of the General's stirring seems t«»
be around in a circle.

A little more than a month ago,
Charles de Gaulle spoke to the
press. This was only the third
news conference the French Pres
ident has held since his return to
power in 1958, and his audience
in ihe Elysee Palace numbered
650. For many of the newsmen,
however, the interview was a dis
appointing one.
In speaking about a union of
Western European nations, De
Gaulle outlined a scheme which
continental journalists quickly
tabbed a "Europe of fatherlands."
The proposal calls for periodical
meetings of the premiers of the
six Common Market nations at
which policies are to be formu
lated and decisions fastened upon.
An assembly elected from mem
bers of national parliaments
would review the actions of the
ministers. According to De Gaulle,
who referred to the presently
functioning organs of economic
integration among the "six" as
purely technical bodies subordi
nate to national governments, co
operation should be based on the
"reality" of state sovereignty.
That state sovereignity is a re
ality, in the popular mind as well
as for leaders, is little to he
doubted: one need look no fur
ther than our own controversy
over the Connally Amendment.
Jurisdictional powers are not
easily parted with, and De Gaulle's
projection is not inconceivable as
a first step toward political unity
in Western Kurope. Hut from the

tone the General used, it appears
lie considers it as near a final
step. It is this tone, as much as
the plan itself, which caused upset
among De Gaulle's Western al
j lies, who Indieve his unified Eu
rope would be little different from
the old Europe of ententes and
rivalries.
Periodic meetings of premiers
would not have the permanent
character of a separate super
national institution. More impor
tant, the orientation of the parties
would be aligned probably more
upon national interests than would
be the case with an organization
whose members considered prob
lems from a European point of
view and then sought to iron out
the national difficulties which a
general policy might entail. In
short, De Gaulle's pronounce
ments leave the impression that
while he retains power in France,
plans for European unity won't
proceed very far.
Such an impression is rein
forced by the General's negative
attitude toward integration of
NATO forces and by his desire
for a NATO superdirectorate com
posed of the U.S., Britain and
France, which would determine
not only European, but world
policies.
With regard to military inte
gration. De Gaulle doesn't seem
worried by the prospect of a Ger
man national army, a prospect

which makes many Frenchman as
well as Konrad Adenauer uneasy.
As far as a superdirectorate goes,

not interested, and smaller NATO
partners fear they would lose
what voice they now possess in
policy making.
