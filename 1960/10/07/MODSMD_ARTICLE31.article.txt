# Indians, Washington to Vie in Stadium Tomorrow
## 
### KEN DERY 
THE STANFORD Indians pJay host to the Washington Huskies
at 1:00 p.m. tomorrow as the student body gets its first look at
Cactus Jack Curtice's men. With the Washington State and Air
Force Academy games not played at Palo Alto, and ihe Wisconsin
lilt held the Saturday before registration, most of the Stanford stu-

back completely and if this second
team starts to develop as the
Husky coaches think that it can,
then no one of the West Coast will
touch Washington during the re
mainder of the campaign.
The other factor which has been
giving Washington trouble has
been its usually strong pass de
fense.
"ONLY ONE team, Oregon,
scored through the air on us last
year, but we've given up four so
far this season," Green declared.
With this apparently vulner
able pass defense, fans at the
stadium tomorrow should really
see a wide-open aerial game with
strong-armed Dick Norman pull
ing out all stops to spring an up
set.
WHILE Norman can toss a
touchdown strike from any place
on the field, one must remember,
however, that it is not the golden
arm of the quarterback alone
that gets the big job of winning
games done. The line must hold
to give him time to sight his re
ceivers downfield and let Ihe ball
go. And just as important in any
passing attack is t lie balance that
must come from the running
game.
| If the running game breaks
I down completely, then no quarter-
J back, no matter how good, can
I get the job doneâ€”for a defense
must be kept "honest." With vir
tually no rushing offense the de
fense can crash linebackers play
after play, who would normally be
drifting laterally to be ready for
a run.
WITH co-captain Dean Hinshaw

dents are making their first jour
ney to the sun-drenched stadium.
Stanford is still after that first
victory, having lost 115-14 to the
Cougars of WSU. 21-7 to a sur
prisingly tough Wisconsin team,
and last Saturday bowing to the
Air Force by a 32-9 count.
THESE WASHINGTON Husk
ies certainly do not appear to be
any easier than they were last
year when they posted a 10-1 rec
ord highlighted by a 44-8 trounc
ing of Big Ten representative
Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl.
Ranked third nationally up
until last week when they were
beaten in the last minute by an
upstart Navy squad, the boys
from Seattle now are ranked as
low as fifteenth in some circles.
With the game being carried
nationally as the television "game
oft he-week" Coach Curtice knows
that his small and slow squad will
have to fight for its life to stay
with the Huskies at all.
GORDON GREEN, the Wash
ington publicist, said that it was
not complacency that upset the;
Huskies.
"Navy was just better than we
were on that day," Green de
clared.
Bob Schloredt, the Huskies' one
eyed quarterback, is playing as
well as he did last year, but be- I
cause Washington had such an j
easy time in two early games
against College of the Pacific and !
Idaho, the first, or Purple, unit :
hadn't seen much action before |
the encounter with Navy.
SO FAR Coach Jim Owens' |
main trouble has come from an I
inexperienced second unit.
Last year's starting outfit is i

and the talented Doug Pursell out
of the line via knee injuries, the
picture up front does not look
good at alt.
But this is college football and
anything can happen.
There will be another duel be
sides ihe Norman-Schloredt aerial
display. Skip Face, Stanford full
back will take on Washington's
Charlie Mitchell in the rushing
department.
FACE, now a senior, was run
nerup in the national scoring
derby last season and doesn't
seem to have lost any of his drive,

last week being named AAWU
back-of-the-week.
Mitchell, just a sophomore, op
erates from the halfback slot and
possesses that breakaway speed
and fantastic balance that have
people in Washington already

comparing him to the incompar
able Hugh McElhenny.
Curtice commented at Monday's
football luncheon, "I hear he's so
fast he has to run sideways to

keep from flying."
NO .MATTER who wins, thi.<
game should certainly be inter
esting, and everyone can be as
sured of an afternoon of thrills
