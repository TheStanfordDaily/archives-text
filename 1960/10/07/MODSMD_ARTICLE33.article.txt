# Farm Water Poloists Open Against Powerful California Bears Today
## 
### 
Stanford's water polo squad
picked a tough nut to crack when
they decided to open their 1960
campaign against the powerful
California Bears today at 3:30 in
the varsity pool.
The Bears, led by Dick Harlan
and Rumanian Olympic flash
John Bordy, have already racked
up two wins against no losses
for the season, defeating an alum
ni organization and the San Fran
cisco Olympic Club by a 6-3 count.
Coach Jim Gaughran's water
poloists got an unexpected boost
when U.S. Olympic star Paul Hait
turned out for the squad this week
and he is expected to see plenty
of action as the season rolls on.
Slated to start for the Cards
are Roger Johnson, Rich Rosen
berger, Bob and John Lorton, Bob
Spence, Mike Conn, and John
Bates.
Stanford's frosh team meets
Cal's Beareuhs here upon comple

tion of the varsity match at about
