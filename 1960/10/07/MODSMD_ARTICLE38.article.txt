Mickey Mantle's home run hero
ics led a modern murderers' row j
today as the wrathful New York j
Yankees rose up to square the
World Series at one game each ,
by annihilating the Pittsburgh
Pirates, 16-3.
Mantle, making up for four pre- j
vious strikeouts in this Series, I
clouted two home runs -one a!
tape measure dandy over the dis-J
tant ivy -covered brick wall in cen-1
terfield to knock in a record-ty-1
ing five runs and feature a 19-hit j
Yankee attack. It made bullet Bob |
Turley the victor before 37,308!
awed Pittsburgh fans, although j
he needed ninth-inning help from j
bantam Bobby Sham/.
THE YANKEES, on this alter
nately cloud and sunny day, gave
a morale-shattering display of
power as they hung the defeat on
fire-balling Bob Friend, first of
six Pirate pitchers.
But it was Mantle, the Ameri
can League home run champion
with 40, who stole the show as
he left Dodger Duke Snider be
hind in the World Series home
run derby and closed in to within
two of the immortal Babe Ruth's
all-time total of 15.
For the Oklahoma kid broke
the game open in the fifth inning
with a clothesline drive into the
right field seats with one aboard
which gave the Yanks a 5 to 1
lead and then hit his 13th Series
homer in the seventh with two
on. That one was a real blast,
arching high and far over that
15-foot brick wall in right center
field and it made him the only
man ever to clear the barrier 436
feet from the plate while hitting
right-handed.
THOSE TWO shots gave him
five runs batted in, equalling a
feat previously performed by Yan
kee immortals Tony Lazzeri and
Bill Dickey as well as Ted Klus
zewski, hitting for the White Sox
last year.
The Yankees really put the
game away in the sixth inning
when they sent 12 men to the
plate for a total of seven runs
equalling their biggest total run
inning ever in a legendary history
stretching through 25 of these
classics.
Turley, reaching two years into
the past for the variety of pitches j
which made the hero of the 1958
series, coasted through 8 1 in-:
nings before the Pirates came off
the floor for two runs and Shantz
went in to wind it up. By that
time, the two clubs had battered
1he hurlers for a total of 32 hits
the Pirates getting 13 to break
the Series record of 29 set by the 1
Cardinals and Red Sox on Oct.
10, 1946.
IT WAS a listless ball game,
with little sound from the crowd,
until the Yankees finally broke
the ice in the third inning.
Even then it was the bottom

of the batting order which got
the Yankee show on Ihe road as!
light-hitting Bo bI) y Richardson !
' drew a walk and Turley sacrificed j
| him to second base. Tony Kubek
! laced a single to center which sent
: Richardson racing home with the
' first run of the game. Rangy Gil
McDougald followed by ripping a
double down the left field line
j which, fair by inches, scored the
| rambling Kubek.
j The hopes of the Buc fans were
| further cooled when Mantle de
i livered his opening homer in the
j fifth with Roger Maris aboard and :
| then a deep pall of gloom settled j
lover the ancient ball park as ihe
I Yankees came up in that history
j matching sixth.

IN THE NINTH, the Yankees
had a shot at the World Series
record of 18 runs they scored
against the Giants then in New
York and now in San Francisco
back in 1936.
In that inning, with two men
out, Mantle walked, went to third
when Cletis Boyer, a late-inning
defensive replacement, doubled.
Mantle scored on a wild pitch
and Skowron came to bat.
"We knew if Moose hit one it
would tie that old record," said
Stengel in the clubhouse after
ward, "and we were all rooting
for him."
THE MOOSE, however, rapped
a weak grounder to Tom Cheney,
the final Pittsburgh pitcher, and

the Yanks lost their chance.
Leading by a 1(5-1 margin at this
time, the Yanks also were shoot
ing for the biggest margin of vic
tory of all time because no team
ever had been beaten by more
than 14 runs.
Both teams take a day off for
travel and on Saturday they re
sume in the vast con fines of Yan
kee Stadium. The Yanks, hoping
to close it out in three games ai
the stadium and escape the neces
sity of a return to Pittsburgh for
sixth and seventh games, will
shoot for a second win with left
hander Whitey Ford, a 12-game
winner. The Pirates will attempt
a comeback with southpaw Wil
mer (Vinegar Bend > Mi/ell, who
captured 14 games this season.

Mickey Mantle's home run hero
ics led a modern murderers' row j
today as the wrathful New York j
Yankees rose up to square the
World Series at one game each ,
by annihilating the Pittsburgh
Pirates, 16-3.
Mantle, making up for four pre- j
vious strikeouts in this Series, I
clouted two home runs -one a!
tape measure dandy over the dis-J
tant ivy -covered brick wall in cen-1
terfield to knock in a record-ty-1
ing five runs and feature a 19-hit j
Yankee attack. It made bullet Bob |
Turley the victor before 37,308!
awed Pittsburgh fans, although j
he needed ninth-inning help from j
bantam Bobby Sham/.
THE YANKEES, on this alter
nately cloud and sunny day, gave
a morale-shattering display of
power as they hung the defeat on
fire-balling Bob Friend, first of
six Pirate pitchers.
But it was Mantle, the Ameri
can League home run champion
with 40, who stole the show as
he left Dodger Duke Snider be
hind in the World Series home
run derby and closed in to within
two of the immortal Babe Ruth's
all-time total of 15.
For the Oklahoma kid broke
the game open in the fifth inning
with a clothesline drive into the
right field seats with one aboard
which gave the Yanks a 5 to 1
lead and then hit his 13th Series
homer in the seventh with two
on. That one was a real blast,
arching high and far over that
15-foot brick wall in right center
field and it made him the only
man ever to clear the barrier 436
feet from the plate while hitting
right-handed.
THOSE TWO shots gave him
five runs batted in, equalling a
feat previously performed by Yan
kee immortals Tony Lazzeri and
Bill Dickey as well as Ted Klus
zewski, hitting for the White Sox
last year.
The Yankees really put the
game away in the sixth inning
when they sent 12 men to the
plate for a total of seven runs
equalling their biggest total run
inning ever in a legendary history
stretching through 25 of these
classics.
Turley, reaching two years into
the past for the variety of pitches j
which made the hero of the 1958
series, coasted through 8 1 in-:
nings before the Pirates came off
the floor for two runs and Shantz
went in to wind it up. By that
time, the two clubs had battered
1he hurlers for a total of 32 hits
the Pirates getting 13 to break
the Series record of 29 set by the 1
Cardinals and Red Sox on Oct.
10, 1946.
IT WAS a listless ball game,
with little sound from the crowd,
until the Yankees finally broke
the ice in the third inning.
Even then it was the bottom

of the batting order which got
the Yankee show on Ihe road as!
light-hitting Bo bI) y Richardson !
' drew a walk and Turley sacrificed j
| him to second base. Tony Kubek
! laced a single to center which sent
: Richardson racing home with the
' first run of the game. Rangy Gil
McDougald followed by ripping a
double down the left field line
j which, fair by inches, scored the
| rambling Kubek.
j The hopes of the Buc fans were
| further cooled when Mantle de
i livered his opening homer in the
j fifth with Roger Maris aboard and :
| then a deep pall of gloom settled j
lover the ancient ball park as ihe
I Yankees came up in that history
j matching sixth.

IN THE NINTH, the Yankees
had a shot at the World Series
record of 18 runs they scored
against the Giants then in New
York and now in San Francisco
back in 1936.
In that inning, with two men
out, Mantle walked, went to third
when Cletis Boyer, a late-inning
defensive replacement, doubled.
Mantle scored on a wild pitch
and Skowron came to bat.
"We knew if Moose hit one it
would tie that old record," said
Stengel in the clubhouse after
ward, "and we were all rooting
for him."
THE MOOSE, however, rapped
a weak grounder to Tom Cheney,
the final Pittsburgh pitcher, and

the Yanks lost their chance.
Leading by a 1(5-1 margin at this
time, the Yanks also were shoot
ing for the biggest margin of vic
tory of all time because no team
ever had been beaten by more
than 14 runs.
Both teams take a day off for
travel and on Saturday they re
sume in the vast con fines of Yan
kee Stadium. The Yanks, hoping
to close it out in three games ai
the stadium and escape the neces
sity of a return to Pittsburgh for

Mickey Mantle's home run hero
ics led a modern murderers' row j
today as the wrathful New York j
Yankees rose up to square the
World Series at one game each ,
by annihilating the Pittsburgh
Pirates, 16-3.
Mantle, making up for four pre- j
vious strikeouts in this Series, I
clouted two home runs -one a!
tape measure dandy over the dis-J
tant ivy -covered brick wall in cen-1
terfield to knock in a record-ty-1
ing five runs and feature a 19-hit j
Yankee attack. It made bullet Bob |
Turley the victor before 37,308!
awed Pittsburgh fans, although j
he needed ninth-inning help from j
bantam Bobby Sham/.
THE YANKEES, on this alter
nately cloud and sunny day, gave
a morale-shattering display of
power as they hung the defeat on
fire-balling Bob Friend, first of
six Pirate pitchers.
But it was Mantle, the Ameri
can League home run champion
with 40, who stole the show as
he left Dodger Duke Snider be
hind in the World Series home
run derby and closed in to within
two of the immortal Babe Ruth's
all-time total of 15.
For the Oklahoma kid broke
the game open in the fifth inning
with a clothesline drive into the
right field seats with one aboard
which gave the Yanks a 5 to 1
lead and then hit his 13th Series
homer in the seventh with two
on. That one was a real blast,
arching high and far over that
15-foot brick wall in right center
field and it made him the only
man ever to clear the barrier 436
feet from the plate while hitting
right-handed.
THOSE TWO shots gave him
five runs batted in, equalling a
feat previously performed by Yan
kee immortals Tony Lazzeri and
Bill Dickey as well as Ted Klus
zewski, hitting for the White Sox
last year.
The Yankees really put the
game away in the sixth inning
when they sent 12 men to the
plate for a total of seven runs
equalling their biggest total run
inning ever in a legendary history
stretching through 25 of these
classics.
Turley, reaching two years into
the past for the variety of pitches j
which made the hero of the 1958
series, coasted through 8 1 in-:
nings before the Pirates came off
the floor for two runs and Shantz
went in to wind it up. By that
time, the two clubs had battered
1he hurlers for a total of 32 hits
the Pirates getting 13 to break
the Series record of 29 set by the 1
Cardinals and Red Sox on Oct.
10, 1946.
IT WAS a listless ball game,
with little sound from the crowd,
until the Yankees finally broke
the ice in the third inning.
Even then it was the bottom

of the batting order which got
the Yankee show on Ihe road as!
light-hitting Bo bI) y Richardson !
' drew a walk and Turley sacrificed j
| him to second base. Tony Kubek
! laced a single to center which sent
: Richardson racing home with the
' first run of the game. Rangy Gil
McDougald followed by ripping a
double down the left field line
j which, fair by inches, scored the
| rambling Kubek.
j The hopes of the Buc fans were
| further cooled when Mantle de
i livered his opening homer in the
j fifth with Roger Maris aboard and :
| then a deep pall of gloom settled j
lover the ancient ball park as ihe
I Yankees came up in that history
j matching sixth.

IN THE NINTH, the Yankees
had a shot at the World Series
record of 18 runs they scored
against the Giants then in New
York and now in San Francisco
back in 1936.
In that inning, with two men
out, Mantle walked, went to third
when Cletis Boyer, a late-inning
defensive replacement, doubled.
Mantle scored on a wild pitch
and Skowron came to bat.
"We knew if Moose hit one it
would tie that old record," said
Stengel in the clubhouse after
ward, "and we were all rooting
for him."
THE MOOSE, however, rapped
a weak grounder to Tom Cheney,
the final Pittsburgh pitcher, and

the Yanks lost their chance.
Leading by a 1(5-1 margin at this
time, the Yanks also were shoot
ing for the biggest margin of vic
tory of all time because no team
ever had been beaten by more
than 14 runs.
Both teams take a day off for
travel and on Saturday they re
sume in the vast con fines of Yan
