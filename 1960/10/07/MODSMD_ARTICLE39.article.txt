# FIRST LEAGUE CONTEST
## Stanford Soccer Squad Hosts San Jose State 
### GLENN ALFORO 
Stanford opens its 1960 West
Coast Soccer League season
against San Jose State tomorrow.
The game will take place on Stan
ford's Harry Maloney Field at
11:00. The varsity game will be
proceeded at 9:30 by the Stanford-
JV-San Jose JV contest.
In San Jose State, Stanford will
be facing a greatly improved
team. The Spartans will have vir
tually all their starting team re
turning in addition to most of
the players who were on reserve
teams.
San Jose will be a much more
high scoring outfit than last year.
The reason for this is a front line
featuring Bob Meyers, Joe Bat
taglini, and 45-year-old Abdul
Maschal.
As usual, San Jose will be rug
ged on defense. Goalie Gary Foss,
one of the outstanding players in
the all-star game, and fullback
Colin Lindores make the Spartan
goal almost invulnerable.
In last year's game, Lindores
was kind enough to put the ball

in his own goal, to give Stanford
the tying goal in a game the Indi
ans eventually won, 5-2. Starring
for Stanford in that game was
Adam Bianchi, who scored two
goals.
Stanford soccer coach Fred
Priddle has made one big change
in his starting lineup: All-Ameri
can Bernie 1< n a g g s has been
shifted back to his usual inside
position. This isn't because he
didn't play well, but because his
passing and scoring skill can be
put to better use in the front line.
Allison Gibbs will take Knaggs'
former halfback slot.
Stanford will open Beau Bian
chi at goalie; Dan Farthing and
Dick Voa k e, fullbacks; Gibbs,
Rusty Williams, and Jan Achen
bach, halfbacks; and Adam Bian
chi, Knaggs, high-scoring Emman
uel Andah, Rune Engebrettsen,
and Mike Tippett, forwards.
Tippett is ailing and might not
play, in which case Dick Bait lot t
would play for Engebrettsen at
inside and Rune would play Tip
pett 's position.
