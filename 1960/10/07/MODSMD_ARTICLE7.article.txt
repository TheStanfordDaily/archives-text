mier Fidel Castro had flown into
eastern Cuba to lead his troops
against the invaders, described by
exile sources as spearheading a
"second front."
AX OFFICIAL communique

the United States and carried an
American flag." iln Washington,
the State Department indicated
it believed the "invasion" to be a
put-up job by I lie Castro regime
to embarrass the United States.)

lieving pressure on the anti-Castro
guerrilla bands. Castro, is re
ported to have thrown 1.1,000 army
and militia troops into the central

force operating there in 1 (J- and
