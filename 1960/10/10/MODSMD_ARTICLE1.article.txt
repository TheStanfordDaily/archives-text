# Washington Turns Back Game Cards
## 
### KEN DERY 
THE performers were different
but the script the same as the'
Stanford football team lost itsj
fourth straight game of the 1960
season Saturday at Stanford
Stadiu m.
The conquerors in this battle I
were the Huskies of the Univer-j
sity of Washington. While the
score of 29-10 is not completely
indicative of the game, neverthe
less the boys from Seattle man
aged to beat the predicted point
spread of 15 points.
Stanford was very much in this
football game as late as three
plays into the fourth quarter. But
then disaster struck as sophomore
Gary Craig chose to field a tow
ering punt from All-America Bob
Schlorcdt. The pigskin and over
600 pounds of driving flesh in
the form of three big football
players met Craig at the same |
instant and it was no small won- j
der that the Indian halfback was
able to rise at all.
WASHINGTON taking posses
sion at the Stanford 40-yard line
proceeded to sweep over for six
points in only three plays and the
game for all practical purposes
had been decided.
Washington received the open- j
ing kickoff on the beautifully!
sunny day and showed all of their i
many fans watching the game on
a coast-to-coast television hookup
that it had come to play.
With fullback Ray Jackson and |
halfbacks Don McKeta and George j
Fleming picking up yardage in j
chunks of five, six and seven at j
a time, the Huskies soon found!
themselves on the Card seven, j
The plucky Indians held, however, j
and only three points were posted |
on the scoreboard as Fleming
kicked one through the uprights.;
WASHINGTON kicked off and;
the ball was taken by fullback;
Skip Face, but not held for long |
as he fumbled when hit by Dave ;
En.slow and Sam Hurworth re-1
covered on the 18. The Huskies
smoothly executed a reverse play
for the touchdown with Fleming
handing the ball back to Schlor
edt who threw a strike to end
Lee Folkins.
It really looked like a rout was
coming at this point for the game
was only ten minutes old and the
score was 10 to 0.
BUT Ca c I us Ja e k Curtis'
charges were not going to lay
down by any means. With Archie
Schmidt and Gil Dowd trying to
crash through the wall of Wash
ington linemen up the middle and
Dick No rm a n pitching out to i
them in an attempt to sweep the!
ends, the attack started to move
the ball. The movement was small
compared to the speed displayed
by the Washington backs, but ■
nonetheless the Indians were!
marching goalward.
With the ball on the Iluskie 38
an a fourth down and five to go!
situation, Norman pitched a bul-i
let to Dale Ostrander to the 251
and the home rooting section ]
really had something to cheer
about.
The drive finally was stopped!
however, and the Indians had to
settle for a Skip Face field goal.
Washington scored again on a
fantastic punt return by Charlie
Mitchell. Half-time score was 17-3. !
TIIK halftime festivities en
abled the relatively small crowd
of 23,500 fans to relieve at least j
some of its frustrations. The In-1


STANFORD FULLBACK CIL DOWD
Husky line led by Guard Chuck Allen (66) stops Indian after short gain
dian card stunt section greeted
the national television audience
with "Hi TV Addicts" and after
numerous other novelties ended
with the traditional expanding
"S." Some of the more alert fresh
men took the opportunity of the
camera time to say hello to their
parents, one long banner saying
"Hi Mom Send Money."
The gladiators returned soon
after and the contest began anew.
Stanford received the kickoff and
got as far as its own 35-yard line
but then had to punt. Two plays
later the lightning-fast Charlie
Mitchell fumbled and Stanford
had a chance with first down on
the Huskie 12.
WYLIE tried the center of the
line for no gain; Dowd swept left
end for six yards; Dowd next
tried to circle right end but Me-
Keta made a tremendous tackle
after being blocked to his knees.
On the fourth down try young
Mitchell made up for his fumble
by coming up fast from his half
back spot to nail Dowd as he
again attempted to score on the
right.
Washington could not make a
first down and the doggedly per
sistent Cards again made their
bid.
This time Hie machine ran
steadily and with 1:27 remaining
in the third stanza right half Hal
Steuher carried it over the last
stripe and Washington's lead was
cut to 17-10.
FACE kicked off and after
showing a vicious de 112 e nsi v e
charge that really pushed the
Huskies around, the Indians pre
pared to field Schloredt's punt
and go some more. But this was
not to be the case as Craig's
fumble abruptly halted the hope
of an amazing upset.
Washington picked up steam
once again after this break and
they scored twice more in that
final period to close it out at
29-10.

HUSKY BACKFIELD IN ACTION
Fullback Ray Jackson (35) takes handoff from Quarterback Bob Schloredt (15).
THE performers were different
but the script the same as the'
Stanford football team lost itsj
fourth straight game of the 1960
season Saturday at Stanford
Stadiu m.
The conquerors in this battle I
were the Huskies of the Univer-j
sity of Washington. While the
score of 29-10 is not completely
indicative of the game, neverthe
less the boys from Seattle man
aged to beat the predicted point
spread of 15 points.
Stanford was very much in this
football game as late as three
plays into the fourth quarter. But
then disaster struck as sophomore
Gary Craig chose to field a tow
ering punt from All-America Bob
Schlorcdt. The pigskin and over
600 pounds of driving flesh in
the form of three big football
players met Craig at the same |
instant and it was no small won- j
der that the Indian halfback was
able to rise at all.
WASHINGTON taking posses
sion at the Stanford 40-yard line
proceeded to sweep over for six
points in only three plays and the
game for all practical purposes
had been decided.
Washington received the open- j
ing kickoff on the beautifully!
sunny day and showed all of their i
many fans watching the game on
a coast-to-coast television hookup
that it had come to play.
With fullback Ray Jackson and |
halfbacks Don McKeta and George j
Fleming picking up yardage in j
chunks of five, six and seven at j
a time, the Huskies soon found!
themselves on the Card seven, j
The plucky Indians held, however, j
and only three points were posted |
on the scoreboard as Fleming
kicked one through the uprights.;
WASHINGTON kicked off and;
the ball was taken by fullback;
Skip Face, but not held for long |
as he fumbled when hit by Dave ;
En.slow and Sam Hurworth re-1
covered on the 18. The Huskies
smoothly executed a reverse play
for the touchdown with Fleming
handing the ball back to Schlor
edt who threw a strike to end
Lee Folkins.
It really looked like a rout was
coming at this point for the game
was only ten minutes old and the
score was 10 to 0.
BUT Ca c I us Ja e k Curtis'
charges were not going to lay
down by any means. With Archie
Schmidt and Gil Dowd trying to
crash through the wall of Wash
ington linemen up the middle and
Dick No rm a n pitching out to i
them in an attempt to sweep the!
ends, the attack started to move
the ball. The movement was small
compared to the speed displayed
by the Washington backs, but ■
nonetheless the Indians were!
marching goalward.
With the ball on the Iluskie 38
an a fourth down and five to go!
situation, Norman pitched a bul-i
let to Dale Ostrander to the 251
and the home rooting section ]
really had something to cheer
about.
The drive finally was stopped!
however, and the Indians had to
settle for a Skip Face field goal.
Washington scored again on a
fantastic punt return by Charlie
Mitchell. Half-time score was 17-3. !

dian card stunt section greeted
the national television audience
with "Hi TV Addicts" and after
numerous other novelties ended
with the traditional expanding
"S." Some of the more alert fresh
men took the opportunity of the
camera time to say hello to their
parents, one long banner saying
"Hi Mom Send Money."
The gladiators returned soon
after and the contest began anew.
Stanford received the kickoff and
got as far as its own 35-yard line
but then had to punt. Two plays
later the lightning-fast Charlie
Mitchell fumbled and Stanford
had a chance with first down on
the Huskie 12.
WYLIE tried the center of the
line for no gain; Dowd swept left
end for six yards; Dowd next
tried to circle right end but Me-
Keta made a tremendous tackle
after being blocked to his knees.
On the fourth down try young
Mitchell made up for his fumble
by coming up fast from his half
back spot to nail Dowd as he
again attempted to score on the
right.
Washington could not make a
first down and the doggedly per
sistent Cards again made their
bid.
This time Hie machine ran
steadily and with 1:27 remaining
in the third stanza right half Hal
Steuher carried it over the last
stripe and Washington's lead was
cut to 17-10.
FACE kicked off and after
showing a vicious de 112 e nsi v e
charge that really pushed the
Huskies around, the Indians pre
pared to field Schloredt's punt
and go some more. But this was
not to be the case as Craig's
fumble abruptly halted the hope
of an amazing upset.
Washington picked up steam
once again after this break and
they scored twice more in that
final period to close it out at
29-10.

Fullback Ray Jackson (35) takes handoff from Quarterback Bob Schloredt (15).
THE performers were different
but the script the same as the'
Stanford football team lost itsj
fourth straight game of the 1960
season Saturday at Stanford
Stadiu m.
The conquerors in this battle I
were the Huskies of the Univer-j
sity of Washington. While the
score of 29-10 is not completely
indicative of the game, neverthe
less the boys from Seattle man
aged to beat the predicted point
spread of 15 points.
Stanford was very much in this
football game as late as three
plays into the fourth quarter. But
then disaster struck as sophomore
Gary Craig chose to field a tow
ering punt from All-America Bob
Schlorcdt. The pigskin and over
600 pounds of driving flesh in
the form of three big football
players met Craig at the same |
instant and it was no small won- j
der that the Indian halfback was
able to rise at all.
WASHINGTON taking posses
sion at the Stanford 40-yard line
proceeded to sweep over for six
points in only three plays and the
game for all practical purposes
had been decided.
Washington received the open- j
ing kickoff on the beautifully!
sunny day and showed all of their i
many fans watching the game on
a coast-to-coast television hookup
that it had come to play.
With fullback Ray Jackson and |
halfbacks Don McKeta and George j
Fleming picking up yardage in j
chunks of five, six and seven at j
a time, the Huskies soon found!
themselves on the Card seven, j
The plucky Indians held, however, j
and only three points were posted |
on the scoreboard as Fleming
kicked one through the uprights.;
WASHINGTON kicked off and;
the ball was taken by fullback;
Skip Face, but not held for long |
as he fumbled when hit by Dave ;
En.slow and Sam Hurworth re-1
covered on the 18. The Huskies
smoothly executed a reverse play
for the touchdown with Fleming
handing the ball back to Schlor
edt who threw a strike to end
Lee Folkins.
It really looked like a rout was
coming at this point for the game
was only ten minutes old and the
score was 10 to 0.
BUT Ca c I us Ja e k Curtis'
charges were not going to lay
down by any means. With Archie
Schmidt and Gil Dowd trying to
crash through the wall of Wash
ington linemen up the middle and
Dick No rm a n pitching out to i
them in an attempt to sweep the!
ends, the attack started to move
the ball. The movement was small
compared to the speed displayed
by the Washington backs, but ■
nonetheless the Indians were!
marching goalward.
With the ball on the Iluskie 38
an a fourth down and five to go!
situation, Norman pitched a bul-i
let to Dale Ostrander to the 251
and the home rooting section ]
really had something to cheer
about.
The drive finally was stopped!
however, and the Indians had to
settle for a Skip Face field goal.
Washington scored again on a
fantastic punt return by Charlie

dian card stunt section greeted
the national television audience
with "Hi TV Addicts" and after
numerous other novelties ended
with the traditional expanding
"S." Some of the more alert fresh
men took the opportunity of the
camera time to say hello to their
parents, one long banner saying
"Hi Mom Send Money."
The gladiators returned soon
after and the contest began anew.
Stanford received the kickoff and
got as far as its own 35-yard line
but then had to punt. Two plays
later the lightning-fast Charlie
Mitchell fumbled and Stanford
had a chance with first down on
the Huskie 12.
WYLIE tried the center of the
line for no gain; Dowd swept left
end for six yards; Dowd next
tried to circle right end but Me-
Keta made a tremendous tackle
after being blocked to his knees.
On the fourth down try young
Mitchell made up for his fumble
by coming up fast from his half
back spot to nail Dowd as he
again attempted to score on the
right.
Washington could not make a
first down and the doggedly per

bid.

steadily and with 1:27 remaining
in the third stanza right half Hal
Steuher carried it over the last
stripe and Washington's lead was
cut to 17-10.
FACE kicked off and after
showing a vicious de 112 e nsi v e
charge that really pushed the
Huskies around, the Indians pre
pared to field Schloredt's punt
and go some more. But this was
not to be the case as Craig's
fumble abruptly halted the hope
of an amazing upset.
Washington picked up steam
once again after this break and
they scored twice more in that
final period to close it out at
29-10.
