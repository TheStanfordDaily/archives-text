SULTRY VOICED SIREN RETURNS TO AIR
Stanford Sadie, a fall tradition on KZSU since 1 946, is back
on the air after a two-year break. Every Monday evening
at 8:30 she will be giving advice to the lovelorn and con
ducting her "Date With Sadie" contest. Although this
year's Sadie has just been chosen, her identity will not be
revealed until the end of Autumn Quarter.
