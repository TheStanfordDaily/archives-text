## Also Assures He'll Never Start a War 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (UPI)
Premier Nikita Khrushchev said
last night he was prepared to
meet at the summit with the next
President of the United Slates
and that he firmly believed such
a meeting would take place.
The Soviet Premier appeared
on livp television for two hours
and five minutes and wound up
with a "categorical" pledge that
the Soviet Union would never
start a war.
"So you can sleep in peace," ho
said.
KHRUSHCHEV, making his
only TV interview appearance on
the program "Open End" with
host David Susskind before his
departure for Russia Thursday,
was in turn angry, serious and
jocular.
He said first ho was prepared
to have mattresses brought in and
stay all night for questioning but
when Susskind's queries became
more and more critical he brought
the interview to a conclusion.
Khrushchev made these points:
I.> He angrily rejected Presi
dent Eisenhower's challenge of a
world-wide plebiscite on whether
people prefer communism or
Western democracy.
2.) He said it was a "wild idea"
that Berlin could lead to a nu
clear war. But he said the Soviets
intended to sign a separate peace
treaty with East Germany and
let West Berlin live under capi
talism with free outside contacts.
8.) The Soviet satellite coun
tries are sovereign states so he
would not talk about their sub
mitting to a plebiscite about a
freely chosen government.
4.) Charged the United States
intended to make another high
altitude espionage flight over
Russia just before he came to
New York. The allegation was
that he warned the American am
bassador in Moscow that the
plane would be shot down and the
flight was cancelled.
