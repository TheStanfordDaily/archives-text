# Complete Text of Chester Bowles' Speech
## 
### 
Approximately one-half of Representative Chester Bowles"
Wednesday speech appears on today's editorial page. The other
half will appear tomorrow.
We presume that the appearanee of this speech in full will
raise a cry of "more Daily partisanship." All we con say is that
this is not so. Bowies' speech was basically nonpartisan and bril
liantly analyzed what America's foreign policy should he, whether
there is a Republican or Democratic I'resident.

T've been doing a lot of cam
paigning in this part of the coun
try and also across the Middle
West and I'll be continuing to do
this for many weeks to come. But
I'm glad to come here because I
like very much to talk to people
your age, because I really feel
that you have a big, big task to
do here.
I have a feeling sometimes
that you understand it better than
my generation. That's because
perhaps I know a great many of
you of your age.
I think you're probably going
to do a lot better than we've done.
At the same time I ask you to
be very tolerant in your views
about us. After all, all the things
that have happened these last 30
years have been unexpected and
I can't remember a single course
or a single professor at Yale Uni
versity that prepared me in the
least way for the kind of world
in which we have to live.
This has really been a differ
ent world and, of course, in the
last 20 years the world has really
changed at a fantastic speed. The
First World War destroyed most
of the imperial development and
the patterns of Europe and the
Second World War destroyed even
more. If you think of the changes
that have taken place since 1945,
it really leaves you almost breath
less.
There were 50 nations in the
U.N. in 1945. There are now very
nearly 100 nations. Something
close to a billion people have won
their freedom from colonialism.
There has been a fantastic spread- j
ing all over the world of the |
knowledge of the new technology,
the new opportunities that await
people once this new technology
can be put to work in their coun
tries.
The whole world is waking up.
with an enormous impact on us
and other more settled parts of
the world. And the next admin
istration, be it headed by Mr.
Nixon or Mr. Kennedy, is going
to face an enormous challenge.
,We have really arrived, I be
lieve, at a sort of decisive turn
ing point in history. It seems to
me to be something like 1860
where there's a sharp dividing
line in the whole historical proc-!
ess. I don't mean we're about to
have a civil war, although it some- j
times sounds that way when you
read some of those political
speeches.
What I simply mean is that
the forces that are alive today are |
going to press us to re-examine 1
ourselves as we never have be
fore; re-examine our relations;
with the world, and I'm sure we're |
going to have to come up with a
lot of fresh ideas and fresh think-'
ing, if we're going to deal at all
adequately with the world that!
lies ahead.
Now what are the forces with
which we have to contend? The
first force of all is the world
revolution to which I referred.!
"The revolution of rising expec
tations," as Adlai Stevenson and
others have called it, the revolu
tion of people all across this world
who have suddenly awakened to
the enormous possibility that sci
ence and technology have placed
within their grasp.
Everywhere in the most remote
village, people are suddenly com
ing to feel that almost anything
is possible. One hundred years j
ago or even 10 years ago most j
of them had never even dreamed
of having a doctor in their vil
lage, or a road that would allow j
them to get oui to market or j
any feeling that they could par-1
ticipate in the affairs of their
country.
They were tucked away in the
backway of the world and civili
zation with all the things mov
ing by, leaving their village pretty
much the same as it had been for
centuries. And suddenly now in
Latin America, Africa and in
Asia they're waking up and they j
are demanding not only freedom
—this is really almost the easiest
part—but they're demanding an
opportunity to share more justly
on a broader basis with the po
tential growth and development
of their country.
Now this is an enormous pow
erful force, and it's a force that
we do not thoroughly understand.
I think most of the troubles we
have gotten into these last years
have been our failure to under
stand these forces and understand
how deep it runs or also how
closely related it is in many ways
to our own concepts and ideas
and ideals and objectives, even
though the people who are active
in it often look so different and
appear to think so differently.
Actually if you start to explore
this revolution you find we have
a great deal in common with it.
And then as somewhat part of
this revolution, but having come
under totalitarian controls, is

China; f»50.000,000 people awak
| ing also to the future under a
totalitarian, communist dictator
ship, with enormous plans, enor
mous programs and with some
very great and fundamental dis
advantages as they move to carry
out their objectives.
These disadvantages, these
shortages that exist in China in
my mind, for the long haul, may
be much more important to us
i than the fact that China is com
munist, unpleasant though this
latter fact may be.
This time it is reinforced by
another factor which is not. very
well understood in America or,
indeed, even in Europe. That is
the fact that China is also a
have-not country in the modern
industrial sense of the word in
at least two or three very impor
tant categories.
First of all, she has only about
two acres of cultivated land for
every rural family. On that two
acres of cultivated land, the Chi
nese people have to raise the
food for their families, raise the
j food for the city people, and some
food for export. China is also
short of oil. Her reserves of oil
are very limited and she is now
! thought to import 75 per cent of
jail her oil from the Soviet Union.
She has manganese and she has
tin and she has coal, iron and
I other resources, but she lacks par
j ticularly these two basic needs:
land and oil. Just to the south
and southeast of her are areas
: which are not overly populated,
j I'm speaking particularly of Su
; matra, Malaya and Cambodia,
! Viet Nam, Thailand and Burma,
where there are great major re
sources, not fully used by any
means, a potential of oil develop
ment, much land, good sun, goo<l
soil, an opportunity for two or
three crops per year.
And the pressure which may
grow on this Peking government
to expand in this direction is very
great. It's one of the basic facts
of life as we look at Asia. And
then there is also another chal
lenge: the challenge of the Soviet
Union, becoming in two short gen
erations the second industrial
power in the world. Enormously
powerful and growing at the rate
! of something like eight per cent
j a year, graduating perhaps as
| many as twice as many engineers
and scientists as we do a year,
and we all know them to be very
able individuals indeed.
And behind all this there's a
| fourth force, and this is the force
'of the new weapons, this hideous
; new capacity that we've developed
to slough off a huge segment of
' mankind with nuclear bombs and
i missiles and other contraptions.
! Mankind has always had rather
! a weakness for war, but fortu
! nately in the past we weren't able
; to hurt each other to any great
j degree until this century.
And then we perfected the art
1 of killing to a very fine point.
I Unhappily these new nuclear
j weapons are making the prospect
l of war even more impressive, and
i I think most of us will agree that
somehow, someway, this must be
j prevented.
Yet we're no brighter as indi
viduals than our parents. We
i probably have no more concept
I of living together—or not much
more concept—and this threat is
very great, because while no one
might want to start a nuclear
war, the chance of a failure of
communication, miscalculation;
the chance of somebody in panic
;or fear may pull that hideous
trigger is very much there and
very much present.
Now this is the world that we
face in the beginning of the 1960'5.
It's a very, very difficult, com
plex, dangerous, but in many
ways a very promising world in
which almost anything is possible,
either good or bad. Now what do
we want from this world? What
do we want as our part of it?
! What role would we like to play?
Well, I think most Americans—
!or at least many of us—would
say, "Well, we'd just be delighted
to play an isolationist role and
try to pull away from this and
let the world go by and enjoy our
high standard of living and hope
we can make a better society here
and let the world go its own way."
I think we also know that this
is impossible. This Is simply not
going to be. We're either going
to make our place in this world,
we're going to become a construc
tive part of it, or the world in
the future will pass us by with
all kinds of consequences that are
very difficult to foresee. Well, all
right, we have to deal with the
world; how do we do it and what
do we want?
Well, the first thing we'd like
to have happen is we'd like the
: right to survive. We just don't
| want to get blown lip. Rut I also
| think it's clear to us as we start
to analyze the problems about

| being' blown up, that this is not
a simple question.
Again you can't just make it go
away. You certainly can't avoir!
destruction by simply not build
ing an adequate air force, army,
navy and defense. You have to
be able to defend yourself to gain
the kind of time with which to
deal with all these forces.
Human beings being what they
are, would certainly rush across
any line in the world if it was
not adequately and vigorously de
fended. So we have to have weap
ons and a military system with
which to defend ourselves. It's
an open question as to what state
our affairs are in today.
China is also basically imperi
| alistic in terms of growth of any
single dynasty. When the Mings
rose to power and attempted to
spread into southeast Asia, they
(settled cities and developed cities
(•lose to Africa. When the Man
i chus rose to their height of power
| they rode west to south central
Asia. Now you have a new dyna
| sty under Mao Tsu Tung, this
; time a communist dynasty which
advances this proud expansionist
i view.
Out right on the heels of this,
and I believe that this is a point
tlicit not enough of us are fully
aware of, is the need for a wholly
i and totally now approach to the
question of disarmament and
! arms control.
I met just a week or 10 days
ago some of the really top mili
; tary scientists in America and
spent the better part of a day
with Ihein. These men had not
j been together as a group for
; almost a year. The reason why
i they had not come together was
j they all said they argued too
j much. They all had such violently
; different viewpoints as to how we
; could best defend ourselves, what
■ kind of weapons system should
| be favored in a new budget, and
j so on.
But they said it was easy for
J them to come together now be-
Icause they're all beginning to
I realize that the next President of
! the United States would probably
; be the last President who would
; really have the opportunity to
j find an American answer as far
I as how we could go in this ques
tion of arms control and disarm
ament.
In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out
(Hi us so fast that we at least
have to know where we stand,
what we are prepared to do, how
we can properly and safely nego
tiate with the (Soviet Union, what
we are prepared to compromise
on, what we can't compromise on.
This implies enormous research
programs, not yet even planned
! or even underway, in iho science
of detection and means the next
President must grind out a pro
gram and a policy, purely set our
objectives--and right now our
: objectives are a bit fuzzy and un
j certain.
It means that we really have
to grapple with this question, and
not hope that it will go away,
j under the bland assumption that
: whatever we propose the Soviets
! will turn it down, and therefore
i there's no real pressure on us to
think very hard about this essen
tial question.
i So first we must be sure we
can defend ourselves, but then
we must move on rapidly and
wholeheartedly and vigorously to
try to find our answer to the
1 nuclear dilemma in which the
world has drifted. Now, whether
the Soviet Union would accept a
| proper, rational program of pro
posals by us is an open question.
I did find encouraging that this
group of scientists said that they
had dealt with many Soviet sci
entists in the last few months und
felt that for the first time the
Soviet scientists were beginning
to realize the awful implications
of these scientific developments
in the field of armament. For the
first time they really felt that
they had been sobered by them
and realized that time was really
running out.
Now what is beyond all this?
i Beyond this is the need for the
; American people to secure a new
understanding as to the kind of
1 world in which we are living, to
' make our peace with that world
j • —the non-communist parts of it—

and learn how we can build a real
partnership with the people of
Africa, Asia, Latin America and
Europe; the kind of partnership
that will weld the non-communist
peoples together with a common
set of objectives and purposes and
common approaches to many of
these world problems.
Now to many people that will
sound impossible. It will sound
impossible because the outer
world sometimes looks so very
strange to us. But I would like
to suggest that this is nowhere
near as difficult as it sounds.
Last week, I spent a very inter
esting evening with an Indian
friend, and we talked about Indian
objectives and American objec
tives and I suggested that we
each write down on a piece of
paper what we would like to see
happen in India in the next 10
years. So on his list he wrote,
"I want to see India really inde
pendent, I want to see India se
cure access to capital so she can
build up her industries. I want
to see her spread her education
across the country, so her young
people can learn to read and write
with more doctors and opportuni
ties for all of her people. I'd like
to see her have technical assist
ance from people who could come
to help her w i th o u t political
strings, to see her get the capital
she needs—private and public—
to help her build her country,
again without political strings.
I'd like that she be a free nation,
able to trade with other people,
able to sell her raw materials and
products in a free market and
buying in other countries such as
the U.S.A."
He wrote out his list and I
wrote out mine. The lists were
identical; the lists were almost
precisely the same; the wording
was almost the same. Now you
can do this with a gentleman from
Tanganyika, Kenya or somebody
from Ghana or Nigeria, from Iraq
or Iran or Turkey.
You could do this with almost
any people on earth except those
behind the so-called Iron Curtain
and the communist nations. There
is only one way that you could
make these lists come apart. That
is if you say at the bottom: "You
must take our side in the Cold
War. You must be part of the
American bloc. You must be to
tally on our side, committed to
our efforts, in opposition to those
of the Soviet Union. If you add
that must, you'll destroy the asso
ciation. If you leave it off, you'll
find yourself with an extraordi
nary rate of agreement with the
people of the world who reject

I communism as vigorously as wen
i do. i
I The interesting and fascinating
, development of the last two weeks
is that Mr. Khrushchev has come
to understand us, and this, I be- ;
lieve, is why he is trying to blow
I the U.N. sky high as an operat
ing, administrative agency. Mr. j
I Khrushchev has come to see
'something which our State De
partment has belatedly come to
see, if it has seen it at all, and
that is our interest and those of
the new African nations, the new j
Latin American and Asian na-.
! tions, the non-communist nations
! of Europe, are very, very similar
i indeed. We want freedom, inde
pendence, prosperity, security,;
freedom of communication, free
dom of trade.
Now Mr. Khrushchev comes to
see this, he understands that the
i U.N. and its great majority of
new nations has become a very
important force in blocking his
own efforts to dominate Africa,
to secure his foothold in the Con
go, to move into Latin America,
through Cuba or wiiatever access
he may attempt. And therefore
he would like to destroy the U.N. !
as an operating agency and keep
it purely as a debating society,
where, of course, he can show off
his very extraordinary talents
with the odd specialized agencies
small enough to have no really
important role to play.
When we propose to him to lot i
us turn over the problems of I
Africa to the U.N. let us say to I
! the people of the Soviet Union j
; we will put all of our economic |
I assistance through the U.N.; we
j will agree that there will be no |
I arms race in Africa with you
j feeding one country and we an
, other; that we will agree with
you on a great U.N. civil service
i so that the peoples of these new
j nations can hire whoever they I
I need, whether it be a mathematics j
i teacher or an agricultural special-,
i ist, through the U.N., paying them i
their regular local salaries with I
I an additional salary increment i
paid by the U.N. to bring it up I
i to an international level. That we;
will let the whole operation of
the technical assistance of the
j U.N. in the world go through U.N.
rather than through cold war
j channels. We will propose an
i African adjunct to the world
court to help settle the disputes'
of Africa.
If we propose these things, the 1
Soviet Union takes fright. It takes
fright because they know they'll
not be bucking the United States,
but the United Nations, and this
lies of course behind Mr. Khrush

chev's discovery that the U.N. as |
an operating and administrative
body does not inn in line with j
his interests.
1 believe that when he left the
Soviet Union he did not intend
to make the speech that he made
at the U.N. I believe this all de
veloped during the trip abroad,
as he saw his whole effort in the
Congo come to a grinding stop.
In ihe 36 pages of Mr. Khrush
chev's speech, the first 30 pages
are relatively innocuous. The last
six pages are violent and vigor
ous and obviously were added
later.
So we have this chance, we
have this community of interests

with the world, if only we'll help
it to develop and grow.

a simple question.
Again you can't just make it go
away. You certainly can't avoir!
destruction by simply not build
ing an adequate air force, army,
navy and defense. You have to
be able to defend yourself to gain
the kind of time with which to
deal with all these forces.
Human beings being what they
are, would certainly rush across
any line in the world if it was
not adequately and vigorously de
fended. So we have to have weap
ons and a military system with
which to defend ourselves. It's
an open question as to what state
our affairs are in today.
China is also basically imperi
| alistic in terms of growth of any
single dynasty. When the Mings
rose to power and attempted to
spread into southeast Asia, they
(settled cities and developed cities
(•lose to Africa. When the Man
i chus rose to their height of power
| they rode west to south central
Asia. Now you have a new dyna
| sty under Mao Tsu Tung, this
; time a communist dynasty which
advances this proud expansionist
i view.
Out right on the heels of this,
and I believe that this is a point
tlicit not enough of us are fully
aware of, is the need for a wholly
i and totally now approach to the
question of disarmament and
! arms control.
I met just a week or 10 days
ago some of the really top mili
; tary scientists in America and
spent the better part of a day
with Ihein. These men had not
j been together as a group for
; almost a year. The reason why
i they had not come together was
j they all said they argued too
j much. They all had such violently
; different viewpoints as to how we
; could best defend ourselves, what
■ kind of weapons system should
| be favored in a new budget, and
j so on.
But they said it was easy for
J them to come together now be-
Icause they're all beginning to
I realize that the next President of
! the United States would probably
; be the last President who would
; really have the opportunity to
j find an American answer as far
I as how we could go in this ques
tion of arms control and disarm
ament.
In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out
(Hi us so fast that we at least
have to know where we stand,
what we are prepared to do, how
we can properly and safely nego
tiate with the (Soviet Union, what
we are prepared to compromise
on, what we can't compromise on.
This implies enormous research
programs, not yet even planned
! or even underway, in iho science
of detection and means the next
President must grind out a pro
gram and a policy, purely set our
objectives--and right now our
: objectives are a bit fuzzy and un
j certain.
It means that we really have
to grapple with this question, and
not hope that it will go away,
j under the bland assumption that
: whatever we propose the Soviets
! will turn it down, and therefore
i there's no real pressure on us to
think very hard about this essen
tial question.
i So first we must be sure we
can defend ourselves, but then
we must move on rapidly and
wholeheartedly and vigorously to
try to find our answer to the
1 nuclear dilemma in which the
world has drifted. Now, whether
the Soviet Union would accept a
| proper, rational program of pro
posals by us is an open question.
I did find encouraging that this
group of scientists said that they
had dealt with many Soviet sci
entists in the last few months und
felt that for the first time the
Soviet scientists were beginning
to realize the awful implications
of these scientific developments
in the field of armament. For the
first time they really felt that
they had been sobered by them
and realized that time was really
running out.
Now what is beyond all this?
i Beyond this is the need for the
; American people to secure a new
understanding as to the kind of
1 world in which we are living, to
' make our peace with that world
j • —the non-communist parts of it—

and learn how we can build a real
partnership with the people of
Africa, Asia, Latin America and
Europe; the kind of partnership
that will weld the non-communist
peoples together with a common
set of objectives and purposes and
common approaches to many of
these world problems.
Now to many people that will
sound impossible. It will sound
impossible because the outer
world sometimes looks so very
strange to us. But I would like
to suggest that this is nowhere
near as difficult as it sounds.
Last week, I spent a very inter
esting evening with an Indian
friend, and we talked about Indian
objectives and American objec
tives and I suggested that we
each write down on a piece of
paper what we would like to see
happen in India in the next 10
years. So on his list he wrote,
"I want to see India really inde
pendent, I want to see India se
cure access to capital so she can
build up her industries. I want
to see her spread her education
across the country, so her young
people can learn to read and write
with more doctors and opportuni
ties for all of her people. I'd like
to see her have technical assist
ance from people who could come
to help her w i th o u t political
strings, to see her get the capital
she needs—private and public—
to help her build her country,
again without political strings.
I'd like that she be a free nation,
able to trade with other people,
able to sell her raw materials and
products in a free market and
buying in other countries such as
the U.S.A."
He wrote out his list and I
wrote out mine. The lists were
identical; the lists were almost
precisely the same; the wording
was almost the same. Now you
can do this with a gentleman from
Tanganyika, Kenya or somebody
from Ghana or Nigeria, from Iraq
or Iran or Turkey.
You could do this with almost
any people on earth except those
behind the so-called Iron Curtain
and the communist nations. There
is only one way that you could
make these lists come apart. That
is if you say at the bottom: "You
must take our side in the Cold
War. You must be part of the
American bloc. You must be to
tally on our side, committed to
our efforts, in opposition to those
of the Soviet Union. If you add
that must, you'll destroy the asso
ciation. If you leave it off, you'll
find yourself with an extraordi
nary rate of agreement with the
people of the world who reject

I communism as vigorously as wen
i do. i
I The interesting and fascinating
, development of the last two weeks
is that Mr. Khrushchev has come
to understand us, and this, I be- ;
lieve, is why he is trying to blow
I the U.N. sky high as an operat
ing, administrative agency. Mr. j
I Khrushchev has come to see
'something which our State De
partment has belatedly come to
see, if it has seen it at all, and
that is our interest and those of
the new African nations, the new j
Latin American and Asian na-.
! tions, the non-communist nations
! of Europe, are very, very similar
i indeed. We want freedom, inde
pendence, prosperity, security,;
freedom of communication, free
dom of trade.
Now Mr. Khrushchev comes to
see this, he understands that the
i U.N. and its great majority of
new nations has become a very
important force in blocking his
own efforts to dominate Africa,
to secure his foothold in the Con
go, to move into Latin America,
through Cuba or wiiatever access
he may attempt. And therefore
he would like to destroy the U.N. !
as an operating agency and keep
it purely as a debating society,
where, of course, he can show off
his very extraordinary talents
with the odd specialized agencies
small enough to have no really
important role to play.
When we propose to him to lot i
us turn over the problems of I
Africa to the U.N. let us say to I
! the people of the Soviet Union j
; we will put all of our economic |
I assistance through the U.N.; we
j will agree that there will be no |
I arms race in Africa with you
j feeding one country and we an
, other; that we will agree with
you on a great U.N. civil service
i so that the peoples of these new
j nations can hire whoever they I
I need, whether it be a mathematics j
i teacher or an agricultural special-,
i ist, through the U.N., paying them i
their regular local salaries with I
I an additional salary increment i
paid by the U.N. to bring it up I
i to an international level. That we;
will let the whole operation of
the technical assistance of the
j U.N. in the world go through U.N.
rather than through cold war
j channels. We will propose an
i African adjunct to the world
court to help settle the disputes'
of Africa.
If we propose these things, the 1
Soviet Union takes fright. It takes
fright because they know they'll
not be bucking the United States,
but the United Nations, and this
lies of course behind Mr. Khrush

chev's discovery that the U.N. as |
an operating and administrative
body does not inn in line with j
his interests.
1 believe that when he left the
Soviet Union he did not intend
to make the speech that he made
at the U.N. I believe this all de
veloped during the trip abroad,
as he saw his whole effort in the
Congo come to a grinding stop.
In ihe 36 pages of Mr. Khrush
chev's speech, the first 30 pages
are relatively innocuous. The last
six pages are violent and vigor
ous and obviously were added
later.
So we have this chance, we
have this community of interests

with the world, if only we'll help
it to develop and grow.
Approximately one-half of Representative Chester Bowles"
Wednesday speech appears on today's editorial page. The other
half will appear tomorrow.
We presume that the appearanee of this speech in full will
raise a cry of "more Daily partisanship." All we con say is that
this is not so. Bowies' speech was basically nonpartisan and bril
liantly analyzed what America's foreign policy should he, whether
there is a Republican or Democratic I'resident.

T've been doing a lot of cam
paigning in this part of the coun
try and also across the Middle
West and I'll be continuing to do
this for many weeks to come. But
I'm glad to come here because I
like very much to talk to people
your age, because I really feel
that you have a big, big task to
do here.
I have a feeling sometimes
that you understand it better than
my generation. That's because
perhaps I know a great many of
you of your age.
I think you're probably going
to do a lot better than we've done.
At the same time I ask you to
be very tolerant in your views
about us. After all, all the things
that have happened these last 30
years have been unexpected and
I can't remember a single course
or a single professor at Yale Uni
versity that prepared me in the
least way for the kind of world
in which we have to live.
This has really been a differ
ent world and, of course, in the
last 20 years the world has really
changed at a fantastic speed. The
First World War destroyed most
of the imperial development and
the patterns of Europe and the
Second World War destroyed even
more. If you think of the changes
that have taken place since 1945,
it really leaves you almost breath
less.
There were 50 nations in the
U.N. in 1945. There are now very
nearly 100 nations. Something
close to a billion people have won
their freedom from colonialism.
There has been a fantastic spread- j
ing all over the world of the |
knowledge of the new technology,
the new opportunities that await
people once this new technology
can be put to work in their coun
tries.
The whole world is waking up.
with an enormous impact on us
and other more settled parts of
the world. And the next admin
istration, be it headed by Mr.
Nixon or Mr. Kennedy, is going
to face an enormous challenge.
,We have really arrived, I be
lieve, at a sort of decisive turn
ing point in history. It seems to
me to be something like 1860
where there's a sharp dividing
line in the whole historical proc-!
ess. I don't mean we're about to
have a civil war, although it some- j
times sounds that way when you
read some of those political
speeches.
What I simply mean is that
the forces that are alive today are |
going to press us to re-examine 1
ourselves as we never have be
fore; re-examine our relations;
with the world, and I'm sure we're |
going to have to come up with a
lot of fresh ideas and fresh think-'
ing, if we're going to deal at all
adequately with the world that!
lies ahead.
Now what are the forces with
which we have to contend? The
first force of all is the world
revolution to which I referred.!
"The revolution of rising expec
tations," as Adlai Stevenson and
others have called it, the revolu
tion of people all across this world
who have suddenly awakened to
the enormous possibility that sci
ence and technology have placed
within their grasp.
Everywhere in the most remote
village, people are suddenly com
ing to feel that almost anything
is possible. One hundred years j
ago or even 10 years ago most j
of them had never even dreamed
of having a doctor in their vil
lage, or a road that would allow j
them to get oui to market or j
any feeling that they could par-1
ticipate in the affairs of their
country.
They were tucked away in the
backway of the world and civili
zation with all the things mov
ing by, leaving their village pretty
much the same as it had been for
centuries. And suddenly now in
Latin America, Africa and in
Asia they're waking up and they j
are demanding not only freedom
—this is really almost the easiest
part—but they're demanding an
opportunity to share more justly
on a broader basis with the po
tential growth and development
of their country.
Now this is an enormous pow
erful force, and it's a force that
we do not thoroughly understand.
I think most of the troubles we
have gotten into these last years
have been our failure to under
stand these forces and understand
how deep it runs or also how
closely related it is in many ways
to our own concepts and ideas
and ideals and objectives, even
though the people who are active
in it often look so different and
appear to think so differently.
Actually if you start to explore
this revolution you find we have
a great deal in common with it.
And then as somewhat part of
this revolution, but having come
under totalitarian controls, is

China; f»50.000,000 people awak
| ing also to the future under a
totalitarian, communist dictator
ship, with enormous plans, enor
mous programs and with some
very great and fundamental dis
advantages as they move to carry
out their objectives.
These disadvantages, these
shortages that exist in China in
my mind, for the long haul, may
be much more important to us
i than the fact that China is com
munist, unpleasant though this
latter fact may be.
This time it is reinforced by
another factor which is not. very
well understood in America or,
indeed, even in Europe. That is
the fact that China is also a
have-not country in the modern
industrial sense of the word in
at least two or three very impor
tant categories.
First of all, she has only about
two acres of cultivated land for
every rural family. On that two
acres of cultivated land, the Chi
nese people have to raise the
food for their families, raise the
j food for the city people, and some
food for export. China is also
short of oil. Her reserves of oil
are very limited and she is now
! thought to import 75 per cent of
jail her oil from the Soviet Union.
She has manganese and she has
tin and she has coal, iron and
I other resources, but she lacks par
j ticularly these two basic needs:
land and oil. Just to the south
and southeast of her are areas
: which are not overly populated,
j I'm speaking particularly of Su
; matra, Malaya and Cambodia,
! Viet Nam, Thailand and Burma,
where there are great major re
sources, not fully used by any
means, a potential of oil develop
ment, much land, good sun, goo<l
soil, an opportunity for two or
three crops per year.
And the pressure which may
grow on this Peking government
to expand in this direction is very
great. It's one of the basic facts
of life as we look at Asia. And
then there is also another chal
lenge: the challenge of the Soviet
Union, becoming in two short gen
erations the second industrial
power in the world. Enormously
powerful and growing at the rate
! of something like eight per cent
j a year, graduating perhaps as
| many as twice as many engineers
and scientists as we do a year,
and we all know them to be very
able individuals indeed.
And behind all this there's a
| fourth force, and this is the force
'of the new weapons, this hideous
; new capacity that we've developed
to slough off a huge segment of
' mankind with nuclear bombs and
i missiles and other contraptions.
! Mankind has always had rather
! a weakness for war, but fortu
! nately in the past we weren't able
; to hurt each other to any great
j degree until this century.
And then we perfected the art
1 of killing to a very fine point.
I Unhappily these new nuclear
j weapons are making the prospect
l of war even more impressive, and
i I think most of us will agree that
somehow, someway, this must be
j prevented.
Yet we're no brighter as indi
viduals than our parents. We
i probably have no more concept
I of living together—or not much
more concept—and this threat is
very great, because while no one
might want to start a nuclear
war, the chance of a failure of
communication, miscalculation;
the chance of somebody in panic
;or fear may pull that hideous
trigger is very much there and
very much present.
Now this is the world that we
face in the beginning of the 1960'5.
It's a very, very difficult, com
plex, dangerous, but in many
ways a very promising world in
which almost anything is possible,
either good or bad. Now what do
we want from this world? What
do we want as our part of it?
! What role would we like to play?
Well, I think most Americans—
!or at least many of us—would
say, "Well, we'd just be delighted
to play an isolationist role and
try to pull away from this and
let the world go by and enjoy our
high standard of living and hope
we can make a better society here
and let the world go its own way."
I think we also know that this
is impossible. This Is simply not
going to be. We're either going
to make our place in this world,
we're going to become a construc
tive part of it, or the world in
the future will pass us by with
all kinds of consequences that are
very difficult to foresee. Well, all
right, we have to deal with the
world; how do we do it and what
do we want?
Well, the first thing we'd like
to have happen is we'd like the
: right to survive. We just don't
| want to get blown lip. Rut I also
| think it's clear to us as we start
to analyze the problems about

paigning in this part of the coun
try and also across the Middle
West and I'll be continuing to do
this for many weeks to come. But
I'm glad to come here because I
like very much to talk to people
your age, because I really feel
that you have a big, big task to
do here.
I have a feeling sometimes
that you understand it better than
my generation. That's because
perhaps I know a great many of
you of your age.
I think you're probably going
to do a lot better than we've done.
At the same time I ask you to
be very tolerant in your views
about us. After all, all the things
that have happened these last 30
years have been unexpected and
I can't remember a single course
or a single professor at Yale Uni
versity that prepared me in the
least way for the kind of world
in which we have to live.
This has really been a differ
ent world and, of course, in the
last 20 years the world has really
changed at a fantastic speed. The
First World War destroyed most
of the imperial development and
the patterns of Europe and the
Second World War destroyed even
more. If you think of the changes
that have taken place since 1945,
it really leaves you almost breath
less.
There were 50 nations in the
U.N. in 1945. There are now very
nearly 100 nations. Something
close to a billion people have won
their freedom from colonialism.
There has been a fantastic spread- j
ing all over the world of the |
knowledge of the new technology,
the new opportunities that await
people once this new technology
can be put to work in their coun
tries.
The whole world is waking up.
with an enormous impact on us
and other more settled parts of
the world. And the next admin
istration, be it headed by Mr.
Nixon or Mr. Kennedy, is going
to face an enormous challenge.
,We have really arrived, I be
lieve, at a sort of decisive turn
ing point in history. It seems to
me to be something like 1860
where there's a sharp dividing
line in the whole historical proc-!
ess. I don't mean we're about to
have a civil war, although it some- j
times sounds that way when you
read some of those political
speeches.
What I simply mean is that
the forces that are alive today are |
going to press us to re-examine 1
ourselves as we never have be
fore; re-examine our relations;
with the world, and I'm sure we're |
going to have to come up with a
lot of fresh ideas and fresh think-'
ing, if we're going to deal at all
adequately with the world that!
lies ahead.
Now what are the forces with
which we have to contend? The
first force of all is the world
revolution to which I referred.!
"The revolution of rising expec
tations," as Adlai Stevenson and
others have called it, the revolu
tion of people all across this world
who have suddenly awakened to
the enormous possibility that sci
ence and technology have placed
within their grasp.
Everywhere in the most remote
village, people are suddenly com
ing to feel that almost anything
is possible. One hundred years j
ago or even 10 years ago most j
of them had never even dreamed
of having a doctor in their vil
lage, or a road that would allow j
them to get oui to market or j
any feeling that they could par-1
ticipate in the affairs of their
country.
They were tucked away in the
backway of the world and civili
zation with all the things mov
ing by, leaving their village pretty
much the same as it had been for
centuries. And suddenly now in
Latin America, Africa and in
Asia they're waking up and they j
are demanding not only freedom
—this is really almost the easiest
part—but they're demanding an
opportunity to share more justly
on a broader basis with the po
tential growth and development
of their country.
Now this is an enormous pow
erful force, and it's a force that
we do not thoroughly understand.
I think most of the troubles we
have gotten into these last years
have been our failure to under
stand these forces and understand
how deep it runs or also how
closely related it is in many ways
to our own concepts and ideas
and ideals and objectives, even
though the people who are active
in it often look so different and
appear to think so differently.
Actually if you start to explore
this revolution you find we have
a great deal in common with it.
And then as somewhat part of
this revolution, but having come
under totalitarian controls, is

China; f»50.000,000 people awak
| ing also to the future under a
totalitarian, communist dictator
ship, with enormous plans, enor
mous programs and with some
very great and fundamental dis
advantages as they move to carry
out their objectives.
These disadvantages, these
shortages that exist in China in
my mind, for the long haul, may
be much more important to us
i than the fact that China is com
munist, unpleasant though this
latter fact may be.
This time it is reinforced by
another factor which is not. very
well understood in America or,
indeed, even in Europe. That is
the fact that China is also a
have-not country in the modern
industrial sense of the word in
at least two or three very impor
tant categories.
First of all, she has only about
two acres of cultivated land for
every rural family. On that two
acres of cultivated land, the Chi
nese people have to raise the
food for their families, raise the
j food for the city people, and some
food for export. China is also
short of oil. Her reserves of oil
are very limited and she is now
! thought to import 75 per cent of
jail her oil from the Soviet Union.
She has manganese and she has
tin and she has coal, iron and
I other resources, but she lacks par
j ticularly these two basic needs:
land and oil. Just to the south
and southeast of her are areas
: which are not overly populated,
j I'm speaking particularly of Su
; matra, Malaya and Cambodia,
! Viet Nam, Thailand and Burma,
where there are great major re
sources, not fully used by any
means, a potential of oil develop
ment, much land, good sun, goo<l
soil, an opportunity for two or
three crops per year.
And the pressure which may
grow on this Peking government
to expand in this direction is very
great. It's one of the basic facts
of life as we look at Asia. And
then there is also another chal
lenge: the challenge of the Soviet
Union, becoming in two short gen
erations the second industrial
power in the world. Enormously
powerful and growing at the rate
! of something like eight per cent
j a year, graduating perhaps as
| many as twice as many engineers
and scientists as we do a year,
and we all know them to be very
able individuals indeed.
And behind all this there's a
| fourth force, and this is the force
'of the new weapons, this hideous
; new capacity that we've developed
to slough off a huge segment of
' mankind with nuclear bombs and
i missiles and other contraptions.
! Mankind has always had rather
! a weakness for war, but fortu
! nately in the past we weren't able
; to hurt each other to any great
j degree until this century.
And then we perfected the art
1 of killing to a very fine point.
I Unhappily these new nuclear
j weapons are making the prospect
l of war even more impressive, and
i I think most of us will agree that
somehow, someway, this must be
j prevented.
Yet we're no brighter as indi
viduals than our parents. We
i probably have no more concept
I of living together—or not much
more concept—and this threat is
very great, because while no one
might want to start a nuclear
war, the chance of a failure of
communication, miscalculation;
the chance of somebody in panic
;or fear may pull that hideous
trigger is very much there and
very much present.
Now this is the world that we
face in the beginning of the 1960'5.
It's a very, very difficult, com
plex, dangerous, but in many
ways a very promising world in
which almost anything is possible,
either good or bad. Now what do
we want from this world? What
do we want as our part of it?
! What role would we like to play?
Well, I think most Americans—
!or at least many of us—would
say, "Well, we'd just be delighted
to play an isolationist role and
try to pull away from this and
let the world go by and enjoy our
high standard of living and hope
we can make a better society here
and let the world go its own way."
I think we also know that this
is impossible. This Is simply not
going to be. We're either going
to make our place in this world,
we're going to become a construc
tive part of it, or the world in
the future will pass us by with
all kinds of consequences that are
very difficult to foresee. Well, all
right, we have to deal with the
world; how do we do it and what
do we want?
Well, the first thing we'd like
to have happen is we'd like the
: right to survive. We just don't
| want to get blown lip. Rut I also
| think it's clear to us as we start
to analyze the problems about

| being' blown up, that this is not
a simple question.
Again you can't just make it go
away. You certainly can't avoir!
destruction by simply not build
ing an adequate air force, army,
navy and defense. You have to
be able to defend yourself to gain
the kind of time with which to
deal with all these forces.
Human beings being what they
are, would certainly rush across
any line in the world if it was
not adequately and vigorously de
fended. So we have to have weap
ons and a military system with
which to defend ourselves. It's
an open question as to what state
our affairs are in today.
China is also basically imperi
| alistic in terms of growth of any
single dynasty. When the Mings
rose to power and attempted to
spread into southeast Asia, they
(settled cities and developed cities
(•lose to Africa. When the Man
i chus rose to their height of power
| they rode west to south central
Asia. Now you have a new dyna
| sty under Mao Tsu Tung, this
; time a communist dynasty which
advances this proud expansionist
i view.
Out right on the heels of this,
and I believe that this is a point
tlicit not enough of us are fully
aware of, is the need for a wholly
i and totally now approach to the
question of disarmament and
! arms control.
I met just a week or 10 days
ago some of the really top mili
; tary scientists in America and
spent the better part of a day
with Ihein. These men had not
j been together as a group for
; almost a year. The reason why
i they had not come together was
j they all said they argued too
j much. They all had such violently
; different viewpoints as to how we
; could best defend ourselves, what
■ kind of weapons system should
| be favored in a new budget, and
j so on.
But they said it was easy for
J them to come together now be-
Icause they're all beginning to
I realize that the next President of
! the United States would probably
; be the last President who would
; really have the opportunity to
j find an American answer as far
I as how we could go in this ques
tion of arms control and disarm
ament.
In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out
(Hi us so fast that we at least
have to know where we stand,
what we are prepared to do, how
we can properly and safely nego
tiate with the (Soviet Union, what
we are prepared to compromise
on, what we can't compromise on.
This implies enormous research
programs, not yet even planned
! or even underway, in iho science
of detection and means the next
President must grind out a pro
gram and a policy, purely set our
objectives--and right now our
: objectives are a bit fuzzy and un
j certain.
It means that we really have
to grapple with this question, and
not hope that it will go away,
j under the bland assumption that
: whatever we propose the Soviets
! will turn it down, and therefore
i there's no real pressure on us to
think very hard about this essen
tial question.
i So first we must be sure we
can defend ourselves, but then
we must move on rapidly and
wholeheartedly and vigorously to
try to find our answer to the
1 nuclear dilemma in which the
world has drifted. Now, whether
the Soviet Union would accept a
| proper, rational program of pro
posals by us is an open question.
I did find encouraging that this
group of scientists said that they
had dealt with many Soviet sci
entists in the last few months und
felt that for the first time the
Soviet scientists were beginning
to realize the awful implications
of these scientific developments
in the field of armament. For the
first time they really felt that
they had been sobered by them
and realized that time was really
running out.
Now what is beyond all this?
i Beyond this is the need for the
; American people to secure a new
understanding as to the kind of
1 world in which we are living, to
' make our peace with that world
j • —the non-communist parts of it—

and learn how we can build a real
partnership with the people of
Africa, Asia, Latin America and
Europe; the kind of partnership
that will weld the non-communist
peoples together with a common
set of objectives and purposes and
common approaches to many of
these world problems.
Now to many people that will
sound impossible. It will sound
impossible because the outer
world sometimes looks so very
strange to us. But I would like
to suggest that this is nowhere
near as difficult as it sounds.
Last week, I spent a very inter
esting evening with an Indian
friend, and we talked about Indian
objectives and American objec
tives and I suggested that we
each write down on a piece of
paper what we would like to see
happen in India in the next 10
years. So on his list he wrote,
"I want to see India really inde
pendent, I want to see India se
cure access to capital so she can
build up her industries. I want
to see her spread her education
across the country, so her young
people can learn to read and write
with more doctors and opportuni
ties for all of her people. I'd like
to see her have technical assist
ance from people who could come
to help her w i th o u t political
strings, to see her get the capital
she needs—private and public—
to help her build her country,
again without political strings.
I'd like that she be a free nation,
able to trade with other people,
able to sell her raw materials and
products in a free market and
buying in other countries such as
the U.S.A."
He wrote out his list and I
wrote out mine. The lists were
identical; the lists were almost
precisely the same; the wording
was almost the same. Now you
can do this with a gentleman from
Tanganyika, Kenya or somebody
from Ghana or Nigeria, from Iraq
or Iran or Turkey.
You could do this with almost
any people on earth except those
behind the so-called Iron Curtain
and the communist nations. There
is only one way that you could
make these lists come apart. That
is if you say at the bottom: "You
must take our side in the Cold
War. You must be part of the
American bloc. You must be to
tally on our side, committed to
our efforts, in opposition to those
of the Soviet Union. If you add
that must, you'll destroy the asso
ciation. If you leave it off, you'll
find yourself with an extraordi
nary rate of agreement with the
people of the world who reject

I communism as vigorously as wen
i do. i
I The interesting and fascinating
, development of the last two weeks
is that Mr. Khrushchev has come
to understand us, and this, I be- ;
lieve, is why he is trying to blow
I the U.N. sky high as an operat
ing, administrative agency. Mr. j
I Khrushchev has come to see
'something which our State De
partment has belatedly come to
see, if it has seen it at all, and
that is our interest and those of
the new African nations, the new j
Latin American and Asian na-.
! tions, the non-communist nations
! of Europe, are very, very similar
i indeed. We want freedom, inde
pendence, prosperity, security,;
freedom of communication, free
dom of trade.
Now Mr. Khrushchev comes to
see this, he understands that the
i U.N. and its great majority of
new nations has become a very
important force in blocking his
own efforts to dominate Africa,
to secure his foothold in the Con
go, to move into Latin America,
through Cuba or wiiatever access
he may attempt. And therefore
he would like to destroy the U.N. !
as an operating agency and keep
it purely as a debating society,
where, of course, he can show off
his very extraordinary talents
with the odd specialized agencies
small enough to have no really
important role to play.
When we propose to him to lot i
us turn over the problems of I
Africa to the U.N. let us say to I
! the people of the Soviet Union j
; we will put all of our economic |
I assistance through the U.N.; we
j will agree that there will be no |
I arms race in Africa with you
j feeding one country and we an
, other; that we will agree with
you on a great U.N. civil service
i so that the peoples of these new
j nations can hire whoever they I
I need, whether it be a mathematics j
i teacher or an agricultural special-,
i ist, through the U.N., paying them i
their regular local salaries with I
I an additional salary increment i
paid by the U.N. to bring it up I
i to an international level. That we;
will let the whole operation of
the technical assistance of the
j U.N. in the world go through U.N.
rather than through cold war
j channels. We will propose an
i African adjunct to the world
court to help settle the disputes'
of Africa.
If we propose these things, the 1
Soviet Union takes fright. It takes
fright because they know they'll
not be bucking the United States,
but the United Nations, and this
lies of course behind Mr. Khrush

chev's discovery that the U.N. as |
an operating and administrative
body does not inn in line with j
his interests.
1 believe that when he left the
Soviet Union he did not intend
to make the speech that he made
at the U.N. I believe this all de
veloped during the trip abroad,
as he saw his whole effort in the
Congo come to a grinding stop.
In ihe 36 pages of Mr. Khrush
chev's speech, the first 30 pages
are relatively innocuous. The last
six pages are violent and vigor
ous and obviously were added
later.
So we have this chance, we
have this community of interests

with the world, if only we'll help
it to develop and grow.
Approximately one-half of Representative Chester Bowles"
Wednesday speech appears on today's editorial page. The other
half will appear tomorrow.
We presume that the appearanee of this speech in full will
raise a cry of "more Daily partisanship." All we con say is that
this is not so. Bowies' speech was basically nonpartisan and bril
liantly analyzed what America's foreign policy should he, whether
there is a Republican or Democratic I'resident.

fended. So we have to have weap
ons and a military system with
which to defend ourselves. It's
an open question as to what state
our affairs are in today.
China is also basically imperi
| alistic in terms of growth of any
single dynasty. When the Mings
rose to power and attempted to
spread into southeast Asia, they
(settled cities and developed cities
(•lose to Africa. When the Man
i chus rose to their height of power
| they rode west to south central
Asia. Now you have a new dyna
| sty under Mao Tsu Tung, this
; time a communist dynasty which
advances this proud expansionist
i view.
Out right on the heels of this,
and I believe that this is a point
tlicit not enough of us are fully
aware of, is the need for a wholly
i and totally now approach to the
question of disarmament and
! arms control.
I met just a week or 10 days
ago some of the really top mili
; tary scientists in America and
spent the better part of a day
with Ihein. These men had not
j been together as a group for
; almost a year. The reason why
i they had not come together was
j they all said they argued too
j much. They all had such violently
; different viewpoints as to how we
; could best defend ourselves, what
■ kind of weapons system should
| be favored in a new budget, and
j so on.
But they said it was easy for
J them to come together now be-
Icause they're all beginning to
I realize that the next President of
! the United States would probably
; be the last President who would
; really have the opportunity to
j find an American answer as far
I as how we could go in this ques
tion of arms control and disarm
ament.
In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out
(Hi us so fast that we at least
have to know where we stand,
what we are prepared to do, how
we can properly and safely nego
tiate with the (Soviet Union, what
we are prepared to compromise
on, what we can't compromise on.
This implies enormous research
programs, not yet even planned
! or even underway, in iho science
of detection and means the next
President must grind out a pro
gram and a policy, purely set our
objectives--and right now our
: objectives are a bit fuzzy and un
j certain.
It means that we really have
to grapple with this question, and
not hope that it will go away,
j under the bland assumption that
: whatever we propose the Soviets
! will turn it down, and therefore
i there's no real pressure on us to
think very hard about this essen
tial question.
i So first we must be sure we
can defend ourselves, but then
we must move on rapidly and
wholeheartedly and vigorously to
try to find our answer to the
1 nuclear dilemma in which the
world has drifted. Now, whether
the Soviet Union would accept a
| proper, rational program of pro
posals by us is an open question.
I did find encouraging that this
group of scientists said that they
had dealt with many Soviet sci
entists in the last few months und
felt that for the first time the
Soviet scientists were beginning
to realize the awful implications
of these scientific developments
in the field of armament. For the
first time they really felt that
they had been sobered by them
and realized that time was really
running out.
Now what is beyond all this?
i Beyond this is the need for the
; American people to secure a new
understanding as to the kind of
1 world in which we are living, to
' make our peace with that world
j • —the non-communist parts of it—

and learn how we can build a real
partnership with the people of
Africa, Asia, Latin America and
Europe; the kind of partnership
that will weld the non-communist
peoples together with a common
set of objectives and purposes and
common approaches to many of
these world problems.
Now to many people that will
sound impossible. It will sound
impossible because the outer
world sometimes looks so very
strange to us. But I would like
to suggest that this is nowhere
near as difficult as it sounds.
Last week, I spent a very inter
esting evening with an Indian
friend, and we talked about Indian
objectives and American objec
tives and I suggested that we
each write down on a piece of
paper what we would like to see
happen in India in the next 10
years. So on his list he wrote,
"I want to see India really inde
pendent, I want to see India se
cure access to capital so she can
build up her industries. I want
to see her spread her education
across the country, so her young
people can learn to read and write
with more doctors and opportuni
ties for all of her people. I'd like
to see her have technical assist
ance from people who could come
to help her w i th o u t political
strings, to see her get the capital
she needs—private and public—
to help her build her country,
again without political strings.
I'd like that she be a free nation,
able to trade with other people,
able to sell her raw materials and
products in a free market and
buying in other countries such as
the U.S.A."
He wrote out his list and I
wrote out mine. The lists were
identical; the lists were almost
precisely the same; the wording
was almost the same. Now you
can do this with a gentleman from
Tanganyika, Kenya or somebody
from Ghana or Nigeria, from Iraq
or Iran or Turkey.
You could do this with almost
any people on earth except those
behind the so-called Iron Curtain
and the communist nations. There
is only one way that you could
make these lists come apart. That
is if you say at the bottom: "You
must take our side in the Cold
War. You must be part of the
American bloc. You must be to
tally on our side, committed to
our efforts, in opposition to those
of the Soviet Union. If you add
that must, you'll destroy the asso
ciation. If you leave it off, you'll
find yourself with an extraordi
nary rate of agreement with the
people of the world who reject

I communism as vigorously as wen
i do. i
I The interesting and fascinating
, development of the last two weeks
is that Mr. Khrushchev has come
to understand us, and this, I be- ;
lieve, is why he is trying to blow
I the U.N. sky high as an operat
ing, administrative agency. Mr. j
I Khrushchev has come to see
'something which our State De
partment has belatedly come to
see, if it has seen it at all, and
that is our interest and those of
the new African nations, the new j
Latin American and Asian na-.
! tions, the non-communist nations
! of Europe, are very, very similar
i indeed. We want freedom, inde
pendence, prosperity, security,;
freedom of communication, free
dom of trade.
Now Mr. Khrushchev comes to
see this, he understands that the
i U.N. and its great majority of
new nations has become a very
important force in blocking his
own efforts to dominate Africa,
to secure his foothold in the Con
go, to move into Latin America,
through Cuba or wiiatever access
he may attempt. And therefore
he would like to destroy the U.N. !
as an operating agency and keep
it purely as a debating society,
where, of course, he can show off
his very extraordinary talents
with the odd specialized agencies
small enough to have no really
important role to play.
When we propose to him to lot i
us turn over the problems of I
Africa to the U.N. let us say to I
! the people of the Soviet Union j
; we will put all of our economic |
I assistance through the U.N.; we
j will agree that there will be no |
I arms race in Africa with you
j feeding one country and we an
, other; that we will agree with
you on a great U.N. civil service
i so that the peoples of these new
j nations can hire whoever they I
I need, whether it be a mathematics j
i teacher or an agricultural special-,
i ist, through the U.N., paying them i
their regular local salaries with I
I an additional salary increment i
paid by the U.N. to bring it up I
i to an international level. That we;
will let the whole operation of
the technical assistance of the
j U.N. in the world go through U.N.
rather than through cold war
j channels. We will propose an
i African adjunct to the world
court to help settle the disputes'
of Africa.
If we propose these things, the 1
Soviet Union takes fright. It takes
fright because they know they'll
not be bucking the United States,
but the United Nations, and this
lies of course behind Mr. Khrush

chev's discovery that the U.N. as |
an operating and administrative
body does not inn in line with j
his interests.
1 believe that when he left the
Soviet Union he did not intend
to make the speech that he made
at the U.N. I believe this all de
veloped during the trip abroad,
as he saw his whole effort in the
Congo come to a grinding stop.
In ihe 36 pages of Mr. Khrush
chev's speech, the first 30 pages
are relatively innocuous. The last
six pages are violent and vigor
ous and obviously were added
later.
So we have this chance, we
have this community of interests

with the world, if only we'll help
it to develop and grow.
Approximately one-half of Representative Chester Bowles"
Wednesday speech appears on today's editorial page. The other
half will appear tomorrow.
We presume that the appearanee of this speech in full will
raise a cry of "more Daily partisanship." All we con say is that
this is not so. Bowies' speech was basically nonpartisan and bril
liantly analyzed what America's foreign policy should he, whether
there is a Republican or Democratic I'resident.

T've been doing a lot of cam
paigning in this part of the coun
try and also across the Middle
West and I'll be continuing to do
this for many weeks to come. But
I'm glad to come here because I
like very much to talk to people
your age, because I really feel
that you have a big, big task to
do here.
I have a feeling sometimes
that you understand it better than
my generation. That's because
perhaps I know a great many of
you of your age.
I think you're probably going
to do a lot better than we've done.
At the same time I ask you to
be very tolerant in your views
about us. After all, all the things
that have happened these last 30
years have been unexpected and
I can't remember a single course
or a single professor at Yale Uni
versity that prepared me in the
least way for the kind of world
in which we have to live.
This has really been a differ
ent world and, of course, in the
last 20 years the world has really
changed at a fantastic speed. The
First World War destroyed most
of the imperial development and
the patterns of Europe and the
Second World War destroyed even
more. If you think of the changes
that have taken place since 1945,
it really leaves you almost breath
less.
There were 50 nations in the
U.N. in 1945. There are now very
nearly 100 nations. Something
close to a billion people have won
their freedom from colonialism.
There has been a fantastic spread- j
ing all over the world of the |
knowledge of the new technology,
the new opportunities that await
people once this new technology
can be put to work in their coun
tries.
The whole world is waking up.
with an enormous impact on us
and other more settled parts of
the world. And the next admin
istration, be it headed by Mr.
Nixon or Mr. Kennedy, is going
to face an enormous challenge.
,We have really arrived, I be
lieve, at a sort of decisive turn
ing point in history. It seems to
me to be something like 1860
where there's a sharp dividing
line in the whole historical proc-!
ess. I don't mean we're about to
have a civil war, although it some- j
times sounds that way when you
read some of those political
speeches.
What I simply mean is that
the forces that are alive today are |
going to press us to re-examine 1
ourselves as we never have be
fore; re-examine our relations;
with the world, and I'm sure we're |
going to have to come up with a
lot of fresh ideas and fresh think-'
ing, if we're going to deal at all
adequately with the world that!
lies ahead.
Now what are the forces with
which we have to contend? The
first force of all is the world
revolution to which I referred.!
"The revolution of rising expec
tations," as Adlai Stevenson and
others have called it, the revolu
tion of people all across this world
who have suddenly awakened to
the enormous possibility that sci
ence and technology have placed
within their grasp.
Everywhere in the most remote
village, people are suddenly com
ing to feel that almost anything
is possible. One hundred years j
ago or even 10 years ago most j
of them had never even dreamed
of having a doctor in their vil
lage, or a road that would allow j
them to get oui to market or j
any feeling that they could par-1
ticipate in the affairs of their
country.
They were tucked away in the
backway of the world and civili
zation with all the things mov
ing by, leaving their village pretty
much the same as it had been for
centuries. And suddenly now in
Latin America, Africa and in
Asia they're waking up and they j
are demanding not only freedom
—this is really almost the easiest
part—but they're demanding an
opportunity to share more justly
on a broader basis with the po
tential growth and development
of their country.
Now this is an enormous pow
erful force, and it's a force that
we do not thoroughly understand.
I think most of the troubles we
have gotten into these last years
have been our failure to under
stand these forces and understand
how deep it runs or also how
closely related it is in many ways
to our own concepts and ideas
and ideals and objectives, even
though the people who are active
in it often look so different and
appear to think so differently.
Actually if you start to explore
this revolution you find we have
a great deal in common with it.
And then as somewhat part of
this revolution, but having come
under totalitarian controls, is

China; f»50.000,000 people awak
| ing also to the future under a
totalitarian, communist dictator
ship, with enormous plans, enor
mous programs and with some
very great and fundamental dis
advantages as they move to carry
out their objectives.
These disadvantages, these
shortages that exist in China in
my mind, for the long haul, may
be much more important to us
i than the fact that China is com
munist, unpleasant though this
latter fact may be.
This time it is reinforced by
another factor which is not. very
well understood in America or,
indeed, even in Europe. That is
the fact that China is also a
have-not country in the modern
industrial sense of the word in
at least two or three very impor
tant categories.
First of all, she has only about
two acres of cultivated land for
every rural family. On that two
acres of cultivated land, the Chi
nese people have to raise the
food for their families, raise the
j food for the city people, and some
food for export. China is also
short of oil. Her reserves of oil
are very limited and she is now
! thought to import 75 per cent of
jail her oil from the Soviet Union.
She has manganese and she has
tin and she has coal, iron and
I other resources, but she lacks par
j ticularly these two basic needs:
land and oil. Just to the south
and southeast of her are areas
: which are not overly populated,
j I'm speaking particularly of Su
; matra, Malaya and Cambodia,
! Viet Nam, Thailand and Burma,
where there are great major re
sources, not fully used by any
means, a potential of oil develop
ment, much land, good sun, goo<l
soil, an opportunity for two or
three crops per year.
And the pressure which may
grow on this Peking government
to expand in this direction is very
great. It's one of the basic facts
of life as we look at Asia. And
then there is also another chal
lenge: the challenge of the Soviet
Union, becoming in two short gen
erations the second industrial
power in the world. Enormously
powerful and growing at the rate
! of something like eight per cent
j a year, graduating perhaps as
| many as twice as many engineers
and scientists as we do a year,
and we all know them to be very
able individuals indeed.
And behind all this there's a
| fourth force, and this is the force
'of the new weapons, this hideous
; new capacity that we've developed
to slough off a huge segment of
' mankind with nuclear bombs and
i missiles and other contraptions.
! Mankind has always had rather
! a weakness for war, but fortu
! nately in the past we weren't able
; to hurt each other to any great
j degree until this century.
And then we perfected the art
1 of killing to a very fine point.
I Unhappily these new nuclear
j weapons are making the prospect
l of war even more impressive, and
i I think most of us will agree that
somehow, someway, this must be
j prevented.
Yet we're no brighter as indi
viduals than our parents. We
i probably have no more concept
I of living together—or not much
more concept—and this threat is
very great, because while no one
might want to start a nuclear
war, the chance of a failure of
communication, miscalculation;
the chance of somebody in panic
;or fear may pull that hideous
trigger is very much there and
very much present.
Now this is the world that we
face in the beginning of the 1960'5.
It's a very, very difficult, com
plex, dangerous, but in many
ways a very promising world in
which almost anything is possible,
either good or bad. Now what do
we want from this world? What
do we want as our part of it?
! What role would we like to play?
Well, I think most Americans—
!or at least many of us—would
say, "Well, we'd just be delighted
to play an isolationist role and
try to pull away from this and
let the world go by and enjoy our
high standard of living and hope
we can make a better society here
and let the world go its own way."
I think we also know that this
is impossible. This Is simply not
going to be. We're either going
to make our place in this world,
we're going to become a construc
tive part of it, or the world in
the future will pass us by with
all kinds of consequences that are
very difficult to foresee. Well, all
right, we have to deal with the
world; how do we do it and what
do we want?
Well, the first thing we'd like
to have happen is we'd like the
: right to survive. We just don't
| want to get blown lip. Rut I also
| think it's clear to us as we start
to analyze the problems about

| being' blown up, that this is not
a simple question.
Again you can't just make it go
away. You certainly can't avoir!
destruction by simply not build
ing an adequate air force, army,
navy and defense. You have to
be able to defend yourself to gain
the kind of time with which to
deal with all these forces.
Human beings being what they
are, would certainly rush across
any line in the world if it was
not adequately and vigorously de
fended. So we have to have weap
ons and a military system with
which to defend ourselves. It's
an open question as to what state
our affairs are in today.

to do a lot better than we've done.
At the same time I ask you to
be very tolerant in your views
about us. After all, all the things
that have happened these last 30
years have been unexpected and
I can't remember a single course
or a single professor at Yale Uni
versity that prepared me in the
least way for the kind of world
in which we have to live.
This has really been a differ
ent world and, of course, in the
last 20 years the world has really
changed at a fantastic speed. The
First World War destroyed most
of the imperial development and
the patterns of Europe and the
Second World War destroyed even
more. If you think of the changes
that have taken place since 1945,
it really leaves you almost breath
less.
There were 50 nations in the
U.N. in 1945. There are now very
nearly 100 nations. Something
close to a billion people have won
their freedom from colonialism.
There has been a fantastic spread- j
ing all over the world of the |
knowledge of the new technology,
the new opportunities that await
people once this new technology
can be put to work in their coun
tries.
The whole world is waking up.
with an enormous impact on us
and other more settled parts of
the world. And the next admin
istration, be it headed by Mr.
Nixon or Mr. Kennedy, is going
to face an enormous challenge.
,We have really arrived, I be
lieve, at a sort of decisive turn
ing point in history. It seems to
me to be something like 1860
where there's a sharp dividing
line in the whole historical proc-!
ess. I don't mean we're about to
have a civil war, although it some- j
times sounds that way when you
read some of those political
speeches.
What I simply mean is that
the forces that are alive today are |
going to press us to re-examine 1
ourselves as we never have be
fore; re-examine our relations;
with the world, and I'm sure we're |
going to have to come up with a
lot of fresh ideas and fresh think-'
ing, if we're going to deal at all
adequately with the world that!
lies ahead.
Now what are the forces with
which we have to contend? The
first force of all is the world
revolution to which I referred.!
"The revolution of rising expec
tations," as Adlai Stevenson and
others have called it, the revolu
tion of people all across this world
who have suddenly awakened to
the enormous possibility that sci
ence and technology have placed
within their grasp.
Everywhere in the most remote
village, people are suddenly com
ing to feel that almost anything
is possible. One hundred years j
ago or even 10 years ago most j
of them had never even dreamed
of having a doctor in their vil
lage, or a road that would allow j
them to get oui to market or j
any feeling that they could par-1
ticipate in the affairs of their
country.
They were tucked away in the
backway of the world and civili
zation with all the things mov
ing by, leaving their village pretty
much the same as it had been for
centuries. And suddenly now in
Latin America, Africa and in
Asia they're waking up and they j
are demanding not only freedom
—this is really almost the easiest
part—but they're demanding an
opportunity to share more justly
on a broader basis with the po
tential growth and development
of their country.
Now this is an enormous pow
erful force, and it's a force that
we do not thoroughly understand.
I think most of the troubles we
have gotten into these last years
have been our failure to under
stand these forces and understand
how deep it runs or also how
closely related it is in many ways
to our own concepts and ideas
and ideals and objectives, even
though the people who are active
in it often look so different and
appear to think so differently.
Actually if you start to explore
this revolution you find we have
a great deal in common with it.
And then as somewhat part of
this revolution, but having come
under totalitarian controls, is

China; f»50.000,000 people awak
| ing also to the future under a
totalitarian, communist dictator
ship, with enormous plans, enor
mous programs and with some
very great and fundamental dis
advantages as they move to carry
out their objectives.
These disadvantages, these
shortages that exist in China in
my mind, for the long haul, may
be much more important to us
i than the fact that China is com
munist, unpleasant though this
latter fact may be.
This time it is reinforced by
another factor which is not. very
well understood in America or,
indeed, even in Europe. That is
the fact that China is also a
have-not country in the modern
industrial sense of the word in
at least two or three very impor
tant categories.
First of all, she has only about
two acres of cultivated land for
every rural family. On that two
acres of cultivated land, the Chi
nese people have to raise the
food for their families, raise the
j food for the city people, and some
food for export. China is also
short of oil. Her reserves of oil
are very limited and she is now
! thought to import 75 per cent of
jail her oil from the Soviet Union.
She has manganese and she has
tin and she has coal, iron and
I other resources, but she lacks par
j ticularly these two basic needs:
land and oil. Just to the south
and southeast of her are areas
: which are not overly populated,
j I'm speaking particularly of Su
; matra, Malaya and Cambodia,
! Viet Nam, Thailand and Burma,
where there are great major re
sources, not fully used by any
means, a potential of oil develop
ment, much land, good sun, goo<l
soil, an opportunity for two or
three crops per year.
And the pressure which may
grow on this Peking government
to expand in this direction is very
great. It's one of the basic facts
of life as we look at Asia. And
then there is also another chal
lenge: the challenge of the Soviet
Union, becoming in two short gen
erations the second industrial
power in the world. Enormously
powerful and growing at the rate
! of something like eight per cent
j a year, graduating perhaps as
| many as twice as many engineers
and scientists as we do a year,
and we all know them to be very
able individuals indeed.
And behind all this there's a
| fourth force, and this is the force
'of the new weapons, this hideous
; new capacity that we've developed
to slough off a huge segment of
' mankind with nuclear bombs and
i missiles and other contraptions.
! Mankind has always had rather
! a weakness for war, but fortu
! nately in the past we weren't able
; to hurt each other to any great
j degree until this century.
And then we perfected the art
1 of killing to a very fine point.
I Unhappily these new nuclear
j weapons are making the prospect
l of war even more impressive, and
i I think most of us will agree that
somehow, someway, this must be
j prevented.
Yet we're no brighter as indi
viduals than our parents. We
i probably have no more concept
I of living together—or not much
more concept—and this threat is
very great, because while no one
might want to start a nuclear
war, the chance of a failure of
communication, miscalculation;
the chance of somebody in panic
;or fear may pull that hideous
trigger is very much there and
very much present.
Now this is the world that we
face in the beginning of the 1960'5.
It's a very, very difficult, com
plex, dangerous, but in many
ways a very promising world in
which almost anything is possible,
either good or bad. Now what do
we want from this world? What
do we want as our part of it?
! What role would we like to play?
Well, I think most Americans—
!or at least many of us—would
say, "Well, we'd just be delighted
to play an isolationist role and
try to pull away from this and
let the world go by and enjoy our
high standard of living and hope
we can make a better society here
and let the world go its own way."
I think we also know that this
is impossible. This Is simply not
going to be. We're either going
to make our place in this world,
we're going to become a construc
tive part of it, or the world in
the future will pass us by with
all kinds of consequences that are
very difficult to foresee. Well, all
right, we have to deal with the
world; how do we do it and what
do we want?
Well, the first thing we'd like
to have happen is we'd like the
: right to survive. We just don't
| want to get blown lip. Rut I also
| think it's clear to us as we start
to analyze the problems about

| being' blown up, that this is not
a simple question.
Again you can't just make it go
away. You certainly can't avoir!
destruction by simply not build
ing an adequate air force, army,
navy and defense. You have to
be able to defend yourself to gain
the kind of time with which to
deal with all these forces.
Human beings being what they
are, would certainly rush across
any line in the world if it was
not adequately and vigorously de
fended. So we have to have weap
ons and a military system with
which to defend ourselves. It's
an open question as to what state
our affairs are in today.
China is also basically imperi
| alistic in terms of growth of any
single dynasty. When the Mings
rose to power and attempted to
spread into southeast Asia, they
(settled cities and developed cities
(•lose to Africa. When the Man
i chus rose to their height of power
| they rode west to south central
Asia. Now you have a new dyna
| sty under Mao Tsu Tung, this
; time a communist dynasty which
advances this proud expansionist
i view.
Out right on the heels of this,
and I believe that this is a point
tlicit not enough of us are fully
aware of, is the need for a wholly
i and totally now approach to the
question of disarmament and
! arms control.
I met just a week or 10 days
ago some of the really top mili
; tary scientists in America and
spent the better part of a day
with Ihein. These men had not
j been together as a group for
; almost a year. The reason why
i they had not come together was
j they all said they argued too
j much. They all had such violently
; different viewpoints as to how we
; could best defend ourselves, what
■ kind of weapons system should
| be favored in a new budget, and
j so on.
But they said it was easy for
J them to come together now be-
Icause they're all beginning to
I realize that the next President of
! the United States would probably
; be the last President who would
; really have the opportunity to
j find an American answer as far
I as how we could go in this ques
tion of arms control and disarm
ament.
In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out
(Hi us so fast that we at least
have to know where we stand,
what we are prepared to do, how
we can properly and safely nego
tiate with the (Soviet Union, what
we are prepared to compromise
on, what we can't compromise on.
This implies enormous research
programs, not yet even planned
! or even underway, in iho science
of detection and means the next
President must grind out a pro
gram and a policy, purely set our
objectives--and right now our
: objectives are a bit fuzzy and un
j certain.
It means that we really have
to grapple with this question, and
not hope that it will go away,
j under the bland assumption that
: whatever we propose the Soviets
! will turn it down, and therefore
i there's no real pressure on us to
think very hard about this essen
tial question.
i So first we must be sure we
can defend ourselves, but then
we must move on rapidly and
wholeheartedly and vigorously to
try to find our answer to the
1 nuclear dilemma in which the
world has drifted. Now, whether
the Soviet Union would accept a
| proper, rational program of pro
posals by us is an open question.
I did find encouraging that this
group of scientists said that they
had dealt with many Soviet sci
entists in the last few months und
felt that for the first time the
Soviet scientists were beginning
to realize the awful implications
of these scientific developments
in the field of armament. For the
first time they really felt that
they had been sobered by them
and realized that time was really
running out.
Now what is beyond all this?
i Beyond this is the need for the
; American people to secure a new
understanding as to the kind of
1 world in which we are living, to
' make our peace with that world
j • —the non-communist parts of it—

and learn how we can build a real
partnership with the people of
Africa, Asia, Latin America and
Europe; the kind of partnership
that will weld the non-communist
peoples together with a common
set of objectives and purposes and
common approaches to many of
these world problems.
Now to many people that will
sound impossible. It will sound
impossible because the outer
world sometimes looks so very
strange to us. But I would like
to suggest that this is nowhere
near as difficult as it sounds.
Last week, I spent a very inter
esting evening with an Indian
friend, and we talked about Indian
objectives and American objec
tives and I suggested that we
each write down on a piece of
paper what we would like to see
happen in India in the next 10
years. So on his list he wrote,
"I want to see India really inde
pendent, I want to see India se
cure access to capital so she can
build up her industries. I want
to see her spread her education
across the country, so her young
people can learn to read and write
with more doctors and opportuni
ties for all of her people. I'd like
to see her have technical assist
ance from people who could come
to help her w i th o u t political
strings, to see her get the capital
she needs—private and public—
to help her build her country,
again without political strings.
I'd like that she be a free nation,
able to trade with other people,
able to sell her raw materials and
products in a free market and
buying in other countries such as
the U.S.A."
He wrote out his list and I
wrote out mine. The lists were
identical; the lists were almost
precisely the same; the wording
was almost the same. Now you
can do this with a gentleman from
Tanganyika, Kenya or somebody
from Ghana or Nigeria, from Iraq
or Iran or Turkey.
You could do this with almost
any people on earth except those
behind the so-called Iron Curtain
and the communist nations. There
is only one way that you could
make these lists come apart. That
is if you say at the bottom: "You
must take our side in the Cold
War. You must be part of the
American bloc. You must be to
tally on our side, committed to
our efforts, in opposition to those
of the Soviet Union. If you add
that must, you'll destroy the asso
ciation. If you leave it off, you'll
find yourself with an extraordi
nary rate of agreement with the
people of the world who reject

I communism as vigorously as wen
i do. i
I The interesting and fascinating
, development of the last two weeks
is that Mr. Khrushchev has come
to understand us, and this, I be- ;
lieve, is why he is trying to blow
I the U.N. sky high as an operat
ing, administrative agency. Mr. j
I Khrushchev has come to see
'something which our State De
partment has belatedly come to
see, if it has seen it at all, and
that is our interest and those of
the new African nations, the new j
Latin American and Asian na-.
! tions, the non-communist nations
! of Europe, are very, very similar
i indeed. We want freedom, inde
pendence, prosperity, security,;
freedom of communication, free
dom of trade.
Now Mr. Khrushchev comes to
see this, he understands that the
i U.N. and its great majority of
new nations has become a very
important force in blocking his
own efforts to dominate Africa,
to secure his foothold in the Con
go, to move into Latin America,
through Cuba or wiiatever access
he may attempt. And therefore
he would like to destroy the U.N. !
as an operating agency and keep
it purely as a debating society,
where, of course, he can show off
his very extraordinary talents
with the odd specialized agencies
small enough to have no really
important role to play.
When we propose to him to lot i
us turn over the problems of I
Africa to the U.N. let us say to I
! the people of the Soviet Union j
; we will put all of our economic |
I assistance through the U.N.; we
j will agree that there will be no |
I arms race in Africa with you
j feeding one country and we an
, other; that we will agree with
you on a great U.N. civil service
i so that the peoples of these new
j nations can hire whoever they I
I need, whether it be a mathematics j
i teacher or an agricultural special-,
i ist, through the U.N., paying them i
their regular local salaries with I
I an additional salary increment i
paid by the U.N. to bring it up I
i to an international level. That we;
will let the whole operation of
the technical assistance of the
j U.N. in the world go through U.N.
rather than through cold war
j channels. We will propose an
i African adjunct to the world
court to help settle the disputes'
of Africa.
If we propose these things, the 1
Soviet Union takes fright. It takes
fright because they know they'll
not be bucking the United States,
but the United Nations, and this
lies of course behind Mr. Khrush

chev's discovery that the U.N. as |
an operating and administrative
body does not inn in line with j
his interests.
1 believe that when he left the
Soviet Union he did not intend
to make the speech that he made
at the U.N. I believe this all de
veloped during the trip abroad,
as he saw his whole effort in the
Congo come to a grinding stop.
In ihe 36 pages of Mr. Khrush
chev's speech, the first 30 pages
are relatively innocuous. The last
six pages are violent and vigor
ous and obviously were added
later.
So we have this chance, we
have this community of interests

with the world, if only we'll help
it to develop and grow.
Approximately one-half of Representative Chester Bowles"
Wednesday speech appears on today's editorial page. The other
half will appear tomorrow.
We presume that the appearanee of this speech in full will
raise a cry of "more Daily partisanship." All we con say is that
this is not so. Bowies' speech was basically nonpartisan and bril
liantly analyzed what America's foreign policy should he, whether
there is a Republican or Democratic I'resident.

T've been doing a lot of cam
paigning in this part of the coun
try and also across the Middle
West and I'll be continuing to do
this for many weeks to come. But
I'm glad to come here because I
like very much to talk to people
your age, because I really feel
that you have a big, big task to
do here.
I have a feeling sometimes
that you understand it better than
my generation. That's because
perhaps I know a great many of
you of your age.
I think you're probably going
to do a lot better than we've done.
At the same time I ask you to

| sty under Mao Tsu Tung, this
; time a communist dynasty which
advances this proud expansionist
i view.
Out right on the heels of this,
and I believe that this is a point
tlicit not enough of us are fully
aware of, is the need for a wholly
i and totally now approach to the
question of disarmament and
! arms control.
I met just a week or 10 days
ago some of the really top mili
; tary scientists in America and
spent the better part of a day
with Ihein. These men had not
j been together as a group for
; almost a year. The reason why
i they had not come together was
j they all said they argued too
j much. They all had such violently
; different viewpoints as to how we
; could best defend ourselves, what
■ kind of weapons system should
| be favored in a new budget, and
j so on.
But they said it was easy for
J them to come together now be-
Icause they're all beginning to
I realize that the next President of
! the United States would probably
; be the last President who would
; really have the opportunity to
j find an American answer as far
I as how we could go in this ques
tion of arms control and disarm
ament.
In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out
(Hi us so fast that we at least
have to know where we stand,
what we are prepared to do, how
we can properly and safely nego
tiate with the (Soviet Union, what
we are prepared to compromise
on, what we can't compromise on.
This implies enormous research
programs, not yet even planned
! or even underway, in iho science
of detection and means the next
President must grind out a pro
gram and a policy, purely set our
objectives--and right now our
: objectives are a bit fuzzy and un
j certain.
It means that we really have
to grapple with this question, and
not hope that it will go away,
j under the bland assumption that
: whatever we propose the Soviets
! will turn it down, and therefore
i there's no real pressure on us to
think very hard about this essen
tial question.
i So first we must be sure we
can defend ourselves, but then
we must move on rapidly and
wholeheartedly and vigorously to
try to find our answer to the
1 nuclear dilemma in which the
world has drifted. Now, whether
the Soviet Union would accept a
| proper, rational program of pro
posals by us is an open question.
I did find encouraging that this
group of scientists said that they
had dealt with many Soviet sci
entists in the last few months und
felt that for the first time the
Soviet scientists were beginning
to realize the awful implications
of these scientific developments
in the field of armament. For the
first time they really felt that
they had been sobered by them
and realized that time was really
running out.
Now what is beyond all this?
i Beyond this is the need for the
; American people to secure a new
understanding as to the kind of
1 world in which we are living, to
' make our peace with that world
j • —the non-communist parts of it—

and learn how we can build a real
partnership with the people of
Africa, Asia, Latin America and
Europe; the kind of partnership
that will weld the non-communist
peoples together with a common
set of objectives and purposes and
common approaches to many of
these world problems.
Now to many people that will
sound impossible. It will sound
impossible because the outer
world sometimes looks so very
strange to us. But I would like
to suggest that this is nowhere
near as difficult as it sounds.
Last week, I spent a very inter
esting evening with an Indian
friend, and we talked about Indian
objectives and American objec
tives and I suggested that we
each write down on a piece of
paper what we would like to see
happen in India in the next 10
years. So on his list he wrote,
"I want to see India really inde
pendent, I want to see India se
cure access to capital so she can
build up her industries. I want
to see her spread her education
across the country, so her young
people can learn to read and write
with more doctors and opportuni
ties for all of her people. I'd like
to see her have technical assist
ance from people who could come
to help her w i th o u t political
strings, to see her get the capital
she needs—private and public—
to help her build her country,
again without political strings.
I'd like that she be a free nation,
able to trade with other people,
able to sell her raw materials and
products in a free market and
buying in other countries such as
the U.S.A."
He wrote out his list and I
wrote out mine. The lists were
identical; the lists were almost
precisely the same; the wording
was almost the same. Now you
can do this with a gentleman from
Tanganyika, Kenya or somebody
from Ghana or Nigeria, from Iraq
or Iran or Turkey.
You could do this with almost
any people on earth except those
behind the so-called Iron Curtain
and the communist nations. There
is only one way that you could
make these lists come apart. That
is if you say at the bottom: "You
must take our side in the Cold
War. You must be part of the
American bloc. You must be to
tally on our side, committed to
our efforts, in opposition to those
of the Soviet Union. If you add
that must, you'll destroy the asso
ciation. If you leave it off, you'll
find yourself with an extraordi
nary rate of agreement with the
people of the world who reject

I communism as vigorously as wen
i do. i
I The interesting and fascinating
, development of the last two weeks
is that Mr. Khrushchev has come
to understand us, and this, I be- ;
lieve, is why he is trying to blow
I the U.N. sky high as an operat
ing, administrative agency. Mr. j
I Khrushchev has come to see
'something which our State De
partment has belatedly come to
see, if it has seen it at all, and
that is our interest and those of
the new African nations, the new j
Latin American and Asian na-.
! tions, the non-communist nations
! of Europe, are very, very similar
i indeed. We want freedom, inde
pendence, prosperity, security,;
freedom of communication, free
dom of trade.
Now Mr. Khrushchev comes to
see this, he understands that the
i U.N. and its great majority of
new nations has become a very
important force in blocking his
own efforts to dominate Africa,
to secure his foothold in the Con
go, to move into Latin America,
through Cuba or wiiatever access
he may attempt. And therefore
he would like to destroy the U.N. !
as an operating agency and keep
it purely as a debating society,
where, of course, he can show off
his very extraordinary talents
with the odd specialized agencies
small enough to have no really
important role to play.
When we propose to him to lot i
us turn over the problems of I
Africa to the U.N. let us say to I
! the people of the Soviet Union j
; we will put all of our economic |
I assistance through the U.N.; we
j will agree that there will be no |
I arms race in Africa with you
j feeding one country and we an
, other; that we will agree with
you on a great U.N. civil service
i so that the peoples of these new
j nations can hire whoever they I
I need, whether it be a mathematics j
i teacher or an agricultural special-,
i ist, through the U.N., paying them i
their regular local salaries with I
I an additional salary increment i
paid by the U.N. to bring it up I
i to an international level. That we;
will let the whole operation of
the technical assistance of the
j U.N. in the world go through U.N.
rather than through cold war
j channels. We will propose an
i African adjunct to the world
court to help settle the disputes'
of Africa.
If we propose these things, the 1
Soviet Union takes fright. It takes
fright because they know they'll
not be bucking the United States,
but the United Nations, and this
lies of course behind Mr. Khrush

chev's discovery that the U.N. as |
an operating and administrative
body does not inn in line with j
his interests.
1 believe that when he left the
Soviet Union he did not intend
to make the speech that he made
at the U.N. I believe this all de
veloped during the trip abroad,
as he saw his whole effort in the
Congo come to a grinding stop.
In ihe 36 pages of Mr. Khrush
chev's speech, the first 30 pages
are relatively innocuous. The last
six pages are violent and vigor
ous and obviously were added
later.
So we have this chance, we
have this community of interests

with the world, if only we'll help
it to develop and grow.
Approximately one-half of Representative Chester Bowles"
Wednesday speech appears on today's editorial page. The other
half will appear tomorrow.
We presume that the appearanee of this speech in full will
raise a cry of "more Daily partisanship." All we con say is that
this is not so. Bowies' speech was basically nonpartisan and bril
liantly analyzed what America's foreign policy should he, whether
there is a Republican or Democratic I'resident.

T've been doing a lot of cam
paigning in this part of the coun
try and also across the Middle
West and I'll be continuing to do
this for many weeks to come. But
I'm glad to come here because I
like very much to talk to people
your age, because I really feel
that you have a big, big task to
do here.
I have a feeling sometimes
that you understand it better than
my generation. That's because
perhaps I know a great many of
you of your age.
I think you're probably going
to do a lot better than we've done.
At the same time I ask you to
be very tolerant in your views
about us. After all, all the things
that have happened these last 30
years have been unexpected and
I can't remember a single course
or a single professor at Yale Uni
versity that prepared me in the
least way for the kind of world
in which we have to live.
This has really been a differ
ent world and, of course, in the
last 20 years the world has really
changed at a fantastic speed. The
First World War destroyed most
of the imperial development and
the patterns of Europe and the
Second World War destroyed even
more. If you think of the changes
that have taken place since 1945,
it really leaves you almost breath
less.
There were 50 nations in the
U.N. in 1945. There are now very
nearly 100 nations. Something
close to a billion people have won
their freedom from colonialism.
There has been a fantastic spread- j
ing all over the world of the |
knowledge of the new technology,
the new opportunities that await
people once this new technology
can be put to work in their coun
tries.
The whole world is waking up.
with an enormous impact on us
and other more settled parts of
the world. And the next admin
istration, be it headed by Mr.
Nixon or Mr. Kennedy, is going
to face an enormous challenge.
,We have really arrived, I be
lieve, at a sort of decisive turn
ing point in history. It seems to
me to be something like 1860
where there's a sharp dividing
line in the whole historical proc-!
ess. I don't mean we're about to
have a civil war, although it some- j
times sounds that way when you
read some of those political
speeches.
What I simply mean is that
the forces that are alive today are |
going to press us to re-examine 1
ourselves as we never have be
fore; re-examine our relations;
with the world, and I'm sure we're |
going to have to come up with a
lot of fresh ideas and fresh think-'
ing, if we're going to deal at all
adequately with the world that!
lies ahead.
Now what are the forces with
which we have to contend? The
first force of all is the world
revolution to which I referred.!
"The revolution of rising expec
tations," as Adlai Stevenson and
others have called it, the revolu
tion of people all across this world
who have suddenly awakened to
the enormous possibility that sci
ence and technology have placed
within their grasp.
Everywhere in the most remote
village, people are suddenly com
ing to feel that almost anything
is possible. One hundred years j
ago or even 10 years ago most j
of them had never even dreamed
of having a doctor in their vil
lage, or a road that would allow j
them to get oui to market or j
any feeling that they could par-1
ticipate in the affairs of their
country.
They were tucked away in the
backway of the world and civili
zation with all the things mov
ing by, leaving their village pretty
much the same as it had been for
centuries. And suddenly now in
Latin America, Africa and in
Asia they're waking up and they j
are demanding not only freedom
—this is really almost the easiest
part—but they're demanding an
opportunity to share more justly
on a broader basis with the po
tential growth and development
of their country.
Now this is an enormous pow
erful force, and it's a force that
we do not thoroughly understand.
I think most of the troubles we
have gotten into these last years
have been our failure to under
stand these forces and understand
how deep it runs or also how
closely related it is in many ways
to our own concepts and ideas
and ideals and objectives, even
though the people who are active
in it often look so different and
appear to think so differently.
Actually if you start to explore
this revolution you find we have
a great deal in common with it.
And then as somewhat part of
this revolution, but having come
under totalitarian controls, is

China; f»50.000,000 people awak
| ing also to the future under a
totalitarian, communist dictator
ship, with enormous plans, enor
mous programs and with some
very great and fundamental dis
advantages as they move to carry
out their objectives.
These disadvantages, these
shortages that exist in China in
my mind, for the long haul, may
be much more important to us
i than the fact that China is com
munist, unpleasant though this
latter fact may be.
This time it is reinforced by
another factor which is not. very
well understood in America or,
indeed, even in Europe. That is
the fact that China is also a
have-not country in the modern
industrial sense of the word in
at least two or three very impor
tant categories.
First of all, she has only about
two acres of cultivated land for
every rural family. On that two
acres of cultivated land, the Chi
nese people have to raise the
food for their families, raise the
j food for the city people, and some
food for export. China is also
short of oil. Her reserves of oil
are very limited and she is now
! thought to import 75 per cent of
jail her oil from the Soviet Union.
She has manganese and she has
tin and she has coal, iron and
I other resources, but she lacks par
j ticularly these two basic needs:
land and oil. Just to the south
and southeast of her are areas
: which are not overly populated,
j I'm speaking particularly of Su
; matra, Malaya and Cambodia,
! Viet Nam, Thailand and Burma,
where there are great major re
sources, not fully used by any
means, a potential of oil develop
ment, much land, good sun, goo<l
soil, an opportunity for two or
three crops per year.
And the pressure which may
grow on this Peking government
to expand in this direction is very
great. It's one of the basic facts
of life as we look at Asia. And
then there is also another chal
lenge: the challenge of the Soviet
Union, becoming in two short gen
erations the second industrial
power in the world. Enormously
powerful and growing at the rate
! of something like eight per cent
j a year, graduating perhaps as
| many as twice as many engineers
and scientists as we do a year,
and we all know them to be very
able individuals indeed.
And behind all this there's a
| fourth force, and this is the force
'of the new weapons, this hideous
; new capacity that we've developed
to slough off a huge segment of
' mankind with nuclear bombs and
i missiles and other contraptions.
! Mankind has always had rather
! a weakness for war, but fortu
! nately in the past we weren't able
; to hurt each other to any great
j degree until this century.
And then we perfected the art
1 of killing to a very fine point.
I Unhappily these new nuclear
j weapons are making the prospect
l of war even more impressive, and
i I think most of us will agree that
somehow, someway, this must be
j prevented.
Yet we're no brighter as indi
viduals than our parents. We
i probably have no more concept
I of living together—or not much
more concept—and this threat is
very great, because while no one
might want to start a nuclear
war, the chance of a failure of
communication, miscalculation;
the chance of somebody in panic
;or fear may pull that hideous
trigger is very much there and
very much present.
Now this is the world that we
face in the beginning of the 1960'5.
It's a very, very difficult, com
plex, dangerous, but in many
ways a very promising world in
which almost anything is possible,
either good or bad. Now what do
we want from this world? What
do we want as our part of it?
! What role would we like to play?
Well, I think most Americans—
!or at least many of us—would
say, "Well, we'd just be delighted
to play an isolationist role and
try to pull away from this and
let the world go by and enjoy our
high standard of living and hope
we can make a better society here
and let the world go its own way."
I think we also know that this
is impossible. This Is simply not
going to be. We're either going
to make our place in this world,
we're going to become a construc
tive part of it, or the world in
the future will pass us by with
all kinds of consequences that are
very difficult to foresee. Well, all
right, we have to deal with the
world; how do we do it and what
do we want?
Well, the first thing we'd like
to have happen is we'd like the
: right to survive. We just don't
| want to get blown lip. Rut I also
| think it's clear to us as we start
to analyze the problems about

| being' blown up, that this is not
a simple question.
Again you can't just make it go
away. You certainly can't avoir!
destruction by simply not build
ing an adequate air force, army,
navy and defense. You have to
be able to defend yourself to gain
the kind of time with which to
deal with all these forces.
Human beings being what they
are, would certainly rush across
any line in the world if it was
not adequately and vigorously de
fended. So we have to have weap
ons and a military system with
which to defend ourselves. It's
an open question as to what state
our affairs are in today.
China is also basically imperi
| alistic in terms of growth of any
single dynasty. When the Mings
rose to power and attempted to
spread into southeast Asia, they
(settled cities and developed cities
(•lose to Africa. When the Man
i chus rose to their height of power
| they rode west to south central
Asia. Now you have a new dyna
| sty under Mao Tsu Tung, this
; time a communist dynasty which
advances this proud expansionist
i view.

and I believe that this is a point

First World War destroyed most
of the imperial development and
the patterns of Europe and the
Second World War destroyed even
more. If you think of the changes
that have taken place since 1945,
it really leaves you almost breath
less.
There were 50 nations in the
U.N. in 1945. There are now very
nearly 100 nations. Something
close to a billion people have won
their freedom from colonialism.
There has been a fantastic spread- j
ing all over the world of the |
knowledge of the new technology,
the new opportunities that await
people once this new technology
can be put to work in their coun
tries.
The whole world is waking up.
with an enormous impact on us
and other more settled parts of
the world. And the next admin
istration, be it headed by Mr.
Nixon or Mr. Kennedy, is going
to face an enormous challenge.
,We have really arrived, I be
lieve, at a sort of decisive turn
ing point in history. It seems to
me to be something like 1860
where there's a sharp dividing
line in the whole historical proc-!
ess. I don't mean we're about to
have a civil war, although it some- j
times sounds that way when you
read some of those political
speeches.
What I simply mean is that
the forces that are alive today are |
going to press us to re-examine 1
ourselves as we never have be
fore; re-examine our relations;
with the world, and I'm sure we're |
going to have to come up with a
lot of fresh ideas and fresh think-'
ing, if we're going to deal at all
adequately with the world that!
lies ahead.
Now what are the forces with
which we have to contend? The
first force of all is the world
revolution to which I referred.!
"The revolution of rising expec
tations," as Adlai Stevenson and
others have called it, the revolu
tion of people all across this world
who have suddenly awakened to
the enormous possibility that sci
ence and technology have placed
within their grasp.
Everywhere in the most remote
village, people are suddenly com
ing to feel that almost anything
is possible. One hundred years j
ago or even 10 years ago most j
of them had never even dreamed
of having a doctor in their vil
lage, or a road that would allow j
them to get oui to market or j
any feeling that they could par-1
ticipate in the affairs of their
country.
They were tucked away in the
backway of the world and civili
zation with all the things mov
ing by, leaving their village pretty
much the same as it had been for
centuries. And suddenly now in
Latin America, Africa and in
Asia they're waking up and they j
are demanding not only freedom
—this is really almost the easiest
part—but they're demanding an
opportunity to share more justly
on a broader basis with the po
tential growth and development
of their country.
Now this is an enormous pow
erful force, and it's a force that
we do not thoroughly understand.
I think most of the troubles we
have gotten into these last years
have been our failure to under
stand these forces and understand
how deep it runs or also how
closely related it is in many ways
to our own concepts and ideas
and ideals and objectives, even
though the people who are active
in it often look so different and
appear to think so differently.
Actually if you start to explore
this revolution you find we have
a great deal in common with it.
And then as somewhat part of
this revolution, but having come
under totalitarian controls, is

China; f»50.000,000 people awak
| ing also to the future under a
totalitarian, communist dictator
ship, with enormous plans, enor
mous programs and with some
very great and fundamental dis
advantages as they move to carry
out their objectives.
These disadvantages, these
shortages that exist in China in
my mind, for the long haul, may
be much more important to us
i than the fact that China is com
munist, unpleasant though this
latter fact may be.
This time it is reinforced by
another factor which is not. very
well understood in America or,
indeed, even in Europe. That is
the fact that China is also a
have-not country in the modern
industrial sense of the word in
at least two or three very impor
tant categories.
First of all, she has only about
two acres of cultivated land for
every rural family. On that two
acres of cultivated land, the Chi
nese people have to raise the
food for their families, raise the
j food for the city people, and some
food for export. China is also
short of oil. Her reserves of oil
are very limited and she is now
! thought to import 75 per cent of
jail her oil from the Soviet Union.
She has manganese and she has
tin and she has coal, iron and
I other resources, but she lacks par
j ticularly these two basic needs:
land and oil. Just to the south
and southeast of her are areas
: which are not overly populated,
j I'm speaking particularly of Su
; matra, Malaya and Cambodia,
! Viet Nam, Thailand and Burma,
where there are great major re
sources, not fully used by any
means, a potential of oil develop
ment, much land, good sun, goo<l
soil, an opportunity for two or
three crops per year.
And the pressure which may
grow on this Peking government
to expand in this direction is very
great. It's one of the basic facts
of life as we look at Asia. And
then there is also another chal
lenge: the challenge of the Soviet
Union, becoming in two short gen
erations the second industrial
power in the world. Enormously
powerful and growing at the rate
! of something like eight per cent
j a year, graduating perhaps as
| many as twice as many engineers
and scientists as we do a year,
and we all know them to be very
able individuals indeed.
And behind all this there's a
| fourth force, and this is the force
'of the new weapons, this hideous
; new capacity that we've developed
to slough off a huge segment of
' mankind with nuclear bombs and
i missiles and other contraptions.
! Mankind has always had rather
! a weakness for war, but fortu
! nately in the past we weren't able
; to hurt each other to any great
j degree until this century.
And then we perfected the art
1 of killing to a very fine point.
I Unhappily these new nuclear
j weapons are making the prospect
l of war even more impressive, and
i I think most of us will agree that
somehow, someway, this must be
j prevented.
Yet we're no brighter as indi
viduals than our parents. We
i probably have no more concept
I of living together—or not much
more concept—and this threat is
very great, because while no one
might want to start a nuclear
war, the chance of a failure of
communication, miscalculation;
the chance of somebody in panic
;or fear may pull that hideous
trigger is very much there and
very much present.
Now this is the world that we
face in the beginning of the 1960'5.
It's a very, very difficult, com
plex, dangerous, but in many
ways a very promising world in
which almost anything is possible,
either good or bad. Now what do
we want from this world? What
do we want as our part of it?
! What role would we like to play?
Well, I think most Americans—
!or at least many of us—would
say, "Well, we'd just be delighted
to play an isolationist role and
try to pull away from this and
let the world go by and enjoy our
high standard of living and hope
we can make a better society here
and let the world go its own way."
I think we also know that this
is impossible. This Is simply not
going to be. We're either going
to make our place in this world,
we're going to become a construc
tive part of it, or the world in
the future will pass us by with
all kinds of consequences that are
very difficult to foresee. Well, all
right, we have to deal with the
world; how do we do it and what
do we want?
Well, the first thing we'd like
to have happen is we'd like the
: right to survive. We just don't
| want to get blown lip. Rut I also
| think it's clear to us as we start
to analyze the problems about

| being' blown up, that this is not
a simple question.
Again you can't just make it go
away. You certainly can't avoir!
destruction by simply not build
ing an adequate air force, army,
navy and defense. You have to
be able to defend yourself to gain
the kind of time with which to
deal with all these forces.
Human beings being what they
are, would certainly rush across
any line in the world if it was
not adequately and vigorously de
fended. So we have to have weap
ons and a military system with
which to defend ourselves. It's
an open question as to what state
our affairs are in today.
China is also basically imperi
| alistic in terms of growth of any
single dynasty. When the Mings
rose to power and attempted to
spread into southeast Asia, they
(settled cities and developed cities
(•lose to Africa. When the Man
i chus rose to their height of power
| they rode west to south central
Asia. Now you have a new dyna
| sty under Mao Tsu Tung, this
; time a communist dynasty which
advances this proud expansionist
i view.
Out right on the heels of this,
and I believe that this is a point
tlicit not enough of us are fully
aware of, is the need for a wholly
i and totally now approach to the
question of disarmament and
! arms control.
I met just a week or 10 days
ago some of the really top mili
; tary scientists in America and
spent the better part of a day
with Ihein. These men had not
j been together as a group for
; almost a year. The reason why
i they had not come together was
j they all said they argued too
j much. They all had such violently
; different viewpoints as to how we
; could best defend ourselves, what
■ kind of weapons system should
| be favored in a new budget, and
j so on.
But they said it was easy for
J them to come together now be-
Icause they're all beginning to
I realize that the next President of
! the United States would probably
; be the last President who would
; really have the opportunity to
j find an American answer as far
I as how we could go in this ques
tion of arms control and disarm
ament.
In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out
(Hi us so fast that we at least
have to know where we stand,
what we are prepared to do, how
we can properly and safely nego
tiate with the (Soviet Union, what
we are prepared to compromise
on, what we can't compromise on.
This implies enormous research
programs, not yet even planned
! or even underway, in iho science
of detection and means the next
President must grind out a pro
gram and a policy, purely set our
objectives--and right now our
: objectives are a bit fuzzy and un
j certain.
It means that we really have
to grapple with this question, and
not hope that it will go away,
j under the bland assumption that
: whatever we propose the Soviets
! will turn it down, and therefore
i there's no real pressure on us to
think very hard about this essen
tial question.
i So first we must be sure we
can defend ourselves, but then
we must move on rapidly and
wholeheartedly and vigorously to
try to find our answer to the
1 nuclear dilemma in which the
world has drifted. Now, whether
the Soviet Union would accept a
| proper, rational program of pro
posals by us is an open question.
I did find encouraging that this
group of scientists said that they
had dealt with many Soviet sci
entists in the last few months und
felt that for the first time the
Soviet scientists were beginning
to realize the awful implications
of these scientific developments
in the field of armament. For the
first time they really felt that
they had been sobered by them
and realized that time was really
running out.
Now what is beyond all this?
i Beyond this is the need for the
; American people to secure a new
understanding as to the kind of
1 world in which we are living, to
' make our peace with that world
j • —the non-communist parts of it—

and learn how we can build a real
partnership with the people of
Africa, Asia, Latin America and
Europe; the kind of partnership
that will weld the non-communist
peoples together with a common
set of objectives and purposes and
common approaches to many of
these world problems.
Now to many people that will
sound impossible. It will sound
impossible because the outer
world sometimes looks so very
strange to us. But I would like
to suggest that this is nowhere
near as difficult as it sounds.
Last week, I spent a very inter
esting evening with an Indian
friend, and we talked about Indian
objectives and American objec
tives and I suggested that we
each write down on a piece of
paper what we would like to see
happen in India in the next 10
years. So on his list he wrote,
"I want to see India really inde
pendent, I want to see India se
cure access to capital so she can
build up her industries. I want
to see her spread her education
across the country, so her young
people can learn to read and write
with more doctors and opportuni
ties for all of her people. I'd like
to see her have technical assist
ance from people who could come
to help her w i th o u t political
strings, to see her get the capital
she needs—private and public—
to help her build her country,
again without political strings.
I'd like that she be a free nation,
able to trade with other people,
able to sell her raw materials and
products in a free market and
buying in other countries such as
the U.S.A."
He wrote out his list and I
wrote out mine. The lists were
identical; the lists were almost
precisely the same; the wording
was almost the same. Now you
can do this with a gentleman from
Tanganyika, Kenya or somebody
from Ghana or Nigeria, from Iraq
or Iran or Turkey.
You could do this with almost
any people on earth except those
behind the so-called Iron Curtain
and the communist nations. There
is only one way that you could
make these lists come apart. That
is if you say at the bottom: "You
must take our side in the Cold
War. You must be part of the
American bloc. You must be to
tally on our side, committed to
our efforts, in opposition to those
of the Soviet Union. If you add
that must, you'll destroy the asso
ciation. If you leave it off, you'll
find yourself with an extraordi
nary rate of agreement with the
people of the world who reject

I communism as vigorously as wen
i do. i
I The interesting and fascinating
, development of the last two weeks
is that Mr. Khrushchev has come
to understand us, and this, I be- ;
lieve, is why he is trying to blow
I the U.N. sky high as an operat
ing, administrative agency. Mr. j
I Khrushchev has come to see
'something which our State De
partment has belatedly come to
see, if it has seen it at all, and
that is our interest and those of
the new African nations, the new j
Latin American and Asian na-.
! tions, the non-communist nations
! of Europe, are very, very similar
i indeed. We want freedom, inde
pendence, prosperity, security,;
freedom of communication, free
dom of trade.
Now Mr. Khrushchev comes to
see this, he understands that the
i U.N. and its great majority of
new nations has become a very
important force in blocking his
own efforts to dominate Africa,
to secure his foothold in the Con
go, to move into Latin America,
through Cuba or wiiatever access
he may attempt. And therefore
he would like to destroy the U.N. !
as an operating agency and keep
it purely as a debating society,
where, of course, he can show off
his very extraordinary talents
with the odd specialized agencies
small enough to have no really
important role to play.
When we propose to him to lot i
us turn over the problems of I
Africa to the U.N. let us say to I
! the people of the Soviet Union j
; we will put all of our economic |
I assistance through the U.N.; we
j will agree that there will be no |
I arms race in Africa with you
j feeding one country and we an
, other; that we will agree with
you on a great U.N. civil service
i so that the peoples of these new
j nations can hire whoever they I
I need, whether it be a mathematics j
i teacher or an agricultural special-,
i ist, through the U.N., paying them i
their regular local salaries with I
I an additional salary increment i
paid by the U.N. to bring it up I
i to an international level. That we;
will let the whole operation of
the technical assistance of the
j U.N. in the world go through U.N.
rather than through cold war
j channels. We will propose an
i African adjunct to the world
court to help settle the disputes'
of Africa.
If we propose these things, the 1
Soviet Union takes fright. It takes
fright because they know they'll
not be bucking the United States,
but the United Nations, and this
lies of course behind Mr. Khrush

chev's discovery that the U.N. as |
an operating and administrative
body does not inn in line with j
his interests.
1 believe that when he left the
Soviet Union he did not intend
to make the speech that he made
at the U.N. I believe this all de
veloped during the trip abroad,
as he saw his whole effort in the
Congo come to a grinding stop.
In ihe 36 pages of Mr. Khrush
chev's speech, the first 30 pages
are relatively innocuous. The last
six pages are violent and vigor
ous and obviously were added
later.
So we have this chance, we
have this community of interests

with the world, if only we'll help
it to develop and grow.
Approximately one-half of Representative Chester Bowles"
Wednesday speech appears on today's editorial page. The other
half will appear tomorrow.
We presume that the appearanee of this speech in full will
raise a cry of "more Daily partisanship." All we con say is that
this is not so. Bowies' speech was basically nonpartisan and bril
liantly analyzed what America's foreign policy should he, whether
there is a Republican or Democratic I'resident.

T've been doing a lot of cam
paigning in this part of the coun
try and also across the Middle
West and I'll be continuing to do
this for many weeks to come. But
I'm glad to come here because I
like very much to talk to people
your age, because I really feel
that you have a big, big task to
do here.
I have a feeling sometimes
that you understand it better than
my generation. That's because
perhaps I know a great many of
you of your age.
I think you're probably going
to do a lot better than we've done.
At the same time I ask you to
be very tolerant in your views
about us. After all, all the things
that have happened these last 30
years have been unexpected and
I can't remember a single course
or a single professor at Yale Uni
versity that prepared me in the
least way for the kind of world
in which we have to live.
This has really been a differ
ent world and, of course, in the
last 20 years the world has really
changed at a fantastic speed. The
First World War destroyed most
of the imperial development and
the patterns of Europe and the
Second World War destroyed even

j been together as a group for
; almost a year. The reason why
i they had not come together was
j they all said they argued too
j much. They all had such violently
; different viewpoints as to how we
; could best defend ourselves, what
■ kind of weapons system should
| be favored in a new budget, and
j so on.
But they said it was easy for
J them to come together now be-
Icause they're all beginning to
I realize that the next President of
! the United States would probably
; be the last President who would
; really have the opportunity to
j find an American answer as far
I as how we could go in this ques
tion of arms control and disarm
ament.
In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out
(Hi us so fast that we at least
have to know where we stand,
what we are prepared to do, how
we can properly and safely nego
tiate with the (Soviet Union, what
we are prepared to compromise
on, what we can't compromise on.
This implies enormous research
programs, not yet even planned
! or even underway, in iho science
of detection and means the next
President must grind out a pro
gram and a policy, purely set our
objectives--and right now our
: objectives are a bit fuzzy and un
j certain.
It means that we really have
to grapple with this question, and
not hope that it will go away,
j under the bland assumption that
: whatever we propose the Soviets
! will turn it down, and therefore
i there's no real pressure on us to
think very hard about this essen
tial question.
i So first we must be sure we
can defend ourselves, but then
we must move on rapidly and
wholeheartedly and vigorously to
try to find our answer to the
1 nuclear dilemma in which the
world has drifted. Now, whether
the Soviet Union would accept a
| proper, rational program of pro
posals by us is an open question.
I did find encouraging that this
group of scientists said that they
had dealt with many Soviet sci
entists in the last few months und
felt that for the first time the
Soviet scientists were beginning
to realize the awful implications
of these scientific developments
in the field of armament. For the
first time they really felt that
they had been sobered by them
and realized that time was really
running out.
Now what is beyond all this?
i Beyond this is the need for the
; American people to secure a new
understanding as to the kind of
1 world in which we are living, to
' make our peace with that world
j • —the non-communist parts of it—

and learn how we can build a real
partnership with the people of
Africa, Asia, Latin America and
Europe; the kind of partnership
that will weld the non-communist
peoples together with a common
set of objectives and purposes and
common approaches to many of
these world problems.
Now to many people that will
sound impossible. It will sound
impossible because the outer
world sometimes looks so very
strange to us. But I would like
to suggest that this is nowhere
near as difficult as it sounds.
Last week, I spent a very inter
esting evening with an Indian
friend, and we talked about Indian
objectives and American objec
tives and I suggested that we
each write down on a piece of
paper what we would like to see
happen in India in the next 10
years. So on his list he wrote,
"I want to see India really inde
pendent, I want to see India se
cure access to capital so she can
build up her industries. I want
to see her spread her education
across the country, so her young
people can learn to read and write
with more doctors and opportuni
ties for all of her people. I'd like
to see her have technical assist
ance from people who could come
to help her w i th o u t political
strings, to see her get the capital
she needs—private and public—
to help her build her country,
again without political strings.
I'd like that she be a free nation,
able to trade with other people,
able to sell her raw materials and
products in a free market and
buying in other countries such as
the U.S.A."
He wrote out his list and I
wrote out mine. The lists were
identical; the lists were almost
precisely the same; the wording
was almost the same. Now you
can do this with a gentleman from
Tanganyika, Kenya or somebody
from Ghana or Nigeria, from Iraq
or Iran or Turkey.
You could do this with almost
any people on earth except those
behind the so-called Iron Curtain
and the communist nations. There
is only one way that you could
make these lists come apart. That
is if you say at the bottom: "You
must take our side in the Cold
War. You must be part of the
American bloc. You must be to
tally on our side, committed to
our efforts, in opposition to those
of the Soviet Union. If you add
that must, you'll destroy the asso
ciation. If you leave it off, you'll
find yourself with an extraordi
nary rate of agreement with the
people of the world who reject

I communism as vigorously as wen
i do. i
I The interesting and fascinating
, development of the last two weeks
is that Mr. Khrushchev has come
to understand us, and this, I be- ;
lieve, is why he is trying to blow
I the U.N. sky high as an operat
ing, administrative agency. Mr. j
I Khrushchev has come to see
'something which our State De
partment has belatedly come to
see, if it has seen it at all, and
that is our interest and those of
the new African nations, the new j
Latin American and Asian na-.
! tions, the non-communist nations
! of Europe, are very, very similar
i indeed. We want freedom, inde
pendence, prosperity, security,;
freedom of communication, free
dom of trade.
Now Mr. Khrushchev comes to
see this, he understands that the
i U.N. and its great majority of
new nations has become a very
important force in blocking his
own efforts to dominate Africa,
to secure his foothold in the Con
go, to move into Latin America,
through Cuba or wiiatever access
he may attempt. And therefore
he would like to destroy the U.N. !
as an operating agency and keep
it purely as a debating society,
where, of course, he can show off
his very extraordinary talents
with the odd specialized agencies
small enough to have no really
important role to play.
When we propose to him to lot i
us turn over the problems of I
Africa to the U.N. let us say to I
! the people of the Soviet Union j
; we will put all of our economic |
I assistance through the U.N.; we
j will agree that there will be no |
I arms race in Africa with you
j feeding one country and we an
, other; that we will agree with
you on a great U.N. civil service
i so that the peoples of these new
j nations can hire whoever they I
I need, whether it be a mathematics j
i teacher or an agricultural special-,
i ist, through the U.N., paying them i
their regular local salaries with I
I an additional salary increment i
paid by the U.N. to bring it up I
i to an international level. That we;
will let the whole operation of
the technical assistance of the
j U.N. in the world go through U.N.
rather than through cold war
j channels. We will propose an
i African adjunct to the world
court to help settle the disputes'
of Africa.
If we propose these things, the 1
Soviet Union takes fright. It takes
fright because they know they'll
not be bucking the United States,
but the United Nations, and this
lies of course behind Mr. Khrush

chev's discovery that the U.N. as |
an operating and administrative
body does not inn in line with j
his interests.
1 believe that when he left the
Soviet Union he did not intend
to make the speech that he made
at the U.N. I believe this all de
veloped during the trip abroad,
as he saw his whole effort in the
Congo come to a grinding stop.
In ihe 36 pages of Mr. Khrush
chev's speech, the first 30 pages
are relatively innocuous. The last
six pages are violent and vigor
ous and obviously were added
later.
So we have this chance, we
have this community of interests

with the world, if only we'll help
it to develop and grow.
Approximately one-half of Representative Chester Bowles"
Wednesday speech appears on today's editorial page. The other
half will appear tomorrow.
We presume that the appearanee of this speech in full will
raise a cry of "more Daily partisanship." All we con say is that
this is not so. Bowies' speech was basically nonpartisan and bril
liantly analyzed what America's foreign policy should he, whether
there is a Republican or Democratic I'resident.

T've been doing a lot of cam
paigning in this part of the coun
try and also across the Middle
West and I'll be continuing to do
this for many weeks to come. But
I'm glad to come here because I
like very much to talk to people
your age, because I really feel
that you have a big, big task to
do here.
I have a feeling sometimes
that you understand it better than
my generation. That's because
perhaps I know a great many of
you of your age.
I think you're probably going
to do a lot better than we've done.
At the same time I ask you to
be very tolerant in your views
about us. After all, all the things
that have happened these last 30
years have been unexpected and
I can't remember a single course
or a single professor at Yale Uni
versity that prepared me in the
least way for the kind of world
in which we have to live.
This has really been a differ
ent world and, of course, in the
last 20 years the world has really
changed at a fantastic speed. The
First World War destroyed most
of the imperial development and
the patterns of Europe and the
Second World War destroyed even
more. If you think of the changes
that have taken place since 1945,
it really leaves you almost breath
less.
There were 50 nations in the
U.N. in 1945. There are now very
nearly 100 nations. Something
close to a billion people have won
their freedom from colonialism.
There has been a fantastic spread- j
ing all over the world of the |
knowledge of the new technology,
the new opportunities that await
people once this new technology
can be put to work in their coun
tries.
The whole world is waking up.
with an enormous impact on us
and other more settled parts of
the world. And the next admin
istration, be it headed by Mr.
Nixon or Mr. Kennedy, is going
to face an enormous challenge.
,We have really arrived, I be
lieve, at a sort of decisive turn
ing point in history. It seems to
me to be something like 1860
where there's a sharp dividing
line in the whole historical proc-!
ess. I don't mean we're about to
have a civil war, although it some- j
times sounds that way when you
read some of those political
speeches.
What I simply mean is that
the forces that are alive today are |
going to press us to re-examine 1
ourselves as we never have be
fore; re-examine our relations;
with the world, and I'm sure we're |
going to have to come up with a
lot of fresh ideas and fresh think-'
ing, if we're going to deal at all
adequately with the world that!
lies ahead.
Now what are the forces with
which we have to contend? The
first force of all is the world
revolution to which I referred.!
"The revolution of rising expec
tations," as Adlai Stevenson and
others have called it, the revolu
tion of people all across this world
who have suddenly awakened to
the enormous possibility that sci
ence and technology have placed
within their grasp.
Everywhere in the most remote
village, people are suddenly com
ing to feel that almost anything
is possible. One hundred years j
ago or even 10 years ago most j
of them had never even dreamed
of having a doctor in their vil
lage, or a road that would allow j
them to get oui to market or j
any feeling that they could par-1
ticipate in the affairs of their
country.
They were tucked away in the
backway of the world and civili
zation with all the things mov
ing by, leaving their village pretty
much the same as it had been for
centuries. And suddenly now in
Latin America, Africa and in
Asia they're waking up and they j
are demanding not only freedom
—this is really almost the easiest
part—but they're demanding an
opportunity to share more justly
on a broader basis with the po
tential growth and development
of their country.
Now this is an enormous pow
erful force, and it's a force that
we do not thoroughly understand.
I think most of the troubles we
have gotten into these last years
have been our failure to under
stand these forces and understand
how deep it runs or also how
closely related it is in many ways
to our own concepts and ideas
and ideals and objectives, even
though the people who are active
in it often look so different and
appear to think so differently.
Actually if you start to explore
this revolution you find we have
a great deal in common with it.
And then as somewhat part of
this revolution, but having come
under totalitarian controls, is

China; f»50.000,000 people awak
| ing also to the future under a
totalitarian, communist dictator
ship, with enormous plans, enor
mous programs and with some
very great and fundamental dis
advantages as they move to carry
out their objectives.
These disadvantages, these
shortages that exist in China in
my mind, for the long haul, may
be much more important to us
i than the fact that China is com
munist, unpleasant though this
latter fact may be.
This time it is reinforced by
another factor which is not. very
well understood in America or,
indeed, even in Europe. That is
the fact that China is also a
have-not country in the modern
industrial sense of the word in
at least two or three very impor
tant categories.
First of all, she has only about
two acres of cultivated land for
every rural family. On that two
acres of cultivated land, the Chi
nese people have to raise the
food for their families, raise the
j food for the city people, and some
food for export. China is also
short of oil. Her reserves of oil
are very limited and she is now
! thought to import 75 per cent of
jail her oil from the Soviet Union.
She has manganese and she has
tin and she has coal, iron and
I other resources, but she lacks par
j ticularly these two basic needs:
land and oil. Just to the south
and southeast of her are areas
: which are not overly populated,
j I'm speaking particularly of Su
; matra, Malaya and Cambodia,
! Viet Nam, Thailand and Burma,
where there are great major re
sources, not fully used by any
means, a potential of oil develop
ment, much land, good sun, goo<l
soil, an opportunity for two or
three crops per year.
And the pressure which may
grow on this Peking government
to expand in this direction is very
great. It's one of the basic facts
of life as we look at Asia. And
then there is also another chal
lenge: the challenge of the Soviet
Union, becoming in two short gen
erations the second industrial
power in the world. Enormously
powerful and growing at the rate
! of something like eight per cent
j a year, graduating perhaps as
| many as twice as many engineers
and scientists as we do a year,
and we all know them to be very
able individuals indeed.
And behind all this there's a
| fourth force, and this is the force
'of the new weapons, this hideous
; new capacity that we've developed
to slough off a huge segment of
' mankind with nuclear bombs and
i missiles and other contraptions.
! Mankind has always had rather
! a weakness for war, but fortu
! nately in the past we weren't able
; to hurt each other to any great
j degree until this century.
And then we perfected the art
1 of killing to a very fine point.
I Unhappily these new nuclear
j weapons are making the prospect
l of war even more impressive, and
i I think most of us will agree that
somehow, someway, this must be
j prevented.
Yet we're no brighter as indi
viduals than our parents. We
i probably have no more concept
I of living together—or not much
more concept—and this threat is
very great, because while no one
might want to start a nuclear
war, the chance of a failure of
communication, miscalculation;
the chance of somebody in panic
;or fear may pull that hideous
trigger is very much there and
very much present.
Now this is the world that we
face in the beginning of the 1960'5.
It's a very, very difficult, com
plex, dangerous, but in many
ways a very promising world in
which almost anything is possible,
either good or bad. Now what do
we want from this world? What
do we want as our part of it?
! What role would we like to play?
Well, I think most Americans—
!or at least many of us—would
say, "Well, we'd just be delighted
to play an isolationist role and
try to pull away from this and
let the world go by and enjoy our
high standard of living and hope
we can make a better society here
and let the world go its own way."
I think we also know that this
is impossible. This Is simply not
going to be. We're either going
to make our place in this world,
we're going to become a construc
tive part of it, or the world in
the future will pass us by with
all kinds of consequences that are
very difficult to foresee. Well, all
right, we have to deal with the
world; how do we do it and what
do we want?
Well, the first thing we'd like
to have happen is we'd like the
: right to survive. We just don't
| want to get blown lip. Rut I also
| think it's clear to us as we start
to analyze the problems about

| being' blown up, that this is not
a simple question.
Again you can't just make it go
away. You certainly can't avoir!
destruction by simply not build
ing an adequate air force, army,
navy and defense. You have to
be able to defend yourself to gain
the kind of time with which to
deal with all these forces.
Human beings being what they
are, would certainly rush across
any line in the world if it was
not adequately and vigorously de
fended. So we have to have weap
ons and a military system with
which to defend ourselves. It's
an open question as to what state
our affairs are in today.
China is also basically imperi
| alistic in terms of growth of any
single dynasty. When the Mings
rose to power and attempted to
spread into southeast Asia, they
(settled cities and developed cities
(•lose to Africa. When the Man
i chus rose to their height of power
| they rode west to south central
Asia. Now you have a new dyna
| sty under Mao Tsu Tung, this
; time a communist dynasty which
advances this proud expansionist
i view.
Out right on the heels of this,
and I believe that this is a point
tlicit not enough of us are fully
aware of, is the need for a wholly
i and totally now approach to the
question of disarmament and
! arms control.
I met just a week or 10 days
ago some of the really top mili
; tary scientists in America and
spent the better part of a day
with Ihein. These men had not
j been together as a group for
; almost a year. The reason why
i they had not come together was

! the United States would probably
; be the last President who would

In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out

knowledge of the new technology,
the new opportunities that await
people once this new technology
can be put to work in their coun
tries.
The whole world is waking up.
with an enormous impact on us
and other more settled parts of
the world. And the next admin
istration, be it headed by Mr.
Nixon or Mr. Kennedy, is going
to face an enormous challenge.
,We have really arrived, I be
lieve, at a sort of decisive turn
ing point in history. It seems to
me to be something like 1860
where there's a sharp dividing
line in the whole historical proc-!
ess. I don't mean we're about to
have a civil war, although it some- j
times sounds that way when you
read some of those political
speeches.
What I simply mean is that
the forces that are alive today are |
going to press us to re-examine 1
ourselves as we never have be
fore; re-examine our relations;
with the world, and I'm sure we're |
going to have to come up with a
lot of fresh ideas and fresh think-'
ing, if we're going to deal at all
adequately with the world that!
lies ahead.
Now what are the forces with
which we have to contend? The
first force of all is the world
revolution to which I referred.!
"The revolution of rising expec
tations," as Adlai Stevenson and
others have called it, the revolu
tion of people all across this world
who have suddenly awakened to
the enormous possibility that sci
ence and technology have placed
within their grasp.
Everywhere in the most remote
village, people are suddenly com
ing to feel that almost anything
is possible. One hundred years j
ago or even 10 years ago most j
of them had never even dreamed
of having a doctor in their vil
lage, or a road that would allow j
them to get oui to market or j
any feeling that they could par-1
ticipate in the affairs of their
country.
They were tucked away in the
backway of the world and civili
zation with all the things mov
ing by, leaving their village pretty
much the same as it had been for
centuries. And suddenly now in
Latin America, Africa and in
Asia they're waking up and they j
are demanding not only freedom
—this is really almost the easiest
part—but they're demanding an
opportunity to share more justly
on a broader basis with the po
tential growth and development
of their country.
Now this is an enormous pow
erful force, and it's a force that
we do not thoroughly understand.
I think most of the troubles we
have gotten into these last years
have been our failure to under
stand these forces and understand
how deep it runs or also how
closely related it is in many ways
to our own concepts and ideas
and ideals and objectives, even
though the people who are active
in it often look so different and
appear to think so differently.
Actually if you start to explore
this revolution you find we have
a great deal in common with it.
And then as somewhat part of
this revolution, but having come
under totalitarian controls, is

China; f»50.000,000 people awak
| ing also to the future under a
totalitarian, communist dictator
ship, with enormous plans, enor
mous programs and with some
very great and fundamental dis
advantages as they move to carry
out their objectives.
These disadvantages, these
shortages that exist in China in
my mind, for the long haul, may
be much more important to us
i than the fact that China is com
munist, unpleasant though this
latter fact may be.
This time it is reinforced by
another factor which is not. very
well understood in America or,
indeed, even in Europe. That is
the fact that China is also a
have-not country in the modern
industrial sense of the word in
at least two or three very impor
tant categories.
First of all, she has only about
two acres of cultivated land for
every rural family. On that two
acres of cultivated land, the Chi
nese people have to raise the
food for their families, raise the
j food for the city people, and some
food for export. China is also
short of oil. Her reserves of oil
are very limited and she is now
! thought to import 75 per cent of
jail her oil from the Soviet Union.
She has manganese and she has
tin and she has coal, iron and
I other resources, but she lacks par
j ticularly these two basic needs:
land and oil. Just to the south
and southeast of her are areas
: which are not overly populated,
j I'm speaking particularly of Su
; matra, Malaya and Cambodia,
! Viet Nam, Thailand and Burma,
where there are great major re
sources, not fully used by any
means, a potential of oil develop
ment, much land, good sun, goo<l
soil, an opportunity for two or
three crops per year.
And the pressure which may
grow on this Peking government
to expand in this direction is very
great. It's one of the basic facts
of life as we look at Asia. And
then there is also another chal
lenge: the challenge of the Soviet
Union, becoming in two short gen
erations the second industrial
power in the world. Enormously
powerful and growing at the rate
! of something like eight per cent
j a year, graduating perhaps as
| many as twice as many engineers
and scientists as we do a year,
and we all know them to be very
able individuals indeed.
And behind all this there's a
| fourth force, and this is the force
'of the new weapons, this hideous
; new capacity that we've developed
to slough off a huge segment of
' mankind with nuclear bombs and
i missiles and other contraptions.
! Mankind has always had rather
! a weakness for war, but fortu
! nately in the past we weren't able
; to hurt each other to any great
j degree until this century.
And then we perfected the art
1 of killing to a very fine point.
I Unhappily these new nuclear
j weapons are making the prospect
l of war even more impressive, and
i I think most of us will agree that
somehow, someway, this must be
j prevented.
Yet we're no brighter as indi
viduals than our parents. We
i probably have no more concept
I of living together—or not much
more concept—and this threat is
very great, because while no one
might want to start a nuclear
war, the chance of a failure of
communication, miscalculation;
the chance of somebody in panic
;or fear may pull that hideous
trigger is very much there and
very much present.
Now this is the world that we
face in the beginning of the 1960'5.
It's a very, very difficult, com
plex, dangerous, but in many
ways a very promising world in
which almost anything is possible,
either good or bad. Now what do
we want from this world? What
do we want as our part of it?
! What role would we like to play?
Well, I think most Americans—
!or at least many of us—would
say, "Well, we'd just be delighted
to play an isolationist role and
try to pull away from this and
let the world go by and enjoy our
high standard of living and hope
we can make a better society here
and let the world go its own way."
I think we also know that this
is impossible. This Is simply not
going to be. We're either going
to make our place in this world,
we're going to become a construc
tive part of it, or the world in
the future will pass us by with
all kinds of consequences that are
very difficult to foresee. Well, all
right, we have to deal with the
world; how do we do it and what
do we want?
Well, the first thing we'd like
to have happen is we'd like the
: right to survive. We just don't
| want to get blown lip. Rut I also
| think it's clear to us as we start
to analyze the problems about

| being' blown up, that this is not
a simple question.
Again you can't just make it go
away. You certainly can't avoir!
destruction by simply not build
ing an adequate air force, army,
navy and defense. You have to
be able to defend yourself to gain
the kind of time with which to
deal with all these forces.
Human beings being what they
are, would certainly rush across
any line in the world if it was
not adequately and vigorously de
fended. So we have to have weap
ons and a military system with
which to defend ourselves. It's
an open question as to what state
our affairs are in today.
China is also basically imperi
| alistic in terms of growth of any
single dynasty. When the Mings
rose to power and attempted to
spread into southeast Asia, they
(settled cities and developed cities
(•lose to Africa. When the Man
i chus rose to their height of power
| they rode west to south central
Asia. Now you have a new dyna
| sty under Mao Tsu Tung, this
; time a communist dynasty which
advances this proud expansionist
i view.
Out right on the heels of this,
and I believe that this is a point
tlicit not enough of us are fully
aware of, is the need for a wholly
i and totally now approach to the
question of disarmament and
! arms control.
I met just a week or 10 days
ago some of the really top mili
; tary scientists in America and
spent the better part of a day
with Ihein. These men had not
j been together as a group for
; almost a year. The reason why
i they had not come together was
j they all said they argued too
j much. They all had such violently
; different viewpoints as to how we
; could best defend ourselves, what
■ kind of weapons system should
| be favored in a new budget, and
j so on.
But they said it was easy for
J them to come together now be-
Icause they're all beginning to
I realize that the next President of
! the United States would probably
; be the last President who would
; really have the opportunity to
j find an American answer as far
I as how we could go in this ques
tion of arms control and disarm
ament.
In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out
(Hi us so fast that we at least
have to know where we stand,
what we are prepared to do, how
we can properly and safely nego
tiate with the (Soviet Union, what
we are prepared to compromise
on, what we can't compromise on.
This implies enormous research
programs, not yet even planned
! or even underway, in iho science
of detection and means the next
President must grind out a pro
gram and a policy, purely set our
objectives--and right now our
: objectives are a bit fuzzy and un
j certain.
It means that we really have
to grapple with this question, and
not hope that it will go away,
j under the bland assumption that
: whatever we propose the Soviets
! will turn it down, and therefore
i there's no real pressure on us to
think very hard about this essen
tial question.
i So first we must be sure we
can defend ourselves, but then
we must move on rapidly and
wholeheartedly and vigorously to
try to find our answer to the
1 nuclear dilemma in which the
world has drifted. Now, whether
the Soviet Union would accept a
| proper, rational program of pro
posals by us is an open question.
I did find encouraging that this
group of scientists said that they
had dealt with many Soviet sci
entists in the last few months und
felt that for the first time the
Soviet scientists were beginning
to realize the awful implications
of these scientific developments
in the field of armament. For the
first time they really felt that
they had been sobered by them
and realized that time was really
running out.
Now what is beyond all this?
i Beyond this is the need for the
; American people to secure a new
understanding as to the kind of
1 world in which we are living, to
' make our peace with that world
j • —the non-communist parts of it—

and learn how we can build a real
partnership with the people of
Africa, Asia, Latin America and
Europe; the kind of partnership
that will weld the non-communist
peoples together with a common
set of objectives and purposes and
common approaches to many of
these world problems.
Now to many people that will
sound impossible. It will sound
impossible because the outer
world sometimes looks so very
strange to us. But I would like
to suggest that this is nowhere
near as difficult as it sounds.
Last week, I spent a very inter
esting evening with an Indian
friend, and we talked about Indian
objectives and American objec
tives and I suggested that we
each write down on a piece of
paper what we would like to see
happen in India in the next 10
years. So on his list he wrote,
"I want to see India really inde
pendent, I want to see India se
cure access to capital so she can
build up her industries. I want
to see her spread her education
across the country, so her young
people can learn to read and write
with more doctors and opportuni
ties for all of her people. I'd like
to see her have technical assist
ance from people who could come
to help her w i th o u t political
strings, to see her get the capital
she needs—private and public—
to help her build her country,
again without political strings.
I'd like that she be a free nation,
able to trade with other people,
able to sell her raw materials and
products in a free market and
buying in other countries such as
the U.S.A."
He wrote out his list and I
wrote out mine. The lists were
identical; the lists were almost
precisely the same; the wording
was almost the same. Now you
can do this with a gentleman from
Tanganyika, Kenya or somebody
from Ghana or Nigeria, from Iraq
or Iran or Turkey.
You could do this with almost
any people on earth except those
behind the so-called Iron Curtain
and the communist nations. There
is only one way that you could
make these lists come apart. That
is if you say at the bottom: "You
must take our side in the Cold
War. You must be part of the
American bloc. You must be to
tally on our side, committed to
our efforts, in opposition to those
of the Soviet Union. If you add
that must, you'll destroy the asso
ciation. If you leave it off, you'll
find yourself with an extraordi
nary rate of agreement with the
people of the world who reject

I communism as vigorously as wen
i do. i
I The interesting and fascinating
, development of the last two weeks
is that Mr. Khrushchev has come
to understand us, and this, I be- ;
lieve, is why he is trying to blow
I the U.N. sky high as an operat
ing, administrative agency. Mr. j
I Khrushchev has come to see
'something which our State De
partment has belatedly come to
see, if it has seen it at all, and
that is our interest and those of
the new African nations, the new j
Latin American and Asian na-.
! tions, the non-communist nations
! of Europe, are very, very similar
i indeed. We want freedom, inde
pendence, prosperity, security,;
freedom of communication, free
dom of trade.
Now Mr. Khrushchev comes to
see this, he understands that the
i U.N. and its great majority of
new nations has become a very
important force in blocking his
own efforts to dominate Africa,
to secure his foothold in the Con
go, to move into Latin America,
through Cuba or wiiatever access
he may attempt. And therefore
he would like to destroy the U.N. !
as an operating agency and keep
it purely as a debating society,
where, of course, he can show off
his very extraordinary talents
with the odd specialized agencies
small enough to have no really
important role to play.
When we propose to him to lot i
us turn over the problems of I
Africa to the U.N. let us say to I
! the people of the Soviet Union j
; we will put all of our economic |
I assistance through the U.N.; we
j will agree that there will be no |
I arms race in Africa with you
j feeding one country and we an
, other; that we will agree with
you on a great U.N. civil service
i so that the peoples of these new
j nations can hire whoever they I
I need, whether it be a mathematics j
i teacher or an agricultural special-,
i ist, through the U.N., paying them i
their regular local salaries with I
I an additional salary increment i
paid by the U.N. to bring it up I
i to an international level. That we;
will let the whole operation of
the technical assistance of the
j U.N. in the world go through U.N.
rather than through cold war
j channels. We will propose an
i African adjunct to the world
court to help settle the disputes'
of Africa.
If we propose these things, the 1
Soviet Union takes fright. It takes
fright because they know they'll
not be bucking the United States,
but the United Nations, and this
lies of course behind Mr. Khrush

chev's discovery that the U.N. as |
an operating and administrative
body does not inn in line with j
his interests.
1 believe that when he left the
Soviet Union he did not intend
to make the speech that he made
at the U.N. I believe this all de
veloped during the trip abroad,
as he saw his whole effort in the
Congo come to a grinding stop.
In ihe 36 pages of Mr. Khrush
chev's speech, the first 30 pages
are relatively innocuous. The last
six pages are violent and vigor
ous and obviously were added
later.
So we have this chance, we
have this community of interests

with the world, if only we'll help
it to develop and grow.
Approximately one-half of Representative Chester Bowles"
Wednesday speech appears on today's editorial page. The other
half will appear tomorrow.
We presume that the appearanee of this speech in full will
raise a cry of "more Daily partisanship." All we con say is that
this is not so. Bowies' speech was basically nonpartisan and bril
liantly analyzed what America's foreign policy should he, whether
there is a Republican or Democratic I'resident.

T've been doing a lot of cam
paigning in this part of the coun
try and also across the Middle
West and I'll be continuing to do
this for many weeks to come. But
I'm glad to come here because I
like very much to talk to people
your age, because I really feel
that you have a big, big task to
do here.
I have a feeling sometimes
that you understand it better than
my generation. That's because
perhaps I know a great many of
you of your age.
I think you're probably going
to do a lot better than we've done.
At the same time I ask you to
be very tolerant in your views
about us. After all, all the things
that have happened these last 30
years have been unexpected and
I can't remember a single course
or a single professor at Yale Uni
versity that prepared me in the
least way for the kind of world
in which we have to live.
This has really been a differ
ent world and, of course, in the
last 20 years the world has really
changed at a fantastic speed. The
First World War destroyed most
of the imperial development and
the patterns of Europe and the
Second World War destroyed even
more. If you think of the changes
that have taken place since 1945,
it really leaves you almost breath
less.
There were 50 nations in the
U.N. in 1945. There are now very
nearly 100 nations. Something
close to a billion people have won
their freedom from colonialism.
There has been a fantastic spread- j
ing all over the world of the |
knowledge of the new technology,
the new opportunities that await
people once this new technology
can be put to work in their coun
tries.
The whole world is waking up.
with an enormous impact on us
and other more settled parts of
the world. And the next admin
istration, be it headed by Mr.
Nixon or Mr. Kennedy, is going
to face an enormous challenge.

; be the last President who would
; really have the opportunity to
j find an American answer as far
I as how we could go in this ques
tion of arms control and disarm
ament.
In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out
(Hi us so fast that we at least
have to know where we stand,
what we are prepared to do, how
we can properly and safely nego
tiate with the (Soviet Union, what
we are prepared to compromise
on, what we can't compromise on.
This implies enormous research
programs, not yet even planned
! or even underway, in iho science
of detection and means the next
President must grind out a pro
gram and a policy, purely set our
objectives--and right now our
: objectives are a bit fuzzy and un
j certain.
It means that we really have
to grapple with this question, and
not hope that it will go away,
j under the bland assumption that
: whatever we propose the Soviets
! will turn it down, and therefore
i there's no real pressure on us to
think very hard about this essen
tial question.
i So first we must be sure we
can defend ourselves, but then
we must move on rapidly and
wholeheartedly and vigorously to
try to find our answer to the
1 nuclear dilemma in which the
world has drifted. Now, whether
the Soviet Union would accept a
| proper, rational program of pro
posals by us is an open question.
I did find encouraging that this
group of scientists said that they
had dealt with many Soviet sci
entists in the last few months und
felt that for the first time the
Soviet scientists were beginning
to realize the awful implications
of these scientific developments
in the field of armament. For the
first time they really felt that
they had been sobered by them
and realized that time was really
running out.
Now what is beyond all this?
i Beyond this is the need for the
; American people to secure a new
understanding as to the kind of
1 world in which we are living, to
' make our peace with that world
j • —the non-communist parts of it—

and learn how we can build a real
partnership with the people of
Africa, Asia, Latin America and
Europe; the kind of partnership
that will weld the non-communist
peoples together with a common
set of objectives and purposes and
common approaches to many of
these world problems.
Now to many people that will
sound impossible. It will sound
impossible because the outer
world sometimes looks so very
strange to us. But I would like
to suggest that this is nowhere
near as difficult as it sounds.
Last week, I spent a very inter
esting evening with an Indian
friend, and we talked about Indian
objectives and American objec
tives and I suggested that we
each write down on a piece of
paper what we would like to see
happen in India in the next 10
years. So on his list he wrote,
"I want to see India really inde
pendent, I want to see India se
cure access to capital so she can
build up her industries. I want
to see her spread her education
across the country, so her young
people can learn to read and write
with more doctors and opportuni
ties for all of her people. I'd like
to see her have technical assist
ance from people who could come
to help her w i th o u t political
strings, to see her get the capital
she needs—private and public—
to help her build her country,
again without political strings.
I'd like that she be a free nation,
able to trade with other people,
able to sell her raw materials and
products in a free market and
buying in other countries such as
the U.S.A."
He wrote out his list and I
wrote out mine. The lists were
identical; the lists were almost
precisely the same; the wording
was almost the same. Now you
can do this with a gentleman from
Tanganyika, Kenya or somebody
from Ghana or Nigeria, from Iraq
or Iran or Turkey.
You could do this with almost
any people on earth except those
behind the so-called Iron Curtain
and the communist nations. There
is only one way that you could
make these lists come apart. That
is if you say at the bottom: "You
must take our side in the Cold
War. You must be part of the
American bloc. You must be to
tally on our side, committed to
our efforts, in opposition to those
of the Soviet Union. If you add
that must, you'll destroy the asso
ciation. If you leave it off, you'll
find yourself with an extraordi
nary rate of agreement with the
people of the world who reject

I communism as vigorously as wen
i do. i
I The interesting and fascinating
, development of the last two weeks
is that Mr. Khrushchev has come
to understand us, and this, I be- ;
lieve, is why he is trying to blow
I the U.N. sky high as an operat
ing, administrative agency. Mr. j
I Khrushchev has come to see
'something which our State De
partment has belatedly come to
see, if it has seen it at all, and
that is our interest and those of
the new African nations, the new j
Latin American and Asian na-.
! tions, the non-communist nations
! of Europe, are very, very similar
i indeed. We want freedom, inde
pendence, prosperity, security,;
freedom of communication, free
dom of trade.
Now Mr. Khrushchev comes to
see this, he understands that the
i U.N. and its great majority of
new nations has become a very
important force in blocking his
own efforts to dominate Africa,
to secure his foothold in the Con
go, to move into Latin America,
through Cuba or wiiatever access
he may attempt. And therefore
he would like to destroy the U.N. !
as an operating agency and keep
it purely as a debating society,
where, of course, he can show off
his very extraordinary talents
with the odd specialized agencies
small enough to have no really
important role to play.
When we propose to him to lot i
us turn over the problems of I
Africa to the U.N. let us say to I
! the people of the Soviet Union j
; we will put all of our economic |
I assistance through the U.N.; we
j will agree that there will be no |
I arms race in Africa with you
j feeding one country and we an
, other; that we will agree with
you on a great U.N. civil service
i so that the peoples of these new
j nations can hire whoever they I
I need, whether it be a mathematics j
i teacher or an agricultural special-,
i ist, through the U.N., paying them i
their regular local salaries with I
I an additional salary increment i
paid by the U.N. to bring it up I
i to an international level. That we;
will let the whole operation of
the technical assistance of the
j U.N. in the world go through U.N.
rather than through cold war
j channels. We will propose an
i African adjunct to the world
court to help settle the disputes'
of Africa.
If we propose these things, the 1
Soviet Union takes fright. It takes
fright because they know they'll
not be bucking the United States,
but the United Nations, and this
lies of course behind Mr. Khrush

chev's discovery that the U.N. as |
an operating and administrative
body does not inn in line with j
his interests.
1 believe that when he left the
Soviet Union he did not intend
to make the speech that he made
at the U.N. I believe this all de
veloped during the trip abroad,
as he saw his whole effort in the
Congo come to a grinding stop.
In ihe 36 pages of Mr. Khrush
chev's speech, the first 30 pages
are relatively innocuous. The last
six pages are violent and vigor
ous and obviously were added
later.
So we have this chance, we
have this community of interests

with the world, if only we'll help
it to develop and grow.
Approximately one-half of Representative Chester Bowles"
Wednesday speech appears on today's editorial page. The other
half will appear tomorrow.
We presume that the appearanee of this speech in full will
raise a cry of "more Daily partisanship." All we con say is that
this is not so. Bowies' speech was basically nonpartisan and bril
liantly analyzed what America's foreign policy should he, whether
there is a Republican or Democratic I'resident.

T've been doing a lot of cam
paigning in this part of the coun
try and also across the Middle
West and I'll be continuing to do
this for many weeks to come. But
I'm glad to come here because I
like very much to talk to people
your age, because I really feel
that you have a big, big task to
do here.
I have a feeling sometimes
that you understand it better than
my generation. That's because
perhaps I know a great many of
you of your age.
I think you're probably going
to do a lot better than we've done.
At the same time I ask you to
be very tolerant in your views
about us. After all, all the things
that have happened these last 30
years have been unexpected and
I can't remember a single course
or a single professor at Yale Uni
versity that prepared me in the
least way for the kind of world
in which we have to live.
This has really been a differ
ent world and, of course, in the
last 20 years the world has really
changed at a fantastic speed. The
First World War destroyed most
of the imperial development and
the patterns of Europe and the
Second World War destroyed even
more. If you think of the changes
that have taken place since 1945,
it really leaves you almost breath
less.
There were 50 nations in the
U.N. in 1945. There are now very
nearly 100 nations. Something
close to a billion people have won
their freedom from colonialism.
There has been a fantastic spread- j
ing all over the world of the |
knowledge of the new technology,
the new opportunities that await
people once this new technology
can be put to work in their coun
tries.
The whole world is waking up.
with an enormous impact on us
and other more settled parts of
the world. And the next admin
istration, be it headed by Mr.
Nixon or Mr. Kennedy, is going
to face an enormous challenge.
,We have really arrived, I be
lieve, at a sort of decisive turn
ing point in history. It seems to
me to be something like 1860
where there's a sharp dividing
line in the whole historical proc-!
ess. I don't mean we're about to
have a civil war, although it some- j
times sounds that way when you
read some of those political
speeches.
What I simply mean is that
the forces that are alive today are |
going to press us to re-examine 1
ourselves as we never have be
fore; re-examine our relations;
with the world, and I'm sure we're |
going to have to come up with a
lot of fresh ideas and fresh think-'
ing, if we're going to deal at all
adequately with the world that!
lies ahead.
Now what are the forces with
which we have to contend? The
first force of all is the world
revolution to which I referred.!
"The revolution of rising expec
tations," as Adlai Stevenson and
others have called it, the revolu
tion of people all across this world
who have suddenly awakened to
the enormous possibility that sci
ence and technology have placed
within their grasp.
Everywhere in the most remote
village, people are suddenly com
ing to feel that almost anything
is possible. One hundred years j
ago or even 10 years ago most j
of them had never even dreamed
of having a doctor in their vil
lage, or a road that would allow j
them to get oui to market or j
any feeling that they could par-1
ticipate in the affairs of their
country.
They were tucked away in the
backway of the world and civili
zation with all the things mov
ing by, leaving their village pretty
much the same as it had been for
centuries. And suddenly now in
Latin America, Africa and in
Asia they're waking up and they j
are demanding not only freedom
—this is really almost the easiest
part—but they're demanding an
opportunity to share more justly
on a broader basis with the po
tential growth and development
of their country.
Now this is an enormous pow
erful force, and it's a force that
we do not thoroughly understand.
I think most of the troubles we
have gotten into these last years
have been our failure to under
stand these forces and understand
how deep it runs or also how
closely related it is in many ways
to our own concepts and ideas
and ideals and objectives, even
though the people who are active
in it often look so different and
appear to think so differently.
Actually if you start to explore
this revolution you find we have
a great deal in common with it.
And then as somewhat part of
this revolution, but having come
under totalitarian controls, is

China; f»50.000,000 people awak
| ing also to the future under a
totalitarian, communist dictator
ship, with enormous plans, enor
mous programs and with some
very great and fundamental dis
advantages as they move to carry
out their objectives.
These disadvantages, these
shortages that exist in China in
my mind, for the long haul, may
be much more important to us
i than the fact that China is com
munist, unpleasant though this
latter fact may be.
This time it is reinforced by
another factor which is not. very
well understood in America or,
indeed, even in Europe. That is
the fact that China is also a
have-not country in the modern
industrial sense of the word in
at least two or three very impor
tant categories.
First of all, she has only about
two acres of cultivated land for
every rural family. On that two
acres of cultivated land, the Chi
nese people have to raise the
food for their families, raise the
j food for the city people, and some
food for export. China is also
short of oil. Her reserves of oil
are very limited and she is now
! thought to import 75 per cent of
jail her oil from the Soviet Union.
She has manganese and she has
tin and she has coal, iron and
I other resources, but she lacks par
j ticularly these two basic needs:
land and oil. Just to the south
and southeast of her are areas
: which are not overly populated,
j I'm speaking particularly of Su
; matra, Malaya and Cambodia,
! Viet Nam, Thailand and Burma,
where there are great major re
sources, not fully used by any
means, a potential of oil develop
ment, much land, good sun, goo<l
soil, an opportunity for two or
three crops per year.
And the pressure which may
grow on this Peking government
to expand in this direction is very
great. It's one of the basic facts
of life as we look at Asia. And
then there is also another chal
lenge: the challenge of the Soviet
Union, becoming in two short gen
erations the second industrial
power in the world. Enormously
powerful and growing at the rate
! of something like eight per cent
j a year, graduating perhaps as
| many as twice as many engineers
and scientists as we do a year,
and we all know them to be very
able individuals indeed.
And behind all this there's a
| fourth force, and this is the force
'of the new weapons, this hideous
; new capacity that we've developed
to slough off a huge segment of
' mankind with nuclear bombs and
i missiles and other contraptions.
! Mankind has always had rather
! a weakness for war, but fortu
! nately in the past we weren't able
; to hurt each other to any great
j degree until this century.
And then we perfected the art
1 of killing to a very fine point.
I Unhappily these new nuclear
j weapons are making the prospect
l of war even more impressive, and
i I think most of us will agree that
somehow, someway, this must be
j prevented.
Yet we're no brighter as indi
viduals than our parents. We
i probably have no more concept
I of living together—or not much
more concept—and this threat is
very great, because while no one
might want to start a nuclear
war, the chance of a failure of
communication, miscalculation;
the chance of somebody in panic
;or fear may pull that hideous
trigger is very much there and
very much present.
Now this is the world that we
face in the beginning of the 1960'5.
It's a very, very difficult, com
plex, dangerous, but in many
ways a very promising world in
which almost anything is possible,
either good or bad. Now what do
we want from this world? What
do we want as our part of it?
! What role would we like to play?
Well, I think most Americans—
!or at least many of us—would
say, "Well, we'd just be delighted
to play an isolationist role and
try to pull away from this and
let the world go by and enjoy our
high standard of living and hope
we can make a better society here
and let the world go its own way."
I think we also know that this
is impossible. This Is simply not
going to be. We're either going
to make our place in this world,
we're going to become a construc
tive part of it, or the world in
the future will pass us by with
all kinds of consequences that are
very difficult to foresee. Well, all
right, we have to deal with the
world; how do we do it and what
do we want?
Well, the first thing we'd like
to have happen is we'd like the
: right to survive. We just don't
| want to get blown lip. Rut I also
| think it's clear to us as we start
to analyze the problems about

| being' blown up, that this is not
a simple question.
Again you can't just make it go
away. You certainly can't avoir!
destruction by simply not build
ing an adequate air force, army,
navy and defense. You have to
be able to defend yourself to gain
the kind of time with which to
deal with all these forces.
Human beings being what they
are, would certainly rush across
any line in the world if it was
not adequately and vigorously de
fended. So we have to have weap
ons and a military system with
which to defend ourselves. It's
an open question as to what state
our affairs are in today.
China is also basically imperi
| alistic in terms of growth of any
single dynasty. When the Mings
rose to power and attempted to
spread into southeast Asia, they
(settled cities and developed cities
(•lose to Africa. When the Man
i chus rose to their height of power
| they rode west to south central
Asia. Now you have a new dyna
| sty under Mao Tsu Tung, this
; time a communist dynasty which
advances this proud expansionist
i view.
Out right on the heels of this,
and I believe that this is a point
tlicit not enough of us are fully
aware of, is the need for a wholly
i and totally now approach to the
question of disarmament and
! arms control.
I met just a week or 10 days
ago some of the really top mili
; tary scientists in America and
spent the better part of a day
with Ihein. These men had not
j been together as a group for
; almost a year. The reason why
i they had not come together was
j they all said they argued too
j much. They all had such violently
; different viewpoints as to how we
; could best defend ourselves, what
■ kind of weapons system should
| be favored in a new budget, and
j so on.
But they said it was easy for
J them to come together now be-
Icause they're all beginning to

! the United States would probably
; be the last President who would
; really have the opportunity to
j find an American answer as far
I as how we could go in this ques
tion of arms control and disarm

In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out

have to know where we stand,
what we are prepared to do, how
we can properly and safely nego

where there's a sharp dividing
line in the whole historical proc-!
ess. I don't mean we're about to
have a civil war, although it some- j
times sounds that way when you
read some of those political
speeches.
What I simply mean is that
the forces that are alive today are |
going to press us to re-examine 1
ourselves as we never have be
fore; re-examine our relations;
with the world, and I'm sure we're |
going to have to come up with a
lot of fresh ideas and fresh think-'
ing, if we're going to deal at all
adequately with the world that!
lies ahead.
Now what are the forces with
which we have to contend? The
first force of all is the world
revolution to which I referred.!
"The revolution of rising expec
tations," as Adlai Stevenson and
others have called it, the revolu
tion of people all across this world
who have suddenly awakened to
the enormous possibility that sci
ence and technology have placed
within their grasp.
Everywhere in the most remote
village, people are suddenly com
ing to feel that almost anything
is possible. One hundred years j
ago or even 10 years ago most j
of them had never even dreamed
of having a doctor in their vil
lage, or a road that would allow j
them to get oui to market or j
any feeling that they could par-1
ticipate in the affairs of their
country.
They were tucked away in the
backway of the world and civili
zation with all the things mov
ing by, leaving their village pretty
much the same as it had been for
centuries. And suddenly now in
Latin America, Africa and in
Asia they're waking up and they j
are demanding not only freedom
—this is really almost the easiest
part—but they're demanding an
opportunity to share more justly
on a broader basis with the po
tential growth and development
of their country.
Now this is an enormous pow
erful force, and it's a force that
we do not thoroughly understand.
I think most of the troubles we
have gotten into these last years
have been our failure to under
stand these forces and understand
how deep it runs or also how
closely related it is in many ways
to our own concepts and ideas
and ideals and objectives, even
though the people who are active
in it often look so different and
appear to think so differently.
Actually if you start to explore
this revolution you find we have
a great deal in common with it.
And then as somewhat part of
this revolution, but having come
under totalitarian controls, is

China; f»50.000,000 people awak
| ing also to the future under a
totalitarian, communist dictator
ship, with enormous plans, enor
mous programs and with some
very great and fundamental dis
advantages as they move to carry
out their objectives.
These disadvantages, these
shortages that exist in China in
my mind, for the long haul, may
be much more important to us
i than the fact that China is com
munist, unpleasant though this
latter fact may be.
This time it is reinforced by
another factor which is not. very
well understood in America or,
indeed, even in Europe. That is
the fact that China is also a
have-not country in the modern
industrial sense of the word in
at least two or three very impor
tant categories.
First of all, she has only about
two acres of cultivated land for
every rural family. On that two
acres of cultivated land, the Chi
nese people have to raise the
food for their families, raise the
j food for the city people, and some
food for export. China is also
short of oil. Her reserves of oil
are very limited and she is now
! thought to import 75 per cent of
jail her oil from the Soviet Union.
She has manganese and she has
tin and she has coal, iron and
I other resources, but she lacks par
j ticularly these two basic needs:
land and oil. Just to the south
and southeast of her are areas
: which are not overly populated,
j I'm speaking particularly of Su
; matra, Malaya and Cambodia,
! Viet Nam, Thailand and Burma,
where there are great major re
sources, not fully used by any
means, a potential of oil develop
ment, much land, good sun, goo<l
soil, an opportunity for two or
three crops per year.
And the pressure which may
grow on this Peking government
to expand in this direction is very
great. It's one of the basic facts
of life as we look at Asia. And
then there is also another chal
lenge: the challenge of the Soviet
Union, becoming in two short gen
erations the second industrial
power in the world. Enormously
powerful and growing at the rate
! of something like eight per cent
j a year, graduating perhaps as
| many as twice as many engineers
and scientists as we do a year,
and we all know them to be very
able individuals indeed.
And behind all this there's a
| fourth force, and this is the force
'of the new weapons, this hideous
; new capacity that we've developed
to slough off a huge segment of
' mankind with nuclear bombs and
i missiles and other contraptions.
! Mankind has always had rather
! a weakness for war, but fortu
! nately in the past we weren't able
; to hurt each other to any great
j degree until this century.
And then we perfected the art
1 of killing to a very fine point.
I Unhappily these new nuclear
j weapons are making the prospect
l of war even more impressive, and
i I think most of us will agree that
somehow, someway, this must be
j prevented.
Yet we're no brighter as indi
viduals than our parents. We
i probably have no more concept
I of living together—or not much
more concept—and this threat is
very great, because while no one
might want to start a nuclear
war, the chance of a failure of
communication, miscalculation;
the chance of somebody in panic
;or fear may pull that hideous
trigger is very much there and
very much present.
Now this is the world that we
face in the beginning of the 1960'5.
It's a very, very difficult, com
plex, dangerous, but in many
ways a very promising world in
which almost anything is possible,
either good or bad. Now what do
we want from this world? What
do we want as our part of it?
! What role would we like to play?
Well, I think most Americans—
!or at least many of us—would
say, "Well, we'd just be delighted
to play an isolationist role and
try to pull away from this and
let the world go by and enjoy our
high standard of living and hope
we can make a better society here
and let the world go its own way."
I think we also know that this
is impossible. This Is simply not
going to be. We're either going
to make our place in this world,
we're going to become a construc
tive part of it, or the world in
the future will pass us by with
all kinds of consequences that are
very difficult to foresee. Well, all
right, we have to deal with the
world; how do we do it and what
do we want?
Well, the first thing we'd like
to have happen is we'd like the
: right to survive. We just don't
| want to get blown lip. Rut I also
| think it's clear to us as we start
to analyze the problems about

| being' blown up, that this is not
a simple question.
Again you can't just make it go
away. You certainly can't avoir!
destruction by simply not build
ing an adequate air force, army,
navy and defense. You have to
be able to defend yourself to gain
the kind of time with which to
deal with all these forces.
Human beings being what they
are, would certainly rush across
any line in the world if it was
not adequately and vigorously de
fended. So we have to have weap
ons and a military system with
which to defend ourselves. It's
an open question as to what state
our affairs are in today.
China is also basically imperi
| alistic in terms of growth of any
single dynasty. When the Mings
rose to power and attempted to
spread into southeast Asia, they
(settled cities and developed cities
(•lose to Africa. When the Man
i chus rose to their height of power
| they rode west to south central
Asia. Now you have a new dyna
| sty under Mao Tsu Tung, this
; time a communist dynasty which
advances this proud expansionist
i view.
Out right on the heels of this,
and I believe that this is a point
tlicit not enough of us are fully
aware of, is the need for a wholly
i and totally now approach to the
question of disarmament and
! arms control.
I met just a week or 10 days
ago some of the really top mili
; tary scientists in America and
spent the better part of a day
with Ihein. These men had not
j been together as a group for
; almost a year. The reason why
i they had not come together was
j they all said they argued too
j much. They all had such violently
; different viewpoints as to how we
; could best defend ourselves, what
■ kind of weapons system should
| be favored in a new budget, and
j so on.
But they said it was easy for
J them to come together now be-
Icause they're all beginning to
I realize that the next President of
! the United States would probably
; be the last President who would
; really have the opportunity to
j find an American answer as far
I as how we could go in this ques
tion of arms control and disarm
ament.
In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out
(Hi us so fast that we at least
have to know where we stand,
what we are prepared to do, how
we can properly and safely nego
tiate with the (Soviet Union, what
we are prepared to compromise
on, what we can't compromise on.
This implies enormous research
programs, not yet even planned
! or even underway, in iho science
of detection and means the next
President must grind out a pro
gram and a policy, purely set our
objectives--and right now our
: objectives are a bit fuzzy and un
j certain.
It means that we really have
to grapple with this question, and
not hope that it will go away,
j under the bland assumption that
: whatever we propose the Soviets
! will turn it down, and therefore
i there's no real pressure on us to
think very hard about this essen
tial question.
i So first we must be sure we
can defend ourselves, but then
we must move on rapidly and
wholeheartedly and vigorously to
try to find our answer to the
1 nuclear dilemma in which the
world has drifted. Now, whether
the Soviet Union would accept a
| proper, rational program of pro
posals by us is an open question.
I did find encouraging that this
group of scientists said that they
had dealt with many Soviet sci
entists in the last few months und
felt that for the first time the
Soviet scientists were beginning
to realize the awful implications
of these scientific developments
in the field of armament. For the
first time they really felt that
they had been sobered by them
and realized that time was really
running out.
Now what is beyond all this?
i Beyond this is the need for the
; American people to secure a new
understanding as to the kind of
1 world in which we are living, to
' make our peace with that world
j • —the non-communist parts of it—

and learn how we can build a real
partnership with the people of
Africa, Asia, Latin America and
Europe; the kind of partnership
that will weld the non-communist
peoples together with a common
set of objectives and purposes and
common approaches to many of
these world problems.
Now to many people that will
sound impossible. It will sound
impossible because the outer
world sometimes looks so very
strange to us. But I would like
to suggest that this is nowhere
near as difficult as it sounds.
Last week, I spent a very inter
esting evening with an Indian
friend, and we talked about Indian
objectives and American objec
tives and I suggested that we
each write down on a piece of
paper what we would like to see
happen in India in the next 10
years. So on his list he wrote,
"I want to see India really inde
pendent, I want to see India se
cure access to capital so she can
build up her industries. I want
to see her spread her education
across the country, so her young
people can learn to read and write
with more doctors and opportuni
ties for all of her people. I'd like
to see her have technical assist
ance from people who could come
to help her w i th o u t political
strings, to see her get the capital
she needs—private and public—
to help her build her country,
again without political strings.
I'd like that she be a free nation,
able to trade with other people,
able to sell her raw materials and
products in a free market and
buying in other countries such as
the U.S.A."
He wrote out his list and I
wrote out mine. The lists were
identical; the lists were almost
precisely the same; the wording
was almost the same. Now you
can do this with a gentleman from
Tanganyika, Kenya or somebody
from Ghana or Nigeria, from Iraq
or Iran or Turkey.
You could do this with almost
any people on earth except those
behind the so-called Iron Curtain
and the communist nations. There
is only one way that you could
make these lists come apart. That
is if you say at the bottom: "You
must take our side in the Cold
War. You must be part of the
American bloc. You must be to
tally on our side, committed to
our efforts, in opposition to those
of the Soviet Union. If you add
that must, you'll destroy the asso
ciation. If you leave it off, you'll
find yourself with an extraordi
nary rate of agreement with the
people of the world who reject

I communism as vigorously as wen
i do. i
I The interesting and fascinating
, development of the last two weeks
is that Mr. Khrushchev has come
to understand us, and this, I be- ;
lieve, is why he is trying to blow
I the U.N. sky high as an operat
ing, administrative agency. Mr. j
I Khrushchev has come to see
'something which our State De
partment has belatedly come to
see, if it has seen it at all, and
that is our interest and those of
the new African nations, the new j
Latin American and Asian na-.
! tions, the non-communist nations
! of Europe, are very, very similar
i indeed. We want freedom, inde
pendence, prosperity, security,;
freedom of communication, free
dom of trade.
Now Mr. Khrushchev comes to
see this, he understands that the
i U.N. and its great majority of
new nations has become a very
important force in blocking his
own efforts to dominate Africa,
to secure his foothold in the Con
go, to move into Latin America,
through Cuba or wiiatever access
he may attempt. And therefore
he would like to destroy the U.N. !
as an operating agency and keep
it purely as a debating society,
where, of course, he can show off
his very extraordinary talents
with the odd specialized agencies
small enough to have no really
important role to play.
When we propose to him to lot i
us turn over the problems of I
Africa to the U.N. let us say to I
! the people of the Soviet Union j
; we will put all of our economic |
I assistance through the U.N.; we
j will agree that there will be no |
I arms race in Africa with you
j feeding one country and we an
, other; that we will agree with
you on a great U.N. civil service
i so that the peoples of these new
j nations can hire whoever they I
I need, whether it be a mathematics j
i teacher or an agricultural special-,
i ist, through the U.N., paying them i
their regular local salaries with I
I an additional salary increment i
paid by the U.N. to bring it up I
i to an international level. That we;
will let the whole operation of
the technical assistance of the
j U.N. in the world go through U.N.
rather than through cold war
j channels. We will propose an
i African adjunct to the world
court to help settle the disputes'
of Africa.
If we propose these things, the 1
Soviet Union takes fright. It takes
fright because they know they'll
not be bucking the United States,
but the United Nations, and this
lies of course behind Mr. Khrush

chev's discovery that the U.N. as |
an operating and administrative
body does not inn in line with j
his interests.
1 believe that when he left the
Soviet Union he did not intend
to make the speech that he made
at the U.N. I believe this all de
veloped during the trip abroad,
as he saw his whole effort in the
Congo come to a grinding stop.
In ihe 36 pages of Mr. Khrush
chev's speech, the first 30 pages
are relatively innocuous. The last
six pages are violent and vigor
ous and obviously were added
later.
So we have this chance, we
have this community of interests

with the world, if only we'll help
it to develop and grow.
Approximately one-half of Representative Chester Bowles"
Wednesday speech appears on today's editorial page. The other
half will appear tomorrow.
We presume that the appearanee of this speech in full will
raise a cry of "more Daily partisanship." All we con say is that
this is not so. Bowies' speech was basically nonpartisan and bril
liantly analyzed what America's foreign policy should he, whether
there is a Republican or Democratic I'resident.

T've been doing a lot of cam
paigning in this part of the coun
try and also across the Middle
West and I'll be continuing to do
this for many weeks to come. But
I'm glad to come here because I
like very much to talk to people
your age, because I really feel
that you have a big, big task to
do here.
I have a feeling sometimes
that you understand it better than
my generation. That's because
perhaps I know a great many of
you of your age.
I think you're probably going
to do a lot better than we've done.
At the same time I ask you to
be very tolerant in your views
about us. After all, all the things
that have happened these last 30
years have been unexpected and
I can't remember a single course
or a single professor at Yale Uni
versity that prepared me in the
least way for the kind of world
in which we have to live.
This has really been a differ
ent world and, of course, in the
last 20 years the world has really
changed at a fantastic speed. The
First World War destroyed most
of the imperial development and
the patterns of Europe and the
Second World War destroyed even
more. If you think of the changes
that have taken place since 1945,
it really leaves you almost breath
less.
There were 50 nations in the
U.N. in 1945. There are now very
nearly 100 nations. Something
close to a billion people have won
their freedom from colonialism.
There has been a fantastic spread- j
ing all over the world of the |
knowledge of the new technology,
the new opportunities that await
people once this new technology
can be put to work in their coun
tries.
The whole world is waking up.
with an enormous impact on us
and other more settled parts of
the world. And the next admin
istration, be it headed by Mr.
Nixon or Mr. Kennedy, is going
to face an enormous challenge.
,We have really arrived, I be
lieve, at a sort of decisive turn
ing point in history. It seems to
me to be something like 1860
where there's a sharp dividing
line in the whole historical proc-!
ess. I don't mean we're about to
have a civil war, although it some- j
times sounds that way when you

programs, not yet even planned
! or even underway, in iho science
of detection and means the next
President must grind out a pro
gram and a policy, purely set our
objectives--and right now our
: objectives are a bit fuzzy and un
j certain.
It means that we really have
to grapple with this question, and
not hope that it will go away,
j under the bland assumption that
: whatever we propose the Soviets
! will turn it down, and therefore
i there's no real pressure on us to
think very hard about this essen
tial question.
i So first we must be sure we
can defend ourselves, but then
we must move on rapidly and
wholeheartedly and vigorously to
try to find our answer to the
1 nuclear dilemma in which the
world has drifted. Now, whether
the Soviet Union would accept a
| proper, rational program of pro
posals by us is an open question.
I did find encouraging that this
group of scientists said that they
had dealt with many Soviet sci
entists in the last few months und
felt that for the first time the
Soviet scientists were beginning
to realize the awful implications
of these scientific developments
in the field of armament. For the
first time they really felt that
they had been sobered by them
and realized that time was really
running out.
Now what is beyond all this?
i Beyond this is the need for the
; American people to secure a new
understanding as to the kind of
1 world in which we are living, to
' make our peace with that world
j • —the non-communist parts of it—

and learn how we can build a real
partnership with the people of
Africa, Asia, Latin America and
Europe; the kind of partnership
that will weld the non-communist
peoples together with a common
set of objectives and purposes and
common approaches to many of
these world problems.
Now to many people that will
sound impossible. It will sound
impossible because the outer
world sometimes looks so very
strange to us. But I would like
to suggest that this is nowhere
near as difficult as it sounds.
Last week, I spent a very inter
esting evening with an Indian
friend, and we talked about Indian
objectives and American objec
tives and I suggested that we
each write down on a piece of
paper what we would like to see
happen in India in the next 10
years. So on his list he wrote,
"I want to see India really inde
pendent, I want to see India se
cure access to capital so she can
build up her industries. I want
to see her spread her education
across the country, so her young
people can learn to read and write
with more doctors and opportuni
ties for all of her people. I'd like
to see her have technical assist
ance from people who could come
to help her w i th o u t political
strings, to see her get the capital
she needs—private and public—
to help her build her country,
again without political strings.
I'd like that she be a free nation,
able to trade with other people,
able to sell her raw materials and
products in a free market and
buying in other countries such as
the U.S.A."
He wrote out his list and I
wrote out mine. The lists were
identical; the lists were almost
precisely the same; the wording
was almost the same. Now you
can do this with a gentleman from
Tanganyika, Kenya or somebody
from Ghana or Nigeria, from Iraq
or Iran or Turkey.
You could do this with almost
any people on earth except those
behind the so-called Iron Curtain
and the communist nations. There
is only one way that you could
make these lists come apart. That
is if you say at the bottom: "You
must take our side in the Cold
War. You must be part of the
American bloc. You must be to
tally on our side, committed to
our efforts, in opposition to those
of the Soviet Union. If you add
that must, you'll destroy the asso
ciation. If you leave it off, you'll
find yourself with an extraordi
nary rate of agreement with the
people of the world who reject

I communism as vigorously as wen
i do. i
I The interesting and fascinating
, development of the last two weeks
is that Mr. Khrushchev has come
to understand us, and this, I be- ;
lieve, is why he is trying to blow
I the U.N. sky high as an operat
ing, administrative agency. Mr. j
I Khrushchev has come to see
'something which our State De
partment has belatedly come to
see, if it has seen it at all, and
that is our interest and those of
the new African nations, the new j
Latin American and Asian na-.
! tions, the non-communist nations
! of Europe, are very, very similar
i indeed. We want freedom, inde
pendence, prosperity, security,;
freedom of communication, free
dom of trade.
Now Mr. Khrushchev comes to
see this, he understands that the
i U.N. and its great majority of
new nations has become a very
important force in blocking his
own efforts to dominate Africa,
to secure his foothold in the Con
go, to move into Latin America,
through Cuba or wiiatever access
he may attempt. And therefore
he would like to destroy the U.N. !
as an operating agency and keep
it purely as a debating society,
where, of course, he can show off
his very extraordinary talents
with the odd specialized agencies
small enough to have no really
important role to play.
When we propose to him to lot i
us turn over the problems of I
Africa to the U.N. let us say to I
! the people of the Soviet Union j
; we will put all of our economic |
I assistance through the U.N.; we
j will agree that there will be no |
I arms race in Africa with you
j feeding one country and we an
, other; that we will agree with
you on a great U.N. civil service
i so that the peoples of these new
j nations can hire whoever they I
I need, whether it be a mathematics j
i teacher or an agricultural special-,
i ist, through the U.N., paying them i
their regular local salaries with I
I an additional salary increment i
paid by the U.N. to bring it up I
i to an international level. That we;
will let the whole operation of
the technical assistance of the
j U.N. in the world go through U.N.
rather than through cold war
j channels. We will propose an
i African adjunct to the world
court to help settle the disputes'
of Africa.
If we propose these things, the 1
Soviet Union takes fright. It takes
fright because they know they'll
not be bucking the United States,
but the United Nations, and this
lies of course behind Mr. Khrush

chev's discovery that the U.N. as |
an operating and administrative
body does not inn in line with j
his interests.
1 believe that when he left the
Soviet Union he did not intend
to make the speech that he made
at the U.N. I believe this all de
veloped during the trip abroad,
as he saw his whole effort in the
Congo come to a grinding stop.
In ihe 36 pages of Mr. Khrush
chev's speech, the first 30 pages
are relatively innocuous. The last
six pages are violent and vigor
ous and obviously were added
later.
So we have this chance, we
have this community of interests

with the world, if only we'll help
it to develop and grow.
Approximately one-half of Representative Chester Bowles"
Wednesday speech appears on today's editorial page. The other
half will appear tomorrow.
We presume that the appearanee of this speech in full will
raise a cry of "more Daily partisanship." All we con say is that
this is not so. Bowies' speech was basically nonpartisan and bril
liantly analyzed what America's foreign policy should he, whether
there is a Republican or Democratic I'resident.

T've been doing a lot of cam
paigning in this part of the coun
try and also across the Middle
West and I'll be continuing to do
this for many weeks to come. But
I'm glad to come here because I
like very much to talk to people
your age, because I really feel
that you have a big, big task to
do here.
I have a feeling sometimes
that you understand it better than
my generation. That's because
perhaps I know a great many of
you of your age.
I think you're probably going
to do a lot better than we've done.
At the same time I ask you to
be very tolerant in your views
about us. After all, all the things
that have happened these last 30
years have been unexpected and
I can't remember a single course
or a single professor at Yale Uni
versity that prepared me in the
least way for the kind of world
in which we have to live.
This has really been a differ
ent world and, of course, in the
last 20 years the world has really
changed at a fantastic speed. The
First World War destroyed most
of the imperial development and
the patterns of Europe and the
Second World War destroyed even
more. If you think of the changes
that have taken place since 1945,
it really leaves you almost breath
less.
There were 50 nations in the
U.N. in 1945. There are now very
nearly 100 nations. Something
close to a billion people have won
their freedom from colonialism.
There has been a fantastic spread- j
ing all over the world of the |
knowledge of the new technology,
the new opportunities that await
people once this new technology
can be put to work in their coun
tries.
The whole world is waking up.
with an enormous impact on us
and other more settled parts of
the world. And the next admin
istration, be it headed by Mr.
Nixon or Mr. Kennedy, is going
to face an enormous challenge.
,We have really arrived, I be
lieve, at a sort of decisive turn
ing point in history. It seems to
me to be something like 1860
where there's a sharp dividing
line in the whole historical proc-!
ess. I don't mean we're about to
have a civil war, although it some- j
times sounds that way when you
read some of those political
speeches.
What I simply mean is that
the forces that are alive today are |
going to press us to re-examine 1
ourselves as we never have be
fore; re-examine our relations;
with the world, and I'm sure we're |
going to have to come up with a
lot of fresh ideas and fresh think-'
ing, if we're going to deal at all
adequately with the world that!
lies ahead.
Now what are the forces with
which we have to contend? The
first force of all is the world
revolution to which I referred.!
"The revolution of rising expec
tations," as Adlai Stevenson and
others have called it, the revolu
tion of people all across this world
who have suddenly awakened to
the enormous possibility that sci
ence and technology have placed
within their grasp.
Everywhere in the most remote
village, people are suddenly com
ing to feel that almost anything
is possible. One hundred years j
ago or even 10 years ago most j
of them had never even dreamed
of having a doctor in their vil
lage, or a road that would allow j
them to get oui to market or j
any feeling that they could par-1
ticipate in the affairs of their
country.
They were tucked away in the
backway of the world and civili
zation with all the things mov
ing by, leaving their village pretty
much the same as it had been for
centuries. And suddenly now in
Latin America, Africa and in
Asia they're waking up and they j
are demanding not only freedom
—this is really almost the easiest
part—but they're demanding an
opportunity to share more justly
on a broader basis with the po
tential growth and development
of their country.
Now this is an enormous pow
erful force, and it's a force that
we do not thoroughly understand.
I think most of the troubles we
have gotten into these last years
have been our failure to under
stand these forces and understand
how deep it runs or also how
closely related it is in many ways
to our own concepts and ideas
and ideals and objectives, even
though the people who are active
in it often look so different and
appear to think so differently.
Actually if you start to explore
this revolution you find we have
a great deal in common with it.
And then as somewhat part of
this revolution, but having come
under totalitarian controls, is

China; f»50.000,000 people awak
| ing also to the future under a
totalitarian, communist dictator
ship, with enormous plans, enor
mous programs and with some
very great and fundamental dis
advantages as they move to carry
out their objectives.
These disadvantages, these
shortages that exist in China in
my mind, for the long haul, may
be much more important to us
i than the fact that China is com
munist, unpleasant though this
latter fact may be.
This time it is reinforced by
another factor which is not. very
well understood in America or,
indeed, even in Europe. That is
the fact that China is also a
have-not country in the modern
industrial sense of the word in
at least two or three very impor
tant categories.
First of all, she has only about
two acres of cultivated land for
every rural family. On that two
acres of cultivated land, the Chi
nese people have to raise the
food for their families, raise the
j food for the city people, and some
food for export. China is also
short of oil. Her reserves of oil
are very limited and she is now
! thought to import 75 per cent of
jail her oil from the Soviet Union.
She has manganese and she has
tin and she has coal, iron and
I other resources, but she lacks par
j ticularly these two basic needs:
land and oil. Just to the south
and southeast of her are areas
: which are not overly populated,
j I'm speaking particularly of Su
; matra, Malaya and Cambodia,
! Viet Nam, Thailand and Burma,
where there are great major re
sources, not fully used by any
means, a potential of oil develop
ment, much land, good sun, goo<l
soil, an opportunity for two or
three crops per year.
And the pressure which may
grow on this Peking government
to expand in this direction is very
great. It's one of the basic facts
of life as we look at Asia. And
then there is also another chal
lenge: the challenge of the Soviet
Union, becoming in two short gen
erations the second industrial
power in the world. Enormously
powerful and growing at the rate
! of something like eight per cent
j a year, graduating perhaps as
| many as twice as many engineers
and scientists as we do a year,
and we all know them to be very
able individuals indeed.
And behind all this there's a
| fourth force, and this is the force
'of the new weapons, this hideous
; new capacity that we've developed
to slough off a huge segment of
' mankind with nuclear bombs and
i missiles and other contraptions.
! Mankind has always had rather
! a weakness for war, but fortu
! nately in the past we weren't able
; to hurt each other to any great
j degree until this century.
And then we perfected the art
1 of killing to a very fine point.
I Unhappily these new nuclear
j weapons are making the prospect
l of war even more impressive, and
i I think most of us will agree that
somehow, someway, this must be
j prevented.
Yet we're no brighter as indi
viduals than our parents. We
i probably have no more concept
I of living together—or not much
more concept—and this threat is
very great, because while no one
might want to start a nuclear
war, the chance of a failure of
communication, miscalculation;
the chance of somebody in panic
;or fear may pull that hideous
trigger is very much there and
very much present.
Now this is the world that we
face in the beginning of the 1960'5.
It's a very, very difficult, com
plex, dangerous, but in many
ways a very promising world in
which almost anything is possible,
either good or bad. Now what do
we want from this world? What
do we want as our part of it?
! What role would we like to play?
Well, I think most Americans—
!or at least many of us—would
say, "Well, we'd just be delighted
to play an isolationist role and
try to pull away from this and
let the world go by and enjoy our
high standard of living and hope
we can make a better society here
and let the world go its own way."
I think we also know that this
is impossible. This Is simply not
going to be. We're either going
to make our place in this world,
we're going to become a construc
tive part of it, or the world in
the future will pass us by with
all kinds of consequences that are
very difficult to foresee. Well, all
right, we have to deal with the
world; how do we do it and what
do we want?
Well, the first thing we'd like
to have happen is we'd like the
: right to survive. We just don't
| want to get blown lip. Rut I also
| think it's clear to us as we start
to analyze the problems about

| being' blown up, that this is not
a simple question.
Again you can't just make it go
away. You certainly can't avoir!
destruction by simply not build
ing an adequate air force, army,
navy and defense. You have to
be able to defend yourself to gain
the kind of time with which to
deal with all these forces.
Human beings being what they
are, would certainly rush across
any line in the world if it was
not adequately and vigorously de
fended. So we have to have weap
ons and a military system with
which to defend ourselves. It's
an open question as to what state
our affairs are in today.
China is also basically imperi
| alistic in terms of growth of any
single dynasty. When the Mings
rose to power and attempted to
spread into southeast Asia, they
(settled cities and developed cities
(•lose to Africa. When the Man
i chus rose to their height of power
| they rode west to south central
Asia. Now you have a new dyna
| sty under Mao Tsu Tung, this
; time a communist dynasty which
advances this proud expansionist
i view.
Out right on the heels of this,
and I believe that this is a point
tlicit not enough of us are fully
aware of, is the need for a wholly
i and totally now approach to the
question of disarmament and
! arms control.
I met just a week or 10 days
ago some of the really top mili
; tary scientists in America and
spent the better part of a day
with Ihein. These men had not
j been together as a group for
; almost a year. The reason why
i they had not come together was
j they all said they argued too
j much. They all had such violently
; different viewpoints as to how we
; could best defend ourselves, what
■ kind of weapons system should
| be favored in a new budget, and
j so on.
But they said it was easy for
J them to come together now be-
Icause they're all beginning to
I realize that the next President of
! the United States would probably
; be the last President who would
; really have the opportunity to
j find an American answer as far
I as how we could go in this ques
tion of arms control and disarm
ament.
In other words, in these next
few years, time ifc running out
(Hi us so fast that we at least
have to know where we stand,
what we are prepared to do, how
we can properly and safely nego
tiate with the (Soviet Union, what
we are prepared to compromise
on, what we can't compromise on.
This implies enormous research
programs, not yet even planned
! or even underway, in iho science
of detection and means the next
President must grind out a pro
gram and a policy, purely set our
objectives--and right now our
: objectives are a bit fuzzy and un
j certain.
It means that we really have
to grapple with this question, and
not hope that it will go away,
j under the bland assumption that
: whatever we propose the Soviets
! will turn it down, and therefore
i there's no real pressure on us to
think very hard about this essen
tial question.
i So first we must be sure we
can defend ourselves, but then
we must move on rapidly and
wholeheartedly and vigorously to
try to find our answer to the

world has drifted. Now, whether
