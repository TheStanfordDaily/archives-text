# Owens Not Pleased With Huskies Performance
## 
### RUSS ALLEN 
Although they won ihe game. Coach Jim Owens of Washington
wasn't very happy in the visitor's locker after the 2910 Husky victory
last Saturday.
"Stanford gave us a much better game than expected and of
course I'm happy we won," said the Husky mentor, "but we are

not playing consistently nor up
to our potential this season."
The coach will have quite a bit
on his mind this week as he hopes
to put his purple and gold—last
year's Rose Bowl conquerors of
Wisconsin—footballers in shape
for their big contest with UCLA
in Seattle.
The Husky coach praised Stan
ford lineplay this year • and
thought that they had improved
from last year's encounter. He
did comment on both team's rag
gedness in spots throughout the
game.
Owen's started his first team
on offense, then ran his second
unit in on defense in hopes to run
down the Stanford defenders.
However, with the loss of
George Fleming early in the half,
the Huskies fell apart offensively
in the second and third quarters,
and if it were not for the running
of Charlie Mitchell, key passing
by Husky quarterback Bob Schlo
redt and costly Stanford mistakes,
the Indians might have pulled it
out for an upset.
Owens did mention that—be
sides Ihe loss of Fleming- inju
ries to first string linemen Barry
Bullard and Chuck Myers which
kept them in Seattle this weekend
did hurt the Husky timing.
WHEN ASKED whether Wash

ington would repeat in the Rose
Bowl this year, Owens smiled and
remarked, "the Rose Bowl is far
away, and I don't think it is in
the realm of possibility that We
will even make the New Year's
j classic."'
Owen's ceased his pessimism
then, and praised his veterans
I Schloredt and center Roy McKas
son for their good offensive lead
ership as well as savage tackling
ion defense. He also was happy
with sophomore back Mitchell's
running.
