# DROPPED PUNT IS TURNING POINT
## Huskies Win on Stanford Fumbles Daily Sports 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
"I'd sure like to have seen what
would have happened if we had
caught that punt when we were
only behind 17-10," sighed Coach
Jack Curtice wishfully after the
game. "That and the fumble on
their first kickoff could have
changed the ball game."
Curtice was referring to two
unlucky breaks, both of which
were capitalized upon fur touch
downs by Washington, which
made the score in Stanford's 29-
10 loss much more lopsidied I ban
the game really was.
"THOSE FELLOWS have been
improving every week," stated
Curtice, and the performance on
the field backed up his statement.
'"They were hitting harder, block
ing better tremendous machine
work." The only problem was
that against a team like Washing
ton you can't even afford to make
one mistake.
Probably Ihe biggest turning
point in the game was the fum
bled punt which Washington re
covered early in the fourth quar
ter on the Stanford 40. Sopho
more safety man Gary Craig
didn't actually fumble the ball:
he was hit high, low and in the
middle by three huge Huskies the
moment the hall hit his fingers.
The only amazing thing was that
he wasn't killed.
At the time, the Indians had
just marched to their first touch
down and thrown the Washington
passer for a total loss of 16 yards
in two plays. With a full quarter
to go and only trailing by seven
points, it is conceivable that they
might have come on to win.
CURTICE EXCUSED Craig's

error in not calling for a fair
catch on the basis of inexperience
and the fact that he probably did
not see the men coming. "If he
diid see them," Cactus Jack com
mented wryly, "and still didn't
call for a fair catch, he's got more
guts than I have."
The coach was questioned about
the decision of quarterback Dick
Norman to try a field goal with
22 seconds remaining in the first
half and the Indians behind, 17-3.
Kicking at an angle from the 32
yard line. Skip Face missed.
"Well, maybe we should have
tried for a touchdown- run may
be one or two more plays, then
ll ied the field goal," Curtice con
ceded. But he pointed out that if
Stanford had made the kick and
I hen scored twice later, which the
Indians nearly did, they would
not have had to worry about mak
ing a two-point conversion.
IT IS LIKELY also that the
Indians remembered the Wash
ington State game three weeks
ago. In that one, Stanford trailed
by one point in the fourth quar
ter. With a first down on the 25,
Norman elected to try to get a
little closer before trying the
game-winning field goal. On the
next play Washington State in
tercepted a pass.
Overall, it was the best game
played so far by Stanford. Cur
tice's platooning kept the squad

fresh, so that the team played a
i better second half, especially in
I the third period.
Once again injuries hurt. Skip
Face hanged his knee in the open
i ing minutes, and the team's lead
ing ball carrier was no use ex
cept as a kicker. First stringers
| Chuck Morehouse and Dale Os
trander suffered spike wounds, al
i though Ostrander returned to
play with four stitches in his
hand.
The Indian front line was the
equal of Washington's in head
knocking and tackling, and the
! only problem in the secondary
was lack of speed, as Curtice
said: "They'll hit you if they can
catch you."
Cactus Jack recalled that he
had promised ihe writers before
the season started that he would
win at least one "big one," and
that he hadn't yet come through.
"We're still gonna get it."he
added. "Who knows, maybe Big
Game."

caught that punt when we were
only behind 17-10," sighed Coach
Jack Curtice wishfully after the
game. "That and the fumble on
their first kickoff could have
changed the ball game."
Curtice was referring to two
unlucky breaks, both of which
were capitalized upon fur touch
downs by Washington, which
made the score in Stanford's 29-
10 loss much more lopsidied I ban
the game really was.
"THOSE FELLOWS have been
improving every week," stated
Curtice, and the performance on
the field backed up his statement.
'"They were hitting harder, block
ing better tremendous machine
work." The only problem was
that against a team like Washing
ton you can't even afford to make
one mistake.
Probably Ihe biggest turning
point in the game was the fum
bled punt which Washington re
covered early in the fourth quar
ter on the Stanford 40. Sopho
more safety man Gary Craig
didn't actually fumble the ball:
he was hit high, low and in the
middle by three huge Huskies the
moment the hall hit his fingers.
The only amazing thing was that
he wasn't killed.
At the time, the Indians had
just marched to their first touch
down and thrown the Washington
passer for a total loss of 16 yards
in two plays. With a full quarter
to go and only trailing by seven
points, it is conceivable that they
might have come on to win.
CURTICE EXCUSED Craig's

error in not calling for a fair
catch on the basis of inexperience
and the fact that he probably did
not see the men coming. "If he
diid see them," Cactus Jack com
mented wryly, "and still didn't
call for a fair catch, he's got more
guts than I have."
The coach was questioned about
the decision of quarterback Dick
Norman to try a field goal with
22 seconds remaining in the first
half and the Indians behind, 17-3.
Kicking at an angle from the 32
yard line. Skip Face missed.
"Well, maybe we should have
tried for a touchdown- run may
be one or two more plays, then
ll ied the field goal," Curtice con
ceded. But he pointed out that if
Stanford had made the kick and
I hen scored twice later, which the
Indians nearly did, they would
not have had to worry about mak
ing a two-point conversion.
IT IS LIKELY also that the
Indians remembered the Wash
ington State game three weeks
ago. In that one, Stanford trailed
by one point in the fourth quar
ter. With a first down on the 25,
Norman elected to try to get a
little closer before trying the
game-winning field goal. On the
next play Washington State in
tercepted a pass.
Overall, it was the best game
played so far by Stanford. Cur
tice's platooning kept the squad

fresh, so that the team played a
i better second half, especially in
I the third period.
Once again injuries hurt. Skip
Face hanged his knee in the open
i ing minutes, and the team's lead
ing ball carrier was no use ex
cept as a kicker. First stringers

trander suffered spike wounds, al
i though Ostrander returned to
play with four stitches in his
hand.
The Indian front line was the
equal of Washington's in head
knocking and tackling, and the

was lack of speed, as Curtice
said: "They'll hit you if they can
catch you."
Cactus Jack recalled that he

game. "That and the fumble on
their first kickoff could have
changed the ball game."
Curtice was referring to two
unlucky breaks, both of which
were capitalized upon fur touch
downs by Washington, which
made the score in Stanford's 29-
10 loss much more lopsidied I ban
the game really was.
"THOSE FELLOWS have been
improving every week," stated
Curtice, and the performance on
the field backed up his statement.
'"They were hitting harder, block
ing better tremendous machine
work." The only problem was
that against a team like Washing
ton you can't even afford to make
one mistake.
Probably Ihe biggest turning
point in the game was the fum
bled punt which Washington re
covered early in the fourth quar
ter on the Stanford 40. Sopho
more safety man Gary Craig
didn't actually fumble the ball:
he was hit high, low and in the
middle by three huge Huskies the
moment the hall hit his fingers.
The only amazing thing was that
he wasn't killed.
At the time, the Indians had
just marched to their first touch
down and thrown the Washington
passer for a total loss of 16 yards
in two plays. With a full quarter
to go and only trailing by seven
points, it is conceivable that they
might have come on to win.
CURTICE EXCUSED Craig's

error in not calling for a fair
catch on the basis of inexperience
and the fact that he probably did
not see the men coming. "If he
diid see them," Cactus Jack com
mented wryly, "and still didn't
call for a fair catch, he's got more
guts than I have."
The coach was questioned about
the decision of quarterback Dick
Norman to try a field goal with
22 seconds remaining in the first
half and the Indians behind, 17-3.
Kicking at an angle from the 32
yard line. Skip Face missed.
"Well, maybe we should have
tried for a touchdown- run may
be one or two more plays, then
ll ied the field goal," Curtice con
ceded. But he pointed out that if
Stanford had made the kick and
I hen scored twice later, which the
Indians nearly did, they would
not have had to worry about mak
ing a two-point conversion.
IT IS LIKELY also that the
Indians remembered the Wash
ington State game three weeks
ago. In that one, Stanford trailed
by one point in the fourth quar
ter. With a first down on the 25,
Norman elected to try to get a
little closer before trying the
game-winning field goal. On the
next play Washington State in
tercepted a pass.
Overall, it was the best game
played so far by Stanford. Cur
tice's platooning kept the squad

fresh, so that the team played a
i better second half, especially in
I the third period.
Once again injuries hurt. Skip
Face hanged his knee in the open
i ing minutes, and the team's lead
ing ball carrier was no use ex
cept as a kicker. First stringers
| Chuck Morehouse and Dale Os
trander suffered spike wounds, al
i though Ostrander returned to
play with four stitches in his
hand.
The Indian front line was the
equal of Washington's in head
knocking and tackling, and the
! only problem in the secondary
was lack of speed, as Curtice
said: "They'll hit you if they can
catch you."
Cactus Jack recalled that he
had promised ihe writers before
the season started that he would
win at least one "big one," and
that he hadn't yet come through.
"We're still gonna get it."he
added. "Who knows, maybe Big
Game."
"I'd sure like to have seen what
would have happened if we had
caught that punt when we were
only behind 17-10," sighed Coach
