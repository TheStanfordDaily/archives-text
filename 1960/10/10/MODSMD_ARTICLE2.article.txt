### 
SALEM, Ohio — (UPI)— Sen.
John F. Kenned y, storming a
friendly Ohio again, hit Vice Pres
ident Richard M. Nixon's claim
of rising U.S. prestige last night
with a record of "road to dis
aster" votes in the United Na
tions.
The Democratic Presidential
nominee called particular atten
tion to Saturday's U.N. vote on
admission of Red China on which
he said, "Only two [African]
countries voted with us." He said
the record of the U.S. support in
the United Nations has fallen
from 85 per cent in 1952 to 56
per cent in 1960.
Of the votes over the years,
he said: "I think they are the
handwriting on the wall. I think
they point the way to the road
of disaster. I think that direction
must be reversed."
MEANWHILE, in Billings,
Mont., Nixon accused Kennedy of
selling a brand of "federalism"
which, if adopted, would lead to
greater inflation and higher taxes.
The Vice President also accused
his Democratic opponent of in
venting foreign policy issues and
advocating international strategy
which would place the United
States in a disadvantageous posi
tion with her neighbors of the
world community.
Nixon spent a quiet day in

I Billings, resting for one of the!
i more intensive weeks of his cam
| paign. The GOP candidate was
i working toward his home state
j of California where he will at*
I tempt to win its big bloc of 32
electoral votes by concentrating!
j on the southern part of the state
j this week.
Early yesterday morning the
1 Vice President slipped away from
his hotel and spent about three
hours wandering around Billings
alone. Although he still suffered
a cold, he walked much of the
time in a light rain without a hat.
What he wanted was the solitude
; and freedom to window shop, to |
I have breakfast virtually unno-1
' ticed and to attend church serv- J
i ices with no fanfare or advance j
I notice.
HK WAS A little short of cash
| and before leaving the hotel, he 1
I borrowed $2.50 from a Billingsj
| policeman, Patrolman Dennis
j Holm, who was stationed outside
j his door.
People in the restaur a nt, I
! "Esquire Fine Foods," couldn't j
| believe their eyes when Nixon j
walked in. his topcoat collar'
turned up around his ears against
I the chilly rain. He selected an un- 1
i occupied booth and ordered an j
: 85-cent breakfast which was
j served by Mrs. Ginny Powell, who
[fortunately left her Kennedy but
ton at home yesterday.

SALEM, Ohio — (UPI)— Sen.
John F. Kenned y, storming a
friendly Ohio again, hit Vice Pres
ident Richard M. Nixon's claim
of rising U.S. prestige last night
with a record of "road to dis
aster" votes in the United Na
tions.
The Democratic Presidential
nominee called particular atten
tion to Saturday's U.N. vote on
admission of Red China on which
he said, "Only two [African]
countries voted with us." He said
the record of the U.S. support in
the United Nations has fallen
from 85 per cent in 1952 to 56
per cent in 1960.
Of the votes over the years,
he said: "I think they are the
handwriting on the wall. I think
they point the way to the road
of disaster. I think that direction
must be reversed."
MEANWHILE, in Billings,
Mont., Nixon accused Kennedy of
selling a brand of "federalism"
which, if adopted, would lead to
greater inflation and higher taxes.
The Vice President also accused
his Democratic opponent of in
venting foreign policy issues and
advocating international strategy
which would place the United
States in a disadvantageous posi
tion with her neighbors of the
world community.
Nixon spent a quiet day in

I Billings, resting for one of the!
