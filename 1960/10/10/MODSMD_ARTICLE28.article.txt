# Scholarship Deadline Soon

### 
Now that Britain has upped the
number of awards from 12 to 24
annually, more university stu
dents than ever before are ex
pected to apply for Marshall
Scholarships this year.
The scholarships, set up by
Britain after World War 11, in
gratitude for aid received through
the American Marshall Plan, are
awarded to graduate students
from U.S. universities for a mini
mum of two years study at Brit
ish universities of their choice.
Candidates for this year's scho
larships are required to submit
application by Oct. 31. To
be eligible, they must not be over
26 years old by Oct. 1, 1961. All
costs of travel, tuition, and living
are paid by the scholarship, with
an extra allowance provided for
married male scholars. Selection
is made on basis of the applicant's
demonstrated intellectual capac
ity, and his ability to play an
active part in the life of the com
munity and university.
Further information and appli
cation forms may be obtained
through the Stanford graduate
division.
