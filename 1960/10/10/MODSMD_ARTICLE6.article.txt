### 
Stanford in France was offi- J
I dally dedicated Saturday before a (
i host of high French and Ameri- j
lean officials gathered at the {
| Tours City Hall.
Wednesday, the Italian branch |
of the University will be dedicated
in Florence's historic Palazzo j
Vecchio.
Principal speakers at Satur
day's ceremonies were Louis j
Joxe, French Minister of Educa-1
tion. and President Wallace Ster
ling.
Highlights from the text of
Sterling's speech follow:
"My Stanford colleagues and I
| have long looked forward to this
! occasion. It is four years since we
i conceived the idea of having Stan-
I ford Study Centers overseas.
I From the outset we have hoped—
I indeed, we have considered it ;
l mandatory—that one would be lo- j
: cated in France. The realization I
| of our hopes depended upon our
finding a facility which would
accommodate our students and
faculty and which we could af
j ford. Imagine our delight in hav
| ing found in this historic Loire
Valley arid the City of Tours a
j facility whose appointments and
location exceed our fondest expec
! tations. It represents a dream
t come true. . . .
"WE REALIZE that the oppor
tunity to travel and study abroad
has long been a pari and fre
quently the capstone- of liberal
' education. Stanford's overseas |
I study program is. therefore, in
accord with a noble tradition.
"We realize, too, that this op
portunity has generally been the
I prerogative of the wealthy. In the
I Stanford program, this preroga
tive does not obtain. A large pro
portion of Stanford students work
to earn a substantial part of the ,
• costs of their education.
"Rut regardless of their finan
cial circumstance, those who come
i here now have in common the
1 sjood fortune of living and study-!
! ing in the Touraine, whence camej
| Balzac and Rabelais. Surely an;
environment with such a rich I
I cultural and intellectual heritage
is an irleal place in which to ad
i vance one's liberal education. . . .
"THEV (Stanford students)
[ have come here to learn. You will j
I find them to he eager students. |
! We want them to take advantage j
I of their stay here by acquiring i
' facility in the use of the French i
1 language. But I would emphasize j
i that the main burden of their |
studies will be in rigorous courses
I which they would take if they
| were at Stanford in California, I
land that these courses will be!
taught by members of the Stan
ford faculty.
"May I repeat my thanks lo all
who have worked with us to make
this center possible. All of you
who have come to this ceremony '
compliment us by your presence
for which we are profoundly
I grateful." J
