# Red China Acceptance in U.N. Nearing-Nehru

### 
NEW YORK <UPI> India's
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Neh
ru ended his United States visit
yesterday convinced that the ma
jority of world opinion, even in
cluding the United States, was
moving t owa r d acceptance of
Communist China in the United
Nations.
Without the lierl Chinese in the
organization, he said, it would be
impossible to negotiate world dis
armament.
The U.N. general assembly de
feated by the smallest margin in
its history Saturday a proposal
that Red Chinese membership be
considered. Soviet Premier Nikita
S. Khrushchev immediately de
clared this meant the U.S. was
"losing" its fight against admis
sion of the country.
NKHRU, several hours before
his departure by air for India,

said that the U.N. "summit" con
ference had not made very much
difference in the state of world
affairs.
After two weeks here, he said
he felt the chances of a continu
ing peace were stronger than
a hot war, however.
"1 do not mean to say that this
particular meeting here has made
very much difference," he said.
. . AT this recent General
Assembly meeting of the United
Nations in a sense the atmosphere
was good, in another sense it
was vitiated by anger on various
sides which came in the way, and
suspicions, and even if there was
nothing to be suspicious about it
comes up because one doesn't
trust each other.
"It's a difficult position in the
world, a very difficult one, and
one should not allow it to drift
but should take steps to meet it."
