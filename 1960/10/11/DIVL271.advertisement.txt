THE CHURCH
(i.e not a piece of architecture, not
the ordained ministry, not some par
ticular set of pieties,—BUT—the
totality of the Redemptive Commu
nity, locally present and given a fair
chance to enter into dialogue with
the larger community of its environ
ment) —
HELPS THE
UNIVERSITY
(i.e. the academic community, the
totality of faculty, staff and stu
dents)
TO BE THE
UNIVERSITY
(i.e. what historically it was de
signed to be, —not a congeries of
unrelated disciplines, not a collection
of atomized scientiae, but—a place
of mind-stretching and of intellec
tual integrity, where even in the
course of some specialized discipline,
the ultimate unity of knowledge is
appreciated, and something of the
secret of its wholeness is acquired.
