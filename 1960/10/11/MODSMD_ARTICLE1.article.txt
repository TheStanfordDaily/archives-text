# Pauling Accepts Subpena
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI > - Dr.
Linus Pauling reversed an earlier
stand late today and agreed to
appear today before ihe Senate
Internal Security Subcommittee.
Pauling yesterday said he
would ignore a subpena to ap
pear in the Subcommittee's in
vestigation of his petitions to ban
nuclear testing. But a spokesman
late tonight said the Subcommit
tee had served Pauling with an
other subpena and that, on advice
of his lawyer, he would appear
today.
IN ANOTIIKIi action concern
ing Pauling today, however, the
court with the consent of all
parties dismissed the appeal of
a group headed by Pauling which
has sued to halt U.S. nuclear tests.
After the appeal had been filed,
the Pauling group agreed with
the government that the issue was
not ripe for a ruling since no
nuclear tests are now being con
ducted.
The group including residents
of eight countries, contends the
Atomic Energy Act is unconstitu
tional and does not authorize set
ting off nuclear explosions which
create radiation hazards.
The main issue for Pauling
today was the fact that the court
did not rule on his appeal on the
nuclear-ban petition, which is the
reason he was seeking a Subcom
mittee postponement of tomor
row's hearing.
THE Sl'BC OMMITTEE wants
to know who circulated petitions
among scientists throughout the
world asking the United Nations
to seek international agreements
banning further nuclear testing.
Pauling said he had no objec
tion to supplying the committee
with photographic copies of orig
inal signatures. But he said he
would refuse to divulge who
helped him collect them.
The California Institute of
Technology scientists said he had
been treated "unfairly" by Sen.
Thomas J. Dood. D-Conn., acting
chairman of the Subcommittee.
He accused the committee of ha
rassing him by making false ex
planations of documents when it
knew the true explanations.
"THE SUBCOMMITTEE is a
disgrace to the Senate, the Amer
ican people and the country, and
should be abolished," Pauling
said.
He said he felt the same way
about the House Committee on
Un-American Activities.
Pauling said tho Subcommittee
was trying to "achieve the dis
ruption of the peace movement in
the United States." He said that
what he called the committee's
attack on him was part of a larger
attack on the peace movement by
people who want the cold war
continued, with its "billions in
profits."
He accused the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Defense De
partment of opposing official gov
ernment policy on nuclear test
bans. He said there was "a great
propaganda effort" to make nu
clear war acceptable.
Pauling also disputed theories
that expenditures of $100 million
or more for fallout shelters would
save up to To per - cent of the
American people in a nuclear
war. Ho said at best it could save
only 15 per cent.

Un-American Activities.
Pauling said tho Subcommittee
was trying to "achieve the dis
ruption of the peace movement in
the United States." He said that
what he called the committee's
attack on him was part of a larger
attack on the peace movement by
people who want the cold war
continued, with its "billions in
profits."
He accused the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Defense De
partment of opposing official gov
ernment policy on nuclear test
bans. He said there was "a great
propaganda effort" to make nu
clear war acceptable.
Pauling also disputed theories
that expenditures of $100 million
or more for fallout shelters would
save up to To per - cent of the
American people in a nuclear
war. Ho said at best it could save
only 15 per cent.
WASHINGTON (UPI > - Dr.
Linus Pauling reversed an earlier
stand late today and agreed to
appear today before ihe Senate
Internal Security Subcommittee.
Pauling yesterday said he
would ignore a subpena to ap
pear in the Subcommittee's in
vestigation of his petitions to ban
nuclear testing. But a spokesman
late tonight said the Subcommit
tee had served Pauling with an
other subpena and that, on advice
of his lawyer, he would appear
today.
IN ANOTIIKIi action concern
ing Pauling today, however, the
court with the consent of all
parties dismissed the appeal of
a group headed by Pauling which
has sued to halt U.S. nuclear tests.
After the appeal had been filed,
the Pauling group agreed with
the government that the issue was
not ripe for a ruling since no
nuclear tests are now being con
ducted.
The group including residents
of eight countries, contends the
Atomic Energy Act is unconstitu
tional and does not authorize set
ting off nuclear explosions which
create radiation hazards.
The main issue for Pauling
today was the fact that the court
did not rule on his appeal on the
nuclear-ban petition, which is the
reason he was seeking a Subcom
mittee postponement of tomor
row's hearing.
THE Sl'BC OMMITTEE wants
to know who circulated petitions
among scientists throughout the
world asking the United Nations
to seek international agreements
banning further nuclear testing.
Pauling said he had no objec
tion to supplying the committee
with photographic copies of orig
inal signatures. But he said he
would refuse to divulge who
helped him collect them.
The California Institute of
Technology scientists said he had
been treated "unfairly" by Sen.
Thomas J. Dood. D-Conn., acting
chairman of the Subcommittee.
He accused the committee of ha
rassing him by making false ex
planations of documents when it
knew the true explanations.
"THE SUBCOMMITTEE is a
disgrace to the Senate, the Amer
ican people and the country, and
should be abolished," Pauling
said.
He said he felt the same way
about the House Committee on
Un-American Activities.
