# Boat Topic Of Seminar
## 
### 
The Monitor, world's fast
est sailboat and one of the
few hydrofoil craft now ex
isting, will be the subject of
the Fluid Mechanics Seminar
to be held today at 4 p.m.
in Stanford's Guggenheim
Laboratory.
Professor Robert H. Can
non, Jr., of the Aeronautical
and Electrical Engineering
Departments, will conduct the
seminar and will show a mo
tion picture of the Monitor.
Cannon helped to develop
the Monitor for the Office of
Naval Research during the
1940'5. The craft exceeds 30
miles an hour in a 15 mph
wind- a speedy nearly double
that of the best America
Cup boats. She sails like any
other sailboat until she at
tains 12 miles per hour.
Then she climbs two to
three feet out of water on
her hydrofoils, steel blades
attached to the hull and ex
tending down into the water.
At high speeds the foils, de
signed to cut through the
waves instead of riding on
them, lift the hull just as air
plane wings support the
plane.
