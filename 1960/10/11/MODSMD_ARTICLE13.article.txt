# Keio Scholar Here for Year
## 
### 
Eiichi Ishii, 22, is this year's
exchange student from Keio Uni
versity in Tokyo. After obtaining
his A.B. degree in economics, he
is interested in studying business
administration.
In his junior year at Keio Eii
chi served as president of the eco
nomic department. During this
time he was involved in many
student discussions concerning
revision of the United States-Jap
anese security treaty.
Eiichi would like to talk with
students here about the political
movement in Japan and all inter
ested in such discussions can con
tact him at Stern Hall, his resi
dence for- this quarter.
In addition to politics, Eiichi
enjoys spending time at volley
ball, swimming, and skiing.
One brief impression of the
United States is that American
students can live comfortably un
' tier capitalism while Japanese
students are faced at present with
j choosing whether their country
I shall live under capitalism or so
: cialism.
