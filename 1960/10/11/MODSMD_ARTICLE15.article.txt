# Complete Text of Chester Bowles' Speech
## 
### 
But if we are going to make
this community of interest grow,
then we've got 1o show a much
better understanding of the
world's people, and I suggest as
part of this understanding and
effort to get this understanding,
we go hack and re-examine Sec
retary Marshall's speech to Har
vard on June 7, 1947, in which
he laid out the Marshall Plan,
and also Mr. Truman's Point Four
Program in January '49.
He spoke in ringing, positive
terms of a partnership between
the American people and the
people of Europe and later the
people of the under-developed
areas. This wasn't the rich, fat,
beneficent American handing
down her dimes and quarters and
nickels to the poor people of the
world.
Rather it was America work
ing wit li tlie world, with Europe,
with Asia, with Latin America
trying to build a better world
society. This was an exciting
period and we thought creatively
and affirmatively and positively
in this period and we did some
great things in this period.
The Korean war blasted our
program, our positive program,
by bringing us a whole new sense
of insecurity. Suddenly we found
ourselves faced with the fact that
the Soviet Union had sent an
army, armed by them, across a
borderline on an aggressive ac
tion.
We reasoned that if they did
this in Korea, they'd do it in the
Middle East, they'd do it in the
Far East, they'd do it in Europe.
So we rushed into a military
minded negativism, which is very
natural. To some degree this is
also necessary, because we had
allowed our military apparatus to
grow rusty.
Nevertheless, it diverted us
from the positive task of eco
nomic and political development
and growth. I think we're now
recapturing some of our original
creativeness and understanding of
these major forces throughout
the world. But the next adminis
tration is going to be supremely
tested on this all-important point.
We'll have to realize as we ap
proach this world that people
want more than just things. They
want more than just a little more
rice. They want more than just
another village industry, or even
a doctor when their child is sick.
They also want a sense of be
longing, of participation, of feel
ing they are part of a community,
a neighborhood, a country, a na
tion, a world. They also want an
increasing sense of justice. They
want to feel that justice is in
creasing, the distribution of land,
and the money no longer has the
grip on them that he used to have.
That they are not forced to work
for some feudal landlord. They
want these things as kind of a
bundle.
They want not simply a better
life, but a broader life, a life that
frees them as individuals to be
individuals and to become what j
they are capable of being. Now!
this is something we should tin- j
derstand, but the point is that we j
don't understand it.
We talk too often as though
we ourselves have been bitten a '
bit by the Marxist bug. We say
we're a great country, because we j
produce more bathubs, more cars, |
bigger missiles, longer-range
planes and all kinds of wonder
ful things, that this makes us
better.
This isn't what makes us bet
ter. What makes us good and de
cent and right and powerful is
the ideals and principles and phil
osophy that was laid down origi
nally in our Declaration of Inde
pendence and which we have car
ried forward, not always success
fully, not always without many
setbacks, not always with very
great dedication.
But inevitably we've returned
to these principles and the im
portant point is that these prin
ciples are the very principles that
now are motivating mankind. It's
no accident that when you go
around the world, you see many
T h o mas Jefferson boulevards,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt streets
or that you see many Woodrow
Wilson plazas.
Areas of this world in the big
cities named after the great men,
the great liberal leaders of Ameri
can history. It's no accident that
you see so many constitutions of
the new nations beginning with
the familiar terms, "We. the
people of the Philippines," "We,
the people of the Republic of
India," "We, the people of the
Union of Burm a," and so on
straight across the world.
The ideals and the principles
that we grew up on are principles
for which the whole world is
reaching out. And this again is
no accident, because these are
universal values which belong to '
man regardless of his race, his I
creed, or his religion. It's we
Americans who have often lost,
sight of this fact. How indifferent
we were to the great meeting at
Bandung which took place in
April, 3955.
We scarcely noticed when it
was announced that this confer
ence would start on the 39th day
of April. This date was chosen
because it was the anniversary of

the beginning of the American
Revolutionary War, the battle of
Lexington and Concord when we
fired the first shot of the Ameri
can Revolution.
And the midnight ride of Paul
Revere was read from the ros
trum that night. And the agree
ments and understandings ami
resolutions signed at Bandung
dealing with the right of the in
dividual, anti-colonialism, increas
ing economic growth and peace
sounded not like Marx or Lngels
or Stalin or Mao; they sounded
much more like Lincoln or Wil
son or Roosevelt or Jefferson.
And what did our Stale Depart
ment say and how did they com
ment? Asked what they thought
abount Bandung, one spokesman
said, "We view it with benevo
lent indifference." You see, this
is the tragic gap we allowed to
occur between us and the world,
a world's people who are striving
in their own ways through their
own cultures, through their own
religions to build free societies
where the individual can stand on
his feet and be important.
And this, of course, runs totally
contrary to the Communist idea
and the Communist objective.
This is our strength, and it is a
mighty strength, and if we learn
to pose the struggle not as one
between the Russian way of life
and the American way of life.
What possibly could be more
arrogant than that? But rather
between those who believe in the
dignity of man, those who believe
in the universal values, and those
who believe that man was born
only to serve the state.
Once you pose the contest in
those terms you find the people
of India, Burma, of Africa, of
Latin America, you find them
coming together with you and if
you have the courage and decency
to say that we do not always live
up to these standards, we have
many defects in our own society,
if we come before them that way
looking at them as partners try
ing to find our way together
toward this more secure, more
rational world, the progress can
be very great.
And of course this starts back
here at home. It starts in our
school system; it starts in our
attitude toward life, family, our
community, the kind of world in
which we're trying to build all
around us. It's a real test of our
society, the decency and depth of
it, and I hope and believe that
this decency and greatness will
be forthcoming in these coming
years. What we desperately need
is a sense of purpose, and we
don't have to invent a new one.
The old one will do us very well.
The purpose that Jefferson set
down for us, and Lincoln, and
all these people who went before
us. This is the purpose of the
American people. As we spell it
out in understandable term s,
things begin to get a lot simpler,
a lot easier, a lot more under
standable. We begin to send able
people abroad, men who under
stand these things. We pass by
the big campaign contributors
who so often have gone out there
with so little understanding of the
kind of world in which we're mov
ing today.
When we propose our economic
aid programs, we don't do them
with the arrogance of rich people
trying to buy others, or trying
to rush some dollars into a breach
purely to stop Communism as
such. Last fall a year ago in
Tunisia just before the election,
I asked a Tunisian, "How many
Communist votes will there be
this year?" He said, "No more,
unhappily, than six or seven hun
dred." I said, "Why the unhap
pily?" He said, "If only there
were sixty or seventy thousand,
think of the aid that you Ameri
cans would pour into Tunisia.
But, unhappily, we have very few
communists so I expect you'll
probably pass us by."
Why is it that we have to do
good things, and positive things
only out of fear of communism?
Why is it that we rush our aid
to those countries which have
only a communist minority, a
noisy one, turning into a kind
of a resource like petroleum; a
well-worn resource that you can
cash in on in the American treas
ury. Why do we say we want to
improve our educational system
and then call it the Defense Edu
cation Act? Why do we when we
rush aid to Chile, to the earth
quake veterans of Chile, say we
must do this as a way to stop
communism in Chile?
Did we build this country be
cause we are afraid of something?
Did we from the East come out
to the West to open up this won
derful world because we're fright
ened of some foreigner or are try
ing to get even with the Rus
sians? No. we had faith, we had
hope, we had belief in ourselves
and the values that seemed very
clear to us. We didn't do these
things because we were fright
ened.
In the foreign aid bill for many
years there appeared these words:
"We must carry on this program
as long as there is a Communist
menace in the world." Therefore,
suggesting that once the Com
munist menace is over our inter
est in the world will evaporate

into thin air. This isn'l true. This
isn't right. This isn't doing jus
tice to what we really believe. Yet
this is the way we've looked to
the world for too long a time.
And 1 suggest that the great
est single objective and the great
est single responsibility of the
next President of the U.S. is to
awaken the real spirit and the
real purpose of this country, to
give people such as yourselves in
the universities of this country, a
sense of real excitement when
you graduate, a feeling that you're
going out to be a part of some
thing that is important and mov
ing and vigorous and promising,
that you're going to play your
role and your part, that you have
something to do, something im
portant to do.
If you go into business you
want to make that business a
good business with good labor
relations and you want to use
your time outside of government
to improve your community and
schools, to try to build a better
neighborhood.
If you go into government you
want to try to do that task, too,
to the utmost or in the profes
sions or whatever it may be. It's
important that the young people
in America catch this kind of
spirit. And it can only be done if
a great, educator, a man who un
derstands these principles and
ideas is in the White House spell
ing out what is required of us. Be
cause we can do what is required
of us. We can do it awfully well.
We have done it over and over
again.
For the last seven or eight
years you have had a government
which has told you that you don't
have to think very hard, that
everything is really very good,
that there aren't really any great
problems, that you don't have to
strain, that if you'll just leave
everything to the people in Wash
ington, somehow, someway, it will
be all right.
And, of course, one of the most
unpleasant things to me, one of
the most dangerous things about
this campaign is that this kind of
talk is continuing into the election
campaign debate which should be
enormously educating and chal
lenging to the American people.
But some of my Republican
friends are simply trying to make
these problems go away. They
know they're there, just as well
as I do and you do and the rest
of us do, but they feel if they can
just make them go away until
next January, then once they are
in Washington somehow they can
adapt themselves to doing some
thing about it.
But this isn't easy. This is not
at all easy, because if you lull the
American people to sleep again
and 51 or 52 per cent have bought
slumber rather than action and
thought then you're going to find
your new government will really
be up against it to try to get this
country moving as it must move.
1 feel that you have many op
portunities here that you should
be very thankful for and apprecia
tive of because you are coming
into adult life and you are moving
out into the world from the uni
versity at tiie very time of this
great dividing point in history. I
think you're going to find the
Communists, as you look at them,
are not nearly as formidable as
some people think.
The boys and girls of Hungary
fought the Soviet tanks tooth and
nail. Many of them were only
fifteen or sixteen years old. And
those boys and girls have been
in nothing but Communist schools,
they have read nothing but Com
munist books, they hear nothing
but the Communist radio. Mem
bers of my generation have rather
arrogantly said, "Well the older
people may remember what a
free life was all about, but they're
dying off now and the younger
people have been thoroughly in
doctrinated by communism and
are certainly lost to any hope of
redemption.
This just wasn't the case; the
older people didn't fight the bat
tles of Budapest, it was the young
people, your age and still younger
who did it. There is not a single
country in the world today who
has voted for communism. What
would happen if the Soviet armies
pulled out of Poland, East Ger
many, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the
rest. Practically all this area
would join Europe and would vote
for freedom and vote for a dif
ferent kind of future.
Communism hasn't succeeded
even in an area where they con
trol almost everything for a
period of lf> years. And commu
nism itself in Kussia is shot full
of holes and all sorts of contra
dictions. Mr. Khrushchev prom
ises all kinds of consumer goods.
He promises them all kinds of
comforts. As they get more con
sumer goods and comforts they
have less and less likelihood of
ever standing for war, unless the
war was, of course forced on
them.
And the Russian young people,
how can you send them into the
universities and say probe the
very deepest secrets of science,
work in the laboratories to try to
develop new discoveries for com
munism and the Soviet people, but
you are hereby forbidden to con
sider the implications of what you
discover. This is something you
can't talk about, tiic political im
pact of what you discover is ver

boten.
Obviously this is nonsense, you
open up minds and the minds are
open, young people ask questions.
! I was there in J957. The day I ar
j rived I was greeted by a very rug-
I ged, a very rough review of a
| book I had written called "New
Dimensions in Peace," in which
I compared the Russian, Chinese,
Indian and American revolutions
together, not particularly compli
mentary of the Russian. And I
suggested to say that the Ameri
can revolution itself basically and
ideologically was infinitely closer
to the stirrings all over the world.
They didn't like this book be
cause we had taken the word revo
lution and properly claimed it for
our own. So 1 was greeted with
an avalanche of very unpleasant
book reviews.
These were designed, so I was
told, to keep the Russian young
people at a proper distance from
my wife and myself as we trav
eled through Russia. What hap
pened? We ran into about 200 of
them in the libraries of Samar
klian and Uzbekistan. And we
spent two hours there with them
all sitting around the floor talk
ing endlessly about everything
to do with the world outside, our
own boys and girls, what they
were planning to do in the future,
what they were thinking of doing,
discussing education methods and
the rest.
The same thing held true in the
"University of Moscow. We spent
seven whole hours one long eve
ning talking to Russian students.
No, they can't shut this off, they
can't stifle all this, freedom is a
powerful voice, enormously pow
erful. You can coop it up for a
while but it has a power all its
own.
i We are the people who should
! understand this best of all. And
j when we dedicate ourselves to its
j value we increase the power of
I freedom everywhere.
I have a strong feeling that this
' election, as I say, will be a very
decisive one, because I happen to
i feel—l hope I won't sound too
i forward in saying this that one
political party understands what
I am talking about a whole lot
i better than the other. Now I don't
j mean for one moment that there
are not many Republican leaders,
millions of people who probably
I vote Republican, who thoroughly
i understand these things and see
1 the importance of them .
I do feel that one of the strong
I points about the Democratic
j Party, with all its defects and di
| visions, all the mistakes it's made
i in the past, is it has always been
i close to people, and respect for
| people, people who have not been
; as fortunate, perhaps, as others;
| the unemployed, the older people,
i the sick and those who have dif
ficulties of one kind or another.
But it's had also great faith in
building the country, releasing

the dynamism of America which
is so good.
1 often feel that the Republican
Party is always willing to accept
social security after it's been ac
cepted, rather reluctantly, with
many of them voting against it
when it goes through. They just
don't like the thought of an idea
like that being expanded a hit, to
take in older people over G."> so
we can be sure that they have a
doctor when they're sick and
proper hospital care without
breaking their children and their
families.
I think we've been closer to
people, I thing the party that is
closest to people in America has
the best understanding, is likely
to be most close to people
throughout the world. I don't
want to say that a party which
has never shown too much under
standing of the people of Detroit
or San Francisco or Los Angeles
is bound to run into trouble un
derstanding the people of Tokyo,
Brazzaville, New Delhi or Aearra.
But I do think there is a great
deal in that point.
In any event, whatever your
own political views and attitudes,
for Heaven's sake get into this

struggle. I hope you're all Demo
crats- I suspect you're not all
Democrats I earnestly hope you
are. If you are, get into the Demo
cratic Party, make it better, make
it stronger, bring all your youth
and vision and confidence to bear.
And if you want to be Republican,
if you must be Republican, for
Heaven's sake, don't stand aside
but get in the Republican Party
and see if you can improve it;
Heaven knows it needs it.
But whatever you do, you can
not afford to stay on the sidelines.
This world struggle is a struggle
in which you are going to play a
very great part. People are grow
ing up your ages all over the
world. I met many thousands of
them in India. 1 spoke to a hun
dred different colleges and uni
versities in India. I spoke to uni
versity students in Japan and
many parts of Europe and Africa,
too. The young people of the
world have a great deal in com
mon. They can communicate to
gether perhaps better than the
people of my age.
Nobody wants war, everybody
wants more opportunity, more
freedom. There are all kinds of
different arguments as to how we

are going to {jot it and facing you
is this doctrinaire and ruthless
Communist ideology that tried to
prevent the inevitable from hap
pening. Tile question is not
whether there will some day be a
world of human dignity and
brotherhood, hilt when is it com
ing? And how last and how much
destruction must there he before
we can make it possible?
I suggest that you were very
wise in the lime lhat you were
all born. You picked a very proper
time to become of age. You're
light on the edge of very great
things. The possibilities are in
finitely dangerous, they are also
infinitely promising.
I think if we all get into this
and give our all to it we're going
to see a new age being born in
these coming years. This may
not occur, but at least if it does
not occur, let us be very sure
that we have tried and tried hard
as every great leader of the past
would have wanted us to, as I
think Mr. Kennedy will lead lis
to do it he is elected President of
the United States next January.
Thank you.
