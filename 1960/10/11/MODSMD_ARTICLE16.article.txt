IT'S about that time of year when sports "experts" lake a look at
Stanford football and explain or try to point out why the Indians are
continually losing games and losing crowds at those contests. Well,
to prove that ibis writer is no exception let's take a look at the situa
tion. Even though we get around 90,000 fans to the biggest social

weekend of the year i.e. the Big
Game with Cal the scores and
plays have always been exciting
enough to merit that attendance.
But what about the rest of the
season. Obviously to get those
large crowds at Stanford games
we not only will have to play top
notch teams but also to win at
least half of our games, some
thing we haven't done since 1957.
During the 1956 season with Bro
die, Wiggin, Camera and Valli we
played O.S.C. here in front of a
crowd of 66,000 fans.
This year, on a beautiful day
we played one of the top teams
in the nation Washington to
the tune of only 23,000 people and
this was Parents Day besides we
expected that our parents didn't
know what kind of games we've
been playing here. Obviously this
change in attendance can bo di-

rectly attributed to the style of play that may be seen on the gridiron
every Saturday on the Farm.
No matter how hard we try to exhort fans to come or stay through
out the games no one can blame students or enthusiasts alike for
sitting through a didl and losing football game.
So again obviously, the way to solve our football attendance prob
lem is to improve team performance. Let's take a look at the many
reasons given by so-called experts, coaches, players and those close
to the team for Stanford's poor showing up to date.
PROBABLY the most universal truth of Stanford football this year
is general lack of team speed. Naturally it's hard enough to cover
men on defense let alone break away for a score if the other team
has four or five men faster than any of the Indians. Our backs may
look small and fast but any yardage they've gotten has been the
broken field type a la Chuck Shea or Lou Valli. Certainly we could
have gained a lot more yards against the HusKies if our ball carriers
could have gotten to the holes quicker.
Obviously the losses of Dick Bowers, Ben Robinson, Chris Burford
and Irv Nikolai via graduation have hurt the famous Card passing
attack, but there will always be graduation.
When all of the new Tribesmen find out for the first time that
they can play winning football, the season just might become inter
esting for a full 60 minutes every Saturday. Next weekend's game
with San Jose State will be tough and should be an exciting one.
No Stanford gridder wants to go through the disgrace of losing to
our neighbors to the south something that hasn't happened around
here since 1953,
Just the Facts, Spartan Daily
Sj>eaking of that Spartan tilt this Saturday, we must comment on
a highly enlightening editorial by a Mr. Jim Ragsdale in the Spartan
Daily. Amidst cries of "snobbery, discourtesy" and "money the
leveler," Mr. Ragsdale has written quite a tale of woe concerning
SJS's rooting section.
It seems that the Spartans always take their Stanford game a lot
more seriously than people around here and so Spartan Daily felt
that their "crisis" was worthy of an accusing editorial. They were
critical of their seating-—which starts at ihe 30 not the 15 yardline
as reported; having to pay a dollar to get in let us remind Ihe
Spartan that it cost,s money to run an athletic program and certainly
Stanford students help support USC. UCLA or Cal to a larger extent
(i.e. $1.50 - $2.00 per game) than the 50 cents paid by each Spartan
rooter to our athletic department; and that they weren't given more
consideration than other visiting teams in choice of seats—the cur
rent Big Five procedure is to put all visiting rooters from the 30
yard line to the end zone which facilitates season ticket sales for the
year because 50 yard line seats are easier to sell to season ticket
holders.
We recommend that San Jose build a stadium down Ihere large
enough so that they can have the game for a change and all its
accompanying problems. We do hope that Mr. Ragsdale will give
the State students a fairer and more accurate pitch for attendance
at the game Saturday. Perhaps he will spend more time on getting
the facts before attempting an expose.

thing we haven't done since 1957.
During the 1956 season with Bro
die, Wiggin, Camera and Valli we
played O.S.C. here in front of a
crowd of 66,000 fans.
This year, on a beautiful day
we played one of the top teams
in the nation Washington to
the tune of only 23,000 people and
this was Parents Day besides we
expected that our parents didn't
know what kind of games we've
been playing here. Obviously this
change in attendance can bo di-

rectly attributed to the style of play that may be seen on the gridiron
every Saturday on the Farm.
No matter how hard we try to exhort fans to come or stay through
out the games no one can blame students or enthusiasts alike for
sitting through a didl and losing football game.
So again obviously, the way to solve our football attendance prob
lem is to improve team performance. Let's take a look at the many
reasons given by so-called experts, coaches, players and those close
to the team for Stanford's poor showing up to date.
PROBABLY the most universal truth of Stanford football this year
is general lack of team speed. Naturally it's hard enough to cover
men on defense let alone break away for a score if the other team
has four or five men faster than any of the Indians. Our backs may
look small and fast but any yardage they've gotten has been the
broken field type a la Chuck Shea or Lou Valli. Certainly we could
have gained a lot more yards against the HusKies if our ball carriers
could have gotten to the holes quicker.
Obviously the losses of Dick Bowers, Ben Robinson, Chris Burford
and Irv Nikolai via graduation have hurt the famous Card passing
attack, but there will always be graduation.
When all of the new Tribesmen find out for the first time that
they can play winning football, the season just might become inter
esting for a full 60 minutes every Saturday. Next weekend's game
with San Jose State will be tough and should be an exciting one.
No Stanford gridder wants to go through the disgrace of losing to
our neighbors to the south something that hasn't happened around
here since 1953,
Just the Facts, Spartan Daily
Sj>eaking of that Spartan tilt this Saturday, we must comment on
a highly enlightening editorial by a Mr. Jim Ragsdale in the Spartan
Daily. Amidst cries of "snobbery, discourtesy" and "money the
leveler," Mr. Ragsdale has written quite a tale of woe concerning
SJS's rooting section.
It seems that the Spartans always take their Stanford game a lot
more seriously than people around here and so Spartan Daily felt
that their "crisis" was worthy of an accusing editorial. They were
critical of their seating-—which starts at ihe 30 not the 15 yardline
as reported; having to pay a dollar to get in let us remind Ihe
Spartan that it cost,s money to run an athletic program and certainly
Stanford students help support USC. UCLA or Cal to a larger extent
(i.e. $1.50 - $2.00 per game) than the 50 cents paid by each Spartan
rooter to our athletic department; and that they weren't given more
consideration than other visiting teams in choice of seats—the cur
rent Big Five procedure is to put all visiting rooters from the 30
yard line to the end zone which facilitates season ticket sales for the
year because 50 yard line seats are easier to sell to season ticket
holders.
We recommend that San Jose build a stadium down Ihere large
enough so that they can have the game for a change and all its
accompanying problems. We do hope that Mr. Ragsdale will give
the State students a fairer and more accurate pitch for attendance
at the game Saturday. Perhaps he will spend more time on getting
the facts before attempting an expose.

IT'S about that time of year when sports "experts" lake a look at
Stanford football and explain or try to point out why the Indians are
continually losing games and losing crowds at those contests. Well,
to prove that ibis writer is no exception let's take a look at the situa
tion. Even though we get around 90,000 fans to the biggest social

weekend of the year i.e. the Big
Game with Cal the scores and

enough to merit that attendance.

No matter how hard we try to exhort fans to come or stay through
out the games no one can blame students or enthusiasts alike for
sitting through a didl and losing football game.
So again obviously, the way to solve our football attendance prob
lem is to improve team performance. Let's take a look at the many
reasons given by so-called experts, coaches, players and those close
to the team for Stanford's poor showing up to date.
PROBABLY the most universal truth of Stanford football this year
is general lack of team speed. Naturally it's hard enough to cover
men on defense let alone break away for a score if the other team
has four or five men faster than any of the Indians. Our backs may
look small and fast but any yardage they've gotten has been the
broken field type a la Chuck Shea or Lou Valli. Certainly we could
have gained a lot more yards against the HusKies if our ball carriers
could have gotten to the holes quicker.
Obviously the losses of Dick Bowers, Ben Robinson, Chris Burford
and Irv Nikolai via graduation have hurt the famous Card passing
attack, but there will always be graduation.
When all of the new Tribesmen find out for the first time that
they can play winning football, the season just might become inter
esting for a full 60 minutes every Saturday. Next weekend's game
with San Jose State will be tough and should be an exciting one.
No Stanford gridder wants to go through the disgrace of losing to
our neighbors to the south something that hasn't happened around
here since 1953,
Just the Facts, Spartan Daily
Sj>eaking of that Spartan tilt this Saturday, we must comment on
a highly enlightening editorial by a Mr. Jim Ragsdale in the Spartan
Daily. Amidst cries of "snobbery, discourtesy" and "money the
leveler," Mr. Ragsdale has written quite a tale of woe concerning
SJS's rooting section.
It seems that the Spartans always take their Stanford game a lot
more seriously than people around here and so Spartan Daily felt
that their "crisis" was worthy of an accusing editorial. They were
critical of their seating-—which starts at ihe 30 not the 15 yardline
as reported; having to pay a dollar to get in let us remind Ihe
Spartan that it cost,s money to run an athletic program and certainly
Stanford students help support USC. UCLA or Cal to a larger extent
(i.e. $1.50 - $2.00 per game) than the 50 cents paid by each Spartan
rooter to our athletic department; and that they weren't given more
consideration than other visiting teams in choice of seats—the cur
rent Big Five procedure is to put all visiting rooters from the 30
yard line to the end zone which facilitates season ticket sales for the
year because 50 yard line seats are easier to sell to season ticket
holders.
We recommend that San Jose build a stadium down Ihere large
enough so that they can have the game for a change and all its
accompanying problems. We do hope that Mr. Ragsdale will give
the State students a fairer and more accurate pitch for attendance
at the game Saturday. Perhaps he will spend more time on getting
the facts before attempting an expose.

IT'S about that time of year when sports "experts" lake a look at
Stanford football and explain or try to point out why the Indians are
continually losing games and losing crowds at those contests. Well,
to prove that ibis writer is no exception let's take a look at the situa
tion. Even though we get around 90,000 fans to the biggest social

weekend of the year i.e. the Big
Game with Cal the scores and
plays have always been exciting
enough to merit that attendance.
But what about the rest of the
season. Obviously to get those
large crowds at Stanford games
we not only will have to play top
notch teams but also to win at
least half of our games, some
thing we haven't done since 1957.
During the 1956 season with Bro
die, Wiggin, Camera and Valli we
played O.S.C. here in front of a
crowd of 66,000 fans.
This year, on a beautiful day
we played one of the top teams
in the nation Washington to
the tune of only 23,000 people and
this was Parents Day besides we
expected that our parents didn't
know what kind of games we've
been playing here. Obviously this
change in attendance can bo di-

rectly attributed to the style of play that may be seen on the gridiron
every Saturday on the Farm.
