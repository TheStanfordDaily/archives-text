# Indian Soccer Team Breezes to Victory
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
THE Stanford varsity soccer squad won its first league contest
of the season Saturday without even breathing hard, as it triumphec
over San Jose State 51.
The victory was even easier than the onesided score indicates
After giving up a goal early in the first quarter, the Card defense
toughened up so much that San | -

Jose could get only three shots
at the goal during the remainder
of the game.
After spotting Ihc Spartans a
1-0 lead, Stanford tied the score
lato in the first quarter when Em
manuel Andah stole the ball from
a San Jose defender, drove around
two men to break into the clear
and rammed the ball under the
goalie's frantic dive.
STANFORD went ahead to
stay on the first of Bernie
Knaggs' two penalty kicks and
then with a minute to go in the
half Rune Engebrettsen increased
the count to 3-1.
Shortly after the second half
began, the Indians began moving
the ball deep into Spartan terri
tory at will and only needlessly
missed shots and alert Spartan
goal tending kept the score from
passing ten.
While it was the Indian offense
that scored the goals, the defen
sive backfield really dominated
the game.
Time and again Dan Farthing,
Dick Voake, Rusty Williams and
especially Knaggs and Jan Achen
bach contained the Spartans 1o
such an extent that the game
seemed to be played almost en
tirely on Ihe San Jose half of the
field.
After the game, Stanford Soc
cer Coach Fred Priddle singled
out Knaggs, Achenbach, and Ad
am Bianehi as the outstanding
players of ihe game, although he
added that every player on the
field, even the substitutes had a
share in the victory.
IN A preliminary game, the
Stanford JV team dumped the
Spartan JV's 2-0, as the Indians
continued to be unscored upon
this season. Stanford goals were
made by Roberto Santa-Cruz on
a penalty kick, and John Whitely
on a goal from the field.
