## Northway Number 1 
### 
LITTLE but speedy John
Northway led a widely spaced
string of runners across Iho fin
ish line Friday to cement his po
sition as No. 1 man on the Stan
ford Cross Country squad.
The winning time of 16 min
utes 12.3 seconds was five sec
onds better than Northway's best
three-mile time last year, when
he was third man behind Keith
Wallace and Bob Monzingo. The
second finisher, Rich Klier, fol
lowed Northway by around a hun
dred yards and brought the
pleased comment, "He's miles
ahead of last year," from Coach
Jordan.
JORDAN called the meet a
"satisfactory first workout," but
felt that more work was needed
on grouping the runners closely.
The first four men ran in a
bunch, but Jordan feels that he
needs to move three more men
up into the first group.
Chief hopes to fill these posi
tions rest with the next four fin
ishers, Frank VV alia ce, Larry
Shal'er, Bruce Johnson and Robin
Nowinski, and Dave Boore, who
did not run.
