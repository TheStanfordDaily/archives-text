# End Predicted for Honor Code Without Students' Support, Says Linneman
## 
### PAT REIN HART 
Dean of Students Donald Winbigler and Fundamental Standard
Committee Chairman Bob Linneman last night presented a challenge
to the Branner freshmen—the challenge of maintaining the Honor
System.
In a brief address on "The meaning of Integrity," Winbigler

stressed the importance of hon
esty throughout life, particularly
in the intellectual realm. Recent
evidence of college cheating
shows that some universities have
failed to instil a true sense of
honor in their students. Even an
honor code is not an absolute
guarantee of integrity, lie de
clared. It requires that students
accept responsibility and work to
maintain high standards of honor.
Linneman then presented some
basic facts about Stanford's Honor
Code. This is a crucial year for
the system, he said, for an in
crease of cheating has been noted.
Unless the students begin to take
the Code more seriously, advisory
councils have hinted that this may
be its last year.
ACCORDING TO Linneman,
three basic problems must be
solved. Each student must accept
the responsibility for stopping
possible cheating before it starts,
each must resist the social pres
sures exerted upon those who re
port violations, and each must be
strong enough to declare his own
belief in the principles of the
Honor Code.
Since it was the Stanford stu
dents who requested an Honor
Code, Linneman declared, it is
they who must restore it to its
former prominence. Appealing to
the members of the Class of '64,
Stanford's newest students, he
challenged them to stand united
as defenders of Ihe Honor Code
and the ideals it represents.
