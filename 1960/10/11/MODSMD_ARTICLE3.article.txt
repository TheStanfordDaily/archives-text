## 
### SONYA MICHEL 
Seventy-five students gathered
in the Muir Lounge of Stern last
night to hear artist Benjamin
Buffano speak about his new
statue, tho "Penguin of Peace,"
newly erected in the patio be
tween Muir and Burbank Houses.
Dr. Wilfred Stone, faculty resi
dent at Stern, felt that the 9' 8"
high Egyptian stone statue would
add life and vitality to a court
yard that badly needed it.and
that the value to the 200 students
who would see it daily over a
period of years would be immeas
urable.
Dr. Jeffrey Smith called the
sculptor the "guardian angel" of
San Francisco, and said he was a
"twentieth-century" St. Francis.
He later commented: "I only
wish Mr. Buffano could be an
artist -in â€¢ residence at Stanford,
and could create his wonderful
work while talking with the stu
dents and giving them some of
the breath of life of which he has
so much."
