NEW YORK lUPI) P. A.
Esperdy. District Director of the
U.S. Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Service, confirmed early
today a report that a crewman
from Soviet Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev's liner Baltika had
jumped ship.
Esperdy said he knew no de
tails except that the crewman
jumped ship yesterday.
IN A COPYRIGHTED story in
today's edition of the New York
Daily News, the crewman was
identified as Victor Jaanimets, 29,
an oiler from Estonia.
YESTERDAY, the News Story
said, Jaanimets slipped in one
door of a department store on the
pretext of making a quick pur
chase and ran out of another,
leaving behind the four crewmen
with whom he was on liberty. The
News said the seaman is now in
hiding.
"There is no dignity under the
Russians," the News quoted
Jaanimets as saying. "You are
treated like an animal. The Rus
sians treat the Estonians bad.
They act as conquerors . . .
Estonians are second-class fit i
zens."
Jaanimets has asked for politi
cal asylum in this country.
