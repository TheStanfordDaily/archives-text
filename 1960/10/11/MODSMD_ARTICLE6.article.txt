## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (UPIt The United States last night led the General Assembly in smoth
ering Soviet opposition and voting to put the question of the Russian repression of the Hungarian
revolution on the agenda for a full-dress U.N. debate.
The Assembly, pressing ahead with its schedule, also agreed to debate the Red Chinese rape of
Tibet, the Apartheid race segregation policies of South Africa and the Algerian War.
The vote on the Hungarian Revolt question was 54-12, with 31 abstentions. Indonesia, the new Re-

public of Mali and Yugoslavia
joined the nine-member Soviet
bloc in opposing it.
â€¢ Guinea joined these 12 in op
posing the question of Tibet, but
Tibet went on the agenda for
formal debate by a vote of 49-13,
with 35 abstentions, llussia bit
terly opposed the Tibet question.
The questions of South Africa
and Algeria were approved for
debate although South African
Foreign Minister Eric Louw at
tacked nations which condemn
South African white supremacy
while tolerating "open practice"
of racial discrimination within
their own borders. He mentioned
no names but apparently meant
the United States.
The Assembly adjourned until
tomorrow morning.
TONIGHT'S session followed a
day of general debate featuring
a speech by Moscow-trained
Sekou Toure, President of Guinea,
who charged that the United Na
tions has done more harm than
good in the Congo and should sup
port ousted Premier Patrice Lu
mumba.
"It is impossible not to place
the United Nations in the very
center of responsibility for the
confusion created in the Congo,"
the berobed Toure said, adding
that the confusion had helped
"the worst enemies of freedom."
Toure, speaking while Lumum
ba was attempting a new power
comeback in Leopoldville, pro
posed formally that Lumumba's
delegation be seated in the As
sembly. Two rival Congolese dele
gations are in New York and the
Assembly has recognized neither.
TOURE'S outspoken attack on
"imperialism and colonialism"
followed closely the line laid
down by Soviet Premier Nikita
S. Khrushchev, who sat near the
back of the hall, looking fresh
and rested after a weekend at the
Russion mansion at Glencove.
N.Y.
Although he mentioned no
names, Toure charged that "cer
tain U.N. representatives" were
involved in plots against Lumum
ba and his government.
"African opinion hascondemned
the equivocal action of the U.N.
representatives who disowned the
central Congolese government
and encourage rebellion," he said.
He did not mention the demand
of Congolese strongman Col. Jo
seph Mobutu that troops from
Guinea and Ghana be withdrawn
from the U.N. force in the Congo.
Belgium's action in seeking to
restore order after Lumumba's
National Army mutinied less
than a week after the Congo at
tained independence on June 30,
Toure said, "could only endanger
freedom and sovereignty."
