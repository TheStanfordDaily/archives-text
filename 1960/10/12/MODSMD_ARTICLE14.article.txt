Tlie Senate Internal Security Subcommittee is in 11 if news
apa in, and this time they are picking 011 one of their favorite
"problem ehilds," noted scientist Dr. Linus Pauling.
Pauling must face the subcommittee because he played an
instrumental role in issuing petitions to ban nuclear testing. The
subcommittee wants to know who issued petitions among the
world's scientists calling for nuclear test banning.
As usual) the purpose of the subpena is somewhat obscure.
Il seems as if the subcommittee is accusing Pauling of trying
to further peace. Pauling claims that the subcommittee's attack
on him is par! of a larger movement of people who want tlie
cold war continued with its "billions of profits."
Now Pauling's accusation is obviously ridiculous. We all know
that the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and its brother.
The House Un-American Activities Committee, stand for justice,
"Americanism," and above all, peace.
Both committees are composed of super-patriots who are tie
voting their lives to the destruction of burgeoning communism
within our borders. And they are doing a wonderful, wonder
ful job.
They've probably flushed out millions of communists in the
last five or six years. As an example of their success we have
only to look at the House Un-American Committee meeting in
San Francisco last May-
At that time many communists were ordered to appear; Cali
fornia teachers who told their students that not all is milk and
honey in the U.S., and various Bay Area organizations, usually
led by little old ladies wearing tennis shoes.
Actually, neither committee has accomplished anything but
the destruction of many lives. After a person is called to appear
it is not likely he can ever retain his job unless he is fortunate
enough to be self-employed.
People are not only left jobless, but sometimes homeless. And
what is their crime? It's vcrv simple. They are communists be
cause they don't go around waving an American flag every day
and they don't think Senator McCarthy was the greatest Ameri
can of them all.
The existence of these two bodies is a menace to the freedoms
enumerated in the Bill of Bights. Every day thev e\i.-t. America's
ideals die a little.
It is indeed fortunate that great men such as Dr. Linus Paul
ing refuse to he intimidated by the SISS or the HUAC. If enough
people speak out against them, perhaps they will disappear.
