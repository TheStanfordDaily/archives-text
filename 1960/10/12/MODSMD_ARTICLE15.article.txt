## Honor Code Probe 
### 
What may turn out to be a
very significant event for each
Stanford student took place last
week when the student legisla
ture (LASSU) set up a commit
tee to study the apparently grow
ing number of Honor Code vio
lations and the failure of stu
dents and faculty to report vio
lators.
LASSU gave the group power
to investigate thoroughly the sit
uation and inform LASSU of its
findings. It also gave the 10-mem-1
ber committee—which will in- j
elude two faculty members—the (
go-ahead to submit proposals for I
fighting the problem, if they find j
cheating is increasing.
That there is cheating here is !
not news. We feel that some stu- j
dents always have and always 1
will cheat, in some manner, in any
school.
What is news, to us anyway, is
the establishment of such a group,
by students, to cheek up on the
honesty of their classmates, and
also to determine whether the
faculty is playing the part it
should in enforcing the Code.
A booklet published a year ago
by the ASSU states that the Code
is simply an agreement in force
since 1921 between faculty and
students that students will not
give or receive unpermitted aid
in academic work, and the in
structors will show their confi
dence in their pupils' honor by re
fraining from proctoring exams.
Both are expected to report those
they observe violating the Code.
There certainly can be no quar
rel with such an idea. Stanford is
one of the few schools where such
a system has worked successfully
for many years.
But is it working now? Dennis
Coit, chairman of Men's Council,
has strong doubts. He told LASSU
that about 500 cases of probable
Honor Code violations weren't
turned in last year.
And this, he emphasized, is
what worries him; the number of
cases he feels occurred but never
officially were reported to Men's
Council by students or faculty.
Ed Cutter, administrative as
sistant to ASSU President Larry
Hoyse, feels this "is a problem '
that's more widespread than most j
students think." li<» predicted to !

I LASSU that the committee's find
ing's "won't be very pleasing."
We believe LASSU has acted
wisely in appointing the commit
tee, for Coit is not the first re
sponsible person to report in the
last few years that the Code may
not be functioning as it should.
Let's hope the committee takes
its time and does a complete job
of digging before it tells LASSU
—and the campus—its findings.
For acceptance and participation
in the Honor Code is a basic
I tenent of the Stanford philosophy,
which stresses student inde
pendence.
It would be saddening, to say
the least, if it were found that
the average student can't be put
on his honor to use his own abil
ity in his work, or that he or his
professor won't play his part in
I enforcing the Code.

will cheat, in some manner, in any
school.
What is news, to us anyway, is
the establishment of such a group,
by students, to cheek up on the
honesty of their classmates, and
also to determine whether the
faculty is playing the part it
should in enforcing the Code.
A booklet published a year ago
by the ASSU states that the Code
is simply an agreement in force
since 1921 between faculty and
students that students will not
give or receive unpermitted aid
in academic work, and the in
structors will show their confi
dence in their pupils' honor by re
fraining from proctoring exams.
Both are expected to report those
they observe violating the Code.
There certainly can be no quar
rel with such an idea. Stanford is
one of the few schools where such
a system has worked successfully
for many years.
But is it working now? Dennis
Coit, chairman of Men's Council,
has strong doubts. He told LASSU
that about 500 cases of probable
Honor Code violations weren't
turned in last year.
And this, he emphasized, is
what worries him; the number of
cases he feels occurred but never
officially were reported to Men's
Council by students or faculty.
Ed Cutter, administrative as
sistant to ASSU President Larry
Hoyse, feels this "is a problem '
that's more widespread than most j
students think." li<» predicted to !

I LASSU that the committee's find
ing's "won't be very pleasing."
We believe LASSU has acted
wisely in appointing the commit
tee, for Coit is not the first re
sponsible person to report in the
last few years that the Code may
not be functioning as it should.
Let's hope the committee takes
its time and does a complete job
of digging before it tells LASSU
—and the campus—its findings.
For acceptance and participation
in the Honor Code is a basic
I tenent of the Stanford philosophy,
which stresses student inde
pendence.
It would be saddening, to say
the least, if it were found that
the average student can't be put
on his honor to use his own abil
ity in his work, or that he or his
professor won't play his part in
I enforcing the Code.
What may turn out to be a
very significant event for each
Stanford student took place last
week when the student legisla
ture (LASSU) set up a commit
tee to study the apparently grow
ing number of Honor Code vio
lations and the failure of stu
dents and faculty to report vio
lators.
LASSU gave the group power
to investigate thoroughly the sit
uation and inform LASSU of its
findings. It also gave the 10-mem-1
ber committee—which will in- j
elude two faculty members—the (
go-ahead to submit proposals for I
fighting the problem, if they find j
cheating is increasing.
That there is cheating here is !
not news. We feel that some stu- j
dents always have and always 1
will cheat, in some manner, in any
