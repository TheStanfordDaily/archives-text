Editor, the Daily:
Cheers for Mike McGinnis for
urging the Library to order the
air-mail edition of "The New York
Times."
I also was shocked to learn that
the "Times" arrives here four
days after it appeared at the
newsstands, but a staff member
quickly consoled me by explain
ing that . . we don't have local
papers air-mailed out here from
New York."
Undiscouraged, I went to see
the Director of Libraries, Mr.
Grieder, and urged him to have
at least one copy delivered by air.
A recent letter from Mr. Grie
der tells me that the yearly post
age would be close to $450, and
the Library cannot afford to
spend that much.
Well, it is a substantial amount.
But are we not paying $1,000 (also
substantial, believe me) to get
the best in education? Without
the best and most recent in print
ed media, are we really getting
it?
Stanford cannot afford not to
have the air-mail edition of the
"Times." I am new here, but
trust there are many at Stanford
who seek the best.
After all, we all could have
gone to Cal.
