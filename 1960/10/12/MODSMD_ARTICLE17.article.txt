The TV debate is certain to be
come a permanent feature in cam
paigns for elective offices. But
the two debates we have seen are
experimental, and we should be
careful not to let their format and
procedure become frozen as a
precedent.
The most questionable feature
of the two debates is the sand
wiching of a panel of interroga
tors between the two debaters.
Genuine debate can be had only if
the debaters confront each other
directly, and are allowed to ask
each other questions. To let the
panel ask the questions is to rely
too much on the judgment and
on the unconscious bias of the
members of the panel.
But there is an even more com
pelling reason, I submit, why we
must not let this format establish
itself as a precedent for the fu
ture. It is, to speak frankly, that
it is highly corruptible. 1 do not,
of course, think for a moment
that there is a shadow of doubt
about the distinguished corre
spondents who have appeared in
tlie two debates. But the fact is
that the present format is a quiz
show, and, if the political quiz
show becomes the accepted for
mat not only for presidential can
didates but for all other candi
dates, the temptation to rig the
show is in many cases almost
certain to become too strong to be
resisted. As in the quiz shows the
prize is too great and the tempta
tion is too strong and corruption
is too easy.
Turning to questions of sub
stance, there is the discussion of
the offshore Chinese islands of
Quemoy and Matsu. In response
to Mr. Edward Morgan's question,
Sen. Kennedy had said that the
islands were strategically inde
fensible, that Ihey are not essen
tial to the defense of Formosa,
and that he was in favor of per
suading the Chinese Nationalists
to pull their troops out of these
islands and back to Formosa.
Mr. Nixon's reply was that the
islands are "unimportant," that
"the few people who live on these
islands are not too important."
"It's the principle involved." What
principle? "These two islands are
in the area of freedom. The Na
tionalists have these two islands.
We should not force our Nation
alist allies to get off of them and
give them to the Communists."
So we have to defend Quemoy
and Matsu as a matter of princi
ple. But the Vice President seems
to have forgotten, or he is hoping
that the rest of us have forgotten,
that five years ago—to be pre
cise, in January and February
1955 —President Eisenhower and
Secretary Dulles were quite un
aware of the existence of Mr.
Nixon's "principle." For it was
then that they induced our Na
tionalist; allies to evacuate their
troops from the Tachen Islands,
and they used the United States
7th Fleet to help the Chinese evac
uation.
Why did President Eisenhower
and Secretary Dulles abandon the
islands which were in the area of
freedom? Because Secretary Dul
les in his press conference of Jan.
18, 1955 said, "I would not say that
the Tachen Islands are in any
sense essential to the defense of
Formosa and the Pescadores,
which we do regard as vital to
us."
This is precisely the reason Sen.
Kennedy gave why we should do

in Quomoy and Matsu what we
did in the Tachens induce the
Chinese Nationalists to evacuate
them because they are not es
sential to the defense of Formosa
and the Pescadores.
Why, it is fair to ask, did Presi
dent Eisenhower and Secretary
Dulles not apply the same princi
ple that of strategic importance
in tho defense of Formosa—to
Quemoy and Matsu? Tho true
answer is that they might have
| done so, but Chaing had too much
j political support in the persons
of Sens. Knowland and Jenner.
The Administration could not and
did not push the matter through.
But the Eisenhower administra
tion has, nevertheless, regarded
Quemoy and Matsu as something
to live with, not something to re
joice over.
This came into the open in 1958.
In tin' first week of October Mr.
, Herter, then Under Secretary of
State, made a speech saying that
Quemoy and Matsu were not
"strategically defensible" and that
the Nationalist preoccupation
with these islands was "almost
pathological." The next day Sec
j retary Dulles said at a press con
i fere nee that "it has been rather
foolish of Chaing to have so many
of his troops on Quemoy." The
j following day President Eisen
hower at his press conference said
; that "as a soldier" he believed it
I was unwise for the Nationalists
to have put so large a force on
Quemoy and Matsn. For "as of
themselves" they "are not greatly
j vital to Formosa."
The difference between the po
! sition taken by the President and
! Mr. Dulles on the one hand and
i that adopted by Mr. Nixon in the
j debate on Friday is very wide
indeed. For never until Friday
I night on TV did these wretched
islands become a matter of moral
principle and not a subject for
political, diplomatic, and strate
gic calculation.
My view is that Mr. Nixon is
too noble. He is too reckless with
his principles. He ought to come
down to the lower level where
statesmen have to work.
