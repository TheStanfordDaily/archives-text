One can hardly fail 1o notice
i the new wall which cuts off pas
sage between Ihe Cellar and the
Union Stoie. The store is now
separate, spacious and neat.
While on one side of the wall
is space for book racks, on the
other side is space enough to
park a Volkswagen. Furthermore,
the store is now free of mere
browsers and passers-through,
and need henceforth be bothered
only by those who enter with in
tent 1o buy, an advantage that
any salesman can readily appre
ciate.
All this would be trivial but for
two reasons. First, where pur
chase of non-academic goods is
already difficult, enough, one
wonders if the loss of mutual
customers to the store and the
Cellar can bo afforded.
Secondly, the same concept of
an integrated building which en
gendered this wall may also be
applied to the Tresidder Memorial
, Union. There is time and a place
j for everything, but never the
] twain shall meet.
