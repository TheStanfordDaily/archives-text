Editor, fhe Daily:
i Tho lelter by Mr. McGinnis in
I ho Daily for October 4. in which
he protests tho failure of tho
University Library to receive tho
air mail edition of the New York
Times, is Iho second complaint
receiver! on this score since the
beginning of the Fall Quarter, it
therefore seems worth while to
state briefly iho reasons for our
decision in this matter, and ihe
present situation with respect
to this newspaper.
The subscription costs, plus
postage, for daily and Sunday
editions of the Times total about
$500 a year, which seems a very
high price to pay in view of the
amount of prompt newspaper cov
erage now available in the Li
brary. A point worth making in
this connection is the fact that
the air mail edition of the Sunday
Times, which is most eagerly
sought, often arrives on Wednes
day, whereas the regular mail
edition arrives on Thursday.
The University Libraries now
! receive the San Francisco Chron
icle, the San Francisco Examiner,
j the Sacramento Union, and the
: San Jose Mercury on the date of
issue; and the Los Angeles Times
arrives on the following day.
These, despite their limitations,
1 offer a considerable coverage of
national and international news
very promptly.
We are well aware of the
: unique place of the New York
Times among American news
papers, and recognize that Ihere
is no real substitute for it as a
research tool; but we believe that
i its research values are served by
' our present coverage, which com
prise the regular mail edition, a
microfilm edition which is es
sential for preservation and costs
us $190, besides an extra copy of
the Sunday edition and a third
copy of the New York Times
Book Review. A number of de
partments—i.e., Political Science,
Law and Communications and

Journalism- also receive the reg
ular mail edition.

Editor, the Daily:
No one needs an organization
to inform them of ihe meaning of
the Cuban revolution; it is evi
dent to all what the revolution
has become. We need rather to
think of ways to combat the men
ace of communism in the revolu
tion.
Our problem is how best to
apply the Monroe doctrine 1o
Cuba, how best to block the plans
of a foreign government to ex
tend its form of government to
ihe United States and to our sis
ter republics. For the growing
Communist influence in the

Americas is not so much a sub
ject to he informed about as to be
informed against, since to know
of it is to he gravely concerned
over it.
I suggest one possible course
of action, which though imperfect
is a start. Of course the armed
forces of the U.S. could never he
used today as they were in the
past, but let us agitate in the
Organization of American States
to protect Hie interests of the en
tire hemisphere.
A force of men, volunteers or
even regular soldiers, organized
completely through the OAS
might he able to overthrow the
present government in Cuba, re
storing the people's freedoms and
supervise free elections, thereby
removing this foothold for for
eign interference in the affairs of
the Western Hemisphere.

No one needs an organization
to inform them of ihe meaning of
the Cuban revolution; it is evi
dent to all what the revolution
has become. We need rather to
think of ways to combat the men
ace of communism in the revolu
tion.
Our problem is how best to
apply the Monroe doctrine 1o
Cuba, how best to block the plans
of a foreign government to ex
tend its form of government to
ihe United States and to our sis
ter republics. For the growing
Communist influence in the

Americas is not so much a sub
ject to he informed about as to be
informed against, since to know
of it is to he gravely concerned
over it.
I suggest one possible course
of action, which though imperfect
is a start. Of course the armed
forces of the U.S. could never he
used today as they were in the
past, but let us agitate in the
Organization of American States
to protect Hie interests of the en
tire hemisphere.
A force of men, volunteers or
even regular soldiers, organized
completely through the OAS
might he able to overthrow the
present government in Cuba, re
storing the people's freedoms and
supervise free elections, thereby
removing this foothold for for
eign interference in the affairs of
the Western Hemisphere.

i Tho lelter by Mr. McGinnis in
I ho Daily for October 4. in which
he protests tho failure of tho
University Library to receive tho
air mail edition of the New York
Times, is Iho second complaint
receiver! on this score since the
beginning of the Fall Quarter, it
therefore seems worth while to
state briefly iho reasons for our
decision in this matter, and ihe
present situation with respect
to this newspaper.
The subscription costs, plus
postage, for daily and Sunday
editions of the Times total about
$500 a year, which seems a very
high price to pay in view of the
amount of prompt newspaper cov
erage now available in the Li
brary. A point worth making in
this connection is the fact that
the air mail edition of the Sunday
Times, which is most eagerly
sought, often arrives on Wednes
day, whereas the regular mail
edition arrives on Thursday.
The University Libraries now
! receive the San Francisco Chron
icle, the San Francisco Examiner,
j the Sacramento Union, and the
: San Jose Mercury on the date of
issue; and the Los Angeles Times
arrives on the following day.
These, despite their limitations,
1 offer a considerable coverage of
national and international news
very promptly.
We are well aware of the
: unique place of the New York
Times among American news
papers, and recognize that Ihere
is no real substitute for it as a
research tool; but we believe that
i its research values are served by
' our present coverage, which com
prise the regular mail edition, a
microfilm edition which is es
sential for preservation and costs
us $190, besides an extra copy of
the Sunday edition and a third
copy of the New York Times
Book Review. A number of de
partments—i.e., Political Science,
Law and Communications and

Journalism- also receive the reg
ular mail edition.
