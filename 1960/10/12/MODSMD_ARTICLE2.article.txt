# 'Penguin' Interpreted By Bufano
## 
### SONY A MICHEL 
Reactions to "The Penguin," an i
Egyptian stone statue by San
Francisco sculptor Benjamin Bu-'
fano have been mixed. Standing !
in the patio between Muir and I
Burbank Houses of Stern, the;
statue has aroused comments
from all members of Stern. And
whether faculty resident Profes
sor Wilfred Stone's comment: "I
hope more such statues will be
come a part of house life," reflects
the majority of opinions is doubt-'
fill.
Professor Jeffery Smith, intro-;
during Bufano to a discussion
group in Stern Monday night,
summed up the general criticism
of all Bufano's controversial j
work. He said most people found j
its main fault was simplicity.
BUT SMITH countered: "All
great things are simple. This is j
true of the penguin. (It has) ex
traordinary and profound sim
plicity." St. Francis was so naive :
and simple as to preach to the]
birds," he said.
Bufano's close rapport and com
munication with stone was com- i
parable to St. Francis's nearness
to nature, Smith felt. Through
the quick actions of his hands,
Bufano reached the depths of
soul and creativity.
"The sophisticated, over-intel
lectual Stanford students have at |
last a simple a statue as "The
Penguin" to see day after day.
It is praying for peace. St. Francis
would be pleased," Smith con
cluded.
BUFANO opened the discus
sion with the comment, "After all
that praise, people would prob
ably like to put poison in my cof
fee. But it is the people who are
controversial. I'm not the oneâ€”l
try to bo simple. We live in such a
complicated world that simplicity
becomes complicated."
"If I can use one line, why use j
two?" was the essence of his I
philosophy.
Replying to a question on why
the statue was a symbol of peace.
Bufano explaned that when ex- j
plorers went to the South Pole, ]
the penguins showed no fear in
mingling with the people and |
were at peace with them. The two i
smaller penguins nestling at the
feet of the large one also sym
bolized contentment.
The sculptor continued, "We
must try to have a reverence for
life. The moment we realize this j
force we begin to live.
"To live as close to beauty, to j
be as beautiful as possible, is the ;
aim of life."
