# Oz and Ends

FOUR LOSSES in a row is a discouraging way to start a football
season and when one considers thai Stanford has won only five
games out of Iheir last 24 contests over a three-year period, that
word discouraging is definitely an understatement. The situation
calls for a large supply of black armbands and a heavy pallor of
gloom.
The downturn in Stanford football fortunes came with the first
game in the 1958 campaign when the Indians lost their opener to
Washington State in a 40-ti thumping. Since then there have been
quite a few losses that clearly could have gone either way. Anyone

who witnessed the last two Big
Games or some of the recent Ore
gon-Stanford frays knows just
how close the Indians can come
to winning without actually end
ing up ahead. This season the
Cards wasted no time getting
back in form when they lost their
first game, finishing one point
behind Washington State, 15-14.
It looks as if Stanford is the
determined brush salesman who
always gets one foot across the
threshold before the door is
slammed.
WHY THE lo â– sses?
One reason, of course, is the
oft repeated point of high admis
sion standards and its reiteration
has not lessened its truth. Admis
sion requirements are the same
for both athletes and non-athletes,
thu-s narrowing the field of avail
able recruits to only a small per-

rentage of high school seniors. Once the rare athlete-scholar has
been located, Stanford, which doesn't offer free rides, must com
pete with the service acadamies, which do offer free rides, for his
services.
AT STANFORD the athlete is usually not an especially privileged
person. Football players practice after class hours are over and
they make their grades without the extensive special tutoring re
quired in some of the football mills.
Consider Tom McDonald, a senior and a reserve end on the varsity
football team. He played high school ball for Corcoran, a small
town south of Fresno, came to Stanford in 1956 and made the l'rosh
team, didn't go out the next year and has been a reserve end on the
varsity for the past three seasons.
Tom was awarded an academic scholarship in high school, not
an athletic grant.
THE INTERESTING thing about Tom McDonald is not his foot
ball record at Stanford, but rather his reasons fof turning out for
the team. Certainly there isn't much prestige or publicity involved
and he doesn't have to play to keep up an athletic scholarship. It
isn't a matter of making a sacrifice for the school or some ideal . . .
it's just a case of doing something he enjoys doing.
Here is an example of football in a proper perspective. Anyone
who takes part in some activity, who plays in the band or manages
the soccer team, is doing it because the participation holds some
special brand of appeal. It's an attitude that as easily applies to
football as to the less glamorous pastimes.
The difficulty is trying to compete in a winning fashion against
schools where this attitude does not exist.
Over the past seasons more than 6.000 student season tickets
have been sold annually and that, oc-curing in a school with an under
graduate enrollment of little more than 5,000, is a tremendous show
ing. Perhaps football is supported at Stanford on a large scale
because it is run more like a sport than a business.
With a program such as Stanford's the fans have to get ac
customed to losses and losing seasons. But eventually some games
are won and the wins are just that much more satisfying.
