# Pirates Ready
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH (UPI) — The
comeback Pittsburgh Pirates were
"all set" tonight on the eve of the
sixth game of the World Series
while the New York Yankees
nervously debated a pitching
choice to keep themselves alive.
The battling Bucs, who had
fought back at alien Yankee Sta
dium to a three-to-two name lead,
were back on their home ground
with fireballing Bob Friend ready
for an attempt to close it out to
morrow—and Vernon (Deacon)
Law resting in the event it went
seven games.
Yankee Manager, Casey Sten
gel. has to decide between Bob
Turley and Whitey Ford.
