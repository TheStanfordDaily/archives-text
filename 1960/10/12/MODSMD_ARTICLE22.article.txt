# Intra-County Contest Big Game to Spartans
## Daily Sports 
### 
San Jose State may be the underdog in this Saturday's contest
at Stanford Stadium, but the Spartans are likely to put up quite
! a scrap in what is for them, at least, a "big game." In fact, Coach
Bob Titchenal commented, "My boys are so high I only hope they
don't tie up," in the game billed as the Championship of Santa Clara

County.
San Jose depends on much the'
same wide-open offense employed '
by Stanford, and this always
makes for an exciting, if sloppy,
contest, such as the 54-38 "track
meet" which sot a record last !
year.
ONCE AGAIN this year, the:
Spartans have the speed to make'
such an offense click, and this
could prove a problem in Stan
ford's slow secondary. Fleet flank-!
erback Mack Burton and right
half Willie Williams, a 9.5 j
sprinter, are both refugees from
the track team.
But the leading rusher on the
squad is an unheralded sopho
more, Johnny Johnson, who scored
all of the Spartans' touchdowns in
their season opening 21-8 win over
Brigham Young. Also dangerous |
is fullback Kent Rockholt, who
scored two touchdowns against
the Indians last year. Rockholt
is also an outstanding punter,
with a 46-yard average.
Probably Ihe most dangerous j
feature of the San Jose offense, j
however, is the passing of quar-1
terbacks Mike Jones and Chon
Gallegos. Tossing especially to !
Burton, Williams, and Doug Mc-
Chesney, Jones and Gallegos have
completed 28 out of 49 passes for ;
344 yards and a completion per- j
centage of 58.9. This, it might be :
pointed out, is considerably better !
than Dick Norman has been doing. '
AN< HORING TIIE Sparta n
line are guards Dick Erler and

Herb Yamasaki. Erler turned in
an especially good defensive per
formance in last week's contest,
while Yamasaki picked off one of
Norman's passes in the opening
minutes of last year's game
against the Indians and returned
it 24 yards for a score.
Titchenal admitted that last
week's 33-0 loss to Oregon was
"a terrible game," but excused his
team on the basis of inexperience,
a week's layoff before the game,
bad weather, and unsuccessful
gambling on fourth-down plays.
