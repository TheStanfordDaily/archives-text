# On Campus with Max Shulman
## WHAT TO DO TILL THE PSYCHIATRIST COMES 
### Author of "I Was a Teen-age Dwarf", "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis", etc 
Oner upon :i time at the University of Virginia there was a
cued named, oddly enough, Virginia University who was hand
some and kindly and intelligent and ingeniously constructed
and majoring in psychology. Virginia went steady with a young
man on campus named, oddly enough, Uddlv Enough who was
supple and lair and lit lie and animated and majoring in phys ed.
\ irginia and Oddly enjoyed a romance that was as idyllic as
a summer day, as placid as a niillpond. Never did they light
never, never, never!—because Virginia, who was majoring in
psychology, did not believe in lighting. "Fighting," she often
said, "settles nothing. The scientific way is to look calmly for
the cause of the friction."
So whenever she and Oddly were on the verge of a quarrel,
she used to whip out a series of ink blot tests and they would
discover the true underlying cause of their dispute and deal
with it in an enlightened, dispassionate manner. Then, the
irritant removed, their romance would resume its tranquil,
serene, unruffled coursc.

After six months of this sedate liaison, Oddly was so bored
he could spit. He loved Virginia well enough, but he also be
lieved that people in love ought to fight now and then. "It
opens the pores," he said. '"And besides, it's so much lun mak
ing up afterwards."
But Virginia would not be provoked into a quarrel. < )ne night
()ddly tried very hard. "Hey," he said to her, "your nose looks
like a banana, and your cars look like radar antenna, and your
face l<>ok- like a pan of worms."
"My goodness, we're hostile tonight!" said Virginia cheerfully
and whipped 120 Rorschach cards out of her reticule. "Come,"
she said, "let us examine your psychic apparatus."
Oddly tried again. "You're fat and dumb and disagreeable,"
he said, "and you'll be bald before you're thirty."
"Ilium," said Virginia thoughtfully and lit a cigarette. "This
sounds like an anxiety neurosis with totemism, anagogic trauma,
and a belt in the back."
"1 hate you," said Oddly. "I hate your looks and your clothes
and your toenails and your relatives and the cigarettes you
smoke."
"Now, hold on, buster!" cried Virginia, her eyes crackling,
her color mounting, her nostrils aflame. "Just keep a civil
tongue in your stupid head when you talk about Marlboro!
Nobody's knocking that filter, that flavor, that pack or flip-top
box while there's breath in my body! It's a full-flavored smoke,
it's a doozy, it's a dilly, it's a gas —and anybody who says a
word against it gets this."
My "this" Virginia meant a series of combinations to the
head and liver, which she now delivered to Oddly and turned
on lier heel and stormed away.
Oddly brought her down with a flying tackle. "I love you
with all my heart," he said.
"And Marlboro?" said she.
"And Marll>oro even more," said lie.
And they kissed and plaited love knots in one another's hair
and were married at Whitsuntide and smoked happily ever after.
