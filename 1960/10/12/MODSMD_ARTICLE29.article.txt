# Mills to Hear Gov. Ribicoff
## 
### 
Governor Abraham A. Ribicoff
of Connecticut will give an ad
dress at Mills College in Oakland
this afternoon at 4 o'clock.
The popular two-term Demo
cratic governor will speak under
the auspices of the bi-partisan
Mills College Political Forum.
Ribicoff is noted for the reform
program which he instituted in
Connecticut, a program including
such stringent traffic law enforce
ment that his state now has the
j lowest traffic death toll in the
: nation.
Ribicoff's visit to Mills will be
; one of a series of visits by leaders
1 of the Democratic Party to col-
J leges and universities in Cali
] fornia during the Presidential
I campaign. Adlai Stevenson, Men
nen Williams, and Chester Bowles
have already addressed student
: audiences in the state.
Sweeping into office every Dem
ocratic candidate in Connecticut
for congressional and state office,
Ribicoff was re-elected in 1958 by
an unprecedented majority.
