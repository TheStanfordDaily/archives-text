# ELECTION PREDICTION
## Bean Names Kennedy On Basis of History 
### JUDY SEABORG 
According to all historic indications, John Kennedy will be the
next president of the United States according to economic analyst
Louis H. Bean, who demonstrated his convictions to a capacity au
dience last night in Emkelspiel Auditorium.
By the use of charts showing Congressional political trends

since the formation of the two
parly system in 1854. Bean demon
strated the correlation between
economic depression and the
change of party in office.
While admitting that both the
1956 and the coming national
elections have shown a definite
diversity from the normal tides,
Bean hesitantly maintained that
"all things being equal, the presi
dency could be won by the Demo
crats."
BEAN, who described his voca
tion as the "useless sport of pre
dicting elections," stated that al
though religion would be a major
I issue in the coming election, the 1
j Democrats would receive the ad
j vantage in the number of states
j which would shift sides because
| of the issue. He stated that one of
| the variables in the election has
; been caused by the fact that the
I Democrats "have not nominated
j a typical candidate."
History has shown that the
: president and the majority of the
: Congress have been of the same
political party. Bean attributed
i the divergence from this trend in
! the 1956 election to the "influence
! of Eisenhower's popularity," and
the "development of the Suez
! crisis during the last few days of
! the campaign."
ANOTHER METHOD of predic
ation which has been proven his
torically accurate is the California
pro-convention polls which have
I been taken since 1936. Bean, who
; stated that "as California goes,
so goes the nation," quoted the
j July 1960 poll as having been
! 49 per cent in favor of Kennedy,
i The poll in the past has also
j "always understated" the Demo
crats percentage. This could
: mean, then, that California may
have up to 53 per cent Democratic
' majority.
Discussing the failure of this
' decade's Congress to reach his
expected level of power. Bean
: blamed the "Eisenhower influ
ence on the American Congress."
Describing the South as a "po
litical universe by itself," Bean
: declined to predict how it would
vote in the November election,
but stated that California and
New York, at least, would go
I Democratic.
HE CONCLUDED his lecture
to the Tuesday Evening Series au
dience with the statement that
"the country today is in a close
race with a Kennedy edge to it."
Bean, who had had a 30-year
career in government, mostly
I with the Department of Agricul
ture. is now a private economic
1 consultant.
