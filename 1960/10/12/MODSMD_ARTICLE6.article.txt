## 
### 
ASSU Business Manager
Todd Stewart yesterday peer
ed out from behind the pile
of ordered but unclaimed
1960 Quads cluttering up his
office and appealed for help.
Stewart reported more than
50 yearbooks which were or
dered by individuals and Uni
versity living groups last
year are gathering dust in
his office.
He urges any person or
representative from a resi
dence which ordered a Quad
but doesn't have it to check
at the ASSU office as soon
as possible.
