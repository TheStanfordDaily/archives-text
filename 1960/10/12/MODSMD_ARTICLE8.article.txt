# K Says No Hope' For Disarmament
## US Lacks Guts, All Will Die In Next War 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. I UPI i
- Premier Nikita Khrushchev yes
terday made the stormiest and
most intemperate speech of his
United Nations visit, taunting the
United States with a Jack of
"guts" and warning delegates
they would die themselves in an
other war.
Then faced with a defeating
vote against his demand for a
full-dress debate in the Assembly
on disarmament, Khrushchev an
grily told newsmen the IJ.N. ac
tion had moved the world closer
to war.
"This is not a victory for the
cause of peace, but for the cause
of war," Khrushchev said.
Every honest man will be dis
couraged by the U.N. decision, he
said and added, "now we must
compete in the manufacture of
arms."
Asked by a reporter if there
still was any hope, Khrushchev
replied, "not at this assembly."
IN THE ASSE3IBLY, Khrush
chev was stung into a fist-waving,
shouting speech by the words of
Ambassador James J. Wadsworth
of the United States.
Wadsworth had told the Gen
eral Assembly earlier the U.S.
was prepared to discuss disarma
ment immediately but not in a
"table thumping propaganda"
spectacle of heads of government
as proposed by Khrushchev.
Khrushchev exercised the right
of reply and, at the start, he was
calm.
But he quickly discarded the
one single sheet of paper he had
brought to the rostrum and, his
face red with emotion, went into
a tirade that left delegates
stunned with its rudeness and
challenge.
The words of the American
delegate do not scare Commu
nists, he shouted.
"You haven't got the guts to
do it."
IF THE WEST wants war,
Khrushchev shouted, the Soviet
Union is ready for it.
"In our country rockets arc
coming out like sausages," he
said.
He pointed a finger at the dele
gates in the Assembly hall. If a
conflict comes, he told them, few
of those sitting here tonight would
survive it.
"If anyone," he added.
When Khrushchev walked back
to his seat directly behind the
Spanish delegation, one of the
Spaniards turned around and
shouted in his face. It appeared
for a moment the two men might
come to blows and all eyes in the
hall were focused on them.
Khrushchev shouted back, then
took his seat.
Concluded Khrushchev. "Why
don't you wake up, gentlemen?
Not all of you want peace ... if
you follow the military bloc of the
NATO alliance, mankind will
curse you. These are the horns of
the dilemma on which you are
impaled. You have to solve that
dilemma."
