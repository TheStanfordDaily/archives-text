# U2 SUCCESSOR DOWN
## Controversial 'Sky Spy' Satellite Fails to Orbit 
### 
POINT ARGUELLO, Calif. < UPI > The United States yesterday j
tried and failed to put in orbit its first Samos "Sky Spy" satellite :
â€”a two-ton giant designed as successor of the U2 reconnaisance
plane.
The Air Force announced the orbit failure two hours after the

22-fout. cigar-shaped satellite
roared from its launch pad atop
a 77-foot At law L> intercontinental
missile. The launch appeared per- j
feet, with the rocket vehicle turn-j
ing southward in a clear blue sky 1
toward its intended polar orbit, j
The second stage ignited success
fully.
There was no immediate expla
nation for the failure of Samos I J
satellite and missile observation
system. Regardless of the set
back, however, the United States
has already let it be known it
plans to orbit a series of such
satellites that could photograph j
military installations around the 1
world including those behind the I
Iron Curtain.
THE SHOT was expected to;
raise political implications, since l ,
the U.S. admitted it used U2 ob-!
servation planes for spy missions |
over Red territory. The tests were
halted after the May Day inci
dent in which a U2 plane was shot j
down. The U.S. subsequently dis-j
closed plans for such satellites as |
the Samos and offered to permit !
their use for international inspec
tion.
The proposal received a cold re
ception, however, from the Com
munist bloc.
There is no international agree
ment at this time regarding re
connaisance satellite "over
flights."
YESTERDAY'S Samos carried
test photographic equipment of
the type that could bo used to take
pictures of military installations
literally around the world. If yes
terday's shot was successful, the j
4,100-pound satellite would have
entered a north-south orbit about
300 miles from the earth making
it possible to photograh every
foot of the earth's surface.
Yesterday's launching marked j
the christening of the nation's I
third launch center, the U.S. j
Naval Missile Facility. LocationJ
of this base is a jutting section of j
coast five miles south of Van- j
den berg Air Force Base.
The highly classified Samos lias '
a 4-foot long pavload, 3 1 - feet '
wide at the base. The Air Force
would say only it contained "test
photographic equipment and re- j
lated components."
Two Midas satellites were ;
launched from Cape Canaveral,
Fla., but did not orbit. The Samos
is tho first from which world
wide reconnaisance would be pos
sible, it was indicated.
