## President Boland Breaks Gavel Pounding for Adjournment 
### 
UNITED NATIONS. N.Y. (UPI) — Nikita S. Khrushchev took
off one of his shoes yesterday and made a motion as if to throw it
at U.N. Assembly President Frederick Boland of Ireland.
The Soviet premier went into another of his astounding perform
ances during a speech by Sen. Lorenzo Sumulong of the Philippines.

Sumulong had been denounc
ing Soviet colonialism. He was in
terrupted by the Romanian dele
gate on a point of order protest
ing the "slander" of sovereign
states.
BOLANI) permitted the Philip
pine delegate to continue and it
was then that Khrushchev, sitting
in the rear of the hall, removed a
shoe. He pounded it on the table
for a time, made the throwing mo
tion and then replaced it.
Then he bounced to his feet on
a point of order and strode to the
rostrum.
Shouting once more and waving
a finger, Khrushchev demanded
that Boland halt the speech by
what the interpreter first trans
lated as "this jerk" and then
changed to "this stooge of im
perialism."
Khrushchev then turned to
ward Boland and said:
"WE LIVE on earth not by the
grace of God and not by your
grace, but by the strength of the
great Soviet peoples. You will not
be able to strangle the voice of
truth which roars and will go on
sounding the grave of colonialism
—and the sooner we bury it the
better."
Boland refused to halt t lie
speech by Sumulong, but he ad
monished* the Philippine delegate
to limit his remarks 1o the ques
tion of whether the General As
sembly or the Political Committee
should debate the question of
colonialism.
Sumulong replied that he sim
ply wanted to make crystal clear
the true meaning of "inde
pendence."
"We know the difference be
tween colonialism and between
being an independent sovereign
people," he said.
"WE HAVE been under the con
trol and subjugation of Spain, tiie
United States and Japan. We have
tasted what it means to be given
independence. We know what is
ment by real, genuine inde
pendence."
Sumulong received a rousing
wave of applause when he con
cluded.
Khrushchev charged that Bo
land took an "unequal attitude"
toward various delegates. He said
Boland had silenced a representa
tive from the Congo when he
sought to read a telegram "from
his brothers who are suffering
under imperialist colonialism."
"WHY THEN," Khrushchev do
manded, "is this stooge of Amer
ican imperialism here (Sumu
long), who is speaking before you
touching questions which obvi
ou-sly are not procedural ones."
Language experts said that the
Russian word actually used by
Khrushchev was "kholvi," mean
ing "lackey."

great Soviet peoples. You will not
be able to strangle the voice of
truth which roars and will go on
sounding the grave of colonialism
—and the sooner we bury it the
better."
Boland refused to halt t lie
speech by Sumulong, but he ad
monished* the Philippine delegate
to limit his remarks 1o the ques
tion of whether the General As
sembly or the Political Committee
should debate the question of
colonialism.
Sumulong replied that he sim
ply wanted to make crystal clear
the true meaning of "inde
pendence."
"We know the difference be
tween colonialism and between
being an independent sovereign
people," he said.
"WE HAVE been under the con
trol and subjugation of Spain, tiie
United States and Japan. We have
tasted what it means to be given
independence. We know what is
ment by real, genuine inde
pendence."
Sumulong received a rousing
wave of applause when he con
cluded.
Khrushchev charged that Bo
land took an "unequal attitude"
toward various delegates. He said
Boland had silenced a representa
tive from the Congo when he
sought to read a telegram "from
his brothers who are suffering
under imperialist colonialism."
"WHY THEN," Khrushchev do
manded, "is this stooge of Amer
ican imperialism here (Sumu
long), who is speaking before you
touching questions which obvi
ou-sly are not procedural ones."
Language experts said that the
Russian word actually used by
Khrushchev was "kholvi," mean
ing "lackey."
UNITED NATIONS. N.Y. (UPI) — Nikita S. Khrushchev took
off one of his shoes yesterday and made a motion as if to throw it
at U.N. Assembly President Frederick Boland of Ireland.
The Soviet premier went into another of his astounding perform
ances during a speech by Sen. Lorenzo Sumulong of the Philippines.

Sumulong had been denounc
ing Soviet colonialism. He was in
terrupted by the Romanian dele
gate on a point of order protest
ing the "slander" of sovereign
states.
BOLANI) permitted the Philip
pine delegate to continue and it
was then that Khrushchev, sitting
in the rear of the hall, removed a
shoe. He pounded it on the table
for a time, made the throwing mo
tion and then replaced it.
Then he bounced to his feet on
a point of order and strode to the
rostrum.
Shouting once more and waving
a finger, Khrushchev demanded
that Boland halt the speech by
what the interpreter first trans
lated as "this jerk" and then
changed to "this stooge of im
perialism."
Khrushchev then turned to
ward Boland and said:
"WE LIVE on earth not by the
grace of God and not by your
grace, but by the strength of the
great Soviet peoples. You will not
be able to strangle the voice of
truth which roars and will go on
sounding the grave of colonialism
—and the sooner we bury it the
