The two Nixon-Kennedv debates have heeii very disappointing
from one standpoint and quite enlightening from another.
They have been disappointing because the\ have not been real
debates. The distinguished newspapermen, who act as interroga
tors, have robbed the meetings of continuity. Neither candidate is
permitted to expound on any one issue since main questions are
raised, all of ynlucli must be answered briefly and somew hat poorly, j
If we are to see a true debate between the candidates the jour
nalists should he eliminated and the candidates should do all oi'
the talking. Kvcry time something becomes controversial, time
runs out and another issue must be interposed.
Tonight, the debate will follow the same pattern as the last
one: it shall cover everything from the farm problem to the ques
tion of Ked C.hina. the result being that a stud\ in depth is highl\
unlikely.
The debates have not been a total loss, however. Some knowl
edge of the candidates' stands is better than no knowledge at all.
11 is also heartening to see that neither candidate has resorted to
too many "low blows'" and that they have both conducted them
selves in a manner befitting their status.
Some people have claimed that Nixon has won the first two
debates and others think Kennedy has. It probably is not fair to
assume that either candidate has won or lost. Kennedy has made
some important points and so has Nixon, but neither has suffered
any terrible setbacks.
Kennedy was caught in a glaring contradiction in regard to
Nixon's participation in the past administration and Nixon caught
himself on a sharp nail in regard to the question of Queinoy. Aside
from these two "boners." the contest has been rather equal.
Of course, the question of personality is another matter and
it cannot be determined as to which candidate has made the better '
overall impression.
All things considered, the debates have been informative, if
not overly informative, and we hope the future election years will
also expose the candidates to the public via televised debates.

also expose the candidates to the public via televised debates.
The two Nixon-Kennedv debates have heeii very disappointing
from one standpoint and quite enlightening from another.
They have been disappointing because the\ have not been real
debates. The distinguished newspapermen, who act as interroga
tors, have robbed the meetings of continuity. Neither candidate is
permitted to expound on any one issue since main questions are
raised, all of ynlucli must be answered briefly and somew hat poorly, j
If we are to see a true debate between the candidates the jour
nalists should he eliminated and the candidates should do all oi'
the talking. Kvcry time something becomes controversial, time
runs out and another issue must be interposed.
Tonight, the debate will follow the same pattern as the last
one: it shall cover everything from the farm problem to the ques
tion of Ked C.hina. the result being that a stud\ in depth is highl\
unlikely.
The debates have not been a total loss, however. Some knowl
edge of the candidates' stands is better than no knowledge at all.
11 is also heartening to see that neither candidate has resorted to
too many "low blows'" and that they have both conducted them
selves in a manner befitting their status.
Some people have claimed that Nixon has won the first two
debates and others think Kennedy has. It probably is not fair to
assume that either candidate has won or lost. Kennedy has made
some important points and so has Nixon, but neither has suffered
any terrible setbacks.
Kennedy was caught in a glaring contradiction in regard to
Nixon's participation in the past administration and Nixon caught
himself on a sharp nail in regard to the question of Queinoy. Aside
from these two "boners." the contest has been rather equal.
Of course, the question of personality is another matter and
it cannot be determined as to which candidate has made the better '
overall impression.
All things considered, the debates have been informative, if
not overly informative, and we hope the future election years will
also expose the candidates to the public via televised debates.
