The Communist menace can
not, without violence to reality, be
considered in terms of the theo
retical contradictions inherent in
Marxism. Wrote Lenin: "Marxism
asks that various types of strug
gle be analyzed in the historic
framework." Lenin's admirable
pragmatism found its ultimate
articulation in Stalin's "ebb and
flow" theory according to which
Communists advance when real
ity is pregnant with advantage
and retreat, or. if possible, contain
when disadvantage becomes man
ifest. The doctrine of the pro
tracted conflict dictates a strat
egy for destroying the West by
feints and maneuvers, psycho
logical calibrations and diverse
constellations of violence in a
struggle located in time and
space.
"But this strategy," wrote
Robert Strauz-Hupe of the For
eign Policy Institute, "should not
be taken for one of limited war
in the style of European warfare
in the eighteenth century. It does
not rule out the final knockout
punch."
Khrushchev may bury us, be
cause only the Soviets realize that
World War 111 has existed for 10
years. The historic Western pol
icy of containment involves the
maintenance of the STATUS QUO
and the negation of future Soviet
avenues of advance. Such a policy
can never defeat Moscow; it can
at best consolidate our present
possessions. Critics fashionably
indict "containment for ALL
Western losses. This is demon
strably false. China and much of
Eastern Europe would not have
fallen through containment strat
egy. Wrote George F. Kennan,
Acheson's prime advisor of Soviet
Affairs, "Roosevelt had won a
great internal political victory at
home . . . by coming down to the
level of the small man . . . Roose
velt was convinced he could in
fluence the Soviets too, in a sim
ilar way. He expected that they
too would react favorably to a
friendly smile and a strong dose
of Roosevelt charm." "This naivete
of tlie president and of his ad
visors Is the key to his whole
policy toward the Soviet Union."
The China problem is more
complex. Secretary of State Mar
shall, acting on the bizarre advise
of Davies, Service, Vincent, Emer
son and the Communist infiltra
ted I.P.R. had assumed that the
Chinese Communists were simply
"agrarian reformers." Hence, he
refused to aid the Nationalists
unless they agreed to establish a
coalition government with the
Chinese Communists. The Rus
sians actively supported the revo
lutionary forces. The fail of China

was, therefore, inevitable. Con
tainment. though utilized in Eu
rope subsequent to the Axis de
mise, became Western orthodoxy
only with the ascendancy of Dean
Acheson.
Marxist conflict strategy, being
grounded in immanent reality en
tertains total war when the total
; ity of power conditions assure
victory. Then they will deliver the
I annihilating blow with every
weapon available. It is a denial of
reality to assume that the masters
of the Kremlin are rabulistic revo
lutionaries who would declare
war should the West no longer
abandon the "war zone"â€”"peace
zone" distinction, in which the
! West remains the cold war arena
j while the Communist bloc is
I closed to Western interven
tion. The Soviets would never
| risk everything at the price of
| negating a minor setback. They
| are far better arithmeticians.
Their conflict managers would
wait for the Western tide to re
cede and then strike at the ebb. In
the sustained brilliance of Mao-
Tse-Tung, "Enemy advances, we
j retreat; enemy halts, we harass;
j enemy tires, we attack; enemy re
| treats, we pursue."
Major wars have not been the
fruit of madmen. Prior to 15)14,
Great Britain and even France
and Russia met German aggrand
izement with conciliation and com
promise. German strategists as
sumed that past performance
assured British non-commitment
over the Belgian question. Hence
tin' German ministers remarked
to Gray: "You wouldn't
fight over a scrap of paper, would
you?" Later Britain and France
i acquiesced over the neutralization
of the Rhineland, German re
armament, the seizure of Austria
and the dismemberment of Czech
oslovakia. The Fuehrer, himself a
shrewd strategist, merely as
sumed that the empirical behavior
of the British Foreign Office ob
viated an Anglo-French declara
tion of war.
I Stalin spoke well when he said
I that it was not Germany which
' declared war on England and
France, but they who declared
! war on Germany. A wavering op
| ponent is more likely to trigger
I war than a master of real politics.
| The few times the West has at
| tempted a show of force have
j been unilaterally successful. The
| Iranian border dispute (Truman:
". . . Stalin was informed that I
had given orders to our military
chiefs to prepare for the move
ment of our ground, sea, and ait
forces. lie moved his troops
out."), Greece and Turkey, Guata
mala, the 1957 Syrian problem
and the 1958 Lebanon crisis. Ber
i lin. a crisis artificially created by
; Khrushchev to test Western re
i silience will remain ours, for as
I long as we persevere.
