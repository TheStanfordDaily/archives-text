I am certain that both Dr. Paul
ing and the two subcommittees
want peace. I imagine that the
Daily also wants peace. What Dr.
Pauling resents are the means by
which the subcommittees are at
tempting to repel a genuine
threat to free Western security.
If the Daily opposes the sub
committees, then let it acknowl
edge the existence of interna
tional communism and the dan
gers this system poses to the free
doms the Daily is upholding.
Let the Daily build up as well
as tear down. If the subcommit
tees are insufficient to meet a
vital challenge, then let the Daily
assume the responsibility of dis
covering and promoting a better
agency. The "great menace" is
ignorance and condescension, and
the menace is just as virulent in
the Daily's last editorial as in Dr.
Pauling's dispute with the Senate
Internal Security Committee.

The women of Stanford are fac
ing a new crisis brought upon
them by increasing tendency for

enterprising male undergraduates
to divert toward corruption. This
dastardly situation was railed to
our attention on Quad last Tues
day night when eager young
freshmen girls were becoming)
Stanford women (or so they
thought) by FRAUD!
On Thursday, Oct. 6, the Daily
printed a picture of a couple em
bracing in front of the moon,
church, band and water-balloon
ers. The girl, thinking that soph-1
omore Jim Culhane was a senior,
submitted to his charm <?); but

upon discovering the truth, re
marked later, "I feel as if I've
been swindled."
Perhaps a special women's com
mittee established to check I.D.'s
on Quad for those girls who re
ally care is the answer. It could
be done through the Women's
Council, although an essential re
quirement for this group would
have to be that it could only act
for the best interest of all con
cerned. In any event, it's some
thing to consider.

I am certain that both Dr. Paul
ing and the two subcommittees
want peace. I imagine that the
Daily also wants peace. What Dr.
Pauling resents are the means by
which the subcommittees are at
tempting to repel a genuine
threat to free Western security.
If the Daily opposes the sub
committees, then let it acknowl
edge the existence of interna
tional communism and the dan
gers this system poses to the free
doms the Daily is upholding.
Let the Daily build up as well
as tear down. If the subcommit
tees are insufficient to meet a
vital challenge, then let the Daily
assume the responsibility of dis
covering and promoting a better
agency. The "great menace" is
ignorance and condescension, and
the menace is just as virulent in
the Daily's last editorial as in Dr.
Pauling's dispute with the Senate
Internal Security Committee.
