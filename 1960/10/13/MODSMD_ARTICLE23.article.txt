"Who if; that kid?" Jack Curtice shouted as he stared at the soc
cer field in disbelief.
The Stanford head football conch was walking the increasingly
long distance from the practice field back to the dressing room
after an afternoon workout.
"Look at that boy move," marvelled Cactus. "Wow, he's quick.
Who is he?"
"An exchange student from Ghana," his listener said. "Name's
Emmanuel Andah."
"Ghana, eh? Hey, Dovvd," ho yelled with a laugh at halfback

Gil Dowd. who was trotting up
ahead of him. "Better watch out.
I've got me a halfback." He stood
and watched for a minute as the
object of his attention bounced a
soccer ball off his instep, arms,
shoulders and head with the grace
of a cat.
Gil Dowd will most likely start
at halfback against San Jose
State in the Stadium Saturday
and Emmanuel Andah will prob
ably play soccer against the Uni
versity of San Francisco on the
Stanford soccer field. But it isn't
Jack Curtice's fault.
"The football coaches have been
talking to me," Andah says.
"They say I could he one of the
best because of my speed. They
were out there throwing footballs
to me too. Hut I think I'm com
mitted to soccer for this year.
"I am only supposed to be here

for one year, but I would like to stay for another one if possible,
maybe the full four years. If I stayed next year I would definitely
play football."
Jordan Is Interested Too
Jack Curtice isn't the only Stanford coach with a glint in his
eye for Andah. Payton Jordan has shown predictable interest, for
Andah has run the 100 meter dash in 10.G. He ran this lime while
competing for the University College of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.
It's the Ethiopian record.
In the same meet he won four events and set University records
in three of them; the broad jump and high jump as well as the 100
meters.
"I was supposed to join the Ghana Olympic team in the 400 meter
relay," he said. "I was sent a letter and told to get myself into train
ing. My embassy in Addis Ababa found me a coach, E. F. Edwards
of London. Leroy Walker, an American, was coaching the Ethiopian
team. I was working out, but four weeks before the games started
I was told that Ghana was not going to present a relay team. They
couldn't find enough fellows
"It was the biggest disappointment of my life. I put up all my
energy for a good preparation."
We Lack Coaches'
One of the things that Andah is quite excited about is American
coaching.
"We lack coaches in Africa. The coaches here are very serious.
I'm one of the few Africans who have the opportunity to be coached
by the great American coaches so I want to go all out and achieve
the best.
Andah is high on all the soccer coaches and seems pretty happy
about the prospect of working under Jordan.
"I wrote to him while I was in Africa. He promised to give me
all the assistance possible. I have heard that he is one of the best
American track coaches. When I got here I went to his office and
he was very cooperative.
Turning to this Saturday—soccer, not football—Andah seems to
have caught the spirit of the thing.
"I don't think we've beaten USF in 15 years. We all really want
to win. I think we could win every game this year, but it will be
difficult."
It looks like football's loss is soccer's gain. To quote a famous
author, wait till next year . . . mavbe.
