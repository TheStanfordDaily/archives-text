# Tribe Readies Passing Attack For Invading San Jose State
## Daily Sports 
### 
Stanford's Indians liave only
been upset by San Jose State once
in the history of the series be
tween the two schools, which
dates back to 1900, and the Cards
would like to keep their record
against their junior rivals from
the southern tip of the Peninsula
that "/ay.
r ..ngry for victory after four
consecutive losses, and cast in the
unfamiliar role of favorite, the
Indians will try to get their
vaunted offense, which led the
nation in passing last year, into
gear.
THE PASSING attack has been
•sputtering of late. In every single
game played so far, Stanford's op
ponents have gained more yard
age through the air than Ihe
Indians.
Coach Jack Curtice had some
unpleasant words to say about
both parts of his passing attack
earlier this week. Referring to
the Washington game. Curtice
complained: "Our receivers ran
our pass patterns like a herd of
sheep." Nevertheless, he added,
"Norman could have passed to
short receivers cutting across
when his primary targets were
covered. It would have been like
stealing if he had."
Yesterday afternoon in practice
the Tribe concentrated on pass
patterns, but Curtice still was not
satisfied.
THE DEFENSIVE secondary,
already plagued by lack of speed,
suffered a jolt Tuesday afternoon
when fast-improving sophomore
Tim Hansel suffered a shoulder
separation. Hansel was operated
upon yesterday afternoon and will
have a steel pin in his shoulder
for the next six weeks, obviously
putting him out for the remainder
of the year, along with center
Doug Pursell.
This leaves the job of guarding
the speedy, dangerous Spartan
backs and ends up to John Bessey,
Mac Wylie, Skip Face, Gary
Craig and a somewhat inexperi
enced newcomer, Gary Sargent.
Despite these problems, the San
Jose game, traditionally the most
wide-open of the season, should
provide the chance for Stanford to
finally get untracked for a late
season rush.
FOR ONE thing, the Indians
are in better physical shape than
usual. Besides Pursell and Hansel,
only one Indian is likely to be
sidelined. Co-captain Dean Ilin
shaw's knee is much improved,
but he still has some trouble run
ning and Curtice does not intend
to play him. Guard Chuck More
house may see only limited action
because of a badly cut hand.
But for once, all of Norman's
receivers appear to be healthy.
Skip Face and Dale Ostrander,
the number one and number two
pass receivers in the Big Five,
will be starting, although Face
has not participated in contact
work this week. Mac Wylie, who
caught three long gainers last
week, is ready to go at full speed
from his flanker back spot.
The return of Face should vast
ly strengthen the Indian running

attack, for he and Gil Dowd, both
among the top four rushers in
the conference, provide a potent
one-two punch.
SOLIDLY anchoring the Indian
line, which hopes to stop the
Spartan running attack cold, are
guards Ron Fernandes and Don
Peter and linebacker John Butler
all of whom did excellent jobs last

' week, Sophomores C. B. Simons
and Phil Toorvald ably fill the
tackle positions.
The Indians need a big lift, a
win with lots of touchdowns
thrown in. to prepare them for
the upcoming battles with UCLA,
| USC, and Cal. That's exactly what
they'll looking for against
I San Jose.

unfamiliar role of favorite, the
Indians will try to get their
vaunted offense, which led the
nation in passing last year, into
gear.
THE PASSING attack has been
•sputtering of late. In every single
game played so far, Stanford's op
ponents have gained more yard
age through the air than Ihe
Indians.
Coach Jack Curtice had some
unpleasant words to say about
both parts of his passing attack
earlier this week. Referring to
the Washington game. Curtice
complained: "Our receivers ran
our pass patterns like a herd of
sheep." Nevertheless, he added,
"Norman could have passed to
short receivers cutting across
when his primary targets were
covered. It would have been like
stealing if he had."
Yesterday afternoon in practice
the Tribe concentrated on pass
patterns, but Curtice still was not
satisfied.
THE DEFENSIVE secondary,
already plagued by lack of speed,
suffered a jolt Tuesday afternoon
when fast-improving sophomore
Tim Hansel suffered a shoulder
separation. Hansel was operated
upon yesterday afternoon and will
have a steel pin in his shoulder
for the next six weeks, obviously
putting him out for the remainder
of the year, along with center
Doug Pursell.
This leaves the job of guarding
the speedy, dangerous Spartan
backs and ends up to John Bessey,
Mac Wylie, Skip Face, Gary
Craig and a somewhat inexperi
enced newcomer, Gary Sargent.
Despite these problems, the San
Jose game, traditionally the most
wide-open of the season, should
provide the chance for Stanford to
finally get untracked for a late
season rush.
FOR ONE thing, the Indians
are in better physical shape than
usual. Besides Pursell and Hansel,
only one Indian is likely to be
sidelined. Co-captain Dean Ilin
shaw's knee is much improved,
but he still has some trouble run
ning and Curtice does not intend
to play him. Guard Chuck More
house may see only limited action
because of a badly cut hand.
But for once, all of Norman's
receivers appear to be healthy.
Skip Face and Dale Ostrander,
the number one and number two
pass receivers in the Big Five,
will be starting, although Face
has not participated in contact
work this week. Mac Wylie, who
caught three long gainers last
week, is ready to go at full speed
from his flanker back spot.
The return of Face should vast
ly strengthen the Indian running

attack, for he and Gil Dowd, both
among the top four rushers in
the conference, provide a potent
one-two punch.
SOLIDLY anchoring the Indian
line, which hopes to stop the
Spartan running attack cold, are
guards Ron Fernandes and Don
Peter and linebacker John Butler
all of whom did excellent jobs last

' week, Sophomores C. B. Simons
and Phil Toorvald ably fill the
tackle positions.
The Indians need a big lift, a
win with lots of touchdowns
thrown in. to prepare them for
the upcoming battles with UCLA,
| USC, and Cal. That's exactly what
they'll looking for against
I San Jose.
Stanford's Indians liave only
been upset by San Jose State once
in the history of the series be
tween the two schools, which
dates back to 1900, and the Cards
would like to keep their record
against their junior rivals from
the southern tip of the Peninsula
that "/ay.
r ..ngry for victory after four
consecutive losses, and cast in the
unfamiliar role of favorite, the
Indians will try to get their
