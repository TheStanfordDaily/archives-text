# Very unusual
## 
### 
One of many unusual projects at the
Lawrence Radiation Laboratory â€” tlie only
national laboratory active in virtually all
pli ases of the atomic energy program.
ON OCTOBER 20
Lawrence Radiation Laboratory staff members
will be on campus to answer your questions
about a career in nuclear research.
They will interview outstanding:
electronic engineers
physicists
mathematicians
mcchanical engineers (MS, TMi 1))

Tnrv TIA is the first of a series of test reactors
l>eing developed under (he Lawrence Radiation
Laboratory's nuclear ramjet program.
A reactor for ramjet propulsion must operate
at high power levels yet he of minimum size
and mass. Its design must consider the very high
pressure drop across its length, the stress loads
due to flight maneuvering, and the extremely

high radiation flux level which itself leads to
severe heat transfer and radiation damage prob
lems. Because the operating temperature exceeds
that at which most conventional structural ma
terials fail, (he core itself consists of bundled
tubes of sintered uranium and beryllium oxide
fabricated with central holes for continuous air
passage.
