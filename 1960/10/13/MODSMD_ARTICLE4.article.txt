# 'News' Backs Nixon, Jack Pledges Security
## Defense of Matsu-Quemoy Unwise 
### 
NEW YORK (UPI) — Sen John
Kennedy pledged himself yester
day to take "whatever steps are
necessary" to defend U.S. security
and world freedom but said he
would not risk American lives in
a nuclear war by an "unwise com
mittment" to defend Quemoy and
Matsu as urged by Vice President
Richard M. Nixon.
Kennedy, in a speech prepared
for delivery at a $100-a-plate Dem
ocratic dinner, said this was his
"pledge" and added, "that is the
basic issue between Mr. Nixon
and myself concerning the islands
of Quemoy and Matsu."
THE DEMOCRATIC presiden
tial nominee charged earlier in
the day that Nixon is traveling
the "road to irresponsibility" in
advocating the defense of the
China off-shore islands.
The Massachusetts senator said
than any president "faces no
more solem decision than whether
to send American troops into bat
tle knowing they will not all re
turn."
AS A WORLD War II Naval
officer who was seriously wound
ed in the Pacific, Kennedy said
lie knows something of what it
means "to be responsible for the
lives of other men." He added:
"And if there is one pledge to
the American people which I
would make above all others it
would be this: should I become
your president, I will take what
ever steps are necessary to de
fend our security and to maintain
the cause of world freedom but
I will not risk American lives in
a nuclear war by permitting any
other nation to drag us into the
wrong war at the wrong place at
the wrong time through an un
wise commitment that is unsound
militarily, unnecessary to our se
curity and unsupported by our
allies."
K enne dy ' s formal speech
last night climaxed one of the
roughest campaign days he has
had since winning his party's
nomination.

would not risk American lives in
a nuclear war by an "unwise com
mittment" to defend Quemoy and
Matsu as urged by Vice President
Richard M. Nixon.
Kennedy, in a speech prepared
for delivery at a $100-a-plate Dem
ocratic dinner, said this was his
"pledge" and added, "that is the
basic issue between Mr. Nixon
and myself concerning the islands
of Quemoy and Matsu."
THE DEMOCRATIC presiden
tial nominee charged earlier in
the day that Nixon is traveling
the "road to irresponsibility" in
advocating the defense of the
China off-shore islands.
The Massachusetts senator said
than any president "faces no
more solem decision than whether
to send American troops into bat
tle knowing they will not all re
turn."
AS A WORLD War II Naval
officer who was seriously wound
ed in the Pacific, Kennedy said
lie knows something of what it
means "to be responsible for the
lives of other men." He added:
"And if there is one pledge to
the American people which I
would make above all others it
would be this: should I become
your president, I will take what
ever steps are necessary to de
fend our security and to maintain
the cause of world freedom but
I will not risk American lives in
a nuclear war by permitting any
other nation to drag us into the
wrong war at the wrong place at
the wrong time through an un
wise commitment that is unsound
militarily, unnecessary to our se
curity and unsupported by our
allies."
K enne dy ' s formal speech
last night climaxed one of the
roughest campaign days he has
had since winning his party's
nomination.
