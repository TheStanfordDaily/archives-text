NEW YORK (UPl)â€”The New
York Daily News announced yes
terday its endorsement of Vice
President Richard M. Nixon for :
the Presidency.
In an editorial prepared for its !
Thursday editions, the News ex
pressed "considerable respect" for
the Democratic team of Senators
John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. ;
Johnson.
"Both are handsome, intelligent
and patriotic, and if elected
would, we feel sure, strive to
serve what they considered to be i
the American people's best inter
ests.
"WE ARE convinced, though,
that Nixon and Lodge are better
qualified to serve the people dur
ing the four years beginning Jan.
20, 1961, and that their plans and
platform are preferable to those
of Kennedy and Johnson."
"SEN. KENNEDY'S govern
mental activities have been lim
ited to the legislative branch; and
his Senate attendance record has
been spotty," the editorial said.
The News praised Lodge as a
Senator, a war veteran and chief
of the American delegation to the
United Nations, where he estab
lished a "practice of immediately
nailing every Communist anti-
U.S. lie uttered in that forum."
BOTH NIXON and Lodge have
established anti-Communist rec
ords, the News said, while "Ken
nedy, on the other hand, has
shown alarming signs of softness
toward Communism at home and
abroad."
The News said that Kennedy's
economic program would foster a
"return to dollar-gutting inflation
and a quick heave-ho for the Ei- 1
senhower policy of fighting infla-!
tion tooth and nail."
"Nixon is for considerable wel- 1
fare-state stuff, too; but he puts
his main emphasis on keeping the
dollar stable and letting govern
ment do for people only what
people cannot adequately do for
themselves," the News said.
