# Midwest Lags In Electronics, Says Terman
## 
### 
Dr. Frederick E. Terman, vice-1
president and provost of t he Uni
versity, told the National Elec
tronics Conference in Chicago
yesterday that if the Midwest
continues to "plod along" in elec
tronics, it is destined to become
the "peon group" of the nation's
electronics industry.
"Electronics in the Midwest has
a long tradition and a successful
past," Terman said. "It can have,
a worthwhile future and partici
pate in the new things ahead, but j
only by developing with t lie times, j
"IF YOl' just plod along doing
hard, unexditing work and mak-1
ing a living, the P'ast Coast and
particularly the West Coast elec
tronics industries will have all of
the fun and most of the growth.
"Education is the key to prog
i ress in electronics," he pointed
lout. "The young man who wants
i to play an important part in it
needs at least a year of graduate
training, if not a Ph.D."
