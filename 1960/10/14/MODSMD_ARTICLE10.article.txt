# Village Grads Begin Mixing
## 
### 
All unmarried graduate women
have boon receiving invitations
in the mail. From the moil of Tor
man Hall in Stanford Village, the
invitations are part of an effort
on behalf of the graduate stu
dents to accelerate their social
program to the point that the rest
of the campus is aware of the
existence of the Village.
"An effort was made," stated
Terman President Phil Elllis, "to
â– see th;it every unattached gradu
ate woman received a personal
invitation, but due to late registra
tions and clerical difficulties, we
are certain some may have been
overlooked."
He extended the invitation to
all woman in this group who may
have been left off the mailing list.
First in a series of planned ac
tivities, the open house will take
place this Sunday afternoon from
2:30 to .3:30.
