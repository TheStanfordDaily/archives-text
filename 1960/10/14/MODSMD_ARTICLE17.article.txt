# A 						Foolish Remark
## 
### 
Amidst the diplomatic verbiage which has heen plentiful at
the present United Nations session, one comment by Ambassador
James Wadsworth has placed the United States in a very had and
foolish light.
Mr. Wadsworth, commenting on the close 42-31 vote defeating
discussion of Red China's admission, implied that the U.S. might
withdraw from the international body if this vote were to be re
versed in the future.
Although this is the first time such a threat has been made by
the U.S., it is certainly to be hoped that such a blunder will not
be committed again. The United States has supported the I
since its inception in 1945 and was, in fact, the leader in estab
lishing tlie organization. That the I I.N. has become a cornerstone
in U.S. foreign policy is proven by the position of the I .S. Ambas
sador to the U.N. on the Cabinet and the prestige with which the
Ambassadorship is endowed.
Fortunately, in the past I lie U.S. has had the voting strength
in the Ceneral Assembly to defeat proposals of the Communist
world and to pass its own resolutions. Efforts in the Security Coun
cil are stymied by the Russian veto.
With the new membership of many uncommitted countries, it
is possible that the balance of power may shift against the U.S.,
and Red China may be granted admission, although this does not
look probable in the near 112 uture. But if Red China is admitted, as
unhappy as we may he, we cannot afford to leave the U.N. Such
an action would turn against us many of the neutral countries who
look to the U.N. for leadership and would place the United States
in an untenable position of isolation.
It is difficult to believe that Mr. Wadsworth actually meant his
threat; however, bluffing on a subject of such importance smacks
of Mr. Khrushchev's tactici. The Russian leader has used every
means of blufl" and noise at his command. The United States should
not follow his lead in playing the spoiled brat hut should main
tain the dignity and solemnity of U.N. diplomacy.
