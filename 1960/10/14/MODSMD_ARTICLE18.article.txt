The eminent practicality of the.
Communist methodology, crystal-:
lized in Stalin's theory of ehb and
flow of history, reveals the vulner-1
ability inherent in the very struc-1
ture of the Iron Curtain. The ;
West must take its cue. The com
bat area must be shifted from the
West to the Soviet satellites. Hu-,
manitarian rhetoric must be re
focused on Soviet tyranny and
away from liberal Western colo- j
nial policy. The marginal coun- j
tries of the Western Bloc are no-1
toriously susceptible to Commu-1
nist propaganda and revolution
ary activities.
Similarly, the marginal areas
of the Communist bloc are sus
ceptible to Western agitation, e.g.,
Hungary, Poznam, Guatemala
and Poland.
Concerning the Hungarian
problem Senator John Kennedy
has said: "We did not warn that,
intervention in Hungary might
threaten world peace. . . .We did
not even try to make the Soviets
feel we might resist their inter-'
vention—to do as much for Hun- !
gary as Russia was then doing !
for Egypt by bluffing the West-!
ern powers away from recovering
the Suez Canal."
Immediate recognition of the
Nage government, compounded
with supplies, technicians and
volunteers (appropriately named ;
the Andrew Johnson Brigade)
would have prolonged, even won,
the war and widened an existing
fissure in the Iron Curtain.
Today, revisionist Cuba pre
sents an easier mark. A program:
a total economic blockage of
Cuba, combined 011 one hand with
a Florida'based "Voice of Free
dom" and its cry "The Revolu
tion Betrayed," and on the other
hand, air drops of supplies, tech
nicians and volunteers to anti
government forces in Cuba.
This woukl be augmented by
generous air drops of food and
other necessities on precisely
those areas already held by those
anti-government forces, while the
rest of the nation starves. If the
stomach supersedes the soul, as
modern commentators tell us,
then all Castro's eloquence will
be in vain. And the Cuban people
will be free.
Certain critics may charge that
this Cuban proposal will infuri
ate the Afro-Asian bloc and drive
them toward Communism. This
is false. Nehru, Nasser and Su
karno declare themselves Neu
tralists, not because they cannot
choose between the virtues of
Communism and Western democ
racy, but simply because they
realize there is little to fear from

the West, but from the Commu
nists. . . . Prior to the Fall of
China, Nehru was one of the most
vocal anti-Communists in Asia.
But with a predatory regime to
the North, appeasement became
the only reasonable alternative.
Nasser, who persecutes Egyptian
communists, recognized long ago
the value of playing both sides
of the street. It works. Sukarno's
problems are allied with Nehru's.
African leaders, to the extent of
their intelligence, will benefit
from these illustrious people.
What they really want, in the
words of General Douglas Mac-
Arthur, is a "little more food in
their stomachs, a little more
clothing on their backs, a little
firmer roof over their heads, and
the normal nationalist urge for
independence." Catering to Neu
tralist rhetoric is international ex
tortion. Three years after Hun
gary, Nehru crowned Khrushchev
"a friend of peace."
The Soviets desire an "easing
of tensions," not to obviate a
breakdown of the "balance of ter
ror," but rather to encourage a
relaxation of Western vigilance.
To barter for a termination of
protracted warfare before the
Marxist has repudiated its prac
ticality as a conflict doctrine is
to challenge the lesson of history.
Economic competition, instead
of protracted conflict, only flat
ters the capitalist ego. Shortly
after the Geneva communique
was signed, Egypt receievd a
large shipment of Czech arms.
"Had the West responded vigor
ously," writes Robert Kintner of
the Foreign Policy Institute, "the
Soviets might have disavowed
their satellite or met a sharp
Western riposte—such as the cap
ture of Czech arms — with a
verbal protest."
When a proposed conference
contradicts Soviet aspirations it
is frustrated. Witness the U-2 in
cident. If the Russians had shot
down 100 U-2's and the Paris
meeting corresponded with their
interests, they would have will
ingly negotiated. On the other
hand, if Eisenhower had sup
pressed our spy flights in antici
pation of a Summit meeting, he
would have jeopardized National
Security for a fantasy.
The moral: The West, like its
enemy, should consider Summit
ry, not as a prayer for peace, but
as an instrument of warfare.
Summitry and trust are the fables
of those who do not understand
reality.
< 'ommunist sii c cess breeds
more success. If confirms for
them the Marxist interpretation
of the sweep of victory. They be
come more d a r in g, and conse
quently more victorious, and we
less. The important thing is to
reverse this trend, carry the
battle to them, and remove their
psychological base of support.

nists. . . . Prior to the Fall of
China, Nehru was one of the most
vocal anti-Communists in Asia.
But with a predatory regime to
the North, appeasement became
the only reasonable alternative.
Nasser, who persecutes Egyptian
communists, recognized long ago
the value of playing both sides
of the street. It works. Sukarno's
problems are allied with Nehru's.
African leaders, to the extent of
their intelligence, will benefit

What they really want, in the
words of General Douglas Mac-
Arthur, is a "little more food in
their stomachs, a little more
clothing on their backs, a little
firmer roof over their heads, and
the normal nationalist urge for
independence." Catering to Neu
tralist rhetoric is international ex
tortion. Three years after Hun
gary, Nehru crowned Khrushchev
"a friend of peace."
The Soviets desire an "easing
of tensions," not to obviate a
breakdown of the "balance of ter
ror," but rather to encourage a
relaxation of Western vigilance.
To barter for a termination of
protracted warfare before the
Marxist has repudiated its prac
ticality as a conflict doctrine is
to challenge the lesson of history.
Economic competition, instead
of protracted conflict, only flat
ters the capitalist ego. Shortly
after the Geneva communique
was signed, Egypt receievd a
large shipment of Czech arms.
"Had the West responded vigor
ously," writes Robert Kintner of
the Foreign Policy Institute, "the
Soviets might have disavowed
their satellite or met a sharp
Western riposte—such as the cap
ture of Czech arms — with a
verbal protest."
When a proposed conference
contradicts Soviet aspirations it
is frustrated. Witness the U-2 in
cident. If the Russians had shot
down 100 U-2's and the Paris
meeting corresponded with their
interests, they would have will
ingly negotiated. On the other
hand, if Eisenhower had sup
pressed our spy flights in antici
pation of a Summit meeting, he
would have jeopardized National
Security for a fantasy.
The moral: The West, like its
enemy, should consider Summit
ry, not as a prayer for peace, but
as an instrument of warfare.
Summitry and trust are the fables
of those who do not understand
reality.

ture of the Iron Curtain. The ;
West must take its cue. The com
bat area must be shifted from the
West to the Soviet satellites. Hu-,
manitarian rhetoric must be re
focused on Soviet tyranny and
away from liberal Western colo- j
nial policy. The marginal coun- j
tries of the Western Bloc are no-1
toriously susceptible to Commu-1
nist propaganda and revolution
ary activities.
Similarly, the marginal areas
of the Communist bloc are sus
ceptible to Western agitation, e.g.,
Hungary, Poznam, Guatemala
and Poland.
Concerning the Hungarian
problem Senator John Kennedy
has said: "We did not warn that,
intervention in Hungary might
threaten world peace. . . .We did
not even try to make the Soviets
feel we might resist their inter-'
vention—to do as much for Hun- !
gary as Russia was then doing !
for Egypt by bluffing the West-!
ern powers away from recovering
the Suez Canal."
Immediate recognition of the
Nage government, compounded
with supplies, technicians and
volunteers (appropriately named ;
the Andrew Johnson Brigade)
would have prolonged, even won,
the war and widened an existing
fissure in the Iron Curtain.
Today, revisionist Cuba pre
sents an easier mark. A program:
a total economic blockage of
Cuba, combined 011 one hand with
a Florida'based "Voice of Free
dom" and its cry "The Revolu
tion Betrayed," and on the other
hand, air drops of supplies, tech
nicians and volunteers to anti
government forces in Cuba.
This woukl be augmented by
generous air drops of food and
other necessities on precisely
those areas already held by those
anti-government forces, while the
rest of the nation starves. If the
stomach supersedes the soul, as
modern commentators tell us,
then all Castro's eloquence will
be in vain. And the Cuban people
will be free.
Certain critics may charge that
this Cuban proposal will infuri
ate the Afro-Asian bloc and drive
them toward Communism. This
is false. Nehru, Nasser and Su
karno declare themselves Neu
tralists, not because they cannot
choose between the virtues of
Communism and Western democ
racy, but simply because they
realize there is little to fear from

the West, but from the Commu
nists. . . . Prior to the Fall of
China, Nehru was one of the most
vocal anti-Communists in Asia.
But with a predatory regime to
the North, appeasement became
the only reasonable alternative.
Nasser, who persecutes Egyptian
communists, recognized long ago
the value of playing both sides
of the street. It works. Sukarno's
problems are allied with Nehru's.
African leaders, to the extent of
their intelligence, will benefit
from these illustrious people.
What they really want, in the
words of General Douglas Mac-
Arthur, is a "little more food in
their stomachs, a little more
clothing on their backs, a little
firmer roof over their heads, and
the normal nationalist urge for
independence." Catering to Neu
tralist rhetoric is international ex
tortion. Three years after Hun
gary, Nehru crowned Khrushchev
"a friend of peace."
The Soviets desire an "easing
of tensions," not to obviate a
breakdown of the "balance of ter
ror," but rather to encourage a
relaxation of Western vigilance.
To barter for a termination of
protracted warfare before the
Marxist has repudiated its prac
ticality as a conflict doctrine is
to challenge the lesson of history.
Economic competition, instead
of protracted conflict, only flat
ters the capitalist ego. Shortly
after the Geneva communique
was signed, Egypt receievd a
large shipment of Czech arms.
"Had the West responded vigor
ously," writes Robert Kintner of
the Foreign Policy Institute, "the
Soviets might have disavowed
their satellite or met a sharp
Western riposte—such as the cap
ture of Czech arms — with a
verbal protest."
When a proposed conference
contradicts Soviet aspirations it
is frustrated. Witness the U-2 in
cident. If the Russians had shot
down 100 U-2's and the Paris
meeting corresponded with their
interests, they would have will
ingly negotiated. On the other
hand, if Eisenhower had sup
pressed our spy flights in antici
pation of a Summit meeting, he
would have jeopardized National
Security for a fantasy.
The moral: The West, like its
enemy, should consider Summit
ry, not as a prayer for peace, but
as an instrument of warfare.
Summitry and trust are the fables
of those who do not understand
reality.
< 'ommunist sii c cess breeds
more success. If confirms for
them the Marxist interpretation
of the sweep of victory. They be
come more d a r in g, and conse
quently more victorious, and we
less. The important thing is to
reverse this trend, carry the
battle to them, and remove their
psychological base of support.
