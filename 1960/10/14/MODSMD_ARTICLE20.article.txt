Every human being who strives j
toward a mature understanding j
of world affairs should be dis-!
turbed with that brand of irre
sponsible irrationality offered by |
Michael Jackson in his letter on
Cuba. Mr. Jackson maintains that
the Cuban Revolution "is not so
much a subject to be informed
about as to be informed against,"
Logic of this variety benefifs
no one and most certainly points
the path to destruction. An. at
tempt to deal with the Cuban sit
uation without understanding: 1.
what that situation is; 2. why it ;
is that way; and 3. the sentiments
of the Cuban people themselves
would be ludicrous indeed. We
who have formed a committee to
study the Cuban Revolution hope
to provide materials through
which Stanford students can de
velop informed opinions of the!
events in Cuba; opinions consist-!
ent with political realities.
Any person sincerely concerned
with the welfare of the United
States must not blind himself to
its shortcomings, nor to the.
weaknesses of its foreign policy, j
Many of us feel that United States I
policy toward Cuba has been |
tragically short-sighted, that it
has been enacted in the interests ;
of a small portion of the Ameri
can population, and that it does
not take account of Latin Amer
ica's pressing needs. If the United
States is to strengthen its posi
tion in the world today, its for
eign policy must be geared to
wards the ci'itical problems faced
by underdeveloped nations, and
not simply towards involving
them in an anti-Communist alli
ance or securing U.S. investments
abroad.
The Fair Play for Cuba Com
mittee proposes to investigate
various aspects of U.S. policy to
ward Cuba, to discuss its strength
and weaknesses, and to analyze
the consequences of alternative
programs. By sponsoring speak
ers of divergent opinions and
making available literature repre
senting various viewpoints we
hope to create an atmosphere in
which thoughtful conclusions can
be reached. Only in such an intel
lectual climate can we make re
sponsible decisions on the grave
issues facing us today.

A very important and funda
mental issue arises from your

recent political endorsement. Un
fortunately, this seems to have
been overlooked by both your
selves and your critics.
Essentially the problem re
volves about the perennial con
flict betweep the rights and re
sponsibilities of individuals as
opposed to those of groups. We
might all benefit from asking our
selves the following:
1. Does the editor of a news
paper "owned and published . . .
by the Associated Students of
Stanford University" have the
moral right to use this organ for
the promotion of personal prefer
ences?
2. Does he- or must he—speak
for a democratically-determined
majority of the "associated" stu
dents?
3. Are there some issues upon

i which a student editor is expected
Ito speak some on which he may
j not? Is a student newspaper truly
' a "free" press?
j 4. Does the editor of a student
; newspaper, by the exertion of
j individual rights, infringe upon
! the rights of dissenting group
I members; whQ,s,e membership
' (ASSU) is not ;lf>y chbice?
! 5. Indeed, does LASSU have
i any responsibility in this matter?

1 not prohibit constant introspec

Every human being who strives j
toward a mature understanding j
of world affairs should be dis-!
turbed with that brand of irre
sponsible irrationality offered by |
Michael Jackson in his letter on
Cuba. Mr. Jackson maintains that
the Cuban Revolution "is not so
much a subject to be informed
about as to be informed against,"
Logic of this variety benefifs
no one and most certainly points
the path to destruction. An. at
tempt to deal with the Cuban sit
uation without understanding: 1.
what that situation is; 2. why it ;
is that way; and 3. the sentiments
of the Cuban people themselves
would be ludicrous indeed. We
who have formed a committee to
study the Cuban Revolution hope
to provide materials through
which Stanford students can de
velop informed opinions of the!
events in Cuba; opinions consist-!
ent with political realities.
Any person sincerely concerned
with the welfare of the United
States must not blind himself to
its shortcomings, nor to the.
weaknesses of its foreign policy, j
Many of us feel that United States I
policy toward Cuba has been |
tragically short-sighted, that it
has been enacted in the interests ;
of a small portion of the Ameri
can population, and that it does
not take account of Latin Amer
ica's pressing needs. If the United
States is to strengthen its posi
tion in the world today, its for
eign policy must be geared to
wards the ci'itical problems faced
by underdeveloped nations, and
not simply towards involving
them in an anti-Communist alli
ance or securing U.S. investments
abroad.
The Fair Play for Cuba Com
mittee proposes to investigate
various aspects of U.S. policy to
ward Cuba, to discuss its strength
and weaknesses, and to analyze
the consequences of alternative
programs. By sponsoring speak
ers of divergent opinions and
making available literature repre
senting various viewpoints we
hope to create an atmosphere in
which thoughtful conclusions can
be reached. Only in such an intel
lectual climate can we make re
sponsible decisions on the grave
issues facing us today.

Editor, the Daily:
A very important and funda
mental issue arises from your

recent political endorsement. Un
fortunately, this seems to have
been overlooked by both your
selves and your critics.
Essentially the problem re
volves about the perennial con
flict betweep the rights and re
sponsibilities of individuals as
opposed to those of groups. We
might all benefit from asking our
selves the following:
1. Does the editor of a news
paper "owned and published . . .
by the Associated Students of
Stanford University" have the
moral right to use this organ for
the promotion of personal prefer
ences?
2. Does he- or must he—speak
for a democratically-determined
majority of the "associated" stu
dents?
3. Are there some issues upon

i which a student editor is expected
Ito speak some on which he may
j not? Is a student newspaper truly
' a "free" press?
j 4. Does the editor of a student
; newspaper, by the exertion of
j individual rights, infringe upon
! the rights of dissenting group
I members; whQ,s,e membership
