It is too early to be sure, but
there are signs that the first wave
of Mr. K.'s diplomatic offensive
has passed its crest. There is no
doubt that there will be a second
wave but it may be that it will not
come immediately, and that there
will be an interval of compara
tive quiet in which to assess the
situation.
If this proves to be correct, we
can say that while Mr. K. has
failed to conquer or to wreck the
U.N., he has staged a powerful
a n d significant demonstration
against the status quo. His cam
paign is not over. Indeed it is
just launched. And there is no
time to be wasted in preparing
our minds and our policies for
the long conflict of which we
have seen only the beginning.
Last Monday, in the most re
vealing of all his speeches at the
U.N., Mr. K. made clear what is
behind the uproar he has been
creating. It i-s that, "the structure
of some United Nations bodies,"
which was "normal," fifteen
years ago, "is now out of date."
In 1945, when the U.N. was
founded, the assumption was that
the IJ.N. would be led by Ihe five
victorious big powers in World
War 11, that is to say by the So
viet Union. Kuomintang China,
Great Britain, France, and the
United States. Since 1945 the So
viet Union has become a very
great power, Kuomintang China
has collapsed on the Chinese
mainland, and a billion people,
formerly under colonial rule, have
become independent.
The U.X., he asserts, reflects
the power structure of the world
in 1945 and not the power struc
ture of the world today. His griev
ance is that in the Security Coun
cil and in the Secretariat, the new
powers that have risen since 1945
are not fairly represented. His
objective is to reform the U.N. —
or more specifically to reform the
Security Council and the Secre
tariat —in order that they may
reflect the facts which are, he
asserts, that "not only law and
justice but force too is on the
side of" the Communist orbit and
the neutrals. The United States
and its Western allies are, lie as
serts, still preponderant in the

I'.V I*ul they aiv no longer pre
ponderant in (lie world.
Once again, as in nis torrent
of insults after the U-2, Mr. K.
has overplayed his hand and has
played it badly. For he has di
rected the brunt of his assault
not at the undoubted weaknesses
of the U.N. structure hut at its
strongest and most progressive
and most inspiring success. This
is the emergence of the office of
Secretary General under Mr.
Hammarskjold's brilliant direc
tion as an indispensible protector
of the peace among small nations.
Mr. K.'s mistake has been to
attack the U.N. where it is least
vulnerable, and because of that
his support in the Assembly is
small. He has in fact been re
pulsed, and apparently he knows
it. For he is not pressing his de
mands about the Secretary Gen
eral.
But, if we care about the future,
let lis not think that Mr. K.'s
mistake lias been our success.
Let us not sink into torpor and
complacency until Mr. k.
launches, as he surely will, the
next wave of his campaign. The
uproar in the General Assembly
which evoked more sympathy
among the delegates than they
found it useful or expedient to
acknowledge, should be treated
as an alarm bell. It should warn
us that the old American hege
mony, of which Mr. Lodge loves
to boast, is about over.
The time is now at hand when
a statesmanlike reform of the
U.N. will be imperative.
