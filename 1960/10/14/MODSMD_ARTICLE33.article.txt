# Stanford. Spartan Elevens Clash Tomorrow
## Daily Sports 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
BLUE SKIES and lots of fireworks should be on the menu of
tomorrow's three-ring circus put on by Stanford and San Jose State.
Featured will be the Boy Scouts and the passing arms of Dick Nor
man and Mike Jones, the leading quarterbacks of the Indians and
Spartans respectively. To the victor will go "the championship of

Santa Clara County.
Stanford's Indians are the de
fending "champions," although
they have looked like anything
but champions this season. But
against the Spartans, the Tribe
should finally have an oppor
tunity to break loose. It is now or
never, for if the Cards lose this
one, they will have reached the
lowest of depths.
Never in the last five years
has Stanford been held to less
than five touchdowns by Ihe Spar
tans. But the Indians have also
had a great deal of difficulty con
taining the speedy Spartans, who
last fall crossed the Card goal
line six times.
FANS WIIO come to the game
expecting a pushover may be sur
prsied, for anything can happen
in a contest of this type. San Jose
Coach Bob Titchenal has prom
ised that his team will not "fold"
under pressure. Titchenal has re
marked that his squad is up for
1 his "big game," and they are
"mad" about the trouncing they
sustained from Oregon. However,
the Indians, who have been im
proving but never quite jelled
must definitely be rated the fa
vorites.
Once again both teams have
top-flight passing attacks. San

J Jose currently ranks fifth among
the nation's top passing teams,
with an average of 172 yards per
i game. Miko Jones is the quarter
j back who makes the offense
, move, throwing for a completion
percentage of 57.9. Chon Gallegos
and Dave Bonillas back him up.
But the primary danger for the
Indians lies in the great speed of
the Spartan receivers. The al
ready porous Stanford secondary
has been hurt by the loss of Tim
Hansel and the defenders may
have a great deal of trouble cop
ing wiih Mack Burton and. Willie
Williams, among others.
BURTON ANI) Williams, both
halfbacks, have times for the 100-
yard dash of 9.6 and 9.5 seconds
respectively. If they get loose,
ami they are the two leading San
Jose pass receivers, ihe slow
Stanford backs will probably
never catch them. Adding to the
problem, both tote the pigskin on
running plays, and Williams'
average is 10.7 yards per carry

while Burton is not far behind
with 6.9 a try.
Ends Oscar Donahue and Jim
Cadile, and halfback Doug Mc-
Chesney are also favorite targets
and could provide quite a head

ache for Coach Jack Curtice's
crew.
Stanford, however, is not with
out a passing attack of its own.
Dick Norman, after all, is no
slough at throwing and despite

tho highly publicized loss of all
of his ends, some of the Indians
have managed to hang onto his
j spirals.
PASS DKFKXSK has not been
a San Jw-se forte, and it is hoped
that Norman will be able to con
nect often and for big chunks of
yardage. Short flips to Skip Face,
' long passes to Dale Ostrander,
and strikes thrown at Mac VVylie
over the middle have all proved
successful plays for the Indians.
John Bessey and Jerry Winters
have also been on the payoff end
of several Norman pitches. Al
though the aerial attack has not
! been nearly as successful as it
could or should be, it should give
Spartan Coach Bob Titchenal
plenty of fits.
On the ground, the Indians rate
a definite edge. Skip Face and
Gil Dowd have been the work
horses and have been consistent
gainers, if not breakaway threats.
Hal Steuber and Archie Schmitt
add to the threat.
The Spartan ground game ha-s
been somewhat spotty, in fact
last week it was stopped more
Ihan cold, showing a net loss of
29 yards for the afternoon. Much

of this, however, may ho ac
counted for by the fact that Ore
gon smeared San Jose quarter
hacks 11 times for total losses of
86 yards. Also, t he game was
played on a wet field, neutraliz
ing the Spartans speed, and this
will not be the case tomorrow.
TIM: BRKAD-AXD-butter man
has been sophomore fullback
Johnny Johnson, who has netted
99 yards in two games. Fred
Blanco and McChesney, Burton
and Williams are all quite danger
ous. Once any of these men is able
to turn the corner or break away,
they could spell trouble.
End runs and pitchouts may be
the most successful running plays
on both sides. San Jose boasts a
tough interior line built at;ound

238-pound tackle John Sutro, con
tor Hank Chamness, and Dick
I Erler, captain and right guard
These boys kept Oregon Iron
gaining at the center of the line
but the Ducks killed them on the
quarterback pass-and-run option
! Unfortunately, iho Indians have
been unable to execute this pla>
very successfully.
IN tin: LINE for the Indians
guards Don Peter and Hon For
nandes have,won starting posi
lions through excellent play
Chris Cottle is at center, whik
Phil Toorvald replaces Jack Gor
don at left tackle. C. B. Simons
continues to massively fill in foi
the still-sidelined Dean Hinshaw
Rich Hearney remains in the
starting spot at right end.
