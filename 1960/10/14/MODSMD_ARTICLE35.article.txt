# Soccer Team to Test Strength Against USF
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
STANFORD FACES the big
gest test of the young 1960 soc
cer season tomorrow when pow
erful USF invades the Farm.
USF almost always wins the
West Coast Soccer League cham
pionship and Stanford Soccer
Coach Fred Priddle figures that
this is the year for Stanford to
halt the Dons' domination of West
Coast soccer.
USF comes to Stanford after
a hard-earned victory over tough
California. The win came in an
overtime period, on a disputed
penalty kick which Cal claimed
should not have been allowed.
Stanford trounced San Jose State
5-1 in its first league encounter.
USF'S STRENGTH is its pow
erful front line featuring high
scoring Yves Jean-Joseph and
tricky Fred Savage. It was these
two who almost single-handedly
ruined Stanford in last year's 4-1
loss. The game wasn't decided un
til Savage went wild in the fourth
quarter.
If USF has a weakness, it is
in the quality of its goal-tending.

During all the years USF has
been a national power in soccer,
it has rarely had an especially
! good goalie. The rugged Don
backfield led by All - American
fullback George Tubman will try
to cover up for this weakness.
Stanford will start the game
with the same lineup that de
| feated San Jose State. Beau Bian
chi starts at goalie. Bianchi has
not yet been tested, due to the
fact that Stanford's top-flight
backfield keeps its opponents
away from the Stanford goal.
STANFORD'S CHANCES of
success rely to a great extent on
Bianchi's performance in his first
real test of the season.
The rest of the Stanford back
field Will be composed of Dan
1 Farthing and Dick Voake, full
backs, and Bernie Knaggs, Jan
Achenbach and Rusty Williams,
halfbacks. These five will have to
duplicate or improve on their per
formances against San Jose.
Stanford's front line is com
posed of Adam Bianchi, Dick
Bartlett, Emmanuel Andah, Rune
1 Engebrettsen and Mike Tippett.

Coast soccer.
USF comes to Stanford after
a hard-earned victory over tough
California. The win came in an
overtime period, on a disputed
penalty kick which Cal claimed
should not have been allowed.
Stanford trounced San Jose State
5-1 in its first league encounter.
USF'S STRENGTH is its pow
erful front line featuring high
scoring Yves Jean-Joseph and
tricky Fred Savage. It was these
two who almost single-handedly
ruined Stanford in last year's 4-1
loss. The game wasn't decided un
til Savage went wild in the fourth
quarter.
If USF has a weakness, it is
in the quality of its goal-tending.

During all the years USF has
been a national power in soccer,
it has rarely had an especially
! good goalie. The rugged Don
backfield led by All - American
fullback George Tubman will try
to cover up for this weakness.
Stanford will start the game
with the same lineup that de
| feated San Jose State. Beau Bian
chi starts at goalie. Bianchi has
not yet been tested, due to the
fact that Stanford's top-flight
backfield keeps its opponents
away from the Stanford goal.
STANFORD'S CHANCES of
success rely to a great extent on
Bianchi's performance in his first
real test of the season.
The rest of the Stanford back
field Will be composed of Dan
1 Farthing and Dick Voake, full
backs, and Bernie Knaggs, Jan
Achenbach and Rusty Williams,
halfbacks. These five will have to
duplicate or improve on their per
formances against San Jose.
Stanford's front line is com
posed of Adam Bianchi, Dick
Bartlett, Emmanuel Andah, Rune
1 Engebrettsen and Mike Tippett.
STANFORD FACES the big
gest test of the young 1960 soc
cer season tomorrow when pow
erful USF invades the Farm.
USF almost always wins the
West Coast Soccer League cham
pionship and Stanford Soccer
Coach Fred Priddle figures that
this is the year for Stanford to
halt the Dons' domination of West
Coast soccer.
