# Bill Mazeroski Blasts Crucial Ninth Inning Home Run As Pittsburgh Pirates Edge Yankees, 10-9, Win Series
## 
### OSCAR FRALEY 
PITTSBURGH, Oct. 13 (UPD —
Second baseman Bill Ma/.eroski
proved his defiance of the mighty
New York Yankees today when
he blasted a ninth-inning solo
home run that gave the Pitts
burgh Pirates a 10-9 victory and
ended their 33-year search for
World Series glory.
All tied up at 9-9 going into
the bottom of the ninth, Mazer
oski lived up to his never-say-die
defiance of the mighty Yankees
to snatch victory away from the
very team which had beaten the
Pirates the last time they were in
the Series way back in 1927.
IT WAS A wild and delirious
finish for an ecstatic crowd of
36,683 partisan Pittsburgh fans
who almost tore down ancient
Forbes Field as Mazeroski's lead
off shot in the ninth inning
against pitcher Ralph Terry car
ried the battling Bues to their
first world championship since
1925.
And it was a wild and wooly
finish, a head to head battle in
which the Yankees spotted the
Pirates a four-run lead, battled
back to a seemingly-victorious 7-4
margin and then gave up five
runs in the eighth to trail 9-7,
and came back in the top of the
ninth to make it all square.
BUT WHEN it was all over it
was Mazeroski's never-say-die
shot in the bottom of the ninth
which ended it on a riotous note
the Yankees taking away all
the records and the battling Bues
settling for the gold and the
glory.
It was a day of power display
in the warm sunshine and late
fall haze with Rocky Nelson swat
ting a first inning homer for the
Bues; Bill Skowron blasting one
for the Yanks in the fifth with
nobody aboard; Yoki Berra hit
tingj a "body English" blast in
the sixth with two on to shoot
the Yankees out in front, and
Pirate Hal Smith socking one in
the eighth with two on base to
jump the Pirates out in front.
MAZEROSKI'S came later
after the Yankees had tied it up
in the top of the ninth—arching
over the wall to give little Harvey
Haddix his second triumph in
this World Series.
When it was all over—with the
Yankees using five pitchers and
the Pirates sending four to the
mound the Yankees had the du
bious solace of having bombed
two new records into the books
with a total of 55 runs and 91
hits. But when it came down to
the final analysis the biggest hit
of them all was that homer by

Mazeroski who had hit one in
I he opening game and then saved
his second until the final second
of this sudden death seventh
•game.
THERE WERE two out when
Bob Skinner drew a walk. Then
it was Nelson and the crowd
erupted as he poled his two-run
blast through the haze and into
the lower right field stands. It
was the first Pirate homer since
the opening game and brought
them back solidly from that 12-0
shutout drubbing in the sixth
game.
The battling Bues lost a chance
to crack it wide open in the sec
ond when they filled the bases

with none out, although they did
add two runs and sent Turley
scurrying from the premises.
Vernon Law had given up only '•
a pair of two-out singles going
into the fifth. That's when Skow
ron led off with his solo home
run into 1 lie lower right field j
stands, the ninth Yankee circuit i
blow of the Series, to cut the
Pirate edge to 4 to 1.
THE YANKS bounced back
with four runs in the sixth and
finally blasted the myth of little
Elroy Face, the bantam relief star
who three times had shut them
off to save victories for the Bues.
Richardson started it off with ;
a single to center off Law and

took second as Kubek drew <i
walk. That was all for Law, but ,
ho received a standing ovation
from the crowd as Face stalked
in slowly from iho bull pen. Little
Elroy got the first man, Maris •
popping foul to Hoak and the!
runners holding.
But then Mickey Mantle singled
over second, Groat missing a div- J
ing attempt to snare the ball, to
score Richardson and send Kubek '
rolling into third.
THAT'S WHEN Berra stepped,
in and maced the ball high into
the upper right field stands.
The Yankees thought they had
Face in their pocket now and
they got to him for two more

big runs in the eighth. Once again
Bei'ra figured prominently as,
with two away, he drew a walk.
Skowron followed with an in
field hit into the hole at short.
Blanchard came through with
a single to right, scoring Berra
and boosting Skowron on to third,
and Cletis Boyer doubled down
the left field line, scoring Skow
ron and sending Blanchard to
third. Face finally got out of it
then, but it looked as if the Yan
kees had sewed it up.
But they counted without those
battling Hues and the diamond
fates.
THE PIRATES got out of it
and now it was Mazeroski step
ping in.
On Terry's second pitch to him
he swung and made all the Pirate
dreams come true as he sent the
ball soaring over the wall to wind
it up happily for a team which
three times had been battered
almost out of shape.
