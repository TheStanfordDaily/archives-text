# Frosh Gridders Play San Jose
## 
### 
Stanford's spectacular Frosh
eleven opens their 1960 pigskin
season tomorrow at 10:30 on the
Memorial Field against a rugged
San Jose State squad.
According to Coach Dan Stav
ely, the Indians will run a com
bination VVing-T and Multiple-T
ground and aerial attack. Quar
terback Jim Norman, no relation
to Dick, lias a strong arm and
will learl the aerial attack. Coach
Stavely plans to change his first
and second squads every five min
utes. Most scouts feel that this is
the strongest and deepest squad
that any Frosh team has had in
recent times.
Ends Bob Burke and Louis
Adams will be the probable start
ers. attempting to snag Norman's
passes. In the fullback slot, Tyce
Fitzmorris, one of the fastest
backs on the team, will get the
starting nod.
Today the squad plans to take
it easy, with only a chalk talk
and some light calisthenics. The
team picture will also be taken
tomorrow, and the first four units
will go over plays in preparation
for Saturday's contest.
