# TODAY IN THE VARSITY POOL
## Poloists Entertain San Jose, Look for Season's First Win 
### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford's w a t e r polo squad
will be looking for its first win
of the yet young season when
the Cards entertain the San Jose
State Spartans in the varsity pool
at 3:30 today.

Saturday morning the Indians
will try again as they take on
the strong San Francisco Olym
pic Club here at 10:00.
San Jose, which generally man
ages to come up with a top team,
is a strong, fast squad featuring

Lon Christiansen, a former Pan
American Games water poloist.
Coach Art Lambert's Spartans
lost to California, 1-1-7, Wednes
day, and Card mentor Jim Gaugh
ran sees some hope for his
charges if they can come up with
a top effort.
The Olympic Club, featuring
top ex-collegians from the Bay
Area, have won two National
AAU championships in the last
four years, but don't figure to
be quite so strong this campaign.
Leading the Winged "O" is Zol
tar Hospitar, former Rumanian
Olympics water polo star, who
came to the U.S. after the 1956
Olympics with a group of defect
ing Hungarians and Rumanians.
Supporting Hospital are Bob
Gaughran, former COP flash and
brother of Stanford Coach Jim,
and Boyd Mickley, both of whom
dent their opponents' goals with
regularity.
Starting for the Indians will lie
the same unit that went against
California last week: Roger John
son, Rich Rosenberger, Bob Lor
ton, John Lorton, Bob Spence
high scorer in the Cards' last out
ing with 4 goals- Mike Conn, and
goalie John Bates.
The frosh water poloists are
also slated to see plenty of action
this weekend as they take on the
San Jose State freshmen here
Friday following the varsity en
counter at about 4:30 and engage
in a return bout with Menlo-Ath
erton High School Satu rd a y
morning at 11:00.
Led by Bill Lorton, who has
scored eight goals in two outings,
the Papooses should be able to
handle the Spartababes Friday.
The outcome Saturday is more
doubtful as Menlo-Atherton de
feated Stanford earlier this week,
8-7, but the frosh will be itching
for revenge and will be tough to
beat.

the same unit that went against
California last week: Roger John
son, Rich Rosenberger, Bob Lor
ton, John Lorton, Bob Spence
high scorer in the Cards' last out
ing with 4 goals- Mike Conn, and
goalie John Bates.
The frosh water poloists are
also slated to see plenty of action
this weekend as they take on the
San Jose State freshmen here
Friday following the varsity en
counter at about 4:30 and engage
in a return bout with Menlo-Ath
erton High School Satu rd a y
morning at 11:00.
Led by Bill Lorton, who has
scored eight goals in two outings,
the Papooses should be able to
handle the Spartababes Friday.
The outcome Saturday is more
doubtful as Menlo-Atherton de
feated Stanford earlier this week,
8-7, but the frosh will be itching
for revenge and will be tough to
beat.
Stanford's w a t e r polo squad
will be looking for its first win
of the yet young season when
the Cards entertain the San Jose
State Spartans in the varsity pool
at 3:30 today.

Saturday morning the Indians
will try again as they take on
the strong San Francisco Olym
pic Club here at 10:00.
San Jose, which generally man
ages to come up with a top team,
is a strong, fast squad featuring

Lon Christiansen, a former Pan
American Games water poloist.
Coach Art Lambert's Spartans
lost to California, 1-1-7, Wednes
day, and Card mentor Jim Gaugh
ran sees some hope for his
charges if they can come up with
a top effort.
The Olympic Club, featuring
top ex-collegians from the Bay
Area, have won two National
AAU championships in the last
four years, but don't figure to
be quite so strong this campaign.
Leading the Winged "O" is Zol
tar Hospitar, former Rumanian
Olympics water polo star, who
came to the U.S. after the 1956
Olympics with a group of defect
ing Hungarians and Rumanians.
Supporting Hospital are Bob
Gaughran, former COP flash and
brother of Stanford Coach Jim,
and Boyd Mickley, both of whom
dent their opponents' goals with
regularity.
