BY KATHLEEN DOWNING
Dr. David B. Stenzel of the
Hist or y Department said last
night that "considering the over
all picture, not just the events
since May, both the foreign and
domestic scenes are encourag
ing."
Stenzel spoke before the Repub
lican Caucus of the Political
Union. He said considering the
fact that communist infiltration
into mainland China began before
1917 and before the beginning of
the containment policy, our for
eign relations have re m aine d
"quite good."
"INSTEAD of withdrawing to
the North American Continent."
he said, "we have helped revital
ize Europe, and the United Na
tions has become a force for the
small nations."
Reviewing the last 15 years of
foreign policy, Stenzel said "the
Rod Chinese laughed their heads
off at our dilemma over Quemoy
and Matsu. But if we're not care
ful, the offshore islands could be
come a major crisis."
Switching to the candidates,
Stenzel said their foreign policies
are necessarily similar. He said
any debate of foreign policy is
superfluous because "both candi
dates agree that the present pol
icy, containment, is best for the
nation."
"THE DEMOCRATS are wrong
to create a campaign issue of
world events since May," Stenzel
said. "A successful statesman can
no! make hasty generalizations or
determine his foreign policy
purely from weekly journal re
ports."
Stenzel commented that "Ken
nedy's judgment is basically
sound," and would settle down if
he gets into office.
Stenzel is an assistant profes
sor of history and obtained his
Ph.D. in modern diplomacy from
the University of California.
