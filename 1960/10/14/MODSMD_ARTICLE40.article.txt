# Card Harriers Host Spartans In Opening Intercollegiate Run
## 
### 
A STAR-STUDDED cross coun
try field will run over the rolling,
winding three-mile trail on the
Stanford Golf Course today in
the year's first intercollegiate
meet for the In d i a 11 harriers.
Stanford will run against San
Jose State in the official meet,
while Santa Clara Youth Village
will also compete unofficially in
the 4 p.m. event.
The Spartan cross country men
will present a stern challenge for
Coach P a y to 11 Jordan's crew.
Leading the park will be Charlie
Clark, the N'CAA champion in
the steeplechase. Clark, the na
tional junior college record holder
in the mile and two-mile, was a
cinch for the-Olympic team until
he was hurt in the AAU finals.
THREE OTHER San Jose hat
riers have times of better than
4:15 in the mile. Frank Wulftang
was one of the top distance men
on last year's Spartan varsity,
while sophomore Ron Davis was
their leading miler. Neither do
the Spartans lack top freshmen,
for Ben Tucker, state high school
mile champ from Poly of San
Francisco, will be among the top
men that Bud Winter, assistant
coach of the Olympic track team,
will bring to the Farm.
There is some uncertainty con
cerning the exact makeup of the
Santa Clara squad. However, the
top men likely to run for the
Youth Village include two sub

four-minute milers. Jim Beatty, |
American record holder in the
mile and 3,000 meters, will prob
ably be among the starters. Las-1
zlo Tabori, Hungarian refugee
who could have vastly aided the
American Olympians had he been i
eligible, may also run. Mike Mc-!
Gee, who specializes in the 5,000 I
meters, should add to the fast
pace.
NEVERTHELESS, the Stan-;
ford runners should be able to
make a good showing in this!
meet, which still rates as merely j
an early season development test.
Jordan and Assistant Coach Jim
Terrill are pleased with the |
grouping which the runners haves
shown in practice, and the Indians !
should have more depth than;
their opposition.
Eight runners have been run
ning buncJied in practice, this be-1
ing one of the most vital elements j
in cross country. Besides the top '
four of John Nortlnvay, Rich
Klier, Robin Ruble and Bill Pratt,
surprising frosh Ralph Weidner
and Larry S h a 112 e r, and sopho
mores Bruce Johnson and Robin
Nowinski have moved up into the
top group.
The Stanford harriers are very j
young, numbering four frosh in
the top eight, and the outstand
ing opposition will provide a
chance for them to test their ;
speed in pointing for the later
conference meets.

Leading the park will be Charlie
Clark, the N'CAA champion in
the steeplechase. Clark, the na
tional junior college record holder
in the mile and two-mile, was a
cinch for the-Olympic team until
he was hurt in the AAU finals.
THREE OTHER San Jose hat
riers have times of better than
4:15 in the mile. Frank Wulftang
was one of the top distance men
on last year's Spartan varsity,
while sophomore Ron Davis was
their leading miler. Neither do
the Spartans lack top freshmen,
for Ben Tucker, state high school
mile champ from Poly of San
Francisco, will be among the top
men that Bud Winter, assistant
coach of the Olympic track team,
will bring to the Farm.
There is some uncertainty con
cerning the exact makeup of the
Santa Clara squad. However, the
top men likely to run for the
Youth Village include two sub

four-minute milers. Jim Beatty, |
American record holder in the
mile and 3,000 meters, will prob
ably be among the starters. Las-1
zlo Tabori, Hungarian refugee
who could have vastly aided the
American Olympians had he been i
eligible, may also run. Mike Mc-!
Gee, who specializes in the 5,000 I
meters, should add to the fast
pace.
NEVERTHELESS, the Stan-;
ford runners should be able to
make a good showing in this!
meet, which still rates as merely j
an early season development test.
Jordan and Assistant Coach Jim
Terrill are pleased with the |
grouping which the runners haves
shown in practice, and the Indians !
should have more depth than;
their opposition.
Eight runners have been run

ing one of the most vital elements j
in cross country. Besides the top '
four of John Nortlnvay, Rich
Klier, Robin Ruble and Bill Pratt,
surprising frosh Ralph Weidner
and Larry S h a 112 e r, and sopho
mores Bruce Johnson and Robin
Nowinski have moved up into the
top group.
The Stanford harriers are very j
young, numbering four frosh in
the top eight, and the outstand

chance for them to test their ;
speed in pointing for the later
