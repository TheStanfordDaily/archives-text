"After reading your poorly
phrased challenge which appeared
in Monday's "edition," we on the
CHAPPIE staff could not help
smiling a little, between sympa
thetic sighs. Such naivete must
give us pause. The Doily will
never learn.
"When we considered your chal
lenge, wc wondered at your au
dacity. After all, five consecutive
defeats at the hands of an always
powerful CHAPPIE ELEVEN
ought to convince the most vain
of people. I beg you to avoid this
crashing humiliation.
"However, we will condesend.
Once again we snatch up the
gaunlet! You deserve another
chance. Perhaps this year you
can muster enough strength to
provide an adequate scrimmage.
Of course, you cannot hope to
win, but a fair showing would
be bettor than none at all. If we
are beating you too badly in the
first half, wc promise to play our
office girls so you will have
nearly equal opposition in the
second half. The men of the
CHAPPIE staff will meet you at
the traditional spot, 10 a.m. Sat
urday, Oct. 22."
