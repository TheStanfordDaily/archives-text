# Nixon, Kennedy Wage TV Battle Over Defense of Quemoy, Matsu
## Democratic Nominee s Use of Notes Sparks Little Debate 
### United Press International 
Republican Richard M. Nixon and Democrat John F. Kennedy
waged a transcontinental TV battle last night over whether their
conflicting policies on defense of Quemoy and Matsu would mean
peace or war for America.
The presidential candidates also clashed over the GOP administra
tions disarmament efforts, timing of the U-2 flight, former President

Truman's campaign language,
economic growth, labor policy
and food prices.
At the close of their third "great:
debate," Nixon touched off post-
TV fireworks by strongly object
ing to Kennedy's use of notes dur
ing their "split screen" appear
ance. He said he understood no
! notes were to bo used.
A SPOKESMAN for Kennedy,
who appeared from New York
while Nixon spoke from Holly
wood, retorted that no agreement
had been made governing the use
of notes. He said the papers cited
by Nixon were photostats of of
ficial letters supporting Ken
nedy's stand.
During tlie debate. Kennedy and
Nixon used some of their sharp
est language of the campaign in
expanding on their positions to
ward the islands of Quemoy ami
IVfatsu jiisl off the Red Chinese
coast.
It boiled down to Kennedy
! maintaining his position that the
islands were impossible to defend
and Nixon, although making a
i slight change in earlier state
ments, insisting they would not
be "surrendered" without bowing
to the Rods.
IN A statement issued shortly
after the program, Republican
National Chairman Thruston B.
Morton declared that "Nixon
again was the clear winner."
One of the debate's sharpest ex
changes on domestic issues came
when Nixon charged that Ken
nedys' farm program would boost
food prices by 2.3 per cent. Ken
nedy retorted that Nixon was
wrong, saying any increase in
farmers' income would not have
a corresponding effect on consu
mer prices.
THE WHITE House rivals also
| tangled oi-er the question of cut
' ting the 27'j tax depletion allow
ance for''oil.
