# Two Suspended For Bad Conduct
## 
### 
A sophomore and senior were
suspended from school for one
year by Men's Council last night
for drunk driving and yelling ob
scenities at Guthrie House last
weekend.
The two were caught by Stan
ford police after faculty members
five houses away complained of
the loud swearing.
The heavy penalty, according
to Dean of Men William G. Craig,
was part of a new crackdown on
drunk driving and obscene con
duct.
