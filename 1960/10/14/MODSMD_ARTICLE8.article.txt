## 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Without a dissenting vote and after a surprisingly calm debate, Stanford's student legislature
(LASSU) last night rejected a proposed "Student Fair Play for Cuba Committee" constitution.
Legislature moved after listening to Tom Mayer, listed as president of the group, present the
committee's case. Several members of LASSU did recommend that the organization investigate the
possibilities of affiliating with the Institute of International Relations.

Till-; CONSTITUTION was in
| troduced al last week's LASSU
I meeting and was sent to the By
| laws and Rules Committee so the
I University's views on the matter
j could be obtained.
Ed Cutter, chairman of the com
! mittee and administrative assist
i ant to ASSU President Larry
1 Royse, reported that Dean of Stu
i dents H. Donald Winbigler told
! him the committee's policies
would not lie consistent with Uni-
I versity policy.
THE BOARD of Trustees has
i for a long time banned partisan
| political activity on campus, un
-1 less the other side of the story is
j represented, as in the Political
| Union caucuses.
In its proposed constitution, the
' Cuba group stated its purpose as:
". . . to bring information about
the Cuban Revolution to" Stan
ford students "through the dis
tribution of literature, the bring
: ing of speakers, and the showing
of documentary films on the
Revolution, in order to deepen
their understanding of the dy
namic force which is the Cuban
Revolution."

resentative, questioned whether
the committee would "be respon
sible in its actions," since a cou
ple of its members had been in
volved in illegal actions as mem
bers of an unofficial "Cuba De
fense Committee" which caused a
furor on the campus during the
summer.
Mayer countered that the "Fair
Play" committee was not linked
to the Cuban Defense Committee,
land the importance of the Cuban
i revolt was argument enough for
the establishment of the Stanford
| committee.
The only person to argue for
passing the constitution was
| Daily Editor Barry Greenberg.
who said that even if the com
mittee presented nothing but
propaganda, students would be
mature enough to determine facts
' from purely partisan statements.
