### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
The lowest level to which Stan- j
ford football has ever fallen. ,
That's the only way to describe i
Saturday's game with San Jose I
State, preceded as it was by four i
consecutive defeats, and probably j
to be followed by at least four j
more losses.
The score was 34 to 20. but that !
was not really indicative of what :
happened in the game. The defeat
was much worse than that. The
lews that is said about the fiasco,
the better, for everyone who saw
it wants to forget, and everybody
who didn't see it was lucky.
Beginning five minutes before
the game was over, and lasting I
some 4") minutes afterwards, stu- j
dents from both sides of the field
let off steam in a bloody battle 1
for the north goal posts, which |
were defended far more ably than
the Indian goal line before they,
too, finally fell.
THE Spartan rooters were cele
brating their upset victory, but
the stunned Stanfordites were
merely trying senselessly and fu- j
tilely to salvage the last ounce of •
Card prestige.
The free-for-all, involving a
group variously estimated as be
tween 500 and 1,200 students, be
gan when jubilant San Jose fans
streamed onto the field midway
in the fourth period and started
to mass for the assault on the
goal posts, traditional victory tro
phies among close rivals.
Almost immediately Stanford's
red-shirted student police an
swered the challenge by surround
ing the posts in an attempt to
keep them standing at least until
the end of the game.
THIS had the effect of merely
inciting the crowd and fist fights
began to break out. Relative
peace and quiet, however pre
vailed until only one second re
mained on the scoreboard clock.
At this time the south goal posts
were quickly dismantled without
opposition by a small group of
elementary and junior high school
kids. As soon as the gun sounded,
the alternating assault waves and

repulsions began in earnest. By
then, the student police had with
drawn, counting three members
among the wounded, but a badly
outnumbered band of diehard In
dian partisans and a few cops
were carrying on the defense.
Not until 20 minutes later did
the left upright and crossbar
fall. The right upright took an
other 14 minutes, and only then,
at ten minutes before five, did
the crowd begin to disperse. Al
though no one was seriously in
jured, about 10 participants re
ceived first aid treatment, with
black eyes and bloody noses all
around.
Till') goal posts, as far as mone
tary value goes, were not worth
defending. Years ago Stanford
authorities began using light
wood and not planting the posts
deeply, just to prevent such riots
as this. But to the students,
there was a principle involved.
For Ihe morbidly curious, the
game belonged to San Jose all

the way. From the opening play
from scrimmage il was apparent
that the tremendous Spartan
speed was going to spell TROU
BLE for the Indians.
Or that one Maek Burton got
completely away from Skip Face
on a pass pattern and only the
fact that lie dropped the ball pre
vented a quick score. However,
the dye for the day had been cast.
Mike Jones, who played a great
game despite almost constant
pressure from the Stanford line,

began connecting almost immedi
ately with his fast backs, and with
Burton and Willie Williams skirt
ing the ends the Spartans moved
to Stanford's 4. Only a fumble by
Williams and two passes which
Skip Face knocked down in the

end zone kept San Jose from scor
ing at once.
THIS didn't really make any
difference, because Gil Dowd
fumbled on the first play from
scrimmage and San Jose took
over on the 10. Four plays later
Johnny (Touchdown) Johnson
lived, up to his rvkname in plung
ing over for the first of his four
scores.
After the kickoff Stanford was
forced to punt almost immedi
ately, and the story was the same.
With the ball on the Indian 29-
yard line. Johnson took the ball
on a draw play and eluded the
entire defense to go into the end
zone. With two minutes .still re
maining in the first quarter ihe
score stood San Jose 14, Stanford
0, as Indian rooters stared in
shocked disbelief.
And still the Stanfordites were
unable to raise a hand in their
own defense. Midway in the sec
ond period Jones, with good pro
tection. floated a long pass to
Burton, who had long since out
run Gary Craig and John Bessey.
The play covered 47 yards and the
score stood 21 to nothing at the
half.
In defense of the Indians, it
must be said that they did show
a few flashes of brilliant play late
in the half. On one play Dick
Norman passed to Dale Ostrander
and the latter broke away on a
fine 37-yard run before the last
man nailed him.
AND the second string line of

Steve Pursell, Randy Vahan,
Chuck Buehler, Tom Walsh and
Errol Scott threw San Jose for
three losses totalling 13 yards on
one series.
Starting the second half, it
seemed for a moment that the
Indians might pull it out. It took
just four minutes and 30 seconds
for Rod Sears to pilot the team
to a score, with Skip Face's 30-
yard run the big gainer.
But the Spartans scored in just
three and one-half minutes, John
son again, and the game was out
of reach at 27-6.
Football took second impor

lance to the riot in the fourth pe
riod. but for the record, Johnson
scored once more, making it 34
to 6. With the pressure off, the
Spartans eased up and allowed
two consolation touchdowns, scor
ed by Jerry Winters on a pass
from Sears and by third-string
right, half Ed Cummings on a
line plunge.
LATE in the quarter, Sears
threw three consecutive perfect
passes, all of which bounced off
the chests of his intended receiv
ers, typifying the plight of Stan
ford quarterbacks throughout the
game.
