### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
The lowest level to which Stan- j
ford football has ever fallen. ,
That's the only way to describe i
Saturday's game with San Jose I
State, preceded as it was by four i
consecutive defeats, and probably j
to be followed by at least four j
more losses.
The score was 34 to 20. but that !
