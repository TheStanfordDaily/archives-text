# Nixon: Negroes in Cabinet; Kennedy: Drop Quemoy
## 
### UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
Both Nixon and Kennedy strove yesterday to show a united front
although in different political areas of interest. While Nixon was
saying that if he is elected president he will appoint cabinet mem
bers "without regard to race, creed or color," Kennedy said he was
willing to drop the Quemoy-Matsu subject to keep from presenting
la divided national front to the

Chinese Communists, thus en
dangering the security of the
United States.
Talking to reporters during a
short stroll from the hotel, in
Ilartford, Conn., where the meet
ings were held at his own quar
ters, Nixon declined to go as far
as Lodge had gone only a few
minutes earlier on the question
of appointing a Negro to the cab
inet.
Lodge insisted to newsmen that
he had not—as he had been
quoted - pledged such an ap
pointment during a campaign
speech in New York City's Har
lem. but he told reporters, "I
think it would be a wonderful
thing to have a Negro in the cabi
net and I'm still for it."
AT THE SAME time, in Wash
ington D.C., the Democratic nomi
nee said there was no point in
carrying on the Quemoy-Matsu
dispute "unless he (Nixon) wants
to continue it. I'm prepared to
move on to other issues," Ken
nedy asserted. "I do not want the
Chinese Communists to think
Americans are divided. And I
would not want to endanger bi
partisanship in foreign policy."
He said he was in full agree
ment with the policy laid down
by Congress and backed by Presi
dent Eisenhower that this country
should defend the off-shore is
lands only if they were attacked
as part of an invasion jab against
Formosa.
"If we both agree with the
president," Kennedy said, "the
matter is then closed."
NIXON'S PRESS secretary,
Herbert G. Klein, said the "only
way" the Quemoy-Matsu issue
would be dropped is if Kennedy
"makes it clear ho no longer fa
vors surrendering the islands."
Klein said there would be no
further comment 011 the issue at
this time from the Nixon camp.

further comment 011 the issue at
this time from the Nixon camp.
Both Nixon and Kennedy strove yesterday to show a united front
although in different political areas of interest. While Nixon was
saying that if he is elected president he will appoint cabinet mem
bers "without regard to race, creed or color," Kennedy said he was
willing to drop the Quemoy-Matsu subject to keep from presenting
la divided national front to the

Chinese Communists, thus en
dangering the security of the
United States.
Talking to reporters during a
short stroll from the hotel, in
Ilartford, Conn., where the meet
ings were held at his own quar
ters, Nixon declined to go as far
as Lodge had gone only a few
minutes earlier on the question
of appointing a Negro to the cab
inet.
Lodge insisted to newsmen that
he had not—as he had been
quoted - pledged such an ap
pointment during a campaign
speech in New York City's Har
lem. but he told reporters, "I
think it would be a wonderful
thing to have a Negro in the cabi
net and I'm still for it."
AT THE SAME time, in Wash
ington D.C., the Democratic nomi
nee said there was no point in
carrying on the Quemoy-Matsu
dispute "unless he (Nixon) wants
to continue it. I'm prepared to
move on to other issues," Ken
nedy asserted. "I do not want the
Chinese Communists to think
Americans are divided. And I
would not want to endanger bi
partisanship in foreign policy."
He said he was in full agree
ment with the policy laid down
by Congress and backed by Presi
dent Eisenhower that this country
should defend the off-shore is
lands only if they were attacked
as part of an invasion jab against
Formosa.
"If we both agree with the
president," Kennedy said, "the
matter is then closed."
NIXON'S PRESS secretary,
Herbert G. Klein, said the "only
way" the Quemoy-Matsu issue
would be dropped is if Kennedy
"makes it clear ho no longer fa
vors surrendering the islands."
Klein said there would be no
further comment 011 the issue at
this time from the Nixon camp.
