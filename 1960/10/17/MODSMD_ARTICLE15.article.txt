# A 						Black Day
## 
### 
Stanford's loss to San Jose State Saturday marks one of ihe
blackest days in Stanford football history. The Indians have been
defeated by worse scores, but this is only the second time that they
have losl to little San Jose in eighteen years, and only the first
lime that ihev have been actually slaughtered.
Safurdav's debacle naturally raises a very critical question:
should Stanford continue to compete with major schools? Even a
more fundamental question is raised: should Stanford continue to
play football?
The reason for Stanford's continually sagging football fortunes
is fairly obvious. As our academic requirements continue to soar
and soar, the great high school football players, who are all too
often rather poor students, go elsewhere where they are not likely
to flunk out.
Stanford refuses to recruit good football players who are poor
students. Other schools are not so ethical and will see to it that
good athletes are '"properly taken care of. * Iho Daily does not
condone such activity. We compliment Stanford on its high stand
ard of ethics.
Proper ethics, however, is not conducive to a winning football
team. If we glance into the future, there is no reason to hope that
Stanford teams will get any better. As a matter of fact, our for
tunes are likely to deteriorate as our academic requirements con
tinue to become more stringent.
W hat, then, is the answer? Hanging Coach Curtice in effigy is
surely not going to solve anything. At best, Curtice is only par
tially to blame. He came from I tab University with an excellent
record and there is no reason to assume that he could not do an
excellent job if given the proper material.
\\ e do not think Stanford should give up football entirely.
Too many people enjoy watching the sport, even if the team is
very prior. We do suggest, however, that the Athletic Department
seriously consider encountering smaller, non-A AW U teams such as
COP and local schools which do not come to Palo Alto with huge
monsters who simply rip our light line to shreds.
Th ere is one other factor which deserves mention. Ihe aca
demic requirements of other schools are also on the rise and it i«s
conceivable that they, too, will discover that the\ cannot get the
good players because they cannot maintain good grades.
In due time the A AW"U schools coidd find themselves in the
same sinking boat with Stanford. Rut this is purely hypothetical
and even if it were to happen it would be many, many years from
now. This obviously does not solve the immediate problem of
fielding a team which can bold its own.
The football team could make this editorial a little premature
by whipping the daylights out of powerful I CI.A next Saturday.
\\ e hope they will: we seriously doubt that they can.

W hat, then, is the answer? Hanging Coach Curtice in effigy is
surely not going to solve anything. At best, Curtice is only par
tially to blame. He came from I tab University with an excellent
record and there is no reason to assume that he could not do an
excellent job if given the proper material.
\\ e do not think Stanford should give up football entirely.
Too many people enjoy watching the sport, even if the team is
very prior. We do suggest, however, that the Athletic Department
seriously consider encountering smaller, non-A AW U teams such as
COP and local schools which do not come to Palo Alto with huge
monsters who simply rip our light line to shreds.
Th ere is one other factor which deserves mention. Ihe aca
demic requirements of other schools are also on the rise and it i«s
conceivable that they, too, will discover that the\ cannot get the
good players because they cannot maintain good grades.
In due time the A AW"U schools coidd find themselves in the
same sinking boat with Stanford. Rut this is purely hypothetical
and even if it were to happen it would be many, many years from
now. This obviously does not solve the immediate problem of
fielding a team which can bold its own.
The football team could make this editorial a little premature
by whipping the daylights out of powerful I CI.A next Saturday.
\\ e hope they will: we seriously doubt that they can.
Stanford's loss to San Jose State Saturday marks one of ihe
blackest days in Stanford football history. The Indians have been
defeated by worse scores, but this is only the second time that they
have losl to little San Jose in eighteen years, and only the first
lime that ihev have been actually slaughtered.
Safurdav's debacle naturally raises a very critical question:
should Stanford continue to compete with major schools? Even a
more fundamental question is raised: should Stanford continue to
play football?
The reason for Stanford's continually sagging football fortunes
is fairly obvious. As our academic requirements continue to soar
and soar, the great high school football players, who are all too
often rather poor students, go elsewhere where they are not likely
to flunk out.
Stanford refuses to recruit good football players who are poor
students. Other schools are not so ethical and will see to it that
good athletes are '"properly taken care of. * Iho Daily does not
condone such activity. We compliment Stanford on its high stand
ard of ethics.
Proper ethics, however, is not conducive to a winning football
team. If we glance into the future, there is no reason to hope that
Stanford teams will get any better. As a matter of fact, our for
tunes are likely to deteriorate as our academic requirements con
tinue to become more stringent.
