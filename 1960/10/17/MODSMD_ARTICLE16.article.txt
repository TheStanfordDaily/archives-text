Editor, the Daily:
It is lime for Stanford Republi
cans to defend their stand and
assert their beliefs. The tendency
has been, when we listen to such
democratic speakers as Represen
tative Chester Bowies, to agree
with them that, the Democratic
Party is the party of the Ameri
can people—and the only party
pledged to the good of the Ameri
can nation.
We are led to believe that there
are two separate views in this
nation as to what the position of
the country is in t lie world, and
as to how the country can best
meet the demands upon it in
these times. This is certainly un
true. All earnest leaders, regard
less of party affiliation, do agree
that the United .States stands for
freedom and that it stands as an
altruistic benefactor.
Men of both parties, as Vice
President Nixon has said, agree
upon our national goals. All
would agree that we must find
the most effective means of in
stituting these goals, of putting
our ideals to forwarding good
work. While the Democrats say,
"We can do the job"; Republicans
say, "We must work unilaterally
to back the best plans and not
necessarily the first ones."
The Democrats have irration
ally presented us with a platform
built upon promises of good
deeds. It promises aid to the aged,
higher wages for workers, a bet
ter farm policy, a stronger posi
tion in international affairs—
without proposing specific solu
tions.
It would hope to solve this
country's needs in four years, per
haps eight. The Democrats are
inspired by a tremendous desire
to do good and right now. They
are impatient to correct and to
mend. Their impatience is unde
sirable in these important, dan
gerous times.
The Republicans, on the other
hand, promise the patience of an
experienced man. They possess

the same intense desire to correct
and to mend, but they fully real
ize that effective solutions are
easy to come by—that, unfortu
nate complexities developing over
several decades are unimpressed
with shows of intense verbal op
position.
So we see that the Republican
Party is also of the American
people—as well as of these times.

Editor, the Daily:
Last Saturday, at the hands of
SJS, already humiliated Stanford
football sank to an all-time low.
The time has come to present and
examine the problems now facing
Indian football.
Under the present coaching
staff, the record stands at five
wins and twenty losses. Winning
every game cannot be expected,
and definite hardships face a
coach at this particularinstitution.
but this embarrassing record de
serves attention.
Stanford has been confronted
with a decision over the past few
years. The question is: should
Stanford compete in a first-rate
football league or should the Uni
versity admit that its teams are
no longer competent because of
inadequate material and coach
ing, to play this brand of football?
In becoming a member of the
recently formed AAWII, Stanford
has already made the decision in
favor of competition with first
rate opponents. Therefore, we
loyally feel the coaching staff
should be given the recruiting
freedom it needs, and that this
staff be hold directly responsible
for reasonable performance.
We realize that no team can be
j expected to win all its games, but
: neither should any squad go down
! in humiliating defeat Saturday
after Saturday, with no reason to
j expect future success.
