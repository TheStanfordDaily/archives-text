It is unwise of Mr. Nixon 1o pro
fend that there is no problem of
American prestige no problem,
that is to say, of our power and
influence relative to that of the
Soviet Union. This is in fact the
supreme American problem in
this era. For there is no doubt at
all that the position of the Soviet
Union in world affairs has risen
greatly in the past ten years. This
is one of the facts of life. The
Soviet Union has risen from mili
tary inferiority to military parity,
and from a close containment its
influence has expanded into all
the continents.
The problem of our relative
power and influence is not an ima
ginary problem. It was not
dreamed up by the Harvard pro
fessors or by the Kennedy family.
It is the paramount problem
which dominates all of our deal
ings with the outer world.
The president cannot be taken
seriously when he says, as on
Monday, that there is no such
problem because we have not lost
a vote in the U.N. in fifteen years,
because a hundred heads of state
have expressed a desire to visit
the United States, because Presi
dent Sukarno told him that the
neutral nations always look to
the United States to maintain
peace in an international crisis.
This is talking: down to the vot
ers. It is treating them like ignor
ant children. It is to assume not
only that they do not know the
score, but are incapable of find
ing' out what it is.
An abject view of the problem
of prestige must begin, it seems
to me, with the position of the
United States at the end of the
second World War. With our
monopoly of the atomic bomb,
with our brilliant economy in a
world where victors and van
quished alike were on the edge of
prostration, we were invincible
and invulnerable in war and with
out an equal in the councils of
peace.
We were the leading influence
in vast new areas of the world
which had never before been
within the American sphere of
influence, the whole Pacific
Ocean to the shores of Asia, Eu
rope to the frontiers of the occu
pation, and all the lands behind
the theaters of war from which
Japan and Germany had been ex
pelled, into which the Russians
had not yet been able to enter.
In the first few years after the
war American power and influ
ence had been extended far be
yond anything Americans had
ever dreamed of or that any sane

American ever wanted. In many
critical ways, as in Ihe .Marshall
Plan and in (Mir plans for the res
toration el' the vanquished, we
used our power and influence ef
fectively and beneficiently. Bill
there was a grievous fault in our
policy. II was flic failure to rea
lize that our position was greater
than it could remain, that we were
over-extended and that we must
prepare to climb down from the
dazzling 1 paramountry of the first
post-war year.
The turning point at which our
descent had to begin was in
when the Soviet Union not only
broke our monoply of nuclear
weapons but showed the world
that out of the devastation of the
war she had achieved an economy
capable of the highest feats in
technology and production. The
story of the '50s is the story of our
failure to rise to this challenge,
indeed to realize it.and our fail
ure to achieve a foreign policy
for what was becoming a wholly
new balance of power in the
world and a wholly new situation.
This failure to realize what had
happened as a result of the rise
of the Soviet Union has left us
with an economy which is slug
gish as compared with our vital
needs. It has left us with a de
fense establishment which is not
leading but is working hard to
catch up in the race of arma
ments. It has left us with a for
eign policy which is defensive and
which lacks initiative because at
so many critical points it has been
immobile—inimboile because of
our entanglements with Syngman
Rhee and with Chiang Kai-shek,
and on a different level with
Dr. Adenauer.
The issue of our prestige is
surely the overriding issue in this
election. But it is a difficult one
to explain, as .Mr. Kennedy is
finding, and it is an easy one to
obfuscate, as Mr. Nixon and Mr.
Lodge are demonstrating. But the
last word has not yet been
spoken.
