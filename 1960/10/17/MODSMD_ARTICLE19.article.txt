Did I like it? What is my im
pression? These are questions
people have been asking me; from
a man in a Brooklyn drugstore
to Ed Warren of the ASSU. To
me the 15th session of the Gen
eral Assembly looked like an Ori
ental Open Market, the type one
recalls from childhood after read
ing "Arabian Nights."
It is crowded and noisy. Every
merchant is displaying his most
attractive wares. "Mine is Hie
best!" is the cry echoed by each
huckster.
Here comes .Mr. Khrushchev. I
believe he would make a wonder
ful politician in the Western coun
tries. He has most of the neces
sary qualifications: propaganda

talents, good tactics to attract at
tention and the most noisy hand
pounding I have ever heard, ex
cept in the French National As
sembly.
There you have Ike, Macmillan
and others, doing their best to
prevent Mr. K. and Co. from add
ing any other customer to their
delivery list.
In the middle of the market you
have the neutral salesmen, ex
plaining to the newcomers the
best way to buy cheap, by long
term, and still remain uncom
mitted.
Then you see the new custo
mers, there young African na
tions, some of them on their first
visit to the market. Most of them
are puzzled about which offer to

l accept and what price In pay. We
heard the story of one loader who,
I curiously enough, pledged to the
! East, while the day before he had
i promised to join Ihe West.
So the market with its shout
ing, its sales and purchases, goes
| on.
Do not ask me why hypocrisy
i has replaced sincerity, why big
I lies have expelled the truth, why
egoism has replaced altruism.
Do not remind me of those mil
lions who look towards this mod
fin Mecca praying that compre
hension and not compromise,
i peace and not truce, prosperity
and not charity, should prevail in
the world, theirs, yours and mine.
l)o not ask me.
