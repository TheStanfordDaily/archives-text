# Titchenal Plaudits Teamwork
## 
### 
San Jose State Coach Bob
Titchenal kept saying it over and
over again.
"It was a team victory, a real
team victory. This is by far ihe
best effort I've had. They really
wanted to win this one."
Titchenal explained his team's
34-20 win over Stanford further
by -saying that they just bounced
back after getting kicked around
by Oregon last week. San Jose
lost that one 33-0.
"Mike Jones had a lot to do
with the way the offense clicked,"
the Spartan coach said of his
quarterback. "Ho was faking tre
mendously."
Titchenal then went on to sin
gle out half a dozen standouts for
San Jose. John Johnson, Doug
McChesney, Captain Dick Filer
and others were all outstanding
on defense, he Â«aid.
About Stanford he could only
say what was readily apparent.
"They weren't up for this game."
Titchenal said. "They had their
big one last week. When you play
Washington one week, it's tough
to gel your team up for San Jose
the next."
"Their quarterbacks were hit
ting," he said. "But they've got
no catchers. That's the difference
between Stanford last year and
ihis year. It's tough on a passing
game if you haven't got anyone
who can catch the ball."
Titchenal said that he told the
loam between the halves thai
iheir 21 point halftime lead
wouldn't be enough. "We went
out to score some more," he said.
"I knew we'd have to or we'd get
beat."

"We play Arizona State next
week. They're unbeaten and I
hope this win brings us up for
them."
