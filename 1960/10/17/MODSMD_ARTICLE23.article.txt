# Indian Soccer Team Blanks USF, Eyes Conference Title
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
THE STANFORD soccer team
performed a miracle Saturday.
They defeated mighty USF for
the first time in 13 years by a 2-0
margin and the city team was
beaten much more soundly than
the score indicates. With the vic
tory Stanford became co-favorite,
along with CCSF, to capture the
West Coast Soccer Conference
title.
In all probability, the confer
ence title will be decided on No
vember when Stanford faces
CCSF in San Francisco. Next
week Stanford should extend its
winning streak to four in a row
against Santa Clara, as inept a
soccer team as pver kicked a ball.
Last week, CCSF defeated them
15-1, and Saturday Cal walked off
with a 12-0 victory.
Stanford dominated heavily fa
vored USF and showed that either
USF is over-rated or, more likely,
Stanford lias a very good team.
Throughout the game, USF had
its back to the wall as the Stan
ford defense completely con
trolled the vaunted USF attack.
-lan Achenbach, Bernie Knaggs,
Dan Farthing, Dick Voake, Beau
Bianchi and Rusty Williams con
sistently stole the ball from the
shifty USF forwards, and gener
ally wrecked havoc.
in the first half, Stanford kept
the ball in USF territory, but
could not score. This same pat
tern was evident in the third quar
ter, but good goal-keeping kept
the Indians off the scoreboard un
til late in the quarter, when Rune
Engebrettsen fielded a shot
which rebounded off a USF full

back and fed it to Adam Bianchi,
who promptly got the first score
of the game.
USF became aroused after the
Stanford goal, and it took two
exceptional defensive plays to
keep the Stanford goal unscathed.
TIIK FIRST was made by Ach
enbach, who was called by one
observer "the best center-half
Stanford has had in the last six
years." Goalie Bianchi was sucked
out of the goal by a USF shot.
The ball was passed over the mid
dle and shot at the vacant goal.
Achenbach was going one direc
tion, but he changed his direction
in midst ride and blocked the shot
with his head.
The other great save was made
by Bianchi. A USF forward got
past the back line and drove to
the goal mouth. Bianchi came out
to meet him and picked the ball
off tho USF man's foot just as he
shot.
USF became angered no little
bit by the frustrating Indian de
fense, and roughed up Emmanuel
Andah as he tried a shot.
BERNIIO KNAfifiS made the
penalty kick to give Stanford the
final margin of 2-0.
As an indication of how com
pletely Stanford dominated the
game, USF managed to take only
8 shots during the whole game,
as opposed to 20 for Stanford.
In a preliminary game, the
Stanford JV's defeated USF's

JV's 20. Stanford's goals were
made by Jerry Sehaeffer and Il<>-
horto Santa-Cruz.
Good defensive work by Bob
Cormack and Martin Olson was
an important factor in the vie
t orv.

THE STANFORD soccer team
performed a miracle Saturday.
They defeated mighty USF for
the first time in 13 years by a 2-0
margin and the city team was
beaten much more soundly than
the score indicates. With the vic
tory Stanford became co-favorite,
along with CCSF, to capture the
West Coast Soccer Conference
title.
In all probability, the confer
ence title will be decided on No
vember when Stanford faces
CCSF in San Francisco. Next
week Stanford should extend its
winning streak to four in a row
against Santa Clara, as inept a
soccer team as pver kicked a ball.
Last week, CCSF defeated them
15-1, and Saturday Cal walked off
with a 12-0 victory.
Stanford dominated heavily fa
vored USF and showed that either
USF is over-rated or, more likely,
Stanford lias a very good team.
Throughout the game, USF had
its back to the wall as the Stan
ford defense completely con
trolled the vaunted USF attack.
-lan Achenbach, Bernie Knaggs,
Dan Farthing, Dick Voake, Beau
Bianchi and Rusty Williams con
sistently stole the ball from the
shifty USF forwards, and gener
ally wrecked havoc.
in the first half, Stanford kept
the ball in USF territory, but
could not score. This same pat
tern was evident in the third quar
ter, but good goal-keeping kept
the Indians off the scoreboard un
til late in the quarter, when Rune
Engebrettsen fielded a shot
which rebounded off a USF full

back and fed it to Adam Bianchi,
who promptly got the first score
of the game.
USF became aroused after the
Stanford goal, and it took two
exceptional defensive plays to
keep the Stanford goal unscathed.
TIIK FIRST was made by Ach
enbach, who was called by one
observer "the best center-half
Stanford has had in the last six
years." Goalie Bianchi was sucked
out of the goal by a USF shot.
The ball was passed over the mid
dle and shot at the vacant goal.
Achenbach was going one direc
tion, but he changed his direction
in midst ride and blocked the shot
with his head.
The other great save was made
by Bianchi. A USF forward got
past the back line and drove to
the goal mouth. Bianchi came out
to meet him and picked the ball
off tho USF man's foot just as he
shot.
USF became angered no little
bit by the frustrating Indian de
fense, and roughed up Emmanuel
Andah as he tried a shot.
BERNIIO KNAfifiS made the
penalty kick to give Stanford the
final margin of 2-0.
As an indication of how com
pletely Stanford dominated the
game, USF managed to take only
8 shots during the whole game,
as opposed to 20 for Stanford.
In a preliminary game, the
Stanford JV's defeated USF's

JV's 20. Stanford's goals were
made by Jerry Sehaeffer and Il<>-
horto Santa-Cruz.
