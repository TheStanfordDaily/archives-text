# Mobutu Try For Peace Confab Fails
## 
### 
LEOPOLDVILLE, The Congo
(UPIi â€” Strongman Col. Joseph
Mobutu conferred yesterday with
President Moise Tshombe of
secessionist K a t a n g a Province
and said they both agreed Com
munism must be kept out of the
Congo.
After their meeting in Elisa
bethville, Tshombe said he would
talk only when "the administra
tion is working again in Leopold
ville."
"For the moment we must let
the colonel (Mobutu) continue his
actions," Tshombe said.
Tshombe advised Mobutu four
days ago that his secessionist gov
ernment would be willing to par
ticipate in a round-table confer
ence as soon as the government
of Premier-Designate Joseph Ileo
would be invested. Katanga had
cold-shouldered an earlier attempt
by Mobutu to line up support.
