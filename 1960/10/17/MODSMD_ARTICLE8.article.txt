### RANDY MILLEN 
"The Game of Kings Chess
Through the Ages" is a very fit
ting title for the display of chess
sets and pieces now at the Stan
ford Museum.
History, geography, art math
ematics. materials science, and
foreign relations are involved in
the exhibit, which traces the his
torical and geographical develop
ment of the game from itÂ« incep
tion in the Near and Middle East
thirteen centuries ago to the mod
ern form in which we play it
today.
In the Museum's lobby are a
number of books and pamphlets
dating from the Medieval period
through the nineteenth century.
In the east wing are manuscripts,
paintings, and engravings, cover
ing the same period of time, show
ing how the game of chess was re
garded by its contemporaries,
These books, manuscripts, and
pictures were lent to the Museum
by Dr. Norman Reider.
IX AUDITION, there are nu
merous sets of chessmen, as well
as individual pieces. The oldest of
these are some wooden pieces
from tenth-century Egypt; the
most modern are contemporary
twentieth century sets. All of
them have one quality in com
mon: they are extremely inter
esting, some for the beauty of
their workmanship, or for the
skill of the artisan who designed
them; others, for their historical
importance; others, for the re
flections of society with which
their designer# imbued them.
Among the many excellent, un
usual. and remarkable sets on

| display, certain ones are partic
ularly noteworthy. These are: A
nineteenth century German set
representing the Prussians versus
Napoleon and his forces, and a
i French set, of ivory, about 1830.
representing the same subject;
a replica of the Isle of Lewis set,
a famous medieval set the orig
inal of which is in the British
Museum.
A VIKXNKKK set, made of am
ber. was exhibited at the Paris
j Exposition of 1879 and formerly
belonged to the collection of the
Hohenzollern family; also in
cluded are a Japanese Shogi set,
dating from the seventeenth cen
tury, and an Indian set of ivory,
from the eighteenth or nineteenth
centuries.
Also included in the showing
are an ebony and ivory inlaid
j chessboard of the same period; a
Sterling silver and gold-plated
American set of the nineteenth
' century, on a marble and agate
: inlaid board; a board of gilt
| metal, with inlaid glass and gems,
| from North Italy or Transylvania,
about 1600; and an acid-etched
i glass board inlaid with gold leaf
and green and black enamel, made
around 1800.
