COLLECTED
POEMS
Durrell's collected poems are not
only noteworthy in themselves but
also shed brilliant new light on a writer who, in an
opinion expressed in 1938 by T. S. Eliot, was the
"first new English writer to give me any hope for the
future of prose fiction." In his poetry, as in his
novels, Durrell's soaring imagination evokes the
atmosphere of the Mediterranean, as he explores
the province of the heart.
"Like a comet trailing sparks, Lawrence Durrell
has flashed over the murky literary landscape. How
magnificent a poet he is, his fast-growing army of
American admirers will learn when they pick up his
Collected Poems. Here is the witchery of phrase
and comparison that make his pages gleam. Music,
says Durrell, is only love looking for words and, as
few others writing today, Durrell has the words,
soft as candlelight or strong as the sun."—Harrison

AfTHE BLACK BOOK
"It's valiant and full of brash guffaws,
and it scintillates and dazzles."—
W. G. Rogers, the Associated Press
"The author is gloriously drunk with sex, sin, scorn,
youth and his own deflowering genius... in it the
reader sees a powerful talent find its place in the
sun, yawn with pleasure and stretch itself luxur
iously."—Time
"Full of high and low comedy.. .The Black BOOK
lavishly displays Durrell's gift of language."—

"The Quartet is one of the major achievements of
fiction in our time, distinguished not only by its
power of language, by its evocation of a place, by
its creation of character, by the drama of its many
incidents, but also by its boldly original design."—
Granville Hicks, Saturday Review
"Because he is incapable of writing a dull sentence
it is possible to open any of the four books any
where and immediately find yourself caught... a
formidable, glittering achievement [with] a time
lessness and placelessness peculiar to works that
are big enough to make a world of their own."—
