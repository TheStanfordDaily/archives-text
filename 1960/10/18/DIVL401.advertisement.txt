Clearing the hurdles with research
At Gen Tel, we've made a running start toward solving y
many of tomorrow's communications problems.
For instance, scientists at General Telephone & Elec
tronics Laboratories are working in the uncharted area
of the spectrum where radio waves take on the character
istics of light. They have already developed an experi
mental ultramicrowave system that may one day make
possible the transmission of two million messages on
a single radio beam in free space.
