The unfortunate and unexpected death of Henry Blautli has
come as a great shock to his many friends and colleagues on tlie
Stanford campus.
Although he was a very good professor, Hr. Blauth"s real tal
ents lav in his association with his students. Mis humor livened
up many a class and made the study of German entertaining as
well as educational. His understanding of students' problems and
his help in solving them will long he remembered by his former
pupils.
Dr. Blautli substituted Stanford and Stanford students for the
family and close relatives which be did not have and he made
the University an integral part of his life. His loss will be mourned
ami regretted bv bis many friends.
