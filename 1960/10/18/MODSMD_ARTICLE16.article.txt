Editor, the Daily:
For the past few years, mem
bers of the Stanford Band and
Rally Commission have devoted
many hours towards developing
a coordinated half-time. Last year,
Stanford was applauded for being
the first school in the West to
develop the idea to its full po
tential.
At the game against the Uni
versity of Washington earlier this
season, a very successful coordi
nated half-time was given unin
terrupted coverage by coast-to
coast television. However, Satur
day's rooting section did not ac
cept the responsibility in present
ing its portion of the show. Be
cause of the unintelligibility of
the preliminary card stunts, none
of the excellent card stunts that
were planned to complement the
band's performance was per
formed. Regardless of the amount
of time spent in planning a half
time, it is the student body, not
the Rally Commission or the
band, which decides whether the
half-time is a success or failure.
The members of the Stanford
Band devote much of their time
to practicing for the ten minutes
they represent their school on the
football field on a Saturday. They
ask nothing from the student
body but to be respected and ap
preciated. I find it hard to in
terpret eggs deliberately thrown
into the band, as it sat in the root
ing section, as objects of apprecia
tion. As a result of the egg throw
ing at the San Jose State game,
four expensive band uniforms
were seriously stained. Fortu
nately, no instruments were dam
aged. However, at this time, it is
difficult to assay the damage that
has been accomplished to the re
lationship between the band and
the student body.
If the band is seen on the foot
ball field in the future, it will be
because the members still enjoy
performing music, are still ap
preciated by the alumni and other
football enthusiasts, and still be
lieve the distance separating the
field and the rooting sections will
be sufficient to protect them from
irrational abuse.

Among the sponsoring groups
of the football games, there re
mains a deep interest in Stanford
and football. It is for the Stanford
student to decide whether his
school will become famous or in
famous.

FJditor, the Daily:
I recently had the displeasure
of being given a copy of your col
lege newspaper in which you en
dorsed Senator John Fitzgerald
Kennedy for president of our
Republic. I was deeply shocked
to see you support this man whom
your foundersâ€”those great Prot
estants, Jane and Leland Stan
ford, could never accept if they
i were now living. You should not
attempt to compete with the radi
calism which is rampant on the
campus of your sister University
in Berkeley. Remember, your ex
istence is due to a great fortune
j made in the spirit of free enter
j prise.
I If Senator Kennedy were clec-
I ted, the results would be tragic
! for your generation as this ap
! peaser would sell our beloved na-
J tion down the river to the col
' lectivists. I recently had the honor
I to work on arrangements for the
' Republican National Convention,
I during which time I talked with
i Richard M. Nixon. Though his
j public statements are neccesarily
' sometimes too internationalist in
j character, his heart lies with true
: American patriotism.
I hope that you. sir, will take
the trouble to read some good,
sound conservative literature to
counter the leftist dribble which
your professors assign you. Please
remember your responsibilities to
thousands of young readers with
| impressionable minds. Please get
I back on the path of thought which
j will aid our majestic nation .in
j its struggle 1o the death with
atheistic Communism!
