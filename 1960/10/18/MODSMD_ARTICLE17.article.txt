## Year of Originality 
### 
This is "the year of originality
for Ram's Head," according to
Tim Laddish, president of the stu
dent-run dramatic group.
"The real principle of Ram's
Head is to get student-written ma
terial and provide a chance for
original plays to be produced,"
Laddish continued. To fulfill this
policy, Ram's Head is currently
looking for three original, stu
dent-written one-act plays to be
presented winter quarter.
The plays can be of any type,
serious or comic, and will he se
lected at the end ol' this quarter.
Laddish has asked that all pros
pective playwrights with a suit
able one-act, either already writ
ten or in idea form, contact him
at the Ham's Head office this
week.
Directors are also needed for
the one-acts, and persons inter
ested are likewise asked to con
tact him.
Laddish also said that this
year's Spring Show may be an
original musical. This would give
Ram's Head an opportunity to
really show what it can do with
out being forced to suffer com
parisons which inevitably arise
when a well-known Broadway
musical is done.
The directors would be able to
work with more freedom, and the
audience would not enter Memo
rial Auditorium with precon
ceived ideas. And with an origi
nal show it is hoped that more
of (lie leads might ho drawn from
campus. Ham's Head is not a pro
fessional group and it should not
I*- expected to produce profession

ally-written shows.
Along with emphasizing origi
nal material this year, Ram's
Head is concentrating on attract
ing new people interested in any
and all phases of the theater.
The core of the entirely student
run group is the Ram's Head
Board whose membership is de
termined by participation in a
certain number of Ram's Head
shows, usually three.
Last year was a big build-up for
Ram's Head, Laddish said, on
campus as well as in the Palo
Alto-Peninsula area. "Kismet,"
last year's Spring Show, was held
over due to audience demand, an
unprecedented occurrence in
Ram's Head history.
Concentrating on producing
more tightly-knit, polished shows
hist year, Ram's Head took a
giant step toward proving it could
turn out quality musicals. Au
tumn quarter the group "put Big
Game hack into Gaieties," a pol
icy which will be followed again
this year.
Looking ahead, Laddish said
that Ram's Head will try to keep
up the overall quality of last
year's shows while concentrating
on original material in the future.
The budgets for the shows usu
ally run about $5000 with pro
ceeds going into the Ram's Head
sponsored scholarship fund for a
speech and drama major. Other
profits go into the Dramatic Im
provement Fund. Good-sized casts
are always needed; Gaieties this
year has about 50 singers, danc
ers and actors and another 50
working on crews.

Ram's Head an opportunity to
really show what it can do with
out being forced to suffer com

when a well-known Broadway
musical is done.
The directors would be able to
work with more freedom, and the
audience would not enter Memo
rial Auditorium with precon
ceived ideas. And with an origi

of (lie leads might ho drawn from

ally-written shows.
Along with emphasizing origi
nal material this year, Ram's
Head is concentrating on attract
ing new people interested in any
and all phases of the theater.
The core of the entirely student
run group is the Ram's Head
Board whose membership is de
termined by participation in a
certain number of Ram's Head
shows, usually three.
Last year was a big build-up for
Ram's Head, Laddish said, on
campus as well as in the Palo
Alto-Peninsula area. "Kismet,"
last year's Spring Show, was held
over due to audience demand, an
unprecedented occurrence in
Ram's Head history.
Concentrating on producing
more tightly-knit, polished shows
hist year, Ram's Head took a
giant step toward proving it could
turn out quality musicals. Au
tumn quarter the group "put Big
Game hack into Gaieties," a pol
icy which will be followed again
this year.
Looking ahead, Laddish said
that Ram's Head will try to keep
up the overall quality of last
year's shows while concentrating
on original material in the future.
The budgets for the shows usu
ally run about $5000 with pro
ceeds going into the Ram's Head
sponsored scholarship fund for a
speech and drama major. Other
profits go into the Dramatic Im
provement Fund. Good-sized casts
are always needed; Gaieties this
year has about 50 singers, danc
ers and actors and another 50
working on crews.
This is "the year of originality
for Ram's Head," according to
Tim Laddish, president of the stu
dent-run dramatic group.
"The real principle of Ram's
Head is to get student-written ma
terial and provide a chance for
original plays to be produced,"
Laddish continued. To fulfill this
policy, Ram's Head is currently
looking for three original, stu
dent-written one-act plays to be
presented winter quarter.
The plays can be of any type,
serious or comic, and will he se
lected at the end ol' this quarter.
Laddish has asked that all pros
pective playwrights with a suit
able one-act, either already writ
ten or in idea form, contact him
at the Ham's Head office this
week.
Directors are also needed for
the one-acts, and persons inter
