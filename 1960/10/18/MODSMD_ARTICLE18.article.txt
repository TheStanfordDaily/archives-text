# U.S. Hindering Growth Of Backward Countries
## 
### MICHAEL TOBRINER IIR Political Analyst 
The objective of current United
Slates foreign policy is the neu
tralization and ultimate removal
of the Russian Communist threat
to the physical security of Amer
ican society, ft is true indeed that
Soviet Communism poses a threat
to American security, but it is
also true that the removal of that
threat will not insure physical
security to the United States.
For even if the Soviet threat is
removed, other ideological im
perialists will arise, and their
fruition will constitute a contin
uing and inescapable challenge to
the physical security of the United
States. These are now
beginning to germinate among
the vast masses in the world's
underdeveloped nations.
These nations are possessed of
boundless will and endless deter
mination to end not only their
; economic hut also their political,
cultural and ideological backward
ness. Endowed with vast expanses
of geographical territory, rich, un
tapped mineral and agricultural
resources, and huge, burgeoning
populations; equipped with dy
! namic, devoted, skillful leaders
j and exciting new forms of tradi
! tional political dogmas; and slow
ly acquiring technical skill and
economic sophistication, these
countries will eventually emerge
as viable, vigorous modern so
cieties.
As these nations near maturity,
various internal pressures will
force many of them to seek to
extend their influence beyond
their borders. Their huge popu
lations will attempt to flow out
into less densely populated areas.
Their need for scarce raw ma
terials and for markets for their
exports will induce them to ex
tend their economic influence.
Many of these nations' political
dogmas will hear the ecumenical
pretensions of religious gospels
and will drive their espousers to
attempt to proselytize the world's
unbelievers. Infused with person
al ambition and missionary zeal,
many of the leaders of these new
societies will urge their peoples
onward in the extension of their
political and economic authority.
Most important, these coun
tries' nationalism, their ..sense of
pride, and their desire to prove
their vigor and vitality will assert
themselves in expansionist ten
dencies. Once they acquire, as
they surely will, missiles, bombs,
rockets and the other accoutre
ments of modern military estab
lishments, these new imperialists
will constitute a serious and con
stant threat to the security not
only of their neighbors but of the
entire world. And if it is unlikely
that all of these new societies will
be belligerently imperialistic, it
is even more unlikely that none
of them will be.

i Just as the Soviets do now,
I these new nations will issue their
challenge not simply to the world
in general, hut to the United
States in particular. Because
America enjoys the world's high
est standard of living, she serves
as a measuring stick for other
struggling economies. It is her
performance they strive to match.
Their achievements are measured
against hers, and their ultimate
objective is to have what she lias.
Even though she strip herself
j of the faintest vestige of imperial-
I ism, even though she extended a
I friendly, helping hand, as long as
she remains the universal byword
1 for prosperity and plenty, Amer
j iea will be the target of them that
! have not.
America symbolizes not only
! economic prosperity but also the
! status quo. Her interest appears
!to lie in a static world, undis
! rupted by sudden or violent
; change*and solidify the present
equilibrium. Apparently she pines
I for permanence and stability.
In projecting such an image the
! United States appears to be a
i major obstacle to the development
1 of the backward countries. For it
is only logical that since America
apparently opposes change and
i since the development of the re
-1 tarded countries will effect broad,
; fundamental changes, then Amer
' ica must oppose the development
! of the backward countries.
But to appear to oppose the de
velopnient of these countries is
to invite their bitterest enmity.
Because their progress is un
speakably dear to them, he who
challenges their right to it makes
the United States appears inimic
tlie United Statts appears inimic
able to the advance of these coun
tries, she cannot hope to avoid
their intense hostility.
