A special commit tee was
formed recently by the student
council of San Jose State College
to determine if racial discrimina
! tion has become a factor in the
I college's admission policy. *
As soon as the committee was
! established, the San Jose State ad
ministration refused its coopera
tion to the investigation, and the
! student council is now faced with
; the problem of whether or not
to discontinue the embattled com
mittee.
Action by the council in form
ing the committee was prompted
! by Ihe case of St. John Dixon, a
'Negro student who was expelled
I from Alabama State College for
I participating in "sit-in" demon
strations and who was subse
quently refused admission to San
Jose State.
According 1o the story, Dixon.
; after being expelled from Ala
bama State, was informed by a
I Baptist minister that CORE (Con
j gress of Racial Equality) was of
fering financial aid to further the
education of one of the nine stu
dents expelled.
Through the CORE offer and
with the cooperation of two SJS
professors, Dixon was brought lo
| California. The professors said
later that they acted under an
assurance from the vice president
of the college that regulations
prohibiting late admissions would
be waived. The vice president has
denied that he gave such an as
j surance.
Long after the admissions dead
line had passed, Dixon applied
and was turned down on the basis
of a late application. The admin
istration decided that the circum
stances of Dixon's case did not
entitle him to preferential treat
ment. Furthermore, he had re
! ceived a dishonorable discharge
from Alabama State, and priority
on exceptions lo the honorable
discharge rule goes to Cali
fornians.
In view of the rules, the case
was cut and dried: the applicant
had failed to follow regulations
by which all must abide. Yet
Dixon's case led to an interesting
I discovery.
At the request of five SJS pro
fessors, an investigation was un
dertaken by State Attorney Gen

eral Stanley Mosk who confirmed
the existence of a "gentlemen's
agreement" between state college
presidents to ban students ex
pelled from Southern colleges fori
participating in civil rights dem
onstrations.
Giving iiis reason for pursuing!
the matter, Mosk said that the
basic issue at stake is not preju-'
dice but whether the racially
prejudiced states of the deep i
South can be allowed to deter
mine policy for the rest of thoi
country.
Dixon has indicated that he will j
seek admission to SJS for spring
semester. In view of the contro
versy he has stirred up, it will i
come as no surprise if he is ad
mitted.

In an effort to increase interest!
in student government, a move
ment is getting underway at the
University of Minnesota to or
ganize campus political parties.
Such parties existed there for
many years but were abolished in
1956 after they became enmeshed
in rivalry between fraternity men
and independents. Campus lead-1
ers are now expressing some hope
that they can be organized along
more responsible lines with two
dr three parties representing dis-1
tinct differences in political
thought.
The attempt is admirable, but
how long parties could remain
outside traditional campus rival
ries and splils is in question. As
on (be national scene, special in
terest is the basis of politics and
any party that is not so oriented
will lack the energy and drive to
promote its ideas.

outside traditional campus rival
ries and splils is in question. As
on (be national scene, special in
terest is the basis of politics and
any party that is not so oriented
will lack the energy and drive to
promote its ideas.
A special commit tee was
formed recently by the student
council of San Jose State College
to determine if racial discrimina
! tion has become a factor in the
I college's admission policy. *
As soon as the committee was
! established, the San Jose State ad
ministration refused its coopera
tion to the investigation, and the
! student council is now faced with
; the problem of whether or not
to discontinue the embattled com
mittee.
Action by the council in form
ing the committee was prompted
! by Ihe case of St. John Dixon, a
'Negro student who was expelled
I from Alabama State College for
I participating in "sit-in" demon
strations and who was subse
quently refused admission to San
Jose State.
According 1o the story, Dixon.
; after being expelled from Ala
bama State, was informed by a
I Baptist minister that CORE (Con
j gress of Racial Equality) was of
fering financial aid to further the
education of one of the nine stu
dents expelled.
Through the CORE offer and
with the cooperation of two SJS
professors, Dixon was brought lo
| California. The professors said
later that they acted under an
assurance from the vice president
of the college that regulations
prohibiting late admissions would
be waived. The vice president has
denied that he gave such an as
j surance.
Long after the admissions dead
line had passed, Dixon applied
and was turned down on the basis
of a late application. The admin
istration decided that the circum
stances of Dixon's case did not
entitle him to preferential treat
ment. Furthermore, he had re
! ceived a dishonorable discharge
from Alabama State, and priority
on exceptions lo the honorable
discharge rule goes to Cali
fornians.
In view of the rules, the case
was cut and dried: the applicant
had failed to follow regulations
by which all must abide. Yet
Dixon's case led to an interesting
I discovery.
At the request of five SJS pro
fessors, an investigation was un
dertaken by State Attorney Gen

eral Stanley Mosk who confirmed
the existence of a "gentlemen's
agreement" between state college
presidents to ban students ex
pelled from Southern colleges fori
participating in civil rights dem
onstrations.
Giving iiis reason for pursuing!
the matter, Mosk said that the
basic issue at stake is not preju-'
dice but whether the racially
prejudiced states of the deep i
South can be allowed to deter
mine policy for the rest of thoi
country.
Dixon has indicated that he will j
seek admission to SJS for spring
semester. In view of the contro
versy he has stirred up, it will i
come as no surprise if he is ad
mitted.
