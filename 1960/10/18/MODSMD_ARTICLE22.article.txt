# PROFILES OF THE PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS
## John Kennedy: His Background Works Both For and Against Him 
### 
United Press Internationa!
If Sen. John F. Kennedy has
paused during his campaign for
the presidency to ponder his po
litical assets and liabilities, he
must have found the same entries
recurring on both sides of the bal
ance sheet. '
His age . . . his religion ... his
family background ... his educa
tion . . . his pretty wife.
SOME VOTERS evidently were
attracted, and others repelled, by
each of these ingredients in the
Kennedy personality.
At 43, Kennedy is one of the
youngest men ever to run for the
nation's highest office. Some

Americans felt that his youth
would insure a fresh, dynamic
approach to national problems.
Others equated it with lack of
experience.
He is the first Roman Catholic
to be nominated for the presi
dency since 1928, and his religion
has made him the target of bitter
attacks from some quarters.
BUT POLITICIANS said he
would gain as well as lose votes
because of his church affiliation.
The vast wealth and political
prominence of the Boston Irish
clan from which he sprang also
seemed to help and hurt him at
the same time.
ON THE ONE hand, his fam-
I ily background provided him with
money and a great many attrac
tive, hard-working relatives to as
sist with his campaigning.
On the other hand, some voters
resent his being the son of a mul
! ti-millionaire — particularly when
the multi-millionaire happens to
j be Joseph P. Kennedy, a contro
versial political figure in his own
right.
Kennedy's cultured accent, his
ability to quote easily from po
etry and the classics, has been a
constant reminder that he was a
product of Choate and Harvard, a
certified intellectual who had won
critical acclaim with two scholar
ly books.
AGAIN, these credentials have
become in the minds of some vot
ers a testimony to his brain
power, while to others they make
him suspect as an "egghead."
Even chic and beautiful Jacque
line Kennedy, whom he married
in 1953, became a campaign issue.
I There are those who think she
j would make the loveliest and
| most gracious first lady any na
tion could want.

[ say she spends too much on her
j clothes.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy
brought into his campaign two
other attributes which were un
; deniably assets.
One was courage. He demon
strated it in World War II when
I he was cited by the Navy for he-
I roism in saving his crew after a
I PT boat under his command was
; sliced in two by a Japanese de
stroyer in ' s .e Pacific.
HE DEMONSTRATED it oil
several notable occasions during
I his 13 years' service in Congress
—for example, when he voted
against a veterans' pension bill
and criticized the American Le
gion for pushing it.
He also showed his courage dur
ing the six months he spent in
hospitals in 1954 and 1955, risk
ing death in extremely serious op
erations in order to correct a back
I injury that he had suffered in
j the war.
The other asset was political
skill.
PERHAPS he inherited it from
his grandfathers, both of whom
! were successful Boston politi
; eians. Perhaps he lear ned it the
| hard way, in getting elected three
, times to the U.S. House of Repre
sentatives and twice to the Sen
ate.
When Adlai E. Stevenson threw
l the vice presidential nomination
up for grabs at the 1956 Demo
cratic convention, Kennedy made
a strong bid for it. Although he
lost by a hair, he became over
night a well-known national fig
ure.
He began campaigning for the
1960 Democratic presidential nom
ination almost as soon as the 1956
elections were over, and he had
it sewed up, before the convention
met in Los Angeles in July, by
winning every primary he en
tered.
BOTH IN his masterly, intui
tive sense of politics, and in some
of the other traits of his person
ality, Kennedy reminded some
folks of the late Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
He gladly accepted this identi
fication with FDR, and it has be
come one of the pronounced fea
tures of his campaign.

On the other hand, some voters
resent his being the son of a mul
! ti-millionaire — particularly when
the multi-millionaire happens to
j be Joseph P. Kennedy, a contro
versial political figure in his own
right.
Kennedy's cultured accent, his
ability to quote easily from po
etry and the classics, has been a
constant reminder that he was a
product of Choate and Harvard, a
certified intellectual who had won
critical acclaim with two scholar
ly books.
AGAIN, these credentials have
become in the minds of some vot
ers a testimony to his brain
power, while to others they make
him suspect as an "egghead."
Even chic and beautiful Jacque

in 1953, became a campaign issue.
I There are those who think she
j would make the loveliest and

[ say she spends too much on her
j clothes.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy
brought into his campaign two
other attributes which were un
; deniably assets.
One was courage. He demon
strated it in World War II when
I he was cited by the Navy for he-
I roism in saving his crew after a
I PT boat under his command was
; sliced in two by a Japanese de
stroyer in ' s .e Pacific.
HE DEMONSTRATED it oil
several notable occasions during
I his 13 years' service in Congress
—for example, when he voted
against a veterans' pension bill
and criticized the American Le
gion for pushing it.
He also showed his courage dur
ing the six months he spent in
hospitals in 1954 and 1955, risk
ing death in extremely serious op
erations in order to correct a back
I injury that he had suffered in
j the war.
The other asset was political
skill.
PERHAPS he inherited it from
his grandfathers, both of whom
! were successful Boston politi
; eians. Perhaps he lear ned it the
| hard way, in getting elected three
, times to the U.S. House of Repre
sentatives and twice to the Sen
ate.
When Adlai E. Stevenson threw
l the vice presidential nomination
up for grabs at the 1956 Demo
cratic convention, Kennedy made
a strong bid for it. Although he
lost by a hair, he became over
night a well-known national fig
ure.
He began campaigning for the
1960 Democratic presidential nom
ination almost as soon as the 1956
elections were over, and he had
it sewed up, before the convention
met in Los Angeles in July, by
winning every primary he en
tered.
BOTH IN his masterly, intui
tive sense of politics, and in some
of the other traits of his person
ality, Kennedy reminded some
folks of the late Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
He gladly accepted this identi
fication with FDR, and it has be
come one of the pronounced fea
tures of his campaign.

If Sen. John F. Kennedy has
paused during his campaign for
the presidency to ponder his po
litical assets and liabilities, he
must have found the same entries
recurring on both sides of the bal
ance sheet. '
His age . . . his religion ... his
family background ... his educa
tion . . . his pretty wife.
SOME VOTERS evidently were
attracted, and others repelled, by
each of these ingredients in the
Kennedy personality.
At 43, Kennedy is one of the
youngest men ever to run for the
nation's highest office. Some

Americans felt that his youth
would insure a fresh, dynamic
approach to national problems.
Others equated it with lack of
experience.
He is the first Roman Catholic
to be nominated for the presi
dency since 1928, and his religion
has made him the target of bitter
attacks from some quarters.
BUT POLITICIANS said he
would gain as well as lose votes
because of his church affiliation.

prominence of the Boston Irish
clan from which he sprang also
seemed to help and hurt him at

ing death in extremely serious op

When Adlai E. Stevenson threw

up for grabs at the 1956 Demo

lost by a hair, he became over
night a well-known national fig

He began campaigning for the
1960 Democratic presidential nom

elections were over, and he had
it sewed up, before the convention
met in Los Angeles in July, by
winning every primary he en
tered.

If Sen. John F. Kennedy has
paused during his campaign for
the presidency to ponder his po
litical assets and liabilities, he
must have found the same entries
recurring on both sides of the bal
ance sheet. '
His age . . . his religion ... his
family background ... his educa
tion . . . his pretty wife.
SOME VOTERS evidently were
attracted, and others repelled, by
each of these ingredients in the
Kennedy personality.
At 43, Kennedy is one of the
youngest men ever to run for the
nation's highest office. Some

Americans felt that his youth
would insure a fresh, dynamic
approach to national problems.
Others equated it with lack of
experience.
He is the first Roman Catholic
to be nominated for the presi
dency since 1928, and his religion
has made him the target of bitter
attacks from some quarters.
BUT POLITICIANS said he
would gain as well as lose votes
because of his church affiliation.
The vast wealth and political
prominence of the Boston Irish
clan from which he sprang also
seemed to help and hurt him at
the same time.
ON THE ONE hand, his fam-
I ily background provided him with
money and a great many attrac
tive, hard-working relatives to as
sist with his campaigning.
On the other hand, some voters
resent his being the son of a mul
! ti-millionaire — particularly when
the multi-millionaire happens to
j be Joseph P. Kennedy, a contro
versial political figure in his own
right.
Kennedy's cultured accent, his
ability to quote easily from po
etry and the classics, has been a
constant reminder that he was a
product of Choate and Harvard, a
certified intellectual who had won
critical acclaim with two scholar
ly books.
AGAIN, these credentials have
become in the minds of some vot
ers a testimony to his brain
power, while to others they make
him suspect as an "egghead."
Even chic and beautiful Jacque
line Kennedy, whom he married
in 1953, became a campaign issue.
I There are those who think she
j would make the loveliest and
| most gracious first lady any na
tion could want.

[ say she spends too much on her
j clothes.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy
brought into his campaign two
other attributes which were un
; deniably assets.
