# Richard Nixon: Friends, Foes Equally Ardent; All Attempt to Pinpoint Complex Personality
## 
### 
United Press International
During his 13 years of public
service, Richard Millions Nixon
has been the subject of five full
length biographies, hundreds of
newspaper and magazine pieces,
and millions of heated private
conversat ions.
All have sought to analyze his
complex personality, to pinpoint
the kind of man he "really" is.
The descriptions vary so widely
it is sometimes hard to realize
they are all being applied to the
same human being.
NIXON has been depicted as
shy and introverted . . . and as
a born ham actor. He has been
labeled "cold, impersonal, calcu
lating, opportunistic." He has
also been found "warm, friendly,
practical, dedicated."
One famous Washington cor
respondent (Richard L. Strout of
the Christian Science Monitor)
sees him as "one of the most bril
liant and intellectually gifted fig
ures that American politics has
produced in half a century."
ANOTHER (columnist Walter
Lippmann) regards him as a
ruthless partisan who "does not
have within his conscience those
scruples which the country has
the right to expect in the Presi
dent of the United States."

Nixon has been winning ardent
friends and equally ardent ene
mies ever since 1946, when he
answered a newspaper advertise.-
ment seeking a Republican candi
date for Congress in his home
district of Southern California.
Nixon was a 33-year-old lawyer,
who had just gotten out of the
Navy after World War II service
in the Pacific. His Democratic op
ponent was veteran Congressman
Jerry Voorhis.
Nixon defeated Voorhis in a
slugging campaign, and went to
Washington where he won na
tional attention, during his fresh
man term in the House, by play
ing a leading investigative role in
the Hiss-Chambers case.
IN 1950, lie ran against Rep.
Helen Gahagan Douglas for the
Senate. His political tactics in
that campaign have been the sub
ject of controversy ever since:
Admirers described them as vig
orous; critics called them vicious.
At any rate, they were successful,
and Nixon moved up to the Sen
ate at the age of 37.
Two years later, he was tapped
to be Dwight D. Eisenhower's
running mate. A campaign furor
arose over an $18,235 "expense
fund" which had been raised for
him by some wealthy California
supporters, and for several days

Nixons budding political career
seemed to hang in the balance,
with Eisenhower and other OOP
leaders debating whether to drop
him from the ticket.
NIXON decided the question
for them with a nationwide
broadcast in which lie gave a de
tailed account of his personal fi
nances.
Some critics still haven't for
given Nixon for what they call
the "soap opera" flavor of that
broadcast, but others thought it
was tremendous, and Nixon
stayed on the ticket.
THE VICE PRESIDENCY once
was considered the graveyard of
political ambitions, but with Ei
senhower's blessing, Nixon raised
it to a new level of importance.
Throughout the eight-year Ei
senhower administration, Nixon
has functioned as a "working
partner" of the chief executive,
sitting in on mcelings of the cabi
net and National Security Coun
cil, traveling almost 160,000 miles
abroad as the President's repre
sentative on good will visits to 54
countries, and generally playing
a larger part in administration
policy councils than any vice
president has ever done before.
HIS ROLE as "understudy" to
the President was dramatized on
three occasions when Eisenhower

illnesses pushed him close to the
point of becoming "acting Presi
dent."
Nixon, now 17. won the 19(50
GOP presidential nomination
without a serious contest, and
has built his campaign around
the theme that his "experience" in
high government councils has
fitted him to deal more adequate
ly than his opponent with Russia
and national problems.

During his 13 years of public
service, Richard Millions Nixon
has been the subject of five full
length biographies, hundreds of
newspaper and magazine pieces,
and millions of heated private
conversat ions.
All have sought to analyze his
complex personality, to pinpoint
the kind of man he "really" is.
The descriptions vary so widely
it is sometimes hard to realize
they are all being applied to the
same human being.
NIXON has been depicted as
shy and introverted . . . and as
a born ham actor. He has been
labeled "cold, impersonal, calcu
lating, opportunistic." He has
also been found "warm, friendly,
practical, dedicated."
One famous Washington cor
respondent (Richard L. Strout of
the Christian Science Monitor)
sees him as "one of the most bril
liant and intellectually gifted fig
ures that American politics has
produced in half a century."
ANOTHER (columnist Walter
Lippmann) regards him as a
ruthless partisan who "does not
have within his conscience those
scruples which the country has
the right to expect in the Presi
dent of the United States."

Nixon has been winning ardent
friends and equally ardent ene
mies ever since 1946, when he
answered a newspaper advertise.-
ment seeking a Republican candi
date for Congress in his home
district of Southern California.
Nixon was a 33-year-old lawyer,
who had just gotten out of the
Navy after World War II service
in the Pacific. His Democratic op
ponent was veteran Congressman
Jerry Voorhis.
Nixon defeated Voorhis in a
slugging campaign, and went to
Washington where he won na
tional attention, during his fresh
man term in the House, by play
ing a leading investigative role in
the Hiss-Chambers case.
IN 1950, lie ran against Rep.
Helen Gahagan Douglas for the
Senate. His political tactics in
that campaign have been the sub
ject of controversy ever since:
Admirers described them as vig
orous; critics called them vicious.
At any rate, they were successful,
and Nixon moved up to the Sen
ate at the age of 37.
Two years later, he was tapped
to be Dwight D. Eisenhower's
running mate. A campaign furor
arose over an $18,235 "expense
fund" which had been raised for
him by some wealthy California
supporters, and for several days

Nixons budding political career
seemed to hang in the balance,
with Eisenhower and other OOP
leaders debating whether to drop
him from the ticket.
NIXON decided the question
for them with a nationwide
broadcast in which lie gave a de
tailed account of his personal fi
nances.
Some critics still haven't for
given Nixon for what they call
the "soap opera" flavor of that
broadcast, but others thought it
was tremendous, and Nixon
stayed on the ticket.
THE VICE PRESIDENCY once
was considered the graveyard of
political ambitions, but with Ei
senhower's blessing, Nixon raised
it to a new level of importance.
Throughout the eight-year Ei
senhower administration, Nixon
has functioned as a "working
partner" of the chief executive,
sitting in on mcelings of the cabi
net and National Security Coun
cil, traveling almost 160,000 miles
abroad as the President's repre
sentative on good will visits to 54
countries, and generally playing
a larger part in administration
policy councils than any vice
president has ever done before.

the President was dramatized on
three occasions when Eisenhower

illnesses pushed him close to the
point of becoming "acting Presi
dent."
Nixon, now 17. won the 19(50

United Press International
During his 13 years of public
service, Richard Millions Nixon
has been the subject of five full
length biographies, hundreds of
newspaper and magazine pieces,
and millions of heated private
conversat ions.
All have sought to analyze his
complex personality, to pinpoint
the kind of man he "really" is.
The descriptions vary so widely
it is sometimes hard to realize
they are all being applied to the
same human being.
NIXON has been depicted as
shy and introverted . . . and as
a born ham actor. He has been
labeled "cold, impersonal, calcu
lating, opportunistic." He has
also been found "warm, friendly,
practical, dedicated."
One famous Washington cor
respondent (Richard L. Strout of
the Christian Science Monitor)
sees him as "one of the most bril
liant and intellectually gifted fig
ures that American politics has
produced in half a century."
ANOTHER (columnist Walter
Lippmann) regards him as a
ruthless partisan who "does not
have within his conscience those
scruples which the country has
the right to expect in the Presi
dent of the United States."

Nixon has been winning ardent
friends and equally ardent ene
mies ever since 1946, when he
answered a newspaper advertise.-
ment seeking a Republican candi
date for Congress in his home
district of Southern California.
Nixon was a 33-year-old lawyer,
who had just gotten out of the
Navy after World War II service
in the Pacific. His Democratic op
ponent was veteran Congressman
Jerry Voorhis.
Nixon defeated Voorhis in a
slugging campaign, and went to
Washington where he won na
tional attention, during his fresh
man term in the House, by play
ing a leading investigative role in
the Hiss-Chambers case.
IN 1950, lie ran against Rep.
Helen Gahagan Douglas for the
Senate. His political tactics in
that campaign have been the sub
ject of controversy ever since:
Admirers described them as vig
orous; critics called them vicious.
At any rate, they were successful,
and Nixon moved up to the Sen
ate at the age of 37.
Two years later, he was tapped
to be Dwight D. Eisenhower's
running mate. A campaign furor
arose over an $18,235 "expense
fund" which had been raised for
him by some wealthy California
supporters, and for several days

Nixons budding political career
seemed to hang in the balance,
with Eisenhower and other OOP
leaders debating whether to drop
him from the ticket.
NIXON decided the question
for them with a nationwide
broadcast in which lie gave a de
tailed account of his personal fi
nances.
Some critics still haven't for
given Nixon for what they call
the "soap opera" flavor of that
broadcast, but others thought it
was tremendous, and Nixon
stayed on the ticket.
THE VICE PRESIDENCY once
was considered the graveyard of
political ambitions, but with Ei
senhower's blessing, Nixon raised
it to a new level of importance.
Throughout the eight-year Ei
senhower administration, Nixon
has functioned as a "working
partner" of the chief executive,
sitting in on mcelings of the cabi
net and National Security Coun
cil, traveling almost 160,000 miles
abroad as the President's repre
sentative on good will visits to 54
countries, and generally playing
a larger part in administration
policy councils than any vice
president has ever done before.
