# Mice Flight Successful; More Tests to Be Tried

('APR CANAVERAL (UPI >
An Air Force scientist yes
terday callod a 5.000-mile filght
by three "space mice" aboard an
Alias missile "highly successful,"
and said a man probably could
have survived the rugged test.
Dr. Hans Clamann, chief of the
Department of Space Medicine for
the Air Force School of Medicine
i AFSM i at Bro ok s Air Force
Base. Tex., also indicated more
such tests will lie attempted as
the time nears for the first U.S.
manned space flights.
We're training a lot of animals
right now for space assignments,"
said Clamann. "We have rats,
mice, guinea pigs, monkeys, cats,
dogs and rabbits, and we'll take
part anytime anyone wants us to."
Clamann indicated he was quite

pleased by the performance of
"space mice" Sally, Amy and Moe,
who cavorted in a large gray box
on a table as the scientist ex
plained details of their 30-minute
journey into space in the noscj
of an Atlas intercontinental mis
sile last Thursday.
"The mice stood up quite well,"
he c o mmente d. When asked
whether he thought a man could
have survived the same flight of
high gravity force, weightless
ness, exposure to space radiations
and a blazing return into the at
mosphere, Clamann said "Yes, 1
guess he could."
America's seven "Project Mer
cury" Astronauts are scheduled
to take intercontinental •r a ng e
flights and then trips into earth
orbits starting next year in spe
cially-built capsules atop Atlas
missiles.
Clamann said information from
the mouse test would be made
available to Project Mercury offi
cials of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, and
would be used in future tests in
volving animals.
He confirmed the School of Avi
ation Medicine presently is train
ing a small monkey for a flight
into orbit aboard a Discoverer
satellite from Vandenberg Air
Force Base, Calif., in late Novem
ber or early December. An at
tempt will be made to recover
the capsule.
Clamann said it would take "up
to a year" to learn all that scien
tists wanted to know about how
the mice stood up under the trip
650 nautical miles into space.
"But we should have some pre
liminary ideas in about a month,"
he added.

have survived the rugged test.
Dr. Hans Clamann, chief of the
Department of Space Medicine for
the Air Force School of Medicine
i AFSM i at Bro ok s Air Force
Base. Tex., also indicated more
such tests will lie attempted as
the time nears for the first U.S.
manned space flights.
We're training a lot of animals
right now for space assignments,"
said Clamann. "We have rats,
mice, guinea pigs, monkeys, cats,
dogs and rabbits, and we'll take
part anytime anyone wants us to."
Clamann indicated he was quite

pleased by the performance of
"space mice" Sally, Amy and Moe,
who cavorted in a large gray box
on a table as the scientist ex
plained details of their 30-minute
journey into space in the noscj
of an Atlas intercontinental mis
sile last Thursday.
"The mice stood up quite well,"
he c o mmente d. When asked
whether he thought a man could
have survived the same flight of
high gravity force, weightless
ness, exposure to space radiations
and a blazing return into the at
mosphere, Clamann said "Yes, 1
guess he could."
America's seven "Project Mer
cury" Astronauts are scheduled
to take intercontinental •r a ng e
flights and then trips into earth
orbits starting next year in spe
cially-built capsules atop Atlas
missiles.
Clamann said information from
the mouse test would be made
available to Project Mercury offi
cials of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, and
would be used in future tests in
volving animals.
He confirmed the School of Avi
ation Medicine presently is train
ing a small monkey for a flight
into orbit aboard a Discoverer
satellite from Vandenberg Air
Force Base, Calif., in late Novem
ber or early December. An at
tempt will be made to recover
the capsule.
Clamann said it would take "up
to a year" to learn all that scien
tists wanted to know about how
the mice stood up under the trip
650 nautical miles into space.
"But we should have some pre
liminary ideas in about a month,"
he added.
