# Professor Lands At South Pole
## 
### 
One of the first two U.S. scien
tists to arrive last week at Mc-
Murdo Sound near the South Pole
was Stanford Prof. Donald E.
Wohlschlag.
Arrival of the two men marks
the start of the 1 {)(»1 U.S. Antarc
tic Research Program, a National
Science Foundation spokesman
said yesterday. NSF is the ad
ministering agency for the pro
gram.
They landed just six days after
the first plane arrived, he said,
"early birds" of the commencing
Antarctic summer.
Wohlschlag is reported now to
be readying fish traps which will
be lowered through the 10-foot
thick sea ice. These figure in "eco
logical and physiological studies
of McMurdo Sound marine ani
mals" being conducted by the Mc-
Murdo base's biological labora
tory.
The laboratory was established
by Wohlschlag two years ago,
and operates under his direction.
He will be joined later by five
Stanford graduate students: John
11. Dearborn of Cape Elizabeth,
Me.; Jack L. Littlepage of Chula
Vista; John S. Pearse of Chicago;
Karl E. Ricker of Nanaimo, 8.C.;
and Bruce L. Wing of San Diego.
Wohlschlag plans to return home
in six months.
The studies are supported by
a $69,715 NSF grant. Another
grant of $50,405 will go for sup
port of the laboratory.
One other Stanford investigator
also has received two grants for
ionospheric physics studies in the
Antarctic program. Prof. Robert
A. Helliwell was awarded $59,740
for "Geomagnetic latitude control
of VLF and ELF phenomena,"
$70,279 for "Continuation and ex
tension of VLF phenomena in the
Antarctic."
