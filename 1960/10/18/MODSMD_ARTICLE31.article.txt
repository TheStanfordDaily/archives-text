Tt was Iho lowest of tho low and everybody knew it. Wherever
you went for the first few hours after the game you felt it.
The band got into its formation after the game was over and
hurriedly marched tho quarter mile from tho Stadium over to the
dressing room. When they got there they waited around for the
team to come so they could play the fight song. But you could tell
that ihey really didn't want to play it.
Til 10 TWO OR THItNE hundred people who usually wait for
the team with th-e band after tho game is over had shrunk to 30 or
Id and even they didn't seem to care very much. They were the red
hots and die-hards, there out of force of habit more than anything
else.
Thov weren't laughing and shouting at each other tho way they

do after* a win and they weren't
excitedly going over the breaks
of the game and second guessing
the plays tho way they do after a
close loss. They weren't talking
about much of anything. They
wore just sort of there.
Some of them had avoided com
ing by staying in the Stadium and
getting into fights over San Jose's
light to tear down the north goal
posts. A couple of heads were
knocked, but everybody knew that
the goal posts must come down.
It was a futile struggle to keep
the visitors from rubbing in their
well-deserved win and it was
doomed to defeat.
NOBODY MUCH cared that a
bunch of eight-year-old kids were
busy ripping down the south goal
posts.
The San Jose players got to the
dressing room first. Joy, ecstasy

even, was written on their faces. They wore the only excited people
on campus and you just watched them and didn't really begrudge
them their happiness. You were just kind of jealous.
Just the Greatest'
"Oh, il's just Iho greatest thing ever," a San Jose assistant coach
said to a well-wisher. "I just don't know what to say."
TIIE BAN I) TRADE!) a few choice insults with the San Jose
team. But San Jose got the best of it. How do you insult a winner?
"Happy birthday, coach," one player yelled at Bob Titchenal,
ihe San Jose coach.
"My birthday isn't till Monday," the coach told some reporters.
"Rut 1 told them that this is what 1 wanted for a present."
"Happy birthday, coach," another player yelled. And then another.
"Happy birthday, coach."
7 Can't Explain It'
"I JUST CAN'T explain it," Jack Curtice said. The Stanford
coach was chewing on his usual after-game popsicle, while he talked
to reporters. "We couldn't even seem to walk out of the huddle. We
seemed tired before we started. I guess we were. I just can't explain
it." A lesser man would have cried and Curtice looked like he
wanted to.
One of the custodians in the BAC came out of the dressing room
with a stack of football shoes. He ran into a little kid running around
looking for autographs.
"Hey, mister," the kid said. "Can I have some of those shoes?"
The custodian stopped and looked at him for a minute. Then he
shrugged his shoulders and said, "Why not? You could probably
use them as well as we can."
STANFORD ISN'T TIIK Big 10. When your football team loses
five games in a row and it looks like it will probably lose five more
before Thanksgiving, you don't go out and hang the coach in effigy.
The small dummy hanging on the wire which stretches across the
street between the Cellar and the Bookstore seemed almost ludicrous
in the hard light of the deserted Sunday morning scene.
Those passers-by who saw the caricature gave a sort of weak
grin and walked on.
Some of the more curious hauled out the record hook and dis
covered that Stanford's only winless season was in 1917. And they
only played nine games then.
HI T MOST OF 'rill-; people didn't care. They'd come to the South
ern Cal game to see if some Stanford player might not make the
season worthwhile by murdering a McKeever. And they'd come to
the Oregon State game because Stanford might have a chance in
that one . . . but not really.
Then 80,000 people would go to the Big Game. Cal hasn't won a
game yet either and they might go into the Big Game winless too.
The only appropriate thing that could come out of a Big Game be
tween two hopeless losers is a scoreless tie.
