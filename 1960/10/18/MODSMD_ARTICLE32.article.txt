# HOUSTON, NEW YORK
## National League Votes Expansion to Ten Teams 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 17 (IIPI)
New York and Houston today
wore voted National Baseball
League franchises, effective in
1962, in the first expansion of
ihe circuit since 1900.
League owners, choosing be
tween "3 or 0' bidders, unani
mously and "enthusiastically" ac
eepted the two groups, both pre
viously among the founders of
the now defunct Continental
League.
IIOTII GKOITS must meet con
ditions to be determined, but
league president Warren Giles
said he did not believe the re
quirements would be "any ob
stacle whatsoever."
One of the prime problems for
Houston will be to obtain clear
ance from both the Houston Buffs
and the American Association to
bring major league baseball to
the area.
There will be no territorial in
demnifications involved in mov
ing into New York, which the
National League abandoned in
19.X, but ihe path to obtain entry
into Ihe city may be complicated.
(ill is said that any Ameri
can League member, including

the New York Yankees, could pre
vent entry of a National League
team into New York, since unani
mous consent of all 16 major
league clubs is required.
But he added that baseball com
missioner Frick has assured him
that he would support a move
for tiie National League to return
to New York.
Thus if the league were blocked
by the Yankees or any other team,
the National League could move
to amend the major league rule
covering territorial rights to ex
empt New York.
Til 10 I-10 A (ill 10 today unani
mously voted in favor of the re
port of its expansion committee,
recommending expansion of the
league to 10 teams in 1962 and
for study of further expansion in
four years However, the expan
sion provision specified that the
two new teams to be added first
come from the stillborn Confi
' nental League.
Giles said that "other prob
lems" concerning the entry of the
new teams, notably finances, play
ers. schedules and other "details,"
would be worked out.
