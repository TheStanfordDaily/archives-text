# FUMBLES HURT
## Papoose Gridders Tie Spartan Frosh, 14-14 Daily Sports 
### 
Stanford's freshman football
team, its game hurt considerably
by the loss of six first-half
fumbles, came back in the last
two periods to grind out a pair!
of touchdowns and tie the San
Jose State frosh, 14 to 14.
The highly regarded Papooses
seemed to be overoagor in their
ball-handling, but they showed
fine promise, especially in the
rushing of Tyco Fit/morris, who
carried tho ball 12 times for f*l
yards and a 7.6 average.
FROM THE FIRST quarter the
frosh found themselves in a hole
when San Jose scored after re
covering a fumble on the Stan
ford 25-yard line. The rest of the
half was spent with Stanford
fumbling and San Jose punting.
But the Papooses were not to
ho denied in the second half. After
recovering a third quarter oppo
sition bobble on the San Jose 30-
yard line, the freshmen covered
the distance for the score in six
plays with quarterback Steve
Thurlow passing the final seven
yards to split end Flip Wagner.
Thurlow to Frank Pattueci pro-,
vided a two-point: conversion and
the baby Cards led 8-7.
KAIiI.Y IN tho fourth quarter
tho invaders from South Santa
Clara County again took the lead,
covering ten yards to score after
blocking Jerry Cronin's punt.
Again tho Indians retaliated
this time with tho longest march
of the day. In scoring the final
marker of tho day, ihe Papooses
went SO yards in 1-1 plays.

The drive was initiated by a
powerful 20-yard punt return by
hard-running Mike Barnes, and

culminated with quarterback Jim
Norman's seven-yard scamper in
to the end zone.
TI-IK CONVERSION attempt
was blocked and the score re
mained deadlocked at 1 1-14. Nor
man, Fit/morris, and big Sieve
Arch were the big gainers in this
drive, in which GO of the 80 yards
were covered on the ground.
The frosh defense was solid,
once stopping San Jose when ihÂ°
Spartababes had a first and goal
on the Stanford eight-yard line.
Marv Harris. Frank Dubovsky.
Ruff Ahders, Kent Colber, "Irish"
Flanigan, and Nick Nicholas an
