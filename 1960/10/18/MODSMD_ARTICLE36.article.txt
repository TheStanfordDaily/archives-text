### CHUCK BSCHOFF 
Rich Klier outraced John North
way to the finish lino Friday
afternoon as the two led Stan
ford's cross country team to a
lopsided 21 to 39 victory over the
San Jose harriers. The Indians
blanketed the field as six Stanford
runners were among the first
eight places.
The victory was a fine team
effort for the Cards, who ran in
bunches for the most part, with
each man helping to set the pace
for his teammates. The most no
ticeable difference between the
Indians and the Spartans was
thai each Stanford man gave it
everything Tie had at the finish
of tiie three miles, closing in a
rush, and several of the Indians
nosed out San Jose runners at
the line.
KI.ICIt AND Northway fin
ished in the itmes of 15:57 and
15:58, respectively. There is no
real basis for comparison with
previous times for these runners,
as I lie exact course used had
never been used before. However,
il was thought before the race
# to be tougher than the three-mile
course which Northway ran in
Hi: 12 last week.
Finishing 34 seconds behind the

leaders were Ron Davis and Dan
Landers of San Jose. Robin Ruble,
Dave Boore. Bill Pratt and Frank
Wallace, in that order, preceded
the next Spartan, as they placed
fifth through eighth. Bruce John
son was 10th, ahead of last year's
high school mile champion Ben
Tucker, and Stanfordites Larry
Shafer, Ralph Weidner and Robin
Nowinski were 12th, 14th and
1 (>th, respectively.
JORDAN was especially pleased
wilh the showings by Boore and
Wallace, both of whom were just
recovering from colds. Me slated
that this group "can develop into
my best learn. These boys are not
interested in moral victories or
next year," he continued, refer
ring perhaps to the attitude on
other Farm teams.
For this stage in the season,
which is still relatively early, the

progress is very pleasing. Sev
eral of the five freshmen among
the top len are still expected to
show great improvement.
TIIK 1< 10 A I. T !â€¢; S T for this
youthful and spirited squad will
come next Saturday m or n in g
when they meet UCLA and I'SC
at Los Angeles. Both of these
schools have two outstanding run
ners who should provide a six
way race for first with Klier and
Northway. Since five runners
count in the scoring, it is likely
that the meet will be decided by
depth and team effort.
