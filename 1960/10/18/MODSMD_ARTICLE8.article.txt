### 
by ji nv seaborg
"On tho whole, the economic
progress of the United States is
the best of its entire history,"
Dr. Allen Wallis, executive vice
president of President Eisenhow
er's Committee on Price Stabiliz
ing for Economic Growth, de
clared yesterday in a lecture at
Cubberley Auditorium.
Wallis, former Stanford profes
sor and Dean of the University
of Chicago Business School, dis
cussed dangers of misinterpreta
tion of statistics concerning the
nation's economic growth.
He listed these as "treacheries
of timing, aberrations of aver
ages. vaguaries of valuation, de
ficiencies of data, and peculiari
ties of parameter."
DIXLARING that the Republi
cans could "win the numbers
game hands down," Wallis pro
vided statistics in different areas
of economics which showed a
greater increase in over-all eco
nomic growth during the seven
years of Eisenhower administra
tion than during Truman's seven
years.
He emphasized, however, that
other national conditions were
not equal during the two periods,
which affects in a sense the valid
ity of the figures.
INTRODUCED BY Ernest C.
Arbuckle, Dean of the Graduate
School of Business, Wallis set
forth ten requirements for a gov
ernment that wishes to maintain
economic growth:
1 Â» Maintenance of an orderly
government, 2> equality of oppor
tunity, 3> stability of income and
employment, price stability,
51 tax reform, 61 government en
couragement of competition, 7)
international trade, St elimination
of government r o a d I) 1 o c k s to
growth, 91 provision of public
services and facilities, 101 in
crease of certain types of expen
diture such as education and re
search.
WAI.I,is POINTED out that
the gross national product do
ponds upon the population and
the number of working-age people
in it. For this reason, "either can
didate will be able to point with
pride" to an increase in the GNP
if the economy "continues to rise
at the rate it is now."
