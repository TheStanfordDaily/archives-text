From lnited Press International
Both candidates for the White House slashed hard at each other
yesterday as pressure mounted in the presidential campaign, with
election rl;iy exactly three weeks away.
In Buffalo. Vice President Richard M. Nixon fired his heaviest
barrage yet against Sen. John F. Kennedy, accusing him of "glib

j double talk" on Quemoy and
Matsu that "would have made us
a sitting duck fox* the Commu
nists" if Kennedy were now presi
dent.
The Republican presidential
candidate began stepping up his
attack 011 Kennedy in three Con
necticut campaign speeches and
brought the assault to a climax
before some 25,000 cheering par
tisans packed into the Memoi'ial
Auditorium in Buffalo.
Sheriff B. John Tutuska said
another 10,00 people were stand-!
ing outside.
"Before he starts talking about
I new frontiers, we had better not
i talk about abandoning the fxon
| tiers of freedom we already have," j
| Nixon said in accelerating his
! criticism oxx the Quemoy-Matsu
j issue.
AKOUSING loud cheers, Nixon
accused Kenedy of "very danger- j
i ous immaturity in world affairs"
not only on the Formosa Strait
| matter but also in once having
suggested that President Eisen
< hower might express to
j Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khru
j shehev over the U2 spy plane in-!
cidcnt.
As for Quemoy and Matsu,
Nixon chaiged Kennedy with
, "contradictory statements, which
| if left to stand on the record . . .
would be an express invitation for
the Communists to blackmail us i
1 by force all over the world."
THK TOXK of Nixon's attacks
I fell more into the pattern of his j
j hard-hitting 1952 and 1956 cam
paign against the Democrats than j
the comparatively mild state
ments he had been making earlier
| in this year's campaign. The more
! he assailed Kennedy, the louder
his Buffalo crowd cheered.
EAKLIER LAST night. Ken
nedy, in a slashing attack on j
Nixon for turning down another j
television debate, said he could :
not see why the Republican nom
inee could not meet him in tele- 1
; vised debate when he had time 1
| to argue with Khrushchev,
j "I cannot Â«ee how he could
; argue with Mr. Khrushchev in a
I kitchen and not meet his Demo-,
cratie opponent on television I
here," the Democratic presiden
tial nominee told a crowd of more
than 80.000 cheering people on the
statehouse lawn in Columbus,
Ohio.
"I don't understand how any
one can stand up to Khrushchev, j
can put his finger in Khru
shchev's face, but can't meet his
Democratic opponent in debate;
here in the United States.
"I TIIINK it would be advan
tageous to people of this country
to hear how Ihe two candidates 1
pi'opose to meet the issues of'
peace, our economy, full employ-!,
ment and how we intend to shift
the balance of power in the world
to this country. |,
Earlier in the day at Spring- i
field, Kennedy stressed honesty in 1 ,
government and indicated he j
would give no consideration to
race and religion in making cabi- ,
net and other appointments, only
intending to get the ablest per-1 .
sons possible.
Police had a rough time pro-1
tecting Kennedy into town and on
to the airport after the speech be- i
cause Ohio's capital gave him one ,
of the biggest, wildest welcomes (
of his campaign. He stumped (
Ohio yesterday in his bid for its :
25 electoral votes.
