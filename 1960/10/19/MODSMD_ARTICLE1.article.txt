# Candidates Promise Tough Foreign Policy
## 
### United Press International 
Both presidential candidates promised a two-fisted U.S. foreign
policy yesterday in speeches before the annual American Legion
convention, the nation's largest veterans group.
Vice President Richard M. Nixon, the Republican nominee,
called the regime of Cuban Premier Fidel Castro an "intolerable

cancer" in the Western Hemi
sphere and said the United States
"will very prom p 11 y take the
strongest possible economic meas
ures" against the island nation.
Democratic standard bear e r
Sen. John F. Kennedy said he
"never believed in retreating un
der fire" and would not cut the
nation's commitments in the
cause of freedom anywhere in the
world. "This," he said, "includes
the Formosa Straits or anywhere
else."
BUT Kennedy said relative
American military strength has
been on a sharp decline compared
to that of the Communist world.
Kennedy called for a jet airlift
fleet, crash programs for the Po
laris and Minuteman missiles and
a reorganization of the Defense
Department in his talk to the
Legion.
N ix on disagreed, contending
that while the nation cannot stand
pat, it is obviously still the most
powerful nation, militarily and
economically.
Nixon also pledged that if he
is elected President he would con
sider a U.S. veto "fully justified"
in the United Nations Security
Council to block the admittance
of Red China to the world body.
LATER in the day in Tampa,
Fla., Kennedy said "I want
Khruschev and Castro to know
that after this election in Novem
ber a new generation of Ameri
cans lias come to leadership and
is not going to preside over the
nation's liquidation here, or in
Latin America, Asia or Africa."
Earlier in the day, a dispute
broke out over a statement by
GOP vice presidential candidate
Henry Cabot Lodge on placing a
Negro in the Cabinet.
In Rome, N.Y., Lodge said it
would be a "wonderful thing" to
have a Negro in the Cabinet.
. . I'll make this prediction, that
if Nixon is elected there will be
a qualified Negro in the Cabinet,"
he said.
LATER, newsmen asked Lodge
if he had said it was a "promise"
that a Negro would be named to
the Cabinet. "I did not say 'prom
ise.' " he replied. "I never said
that."
When reporters showed Lodge's
statement to a spokesman for
Nixon in Miami, the spokesman
said Nixon was unaware of any
such prediction, and Nixon stood
by his refusal to join in any
pledge that a Negro would be
named to the Cabinet should
Nixon win Nov. 8.
Press Secretary Herbert G.
Klein ■said Nixon holds to his po
sition brought out after a pre
vious "pledge" last week by
Lodge that "a man's race or re
ligion should not be a factor
either for or against him" in Cab
inet appointments.

Both presidential candidates promised a two-fisted U.S. foreign
policy yesterday in speeches before the annual American Legion
convention, the nation's largest veterans group.
Vice President Richard M. Nixon, the Republican nominee,
called the regime of Cuban Premier Fidel Castro an "intolerable

Sen. John F. Kennedy said he
"never believed in retreating un
der fire" and would not cut the
nation's commitments in the
cause of freedom anywhere in the
world. "This," he said, "includes
the Formosa Straits or anywhere
else."
BUT Kennedy said relative
American military strength has
been on a sharp decline compared
to that of the Communist world.
Kennedy called for a jet airlift
fleet, crash programs for the Po
laris and Minuteman missiles and
a reorganization of the Defense
Department in his talk to the
Legion.
N ix on disagreed, contending
that while the nation cannot stand
pat, it is obviously still the most
powerful nation, militarily and
economically.
Nixon also pledged that if he
is elected President he would con
sider a U.S. veto "fully justified"
in the United Nations Security
Council to block the admittance
of Red China to the world body.
LATER in the day in Tampa,
Fla., Kennedy said "I want
Khruschev and Castro to know
that after this election in Novem

is not going to preside over the
nation's liquidation here, or in
Latin America, Asia or Africa."
Earlier in the day, a dispute
broke out over a statement by
GOP vice presidential candidate
Henry Cabot Lodge on placing a
Negro in the Cabinet.
In Rome, N.Y., Lodge said it
would be a "wonderful thing" to
have a Negro in the Cabinet.
. . I'll make this prediction, that
if Nixon is elected there will be
a qualified Negro in the Cabinet,"
he said.
LATER, newsmen asked Lodge
if he had said it was a "promise"
that a Negro would be named to
the Cabinet. "I did not say 'prom
ise.' " he replied. "I never said
that."
When reporters showed Lodge's
statement to a spokesman for
Nixon in Miami, the spokesman
said Nixon was unaware of any
such prediction, and Nixon stood
by his refusal to join in any
pledge that a Negro would be
named to the Cabinet should
Nixon win Nov. 8.
Press Secretary Herbert G.
Klein ■said Nixon holds to his po
sition brought out after a pre
vious "pledge" last week by
Lodge that "a man's race or re

either for or against him" in Cab
