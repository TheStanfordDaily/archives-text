# A 						Phony Letter?
## 
### 
A letter printed in yesterday"* Daily written by a certain IT. 1,.
Buckingham, chairman of academic and youth committee, Ameri
can patriotic coalition, has been thought by many people to lie
a phony.
Whether Mr. Buckingham and his patriotic coalition exist
cannot be easily determined. Newspapers are always subjected
to crackpots and idiots who use a phony name and title in order
to guarantee that their letters will be printed.
Mr. Buckingham's letter, however, has all the earmarks of
being valid. At the top of the letterhead is: "Republican National
Convention, Committee on Arrangements." Thruston B. Morton,
Kentucky Senator, is listed on the letterhead as Chairman of this
committee. Also on it is the Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Concessions, If. J. Porter.
We are therefore led to believe that Mr. Buckingham most
assuredly docs exist and so does his coalition of American patriots.
We sincerely doubt that Senator Morton ever saw the letter.
It is not likely that one of the nation's leading Republicans could
possibly condone such junk.
There are two points in the letter which are very revealing.
Mr Buckingham refers to Jane and Leland Stanford as '"those
great Protestants" who could never have accepted the Daily's en
dorsement of Senator Kennedy. Mr. Buckingham forgets that just
because he is prejudiced does not mean that everyone else is.
Senator Stanford and his wife were also great Americans who
believed in equality of races and religions. We refer Mr. Buck
ingham to the Founding Crant if he questions this.
After informing us that Senator Kennedy is an appeaser who
"would sell our beloved nation down the river . . . Mr. Bucking
ham states that although Mr. Nixon's "public statements are neces
sarily sometimes too internationalist in character, his heart lies
with true American patriotism."'
What Mr. Buckingham is saying is that Mr. Nixon is not telling
the people the truth. Mr. Nixon is simply making international
ist statements because they are "necessary." Necessary for what?
Necessary to make the people think he is one thing when he is
really something else? W hat the statement obviously infers is that
the \ ice President is simpk saying things he doesn't mean so he
can get elected. We are shocked to think that a presidential candi
date would resort to such devious means, and we are confident that
Mr. Nixon is not guilty of Mr. Buckingham's statement.
Mr. Buckingham also finds it necessar\ to warn us against "the
leftist dribble which vour professors assign you." Ihe professors
at Stanford undoubtedly resent that.
We hope for the sake of the Republican Party that Mr. Buck
ingham is really a mythical character. As a matter of fact, we
hope for the sake of the nation that this letter was written by some
nut who does not hold a responsible position in the Republican
Party. He is a disgrace not only to the Party, if he is a member,
hut to all of our American ideals.
