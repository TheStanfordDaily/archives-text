## U.S. Backs Dictatorship 
### 
With both presidential candi
dates proclaiming they would go
to war if Taiwan were attacked
by Red China, it is perhaps en
lightening to examine the politi
cal situation of this small island
for which we would risk nuclear
attack.
Nationalist China is ruled bv
the Kuomintang Party led by
Chaing Kai-shek who is virtually
a dictator under the martial law
now in effect. A few small parties
have been allowed to arise as
token opposition; however, they
have been carefully supervised
and never permitted to attain any
power.
Late in August, a group of men,
mostly native Taiwanians, an
nounced their intention of form
ing the China Democratic Party
which professed an anti-Commu
nist program with the purpose of
breaking the one-party Kuomin
tang rule and the excessive con
centration of power. One of the
leaders of the new party was Lei
Chen, the publisher of the "Free
China Fortnightly," and a former
Kuomintang adherent. Lei had
served in the Nationalist Cabinet
until 1954 when he was ousted be
cause of smuggling (government
version) or criticizing the govern
ment in his publication (Lei's ver
sion). Since his expulsion, he has
been an active critic of the gov
ernment and has advocated a true
two-party system.
On September 26, the Nation
alist government issued an indict
ment against I<ei on the grounds
he had openly advocated "revolu
tion" and "bloodshed" to over
throw the government and ar
rested him under the Statute for
the Punishment of Se d i t i on
adopted in If)If). Lei was sen
tenced to ten years in prison by a
military tribunal on October 8,
and two associates were also con
victed of sedition and given prison
terms.
The Nationalist government has
denied that Lei's part in the for
mation of the China Democratic
Party influenced their action, but
it is curious to note that no meas
ures wore taken against Lei for
his articles of the past six years
until he Instigated the new party.
Also, when Lei was arrested, the
membership lists of the party
were confiscated.

Furthermore, a Kuomintang
spokesman, referring to the China
Democratic Party, earlier said:
"We are well aware that they are
not at all Red-tainted or harbor
any Communist sympathies. They
are more comparable to under
world characters who want to
move into politics;" yet the
charges made against Lei were
that he had attempted to incite re
bellion and had harbored a Com
munist spy.
During the trial, Lei was given
no opportunity to confront his
major accuser, although he may
appeal for a retrial.
Criticism of the arrest and
court-martial has arisen within
the ranks of the Kuomintang
Party itself, and the dissenters
have been disciplined and/or ex
pelled. One "Kuomintang official,
explaining the disciplinary action,
said that although any person is
entitled to his opinions, all mem
bers should adhere to official
Kuomintang policy; a member
may not retain his party member
ship and be publicly critical of
the party at the same time.
This incident, while one of the
most serious violations of politi
cal freedom, is indicative of the
means by which Chaing Kai-shek
has exercised his authority on
Taiwan. He has managed to re
tain his power with military and
financial assistance given by the
United States and is protected
from attack by the Seventh Fleet.
Whereas few Americans would
feel it desirable to allow Red
China to conquer Taiwan, there
are also few who would wish to
see the United States risk destruc
tion for the dictatorial policies of
Chaing. We must not sit back and
watch Taiwan become another
Cuba, South Korea, or Turkey.
The United States has sup
ported too many dictators in the
past with disastrous results to
continue its backing of the pres
ent Nationalist policies. If a word
to the wise is not sufficient to
convince Chiang to change his
ways, then some form of eco
nomic pressure should be em
: ployed. In any case, the U.S.
should not expose itself to nuclear
attack by supporting a govern
ment which is one of the most
dictatorial and corrupt in the
[ Western world.

denied that Lei's part in the for

it is curious to note that no meas

Also, when Lei was arrested, the
membership lists of the party
were confiscated.

Furthermore, a Kuomintang
spokesman, referring to the China
Democratic Party, earlier said:
"We are well aware that they are
not at all Red-tainted or harbor
any Communist sympathies. They
are more comparable to under
world characters who want to
move into politics;" yet the
charges made against Lei were
that he had attempted to incite re

During the trial, Lei was given
no opportunity to confront his
major accuser, although he may
appeal for a retrial.
Criticism of the arrest and
court-martial has arisen within

have been disciplined and/or ex

said that although any person is
entitled to his opinions, all mem

Kuomintang policy; a member
may not retain his party member

This incident, while one of the
most serious violations of politi

means by which Chaing Kai-shek
has exercised his authority on
Taiwan. He has managed to re

United States and is protected
from attack by the Seventh Fleet.
Whereas few Americans would
feel it desirable to allow Red
China to conquer Taiwan, there
are also few who would wish to

Chaing. We must not sit back and

Cuba, South Korea, or Turkey.
The United States has sup

continue its backing of the pres

to the wise is not sufficient to

Nationalist China is ruled bv
the Kuomintang Party led by

a dictator under the martial law

have been allowed to arise as

cause of smuggling (government
version) or criticizing the govern

been an active critic of the gov

two-party system.
On September 26, the Nation

he had openly advocated "revolu

Chaing. We must not sit back and
watch Taiwan become another
Cuba, South Korea, or Turkey.
The United States has sup
ported too many dictators in the
past with disastrous results to
continue its backing of the pres
ent Nationalist policies. If a word
to the wise is not sufficient to
convince Chiang to change his
ways, then some form of eco
nomic pressure should be em
: ployed. In any case, the U.S.
should not expose itself to nuclear
attack by supporting a govern
ment which is one of the most
dictatorial and corrupt in the
[ Western world.
With both presidential candi
dates proclaiming they would go
to war if Taiwan were attacked
by Red China, it is perhaps en
lightening to examine the politi
cal situation of this small island
for which we would risk nuclear
attack.
Nationalist China is ruled bv
the Kuomintang Party led by
Chaing Kai-shek who is virtually
a dictator under the martial law
now in effect. A few small parties
have been allowed to arise as
token opposition; however, they
have been carefully supervised
and never permitted to attain any
power.
Late in August, a group of men,
mostly native Taiwanians, an
nounced their intention of form
ing the China Democratic Party
which professed an anti-Commu
nist program with the purpose of
breaking the one-party Kuomin
tang rule and the excessive con
centration of power. One of the
leaders of the new party was Lei
Chen, the publisher of the "Free
China Fortnightly," and a former
Kuomintang adherent. Lei had
served in the Nationalist Cabinet
until 1954 when he was ousted be
cause of smuggling (government
version) or criticizing the govern
ment in his publication (Lei's ver
sion). Since his expulsion, he has
been an active critic of the gov
ernment and has advocated a true
two-party system.
On September 26, the Nation
alist government issued an indict
ment against I<ei on the grounds
he had openly advocated "revolu
tion" and "bloodshed" to over
throw the government and ar
rested him under the Statute for
the Punishment of Se d i t i on
adopted in If)If). Lei was sen
tenced to ten years in prison by a
military tribunal on October 8,
and two associates were also con
victed of sedition and given prison
terms.
The Nationalist government has
denied that Lei's part in the for
mation of the China Democratic
Party influenced their action, but
it is curious to note that no meas
ures wore taken against Lei for
his articles of the past six years
until he Instigated the new party.
Also, when Lei was arrested, the
membership lists of the party
were confiscated.

Furthermore, a Kuomintang
spokesman, referring to the China
Democratic Party, earlier said:
"We are well aware that they are
not at all Red-tainted or harbor
any Communist sympathies. They
are more comparable to under
world characters who want to
move into politics;" yet the
charges made against Lei were
that he had attempted to incite re
bellion and had harbored a Com
munist spy.
During the trial, Lei was given
no opportunity to confront his
major accuser, although he may
appeal for a retrial.
Criticism of the arrest and
court-martial has arisen within
the ranks of the Kuomintang
Party itself, and the dissenters
have been disciplined and/or ex
pelled. One "Kuomintang official,
explaining the disciplinary action,
said that although any person is
entitled to his opinions, all mem
bers should adhere to official
Kuomintang policy; a member
may not retain his party member
ship and be publicly critical of
the party at the same time.
This incident, while one of the
most serious violations of politi
cal freedom, is indicative of the
means by which Chaing Kai-shek
has exercised his authority on
Taiwan. He has managed to re
tain his power with military and
financial assistance given by the
United States and is protected
from attack by the Seventh Fleet.
Whereas few Americans would
feel it desirable to allow Red
China to conquer Taiwan, there
are also few who would wish to
see the United States risk destruc
tion for the dictatorial policies of
Chaing. We must not sit back and
watch Taiwan become another
Cuba, South Korea, or Turkey.
