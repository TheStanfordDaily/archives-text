Editor, the Daily:
It is time to expose big-time in
tercollegiate football for what it
is: The most mon-strous (and j
ludicrous) educational hoax of;
our time. Those who perpetrated
it many years ago throughout the
United States have done a dis
service to American education.
Those who today rationalize big
time football may be doing a fur
ther disservice.
The recruiting that such foot-j
ball requires is scarcely less con- j
temptible than the giving of
scholarships for athletic potential.
The intense pressure to win on
both the coaching staff and the
football players causes an over
emphasis on the non-intellectual
activities of college. In short, big
time football distorts the purpose
of college which is training the
mind and body. Big-time football
trains only a tiny fraction of a
university's student: body; de
emphasized football can do the
same without the above conse
quences.
Some will try to justify Ihe ex
istence of big-time football and all
that goes with it. Ask them: for
what purpose does the American
college exist? Then ask them for
the raison d'etre of American,
intercollegiate, big-time football.
They may blurt out something
about A. money from gate re
ceipts, B. school spirit, C. pursuit
of excellence, D. a national repu
tation, or E. an incentive for
alumni contributions.
That football gate receipts pay
for the entire college athletic pro
gram is a common defense of big
time football. If tiiis be true, must
the athletic program be self
financing? Or do football receipts
help finance recruiting? Perhaps
overemphasis of athletics can be
a vicious circle. In any case, many
large colleges support their gen
eral athletic program without the
aid of huge football receipts.
School spirit should never be
dependent on the football record.
If it is so dependent, is school
spirit worth anything? Or does it
become a matter of cheering for
a winning team or deprecating a
losing team? And is not that
kind of spirit deceivingly shal
low?
Does the pursuit of excellence
require that a college's student
body excell in bow-and-arrow
hunting? Or in a properly exe
cuted cross body block? If yes,
then let's begin a recruiting pro
gram for promising archers. Per
haps, however, we should be more
selective in determining what ac
tivities deserve our pursuit.
Does a college gain anything
but more football players when it
acquires a national football repu
tation?
If a college's alumni will sup
port their alma mater only if
there's a winning big-time foot
ball team, is that circumstance a
sad commentary on American
ideals and especially on Ameri
can's understanding of a college's
purpose? Should a college con
tribute to this misunderstanding
by yielding to it?
Those of us who enjoy athletics
in their proper emphasis and
hope to benefit from their lessons
deplore big-time college football.
Are we, in the United States, sac
rificing to big-time football the
money, effort, and attention
which our education should re
quire?
Does big-time football serve us
beter than football played on a
low emphasis?
Will someone answer these
questions?

Editor, (lie Daily:
Since we are friends, it is dif
ficult for me 1o say that on oc
casion, your editorials stink.
I refer, of course, to your edi
torial, "A Black Day" in which
you suggest that we start playing
football against only the "smaller,
non AAVVU" teams. Your reason
for this is that we do not want to
be a losing team and therefore
should stop facing opponents who
might beat us. My hoy, I was
ashamed to have heard this re
peated last evening during a
newscast on one of San Fran-'
cisco's larger radio stations. It
was then attributed to the Stan
ford Daily, "the campus publica
tion," and was similarity sent out
by the news services.
Every team has its disappoint
ments over the years and it is
true that Stanford now faces a
crisis. But we have an experienced
coach and a fine group of ath
letes representing us as our foot
ball team. We cannot buy or sell
these athletes, but simply choose
the best 36 men that we have and
leave our football fate to their
abilities. If this policy does not
prove conducive to winning
games, then all we realistically
can do is kep trying. And it is
ridiculous to assume that our
coach and players are not trying.
Even while losing, we are given
the opportunity to see some of the
finest football teams in the nation.
Just for the sake of speculation,
assume that half of Norman's
passes had been completed this
season. On paper, this would have
won 3 of the 5 games. And recall
that last year Dick completed well
over fifty per cent of his efforts.
Maybe next year the passing
[catching combinations will click,
I or perhaps some good running
backs will develop. I am sure that
j better football minds than yours,
' Mr. C.reonberg, are trying to get

us foot bail victories, not moral
defeats.
1 would also bring to your at
tention that on that same "Black
Day" our frosh team tied the San
Jose frosh, but completely over
powered the San Jose team in
statistics.
The idea is to congratulate
"small San Jose" for beating us
and playing good football. The
idea is to enjoy football for what
it is, a sport in which one learn
must lose and many single fac
tors determine the result. And the
idea is to credit our team and our
coach for what have been some
hard efforts and quietly wish that
we were doing better.
But Barry, please allow us our
self respect by not allowing the
Daily to make the Student Body
appear to be bad sports, weak and
squirmish chickens. You have
been given the responsibility to
keep us informed, not humiliated.

Editor, ihe Daily:
Two years ago Washington was
one of only two schools to lose
to Stanford. I do not know if their
fans hanged Jim Owens in effigy,
or lamented the likes of such mis
erable sophomores? as Schioredt,
Fleming, Allen, Kinnune, etc., but
the defeat seems to have been
forgotten, and de-emphasis was
not necessary.
De-emphasized football al Stan
ford (1) would not pay for all the
other sports in which we now very
sucessfully compete, (2> would
kill such traditions as Big Game,
<3) cannot honorably "save" us
from such games already sched
uled as Notre Dame (19(53, (4)
would be a slap in the face to two
good frosh teams in a row, and
(5) is entirely unjustified.
Our rising academic standards
bar no more good players who are
eligible for other good schools
than they attract; Washington
may admit some students who
couldn't make it on the Farm,
but a prep player with a choice

will come here; ihe one thing we
really need to corrtpete is more
grants-in-aid. Football pays, and
winning football pays for grants
to winning players.

I would like to know if the stu
dent body of Stanford is aware
of the impression it makes on Ihe
general public by performances
such as that at last Saturday's
game. 1 am not talking about the
obvious lack of spirit, non-support
and plain disinterest of the team,
incapability of performing card
stunts for season ticket-holders,
or inability of supposed yells.
This is typical of Ihe non-athletic
student which now fairly repre
sents Stanford.
What I am talking about is the
performance which takes place
in tho stands, encouraged by those
in authority (yell-leaders, student
police). When two shirtless,
sweaty male students can stand
up in the middle of a rooting sec
tion and exhibit profane and vul
gar hand signals to the entire
rooting section, and do so for four
or five consecutive minutes with
out being apprehended or even
asked to sit down, it is time for
fans to go home. This is but one
example: flying beer cans, mass
profanity and hand signals, all
abound. I am not one to criticize
fun and' wit)â€”(-last year, things
which bordered on the crude also
bordered on the witty, and I en
joyed them very much, as did
most others. But vulgarity and ob
scenity without purpose is dis
gusting. and something of which
to be deeply ashamed and dis
turbed when uncorrected.
Our church group was plan
ning to make a day of it for your
Homecoming activities October
29th, but after witnessing Satur
day's exhibition, we cannot see
why we should subject ourselves,
to say nothing of our children, to
such filthy displays. To put it in
the dollar and cents terms to

which the whole University seems
to bp oriented these days, this
means the loss of 120 general ad
missions, 100 high-school, and
about 200 children's ticket re
ceipts.
I am very sorry to see Stanford
come to this.

Ilenry Blauth would not want
his friends to mourn his death,
(jncirele his body with flowers
lhat will wilt, or pay tribute
loquaciously to his life. These are
unnecessary. But 1 would like to
share with them my knowledge
of his death. His disease started
at the end of last autumn quarter
and he became increasingly worse
until he had to quit teaching the
last week of winter quarter. On
the 12th of April he went to sur
gery to have a brain tumor re
moved which proved to be malig
nant. Though he had lost the use
of the right side of his body be
fore the operation, by June 15th
with the help of daily x-ray and
physical - therapy treatments he
had so improved that he was
moved to a convalescent hospital.
On June 2"ith a crisis came and
his health became worse. A monlh
ago the Henry Blauth we know

and love ceased to be aware of
his own existence. Yesterday his
body died. The doctors feel that
he suffered no pain.
I recall one evening about the
middle of winter quarter a friend
and 1 spent with him at which
time he was having dizzy spells.
He mentioned that he thought lie
mi g h t not live very long. My
friend suggested that anyone who
lived as intensely as he could not
be cheated by death.
Upon Herr Blauth's request
there will lie no funeral. I pro
pose that those who want to do
a specific act of remembrance
make a donation to the American
Cancer Society.

Vitally needed clothes and

for overseas distribution thanks
to the cooperatu.i of the living
groups in the recent Stanford In

SI HO hopes that the student
body will continue their enthusi

will become increasingly aware
of student responsibility in the
field of international relief.
