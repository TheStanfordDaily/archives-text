# Profile of Khrushchev

### MAHYAR NASHAT 
(Editor's Note: This is the sec
ond in a series of articles writ
ten by Mahyar Nashat, ASSU
Foreign Scholar, who covered the
U.N. General Assembly for Iran.
Today, Nashat discusses Premier
Khrushchev.)

It took them, those English,
French and German people, many
centuries to succeed in establish
ing the norms of diplomatic "eti
quette" and protocol. Then a man
from a remote coal region in
Kursk came along and told them
"to hell with your protocol." The
man is Nikita Sergevich Khru
shchev, Prime Minister of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Repub
lics and the First Secretary of the
most powerful Communist Party
in the world.
The central hall of the U.N.
General Assembly comes to life
and whispers toll that K. is com
ing. Photographers run to wel
come him by their click-clicking
and the reporters pull out their
notebooks and, pencil in hand,
rush towards him. Then Mr. K.
begins to appear. First his bald
shining head, then his medium
sized shoulders, and at last his
heavy short legs.
The first time Mr. K. appeared
was in a poor Russian family
sixty-six years ago. He embraced
Communism after the 1917 revo
lution, went up the ladder to catch
the eye of Lazar Kaganovich, then
Moscow party boss, continued to
go up, this time by the steppes,
in Stalin's days as his agent in
the Ukraine, and finally reached
the top by the escalator two years
ago to become the big boss in his
country.
The physical aspects of Mr. K.
show a genuine peasant look
which his Italian-tailored suits
cannot hide, and which is even
reflected in his manners. He is an
extrovert who enjoys mingling
with people. He is well known for
his "tovarish" laughters, which
usually begin with a smile, quick
ly develop into a grin and is fol
lowed by a good, loud "ha. ha."
I think that Hank Ketchum
could get many good ideas for his
"Dennis the Menace" if he
watched Mr. K. He is active and
talented in personal diplomacy.
If he is not shaking hands with
Nkrumah. you may be sure that

he is speaking to Krishna Menen.
If you cannot see him in the Gen
eral Assembly meeting, you'll find
him talking to Kadar in the West
Lobby.
13 u r i 11 g the long, boring
speeches, he talks to Groinyko,
seated on his left. Or, he turns his
head and makes a few remarks to
Tito. He does not take any notes,
but he plays with a pencil. When
he receives the text of a speech he
passes it to Gromyko. If the
speech seems important or the
speaker is one of the international
personalities, then K. becomes in
terested, serious and attentive.
He presses the earphone, looks
straight forward at the speaker
and remains silent for many long
moments.
Mr. K.'s natural color is white,
but he is able to turn into some
other shades. For instance, if Mac
mi llan mentions in his speech that
the West is and always has been
eager to reach an agreement on
disarmament, Mr. K. begins to be
come red in anger. If the British
Prime Minister goes on to say
that the USSR is responsible for
the failure of the Paris Summit
Conference, it takes K. one min
ute to produce a vivid color in
purple, but if the leader of the
Tories, insists that Khrushchev
is not sincere in what he says,
then K. cannot resist any more
and begins a loud, powerful desk
thumping.
When he frowns on hearing
an offending remark on his pol
icy, or when he smiles at a joke
by Castro describing the "warm
welcome" he received in New
York, he looks around with in
quisitive eyes to see how the
others are reacting.
I wish Phil Huyck could see
Mr. K. and learn how a "good"
cheer leader must behave. He has
a simple but effective technique;
if it's one of his "own" players he
leaves the others to start applaud
ing. but if it is one of his neutral
"favorites," he assumes the cheer
ing personally; he claps, stands
up with his hands almost above
his head, turns around and grins
at everybody. More than once he
intimidated with the delegates
of the Union of South Africa
while Nkrumah was denouncing
the racial discrimination in that
country, by hand clapping and

putting an interrogative expres
sion on his face, as if to say.
"Shame on you gentlemen, why
won't you applaud?"
He lias set some new records in
the history of the U.N. Never be- |
lore have we had a "respectable" |
delegate shouted at by another ;
"respectable" delegate from the
floor; never before has a "respect
j able" delegate pounded with his
1 hands in protest; never before lias
a "respectable" delegate attracted
; such attention by his initiative
and activities, and never before
has a "respectable" delegate
caused such controversial com
ment* on his policy, true inten
tions and the exploitation of the
dramatic setting of the United
Nations, the presence of a great
number o 1 h-ads of states and the
participation of new independent
members, for propaganda means. >

Khrushchev.)

It took them, those English,
French and German people, many
centuries to succeed in establish
ing the norms of diplomatic "eti
quette" and protocol. Then a man
from a remote coal region in
Kursk came along and told them
"to hell with your protocol." The
man is Nikita Sergevich Khru
shchev, Prime Minister of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Repub
lics and the First Secretary of the
most powerful Communist Party
in the world.
The central hall of the U.N.
General Assembly comes to life
and whispers toll that K. is com
ing. Photographers run to wel
come him by their click-clicking
and the reporters pull out their
notebooks and, pencil in hand,
rush towards him. Then Mr. K.
begins to appear. First his bald
shining head, then his medium
sized shoulders, and at last his
heavy short legs.
The first time Mr. K. appeared
was in a poor Russian family
sixty-six years ago. He embraced
Communism after the 1917 revo
lution, went up the ladder to catch
the eye of Lazar Kaganovich, then
Moscow party boss, continued to
go up, this time by the steppes,
in Stalin's days as his agent in
the Ukraine, and finally reached
the top by the escalator two years
ago to become the big boss in his
country.
The physical aspects of Mr. K.
show a genuine peasant look
which his Italian-tailored suits
cannot hide, and which is even
reflected in his manners. He is an
extrovert who enjoys mingling
with people. He is well known for
his "tovarish" laughters, which
usually begin with a smile, quick
ly develop into a grin and is fol
lowed by a good, loud "ha. ha."
I think that Hank Ketchum
could get many good ideas for his
"Dennis the Menace" if he
watched Mr. K. He is active and
talented in personal diplomacy.
If he is not shaking hands with
Nkrumah. you may be sure that

he is speaking to Krishna Menen.
If you cannot see him in the Gen
eral Assembly meeting, you'll find
him talking to Kadar in the West
Lobby.
13 u r i 11 g the long, boring
speeches, he talks to Groinyko,
seated on his left. Or, he turns his
head and makes a few remarks to
Tito. He does not take any notes,
but he plays with a pencil. When
he receives the text of a speech he
passes it to Gromyko. If the
speech seems important or the
speaker is one of the international
personalities, then K. becomes in
terested, serious and attentive.
He presses the earphone, looks
straight forward at the speaker
and remains silent for many long
moments.
Mr. K.'s natural color is white,
but he is able to turn into some
other shades. For instance, if Mac
mi llan mentions in his speech that
the West is and always has been
eager to reach an agreement on
disarmament, Mr. K. begins to be
come red in anger. If the British
Prime Minister goes on to say
that the USSR is responsible for
the failure of the Paris Summit
Conference, it takes K. one min
ute to produce a vivid color in
purple, but if the leader of the
Tories, insists that Khrushchev
is not sincere in what he says,
then K. cannot resist any more
and begins a loud, powerful desk
thumping.
When he frowns on hearing
an offending remark on his pol
icy, or when he smiles at a joke
by Castro describing the "warm
welcome" he received in New
York, he looks around with in
quisitive eyes to see how the
others are reacting.
I wish Phil Huyck could see
Mr. K. and learn how a "good"
cheer leader must behave. He has
a simple but effective technique;
if it's one of his "own" players he
leaves the others to start applaud
ing. but if it is one of his neutral
"favorites," he assumes the cheer
ing personally; he claps, stands
up with his hands almost above
his head, turns around and grins
at everybody. More than once he
intimidated with the delegates
of the Union of South Africa
while Nkrumah was denouncing
the racial discrimination in that
country, by hand clapping and

putting an interrogative expres
sion on his face, as if to say.
"Shame on you gentlemen, why
won't you applaud?"

leaves the others to start applaud

"favorites," he assumes the cheer
ing personally; he claps, stands
up with his hands almost above
his head, turns around and grins
at everybody. More than once he
intimidated with the delegates
of the Union of South Africa
while Nkrumah was denouncing
the racial discrimination in that
country, by hand clapping and

putting an interrogative expres

"Shame on you gentlemen, why
won't you applaud?"

"respectable" delegate from the
floor; never before has a "respect

1 hands in protest; never before lias
a "respectable" delegate attracted

and activities, and never before
has a "respectable" delegate
caused such controversial com

Today, Nashat discusses Premier
Khrushchev.)

It took them, those English,
French and German people, many
centuries to succeed in establish
ing the norms of diplomatic "eti
quette" and protocol. Then a man
from a remote coal region in
Kursk came along and told them
"to hell with your protocol." The
man is Nikita Sergevich Khru
shchev, Prime Minister of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Repub
lics and the First Secretary of the
most powerful Communist Party
in the world.
The central hall of the U.N.
General Assembly comes to life
and whispers toll that K. is com
ing. Photographers run to wel
come him by their click-clicking
and the reporters pull out their
notebooks and, pencil in hand,
rush towards him. Then Mr. K.
begins to appear. First his bald
shining head, then his medium
sized shoulders, and at last his
heavy short legs.
The first time Mr. K. appeared
was in a poor Russian family
sixty-six years ago. He embraced
Communism after the 1917 revo
lution, went up the ladder to catch
the eye of Lazar Kaganovich, then
Moscow party boss, continued to
go up, this time by the steppes,
in Stalin's days as his agent in
the Ukraine, and finally reached
the top by the escalator two years
ago to become the big boss in his
country.
The physical aspects of Mr. K.
show a genuine peasant look
which his Italian-tailored suits
cannot hide, and which is even
reflected in his manners. He is an
extrovert who enjoys mingling
with people. He is well known for
his "tovarish" laughters, which
usually begin with a smile, quick
ly develop into a grin and is fol
lowed by a good, loud "ha. ha."
I think that Hank Ketchum
could get many good ideas for his
"Dennis the Menace" if he
watched Mr. K. He is active and
talented in personal diplomacy.
If he is not shaking hands with
Nkrumah. you may be sure that

he is speaking to Krishna Menen.
If you cannot see him in the Gen
eral Assembly meeting, you'll find
him talking to Kadar in the West
Lobby.
13 u r i 11 g the long, boring
speeches, he talks to Groinyko,
seated on his left. Or, he turns his
head and makes a few remarks to
Tito. He does not take any notes,
but he plays with a pencil. When
he receives the text of a speech he
passes it to Gromyko. If the
speech seems important or the
speaker is one of the international
personalities, then K. becomes in
terested, serious and attentive.
He presses the earphone, looks
straight forward at the speaker
and remains silent for many long
moments.
Mr. K.'s natural color is white,
but he is able to turn into some
other shades. For instance, if Mac
mi llan mentions in his speech that
the West is and always has been
eager to reach an agreement on
disarmament, Mr. K. begins to be
come red in anger. If the British
Prime Minister goes on to say
that the USSR is responsible for
the failure of the Paris Summit
Conference, it takes K. one min
ute to produce a vivid color in
purple, but if the leader of the
Tories, insists that Khrushchev
is not sincere in what he says,
then K. cannot resist any more
and begins a loud, powerful desk
thumping.
When he frowns on hearing
an offending remark on his pol
icy, or when he smiles at a joke
by Castro describing the "warm
welcome" he received in New
York, he looks around with in
quisitive eyes to see how the
others are reacting.
I wish Phil Huyck could see
Mr. K. and learn how a "good"
cheer leader must behave. He has
a simple but effective technique;
if it's one of his "own" players he
leaves the others to start applaud
ing. but if it is one of his neutral
"favorites," he assumes the cheer
ing personally; he claps, stands

purple, but if the leader of the
Tories, insists that Khrushchev
is not sincere in what he says,
then K. cannot resist any more
and begins a loud, powerful desk
thumping.
When he frowns on hearing
an offending remark on his pol
icy, or when he smiles at a joke
by Castro describing the "warm
welcome" he received in New
York, he looks around with in
quisitive eyes to see how the
others are reacting.
I wish Phil Huyck could see
Mr. K. and learn how a "good"
cheer leader must behave. He has
a simple but effective technique;
if it's one of his "own" players he
leaves the others to start applaud
ing. but if it is one of his neutral
"favorites," he assumes the cheer
ing personally; he claps, stands
up with his hands almost above
his head, turns around and grins
at everybody. More than once he
intimidated with the delegates
of the Union of South Africa
while Nkrumah was denouncing
the racial discrimination in that
country, by hand clapping and

putting an interrogative expres
sion on his face, as if to say.
"Shame on you gentlemen, why
won't you applaud?"
He lias set some new records in
the history of the U.N. Never be- |
lore have we had a "respectable" |
delegate shouted at by another ;
"respectable" delegate from the
floor; never before has a "respect
j able" delegate pounded with his
1 hands in protest; never before lias
a "respectable" delegate attracted
; such attention by his initiative
and activities, and never before
has a "respectable" delegate
caused such controversial com
ment* on his policy, true inten
tions and the exploitation of the
dramatic setting of the United
Nations, the presence of a great
number o 1 h-ads of states and the
participation of new independent
members, for propaganda means. >
