# Pike to Speak On Campaign, Religious Issue
## 
### 
The Rev. James A. Pike.
Episcopal Bishop of California,
will spSak on "Religion and Poli
tics" at 7:30 tonight in Cubberley
Auditorium.
Pike, who is noted for his out
spoken statements on controver
sial issues, is an articulate Prot
estant authority who has often
presented his stand on Church-
State relations during the last two
years.
IN he wrote an article for
Life magazine, entitled "Should a
Catholic Be President?", in which
he set aside the factor of preju
dice and said that "it is not anti-
Catholic to be concerned about
where a particular candidate
stands on important Church-State
questions."
He said recently in Detroit that
the nation's voters are entitled to
know where a candidate stands
in relation to the official position
of the candidate's church.
HE SAID further that he is
greatly concerned about opposi
tion to birth control, which he
placed as second only to arms
control as a pressing world issue.
Throughout this campaign
year, Piko has maintained that
the matter of Roman Catholic
allegiance belongs among the
campaign issues. He said that this
allegiance is likely to become im
portant in the issues of federal
subsidies to parochial schools,
censorship, official United States
recognition of the Vatican, and
the distribution of information
about birth control.
Despite these views, Pike re
cently advised Episcopal minis
ters not to take sides in the cur
rent campaign.
