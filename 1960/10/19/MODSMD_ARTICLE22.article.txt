### 
NEW YORK (UPI» — Adlai E. Stevenson last night accused
Vice President Richard M. Nixon of throwing away this country's
diplomatic flexibility by commiling the United States to the defense
of the "indefensible" islands of Quemoy and Matsu.
Stevenson said that Nixon's declaration on the Nationalist Chi-

I nese islands lying off the coast of
j Communist China was another of
1 the Vice President's "reckless
statements." "He has oven self
! righteously criticized Senator
(John F.) Kennedy for sticking
strictly to our treaty commit
i ments to defend Formosa—a com
mitment made by the Eisenhower-
Nixon administration," Stevenson
I said.
"IT IS BAI) enough to have 1o
' talk about such delicate matters
at all in a political campaign—
to talk about them demagogically
is worse," he added.
The former Democratic presi
dential candidate said at a $100-
| a-plate dinner of the New York
Citizens for Kennedy and John
son that the "Republican illusion
j has been that hard language is
the economy-size way" of coping
with a great challenge.
"But no amount of Mr. Nixon's
tough talk can make indefensible
I islands defensible," he said. "Blus
ter is no substitute for strength.
The problem is not one of rhe
toric and ruses. The problem is
' one of realism and leadership."
STEVENSON did not reply di
; rectly to Nixon's charge yester
jday that he had favored a "deal"
with the Communist Chinese to
I trade a guarantee of freedom for
i Formosa for American support
lof Red China's admission to the
I United Nations.
He did, however, accuse Nixon
of trying to prevent the Ameri
| can people from learning the
"whole truth" about the United
States' current position in the
world by impugning the loyalty
of the opposition.
