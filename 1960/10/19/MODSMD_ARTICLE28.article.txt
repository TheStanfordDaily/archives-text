HUGHES MASTERS FELLOWSHIPS. The Hughes Masters Fel
lowship Program offers unusual opportunities for education leading
to a master's degree... and, in addition, provides each fellow with
practical experience in the professional field of his choice.
Approximately fifty new awards will be made in 1961 to qualified
applicants possessing a bachelor's degree in science or engineering.
A selected group of award winners will be offered a FULL STUDY
PROGRAM. Participants in this program will receive fellowships that
permit them to attend an outstanding university on a full time basis
during the regular academic year with a substantial stipend.
Other award winners will be assigned to the WORK STUDY PROGRAM
and will attend a university sufficiently near a facility of the Hughes
Aircraft Company to permit them to obtain practical experience, in
a professional field of their choice, by working at the company half
time. An appropriate stipend will also be awarded.
After completion of the Master's Program, fellows are eligible to
apply for HUGHES DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS.
