Let's Look at Farm Football
NOW THAT THE SHOCK of being upset by San Jose Stale and
the sudden realism that Stanford undeniably faces theii first win
less season since 1947 have been overcome, we can seriously evalu
ate the football program at Stanford and examine some of the hur
ried and somewhat rash solutions to the problem.
The Stanford Daily editorial page came out with a solution i.e.
because we can't beat teams with lower entrance requirements
hence fielding faster and bigger gridders we should de-emphasize
football on the Farm and play teams of San Francisco State, San
Jose State, etc. calibre.
HOWEVER, THIS WRITER THINKS that this was perhaps a
too hasty conclusion. Certainly no one at the Daily is happy about
how its editorial got blown out of proportion in the two "fine"
newspapers in The City. However, the theory that Stanford students
want to see winning football, hence we should play "easy" teams,
is certainly not a campus-wide held theory nor is it a complete an
swer to the current problem.
We agree that hanging the coach in effigy never cures anything

but disgruntled feelings and over
exuberance. Whatever the reason
for Stanford's continual losses
whether it is receivers who can't
catch footballs, internal strife be
tween coach and players, no one
back that can breakaway and
score, or what -have-you we don't
believe that alumni, most stu
dents, players and coaches alike
want to throw in the towel for
major college football at the
Farm.
We talked to Assistant Athletic
Director and former coach Chuck
Taylor about his ideas and solu
tions to the football picture.
TAYLOR SAID that the Ath
letic Department was opposed to
a program of de-emphasizing foot
ball for several reasons. "De-em
phasizing football would be the
greatest tragedy for Stanford col
legiate sports," said Taylor. "The

only way we can draw good crowds, continue our good reputation
in college football which admittedly has dropped in the last two
yearsâ€”and thus be able to draw good players from all parts of the
country, is to play major teams."
"THE FOOTBALL PROGRAM at Stanford," went on Taylor,
"supports all other Stanford sports and athletics, and when we have
a small alumni crowd at the game we don't get the money to help
pay for equipment and coaching not only of football but also in all
other sports. De-emphasizing football would not support the 750 or
so men competing for Stanford in all sports."
Certainly Taylor and the Athletic Department are concerned with
maintaining the high scholastic erquirements for entering Stanford.
But they dispute the general argument that good -students do not
make good athletes. "There is no reason why the good student can
not be a good athlete," stated Taylor, "only his attitude matters."
DURING THIS PERIOD of college football more and more em
phasis is put on the smart football player as well as the big, fast
and unintelligent one. Stanford should with proper recruiting and
coaching- be able to field a winning team of smart gridders.
Besides the financial reasons as well as player desire to play top
competition there are other reasons for continuing major football.
First of all, there is the historical tradition. Now most people know
of the fabulous football teams and coaches in by-gone years at Stan
ford and certainly many alums can remember -seeing or playing on
better teams than this one.
But how can we expect by starting "rivalries" with Fresno State
and San Francisco State that we can hope to see these same alums
attend in the same numbers that see USC, Cal or Big 10 games. Nor
could we expect to compete with Harvard, Yale and other Ivy League
schools because of (1) the distance and (2) the fact that they do
not want to come out here and play. No, now is not the time for us
to go "Ivy" in college football.
Lose, Then Give Up?
Certainly we cannot cry "Uncle" every time we have a loosing
season. But we cannot kid ourselves that football must improve here
or it will bankrupt itself. The question whether we need new coach
ing or new players or both won't be answered this year. What will
solve this problem is an increased recruitment of eligible entrants
and top-rate gridders. We cannot even consider entering an "easier"
league of Northern California teams if we cannot beat one of them
San Jose State.
If Northwestern University which is an excellent engineering
school as well as a present Big 10 power in football would have
given up their major football hopes by leaving the toughest league in
the nation after so many losing and winless seasons, Ara Parseghian
wouldn't have come along and made the Wildcats a continual league
powerhouse and Rose Bowl contender.
OUR ANSWER IS TO STEP up recruitment of eligible men and
evaluate the current program at Stanford. With increased recruit
ment we can attract that good player who also wants a good educa
tion. If this does not bring immediate improvement we should look
loward the coaching. Finally if no relief-is in sight then we could save
face by playing ball teams that should be easy to defeat.
