# Cards Face Bruin Machine
## Daily Sports 
### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
ALMOST EVERY WEEK the pre-game stories list Stanford's cur
rent football opponent as bis, mean and possessing homicidal ten
dencies towards the nice Farm hands. Stanford's next foes, the bad
Bruins of UCLA, fit l ight into the accepted plot.
The South landers, host to the Indians this Saturday, have col-

lected one of everything this year
one win, one loss and one lie,
in addition to two open dates
early in the season. An K-7 defeat
of Pitt in the opening game ac
counted for the win, a 27-27 tie
with Purdue followed on the next
weekend and the loss came last
week in a 10-S decision to Wash
ington.
Looking at the record from a
standpoint of wins and losses, the
Bruins have shown a definite lack
of improvement. But then Coach
Bill Barnes', men haven't been
playing any pushovers either.
SPARKING an offense 1 hat is
second only to Washington among
among the AAWU teams is the
passing and running of senior
tailback Bill Kilmer. Although
playing in only three games thus
far in the season, the six-foot, 186-
pound backfield star has com
618 yards, 523 of them the result
pifed a league leading total of
of 29 pass completions in 53 at
tempts and the remaining 95 from
rushing.
The Wild Bill is only five yards
away from a UCLA career total
of 2,000 yards and if lie keeps
gaining at his present rate, he'll
put a new Bruin total offense rec
ord on the books. In addition Bill
handles the punting chores, av
eraging a fraction under 40 yards
per boot.
OUTSIDE OF Kilmer the south

landers' offensive power is well
dislributed; fullback Skip Smith,
wingback Gene Gaines and tail
back E/.ell Singleton have each
averaged over four yards per
carry. In fact the entire Bruin of
fense speaks of balance. In three
games six Uclans have contribu
ted to the scoring column with
Gaines and Craig (Choo Choo)
Chudy, senior end, leading the
way with 12 points apiece.
Against Washington the Baby
Blue pushed into Husky territory
nine times and three times got in
side the winner's 10-yard line in
contrast to only tvvn Washington
forays across the midfield stripe.
But the Bruin team, which ex
ploded for 55 points against Stan
ford last year, bogged down when
it neared the goal.
ALONG WITH that vaunted of
fense 1he hosts offer a stubborn
defense that has allowed an aver
age of only 248 yards per game
to the opponents, best mark in
the Big Five for that department.
Just to make matters worse for
Mr. Dick Norman and company,
the Bruins have been downright
niggardly with the opposing
passers, limiting the enemy
throwers to an average of 63
yards per fray and only one touch
flown.
