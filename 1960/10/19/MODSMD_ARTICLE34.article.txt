# Bruin Back Kilmer Leads Offense
## 
### 
STANFORD'S NKXT OI'I'O
NKNTS Hie UCLA Bruins
showed ihe biggest gains in
AAWU stats after- last weekend's
encounters. Even though the
Uclans lost to Washington 10-8
the Bruins managed to take the
lead away from the Huskies in
total defense.
Big Five statistics show that
the Bruins are giving opponents
only 232 total yards while the
Huskies have allowed 267.
Elsewhere the Huskies have the
lead in team total offense, rush
ing offense scoring and allowing
the fewest points per game.
UCLA'S BILL KILMKR who
does everything for the Bruins,
took a big lead over Stanford
quarterback Dick Norman in the
individual AAWU total offense
leadership. Kilmer has amassed
618 yards in three games to lead
Norman's 449.
Norman fell to second behind
Cal's Randy Gold in passing this
week as Gold has completed 46
out of 82 while Norman's receiv
ers have grabbed 41 out of 07 for'
two touchdowns.

Stanford backs again are high
In rushing stats. Skip Face, with
215 yards in 33 carries, is second
in that department behind Wash
ington's Charlie Mitchell. Gil
Dowd follows Face and Mitchell
in rushing with 193 total yards.
STANFORD LEADS the pass
receiving department again this
season with Face, Dale Ostrander
and Mac Wylie one-two-three in
grabbing footballs. Also Gary
Craig continues his hold in league
punting leadership as he fell off
a bit to a 41-yard average per
punt.
However, the big news in the
offensive show is Kilmer's top
passing and rushing perform
ances as his leadership in these
departments has resulted in two
less games played than any other
AAWU member.
The Indians will definitely have
to contain this gridder in the
Coliseum next Saturday in order
to come close to the Bruin ma
chine.

less games played than any other
AAWU member.
The Indians will definitely have
to contain this gridder in the
Coliseum next Saturday in order
to come close to the Bruin ma
chine.
STANFORD'S NKXT OI'I'O
NKNTS Hie UCLA Bruins
showed ihe biggest gains in
AAWU stats after- last weekend's
encounters. Even though the
Uclans lost to Washington 10-8
the Bruins managed to take the
lead away from the Huskies in
total defense.
Big Five statistics show that
the Bruins are giving opponents
only 232 total yards while the
Huskies have allowed 267.
Elsewhere the Huskies have the
lead in team total offense, rush
ing offense scoring and allowing
the fewest points per game.
UCLA'S BILL KILMKR who
does everything for the Bruins,
took a big lead over Stanford
quarterback Dick Norman in the
individual AAWU total offense
leadership. Kilmer has amassed
618 yards in three games to lead
Norman's 449.
Norman fell to second behind
Cal's Randy Gold in passing this
week as Gold has completed 46
out of 82 while Norman's receiv
ers have grabbed 41 out of 07 for'
two touchdowns.

Stanford backs again are high
In rushing stats. Skip Face, with
215 yards in 33 carries, is second
in that department behind Wash
ington's Charlie Mitchell. Gil
Dowd follows Face and Mitchell
in rushing with 193 total yards.
STANFORD LEADS the pass
receiving department again this
season with Face, Dale Ostrander
and Mac Wylie one-two-three in
grabbing footballs. Also Gary
Craig continues his hold in league
punting leadership as he fell off
a bit to a 41-yard average per
punt.
However, the big news in the
offensive show is Kilmer's top
passing and rushing perform
ances as his leadership in these
departments has resulted in two
less games played than any other
AAWU member.
