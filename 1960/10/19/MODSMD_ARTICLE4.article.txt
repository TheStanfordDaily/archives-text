WHERE THERE S A KINC, THERE S A CLOWN NEARBY'
Portrayed by actor Philip Hanson in last night's Tuesday
Evening Series lecture, both king and clown came to life
in variety of voice and gesture. Hanson presented scenes
and characters from Shakespeare for a capacity audience in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, minus props, costume, and fellow
players.
