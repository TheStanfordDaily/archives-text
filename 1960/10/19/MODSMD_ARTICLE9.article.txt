# 'Master Plan for the Sixties' Unveiled
## Predict Increase in Tuition Of 75 Percentin Ten Years 
### MAYNARD PARKER Managing Editor 
Stanford's "Master Plan for the Sixties" was unveiled yesterday
afternoon by Vice President for Finance Kenneth Cuthbertson and
Vice Provost Robert Wert in a interview at Bowman Alumni House.
Earlier the plan was announced in a background report to
the 4,000 faculty and staff members. Prominent in the plan are:

1) An increase of 73 per cent!
in tuition.
2) An increase in aid to stu
dents from 25 per cent to 35 per
cent and a 5 per cent rise in loan
funds.
S) An increase of 75 per cent in
faculty salaries.
4) An increase of 30 to 40 per
cent in numbers of faculty.
5) An increase in enrollment
by 2,350 students.
UTHBE R T S O N empha
sized that these plans "are hoped
for and some plans will obviously
have to change."
According to the report, these
increases in addition to other
costs, will take an estimated $346
million dollars of new money.
"We will have to double our
rate of the last 10 years," Wert
said, "just to meet the Ford Foun
dation 3-1 requirement."
Cuthbertson al-so emphasized
that the increase of tuition is
"just about the same" rise as for
the past JO years.
He also added that the $260 rise,
set for next year, is 25 per cent
of the projected 75 per cent in
crease in tuition.
THE VICE president made it
clear that the "objective is to
make a Stanford education avail
able to all qualified applicants,
regardless of needs, despite rising
tuition costs."
To do this, Stanford will in
crease its aid program by 10 per
cent and its loan program by five
per cent.
"We want to make a total gain
in scholarships each year as well
as covering the students who go
into the "need category" with
each tuition rise," Wert said.
UNDERGRADUATE enroll
ment will increase from 5,500 to
6,000 during the next, ten years.
"It is obvious we plan to keep
the undergraduate student body
at its present size. The slight rise
will be taken up by our overseas
study program," he said.
The increase in graduate stu
dents from 3,500 to 5.350 in the
next ten years will take place
gradually. Some departments will
begin Ph.D programs with their
exist in g staff. The Business
School is readying a expansion
program, he reported, while the
Law and Medical Schools have no
plans for student expansion.
Wert believes more undergrad
uate housing unnecessary. "We
will, however," he said, "build
about 250 more graduate student
apartments both for married and
single students."
HE STATED that as the fra
ternaties move to the clusters,
their houses will be rehabilitated
and used as offices for the various
business departments-.
"Some of course are beyond use
and will be torn down," he said.
According to Cuthbertson, the
increase in faculty salaries will
not be across the board, but on a
merit basis.
"WE OPERATE on a system
which both recognizes supply and
demand and keeps salaries equit
able. We will keep our salaries
comparable with the bigger pri
vate institutions," he said.
He looked for a decrease in
teaching assistants, "though these
people are being trained for pro
fessors of tomorrow and we cer
tainly don't intend to get rid of
teaching assist ant.ships."
Cuthbertson also expects to
strengthen the Humanities by
"bringing in top men."
Tomorrow: The University's
academic and building require
ments for I he next decade.

STANFORD'S "MASTER PLAN FOR THE SIXTIES" —Vi ce-president of the University
Kenneth Culbertson and Vice Provost Robert Wert reveal plans for increase in tuition over
next ten years that will provide for increased faculty salaries and enlargement of faculty.
Stanford's "Master Plan for the Sixties" was unveiled yesterday
afternoon by Vice President for Finance Kenneth Cuthbertson and
Vice Provost Robert Wert in a interview at Bowman Alumni House.
Earlier the plan was announced in a background report to
the 4,000 faculty and staff members. Prominent in the plan are:

1) An increase of 73 per cent!
in tuition.
2) An increase in aid to stu
dents from 25 per cent to 35 per
cent and a 5 per cent rise in loan
funds.
S) An increase of 75 per cent in
faculty salaries.
4) An increase of 30 to 40 per
cent in numbers of faculty.
5) An increase in enrollment
by 2,350 students.
UTHBE R T S O N empha
sized that these plans "are hoped
for and some plans will obviously
have to change."
According to the report, these
increases in addition to other
costs, will take an estimated $346
million dollars of new money.
"We will have to double our
rate of the last 10 years," Wert
said, "just to meet the Ford Foun
dation 3-1 requirement."
Cuthbertson al-so emphasized
that the increase of tuition is
"just about the same" rise as for
the past JO years.
He also added that the $260 rise,
set for next year, is 25 per cent
of the projected 75 per cent in
crease in tuition.
THE VICE president made it
clear that the "objective is to
make a Stanford education avail
able to all qualified applicants,
regardless of needs, despite rising
tuition costs."
To do this, Stanford will in
crease its aid program by 10 per
cent and its loan program by five
per cent.
"We want to make a total gain
in scholarships each year as well
as covering the students who go
into the "need category" with
each tuition rise," Wert said.
UNDERGRADUATE enroll
ment will increase from 5,500 to
6,000 during the next, ten years.
"It is obvious we plan to keep
the undergraduate student body
at its present size. The slight rise
will be taken up by our overseas
study program," he said.
The increase in graduate stu
dents from 3,500 to 5.350 in the
next ten years will take place
gradually. Some departments will
begin Ph.D programs with their
exist in g staff. The Business
School is readying a expansion
program, he reported, while the
Law and Medical Schools have no
plans for student expansion.
Wert believes more undergrad
uate housing unnecessary. "We
will, however," he said, "build
about 250 more graduate student
apartments both for married and
single students."
HE STATED that as the fra
ternaties move to the clusters,
their houses will be rehabilitated
and used as offices for the various
business departments-.
"Some of course are beyond use
and will be torn down," he said.
According to Cuthbertson, the
increase in faculty salaries will
not be across the board, but on a
merit basis.
"WE OPERATE on a system
which both recognizes supply and
demand and keeps salaries equit
able. We will keep our salaries
comparable with the bigger pri
vate institutions," he said.
He looked for a decrease in
teaching assistants, "though these
people are being trained for pro
fessors of tomorrow and we cer
tainly don't intend to get rid of
teaching assist ant.ships."
Cuthbertson also expects to
strengthen the Humanities by
"bringing in top men."
Tomorrow: The University's
academic and building require
ments for I he next decade.

STANFORD'S "MASTER PLAN FOR THE SIXTIES" —Vi ce-president of the University
Kenneth Culbertson and Vice Provost Robert Wert reveal plans for increase in tuition over
next ten years that will provide for increased faculty salaries and enlargement of faculty.
Stanford's "Master Plan for the Sixties" was unveiled yesterday
afternoon by Vice President for Finance Kenneth Cuthbertson and
Vice Provost Robert Wert in a interview at Bowman Alumni House.
Earlier the plan was announced in a background report to
the 4,000 faculty and staff members. Prominent in the plan are:

1) An increase of 73 per cent!
in tuition.
2) An increase in aid to stu
dents from 25 per cent to 35 per
cent and a 5 per cent rise in loan
funds.
S) An increase of 75 per cent in
faculty salaries.
4) An increase of 30 to 40 per
cent in numbers of faculty.
5) An increase in enrollment
by 2,350 students.
UTHBE R T S O N empha
sized that these plans "are hoped
for and some plans will obviously
have to change."
According to the report, these
increases in addition to other
costs, will take an estimated $346
million dollars of new money.
"We will have to double our
rate of the last 10 years," Wert
said, "just to meet the Ford Foun
dation 3-1 requirement."
Cuthbertson al-so emphasized
that the increase of tuition is
"just about the same" rise as for
the past JO years.
He also added that the $260 rise,
set for next year, is 25 per cent
of the projected 75 per cent in
crease in tuition.
THE VICE president made it
clear that the "objective is to
make a Stanford education avail
able to all qualified applicants,
regardless of needs, despite rising
tuition costs."
To do this, Stanford will in
crease its aid program by 10 per
cent and its loan program by five
per cent.
"We want to make a total gain
in scholarships each year as well
as covering the students who go
into the "need category" with
each tuition rise," Wert said.
UNDERGRADUATE enroll
ment will increase from 5,500 to
6,000 during the next, ten years.
"It is obvious we plan to keep
the undergraduate student body
at its present size. The slight rise
will be taken up by our overseas
study program," he said.
The increase in graduate stu
dents from 3,500 to 5.350 in the
next ten years will take place
gradually. Some departments will
begin Ph.D programs with their
exist in g staff. The Business
School is readying a expansion
program, he reported, while the
Law and Medical Schools have no
plans for student expansion.
Wert believes more undergrad
uate housing unnecessary. "We
will, however," he said, "build
about 250 more graduate student
apartments both for married and
single students."
HE STATED that as the fra
ternaties move to the clusters,
their houses will be rehabilitated
and used as offices for the various
business departments-.
"Some of course are beyond use
and will be torn down," he said.
According to Cuthbertson, the
increase in faculty salaries will
not be across the board, but on a
merit basis.
"WE OPERATE on a system
which both recognizes supply and
demand and keeps salaries equit
able. We will keep our salaries
comparable with the bigger pri
vate institutions," he said.
He looked for a decrease in
teaching assistants, "though these
people are being trained for pro
fessors of tomorrow and we cer
tainly don't intend to get rid of
teaching assist ant.ships."
Cuthbertson also expects to
strengthen the Humanities by
"bringing in top men."
Tomorrow: The University's
academic and building require
ments for I he next decade.
