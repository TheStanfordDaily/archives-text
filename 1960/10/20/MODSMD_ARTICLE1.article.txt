# Palo Alto To Vote on Zoning Land
## 
### 
In addition to choosing the next
president of the United States
Nov. 8, the people of Palo Alto
will he asked to voice their ap
proval or disapproval on the City
Council's action to zone and annex
part of Stanford's land for devel
opment of selected light industry
and its research facilities.
Thomas W. Ford, director of
Stanford land development, this
week strongly urged the people to
cast a "yes" vote on this measure,
as it will provide both the Univer
sity and community with greatly
increased revenue as well as pro
viding other advantages.
IN SPEECHES given in the
area, Ford presented some of the
facts concerning Stanford and
Palo Alto and the relationship of
each to the proposed measure.
Stanford, reports Ford, is not
a tax-supported institution, nor
is it exempt wholly from property
tax. Only that land which is actu
ally being used for educational
purposes is exempt from being
taxed.
Consequently, Stanford pays
over $.300,000 annually on its prop
erty. Furthermore, some of Stan
ford's most valuable land has been
condemned for public use. The pro
posed measure will alleviate many
of the taxes as well as provide the
University with an income.
UNDER THE terms of the Uni
versity's Founding Grant, Stan
ford may lease but may not sell
its land.
Looking to Stanford's future
educational needs, the Board of
Trustees last year reduced the
lease term from 99 to not over 51
years. Because of this new limita
tion, not many residential areas
are planned for Stanford land.
Over seven square miles are
now reserved for educational pur
poses. None of it is to be leased
for commercial use. This is in con
trast to the 1,200 acres set aside
before World War 11.
BEFORE any active develop
ment is started, the University,
working with others involved, will
go over all details of the project.
This planning includes a review
and approval of all proposed
buildings and landscaping by the
Stanford Land Development.
Ford, in his lectures, pointed
out the many advantages the new
Industrial Park development
would offer to Palo Alto and vi
cinity. The most obvious of these
are the new jobs and payrolls
coming to the area with the new
industries.
Other advantages include high
tax return, increased municipal
utility income, and prestige
brought by high-quality devclop-

opment of selected light industry
and its research facilities.
Thomas W. Ford, director of
Stanford land development, this
week strongly urged the people to
cast a "yes" vote on this measure,
as it will provide both the Univer
sity and community with greatly
increased revenue as well as pro
viding other advantages.
IN SPEECHES given in the
area, Ford presented some of the
facts concerning Stanford and
Palo Alto and the relationship of
each to the proposed measure.
Stanford, reports Ford, is not
a tax-supported institution, nor
is it exempt wholly from property
tax. Only that land which is actu
ally being used for educational
purposes is exempt from being
taxed.
Consequently, Stanford pays
over $.300,000 annually on its prop
erty. Furthermore, some of Stan
ford's most valuable land has been
condemned for public use. The pro
posed measure will alleviate many
of the taxes as well as provide the
University with an income.
UNDER THE terms of the Uni
versity's Founding Grant, Stan
ford may lease but may not sell
its land.
Looking to Stanford's future
educational needs, the Board of
Trustees last year reduced the
lease term from 99 to not over 51
years. Because of this new limita
tion, not many residential areas
are planned for Stanford land.
Over seven square miles are
now reserved for educational pur
poses. None of it is to be leased
for commercial use. This is in con
trast to the 1,200 acres set aside
before World War 11.
BEFORE any active develop
ment is started, the University,
working with others involved, will
go over all details of the project.
This planning includes a review
and approval of all proposed
buildings and landscaping by the
Stanford Land Development.
Ford, in his lectures, pointed
out the many advantages the new
Industrial Park development
would offer to Palo Alto and vi
cinity. The most obvious of these
are the new jobs and payrolls
coming to the area with the new
industries.
Other advantages include high
tax return, increased municipal
utility income, and prestige
brought by high-quality devclop-
In addition to choosing the next
president of the United States
Nov. 8, the people of Palo Alto
will he asked to voice their ap
proval or disapproval on the City
Council's action to zone and annex
part of Stanford's land for devel
opment of selected light industry
and its research facilities.
