# Religion Is Valid Issue, Pike Informs Audience
## 
### ROSS HERMANN 
The Right Rev. James A. Pike, Episcopal Bishop of California,
told an overflow audience in Cubberley Auditorium last night that
it is not bigotry but responsible citizenship for a voter to ask a can
didate how he stands in relation to the official position of his church.
If a Mennonite is being considered for Secretary of Defense or a

Christian Scientist for Secretary
of Health, Education, and Wel
fare, it is right, Pike said, that
he be asked if he supports the
views of his church.
IF THEY indicate their support
of their church position, the best
interests of the nation demands
that they be dropped from con
sideration.
In the same way, Pike said, it is
not bigotry to ask a Roman Cath
olic candidate whether for in
stance his views coinf-ide with
that of his church on the issue of
distributing birth control informa
tion.
If the candidate answers to the
satisfaetion of the voter, then the
issue should melt away, he said.
IN A DISCUSSION of church
and state relations, Pike said that
two divergent views exist within
the Catholic Church. The first
and oldest view is that error has
no rights and that the union of
church and state is desirable.
The second view, whieh is of
more recent origin and to which
most American Catholics sub
scribe, is that "error has no rights
but people in error do." This view
also maintains separation of
church and state in the interests
of freedom.
Pike, in a talk that was filled
with humor and subtle observa
tions, touched upon a variety of
subjects.
HE DECRIED the materialism
of the United States, describing
this country as a "nation of glut."
If we should fall because of ma
terialism, God's righteousness will
be vindicated, he said.
People in backwards areas of
the world who have not yet eX
perienced materialism, he said,
have preserved a sense of spirit
ual sensitivity and are shocked
by racial conditions within the
United Slates.
He also said that he is dis
tressed by Ihe un-American ac
tivities of the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Subcommittee.
He attacked the subcommittee
as having gone beyond the limit
of legislative investigation into
the judicial realm. He said that
the legislative function of the
body is justified, but that in ef
fect the committee has been pun
ishing people by means of expo
sure a job that lies only with
