Last Friday Mr. Nixon made a
speech at Beverly Hills on "The
Gravest Problem Confronting
America," which is how to "win
the struggle for peace and free
dom." But there is not one word
in the speech saying what Mr.
Nixon intends to do to win the
struggle. The whole speech is de
voted to describing the machinery
by which Mr. Nixon hopes to find
out how to win the struggle.
The machinery consists of a
series of committees and confer
ences, and of two individuals, Mr.
Eisenhower and Mr. Lodge.
There is to be first of all a com
mittee in the Defense Department
consisting of all the Secretaries
and the Chiefs of Staff who will
tell him, presumably unani
mously, what he should do about
defense. No mention is made of
the fact that what the defense es
tablishment and the country need
most of all is not another con
ference and more investigation,
but decisions by the president, de
cisions about how much to spend,
decisions about which of the serv
ices is to do what. This proposal
to sit back and hope to be told
by the secretaries and the chiefs
of staff is a promise that we ai'e
going to have more of the very
same executive passivity and
weakness which we are now suf
fering from.
This passivity pervades all the
rest of Mr. Nixon's proposals. He
wants to have Mr. Lodge, not the
president himself, act as Supreme
Commander in all the non-mili
tary aspects of the cold war. Be
tween the president and the sec
retary of state, between the pres
ident and the secretary of the
treasury, there is to 1m 1 Mr. Lodge.
He will have no legal authority
whatsoever to conduct the for
eign policy of the United States.
This is a recipe for building into
the Administration jealousy and
confusion.
Next Mr. Nixon would convene
an "extended meeting with per
haps a hundred men and women
representing a cross section of
American life." This mass meet
ing would be supposed to review
and survey and assess the nation's
foreign policy which, says Mr.
Nixon, "would have a significant
impact on the global struggle!"
Next, with an insatiable ap
petite for committees and confer
ences, he would have a series of
regional conferences of all the
free nations of Europe, Latin
America, Africa, and Asia. Their
task would be to strengthen the
United Nations and the free na
tions "politically, economically,
socially, and militarily."
Next, he would ask the NATO
states to strengthen NATO and
to coordinate and direct aid to the
under-developed countries.

Next, he would have a confer
ence ol' the heads of government
of the American republics.
Next, he would have a confer
ence willi Ihe heads of the Asian
states.
To make all this fruitful and
constructive and devastating to
our adversaries he and Mr. Lodge
would participate in all these con
ferences, and so, too, would Gov
ernor Rockefeller if he can find
the time.
This is the way Mr. Nixon pro
poses (<> find out what his foreign
policies ought to l>e. It is a had
way. For committees ami confer
ences do not propose policy. Af
best, they produce flic proposals,
the issues, the choices, among
which the genuine executive
makes his decisions. Ft is highly
significant that never once does
>Ir. Nixon face the fact that the
foreign policy of the United States
is formed hy the decisions of the
president.
This extraordinary array of
committees and conferences is a
device for postponing and evading
the real task of the president
which is to judge and to decide.
The oldest and most hackneyed
device of a weak government is
to appoint a committee and call
a conference.
This revealing speech confirms
the impression that has grown
stronger since Ihe TV debates
began. It is that Mr. Nixon is an
indecisive man who lacks that
inner conviction and self-confi
dence which are the mark of the
natural leader and governor of
men.
This has appeared most clearly
in the Quemoy-Matsu affair. Mr.
Nixon has exhibited a lack of
knowledge of the facts of a great
question of war and peace, about
which he is supposed to have had
first hand knowledge. In the sec
ond debate he did not know what
the Eisenhower policy was, and he
had to be re-educated for the third
debate. This is most significant
because it reveals such a weak,
infirm, inaccurate grasp of a
great issue.
The contrast with Mr. Kennedy
has become very sharp. It has
been truly impressive to see the
precision of Mr. Kennedy's mind,
his immense command of the
facts, his instinct for the crucial
point, his singular lack of dema
goguery and slogan eering, his in
tense concern and interest in the
subject itself, the stability and
steadfastness of his nerves and
his coolness and his courage. And
through it all have transpired the
recognizable marks of the man
who, besides being highly trained,
is a natural leader, organizer, and
ruler of men.
