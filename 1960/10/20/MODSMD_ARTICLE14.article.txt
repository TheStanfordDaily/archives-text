# Failure of Militarism
## 
### HOWARD RICHARDS Socialist Caucus 
(Editor's Note: This is a reply
to "The Failure of Containment"
by Peter Erickson of the Con
servative Caucus.)

Mr. Erickson correctly points
out that a half-hearted, shifting
and indefinite militarist policy
will not work. Eventually one side
will miscalculate a risk so that
the other will feel compelled to
attack. If we are to depend on
the present policy of peace
through terror, it is best to pin
point exactly the line we will not
permit the enemy to cross.
BUT, when we have determined
to be absolutely and not partially
ruthless, when we have declared
the most ultimate of all possible
ultimatums, the most holy and
terrible of all possible terrifying
pronouncements, what may we
expect? We will have narrowed
the possibilities to one inevitable
result: war.
An iron fist may postpone war
hut. it will not prevent war. Does
anyone doubt that sooner or later
the Chinese will attack Formosa?
Does anyone deny that sooner or
later a missile will fire acci
dently? An ultimatum from
Barry Goldwater cannot freeze
history in its tracks.
A MILITARIST POLICY IS A
SURRENDER OF HOPE.
There is only one possible justi
fication for committing ourselves
to eventual war a value judg
ment that it is better to end every
thing than to live under com
munism. I believe that, a com
munist world would be better
than war. And if anyone holds the
contrary I demand to know by
whose authority, with what de
vine credentials, he presumes to
declare the conditions under
which the human race ought lo
be sentenced to death.
1 am opposed to totalitarianism.

I will oppose il with the pen and
the voice. I will support disarma
ment, I will oppose communism
by civil disobedience, by sabotage,
and by strikes. I will oppose total
itarianism by irying to build a
truly democratic way of life. But
I will not oppose communism
with nuclear murder.
I cannot guarantee that these
non-violent methods will work,
though I believe that they will.
My choice is that if iion-violen<
methods will not work I would
rather have communism (and
life).
We must realize that we are nol
dealing with chess pieces, nor
"strategy," nor "policies." We are
facing the awesome responsibil
ity of deciding the fate of life
that has taken eons to evolve.
Men, women, boys, girls, pine
trees, flowers, antelope, and each
and every living thing are Ihe
subjects of our discussion.
The important struggle is not
between economic systems but be-
Iween humanity and inhumanity.
As Kenneth Rexroth said in his
talk to the Socialist Caucus, Ihe
important issues are no longer
political, but moral.
For example, the slaughter of
Hungarian workers by Russian
soldiers does not tell us anything
about the value of communism as
an economic system. It does tell
us something about the inhuman
ity of man to man. Similarly, the
unnecessary bombing of Hiro
shima and Nagasaki is irrelevant
to the value of capitalism, or of
democracy. Hiroshima is an in
dictment of the inhumanity of
certain human beings towards
certain other human beings.
For myself. I would prefer to
abolish capitalism, communism,
democratic socialism and every
economic or political system our
forebcarers ever devised or im
agined rather than drop a single
bomb.

munism. I believe that, a com

1 am opposed to totalitarianism.

I will oppose il with the pen and
the voice. I will support disarma
ment, I will oppose communism
by civil disobedience, by sabotage,
and by strikes. I will oppose total
itarianism by irying to build a
truly democratic way of life. But
I will not oppose communism
with nuclear murder.
I cannot guarantee that these
non-violent methods will work,
though I believe that they will.
My choice is that if iion-violen<
methods will not work I would
rather have communism (and
life).
We must realize that we are nol
dealing with chess pieces, nor
"strategy," nor "policies." We are
facing the awesome responsibil
ity of deciding the fate of life
that has taken eons to evolve.
Men, women, boys, girls, pine
trees, flowers, antelope, and each
and every living thing are Ihe
subjects of our discussion.
The important struggle is not
between economic systems but be-
Iween humanity and inhumanity.
As Kenneth Rexroth said in his
talk to the Socialist Caucus, Ihe
important issues are no longer
political, but moral.
For example, the slaughter of
Hungarian workers by Russian
soldiers does not tell us anything
about the value of communism as
an economic system. It does tell
us something about the inhuman
ity of man to man. Similarly, the
unnecessary bombing of Hiro
shima and Nagasaki is irrelevant
to the value of capitalism, or of
democracy. Hiroshima is an in
dictment of the inhumanity of
certain human beings towards
certain other human beings.
For myself. I would prefer to
abolish capitalism, communism,
democratic socialism and every
economic or political system our
forebcarers ever devised or im
agined rather than drop a single
bomb.

Mr. Erickson correctly points
out that a half-hearted, shifting
and indefinite militarist policy
will not work. Eventually one side
will miscalculate a risk so that
the other will feel compelled to
attack. If we are to depend on
the present policy of peace
through terror, it is best to pin
point exactly the line we will not
permit the enemy to cross.
BUT, when we have determined
to be absolutely and not partially
ruthless, when we have declared
the most ultimate of all possible
ultimatums, the most holy and
terrible of all possible terrifying
pronouncements, what may we
expect? We will have narrowed
the possibilities to one inevitable
result: war.
An iron fist may postpone war
hut. it will not prevent war. Does
anyone doubt that sooner or later
the Chinese will attack Formosa?
Does anyone deny that sooner or
later a missile will fire acci
dently? An ultimatum from
Barry Goldwater cannot freeze
history in its tracks.
A MILITARIST POLICY IS A
SURRENDER OF HOPE.
There is only one possible justi
fication for committing ourselves
