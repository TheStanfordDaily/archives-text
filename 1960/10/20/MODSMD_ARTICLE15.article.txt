Editor, the Daily:
First of all, my congratulations
on the general quality of your ed
itorials. I do not always agree
with your particular stand, but I
respect your usually perspica
cious comments.
A letter appeared in the Daily on
October 19 which stated: "De
emphasized football at Stanford
1 ) would not pay for all the other
sports in which we now very
successfully compote, 2> would
kill such traditions as Big Game,
3) cannot honorably "save" us
from such games already sched
uled as Notre Dnme (1963), 4)
would be a slap in the face to two
god frosh teams in a row, and i)
is entirely unjustified."
1 would argue against these
statements on these grounds: 1)
It should not be football's respon
sibility to pay for these other
sports. If it is true as commonly
regarded that athletics are of
value for a well rounded educa
tion, then the University should
pay for them. Further, I suspect
that over-emphasized football is
not so tremendously profitable
when the expenses of further per
petuating ii are subtracted. Fin
ally, as has been pointed out
many times, numerous large uni
versities support an adequate,
well-balanced, athletic program
without the benefit of fat foot
ball profits. 2) Big Game tradi
tion arose in an era when football
was uncorrupted by commercial
ism. There seems to be no reason
to assume that it cannot continue
without the "services" of high
powered football. Indeed, mean
ingful tradition, and the use of
football as entertainment for the
masses who feel no particular
bond to either university, are
scarcely compatible. In any case,
I believe Ihat even if Stanford lost
every game all year (a not un
likely possibility this year, inci
dently!) spirit would still be as
high come Big Game time. 3) I do
not know Ihe way "honorable"
is interpreted by the writers of
the letter, but I can see no partic
ular loss of honor involved with
deciding to de-emphasize football.
If indeed, the difficulties involved
in changing a schedule two years
in cfrlvance preclude that change,
let's wait until 1964 to de-empha
size. But let's plan for it now. 4)
As for the "slap in the face" to the
frosh teams, I don't see the harm
to them in arranging for them
to play against teams which truly
represent their respective col
leges, rather than against over
emphasized teams whose only
goal is to amass victories. 5) I
don't quite know how to deal with
their premise that de-emphasizing
football would be "entirely un
justified" as they neglected to
supply any grounds for it. It is a
very nice phrase, but unfortu
nately meaningless by itself.
The writers of the quoted letter
go on to say that. "Washington
may admit some students who

couldn't make it on the Farm, but
a prep player with a choice would
come here . . Evidently a few
prep players decided to go to
Washington rather than here as
evidenced by the results of the
Stanford-Washington game.

Editor, (lie Daily:
It was in keeping with the mod
est character of Dr. Henry Blauth
to request no funeral. To those of
us who were fortunate enough to
have studied under Herr Blauth,
his loss was indeed an immense
calamity.
He symbolized to his students
the very "geist" of the Stanford
motto: "die Luft der Freiheit
weht!" From his lectures about
the evils of Mickey Spillane to his
endearing love of Goethe's
"Faust," he inspired his pupils to
search for beauty and sincerity
in life.
We will miss him.

Editor, the Daily:
Not the least important func
tion of a university lies in en
couraging political interest and
social conscience among its stu
dent population. When a univer
sity neglects this function, it be
trays a vital responsibility to
wards Ihe academic community
and fosters that apathetic con
formity which corrodes much of
American intellectual life.
Such is the category into which
Stanford University apparently
falls. Regulations which prohibit

partisan organizations on the
Stanford campus inevitably con
demn student political activity to
a mode of sterility. These rules
disclose two basic doubts which
apparently haunt the administra
tion. First, they reveal a mis
trust of the democratic tradition
that optimal decisions can be
reached only when all ideas are
free to compete for the minds of
men. Secondly, they imply doubts
concerning the ability of students
to distinguish between propa
ganda and information.
Surely the administration could
manifest greater faith in both the
wisdom of democracy and the ma
turity of the student body?
The task of interpreting the
above regulation falls to the
LASSU. The criteria used by this
organization in deciding whether
or not to sanction various groups
seem rather arbitrary at best.
Concern for Stanford's monetary
welfare rather than its intellec
tual integrity apparently provides
the main consideration, while ex
treme reluctance prevails with re
spect to recognizing any group
which might stimulate contro
versy.
These attitudes paralyze the
student government's independent
initiative and force abdication of
those responsibilities entrusted to
it by the electorate. Under Ihe
guise of cooperation, the LASSU
operates as a mere stooge for the
Stanford administration hier
archy which issues the final ver
dicts.
Last Thursday night a group of

Stanford students petitioned the
LASSU to recognize a Stanford
Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
From the very outset, officers of
the LASSU made it obvious that
due consideration would not be
given 1 his proposal. Every effort
was directed towards stifling de
bate and preventing individual
legislators from hearing argu
ments in favor of the proposal. A
letter from the Dean proclaiming
the Fair Play for Cuba Commit
tee as inconsistent with Stanford
University interests, was intro
duced as negative evidence.
The response to this procla
mation was complete acquies
cence. Not one voice was raised to
question why the Fair Play Com
mittee was inconsistent with Stan
ford University policy. Not one in
quiry was made as to how it

would conflict, with important
values. Not one protest was reg
istered against ihe high-handed
manner in which the entire affair
was conducted.
We who have devoted our ener
gies towards establishing a Stan
ford Fair Play for Cuba Commit
tee resent Ihe unquestioning sub
servience of the LASSU. We re
sent its cowardly refusal to de
part from stereotyped lines of
thought. We resent its pompous
concern with the fiscal situation
of Stanford University. Be it ever
so puny, we hereby record our
protest against the bureaucratic
restriction of political activity at
Stanford, and register a plea on
behalf of genuine academic free
dom.
