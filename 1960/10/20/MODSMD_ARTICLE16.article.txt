### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
Familiar Face in a New .lob
JOHN HKODIi: I'lNAUA got his chance. Well known for his
fjuai terbacking heroics on (he Farm in ihc 1 seasons, holdei
of ihe current Stanford total passing yardage record and a topflight
professional golfer, John has been something less than a star foi
Ihe San Francisco liters in the National Football League.
The fault wasn't John'-s. He was merely in the uncomfortable po
sition of playing for the same team as Y. A. Tittle, a tried and proven
veteran who managed to keep a firm grip on the number one quarter
back slot for the three seasons that junior John has worn the jersey
of the city pros.
Others tried to take over signal calling duties. Bobby Neumnn.
Ihe Washington Slate ace, was

one of the most notable college
stars who tried and failed.
JOHN HAD ihe unusual distinc
tion of being one of the highest
paid part time workers around.
When Brodie did play it was in
exhibition games or one-sided
losses or during the rare occa
sions when V. A. experienced a
liitle slump. In fact, during the
I its l few league encounters, John
hadn't done a lick of work.
But the breaks had to come
and finally, last week in a league
game against the Detroit Lions,
John Brodie got the nod. He
stepped in for a faltering Tittle
and brought the 49ers from a 10-
0 deficit to a 14-10 win mainly
through a spectacular passing dis
play in the last few minutes.
After Tittle had been unable to
manuver Ihe eleven lo a score,

Brodie was sent in with little more than seven minutes of play re
maining. Then the fireworks began. Brortie farted hack and connected
on a 19-yard pass to end Billy Wilson just two and a half minutes
before the final gun.
Time Had Run Out
Tin: FINAL SCORF w \s even more spectacular. It was "Brodie
again with the clock showing 0:00 left, this time passing to R. C.
Owens, the fabulous 19er "alley-oop" specialist, and the play was
good for 18 yards, a touchdown and a win.
Din ing his brief stint John completed eight passes in 13 attempts
tor 105 yards and ran for an additional 29; his total was 30 yards
more than V, A.'s output for all the rest of the game.
I hat was enough for 49er head coach Red Hiekey for, despite
some rumored differences of opinion between the two, the Irishman
installed John as starting signal caller against the ever-powerful
Chicago Bears. However, this promotion to the top .spot could hardly
be considered permanent. True, a good performance against the
Bears would virtually insure the Stanford star of the favored posi
tion. but an average or mediocre day would put him right back on
the bench, waiting for his next "big chance."
How did John do?
HF DIDN' T TTHN IN a top-notch job but his play shouldn't drop
him out of the starting role either. Although the 49ers lost, 27-10.
the fault was more the defense than the offense. The Bears ran only
35 plays from scrimmage but each went for an average of 6.6 yards
and those 27 points came on a fumble recovery coupled with a .57-
yai'd runback. runs of 61 and 37 yards and a 91-yard pass play.

Brortie completed 14 out of 26
pass attempts for 107 yards and
he picked up five more on the
ground while playing 54 minutes
in the contest. Ho kept the 49ers
moving, picking up 23 first
downs; his biggest drawback was
ihe inability to push the team
across Ihe goal.
AI.F IN ALL it was a satisfying
game for the Stanford slinger.
Coach Hiekey expressed confi
dence in the new team leader
after Sunday's fray with Chicago
and opposing mentor, George
Halas declared that Brodie had
the substance of a pro quarter
back.
It looks like the local boy might
be all set to begin where he left
off t hree years ago.
