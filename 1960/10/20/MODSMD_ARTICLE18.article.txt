# Indians Bid for Upset
## Daily Sports 
### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
•STANFORD just might enter
the Coliseum Saturday night with
a super secret weapon thai will
shock the unsuspecting Bruins
right out of the baby blues.
The weapon? The dream of
every Don Juan and Card fan
the completed pass.
It's no secret that the Indians
throw an occasional football dur
ing the course of a game, but if
UCLA had any scouts at last
weekend's San Jose game it will
coine as one large surprise to
them if Stanford is able to con
nect on their throws for big yard
age. Card quarterbacks were able
to complete only eight passes
against the Spartans, many more
throws bouncing off the hands of
Ihe intended receivers.
COACH JACK Curtice had the
team running pass pattern after
pass pattern in yesterday's prac
tice session in an effort to cure
the fumbleitis that struck Stan
ford ends in their last game. At
the same time ihe Card mentor
stressed pass defense, another
weak spot in the San Jose fray.
Talent wise, Ihe local boys
would seem to be set in the throw
ing department with last year's
national pass champion Dick Nor*

•STANFORD just might enter
the Coliseum Saturday night with
a super secret weapon thai will
shock the unsuspecting Bruins
right out of the baby blues.
The weapon? The dream of
every Don Juan and Card fan
the completed pass.
It's no secret that the Indians
throw an occasional football dur
ing the course of a game, but if
UCLA had any scouts at last
weekend's San Jose game it will
coine as one large surprise to
them if Stanford is able to con
nect on their throws for big yard
age. Card quarterbacks were able
to complete only eight passes
against the Spartans, many more
throws bouncing off the hands of
Ihe intended receivers.
COACH JACK Curtice had the
team running pass pattern after
pass pattern in yesterday's prac
tice session in an effort to cure
the fumbleitis that struck Stan
ford ends in their last game. At
the same time ihe Card mentor
stressed pass defense, another
weak spot in the San Jose fray.
