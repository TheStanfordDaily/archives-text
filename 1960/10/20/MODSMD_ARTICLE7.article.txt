# Castro Charges U.S. With Planned Invasion of Cuba
## Communique to U.N. Accuses Embassy of Espionage 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (UPI> Cuban Premier Fidel Castro
told the General Assembly in a communique made public yesterday
the United States' Government was preparing to mount a "large
scale invasion" against Cuba "within the next few days."
A document circulated among U.N. members accused the U.S.

| Embassy of espionage and said an
i American plane already had be
gun dropping arms and supplies
| to guerrilla force* for a beach
head he said the UJS. Government
1 was preparing.
The communique directly ac
cused the State Department, the
Pentagon and "U.S. monopolies"
of organizing the full-scale at
tack but left unclear whether ii
was expected to be carried out
by uniformed U.S. troops or pri
vate citizens supported by the
government.
THE INVASION claim was con
! tained in a memorandum explain
ing Castro's request that the Gen
eral Assembly place on its agenda
for urgent action a Cuban "com
plaint . . . regarding the various
plans of aggression and acts of
1 intervention being executed by
1 the United States."
"According to reliable informa
! tion in the possession of the Cu
ban authorities (the invasioni
! will be attempted within the next
; few days," it said.
The document did not say ex
i actly where the invasion was ex
! pected to come from but charged
a smaller invasion force composed
lof "mercenaries" had invaded
j Cuban territory earlier this month
; in a shrimp boat flying Ihe U.S.
| flag and coming from "Florida,
i the United States."
IT ALSO charged that a four
j engine aircraft clearly marked
' with U.S. insignia and flown by
! U.S. airmen made a preliminary
j arms drop in Las Villas province
i Sept. 26 as a prelude to the inva
| sion.
This was believed the first time
! the Castro regime has ever ac
| cused the U.S. military personnel
! of taking direct part in hostile op
j erations against Cuba. Previously
j the premier has limited his de
nunciations to "mercenaries" or
"war criminals" in the pay of the
U.S. Government.
The Cuban memorandum said
the United States was attempting
to obscure its "aggressive de
signs" under the "mendacious pre
text" that Cuba is a base of inter
national communism.
'This typical cold war policy,
based on the sordid business of
anti-communism (and) being con
ducted by one of the world's
greatest powers ... is causing an
immediate threat to an interna
tional peace and security," it said.
IT CLAIMED this danger was
all the greater because the United
States hoped to "reconvert" Cuba
into a U.S. satellite and was mak
ing the island part of its overall
strategy against the Soviet Union.
Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khru
shchev had threatened to send
Russian rockets against the
; United States in the event of out
; right military aggression against
j Cuba.
The communique mentioned the
! U.S. trade embargo slapped
, against Cuba at noon today as
! part of the "proof" that an inva
! sion was imminent. It also called
j attention to a recent State De
partment recommendation for
: U.S. citizens to leave the island
; unless they have urgent business
there.
U.S. OFFICIALS had no im
mediate comment on the invasion
| charge, although its implied ur
gency caused a stir even among
delegations inclined to dismiss
Castro's rep e a Ie d allegations
i against the United Slates.
Making the situation more
i tense was an official U.S. docu
' ment presented to Secretary-Gen
eral Dag Hammarsk.jold last week
j which alerted the United Nations
! for possible violence over Amer
ica's big Guantanamo, Cuba Naval
! Base.
The U.S. statement said Castro
seemed intent on "provoking an
incident" at the strategic Carib
bean base.
1 This and other U.S. charges
were dismissed as "strewn with
obvious falsehood' in the Cuban
i memorandum released today.
