# U.S. Bans Shipments To Cuba

### 
' WASHINGTON (UPI) â€” The
i government aimed a sledgeham
mer blow at Fidel Castro's anti-
U.S. regime yesterday by banning
the shipment to Cuba of nearly all
commodities except medicines and
certain foods.
Cuba, which has relied on the
United States for nearly 75 per
cent of its imports, charged that
the action violated the charter of
the Organization of American
I States (OAS>. The United States
i said it acted only after provoca
] tion by Cuba.
A UPI dispatch from Havana
I said Cuban seizures of American
business interests were forecast
as the result of yesterday's action
in Washington. The dispatch said
American residents in Cuba were
preparing for the worst in the
light of Castro's oft-voice threat
of an "eye-for-an-eye" retaliation
against each new American act.
A forecast of drastic Cuban ac
tion was also made by Robert C.
Hill, U.S. ambassador to Mexico.
In a speech to the American Le
gion convention in Miami. Hill
said "do not be surprised" if Cas
tro makes some move against the
United States before election day,
acting on instructions from Mos-j
I cow or Peiping. He said this might I
i be a move against the U.S. Naval
base at Guantanamo in Cuba.
THE CUBANS themselves, in
a communique to the United N'a
: tions, claimed the U.S. govern
ment was preparing to mount a
j"1 a rg e scale invasion" against !
I Cuba "within the next few days." j
! The communique mentioned to
: day's economic crackdown as!
j "proof" that an invasion was!
; imminent.
The crackdown, which included
tighter restrictions on sale or j
transfer of U.S. ships to Cuba,
was more drastic than the export I
: curbs this country maintains on I
trade with Russia. It was not as,
tough as the complete boycott on
i Red China trade.
The U.S. move, ordered by the !
commerce department, will cut
off Cuba from the flow of ma
chines and replacement parts it
i needs to run many of the island's I
> Ameriean-e quip pe d industries j
which Castro seized from their J
j U.S. owners.
The State Department said in I
a statement that the embargo was
(ordered "reluctantly" to protect
i U.S. businessmen against the "dis
criminatory, aggressive and in
jurious economic policies" of the
Castro government.
