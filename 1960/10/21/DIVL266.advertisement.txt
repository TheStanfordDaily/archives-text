TORT
Pride of the law school,
Blackstone has never lost a
moot trial. But there's noth
ing moot about his prefer
ences in dress. He finds that
when he's comfortable, he
can trap a witness and sway
a jury like Clarence Darrow.
So he always wears Jockey
brand briefs while preparing
his briefs. Exclusive Jockey
tailoring gives him a bonus
of comfort he gets in no other
underwear. Fine Jockey
combed cotton is more ab
sorbent, smoother fit ting, too.
