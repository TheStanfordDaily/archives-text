"HOME SWEET HOMECOMING"
A great number of people have been uskinir me lately, "What
is Homecoming?" but I have been so busy trying to find out
why my new sports car leaks that I haven't had time to answer.
I am now pleased to report that 1 finally discovered why my
sports car leaks—l have been driving it upside down—and so
1 am ready today to turn my attention to Homecoming.
Let's begin with definitions. Homecoming is a weekend when
<>hl grads return to their alma maters to watch a football game,
visit old classrooms and dormitories and inspect each other's
bald spots.
The weekend is marked by the singing of old songs, the slap
ping of old backs and the frequent exchange of such greetings
as "Harry, you old polecat!" or "Harry, you old porcupine! '
or "Harry, you old rooster!" or "Harry, you old wombat!"
As you can see, all old grads arc named Harrv.
It is not just old grads who behave with such liveliness during
Homecoming; the faculty also comports itself with unaccus
tomed animation. Teachers laugh and smile and pound backs
and keep shouting "Harry,you old Airedale!" This unscholarlv
behavior is carried on in the hope tlint old grads, in a transport
of bonhomie will endow a new geology building.
The old grads, however, are seldom seduced. By game time
on Saturday their backs are so sore, their eyeballs so eroded,
their extremities so frayed, that it is impossible to get a kind
word out of them, much less a new geology building.
Even the football game does not improve their tempers,
"llnnnph!" they snort as the home team completes a 101-vard
march to a touchdown. "Do you call that football? W hv, back
in mv day, they'd have been over on the first down! By
(leorge, football was football in those days—not this namby
pamby girls game that passes for football today! lake a look
at that bench 50 substitutes sitting there. Why, in my day,
there were 11 men on a team and that was it. When you broke
a leg, they slapped a piece of tape on it and you went right back
in. Why, I remember the big game against State. Harry Siga
t'oos, our star quarterback, was killed in the third quarter. I
mean, he was pronounced dead. But did that stop old Harry.'
Not on your tintype! Back in he went and kicked the winning
drop kick in the last four seconds of play, dead a,s he was. Back
in my day, they played football, by George!"
Everything, say the old grads, was better back iri their day—
everything except one. Even the most unreconstructed of the
old grads has to admit that back in his day they never had a
smoke like Marlboro—never a cigarette with such a lot to like
- never a filter so easy drawing, a flavor so mild yet hearty, so
abundant, so bountiful—never a choice of flip-top box or soft
] tack.
So old grads. young grads, and undergrade, why don't you
settle back and have a full-flavored smoke? Try Marlboro, the
filtered cigarette with the unfiltered taste, and Homecoming
will b<< a happy occasion and the sun will shine and the air will
be filled with the murmur of wings and no man's hand will be
raised against you.

sports car leaks—l have been driving it upside down—and so
1 am ready today to turn my attention to Homecoming.
Let's begin with definitions. Homecoming is a weekend when
<>hl grads return to their alma maters to watch a football game,
visit old classrooms and dormitories and inspect each other's
bald spots.
The weekend is marked by the singing of old songs, the slap
ping of old backs and the frequent exchange of such greetings
as "Harry, you old polecat!" or "Harry, you old porcupine! '
or "Harry, you old rooster!" or "Harry, you old wombat!"
As you can see, all old grads arc named Harrv.
It is not just old grads who behave with such liveliness during
Homecoming; the faculty also comports itself with unaccus
tomed animation. Teachers laugh and smile and pound backs
and keep shouting "Harry,you old Airedale!" This unscholarlv
behavior is carried on in the hope tlint old grads, in a transport
of bonhomie will endow a new geology building.
The old grads, however, are seldom seduced. By game time
on Saturday their backs are so sore, their eyeballs so eroded,
their extremities so frayed, that it is impossible to get a kind
word out of them, much less a new geology building.
Even the football game does not improve their tempers,
"llnnnph!" they snort as the home team completes a 101-vard
march to a touchdown. "Do you call that football? W hv, back
in mv day, they'd have been over on the first down! By
(leorge, football was football in those days—not this namby
pamby girls game that passes for football today! lake a look
at that bench 50 substitutes sitting there. Why, in my day,
there were 11 men on a team and that was it. When you broke
a leg, they slapped a piece of tape on it and you went right back
in. Why, I remember the big game against State. Harry Siga
t'oos, our star quarterback, was killed in the third quarter. I
mean, he was pronounced dead. But did that stop old Harry.'
Not on your tintype! Back in he went and kicked the winning
drop kick in the last four seconds of play, dead a,s he was. Back
in my day, they played football, by George!"
Everything, say the old grads, was better back iri their day—
everything except one. Even the most unreconstructed of the
old grads has to admit that back in his day they never had a
smoke like Marlboro—never a cigarette with such a lot to like
- never a filter so easy drawing, a flavor so mild yet hearty, so
abundant, so bountiful—never a choice of flip-top box or soft
] tack.
So old grads. young grads, and undergrade, why don't you
settle back and have a full-flavored smoke? Try Marlboro, the
filtered cigarette with the unfiltered taste, and Homecoming
will b<< a happy occasion and the sun will shine and the air will
be filled with the murmur of wings and no man's hand will be
raised against you.

As you can see, all old grads arc named Harrv.
It is not just old grads who behave with such liveliness during
Homecoming; the faculty also comports itself with unaccus
tomed animation. Teachers laugh and smile and pound backs
and keep shouting "Harry,you old Airedale!" This unscholarlv
behavior is carried on in the hope tlint old grads, in a transport
of bonhomie will endow a new geology building.
The old grads, however, are seldom seduced. By game time
on Saturday their backs are so sore, their eyeballs so eroded,
their extremities so frayed, that it is impossible to get a kind
word out of them, much less a new geology building.
Even the football game does not improve their tempers,
"llnnnph!" they snort as the home team completes a 101-vard
march to a touchdown. "Do you call that football? W hv, back
in mv day, they'd have been over on the first down! By
(leorge, football was football in those days—not this namby
pamby girls game that passes for football today! lake a look
at that bench 50 substitutes sitting there. Why, in my day,
there were 11 men on a team and that was it. When you broke
a leg, they slapped a piece of tape on it and you went right back
in. Why, I remember the big game against State. Harry Siga
t'oos, our star quarterback, was killed in the third quarter. I
mean, he was pronounced dead. But did that stop old Harry.'
Not on your tintype! Back in he went and kicked the winning
drop kick in the last four seconds of play, dead a,s he was. Back
in my day, they played football, by George!"
Everything, say the old grads, was better back iri their day—
everything except one. Even the most unreconstructed of the
old grads has to admit that back in his day they never had a
smoke like Marlboro—never a cigarette with such a lot to like
- never a filter so easy drawing, a flavor so mild yet hearty, so
abundant, so bountiful—never a choice of flip-top box or soft
] tack.
So old grads. young grads, and undergrade, why don't you
settle back and have a full-flavored smoke? Try Marlboro, the
filtered cigarette with the unfiltered taste, and Homecoming
will b<< a happy occasion and the sun will shine and the air will
be filled with the murmur of wings and no man's hand will be
raised against you.

"HOME SWEET HOMECOMING"
A great number of people have been uskinir me lately, "What
is Homecoming?" but I have been so busy trying to find out
why my new sports car leaks that I haven't had time to answer.
I am now pleased to report that 1 finally discovered why my
sports car leaks—l have been driving it upside down—and so
1 am ready today to turn my attention to Homecoming.
Let's begin with definitions. Homecoming is a weekend when
<>hl grads return to their alma maters to watch a football game,
visit old classrooms and dormitories and inspect each other's
bald spots.
The weekend is marked by the singing of old songs, the slap
ping of old backs and the frequent exchange of such greetings
as "Harry, you old polecat!" or "Harry, you old porcupine! '
or "Harry, you old rooster!" or "Harry, you old wombat!"
As you can see, all old grads arc named Harrv.
It is not just old grads who behave with such liveliness during
Homecoming; the faculty also comports itself with unaccus
tomed animation. Teachers laugh and smile and pound backs
and keep shouting "Harry,you old Airedale!" This unscholarlv
behavior is carried on in the hope tlint old grads, in a transport
of bonhomie will endow a new geology building.
