# President Hits Out at Kennedy
## 
### MAYNARD PARKER Managing Editor 
SAN FRANCISCO In a fight
ing partisan speech on a non
partisan tour, President Dwight
D. Eisenhower last night scored
Democratic nominee Sen. John F.
Kennedy by warning some 1,800
Commonwealth Club members
and a local television audience of
thousands not to be "misled by
those who, inexplicably, seem so
fond of depreciating the standing,
condition, and performance of the
entire country."
Never calling Kennedy by name,
Eisenhower emphasized that "we
must avoid smugness and com
placency.
"BUT," III'; continued, "when in
face of a bright record of prog
ress and development, we hear
some misguided people wail that
the United States is stumbling
into the status of a second-class
power and that our prestige has
slumped to an all-time low, we
are simply listening to debase
ment of the truth."
The president also hit at Ken
nedy's campaign issue that the
country, economically, is not
growing fast enough.
He called Kennedy's statistics,
"counterfeit comparisons," and
labeled as "irresponsible" Ken
nedy's economic comparison of
the U.S. and Russia.
USING an illustration to make
his point, he explained that, "if
a village has a single telephone,
the acquisition of another in a
single year is a 100 per cent in
crease in growth. In a mature
society, such increases are neces
sarily measured in fractions of
the whole."
Eisenhower foresaw a future
Kennedy administration as one
thai would "scorn fiscal control
and assign to a centralized gov
ernment responsibility for all
progress."
He urged the audience to choose
an "experienced and mature lead
ership; leadership which recog
nizes that sound policy arises out
of the inner wisdom and experi
ence of countless communities
through America."

some misguided people wail that
the United States is stumbling
into the status of a second-class
power and that our prestige has
slumped to an all-time low, we
are simply listening to debase
ment of the truth."
The president also hit at Ken
nedy's campaign issue that the
country, economically, is not
growing fast enough.
He called Kennedy's statistics,
"counterfeit comparisons," and
labeled as "irresponsible" Ken
nedy's economic comparison of
the U.S. and Russia.
USING an illustration to make
his point, he explained that, "if
a village has a single telephone,
the acquisition of another in a
single year is a 100 per cent in
crease in growth. In a mature
society, such increases are neces
sarily measured in fractions of
the whole."
Eisenhower foresaw a future
Kennedy administration as one
thai would "scorn fiscal control
and assign to a centralized gov
ernment responsibility for all
progress."
He urged the audience to choose
an "experienced and mature lead
ership; leadership which recog
nizes that sound policy arises out
of the inner wisdom and experi
ence of countless communities
through America."
