Angeles to cover the Stanford-UCLA game. Read his report in

It's a big traditional game and they're up.
That flat, show-nothing Stanford team of last week has been
seething all week and the Indians are set to explode when they meet
the 18*'2-point favorite UCLA Bruins in the Los Angeles Coliseum
at 8:15 tomorrow evening.
This is a rivalry that began in 1925 when Stanford tromped
UCLA, 82-0. and the Inst Stanford win was in 1958, this time a 21-19
squeaker in favor of the Farm.
It's hard to get excited; it's hard to even think that the home
club will have a ghost of a chance against UCLA. Every week the
oracles point to the Indians as possible upset victors and every week
the upset fails to materialize. True, the Farm hands have turned
in some good games but they've never been ahead when the final
gun went off.
LAST YVI:i:K WASHINGTON tipped UCLA. I<>-8. in a game com
pletely dominated by the Bruins in every department except scoring.
The Los Angeleans pushed into the visitor's territory nine times,
three times past the Husky ten, but they only managed to score
once.
This was the first loss for the smogland citizens and they re
sponded by vowing to win every remaining game on their schedule.
Stanford is the first team to test that vow.
Besides desire, the host squad has one of the strongest football
teams on the coast. Previously they beat Pittsburgh. 8-7, and then
fought Big Ten power Purdue to ;i 27-27 standoff.
But the Farm squad, alter losing to San Jose State. 34-20. and
