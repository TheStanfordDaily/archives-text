the United States consider seizure
as payment for some of the vast
the United States.
Kennedy charged in a state

i F. Kennedy yesterday urged that
of all Cuban assets in this country
sums of money which Cuba owes
iment that the administration's
action in cutting off exports to
Cuba would have "virtually no
effect by itself in removing Com
munist rule from Cuba."
Hl5 described the "New Cuba
Policy" of his Republican oppo
nent, Vice President Richard M.
Nixon, as "too little and too late."
Kennedy suggested the seizure
of Cuban assets in the United
Stales as one of four steps neces
sary to combat the inroads of
Communism on the "very door
step" of this country.
"Of course, Cuban assets in
this country—which were an esti
mated 200 million dollars in June
—have declined drastically in the
last months as the Republicans
have let this potential opportun
ity slip away," Kennedy said.
During a busy day that includ
ed boning up for his TV debate
tonight, Kennedy sandwiched in
a two-hour campaign appearance

The fourth Nixon-Kennedy de
bate will be televised tonight on
stations KRON-TV (Channel 4),
KPIX (5) and KGO-TV (7) from
10 to 11 p.m. Radio stations KCBS
and KGO will broadcast the de
bate at t> p.m., and KNBC at 7:30

in Brooklyn and also accused
Nixon of making 13 "glaring
errors" in his 13-point "white
paper" that accused the Demo
cratic nominee of inaccuracies.
KENNEDY charged that the
Eisenhower Administration had
done nothing in the last two years
to keep Castro from consolidat
ing his regime and beginning
subversive activities throughout
Latin America.
"Following blunder after blun
der, defeat after defeat, the Re
publicans decide to combat Com
munism by cutting off exports
long after the time has passed
when such a move might have
had a really significant impact
long after our Cuban exports
have declined drastically - and
long after, as Mr. Nixon must
privately recognize, Mr. Castro
himself had already embarked on
a deliberate program to cut down
American exports."
IN HIS reply to Nixon's "while
paper," Kennedy again brought
up his dispute with Nixon over
the defense of the Chinese Na
tionalist islands of Quemoy and
Matsu.
Nixon accused Kennedy in his
document of incompletely quot
ing a letter on the subject from
President Eisenhower to Sen.
Theodore Francis Green, D-R.1.,
then chairman of the Senate For
eign Relations Committee.
