Legislature last night voted
$375 to buy 2,000 new cards for
the Stanford rooting section after
being told that without the cards
there could be no stunts at Big
Game.
Dave Kelly, director of card
stunts for Rally Com, asked
LASSU to okay the expenditure
because the normal attrition rate
of 100 cards a game sailed to
1,000 losses at the San Jose State
contest.
He declared the loss of cards at
the game, which saw the Spartans
trounce the Indians 34-20, was
just about the worst ever.
SEVERAL members of LASSU
voiced concern over the careless
ness of students in the rooting
section who throw cards.
At least two children were hit
by flying cards at the game, and
a law suit was threatened for a
while by relatives of one of them.
Kelly, in arguing for the money,
said that Stanford has the largest
card section on the Pacific Coast
and that the only way it would be
possible to have stunts at the USC
game for Homecoming next Sat
urday would be to cut down the
size of the card section, which
would be an undesired blow to
Farm prestige.
Representative Nan Sherwood
was the only one to vote against
the resolution. She felt the pos
sibility of a cut-down section
should be looked into, and that
students should be told bluntly to
quit throwing cards.
IN AN unusually speedy 55-
minute meeting, LASSU also
handed Farm pedestrians another
victory in the continuing battle
between feet and wheels.
A resolution was unanimously
passed declaring that bicycles
from now on will not be allowed
on the concrete apron around the
bookstore and post office.
Men's Row representative Bill
Blunt made the motion at the re
quest of his constituents, who
complained about the hazard the
bikes are to those walking on the
concrete, particularly around the
entrances to the bookstore and
post office.
Signs will be posted soon re
minding cyclists of the new rule,
which follows last year's measure
barring bicycles from Quad.
