# A 						Misconception
## 
### 
A serious misconception exists on and o(T campus which must
be dispelled. Apparently a large majority of the students and a
goodly number of people living in the area consider llie Stanford
Daily as the voice of the whole campus.
This is not true. The opinions expressed on the Daily's editorial
page are those of llie editor and llie editorial hoard which is com
prised of seven students.
We fail to understand how anyone can asuine that the Daily's
opinions reflect the opinions of llie entire student body. No news
paper can reflect the beliefs of the community in which it pub
lishes. Surely no one believes that the editorials appearing in the
Chronicle or the Examiner are in accord with the opinions of all
ihe people of San Francisco. If both newspapers endorse Senator
Kennedy the whole nation does not assume that San Francisco is
inhabited only by Democrats.
If the Chronicle or llie Examiner suggest that llie San Fran
cisco Giants play in a minor league, surely no one assumes that
everyone in Sail Francisco agrees.
Why, then, should anyone assume that when the Stanford Daily
endorses Senator Kennedy or suggests that Stanford play non-
AAW I teams that it speaks for the entire community? Why is it
assumed when the Daily questions the efficiency of the House Un-
American Activities Committee that it means the whole campus
probably was participating in the San Francisco riots?
There is obviously no justification for such assumptions.
The question arises as to what is the function of the Daily edi
torial page if it is not to reflect majority student opinion. This
varies with the intent and purpose of the editor.
Some editors are content to analyze and perhaps criticize such
issues as the importance of bicycle lights on campus and the pros
and cons of putting a cyclone fence around the grass in front of
the post office. The present editor realizes that these are problems,
but does not consider them nearly as important as how well Stan
ford students understand the purpose of education, the threat of
communism, racial discrimination, or how well Stanford graduates
can meet the thousands of problems which America must face if
it is to survive.
If a Daily editorial makes you angry, if it makes you think, if
it makes you sit down and write a letter, then the editorial has
accomplished its purpose.
II you agree with a Daily editorial, but it helps to clarifv your
position, then the editorial has accomplished its purpose.
We want the Daily to he a gadfly. We want the gadflv to buzz
around your cereal howl everv morning, alight on its rim, look up
at you and sav: 'Do you really feel that America is as secure now
as it was ten years ago? Do you reallv feel that the House I'n-
American Aetivilies ('.ommittee is fulfilling its legislative function?
Do you agree with me that tie-emphasis of football at Stanford
might he a wise course of action?"
The Stanford Daily cannot lie the voice of this campus but it
can attempt to be its conscience. Sometimes we succeed, at other
times we fail. But at least we are thinking, we are Irving to pro
duce some logical answers.

your mind. The only way one can arrive at a valid conclusion is
by analyzing all sides of a question. We are presenting our side;
it is up to you to present yours.
A serious misconception exists on and o(T campus which must
be dispelled. Apparently a large majority of the students and a
goodly number of people living in the area consider llie Stanford
Daily as the voice of the whole campus.
This is not true. The opinions expressed on the Daily's editorial
page are those of llie editor and llie editorial hoard which is com
prised of seven students.
We fail to understand how anyone can asuine that the Daily's
opinions reflect the opinions of llie entire student body. No news
paper can reflect the beliefs of the community in which it pub
lishes. Surely no one believes that the editorials appearing in the
Chronicle or the Examiner are in accord with the opinions of all
ihe people of San Francisco. If both newspapers endorse Senator
Kennedy the whole nation does not assume that San Francisco is
inhabited only by Democrats.
If the Chronicle or llie Examiner suggest that llie San Fran
cisco Giants play in a minor league, surely no one assumes that
everyone in Sail Francisco agrees.
Why, then, should anyone assume that when the Stanford Daily
endorses Senator Kennedy or suggests that Stanford play non-
AAW I teams that it speaks for the entire community? Why is it
assumed when the Daily questions the efficiency of the House Un-
American Activities Committee that it means the whole campus
probably was participating in the San Francisco riots?
There is obviously no justification for such assumptions.
The question arises as to what is the function of the Daily edi
torial page if it is not to reflect majority student opinion. This
varies with the intent and purpose of the editor.
Some editors are content to analyze and perhaps criticize such
issues as the importance of bicycle lights on campus and the pros
and cons of putting a cyclone fence around the grass in front of
the post office. The present editor realizes that these are problems,
but does not consider them nearly as important as how well Stan
ford students understand the purpose of education, the threat of
communism, racial discrimination, or how well Stanford graduates
can meet the thousands of problems which America must face if
it is to survive.
If a Daily editorial makes you angry, if it makes you think, if
it makes you sit down and write a letter, then the editorial has
accomplished its purpose.
II you agree with a Daily editorial, but it helps to clarifv your
position, then the editorial has accomplished its purpose.
We want the Daily to he a gadfly. We want the gadflv to buzz
around your cereal howl everv morning, alight on its rim, look up
at you and sav: 'Do you really feel that America is as secure now
as it was ten years ago? Do you reallv feel that the House I'n-
American Aetivilies ('.ommittee is fulfilling its legislative function?
Do you agree with me that tie-emphasis of football at Stanford
might he a wise course of action?"
The Stanford Daily cannot lie the voice of this campus but it
can attempt to be its conscience. Sometimes we succeed, at other
times we fail. But at least we are thinking, we are Irving to pro
duce some logical answers.
