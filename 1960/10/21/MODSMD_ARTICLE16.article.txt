# Weâ€™ve Been Duped

### 
\\ e've been duped. We've been subjected to a horrible joke.
Mr. H. L. Buckingham and bis coalition of patriots do not exist.
The letter was written by an individual or individuals wlio man
aged to pet hold of some Republican National Convention sta
tionery which was the property of a Stanford student who worked
at the convention this summer.
\\ e received another letter earlier this week from the perpe
trator of this hoax. The letter said: "Regarding your editorial of
Wednesday, October 19, congratulations on your brilliant detec
tive work. We know tlnif stationery such as you describe would
just have to be genuine. It couldn't possibly fall into the wrong
hands." It was signed: "John F. Kennedy. I\S. Thanks for the
endorsement."
Someone has a very sadistic sense of humor. We can take a joke
as well as the next person and everyone in the Shack laughed
ihemselves sillv.
It was stated in the October 19 editorial that every newspaper
is subjected to phony letters written by crackpots and idiots who
use official stationery to assure publication. Therefore, we are
neither surprised nor embarrassed by the hoax. We are, however,
a little concerned.
Phony letters could have many serious repercussions. For in
stance, if a Mr. 11. L. Buckingham does exist, lie certainly has the
right to sue for libel. He can't press charges on the Daily. We are
absolved of such things as "accessory to the crime*' simply because
yon can't be an accessory unless you are aware of the crime.
A more serious problem for the Daily is that we will have to
he doubly sure of all "official-looknig" letters. This involves a
great deal of checking and double-checking. We won't laugh so
hard if someone does it again. Things like that get boring.
