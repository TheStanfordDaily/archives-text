Editor, the Daily:
As a Stanford alumnus, I want
(o compliment you on your editor
ial in the Stanford Daily on Ihe
subject of de-emphasizing foot
hall at Stanford.
My class at Stanford was 1914,
which goes hack a lot of years.
Since then 1 have attended foot
ball games at the Farm each year
and feel that I have seen enough
of them and have followed foot
ball fortunes at Stanford long
enough to know a little about it.
There is no use kidding our
selves any longer. Either Stanford
must admit students who can
make up a team comparable to
those we play year after year or
make our schedule up of teams
that we can meet on an equal
basis. We are simply throwing a
fine bunch of boys to the wolves
when we schedule teams from the
Big Ten and the so-called Big Five
with the football talent that is
now available on the Farm.
Chuck Taylor comments that
the situation is only temporary
and that we are going through a
cycle that will change for the
better. This I cannot see as the
only change that, has been ap
parent to me in the past ten years
is that we are getting further
outclassed each year. This year,
I feel sure, we will not win a
single game and we cannot get
any lower than that.
I am afraid that gate receipts
are the governing factor in bring
ing these top teams to the Sta
dium each year, but it is a short
sighted policy as after a year or
two like this one, even the faith
ful like myself will have had
enough.
If the policy of ihe university is
to be so simon pure, when it
comes to admitting athletes, then
they should be consistent enough
to use the same simon pure for
mula and play teams from col
leges whose requirements are the
same as ours. It is murder to pit
our teams against some we have
played this year and those we still
have to play. It is no use denying

that the Negro players that are
recruited in the South and in
other parts of the country are
very potent factors in our series
of defeats. No one can convince
me that these boys would have
the ghost of a chance to pass the
entrance requirements at Stan
ford, but our buddys in the Big
Five seem to get them in without
trouble.
Let's fish or cut bait, but what
we have seen this year is more
then enough of the present foot
ball policy. About the only simi
larity between the present teams
and the great ones of the past is
the red uniforms.

Editor, the Daily:
Johnson and Mayer have stated
their case for the Student Fair
Play for Cuba Committee. To
keep everything in reasonably
proper perspective, it might be
well to state the other side of the
issue.
First, Article V, Section .1, A, of
the ASSU by-laws provides the
lIR "shall have the responsibility
for . . . the coordination, admin
istration, and regulation of all
international activities of the As
sociated Students." The only ex
ception made to this is the For
eign Scholarship Program. Arti
cle V. Section f>, A, provides "the
Political Union shall have the re
sponsibility for the coordination,
administration, and regulation of
all public political activities of the
Associated Students." It can be
reasonably assumed anything the
Fair Play Committee proposes to
do would come under the juris
diction of one or both of the above
organizations. If Johnson and
Mayer feel these regulations lead
to political sterility, I suggest they
look at the Socialist Caucus' pro
gram for the current quarter.
Second. Mayer and Johnson
have grossly misstated LASSU's
motives and actions. There was
no directive, let alone letter, from
the Dean to squash the Fair Play
Committee. Mr. Mayer was ac
corded the privilege of personally

addressing the Legislature. De
bale was not stifled: Daily Editor
Barry Greenberg did speak in
opposition to the rejection of the
constitution, and the final vote
was not: taken until all who
wished to speak had spoken.
Third, no organization has any
inalienable light to ASSU recog
nition. and Mayer and Johnson
apparently overlook the possibil
ity that they simply did not im
press LASSU with either the need
for, or desirability of, the Fair
Play Committee. And, after ail,
the members of LASSU are in the
end responsible only to the ASSU
Constitution, their constituents,
and their consciences for their
decisions.
Charles Lol'gren
LASSU
Editor, the Daily:
A question arises with regard
to validity of the Daily's recent
endorsement, of Senator John
Kennedy. It is generally the
choice of news and other publi
cations in this country to express
a sustaining ,'ote in favor of a
candidate for public office, which
choice has been upheld as a priv
ilege of the free press. However,
such action is only appropriate in
the case of those who are (1)
privately owned, backed by pri
vate capital, and whose publica
tions are sold to the public on a
profit basis, and (2) a printed
organ of a group which, as a
whole, has pledged support to
one or Ihe other candidates. This
is properly within their realm of
business and purpose because
they represent either themselves
and their private interests, or the
open expression of the majority
of the group.
The Daily itself does not fall
within the above categories but
is rather "Owned and published
. . . by the ASSU." The student
legislative body is not qualified
to indicate a choice on behalf of
the university for it is not elected
on a partisan basis.
Neither has it appeared lhat Ihe
endorsement is an indication of
standard university policy. Such
a statement of policy obviously
must come from Ihe administra
tion level.
Will the Daily editors therefore
issue a statement to show by what
authority the endorsement was
made? In the absence of such a
forthcoming statement which will
â€¢satisfy those, other than the edi
tors themselves, as to the ap
parent presumptuous and unau
thoritative position taken, it is
only proper to demand that the
endorsement be retracted at once
and in full, in the interests of all
who are within the Stanford orbit.

privately owned, backed by pri

is properly within their realm of
business and purpose because
they represent either themselves
and their private interests, or the
open expression of the majority
of the group.
The Daily itself does not fall

is rather "Owned and published

legislative body is not qualified
to indicate a choice on behalf of
the university for it is not elected

Neither has it appeared lhat Ihe
endorsement is an indication of

a statement of policy obviously
must come from Ihe administra

Will the Daily editors therefore
issue a statement to show by what
authority the endorsement was
made? In the absence of such a

â€¢satisfy those, other than the edi

Editor, the Daily:
As a Stanford alumnus, I want
(o compliment you on your editor
ial in the Stanford Daily on Ihe
subject of de-emphasizing foot
hall at Stanford.
My class at Stanford was 1914,
which goes hack a lot of years.
Since then 1 have attended foot
ball games at the Farm each year
and feel that I have seen enough
of them and have followed foot
ball fortunes at Stanford long
enough to know a little about it.
There is no use kidding our
selves any longer. Either Stanford
must admit students who can
make up a team comparable to
those we play year after year or
make our schedule up of teams
that we can meet on an equal
basis. We are simply throwing a
fine bunch of boys to the wolves
when we schedule teams from the
Big Ten and the so-called Big Five
with the football talent that is
now available on the Farm.
Chuck Taylor comments that
the situation is only temporary
and that we are going through a
cycle that will change for the
better. This I cannot see as the
only change that, has been ap
parent to me in the past ten years
is that we are getting further
outclassed each year. This year,
I feel sure, we will not win a
single game and we cannot get
any lower than that.
I am afraid that gate receipts
are the governing factor in bring
ing these top teams to the Sta
dium each year, but it is a short
sighted policy as after a year or
two like this one, even the faith
ful like myself will have had
enough.
If the policy of ihe university is
to be so simon pure, when it
comes to admitting athletes, then
they should be consistent enough
to use the same simon pure for
mula and play teams from col
leges whose requirements are the
same as ours. It is murder to pit
our teams against some we have
played this year and those we still
have to play. It is no use denying

that the Negro players that are
recruited in the South and in
other parts of the country are
very potent factors in our series
of defeats. No one can convince
me that these boys would have
the ghost of a chance to pass the
entrance requirements at Stan
ford, but our buddys in the Big
Five seem to get them in without
trouble.
Let's fish or cut bait, but what
we have seen this year is more
then enough of the present foot
ball policy. About the only simi
larity between the present teams
and the great ones of the past is
the red uniforms.

Editor, the Daily:
Johnson and Mayer have stated
their case for the Student Fair
Play for Cuba Committee. To
keep everything in reasonably
proper perspective, it might be
well to state the other side of the
issue.
First, Article V, Section .1, A, of
the ASSU by-laws provides the
lIR "shall have the responsibility
for . . . the coordination, admin
istration, and regulation of all
international activities of the As
sociated Students." The only ex
ception made to this is the For
eign Scholarship Program. Arti
cle V. Section f>, A, provides "the
Political Union shall have the re
sponsibility for the coordination,
administration, and regulation of
all public political activities of the
Associated Students." It can be
reasonably assumed anything the
Fair Play Committee proposes to
do would come under the juris
diction of one or both of the above
organizations. If Johnson and
Mayer feel these regulations lead
to political sterility, I suggest they
look at the Socialist Caucus' pro
gram for the current quarter.
Second. Mayer and Johnson
have grossly misstated LASSU's
motives and actions. There was
no directive, let alone letter, from
the Dean to squash the Fair Play
Committee. Mr. Mayer was ac
corded the privilege of personally

addressing the Legislature. De
bale was not stifled: Daily Editor
Barry Greenberg did speak in
opposition to the rejection of the
constitution, and the final vote
was not: taken until all who
wished to speak had spoken.
Third, no organization has any
inalienable light to ASSU recog
nition. and Mayer and Johnson
apparently overlook the possibil
ity that they simply did not im
press LASSU with either the need
for, or desirability of, the Fair
Play Committee. And, after ail,
the members of LASSU are in the
end responsible only to the ASSU
Constitution, their constituents,
and their consciences for their
decisions.

look at the Socialist Caucus' pro

bale was not stifled: Daily Editor
Barry Greenberg did speak in

constitution, and the final vote
was not: taken until all who
wished to speak had spoken.

nition. and Mayer and Johnson
apparently overlook the possibil

press LASSU with either the need
for, or desirability of, the Fair

the members of LASSU are in the

Editor, the Daily:
A question arises with regard
to validity of the Daily's recent
endorsement, of Senator John
Kennedy. It is generally the
choice of news and other publi
cations in this country to express
a sustaining ,'ote in favor of a
candidate for public office, which
choice has been upheld as a priv
ilege of the free press. However,
such action is only appropriate in
the case of those who are (1)
privately owned, backed by pri
vate capital, and whose publica
tions are sold to the public on a
profit basis, and (2) a printed
organ of a group which, as a
whole, has pledged support to
one or Ihe other candidates. This
is properly within their realm of
business and purpose because
they represent either themselves
and their private interests, or the
open expression of the majority
of the group.
The Daily itself does not fall
within the above categories but
is rather "Owned and published
. . . by the ASSU." The student
legislative body is not qualified
to indicate a choice on behalf of
the university for it is not elected
on a partisan basis.
Neither has it appeared lhat Ihe
endorsement is an indication of
standard university policy. Such
a statement of policy obviously
must come from Ihe administra
tion level.
Will the Daily editors therefore
issue a statement to show by what
authority the endorsement was
made? In the absence of such a
forthcoming statement which will
â€¢satisfy those, other than the edi
tors themselves, as to the ap
parent presumptuous and unau
thoritative position taken, it is
only proper to demand that the
endorsement be retracted at once
and in full, in the interests of all
who are within the Stanford orbit.

Robert A. Man^
Editor, the Daily:
As a Stanford alumnus, I want
(o compliment you on your editor
ial in the Stanford Daily on Ihe
subject of de-emphasizing foot
hall at Stanford.
My class at Stanford was 1914,
which goes hack a lot of years.
Since then 1 have attended foot
ball games at the Farm each year
and feel that I have seen enough
of them and have followed foot
ball fortunes at Stanford long
enough to know a little about it.
There is no use kidding our
selves any longer. Either Stanford
must admit students who can
make up a team comparable to
those we play year after year or
make our schedule up of teams
that we can meet on an equal
basis. We are simply throwing a
fine bunch of boys to the wolves
when we schedule teams from the
Big Ten and the so-called Big Five
with the football talent that is
now available on the Farm.
Chuck Taylor comments that
the situation is only temporary
and that we are going through a
cycle that will change for the
better. This I cannot see as the
only change that, has been ap
parent to me in the past ten years
is that we are getting further
outclassed each year. This year,
I feel sure, we will not win a
single game and we cannot get
any lower than that.
I am afraid that gate receipts
are the governing factor in bring
ing these top teams to the Sta
dium each year, but it is a short
sighted policy as after a year or
two like this one, even the faith
ful like myself will have had
enough.
If the policy of ihe university is
to be so simon pure, when it
comes to admitting athletes, then
they should be consistent enough
to use the same simon pure for
mula and play teams from col
leges whose requirements are the
same as ours. It is murder to pit
our teams against some we have
played this year and those we still
have to play. It is no use denying

that the Negro players that are
recruited in the South and in
other parts of the country are
very potent factors in our series
of defeats. No one can convince
me that these boys would have
the ghost of a chance to pass the
entrance requirements at Stan
ford, but our buddys in the Big
Five seem to get them in without
trouble.
Let's fish or cut bait, but what
we have seen this year is more
then enough of the present foot
ball policy. About the only simi
larity between the present teams
and the great ones of the past is
the red uniforms.

ful like myself will have had
enough.
If the policy of ihe university is
to be so simon pure, when it
comes to admitting athletes, then
they should be consistent enough
to use the same simon pure for
mula and play teams from col
leges whose requirements are the
same as ours. It is murder to pit
our teams against some we have
played this year and those we still
have to play. It is no use denying

that the Negro players that are
recruited in the South and in
other parts of the country are
very potent factors in our series
of defeats. No one can convince
me that these boys would have
the ghost of a chance to pass the
entrance requirements at Stan
ford, but our buddys in the Big
Five seem to get them in without
trouble.
Let's fish or cut bait, but what
we have seen this year is more
then enough of the present foot
ball policy. About the only simi
larity between the present teams
and the great ones of the past is
the red uniforms.

Editor, the Daily:
Johnson and Mayer have stated
their case for the Student Fair
Play for Cuba Committee. To
keep everything in reasonably
proper perspective, it might be
well to state the other side of the
issue.
First, Article V, Section .1, A, of
the ASSU by-laws provides the
lIR "shall have the responsibility
for . . . the coordination, admin
istration, and regulation of all
international activities of the As
sociated Students." The only ex
ception made to this is the For
eign Scholarship Program. Arti
cle V. Section f>, A, provides "the
Political Union shall have the re
sponsibility for the coordination,
administration, and regulation of
all public political activities of the
Associated Students." It can be
reasonably assumed anything the
Fair Play Committee proposes to
do would come under the juris
diction of one or both of the above
organizations. If Johnson and
Mayer feel these regulations lead
to political sterility, I suggest they
look at the Socialist Caucus' pro
gram for the current quarter.
Second. Mayer and Johnson
have grossly misstated LASSU's
motives and actions. There was
no directive, let alone letter, from
the Dean to squash the Fair Play
Committee. Mr. Mayer was ac
corded the privilege of personally

addressing the Legislature. De
bale was not stifled: Daily Editor
Barry Greenberg did speak in
opposition to the rejection of the
constitution, and the final vote
was not: taken until all who
wished to speak had spoken.
Third, no organization has any
inalienable light to ASSU recog
nition. and Mayer and Johnson
apparently overlook the possibil
ity that they simply did not im
press LASSU with either the need
for, or desirability of, the Fair
Play Committee. And, after ail,
the members of LASSU are in the
end responsible only to the ASSU
Constitution, their constituents,
and their consciences for their
decisions.
Charles Lol'gren

Editor, the Daily:
A question arises with regard
to validity of the Daily's recent
endorsement, of Senator John
Kennedy. It is generally the
choice of news and other publi
cations in this country to express
a sustaining ,'ote in favor of a
candidate for public office, which
choice has been upheld as a priv
ilege of the free press. However,
such action is only appropriate in
the case of those who are (1)
privately owned, backed by pri
vate capital, and whose publica
tions are sold to the public on a
profit basis, and (2) a printed
organ of a group which, as a
whole, has pledged support to
one or Ihe other candidates. This
is properly within their realm of
business and purpose because
they represent either themselves
and their private interests, or the
open expression of the majority
of the group.
The Daily itself does not fall
within the above categories but
is rather "Owned and published
. . . by the ASSU." The student
legislative body is not qualified
to indicate a choice on behalf of
the university for it is not elected
on a partisan basis.
Neither has it appeared lhat Ihe
endorsement is an indication of
standard university policy. Such
a statement of policy obviously
must come from Ihe administra
tion level.
Will the Daily editors therefore
issue a statement to show by what
authority the endorsement was
made? In the absence of such a
forthcoming statement which will
â€¢satisfy those, other than the edi
tors themselves, as to the ap
parent presumptuous and unau
thoritative position taken, it is
only proper to demand that the
endorsement be retracted at once
and in full, in the interests of all
who are within the Stanford orbit.

Editor, the Daily:
As a Stanford alumnus, I want
(o compliment you on your editor
ial in the Stanford Daily on Ihe
subject of de-emphasizing foot
hall at Stanford.
My class at Stanford was 1914,
which goes hack a lot of years.
Since then 1 have attended foot
ball games at the Farm each year
and feel that I have seen enough
of them and have followed foot
ball fortunes at Stanford long
enough to know a little about it.
There is no use kidding our
selves any longer. Either Stanford
must admit students who can
make up a team comparable to
those we play year after year or
make our schedule up of teams
that we can meet on an equal
basis. We are simply throwing a
fine bunch of boys to the wolves
when we schedule teams from the
Big Ten and the so-called Big Five
with the football talent that is
now available on the Farm.
Chuck Taylor comments that
the situation is only temporary
and that we are going through a
cycle that will change for the
better. This I cannot see as the
only change that, has been ap
parent to me in the past ten years
is that we are getting further
outclassed each year. This year,
I feel sure, we will not win a
single game and we cannot get
any lower than that.
I am afraid that gate receipts
are the governing factor in bring
ing these top teams to the Sta
dium each year, but it is a short
sighted policy as after a year or
two like this one, even the faith
ful like myself will have had
enough.
