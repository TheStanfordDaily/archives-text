# Profile of Tito

### MAHYAR NASHAT 
A story in Greek mythology
says that the Sphinx, a monster
with a lion's body and a woman's
head, perched on a rock near
Thebes and asked a riddle of
every passer-by, strangling all
who couldn't answer.
One day she a«ked Oedipus:
"What animal is it that walks on
four feet in the morning, on two
feet at noon and on three feet in
the evening?" Oedipus solved the
riddle by answering that it refers
to the human being in his infancy,
virility and old age. The Sphinx,
full of fury, threw herself into the
sea.
I believe if the Sphinx would
have asked me who is the most
silent and mysterious personality
in the United Nations, I would
answer: "Josip Broz Tito."
He has not changed since I saw
him in Cairo three years ago, en
joying a camel ride near the pyra
mids. He enters Ihe great hall of
the General Assembly almost un
seen, walks the 42 meters which
separate his seat from the door
with slow and careful steps,
draws the leather-covered chair
and sits down. lie never moves
again unless he gets tired.
Our world is full of contrasts.
The man who has passed a great
part of his life in prison, running
away from King Alexander's se
cret police, hiding in the mountains
and fighting two enemies at one
time (Nazis and Chetnik guer
rillas), cannot resist Ihe fatigue
which overcomes him as he lis
tens to the long speeches in the
IJ.N. As soon as he gets tired he
nods to his special secretary and
disappears out of the hall into the
corridor.
The word mysterious is not
new for Tito. During the war he
was already a legendary general
—mysterious and victorious. It
was Churchill who gave him the
push over the Mikhaliovich mon
archist forces after 1043. He is
the only small-country Commu
nist leader who ever defied the
Soviet Union and got away with
it. He is one of the seven wonders
of international politics.
Although he boasts of his de
votion to genuine Marxism- Lenin

ism, yet, slrangely enough he is
scorned by the Kremlin leaders
for being a danger not only to ihe
socialist camp, but also to the
entire international Communist
movement. On the other hand, he
has received more than one bil
lion dollars in aid from the United
States.
The world is small indeed.
Those two political leaders who
have refused to meet one another
have had to sit behind each other
in the General Assembly, ex
change a few words, shake hands
and think about the good old days.
It is not easy to read any expres
sion on Khrushchev's or Tito's
faces. I use u pair of binoculars. I
look at Tito. His eyes seem to be
staring at an nnkovvn point.
What can he be thinking about?
Kumrovec where he was born in
1<892? His parents who could not
give him a proper life because
they had fourteen other children
to look after? His education,
which was meager, not even get
ting through elementary school?
1 imagine he is proud of him
self and why shouldn't he be?
This man, who at 15 was full of
happiness is now at 68 one of the
distinguished leaders of the Neu
tralist countries. He plays an im
portant role in the balance of
power between East and West.
During the past few years he
has had a "peculiar" relation with
the Soviet Union. The Russians
spied on him and he spied on the
Russians. He is the man who has
courageously said: "No matter
how much each of us loves the
land of socialism, the USSR, he
can in no case love his own coun
try less."
Tito has the very typical Cro
atian looks and characteristics.
He is barrel-chested and has a dy
namic personal charm. I lis friends
have succeeded in establishing a
list of his likes and dislikes: he
likes his attractive marshal's uni
form with its large ribbon and
epaulettes; the flair for the dra
matic and the waltz. He dislikes
airplanes and women. He is a
close friend of Egypt's Nasser.
Tito's favorite axiom is that
"Karl Marx was only a man with
a white l>eard who lived a hun
dred years ago."
