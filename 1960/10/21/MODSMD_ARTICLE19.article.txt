# Tribe Bitter Over SJS Loss

incurring the wrath of Stanford
ites, wants to bounce back, to
break into the win column for
the first time this season.
THE BRUINS are a logical tar
get. Coach Bill Barnes' band of
gridders embarrassed the home
team by a 55-13 count at Stanford
Stadium last year and that, plus
the pungent memory of the SJS
performance, should be impetus
enough for any team.
"The team has been pretty bit

ment on Ihe San Jose game." was
Tribe Chief Jack Curtice's com
ment.
RIGHT HALFBACK Oil Dowd
is the only Indian on the doubtful
list all the others are in good
physical condition. Gil will make
the flight to LA but he is still
somewhat hobbled by a knee in
jury incurred in the San Jose
game.
Positive steps have been taken
to rectify last Saturday's short
comings. Pass defense and of
fense. the two keys to any local
success, have been stressed all
week and the ends and backs are
beginning to run their patterns
according to plan and they are
also beginning to hang on to the
ball once they have broken free.
Practice doesn't improve the
Indians' defensive secondary's
speed, but if reflexes and antici
pation have any bearing on pass
defense, the Cards should have
a fighting chance.
FULLBACK Skip Face gives
Stanford an edge on the ground
as the senior flash has romped for
215 yards and an average of 6.5
yards per carry. Face and Dowd,
who has collected 193 yards and
a 3.5 average, listed as the
second and third best ground
gainers in the current AAWU
rushing stats.
Co-captain Dean Hinshaw re
turns to full-time duty for the
first time since injuring his knee
a g a in s t Washington. The big
tackle is hoping to lick an injury
jinx that caused him to miss the
entire season last year.
So ends the credit side.
Chalk up the Bruins in the defi
cit column, and that one entry is
more than enough to balance the
budget. Everything Stanford has,
UCLA has too; the southlanders
have passing, running and a burn
ing desire to win.
HEADING the list of standouts
for Ihe Baby Blue is Bill Kilmer,
the most effective ground gainer
in the Big Five with over 600
yards in three games. It's the ac
curate right arm of Kilmer that
gives the Bruins a dangerous
passing attack that has accounted
for an average of 40 more yards
per game ihan Stanford's aerial
manuevers.
Kilmer has only 20 completions
to Norman's total of 41, but the
senior tailback has attempted only
53 tosses to Norman's 97 and he '

has averaged slightly more than
18 yards per completion as op
posed to the Indian star's 11-yard
average.
Kilmer, senior fullback Skip
Smith and wingback E/.ell Single
ton all combine to give a diversi
fied ground attack that has
proven a valuable supplement to
the passing.
IN THK LINE such standouts
as Marv Luster. Jack Metcalf and
Harry Baldwin lead the way. Lus
ter is a senior end who was good
enough last season to make the
UPI All-Coast team and is cur
rently the leading Bruin pass re
ceiver.
Baldwin, a senior center, is the
team captain and was also placed

[ on the UPI Coast team plus win
ning Ail-American honorable men
lion. Metcalf plays left guard, is
alternate captain and made UPI
All-Coast mention.
Incidently, besides Mr. Nathan
1 DeLynn "Skip" Smith, the host's
roster lists the Messers. Earl
Dean Smith, Robert A. Smith and
Robert Lee Smith and if the Cards
show any upset symptoms, Ihe
Smith Brothers might very well
cure them.
In a battle that looks to be a
grudge affair between two groups
of angry young men, the Cards
have a pyschological edge. They
always play well in the Coliseum
J and they have much more reason
to win then do the Bruins.
