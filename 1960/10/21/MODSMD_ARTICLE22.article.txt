# Poloists Travel South; Look for First Victory
## 
### 
Stanford's water polo squad,
still looking for its first win of
the season, invades the southland
this,weekend as they meet UCLA
t'oiflay arid IJJSC tomorrow in
hopes of coming up with that
elusive premier victory.
The Indians' best chance to
bring home the bacon will come
against UCLA. The Bruins are an
unknown quantity, but based on
their last season's record in which
they split with Stanford, the
Cards should be even money to
win.
However, hopes are not nearly
so bright for a Stanford win
against USC. The Trojans, along
with the California Bears, are
among the best to be found
around.
The Troymen loaded with the
likes of Chuck Bit tick and Ron
Crawford of the U.S. Olympic
water polo squad and Jon Hend
ricks and Maury Rose of the Aus
tralian Olympic swimming team,
it would have 1o he classed as a
major upset if the Indians were
to win.
All of the Card water poloists
will be in top shape for the week
end frays, with Bill Lorton, the
Indians' leading scorer with eight
goals in three contests, and Bob
Spence (seven markers) expected
to do most of the shooting.

Roger Johnson (four goals),
Jack Lorton (two), Rich Rosen
berger (one), and Mike Conn are
expectedt o help out while goalie
John Bales is throwing an air
tight defense around his goal.
The frosh team will sit it out
this weekend as they rest up for
their meeting with the Santa
Clara frosh here next Tuesday.
