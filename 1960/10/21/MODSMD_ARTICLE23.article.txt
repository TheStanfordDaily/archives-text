# Papooses Meet Bruin Frosh
## 
### 
Stanford's fro s h footballers
have spent considerable time ihis
week concentrating on ball han
dling and play timing in prepara
tion for their tilt against UCLA's
Brubabes in a preliminary con
test to the Stanford-UCLA clash
tomorrow.
"An over-eagerness on the part
of the kids in their first bail
game" caused the frosh to settle
for a 14-14 tie with the San Jose
State freshmen last Saturday.
A total of eight fumbles and
a blocked Papoose punt cost Iho
frosh a victory as the Spartababes
turned the miseues into two
touchdowns and nearly scored a
third.
Statistically, the Papooses out
gained their opponent 270-195
making 20 first downs to San
Jose's eight.
Steve Thurlow was moved up
to the first string quarterback
slot for the UCLA game, replac
ing Jim Norman. Thurlow passed
a six-yard scoring strike to end
Flip Wagner and showed excel
lent field generalship "to gain the
starting nod.
Other lineup changes saw Ken
Frascr replace speedster Chris
Babbs at the flankerback spot,
and Chuck McCormick switched
to left end where he will play
behind Bob Burke and Wagner.
