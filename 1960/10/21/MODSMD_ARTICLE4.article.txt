Sciences are planning a definite
I but gradual growth to provide
! more well-trained teachers and
i researchers.
8) A continued emphasis on

effort will be made to improve
the capacity of the professional
! schools. The Graduate School of
' Business will expand greatly in
: the near 112 u t u r e, according to
| Wert.
4) FURTHER development of
, engineering and sciences to sus
tain "this crucial sector in the
: modern university."
5) Strengthening the humani
i ties. "The best way to improve
the humanities is to bring in the
best people one can find, and this
is what we intend to do," Wert
| said.
(i) Encouraging intellectual at
mosphere. Cuthbertson empha
sized that one part of this pro
gram was the adding of faculty
associates to the freshman dor
mitories, which was done this
; year.
7) An increased program of in
! ternational studies. Wert believes
I this can be done through an im
provement of the present centers
in addition to the planned Tokyo
j site.
"We have no plans for future
| undergraduate study center s.
Hong Kong as a graduate center
i may eventuate, but we have no
1 present plans."
H) A development of the fine
arts which will be made possible
; by bringing the fine arts together
in a single new building.
9) A linking together of the
sciences and humanities through
more inter-departmental appoint
ments. Wert mentioned that some
history or philosophy of science
i chairs might be a good way to
bridge this gap.
10) Improving large class in
struction by making every physi
cal facility, such as charts and
audio-visual aids, available to the
instructors of large classes.
In addition, a huye program of
! construction is on the boards for

Cuthbertson singled out a new
undergraduate library as "top
priority" while the report also
mentions a new science library
and the improvement of the Main
Library.
A new Faculty club. Student

also on the schedule.
NEW buildings will be built to
house all or part of the physics,
biology, chemistry, business, min

ing and Clinical Sciences Schools
and departments.
Service plant facilities, includ
ing the fire and police stations,
and the University Press are also
due for replacement or improve

According to Cuthbertson,
these plans will take an estimated
$346 million of new money.
By 1970 Stanford will have
doubled its expenditures to a fig
ure of $65 million annually. They
are currently $30 million.
