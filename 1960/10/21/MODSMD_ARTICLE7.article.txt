# Kennedy Urges Seizure of Cuba Assets; Nixon Calls For New Economic Council
## Vice President Asks Reform In Federal Tax Structure 
### 
NEW YORK IUPIi Vice President Richard M. Nixon yester
day called for creating of a national economic council to coordinate
government efforts to increase the nation's rate of economic growth.
In unveiling a sweeping 12-point economic program, Nixon also
urged rigorous control over government spending to avoid the

danger of inflation.
He touched on taxes for the
first time during the campaign
by calling for a "tax system mov
ing toward some revision in per
sonal and corporate (taxi rates,
reform in depreciation allowances,
a broader base for excises at a
rate well below those now in ef
fect, and protection of state and
municipal revenues."
This, he said, would "enhance
personal incentives" and encour
age business investment that
"makes jobs and spurs produc
tivity."
ALTHOUGH implying a tax re
duction. Nixon did not specific
ally say so in his speech before
the National Association of Busi
ness Economists meeting at New
York University.
Nixon aides were asked later
whether the Republican presi
dential candidate meant a "revi
sion" downward in taxes. They
replied that they could not go be
yond what he said in his speech.
In proposing establishment of
an economic council to advise the
president, Nixon admitted there
was a need for "new machinery"
to coordinate efforts for an in
creased growth rate.
THE COUNCIL, he said, would
"infringe in no way on the inde
pendence of the Federal Reserve
System, which is something the
opposition seems bent on doing
and which is already causing con
cern in responsible circles, both in
our country and abroad."
Nixon did not mention a spe
cific rate of growth. He said the
"right policies" pursued imagi
natively and vigorously would re
sult in an adequate growth rate.
The nominee referred to Demo
cratic charges that this nation is
slipping behind Russia by saying
that the United States has the
"most remarkable and productive
system in the world." He said this
country is ahead of Russia and
will stay that way "if we are
energetic, imaginative and wise."
NIXON charged that Demo
cratic demands for "very easy
credit and artificially low interest
rates at all times and under all
circumstances" would seriously
weaken this country.
"Cheap money dogmatists," he
said, were "practically inviting
foreign banks and investors to
pull out the billions of dollars
that they now hold here on de
posit or in short term paper."
