# Ambassador to Cuba Recalled

### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) â€” The
United States, in its second dras
tic move against Cuba in 24
hours, yesterday recalled U.S.
Ambassador Philip W. Bonsai
from Havana for "an extended
period of consultations."
On the surface, the action ap
peared to foreshadow a possible
break in diplomatic relations with
the regime of Cuban Premier
Fidel Castro, especially since no
date was fixed for Bonsai's re
turn to his post.
But officials said the United
States intended to, send an am
bassador back some time. How
ever, there were indications the
Eisenhower administration would
keep Bonsai in Washington until
January and let the next admin
istration decide the question.
A high diplomatic source said
yesterday that Cuba had painted
five of its warplanes with United
States insignia.
Cuba has accused the United
States in the United Nations of
preparing an "imminent armed
invasion" and it was speculated
the disguised Cuban planes were
to be used in a faked "aggres
sion" incident to bolster the Cu
ban charge.
