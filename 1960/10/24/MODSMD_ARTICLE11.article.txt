# Republican Spokesman Campaigning for Nixon
## 
### 
Two-time Republican presiden
tion aspirant Thomas E. Dewey
will bring his party's campaign
to the Stanford campus today
with a 3:15 p.m. speech in Me
morial Auditorium.
In his Stanford talk, the for
mer governor of New York is ex
pected to plug the presidential
hopes of Vice President Rich
ard M. Nixon. Admission will be
on a first-come, first-served basis.
In Seattle yesterday, according
to United Press International,
Dewey declined to predict the out
come of the presidential race in
his state or any other state, say
ing "I threw away my crystal
ball in 1948."
HIS JOCULAR comment, made
during a press conference, re
ferred to his narrow loss to Harry
S. Truman for the presidency in
1948 after the experts predicted
Dewey would win.
However, Dewey did say he
thought the race between Nixon
and Sen. John F. Kennedy was ex
tremely close.
"I would say that it will be de
cided in the last two or three
weeks of the campaign." he said.
Both during the press confer
ence and at a luncheon with party
leaders, Dewey lashed out. at Ken
nedy and the Democratic Party.
"THE DEMOCRATIC foreign
policy is one of appeasment," he
said, "and we can't risk that kind
of leadership. Kennedy believes
the United States should not de
fend Quemoy and Matsu and this
kind of retreat would be national
suicide."
He added that "America's sur

vival in the struggle with the So
viet Russia depends on the elec
tion of Vice President Nixon."
Dewey once again denounced
Kennedy's farm policy, UPI re
ported, saying it would drive mil
lions of farmers off the farm and
put another million workers in
the food processing business out
of jobs. He added that it would
reduce production and consump
tion of food and raise prices.
DEWEY IS the latest in a group
of top-ranking political figures of
both parties to appear here under
the sponsorship of the student
Political Union.
Dewey not is a practicing at
torney in New York. He retired
from politics in 1954 after his
third term as governor of New
York.
A graduate of the University of
Michigan and Columbia Univer
sity Law School, he first came to
prominence in the thirties as a
result of his work as a special
prosecutor on a commission in
vestigating crime and vice in the
state of New York.
HIS OUTSTANDING efforts in
j that job brought him the post of
! district attorney for New York
1 City in 1937. He was defeated in
| the 1938 gubernatorial race, but
| came back to win in 1940.
In 1944, Dewey was trounced by
Franklin D. Roosevelt in the race
; for the White House. But in 1946
! he again became governor of New
I York. He lost to Truman in 1948.
| and then was chosen governor in
1 1950 as his last role in politics.
