# A 						Proposal

"We repudiate all morality which proceeds from supernatural
ideas or ideas which are outside class conception. In our opinion,
morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of class war. Every
thing is moral which is necessary for the annihilation of the old
exploiting social order and for uniting the proletariat.
"Our morality, then, consists solely in close discipline and in
conscious war against the exploiters, Communist morality is iden
tical with Ihe fight for strengthening the dictatorship of the pro
letariat/'
These are the words of \ ladimir Ilyieli Ulyanov, known to the
world as Lenin. Communists all over the world revere this man as
their father. Ilis theories of revolution along with the theories of
Marx and Engels are the hasis of Communist ideology.
As the above quote indicates, ii is an ideology without morals
or ethics as the Western world thinks of morals and ethics. It is
a ruthless, calculating, hrilliantlv thought-out ideology which re
gards nothing of importance except the existence of international
(lommunism.
The people who inhabit the Kremlin are confirmed Marxist-
Leninists. Marx's and Lenin's teachings form the Communist Bible.
They will defend and promote their religion as zealously as any
other religious group would defend and promote its religion.
The Stanford Daily believes that Americans do not understand
even the fundamental doctrines of Marxism-Leninism. We are
firmly convinced that America is totally incompetent to combat
Communism ideologically. We feel that Americans cannot under
stand why underdeveloped nations find Communism so attractive.
\\ e believe that Americans Ml ST understand Communist ideology
if Democratic ideology is to survive.
W hen America has been faced by an alien ideology in the past,
it was able to crush it by force. Eorce is no longer a serious factor.
War will destroy both ideologies. Communism must he defeated
by sound words and positive action, not empty threats and fear.
And it is not enough to >av that Khrushchev is not following
Marxism-Leninism, that he no longer believes in the inevitability
of capitalist-Communist conflict. For if Khrushchev docs not be
lieve it, then there are other Russians who may soon take over who
do. And there are the Chinese who most certainly do believe in
inevitable conflict.
Some of Lenin's most ominous words are known to every Com
munist: "As long as Capitalism and Socialism remain, we cannot
liv ein peace. In the end one or the other will triumphâ€”a funeral
requiem will be sung either o\er the Soviet Republic or over world
capitalism.'"
This is what America is up against, onlv America does not
know it. We think, that America should know it. especially stu
dents, since the job of defeating Communism is bequeathed to
them.
Therefore, we make a proposal. Stanford I niversitv should he
the first institution in this nation to have a course in Marxism-
Leninism which shall be compulsory. Governor Averill Harriman
advocated such a course in a speech here January 14.
I he course should be taught bv an expert who is completely
objective, and should he given to juniors or seniors, since freshmen
and sophomores are probably not yet mature enough to under
stand all that they should.
We would suggest that the course be formed along the lines of
History of Western Civilization and that reading matter include
most of the more important works of Marx, including the first
volume of "Das Kapital," and a sizable portion of the extensive
works of Lenin.
Active debate should be encouraged and individual research
projects should be an important segment of the course.
I his course must he compulsory for a very simple reason. The
battle against Communism is not the problem of a few individuals
in this country. It is the battle of every single American. It is
every single American's duty to understand what menaces his free
dom and the freedom of underdeveloped and neutral nations.
I bis idea is only in its formative stage. We welcome and encour
age any opinions, pro or con, you may have. We mean faculty and
administrators as well as student*. We consider this issue of most
vital importance. We await vour response.
