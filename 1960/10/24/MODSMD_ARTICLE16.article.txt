Editor, the Daily:
I must agree yvitli your obser
| vation in the October 21st edition
of the Daily that a large number
of students and townspeople con
sider the Daily as the voice of the
j whole campus. You wrote the
| problem off with a statement that
j "there is obviously no justifica
! tion for such assumptions." This
| is rather superficial, the point is.
; that they do make this assump
j tion.
Several persons outside Ihe Uni
versity have, on occasion, asked
me why the student body was
against the Loyalty Oath, for
Stanford's affiliation with NSA,
against the House Un-American
Activities Committee, and for
I John Kennedy. I tried to explain
to them that Ihe Daily led them to
believe that il spoke for the 9,000
students of the ASSU.
If these issues, pro and con,
were put to the ASSU in a refer
! endum, 1 added, a majority of the
I ASSU woidd probably take a po
i sit ion opposite to thai supported
I by the Daily, and "its Editorial
Board of seven students." This
was amply illustrated in the de
feat of the NSA proposal last
year.
A "gadfly" Barry, is something
that "buzzes," You sting! It seems
to me that the art of "gadflysman
ship" is most effectively indulged
I in when the "gadfly" taunts his
listener with both sides of a con
troversial subject, and then pro
ceeds to confound him with the
contradictions arising from the
conflict of both points of view.
In my opinion, you do not qual
ify as a "gadfly." You present the
spokesman for your point of view
(yourself, Mr. Lippman, Bowles
et. alt, and then you place beside
it your idea of what you thing the
contradictions might be. You
thereby reduce Republican and
Conservative opinion on this eam
; pus to sniping from long-range
| via "Letters to the Editor."
I have a proposal which I would
, like you to print in the Daily, and
j which I would like you to con
j sider very seriously. Instead of
: Herbloek, who is really a rather
i nasty fellow, couldn't we have, on
! alternate days, Darling, Mauldin,
: Russell of the LA Times, or Car
mack of the Monitor? Instead of
; Lippman all the time, couldn't we
I have, once in awhile, David Law
! renco, the Alsops, Bill Henry, or
• Fulton Lewis.

Editor, the Daily:
What is the function of the
Daily's editorial page? Mr. Green
i berg seems quite sure: the fur
! therance of his own opinions.
C. E. Jones' letter of Oct. 21 ade
quately i-alls Greenberg's bluff as
regards the Kennedy matter. But
the Daily's one-sidedness is much
more extensive, and we must ask
ourselves if this is the attitude
| we desire in our campus news
paper? Why can't the Daily be the
"voice of the campus," if this
voice need only be one of toler
ance and objectivity?
In his editorial of Oct. 21, it is
obvious that Mr. Greenberg is
laboring under a number of de
lusions, not the least of these
being megalomania. I personally
must disagree with his purpose
of angering the student body in
order to make them think.
Too, is there not an imbalance
present when the Editor may pre
sent "his side" five times a week,
and then leave the burden of ob
jectivity on a few daring letter
writers? I hardly thing an edi
torial is going to help me "clarify
my position" when it's one-sided
ness makes me vomit.
There is something fallacious,
and almost egomanically unrea
sonable about a person who ad
mits his inability to adequately
reflect ihe views of this campus,
and yet deigns to act as it's con
science.

I have just received word of the
passing of Mr. Rolfe Bidwell, one
of Stanford's early graduates. II
was because of this man and his
generosity that I was able myself
to have a Stanford degree. Stan
ford meant a lot to Mr. Bidwell,
and he made it mean a lot to

others by endowing several Stan-1'
ford scholarships.
I was fortunate enough to hold -
one which he endowed as a me

ful of students at the debate, some
20 Democrats were present to
counter 1 he Republican defense ol'
the Eisenhower record.
-vßut only half-a-dozen members
of our notoriously conservative
student body appeared on the Re
publican side of the auditorium,;
and not one of Diem rose public
ally to defend their party's ad

The apparent disinterest of stu

ford? But even more startling
; where are the hundreds of "par

Bishop Pike proposed before
Stanford students on Wednesday
night a positive step to meet
| what he regards as the biggest
world problem after the arms j
race—"the population race," or,
in a more materialistic view, the
unborn millions who will compete
with this generation for bread.
The bishop, who I believe said he
was chairman of an international
birth control board, insisted that
j contraceptive aid to India should
be a part of U.S. foreign policy.
Does he believe India is incapa
ble of manufacturing contraeep
j fives for her own use! And does
! he believe America would win
India or any African nation by of
fering them a birth control pro
gram?
If his answer to the first ques
tion is no. then he should be made j
aware of the technological and
economic differences in the manu
facture of a pill or prophylactic
! from lhat of Polaris. And if yes lo
the second question, let him try
to understand the feelings of a ;
poor people when rich outsiders
righteously offer to limit their
population.
The bishop may further guage

India's reaction from this: my na
tive country is British colonial,
with a largely Negro government,
and yet our own government dare
not propose birth control as pub
lic policy because a significant
sector of the people would suspect
this as an imperialist plot to keep
Negro numbers flown. And they
were not so persuaded by Red
propaganda.
If he still has ihe effrontery to
ask the U.S. to offer birth control
to any people, I say let it be marie
to Red China with her 600 mil

lions. The reply would be charged
with righteous obscenity, plus ihe
perfectly just charge that the
West accepts as a long-term view
the incapacity of her economic
system to expand in proportion to
its populace; and, in the ancient
struggle between "men" and
"things" (food, shelter, etc.), that
the West accepts at base that less
men and more things constitutes
the best social order. And this,
while America hoards her $9 bil
lion farm surplus!
And so the contradictions mid

llply. Bananas to the Congo, guns
to Laos, contraceptives to India,
Pike for Pope, Nixon for presi
dent . . .

The bishop, who I believe said he

Does he believe India is incapa

If his answer to the first ques

the second question, let him try

If he still has ihe effrontery to

Bishop Pike proposed before
Stanford students on Wednesday
night a positive step to meet
| what he regards as the biggest
world problem after the arms j
race—"the population race," or,
in a more materialistic view, the
unborn millions who will compete
with this generation for bread.
The bishop, who I believe said he
was chairman of an international
birth control board, insisted that
j contraceptive aid to India should
be a part of U.S. foreign policy.
Does he believe India is incapa
ble of manufacturing contraeep
j fives for her own use! And does
! he believe America would win
India or any African nation by of
fering them a birth control pro
gram?
If his answer to the first ques
tion is no. then he should be made j
aware of the technological and
economic differences in the manu
facture of a pill or prophylactic
! from lhat of Polaris. And if yes lo
the second question, let him try
to understand the feelings of a ;
poor people when rich outsiders
righteously offer to limit their
population.
The bishop may further guage

India's reaction from this: my na
tive country is British colonial,
with a largely Negro government,
and yet our own government dare
not propose birth control as pub
lic policy because a significant
sector of the people would suspect
this as an imperialist plot to keep
Negro numbers flown. And they
were not so persuaded by Red
propaganda.
If he still has ihe effrontery to
ask the U.S. to offer birth control
to any people, I say let it be marie
to Red China with her 600 mil

lions. The reply would be charged
with righteous obscenity, plus ihe
perfectly just charge that the
West accepts as a long-term view
the incapacity of her economic
system to expand in proportion to
its populace; and, in the ancient
struggle between "men" and
"things" (food, shelter, etc.), that
the West accepts at base that less
men and more things constitutes
the best social order. And this,
while America hoards her $9 bil

Bishop Pike proposed before
Stanford students on Wednesday
night a positive step to meet
| what he regards as the biggest
world problem after the arms j
race—"the population race," or,
in a more materialistic view, the
unborn millions who will compete
with this generation for bread.
The bishop, who I believe said he
was chairman of an international
birth control board, insisted that
j contraceptive aid to India should
be a part of U.S. foreign policy.
Does he believe India is incapa
ble of manufacturing contraeep
j fives for her own use! And does
! he believe America would win
India or any African nation by of
fering them a birth control pro
gram?
If his answer to the first ques
tion is no. then he should be made j
aware of the technological and
economic differences in the manu
facture of a pill or prophylactic
! from lhat of Polaris. And if yes lo
the second question, let him try
to understand the feelings of a ;
poor people when rich outsiders
righteously offer to limit their
population.
The bishop may further guage

India's reaction from this: my na
tive country is British colonial,
with a largely Negro government,
and yet our own government dare
not propose birth control as pub
lic policy because a significant
sector of the people would suspect
this as an imperialist plot to keep
Negro numbers flown. And they
were not so persuaded by Red
propaganda.
If he still has ihe effrontery to
ask the U.S. to offer birth control
to any people, I say let it be marie
to Red China with her 600 mil

lions. The reply would be charged
with righteous obscenity, plus ihe
perfectly just charge that the
West accepts as a long-term view
the incapacity of her economic
system to expand in proportion to
its populace; and, in the ancient
struggle between "men" and
"things" (food, shelter, etc.), that
the West accepts at base that less
men and more things constitutes
the best social order. And this,
while America hoards her $9 bil
lion farm surplus!
And so the contradictions mid

llply. Bananas to the Congo, guns
to Laos, contraceptives to India,
Pike for Pope, Nixon for presi

Bishop Pike proposed before
Stanford students on Wednesday
night a positive step to meet
| what he regards as the biggest
world problem after the arms j
race—"the population race," or,
in a more materialistic view, the
unborn millions who will compete
with this generation for bread.
The bishop, who I believe said he
was chairman of an international
birth control board, insisted that
j contraceptive aid to India should
be a part of U.S. foreign policy.
Does he believe India is incapa
ble of manufacturing contraeep
j fives for her own use! And does
! he believe America would win
India or any African nation by of
fering them a birth control pro
gram?
If his answer to the first ques
tion is no. then he should be made j
aware of the technological and
economic differences in the manu
facture of a pill or prophylactic
! from lhat of Polaris. And if yes lo
the second question, let him try
to understand the feelings of a ;
poor people when rich outsiders
righteously offer to limit their
population.
The bishop may further guage

India's reaction from this: my na
tive country is British colonial,
with a largely Negro government,
and yet our own government dare
not propose birth control as pub
lic policy because a significant
sector of the people would suspect
this as an imperialist plot to keep
Negro numbers flown. And they
were not so persuaded by Red
propaganda.
If he still has ihe effrontery to
ask the U.S. to offer birth control
to any people, I say let it be marie
to Red China with her 600 mil

lions. The reply would be charged
with righteous obscenity, plus ihe
perfectly just charge that the
West accepts as a long-term view
the incapacity of her economic
system to expand in proportion to
its populace; and, in the ancient
struggle between "men" and
"things" (food, shelter, etc.), that
the West accepts at base that less
men and more things constitutes
the best social order. And this,
while America hoards her $9 bil
lion farm surplus!
And so the contradictions mid

llply. Bananas to the Congo, guns
to Laos, contraceptives to India,
Pike for Pope, Nixon for presi
dent . . .

I must agree yvitli your obser
| vation in the October 21st edition
of the Daily that a large number
of students and townspeople con
sider the Daily as the voice of the
j whole campus. You wrote the
| problem off with a statement that
j "there is obviously no justifica
! tion for such assumptions." This
| is rather superficial, the point is.
; that they do make this assump
j tion.
Several persons outside Ihe Uni
versity have, on occasion, asked
me why the student body was
against the Loyalty Oath, for
Stanford's affiliation with NSA,
against the House Un-American
Activities Committee, and for
I John Kennedy. I tried to explain
to them that Ihe Daily led them to
believe that il spoke for the 9,000
students of the ASSU.
If these issues, pro and con,
were put to the ASSU in a refer
! endum, 1 added, a majority of the
I ASSU woidd probably take a po
i sit ion opposite to thai supported
I by the Daily, and "its Editorial
Board of seven students." This
was amply illustrated in the de
feat of the NSA proposal last
year.
A "gadfly" Barry, is something
that "buzzes," You sting! It seems
to me that the art of "gadflysman
ship" is most effectively indulged
I in when the "gadfly" taunts his
listener with both sides of a con
troversial subject, and then pro
ceeds to confound him with the
contradictions arising from the
conflict of both points of view.
In my opinion, you do not qual
ify as a "gadfly." You present the
spokesman for your point of view
(yourself, Mr. Lippman, Bowles
et. alt, and then you place beside
it your idea of what you thing the
contradictions might be. You
thereby reduce Republican and
Conservative opinion on this eam
; pus to sniping from long-range
| via "Letters to the Editor."
I have a proposal which I would
, like you to print in the Daily, and
j which I would like you to con
j sider very seriously. Instead of
: Herbloek, who is really a rather
i nasty fellow, couldn't we have, on
! alternate days, Darling, Mauldin,
: Russell of the LA Times, or Car
mack of the Monitor? Instead of
; Lippman all the time, couldn't we
I have, once in awhile, David Law
! renco, the Alsops, Bill Henry, or
• Fulton Lewis.
Freedom to me implies alter
! natives; a choice. The only choice
j Republicans now have is whether
: we shall read the Daily or not.

What is the function of the
Daily's editorial page? Mr. Green
i berg seems quite sure: the fur
! therance of his own opinions.
C. E. Jones' letter of Oct. 21 ade
quately i-alls Greenberg's bluff as
regards the Kennedy matter. But
the Daily's one-sidedness is much
more extensive, and we must ask
ourselves if this is the attitude
| we desire in our campus news
paper? Why can't the Daily be the
"voice of the campus," if this
voice need only be one of toler
ance and objectivity?
In his editorial of Oct. 21, it is
obvious that Mr. Greenberg is
laboring under a number of de
lusions, not the least of these
being megalomania. I personally
must disagree with his purpose
of angering the student body in
order to make them think.
Too, is there not an imbalance
present when the Editor may pre
sent "his side" five times a week,
and then leave the burden of ob
jectivity on a few daring letter
writers? I hardly thing an edi
torial is going to help me "clarify
my position" when it's one-sided
ness makes me vomit.
There is something fallacious,
and almost egomanically unrea
sonable about a person who ad
mits his inability to adequately
reflect ihe views of this campus,
and yet deigns to act as it's con
science.

I have just received word of the

was because of this man and his

I was fortunate enough to hold -
