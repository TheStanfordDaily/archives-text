# Card, UCLA Coaches Both Show Satisfaction
## 
### 
TIIKRK WAS little difference
in the outward appearances of the
winning and losing locker rooms
as a certain restrained feeling of
satisfaction reigned in each camp.
Jack Curtice, chief deployer of
i the Stanford troops summed up
the opposition by •stating, "The
Bruins are a real fine team. Kil
mer is real good; we lot a couple
of his receivers gel in the clear
and that hurt."
On a subject closer to home,
the Indian eleven. Cactus .Jack of
; fei-ed some clarification and com
mendation: "I'm real proud of the
team they tried their level best.
Just remember, we haven't got a
veteran flanker on the entire
team and we've been using the
same three backs for the past
throe seasons.
I ( I.A HEAD Coach Bill Barnes
started out with a relieved, "I'm
yards and a trip into the end /one.
The play, climaxing a 67-yard
| series, brought Stanfordites to
their feet, and the red-suited band
pot a chance to unlimber in earn
est. The touchdown, along with
Norman's two-point pitch to full
back Stan Lindskog, brought the
Indians to a respectable standing.
IN CAME the UCLA first team,
but the Cards kept fighting. Soph
omore Randy Vahan recovered a
fumble and the game ended with
Norman trying for a long gainer,
and the Red rooters chanting for
one more score.

glad to get that game over. I
knew Stanford would be lough
after San Jose, remember they
scored 20 points in the second
half last week."
Barnes continued by emphasiz
ing that he knew Stanford had a
good running attack, "We just
didn't feel that they could beat us
by running—they could have
beaten us with the pass, however,
and that's why we played them
| loose."
A satisfying feature of the
game to the Los Angeles mentor
was the fact that his team didn't
panic after Stanford began to
threaten. Although the Indians
pushed the hosts all over the field
in the first quarter, the Bruins
kept their heads and came back
with four quick touchdowns.
BARNES' I'LAN was to control
the ball as much as possible, but
he favored the two first stanza
quick kicks as protection against
fumbles. Curtice also was happy
with the quick kicks since it gave
the Indians a chance to control
the offense.
Back to Curtice, some more
comments were: "We're getting
a lot out of the players, they're
really putting out. Norman did
well, although the receivers
dropped a few on him."
Looking forward to next week,
the Tribe Chief added, "It's tough
to lose but we just might beat
old Southern Cal. At least we'll
line up."
