# Booters Take CCSF Lead
## Daily Sports 
### GLENN ALFORD 
The Stanford soccer team clob
bered a hopelessly inept bunch of
Santa Clara Broncos 9-1 Saturday
at Santa Clara's field.
The win enabled Stanford to
move into undisputed first place
in the West Coast Soccer League.
Powerful City College of San
Francisco lost to Cal 1-0, and the
Cal Aggies and USF played to a
0-0 draw. Both CCSF and the Cal
Aggies had been in first place
with Stanford previous to today's
games.
Despite the high score, the
prevalent attitude among the
Stanford players was that they
were glad to get a "bad game"
out of their system.
Stanford broke out to a quick
lead when, with only a minute
and a half gone in the game,
Emmanuel Andah received Mike
Tippett's pass behind the Santa
Clara backfield and scored. Stan
ford had to wait 15 minutes for
its next goal. Bernie Knaggs
flipped a pass to the outside where
Tippett, who played his best game
of the season, fielded it and fired
the ball into the corner of the
net above the goalie's reach.
Just a minute and a half later,

Knaggs made a penalty shot to
give Stanford a 3-0 lead. A few
minutes before the end of the
period Santa Clara got on the
scoreboard for the first and last
time in the game. Dave Wheelock
recovered a fumbled ball in front
of the goal and pushed it in.
This was the last score for
either team until before the end
of the third quarter. Then Steve
Humphries scored on the end of
a pass play from Tippett and
Engebrettsen.
The third quarter saw the de
fensive play of the game. Stan
ford goalie Beau Bianchi dived
over a fallen Santa Clara man
to grab the ball just before an
other Bronco could kick it into
the vacated goal.
Stanford broke the game wide
open in the fourth period on five
goals. The first of these was Tip
pett's second goal of the game.
He fielded Andah's shot just as
the goalkeeper and a fullback col
lided and fell in a heap and he
dribbled the ball into the goal
for a score.
Then Humphries made his sec
ond goal, and Andah scored again
on a beautiful pass from Rune
Engebrettsen. Andah proceeded
to make his third goal of the
game as he sneaked behind the
defense.
A goal by Dick Bartlett with
a minute remaining capped the
scoring.
After the game Stanford coach
Fred Priddle declared that if the
game had been played on the
Stanford field, the score would
have mounted to 18-1. He also
said he was satisfied with the

work of Knaggs, Andah, Dan
Farthing and substitute Humph
ries, Miklos Tottossy, and George
Harrison.
Harrison, as swimming aficio
nados will remember, was a
medalist swimmer in the Rome
Olympics. Tottossy may have
earned himself a starting fullback
position with his fine work.
In a Jayvee game, Stanford
dropped Polytechnic 3-0, remain
ing undefeated, untied, and un
scored upon in four games.
The score was tied 0-0 going
into the fourth quarter, but John
Whitely marie two followup shots

and Bob Cormack scored- from
his halfback position in a lob
shot over the goalie's head.
This Saturday, Stanford faces
San Francisco State at Stanford,
City College of San Francisco
as a tuneup for the important
game, which will be played the
following week.
