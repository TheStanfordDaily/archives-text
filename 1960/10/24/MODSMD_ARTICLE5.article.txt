# Baby Blue Delivers 6th Loss
## 
### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
Some Stanford fans will groan,
"just another loss." Actually,
while the score was hardly close
enough to qualify the game as a
moral victory for the home team,
the Indians' 26-8 decision to UCLA
in the Coliseum before a crowd
of 39.926 Saturday night could be
best described as a well played,
inspired Farm effort.
This was the sixth straight de
feat for Coach Jack Curtice's 1960
team against no wins. It was a
game that followed form; Stan
ford was rated an 18Vpoint un
derdog and they got beat by an
18-count margin.
BUT THE TRIBE looked good
and for the first quarter the con
crete, half egg shell stadium re
verberated to Indian chants for
touchdowns and an upset. The
locals so completely dominated
the first 15 minutes that the host
Bruins were able to run only four
plays, two of them quick kicks.
For the game the figures were
not overwhelmingly in favor of
UCLA. Stanford garnered 15 first
downs to the winner's 16 and the
Cards exhibited superior ball con
trol by running 69 plays from
scrimmage to 61 for the south
landers.
The only joker in the Card deck
was that old bugaboo, the inabil
ity to get the last few required
yards or keep the opponents from
managing a few long gainers.
Stanford was just lacking a little
bit, a little bit too often.
I.AST WEEK'S grounded aerial
offense was moving the ball
again; Dick Norman hit 14 out
of 2 7 attempts for 179 yards while
suffering only one serious inter
cept ion.
Stanford's backfield, as deep as
a two-year-old's backyard wading
pool, kept contributing with
chunks of yardage, mainly
through the efforts of old faith
fuls Skip Face and Gil Dowd.
Face carried 15 times and gained
65 yards while Dowd, whose in
jured knee almost kept him from
playing at all, charged for 37
yards in eight plays.
These two backs were tho only
Indians to rush for more than
six yards from scrimmage. Con
trast this with tho fact that nine
runners turned the trick for the
Bruins and one gets an indica
tion of the difference in team
depth.
BILL KIL.MEK, the current to
tal offense leader in the AAWU,
gave his usual standout perform
ance as he ran from the tailback
slot for 78 yards and completed
two passes in three tries for an
additional 55 in the offensive col
umn. The "Wild Rill of Azusa"
also set up the second and third
UCLA scores, one on a 29-yard
run to the Stanford one-yard line
and the other on a 42-yard pass
play from the Stanford 48 to the
six.
Face took the opening kickoff,
returned it to the Stanford 19,
and it began to look like the
Indians were ignoring the odds.
For the next eight minutes the
Tribe sustained a drive that car
ried them to the southlanders'
three. Face passed to Hal Steu
ber, but the j u ni or halfback
caught the ball one stride out of
the end /one for a temporary frus
tration.
UCLA took over and immedi
ately quick-kicked to their own
42.
KACIv CAMK the Indians with
another threat. Norman complet
ed three passes before the march
faltered and sophomore Gary
Craig punted to the host's eight
yard line.
Home town boos greeted the
baby blue as they promptly re
sponded to the situation by call
ing another quick kick, this time
a 51-yarder by Kilmer.
The first reversal to form came
midway in the second quarter.
Ezell Singleton broke free for 14
around left and, Singleton passed
for 26 and four plays later full
back Almose Thompson dove over
the middle of the Red line from
ihe one for a TD.
LESS THAN six minutes later
Thompson scored again and it
was Bruins 13, Cards O after end
Rich Hearney blocked the extra
point kick.
Seconds before halftime Nor
man c o m p 1 e t e d five of seven
pass attempts in a patented Farm
march that reached the enemy 15
just as the gun sounded.
After mid-game break, things
began to look ho-hum for Big
Red fans. Skip Smith climaxed a
UCLA drive by scoring on an
other of those exciting one-yard
runs, this one over the center of
the Indian line after two and a
half minutes of the third stanza
had gone by; the extra point pass
fell incomplete and it was 19-0,
wrong team ahead.
TWO MINUTES later it was
another of those detestibio one
yarders, this time old friend
Thompson doing the honors. The
kick was good and Coach Bill
Barnes' men had accounted for
all of their 26 counters in less
than 12 minutes of high scoring
action.
Some consolation for the hardy
band of Card rooters and a little
compensation for the local elev
en's sharp play came midway
through the final period as Stan
ford avoided a shutout when Nor
man connected to Face for 20

wrong team ahead.
TWO MINUTES later it was
another of those detestibio one
yarders, this time old friend
Thompson doing the honors. The
kick was good and Coach Bill
Barnes' men had accounted for
all of their 26 counters in less
than 12 minutes of high scoring
action.
Some consolation for the hardy
band of Card rooters and a little
compensation for the local elev
en's sharp play came midway
through the final period as Stan
ford avoided a shutout when Nor
man connected to Face for 20


DICK NORMAN PITCHES OUT TO CIL DOWD
Halfback picks up nine yards on first play of game
Some Stanford fans will groan,
"just another loss." Actually,
while the score was hardly close
enough to qualify the game as a
moral victory for the home team,
the Indians' 26-8 decision to UCLA
in the Coliseum before a crowd
of 39.926 Saturday night could be
best described as a well played,
inspired Farm effort.
This was the sixth straight de
feat for Coach Jack Curtice's 1960
team against no wins. It was a
game that followed form; Stan
ford was rated an 18Vpoint un
derdog and they got beat by an
18-count margin.
BUT THE TRIBE looked good
and for the first quarter the con
crete, half egg shell stadium re
verberated to Indian chants for
touchdowns and an upset. The
locals so completely dominated
the first 15 minutes that the host
Bruins were able to run only four
plays, two of them quick kicks.
For the game the figures were
not overwhelmingly in favor of
UCLA. Stanford garnered 15 first
downs to the winner's 16 and the
Cards exhibited superior ball con
trol by running 69 plays from
scrimmage to 61 for the south
landers.
The only joker in the Card deck
was that old bugaboo, the inabil
ity to get the last few required
yards or keep the opponents from
managing a few long gainers.
Stanford was just lacking a little
bit, a little bit too often.
I.AST WEEK'S grounded aerial
offense was moving the ball
again; Dick Norman hit 14 out
of 2 7 attempts for 179 yards while
suffering only one serious inter
cept ion.
Stanford's backfield, as deep as
a two-year-old's backyard wading
pool, kept contributing with
chunks of yardage, mainly
through the efforts of old faith
fuls Skip Face and Gil Dowd.
Face carried 15 times and gained
65 yards while Dowd, whose in
jured knee almost kept him from
playing at all, charged for 37
yards in eight plays.
These two backs were tho only
Indians to rush for more than
six yards from scrimmage. Con
trast this with tho fact that nine
runners turned the trick for the
Bruins and one gets an indica
tion of the difference in team
depth.
BILL KIL.MEK, the current to
tal offense leader in the AAWU,
gave his usual standout perform
ance as he ran from the tailback
slot for 78 yards and completed
two passes in three tries for an
additional 55 in the offensive col
umn. The "Wild Rill of Azusa"
also set up the second and third
UCLA scores, one on a 29-yard
run to the Stanford one-yard line
and the other on a 42-yard pass
play from the Stanford 48 to the
six.
Face took the opening kickoff,
returned it to the Stanford 19,
and it began to look like the
Indians were ignoring the odds.
For the next eight minutes the
Tribe sustained a drive that car
ried them to the southlanders'
three. Face passed to Hal Steu
ber, but the j u ni or halfback
caught the ball one stride out of
the end /one for a temporary frus
tration.
UCLA took over and immedi
ately quick-kicked to their own
42.
KACIv CAMK the Indians with
another threat. Norman complet
ed three passes before the march
faltered and sophomore Gary
Craig punted to the host's eight
yard line.
Home town boos greeted the
baby blue as they promptly re
sponded to the situation by call
ing another quick kick, this time
a 51-yarder by Kilmer.
The first reversal to form came
midway in the second quarter.
Ezell Singleton broke free for 14
around left and, Singleton passed
for 26 and four plays later full
back Almose Thompson dove over
the middle of the Red line from
ihe one for a TD.
LESS THAN six minutes later
Thompson scored again and it
was Bruins 13, Cards O after end
Rich Hearney blocked the extra
point kick.
Seconds before halftime Nor
man c o m p 1 e t e d five of seven
pass attempts in a patented Farm
march that reached the enemy 15
just as the gun sounded.
After mid-game break, things
began to look ho-hum for Big
Red fans. Skip Smith climaxed a
UCLA drive by scoring on an
other of those exciting one-yard
runs, this one over the center of
the Indian line after two and a
half minutes of the third stanza
had gone by; the extra point pass
fell incomplete and it was 19-0,

was Bruins 13, Cards O after end
Rich Hearney blocked the extra
point kick.
Seconds before halftime Nor
man c o m p 1 e t e d five of seven
pass attempts in a patented Farm
march that reached the enemy 15
just as the gun sounded.
After mid-game break, things
began to look ho-hum for Big
Red fans. Skip Smith climaxed a
UCLA drive by scoring on an
other of those exciting one-yard
runs, this one over the center of
the Indian line after two and a
half minutes of the third stanza
had gone by; the extra point pass
fell incomplete and it was 19-0,
wrong team ahead.
TWO MINUTES later it was
another of those detestibio one
yarders, this time old friend
Thompson doing the honors. The
kick was good and Coach Bill
Barnes' men had accounted for
all of their 26 counters in less
than 12 minutes of high scoring
action.
Some consolation for the hardy
band of Card rooters and a little
compensation for the local elev
en's sharp play came midway
through the final period as Stan
ford avoided a shutout when Nor
man connected to Face for 20


DICK NORMAN PITCHES OUT TO CIL DOWD
Halfback picks up nine yards on first play of game
Some Stanford fans will groan,
"just another loss." Actually,
while the score was hardly close
enough to qualify the game as a
moral victory for the home team,
the Indians' 26-8 decision to UCLA
in the Coliseum before a crowd
of 39.926 Saturday night could be
best described as a well played,
inspired Farm effort.
This was the sixth straight de
feat for Coach Jack Curtice's 1960
team against no wins. It was a
game that followed form; Stan
ford was rated an 18Vpoint un
derdog and they got beat by an
18-count margin.
BUT THE TRIBE looked good
and for the first quarter the con
crete, half egg shell stadium re
verberated to Indian chants for
touchdowns and an upset. The
locals so completely dominated
the first 15 minutes that the host
Bruins were able to run only four
plays, two of them quick kicks.
For the game the figures were
not overwhelmingly in favor of
UCLA. Stanford garnered 15 first
downs to the winner's 16 and the
Cards exhibited superior ball con
trol by running 69 plays from
scrimmage to 61 for the south
landers.
The only joker in the Card deck
was that old bugaboo, the inabil
ity to get the last few required
yards or keep the opponents from
managing a few long gainers.
Stanford was just lacking a little
bit, a little bit too often.
I.AST WEEK'S grounded aerial
offense was moving the ball
again; Dick Norman hit 14 out
of 2 7 attempts for 179 yards while
suffering only one serious inter
cept ion.
Stanford's backfield, as deep as
a two-year-old's backyard wading
pool, kept contributing with
chunks of yardage, mainly
through the efforts of old faith
fuls Skip Face and Gil Dowd.
Face carried 15 times and gained
65 yards while Dowd, whose in
jured knee almost kept him from
playing at all, charged for 37
yards in eight plays.
These two backs were tho only
Indians to rush for more than
six yards from scrimmage. Con
trast this with tho fact that nine
runners turned the trick for the
Bruins and one gets an indica
tion of the difference in team
depth.
BILL KIL.MEK, the current to
tal offense leader in the AAWU,
gave his usual standout perform
ance as he ran from the tailback
slot for 78 yards and completed
two passes in three tries for an
additional 55 in the offensive col
umn. The "Wild Rill of Azusa"
also set up the second and third
UCLA scores, one on a 29-yard
run to the Stanford one-yard line
and the other on a 42-yard pass
play from the Stanford 48 to the
six.
Face took the opening kickoff,
returned it to the Stanford 19,
and it began to look like the
Indians were ignoring the odds.
For the next eight minutes the
Tribe sustained a drive that car
ried them to the southlanders'
three. Face passed to Hal Steu
ber, but the j u ni or halfback
caught the ball one stride out of
the end /one for a temporary frus
tration.
UCLA took over and immedi
ately quick-kicked to their own
42.
KACIv CAMK the Indians with
another threat. Norman complet
ed three passes before the march
faltered and sophomore Gary
Craig punted to the host's eight
yard line.
Home town boos greeted the
baby blue as they promptly re
sponded to the situation by call
ing another quick kick, this time
a 51-yarder by Kilmer.
The first reversal to form came
midway in the second quarter.
Ezell Singleton broke free for 14
around left and, Singleton passed
for 26 and four plays later full
back Almose Thompson dove over
the middle of the Red line from
ihe one for a TD.

faltered and sophomore Gary
Craig punted to the host's eight
yard line.
Home town boos greeted the
baby blue as they promptly re
sponded to the situation by call
ing another quick kick, this time
a 51-yarder by Kilmer.
The first reversal to form came
midway in the second quarter.
Ezell Singleton broke free for 14
around left and, Singleton passed
for 26 and four plays later full
back Almose Thompson dove over
the middle of the Red line from
ihe one for a TD.
LESS THAN six minutes later
Thompson scored again and it
was Bruins 13, Cards O after end
Rich Hearney blocked the extra
point kick.
Seconds before halftime Nor
man c o m p 1 e t e d five of seven
pass attempts in a patented Farm
march that reached the enemy 15
just as the gun sounded.
After mid-game break, things
began to look ho-hum for Big
Red fans. Skip Smith climaxed a
UCLA drive by scoring on an
other of those exciting one-yard
runs, this one over the center of
the Indian line after two and a
half minutes of the third stanza
had gone by; the extra point pass
fell incomplete and it was 19-0,
wrong team ahead.
TWO MINUTES later it was
another of those detestibio one
yarders, this time old friend
Thompson doing the honors. The
kick was good and Coach Bill
Barnes' men had accounted for
all of their 26 counters in less
than 12 minutes of high scoring
action.
Some consolation for the hardy
band of Card rooters and a little
compensation for the local elev
en's sharp play came midway
through the final period as Stan
ford avoided a shutout when Nor
man connected to Face for 20
