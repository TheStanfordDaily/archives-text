# Baby Blue Delivers 6th Loss

### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
Some Stanford fans will groan,
"just another loss." Actually,
while the score was hardly close

again; Dick Norman hit 14 out

suffering only one serious inter
cept ion.
Stanford's backfield, as deep as
a two-year-old's backyard wading
pool, kept contributing with
chunks of yardage, mainly
through the efforts of old faith
fuls Skip Face and Gil Dowd.
Face carried 15 times and gained
65 yards while Dowd, whose in
