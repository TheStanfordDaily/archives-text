# Fifth TV Debate Scheduled; Argument Surrounds Topic

### 
WASHINGTON (UPI> Vice President Richard M. Nixon and Sen. John F. Kennedy agreed last
night on a fifth TV debate.
Kennedy, however, protested the Republican presidential nominee's provision that it be limited to
what Nixon called Kennedy's "reckless" policy toward Cuba's Fidel Castro.
The Democratic candidate called the provision "a gag on the press." He said "Cuba is important

, but so are our relations with the
Soviet Union, the problems of
Latin America, Africa and Asia,
j Equally important are the domes-
I tic issues which you and the Re
publican Party seem to wish to
bury during this campaign mini
mum wage, medical care for the
1 aged, aid to education and the
i rising rate of unemployment."
! Nixon laid down the provision
| limiting the debate to Cuba in a
; hot telegram to his Democratic
! rival, who has been pressing for a
| fifth debate. Calling U.S. policy
| toward Cuba a "paramount" is
j sue, Nixon said Kennedy's propo
| sals for dealing with Castro
! would provide an excuse for Rus-
I sian intervention and might trig
! ger World War 111.
THE GOP CANDIDATE also
accussed the Massachusetts Sen
| ator of "sophomoric" distortions
I concerning Nixon's stand on a
1 fifth in the recent series of "Great
j Debates."
i He further proposed that vice
! presidential candidates Lyndon B.
j Johnson and Henry Cabot Lodge
should participate in the fifth de
bate to discuss how the vice pres
idency could be "employed in the
; struggle for peace and freedom."
IN A TELEGRAM to Nixon,
; Kennedy said: "I will be pleased
to discuss the whole record of
j Cuba with you how this island
I only 90 miles from our borders
: fell into Communists hands and
the sorry record of Administra
i tion inaction with regard to
Cuba."
