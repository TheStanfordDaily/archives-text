# Daily Cal to Publish After Ex Com War
## 
### 
The Daily Californian, student newspaper at Cal's Berkeley cam
pus, will publish today as a result of an agreement worked out
Saturday between the warring editorial staff of the paper and the
executive committee of the Associated Students.
Publication of the Daily Cal had been suspended Friday night
by the committee, which ordered a hired executive of the ASUC to
inform the paper's printers not to print another issue until further
not ice.
SATURDAY'S AGHKKMKNT came about following a day during
which the fate of the paper was debated by the two politically- bat
tling factions. Saturday the editors threatened to publish an eight
page paper of their own if the suspension of the Daily Cal was en
forced, or if new editors were named.
However, Dan Silver, the paper's editor, and members of the
powerful committee which can legally suspend publication because
it publishes the paper and controls its finances reached a com
promise.
TODAY'S EDITION will be put out by the senior editors and
will include a long statement of the committee's views on the paper's
editorial policy.
Suspension of the publication came after the paper had taken
the unusual but legal step of endorsing a candidate for representa
tive-at-large to the executive committee during last week's campus
elections.
The candidate. Mike Tigar, of the liberal Slate political group, lost
in a run-off election.
AT ISSUE IN THE election, which the Daily Cal called a "crucial
situation," wore Tigar's view that the ex-corn should concern itself
with off-campus issues, and his opponent's opinion that the group
should confine itself to on-campus issues.
This is the same issue which caused a stir at Stanford last spring.
When the paper was suspended Friday night, Silver obtained a
Student Judicial Committee injunction nullifying the suspension.
Tlir judicial group Saturday found the ex-corn's suspension "uncon
stitutional," and Silver and the ex-com finally hashed out the
agreement.
