# Frosh Football Player Commits Suicide in Field With .22 Rifle
## 
### 
Apparently despondent over poor grades, Charles P. Flanigan, a Soto freshman and second-string cen
ter on the frosh football team, stuck a new .22 calibre rifle in his mouth and mortally wounded himself
at 11 a.m. yesterday morning in the field between the Corporation Yard greenhouse and Escondido
Village.
At the same time, some 1,300 fellow freshmen were taking their first Western Civilization mid-

term not far away in Memorial
Auditorium.
A University employee first no
ticed Flanigan wandering about
the field with the rifle and called
police.
STANFORD officers George
Lester and Don Lillie, answering
the call in a Stanford radio car,
drove up just as Flanigan shot
himself.
Lester said that Flanigan ap
parently did not sec the police car
although they were only about 25
yards away.
They immediately called an am
bulance. Flanigan was taken to
Stanford-Palo Alto Medical Cen
ter.
He died on the operating table
an hour and forty minutes later.
Police found a blanket nearby
1 that Flanigan apparently had
used to wrap the rifle in as he
walked to the field.
They reported that no notes
; were found in the field or in Flan
! igan's Wilbur room.
Flanigan's parents live in Mont
: lose, Colo., where his father is
| an auto dealer.
CONTACTED by phone, his
; father, Perry Flanigan, said "the
| boy was extremely homesick and
j he called home at least once a
week.
"I just can't understand it,"the
boy's father sobbed, "unless it
was a mental block caused by
nervousness and homesickness
... I just can't understand it—he
was accepted by the Air Force
Academy and was always a good
student his best subjects were
math, English and history.
"I just can't understand why
he'd do it."
His father said the boy had
been an all-state football back,
student, body president in his high
school and had lettered in all
major sports.
Flanigan was taking tutorial
i English and hashed at Encina
I Hall. According to friends, he was
! disatisfied over his poor grades
i on his essays.
HE WAS at Stanford on a foot
! ball scholarship and had just re
i turned from playing UCLA Sat
; urday night in the Los Angeles
! Coliseum. Friends on his Soto—
| three floor said he was slightly
; worried over his failure to study
for the Civ exam, but didn't seem
seriously upset.
His academic adviser, Dean of
I Women Elva Brown described
I him as "a real American fellow
1 who seemed to be well-balanced."
The Dean said that he had just
j recently dropped from a three
' unit math class and seemed to be
; quite relaxed.
"His death was a complete
shock to me," she said, "as he
j was always so open and above
i board."
FRIENDS on his Soto floor
j also were unaware of Flanigan's
i apparent mental condition. "He
j gave no indication to us that he
was so upset." one of them said.
Last night the Soto dining room
| at Wilbur was quiet No one talked
I of Flanigan's death. Those who
' talked did so in hushed tones.
Afterwards in a Soto house
j meeting, Faculty Resident David
; Stenzel told the house "not to take
j blame and not to feel a personal
j i-esponsibility for his death. It
' couldn't be avoided.
"IT SHOULD be a lesson to us
; all to take our problems to some
j one to get them off our minds,"
j he said.
A memorial service will be held
tonight at 7:30 in Memorial
1 Church. A mass will be celebrated
Sunday at 8 a.m. at St. Ann's
Chapel, Palo Alto.
Funeral arrangements are l>e
ing arranged by Roller and Hap
good. The body will be sent to
Colorado and. following services.
' will be interred there.
