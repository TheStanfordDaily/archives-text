The late John Foster Dulles
used constantly to preach that Ihc
cardinal rule in diplomacy was,
as he put it, to seek "1o prevent
war by preventing miscalculation
by a potential aggressor." This,
he said, meant a "policy of mak
ing clear our position in advance.
. . . We have learned by hard ex
perience that failure to make our
position known in advance makes
war more likely because then an
aggressor may miscalculate." He
was thinking, of course, of Ihe
Kaiser in the first World War,
Hitler in the second, and of the
Soviet and its North Korean satel
lite in the Korean war.
Why is it then that during this
campaign we are being told by
Mr. Nixon's supporters that the
opposite is true, that it is often
better not to draw the line at
which you intend to fight, that
it is often better to keep the ad
versary guessing? This is the
thesis which Mr. Lodge is pro
pounding and this is the position
taken by "Life" magazine in dis
cussing the lamentable Quemoy-
Matsu issue. Was Mr. Dulles
wrong when he called upon the
country "to make clear our posi
tion in advance" of a potential
aggression? What has happened
to make it a virtue to keep the
adversary guessing about whether
you will or whether you will not
defend a particular territory?
There is a strong case to be
made that .John Foster Dulles was
wrong in his doctrine. But that
is not what lias brought about
this reversal of the Republican
doctrine. What has happened is
that Mr. Nixon has chosen to "ex
ploit"—the word is from "Life"
magazine—the very uncomfort
able predicament in which,
against our will and judgment,
we are trapped. In 1955, when we
made the treaty guaranteeing
Formosa and the Pescadores,
President Eisenhower and Secre
tary Dulles refused to include
Quemoy and Matsu. They tried
to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to
evacuate those islands, and when
he refused, being supported by
powerful figures both inside the
Administration and in the Senate,
President Eisenhower and Secre
tary Dulles invented a formula,
deliberately vague, as a face-sav
ing compromise.
The formula was to satisfy Chi
ang and his friends who wanted
a guarantee of the offshore
islands, and it was to satisfy a
majority of the Senate who did
not wish to guarantee the off
shore islands. This formula, how
ever, violated the most cherished
doctrine and principle of John
Foster Dulles. He had to give in
because Chiang Kai-shek and his
American supporters were too
strong for him.
The whole thing is a monument
to the failure of the Eisenhower
administration to carry through
its own policy, and to define can
didly and openly the commitments
of the United States.
The truth of the matter is that
for five years we have been stuck
with these islands. We have been
entangled with Chiang and unable
to do what we believe in. All that
Sen. Kennedy has said about this
is that he would try once again
to negotiate with Chiang in order
to disentangle us, and he would

try to do what the President him
self wanted to do, to do what Mr.
Herter has said plainly he would
like to do, to do what the prin
ciples and convictions of John
Foster Dulles called for. He would
like, if he can induce Chiang to
agree, "to make clear our posi
tion in advance" of hostilities. It
is slanderous to call this appease
ment and surrender.
Along this line of campaigning
there is something more to lie
said about Mr. Nixon's many ref
erences to "regrets" about the
U-2. To hear Mr. Nixon talk, one
would suppose Sen. Kennedy had
said that tlie President should don
sackcloth and ashes, and go bare
foot and on Ins knees up the steps
of the Kremlin. To hear Mr. Nix
on talk, one would suppose that
the formal expression of diplo
matic regrets about the violation
of another country's territory was
something that no loyal American
and no genuine anti-Communist
would ever dream of.
Mr. Nixon does not have much
diplomatic experience and he has
very little knowledge of the his
tory and practices of diplomacy
and no accurate knowledge of the
diplomatic record of the Admin
istration to which he belongs. For
in 1958, according to the "New
York Times" of Feb. 2, the United
States sent apologies to the
Soviet Union because a United
Stales Air Force jet made an
accidental flight over East Ger
man territory. In June 1958, when
the Soviet Union shot down an
unarmed American transport over
Soviet Armenia, the United States
in a note to the Soviet govern
ment, denied that the transport
had deliberately violated Soviet
territory. But it added, "If, in fact,
the aircraft . . . inadvertently . . .
crossed the Soviet frontier, the
government of the United States
regrets that fact."
This year, moreover, the Eisen
hower-Nixon administration ex
pressed its "sincere regrets" to
Castro's government because a
private plane of Castro's Cuban
enemies had taken off from
American territory, eluding our
airport patrols.
So what is the point of making
such a fuss about Sen. Kennedy's
point that he would have liked
to settle the U-2 affair by express
ing the regrets which are normal
diplomatic practice? Mr. Nixon
talks as if, by not expressing re
grets, we had avoided an "intelli
gence gap," had protected our
selves against a Pearl Harbor. But
have we? The U-2 flights have
been suspended and, moreover,
now that the whole affair has
been blown up to an unforgettable
importance, they can never be
resumed.
In the spy business, the Ad
ministration, including Mr. Nixon
who was never at the center of
things, acted like amateurs in a
panic. Had the President disa
vowed personal responsibility, as
in espionage all heads of govern
ment always do, and had he tried
to close the incident with con
ventional diplomatic regrets, our
standing in the world would be
better than it is today, and our
intelligence operations would be
no less constricted than they now
are.

war more likely because then an
aggressor may miscalculate." He
was thinking, of course, of Ihe
Kaiser in the first World War,
Hitler in the second, and of the
Soviet and its North Korean satel
lite in the Korean war.
Why is it then that during this
campaign we are being told by
Mr. Nixon's supporters that the
opposite is true, that it is often
better not to draw the line at
which you intend to fight, that
it is often better to keep the ad
versary guessing? This is the
thesis which Mr. Lodge is pro
pounding and this is the position
taken by "Life" magazine in dis
cussing the lamentable Quemoy-
Matsu issue. Was Mr. Dulles
wrong when he called upon the
country "to make clear our posi
tion in advance" of a potential
aggression? What has happened
to make it a virtue to keep the
adversary guessing about whether
you will or whether you will not
defend a particular territory?
There is a strong case to be
made that .John Foster Dulles was
wrong in his doctrine. But that
is not what lias brought about
this reversal of the Republican
doctrine. What has happened is
that Mr. Nixon has chosen to "ex
ploit"—the word is from "Life"
magazine—the very uncomfort
able predicament in which,
against our will and judgment,
we are trapped. In 1955, when we
made the treaty guaranteeing
Formosa and the Pescadores,
President Eisenhower and Secre
tary Dulles refused to include
Quemoy and Matsu. They tried
to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to
evacuate those islands, and when
he refused, being supported by
powerful figures both inside the
Administration and in the Senate,
President Eisenhower and Secre
tary Dulles invented a formula,
deliberately vague, as a face-sav
ing compromise.
The formula was to satisfy Chi
ang and his friends who wanted
a guarantee of the offshore
islands, and it was to satisfy a
majority of the Senate who did
not wish to guarantee the off
shore islands. This formula, how
ever, violated the most cherished
doctrine and principle of John
Foster Dulles. He had to give in
because Chiang Kai-shek and his
American supporters were too
strong for him.
The whole thing is a monument
to the failure of the Eisenhower
administration to carry through
its own policy, and to define can
didly and openly the commitments
of the United States.
The truth of the matter is that
for five years we have been stuck
with these islands. We have been
entangled with Chiang and unable
to do what we believe in. All that
Sen. Kennedy has said about this
is that he would try once again
to negotiate with Chiang in order
to disentangle us, and he would

try to do what the President him
self wanted to do, to do what Mr.
Herter has said plainly he would
like to do, to do what the prin
ciples and convictions of John
Foster Dulles called for. He would
like, if he can induce Chiang to
agree, "to make clear our posi
tion in advance" of hostilities. It
is slanderous to call this appease
ment and surrender.
Along this line of campaigning
there is something more to lie
said about Mr. Nixon's many ref
erences to "regrets" about the
U-2. To hear Mr. Nixon talk, one
would suppose Sen. Kennedy had
said that tlie President should don
sackcloth and ashes, and go bare
foot and on Ins knees up the steps
of the Kremlin. To hear Mr. Nix
on talk, one would suppose that
the formal expression of diplo
matic regrets about the violation
of another country's territory was
something that no loyal American
and no genuine anti-Communist
would ever dream of.
Mr. Nixon does not have much
diplomatic experience and he has
very little knowledge of the his
tory and practices of diplomacy
and no accurate knowledge of the
diplomatic record of the Admin
istration to which he belongs. For
in 1958, according to the "New
York Times" of Feb. 2, the United
States sent apologies to the
Soviet Union because a United
Stales Air Force jet made an
accidental flight over East Ger
man territory. In June 1958, when
the Soviet Union shot down an
unarmed American transport over
Soviet Armenia, the United States
in a note to the Soviet govern
ment, denied that the transport
had deliberately violated Soviet
territory. But it added, "If, in fact,
the aircraft . . . inadvertently . . .
crossed the Soviet frontier, the
government of the United States
regrets that fact."
This year, moreover, the Eisen
hower-Nixon administration ex
pressed its "sincere regrets" to
Castro's government because a
private plane of Castro's Cuban
enemies had taken off from
American territory, eluding our
airport patrols.
So what is the point of making
such a fuss about Sen. Kennedy's
point that he would have liked
to settle the U-2 affair by express
ing the regrets which are normal
diplomatic practice? Mr. Nixon
talks as if, by not expressing re
grets, we had avoided an "intelli
gence gap," had protected our
selves against a Pearl Harbor. But
have we? The U-2 flights have
been suspended and, moreover,
now that the whole affair has
been blown up to an unforgettable
importance, they can never be
resumed.
In the spy business, the Ad
ministration, including Mr. Nixon
who was never at the center of
things, acted like amateurs in a
panic. Had the President disa
vowed personal responsibility, as
in espionage all heads of govern
ment always do, and had he tried
to close the incident with con
ventional diplomatic regrets, our
standing in the world would be
better than it is today, and our
intelligence operations would be
no less constricted than they now
are.

better not to draw the line at
which you intend to fight, that
it is often better to keep the ad
versary guessing? This is the
thesis which Mr. Lodge is pro
pounding and this is the position
taken by "Life" magazine in dis
cussing the lamentable Quemoy-
Matsu issue. Was Mr. Dulles
wrong when he called upon the
country "to make clear our posi
tion in advance" of a potential
aggression? What has happened
to make it a virtue to keep the
adversary guessing about whether
you will or whether you will not
defend a particular territory?
There is a strong case to be
made that .John Foster Dulles was
wrong in his doctrine. But that
is not what lias brought about
this reversal of the Republican
doctrine. What has happened is
that Mr. Nixon has chosen to "ex
ploit"—the word is from "Life"
magazine—the very uncomfort
able predicament in which,
against our will and judgment,
we are trapped. In 1955, when we
made the treaty guaranteeing
Formosa and the Pescadores,
President Eisenhower and Secre
tary Dulles refused to include
Quemoy and Matsu. They tried
to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to
evacuate those islands, and when
he refused, being supported by
powerful figures both inside the
Administration and in the Senate,
President Eisenhower and Secre
tary Dulles invented a formula,
deliberately vague, as a face-sav
ing compromise.
The formula was to satisfy Chi
ang and his friends who wanted
a guarantee of the offshore
islands, and it was to satisfy a
majority of the Senate who did
not wish to guarantee the off
shore islands. This formula, how
ever, violated the most cherished
doctrine and principle of John
Foster Dulles. He had to give in
because Chiang Kai-shek and his
American supporters were too
strong for him.
The whole thing is a monument
to the failure of the Eisenhower
administration to carry through
its own policy, and to define can
didly and openly the commitments
of the United States.
The truth of the matter is that
for five years we have been stuck
with these islands. We have been
entangled with Chiang and unable
to do what we believe in. All that
Sen. Kennedy has said about this
is that he would try once again
to negotiate with Chiang in order
to disentangle us, and he would

try to do what the President him
self wanted to do, to do what Mr.
Herter has said plainly he would
like to do, to do what the prin
ciples and convictions of John
Foster Dulles called for. He would
like, if he can induce Chiang to
agree, "to make clear our posi
tion in advance" of hostilities. It
is slanderous to call this appease
ment and surrender.
Along this line of campaigning
there is something more to lie
said about Mr. Nixon's many ref
erences to "regrets" about the
U-2. To hear Mr. Nixon talk, one
would suppose Sen. Kennedy had
said that tlie President should don
sackcloth and ashes, and go bare
foot and on Ins knees up the steps
of the Kremlin. To hear Mr. Nix
on talk, one would suppose that
the formal expression of diplo
matic regrets about the violation
of another country's territory was
something that no loyal American
and no genuine anti-Communist
would ever dream of.
Mr. Nixon does not have much
diplomatic experience and he has
very little knowledge of the his
tory and practices of diplomacy
and no accurate knowledge of the
diplomatic record of the Admin
istration to which he belongs. For
in 1958, according to the "New
York Times" of Feb. 2, the United
States sent apologies to the
Soviet Union because a United
Stales Air Force jet made an
accidental flight over East Ger
man territory. In June 1958, when
the Soviet Union shot down an
unarmed American transport over
Soviet Armenia, the United States
in a note to the Soviet govern
ment, denied that the transport
had deliberately violated Soviet
territory. But it added, "If, in fact,
the aircraft . . . inadvertently . . .
crossed the Soviet frontier, the
government of the United States
regrets that fact."
This year, moreover, the Eisen
hower-Nixon administration ex
pressed its "sincere regrets" to
Castro's government because a
private plane of Castro's Cuban
enemies had taken off from
American territory, eluding our
airport patrols.
So what is the point of making
such a fuss about Sen. Kennedy's
point that he would have liked
to settle the U-2 affair by express
ing the regrets which are normal
diplomatic practice? Mr. Nixon
talks as if, by not expressing re
grets, we had avoided an "intelli
gence gap," had protected our
selves against a Pearl Harbor. But
have we? The U-2 flights have
been suspended and, moreover,
now that the whole affair has
been blown up to an unforgettable
importance, they can never be
resumed.
In the spy business, the Ad
ministration, including Mr. Nixon
who was never at the center of
things, acted like amateurs in a
panic. Had the President disa
vowed personal responsibility, as
in espionage all heads of govern
ment always do, and had he tried
to close the incident with con
ventional diplomatic regrets, our
standing in the world would be
better than it is today, and our
intelligence operations would be
no less constricted than they now
are.

country "to make clear our posi
tion in advance" of a potential
aggression? What has happened
to make it a virtue to keep the
adversary guessing about whether
you will or whether you will not
defend a particular territory?
There is a strong case to be
made that .John Foster Dulles was
wrong in his doctrine. But that
is not what lias brought about
this reversal of the Republican
doctrine. What has happened is
that Mr. Nixon has chosen to "ex
ploit"—the word is from "Life"
magazine—the very uncomfort
able predicament in which,
against our will and judgment,
we are trapped. In 1955, when we
made the treaty guaranteeing
Formosa and the Pescadores,
President Eisenhower and Secre
tary Dulles refused to include
Quemoy and Matsu. They tried
to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to
evacuate those islands, and when
he refused, being supported by
powerful figures both inside the
Administration and in the Senate,
President Eisenhower and Secre
tary Dulles invented a formula,
deliberately vague, as a face-sav
ing compromise.
The formula was to satisfy Chi
ang and his friends who wanted
a guarantee of the offshore
islands, and it was to satisfy a
majority of the Senate who did
not wish to guarantee the off
shore islands. This formula, how
ever, violated the most cherished
doctrine and principle of John
Foster Dulles. He had to give in
because Chiang Kai-shek and his
American supporters were too
strong for him.
The whole thing is a monument
to the failure of the Eisenhower
administration to carry through
its own policy, and to define can
didly and openly the commitments
of the United States.
The truth of the matter is that
for five years we have been stuck
with these islands. We have been
entangled with Chiang and unable
to do what we believe in. All that
Sen. Kennedy has said about this
is that he would try once again
to negotiate with Chiang in order
to disentangle us, and he would

try to do what the President him
self wanted to do, to do what Mr.
Herter has said plainly he would
like to do, to do what the prin
ciples and convictions of John
Foster Dulles called for. He would
like, if he can induce Chiang to
agree, "to make clear our posi
tion in advance" of hostilities. It
is slanderous to call this appease
ment and surrender.
Along this line of campaigning
there is something more to lie
said about Mr. Nixon's many ref
erences to "regrets" about the
U-2. To hear Mr. Nixon talk, one
would suppose Sen. Kennedy had
said that tlie President should don
sackcloth and ashes, and go bare
foot and on Ins knees up the steps
of the Kremlin. To hear Mr. Nix
on talk, one would suppose that
the formal expression of diplo
matic regrets about the violation
of another country's territory was
something that no loyal American
and no genuine anti-Communist
would ever dream of.
Mr. Nixon does not have much
diplomatic experience and he has
very little knowledge of the his
tory and practices of diplomacy
and no accurate knowledge of the
diplomatic record of the Admin
istration to which he belongs. For
in 1958, according to the "New
York Times" of Feb. 2, the United
States sent apologies to the
Soviet Union because a United
Stales Air Force jet made an
accidental flight over East Ger
man territory. In June 1958, when
the Soviet Union shot down an
unarmed American transport over
Soviet Armenia, the United States
in a note to the Soviet govern
ment, denied that the transport
had deliberately violated Soviet
territory. But it added, "If, in fact,
the aircraft . . . inadvertently . . .
crossed the Soviet frontier, the
government of the United States
regrets that fact."
This year, moreover, the Eisen
hower-Nixon administration ex
pressed its "sincere regrets" to
Castro's government because a
private plane of Castro's Cuban
enemies had taken off from
American territory, eluding our
airport patrols.
So what is the point of making
such a fuss about Sen. Kennedy's
point that he would have liked
to settle the U-2 affair by express
ing the regrets which are normal
diplomatic practice? Mr. Nixon
talks as if, by not expressing re
grets, we had avoided an "intelli
gence gap," had protected our
selves against a Pearl Harbor. But
have we? The U-2 flights have
been suspended and, moreover,
now that the whole affair has
been blown up to an unforgettable
importance, they can never be
resumed.
In the spy business, the Ad
ministration, including Mr. Nixon
who was never at the center of
things, acted like amateurs in a
panic. Had the President disa
vowed personal responsibility, as
in espionage all heads of govern
ment always do, and had he tried
to close the incident with con
ventional diplomatic regrets, our
standing in the world would be
better than it is today, and our
intelligence operations would be
no less constricted than they now
are.

The late John Foster Dulles
used constantly to preach that Ihc
cardinal rule in diplomacy was,
as he put it, to seek "1o prevent
war by preventing miscalculation
by a potential aggressor." This,
he said, meant a "policy of mak
ing clear our position in advance.
. . . We have learned by hard ex
perience that failure to make our
position known in advance makes
war more likely because then an
aggressor may miscalculate." He
was thinking, of course, of Ihe
Kaiser in the first World War,
Hitler in the second, and of the
Soviet and its North Korean satel
lite in the Korean war.
Why is it then that during this
campaign we are being told by
Mr. Nixon's supporters that the
opposite is true, that it is often
better not to draw the line at
which you intend to fight, that
it is often better to keep the ad
versary guessing? This is the
thesis which Mr. Lodge is pro
pounding and this is the position
taken by "Life" magazine in dis
cussing the lamentable Quemoy-
Matsu issue. Was Mr. Dulles
wrong when he called upon the
country "to make clear our posi
tion in advance" of a potential
aggression? What has happened
