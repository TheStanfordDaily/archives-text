Editor, the Daily:
I agree that an important part
of liberal education is to under
stand Ihe tenets of the political
ideologies to which the leaders
of the major segments of the
global population adhere.
However, I believe that con
scientious students will be re
pulsed by your irresponsible pres
entation of the issue. Apparently
you did not bother to check the
Bulletin of Courses and Degrees
to see what is already available
to the student who would like to
understand the history and goals
of Communism. Nor did you even
interview any of a number of
noted scholars in this field (ex
cluding Mr. Harriman) within our
own political science department
and Hoover Institution. Several
excellent courses are available.
Dr. North is currently giving a
course on Comparative Marxian
Ideologies. Here students are ex
posed to the basic teachings of
Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao
Tse-tung and Khrushchev. Each
student may further direct his in
terests to the key Communist
areas of Eastern Europe, Russia
or China and to particular ideo
logical conflicts in this area.
Every year the enrollment in this
course has increased in response
to the already growing popularity
of the subject.
I, too, hope mnny more students
participate in this study field.
However, instead of instigating a
campaign for compulsion, I think
the eventual goal—a better edu
cated society—will be more ef
ficiently effected by crealing more
interest and directing the newly
interested to the excellent oppor
tunities available. Those truly
dedicated will do more for the
cause of freedom, through under
standing, than the many who
merely increase their superficial
understanding because they were
compelled to take another course.

Shamefully many times I have
to admit that we have too many
pseudo-blondes and same number
of foreign sports cars on Stanford
campus. But I could proudly com
pensate the sense of shame being
on the campus because I have the
Stanford Daily which helps me to
neglect the blondes and the sports
cars. As a foreign student I would
like to express a strong feeling of
comradeship to the editorials;
especially for the ones of the last
few weeks.
But the editorial about the foot
ball game with San Jose State
College last weekend appears to
be not entirely correct. I am a
complete amatuer about the
American type football because
I do not know how to watch the
game. But I could tell one thing
at least, that is, our team did not
have any team-work but some of

the players tried to show off their
individual skill, and it was a com
plete failure a few times. There
was no spirit of aggressiveness
in the game.
Stanford must have a higher
esprit de corps and team-work not
only in playing football but in
student life as a whole. I do not
mean esprit de corps here as a
thick sticker of STANFORD on
the back window of a car, but I
mean one not easily visible. I won
dered many times how much we
are better than some other col
leges academically and athletic
ally.
Of course, the title of Stanford
University is very important but
we, as students, have to seek bet
ter things in human value than
i the mere title.
One more thing: if anyone
studied in the east alley of the
4th floor of the Main Lib stack
room he must notice many writ
ings and drawings on the wall
which I could hardly distinguish
from a public rest room wall. It
is riot a janitor's fault but our
turbid morality. A quadrangle
and a library of campus must be
a sanctuary of a college. I think
it is too shameful.
1 Cluing
Editor, (lie Daily:
I should like to make my posi
tion clear as regards the vote on
cards taken at Legislature last
Thursday night. While ihe Daily
did not mis-state my position, I
do not feel that it was well stated.
The main point made by the
Rally Commission member pres
ent was that, while Stanford stu
dents may not particularly like to
perform the card stunts, these
stunts must be done to keep up
the reputation of Stanford Uni
versity among Ihe alumni and
among the other schools. As I
understand it this is way Stan
ford tries to have the largest card
section on 1 he West Coast.
Schools like Cal can control
their card sections because they
are small enough to be exclusive;
i.e., misbehaving students can be
removed and their positions filled
by other students eager to partici
pate in the section.
Without this means of control,
the situation in our card section is
appalling. Attempts at control
have been made in the past and
have failed. As I view it, the rep

utation Stanford may gain by hav
ing a big and, possibly, well done
card show is completely blotted
out by Ihe immature and danger
ous card throwing that ensues.
As the Daily has pointed out,
there is already a law suit threat
ened because of these actions.
It is lucky that so few have
been injured so far by such ir
responsible behavior. Surely the
permanent personal injury that
can, and may have already, been
inflicted is not worth the reputa
tion gained by a card section. For
these reasons I voted against ap
propriating $375 for new cards.
I see no reason to continually pro
vide cards so that they can be
mutilated or thrown.
Since the means used so far to
solve this problem have failed, I
feel that much stricter ones; i.e.,
smaller card section, no card
stunts at Big Game etc., must be
employed.

Ideologies. Here students are ex
posed to the basic teachings of
Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao
Tse-tung and Khrushchev. Each
student may further direct his in
terests to the key Communist
areas of Eastern Europe, Russia
or China and to particular ideo
logical conflicts in this area.
Every year the enrollment in this
course has increased in response
to the already growing popularity
of the subject.
I, too, hope mnny more students
participate in this study field.
However, instead of instigating a
campaign for compulsion, I think
the eventual goal—a better edu
cated society—will be more ef
ficiently effected by crealing more
interest and directing the newly
interested to the excellent oppor
tunities available. Those truly
dedicated will do more for the
cause of freedom, through under
standing, than the many who
merely increase their superficial
understanding because they were
compelled to take another course.

Shamefully many times I have
to admit that we have too many
pseudo-blondes and same number
of foreign sports cars on Stanford
campus. But I could proudly com
pensate the sense of shame being
on the campus because I have the
Stanford Daily which helps me to
neglect the blondes and the sports
cars. As a foreign student I would
like to express a strong feeling of
comradeship to the editorials;
especially for the ones of the last
few weeks.
But the editorial about the foot
ball game with San Jose State
College last weekend appears to
be not entirely correct. I am a
complete amatuer about the
American type football because
I do not know how to watch the
game. But I could tell one thing
at least, that is, our team did not
have any team-work but some of

the players tried to show off their
individual skill, and it was a com
plete failure a few times. There
was no spirit of aggressiveness
in the game.
Stanford must have a higher
esprit de corps and team-work not
only in playing football but in
student life as a whole. I do not
mean esprit de corps here as a
thick sticker of STANFORD on
the back window of a car, but I
mean one not easily visible. I won
dered many times how much we
are better than some other col
leges academically and athletic
ally.
Of course, the title of Stanford
University is very important but
we, as students, have to seek bet
ter things in human value than
i the mere title.
One more thing: if anyone
studied in the east alley of the
4th floor of the Main Lib stack
room he must notice many writ
ings and drawings on the wall
which I could hardly distinguish
from a public rest room wall. It
is riot a janitor's fault but our
turbid morality. A quadrangle
and a library of campus must be
a sanctuary of a college. I think
it is too shameful.
1 Cluing
Editor, (lie Daily:
I should like to make my posi
tion clear as regards the vote on
cards taken at Legislature last
Thursday night. While ihe Daily
did not mis-state my position, I
do not feel that it was well stated.
The main point made by the
Rally Commission member pres
ent was that, while Stanford stu
dents may not particularly like to
perform the card stunts, these
stunts must be done to keep up
the reputation of Stanford Uni
versity among Ihe alumni and
among the other schools. As I
understand it this is way Stan
ford tries to have the largest card
section on 1 he West Coast.
Schools like Cal can control
their card sections because they
are small enough to be exclusive;
i.e., misbehaving students can be
removed and their positions filled
by other students eager to partici
pate in the section.
Without this means of control,
the situation in our card section is
appalling. Attempts at control
have been made in the past and
have failed. As I view it, the rep

utation Stanford may gain by hav
ing a big and, possibly, well done
card show is completely blotted
out by Ihe immature and danger
ous card throwing that ensues.
As the Daily has pointed out,
there is already a law suit threat
ened because of these actions.
It is lucky that so few have
been injured so far by such ir
responsible behavior. Surely the
permanent personal injury that
can, and may have already, been
inflicted is not worth the reputa
tion gained by a card section. For
these reasons I voted against ap
propriating $375 for new cards.
I see no reason to continually pro
vide cards so that they can be
mutilated or thrown.
Since the means used so far to
solve this problem have failed, I
feel that much stricter ones; i.e.,
smaller card section, no card
stunts at Big Game etc., must be
employed.

Shamefully many times I have
to admit that we have too many
pseudo-blondes and same number
of foreign sports cars on Stanford
campus. But I could proudly com
pensate the sense of shame being
on the campus because I have the
Stanford Daily which helps me to
neglect the blondes and the sports
cars. As a foreign student I would
like to express a strong feeling of
comradeship to the editorials;
especially for the ones of the last
few weeks.
But the editorial about the foot
ball game with San Jose State
College last weekend appears to
be not entirely correct. I am a
complete amatuer about the
American type football because
I do not know how to watch the
game. But I could tell one thing
at least, that is, our team did not
have any team-work but some of

the players tried to show off their
individual skill, and it was a com
plete failure a few times. There
was no spirit of aggressiveness
in the game.
Stanford must have a higher
esprit de corps and team-work not
only in playing football but in
student life as a whole. I do not
mean esprit de corps here as a
thick sticker of STANFORD on
the back window of a car, but I
mean one not easily visible. I won
dered many times how much we
are better than some other col
leges academically and athletic
ally.
Of course, the title of Stanford
University is very important but
we, as students, have to seek bet
ter things in human value than
i the mere title.
One more thing: if anyone
studied in the east alley of the
4th floor of the Main Lib stack
room he must notice many writ
ings and drawings on the wall
which I could hardly distinguish
from a public rest room wall. It
is riot a janitor's fault but our
turbid morality. A quadrangle
and a library of campus must be
a sanctuary of a college. I think
it is too shameful.
1 Cluing
Editor, (lie Daily:
I should like to make my posi
tion clear as regards the vote on
cards taken at Legislature last
Thursday night. While ihe Daily
did not mis-state my position, I
do not feel that it was well stated.
The main point made by the
Rally Commission member pres
ent was that, while Stanford stu
dents may not particularly like to
perform the card stunts, these
stunts must be done to keep up
the reputation of Stanford Uni
versity among Ihe alumni and
among the other schools. As I
understand it this is way Stan
ford tries to have the largest card
section on 1 he West Coast.
Schools like Cal can control
their card sections because they
are small enough to be exclusive;
i.e., misbehaving students can be
removed and their positions filled
by other students eager to partici
pate in the section.
Without this means of control,
the situation in our card section is
appalling. Attempts at control
have been made in the past and
have failed. As I view it, the rep

utation Stanford may gain by hav
ing a big and, possibly, well done
card show is completely blotted
out by Ihe immature and danger
ous card throwing that ensues.
As the Daily has pointed out,
there is already a law suit threat
ened because of these actions.
It is lucky that so few have
been injured so far by such ir
responsible behavior. Surely the
permanent personal injury that
can, and may have already, been
inflicted is not worth the reputa
tion gained by a card section. For
these reasons I voted against ap
propriating $375 for new cards.
I see no reason to continually pro
vide cards so that they can be
mutilated or thrown.
Since the means used so far to
solve this problem have failed, I
feel that much stricter ones; i.e.,
smaller card section, no card
stunts at Big Game etc., must be
employed.

comradeship to the editorials;
especially for the ones of the last
few weeks.
But the editorial about the foot
ball game with San Jose State
College last weekend appears to
be not entirely correct. I am a
complete amatuer about the
American type football because
I do not know how to watch the
game. But I could tell one thing
at least, that is, our team did not
have any team-work but some of

the players tried to show off their
individual skill, and it was a com
plete failure a few times. There
was no spirit of aggressiveness
in the game.
Stanford must have a higher
esprit de corps and team-work not
only in playing football but in
student life as a whole. I do not
mean esprit de corps here as a
thick sticker of STANFORD on
the back window of a car, but I
mean one not easily visible. I won
dered many times how much we
are better than some other col
leges academically and athletic
ally.
Of course, the title of Stanford
University is very important but
we, as students, have to seek bet
ter things in human value than
i the mere title.
One more thing: if anyone
studied in the east alley of the
4th floor of the Main Lib stack
room he must notice many writ
ings and drawings on the wall
which I could hardly distinguish
from a public rest room wall. It
is riot a janitor's fault but our
turbid morality. A quadrangle
and a library of campus must be
a sanctuary of a college. I think
it is too shameful.
1 Cluing
Editor, (lie Daily:
I should like to make my posi
tion clear as regards the vote on
cards taken at Legislature last
Thursday night. While ihe Daily
did not mis-state my position, I
do not feel that it was well stated.
The main point made by the
Rally Commission member pres
ent was that, while Stanford stu
dents may not particularly like to
perform the card stunts, these
stunts must be done to keep up
the reputation of Stanford Uni
versity among Ihe alumni and
among the other schools. As I
understand it this is way Stan
ford tries to have the largest card
section on 1 he West Coast.
Schools like Cal can control
their card sections because they
are small enough to be exclusive;
i.e., misbehaving students can be
removed and their positions filled
by other students eager to partici
pate in the section.
Without this means of control,
the situation in our card section is
appalling. Attempts at control
have been made in the past and
have failed. As I view it, the rep

utation Stanford may gain by hav
ing a big and, possibly, well done
card show is completely blotted
out by Ihe immature and danger
ous card throwing that ensues.
As the Daily has pointed out,
there is already a law suit threat
ened because of these actions.
It is lucky that so few have
been injured so far by such ir
responsible behavior. Surely the
permanent personal injury that
can, and may have already, been
inflicted is not worth the reputa
tion gained by a card section. For
these reasons I voted against ap
propriating $375 for new cards.
I see no reason to continually pro
vide cards so that they can be
mutilated or thrown.
Since the means used so far to
solve this problem have failed, I
feel that much stricter ones; i.e.,
smaller card section, no card
stunts at Big Game etc., must be
employed.

We should like to propose Ihe
following: SEEING THAT this is
an isolated farm community RE
IT RESOLVED THAT those per

I agree that an important part
of liberal education is to under
stand Ihe tenets of the political
ideologies to which the leaders
of the major segments of the
global population adhere.
However, I believe that con
scientious students will be re
pulsed by your irresponsible pres
entation of the issue. Apparently
you did not bother to check the
Bulletin of Courses and Degrees
to see what is already available
to the student who would like to
understand the history and goals
of Communism. Nor did you even
interview any of a number of
noted scholars in this field (ex
cluding Mr. Harriman) within our
own political science department
and Hoover Institution. Several
excellent courses are available.
Dr. North is currently giving a
course on Comparative Marxian
Ideologies. Here students are ex
posed to the basic teachings of
Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao
Tse-tung and Khrushchev. Each
student may further direct his in
terests to the key Communist
areas of Eastern Europe, Russia
or China and to particular ideo
logical conflicts in this area.
Every year the enrollment in this
course has increased in response
to the already growing popularity
of the subject.
I, too, hope mnny more students
participate in this study field.
However, instead of instigating a
campaign for compulsion, I think
the eventual goal—a better edu
cated society—will be more ef
ficiently effected by crealing more
interest and directing the newly
interested to the excellent oppor
tunities available. Those truly
dedicated will do more for the
cause of freedom, through under
standing, than the many who
merely increase their superficial
understanding because they were
compelled to take another course.

Shamefully many times I have
to admit that we have too many

of foreign sports cars on Stanford

on the campus because I have the

neglect the blondes and the sports
cars. As a foreign student I would
