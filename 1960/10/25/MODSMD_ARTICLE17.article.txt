# A 						SPORTING PROPOSITION
## 
### Ken Dery 
THE OLYMPIC creed tells us that the games are for individuals,
but it is fact that there were qualified men who could not compete
at Rome last summer because they were not citizens of any country.
One of these athletes is a 30-year-old Stanford senior. Miklos Tot
tossy is more than just a qualified athlete, however. Five minutes
of conversation with this handsome, square-shouldered ex-Hungarian
and you are priviledged to know a patriot, scholar, freedom fighter
and gentleman.
"One way or another," he told me, "politics has kept me out of

the Olympics for the fourth
straight time. Maybe I won't even
get the fifth chance."
MIKLOS WAS born in Buda
pest, Hungary, and very early
lie became an athlete. "My father
put me in the water when I was
two. That was my first sport
swimming."
"In Hungary a wide variety of
sports are all required subjects
in the elementary schools. In the
first grade all of the boys had to
learn the basic sports of swim
ming, gymnastics, rope climbing,
low bars, track and soccer. Then
later on in the fourth grade we
got some training in boxing."
It was in school that the spark
of competition was developed in
Miklos, a spark that has played a
vital part in many later aspects of
his life.
IT WAS EASY to see the pain

and suffering in those fiery yet soft green eyes as Miklos related the
story of his imprisonment in 1949.
The political issue really began at the time of the Olympic Games
in 1948. Having easily qualified in kayak racing the 6-foot, 185-
pound youth of 18 was extremely eager to go. (If you've never seen
a kayak, it is a form of boat which originated with the Eskimos. The
craft are light at 26 pounds and measure only 20 inches wide. They
are propelled by double-shoveled oars.) The coach of the Hungarian
rowing team, seeing how badly the wavy-haired Miklos wanted to
escape to freedom, arranged for him to go to a university in Europe
and not return to Hungary after his competition. "I was naive and
was overheard talking one night and just before the games the
secret police came and locked me up."
Took Up the Fight Against Communism
Having thus been deprived by the iron hand of the Communists,
Tottossy joined the underground soon after his release. Then late
in the year he was taken into custody by secret service agents. It
seems he was declared an enemy of the state for (a) taking part
in anti-Communist student demonstrations and (b) being one of Car
dinal Mindszenty's bodyguards.
"They put me in solitary confinement," lie went on. "I was in
that cell alone tor 14 months before my trial came up. They sen
tenced me to 13' 2 years of hard labor. All I saw were coal mines and
uranium mines in the mountain country near the Czech border."
Miklos broke free during the '56 revolution and from Austria he
made his bid for U.S. entry. He was flown to McGuire Air Force Base,
and it was through the agency of the National Academy of Sciences,
with funds of the major foundations, that he was granted a scholar
ship to Stanford. To give some idea as to Miklos' abilities as a scholar
we see that when he came to this country he did not know a single
word of English. But as soon as he developed some linguistic skill
he began at Stanford as a sophomore. He currently is taking both
undergraduate and graduate courses and is a member of Sigma Chi.
But why didn't Tottossy represent the United Stales at Rome
last summer? In the hope that his citizenship could be expedited
under the Early Naturalization Act, Miklos entered Olympic trials
in kayak racing in Niles, Michigan, and then a final round of trials
on Lake Sebago, N.Y.
"I had the best time for 500 meters, so I looked forward to being
a part of the 2,000-meter relay. But they had to drop me from the
team when my citizenship didn't come through.
House Un-American Activities Committee Shows Its Authority
THIS BRINGS UP A very touchy issue. In 1956, 1952, and 1948
certain immigrant athletes became citizens of the United States in
a hurry so as to let them compete in the games. Why not I960?
Miklos thinks the key was Congressman Francis Walters. After
the bill granting quick citizenship to Tottossy and four others had
passed the Senate it arrived at the House of Representatives. There
Congressman Walters' House Un-American Activities Committee
blocked the proposal on the grounds that Communists would use
such action for propaganda.
One idea that has been suggested to ex-patriots is that they band
together and represent the United Nations, but it is doubtful that
such a team would be accepted. Miklos himself does not even like
the idea. "I am an American by choice. When I broke loose from
Hungarian tyranny, I had the privilege of seeking out a country to
live in. This is my America."
WHAT HAS HAPPENED to Miklos does not seem to be just.
The handsome steel-armed athlete has been denied the right to com
pete in the pinnacle of amateur competition. Not only prohibited
from competing when he was a member of a non-free nationâ€”
Miklos has not even been allowed to represent one which values
freedom above all else. Here is one vote for keeping politics out
of the Olympics.

One of these athletes is a 30-year-old Stanford senior. Miklos Tot
tossy is more than just a qualified athlete, however. Five minutes
of conversation with this handsome, square-shouldered ex-Hungarian
and you are priviledged to know a patriot, scholar, freedom fighter
and gentleman.
"One way or another," he told me, "politics has kept me out of

the Olympics for the fourth
straight time. Maybe I won't even
get the fifth chance."
MIKLOS WAS born in Buda
pest, Hungary, and very early
lie became an athlete. "My father
put me in the water when I was
two. That was my first sport
swimming."
"In Hungary a wide variety of
sports are all required subjects
in the elementary schools. In the
first grade all of the boys had to
learn the basic sports of swim
ming, gymnastics, rope climbing,
low bars, track and soccer. Then
later on in the fourth grade we
got some training in boxing."
It was in school that the spark
of competition was developed in
Miklos, a spark that has played a
vital part in many later aspects of
his life.
IT WAS EASY to see the pain

and suffering in those fiery yet soft green eyes as Miklos related the
story of his imprisonment in 1949.
The political issue really began at the time of the Olympic Games
in 1948. Having easily qualified in kayak racing the 6-foot, 185-
pound youth of 18 was extremely eager to go. (If you've never seen
a kayak, it is a form of boat which originated with the Eskimos. The
craft are light at 26 pounds and measure only 20 inches wide. They
are propelled by double-shoveled oars.) The coach of the Hungarian
rowing team, seeing how badly the wavy-haired Miklos wanted to
escape to freedom, arranged for him to go to a university in Europe
and not return to Hungary after his competition. "I was naive and
was overheard talking one night and just before the games the
secret police came and locked me up."
Took Up the Fight Against Communism
Having thus been deprived by the iron hand of the Communists,
Tottossy joined the underground soon after his release. Then late
in the year he was taken into custody by secret service agents. It
seems he was declared an enemy of the state for (a) taking part
in anti-Communist student demonstrations and (b) being one of Car
dinal Mindszenty's bodyguards.
"They put me in solitary confinement," lie went on. "I was in
that cell alone tor 14 months before my trial came up. They sen
tenced me to 13' 2 years of hard labor. All I saw were coal mines and
uranium mines in the mountain country near the Czech border."
Miklos broke free during the '56 revolution and from Austria he
made his bid for U.S. entry. He was flown to McGuire Air Force Base,
and it was through the agency of the National Academy of Sciences,
with funds of the major foundations, that he was granted a scholar
ship to Stanford. To give some idea as to Miklos' abilities as a scholar
we see that when he came to this country he did not know a single
word of English. But as soon as he developed some linguistic skill
he began at Stanford as a sophomore. He currently is taking both
undergraduate and graduate courses and is a member of Sigma Chi.
But why didn't Tottossy represent the United Stales at Rome
last summer? In the hope that his citizenship could be expedited
under the Early Naturalization Act, Miklos entered Olympic trials
in kayak racing in Niles, Michigan, and then a final round of trials
on Lake Sebago, N.Y.
"I had the best time for 500 meters, so I looked forward to being
a part of the 2,000-meter relay. But they had to drop me from the
team when my citizenship didn't come through.
House Un-American Activities Committee Shows Its Authority
THIS BRINGS UP A very touchy issue. In 1956, 1952, and 1948
certain immigrant athletes became citizens of the United States in
a hurry so as to let them compete in the games. Why not I960?
Miklos thinks the key was Congressman Francis Walters. After
the bill granting quick citizenship to Tottossy and four others had
passed the Senate it arrived at the House of Representatives. There
Congressman Walters' House Un-American Activities Committee
blocked the proposal on the grounds that Communists would use
such action for propaganda.
One idea that has been suggested to ex-patriots is that they band
together and represent the United Nations, but it is doubtful that
such a team would be accepted. Miklos himself does not even like
the idea. "I am an American by choice. When I broke loose from
Hungarian tyranny, I had the privilege of seeking out a country to
live in. This is my America."
WHAT HAS HAPPENED to Miklos does not seem to be just.
The handsome steel-armed athlete has been denied the right to com
pete in the pinnacle of amateur competition. Not only prohibited
from competing when he was a member of a non-free nationâ€”
Miklos has not even been allowed to represent one which values
freedom above all else. Here is one vote for keeping politics out
of the Olympics.

of conversation with this handsome, square-shouldered ex-Hungarian
and you are priviledged to know a patriot, scholar, freedom fighter
and gentleman.
"One way or another," he told me, "politics has kept me out of

the Olympics for the fourth
straight time. Maybe I won't even
get the fifth chance."
MIKLOS WAS born in Buda
pest, Hungary, and very early
lie became an athlete. "My father
put me in the water when I was
two. That was my first sport
swimming."
"In Hungary a wide variety of
sports are all required subjects
in the elementary schools. In the
first grade all of the boys had to
learn the basic sports of swim
ming, gymnastics, rope climbing,
low bars, track and soccer. Then
later on in the fourth grade we
got some training in boxing."
It was in school that the spark
of competition was developed in
Miklos, a spark that has played a
vital part in many later aspects of
his life.
IT WAS EASY to see the pain

and suffering in those fiery yet soft green eyes as Miklos related the
story of his imprisonment in 1949.
The political issue really began at the time of the Olympic Games
in 1948. Having easily qualified in kayak racing the 6-foot, 185-
pound youth of 18 was extremely eager to go. (If you've never seen
a kayak, it is a form of boat which originated with the Eskimos. The
craft are light at 26 pounds and measure only 20 inches wide. They
are propelled by double-shoveled oars.) The coach of the Hungarian
rowing team, seeing how badly the wavy-haired Miklos wanted to
escape to freedom, arranged for him to go to a university in Europe
and not return to Hungary after his competition. "I was naive and
was overheard talking one night and just before the games the
secret police came and locked me up."
Took Up the Fight Against Communism
Having thus been deprived by the iron hand of the Communists,
Tottossy joined the underground soon after his release. Then late
in the year he was taken into custody by secret service agents. It
seems he was declared an enemy of the state for (a) taking part
in anti-Communist student demonstrations and (b) being one of Car
dinal Mindszenty's bodyguards.
"They put me in solitary confinement," lie went on. "I was in
that cell alone tor 14 months before my trial came up. They sen
tenced me to 13' 2 years of hard labor. All I saw were coal mines and
uranium mines in the mountain country near the Czech border."
Miklos broke free during the '56 revolution and from Austria he
made his bid for U.S. entry. He was flown to McGuire Air Force Base,
and it was through the agency of the National Academy of Sciences,
with funds of the major foundations, that he was granted a scholar
ship to Stanford. To give some idea as to Miklos' abilities as a scholar
we see that when he came to this country he did not know a single
word of English. But as soon as he developed some linguistic skill
he began at Stanford as a sophomore. He currently is taking both
undergraduate and graduate courses and is a member of Sigma Chi.
But why didn't Tottossy represent the United Stales at Rome
last summer? In the hope that his citizenship could be expedited
under the Early Naturalization Act, Miklos entered Olympic trials
in kayak racing in Niles, Michigan, and then a final round of trials
on Lake Sebago, N.Y.
"I had the best time for 500 meters, so I looked forward to being
a part of the 2,000-meter relay. But they had to drop me from the
team when my citizenship didn't come through.
House Un-American Activities Committee Shows Its Authority
THIS BRINGS UP A very touchy issue. In 1956, 1952, and 1948
certain immigrant athletes became citizens of the United States in
a hurry so as to let them compete in the games. Why not I960?
Miklos thinks the key was Congressman Francis Walters. After
the bill granting quick citizenship to Tottossy and four others had
passed the Senate it arrived at the House of Representatives. There
Congressman Walters' House Un-American Activities Committee
blocked the proposal on the grounds that Communists would use
such action for propaganda.
One idea that has been suggested to ex-patriots is that they band
together and represent the United Nations, but it is doubtful that
such a team would be accepted. Miklos himself does not even like
the idea. "I am an American by choice. When I broke loose from
Hungarian tyranny, I had the privilege of seeking out a country to
live in. This is my America."
WHAT HAS HAPPENED to Miklos does not seem to be just.
The handsome steel-armed athlete has been denied the right to com
pete in the pinnacle of amateur competition. Not only prohibited
from competing when he was a member of a non-free nationâ€”
Miklos has not even been allowed to represent one which values
freedom above all else. Here is one vote for keeping politics out
of the Olympics.
