then slowed down as they played
the UCLA Brubabes to an 8-8

marked the second time in as
many starts this season that the
frosh have lied their opponents.

pushed the hosts all over the
field, forcing them to punt sev
eral times.

ended UCLA kicked from their
22-yard line. Papoose halfback
Steve Arch took the ball on his
own 39-yard line, cut to his right
and handed off to Ken Babajian,

who reversed down the left side
line for a 61-yard return and the
locals' only touchdown.
