# Harriers Lose To SC, UCLA
## 
### 
Stanford's harriers let their op
ponents gel ahead of them Satur
day, a fatal error in a cross coun
try race, and by Ihe time the In
dians put on their finishing rush,
the race against USC and UCLA
was already lost.
Rich Klier was the first Card
to cross the finish line of ihe four
mile run, but he was in fifth place,
almost. 30 seconds behind ihe
leader. In the triangular team
scoring, USC had 34 points, UCLA
finished with 40, and Stanford
trailed with 46. Unfortunately,
the low score wins.
COACH PAVTON .T ord a n
blamed the defeat on the youth
and inexperience of his team.
"They lost contact with the entire
opposing team in the middle of
the race," said Jordan. This was
primarily because the runners
were not sure of their own abil
ities and were afraid of too fast
a pace.
The coach was not discouraged,
however. "I still think it can be
the best cross country team I've
ever had." stated Jordan. "They
all can run much belter than they
showed."
ESPECIALLY pleasing was the
fine team running, as John North
way. Robin Ruble, and Bill Pratt
finished in a tight bunch.
Typical of the plight of the
Stanford runners was Dave
Boore, who closed with a great
rush to nose out two Trojans and
one Bruin, all by less than a sec
ond. The sad part was that Boore
had held back too long, and should
have been much farther up.
rather than battling for 15th
place.
This is all part of gaining ex
perience, and hopefully will be
put to good use this Saturday
when the Indian harriers get an
other chance against USC and
also take on Cal for the first
time.

"They lost contact with the entire
opposing team in the middle of
the race," said Jordan. This was
primarily because the runners
were not sure of their own abil
ities and were afraid of too fast
a pace.
The coach was not discouraged,
however. "I still think it can be
the best cross country team I've
ever had." stated Jordan. "They
all can run much belter than they
showed."
ESPECIALLY pleasing was the
fine team running, as John North
way. Robin Ruble, and Bill Pratt
finished in a tight bunch.
Typical of the plight of the
Stanford runners was Dave
Boore, who closed with a great
rush to nose out two Trojans and
one Bruin, all by less than a sec
ond. The sad part was that Boore
had held back too long, and should
have been much farther up.
rather than battling for 15th
place.
This is all part of gaining ex
perience, and hopefully will be
put to good use this Saturday
when the Indian harriers get an
other chance against USC and
also take on Cal for the first
time.
