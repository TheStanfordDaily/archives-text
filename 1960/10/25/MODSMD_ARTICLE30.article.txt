## 
### 
WASHINGTON <UPI> — The
United States will inform the
United Nations today that it
wants a full U.N. ailing of Cuba's
: charges of U.S. aggression, U.S.
officials said yesterday.
The idea is to show that Cuba
is the nation at fault in the U.S.-
i Cuban dispute.
But State Department officials
confirmed that the United States
! will insist that any on-the-spot
J investigation of the charges be
; conducted by representatives of
the Organization of American
j States (OAS).
Cuba has called on the U.N. to
i take up its charges that this coun
try plans an "invasion" against
J the government of Premier Fidel
: Castro. In agreeing to full debate,
, the United States looks upon the
' U.N. as a fine forum to bring out
the falsity of the Cuban charges.
At the same time, U.S. officials
j believe that any attempt to place
I the on-the-spot investigation un
; der U.N. jurisdiction would weak
en the OAS, the inter-American
regional system.
The special investigating com
mittee would be supervised by
the presidents of Mexico, Vene
zuela, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and
Costa Rica. They would be ex
pected to appoint representatives
to conduct the probe rather than
undertake it themselves.
It is believed that inclusion of
Mexico and Venezuela would dem
onstrate the committee's impar
: tiality, since both countries have
been sympathetic to Cuba.
The United States believes that
most of the Latin American re
publics endorse the idea of the
jon - the • spot investigation. How
ever. Cuba has indicated it will
! not allow an inquiry on its terri-
I tory.
