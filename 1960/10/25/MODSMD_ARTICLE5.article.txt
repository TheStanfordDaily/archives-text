# Kennedy Plans Risk U.S. Gold, Says Nixon
## 
### UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
Vice President Richard M.
Nixon said last night Seti. John
F. Kennedy's spending plans were
"a major contributing factor" to
the current world crisis in gold.
He warned that Kennedy's elec
tion could touch off a run on
America's shrinking gold stocks.
Nixon's charge, in a speech pre
pared for delivery at a GOP rally
in Pittsburgh, capped a day's
whistle-stop tour through
Pennsylvania where the vice pres
ident assailed his Democratic op
ponent for "disastrous" foreign
policy judgments thai could lead
to war.
He also charged, through his
press secretary, that "the Ken
nedy camp" itself was exploiting
the religious issue to solidify the
Catholic vote for the Democratic
nominee.
The latter blast was prompted
by a charge from Robert F. Ken
nedy, brother of the Democratic
nominee and his campaign man

ager, that some local Republican
groups were helping spread anti-
Catholic propaganda designed to
keep Kennedy out of the White
House.
In Illinois. Kennedy, lashing out
at Nixon on domestic and foreign
issues, said his opponent's charge
that he contributed to the gold
market price boom shows Nixon's
"signs of tension."
Kennedy told an applauding
audience in Rock Island, "I didn't
do it."
The Democratic presidential
nominee outlined what he called
"the Nixon gap'" the difference
between the Republican's "cam
paign promises and his actual
record."
Earlier, Kenned\ in an answer
to Nixon's latest telegram on their
forthcoming fifth television de
bate served notice that he in
tends to go on the air prepared to
"answer any questions" he may
be asked even it they do not re
late to Nixon's preferred topic of
Cuba.
