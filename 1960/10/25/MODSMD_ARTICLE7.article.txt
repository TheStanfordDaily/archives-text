# Daily Cal Feud Results In Independent Paper
## 
### 
A second newspaper is on the
stands at Cal 1 his morning, pub
lished by tho staff which walked
out of the Daily Californian of
fice yesterday in protest against
an action of the ASCU executive
committee. Meanwhile, the Daily
Cal is being put out by 150 stu
dent volunteers.
The Independent Californian.
as the new publication is called,
is in mimeograph form today, hut
will be printed on facilities at the
University of San Francisco be
ginning tomorrow, a spokesman
said. Arbitration between the fac
tions is possible, but nothing defi
nite was known yesterday.
THE EXECUTIVE committee
provoked the upheaval when it
adopted a by-law ruling that
henceforth the executive board it
self will direct editorial appoint
ments of student publications.
Also off the job today are the
staffs of the Pelican humor mag
azine, the Cal yearbook and the
literary and engineering publica
tions.

THE PUBLICATION of the
Daily Californian is now under
the direction of two members of
the student publications board.
The paper will have no editorial
policy until the staff problems
are straightened out and the ex
ecutive committee takes further
action, said Connie Johnson, one
of the new directors.
The executive committee's de
cision on appointments climaxed
a disagreement which began when
the Daily Cal endorsed a candi
j date for representation to the ex
com in upcoming elections. The
candidate favored the ex corn's
concerning itself with off-campus
issues, but was defeated in a run
-1 off election by a candidate favor
; ing consideration of only campus
! affairs.
The executive committee's first
move following the endorsement
was to fire Dan Silver, then Daily
i Cal editor and now head of the
independent paper, but the .stu
dent judicial council overruled
this. Sunday night the ex com
! decided to take control of the
newspaper and all other publica
tions by directing editorial ap
pointments.
Tho committee will select edi
tors from open applications rather
1 than the old method of selecting
from students who have worked
up in the ranks of the various
publications.
