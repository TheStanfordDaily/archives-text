# Dewey Levels Blast at Kennedy Policies
## Plugs Nixon Candidacy To Enthusiastic Crowd 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Thomas E. Dewey blasted Democratic presidential candidate John
F. Kennedy's farm, fiscal and foreign policies before a highly en
thusiastic capacity crowd in Memorial Auditorium yesterday.
The mustached Dewey, the Republican standard-bearer in 1914
and 1948, called for the election of Vice President Richard M. Nixon
as the more experienced and "bet-,

ter qualified" candidate.
He cited the Eisenhower admin
istration's "record of action" and
held that running the govern
ment "ought to be continued by
people who have proven they
know how to do it."
Dewey singled out Kennedy's
"not long" but "frightening" rec
ord on foreign affairs, and de
clared that "the issue of foreign
policy is the overriding one" in
this election year.
HE HIT the Massachusetts sen
ator's policy toward the Nation
alist Chinese strongholds of Que
moy and Matsu, saying that under
that policy a president could not
defend the two offshore islands.
Dewey said that if Kennedy did
not take a firm stand on defend
ing Quemoy and Matsu it might
result in the Red Chinese at
tempting to conquer the islands.
He wondered about the "omi
nous" results if the Democratic
nominee's present Quemoy-Matsu
program went into effect, and
drew loud applause by affirming
"we can never win by junning
away" from Communists.
He drew a parallel between
Kennedy's policy on the islands
and former Secretary of State
Dean Acheson's Korean policy.
Early in 1950 Acheson declared
that Korea was outside the U.S.
perimeter of defense.
THIS statement Dewey said,
was an invitation for the Com
munists to attack Korea, which
they did in June of that year.
Scoring Kennedy's "strong
words, weak action" and "weak
words, strong action" on Cuba,
the three-time governor of New
York severly criticized the Demo
crat's foreign policy record.
He declared that Kennedy has
been "wrong" on a long line of
foreign issues, compared to Nix
on's record of working with Pres
ident Eisenhower toward success
ful solutions on such crises as
Lebanon.
"We can't afford a president
who is weak once, because with
that we could lose our freedom,"
Dewey told the audience.
E AR L I E R in his 35-minute
speech, Dewey upheld his party's
fiscal record and lashed Ken
nedy's budget program.
He said the Democrat would
"abolish the law of supply and
demand" and to make his policies
work would have to "take over
control of the Federal Reserve"
system, which, of course, would
be violating the law.
Dewey predicted Kennedy's
i election would "set off the worst
wave of inflation in the" coun
[ try's history, saying that the
Democrats would add $16 billion
to current governmental expenses.
Pointing out the Eisenhower ad
ministration's "solid currency,"
he also said "this administration
can take fair credit for creating
600 million new jobs."
ON THE farm front, Dewey
â€¢ praised Nixon's program for a
I "Crash" farm surplus distribu
' tion program overseas, and said
! Kennedy's program would mean
i placing all crops under controls
I and would necessitate govern
| ment licensing of all farm fields.
A Department of Agriculture
i study showed, he continued,
Kennedy's farm policy would re
: quire 50.000 inspectors to initiate
j and would increase food costs by
J 25 per cent.
Dewey summed up by declaring
! "in everything you can think ot
i there's been more progress than
J ever before" in the Eisenhower
administration's eight years in
I office.
