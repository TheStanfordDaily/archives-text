Thomas E. Dewey's speech Monday afternoon was, as one per
son has put it, . . insults to their (students) knowledge and
intelligence" (see Steam and Esteem).
In defending the Republican administration, Mr. Dewey took
us on a trip around the world, stopping at various countries
where the United States has nipped revolutions in the hud and
where we have rooted out Communist leaders, such as Arhenz in
Guatemala.
But there were a couple of countries which Dewey failed to
mention. Hungary, for instance. What was the administration
doing when the Hungarians revolted against Communist tyranny?
How do we explain that we comforted the Hungarians by assur
ing them of action against the Communists, and then when the
Hungarians pleaded for assistance we sat on our hands as thous
ands were slaughtered? How do we explain to the Hungarians
that we built tip their hopes, then let them down, probably nulli
fying another revolutionary attempt in that country for many
years to come?
Mr. Dewey also neglected to mention Cuba. It is a known
fact that two Republican Ambassadors in Cuba warned the ad
ministration that Castro, who was approaching Havana, had defi
nite Communist sympathies and that some of his cohorts were
confirmed Communists. Why were these warnings ignored?
But the most important and disastrous of Mr. Dewey's state
ments was the one we have been getting from all the Republican
leaders. Mr. Dewey agreed with Mr. INixon and Mr. Lodge that
the United States is just as secure now as it was seven and one-half
years ago.
How can any American who is honest with himself really
believe that? During the f>o's, Communists made huge gains
throughout the world. It is true that there were many more
dictatorships in the world at the beginning of the Republican
administration then there are.now, but this has little significance.
What Republicans don't realize is that the spread of Com
munism cannot be accurately measured by numbers of dictator
ships. Communism is much more effective in winning the minds
of men at this particular stage in its development, than in win
ning the lands of men. The land will become theirs when they
control the men. How does one measure the effectiveness of
Communism on this basis?
There are some facts which help us. At the present time,
one billion people, approximately one-third of the world's popu
lation, are under the thumb of Communism. This means that
in a little more than 40 vears the Communists have come to rule
more people than so-called Christian nations have come to rule
in nearly two thousand years!
For every child in school who is learning Christian ideals and
ethics there are five children in school who arc learning Com
munist ideology. For every engineer or scientist produced in
the free world- the Communists are producing three- and when
the Chinese star! to produce, and it won't be long, the Commu
nists will be producing ten to our one.
Here are just a few of the facts. How can anyone suggest in
the face of such knowledge that America is just as strong now
as it was twenty-five, twenty, or seven and one-half years ago?
When are Americans going to realize that every day we re
main complacent the Communists gain a little? When are some
of our Republican leaders going to stop deluding themselves and
us with what we want to hear instead of what we MUST hear?
When are we going to realize that great sacrifices must be
made if we are to defeat Communism? Senator Kennedy realizes
the danger and he has stated it time and time again. es, with
Senator Kennedy as president we probably will have higher taxes,
but this is just an example of the sacrifices we must make. All
the money in the world won I do us a bit of good if we fall prey
to the (Communists.
