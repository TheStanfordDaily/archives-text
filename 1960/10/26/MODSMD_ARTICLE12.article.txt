Editor, the Daily:
To the editorial athlete who
made his claim to fame last Mon
day, I address this letler. As usual
the current Daily has shown a
narrow view of the situation in
which it purports to bo an expert.
If you will consider that Stan
ford's academic requirements are
about the same as they have been
in past years in proportion to
other schools, you will see that
comment to the effect that ath
letes are discouraged by our high
standards is erroneous, to say the
least.
For, as Stanford has raised its
requirements, so have other
schools. You also give the impres
sion that only ninety-pound weak
lings attend Stanford, which you
would see is not true if you were
to walk across Quad once in
awhile instead of enclosing your
self in the Daily Shark. And it is
not just Stanford which is doing
poorly sportwise.
Look at the whole state of Cali
fornia -Cal. UCLA, and use. As
sportscaster Tom Harmon says,
this is one of those peculiar "bad
years" for football. It is good to
see your sports editor has not
been infected with your attitude,

but Ihen he knows something
about football.
It is one thing to criticize the
coach and/or the team, but quite
another to suggest "Ihrowing in
the towel." Instead of trying to
spread your quitter's spirit, why
not try a little "needling" the
team to get on the ball, so to
speak, or better yet, a little en
couragement ? Too often the Daily
forgets it appears to people be
yond the four corners of Quad as
the campus spokesman.
Of course, we know better. Rut
for the sake of those papers cir
culating off campus, try to forget
once in awhile that you represent
only the Stanford elite, i.e., the
editorial board. And before com
posing your narrow—though of
course enlightened—editorials,
look around and realize that there
are a few thousand peons here
who dislike being apparently rep
resented by a defeatist press.
Until there is a competing news
paper on campus or a student
body-elected editor, remember
that you give Ihe impression of
representing the Stanford student
body, to whom because of this
dastardly state of affairs, you
owe some form of responsibility.
