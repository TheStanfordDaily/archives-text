Editor, the Daily:
Having seen one editorial with
which I agree, I wish to express
my complete support of your
ideas. I admire your courage to
write what you think, and I wish
more people would do ihe same.
I. too, feci that a course in Com
munism and in Communist ideol
ogy should not only be offered
but made mandatory for juniors
and seniors, and that it should he
made ready as soon as possible.
The majority of citizens of the
United States have no idea of the
earnestness with which the people
of the USSR are determined to
spread Communism throughout
the world, and a course such as
this would at least give some idea
of their dedication to this purpose.
We in the United States are not
going to be able to form a posi
tive doctrine to spread freedom
effectively without knowing the
ideas of those trying to destroy
it. I have confidence in Stanford
University to realize the impor
tance of this course, and in Hie
Stanford students to take it seri
ously.

The Stanford student body de
serves great credit for the good
manners il exhibited in sitting pa
tiently through Thomas E.
Dewey's histrionic demonstration
at Mem And Monday afternoon.
The Stanford students should be
complimented, too, on their polite,
but effective, mass exodus from
the auditorium to show their dis
dain for the insults to their knowl
edge and intelligence.

I have read with a great deal of
interest the AP piece concerning
your reaction to Stanford's foot
ball plight. My interest stems
from two factors: (1)1 was the
editor of the Daily Northwestern
in 1958-59 and it was my privi
lege to write ihe editorial urging
NU's "no" vote on the Rose Bowl
and receive the scorn and wrath
that resulted from the "subway"
alumni.
I was a reporter on the Daily
NU in 1955 when an editorial cam
paign was waged on exactly the
same situation as the one you are
now facing. The question then
was to get out of the Big 10 or
re-emphasize football. The admin
istration chose the latter course.
(2) My younger brother, now a
three-sport athlete and "A'' stu
dent in high school, hopes to at
tend the best school possible.
My understanding is that only
half of Stanford's football team at
present is on athletic scholarship.
To me, this indicates that perhaps
Stanford's athletes aren't "dumb
animals" as elsewhere. This is im
portant. Since he wants to play
college ball, if possible. but doesn't
want the ties and false charity of
an athletic scholarship, he has
been leaning to Stanford rather
than going East to college.
In this context, my purpose in
writing you is to offer encourage
ment to advocate leaving the
AAWU rather than re-emphasiz
ing football. Marred by the taints
surrounding the old PCC, it would
be better for Stanford to play a
lesser caliber of football outside
the high-pressure recruiting
AAWU for a few years until the
NCAA and common sense prevail
as they eventually must to "con
tain" big-time football within
limits that the faculty can swal
low and the alumni can accept.
When the suggestion was made
that NU leave the Big 10, Ihe cry
was "who'd we play? My answer
is that Stanford, Northwestern,
plus Duke, Vanderbilt, Rice, per
haps, plus some top independent

private East Coast schools could
form a six to eight team league,
continental in scope.
Not only would it rival the Ivy
League, but I believe it would
bring further prestige (that
naughty wordi to each of the
schools. Admittedly the plan is a
dream and I think it's fair to call
it radical, but 1 do believe the
idea must bo planted as widely as
possible. As Time magazine (of
all things) pointed out in its Oct.
17 issue on California higher edu
cation, the gap between public
and private schools is widening
each year.
We're nearing the point where
it is becoming foolhardy to com
pete athletically with state sup
ported schools regularly. It is fi
nancial suicide to compete in re
cruiting and it is morally dis
couraging to have athletes on
campus who as a group—rank
much lower academically than the
rest of the student body.
This disparity will also grow
as private schools accept only the
more brilliant scholars because of
popidation increase. This is why
to me the only sensible thing to
do is for the private universities
to band together athletically and.
with an Ivy League-type control
on athletics, keep the whole thing
within bounds. Further, I hardly
think the student body and alumni
could complain about a schedule
that included such schools as I
have mentioned.
I believe it is much more accept
able than playing San Francisco
State or Illinois Normal. In ad
dition, I thing the Northwestern
example of the past five years
has shown how futile it is to ex
pect a sustained program of foot
ball emphasis to bear permanent
results. Even the best NU teams
of this period—ones that were
top-ranked nationally — couldn't
keep the pace because of a lack
of depth, something that is almost
impossible for a private institu-j
tion to overcome.
They faltered in mid-season be
cause the regulars were just too
tired compared to the rotated
players which the state schools
could provide. Thus, if Stanford
looks to re-emphasis, the NU ex
ample I believe demonstrates the
futility of the project.
One more point, since the idea
is to equalize the level of compe
tition, i do not suggest that the
Continental League extend to
more than football and basketball.
Gate receipts could pay for the
extra transportation involved in
these sports, but it would not in
the minor sports. In addition, the
level of competition in minor
sports is fairly even within the
region (Midwest or Pacific Coast i
because they are generally not the
object of such intensive emphasis.
Thus, Stanford, Northwestern,

etc., would not have 1o completely
sever athletic ties with the Goliath
schools.

I realize that there is much ani
mosity of pedestrians against bike
riders on campus, but I feel that
there is no pood reason for the
indiscriminate knocking over of
many bicycles parked outside of
dormitories or in areas outside of
classrooms and other such mis
treatment.
I realize that sometimes path
ways and sidewalks are blocked
by bikes, but such action often
damages valuable bicycles and
creates further hazards for pedes
trians, riders coming to get their
bikes and other bike riders com
ing into the area.
Is it possible to have a truce
between bike riders, pedestrians
and automobile drivers, each side
volunteering to obey the laws and
dictates of good taste and com
mon sense?

The Daily's column entitled
"Failure of Militarism" was in
deed nauseating in its entirety.
Patric Henry's famous brand of

patriotism in "Give me liberty or
give mo death" has finally found
an opponent in Mr. Richards who
in the event his pen fails in the
war against the Communist ide
ology would rather he a slave of
communism and alive than to he
dead as a result of a war for free
dom.
Is Mr. Richards in favor of the
I Russians' plan for disarmament
as a last effort to stave off war?
Mr. Richards seems so typical
of that brand of fellow-travelers
and one-worlders who advocate
that all men should be equal. I
grant that all men are indeed
created equal but weren't given
the instinct to stay that way.
ICqnal men are not tree and free
men are not equal.
These people would like to

make a Native Dancer out of th<
old grey mare but of course th(
opposite would likely result
mediocrity in a sterile society.
Both parties have written plat
forms that plead for the welfar<
state and openly proclaim "onlj
ihe means are different ."I tell yoi
that the welfare state is a gian
step toward socialism and social
ism leads to the seat of commit
nism like the legs of a pair o
pants!
