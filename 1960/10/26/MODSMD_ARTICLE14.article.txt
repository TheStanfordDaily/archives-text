Everything's Happening
There are a lot of things we could havo written about today. The
thrill of a last-minute home run in the final game of the World
Series is still a fresh memory it made world champions of the
Pittsburgh Pirates in their first series appearance since 1927.
Just last week a bounce-bounce-bounce sounded on the ancient
boards of Encina as advocates of the roundbali, the Stanford basket
hall team, started workouts.
The season, however, is football. When the leaves are tailing
and the days are shortening 1 baseball is in the past and basketball
will come soon enough. Football is the sport right now and, if there
aren't many things to cheer about on the Farm, there are some
bright spots elsewhere in the West.
One of the best of an exciting crop of sophomores during the cur
rent coast grid season is Terry Baker of Oregon State. Baker, a rela
tive newcomer to a starting role, first took over the top tailback
position for Tommy Protho's Beavers two weeks ago against Idaho
after Don Kasso, the former number one back was injured.
Baker didn't take long making a name for himself as he passed
and ran for 284 yards to lead OSC to a 28-8 rout over the Vandals.
Then last Saturday Terry almost engineered the single-wing
northmen past the Hose Bowl champion Washington Huskies. In this
one the sophomore flash chalked itp 802 yards against a team that
lias held its opponents' entire teams to an average of less than his
personal total. Baker also scored the first two touchdowns and set
np the others in a contest that saw the Huskies barely edge the
fighting Beavers, 30-29.
Even more amazing is the fact that Terry didn't even go out for
Frosh football; he spent his time playing basketball and led the
Orange and Black Rook squad in scoring.
The 6-3, 195-pound back from Portland was also impressive in
high school, making all-state in three different sports.
Stanford folks will get a chance to see Baker in action when the
Beavers visit the Farm on November 12. The thing that will add a
note of frustration to the scene is the fact that Baker was headed
for Stanford, until he changed his mind shortly before fall quarter
a year ago.
Fans as well as players make the news. UCLA rooting section
treated spectators attending the night-time Bruin-Stanford game at
the Coliseum to a display of their famous colored-light halftime
stunts. Instead of colored cards, every rooter has a flashlight with
colored filters and the stunts are done in various colors.
The UCLA rooting section readied themselves, the Coliseum arcs
went out. and the visiting Stanford fans pulled their own halftime
stunt by having light-up time; everyone in the Farm section held
a small glowing torch to create a nice distraction effect of their own.
Evenutally the Card light section dimmed and the hosts began
portraying the Golden Gate, Old Faithful, the Grand Canyon . . .
and somehow the UCLA campus was fitted in with these national
landmarks. That's about the only snide thing we can say, however,
about a halftime display that certainly should rate as one of the
best and most imaginative in a long while.
The Big Red Machine
Speaking of halftime shows, a Stanford performance several
weeks ago was likely to have raised a few eyebrows. As you know,
politics of a radical sort has found its way into the Farm journalism
world: then it moved into the football arena. First the Stanford
Daily turned liberal and then, during the halftime of the Washing
ion game, before a national TV audience, the Indian card section
formed an outline of the U.S. which gradually was filled in by a
red tide emanating from the Farm! Oh well . . . not many of the
30 million viewers had color sets.
No matter what you think, those grad students aren't dead yet.
Just last week there they wereâ€”complete with briefcases, coats and
beards - holding an impromptu bicycle slalom race around the pillars
of the post office and bookstore while one of the more sedentary
ancient ones stood at the finish line, carefully clocking each rider
with a watch. . . . Sport is where you find it.
