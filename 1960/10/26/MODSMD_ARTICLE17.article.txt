STANFORD just got rid of
.some unwelcome guests in the
j form of the San Jose Spartans,
tidied up the old homestead and
then found out that a horde of
black sheep relatives to the soulh,
the USC Trojans, have invited
' themselves up for a weekend at
| the Farm.
Southern Cal is not only send
i ing an up-and-coming football
squad for the Saturday afternoon
! encounter with the Indians, but
i 4,300 SC rooters are bringing
' their dark glasses and tooth
brushes in a mass exodus of
smogland.
The Trojans, rated highly in
preseason polls, surprisingly lost
their first three games of the year
to Oregon State, Texas Christian
1 and Ohio State. Part of the rea
i .son was trouble learning the of
i fense of new head coach John
; McKay, . but the southlanders
i picked up and won their last two,
including a 27-10 victory over Cal
j in Troy's most recent start.

MARLIN McKEEVER, half of
the famous SC brother act, should
play most of the game at right
end while terrible Mike, the more
publicized twin, probably will see
limited action ai left guard. Mar
lin started the season at fullback
and he picked up 26 yards in four
carries before being returned to
his more familiar end position.
Hal Tobin. Lynn Gaskill, Bob
Levingston and Alan Shields have
all picked up 125 yards or more
on the ground to lead a balanced
rushing attack.
THROI Gil the air the Trojans
rely on the talented arms of sen
ior Al Prukop, who has 107 yards
passing, and junior signal-caller
Ben Charles, who has completed
14 of 30 throws for 154 yards and
a .470 percentage.
In the line an old face in the
person of Dan Ficca will be seen.
Ficca was outstanding in his
sophomore year, was hampered
by injuries last season and is back
to make trouble as a started this
year.

Southern Cal is not only send

squad for the Saturday afternoon

i 4,300 SC rooters are bringing
' their dark glasses and tooth
brushes in a mass exodus of
smogland.
The Trojans, rated highly in
preseason polls, surprisingly lost
their first three games of the year
to Oregon State, Texas Christian
1 and Ohio State. Part of the rea
i .son was trouble learning the of

i picked up and won their last two,
including a 27-10 victory over Cal
j in Troy's most recent start.

MARLIN McKEEVER, half of
the famous SC brother act, should
play most of the game at right
end while terrible Mike, the more
publicized twin, probably will see
limited action ai left guard. Mar
lin started the season at fullback
and he picked up 26 yards in four
carries before being returned to
his more familiar end position.
Hal Tobin. Lynn Gaskill, Bob
Levingston and Alan Shields have
all picked up 125 yards or more
on the ground to lead a balanced
rushing attack.
THROI Gil the air the Trojans
rely on the talented arms of sen
ior Al Prukop, who has 107 yards
passing, and junior signal-caller
Ben Charles, who has completed
14 of 30 throws for 154 yards and
a .470 percentage.
In the line an old face in the
person of Dan Ficca will be seen.
Ficca was outstanding in his
sophomore year, was hampered
by injuries last season and is back
to make trouble as a started this
year.
