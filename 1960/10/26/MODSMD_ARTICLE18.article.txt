# Stanford Water Poloists Top SF State for First Victory
## 
### 
Stanford's water polo squad
finally came through with a vic
tory as tho Big Red clobbered a
hapless San Francisco State
squad by a 14-8 margin.
Led by Bob Lorton and Bob
Spence, who scored five and four
goals respectively, the Indians
dominated every quarter but the
last to romp home easy winners.
Roger Johnson with two goals
and Dick Rosenberger and Mike
Conn with one each added to the
Card total.
The win over the Gators brings
the Indian record for the year to
one win and four losses and broke
what might have been a winless
season.
The frosh water poloists also
came through with a win as they
smothered the Santa Clara var
sity by a surprisingly large 16-3
score.
After going ahead by a 4-0
count at the first quarter, the
Papooses scored eight more in
the second stanza to make it a
rout.

Pete Pettigrew topped all scor- j
ers with six goals and Bill Lorton
fired in four. Jim Youd and An
son Garnsey scored three count- j
ers each to round out the Cards'
scoring for the day.
The Papoose win gives them a
record of four wins and only one
loss for the current campaign.
The next tests for the Card wa
ter poloists will come this week
end when they take on Fullerton

JO. and USC. The Trojans wal
loped the Indians 21-2 in thoii*
last meeting, and Fullerton has
beaten the Troymen, so it looks
like another rough weekend for
Stanford.
Stanford's frosh will also see
plenty of action this weekend as
they meet a Los Altos High
School aggregation that generally
comes up with a top team, and
Woodside High School.
