The United States of America
may be "drowsily moving into the
Indian summer of its existence"
according to Thomas G. Lanphier
Jr., who presented his views on
national power and defense to a
near-capacity audience last night
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Lanphier maintained that Pres
ident Eisenhower and the Ameri
can people are deceiving them
selves with "empty words" con
cerning the amount of U.S. power
and prestige.
TIIK U.S. IS fighting a "new
kind of war," he stated, and must
develop a larger conventional
fighting force as a "deterent to
limited aggression." The Soviet
Union is completely aware of our
strengths and weaknesses and is
becoming more and more sure of
itself in word and action.
The U-2 incident, he stated, was
"immoral." but necessary, as is
a continuance of underground
nuclear testing.
A sufficient deterent and re
taliation system can "be bought
within the next two or three
years." Lanphier concluded, but
he stressed that even this will do
no good if the government does
not "organize more efficiently to
use the available weapons, both
physical and psychological."
