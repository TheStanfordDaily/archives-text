A FRAT TO REMEMBER
Every year, as we all know, tlie Benevolent and Protective
Order of Collegiate Fraternities awards a highly coveted prize
to the fraternity house which, in its judgment, has done the
most to promote and enhance the fraternity way of life. The
prize this year—eight hundred pounds of white putty—goes to
the Signa Phi Nothing chapter of the South Dakota College
of Dentistry and Renaissance Art.
The award this year is exceptionally richly deserved, for the
Signa I'lii Nothing house is the very model of all a fraternity
should be. It is, first of all, a most attractive house physically.
The outside walls are tastefully covered with sequins. Running
along the upper story is a widow's walk, with a widow stationed
every three feet. Moored to the chimney pot is the Graf Zeppelin.
Indoors, the house gives an impression of simple, casual charm.
The chapter room is furnished in homey maple and chintz,
with a dash of verve provided by a carp pool three hundred feet
in diameter. A waterspout rises from the center of the pool with
the housemother bouncing on the top.
Members' rooms are gracious and airy and are provided with
beds which disappear into the wall—permanently. Each room
also has a desk, a comfortable chair, a good reading lamp, and
a catapult for skeetshooting. Kidney-shaped desks arc avail
able for kidney-shaped members.
Perhaps the most fetching feature of the house are the packs
of Marlboros stacked in heaps wherever one goes. If one wishes
to settle back and enjoy a full-flavored smoke, one needs only
to reach out one's hand in any direction and pick a pack of
Marlboros—soft pack or flip-top box—and make one's self com
fortable with a filtered cigarette with an unfiltered taste—that
triumph of the tobacconist's art, that paragon of smokes, that
acme of cigarettes, that employer of mine—Marlboro!

The decor, tlie grace, the Marlboro?, all combinc to make
Signa Phi Nothing a real gas of a fraternity. Hut a fraternity
is more than Unrigs; it is also people. And it is in the jieople
department that Signa Phi Nothing really shines.
Signa Phi Nothing has among its members the biggest
HMOC> on the entire campus of the South Dakota College of
Dentistry and Renaissance Art. There is, for instance, William
Makrpeact Sigiifoon, charcoal and bun chairman of the annual
Stamp Club outing. Then there is Dun Rovin, winner of last
year's All-South Dakota State Monopoly Championship, 136

there is in Signa I'hi Nothing, and when one sees them at the
house in the cool of the evening, all busy with their tasks
some picking locks, -ome playing Jacks-or-Hetter, some clipping
Playboy one's heart tills up and one's eyes grow misty, and
one cannot but give three cheers and a tiger for Signa I'hi

along the upper story is a widow's walk, with a widow stationed
every three feet. Moored to the chimney pot is the Graf Zeppelin.
Indoors, the house gives an impression of simple, casual charm.
The chapter room is furnished in homey maple and chintz,
with a dash of verve provided by a carp pool three hundred feet
in diameter. A waterspout rises from the center of the pool with
the housemother bouncing on the top.
Members' rooms are gracious and airy and are provided with
beds which disappear into the wall—permanently. Each room
also has a desk, a comfortable chair, a good reading lamp, and
a catapult for skeetshooting. Kidney-shaped desks arc avail
able for kidney-shaped members.
Perhaps the most fetching feature of the house are the packs
of Marlboros stacked in heaps wherever one goes. If one wishes
to settle back and enjoy a full-flavored smoke, one needs only
to reach out one's hand in any direction and pick a pack of
Marlboros—soft pack or flip-top box—and make one's self com
fortable with a filtered cigarette with an unfiltered taste—that
triumph of the tobacconist's art, that paragon of smokes, that
acme of cigarettes, that employer of mine—Marlboro!

The decor, tlie grace, the Marlboro?, all combinc to make
Signa Phi Nothing a real gas of a fraternity. Hut a fraternity
is more than Unrigs; it is also people. And it is in the jieople
department that Signa Phi Nothing really shines.
Signa Phi Nothing has among its members the biggest
HMOC> on the entire campus of the South Dakota College of
Dentistry and Renaissance Art. There is, for instance, William
Makrpeact Sigiifoon, charcoal and bun chairman of the annual
Stamp Club outing. Then there is Dun Rovin, winner of last

some picking locks, -ome playing Jacks-or-Hetter, some clipping
