# Cal Keeps Printing Indy Paper
## 
### GREG HOPKINS 
The Independent Californian is
in its second day of publication at
Berkeley this morning, and on a
paying basis, according to assist
ant editor Janie Semple. who for
merly held the same post with the
Daily Californian, until Monday
Cal's only newspaper.
A four - page, offset - printed.
5,000-copy press run inaugurated
the Independent Cal yesterday.
Copies, sold for 10 cents, were
snapped up by the students, re
sulting in enough money to en
able the new publication to slash
prices to a nickle today.
ADVERTISING orders poured
in, said Miss Semple, until the
Indy has more than it has room
to run. Many of the advertisers
are those who previously bought
space in the Daily Californian.
The new paper wants to cut its
sale price to the minimum neces
sary to stay in competition with
the free Daily Cal.
A staff of 150 volunteers is
continuing to publish the Daily
Cal with reasonable success, re
ported editor pro tern Walter
Frederick. Among the volunteers
are students from the University
of Wisconsin, Stanford, and Wil
liam •Randolph Hearst 111, said
Frederick.
The ASCU executive committee
provoked the former Daily Cal
staff to walkout and start their
own paper on Sunday when it de
cided, via a by-law change, that
the ex com itself would have
power of appointment for editors
of student publications. The ex
com met again last night.
ADMINISTRATION officials
took a "hands off" policy, declar
ing this to be entirely a student
affair, following a meeting Mon
day with now-Independent Cal
Editor Dan Silver.
The new paper's publishers,
said Miss Semple, are willing to
talk about reconciliation with the
ex com and the Daily Cal. but only
if reinstatement of the former
by-laws results, freeing the Daily
Cal from the direct, day-to-day
control of the executive commit
tee which the new ruling creates.
The old policy for editorial ap
pointments must be reinstated
too, say the walkouts.
"We won't give up our basic
principles" of freedom of the
press, said Miss Semple, adding
that "we're having a heck of a
good time doing this."

Cal's only newspaper.
A four - page, offset - printed.
5,000-copy press run inaugurated
the Independent Cal yesterday.
Copies, sold for 10 cents, were
snapped up by the students, re
sulting in enough money to en
able the new publication to slash
prices to a nickle today.
ADVERTISING orders poured
in, said Miss Semple, until the
Indy has more than it has room
to run. Many of the advertisers
are those who previously bought
space in the Daily Californian.
The new paper wants to cut its
sale price to the minimum neces
sary to stay in competition with
the free Daily Cal.
A staff of 150 volunteers is
continuing to publish the Daily
Cal with reasonable success, re
ported editor pro tern Walter
Frederick. Among the volunteers
are students from the University
of Wisconsin, Stanford, and Wil
liam •Randolph Hearst 111, said
Frederick.
The ASCU executive committee
provoked the former Daily Cal
staff to walkout and start their
own paper on Sunday when it de
cided, via a by-law change, that
the ex com itself would have
power of appointment for editors
of student publications. The ex
com met again last night.
ADMINISTRATION officials
took a "hands off" policy, declar
ing this to be entirely a student
affair, following a meeting Mon
day with now-Independent Cal
Editor Dan Silver.
The new paper's publishers,
said Miss Semple, are willing to
talk about reconciliation with the
ex com and the Daily Cal. but only
if reinstatement of the former
by-laws results, freeing the Daily
Cal from the direct, day-to-day
control of the executive commit
tee which the new ruling creates.
The old policy for editorial ap
pointments must be reinstated
too, say the walkouts.
"We won't give up our basic
principles" of freedom of the
press, said Miss Semple, adding
that "we're having a heck of a
good time doing this."
The Independent Californian is
in its second day of publication at
Berkeley this morning, and on a
paying basis, according to assist
ant editor Janie Semple. who for
merly held the same post with the
Daily Californian, until Monday
Cal's only newspaper.
