# Gorpy Chappie Tries Politics; Second Issue
## 
### ELLINGTON K. FARTHINGALE 
In the first issue of this year's
Chaparral, the word "gorp" ap
peared. It's a very funny word.
Of course, you won't find it in
the dictionary because it doesn't
really exist. But it does have
many unpleasant connotations
such as lousy, smelly, stinky, etc.
The second issue of the Chappie
is gorpy beyond belief. The theme
is politics and it is obviously
something in which the humor
boys should not mix. After yawn
ing one's way through the first
few pages, one is confronted by
"It's Time to Vote Royalist." This
could have been a pretty funny
stunt, but leave it to the Chappie
to make the humorous serious.
ANI) WHY did they do it in
green ink? Such a topic obviously
demanded blue!
The Definitions indicate that
the Chappie is overrun by nihi
lists. There's no place in this
great lan d of ours for you
crumbs. Here we've built a great
Empire and you tear it all down.
Wait'll I report you to the HUAC.
In an effort to save the Chap
arral from utter ruin, the Chap
pie staff included my name in
its "Letters to the Editor." Only
one mistake, fellas. I resent your
inference that I'm a female. Noth
ing against females, mind you
(especially the type fenrude ex
emplified by Dickey Barkloyi,
but I enjoy being a male. Besides,
now you've completely confused
my girl friend.
liltAI) EFRON'S "The Trail of
the Sea Gull," and Jon Reed's "All
Men Are Created Equal," saves
the Chappie from being a total
washout by presenting us with
some psychological insights into
the workings of madmen.
Then there's Dicky Barklcy,
who is a pretty big girl in a little
school, in spite of the Chappie's
attempt to mislead you. I also
know of someone who can take
care of her. Heh. heh. just jok
ing, Matilda, just joking.
The magazine is also pocked
with its usual amount of lewd,
lascivious jokes, only they're a
little more lewd and lascivious
this time and a little less funny.
Well, buck up fellow students,
the Chappie will probably make
another attempt in the near fu
ture and there's only one place
to go from the bottom.
