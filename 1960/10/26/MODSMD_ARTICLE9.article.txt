# Adm. Radford to Support Nixon On Quemoy Issue in Talk Here
## 
### 
Admiral Arthur V. Radford, who has backed Vice President Rich
ard M. Nixon on the Quemoy-Matsu issue, will speak on behalf of
the Republican campaign at 4:15 p.m. tomorrow in Memorial Au
ditorium.
Radford, who" was chairman of the 1 Joint Chiefs of Staff during

the 1954-55 crisis over Quemoy
and Matsu, has taken the position
that defense of the two islands is
a matter of principle.
He has said further that if the
Chinese Communists switch from |
artillery to aerial bombardment, [
this country should attack main-1
land bases.
This last view has been gen- j
erally opposed by President Ei
senhower as well as by the State |
Department. It was this known j
view on Radford's part that led |
Walter George, then chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, to insist that the de
fense of 'he two islands be left
vague and subject to decision by
the president.
In a statement made last week, |
Radford said that since 1955 the
Communists have "made per-1
fectly celar that their military ob
jective is Formosa not Quemoy j
and Matsu."
"THEY THEMSELVES insist
that these islands are stepping
â€¢stones to Formosa. So we must
continue to stress, as Mr. Nixon ;
has done, that we will accept them
at their word than an attack on
the islands is an attack on For
mosa and as such will be rle
fended."
Said Radford, "While Mr, Ken

nedy insists that ho supports the
administration position, his origi
nal statement was. in my opinion,
an invitation to attack Quemoy
and Matsu and. as such, a gieat
loreiLiii nolicv error.''
