PSYCHE
A thinking man's thinking
man, Psamuel finds that
thoughts come easiest
when he is most comfort
able.
That's why he always
wears Jockey brand T
shirts. He likes the way
the fine combed cotton
feels next to his skin. He
likes the way the twin
stitched, nylon-reinforced
collar keeps its shape.
And he likes the full-pro
portioned body and extra
long tail that never creeps.
You, too, will like your
self better when you enjoy
the comfort of Jockey
brand T-shirts. Your
favorite campus store
has them. $1.50
