# Adm. Radford to Back Nixon in Speech Today
## 
### 
Admiral Arthur E. Radford, loading United Slates military ox
port who favors the defense of Quemoy and Matsu, will campaign
here today for Vice President Richard M. Nixon at 4:15 in Memorial
Auditorium.
Radford's speech, sponsored by the Stanford Political Union, will

be his only Bay Area appearance.
Admission will be free on a first
come, first-served basis.
KADI'OKI), now retired, who
was chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff during the 1954-55 crisis
over Quemoy and Matsu, has
taken the position that defense of
the two islands is a matter of
principle.
Last week while campaigning
for the Nixon-Lodge ticket, he
called Kennedy's proposal to ex
clude the islands from the United
States defense perimeter a "great
foreign policy error" and an in
vitation for the Communists to
attack.
Radford said that since 1955
"the Communists have made per
fectly clear that their military ob
jective is Formosa- not Quemoy
and Matsu.
"THEY themselves, insist that
these islands are stepping stones
to Formosa. So we must continue
to stress, as Mr. Nixon has done,
that we will accept them at their
word that an attack on the is
lands is an attack on Formosa
and as such will be resisted."
While supporting Nixon's views
on Quemoy and Matsu, Radford
is known to hold more extreme
ideas on the subject of how to
handle Red China. He has insisted
that this country should attack
mainland bases if the Chinese
Communists switch from artil
lery to aerial bombardment of the
off-shore islands.
He has also said that the United
States should be willing "to fight
for fifty years if necessary"
rather than acquiesce in the con
solidation of Communist power
on the mainland.
IT WAS these known views that
some observers in Washington
feel led Walter George, Senate
Foreign Relat ions Committee
chairman at the time of the For
mosa defense treaty, to insist that
the defense of the two islands be
left vague and subject to decision
by the president.
Radford, who has served in
three wars beginning with World
War I, attained the rank of ad
miral as Commander in Chief of
the Pacific Fleet and high com
missioner of United States trust
territory in the Pacific after the
second world war.
HE BECAME chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1953 and
was reappointed in 1956.
In the past several weeks Rad
ford has been one of Nixon's chief
advisors on the Quemoy-Matsu
issue.
From 7:30 to 9 p.m. a faculty re
ception will be held in honor of
the admiral and his wife at the
Beta House. The reception is co
sponsored by Political Union and
Beta Theta Pi.
