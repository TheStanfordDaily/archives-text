The fate of the Independent
California!! will be a little more
definite in a few days, Editor Dan
Silver said yesterday, when the
actual student interest in sup
porting a second paper at Cal can
be determined.
Support so far has been mainly
in response to the sensational na
ture of the ASUC feud over con
trol of its publications.
ADVERTISING appeared for
the first time yesterday in the
offset-printed Independent Cal,
and a 5-cent donation was asked
from readers.
The Daily Californian has lost
only one former advertiser, re
ported editor pro tem Walter
Frederick, and has received
"many calls" commending the ap
pearance of the publication. A
staff of volunteers from the Cal
student body at large has pro
duced the regular Daily Cal since
Monday.
The staffs of the other ASUC
publications—the yearbook. Blue
and Gold; the humor magazine,
Pelican; the literary and engi
neering magazine s—"are still
functioning," said Frederick, de
spite the walkout of the former
Daily Cal staff to form a second
student organ.
AT A MEETING of the student
body executive committee Tues
day night, a proposal was made
to set up an impartial group to
frame a completely new set of
by-laws concerning the Daily Cal.
but the ex com would not renege
on its decision to hereafter hold
final control of all editorial ap
pointments. The ex com continued
to discuss the present by-laws,
but reached no conclusion.
The Independent Cai, its print
ing currently done by a Danville
firm, is investigating a permanent
arrangement for financing itself,
including perhaps subscription
sales, said Silver.
