# GOP Suppressing Report On Prestige, Kennedy Says
## Nixon Attacks Opponent For Downgrading Country 
### 
DETROIT—TOLEDO (UPI)—GOP presidential nominee Richard
M. Nixon spoke from the steps of the State Capitol at Toledo cur
rently under Democratic control, as his opponent toured Michigan
with new assaults on alleged administration efforts to hide reports
showing America's repute overseas at a low ebb.

Nixon, bitterly denouncing Sen.
John F. Kennedy's repeated
charge that U.S. prestige has
slipped in the world, drew his
wildest, biggest reception at
Columbus yesterday and pro
nounced the campaign tide turned
in his direction.
"THE AMERICAN people,
whether they are Democrats or
Republicans, are getting tired of
being told they are a second-rate
bunch of people and a second-rate
country," Nixon told a crowd esti
mated by Police Chief George
Scholer at 70,000 cheering, push
ing. howling persons.
In Dayton he told an estimated
20,000 rain - soaked enthusiasts
who the streets outside Mont
gomery County Courthouse that
Kennedy's latest "prestige"
charge was "disgraceful."
"I say it's wrong and he's got
to retract it,"he said.
Before delivering his speech,
Nixon told reporters his proposal
to resume testing after Feb. 1 if
there is no sign of agreement with
the Russians referred only to un
derground testing for peaceful
purposes.
IIE SAID Kennedy whom he
had blasted throughout the day
for a wide range of alleged fail
ings including his "disgraceful"
efforts to downgrade America—
had proposed test talks under
conditions "which would delay
any possible resolution of this
vital matter for much too long."
If agreement has been reached
or is in sight by Feb. 1. Nixon
said he will be prepared to meet
Premier Nikita Khrushchev and
British Prime Minister Harold
McMillan in new summit talks to
make a final agreement.
THE DEMOCRATIC; presiden
tial candidate, campaigning in
Michigan for the third time since
his nomination, also charged his
GOP opponent with a "political
cover-up" on the administration's
refusal to make public a secret
report on U.S. prestige abroad.
Kennedy said Nixon "tells us
repeatedly that in 1960 all is well
—that our prestige is at an all
time high that our prosperity is
unprecedented that we are ahead
militarily, scientifically and edu
cationally.
"Perhaps that fulfills his obli
gation in this election," the sen
ator added, "but I say we also
have an obligation to the next
generation, and we are not meet
ing that obligation today."
WE ARE not meeting thai re
sponsibility when our economy is
slipping into its third recession in
six years. We are not meeting the
needs of the future when 20 per
cent of our industrial capacity is
idle -when over 5 per cent of the
labor force is unemployed, and
I when the rate is even higher in
every major industrial city—here
in Detroit and in Pittsburgh, and
in Fort Worth, and in San Diego
and Seattle."
