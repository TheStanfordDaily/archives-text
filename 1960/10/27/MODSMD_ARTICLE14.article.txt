# Freedom Challenged
## 
### 
Wo liaVf abstained from commenting 011 the controversial san
ation surrounding the Daily Californian walkout of this week until
the issue reached some kind of impasse. \\ e feel that tlie impasse
has now been reached.
In summary, the Daily Californian quit en masae Monday to
protest action initiated by the powerful executive committee of
the Associated Students Sunday. The Ex (loin passed a by-law
which states that it has the authority lo appoint all start" members
of I lie Daily C.aland other student publications.
The action was precipitated bv a Daily Cal endorsement of a
candidate who thought that the legislative body should discuss
o'campus issues as well as on-campus ones. The Ex Com felt lhat
the Daily Cal had no right to make such an endorsement.
After an attempt at reconciliation which failed, the Daily Cali
fornian staff quit and formed its own newspaper called llie Inde
pendent Californian. The Ex Com engendered the assistance of
many students and are now publishing the Daily Californian.
The Independent Californian was offered help from the Uni
versity of San Francisco Foghorn, which said that the Independent
could print and publish its newspaper with USF facilities. The
Dean of Students at USF, however, said that the Foghorn had no
right to meddle in the affairs of another school and will not allow
the Foghorn offer to go through. Richard Harcourt, editor-in-chief
of the Foghorn, has temporarily left his post to help the UC paper.
The Stanford Daily was faced by a similar crisis in the spring
of 1957. The result was identical; editor and staff resigned. The
Legislature moved in to produce the last paper (the crisis occurred
just before Easter vacation) and when everyone returned the stu
dents were given the final say via a referendum. The students
backed the Daily and Legislature has kept its hands off since.
But quite obviously our Legislature is much more mature than
California's Ex Com. The Ex Com claims that its decision has
nothing to do with freedom of the press. Balderdash! It has every
thing to do with freedom of the press. A newspaper in this country,
be it professional or student, is FREE to discuss any issue it con
siders important, is FREE to endorse any candidate it considers
qualified for the job, is FREE lo form its own editorial policy and
to choose its own editor.
The Ex Com apparently fails to realize that a newspaper staff
is its own best judge. A newspaper staff works together and is
therefore able to judge who among them is qualified for ihe posi
tion of editor. How can students w ho know nothing of journalism,
who do not know the personnel, choose a qualified editor?
are greatly disturbed by this infringement on the right of
people to think and criticize for themselves. Many Daily Califor
nian alumni are also disturbed. One hundred and fifty of them
went on record as "deploring" the 4> ill considered action *of James
W. Archer, president of the liC Alumni Association, who support
ed the Executive Committee action.
Apparently the Independent Californian members do not have
a place to publish their paper at the present time. The Stanford
Daily will gladly assist the Independent C alifornian in any way it
can.

the issue reached some kind of impasse. \\ e feel that tlie impasse
has now been reached.
In summary, the Daily Californian quit en masae Monday to
protest action initiated by the powerful executive committee of
the Associated Students Sunday. The Ex (loin passed a by-law
which states that it has the authority lo appoint all start" members
of I lie Daily C.aland other student publications.
The action was precipitated bv a Daily Cal endorsement of a
candidate who thought that the legislative body should discuss
o'campus issues as well as on-campus ones. The Ex Com felt lhat
the Daily Cal had no right to make such an endorsement.
After an attempt at reconciliation which failed, the Daily Cali
fornian staff quit and formed its own newspaper called llie Inde
pendent Californian. The Ex Com engendered the assistance of
many students and are now publishing the Daily Californian.
The Independent Californian was offered help from the Uni
versity of San Francisco Foghorn, which said that the Independent
could print and publish its newspaper with USF facilities. The
Dean of Students at USF, however, said that the Foghorn had no
right to meddle in the affairs of another school and will not allow
the Foghorn offer to go through. Richard Harcourt, editor-in-chief
of the Foghorn, has temporarily left his post to help the UC paper.
The Stanford Daily was faced by a similar crisis in the spring
of 1957. The result was identical; editor and staff resigned. The
Legislature moved in to produce the last paper (the crisis occurred
just before Easter vacation) and when everyone returned the stu
dents were given the final say via a referendum. The students
backed the Daily and Legislature has kept its hands off since.
But quite obviously our Legislature is much more mature than
California's Ex Com. The Ex Com claims that its decision has
nothing to do with freedom of the press. Balderdash! It has every
thing to do with freedom of the press. A newspaper in this country,
be it professional or student, is FREE to discuss any issue it con
siders important, is FREE to endorse any candidate it considers
qualified for the job, is FREE lo form its own editorial policy and
to choose its own editor.
The Ex Com apparently fails to realize that a newspaper staff
is its own best judge. A newspaper staff works together and is
therefore able to judge who among them is qualified for ihe posi
tion of editor. How can students w ho know nothing of journalism,
who do not know the personnel, choose a qualified editor?
