Editor, the Daily:
In reply to Mr. Buehler's letter
in the Daily on October 25, we
would like to ask one question.
Has Mr. Buehler ever been to the
Harvard-Yale football game which
he portrays as "lacking the color
of big crowds and big football?"
Very little of the excitement and
tension has been lost by the de
emphasis of football at these col
leges.
In fact the general spirit and
enthusiasm at all Ivy League de
emphasized games approaches
that of the Big Game. When a
water fight in the stands is more
interesting than the kickoff of the
San Jose game, it is hard to say
that de-emphasis will kill what
does not exist.
We are not advocating de-em
phasis of football, but would like
to point out the Princeton-Dart
mouth, Harvard-Yale, and many
other "small" games in the last
few years have been mighty hair
raising, and whether they were
or were not, were appreciated by
the rooters.

Editor, the Daily:
In your editorial of the 24th.
you pointed out the importance
of Americans, and students in par
ticular, coming to a clearer un
derstanding of communism.
I am not quite certain as to the
feasibility of a compulsory course
in the subject. However, I am be
hind you 100 per cent in recog
nizing the need of thoughtful in
quiry by students into the nature
of communism in all its aspects.

T believe that we would no longer
dismiss as mere "propaganda"
the timely warnings of those who
try to alert us to the dangers of
the Communist conspiracy, if we
had studied and gained a belter
insight into the philosophy and
aims of communism.
There must have been other en
thusiastic responses to your edi
torialâ€” (?). What would you think
of the idea that some of those
who did respond favorably to
your editorial get together and
discuss ways and means of arous
ing student interest in learning
(be it through courses, seminars,
lectures, films, etc.) more about
communism? You can count on
me as one of those eager to do
something constructive along
these lines.

Editor, the Daily:
I read your editorial as of the
above date (Monday, Oct. 24) and
found it of interest. I hope those
responsible for policy read it and
that it has consideration.
Your view that we have too lit
tle understanding of communism
is shared. Also, I feel more should
be taught so that many more can
have a real appreciation for the
philosophy so bluntly stated and
both bluntly and adroitly used.
There are many of us, long past
our student days, who have too
little knowledge of this subject.
The same can be said of our
knowledge of socialism, capital
ism, philosophies and religions
which have helped to shape the
world. Therefore, I would like to
offer the suggestion that it (com
munism) will be understood bet
ter if taught in a comparative con
text of philosophy and religion.
