# K. Behavior Explained By Conflicting Pressures
## 
### BILL JUNE IIR Political Analyst 
The highly erratic behavior of
the Soviet premier in recent
months is explained in terms of
conflicting pressures originating
from within the Red world. The
well advertised Sino-Soviet split
indicates clearly that internal dif
ferences do exist.
There seem to be two or three
main streams of thought within
the Communist bloc. Red China is
on the militant left wing of com
munism. believing among other
things that, war is inevitable. Chi
nese dogmatism has been well re
ceived in satellite Europe with
the notable exception of Poland.
Poland, inside the Iron Curtain,
: joins Tito on the "revisionist"
Right fringe of communism. Tin*
right wingers also have the sup
port of Communist leaders in non
| Communist E u r ope . Togliatti,
who in Italy leads Western Eu
rope's largest Communist Party,
is a right leaning Communist.
These right wing Communists
would like expanded relations
with the West and find "peaceful
co-existence" more appealing than
either hot or cold war.
It isn't exactly clear where the
! Russians fit. Some analysts picture
j them as first appeasing the right
and then the left with no clearly
articulated •stand of their own.
I But most feel that Khrushchev,
understanding the implications of
modern war, leans toward Ihe
right. Regardless of K.'s own po
sition, the frequent oscillations of
Russian policy suggest that there
are forces at work big enough to
move the world's number one
Red. The conflicting pressure on
K. may come as much from his
own Russian Communist Party
as from other Bloc governments.
This may explain why some ob
servers fail to distinguish a posi
tion unique to Russian Commu
nism.
The Russian leadership, hut
perhaps not all of the Russian
Communist Party, have come to
modify the Leninist view that an

Imperialist war is fatalistically in
evitable. The Imperialist War is
supposed to be an intramural
scrap among' the dying' Imperial
ist powers. Russian experience in
the last big "Imperialist War,"
known by some as World War 11,
suggest that even Communists
states will become involved in the
next major war.
The Russian leaders can ap
preciate the absurdity of nuclear
war and they understand the
problems of keeping any major
armed conflict non-nuclear. As
everybody else, they si ill preserve
war as Ihe ultimate recourse but
view it as too dangerous for a
standard instrument of foreign
policy.
The modifications concerning
war by no means indicate a com
plete overhaul of Marxism- Lenin
ism. Russian Communists still
view capitalist powers as interim
authorities with no moral right 1o
exist. A moral act is one that aids
the natural and inevitable evolu
tion toward pure communism.
Capitalist states, by existing, im
pede this natural process. This at
titude toward capitalist govern
ments makes it ideologically dif
ficult for any Communist leader
to morally justify compromises
with his Western adversaries.
Any concession made to capital
ists merely helps them to shore
up their crumbling economic edi
fice. Voluntary compromise
smells of betrayal.
In the non-Communist tradition,
international relations short of
war are carried on by negotia
tion. To Westerners, negotiation
means effort to reach agreement
advantageous to both parties. Par
ticipants in negotiation make con
cessions; each gaining in return
But the traditional Communist
attitude toward capitalist states
means that Khrushchev enters
negotiations with the West intent
on gaining objectives but fully un
prepared to yield on any points
in return.
Generally, a nation is able to
make a success of such one-sided

negotiations only with gun in
hand. But K. has indicated an in
terest in "peaceful co-existence."
War is an unthinkable substitute
for negotiations and hollow threat
of war only stiffens the Western
position at the confercnce table.
Khrushchev is at an impasse. In
order to satisfy his own party and
others in the Red Bloc he must
approach the West with unyield
ing belligerency.
This hard-nosed approach can
bring results only if he shows a
willingness to enforce his de
mand with his military. But he
can't do that; war is too dan
gerous.
K. has reacted to the dilemma
with marked ambivalence. He
rattles rockets in defense of the
Cuban cause while assuring the
West that he is really the prince
of peaceful co-existence.
Iv. peddles peace in hopes of
getting our cooperation on Berlin,
lie would like us to dissolve
NATO and be wants disarmament
without controls; all of this with
out offering any concessions in
return. The conflicting forces on
K. demand of him the fruits of
war without war. The result is an
unstable and erratic foreign
policy.

supposed to be an intramural

states will become involved in the

preciate the absurdity of nuclear
war and they understand the
problems of keeping any major
armed conflict non-nuclear. As
everybody else, they si ill preserve
war as Ihe ultimate recourse but
view it as too dangerous for a
standard instrument of foreign
policy.
The modifications concerning
war by no means indicate a com
plete overhaul of Marxism- Lenin
ism. Russian Communists still
view capitalist powers as interim
authorities with no moral right 1o
exist. A moral act is one that aids
the natural and inevitable evolu
tion toward pure communism.
Capitalist states, by existing, im

to morally justify compromises
with his Western adversaries.

smells of betrayal.
In the non-Communist tradition,

war by no means indicate a com

view capitalist powers as interim

Capitalist states, by existing, im

attitude toward capitalist states
means that Khrushchev enters
negotiations with the West intent

prepared to yield on any points
in return.
Generally, a nation is able to
make a success of such one-sided

negotiations only with gun in

War is an unthinkable substitute
for negotiations and hollow threat
of war only stiffens the Western
position at the confercnce table.
Khrushchev is at an impasse. In
order to satisfy his own party and
others in the Red Bloc he must
approach the West with unyield
ing belligerency.
This hard-nosed approach can
bring results only if he shows a
willingness to enforce his de
mand with his military. But he
can't do that; war is too dan
gerous.
K. has reacted to the dilemma
with marked ambivalence. He
rattles rockets in defense of the
Cuban cause while assuring the
West that he is really the prince
of peaceful co-existence.
Iv. peddles peace in hopes of
getting our cooperation on Berlin,
lie would like us to dissolve
NATO and be wants disarmament

out offering any concessions in

K. demand of him the fruits of
war without war. The result is an
unstable and erratic foreign
policy.
The highly erratic behavior of
the Soviet premier in recent

There seem to be two or three
main streams of thought within
