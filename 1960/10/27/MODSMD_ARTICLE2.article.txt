# Government Eases Credit

### 
WASHINGTON (UPI i — The
Federal Reserve Board took
credit-easing actions yesterday to
assure a plentiful supply of
money for consumers and busi
nessmen in the pre-Christmas
shopping season.
The board announced two tech
nical moves liberalizing rules gov
erning bank reserves. They will
go into effect Nov. 24 and Dec. 1.
THE BOARD estimated its ac
tion would enable the banks to
make up to $2.1 billion in new
loans as well as provide the extra
amounts of cash demanded by
merchants and shoppers during
the holiday season.
A board spokesman was asked
if the action was an anti-recession
move. He said only that it was in
tended "to assure ample credit
for needs of this period."
The timing of the board's action
was something of a surprise. The
treasure is expected to announce
today terms of a $10.8 billion re
financing of maturing debt.
Usually, the Federal Reserve tries
to avoid major credit actions close
to announcement of treasure bor
rowing operations.
THE EFFECT of the Federal
Reserve move, if any. most likely
would be to make it easier for
the treasury to sell its new secur
ities.
A spokesman said the board
will take further action if the
steps announced today appear
later to be insufficient to meet the
seasonal demand for cash. Pre
sumably, it would do so through
other technical means at its dis
posal and without public an
nouncement.
The board estimated that of the
$1.3 billion of additional reserves
it made available, about $1 billion
will be taken out of the banking
system by the heavy demand for
cash. That would leave $300 mil
lion for making new loans.
Because of the fractional re
serve requirement, the banking
system as a whole could use these
additional funds to make up to
about $2.1 billion of new loans.

lion for making new loans.
Because of the fractional re
serve requirement, the banking
system as a whole could use these
additional funds to make up to
about $2.1 billion of new loans.
WASHINGTON (UPI i — The
Federal Reserve Board took
credit-easing actions yesterday to
assure a plentiful supply of
money for consumers and busi
nessmen in the pre-Christmas
shopping season.
The board announced two tech
nical moves liberalizing rules gov
erning bank reserves. They will
go into effect Nov. 24 and Dec. 1.
THE BOARD estimated its ac
tion would enable the banks to
make up to $2.1 billion in new
loans as well as provide the extra
amounts of cash demanded by
merchants and shoppers during
the holiday season.
A board spokesman was asked
if the action was an anti-recession
move. He said only that it was in
tended "to assure ample credit
for needs of this period."
The timing of the board's action
was something of a surprise. The
treasure is expected to announce
today terms of a $10.8 billion re
financing of maturing debt.
Usually, the Federal Reserve tries
to avoid major credit actions close
to announcement of treasure bor
rowing operations.
THE EFFECT of the Federal
Reserve move, if any. most likely
would be to make it easier for
the treasury to sell its new secur
ities.
A spokesman said the board
will take further action if the
steps announced today appear
later to be insufficient to meet the
seasonal demand for cash. Pre
sumably, it would do so through
other technical means at its dis
posal and without public an
nouncement.
The board estimated that of the
$1.3 billion of additional reserves
it made available, about $1 billion
will be taken out of the banking
system by the heavy demand for
cash. That would leave $300 mil
lion for making new loans.
Because of the fractional re
serve requirement, the banking
system as a whole could use these
additional funds to make up to
about $2.1 billion of new loans.
