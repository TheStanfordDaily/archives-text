<.i;oK<;i; liOitKl. tells a story indicating how his marriage is
a perfect partnership.
"My wife," Lonesome George says, "makes all the little decisions,
like should I quit mj job? Or what college should our children go
to? And 1 make all the big decisions, like should we declare war on
Russia? or should we raise taxes""
For three weeks Daily Editor Barry Greenberg has been making
big decisions. Should we vote for John Kennedy? Should the House
Un-American Activities Committee be abolished? Should Richard
Nixon be assassinated?
BUT ON OCT. 17, Greenberg made a little decision, and then it

nil me lan. rsui i<> oeyiri ai me
beginning.
As editor of the Daily, Green
berg, a football red-hot, is alloted
a press box ticket to all Stanford
home football games. Three times
he went to the games and three
times he saw Stanford get wiped
So, with the Indians' record
standing at 0-5, Greenberg took
10 the refuge of his typewriter.
He decided that maybe, since
Stanford couldn't seem to win for
losing during the last few years,
we ought to CONSIDER the POS
SIBILITY of playing a lesser
brand of opponent.
For a day the reaction on cam
pus was approximately nil. The
editorial received a grand total
of two letters, one of which com
plained about people who threw
eggs at newly-cleaned band uni-

lorms. But fow people <>n campus really eared .. . for a while.
Just a Suggestion, Fellows'
A PREMONITION of whal was In come appeared early the next
afternoon, however, when Green berg received a call from a sports
writer at the Chronicle, an ex-Stanford Daily editor no less,
Barry explained the editorial and the lack of student reaction as
best as possible and thought nothing more about it. Until a call
came from the Examiner, and then the News-Call Bullelin, and then
the Palo Alio Times.
To all of these lie told the same story. "No, we only SUGGESTED
the POSSIBILITY of de-emphasis. No, there has been little campus
reaction."
TIIE NEXT DAY Barry Greenberg and many others spilled their
vougurt upon reading, "INJUNS TOLD: DE-EMPHASIZE," in big
black headlines in one city paper and much the same thing in the
others.
Making the matter just that much more exciting to big city
papers that ought to have known better was that some nut
had hung Jack Curtice in effigy after the Srin Jose game and that
added more fuel to t he* fire.
Then began the campus reaction. Seemingly, people who weren't
particularly incensed about the editorial the day that il had appeared
got very upset upon contemplating that it was now being sent all
over the country via the wire services.
PEOPLE WERE understandably upset about having outsiders
think that Hie editorial and the hanging were indicative of general
campus opinion, which they were not.
From Little Old Ladies
The letters started coming they haven't stopped yet from stu
dents. alumni, parents and little old ladies in Palo Alto. All kinds of
side is-ues were brought up. A lady representing a church group
said that the BAC was going to lose that group's patronage I about
$80,000 the way she made il look) because a couple of guys in the
men's rooting section made some nasty signs with their digital ex
tremities. (She's obviously never seen the Cal rooting section.)
The football team saw various shades of red and swore they'd
really put out against UCLA last weekend. Bill Kilmer and company
had other ideas.
PERHAPS ONE POINT ought to be cleared up. Somebody, an
important somebody, got the story right. The story that went around
the country was a fair one. thanks to the Associated Press.
Campus reaction was not made out to he at a fever pitch. Nobody
oulside the Bay Area was made to think that screaming mobs of
students were calling for Jack Curtice's neck. It was a reasonable,
truthful story and did Stanford no harm. It told people that Stan
ford's football team had lost five games in a row and that the Stan
ford student newspaper was concerned in a mature and responsible
manner.
It looks like the thing is dying down now, but it's a slow death.

Campus reaction was not made out to he at a fever pitch. Nobody
oulside the Bay Area was made to think that screaming mobs of
students were calling for Jack Curtice's neck. It was a reasonable,
truthful story and did Stanford no harm. It told people that Stan
ford's football team had lost five games in a row and that the Stan
ford student newspaper was concerned in a mature and responsible
manner.

BARRY GREENBERG
A Little Decision

"My wife," Lonesome George says, "makes all the little decisions,
like should I quit mj job? Or what college should our children go
to? And 1 make all the big decisions, like should we declare war on
Russia? or should we raise taxes""
For three weeks Daily Editor Barry Greenberg has been making
big decisions. Should we vote for John Kennedy? Should the House
Un-American Activities Committee be abolished? Should Richard
Nixon be assassinated?
BUT ON OCT. 17, Greenberg made a little decision, and then it

As editor of the Daily, Green
berg, a football red-hot, is alloted
a press box ticket to all Stanford
home football games. Three times
he went to the games and three
times he saw Stanford get wiped
So, with the Indians' record
standing at 0-5, Greenberg took
10 the refuge of his typewriter.
He decided that maybe, since
Stanford couldn't seem to win for
losing during the last few years,
we ought to CONSIDER the POS
SIBILITY of playing a lesser
brand of opponent.
For a day the reaction on cam

editorial received a grand total
of two letters, one of which com
plained about people who threw
eggs at newly-cleaned band uni-

Just a Suggestion, Fellows'
A PREMONITION of whal was In come appeared early the next
afternoon, however, when Green berg received a call from a sports
writer at the Chronicle, an ex-Stanford Daily editor no less,
Barry explained the editorial and the lack of student reaction as
best as possible and thought nothing more about it. Until a call
came from the Examiner, and then the News-Call Bullelin, and then
the Palo Alio Times.
To all of these lie told the same story. "No, we only SUGGESTED
the POSSIBILITY of de-emphasis. No, there has been little campus
reaction."
TIIE NEXT DAY Barry Greenberg and many others spilled their
vougurt upon reading, "INJUNS TOLD: DE-EMPHASIZE," in big
black headlines in one city paper and much the same thing in the
others.
Making the matter just that much more exciting to big city

writer at the Chronicle, an ex-Stanford Daily editor no less,
Barry explained the editorial and the lack of student reaction as
best as possible and thought nothing more about it. Until a call
came from the Examiner, and then the News-Call Bullelin, and then
the Palo Alio Times.
To all of these lie told the same story. "No, we only SUGGESTED
the POSSIBILITY of de-emphasis. No, there has been little campus
reaction."

vougurt upon reading, "INJUNS TOLD: DE-EMPHASIZE," in big
black headlines in one city paper and much the same thing in the
others.
Making the matter just that much more exciting to big city
papers that ought to have known better was that some nut
had hung Jack Curtice in effigy after the Srin Jose game and that
added more fuel to t he* fire.
Then began the campus reaction. Seemingly, people who weren't
particularly incensed about the editorial the day that il had appeared
got very upset upon contemplating that it was now being sent all
over the country via the wire services.
PEOPLE WERE understandably upset about having outsiders
think that Hie editorial and the hanging were indicative of general
campus opinion, which they were not.
From Little Old Ladies
The letters started coming they haven't stopped yet from stu
dents. alumni, parents and little old ladies in Palo Alto. All kinds of
side is-ues were brought up. A lady representing a church group
said that the BAC was going to lose that group's patronage I about
$80,000 the way she made il look) because a couple of guys in the
men's rooting section made some nasty signs with their digital ex
tremities. (She's obviously never seen the Cal rooting section.)
The football team saw various shades of red and swore they'd
really put out against UCLA last weekend. Bill Kilmer and company
had other ideas.
PERHAPS ONE POINT ought to be cleared up. Somebody, an
important somebody, got the story right. The story that went around
the country was a fair one. thanks to the Associated Press.
Campus reaction was not made out to he at a fever pitch. Nobody
oulside the Bay Area was made to think that screaming mobs of
students were calling for Jack Curtice's neck. It was a reasonable,
truthful story and did Stanford no harm. It told people that Stan
ford's football team had lost five games in a row and that the Stan
ford student newspaper was concerned in a mature and responsible
manner.
It looks like the thing is dying down now, but it's a slow death.
