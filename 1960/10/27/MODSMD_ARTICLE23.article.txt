# Cards to Test ‘Slow’ Trojans
## 
### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
une ot the most important
phases of Stanford football has
brightened considerably during
the last week. The improvement
has occurred in the matter of
team speed, a quality that the
Indians have lacked all year. It
isn't that Coach Jack Curtice has
found a magic formula to speed
up the Cards, it's just that the
next opponents on the schedule,
the SC Trojans, aren't too last
I hemselves.
WITH tlie team speed problem
at least eased, the Indians can
concentrate on whipping their
passing attack into winning form
for the homecoming game.
Plagued by slippery fingered re
ceivers all season, Dick Norman
began to pick up some lost ground
when he completed 14 throws out
of 27 in Saturday's UCLA fray.
Skip Face and Gil Dowd have
combined to provide the Cards
with a reliable two-way punch on
the ground. Face is the second
best ground gainer in the league
with 2KO yards and an average
of ."S.X yards per carry. Dowd, a
senior back, has been the work
horse for the farm with a total
of 63 carries and a 3.6 average.
Against the fairly slow Trojan
linebackers Face and Dowd. along
with Wylie, might get the rare
chance to run to the outside and
break away for long gains. If
they do, Norman will have an
even better chance of throwing
some touchdown nasses.

HON I i: k N A N I) E s, right
guard, and Gary Craig, left half
back were both injured in the
UCLA fray but both have almost
recovered and should be ready by
Saturday. Craig has been handling

(ho kicking chores for Stanford
and has averaged 39 yards per
hoot. One of his host efforts was
last week when he punted dead
to tho UCLA one-inch line, only ;
to have a penalty rtulify the play.

of 27 in Saturday's UCLA fray.
Skip Face and Gil Dowd have
combined to provide the Cards
with a reliable two-way punch on
the ground. Face is the second
best ground gainer in the league
with 2KO yards and an average
of ."S.X yards per carry. Dowd, a
senior back, has been the work
horse for the farm with a total
of 63 carries and a 3.6 average.
Against the fairly slow Trojan
linebackers Face and Dowd. along
with Wylie, might get the rare
chance to run to the outside and
break away for long gains. If
they do, Norman will have an
even better chance of throwing
some touchdown nasses.

guard, and Gary Craig, left half
back were both injured in the
UCLA fray but both have almost
recovered and should be ready by
Saturday. Craig has been handling

and has averaged 39 yards per
hoot. One of his host efforts was
last week when he punted dead
to tho UCLA one-inch line, only ;
to have a penalty rtulify the play.

une ot the most important
phases of Stanford football has
brightened considerably during
the last week. The improvement
has occurred in the matter of
team speed, a quality that the
Indians have lacked all year. It
isn't that Coach Jack Curtice has
found a magic formula to speed
up the Cards, it's just that the
next opponents on the schedule,
the SC Trojans, aren't too last
I hemselves.
WITH tlie team speed problem
at least eased, the Indians can
concentrate on whipping their
passing attack into winning form
for the homecoming game.
Plagued by slippery fingered re
ceivers all season, Dick Norman
