DECATUR, Ga. (UPH — The
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,
whose name has become synony
mous with the Negro light for
equality, was hustled off to prison
yesterday to begin serving a four
month term for a traffic violation.
His quick transfer at 4 a.m. to
Reidsville State Prison. 211 miles

I southeast of Atlanta, caught his
attorneys by surprise.
THEY DID not know he had
l been taken from the Dekalb
[County Jail in this Atlanta sub
urb until shortly before they went
into court this morning to ask
that the sentence bo vacated. This
bid was turned down this after
noon and hearing on a request
that the integration leader be re
leased on bond pending an appeal
was put off until 9 a.m. tomor
row.
His attorneys said if King was
denied bond they would go di
rectly to Reidsville and seek a
habeas corpus in local courts
there.

known for his leadership in the
successful Montgomery. Ala., bus
boycott, was arrested in Dekalb
