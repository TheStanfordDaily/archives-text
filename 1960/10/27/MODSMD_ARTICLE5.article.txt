LONDON (UPH —Gold specu
lators betting against the dollar
suffered a case of frayed nerves
I yesterday when the official Lon
| don free market price of gold
dipped $1.25 an ounce from Tues
day's $38 level.
The sharp drop to $36.75 mark
, ed the first major slide in the of
t ficial free market value of the
■ metal since the big gold scramble
; began.
THE NEW PRICE, fixed by the
London gold market's five-man
committee still was $1.75 more
than the U.S. pegged gold price
of $35 an ounce.
The market suddenly turned
quiet with dealers quoting $36.50
for sellers and $37.25 an ounce
for buyers, compared with the
$40.60 price paid by speculators
at last Thursday's peak.
Further gold selling from Eu
rope pushed the unofficial price
even lower tonight with mer
chants quoting $36 for sellers and
$36.50 for buyers at the market
close.
MARKET SOURCES said that
> some speculators who had jump
■ed on the bandwagon earlier at
the higher gold levels appeared
to be perplexed and undecided
which may to move through the
quick price downslip.
The steep fall in the gold price
here apparently reflected U.S. re
affirmation of its stand it will not
change the long-fixed American
price level for gold. It also re
flected the cashing-in Tuesday by
some speculators, especially from
Switzerland, to grab quick prof
! its.
The soaring of the free market
price of gold had been watched in
J the Free World with considerable
anxiety. Chief fear was that
j while trading in gold persisted at
I artificially high rates it would
undermine confidence in the dol
