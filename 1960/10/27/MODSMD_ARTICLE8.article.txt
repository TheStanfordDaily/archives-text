# U.S. Will Fight If Guantanamo Threatened
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) A high
administration official reaffirmed
yesterday that the United States
will fight if Cuba tries to seize the
huge Guantanamo naval base.
The administration has main
tained it will not give up the $70
million Caribbean outpost ever
since Cuban Premier Fidel Cas
tra first threatened to renounce
the 1903 treaty which gives the
United States control over Guan
tanamo.
ADM. ARLKIGH BURKK, chief
of naval operations, told a House
committee evaluating the base's
importance last January that "the
Navy has no intention of pulling
out of Guantanamo."
He strengthened this position
exactly a month ago, saying the
United States would fight back
"very fast" if Castro tried to
seize the base.
The State Department less than
three weeks ago also confirmed
the policy. In a letter to Rep.
Daniel Flood, D.-Pa., it said it
has "no intention" of abandoning
the base.
TIIK U.S. originally acquired
the 45-square mile Guantanamo
area on Cuban soil through a 1903
lease agreement. The agreement,
under which Cuba granted the
U.S. "complete jurisdiction and
control" over the area, was super
seded by a "treaty of relations"
in 1934.
The 193-1 treaty reaffirmed the
provisions of the old agreement.
The 45 square miles of Ameri
can sovereignty is in the eastern
Cuban province of Oriente, on the
Caribbean coast.
