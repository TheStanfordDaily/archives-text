# Radford Says Nixon Better For Country

### SONYA MICHEL 
Admiral Arthur W. Radford
said, in a press conference in En
cina yesterday afternoon, thai
"this country is going to he much
better off if Mr. Nixon is presi
dent."
He made this remark after cit
ing some of what he called un
wise assertions made recently by
Senator Kennedy. He said Ken
nedy was foolish to criticize the
Administration for not releasing
U.S. Intelligence Agency reports
on U.S. prestige abroad, as he will
probably do the same thing if he
is president.
Radford also explained his
stand on Quemoy and Matsu. He
said both islands cover important
approaches to harbors strategic
in t lie defense of Formosa.
Radford also clarified the U.S.
position. While the Formosan
government was not obligated to
abide by U.S. advice on defense,
he thought that Chiang Kai-Shek
would certainly warn the U.S.
well in advance of any plan con
cerning an attack on the main
land.
"Today the islands are in an
extremely strong military posi
tion. Almost 100 per cent of the
defenders are underground. The
islands would be extremely diffi
cult to take." he added.
