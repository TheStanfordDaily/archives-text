# Legislature Neutral in Cal Battle
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Stanford's "Associated SI u
dents" went on record last night
by a 15-6 vote of LASSU as
wishing "to remain neutral" in
the battle between the former
staff of the Daily Californian and
the Cal students' executive com
mittee.
The resolution passed also
"noted" the Stanford ASSU by
laws which forbid "any support
. . . to either of the disputants
which would involve the expendi
ture of ASSU funds or the em
ployment of ASSU capital equip
ment."
The measure, however, also
pointed out that "LASSU realizes
that the editor of the Stanford
Daily enjoys the prerogative of
extending editorial support to
either of the involved factions."
THE MATTER came up when
two or three members of LASSU
put a harsher resolution on the
agenda which would have re
quested Daily Editor Barry Green
berg to clarify his offer of assist
ance to the staff of the Independ
ent Californian, the "rebel" paper
now being put out by former
members of the Daily Cal.
But the resolution finally
passed did no more than note
"the Associated Students wish
to remain neutral" in the fight,
"realize" Greenberg's right to ed
itorially support whichever side
he wishes and insure ASSU facil
ities would not be used to aid the
Independent Californian.
Off Campus representative Tom
Reilly said all he wanted to do
was "assure the Daily does not
offer the resources of the Daily
Shack" to the Independent, and
he wanted in no way to tread on
editorial fredom.
