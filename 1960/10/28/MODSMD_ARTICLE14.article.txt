Normally the Daily does not comment on letters it receives
from people who disagree with an editorial. However, due to
the complete lack of understanding on the part of two students
in regard to the editorial on Mr. Dewey, we feel compelled 1o
comment once again. (Sec Steam and Esteem for letters.)
First of all, we are well aware of what probably would have
happened if U.S. troops marched into Hungary to help the rebels.
That is not the point. The Administration was also aware of the
consequences of defending the revolulionVit might have led to
World War. lint if I lie Administration was aware of the conse
quences, then why did it tell ihe Hungarians that they could
count on the U.S. for assistance? We don't advocate starting
World War, but neither can we advocate promises we simply
don't intend to keep.
In regard to Cuba, the Administration would not have been
in such an ambivalent situation if they did not support Batista
in the first place. There never would have been a Castro if the
United States acted in accordance with its ideals and threw Batista
out on his ear the way they threw Arbenz out. Another letter
in today's paper points out that seven of the eight dictatorships
that fell were supported by the Eisenhower Administration until
ihe bitter end.
Thirdly, we are quite aware of "who was in power" when ihe
Communists took over many countries. We are not so much con
cerned with what administration was in power as much as what
administration is presently telling the people that America is just
as secure now as it has been in the past, including the last seven
and one-half years.
The truth is that America has never been in a worse position.
Senator Kennedy knows this and intends to do something about
it. Meanwhile, Mr. Nixon seems deliberately to be ignoring the
handwriting 011 the wall. Surely he knows that Communism is
strengthening its world position every day. \\ by, then, does he
tell the people just the opposite?
Lastly, the Editorial Board is not composed of "welfare
staters."' We are simply anxious to see that the American people
realize the titanic struggle which faces them. One candidate is
trying to make this battle quite clear, the other candidate is
ignoring it. If this means we are welfare-staters, then our defi
nitions differ.
