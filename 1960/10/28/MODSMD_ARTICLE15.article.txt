### LARRY ROYSE ASSU President 
Tomorrow afternoon our sta
dium will be the scene of a unique
football game. Unique by the fact
that it brings together two of
America's unluckiest football
teams. More than one pre-season
poll predicted that the University
of Southern California would be
the number one collegiate football
team in the country this year. No
one predicted that Stanford would
lose six in a row.
Nevertheless, the 9.000 Stanford
students are fortunate to have the
opportunity of seeing two fine
football teams perform amid the
pageantry of an excellent march
ing band supported by our beau
tiful. talented pom pon girls. The
USC band and rooting section will
be here in full force, too. Let's
take advantage of this opportun
ity, but let's not spoil it. We have
too much at stake.
What do we have at stake? you
may ask. Let's look at the records.
The University of Southern Cali
fornia is one of the best collegiate
football teams in the country.
They have several regulars back
from last years outstanding team
including the All-American Mc-
Keever brothers. Although upset
victims three times this year, they
still smell roses. We have a much
better football team than our rec
ord indicates.
We are capable of beating the
Trojans but all the factors must
be on our side, including the spirit
of our rooting section. We owe
this much to our team. They are
going to do the best they can. I am
sure we will, too.
The eyes and ears of our fans
and alumni will be focused on our
rooting section many times
throughout the game. We can all
have an enjoyable afternoon if
we get into the spirit of the day.
I would like to think of spirit in
terms of cheers rather than toma
toes, eggs and flying cards. The
louder we cheer the more impres
sive we will appear both to the
team and to the USC rooting sec
tion across the stadium.
During the half-time show our
brilliant and intricate card stunts
will be performed by us for the
enjoyment of our alumni on their
day. It will be shameful and dis
graceful if we mar the occasion
by showering cards over the sta
dium. If we cannot refrain from
throwing cards tomorrow we may
not have enough cards for our

traditional Big Game show. We in
vented card stunts in 1926. Thank
God we didn't invent throwing
them, too. Let's live up to our
reputation.
Prince Light foot is scheduled to
speak to the rooting - section 15
minutes before same time (1:15).
The game will be over by 4 p.m.
Let's all stay to see the end of the
game for a change. I think we will
have something to stay and cheer
for. But suppose we are behind
a couple of touchdowns? What
are we as rooters going to do?
We can't play the game so let's
yell a little louder.
Surely remaining in our seats
for the remaining five or ten
minutes of the game is not going
to hurt us as individuals and it
will help strengthen the faith of
our team, our alumni and our fol
lowers across the nation in us, the
student body. The throngs of stu
dents who have consistently left
the game before its conclusion
have done Stanford's reputation
a great deal of harm. We can rec
tify this tomorrow afternoon. We
have too much at stake to do
otherwise.

The University of Southern Cali
fornia is one of the best collegiate
football teams in the country.
They have several regulars back
from last years outstanding team
including the All-American Mc-
Keever brothers. Although upset
victims three times this year, they
still smell roses. We have a much
better football team than our rec
ord indicates.
We are capable of beating the
Trojans but all the factors must
be on our side, including the spirit
of our rooting section. We owe
this much to our team. They are
going to do the best they can. I am
sure we will, too.
The eyes and ears of our fans
and alumni will be focused on our
rooting section many times
throughout the game. We can all
have an enjoyable afternoon if
we get into the spirit of the day.
I would like to think of spirit in
terms of cheers rather than toma
toes, eggs and flying cards. The
louder we cheer the more impres
sive we will appear both to the
team and to the USC rooting sec
tion across the stadium.
During the half-time show our
brilliant and intricate card stunts
will be performed by us for the
enjoyment of our alumni on their
day. It will be shameful and dis
graceful if we mar the occasion
by showering cards over the sta
dium. If we cannot refrain from
throwing cards tomorrow we may
not have enough cards for our

traditional Big Game show. We in
vented card stunts in 1926. Thank
God we didn't invent throwing
them, too. Let's live up to our
reputation.
Prince Light foot is scheduled to
speak to the rooting - section 15
minutes before same time (1:15).
The game will be over by 4 p.m.
Let's all stay to see the end of the
game for a change. I think we will
have something to stay and cheer
for. But suppose we are behind
a couple of touchdowns? What
are we as rooters going to do?
We can't play the game so let's
yell a little louder.
Surely remaining in our seats
for the remaining five or ten
minutes of the game is not going
to hurt us as individuals and it
will help strengthen the faith of
our team, our alumni and our fol
lowers across the nation in us, the
student body. The throngs of stu
dents who have consistently left
the game before its conclusion
have done Stanford's reputation
a great deal of harm. We can rec
tify this tomorrow afternoon. We
have too much at stake to do
otherwise.
Tomorrow afternoon our sta
dium will be the scene of a unique
football game. Unique by the fact
that it brings together two of
America's unluckiest football
teams. More than one pre-season
poll predicted that the University
of Southern California would be
the number one collegiate football
team in the country this year. No
one predicted that Stanford would
lose six in a row.
Nevertheless, the 9.000 Stanford
students are fortunate to have the
opportunity of seeing two fine
football teams perform amid the
pageantry of an excellent march
ing band supported by our beau
tiful. talented pom pon girls. The
USC band and rooting section will
be here in full force, too. Let's
take advantage of this opportun
ity, but let's not spoil it. We have
too much at stake.
What do we have at stake? you
may ask. Let's look at the records.
