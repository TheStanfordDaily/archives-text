Editor, th<» Daily:
Knowing your unswerving pol
icy of anti-Republicanism, one
cannot be too surprised at your
editorial attack on the honorable
Mr. Dewey. Your cries of non
partisanism sound pretty hollow
when one looks at the record.
Wishy-washy Chester Bowles got
the use of nearly the entire edi
torial page for two days; I'm sure
the Democratic Parly is greatful
for the many dollars of free ad
vertising which this afforded
them.
Dewey, who merely stated the
other side of the argument by
pointing out the good record of
the Eisenhower administration,
received nothing but criticism
from the Stanford Daily Demo
crat and the collection of welfare
staters on its editorial board.
The only move you need make
now to complete your "Nonpar
tisan" cycle is 10 start a "Let's
Re-Elect Pat Brown Campaign"
on your odilorial pages. This
could hardly be any more ill
advised than any of your recent
blunders.
