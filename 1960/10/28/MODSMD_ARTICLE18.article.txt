Editor, Hie Daily:
I can't help thinking that your
indictments of Mr. Nixon are just
a little bit excessive at times, as
are your indictments of various
fellow travelers, but I also must
say that they are very far from
being without validity.
One who takes the trouble to
listen to, and watch, Mr. Nixon
with great attention must—unless
one is terribly lacking in knowl
edge and sophistication—be
struck by the fact that ho has
brought a peculiar type of argu
mentative and expositional style
to almost a high art. The basic
elements of this style are, first,
to manage to carry water on both
shoulders while giving the im
pression of clear-eyed fort bright
ness and candor; second, to seem
to attribute the highest of mo
tives and intent to your opponent
while subtlely (at least to those
innocents mentioned above, it is
subtle) suggesting all sorts of
questionable and opportunistic
caprices and humour; third, to
set up for demolition by his own
superior forces of intellect, integ
rity, responsibility and loyalty to
country, a seemingly honest rep
resentation of his opponent's po
sition that too often bears but the
most incidental resemblance to
what that position actually is.
As Mr. Kennedy observed in
their third debate, "I always have
the greatest difficulty in recog
nizing my own position as it is
stated by the vice president." A
nice illustration of this gambil
occurred when Mr. Nixon assured
the TV audience that his posi
tion was exactly opposite that of
Mr. Kennedy's on the matter of
depletion allowances for oil in
that he was for them, leaving it
to the listeners to devine lhat
Mr. Kennedy was unequivocally
against them, all hough ho had
just that moment explained in de
tail his view that all such allow
ances should properly bo sub
jected to scrutiny to determine to
what extent they wore justifiable
and what form, if any, they
should be continued in.
His position on what he and
now some of his more enthusias
tic journalistic supporters (Life
magazine, for instance) call
"growthmanship" is an equally
nice illustration of the first ele
ment mentioned above. At various
times he has excoriated Adlai
Stevenson and the many other
dubious patriotic "sellers of
America short" (Walter Lipp
mann would rank quite high) for
so much as mentioning that the
economic growth rate in this
country has fallen dangerously
behind that of Soviet Russia and
must be accelerated if disaster
does not overtake us in the near
future.
He manages, you see, to insinu
ate the second element here also,
that of implying questionable

loyalties to his opponent while in
•simple hearted fashion assuring
all that he does "not for a minute
suggest that Mr. Stevenson or
Bowles or Kennedy have any but
the highest motives of patriotism
in the matter."
At various times in the last few
years he has sounded somewhat
like a statesman to many of us
by calling for the very things
that he has intermittently damned
the Democratic leaders for de
manding; and now at last he has
j worked out his technique for
being on both sides at once to
such perfection that it has become
almost the central theme of his
campaign. Thus, in almost every
speech or statement now he lays
about him with the greatest heat
belabouring those who "sell
America short" by tearing her
down i you don't have to tear
America down to build her up").
Invariably he closes such
speeches or statements by assur
ing his listeners in that voice of
patronizing unctuousness that in
spite of the immense accomplish
ments of this administration (so
great by implication as to dwarf
J to insignificance all other admin
istrations including Lincoln's) he
is by no means satisfied, he is
never satisfied, thus placing him
self on the record as absolutely
in support of the administration's
record while at the same time
calling for the very same order
of invigorating action and growth
that he anathemetizes the Demo
crats for calling for.
The wonder of it is that the
j transparency of his melhod is not
i obvious to all but is, on the con
! trary, often, very often, taken for
just exactly the high-minded and
patriotic exposition of the Ameri
i can ethic that he represents it to
! be.
You and I both seem to be of
the .same mind that under careful
scrutiny the "New Nixon" is just
i a carefully fumigated version of
llhe "Old Nixon," and basically
{ indistinguishable therefrom,
j There can be small uncertainty,
j though, that Mr. Nixon's "sound-
J ness' appeals tremendously to a
! very great number of Americans
j whether Ihey call themselves
Democrats or Republicans.
The "conventional wisdom" so
i many of us read about in Econ I
all over, you know. All these ap
peals to emotion and to the
cruder, more primitive manifes
tation of patriotism are just what
the doctor ordered for many of

As a former editor of the Daily
I I write these few lines and hope
1 you will find space to print them.
| The present football controversy
j brings up several points.
In the first place, does the
Stanford Daily voice the opinion

of tho Stanford student body?
The general impression is that it
does not. That it has not been
representative of the Stanford
student body since the editors of
the Daily became appointive and
ceased to be elected by the stu
dent body.
This is borne out by the contro
versy of a couple of years ago
between ihe Daily staff and the
student body when the staff
threatened to strike or did strike
under suggestion that the Daily
Editor become an elected officer
as formerly. Incidentally, many
hold the view that the Daily in
recent years has leaned strongly
to Ihe left and has injured Stan
ford.
Now the Daily puts forth ideas
on the football question as the
views of Stanford. Since when
has Stanford or Stanford students
become defeatists or quitters? If
there is a wavering of Stanford
spirit, is not the Daily and its
clique repsonsible?
Permit me to suggest that an
attitude such as you have shown
does not present a l-emedy and
misrepresents the student body
and t he University. It also misrep
resents the public and the alumni.
There was no criticism under
Mr. Taylor. All had confidence in
him. The student body, the public
and the alumni seemingly have
lost confidence in Mr. Curtice.
They want Stanford and Ihe pres
ent outstanding crop of Freshmen
to have the most competent in
struction possible under a coach
comparable to those in Stanford's
past. Delay will only cause more
trouble.
The present crop of Freshmen
football men, reported best in
years, is sufficient answer to the
claim that scholastic conditions
do not. permit good athletes 1o
enter Stanford. While we are con
templating changes let's have
promptly the very best instruc
tion in the country, a Board of
Athletic Control that is really ac
tive and progressive, a new sys
tem of electing an Editor of the
Daily to represent the student
body, and above all, the rebuilding
of the Stanford spirit that does
not know defeatism.

Editor, the Daily:
As a former editor of the Daily
I I write these few lines and hope
1 you will find space to print them.
| The present football controversy
j brings up several points.
In the first place, does the
Stanford Daily voice the opinion

of tho Stanford student body?
The general impression is that it
does not. That it has not been
representative of the Stanford
student body since the editors of
the Daily became appointive and
ceased to be elected by the stu
dent body.
This is borne out by the contro
versy of a couple of years ago
between ihe Daily staff and the
student body when the staff
threatened to strike or did strike
under suggestion that the Daily
Editor become an elected officer
as formerly. Incidentally, many
hold the view that the Daily in
recent years has leaned strongly
to Ihe left and has injured Stan
ford.
Now the Daily puts forth ideas
on the football question as the
views of Stanford. Since when
has Stanford or Stanford students
become defeatists or quitters? If
there is a wavering of Stanford
spirit, is not the Daily and its
clique repsonsible?
Permit me to suggest that an
attitude such as you have shown
does not present a l-emedy and
misrepresents the student body
and t he University. It also misrep
resents the public and the alumni.
There was no criticism under
Mr. Taylor. All had confidence in
him. The student body, the public
and the alumni seemingly have
lost confidence in Mr. Curtice.
They want Stanford and Ihe pres
ent outstanding crop of Freshmen
to have the most competent in
struction possible under a coach
comparable to those in Stanford's
past. Delay will only cause more
trouble.
The present crop of Freshmen
football men, reported best in
years, is sufficient answer to the
claim that scholastic conditions
do not. permit good athletes 1o
enter Stanford. While we are con
templating changes let's have
promptly the very best instruc
tion in the country, a Board of
Athletic Control that is really ac
tive and progressive, a new sys
tem of electing an Editor of the
Daily to represent the student
body, and above all, the rebuilding
of the Stanford spirit that does
not know defeatism.
L. R. VVeininann
Editor, Hie Daily:
I can't help thinking that your
indictments of Mr. Nixon are just
a little bit excessive at times, as
are your indictments of various
fellow travelers, but I also must
say that they are very far from
being without validity.
One who takes the trouble to
listen to, and watch, Mr. Nixon
with great attention must—unless
one is terribly lacking in knowl
edge and sophistication—be
struck by the fact that ho has
brought a peculiar type of argu
mentative and expositional style
to almost a high art. The basic
elements of this style are, first,
to manage to carry water on both
shoulders while giving the im
pression of clear-eyed fort bright
ness and candor; second, to seem
to attribute the highest of mo
tives and intent to your opponent
while subtlely (at least to those
innocents mentioned above, it is
subtle) suggesting all sorts of
questionable and opportunistic
caprices and humour; third, to
set up for demolition by his own
superior forces of intellect, integ
rity, responsibility and loyalty to
country, a seemingly honest rep
resentation of his opponent's po
sition that too often bears but the
most incidental resemblance to
what that position actually is.
As Mr. Kennedy observed in
their third debate, "I always have
the greatest difficulty in recog
nizing my own position as it is
stated by the vice president." A
nice illustration of this gambil
occurred when Mr. Nixon assured
the TV audience that his posi
tion was exactly opposite that of
Mr. Kennedy's on the matter of
depletion allowances for oil in
that he was for them, leaving it
to the listeners to devine lhat
Mr. Kennedy was unequivocally
against them, all hough ho had
just that moment explained in de
tail his view that all such allow
ances should properly bo sub
jected to scrutiny to determine to
what extent they wore justifiable
and what form, if any, they
should be continued in.
His position on what he and
now some of his more enthusias
tic journalistic supporters (Life
magazine, for instance) call
"growthmanship" is an equally
nice illustration of the first ele
ment mentioned above. At various
times he has excoriated Adlai
Stevenson and the many other
dubious patriotic "sellers of
America short" (Walter Lipp

As a former editor of the Daily
I I write these few lines and hope

| The present football controversy
j brings up several points.
In the first place, does the
Stanford Daily voice the opinion

of tho Stanford student body?
The general impression is that it
does not. That it has not been
representative of the Stanford
student body since the editors of
the Daily became appointive and
ceased to be elected by the stu
dent body.
This is borne out by the contro
versy of a couple of years ago
between ihe Daily staff and the
student body when the staff
threatened to strike or did strike
under suggestion that the Daily
Editor become an elected officer
as formerly. Incidentally, many
hold the view that the Daily in
recent years has leaned strongly
to Ihe left and has injured Stan
ford.
Now the Daily puts forth ideas
on the football question as the
views of Stanford. Since when
has Stanford or Stanford students
become defeatists or quitters? If
there is a wavering of Stanford
spirit, is not the Daily and its
clique repsonsible?
Permit me to suggest that an
attitude such as you have shown
does not present a l-emedy and
misrepresents the student body
and t he University. It also misrep
resents the public and the alumni.
There was no criticism under
Mr. Taylor. All had confidence in
him. The student body, the public
and the alumni seemingly have
lost confidence in Mr. Curtice.
They want Stanford and Ihe pres
ent outstanding crop of Freshmen
to have the most competent in
struction possible under a coach
comparable to those in Stanford's
past. Delay will only cause more
trouble.
The present crop of Freshmen
football men, reported best in
years, is sufficient answer to the
claim that scholastic conditions
do not. permit good athletes 1o
enter Stanford. While we are con
templating changes let's have
promptly the very best instruc
tion in the country, a Board of
Athletic Control that is really ac
tive and progressive, a new sys
tem of electing an Editor of the
Daily to represent the student
body, and above all, the rebuilding
of the Stanford spirit that does
not know defeatism.
L. R. VVeininann
Editor, Hie Daily:
I can't help thinking that your
indictments of Mr. Nixon are just
a little bit excessive at times, as
are your indictments of various
fellow travelers, but I also must
say that they are very far from
being without validity.
One who takes the trouble to
listen to, and watch, Mr. Nixon
with great attention must—unless
one is terribly lacking in knowl
edge and sophistication—be
struck by the fact that ho has
brought a peculiar type of argu
mentative and expositional style
to almost a high art. The basic
elements of this style are, first,
to manage to carry water on both
shoulders while giving the im
pression of clear-eyed fort bright
ness and candor; second, to seem
to attribute the highest of mo
tives and intent to your opponent
while subtlely (at least to those
innocents mentioned above, it is
subtle) suggesting all sorts of
questionable and opportunistic
caprices and humour; third, to
set up for demolition by his own
superior forces of intellect, integ
rity, responsibility and loyalty to
country, a seemingly honest rep
resentation of his opponent's po
sition that too often bears but the
most incidental resemblance to
what that position actually is.
As Mr. Kennedy observed in
their third debate, "I always have
the greatest difficulty in recog
nizing my own position as it is
stated by the vice president." A
nice illustration of this gambil
occurred when Mr. Nixon assured
the TV audience that his posi
tion was exactly opposite that of
Mr. Kennedy's on the matter of
depletion allowances for oil in
that he was for them, leaving it
to the listeners to devine lhat
Mr. Kennedy was unequivocally
against them, all hough ho had
just that moment explained in de
tail his view that all such allow
ances should properly bo sub
jected to scrutiny to determine to
what extent they wore justifiable
and what form, if any, they
should be continued in.
His position on what he and
now some of his more enthusias
tic journalistic supporters (Life
magazine, for instance) call
"growthmanship" is an equally
nice illustration of the first ele
ment mentioned above. At various
times he has excoriated Adlai
Stevenson and the many other
dubious patriotic "sellers of
America short" (Walter Lipp
mann would rank quite high) for
so much as mentioning that the
economic growth rate in this
country has fallen dangerously
behind that of Soviet Russia and
must be accelerated if disaster
does not overtake us in the near
future.
He manages, you see, to insinu
ate the second element here also,
that of implying questionable

loyalties to his opponent while in
•simple hearted fashion assuring
all that he does "not for a minute
suggest that Mr. Stevenson or
Bowles or Kennedy have any but
the highest motives of patriotism
in the matter."
At various times in the last few
years he has sounded somewhat
like a statesman to many of us
by calling for the very things
that he has intermittently damned
the Democratic leaders for de
manding; and now at last he has
j worked out his technique for
being on both sides at once to
such perfection that it has become
almost the central theme of his
campaign. Thus, in almost every
speech or statement now he lays
about him with the greatest heat
belabouring those who "sell
America short" by tearing her
down i you don't have to tear
America down to build her up").
Invariably he closes such
speeches or statements by assur
ing his listeners in that voice of
patronizing unctuousness that in
spite of the immense accomplish
ments of this administration (so
great by implication as to dwarf
J to insignificance all other admin
istrations including Lincoln's) he
is by no means satisfied, he is
never satisfied, thus placing him
self on the record as absolutely
in support of the administration's
record while at the same time
calling for the very same order
of invigorating action and growth
that he anathemetizes the Demo
crats for calling for.
The wonder of it is that the
j transparency of his melhod is not
i obvious to all but is, on the con
! trary, often, very often, taken for
just exactly the high-minded and
patriotic exposition of the Ameri
i can ethic that he represents it to
! be.
You and I both seem to be of

L. R. VVeininann
Editor, Hie Daily:
I can't help thinking that your
indictments of Mr. Nixon are just
a little bit excessive at times, as
are your indictments of various
fellow travelers, but I also must
say that they are very far from
being without validity.
One who takes the trouble to
listen to, and watch, Mr. Nixon
with great attention must—unless
one is terribly lacking in knowl
edge and sophistication—be
struck by the fact that ho has
brought a peculiar type of argu
mentative and expositional style
to almost a high art. The basic
elements of this style are, first,
to manage to carry water on both
shoulders while giving the im
pression of clear-eyed fort bright
ness and candor; second, to seem
to attribute the highest of mo
tives and intent to your opponent
while subtlely (at least to those
innocents mentioned above, it is
subtle) suggesting all sorts of
questionable and opportunistic
caprices and humour; third, to
set up for demolition by his own
superior forces of intellect, integ
rity, responsibility and loyalty to
country, a seemingly honest rep
resentation of his opponent's po
sition that too often bears but the
most incidental resemblance to
what that position actually is.
As Mr. Kennedy observed in
their third debate, "I always have
the greatest difficulty in recog
nizing my own position as it is
stated by the vice president." A
nice illustration of this gambil
occurred when Mr. Nixon assured
the TV audience that his posi
tion was exactly opposite that of
Mr. Kennedy's on the matter of
depletion allowances for oil in
that he was for them, leaving it
to the listeners to devine lhat
Mr. Kennedy was unequivocally
against them, all hough ho had
just that moment explained in de
tail his view that all such allow
ances should properly bo sub
jected to scrutiny to determine to
what extent they wore justifiable
and what form, if any, they
should be continued in.
His position on what he and
now some of his more enthusias
tic journalistic supporters (Life
magazine, for instance) call
"growthmanship" is an equally
nice illustration of the first ele
ment mentioned above. At various
times he has excoriated Adlai
Stevenson and the many other
dubious patriotic "sellers of
America short" (Walter Lipp
mann would rank quite high) for
so much as mentioning that the
economic growth rate in this
country has fallen dangerously
behind that of Soviet Russia and
must be accelerated if disaster
does not overtake us in the near
future.
He manages, you see, to insinu
ate the second element here also,
that of implying questionable

loyalties to his opponent while in
•simple hearted fashion assuring
all that he does "not for a minute
suggest that Mr. Stevenson or
Bowles or Kennedy have any but
the highest motives of patriotism
in the matter."
At various times in the last few
years he has sounded somewhat
like a statesman to many of us
by calling for the very things
that he has intermittently damned
the Democratic leaders for de
manding; and now at last he has
j worked out his technique for
being on both sides at once to
such perfection that it has become
almost the central theme of his
campaign. Thus, in almost every
speech or statement now he lays
about him with the greatest heat
belabouring those who "sell
America short" by tearing her
down i you don't have to tear
America down to build her up").
Invariably he closes such
speeches or statements by assur
ing his listeners in that voice of
patronizing unctuousness that in
spite of the immense accomplish
ments of this administration (so
great by implication as to dwarf
J to insignificance all other admin
istrations including Lincoln's) he
is by no means satisfied, he is
never satisfied, thus placing him
self on the record as absolutely
in support of the administration's
record while at the same time
calling for the very same order
of invigorating action and growth
that he anathemetizes the Demo
crats for calling for.
The wonder of it is that the
j transparency of his melhod is not
i obvious to all but is, on the con
! trary, often, very often, taken for
just exactly the high-minded and
patriotic exposition of the Ameri
i can ethic that he represents it to
! be.
You and I both seem to be of
the .same mind that under careful
scrutiny the "New Nixon" is just
i a carefully fumigated version of
llhe "Old Nixon," and basically
{ indistinguishable therefrom,
j There can be small uncertainty,
j though, that Mr. Nixon's "sound-
J ness' appeals tremendously to a
! very great number of Americans
j whether Ihey call themselves
Democrats or Republicans.
The "conventional wisdom" so
i many of us read about in Econ I

As a former editor of the Daily
I I write these few lines and hope
1 you will find space to print them.
| The present football controversy
j brings up several points.
In the first place, does the
Stanford Daily voice the opinion

of tho Stanford student body?
The general impression is that it
does not. That it has not been
representative of the Stanford
student body since the editors of
the Daily became appointive and
ceased to be elected by the stu
dent body.
This is borne out by the contro
versy of a couple of years ago
between ihe Daily staff and the
student body when the staff
threatened to strike or did strike
under suggestion that the Daily
Editor become an elected officer
as formerly. Incidentally, many
hold the view that the Daily in
recent years has leaned strongly
to Ihe left and has injured Stan
ford.
Now the Daily puts forth ideas
on the football question as the
views of Stanford. Since when
has Stanford or Stanford students
become defeatists or quitters? If
there is a wavering of Stanford
spirit, is not the Daily and its
clique repsonsible?
Permit me to suggest that an
attitude such as you have shown
does not present a l-emedy and
misrepresents the student body
and t he University. It also misrep
resents the public and the alumni.
There was no criticism under
Mr. Taylor. All had confidence in
him. The student body, the public
and the alumni seemingly have
lost confidence in Mr. Curtice.
They want Stanford and Ihe pres
ent outstanding crop of Freshmen
to have the most competent in
struction possible under a coach
comparable to those in Stanford's
past. Delay will only cause more
trouble.

football men, reported best in

what extent they wore justifiable
and what form, if any, they
should be continued in.
His position on what he and
now some of his more enthusias
tic journalistic supporters (Life
magazine, for instance) call
"growthmanship" is an equally
nice illustration of the first ele
ment mentioned above. At various
times he has excoriated Adlai
Stevenson and the many other
dubious patriotic "sellers of
America short" (Walter Lipp
mann would rank quite high) for
so much as mentioning that the
economic growth rate in this
country has fallen dangerously
behind that of Soviet Russia and
must be accelerated if disaster
does not overtake us in the near
future.
He manages, you see, to insinu
ate the second element here also,
that of implying questionable

loyalties to his opponent while in
•simple hearted fashion assuring
all that he does "not for a minute
suggest that Mr. Stevenson or
Bowles or Kennedy have any but
the highest motives of patriotism
in the matter."
At various times in the last few
years he has sounded somewhat
like a statesman to many of us
by calling for the very things
that he has intermittently damned
the Democratic leaders for de
manding; and now at last he has
j worked out his technique for
being on both sides at once to
such perfection that it has become
almost the central theme of his
campaign. Thus, in almost every
speech or statement now he lays
about him with the greatest heat
belabouring those who "sell
America short" by tearing her
down i you don't have to tear
America down to build her up").
Invariably he closes such
speeches or statements by assur
ing his listeners in that voice of
patronizing unctuousness that in
spite of the immense accomplish
ments of this administration (so
great by implication as to dwarf
J to insignificance all other admin
istrations including Lincoln's) he
is by no means satisfied, he is
never satisfied, thus placing him
self on the record as absolutely
in support of the administration's
record while at the same time
calling for the very same order
of invigorating action and growth
that he anathemetizes the Demo
crats for calling for.
The wonder of it is that the
j transparency of his melhod is not
i obvious to all but is, on the con
! trary, often, very often, taken for
just exactly the high-minded and
patriotic exposition of the Ameri
i can ethic that he represents it to
! be.
You and I both seem to be of
the .same mind that under careful
scrutiny the "New Nixon" is just
i a carefully fumigated version of
llhe "Old Nixon," and basically
{ indistinguishable therefrom,
j There can be small uncertainty,
j though, that Mr. Nixon's "sound-
J ness' appeals tremendously to a
! very great number of Americans
j whether Ihey call themselves
Democrats or Republicans.
The "conventional wisdom" so
i many of us read about in Econ I
all over, you know. All these ap
peals to emotion and to the
cruder, more primitive manifes
tation of patriotism are just what
the doctor ordered for many of
: us, you know.

Editor, the Daily:
As a former editor of the Daily
I I write these few lines and hope
1 you will find space to print them.
| The present football controversy
j brings up several points.
In the first place, does the
Stanford Daily voice the opinion

of tho Stanford student body?
The general impression is that it
does not. That it has not been
representative of the Stanford
student body since the editors of
the Daily became appointive and
ceased to be elected by the stu
dent body.
This is borne out by the contro
versy of a couple of years ago
between ihe Daily staff and the
student body when the staff
threatened to strike or did strike
under suggestion that the Daily
Editor become an elected officer
as formerly. Incidentally, many
hold the view that the Daily in
recent years has leaned strongly
to Ihe left and has injured Stan
ford.
Now the Daily puts forth ideas
on the football question as the
views of Stanford. Since when
has Stanford or Stanford students
become defeatists or quitters? If
there is a wavering of Stanford
spirit, is not the Daily and its
clique repsonsible?
Permit me to suggest that an
attitude such as you have shown
does not present a l-emedy and
misrepresents the student body
and t he University. It also misrep
resents the public and the alumni.
There was no criticism under
Mr. Taylor. All had confidence in
him. The student body, the public
and the alumni seemingly have
lost confidence in Mr. Curtice.
They want Stanford and Ihe pres
ent outstanding crop of Freshmen
to have the most competent in
struction possible under a coach
comparable to those in Stanford's
past. Delay will only cause more
trouble.
The present crop of Freshmen
football men, reported best in
years, is sufficient answer to the
claim that scholastic conditions
do not. permit good athletes 1o
enter Stanford. While we are con
templating changes let's have
promptly the very best instruc
tion in the country, a Board of
Athletic Control that is really ac
tive and progressive, a new sys
tem of electing an Editor of the
Daily to represent the student
body, and above all, the rebuilding
of the Stanford spirit that does
not know defeatism.
