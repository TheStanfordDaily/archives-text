Editor, the Daily
The tillo, "The Deluders," was
very appropriate for Wednesday's
editorial. It did recognize that
there are fewer dictatorships to
day than seven and one-half years
ago, hut the editorial hastened lo
point out that the Republican Ad
ministration did nol help Hungary
when the Russian Army put down
the Hungarian Rebellion. It
doesn't take the intelligence that
a Stanford student is supposed to
have to realize what would have
been the results if American
troops had been sent in to drive
Russian troops out!
The Republican Administration
was also attacked for allowing
Castro to lake over Cuba. What
do you think this same editorial
would have said if United States
troops had intervened in the in
ternal affairs of a Latin Ameri
can country to protect a dictator?
To make the delusion complete
Ihe editorial lamented Ihat one

. third of the world is under the
' Communist thumb. It doesn't take
j a history major to remember
Who was in power when these
! tragedies occurred. Remember
! Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Po
j land, Czechoslovakia, Rumania,
; Hungary, East Germany? Do you
remember who was president
when Yugoslavia, Albania, part of
( Finland, North Korea, Manchuria,
China, Sakhalin, and the Kuril
Islands were lost? What a "de
| lusion! ! !"
Was your editorial written in
! ignorance; were you "duped"
again; or was it just political
expediency?
