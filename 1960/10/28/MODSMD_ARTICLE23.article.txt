The league leading Stanford
soccer team plays host 1o San
Francisco State this Saturday in
a game that is billed an easy vic
tory lor the Big .Red.
San Francisco State is almost
as helpless as Santa Clara.
The Gators have scored a mere
two goals in their entire league
season. Stanford has given up
only two, and has pierced its op
ponents defense for scores on 17
occasions.
THE GAME will serve Stanford
mainly as a tuneup for the impor
tant CCSF game to be played next:

| week with Stanford's reserves ]
j probably seeing a lot of action.
The starting 11 is as good as any
! in the league, but the reserves]
haven't played much. This game j
is as good as any to give them
game experience.
The only trouble Stanford
mitfht have with San Francisco
State is the latter's unusual of
fense, in which the wings hold
back, and the insides are situated
more toward the goal.
THIS WEEK Stanford soccer
coach Fred Priddle has been de
veloping an offense revolving;
around high-scoring Emmanuel I

i Andah. This system will have An-1
dah playing close to the goal,
with the other forwards keeping
j the defense outside.
With only one man guarding
him, Andah is a sure scorer if he
gets a pass leaving him in posi
tion for a shot.
STANFORD'S starting lineup
■will be the same as it has been
| throughout the season. The de-'
fense will include Beau Bianchi,
goalie; Dan Farthing and Dick
Voake, fullbacks; and Rusty Wil
liams, Bernie Knaggs and Jan
j Aehenbaeh, halfbacks.
I The offense has Mike Tippett,

Rune Engebrettsen, Dick Bart
lctt, Adam Bianchi, and Andah at
forwards.
Stanford's undefeated, untied,
unseored upon junior varsity sor
ter team should have little trou
ble with San Francisco State's
junior varsity. Standouts for the
JV's so far' this year have boon
John Whitelv, Roberto Santa-
Cruz, Bob Cermaek, Don Burr and
Hunt Bascom.
