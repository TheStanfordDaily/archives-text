# Cross Country Runners Play Host to Cal, USC
## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Tomorrow's assignment for
Stanford's cross country squad is
even tougher than that faced by
the footballers. For the Indian
harriers must not only take on
the Southern Cal runners but
must face California as well.
The Indians do not have an out
standing star to match Cal's Alan
Gavlord, and will have to count
on superior team running if they
are to out race the Bears.
ON TIIK BASIS of last week's
meet in Los Angeles, USC also
must be favored, but Ihe Stan
fordites should improve their per
formance upon returning to the
friendly confines of the Farm.
The triangular competition will
take place tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
over the 4.2 mile grass track on
the golf course.
THK TOPHEAVY individual fa
vorite will be Gaylord, holder of

the fifth best time ever over the
local layout, 20 minutes and 34.1
seconds.
Fortunately for the other two
teams, one runner does not make
a cross country race, and depth
and teamwork should make the
difference. A spirited battle is
expected for second place among
five runners. Fernando Leon and
Wayne Hassorott, one-two finish
ers in the L.A. race, top the Tro
jan harriers.
But Rich Klier and John North
way of Stanford should provide a
much stronger challenge this
week, running over their home
course, and Cal's number two
man, Woody Covington, cannot be
counted out.
OUTSTANDING Indian fresh
men Robin Ruble, Dave Boore,
and Bill Pratt may well make the
difference in team scoring. Frank
Wallace and Bruce Johnson also
figure in Stanford victory plans.
