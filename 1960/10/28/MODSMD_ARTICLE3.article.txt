# Adm. Radford Says Off-Shore Defense Is Vital
## 
### ROSS HERMANN 
Admiral Arthur E. Radford. |
backing the candidacy of Vice
President Richard Nixon before
a partially-filled Memorial Audi-!
torium yesterday, said that Que
moy and Matsu are important to ,
the security of Formosa and
should be defended.
Radford, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called
Senator Kennedy's proposal to j
exclude the off-shore islands from
the United States defense perim
eter a "great foreign policy error" !
and an invitation for the Com
munists to attack.
He drew a parallel between 1
Kennedy's position and a foreign 1
policy statement made in 1949
that Korea was indefensible and
outside U.S. defense lines a state
ment which he charged led to the
Korean War.
CONCERNING the defense of
the islands, Radford said that the j
vital questions are whether the i
islands are important to the de- j
fense of Formosa, whether they I
are defensible, and how we can j
tell if an attack on the islands is |
a prelude to aggression against
Formosa.
To the first question, he said j
that the islands, because of their ;
closeness to the mainland, are i
good outposts for observing Com-1
munist movements, providing
early warning. ,
In answering the second ques
tion, he cited the record of the |
Chinese Nationalists in defending
the islands during the last 11
years. During that time, he said,
the islands have been under al-<
most continuous bombardment [
and on three occasions have been
the target of intensive attacks. In
one of these major pushes Red
China lost 10,000 men.
TO THE Till III) question, he j
said that the Communists have
let it be known that their objec
tive is Formosa, not the off-shore j
islands. He indicated that we
must take them at their word'
when they say that the islands are
only stepping stones to their i
major objective.
He said that American prestige
depends upon a consistent set of
foreign policies and charged that !
Kennedy's statements on Quemoy j
and Matsu are already under
mining the U.S. position.
The theme of his speech was
that the United States has "moved
faster in the last eight years than j
at any time in its history" and
now has the greatest military
machine that the world has ever:
seen. He urged the election of
Nixon as "vital to the continued
securitv of the United States."

Admiral Arthur E. Radford. |
backing the candidacy of Vice
President Richard Nixon before
a partially-filled Memorial Audi-!
torium yesterday, said that Que
moy and Matsu are important to ,
the security of Formosa and
should be defended.
Radford, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called
Senator Kennedy's proposal to j
exclude the off-shore islands from
the United States defense perim
eter a "great foreign policy error" !
and an invitation for the Com
munists to attack.
He drew a parallel between 1
Kennedy's position and a foreign 1
policy statement made in 1949
that Korea was indefensible and
outside U.S. defense lines a state
ment which he charged led to the
Korean War.
CONCERNING the defense of
the islands, Radford said that the j
vital questions are whether the i
islands are important to the de- j
fense of Formosa, whether they I
are defensible, and how we can j
tell if an attack on the islands is |
a prelude to aggression against
Formosa.
To the first question, he said j
that the islands, because of their ;
closeness to the mainland, are i
good outposts for observing Com-1
munist movements, providing
early warning. ,
In answering the second ques
tion, he cited the record of the |
Chinese Nationalists in defending
the islands during the last 11
years. During that time, he said,
the islands have been under al-<
most continuous bombardment [
and on three occasions have been
the target of intensive attacks. In
one of these major pushes Red
China lost 10,000 men.
TO THE Till III) question, he j
said that the Communists have
let it be known that their objec
tive is Formosa, not the off-shore j
islands. He indicated that we
must take them at their word'
when they say that the islands are
only stepping stones to their i
major objective.
He said that American prestige
depends upon a consistent set of
foreign policies and charged that !
Kennedy's statements on Quemoy j
and Matsu are already under
mining the U.S. position.
