# a 						mathematician works in the mainstream at IBM
## 
### 
Advanced data processing systems —whether designed
for business, industry, science, or government —have
been made possible by the talents and abilities of the
mathematician.
Harold Mechanic, for instance, is working in areas of
system simulation. He and his colleagues have done
some of their most interesting work in building mathe
matical models to study the performance of proposed
Tele Processing* systems. After transforming the models
into computer language, numerous possible system con
figurations were fed into a giant computer to determine
an optimum arrangement of components. Thus, like many
mathematicians at IBM. Harold Mechanic is able to use
the computer as a tool to advance both theory and tech
nique of systems analysis.

If you are receiving your degree in mathematics, you
might do well to investigate the unusual opportunities at
IBM. Working alone, or as a member of a small team, you
will find many chances to make important contributions
to your field. You will also be eligible for excellent educa
tion programs.
Positions will be open in mathematics research, computer
programming, and applied mathematics. The IBM repre
sentative will be interviewing on your campus. He will be
glad to give you further information. Your placement
office can make an appointment. Or you may write, out
lining your background and interests, to:
Manager of Technical Employment,
IBM Corporation, Dept. 888,
590 Madison Avenue, New York 22, N.


Soon to receive his Ph.D., partially through an IBM education program, Harold Mechanic (B.S. in Mathematics, C.CNY
'53, MA. Columbia '55) is constructing ingenious mathematical models of advanced IBM data processing systems.
