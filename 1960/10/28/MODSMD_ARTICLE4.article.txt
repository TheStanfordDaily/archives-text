# 'Much Ado About Nothing Opens 5-Night Run in Mem Aud Tonight
## 
### 
There'll be "Much Ado About Nothing" tonight in Memorial Auditorium when the Stanford Play
ers stage William Shakespeare's sparkling comedy.
While "about nothing," the plot concerns an accusation of infidelity, a feigned death, a near due
and several arrests. But offsetting and predominating over these sensational aspects will be Beatrice
and Benedick, the Bard's wittiest lovers.
The first production of the year for the Stanford Players, "Much Ado" will begin at 8:30 tonight

The second performance will be
tomorrow night, with the final
shows scheduled Nov. 3-5.
Although set in 1890 Vienna,
"Much Ado" will none the less
retain all of its Elizabethean fla
vor. Some of the character's
names, however, have been slight
ly altered to blend better with the
Viennese mode.
