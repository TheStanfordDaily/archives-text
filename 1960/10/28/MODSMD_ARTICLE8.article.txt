# HOMECOMING
## Troy Set to Spoil Injun Celebration 
### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
Stanford "de-emphasizes" to
morrow.
Yes sir, it's a step down as Jack
Curtice's charges meet easy
pickin's USC in a homecoming en
counter at the Stanford Stadium.
USC DEFINITELY rates a
pushover label as the Trojans
have only won their last two
games, 10-3 over Georgia and 27-
10 over California, not nearly as
impressive a record as those of
UCLA and Washington. As a re
sult the southlanders have been
installed as a meager 11-point
favorite.
The only tilings the Cards will
be facing on Saturday afternoon
are the fabulous McKeever twins,
a fine running backfield, some
sharp passing, a stout defense
and some thirty odd gridders who
are riding the crest of a come
back wave.
To combat this formidable ar
ray, the locals have a team that
has played some good football and
lost, its first six games.
AT THIS same time last year
the two teams were meeting in
the Coliseum with the Los An
gelenos sporting a 19-point favor
ite role. Stanford quickly gave
the odds makers a scare by mov
ing out to an early 7-6 lead which
was boosted to 21-12 at half.
Southern Cal finally won out, but
the final score was 30-28, hardly a
lop-sided win.
In that game Dick Norman com
pleter! 16 for 32, 207 yards and
two touchdowns.
Any chances the Indians have
tomorrow will be resting on the
same sure throwing arm of the
senior quarterback and on the
sometimes sure-handed, so m e
times butter-fingered receivers.
Last week Norman connected on
14 of his 27 aerials for 179 yards
and one of his pitches, a 20-yarder
to fullback Skip Face, accounted
for the Card's only score against
UCLA.
NORMAN HAS been throwing
well but the ends are inexperi
enced and lacking in the natural
ability of Chris Burford and Ben
Robinson of the 1959 squad. So
far this shortcoming has meant
