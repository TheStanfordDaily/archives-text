# HOMECOMING
## Troy Set to Spoil Injun Celebration 
### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
Stanford "de-emphasizes" to
morrow.
Yes sir, it's a step down as Jack
Curtice's charges meet easy
pickin's USC in a homecoming en
counter at the Stanford Stadium.
USC DEFINITELY rates a
pushover label as the Trojans
have only won their last two
games, 10-3 over Georgia and 27-
10 over California, not nearly as
impressive a record as those of
UCLA and Washington. As a re
sult the southlanders have been
installed as a meager 11-point
favorite.
The only tilings the Cards will
be facing on Saturday afternoon
are the fabulous McKeever twins,
a fine running backfield, some
sharp passing, a stout defense
and some thirty odd gridders who
are riding the crest of a come
back wave.
To combat this formidable ar
ray, the locals have a team that
has played some good football and
lost, its first six games.
AT THIS same time last year
the two teams were meeting in
the Coliseum with the Los An
gelenos sporting a 19-point favor
ite role. Stanford quickly gave
the odds makers a scare by mov
ing out to an early 7-6 lead which
was boosted to 21-12 at half.
Southern Cal finally won out, but
the final score was 30-28, hardly a
lop-sided win.
In that game Dick Norman com
pleter! 16 for 32, 207 yards and
two touchdowns.
Any chances the Indians have
tomorrow will be resting on the
same sure throwing arm of the
senior quarterback and on the
sometimes sure-handed, so m e
times butter-fingered receivers.
Last week Norman connected on
14 of his 27 aerials for 179 yards
and one of his pitches, a 20-yarder
to fullback Skip Face, accounted
for the Card's only score against
UCLA.
NORMAN HAS been throwing
well but the ends are inexperi
enced and lacking in the natural
ability of Chris Burford and Ben
Robinson of the 1959 squad. So
far this shortcoming has meant
more dropped passes and fewer
completions.
Face, Gil Dowd and Mac Wylie
handle ihe running chores for
Jactus Jack and they do an un
spectacular, but respectable job.
Both Face and Dowd have been
playing under handicaps for most
of the season; Face broke two j
ribs and injured a knee in the
Wisconsin game and Dowd hurt i
his knee in the San Jose fray, but I
'lie Cards have no one else who
can gain the yards and so the
veterans play anyway.
Much more important lhan of
fensive deficiencies is the fact
that Stanford has given up an
average of 27 points per game to |
their opponents. Flanged by a j
-.low secondary, the Cards find i
it hard to stop the long gainers
and the ensuing touchdowns.
KC HAS PIJCNTY of talent to
take advantage of the Big Red
weaknesses. The residents of!
Figeroa Tech had a tough time i
learning new head coach John
McKay's style of play, but after
losing their first three, the south
landers started to move.
Hal Tobin, with l(>(i yards in j
22 carries, heads the rushers but \
three other Trojans have picked j
up more than 125 yards and a
total of nine backs have accounted |
ior 2.1 or more yards on the
ground.
A! Prukop, Bill Nelsen and Ben
Charles have divided the signal
calling duties for the visitors and
together they pose a potent pass- j
ing threat.
ADDING that little something, |
vVhether it be ability or mayhem. |
are Mike and Marlin, the Mc-

Keever boys who between them
made almost every All-American
team in Ihe nation last year.
Dan Ficea, a 6-1, 243-pound

tackle, will load the charge on
the Stanford line. Ficca is return
ing after being injured last sea
son and thus far he has seen moiT

action than any of the interior
linemen except for returning let
terman center Dave Morgan, a
6-3. 205-pound junior.
Overall Iho Trojans have ex
hibited a consistently good de
fense. holding their opponents,
including Oregon State, Ohio
Stale and Texas Christian, to an
average of about 11 points per
game.
