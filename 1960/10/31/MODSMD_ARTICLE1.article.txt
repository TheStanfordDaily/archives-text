# Stanford Rooters, Team Victorious as Game Is Lost
## 
### SHERRY WELCH 
The final score was 21 to 6 in
favor of USC, but Stanford won
Saturday's football game!
"Let's show them today that
the men of Wilbur do have real
Stanford Spirit . . •. Let's all go to
today's game as a group, sit as a
group, and, most important,
CIIUKR as a group." Thus a
group of Cedro freshmen men
urged their classmates in a mim
eographed "Indian Extra they cir
culated Saturday morning.
This spirit and enthusiasm of
the freshmen could be responsible.
Many say it was Prince Light
foot's disquieting lecture at Fri
day night's rally. And many at
tribute it to freshman football
player Mike Walsh and his im
pressive challenge at the rally.
But a miracle took place in the
rooter's section at Saturday's
game. And I don't think anyone
knows what caused it. The stu
dent body got together and they

did cheer as a group. And they
yelled themselves hoarse and they
supported their team, and their
coach and their yell leader!
With the rooting section al
most filled and more students ar
riving, the freshmen men in well
organized, obviously pre-planned
fashion formed two lines from the
foot of the entrance slope onto
the field.
Then the team entered be
tween the lines of freshmen men
and the rooters cheered. The
game began the test began! Peo
ple felt that some spark had
aroused Stanford spirit, but no
one was sure whether it would
ignite.
Then SC made two touch
downs and the score was 14 to 0
against us. But somehow it didn't
seem to make any difference.
Rather head yell leader Phil
Huyck got up and called for a
Stanford Spell, "Let's really yell,
let's yell so loud every letter

echoes back at us." And no one
thought it was possible, but we
yelled. And "S"-"T"-"A" . . . they
echoed back, so distinctly that
many thought the stands on the
other side must have been repeat
ing the letters.
Then the half arrived with the
score at 14 to 0. Prince Lightfoot
first asked to be heard. He told
the stands that he was amazed
and thrilled, that in all his years
at Stanford he had never heard
as good a rooting section. Not
only was he amazed, but the en
tire Stanford rooters' section was
amazed. "We like Lightfoot! We
like Lightfoot!" resounded
through the stadium.
When Lightfoot had finished
speaking the hand marched on
the field for the half time pro
gram and the students got the j
cards ready for the stunts. They
were beautiful and orderly. Every-1
one seemed not quite sure whether !
the stunts would he successful,

I but appeared to act with the at
titude that he at least would do
his best.
Finally stunt 1(J was called for.
A, B, C, up for the Expanding S.
And it went so well that everyone
holding a metallic red card was
told to stand up and move it to
make it shimmer in the sun. Then
the entiie section stood up. A, B,
C, down, and it was time to pass
the cards to the center aisle. Re
minded of the San Jose game and
the child who was hit in the eye
by a card at the halftime, stu
dents started to pass the cards
to the center. And not one was
thrown. No one could believe it
But not one.
From then on, Stanford knew it
was our game.
One water balloon was thrown,
or perhaps two or three, but they
were greeted with hissing and
booing.
Then at the end of the third
' quarter, a Phil Huyck yell was

started and the stands really i
seemed to want to go all out to |
express their backing of him.'
Huyck turned to the microphone)
"Thanks guys, but there's a J
team out on the field working j
hard for us and they really need I
our support . . ."- and he led an-1
other yell.
A little later he asked if the j
stands would like to do the AXE i
yell. And he asked for a display
of hands, with the nays getting j
it and the decision made to wait I
until we face Cal to first give the
yea
Then with 58 seconds left in
the game and the score now 21 to
6, the stands were still yelling
"Beat SC. Beat SC." One or two
people began to leave the stands,
and Huyck asked that all those
leaving early turn their student
body cards in at the gate—for
they wei>e no longer Stanford
students.
After the game, "We want the!

team! We want the team!" was
the cry starting in the stands.
The players came over in front
of the rooters' section and Coach
Jack Curtice spoke—"We think
you rooters were wonderful.
We're going to go out and beat
somebody. You can bet on that."
Then Captain Dean Hinshaw
took over the microphone. For a
moment he didn't say anything,
then "In the four years I've been
at Stanford I've never seen a root
ing section like this. Don t think
it doesn't count. The guys on the
team asked me to tell you—
thanks a helluva lot."
And the players carried Curtice
off on their shoulders. And the
rooters sang the Stanford Hymn
—"Hail! Stanford, Hail!—and
meant it.
There's been a lot of talk of
moral victory on the Farm in the
past several years; but until Sat
urday. we never knew what a
moral victory was.

And it went so well that everyone
holding a metallic red card was
told to stand up and move it to
make it shimmer in the sun. Then
the entiie section stood up. A, B,
C, down, and it was time to pass
the cards to the center aisle. Re
minded of the San Jose game and
the child who was hit in the eye
by a card at the halftime, stu
dents started to pass the cards
to the center. And not one was
thrown. No one could believe it
But not one.
From then on, Stanford knew it
was our game.
One water balloon was thrown,
or perhaps two or three, but they
were greeted with hissing and
booing.
Then at the end of the third

started and the stands really i

express their backing of him.'
Huyck turned to the microphone)
"Thanks guys, but there's a J
team out on the field working j

our support . . ."- and he led an-1

A little later he asked if the j

of hands, with the nays getting j
it and the decision made to wait I
until we face Cal to first give the

Then with 58 seconds left in
the game and the score now 21 to

"Beat SC. Beat SC." One or two
people began to leave the stands,
and Huyck asked that all those
leaving early turn their student
body cards in at the gate—for
they wei>e no longer Stanford
students.
After the game, "We want the!

team! We want the team!" was
the cry starting in the stands.
The players came over in front
of the rooters' section and Coach
Jack Curtice spoke—"We think
you rooters were wonderful.
We're going to go out and beat
somebody. You can bet on that."
Then Captain Dean Hinshaw
took over the microphone. For a

then "In the four years I've been
at Stanford I've never seen a root
ing section like this. Don t think
it doesn't count. The guys on the
team asked me to tell you—
thanks a helluva lot."
And the players carried Curtice
off on their shoulders. And the
rooters sang the Stanford Hymn
—"Hail! Stanford, Hail!—and

The final score was 21 to 6 in
favor of USC, but Stanford won
Saturday's football game!
"Let's show them today that
the men of Wilbur do have real
Stanford Spirit . . •. Let's all go to
today's game as a group, sit as a
group, and, most important,
CIIUKR as a group." Thus a
group of Cedro freshmen men
urged their classmates in a mim
eographed "Indian Extra they cir
culated Saturday morning.
This spirit and enthusiasm of
the freshmen could be responsible.
Many say it was Prince Light
foot's disquieting lecture at Fri
day night's rally. And many at
tribute it to freshman football
player Mike Walsh and his im
pressive challenge at the rally.
But a miracle took place in the
rooter's section at Saturday's
game. And I don't think anyone
knows what caused it. The stu
dent body got together and they

did cheer as a group. And they
yelled themselves hoarse and they
supported their team, and their
coach and their yell leader!
With the rooting section al
most filled and more students ar
riving, the freshmen men in well
organized, obviously pre-planned
fashion formed two lines from the
foot of the entrance slope onto
the field.
Then the team entered be
tween the lines of freshmen men
and the rooters cheered. The
game began the test began! Peo
ple felt that some spark had
aroused Stanford spirit, but no
one was sure whether it would
ignite.
Then SC made two touch
downs and the score was 14 to 0
against us. But somehow it didn't
seem to make any difference.
Rather head yell leader Phil
Huyck got up and called for a
Stanford Spell, "Let's really yell,
let's yell so loud every letter

echoes back at us." And no one
thought it was possible, but we
yelled. And "S"-"T"-"A" . . . they
echoed back, so distinctly that
many thought the stands on the
other side must have been repeat
ing the letters.
Then the half arrived with the
score at 14 to 0. Prince Lightfoot
first asked to be heard. He told
the stands that he was amazed
and thrilled, that in all his years
at Stanford he had never heard
as good a rooting section. Not
only was he amazed, but the en
tire Stanford rooters' section was
amazed. "We like Lightfoot! We
like Lightfoot!" resounded
through the stadium.
When Lightfoot had finished
speaking the hand marched on
the field for the half time pro
gram and the students got the j
cards ready for the stunts. They
were beautiful and orderly. Every-1

Stanford Spirit . . •. Let's all go to
today's game as a group, sit as a
group, and, most important,
CIIUKR as a group." Thus a
group of Cedro freshmen men
urged their classmates in a mim
eographed "Indian Extra they cir
culated Saturday morning.
This spirit and enthusiasm of
the freshmen could be responsible.
Many say it was Prince Light
foot's disquieting lecture at Fri
day night's rally. And many at
tribute it to freshman football
player Mike Walsh and his im
pressive challenge at the rally.
But a miracle took place in the
rooter's section at Saturday's
game. And I don't think anyone
knows what caused it. The stu
dent body got together and they

did cheer as a group. And they
yelled themselves hoarse and they
supported their team, and their
coach and their yell leader!
With the rooting section al
most filled and more students ar
riving, the freshmen men in well
organized, obviously pre-planned
fashion formed two lines from the
foot of the entrance slope onto
the field.
Then the team entered be
tween the lines of freshmen men
and the rooters cheered. The
game began the test began! Peo
ple felt that some spark had
aroused Stanford spirit, but no
one was sure whether it would
ignite.
Then SC made two touch
downs and the score was 14 to 0
against us. But somehow it didn't
seem to make any difference.
Rather head yell leader Phil
Huyck got up and called for a
Stanford Spell, "Let's really yell,
let's yell so loud every letter

echoes back at us." And no one
thought it was possible, but we
yelled. And "S"-"T"-"A" . . . they
echoed back, so distinctly that
many thought the stands on the
other side must have been repeat
ing the letters.
Then the half arrived with the
score at 14 to 0. Prince Lightfoot
first asked to be heard. He told
the stands that he was amazed
and thrilled, that in all his years
at Stanford he had never heard
as good a rooting section. Not
only was he amazed, but the en
tire Stanford rooters' section was
amazed. "We like Lightfoot! We
like Lightfoot!" resounded
through the stadium.
When Lightfoot had finished
speaking the hand marched on
the field for the half time pro
gram and the students got the j
cards ready for the stunts. They
were beautiful and orderly. Every-1
one seemed not quite sure whether !
the stunts would he successful,

I but appeared to act with the at
titude that he at least would do
his best.
Finally stunt 1(J was called for.
A, B, C, up for the Expanding S.
And it went so well that everyone
holding a metallic red card was
told to stand up and move it to
make it shimmer in the sun. Then
the entiie section stood up. A, B,
C, down, and it was time to pass
the cards to the center aisle. Re
minded of the San Jose game and
the child who was hit in the eye
by a card at the halftime, stu
dents started to pass the cards
to the center. And not one was
thrown. No one could believe it
But not one.
From then on, Stanford knew it
was our game.
One water balloon was thrown,
or perhaps two or three, but they
were greeted with hissing and
booing.
Then at the end of the third
' quarter, a Phil Huyck yell was

started and the stands really i
seemed to want to go all out to |
express their backing of him.'
Huyck turned to the microphone)
"Thanks guys, but there's a J
team out on the field working j
hard for us and they really need I
our support . . ."- and he led an-1
other yell.
A little later he asked if the j
stands would like to do the AXE i
yell. And he asked for a display
of hands, with the nays getting j
it and the decision made to wait I
until we face Cal to first give the
yea
Then with 58 seconds left in
the game and the score now 21 to
6, the stands were still yelling
"Beat SC. Beat SC." One or two
people began to leave the stands,
and Huyck asked that all those
leaving early turn their student
body cards in at the gate—for
they wei>e no longer Stanford
students.
After the game, "We want the!

team! We want the team!" was
the cry starting in the stands.
The players came over in front
of the rooters' section and Coach
Jack Curtice spoke—"We think
you rooters were wonderful.
We're going to go out and beat
somebody. You can bet on that."
Then Captain Dean Hinshaw
took over the microphone. For a
moment he didn't say anything,
then "In the four years I've been
at Stanford I've never seen a root
ing section like this. Don t think
it doesn't count. The guys on the
team asked me to tell you—
thanks a helluva lot."
And the players carried Curtice
off on their shoulders. And the
rooters sang the Stanford Hymn
—"Hail! Stanford, Hail!—and
meant it.
There's been a lot of talk of
moral victory on the Farm in the
past several years; but until Sat

C, down, and it was time to pass
the cards to the center aisle. Re
minded of the San Jose game and
the child who was hit in the eye
by a card at the halftime, stu
dents started to pass the cards
to the center. And not one was
thrown. No one could believe it
But not one.
From then on, Stanford knew it
was our game.
One water balloon was thrown,
or perhaps two or three, but they
were greeted with hissing and
booing.
Then at the end of the third
' quarter, a Phil Huyck yell was

started and the stands really i
seemed to want to go all out to |
express their backing of him.'
Huyck turned to the microphone)
"Thanks guys, but there's a J
team out on the field working j
hard for us and they really need I
our support . . ."- and he led an-1
other yell.
A little later he asked if the j
stands would like to do the AXE i
yell. And he asked for a display
of hands, with the nays getting j
it and the decision made to wait I
until we face Cal to first give the
yea
Then with 58 seconds left in
the game and the score now 21 to
6, the stands were still yelling
"Beat SC. Beat SC." One or two
people began to leave the stands,
and Huyck asked that all those
leaving early turn their student
body cards in at the gate—for
they wei>e no longer Stanford
students.
After the game, "We want the!

team! We want the team!" was
the cry starting in the stands.
The players came over in front
of the rooters' section and Coach
Jack Curtice spoke—"We think
you rooters were wonderful.
We're going to go out and beat
somebody. You can bet on that."
Then Captain Dean Hinshaw
took over the microphone. For a
moment he didn't say anything,
then "In the four years I've been
at Stanford I've never seen a root
ing section like this. Don t think
it doesn't count. The guys on the
team asked me to tell you—
thanks a helluva lot."
And the players carried Curtice
off on their shoulders. And the
rooters sang the Stanford Hymn
—"Hail! Stanford, Hail!—and
meant it.
There's been a lot of talk of
moral victory on the Farm in the
past several years; but until Sat
urday. we never knew what a
moral victory was.

Gives rousing rally talk
The final score was 21 to 6 in
favor of USC, but Stanford won
Saturday's football game!
"Let's show them today that
the men of Wilbur do have real
Stanford Spirit . . •. Let's all go to
today's game as a group, sit as a
group, and, most important,
CIIUKR as a group." Thus a
group of Cedro freshmen men
urged their classmates in a mim
eographed "Indian Extra they cir
culated Saturday morning.
This spirit and enthusiasm of
the freshmen could be responsible.
Many say it was Prince Light
foot's disquieting lecture at Fri
day night's rally. And many at
tribute it to freshman football
player Mike Walsh and his im
pressive challenge at the rally.
But a miracle took place in the
rooter's section at Saturday's
game. And I don't think anyone
knows what caused it. The stu
dent body got together and they

did cheer as a group. And they
yelled themselves hoarse and they
supported their team, and their
coach and their yell leader!
With the rooting section al
most filled and more students ar
riving, the freshmen men in well
organized, obviously pre-planned
fashion formed two lines from the
foot of the entrance slope onto
the field.
Then the team entered be
tween the lines of freshmen men
and the rooters cheered. The
game began the test began! Peo
ple felt that some spark had
aroused Stanford spirit, but no
one was sure whether it would
ignite.
Then SC made two touch
downs and the score was 14 to 0
against us. But somehow it didn't
seem to make any difference.
Rather head yell leader Phil
Huyck got up and called for a
Stanford Spell, "Let's really yell,
let's yell so loud every letter

echoes back at us." And no one
thought it was possible, but we
yelled. And "S"-"T"-"A" . . . they
echoed back, so distinctly that
many thought the stands on the
other side must have been repeat
ing the letters.
Then the half arrived with the
score at 14 to 0. Prince Lightfoot
first asked to be heard. He told
the stands that he was amazed
and thrilled, that in all his years
at Stanford he had never heard
as good a rooting section. Not
only was he amazed, but the en
tire Stanford rooters' section was
amazed. "We like Lightfoot! We
like Lightfoot!" resounded
through the stadium.
When Lightfoot had finished
speaking the hand marched on
the field for the half time pro
gram and the students got the j
cards ready for the stunts. They
were beautiful and orderly. Every-1
one seemed not quite sure whether !
the stunts would he successful,

I but appeared to act with the at
titude that he at least would do
his best.
Finally stunt 1(J was called for.
A, B, C, up for the Expanding S.
And it went so well that everyone
holding a metallic red card was
told to stand up and move it to
make it shimmer in the sun. Then
the entiie section stood up. A, B,
C, down, and it was time to pass
the cards to the center aisle. Re
minded of the San Jose game and
the child who was hit in the eye
