# A 						Magnificent Day

### 
Stanford lost another football game on the field Saturday, but
scored perhaps tlie greatest moral victory in the history of this
institution.
It was simply unbelievable. The rooting section was never finer.
Its yells resounded and echoed throughout the vast stadium. The
card stunts were perfect. And the most amazing of the amazing
occurred; not a single card was thrown after the stunts.
The band was absolute perfection. After the game, they
marched toward the locker rooms playing "Come Join the Band,"
louder and more stirring than ever before.
Kudos also go to Phil Huyek and the pom-pon girls, all of
whom were superb. Ami a special note of congratulations and
heart-felt thanks to Prince Light foot, who is probably more respon
sible than any other man for this wonderful display of Stanford
spirit, a spirit which was obviously not dead, but just hiding.
Prince Lightfoot was still dancing and the fans were still cheering
long after victory was impossible.
But the greatest moment came after the game when not a single
member of the rooting section left his seat. Instead, they all rose
and shouted: "We want the team! We want the team!" And the
team came. There were more yells. "Beat Cal! Beat Cal!" they
shouted again and again. The stadium shook to its rafters.
1 hey will beat Cal, but why get so far ahead? First there's
Oregon and then there's Oregon State. We'll beat them, too. How
can we miss? Spirit reigns supreme once again at Stanford Uni
versity. This is the spirit which permeated every nook and cranny
of this campus in years past. This is the spirit which gives the
team that little something extra. This is the spirit which makes
going to Stanford an honor. Let's make sure it doesn't go into
hid ing again.
