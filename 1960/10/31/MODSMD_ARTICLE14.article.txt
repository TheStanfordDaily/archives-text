Editor, the Daily:
I would like to congratulate
the Stanford student body not
only for a rebirth of spirit, but
also for the reassertion of its dig
nity and selfrespect. Anyone who
saw the game on Saturday could
not help but come away feeling
that Stanford was a university
proud of its team and its tradi
tions, and confident in its future.
The real Stanford spirit, which
had lain so long beneath a cover
ing of water balloons, eggs, de
featism, and pseudo-sophistica
tion, has finally come to the top.
Thanks and congratulations to
Prince Lightfoot, Mike Walsh, a
spirited Class of '64, and to the
student body as a whole. It is a
privilege and a pleasure to be
able to work with such a group.
All than can be said now is—keep
it up!

As the campaign enters its fina'i
two weeks, it is becoming in
creasingly evident that Richard
Nixon is reverting to the "old"
Nixon of past elections. All the '
old themes are there, from the
"soft on communism" line to the
emotional appeals involving "be
lief in America," simple virtues
and humble origin. Only this j
time these techniques are all the
more reprehensible because the
office of president is so much
more important than that of
senator.
The rational citizen can only be
dismayed by these reminders of!
an ugly past. Accuracy has gone
to the wind; distortion is the or
der of the day. We are told that
United States prestige is at a 1
peak when anybody who reads
knows otherwise.
"We are told that "eleven dicta
tors were in South America when
we came in in 1953. Today only
three are left, including one in
Cuba. That's pretty good prog
ress." But no mention is made of
the fact that seven of the eight
dictators who fell were supported
until the bitter end by the Eisen
hower administration (including
Batista).
We are told that Kennedy is
soft on communism because he
would "surrender" the off-shore
islands. The same charge is made
because, according to Nixon, he
suggested that Eisenhower ex
press "regrets" over the U-2 flight.
What Kennedy actually said last I
May was: "If he (Khrushchev)
had merely asked that the United
States should express regrets,
then that would have been a
reasonable term.
"To say we should try those
involved quite obviously meant
that he wanted to break it (the
summit conference) up and we i
had no alternative but to let him j
do so." This analysis shows that
Kennedy was at least aware of the
value of expressing regrets as a
means of saving face, as has been
recently pointed out by Walter
Lippman. Nixon's super-patriotic

stand can only be attributed to his
mania to appear "strong on com
munism/'
None of these answers to Nix
on's positions are new; they have
all been used by Kennedy him
self. However, these rebuttals
have served only to drive Nixon
to greater distortions, or further
emotional appeals.
It is hard to believe Nixon does
not aim his speeches at the lowest
common denominator of public
intelligence. Indeed, it is hard not
to agree with Max Ascoli's asser
tion that "The more this cam
paign goes on, the stronger the
conviction grows that Mr. Nixon's
way of pursuing the presidency
disqualifies him from the very of
fice he seeks."

Editor, the Daily:
The Daily's editorial of October
27 has, in my opinion, confused
the role of judgment by the press
with a defense of the freedom of
the press.
Part of this confusion is more
apparent than real: the literary
style that prominently displays at
the beginning of a paragraph the
statement chastising the Ex Com
for, . . failure to realize that a
newspaper staff is its own best
judge," clearly invites itself to be
snapped up by the hasty reader
as the true 'gist' of the editorial,
and thus connotes a position more
extreme than the entire editorial,
in context, seems to imply.
Nothwithstanding allowances j
for this apparent confusion, how
ever, the Daily has sought to de
fend the freedom of the press by
asserting that the newspaper
staff is best equipped to judge
who is the best man to champion
the role of a free press. I submit j
that the real issue (which is men- !
tioned in the following paragraph j
of the editorial) is that "... the |
right of the people (is) to think !
and criticize for themselves."
Any attempt to throttle a news- |
paper amounts to an attempt to |
abrogate this right, and all such
attempts, such as that of the Ex j
Com, should be condemned. How- i
ever, if we are to carry the phi
losophy that "the right of the
people (is) to think and criticize
for themselves" to its logical con
clusion, we must conclude that
the quality of judgment that any
particular newspaper staff dem
onstrates in selecting the "people"
should evaluate that paper, rather
than a valid defense for the free
dom of the press.
The Ex Com was wrong in its
attempt to control the press, but
how does it follow logically that
the press can best judge itself? It
would appear more logical—and
more in tune with the funda
mental justification of "freedom
of the press"—that the judge of
the newspaper and its editor must
be the "people" themselves.
You are right if you take this
as an expression by one of those
"people" of displeasure with your
editorial.
