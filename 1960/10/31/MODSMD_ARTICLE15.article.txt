Having seen something of the
New Deal in (he thirties, I have
been struck with how much alike
and how very different are the
Roosevelt and the Kennedy cam
paigns.
The difference is that Roosevelt
was far more "radical" than Ken
nedy is today. The similarity is
that Roosevelt did in the thirties
what Kennedy will do nowâ€”
which is to bring new blood and
new brains into a tired and dis
couraged government. The secret
of Kennedy's appeal lies in the
hope he arouses that the country
will enter into a time of renewal
and revival, of hope and of en
ergy, of fresh interest and of con
fidence.
The difference is important and
highly significant. It is not, I
think, an over-simplification to
say that when Roosevelt took of
fice at the depth of the Great De
pression, he committed himself to
a substantial change in the struc
ture of the social order. He set
out to reduce the political and
economic power of the banks and
corporations and to build up the
countervailing power of the labor
unions, of the farmers, of the
Negroes and other depressed and
submerged minorities.
It was upon this radical struc
tural change that Roosevelt es
tablished the welfare state. The
controversies wli ic h Roosevelt

aroused in the
thirties were vio
lent and bitter.
They were much
more violent and
bitter than those
wh i eh Kennedy
arouses, except
of course among
his religious ene
mies. The great
bitterness and

violence of I he thirties was
clue to the fact that the
central issue then, unlike the cen
tral issue now, was a change in
the internal balance of power
among: social groups. For many
who felt that they were hurt by
this change Roosevelt was re
gardetl as a traitor to his class.
The cutting edge of their bitter
ness was not that he provided wel
fare measures for the poor, but
that he pushed through changes
in the relative status and power
and privileges of banks, corpora
tions, ii n i on s, farmers, and
Negroes.
This radical issue is lacking in
the present contest. For the situa
tion has changed in the course of
these thirty years. The balance of
the social group has changed very
considerably. Big business now
deals on even terms with the big
unions and there is a rising senti
ment that both need to have im
posed on them a sterner social
discipline. The farmers still have
serious problems. But they are
not, as they were before the New
Deal, on the outside of govern
ment looking in.
In thirty years there have vir
tually disappeared those prob
lems of power and privilege which
were the central concern of the
New Deal. This has come in part
because of the New Deal itself.
In greater part it has come be
cause of a technological and man
agerial revolution which has ex
panded enormously the produc
tivity of the American economy
and the distribution of its goods

among consumers.
The internal balance of eco
nomic growth is so generally ac
ceptable today that the struggle
of classes, as European markets
know it, as in a sense we ex
perienced it in the thirties, has
subsided. Kennedy is not a New
Dealer of the thirties because the
central problem of the thirties
has been solved. It is fair to add
that Roosevelt, in the sixties
would not: be a New Dealer of
the thirties.
Since there is no issue of social
power, the whole spectrum of
what is the left, the center, and
the right has shifted to the right.
Unlike any other large country
of the world, there is no socialist,
much less a Communist, party in
this country. I would describe
Kennedy's social philosophy and
program as about the same as
that of the British Conservatives
under Mr. Macmillan. They are
hardly distinguishable from the
philosophy and program of a pro
gressive American conservative
like Governor Rockefeller.
What Kennedy stands for is
not a change in the structure of
our society. In this fundamental
respect he is (indubitably con
servative. He does not intend to
take the ship of state apart and
rebuild it to a new design. What
he does intend to do is to provide
it with a captain and officers who
know where they are going and
have the will to go there. For a
ship, however soundly it is de
signed and constructed, can drift
aimlessly in the stormy seas if it
is not properly fueled and navi
gated and commanded.
