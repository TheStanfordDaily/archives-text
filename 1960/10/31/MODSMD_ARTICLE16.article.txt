# Profile of Nehru
## 
### MAHYAR NASHAT 
On a sunny day last September,
we were waiting at Idlewild Air
port for (he arrival of one of the
most exciting and significant lead
ers of the 20th century.
"He is great, he is charming,"
said actress Shirley MacLaine,
who happened to travel in the
•same Air India International. "1
sat with him and talked aboul
how to clean up this whole mess."
This gives a good idea of the sort
of impression Jawaherlal Nehru,
Prime Minister of India, makes on
his interlocutors.
Nehru's mission to the United
Nations was to prevent more war
clouds and provocative propa
ganda from forming, and to re
conciliate the leaders of the West
and the East by a direct and im
mediate meeting between Khru
shchev and Eisenhower.
The wisdom, the patience and
the tolerance of the Orient meet
with logic, the reason and the cul
ture of the West in his person. "I
have become a queer mixture of
the East and the West," he once
said, "out of place everywhere
and at home nowhere,"
The "mixture" began early in
life when he was sent to England,
to study at Harrow and Cam
bridge, where lie obtained his law
degree. His passion for Mother
India drew him into politics and
he soon joined the nationalist
movement of Ghandi. Since then
he has spent 10 years of his life
in jail. During this period, he pro
duced one of the most beautiful
English works, his "Autobiog
raphy" and his famous, "Glimpses
of World History," penned in the
form of letters to his daughter.
It is said that during the three
years he passed in jail from 1943-
45, he read over one thousand
books.

Is he a tough man? He has
never tried to force reform in his
country, because he believes that
such a process may destroy demo
cratic India. Is he a sentimental
pacifist ? He has jailed more Com
munists than any other country,
save, perhaps, Soviet Russia and
Red China.
When you meet him person to
person, you realize how simple,
modest and attentive he is. No
gesture of the hands, slow move
ments of ihe head and an impres
sive, penetrating voice. He has
kopl himself in good physical con
dition through exercise (he is not
an ascetic); he has a handsome
face tanned from his country's
sunshine, lie walks with quick
and small steps, with hands
sometimes behind his back.
He is a philosopher who thinks
about himself, India and the

world. "Some kind of co-existence
is the only way to live on," he
says."The alternative is co-de
struction." This explains his po
litical attitude as one of the lead
ers of th«' neutral countries, lie is
convinced that "neither capital
ism nor communism will do for
India. India will have to do its
own thinking and planning among
democratic socialist lines," he
says.
Although he has been sympa
thetic to Marxist philosophy from
his youth, yet he says that he is
not a Communist, "chiefly he
cause I resist the Communist
tendency to treat communism as
a holy doctrine. I do not. like
being told what to do ... too
much violence is associated with
Communist methods. The ends
cannot be separated from its
means."
