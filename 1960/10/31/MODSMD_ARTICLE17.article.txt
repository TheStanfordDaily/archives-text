# Coach Lauds Rooters
## 
### 
To Coach Jack Curtice the big
gest thing about the Stanford-
USC game wasn't the tremendous
effort of his Stanford Indians on
the field, but the inspired yelling
of the Stanford rooting section.
Curtice called the rooters' per
formance "the most a m a zing
thing that I've seen in 2<i years
of coaching." He further intimat
ed that the rooters' spirit played
no small part in the Indians' in
spired play.
CURTICE SAID that the Indi
ans were downhearted at first,
when it appeared they were
marching down field, only to have
Jerry Traynham make a freak
interception and run it over for
SC's first score. He went on to
say that, sparked by Ihe fans' en
thusiasm, they played Ihe Tro
jans even in the second half.
Curtice praised three sopho
mores for their individual per
formances, although he said that
the work of the team as a whole
was good. The three are Stan
Lindskog, defensive back, and C.
B. Simons and Sieve 1 Mayer, line
men.
Player took over the starting
right guard spot after Stanford's
three top players at that position
were hurt. Player, a 180-pounder,
never had played right guard lie

fore, and had to learn the signals
during Iho game.
THE ONLY serious injury was
suffered by Errol Scott, a dislo
cated shoulder. He may play next
week.
