John McKay mu m bled terse
answers to the small band of
sportswritcrs after his University
of Southern California Trojans
had headed for the showers.
Clearly the man was unhappy.
His hefty squad had just hand
ed the Stanford Indians a 21-6
defeat, but they had looked far
from a powerhouse in doing it.
One reporter asked if the coach
thought his team had played well.
McKay only lifted his head in
disbelief that someone had asked
such a maddening question. He
went on to say that he and his
coaching staff had figured the
Trojans would score four touch
downs and the Cards two. His
estimate of both teams was short
by one touchdown, and the south
landers' last touchdown drive
came after a Stanford gamble
late in the waning minutes; so
it is fairly safe to think that the
Trojans could have been held to
but two tallies.
MIKE McKEEVER, the much
talked-about lethal guard, played
only on defense and wasn't out

standing. When asked about this,
McKay replied: "Mike has just
recovered from a had case of the
flu and it was awfully hot out
there on ihe field. Our plan was
lo play him only on defense and
go with Samuels on the offense,
hut sometimes we couldn't pull
him out of the game because of
the wild card substitution rule.
You can quote me on this: The

present substitution rule is the
most ridiculous rule in the United
State."
Stanford quarterback Dick Nor
man had a pretty good day in
the passing department. When
queried about this, McKay said,
"We ilied to put tho big rush on

once in a while, but we're not
fast enough to really rush any
one too strongly."
The coach seemed to he in a
hurry and with one final mumbled
statement about hatred of
fumbles and penalties, the inter
view ended.
