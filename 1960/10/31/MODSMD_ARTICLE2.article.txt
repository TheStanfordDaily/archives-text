# Troy Dumps Cards For Seventh Loss
## 
### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
A resurgence of Stanford spirit swept through the stadium, over
flowed onto he field and caught up the Indian eleven as they out
charged and outplayed the heavily favored Southern California
Trojans for most of the game Saturday afternoon.
Even the fact that the Cards lost by a 21-6 count to remain win-

less for tho season failed to dim
the Homecoming enthusiasm of
some 30,000 fans. A leaky sieve
secondary that has plagued the
Indians all year was plugged and
the vaunted Trojans could get
only two of their three TD's
against the Farm squad's de
fenses, both of these mainly on
short, grind-'em-out techniques.
RETURNING to the ranks of
the civilized, the Stanford rooting
section displayed one of its best
performances and Dick Norman,
ace Card quarterback, supple
mented with a 15-pass comple
tions in 27 attempts record on the
football field.
Stanford was right up with the
Trojans, accumulating 13 first
downs to the winner's 17 and
gaining 218 yards, 129 on Nor
man's passing, to 282 for SC.
Gil Dowd picked up 39 yards to
lead the Stanford rushers while
sophomores Stan Lindskog and
C. B. Simons starred on defense.
Lindskog was a vital cog in a
pass defense that limited Troy
to one completion and Simons
led both teams with ten tackles
and he twice threw opposing
backs for big losses.
FOR TIIE FIRST three plays
Stanford did well enough. After
taking tho opening kickoff back
to their own 27 yard line, the
Cards picked up a first down on
a completed pass and two runs.
Then Dick Norman faded back
and passed to Mac Wylie in the
right flat. Wylie juggled the ball,
it flew into the air and cagy vet
eran Jerry Trayman was right
there to pick it off and continue
unhampered the remaining 35
yards to the end zone. Don Zachik,
