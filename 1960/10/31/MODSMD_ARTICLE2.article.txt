# Troy Dumps Cards For Seventh Loss
## 
### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
A resurgence of Stanford spirit swept through the stadium, over
flowed onto he field and caught up the Indian eleven as they out
charged and outplayed the heavily favored Southern California
Trojans for most of the game Saturday afternoon.
Even the fact that the Cards lost by a 21-6 count to remain win-

less for tho season failed to dim
the Homecoming enthusiasm of
some 30,000 fans. A leaky sieve
secondary that has plagued the
Indians all year was plugged and
the vaunted Trojans could get
only two of their three TD's
against the Farm squad's de
fenses, both of these mainly on
short, grind-'em-out techniques.
RETURNING to the ranks of
the civilized, the Stanford rooting
section displayed one of its best
performances and Dick Norman,
ace Card quarterback, supple
mented with a 15-pass comple
tions in 27 attempts record on the
football field.
Stanford was right up with the
Trojans, accumulating 13 first
downs to the winner's 17 and
gaining 218 yards, 129 on Nor
man's passing, to 282 for SC.
Gil Dowd picked up 39 yards to
lead the Stanford rushers while
sophomores Stan Lindskog and
C. B. Simons starred on defense.
Lindskog was a vital cog in a
pass defense that limited Troy
to one completion and Simons
led both teams with ten tackles
and he twice threw opposing
backs for big losses.
FOR TIIE FIRST three plays
Stanford did well enough. After
taking tho opening kickoff back
to their own 27 yard line, the
Cards picked up a first down on
a completed pass and two runs.
Then Dick Norman faded back
and passed to Mac Wylie in the
right flat. Wylie juggled the ball,
it flew into the air and cagy vet
eran Jerry Trayman was right
there to pick it off and continue
unhampered the remaining 35
yards to the end zone. Don Zachik,
a 5-8, 155-pound. 26-year-old,
kicked iho extra point and SC had
a 7-0 lead with just a little 1 over
two minutes of the ball game
gone.
It began to look like a big loss
and that feeling was intensified
later in the first quarter.
STANFORD took over after the
first Troy score and marched 40
yards before they stalled on the
visitors' 34. From there SC reeled
off a series of long gains to move
the required 66 yards for another
six points in 13 plays. Hal Tobin
put the finishing touches on the
effort by charging from the Stan
ford two. and then charging again
after he was temporarily stopped
for the score. It was Zachik again
and a discouraging 1M) on the
scoreboard.
This could have been a rerun
of the San Jose game but the de
fense toughened and Stanford
slowly began to fight back. In the
■second quarter the Cards couldn't
gain the momentum to make a
serious threat but they allowed
SC just one penetration into the
Farm territory and on that oc
casion Simons came bursting
through the line, throwing Bil
Nelson for a loss and recovering
the ensuing fumble.
Senior guard Don Peter showed
more of the Big Red desire as he
recovered a fumble on SC's first
play from scrimmage in the sec
ond half and Curtice's charges
had possession on the enemy 29
yard marker.
TWO RUNS accounted for
eight of the 29. and then Norman
passed to sophomore end Steve
Pursell who ran like nothing but
the end zone was good enough
for him. Ho was finally brought
down half a yard short and it took
Hal Steuber to hit paydirt. Sud
denly Stanford was back in the
ball game and the rooters yelled
for a two-point extra. The try, a
run by Skip Face around the right
side, failed, and it was a nice,
cozy 14-6 with almost half the
ball game still to be played.
Southern Cal failed to get past
the midfield stripe during the en
tire third quarter while the In
dians raised hopes again by run
ning and passing to a first and
len on the south lander's 13. Coach
John McKay's gridders tightened
their bolts, however, and the
Farm did nothing but waste time
as Face's field goal attempt from
the 27 went wide.
Threatening thrice and scoring
once. USC made the final seven
points after three forth-stanza
forays into Indian territory.
ON Till: FIRST drive, the
locals held Troy on downs at the
Stanford 29. On the second the vis
itors were forced to punt and Mar-
Jin McKeever booted a high,
spiraling kick that hit on about
the ten, bounced, rolled and came
to rest in the end zone by the
barest of margins.
Proving again that success
comes in threes, fullback Ben
Wilson smashed over left guard to
cap a 50-yard Trojan march and
another Zachik one-pointer ended
the scoring.
Bob Price, sophomore quarter
back. came into the game as the
Cards final signal caller and he
completed a 12-yarder to Wylie
before time ran out.

OUT FROM UNDER
Trojan quarterback Nelson spilled by three Tribe defenders
A resurgence of Stanford spirit swept through the stadium, over
flowed onto he field and caught up the Indian eleven as they out
charged and outplayed the heavily favored Southern California
Trojans for most of the game Saturday afternoon.
Even the fact that the Cards lost by a 21-6 count to remain win-

less for tho season failed to dim
the Homecoming enthusiasm of
some 30,000 fans. A leaky sieve
secondary that has plagued the
Indians all year was plugged and
the vaunted Trojans could get
only two of their three TD's
against the Farm squad's de
fenses, both of these mainly on
short, grind-'em-out techniques.
RETURNING to the ranks of
the civilized, the Stanford rooting
section displayed one of its best
performances and Dick Norman,
ace Card quarterback, supple
mented with a 15-pass comple
tions in 27 attempts record on the
football field.
Stanford was right up with the
Trojans, accumulating 13 first
downs to the winner's 17 and
gaining 218 yards, 129 on Nor
man's passing, to 282 for SC.
Gil Dowd picked up 39 yards to
lead the Stanford rushers while
sophomores Stan Lindskog and
C. B. Simons starred on defense.
Lindskog was a vital cog in a
pass defense that limited Troy
to one completion and Simons
led both teams with ten tackles
and he twice threw opposing
backs for big losses.
FOR TIIE FIRST three plays
Stanford did well enough. After
taking tho opening kickoff back
to their own 27 yard line, the
Cards picked up a first down on
a completed pass and two runs.
Then Dick Norman faded back
and passed to Mac Wylie in the
right flat. Wylie juggled the ball,
it flew into the air and cagy vet
eran Jerry Trayman was right
there to pick it off and continue
unhampered the remaining 35
yards to the end zone. Don Zachik,
a 5-8, 155-pound. 26-year-old,
kicked iho extra point and SC had
a 7-0 lead with just a little 1 over
two minutes of the ball game
gone.
It began to look like a big loss
and that feeling was intensified
later in the first quarter.
STANFORD took over after the
first Troy score and marched 40
yards before they stalled on the
visitors' 34. From there SC reeled
off a series of long gains to move
the required 66 yards for another
six points in 13 plays. Hal Tobin
put the finishing touches on the
effort by charging from the Stan
ford two. and then charging again
after he was temporarily stopped
for the score. It was Zachik again
and a discouraging 1M) on the
scoreboard.
This could have been a rerun
of the San Jose game but the de
fense toughened and Stanford
slowly began to fight back. In the
■second quarter the Cards couldn't
gain the momentum to make a
serious threat but they allowed
SC just one penetration into the
Farm territory and on that oc
casion Simons came bursting
through the line, throwing Bil
Nelson for a loss and recovering
the ensuing fumble.
Senior guard Don Peter showed
more of the Big Red desire as he
recovered a fumble on SC's first
play from scrimmage in the sec
ond half and Curtice's charges
had possession on the enemy 29
yard marker.
TWO RUNS accounted for
eight of the 29. and then Norman
passed to sophomore end Steve
Pursell who ran like nothing but
the end zone was good enough
for him. Ho was finally brought
down half a yard short and it took
Hal Steuber to hit paydirt. Sud
denly Stanford was back in the
ball game and the rooters yelled
for a two-point extra. The try, a
run by Skip Face around the right
side, failed, and it was a nice,
cozy 14-6 with almost half the
ball game still to be played.
Southern Cal failed to get past
the midfield stripe during the en
tire third quarter while the In
dians raised hopes again by run
ning and passing to a first and
len on the south lander's 13. Coach
John McKay's gridders tightened
their bolts, however, and the
Farm did nothing but waste time
as Face's field goal attempt from
the 27 went wide.
Threatening thrice and scoring
once. USC made the final seven
points after three forth-stanza
forays into Indian territory.
ON Till: FIRST drive, the
locals held Troy on downs at the
Stanford 29. On the second the vis
itors were forced to punt and Mar-
Jin McKeever booted a high,
spiraling kick that hit on about
the ten, bounced, rolled and came
to rest in the end zone by the
barest of margins.
Proving again that success
comes in threes, fullback Ben
Wilson smashed over left guard to
cap a 50-yard Trojan march and
another Zachik one-pointer ended
the scoring.
Bob Price, sophomore quarter
back. came into the game as the
Cards final signal caller and he
completed a 12-yarder to Wylie
before time ran out.

OUT FROM UNDER
Trojan quarterback Nelson spilled by three Tribe defenders
A resurgence of Stanford spirit swept through the stadium, over
flowed onto he field and caught up the Indian eleven as they out
charged and outplayed the heavily favored Southern California
Trojans for most of the game Saturday afternoon.
Even the fact that the Cards lost by a 21-6 count to remain win-

less for tho season failed to dim
the Homecoming enthusiasm of
some 30,000 fans. A leaky sieve
secondary that has plagued the
Indians all year was plugged and
the vaunted Trojans could get
only two of their three TD's
against the Farm squad's de
fenses, both of these mainly on
short, grind-'em-out techniques.
RETURNING to the ranks of
the civilized, the Stanford rooting
section displayed one of its best
performances and Dick Norman,
ace Card quarterback, supple
mented with a 15-pass comple
tions in 27 attempts record on the
football field.
Stanford was right up with the
Trojans, accumulating 13 first
downs to the winner's 17 and
gaining 218 yards, 129 on Nor
man's passing, to 282 for SC.
Gil Dowd picked up 39 yards to
lead the Stanford rushers while
sophomores Stan Lindskog and
C. B. Simons starred on defense.
Lindskog was a vital cog in a
pass defense that limited Troy
to one completion and Simons
led both teams with ten tackles
and he twice threw opposing
backs for big losses.
FOR TIIE FIRST three plays
Stanford did well enough. After
taking tho opening kickoff back
to their own 27 yard line, the
Cards picked up a first down on
a completed pass and two runs.
Then Dick Norman faded back
and passed to Mac Wylie in the
right flat. Wylie juggled the ball,
it flew into the air and cagy vet
eran Jerry Trayman was right
there to pick it off and continue
unhampered the remaining 35
yards to the end zone. Don Zachik,
a 5-8, 155-pound. 26-year-old,
kicked iho extra point and SC had
a 7-0 lead with just a little 1 over
two minutes of the ball game
gone.
It began to look like a big loss
and that feeling was intensified
later in the first quarter.
STANFORD took over after the
first Troy score and marched 40
yards before they stalled on the
visitors' 34. From there SC reeled
off a series of long gains to move
the required 66 yards for another
six points in 13 plays. Hal Tobin
put the finishing touches on the
effort by charging from the Stan
ford two. and then charging again
after he was temporarily stopped
for the score. It was Zachik again
and a discouraging 1M) on the
scoreboard.
This could have been a rerun
of the San Jose game but the de
fense toughened and Stanford
slowly began to fight back. In the
■second quarter the Cards couldn't
gain the momentum to make a
serious threat but they allowed
SC just one penetration into the
Farm territory and on that oc
casion Simons came bursting
through the line, throwing Bil
Nelson for a loss and recovering
the ensuing fumble.
Senior guard Don Peter showed
more of the Big Red desire as he
recovered a fumble on SC's first
play from scrimmage in the sec
ond half and Curtice's charges
had possession on the enemy 29
yard marker.
TWO RUNS accounted for
eight of the 29. and then Norman
passed to sophomore end Steve
Pursell who ran like nothing but
the end zone was good enough
for him. Ho was finally brought
down half a yard short and it took
Hal Steuber to hit paydirt. Sud
denly Stanford was back in the
ball game and the rooters yelled
for a two-point extra. The try, a
run by Skip Face around the right
side, failed, and it was a nice,
cozy 14-6 with almost half the
ball game still to be played.
Southern Cal failed to get past
the midfield stripe during the en
tire third quarter while the In
dians raised hopes again by run
ning and passing to a first and
len on the south lander's 13. Coach
John McKay's gridders tightened
their bolts, however, and the
Farm did nothing but waste time
as Face's field goal attempt from
the 27 went wide.
Threatening thrice and scoring
once. USC made the final seven
points after three forth-stanza
forays into Indian territory.
ON Till: FIRST drive, the
locals held Troy on downs at the
Stanford 29. On the second the vis
itors were forced to punt and Mar-
Jin McKeever booted a high,
spiraling kick that hit on about
the ten, bounced, rolled and came
to rest in the end zone by the
barest of margins.
Proving again that success
comes in threes, fullback Ben
Wilson smashed over left guard to
cap a 50-yard Trojan march and
another Zachik one-pointer ended
the scoring.
Bob Price, sophomore quarter
back. came into the game as the
Cards final signal caller and he
completed a 12-yarder to Wylie
