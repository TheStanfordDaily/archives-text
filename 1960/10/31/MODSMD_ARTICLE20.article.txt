### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford's undefeated soccer
team eased into its fifth consecu
tive victory Saturday over sur
prisingly tough San Francisco
Sliite 6-2. The victory left Stan
ford all alone atop conference
standings with a 4-0 record.
The Gators actually outplayed
Stanford throughout most of the
game, despite the fact that Stan
ford never trailed. High-scoring
Emmanuel Andah opened the
scoring in the first ten minutes
of the game when he sneaked
behind the G a t o r defense and
plunked the hall into the net past
the frantic dive of the goalie.
ANOTHER GOAL in the second
quarter put Stanford into a 2-0
lead. Andah had shot, but the
goalie made a good save, losing
the ball off his fingers, and Dick
Bart lett bounced the ball off his
head into the goal.
Only minutes later San Fran
cisco State came within one goal,
but Andah fielded a long pass
down the middle and repeated his
first quarter heroics with only
five minutes to go in the half.
San Francisco managed to mount
an offensive and drove the ball
downfield to score only seconds

before the half-time gun, making
the score 3-2 favoring Stanford.
IN THE FIRST half Stanford
had been out-hustled and out
played, and if Andah hadn't kept
his shooting eye, the Indians
would have been outscored, too.
Without a doubt, the breaks had
been against the Indians in the
first half. Two top first-stringers,
Mike Tippet t and Jan Achenbach,
couldn't even suit up due to in
juries, forcing Stanford coach
Fred Priddle to use a makeshift
lineup th a 1 was not at top
strength.
STANFORD CLOSED out the
scoring with a minute left in the
game when Bernie Knaggs, who
must be one of the highest scor
ing defensive backs anywhere,
too Adam Bianchi's corner kick
and shot the ball under the
goalie's dive, leaving the score at
the final 0-2.
In junior varsity action, Stan
ford also captured its fifth
straight, defeating San Francisco

State 3-1. The Gator goal was the
first scored against Stanford this
year. Indian scoring was done by
Bob Cormack on a penalty kick
and a goal from the field, and
John Whitely.

game when Bernie Knaggs, who
must be one of the highest scor
ing defensive backs anywhere,
too Adam Bianchi's corner kick
and shot the ball under the
goalie's dive, leaving the score at
the final 0-2.
In junior varsity action, Stan
ford also captured its fifth
straight, defeating San Francisco

State 3-1. The Gator goal was the
first scored against Stanford this
year. Indian scoring was done by
Bob Cormack on a penalty kick
and a goal from the field, and
John Whitely.
Stanford's undefeated soccer
team eased into its fifth consecu
tive victory Saturday over sur
prisingly tough San Francisco
Sliite 6-2. The victory left Stan
ford all alone atop conference
standings with a 4-0 record.
The Gators actually outplayed
Stanford throughout most of the
game, despite the fact that Stan
ford never trailed. High-scoring
Emmanuel Andah opened the
scoring in the first ten minutes
of the game when he sneaked
behind the G a t o r defense and
plunked the hall into the net past
the frantic dive of the goalie.
ANOTHER GOAL in the second
quarter put Stanford into a 2-0
lead. Andah had shot, but the
goalie made a good save, losing
the ball off his fingers, and Dick
Bart lett bounced the ball off his
head into the goal.
Only minutes later San Fran
cisco State came within one goal,
but Andah fielded a long pass
down the middle and repeated his
first quarter heroics with only
five minutes to go in the half.
San Francisco managed to mount
an offensive and drove the ball
downfield to score only seconds

before the half-time gun, making
the score 3-2 favoring Stanford.
IN THE FIRST half Stanford
had been out-hustled and out
played, and if Andah hadn't kept
his shooting eye, the Indians
would have been outscored, too.
Without a doubt, the breaks had
been against the Indians in the
first half. Two top first-stringers,
Mike Tippet t and Jan Achenbach,
couldn't even suit up due to in
juries, forcing Stanford coach
Fred Priddle to use a makeshift
lineup th a 1 was not at top
strength.
STANFORD CLOSED out the
scoring with a minute left in the
game when Bernie Knaggs, who

ing defensive backs anywhere,

and shot the ball under the
goalie's dive, leaving the score at
the final 0-2.
