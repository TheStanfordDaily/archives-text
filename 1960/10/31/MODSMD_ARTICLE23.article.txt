# Cuba Invasion Charges Due For Hearing
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS. N.Y. (UPI>
j Cuba's charge that the United
i States plans an invasion against
Fidel Castro's regi me and is
hat eli in g a faked incident at
Guantanamo Naval Base comes
up in the United Nations General
Assembly today.
There was some speculation
I that Castro might fly here for
today's debate, but Cuban sources
j said they knew nothing about any
| such plans. Cuban Foreign Min
j ister Raul Roa was preparing to
I argue Cuba's case himself.
The General Assembly will
meet to consider its steering com
mittee's recommendation that the
item be placed on the agenda and
I sent to the 99-nation political com
! mittee for preliminary debate
later in the session.
DESPITE this parliamentary
nicety, the entire issue was ex
pected to be aired when the world
parliament meets to decide the
procedure for taking up the item.
Cuba's Roa told the 20-nation
steering committee last week that
a U.S.-backed invasion could be
expected "at any hour." He also
I charged that the "U.S. govern
ment at this very moment" was
preparing to stage an incident at
the huge navy base at Guanta
namo Bay which Castro has
threatened to take over in con
nection with the U.S. election
campaign.
KOA accused both Vice Presi
dent Richard M. Nixon and Sen.
John F. Kennedy of using Cuba
as a "scapegoat" in their cam
paigns and of advocating "crude,
imperialistic" measures against
I Castro's government.
The assembly will start today's
discussions with debate on the
Austro-Italian dispute concerning
the German-speaking minority in
the South Tyrol. The special po
litical committee last week rec
ommended renewed negotiations
between Austria and Italy on the
; issue.
