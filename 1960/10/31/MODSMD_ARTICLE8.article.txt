# MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING' REVIEW
## Shakespeare Would Be Pleased With Stanford's Lavish Production 
### MARY LOU McKINLEY Associate Editor 
If Will Shakespeare had been
j sitting in Memorial Auditorium
Friday night he would have been
| pleased. While transplanted to
i Nineteenth-Century Vienna, with
several appropriate changes of
names and phrases, his sparkling
comedy "Much Ado About Noth
j ing" was skillfully presented by
the Stanford Players.
C on t in u in g this Thursday
through Saturday nights, the
Players' production is directed hy
James ls'erans whose imaginative
use of stairs and levels (designed
by Wendell Cole) keeps the scenes
full of interesting action.
THE KOl i: of the independent
and jesting Benedick is well done
by Eugene Peyroux whose good
variety of speech, timing and feel
ing for the pari produce a real
and self-assured character.
JoAnne Akalaitis succeeds in
j portraying Beatrice as a witty

I but charming woman. Her move
[ments are graceful and her ap
pearance lovely. At limes, how
ever, her characterization, while
always gay and lighthoarted,
lacks some of the warmth which
| could have made her role a truly
i outstanding one.
With perception and depth plus
a fine voice. John Owen does an
; excellent job as Prince Peter. An
j other good characterization is
'given by Michael Addison as
I Count Lconatov.
The mild lovers Claudius and
Hero are also well played. Doug
las Johnson portrayed Claudius
with appropriate reserve and is a
perfect suitor to the equally
proper Hero, gracefully played by
Louise Carter.
SHAKESPEARE'S words are
capably handled by Philip Ange
loff as Prince John. The charac
terization ot this villain reaches
melodramatic pr op or t i on s at
times however, his villainy

I should be apparent, without ;i long
I cigar and Hitlerian moustache.
Angeloff also plays the comic
| Second Watch an ama/ in g
change of character, skillfully
l accomplished.
The constable Dogberry is por-!
I trayed by Ronald Feinberg. While j
' hilarious in parts, the scenes with
; him and his inept watch border
on the slapstick too frequently.
| Too many minor bits of comedy [
are attempted and distract from
the main business, which is funny
enough in itself.
SOMi; LINKS which deserve to
be played lip arc 1 lost in these
sconces a loss which is felt
throughout the production when
ever the stage "business" over
powers the words.
Tickets for the three produc
tions scheduled for this week are
