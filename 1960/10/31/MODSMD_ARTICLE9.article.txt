### 
"The Independent Californian
I will begin its second week of
t publication tomorrow with a let
! tor-press printed edition, and will
start subscription sales this
week." editorial staffer Joan
Duren said yesterday.
The new format, which replaces
, the difficult, inconvenient offset
printed method last week, will
provide room for solicited adver
tising and more complete news
coverage.
"YVK'RK STILL hoping for ar
| bit ration with the ASUC admin
istration," she added, in regard
to 11 return to the former policies
governing the official Cal news
paper, the Daily Californian. The
! Daily Cal is setting up a perma
nent staff from the volunteers
who took over its publication last
Monday when the present staff
of the Independent Cal walked
j out.
