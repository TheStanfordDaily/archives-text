QUESTION*: JuM how good lire ihe STANFORD CRF.W CUT KINGS?
ANSWFR: Plenty l,'<>od, and here's all tlie writ ten prool you'll ever want.
In August Hi") Charlie and Mike lclt Stanford to start our own off-campus barber shops at
ID", California Avenue, South Palo Alto. We knew that to get the Stanford men oil the campus
to come to see us we realh had to go and go we did. We staged one of the biggest advertising
campaigns in barber history. We spent thousands in all kinds of advertising ol which some ol
you oldtimcrs still remember.
We also knew that our work had to be the finest and the best, to get them back again! Our
barbets had to be the best. We had to pay over the union scale. Stanford men we tiwui over
board for you. Whenever we hired a barber that was not sure ol his work. I personally directed
his work and showed h;im the wax to become one ol the S I \NFORI) CRFW CI " 1 KINGS.
With Stanford's support we grew from two c hairs to seven c hairs in seven months and to ten
and eleven barbers within a year later. A feat as yet unparalleled in barber history.
Our business was so good, our work so fine that local barbers would drive by to look in and
gape at what thc\ thoi&ght was the monster of California Avenue.
In August !<)">(> I w;r > s approached b\ the I 11 ion Secret arv and asked if I would (for the good
of the barber profession) demonstrate (at a mass meeting) to the local barbers ni\ skills and
methods on how I do tlte "Stanford Crew Cut." I did this. I gave a local barber a Stanford Crew
Cut at the Union tlall in front of a large group ol Local Barbers.
Relieve me Stanford men, this was not easy to do. Barbers are ver\ independent and proud
of their work. Yet I was so sure ol my Stanford Crew Cuts that I took the challenge and gave the
perfect crew cut in front ol them all. 1 his was my greatest moment, from that da\ 011 the local
barbers had great respect for the mighty S FAN FORI) CRFW Cl' I KINGS.

QUESTION*: JuM how good lire ihe STANFORD CRF.W CUT KINGS?
ANSWFR: Plenty l,'<>od, and here's all tlie writ ten prool you'll ever want.
In August Hi") Charlie and Mike lclt Stanford to start our own off-campus barber shops at
ID", California Avenue, South Palo Alto. We knew that to get the Stanford men oil the campus
to come to see us we realh had to go and go we did. We staged one of the biggest advertising
campaigns in barber history. We spent thousands in all kinds of advertising ol which some ol
you oldtimcrs still remember.
We also knew that our work had to be the finest and the best, to get them back again! Our
barbets had to be the best. We had to pay over the union scale. Stanford men we tiwui over
board for you. Whenever we hired a barber that was not sure ol his work. I personally directed
his work and showed h;im the wax to become one ol the S I \NFORI) CRFW CI " 1 KINGS.
With Stanford's support we grew from two c hairs to seven c hairs in seven months and to ten
and eleven barbers within a year later. A feat as yet unparalleled in barber history.
Our business was so good, our work so fine that local barbers would drive by to look in and
gape at what thc\ thoi&ght was the monster of California Avenue.
In August !<)">(> I w;r > s approached b\ the I 11 ion Secret arv and asked if I would (for the good
of the barber profession) demonstrate (at a mass meeting) to the local barbers ni\ skills and
methods on how I do tlte "Stanford Crew Cut." I did this. I gave a local barber a Stanford Crew
Cut at the Union tlall in front of a large group ol Local Barbers.
Relieve me Stanford men, this was not easy to do. Barbers are ver\ independent and proud
of their work. Yet I was so sure ol my Stanford Crew Cuts that I took the challenge and gave the
perfect crew cut in front ol them all. 1 his was my greatest moment, from that da\ 011 the local
barbers had great respect for the mighty S FAN FORI) CRFW Cl' I KINGS.
Now Stanford men this great experience has been passed on to our men. Yes. tliev are top
men; and the best barbers in this business. II \ou'rc going to pa\ 52.00 lor a haircut, C.I I
