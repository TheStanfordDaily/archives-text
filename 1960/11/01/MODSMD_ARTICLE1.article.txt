# 'Beat Cal' Hung on World's Most Famous Campanile
## 
### JUDY SKLAR 
PISA. Italy, Oct. 22 (Special to The Daily I Forty
five fearless Stanford students today invaded this
town, ascended its Loaning Tower, and told the world
in six and one-half foot letters to "Beat Cal."
Clad as tourists, the group from the Stanford Over
seas Study Center in Florence hung an 80-foot-long
banner with the red letters "Beat Cal" on it from the
world's most famous Campanile.
The coup d'etat in the infamous Stanford-Cali
fornia rivalry was termed "tutto tempo" by awed
Italian onlookers.
THK MOVE came as a complete surprise to the
genuine tourists both on and around the tower, in the
Piazza del Duomo, but especially to the tower guards
who were taken entirely unawares.
It was not until after pairs of students had been
lined up on each of the tower's six levels and ropes
had started to be lowered that the guard stationed
100 feet from the tower base noticed anything pe
culiar.
He was quickly pacified by Bill Reppy. one of the
diversionary force posted as part of a guided tour of
the tower, who explained that the ropes were to meas
ure the 180-foot structure.
Other guards were alarmed when the ropes

reached the ground and were secured there, and they
started screaming "Alto!" (take the ropes up). Quick
thinking students Tony Komaroff and Stafford Smith
pulling on the ropes answered merely "grazie,"
"prego" (thank you, you're welcome) and continued
to pull while the guards continued to shout.
FINALLY the guard at the tower entrance ran to
the police station across the road—the Leaning Tower
is in the center of Pisa and called an officer.
However, by this time the banner extending al
most half the length of the tower had been lowered in
full view of a bus of passing tourists, the 70 tourists
in the area •surrounding the tower, horse-carts and
priests who frequent the vicinity, Stanford students
gleefully snapping pictures, and the enraged guards.
Making sure that there was ample time for photo
graphs, the students then pulled the banner back up
to the top.
The policeman accosted the guide-in disguise, Lee
Shershow, head of the ground diversionary tactics
committee, and demanded an explanation. When the
guard understood the nature of the sign, which he had
thought was political, Italian elections being Nov. 6,
he too declared the mar.uever "tutto tempo" and de
manded that California be vanquished.
FOR THIS record, he requested an explanation

made in the police books and in the registry of the
Leaning Tower, plus the solemn promise that the next
time students hung a banner they would ask
permission.
The banner was smuggled up to the top of the
tower in a suitcase by Pete Jurney, the two 200-foot
ropes inside the coats of students Trina Johnson and
John Huber. They were lowered by four people.
Jurney, Huber, Dave Steinhart and Skip Matthews.
There was another group of divertors for the guard
at the top and for the curious tourists who thought
someone was going to scale the tower. A pair of stu
dents secured both banner and ropes at each level.
A BUS carrying 38 Stanfordites arrived in Pisa at 2
p.m., and they were joined shortly thereafter by six
who came by car and one who hiked the distance from
Florence to Pisa in three and one-half hours.
"Operation Tower" was completed successfully in
bright sunlight by 3:30 p.m.
The Lean Pi Tow Com idea was originally con
ceived by the Rally Commission and Olivia Barclay,
a junior, before she left Stanford last year, and was
arrived at independently several weeks ago by Ken
Bishop, president of the Florence Center.
The banner itself, the product of 12 hours of paint
ing and blocking, was prepared by Penny Ingram on
the hall floor of the Villa in Florence.
