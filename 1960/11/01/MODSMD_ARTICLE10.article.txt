## 
### 
TOLEDO, Ohio (UPI) — The Federal Aviation Agency yesterday
suspended for "gross disregard for public safety" the operating
license of Arctic Pacific Airlines, owner of a two-engine C-46 piano
that crashed on takeoff in a fog here Saturday night, killing 22
persons, including half a college football team.
The football players were students of California Polytechnic

College of San Luis Obispo who
were en route home after losing
a game. 50-6, against Bowling
Green State University. Twenty
six others in the plane survived.
James Springer, Arctic Pacific
president, said "pressures might
have been brought to bear" on E.
R. Quesada, FFA administrator
who suspended the airline's oper
ating certificate.
HE SAID the FA A had failed to
take such action in the recent
crashes of Lockheed Eleetras.
But, Springer said, Quesada "saw
fit to take action in this instance
without regard to what it would
do to a small unsubsidized air
line."
The FAA statement announcing
the suspension said: "The circum
stances revealed to date surround
ing the tragic accident . . . indi
cate a gross disregard for public
safety and the regulations of the
Federal Aviation Agency."
Springer declined to speculate
on what the "disregard for pub
lic safety" meant, other than it
might have applied to the pilot's
j decision to take off.
j The crash was the first in the
| 14-year history of Arctic Pacific,
| Springer said.
UK SAID the plane was
equipped with normal weather
instruments, but did not have
radar "although that was not a
factor" in the crash. The plane re
ceived its last routine flight check
aobut 20 hours before the fatal
takeoff, he added.
In San Luis Obispo yesterday
an overflow crowd of 4.000 stu
dents and townspeople, many of
them crying, attended memorial
j services in the Cal Poly gymna
sium honoring members of the
football team killed in the crash.
THK SKKVICKS were brief, in
cluding short prayers by a Prot
estant and Roman Catholic, the
singing of the Lord's Prayer and
a moment of silence.
"As we are gathered here to
offer prayer to those who lost
their lives in this tragic plane
crash, let us not forget to offer
our prayers to those still in the
hospital," said college Vice Pres
ident Robert Kennedy in opening
the services.
The shocked college and the
bereaved town they grew up to
gether made plans for the me
morial Sunday after canceling
homecoming celebrations t ha I
were scheduled for this weekend.
The mayor of the costal town
of 20,000, Fred M. Waters, pro
claimed the whole week a time of
sorrow and asked that all flags
be flown at half mast. ,

TOLEDO, Ohio (UPI) — The Federal Aviation Agency yesterday
suspended for "gross disregard for public safety" the operating
license of Arctic Pacific Airlines, owner of a two-engine C-46 piano
that crashed on takeoff in a fog here Saturday night, killing 22
persons, including half a college football team.
The football players were students of California Polytechnic

College of San Luis Obispo who
were en route home after losing
a game. 50-6, against Bowling
Green State University. Twenty
six others in the plane survived.
James Springer, Arctic Pacific
president, said "pressures might
have been brought to bear" on E.
R. Quesada, FFA administrator
who suspended the airline's oper
ating certificate.
HE SAID the FA A had failed to
take such action in the recent
crashes of Lockheed Eleetras.
But, Springer said, Quesada "saw
fit to take action in this instance
without regard to what it would
do to a small unsubsidized air
line."

the suspension said: "The circum
