# Not An Issue
## 
### 
It is unfortunate that the action of three Catholic bishops in
Puerto Rico precedes so closely the United States presidential
election.
The existence of the Catholic issue in the political campaign,
although rejected by leaders of both parties, nonetheless is ex
pected to exert some influence in the voting. Ihe circumstances
of the last week in Puerto Rico are certain to confuse and irritate
this issue even further.
The three bishops revealed a pastoral letter forbidding Cath
olics to vote for the Popular Democratic party of Gov. Munoz
Marin because of his advocacy of birth control measures, tolerance
of common law marriages, and his refusal to allow religious in
struction in the public schools.
This edict has resulted in a number of protests against the
bishops from Catholics (including Gov. Marin) as well as non-
Catholics, although some church leaders have expressed a belief
that ignoring the letter would not be a sin. However, on Saturday
one of the diocese chancellors in Puerto Rico said that any Catholic
who supports the Popular Democrats "not only commits a mortal
sin but could be excommunicated, according to Catholic canon
law."
In issuing such a warning, the leaders of the Catholic Church
in Puerto Rico have exceeded their duties and have done the
Church a great disservice. Although churchmen can certainly play
an advisory role to their flocks, the use of a threat of such serious
proportions in the political field clearly violates the principle ol
separation of church and state.
It is to be hoped that the American voter will ignore this breach
of church-state relations in Puerto Rico, for it is of no concern in
the politics of this country.
First of all, Puerto Rico does not vote in the presidential elec
tion: politics in that country tend to he hotter than here; and
with the near-by influence of Castro, the situation is much more
conducive to the existence of church-state conflicts than in the U.S.
Rut more important, however, is that the only religious ques
tion which should enter the presidential campaign is to what ex
tent either candidate would follow the tenets of his church in
making decisions.
Senator Kennedy has said time and time again that if he were
President, national interests would always rank above church in
terests. it cannot be stated more plainly than that. Anyone who
claims that Mr. Kennedy would sell out his country for the benefit
of the Catholic Church is not only refuting the Senator's honesty
but is slandering him.
\\ e hope that the American voters are mature enough on No
vember ft to exclude religious considerations from their decisions,
no matter for whom they vote. It is as prejudiced to vote for a
man because he is a Catholic as it is to vote against him for the
same reason.
There are many important issues worthy of consideration in
this campaign. Upon these issues may rest the fate of the U.S.
in the next decade and century. To allow religious prejudice to
endanger our future security and prosperity is unwise and un
worthy of this countrv.
