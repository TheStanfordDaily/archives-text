# Some More Trouble?
## 
### DAVE FRENCH IIR Political Analyst 
Recent rioting and wholesale
arrests in the Central African
Federation of Rhodesia and
Nyasaland are merely surface in
dications of a troubled situation
which within months may bring
toppling down a great experiment
in race relations. The implications
for the continent as a whole are
as grave as those offered by riot
ing in the Congo.
To be sure, legitimate grievances
exist on both sides. The Africans
justly resent Southern Rhodesian
pass laws, the existence of dis
crimination in local government
as well as public services and in
dustry, and other indications of
white supremacy. Europeans, one
eye on the Congo, feel a natural
anxiety about too-rapid strides to
ward the "one man, one vote"
goal of the Africans. In such a cli
mate, any disturbance is apt to
assume racial overtones, regard
less of its actual cause.
As established in 1953, the Fed
eration was given considerably
more power over the affairs of its
three constituent territories than
Africans were prepared to accept,
especially as this tendency toward
centralization implied the (Mtlitical
primacy of Southern Rhodesia,
close to the Union of South Africa
in spirit as it is in location. The
recently-published conclusions of
the Monckton Commission, if
adopted by the constitutional re
view conference which will meet
in December, would go far toward
assuring Africans that they are
not willfully being denied what
they consider to he their rights.
The key to the Monckton report
is the provision granting the right
of secession to the member areas.
II was felt that this would give
Northern Rhodesia and Nyasa
landâ€”territories having respec
tively 30 and 300 Africans to every
European- a means by which
they could force concessions from
the more conservative Southern
Rhodesians. In addition, the re
port recommends the transfer to
the territorial governments of
functions in such areas as health,

education, financial powers, and
agriculture.
As in any attempt to steer a
middle course, however, the re
port is subject to severe attacks
from extremists on both sides.
Sir Edgar Whitehead, Prime Min
ister of Southern Rhodesia, has
already indicated his preference
lor- withdrawal from the Federa
tion if there is any indication that
his area's interests are in jeop
ardy. And the minority report
submitted by two of the five Afri
can members of the Monckton
Commission suggests that mili
tant nationalist forces would also
prefer the Federation's dissolu
tion to what they consider a con
tinuance of white domination,
tempered though this may be by
the report's provisions.
Economically, dissolution of the
Federation would l>e unfortunate,
as the mineral deposits of the
North, the industry of the South,
and the manpower of Nyasaland
combine to form a total economic
stability greater than the sum of
the parts. Politically, such a rup
ture is to be avoided, as is any
tendency toward Balkanization of
the continent. But beyond this
lies the sobering implication that
neither black nor white is willing
to yield an inch in order jointly
to progress a yard. A noble at
tempt to create a stable multi
racial island in Africa's turbulent
seas threatens to founder, branded
a "misbegotten experiment in im
posed authority."
In an atmosphere as emotional
ly charged as is this, moderate
groups such as the Central Afri
can Party find it exceedingly dif
ficult to convince the combatants
of the need for compromise. Com
munication breaks down, as was
the case this summer when a na
tionalist leader planned to take
to the United Nations the griev
ances which he could nol air in
his own land. And goodwill is
supplanted by hatred and distrust.
We can but hope that December's
review conference finds a more
favorable climate in which to
make its revisions. There is no
evidence to suggest that it will.
