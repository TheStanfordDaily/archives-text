# U.N. Faces Great Crisis
## 
### 
The United Nations is facing a
crisis much greater but less
known than that of Nikita Khru
shchev pounding his shoe on a
table in the General Assembly.
Mr. K., however, is also responsi
ble for the impending emergency.
Communist bloc countries have
refused to pay for their share of
the assessment for the United
Nations Emergency Force in the
Congo, an action matching the
stand Iron Curtain countries took
after U.N. entry into Egypt in
1956.
There is no way, short of force,
which can induce these nations to
pay, although any country two
years in arrears can be deprived
of its vote in the General Assem
bly. Fortunately, the U.N. Charter
does not provide for the anachron
ism of expulsion which existed in
the League Convenant.
The financial crisis hovering
above the U.N. could well destroy
much of the good work of this
organization including the with
drawal of U.N. troops from the
Congo and Egypt and a reduction
in the amount of social and eco
nomic services provided to under
developed countries.
The present annual budget of
the U.N. Is $58,500,000. Estimates
of costs for the Congo operation
run as high as $200,000,000; and
there remains a large deficit ac
cumulated in Egypt. With the re
cent withdrawal of Communist
finances, the situation looks, at
best, glum.
One obvious solution to the
money problems is in increased
contributions by the U.S. to the
U.N. coffers, but this possibility
is distasteful to many taxpayers
in the U.S., and several congress
men have tended to balk at such
an increment.
The United States already pro
vides over a third of the U.N.'s
annual income, whereas the en
tire Communist bloc is supposed
to give approximately one-fifth,
and even places restrictions on
the use of a large percentage of
its funds. Additional U.S. contri
butions, while necessary, hardly
seem fair under these circum
stances.
A novel, and perhaps lifesaving,
solution has been instigated in a
few communities in the U.S. and
Canada by some farsighted, pri
vate citizens. In Princeton, New
Jersey; Urbana-Champaign, Illi
nois; Palo Alto; Seattle, Washing
ton; and Calgary, Canada; groups
of citizens have voluntarily
pledged one per cent of their an
nual income to the U.N.

The money thus collected may
be used by (In* Secretary-General
of the U.N. in three fields: 1. Tech
nical assistance programs to send
trained personnel to underdevel
oped countries; 2. Special funds
to help low income countries de
velop their natural resources; 3.
The Children's Fund to provide
welfare for needy children and
mothers.
The donations of these Self-
Tax groups have so far not been
large, but the funds could easily
assume large proportions as the
idea spreads around this country
and the rest of the world. It may
even be possible that in the fu
ture the U.N. will rely largely and
perhaps even totally on the con
tributions of private citizens.
While the U.N. remains subject
to the caprices and moods of the
major governments, it cannot act
as effectively as it could were ii
freed of the economic reins of
selfish countries.
The greatest, hope for the fu- j
ture of the United Nations lies
not in Mr. Khrushchev's hands
nor in the hands of any one na
tion or bloc of nations. The des
tiny of the U.N. rests with the
millions of |>eople who see i( as
the only means to avert a world
catastrophe and who place their
faith in its success. Many people
in Africa ami other underdevel
oped areas now look to the U.N.,
not to the U.S. or Kussia, for
guidance.
This is a good sign, as is the
voluntary action of the Self-Tax
citizens in the U.S. and Canada, i
Where it will lead cannot be de- 1
termined so early. Some people I
fear that the U.N. is going in the
direction of world government,
and others believe that such a
step is the only way in which o 1
permanent peace can be obtained.
Whatever is destined to be the
role of the U.N. in the future, the
part it plays can be important
and useful only it it reflects the
desires of the world's peoples and
not the whims and avarices of a
few governments.

fear that the U.N. is going in the
direction of world government,
and others believe that such a
step is the only way in which o 1
permanent peace can be obtained.
Whatever is destined to be the
role of the U.N. in the future, the
part it plays can be important
and useful only it it reflects the
desires of the world's peoples and
not the whims and avarices of a
few governments.
The United Nations is facing a
crisis much greater but less
known than that of Nikita Khru
shchev pounding his shoe on a
table in the General Assembly.
Mr. K., however, is also responsi
ble for the impending emergency.
Communist bloc countries have
refused to pay for their share of
the assessment for the United
Nations Emergency Force in the
Congo, an action matching the
stand Iron Curtain countries took
after U.N. entry into Egypt in
1956.
There is no way, short of force,
which can induce these nations to
pay, although any country two
years in arrears can be deprived
of its vote in the General Assem
bly. Fortunately, the U.N. Charter
does not provide for the anachron
ism of expulsion which existed in
the League Convenant.
The financial crisis hovering
above the U.N. could well destroy
much of the good work of this
organization including the with
drawal of U.N. troops from the
Congo and Egypt and a reduction
in the amount of social and eco
nomic services provided to under
developed countries.
The present annual budget of
the U.N. Is $58,500,000. Estimates
of costs for the Congo operation
run as high as $200,000,000; and
there remains a large deficit ac
cumulated in Egypt. With the re
cent withdrawal of Communist
finances, the situation looks, at
best, glum.
One obvious solution to the
money problems is in increased
contributions by the U.S. to the
U.N. coffers, but this possibility
is distasteful to many taxpayers
in the U.S., and several congress
men have tended to balk at such
an increment.
The United States already pro
vides over a third of the U.N.'s
annual income, whereas the en
tire Communist bloc is supposed
to give approximately one-fifth,
and even places restrictions on
the use of a large percentage of
its funds. Additional U.S. contri
butions, while necessary, hardly
seem fair under these circum
stances.
A novel, and perhaps lifesaving,
solution has been instigated in a
few communities in the U.S. and
Canada by some farsighted, pri
vate citizens. In Princeton, New
Jersey; Urbana-Champaign, Illi
nois; Palo Alto; Seattle, Washing
ton; and Calgary, Canada; groups
of citizens have voluntarily
pledged one per cent of their an
nual income to the U.N.

The money thus collected may
be used by (In* Secretary-General
of the U.N. in three fields: 1. Tech
nical assistance programs to send
trained personnel to underdevel
oped countries; 2. Special funds
to help low income countries de
velop their natural resources; 3.
The Children's Fund to provide
welfare for needy children and
mothers.
The donations of these Self-
Tax groups have so far not been
large, but the funds could easily
assume large proportions as the
idea spreads around this country
and the rest of the world. It may
even be possible that in the fu
ture the U.N. will rely largely and
perhaps even totally on the con
tributions of private citizens.
While the U.N. remains subject
to the caprices and moods of the
major governments, it cannot act
as effectively as it could were ii
freed of the economic reins of
selfish countries.
The greatest, hope for the fu- j
ture of the United Nations lies
not in Mr. Khrushchev's hands
nor in the hands of any one na
tion or bloc of nations. The des
tiny of the U.N. rests with the
millions of |>eople who see i( as
the only means to avert a world
catastrophe and who place their
faith in its success. Many people
in Africa ami other underdevel
oped areas now look to the U.N.,
not to the U.S. or Kussia, for
guidance.
This is a good sign, as is the
voluntary action of the Self-Tax
citizens in the U.S. and Canada, i

catastrophe and who place their
faith in its success. Many people
in Africa ami other underdevel
oped areas now look to the U.N.,
not to the U.S. or Kussia, for
guidance.
This is a good sign, as is the
voluntary action of the Self-Tax
citizens in the U.S. and Canada, i
Where it will lead cannot be de- 1
termined so early. Some people I
fear that the U.N. is going in the
direction of world government,
and others believe that such a
step is the only way in which o 1
permanent peace can be obtained.
Whatever is destined to be the
role of the U.N. in the future, the
part it plays can be important
and useful only it it reflects the
desires of the world's peoples and
not the whims and avarices of a
few governments.
The United Nations is facing a
crisis much greater but less
known than that of Nikita Khru
shchev pounding his shoe on a
table in the General Assembly.
Mr. K., however, is also responsi
ble for the impending emergency.
Communist bloc countries have
refused to pay for their share of
the assessment for the United
Nations Emergency Force in the
Congo, an action matching the
stand Iron Curtain countries took
after U.N. entry into Egypt in
1956.
There is no way, short of force,
which can induce these nations to
pay, although any country two
years in arrears can be deprived
of its vote in the General Assem
bly. Fortunately, the U.N. Charter
does not provide for the anachron
ism of expulsion which existed in
the League Convenant.
The financial crisis hovering
above the U.N. could well destroy
much of the good work of this
organization including the with
drawal of U.N. troops from the
Congo and Egypt and a reduction
in the amount of social and eco
nomic services provided to under
developed countries.
The present annual budget of
the U.N. Is $58,500,000. Estimates
of costs for the Congo operation
run as high as $200,000,000; and
there remains a large deficit ac
cumulated in Egypt. With the re
cent withdrawal of Communist
finances, the situation looks, at
best, glum.
One obvious solution to the
money problems is in increased
contributions by the U.S. to the
U.N. coffers, but this possibility
is distasteful to many taxpayers
in the U.S., and several congress
men have tended to balk at such
an increment.
The United States already pro
vides over a third of the U.N.'s
annual income, whereas the en
tire Communist bloc is supposed
to give approximately one-fifth,
and even places restrictions on
the use of a large percentage of
its funds. Additional U.S. contri
butions, while necessary, hardly
seem fair under these circum
stances.
A novel, and perhaps lifesaving,
solution has been instigated in a
few communities in the U.S. and
Canada by some farsighted, pri
vate citizens. In Princeton, New
Jersey; Urbana-Champaign, Illi
nois; Palo Alto; Seattle, Washing
ton; and Calgary, Canada; groups
of citizens have voluntarily
pledged one per cent of their an
nual income to the U.N.

The money thus collected may
be used by (In* Secretary-General
of the U.N. in three fields: 1. Tech
nical assistance programs to send
trained personnel to underdevel
oped countries; 2. Special funds
to help low income countries de
velop their natural resources; 3.
The Children's Fund to provide
welfare for needy children and
mothers.
The donations of these Self-
Tax groups have so far not been
large, but the funds could easily
assume large proportions as the
idea spreads around this country
and the rest of the world. It may
even be possible that in the fu
ture the U.N. will rely largely and
perhaps even totally on the con
tributions of private citizens.
While the U.N. remains subject
to the caprices and moods of the
major governments, it cannot act
as effectively as it could were ii
freed of the economic reins of
selfish countries.
The greatest, hope for the fu- j
ture of the United Nations lies
not in Mr. Khrushchev's hands
nor in the hands of any one na
tion or bloc of nations. The des
tiny of the U.N. rests with the
millions of |>eople who see i( as
the only means to avert a world
catastrophe and who place their
faith in its success. Many people
