Editor, the Daily:
The Fall Legislative elections
are here again and we must nec
essarily trudge to the polls to do
our duty. That this is our duty is
oft expressed in the current pres
idential campaign. We might well
take heed for sometimes the only
voice we have in our student gov
ernment is our voice on election
day.
It is with a small voice that 1
say that last year's representative
from the Graduate School of En
gineering was elected by less
than a dozen persons out of about
1,000 possible students. With four
candidates this year there is cer
tainly a need to make a choice
and to have some voice.

Editor, the Daily:
Mr. Bizzell's belief that "social
ism leads to communism" floes
not square with the facts. No na
tion that has adopted democratic
socialist reforms has gone Com
munist. Every country that has
become Communist (with the pos
sible exception of Czechoslo
vakia) formerly suffered under a
reactionary regime.
Moral (1 >: A humane approach
to social problems is the host anti
dote to communism. Moral (2):
Reactionary capitalism leads to
regimentation from within or
without.
George Guy
