Editor, the Daily:
In this momentous campaign
for head yell leader, there are
those who have said that Stanford
has slipped in the last several
years. Now, let's set the record
straight. We do not doubt the sin
cerity of these men and that they
have Stanford's best interests at
heart. But we can only say that to
accept their views would be a
tragic mistake. That's not the way
to build Stanford up by running
her down.
The truth is that our team has
never been stronger. But we must
not ever, ever be satisfied. Our
record is one to build on, not to
stand on.
Some refuse to see what's right
about Stanford. But as Hike said
to us last Saturday, though we
have not been successful on the
scoreboard, we have won on the
field and in the stands. We should
have confidence in the words of
a man who has restored dignity
and respect to his office.
The great problem facing Stan
ford today is that of defending
the goalposts of freedom. In deal
ing with our enemies, we must
understand that they will not
stop at these two goalposts. These
few slivers of wood are not im
portant, but, as a matter of prin
ciple, we must never surrender
one inch of the Stanford world.
Those who disagree, those who
run Stanford down, are guilty of
the worst kind of wooly thinking.
We sincerely hope that they will
change their opinions because
only then can we move forward
to win this great struggle for the
minds and hearts and souls of
men.

Editor, the Daily:
I am great fill for your editorial
on Thomas Dewey's speech here

at Stanford last Tuesday. We are
fortunate to have been able to
see and hear the two men (Mr.
Dewey and Chester Bowles), one
of whom will very likely be the
next Secretary of State, depend
ing on which party wins in No
vember.
But after hearing both men, it
is hard to avoid having fervent
wishes about which one of them
will help determine American for
eign policy and will represent this
country abroad as our highest
diplomat.
In your editorial you said, re
ferring to Dewey's speech, "It
is true that there were many
more dictatorships in the world
at the beginning of the Republi
can administration than there are
now . .." Mr. Nixon has, of course,
also made this claim on the TV
debates.
I agree with your judgment of
these facts as alleged yardsticks
of Communist success, but you
might also have raised what
seems to me the crucial question
at this point: what role, if any.

did the Republican administration
have in this reduction of the num
ber of dictatorships?
I think it had none at all. In
fact, 1 think it is correct to say
land I invite correction if I'm
wrong) that the present admin
istration actually supported many
of these governments, hut never
the revolutions which overthrew
them. Certainly this is true of
South America! And if so, Mr.
Nixon and Mr. Dewey are flatly
wrong in claiming, by implica
tion, credit for the Republican
administration for the reduction
of the number of dictatorships in
the world.

I think it had none at all. In
fact, 1 think it is correct to say

istration actually supported many
of these governments, hut never
the revolutions which overthrew
them. Certainly this is true of
South America! And if so, Mr.

Editor, the Daily:
In this momentous campaign
for head yell leader, there are
those who have said that Stanford
has slipped in the last several
years. Now, let's set the record
straight. We do not doubt the sin
cerity of these men and that they
have Stanford's best interests at
heart. But we can only say that to
accept their views would be a
tragic mistake. That's not the way
to build Stanford up by running
her down.
The truth is that our team has
never been stronger. But we must
not ever, ever be satisfied. Our
record is one to build on, not to
stand on.
Some refuse to see what's right
about Stanford. But as Hike said
to us last Saturday, though we
have not been successful on the
scoreboard, we have won on the
field and in the stands. We should
have confidence in the words of
a man who has restored dignity
and respect to his office.
The great problem facing Stan
ford today is that of defending
the goalposts of freedom. In deal
ing with our enemies, we must
understand that they will not
stop at these two goalposts. These
few slivers of wood are not im
portant, but, as a matter of prin
ciple, we must never surrender
one inch of the Stanford world.
Those who disagree, those who
run Stanford down, are guilty of
the worst kind of wooly thinking.
We sincerely hope that they will
change their opinions because
only then can we move forward
to win this great struggle for the
minds and hearts and souls of
men.

I am great fill for your editorial

at Stanford last Tuesday. We are
fortunate to have been able to
see and hear the two men (Mr.
Dewey and Chester Bowles), one
of whom will very likely be the
next Secretary of State, depend

But after hearing both men, it
is hard to avoid having fervent
wishes about which one of them
will help determine American for

country abroad as our highest
diplomat.
