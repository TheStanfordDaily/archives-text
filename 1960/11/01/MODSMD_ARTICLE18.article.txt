# EXTRA POINT FAILS
## Papooses Nipped By Troy Frosh, 28-26 Daily Sports 
### 
Stanford's Frosh footballers almost made it three deadlocks in a
row Saturday. A fourth-quarter touchdown brought the Papooses
to within two points ol USC's Trobabes but an alert pass defense
tipped Steve Thurlow's extra point attempt away from intended
receiver Frank Patitucci and preserved the 28-26 Trojan win.

Fullback Mike Barnes was thei
hero in defeat as he rushed for
128 yards in nine carries, an j
average of 14.1 yards per play, i
Steve Thurlow completed four
passes out of eight for 78 yards
and also ran for 39 yards on five
rushes, a 7.8 average.
Southern Cal opened the scor- 1
ing the first time it got its hands
on the ball. Taking the opening
kickoff, the Trobabes marched 68
yards in nine plays with Willie
Brown going into the end /one
from 30 yards out.
Stanford returned the compli- [
ment by marching back with the
resulting kickoff on a s.Vyard
drive. Barnes scored the TD on a
34-yard run over tackle. Jerry
Cronin's attempted PAT kick was
wide to the left.
THE PAPOOSES moved ahead
just before the end of the first
â€¢stanza when Thurlow took the
ball over from the two-yard line.
Again Cronin's extra point at
tempt was wide to the left, mak
ing the score 12-7, Stanford.
The scoreboard remained that
way until the final play of the
second period. Then with the ball
on their own 40 yard line, the Tro-!
babes struck on a 60-yard pass |
play from Pete Beathard to j
Brown. Loren Hunt kicked the i
point and the score stood South-!
ern Cal 14, Stanford 12 at the half, j
Troy's frosh wasted little time
in adding an insurance touch
down in the third period. This j
time Teruo Yamamoto did the j
damage, intercepting a Stanford
pass on the Papoose 23 and going
into the end zone unmolested.
WITH ONE second left in the
quarter, Barnes took a pitchout

around left end and romped 72
yards for the Stanford score. The
Indians took to the air for Ihe
conversion with a pass from Jim
Norman to Patitucci clicking for a
two-pointer, making the score 21-
20.
Brown put the Trobabes back
in front on a 22-yard fourth per
iod scoring play, but the Papooses
came right back. They marched
73 yards in nine plays and Thur
low connected with Patitucci for
six points. But a charging SC line
man batted the ball away from
Patitucci on the conversion try.
