## Harriers Outrun USC; Cal Takes 3-Way Meet 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Fine team running by the cross country squad gave Stanford its
only Homecoming weekend victory over USC. In contrast to the
moral victories registered by the varsity and frosh football teams
and the water poloists. the harriers came through with a real live
28 to 29 upset of the Trojan runners.
The victory was marred somewhat by the fact that Cal won the

triangular competition with the
score reading Cal 37. Stanford
43. Southern Cal 44, and that the
Bears nosed out the Indians in
dual competition by 26 to 30.
BUT THE Stanford runners
will get another crack at Cal in
the big meet on November 15th.
Coach Payton Jordan was
pleased with the improvement of
the Indian cross country men,
especially in light of the fact that
only the week before USC had
soundly defeated the Card har
riers.
Particularly encouraging was
the showing of Rich Klier, who
led for the first three and one
quarter miles of the four-mile
race.
KLIER finished third, only 14
seconds behind Cal's Alan Gay
lord, one of the nation's top dis
tance runners, who won in 21
minutes and eight seconds.
The factor, however, which en
abled the Indians to nose out the
Trojans was very close bunching
of almost the entire Stanford
team. Only one Indian finished
in the top seven, but eight of the
next eleven finishers were Cards.
As a result, the fifth Southern

Cal runner, Rene Rodgers. could
do no better than 20th place. If
only the top lour runners on each
team had counted. Southern Cal
would have won easily. But five
runners had to come in on each
squad, and the Stanford team
work paid off.
THE UNNOTICED heroes were
Larry Shafer, Frank Wallace,
Ralph Weidner and Bruce John
son, who finished 14th. 16th, 17th
and 18th, respectively. The places
were not impressive, but the fact
| that they beat out the fifth Tro
jan was vital.
Tribe Coach Payton Jordan
stated that he certainly
j did not consider victory against
Cal tn be out of reach. Most of
the Indian opponents including
the Bears, have been much more
experienced than the Stanfordites,
most of whom are freshmen and
sophomores.
But the Indians are gaining ex
perience quickly, and are likely
to defeat teams which beat them
the first time around. Jordan
pointed out that "all we have to
I do is move a few guys up one
' place to win."

lord, one of the nation's top dis
tance runners, who won in 21
minutes and eight seconds.
The factor, however, which en
abled the Indians to nose out the
Trojans was very close bunching
of almost the entire Stanford
team. Only one Indian finished
in the top seven, but eight of the
next eleven finishers were Cards.
As a result, the fifth Southern

Cal runner, Rene Rodgers. could
do no better than 20th place. If
only the top lour runners on each
team had counted. Southern Cal
would have won easily. But five
runners had to come in on each
squad, and the Stanford team
work paid off.
THE UNNOTICED heroes were
Larry Shafer, Frank Wallace,
Ralph Weidner and Bruce John
son, who finished 14th. 16th, 17th
and 18th, respectively. The places
were not impressive, but the fact
| that they beat out the fifth Tro
jan was vital.
Tribe Coach Payton Jordan
stated that he certainly
j did not consider victory against
Cal tn be out of reach. Most of
the Indian opponents including
the Bears, have been much more
experienced than the Stanfordites,
most of whom are freshmen and
sophomores.
But the Indians are gaining ex
perience quickly, and are likely
to defeat teams which beat them
the first time around. Jordan
pointed out that "all we have to
I do is move a few guys up one
' place to win."
Fine team running by the cross country squad gave Stanford its
only Homecoming weekend victory over USC. In contrast to the
moral victories registered by the varsity and frosh football teams
and the water poloists. the harriers came through with a real live
28 to 29 upset of the Trojan runners.
The victory was marred somewhat by the fact that Cal won the

triangular competition with the
score reading Cal 37. Stanford
43. Southern Cal 44, and that the
Bears nosed out the Indians in
dual competition by 26 to 30.
BUT THE Stanford runners
will get another crack at Cal in
the big meet on November 15th.
Coach Payton Jordan was
pleased with the improvement of
the Indian cross country men,
especially in light of the fact that
only the week before USC had
soundly defeated the Card har
riers.
Particularly encouraging was
the showing of Rich Klier, who
led for the first three and one
quarter miles of the four-mile
race.
KLIER finished third, only 14
seconds behind Cal's Alan Gay
lord, one of the nation's top dis
tance runners, who won in 21
minutes and eight seconds.
