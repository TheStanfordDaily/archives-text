# KZSU Installs New Transmitter In ATO House
## 
### 
The first of a series of new
KZSU transmitters has been in
stalled in the ATO house. It is
expected that the first unit will
provide radio coverage to four or
five nearby houses.
Construction of six of these
transmitters has been completed
and their operation pends instal
lation of audio-lines from KZSU
to the fraternity house locations.
Chief Engineer Hon Murphy
stated that the completion date
of the remaining transmitters is
being delayed because of man
power rather than technical dif
ficulties. Assistance from students
capable of climbing telephone
poles is badly needed. Interested
students are requested to contact
Murphy at KZSU offices in back
of Memorial Ilall.
