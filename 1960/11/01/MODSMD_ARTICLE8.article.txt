# U.N. Hears Cuba's Charge
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.
(UPl)â€”Cuba charged yesterday
that "mercenaries" are standing
by to invade its country "under
the orders of American adven
turers of all types."
Cuba Foreign Minister Raul
Roa made the charge before the
General Assembly. It appeared to
be a backdown from his charge
before the Assembly's steering
committee last week that the
United States government plotted
an invasion which "might come
at any hour."
Roa again referred to the "scan
dalous accusations" against Cuba
by Vice President Richard M.
Nixon and Sen. John F. Kennedy
in their "great debate" of the
U.S. election campaign.
Roa did not elaborate on his
previously stated charge that "the
U.S. government is trying eco
nomically to strangle Cuba and
to carry out a large scale inva
sion, basing itself in Guatemala
and the Swan Islands (in the Gulf
of Mexicoi.
The assembly agreed to its
steering committee's recommen
dation to put Cuba's charges of
U.S. "aggression" on its agenda.
