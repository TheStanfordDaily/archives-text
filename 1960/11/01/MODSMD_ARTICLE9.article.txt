PHILADELPHIA (IJPIi Son. John F. Ken
nedy last night tauntingly offered to let Vice
President Richard M. Nixon use President Eisen
hower as a backstop on a fifth television debate.
And he warned thai under continued GOP rule
"the gates will soon be open to a lean and hungry
enemy."
Kennedy wound up his drive for Pennsylvania's
32 electoral votes with a re-statement of his politi
cal creed before more than 10,000 Democrats at
a $100-a-plate dinner in Philadelphia's vast Con
vention Hall. His speech was carried nationally
over television. Kennedy left immediately for an
overnight flight to California.
THIS DEMOCRATIC presidential nominee's
mocking offer for Nixon to make further use of
the president was first made in a speech at Tem
ple University.
Then he told his Convention Hall audience he
thought it was "unfortunate" that tonight's oc
casion was "not the fifth debate" which he and
his opponent never were able to arrange. Each
side blamed the other for the failure.
Kennedy drew cheers when he jibed again at
Nixon for his announcement that if elected he
wou'd visit the satellite countries of Eastern Eu
rope. Kennedy said that instead of "visiting East
ern Europe .liter the election, he should first visit
the coal and steel towns of eastern Pennslyvania
before the election.''

ard M. Nixon last night denounced Sen. John F. |
Kennedy's latest challenge to a fifth televised de- j
bate as "juvenile" and said "I'll he glad to debate
'him and his whole family any lime they like."
Both in a statement and in a speech before a
cheering crowd in a Republican area of Ridge
wood in Bergen County. N.J., Nixon shrugged off
the Democratic nominee's taunting offer to allow
President Eisenhower to accompany Nixon during
a debate with Kennedy.
"For a man who has Harry S. Truman, Adlai
Stevenson and the almost forgotten Lyndon John
son sounding off in different directions, Senator
Kennedy's statement is juvenile." Nixon declared
in a statement.
He said "II sounds like a schoolboy trying to
taunt his superiors."
HE EATER told his Ridgewood crowd that
"what the country really needs is a debate be- j
tween Jack and Lyndon (Johnson), the Demo- j
cratie vice presidential nominee,"
Nixon also charged that Kennedy "has been
showing such an ignorance of economics that he
has disqualified himself for the presidency."
Then, he added, at Ridgewood, "if this seems
to be toiurh talk, it is meant to be touch talk." <

NEW JERSEY iIJPI) - Vice President Rich- j
ard M. Nixon last night denounced Sen. John F. |
Kennedy's latest challenge to a fifth televised de- j
bate as "juvenile" and said "I'll he glad to debate
'him and his whole family any lime they like."
Both in a statement and in a speech before a
cheering crowd in a Republican area of Ridge
wood in Bergen County. N.J., Nixon shrugged off
the Democratic nominee's taunting offer to allow
President Eisenhower to accompany Nixon during
a debate with Kennedy.
"For a man who has Harry S. Truman, Adlai
Stevenson and the almost forgotten Lyndon John
son sounding off in different directions, Senator
Kennedy's statement is juvenile." Nixon declared
in a statement.
He said "II sounds like a schoolboy trying to
taunt his superiors."
HE EATER told his Ridgewood crowd that
"what the country really needs is a debate be- j
tween Jack and Lyndon (Johnson), the Demo- j
cratie vice presidential nominee,"
Nixon also charged that Kennedy "has been
showing such an ignorance of economics that he
has disqualified himself for the presidency."
Then, he added, at Ridgewood, "if this seems
to be toiurh talk, it is meant to be touch talk." <
PHILADELPHIA (IJPIi Son. John F. Ken
nedy last night tauntingly offered to let Vice
President Richard M. Nixon use President Eisen
hower as a backstop on a fifth television debate.
And he warned thai under continued GOP rule
"the gates will soon be open to a lean and hungry
enemy."
Kennedy wound up his drive for Pennsylvania's
32 electoral votes with a re-statement of his politi
cal creed before more than 10,000 Democrats at
a $100-a-plate dinner in Philadelphia's vast Con
vention Hall. His speech was carried nationally
over television. Kennedy left immediately for an
overnight flight to California.
THIS DEMOCRATIC presidential nominee's
mocking offer for Nixon to make further use of
the president was first made in a speech at Tem
ple University.
Then he told his Convention Hall audience he
thought it was "unfortunate" that tonight's oc
casion was "not the fifth debate" which he and
his opponent never were able to arrange. Each
side blamed the other for the failure.
Kennedy drew cheers when he jibed again at
Nixon for his announcement that if elected he
wou'd visit the satellite countries of Eastern Eu
rope. Kennedy said that instead of "visiting East
ern Europe .liter the election, he should first visit
the coal and steel towns of eastern Pennslyvania
before the election.''
