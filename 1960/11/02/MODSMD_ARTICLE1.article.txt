BERKELEY, Nov. 2 (Special to The Daily t A strange looking
visiting physicist from the Netherlands and his entourage toured the
Cal campus yesterday afternoon.
When they left a ."50-foot "O ' D O VV D" banner hung down the
side of the Campanile.
Six Stanford students, including members of the band who last
year hung tHe "Beat Cal" banner on the Campanile, enlisted the aid
of a Berkeley research chemist to carry off their prank.
One of the six posed as a visiting physicist and, carrying a small
blue bag, was escorted to the Campanile observation platform by
the chemist.
Once on the platform, he set down his bag and began extolling
the beauties of the Cal campus in fluent German.
While his torrent of words kept the guards at bay, and another
member of the party translated, others grabbed the physicists bag,
unrolled the banned and flung it flown the side. Reports have it that
their escape was aided by the fact that no one on the Cal campus
knows the significance of the word "O'Dowd."
