## 
### JUDY SEABORG 
"The French press is difficult to
understand and even more diffi
cult to explain," said Jacques
Kayser. French historian and dep
uty director of the French Press
Institute at the University of
Paris, in his lecture on "Politics
and the Press in France" pre
sented last night in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Kayser discussed the position
of the numerous small political
dailies in Paris as well as their
influence on the readers. He said
the French people have a "liking
for political competition between
people and parties, but most of
all for the battle between ideas."
STRESSING that the strong
dailies in Paris are not affiliated
with a political party, but "par
ticipate actively in political bat
tles," Kayser traced the history of
the press in France.
The influence of the press upon
the public, he said, is relative to
the circumstances and to the in
dividual. Frenchmen believe the
newspapers print lies or the truth,
depending on the extenl to which
their own opinions agree. For this
reason, the backing of one of the
political dailies may be, but iÂ« not
necessarily, valuable to a politi
cian.
