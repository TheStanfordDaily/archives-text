The Interfratemity Council's decision Monday night lo work
together with the I niversitv to eliminate discriminatory clauses
and practices in national charters is lo he commended.
The official statement is: "The University is opposed to dis
criminatory racial and religious clauses and practices. Insofar as
such clauses presently exist, the University will work actively with
student groups to eliminate them at the earliest possible date."
Discriminatory clauses in national charters represent a great
paradox. The existence of fraternities is hascd upon the concepts
of brotherhood and equality, regardless of race or religion.
The people w ho are responsible for discriminators' clauses have
apparentlv lost sight of this fact as well as having lost sight of the
ideals expressed in I lie Constitution.
One of the principle ideals underlying the existence of fra
ternities is iliat they are to serve as democratic institutions where
students of different environments, of different races and religions,
may learn about each other and may learn lo rid themselves of
certain prejudices which often result from a lack of communica
t ion.
Kidding Stanford fraternities of these undemocratic clauses
should represent onl\ the first step. Stanford's practices protect
Stanford, hut not the country. \\ by doesn't someone do something
about the people who are responsible for these clauses. Tliev are
the real problem and as such should also be eliminated.
