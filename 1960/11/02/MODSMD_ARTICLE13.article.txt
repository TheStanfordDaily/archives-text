### BOB HAMRDLA 
GERMANY.- Political interest
in the Federal Republic of Ger
many is running high in this pre
election time, partly because of
the coming election in the U.S.,
and also on account of elections
next year in Germany itself. From
talking with an admittedly small
sample of German citizenry, I
would like to report on the opin
ions which seem to prevail.
The average German citizen is
quite well-informed and interested
about the course of politics in the
United States; West Germany's
close tics with America have
helped establish this concern. For
eign policy is naturally the fav
orite topic of conversation since
it is so intimately tied up with
ihe future course of events in
Germany.
There are three facets of for
eign policy which t lie- German
worries about: general East-West
relations, the Berlin question, and
the reunification of Germany.
Close contact, via relatives and
refugees, with the totalitarian
East German regime has intensi
fied the grave concern over the
cold war status between the East
and the West.
Germans tend to favor negoti
ation which might reduce the
danger of a hot war, but only
negotiation which can be com
pleted with a net result of no
loss of status for the West. The
Berlin problem is keenly studied
here, for West Germans believe
that Berlin is the most volatile
powder keg in the world.
The tightening of travel restric
tions on West Germans wishing to
visit the so-called German Demo
cratic Republic, and other Com
munist tactics, have not lessened
the desire for reunification, but
certainly have increased appre
hension that with every passing
day, the possibilities of a united
Germany fade a little more.
It seems that the majority of
Germans would favor Mr. Nixon.
Eisenhower's administration has
not alienated Germans with the

U-2 incident, etc., as it has some
Americans. Ho retains his tre
mendous popularity as a wartime
hero, and Nixon seems to offer
a reliable continuation of his pol
icy, with its firm stand on Berlin
and advocation of West Ger
many's equal partnership with
the Western countries.
Kennedy does have his follow
ers, however; his speeches about
a rekindling of moral fortitude
in the U.S. appeal to most people
here. Kennedy's most serious mis
take, in their opinion, was the
statement on Qnemoy and Matsn:
there are few Germans who feel
that the West can give one square
inch of land to the Communists
without losing more than just the
soil itself.
Konrad Adenauer, or "Der
Alte" (the old one), as he is called,
has a good chance of being re
elected as Chancellor of the Fed
eral Republic. Germans like his
strong stand against the national
glory policy of de Gaulle and
against any tendency to split from
the U.S.
A German may occasionally
complain about the presence of
American troops on his home soil,
but the thought of the United
States pulling her forces out of
Germany is a most unpleasant
one. Adenauer, in his policy of
cementing unity with the U.S. and
the NATO community as a whole,
is generally praised.
The greatest factor working
against "Der Alte" is, ironically,
his age. Though now in his SO's,
he shows no signs of physical in
capability in the execution of his
strenuous job. Many believe, how
over, that a younger man might
be a wiser choice. The logical per
son, say many (even some sup
porters of the present adminis
tration), would bo Willy Brandt,
the Socialist mayor of West Ber
lin.
Any "Bui-germeister" of Berlin
is usually popular; Brandt's soft
spoken manner and steely dedica
tion have attracted many to him
in spite of party differences.

It seems that the majority of
Germans would favor Mr. Nixon.
Eisenhower's administration has
not alienated Germans with the

U-2 incident, etc., as it has some
Americans. Ho retains his tre
mendous popularity as a wartime
hero, and Nixon seems to offer
a reliable continuation of his pol
icy, with its firm stand on Berlin
and advocation of West Ger
many's equal partnership with
the Western countries.
Kennedy does have his follow
ers, however; his speeches about
a rekindling of moral fortitude
in the U.S. appeal to most people
here. Kennedy's most serious mis
take, in their opinion, was the
statement on Qnemoy and Matsn:
there are few Germans who feel
that the West can give one square
inch of land to the Communists
without losing more than just the
soil itself.
Konrad Adenauer, or "Der
Alte" (the old one), as he is called,
has a good chance of being re
elected as Chancellor of the Fed
eral Republic. Germans like his
strong stand against the national
glory policy of de Gaulle and
against any tendency to split from
the U.S.
A German may occasionally
complain about the presence of
American troops on his home soil,
but the thought of the United
States pulling her forces out of
Germany is a most unpleasant
one. Adenauer, in his policy of
cementing unity with the U.S. and
the NATO community as a whole,
is generally praised.
The greatest factor working
against "Der Alte" is, ironically,
his age. Though now in his SO's,
he shows no signs of physical in
capability in the execution of his
strenuous job. Many believe, how
over, that a younger man might
be a wiser choice. The logical per
son, say many (even some sup
porters of the present adminis
tration), would bo Willy Brandt,
the Socialist mayor of West Ber
lin.
Any "Bui-germeister" of Berlin
is usually popular; Brandt's soft
spoken manner and steely dedica
tion have attracted many to him
in spite of party differences.
GERMANY.- Political interest
in the Federal Republic of Ger
many is running high in this pre
election time, partly because of
the coming election in the U.S.,
and also on account of elections
next year in Germany itself. From
talking with an admittedly small
sample of German citizenry, I
would like to report on the opin
ions which seem to prevail.
The average German citizen is
quite well-informed and interested
about the course of politics in the
United States; West Germany's
close tics with America have
helped establish this concern. For
eign policy is naturally the fav
orite topic of conversation since
it is so intimately tied up with
ihe future course of events in
Germany.
There are three facets of for
eign policy which t lie- German
worries about: general East-West
relations, the Berlin question, and
the reunification of Germany.
Close contact, via relatives and
refugees, with the totalitarian
East German regime has intensi
fied the grave concern over the
cold war status between the East
and the West.
Germans tend to favor negoti
ation which might reduce the
danger of a hot war, but only
negotiation which can be com
pleted with a net result of no
loss of status for the West. The
Berlin problem is keenly studied
here, for West Germans believe
that Berlin is the most volatile
powder keg in the world.
The tightening of travel restric
tions on West Germans wishing to
visit the so-called German Demo
cratic Republic, and other Com
munist tactics, have not lessened
the desire for reunification, but
certainly have increased appre
hension that with every passing
day, the possibilities of a united

in spite of party differences.
