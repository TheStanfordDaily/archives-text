# Remember the Alamo?

We'll remember "The Alamo"—
all three hours and twelve min
utes of it!
Playing at the Alexandria,
Geary at 18th Avenue, in San
Francisco, the Todd-AO spectac
ular opened last Wednesday night.
And, like all spectaculars, it is
designed to draw the crowds by
wide screen and striking visual
effects plus a couple of typically
trite, useless (to the plot) love
scenes.
But, unlike some spectaculars,
"The Alamo" succeeds with the
former. The film photography is
\iv if I and shows imagination in
a number of scenes. While the
wide, wide screen of Todd-AO does
little for close-ups of one or two
actors, the range scenes and the
advancement of Santa Ana's Mex
ican army are especially effective.
The musical background, too,
is especially good—with one ex
ception. The lullaby sung to the
liltle Dickinson girl stands out as
being added purely for senti
ment's sake. It is nicely sung
but, a man and wife just don't
harmonize that well.
Produced and directed bv John

Wayne, "The Alamo" also stars
John Wayne as Davy Crockett, a
characterization which doesn't
reach the depth it might. To a
lesser extent, this is also true of
Richard Widmark's portrayal of
Jim Bowie.
However, the third central char
acter, William Travis, who is re
sponsible for the defense of the
Alamo, emerges as a real and
interesting person. Played by Lau
rence Harvey of "Room at the
Top" fame, the role of Travis is
one which might have emerged
as melodramatic in the hands and
emotions of a less capable actor.
The film's most serious defect
is its weak dialogue in several
scenes. While if may be hard to
do something new with a love
scene, the ones between Crockett
and a pretty Mexican girl should
have been left out. The dialogue
is at its worst here.
The best parts of the film are
the actual battles and the beau
tifully-photographed night before
Santa Ana's attack. However,
these are long in coming and
have to stumble over quite a bit
of well-worn Hollywood sand on
the way.

We'll remember "The Alamo"—
all three hours and twelve min
utes of it!
Playing at the Alexandria,
Geary at 18th Avenue, in San
Francisco, the Todd-AO spectac
ular opened last Wednesday night.
And, like all spectaculars, it is
designed to draw the crowds by
wide screen and striking visual
effects plus a couple of typically
trite, useless (to the plot) love
scenes.
But, unlike some spectaculars,
"The Alamo" succeeds with the
former. The film photography is
\iv if I and shows imagination in
a number of scenes. While the
wide, wide screen of Todd-AO does
little for close-ups of one or two
actors, the range scenes and the
advancement of Santa Ana's Mex
ican army are especially effective.
The musical background, too,
is especially good—with one ex
ception. The lullaby sung to the
liltle Dickinson girl stands out as
being added purely for senti
ment's sake. It is nicely sung
but, a man and wife just don't
harmonize that well.
Produced and directed bv John

Wayne, "The Alamo" also stars
John Wayne as Davy Crockett, a
characterization which doesn't
reach the depth it might. To a
lesser extent, this is also true of
Richard Widmark's portrayal of
Jim Bowie.
However, the third central char
acter, William Travis, who is re
sponsible for the defense of the
Alamo, emerges as a real and
interesting person. Played by Lau
rence Harvey of "Room at the
Top" fame, the role of Travis is
one which might have emerged
as melodramatic in the hands and
emotions of a less capable actor.
The film's most serious defect
is its weak dialogue in several
scenes. While if may be hard to
do something new with a love
scene, the ones between Crockett
and a pretty Mexican girl should
have been left out. The dialogue
is at its worst here.
The best parts of the film are
the actual battles and the beau
tifully-photographed night before
Santa Ana's attack. However,
these are long in coming and
have to stumble over quite a bit
of well-worn Hollywood sand on
the way.
