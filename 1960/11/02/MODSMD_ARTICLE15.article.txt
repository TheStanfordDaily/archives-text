# No Divorce Expected Between Russia, China
## 
### BILL JUNE IIR Political Analyst 
Among Communists, the Chi-
I nese represent the far left wing.
(China's significant difference
! with the more moderate Russians
concerns the belief in the inevita
bility of war. The Chinese believe
that a third and final "Imperial
ist" war is beyond human will to
prevent.
The Russians have modified
this traditional view. Moscow, per
haps appreciating the absurdity
[ of nuclear war, has indicated that
! "peaceful co-existence" might bet
ter serve the cause of Commit
; nism. War, Moscow suggests, is
by no means inevitable.
The Chinese view "peaceful co
existence" as a compromise of
Communism which only helps the
capitalist shore up his crumbling
economic edifice. The Commu
nist, the Chinese contend, should
put as much pressure on capital
ism as he can. Those who volun
tarily subscribe to "peaceful co
existence" betray Communism.
The Chinese point out that Com
munism emerged from the tur
moil of the first "Imperialist"
war and expanded in the chaos of
the second. They say Communism
will triumph as a result of the
third inevitable Imperialist strug
gle.
These Imperialist wars are,
theoretically, scraps involving
only Imperialists. But Russian ex
perience in the second of these in
evitable affairs indicates that
even Communists can bccome un
willing participants. Despite the
probability of innocent involve
ment, the Chinese are smugly pre
pared to take their place in evolv
ing Leninist history. They face
the "inevitable" war brightened
by the conviction that some of the
650 million Chinese will survive
to make China the primary power
in the post World War 111 era.
From a non-ideological vantage
point, the tough Chinese position
is practical. They are demanding
great and cruel sacrifices from
their people. Any sort of "peace
ful co-existence" bloc with the
West would eliminate the sup
posed reasons for these sacrifices.
The so called imperialist threat
I contained in the concept of the
inevitable imperialist war en
ables the Chinese leadership to
demand much of the people.
China's iron fisted attitude
doesn't put it in any danger. Since
it lacks nuclear weapons and
rocket delivery systems, its tough
j talk can hardly provoke a panic
attack from the West. Further
more, its military incapacity to
wage The Big War protects it
from the charge that it won't back
up tough talk with action.
Some observers feel that the
1 revolutionary Chinese will mellow
with age. They point out that the
once ultra-radical Russians have
become more conservative as
their industrial level and stand
ard of living have risen. They feel
that economic development in
now very austere China will bo
followed by greater political mod
eration.
But as long as exploding Chi
nese population keeps pace with
its industrialization, there is little
chance the Chinese will be satis
fied. Chinese radicalism will he
with us for some time.
There are other reasons why
China and Russia may not be able
to come to terms for some time.
Some students of China see a
strong current of nationalism un
derlying Chinese behavior. Na
tionalism would throw China into
conflict not only with capitalist
nations, but to some degree with
the Soviet Union. The most impor
tant point is that nationalism will
probably remain a semi-perma
nent fact in China's policy
making.
Both K. and Mao have good
practical, if not ideological, rea
sons for maintaining the positions
they have taken. Despite the
sharp differences, Khrushchev
can't afford to excommunicate
Mao and China needs Russia.
Since both desire Communist
unity, neither is prepared to shat
ter the lied Bloc in an attempt to
force the other to come to terms.
Despite activities of China out
side of Asia, Mao is apparently
content to let leadership stay in
Moscow. The Chinese still have

plenty tn do at home. Further
j more, the Russians are the only
| Red country with the military and
i economic weapons to implement j
the lough anti-Imperialism the
Chinese lalk about.
Mao has the spirif but no weap
ons. K. has the weapons and ihe
Chinese wish he would gel the
spirit. Although Peking and hen-;
j pecked Moscow may have a rocky
i marriage, there is no divorce in â€¢
| sight.
