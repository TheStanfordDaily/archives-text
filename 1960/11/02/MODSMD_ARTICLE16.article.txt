Editor, the Daily:
Allow me to use your valuable
paper to state how pleased I am to
learn of the existence of the Afri
can Desk of the Institute of In
ternational Relations in Stanford
University putting up an African
project of getting an exchange of
students between universities in
this country and those in Africa.
I think this is a most worthy
project which will certainly help
to promote understanding be
tween the new nations of Africa
and the U.S.A. True Democracy
as opposed to Communism can
only be maintained if peoples of
different nations have deep un
derstanding of each other and so
any support from individuals and
bodies of individuals and even
government is highly commended.

You say that a newspaper "is
FREE to form its own editorial
policy and to choose its own edi
tor." But who always determines
editorial policy and selects an
editor of a newspaper! The owner
and publisher of the paper. Who
owns and publishes the Daily
Cal! The students of Cal. repre
sented by the Ex Com. If the
editor of the Daily Cal is elected
only by the paper's staff, the
owners and publishers of the
paper are not FREE to control
their own newspaper.
You have thrown new light on
the meaning of "Freedom of the
Press." Perhaps even Hearst will
take the hint and let the Exam
iner staff elect its own editor
preferably a socialist, to show
non-bias.
