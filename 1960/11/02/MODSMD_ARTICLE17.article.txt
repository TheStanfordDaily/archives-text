Editor, the Daily:
We would like to commend the
Daily on Sherry Welch's front
page news article in the Monday
edition. In view of Ihe facts which
she has brought to light, it is
hoped that the inequities in the
present system of football stand
ings could be corrected by includ
ing the weekly AAWU moral
standings. This could aid the
Daily sports staff in making its
moral predictions for Ihe week,
and we can even foresee this in
novation being carried by sports
writers and predictors across the
nation.
Stanford need not de-empha
si/.e! ! Asa dominant moral power
among western universities. Stan

ford might hope 1o represent fre
quently the AAWU in the an
nual Moral Bowl. Especially en
couraging is the fact that our
closest moral rival, the University
of California, destroyed its per
fect record last Saturday at
Corvallis.
With Stanford football looking
up, we wish to thank Prince
Light foot, Phil Huyck, the band,
and Stanford rooters; and en
dorse Mike Walsh as our moral
player of the week.
Let's keep our winning streak
going!
