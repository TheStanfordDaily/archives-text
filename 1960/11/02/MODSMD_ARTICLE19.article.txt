The Stanford Reverse
JAC K CURTICE must be wondering right now what this game of
football is all about.
Two weeks ago Jack was hung in effigy as a result of losing a
lop-sider to "little" San Jose; this week he loses another and gets
carried off the field. What happened?
"An all-time low" was the comment after Bob Titchenal's Spartans
gave the complacent Indians a 34-20 shock, editorials cited the pos
sibility of de-emphasis, fans showed a definite lack of enthusiasm
and Cactus Jack graced the arches of Ihe post office in proxy. The
Stanford anti-spirit was big news in the Bay Area with everyone
offering solutions to the problem.
STANFORD didn't give up football, as some urged them to do,
nor did they immediately cancel their remaining games and sched-

ule Palo Alto High School. In
stead the team picked up, showed
some spark and made a respecta
ble showing against powerful
UCLA in Los Angeles.
The Indians had already pulled
themselves out of despair by the
time they met Southern Cal and
their play was good, despite a
21-6 loss.
The fans, instead of sitting on
their hands, came alive with the
loudest cheers heard by local ob
servers in years. Saturday after
noon was a demonstration of the
good effects of spirit and we're
speaking here only of the rooting
for the football team, as divorced
from other aspects of spirit that
might pervade campus life.
(OMMKNTS from the players
indicated that the spirit at the
game had a marked effect on the
home squad. Those students who

wanted a Stanford win were able to aid Ihe cause by showing their
support and the Farm eleven responded by outplaying the visitors
during the second half.
So from an all-time low, the Stanford spirit has gone to an all
time high in just two weeks. The amazing thing is that this was ac
complished without winning a single game, and in fact it's doubtful
that such an about-face in attitude has ever occurred at a school
where the team has remained winless. Football fans, even college
fans, usually aren't that forgiving.
Stanford makes news again, this time with their remarkable
new spirit.
ACTUALLY THE performance at the Stadium last Saturday
shouldn't have been too unexpected. The San Jose loss was a low
point and after that the team and rooters could do one of two obvious
things they could continue to be apathetic and forget the whole
thing or they could fight back. They fought back and they fought
back better than most people thought possible.
Probably that sort of rooter spirit won't occur for another non-
Big Game for many more years. The varied special circumstances
that accompanied the USC performance won't be present during the
Card's next home fray and so don't count on another big display
from the Red and White.
The danger is expecting too much from the performance on
Saturday afternoon. Stanford stands a good chance of losing their
next two, and the fans probably won't repeat whas was obviously a
one-shot affair.
A Temporary "Red-Hotness"
>lORE TIIAX likely the Homecoming spirit was a temporary
"Red Hot" feeling caused mostly by the opposite type of spirit shown
in the San Jose game. Already there are signs that the "new look"
is an unfounded â€¢enthusiasm as some people have already have the
feeling that we will win every remaining game on the schedule.
We're not trying to throw water on any fine plans that the Cards
might have. Certainly we hope Stanford wins every remaining game
just don't get your hopes too high.
Remember, our next two opponents are Oregon and Oregon State
and they might not be too cooperative. Oregon State almost beat
Washington, the top team on the coast, and the Beavers came close
in their game with top-ranked lowa. Oregon has had just as much
success, almost nipping the Huskies in a 7-6 thriller while compiling
a five-win, two-loss record.
STANFORD NOW has a world of desire, they're up for every
game left on the schedule, but they haven't learned to run any faster
in ihe past two weeks. Both OSC and the Ducks have speed, running,
passing and almost every other requisite for grid victories and the
Indian's lack will be a vulnerable point in both games.
Physically, Stanford still isn't a winning team. They lack fast
backs, both on offense and defense, sticky-fingered ends and line
men who are capable of good pursuit. The team might have more
desire than Oregon State and Oregon put together and still not be
able to match their raw talent. Problems of recruiting, of luring the
best possible academically qualified gridders to the Farm still exist.
There's still room for improvement in Stanford football.
