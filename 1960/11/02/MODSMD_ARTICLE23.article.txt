# Rain Hampers Ducks; Chance for Card Win
## Daily Sports 
### RUSS ALLEN 
This weekend the revitalized I
Stanford Indians journey North)
to meet the speedy and talented j
Oregon Webfoots. Word has it j
i that it has been an unusually wet |
ancl rainy fall in Portland, and
just perhaps the Indians can grab
; off their first victory against the
slippery Ducks.
Certainly speedy Ducks Cleve
land Jones and Dave Grayson will
have trouble turning the corners
and quarterback Dave Grosz will
have a little trouble throwing the
ball next Saturday.
The Ducks will be fighting mad
this weekend. They lost a thriller
to the eome-from-behind Wash
ington Huskies in the fourth quar
ter 7-6. The Oregon record is 5-2
with impressive wins over Cali
; fornia, Idaho, Washington State,
Utah and San Jose State. They
have lost only to the Huskies and
the powerful Big 10 team Michi
gan.
OREGON has a comparatively
! young team ihis year with the
bulk of the line composed of soph
omores. However, Coach Len Cas
anova has pulled these "young
bulls" together in the line with
an experienced backfield of Grosz,
certainly one of the top quarter
backs in the nation last year;
Jones, a speed 5'3" 140-pounder;
Grayson and fullback Bruce Sny
| der.'
Standouts in the Oregon line
this year are soph tackle Steve
Barnett, a 6-1 225-pounder; guards
Dave Urell and Mike Rose; and
end Kent Peterson.
The Ducks specialize in speed
j and deception in the backfield,
vvith Grosz handing off to either
Grayson, Jones or waiting for the
second or third back to the line.
| Grosz also will pass when needed
! and his favorite receivers have
been halfbacks Jones or Mickey
Bruce — a top-notch defensive
j back.
THE INDIANS should expect'
a lot of wide plays and quick
pitch-outs this weekend and must
stop the fast Webfoot backs be
fore they break into the open.
The Ducks have shown them
selves quite an offensive power
this year. Over in Berkeley they .
defeated the Bears by three touch- j
j downs but also gained over 500
yards—almost twice as much as
: a team gains in a normal contest j
- offensively, and many first j
downs.
SO COACH Jack Curtice should
have plenty to worry about in j
his defensive backfield if tiie|

Ducks can break through.
Also the Oregonians unveiled j
a halfback pass play against Cal
which saw Jones run wide then |
stop and throw to back Grayson
in the end zone for an Oregon |
score.
Once again the weather pro
vides a key factor to the game,
and in the rainy northwest any
one play can provide a score and \
win the ball game.
