# OAS Appeals To Cuba; U.S. States Position
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD â€” Wor
ried Latin American diplomats
prepared a last-ditch appeal to
Cuba today to cooperate with the
Organization of American States
(OAS) in finding a peaceful set
tlement of the U.S.-Cuban dispute.
The United States, it was
learned, warned these nations last
week that Soviet bloc arms ship
ments to Cuba might be used
against them.
President Eisenhower bluntly
warned Cuba yesterday that the
United States will defend its $70
million naval base at Guantaridmo
Bay with "whatever steps may be
appropriate" in ease of attack.
Taking obvious note of Pre
mier Fidel Castro's charges that
an invasion of Cuba was "immi
nent," the president said the huge
U.S. base on Cuban soil poses "no
threat whatever to the sover
eignty of Cuba, to the peace and
security of its people, or to the
independence of any of the Amer
ican countries."
