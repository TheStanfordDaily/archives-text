Ol'l STIOX: Jusi how Rood are the STANFORD CRI.W CUT KINGS?
ANSWER: Plenty good, and here's all the written proof you'll ever want.
In August 1055 Uharlie and Mike left Stanford to start our own off-campus barber shops at
/]();; California Avenue, South Palo Alto. We knew that to get the Stanford men oil the campus
to come to see us we really had to go and go we did. We staged one of the biggest advertising
campaigns in barber history. We spent thousands in all kinds of advertising of which some ol
you oldtimers still remember.
We also knew that our work had to be the finest and the best, to get them back again! Our
barbers had to be the best. We had to pay over the union scale. Stanford men we went otter
hoard for you. Whenever Ave hired a barber that was not sure of his work, I personally directed
his work and showed him the way to become one of the STAN"IX)RD CREW CUT KINC.S.
Willi Stanford's support Ave grew from two chairs to seven chairs in seven months and to ten
and eleven barbers within a year later. A feat as yet unparalleled in barber history.
Our business was so good, our work so fine that local barbed would drive by to look in and
gape at what they thought was the monster of California Avenue.
In August 195(1 I was approached by the Union Secretary and asked if I would (for the good
of the barber profession) demonstrate (at a mass meeting) to the local barbers my skills and
methods on how I do the "Stanford Crew Cut." I did this. I gave a local barber a Stanford Crew
Cut at the Union Hall in front of a large group of Local Barbers.
Believe me Stanford men, this was not easy to do. Barbers are very independent and proud
of their work. Yet I was so sure of my Stanford Crew Cuts that I took the challenge and gave the
perfect crew cut in front of them all. This was my greatest moment, from that day on the local
barbers had great respect lor the mighty STANTORI) CREW CI I KINGS.
Now Stanford men this great experience has been passed on to our men. Yes, they are top
men; and the best barbers in this business. If you're going to pay 52.00 for a haircut, CET
THE BEST!!

Ol'l STIOX: Jusi how Rood are the STANFORD CRI.W CUT KINGS?
ANSWER: Plenty good, and here's all the written proof you'll ever want.
In August 1055 Uharlie and Mike left Stanford to start our own off-campus barber shops at
/]();; California Avenue, South Palo Alto. We knew that to get the Stanford men oil the campus
to come to see us we really had to go and go we did. We staged one of the biggest advertising
campaigns in barber history. We spent thousands in all kinds of advertising of which some ol
you oldtimers still remember.
We also knew that our work had to be the finest and the best, to get them back again! Our
barbers had to be the best. We had to pay over the union scale. Stanford men we went otter
hoard for you. Whenever Ave hired a barber that was not sure of his work, I personally directed
his work and showed him the way to become one of the STAN"IX)RD CREW CUT KINC.S.
Willi Stanford's support Ave grew from two chairs to seven chairs in seven months and to ten
and eleven barbers within a year later. A feat as yet unparalleled in barber history.
Our business was so good, our work so fine that local barbed would drive by to look in and
gape at what they thought was the monster of California Avenue.
In August 195(1 I was approached by the Union Secretary and asked if I would (for the good
of the barber profession) demonstrate (at a mass meeting) to the local barbers my skills and
methods on how I do the "Stanford Crew Cut." I did this. I gave a local barber a Stanford Crew
Cut at the Union Hall in front of a large group of Local Barbers.
Believe me Stanford men, this was not easy to do. Barbers are very independent and proud
of their work. Yet I was so sure of my Stanford Crew Cuts that I took the challenge and gave the
perfect crew cut in front of them all. This was my greatest moment, from that day on the local
barbers had great respect lor the mighty STANTORI) CREW CI I KINGS.
Now Stanford men this great experience has been passed on to our men. Yes, they are top
men; and the best barbers in this business. If you're going to pay 52.00 for a haircut, CET
THE BEST!!
