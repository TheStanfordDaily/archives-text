# Gap Between Literature and Science—Snow
## 
### JUDY SEABORG 
The gap between the two!
worlds of literature and science
is really the "intellectual expres-1
sion of other gaps which make J
this world uncomfortable and im-;
possible to live in," state Sir!
Charles Percy Snow, eminent j
British scientist and author, in a I
lecture to an overflow audience I
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last j
night.
Snow, presenting "Recent \
Thoughts on the Two Cultures," i
discussed the problems of "illiter-1
aey" among scientists and scion
tific illiteracy among writers and !
"men of letters."
USING as a basis a lecture he j
delivered last year* at Cambridge j
University in which he stated that i
although the scientist has a
gloomy view of life, he has "pre-!
served social hope," while the |
writer, in contrast, either resigns
from the social life or proceeds 1o
deny it, Snow cited objections he
had received and his answers to j
them.
He suggested that education is
the key to bridging the gap, by |
the "not impossible" task of mak- j
ing scientists literate, and by
making literary persons scien- j
tifically literal. Although there
are cases in the latter group;
where individuals may be "math
ematically blind," the teaching of
"mid-range" sciences such as psy
chology. social science, and lin- j
guisties" may solve the problem.
SNOW, who has served as Tech- •
nical Director of the Ministry of j
Labor and Civil Service Com-j
missioner, stressed "our obliga
tion to remove the gaps of incom- |
prehension which are bedeviling i
living as the world can and must I
live."
He concluded that there are j
"imperative reasons why we!
should all spend time coping with !
this problem beyond practicality'
and 'keeping up with the Rus-'
sians." " For our own sakes, we !
must "bridge the canyon between
literature and science."

The gap between the two!
worlds of literature and science
is really the "intellectual expres-1
sion of other gaps which make J
this world uncomfortable and im-;
possible to live in," state Sir!
Charles Percy Snow, eminent j
British scientist and author, in a I
lecture to an overflow audience I
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last j
night.
Snow, presenting "Recent \
Thoughts on the Two Cultures," i
discussed the problems of "illiter-1
aey" among scientists and scion
tific illiteracy among writers and !
"men of letters."
USING as a basis a lecture he j
delivered last year* at Cambridge j
University in which he stated that i
although the scientist has a
gloomy view of life, he has "pre-!
served social hope," while the |
writer, in contrast, either resigns
from the social life or proceeds 1o
deny it, Snow cited objections he
had received and his answers to j
them.
He suggested that education is
the key to bridging the gap, by |
the "not impossible" task of mak- j
ing scientists literate, and by
making literary persons scien- j
tifically literal. Although there
are cases in the latter group;
where individuals may be "math
ematically blind," the teaching of
"mid-range" sciences such as psy
chology. social science, and lin- j
guisties" may solve the problem.
