# Kayser Interview

Some problems facing freedom
of the press in France were dis
cussed in an interview with Pro
fessor Jacques Kayser, Deputy
Director of the French Press In
stitute at the University of Paris,
who has been in residence at
Stanford for the last month and
who spoke at the Tuesday Eve
ning Series this week.
In the past few years, Ihere
have been some incidents in
France of government seizure of
newspapers which publish opin
ions criticizing the French role
in the Algerian war.
When a newspaper contains an
article with information which
the government feels is danger
ous for the nation, all the copies
of the particular issue are seized
and banned from the public until
the offensive article is replaced
by either another story or a blank
space.
These seizures, says Kayser, are
based on the fact that the gov
ernment acts as though there was
a state of war between France
and Algeria. 1) u ring wartime,
when certain publications contain
material which is harmful to the
morale of the country and Arin<Ml
Forces, or threatens the success
of the campaign, the government
feels justified in removing the
publication from public consump
tion.
In the past, for reasons both
psychological and judicial, there
has been no court appeal by news
papers to evaluate the justice of
the seizures, nor hearings for
financial compensation to cover
the staggering expense to news
papers for seizures.
"Naturally," adds Kayser,
"many French journalists and in
tellectuals are agitating for a new
law prohibiting seizures and, in
any case, organizing court hear
ings to determine the justice of
the seizures."
One of the most famous seizure
controversies concerned the book,
"The Question," by Henri Alleg.
Alleg was imprisoned in Algeria,
and tortured by the French army,
which hoped to gain important
intelligence information from
him. Alleg smuggled from the
prison his story of the widespread
and brutal methods used by the
French against political prisoners.
His point was that the French

civilians must know what cruel
ties were being committed in their
name, and he posed the question
of whether any man has the right
to torture another for informa
tion.
"La Question." complete with
an introduction by Jean Paul Sar
tre, was published in France and
seized and banned by the French
government.
When asked about this book,
Kayser said that he thinks that
most Frenchmen were able to ob
tain the book "clandestinely" and
that most civilians became aware
of the tortures employed by the
French in Algeria.
"La Question," despite its seiz
ure, was a shock to the French
people, and soon afterward Gen
eral DeGaulle and other govern
ment officials called for a cease
of such practices in Algeria. For
a time there was a letup. Kayser
added, however, that he is not
sure whether such tortures still
exist in Algeria.
Kayser noted, thong h, that
When "military operations are
widespread and isolated one from
the other without regular con
trol," there are always times when
hands of fighting men are sepa
rated from commands, and the
methods they use to secure infor
mation from enemy prisoners
may be kept secret from out
siders.
Sartre, Francoise Sagan and
many other French intellectuals
and writers are outspokenly
against the French use of torture
in Algeria, and against the war
itself. Often publications carrying
their opinions are seized.
However, Kayser pointed out,
Sartre's opinions are far better
known because of their seizure
than if they were freely circu
lated. This case is similar to the
notorious Dreyfus Case at the end
of the last century, when another
great writer, Emile Zola, was out
spoken against the government
policy and methods. But Sartre,
says Kayser, is not as widely
known in France as was Zola—
but he might become so if the
publicity given his work contin
ues.
Kayser also explained that if
there were no war situation in
France now, there would be much
larger-scale indignation over seiz
ures of publications than now ex
ists.

against the French use of torture
in Algeria, and against the war
itself. Often publications carrying
their opinions are seized.
However, Kayser pointed out,
Sartre's opinions are far better
known because of their seizure
than if they were freely circu
lated. This case is similar to the
notorious Dreyfus Case at the end
of the last century, when another
great writer, Emile Zola, was out
spoken against the government
policy and methods. But Sartre,
says Kayser, is not as widely
known in France as was Zola—
but he might become so if the
publicity given his work contin
ues.
Kayser also explained that if
there were no war situation in
France now, there would be much
larger-scale indignation over seiz
ures of publications than now ex
ists.
Some problems facing freedom
of the press in France were dis
cussed in an interview with Pro
fessor Jacques Kayser, Deputy
Director of the French Press In
stitute at the University of Paris,
who has been in residence at
Stanford for the last month and
who spoke at the Tuesday Eve
ning Series this week.
In the past few years, Ihere
have been some incidents in
France of government seizure of
newspapers which publish opin
ions criticizing the French role
in the Algerian war.
When a newspaper contains an
article with information which
the government feels is danger
ous for the nation, all the copies
of the particular issue are seized
and banned from the public until
the offensive article is replaced
by either another story or a blank
space.
These seizures, says Kayser, are
based on the fact that the gov
ernment acts as though there was
a state of war between France
and Algeria. 1) u ring wartime,
when certain publications contain
material which is harmful to the
morale of the country and Arin<Ml
Forces, or threatens the success
of the campaign, the government
feels justified in removing the
publication from public consump
tion.
In the past, for reasons both
psychological and judicial, there
has been no court appeal by news
papers to evaluate the justice of
the seizures, nor hearings for
financial compensation to cover
the staggering expense to news
papers for seizures.
"Naturally," adds Kayser,
"many French journalists and in
tellectuals are agitating for a new
law prohibiting seizures and, in
any case, organizing court hear
ings to determine the justice of
the seizures."
One of the most famous seizure
controversies concerned the book,
"The Question," by Henri Alleg.
Alleg was imprisoned in Algeria,
and tortured by the French army,
which hoped to gain important
intelligence information from
him. Alleg smuggled from the
prison his story of the widespread
and brutal methods used by the
French against political prisoners.
His point was that the French

civilians must know what cruel
ties were being committed in their
name, and he posed the question
of whether any man has the right
to torture another for informa
tion.
"La Question." complete with
an introduction by Jean Paul Sar
tre, was published in France and
seized and banned by the French
government.
When asked about this book,
Kayser said that he thinks that
most Frenchmen were able to ob
tain the book "clandestinely" and
that most civilians became aware
of the tortures employed by the
French in Algeria.
"La Question," despite its seiz
ure, was a shock to the French
people, and soon afterward Gen
eral DeGaulle and other govern
ment officials called for a cease
of such practices in Algeria. For
a time there was a letup. Kayser
added, however, that he is not
sure whether such tortures still
exist in Algeria.
Kayser noted, thong h, that
When "military operations are
widespread and isolated one from
the other without regular con
trol," there are always times when
hands of fighting men are sepa
rated from commands, and the
methods they use to secure infor
mation from enemy prisoners
may be kept secret from out
siders.
Sartre, Francoise Sagan and
many other French intellectuals
and writers are outspokenly
against the French use of torture
in Algeria, and against the war
itself. Often publications carrying

French in Algeria.
"La Question," despite its seiz
ure, was a shock to the French
people, and soon afterward Gen
eral DeGaulle and other govern
ment officials called for a cease
of such practices in Algeria. For
a time there was a letup. Kayser
added, however, that he is not
sure whether such tortures still
exist in Algeria.
Kayser noted, thong h, that
When "military operations are
widespread and isolated one from
the other without regular con
trol," there are always times when
hands of fighting men are sepa
rated from commands, and the
methods they use to secure infor
mation from enemy prisoners
may be kept secret from out
siders.
Sartre, Francoise Sagan and
many other French intellectuals
and writers are outspokenly
against the French use of torture
in Algeria, and against the war
itself. Often publications carrying
their opinions are seized.
However, Kayser pointed out,
Sartre's opinions are far better
known because of their seizure
than if they were freely circu
lated. This case is similar to the
notorious Dreyfus Case at the end
of the last century, when another
great writer, Emile Zola, was out
spoken against the government
policy and methods. But Sartre,
says Kayser, is not as widely
known in France as was Zola—
but he might become so if the
publicity given his work contin
ues.
Kayser also explained that if
there were no war situation in
France now, there would be much
larger-scale indignation over seiz
ures of publications than now ex
ists.
Some problems facing freedom
of the press in France were dis
cussed in an interview with Pro
fessor Jacques Kayser, Deputy
Director of the French Press In
stitute at the University of Paris,
who has been in residence at
Stanford for the last month and
who spoke at the Tuesday Eve
ning Series this week.
In the past few years, Ihere
have been some incidents in
France of government seizure of
newspapers which publish opin
ions criticizing the French role
in the Algerian war.
When a newspaper contains an
article with information which
the government feels is danger
ous for the nation, all the copies
of the particular issue are seized
and banned from the public until
the offensive article is replaced
by either another story or a blank
space.
These seizures, says Kayser, are
based on the fact that the gov
ernment acts as though there was
a state of war between France
and Algeria. 1) u ring wartime,
when certain publications contain
material which is harmful to the
morale of the country and Arin<Ml
Forces, or threatens the success
of the campaign, the government
feels justified in removing the
publication from public consump
tion.
In the past, for reasons both
psychological and judicial, there
has been no court appeal by news
papers to evaluate the justice of
the seizures, nor hearings for
financial compensation to cover
the staggering expense to news
papers for seizures.
"Naturally," adds Kayser,
"many French journalists and in
tellectuals are agitating for a new
law prohibiting seizures and, in
any case, organizing court hear
ings to determine the justice of
the seizures."
One of the most famous seizure
controversies concerned the book,
"The Question," by Henri Alleg.
Alleg was imprisoned in Algeria,
and tortured by the French army,
which hoped to gain important
intelligence information from
him. Alleg smuggled from the
prison his story of the widespread
and brutal methods used by the
French against political prisoners.
His point was that the French

civilians must know what cruel
ties were being committed in their
name, and he posed the question
of whether any man has the right
to torture another for informa
tion.
"La Question." complete with
an introduction by Jean Paul Sar
tre, was published in France and
seized and banned by the French
government.
When asked about this book,
Kayser said that he thinks that
most Frenchmen were able to ob
tain the book "clandestinely" and
that most civilians became aware
of the tortures employed by the
French in Algeria.
"La Question," despite its seiz
ure, was a shock to the French
people, and soon afterward Gen
eral DeGaulle and other govern
ment officials called for a cease
