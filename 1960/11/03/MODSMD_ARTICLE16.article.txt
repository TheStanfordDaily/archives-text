## Integrated Theater 
### 
Negroes have long been accept-1
eel and applauded in the musical |
entertainment world. Our most i
famous jazz musicians and blues j
singers are Negroes, as well as!
many outstanding folk-singers |
and concert artists (though the
latter are far from numerous). I
However, another area of en
tertainment, the theater, remains!
one in which the Negro has many i
obstacles to meet unless he or she
is content with a few servant or
"native" roles, Negro streotypes,
some very minor parts or the
few plays written for all-or pre
dominantly-Negro casts.
Lorraine Hansberry's pr i z e
winning "A Kaisin in the Sun,"
which appeared on Broadway last
year, is an outstanding example
of good drama designed for a
Negro east. Hut Miss Hansberry
also looks forward to the day
when a east will l>e chosen on
ability—not race.
"Our theater must attain a suf
ficient degree of maturity and
sophistication to put aside artifi
cial barriers, to acknowledge that
any truly qualified actor, Negro j
or white, . . . can do the job."
In the musical-theater field,
casts are becoming integrated
more frequently in little theater
groups especially—but only in the
chorus. And again, this is more
in the area of music than drama.
One of the pioneers in interra
cial casting is a San Francisco
group, the Mission Community!
Players, who will present the;
George Kaufman-Moss Hart com-;
edy "George Washington Slept i
Here" at the Palo Alto High'
School this Saturday.
A thoroughly integrated group,
the Mission Players east for abil
ity, regardless of ethnic origin.
"Since audience imagination will
often provide scenery for a bare

stage, accept a white Othello or
a European Madam Butterfly, so
this company relies on good act
ing alone to capture reality in the
theater," according to a spokes
man for the group.
Thus, the Players have enlarged
the field of talent from which to
draw in the community, while
providing opportunity for those
handicapped by the predominance
of plays traditionally calling for
all-white casts in the American
theater.
The group is being brought to
Palo Alto by the newly-formed
Zizam Associates, sponsors of a
drama workshop in the Los Altos
area.
The play will begin at 8:30 Sat
urday night. Tickets, priced at
51.50, may be obtained at the
Peninsula Box Office at Town and
Country Village or by calling
WHitecliff 8-4069.

Another weekend attraction in
this area is the Menlo Players'
production of "Doctor in the
House," a new comedy by Ted
Willis which had a successful run
in 1956 in London, following
which it was made into a movie.
Playing at the Burgess Theater
in the Menlo Park Civic Center
Friday and Saturday and Nov. 11
and 12 at 8:30 p.m., the produc
tion is being directed by Clifford
Ashby, a Ph.D. candidate at Stan
ford and consultant to Foothills
College. Student tickets are priced
at $1, on sale at the box office
or at DA 2-8016 or 6-1846.
Sunday evening at 7:30, Arthur
Miller's "A View From the
Bridge" will be presented by
Comedia Repertory Co. in the
Loft Theater, Emerson at Hamil
ton in Palo Alto. Tickets for the
drama are available by calling
DA 6-8317.
