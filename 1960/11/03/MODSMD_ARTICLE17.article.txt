On Friday at Philadelphia Mr.
Eisenhower made his first frankly
political speech. The climax of
the speech was a challenge and
a charge. The challenge was to
ask how the Democratic pledges
are to be paid for. The charge was
the Democrats are responsible for
the recent speculation in gold on
the London market.
According to Mr. Eisenhower,
the Democratic pledges which call
for greater expenditures on de
fense, education, medical care,
and other civilian public needs,
can be paid for in only one of
three ways. One way is to raise
taxes. Another way is to run a
deficit and print money. Another
way is to cut existing government
programs. We may dismiss the
last two. Nobody around Mr. Ken
nedy that I know of is in favor
of deficit financing, except of
course as an emergency measure
in case the present slump devel
ops into a severe recession. There
is, furthermore, no prospect of
any substantial cut in existing
programs, especially since the
farm problem is so acute and so
difficult to handle.
Thus, according to Mr. Eisen
hower's reasoning, Sen. Kennedy
must choose between raising
! taxes and abandoning his pro
gram.
This is a debater's dilemma, one
worked up by a speech writer,
which quite misses the realities
of the problem. The true Kennedy
position, as against Mr. Eisen
hower's challenge, is plain enough
from his own speeches and from
' the writings of the extraordinarily
able group of economists who ad
vise him.
Kennedy intends to pay for his
program il) by raising taxes, so
cial security taxes, to finance
care; (2) by taking in more rev
enue as result of a reform of the
i tax structure which will not only
close the well-known loophole
somewhat, but will strengthen
I economic growth by tax incentives
I to capital investment; and (3) by
I encouraging and stimulating the
growth of the economy in order
to put an end to the sorry record
of three recessions in the past
seven and a half years. If the
economy can grow, since it has
idle plants and idle men, it will
produce profits and income which
will increase the government's
revenues from the existing cor
porate and income tax structure.
However, if the economy re
mains sluggish and depressed, if
reform of the tax law fails, then
the vitally necessary program for
defense, education, and for other
public needs will have to be paid
for by increasing taxes and slow
ing up the improvement in the
private standard of life. If neces
sary these public needs must be
met by private sacrifice. Defense,
education, health, resources devel
opment, and urban renewal are
in the minds of the Kennedy Dem
ocrats a first priority, and they
come ahead of a continually ris
ing private standard of consump
tion.
It is significant that in issuing
this challenge Mr. Eisenhower
never mentioned at all the idea
that these programs can be paid
for by stimulating the American
economy to produce more wealth.
Mr. Eisenhower says it is already
producing a great deal of wealth.
So it is. But its average rate of
growth under Eisenhower has
been less than 3 per cent a year,
which is less than the national
average for over a century, which
is less than that of virtually all
of our industrial competitors in
the world market.
The reason Mr. Eisenhower did
not mention economic growth as
a way to pay for these programs
is that his administration has de
liberately adopted a policy of com
batting inflation by depressing
the economy. The Administration
has no program for combatting
inflation in a flourishing econo

my, and Mr. Eisenhower has come
to believe that in order not to
have inflation there must be a
kind of chronic depression. That
is why he can never afford to
meet the needs of our rapidly
growing population. That is why
the progressive Eisenhower of
1952 and 1956 is now far to the
right of the late Sen. Robert Taft.
Mr. Elsenhower's speech also
contained a grave accusation. It
was that the gold speculation in
England and the outflow of gold
from the United States are due
to the Democratic platform and
to Mr. Kennedy's speeches. This
is quite unworthy of the Presi
dent of the United Slates. Gold
had been leav in g the United
States for about ten years, and
in large quantities since 1958. The
gold problem is President Eisen
hower's responsibility ami not
Sen. Kennedy's.
It is a difficult problem and
it will not be solved easily. It
arises from the fact that our ex
port surplus is not big enough
to sustain our military and eco
nomic commitments abroad and
to sustain the outflow of Ameri
can capital to the European Com
mon Market and elsewhere.
There is no quick, sure, and
easy way to correct this imbal
ance. It will require measures con
certed with other nations to econ
omize the use of gold. It will re
quire measures to induce Ger
many, Italy, Japan, France, Brit
ain, and Canada to make a much
bigger contribution to collective
security and to the financing of
the underdeveloped nations. In
view of the general condition of
the world economy, too great a
proportion of the burden is upon
us.
The one tiling thai correcting
the situation will not require is
a devaluation of the dollar and a
rise in the price of gold. My own
certainty about this conies not
only from Mr. Kennedy's decla
rations Inil much more from the
reasons behind them. He and his
advisers realize that if the United
Stales were to devalue the dollar,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, and all the rest would in
stantly d e v a I ii e in proportion,
leaving us no better off than when

we started. On the other hand, a
rise in the price of sold, without
doing any good whatever to us
and much harm, would be an
enormous gift to the two great
gold-producing' nations, namely
the Union of South Africa and
the Soviet Union. Nobody is in
the mood to subsidize them,

in case the present slump devel
ops into a severe recession. There
is, furthermore, no prospect of
any substantial cut in existing
programs, especially since the
farm problem is so acute and so
difficult to handle.
Thus, according to Mr. Eisen
hower's reasoning, Sen. Kennedy
must choose between raising
! taxes and abandoning his pro
gram.
This is a debater's dilemma, one
worked up by a speech writer,
which quite misses the realities
of the problem. The true Kennedy
position, as against Mr. Eisen
hower's challenge, is plain enough
from his own speeches and from
' the writings of the extraordinarily
able group of economists who ad
vise him.
Kennedy intends to pay for his
program il) by raising taxes, so
cial security taxes, to finance
care; (2) by taking in more rev
enue as result of a reform of the
i tax structure which will not only
close the well-known loophole
somewhat, but will strengthen
I economic growth by tax incentives
I to capital investment; and (3) by
I encouraging and stimulating the
growth of the economy in order
to put an end to the sorry record
of three recessions in the past
seven and a half years. If the
economy can grow, since it has
idle plants and idle men, it will
produce profits and income which
will increase the government's
revenues from the existing cor
porate and income tax structure.
However, if the economy re
mains sluggish and depressed, if
reform of the tax law fails, then
the vitally necessary program for
defense, education, and for other
public needs will have to be paid
for by increasing taxes and slow
ing up the improvement in the
private standard of life. If neces
sary these public needs must be
met by private sacrifice. Defense,
education, health, resources devel
opment, and urban renewal are
in the minds of the Kennedy Dem
ocrats a first priority, and they
come ahead of a continually ris
ing private standard of consump
tion.
It is significant that in issuing
this challenge Mr. Eisenhower
never mentioned at all the idea
that these programs can be paid
for by stimulating the American
economy to produce more wealth.
Mr. Eisenhower says it is already
producing a great deal of wealth.
So it is. But its average rate of
growth under Eisenhower has
been less than 3 per cent a year,
which is less than the national
average for over a century, which
is less than that of virtually all
of our industrial competitors in
the world market.
The reason Mr. Eisenhower did
not mention economic growth as
a way to pay for these programs
is that his administration has de
liberately adopted a policy of com
batting inflation by depressing
the economy. The Administration
has no program for combatting
inflation in a flourishing econo

my, and Mr. Eisenhower has come
to believe that in order not to
have inflation there must be a
kind of chronic depression. That
is why he can never afford to
meet the needs of our rapidly
growing population. That is why
the progressive Eisenhower of
1952 and 1956 is now far to the
right of the late Sen. Robert Taft.
Mr. Elsenhower's speech also
contained a grave accusation. It
was that the gold speculation in
England and the outflow of gold
from the United States are due
to the Democratic platform and
to Mr. Kennedy's speeches. This
is quite unworthy of the Presi
dent of the United Slates. Gold
had been leav in g the United
States for about ten years, and
in large quantities since 1958. The
gold problem is President Eisen
hower's responsibility ami not
Sen. Kennedy's.
It is a difficult problem and
it will not be solved easily. It
arises from the fact that our ex
port surplus is not big enough
to sustain our military and eco
nomic commitments abroad and
to sustain the outflow of Ameri
can capital to the European Com
mon Market and elsewhere.
There is no quick, sure, and
easy way to correct this imbal
ance. It will require measures con
certed with other nations to econ
omize the use of gold. It will re
quire measures to induce Ger
many, Italy, Japan, France, Brit
ain, and Canada to make a much
bigger contribution to collective
security and to the financing of
the underdeveloped nations. In
view of the general condition of
the world economy, too great a
proportion of the burden is upon
us.
The one tiling thai correcting
the situation will not require is
a devaluation of the dollar and a
rise in the price of gold. My own
certainty about this conies not
only from Mr. Kennedy's decla
rations Inil much more from the
reasons behind them. He and his
advisers realize that if the United
Stales were to devalue the dollar,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, and all the rest would in
stantly d e v a I ii e in proportion,
leaving us no better off than when

we started. On the other hand, a
rise in the price of sold, without
doing any good whatever to us
and much harm, would be an
enormous gift to the two great
gold-producing' nations, namely
the Union of South Africa and
the Soviet Union. Nobody is in
the mood to subsidize them,

care; (2) by taking in more rev

close the well-known loophole
somewhat, but will strengthen

growth of the economy in order
to put an end to the sorry record
of three recessions in the past
seven and a half years. If the
economy can grow, since it has
idle plants and idle men, it will
produce profits and income which
will increase the government's
revenues from the existing cor
porate and income tax structure.
However, if the economy re
mains sluggish and depressed, if
reform of the tax law fails, then
the vitally necessary program for
defense, education, and for other
public needs will have to be paid
for by increasing taxes and slow
ing up the improvement in the
private standard of life. If neces
sary these public needs must be
met by private sacrifice. Defense,
education, health, resources devel
opment, and urban renewal are
in the minds of the Kennedy Dem
ocrats a first priority, and they
come ahead of a continually ris
ing private standard of consump
tion.
It is significant that in issuing
this challenge Mr. Eisenhower
never mentioned at all the idea
that these programs can be paid
for by stimulating the American
economy to produce more wealth.
Mr. Eisenhower says it is already
producing a great deal of wealth.
So it is. But its average rate of
growth under Eisenhower has
been less than 3 per cent a year,
which is less than the national
average for over a century, which
is less than that of virtually all
of our industrial competitors in
the world market.
The reason Mr. Eisenhower did
not mention economic growth as
a way to pay for these programs
is that his administration has de
liberately adopted a policy of com
batting inflation by depressing
the economy. The Administration
has no program for combatting
inflation in a flourishing econo

my, and Mr. Eisenhower has come
to believe that in order not to
have inflation there must be a
kind of chronic depression. That
is why he can never afford to
meet the needs of our rapidly
growing population. That is why
the progressive Eisenhower of
1952 and 1956 is now far to the
right of the late Sen. Robert Taft.
Mr. Elsenhower's speech also
contained a grave accusation. It
was that the gold speculation in
England and the outflow of gold
from the United States are due
to the Democratic platform and
to Mr. Kennedy's speeches. This
is quite unworthy of the Presi
dent of the United Slates. Gold
had been leav in g the United
States for about ten years, and
in large quantities since 1958. The
gold problem is President Eisen
hower's responsibility ami not
Sen. Kennedy's.
It is a difficult problem and
it will not be solved easily. It
arises from the fact that our ex
port surplus is not big enough
to sustain our military and eco
nomic commitments abroad and
to sustain the outflow of Ameri
can capital to the European Com
mon Market and elsewhere.
There is no quick, sure, and
easy way to correct this imbal
ance. It will require measures con
certed with other nations to econ
omize the use of gold. It will re
quire measures to induce Ger
many, Italy, Japan, France, Brit
ain, and Canada to make a much
bigger contribution to collective
security and to the financing of
the underdeveloped nations. In
view of the general condition of
the world economy, too great a
proportion of the burden is upon
us.
The one tiling thai correcting
the situation will not require is
a devaluation of the dollar and a
rise in the price of gold. My own
certainty about this conies not
only from Mr. Kennedy's decla
rations Inil much more from the
reasons behind them. He and his
advisers realize that if the United
Stales were to devalue the dollar,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, and all the rest would in
stantly d e v a I ii e in proportion,
leaving us no better off than when

we started. On the other hand, a
rise in the price of sold, without
doing any good whatever to us
and much harm, would be an
enormous gift to the two great
gold-producing' nations, namely
the Union of South Africa and
the Soviet Union. Nobody is in
the mood to subsidize them,

On Friday at Philadelphia Mr.
Eisenhower made his first frankly
political speech. The climax of
the speech was a challenge and
a charge. The challenge was to
ask how the Democratic pledges
are to be paid for. The charge was
the Democrats are responsible for
the recent speculation in gold on
the London market.
According to Mr. Eisenhower,
the Democratic pledges which call
for greater expenditures on de
fense, education, medical care,
and other civilian public needs,
can be paid for in only one of
three ways. One way is to raise
taxes. Another way is to run a
deficit and print money. Another
way is to cut existing government
programs. We may dismiss the
last two. Nobody around Mr. Ken
nedy that I know of is in favor
of deficit financing, except of
course as an emergency measure
in case the present slump devel
ops into a severe recession. There
is, furthermore, no prospect of
any substantial cut in existing
programs, especially since the
farm problem is so acute and so
difficult to handle.
Thus, according to Mr. Eisen
hower's reasoning, Sen. Kennedy
must choose between raising
! taxes and abandoning his pro
gram.
This is a debater's dilemma, one
worked up by a speech writer,
which quite misses the realities
of the problem. The true Kennedy
position, as against Mr. Eisen

public needs will have to be paid
for by increasing taxes and slow
ing up the improvement in the
private standard of life. If neces
sary these public needs must be
met by private sacrifice. Defense,
education, health, resources devel
opment, and urban renewal are
in the minds of the Kennedy Dem
ocrats a first priority, and they
come ahead of a continually ris
ing private standard of consump
tion.
It is significant that in issuing
this challenge Mr. Eisenhower
never mentioned at all the idea
that these programs can be paid
for by stimulating the American
economy to produce more wealth.
Mr. Eisenhower says it is already
producing a great deal of wealth.
So it is. But its average rate of
growth under Eisenhower has
been less than 3 per cent a year,
which is less than the national
average for over a century, which
is less than that of virtually all
of our industrial competitors in
the world market.
The reason Mr. Eisenhower did
not mention economic growth as
a way to pay for these programs
is that his administration has de
liberately adopted a policy of com
batting inflation by depressing
the economy. The Administration
has no program for combatting
inflation in a flourishing econo

my, and Mr. Eisenhower has come
to believe that in order not to
have inflation there must be a
kind of chronic depression. That
is why he can never afford to
meet the needs of our rapidly
growing population. That is why
the progressive Eisenhower of
1952 and 1956 is now far to the
right of the late Sen. Robert Taft.
Mr. Elsenhower's speech also
contained a grave accusation. It
was that the gold speculation in
England and the outflow of gold
from the United States are due
to the Democratic platform and
to Mr. Kennedy's speeches. This
is quite unworthy of the Presi
dent of the United Slates. Gold
had been leav in g the United
States for about ten years, and
in large quantities since 1958. The
gold problem is President Eisen
hower's responsibility ami not
Sen. Kennedy's.
It is a difficult problem and
it will not be solved easily. It
arises from the fact that our ex
port surplus is not big enough
to sustain our military and eco
nomic commitments abroad and
to sustain the outflow of Ameri
can capital to the European Com
mon Market and elsewhere.
There is no quick, sure, and
easy way to correct this imbal
ance. It will require measures con
certed with other nations to econ
omize the use of gold. It will re
quire measures to induce Ger
many, Italy, Japan, France, Brit
ain, and Canada to make a much
bigger contribution to collective
security and to the financing of
the underdeveloped nations. In
view of the general condition of
the world economy, too great a
proportion of the burden is upon
us.
The one tiling thai correcting
the situation will not require is
a devaluation of the dollar and a
rise in the price of gold. My own
certainty about this conies not
only from Mr. Kennedy's decla
rations Inil much more from the
reasons behind them. He and his
advisers realize that if the United
Stales were to devalue the dollar,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, and all the rest would in
stantly d e v a I ii e in proportion,
leaving us no better off than when

we started. On the other hand, a
rise in the price of sold, without
doing any good whatever to us
and much harm, would be an
enormous gift to the two great
gold-producing' nations, namely
the Union of South Africa and
the Soviet Union. Nobody is in
the mood to subsidize them,

On Friday at Philadelphia Mr.
Eisenhower made his first frankly
political speech. The climax of
the speech was a challenge and
a charge. The challenge was to
ask how the Democratic pledges
are to be paid for. The charge was
the Democrats are responsible for
the recent speculation in gold on
the London market.
According to Mr. Eisenhower,
the Democratic pledges which call
for greater expenditures on de
fense, education, medical care,
and other civilian public needs,
can be paid for in only one of
three ways. One way is to raise
taxes. Another way is to run a
deficit and print money. Another
way is to cut existing government
programs. We may dismiss the
last two. Nobody around Mr. Ken
nedy that I know of is in favor
of deficit financing, except of
course as an emergency measure
in case the present slump devel
ops into a severe recession. There
is, furthermore, no prospect of
any substantial cut in existing
programs, especially since the
farm problem is so acute and so
difficult to handle.
Thus, according to Mr. Eisen
hower's reasoning, Sen. Kennedy
must choose between raising
! taxes and abandoning his pro
gram.
This is a debater's dilemma, one
worked up by a speech writer,
which quite misses the realities
of the problem. The true Kennedy
position, as against Mr. Eisen
hower's challenge, is plain enough
from his own speeches and from
' the writings of the extraordinarily
able group of economists who ad
vise him.
Kennedy intends to pay for his
program il) by raising taxes, so
cial security taxes, to finance
care; (2) by taking in more rev
enue as result of a reform of the
i tax structure which will not only
close the well-known loophole
somewhat, but will strengthen
I economic growth by tax incentives
I to capital investment; and (3) by
I encouraging and stimulating the
growth of the economy in order
to put an end to the sorry record
of three recessions in the past
seven and a half years. If the
economy can grow, since it has
idle plants and idle men, it will
produce profits and income which
will increase the government's
revenues from the existing cor
porate and income tax structure.
However, if the economy re
mains sluggish and depressed, if
reform of the tax law fails, then
the vitally necessary program for
defense, education, and for other
public needs will have to be paid
for by increasing taxes and slow
ing up the improvement in the
private standard of life. If neces
sary these public needs must be
met by private sacrifice. Defense,
education, health, resources devel
opment, and urban renewal are
in the minds of the Kennedy Dem
ocrats a first priority, and they
come ahead of a continually ris
