Editor, the Daily:
Much has been said about the
campaign being waged by the two
presidential candidates, with the
"proven-true-blue Eisenhower Ad
ministration" versus "the New
Frontier." I should like to put
forth what I consider as the plat
form of the "Old Frontier," a
group of Americans who seem
to number too few for. comfort
today. For these Americans the
mosl important issue in any cam
paign, is whether the majority of
citizens vote for the worth of the
individual or the supremacy of
the collectivity. Everytime the lat
ter wins, the former loses, liter
ally.
Ayn Rand lias set forth many
of the principles of the "platform"
in her controversial novel "Atlas
Shrugged." A short statement by
an unknown author sets forth the
basic tenets of every "Old Fron
tiersmen": "I do not choose to
be a common man. It is my right
to be uncommon—if I can. I seek
opportunity, not security. I do
not wish to be a kept citizen, hum
bled and dulled by having the

state look after me. I want to
take the calculated risk, to dream
and to build, to fail and to suc
ceed. I refuse to barter incentive
for a dole. I prefer the challenges
of life to the guranteed existence,
the thrill of fulfillment to the
stale calm of Utopia. 1 will not
trade freedom for beneficence,
nor dignity for a handout. It is
my heritage to think and act for
myself, enjoy the benefit of my
creations, and to face the world
boldly and say, 'this I have done'."

1 should like to say a word com
mending the African Desk of the
lIR for the splendid work it is
doing, particularly its efforts to
have Africans at Stanford speak
in the living groups and the pro
posed exchange plan with stu
dents in African universities. Af
rica is a crucial area of world
tensions and the lIR should be
supported by students and faculty
alike in its admirable aitempts to
awaken our interests and concern.

My wife and I returned for the
Homecoming and had the hearten
ing experience of witnessing the
fine backing which the student
body gave to the football team in
its game with USC last Saturday.
It was a refreshing experience. I
wish you would thank the student

body for us and remind them that
spirit and desire are qualities
which will stand oach of them in
good stead throughout their lives.
