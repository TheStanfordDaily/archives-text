# Nixon vs. Kennedy Battle Continues With 3000 Miles Between Opponents
## Nixon Slashes at Democrat For Slurring Ike's Record 
### 
NEW YORK (UPI i Vice President Richard M. Nixon last night
unleashed one of his strongest direct attacks to date on his Demo
cratic opponent Sen. John F. Kennedy, and accused Kennedy of at
tempting to tear down President Eisenhower's record as part of his
campaign.
Nixon told a howling audience in New York's huge Columbus I

Circle Coliseum that he did not
mind Kennedy's attacks on him
but "those things he says about
President Eisenhower, 1 resent
and the American peonle resent."
Nixon was left with only 90
â€¢seconds of the extensive TV time
the Republicans had bought for
the huge rally featuring him and
Eisenhower, but he spoke for 15
minutes afterward to the roaring
cheers of the crowd with Eisen
hower grinning and nodding his
approval.
When he finally launched into
his full political speech, the vice
president unleashed much the
same attack on Kennedy he has
been employing on the stump. He
termed the Democratic standard
bearer "arrogant . . . despicable
. . . irresponsible."
Nixon charged Kennedy's claim
that the United States is,headed
for an economic slump is the
moKt "despicable or irresponsible"
statement the candidate has made.
NIXON SAID for example, re
cent automobile sales figures
show that "millions of buyers
have faith in America."
"The people are right and he is
wrong." Nixon said. "We will
have no recession because he isn't
going to win."
The partisan crowd, infiltrated
by a noisy segment of Kennedy
rooters at times, roared approval
as Nixon said Kennedy's reces
sion talk is "like the neighbor
hood boy saying he wants to con
sult the fire chief about putting
out a fire he has already started."
RAMMING hard at some of
Kennedy's campaign statements,
Nixon said the youthful Massa
chusetts senator has disagreed
with Eisenhower's foreign poliey
on several counts. Nixon said
"The president refused to apol
ogize for the U-2 flight" over Rus
sia but Kennedy said "he could
have apologized, could have ex
pressed regret ... I think the
president is right."
Also, Nixon contended, Ken
nedy's voiced views on the policy
toward Fidel Castro's Cuban gov
ernment "would have lost us all
our friends in Latin America"
and through what he termed vio
lations of U.S. treaty obligations
in that area, "the Communists
would have a good excuse for
coming in."
