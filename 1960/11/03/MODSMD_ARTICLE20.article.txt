# Jardon Talk on Cuba Controversial; Other Side of Issue Aired Tonight
## 
### WILLIAM HAWTHORNE HR International Conference Division 
When discussing the issues of
U.S. foreign policy, we very often
have a tendency to speak of an
action only in terms of its posi
tive or negative effect on our own
position. Last Thursday night Dr.
Caesar Jardon, â– speaking about
the Cuban situation before an
overflow crowd in the Women's
Clubhouse, tried to give us a basis
to make our decision not in terms
of Ihe effect on ourselves but in
terms of the effect on the Cuban
people.
Jordan, a physician and clinical
psychologist from the University
of Villanova, Cuba, is currently
doing research at Stanford with
a grant from the U.S. State De
partment. His talk, sponsored by
thi 1111, represented the views of
the '*7air Play for Cuba Commit
tee."
Tonight at 7:30 in Room 300,
Waldo Estrada, West Coast dele
gate for the Democratic Revolu
tionary Front, will attempt to re
fute Jardon's views.
At first many students, includ
ing myself, were a hit disap
pointed in what we felt was Jar
don's avoidance of the real issues
in deteriorating U.S.-Cuban rela
tions. Dr. Castro's presumptuous
visit to the U.S. for the current
U.N. session was not even brought
up. Jardon seemed almost uncon
cerned with Fidel Castro's lack of
provisions to pay for the nation
alized U.S. property.
If Cuba supported Russian for
eign policy it did not seem to
worry the soft-spoken Jardon.

But Jardon was concerned with
the lack of understanding the
American people have of the Cu
ban Revolution and what it has
meant to the people. He attribu
ted this primarily to the different
perspective we have for judging
the value of the revolution.
Jardon felt that we must com-,
pare the life of the average Cuban
before and after the revolution to
appreciate the changes it has
brought about. Perhaps Castro
will never pay for the nationalized
property, but the Cubans do not
care; they only know that Castro
has improved the lot of the com
mon man.
Jardon agreed that Castro is a
dictator, hut found nothing wrong j
with this, for in effect he rules, ac
cording to Jardon, with a popular
mandate of over HO per cent of
the Cubans. And even if Castro is
an aid to Russian foreign policy, ;
Jardon felt this is not too great :
a price to pay for the social revo- j
lution he wants to accomplish.
This approach to the issues I

might seem inadequate to many,
but Jardon did not intend to point
the finger of responsibility, but
to convey and understanding.
When asked what policy he fell
America should follow, Jardon re
plied, "This is not for me to 101 l
you, but for you to decide for
yourselves."
Jardon was not advocating an
exclusion of the realities of the
international situation in making
our decision. But he suggests we
might temper our policies with
understanding of what the revo
lution has meant to the Cuban
people.
If Dr. Castro and his revolution
are as popular as Caesar Jardon
claims, then perhaps we should
re-examine our present policies
toward Culm.
