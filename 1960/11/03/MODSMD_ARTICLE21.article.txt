Editor, (lie Daily:
If Mr. Lowe's somewhat frothy
treatment of a proposed role for
the United States in support of
foreign birth control programs is
meant with the same seriousness
as his closing remarks, then we
need only hope that his statement
on this subject sink quietly into
the obscurity of the Daily files.
He lias one basic real objection to
such action, and thai is the feel
ing of persecution or resentment
which could arise in a racially or
socially divided society if one
group were to introduce such
measures seemingly to control the
other.
In certain countries, his in
cluded, this is very true. In others
it is not, but in any case this calls
for tact and time, not isolation
ism.
Yes, India is incapable of "man
ufacturing contraceptives fortheir
own use." Costs to an Indian fam
ily for prevention of a child are
equivalent to those for raising
one. And any expenditure by the
Indian government only diverts
money from another urgent area.
The sole purpose of such a pro
gram would not be to "win" India
or any other country for the U.S.
notwithstanding the loose talk
about American "prestige." Man
doesn't live by bread or "things"
alone, and such intangibles as
civil peace, mental stability, op
portunities for recreation, costs of
increased social organization, etc.,
must be considered in the assets/
people equation.
It is often only outside help that
can break the bond of the poverty
population cycle, and this help is
often far more effective if applied
to population control, than to
technical development. For ex
ample:
A recent (May 1960) issue of
the "Review of Economics and
Statistics" contains a proposal for
popul a t i on control for India
through economic incentives. If
1.3 billion of the twenty billion
thai the Indian state is planning
to invest under the Third Five
Year plan were diverted to sub
sidies for vasectomy and avoid
ance of pregnancy, and this pro
gram continued for ihe following
five years, an estimated twenty
five million births would be
averted with the following re
sults:

a i Resource demands upon the I
Indian economy for this program
would be approximately one
fiftieth of those which these
twenty-five million would them
selves make; b) Capital expendi
tures, operating both through
control of the population numbers
and this investment in private
hands of so much money would
result in approximately ten times
as much effect upon the economy
as would like expenditures for
public works, etc.
The effect upon individual fam
ilies can only be imagined -two
years bonus wages could properly
raise two children to the age of
self-sufficiency.
We cannot afford not to render
aid if requested. Hopelessness and
hunger lead easily and swiftly to
the ordered cancer of Commu
nism. If population growth is not
checked, neither will be hunger
and misery, and our grandchil
dren very well might be greeting
each other "comrade."

ICditor, (lie Daily:
Presently, the "realists" who
run our government are prepar
ing for a war which even they
admit will result in total world
annihilation or at best complete
chaos. This all consuming effort,
they add. is for defensive pur
poses. Considering the weapons
presently produced for our ever
growing stockpile it seems clear
that the distinction between of
fensive and defensive war is no
longer valid.
War has become absurd and
yet the building of our war power
has become the realistic, unques
tioned principle of our govern
ment and a main plank of each
of our political parties.
It is lime for the United States
to take action instead of merely
correcting for other's actions. A
pre-stated step by step unilateral
disarmament policy and gradual
abandonment of our overseas
bases would be the starting point
of a positive program of action.
(By reducing our stockpile of
nuclear weapons by seven-eighths
we would still have more than
enough power to destroy Ihe
world i! billions of dollars saved
could be used to alleviate our own

nation's many needs and those of i
the underdeveloped countries. It
would prove to the neutral na
tions that the United States not
only talks about peace but acts
toward peace.
Our present policy can lead us
only Vj war. The question is when
in our generation or our chil
dren's?
Although the Democratic candi
date has at least seen the need
for effective, new disarmament
policies to create conditions for
peace, neither presidential candi
date has made a strong stand on
this all-important issue.

Editor, (hf Daily:
This is my third year at Stan
ford, and there has been each year
a suicide because ol' poor grades.
I would like to ask a few ques
tions:
1. How many deaths have there
been at Stanford because of de
spondency over grades?
2. What is responsible for the
deaths of those students (and the |
heartbreaking sorrow of their
families) ?
< 3. Could it be possible that
those who are supposed to give
them advice and guidance have
been indifferent to them?
4. Could it be Ihe grading sys
tem, and an over-emphasis on
grades here at Stanford?
Does Stanford aim at giving
an education or at giving grades,
and, conversely, are we coming ,
here to get an education or to get j
grades?

(J. Is grading based on some
fixed, desirable standard? Or is
it based on the relative capability
of students within a particular
section they happen to be in? li
seems the latter case is true, and
one can say that it is merely a
matter of luck, and that grades
do not accurately represent the
intellectual value of a student.
A "C" in a section of brilliant
boys may really be better than a
"B" in another section where only
poor students are taking the same
course. Furthermore, the value of
a letter grade varies from year to
year, from class to class, from
professor to professor, and from
department to department. The
grading system and the over
emphasis on grades leave some
thing to be desired.
7. If nothing is done about it,
how many more suicides are ex
pected in the future? And how
bloody will this university get?
