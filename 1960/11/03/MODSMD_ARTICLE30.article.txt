# Fat Atlas' Seeks Backing
## 
### 
While Stanford may not
have an entry in the Chron
icle's ".Fat Venus Contest,"
one of the Farm's own may
be selected as the "Fat Atlas."
Sponsored by radio station
KSFO in San Francisco, the
"Fat Atlas" competition is in
no way connected with or
sanctioned by Count Marco
and thus will have among its
participants Bill Kite hen,
more familiarly known as
The Old Boy.
Since the contest closes
tomorrow and a signature
counts as a vote, all students
with an inclination to support
Kitchen have been asked to
either send a post card to
KSFO or sign the petition
which will be available on En
gineering Corner today.
