"What happened to College of Ihe Ozarks?" Joe Gordon said. "I
can't find their score anywhere."
The sports editor of the Quad was performing what had by then
become a Sunday morning ritual; finding out how badly the College
cf the O/arks had been beaten. Bill perhaps some explanation as to
how this practice came about is in order.
As sports page addicts are aware, each week every member of the
Daily sports stuff runs down a list of upcoming college football games
and tells whom lie thinks will win. (The fact that this prognosticator
•s well on his way to having the worst record on the staff for the third
year in a "row is another story and will not be gone into now.)
Anyhow, a few years ago it became standard practice to add a
"Game of the Week" at the bottom of the list, which is a contest
like Gettysburg vs. Muhlenberg or Stout St. vs. Bemid.ji, etc.
Often it is this game that decides the prediction championship
of the week and it is well nigh impossible to find out who won until
Sunday morning, because the radio and* television score roundups
tend not to think ihetn important enough to include in their Satur
day night summaries.
At any rate Gordon, who helps us add up our losses and lick our
wounds on Sunday morning, was one day looking for the Philander
Smith-Tougaloo score and happened to notice that the College of
the Ozarks had lost to Henderson State, 48 0
Worse Than Us
Then the next week, while searching for some report on the
Grove City-Thiel battle, he saw that O/arks had lost to Conway
State, 33-0.
"Wow," Gordon said, "wonder when they last won a game."
"Gee," we said, "a team that loses by worse scores than we do."
"Hmm," Gordon said, "wonder how they'll do next week."
"<iee," we said, "a team that loses by worse scores than we do."
So it was (hat tin* above-mentioned ritual began to he performed.
But the very next week there was 110 score anywhere for the College
of the Ozarks. And the week after that too. It was too much.
"We've got to find out how they're doing," Gordon said.
"You're right," was the answer. "I'll write them a letter."
Well, after consulting the dictionary (resourceful, yes?) and
finding out that the College of the Ozarks is located in ClarksVille,
Ark., a letter was dispatched asking for full particulars on their
football team. The answer was received Monday from Vernon Me-
Daniels, sports publicity director at the College of the Ozarks.
A Sad Story
It'« a sad story, but might be a bit of encouragement to dis
gruntled Stanford fans. McDaniels says, in part . . .
"Yes, we're still losing. As a matter of fact we have lost 15 con
secutive games . . . maybe the newspapers have given up on us ever
breaking into the win column. About five years ago, we had several
winning seasons. And in the lfKiO's we had one of the better teams
in state collegiate circles. . . .
"As to the coach, he naturally has r-eeeived much criticism as
would any coach who had lost 15 consecutive games over a twn-jear
period.
. . . Our college, wth an enrollment of only slightly over- 300, is
one of the smallest colleges in the nation to field a football team.
We are surrounded by several large state and private colleges, and
thus feel we are doing well in any season in which we can hold our
own.
"The student body seemingly has become resigned to the fact
that we may have a losing team for some time to come. A fair per
centage of the student body does, however, attend the home games. .
"We here can certainly sympathize with you at Stanford."
Things are looking up at College of the Ozarks, though. Last
week they lost by only 13-0 to Ouachita Baptist. It was a moral
victory.

Anyhow, a few years ago it became standard practice to add a
"Game of the Week" at the bottom of the list, which is a contest
like Gettysburg vs. Muhlenberg or Stout St. vs. Bemid.ji, etc.
Often it is this game that decides the prediction championship
of the week and it is well nigh impossible to find out who won until
Sunday morning, because the radio and* television score roundups
tend not to think ihetn important enough to include in their Satur
day night summaries.
At any rate Gordon, who helps us add up our losses and lick our
wounds on Sunday morning, was one day looking for the Philander
Smith-Tougaloo score and happened to notice that the College of
the Ozarks had lost to Henderson State, 48 0
Worse Than Us
Then the next week, while searching for some report on the
Grove City-Thiel battle, he saw that O/arks had lost to Conway
State, 33-0.
"Wow," Gordon said, "wonder when they last won a game."
"Gee," we said, "a team that loses by worse scores than we do."
"Hmm," Gordon said, "wonder how they'll do next week."
"<iee," we said, "a team that loses by worse scores than we do."
So it was (hat tin* above-mentioned ritual began to he performed.
But the very next week there was 110 score anywhere for the College
of the Ozarks. And the week after that too. It was too much.
"We've got to find out how they're doing," Gordon said.
"You're right," was the answer. "I'll write them a letter."
Well, after consulting the dictionary (resourceful, yes?) and
finding out that the College of the Ozarks is located in ClarksVille,
Ark., a letter was dispatched asking for full particulars on their
football team. The answer was received Monday from Vernon Me-
Daniels, sports publicity director at the College of the Ozarks.

"Yes, we're still losing. As a matter of fact we have lost 15 con
secutive games . . . maybe the newspapers have given up on us ever
breaking into the win column. About five years ago, we had several
winning seasons. And in the lfKiO's we had one of the better teams
in state collegiate circles. . . .
"As to the coach, he naturally has r-eeeived much criticism as

. . . Our college, wth an enrollment of only slightly over- 300, is

victory.

Then the next week, while searching for some report on the
Grove City-Thiel battle, he saw that O/arks had lost to Conway
State, 33-0.
"Wow," Gordon said, "wonder when they last won a game."
"Gee," we said, "a team that loses by worse scores than we do."
"Hmm," Gordon said, "wonder how they'll do next week."
"<iee," we said, "a team that loses by worse scores than we do."
So it was (hat tin* above-mentioned ritual began to he performed.
But the very next week there was 110 score anywhere for the College
of the Ozarks. And the week after that too. It was too much.
"We've got to find out how they're doing," Gordon said.
"You're right," was the answer. "I'll write them a letter."
Well, after consulting the dictionary (resourceful, yes?) and
finding out that the College of the Ozarks is located in ClarksVille,
Ark., a letter was dispatched asking for full particulars on their
football team. The answer was received Monday from Vernon Me-
Daniels, sports publicity director at the College of the Ozarks.
A Sad Story
It'« a sad story, but might be a bit of encouragement to dis
gruntled Stanford fans. McDaniels says, in part . . .
"Yes, we're still losing. As a matter of fact we have lost 15 con
secutive games . . . maybe the newspapers have given up on us ever
breaking into the win column. About five years ago, we had several
winning seasons. And in the lfKiO's we had one of the better teams
in state collegiate circles. . . .
"As to the coach, he naturally has r-eeeived much criticism as
would any coach who had lost 15 consecutive games over a twn-jear
period.
. . . Our college, wth an enrollment of only slightly over- 300, is
one of the smallest colleges in the nation to field a football team.
We are surrounded by several large state and private colleges, and
thus feel we are doing well in any season in which we can hold our
own.
"The student body seemingly has become resigned to the fact
that we may have a losing team for some time to come. A fair per
centage of the student body does, however, attend the home games. .
"We here can certainly sympathize with you at Stanford."
Things are looking up at College of the Ozarks, though. Last
week they lost by only 13-0 to Ouachita Baptist. It was a moral
victory.
