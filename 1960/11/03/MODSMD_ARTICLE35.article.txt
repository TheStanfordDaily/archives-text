# BATTLE OF PORTLAND
## Resolute Cards Will Try Oregon 
### RUSS ALLEN 
Today the Stanford gridders will have light workouts and put
the finishing touches on a defense that hopes to hold the speedy
Oregon Ducks this weekend. Although they may get help from the
weatherman in a wet, muddy field, they still aren't taking the Ducks

speed lightly.
COACH Jack Curtice plans to
start essentially the same lineup
against the Webfoots that opened
against SC last weekend. The only
change to date is Tom Walsh
moving into the right guard spot
in place of Ron Fernandes. There
is some doubt whether Fernandes
will see much action against Ore
gon due to minor injuries.
Elsewhere, Dale Ostrander and
Steve Pursell will start at ends;
Jack Gordon and co-captain Dean
Hinshaw will start at tackles;
Don Peter holds down the other
guard spot; Chris Cottle at cen
ter; and Dick Norman, Mac Wylie,
Gil Dowd and Skip Face will
start in the hackfield for the
Tribe.
Sophomore end Pursell
brother of injured Tribe center;
Steve has been a pleasant sur
prise for Stanford coaches. His
fine pass-catching and aggressive
ness on defense have earned him
the mid-season starting roll.
S T A NF O R I) co-captain and
quarterback Dick Norman not
only goes after the first Card win
of the season against the Ducks
but also will try to top an indi
vidual Stanford record this Sat
urday.
Dick is 149 yards shy of John
Brodie's total passing record with
a total of 3,44G yards. Through
the 1954-56 seasons Brodie hit for
a total of 3,594 yards. Already this
year, Norman has set new Stan
ford records for most passes at
tempted and passes completed.
He now has a total of 547 passes
thrown and 298 passes completed
and will be out to lengthen his
mark. And Card receivers Ostran
der, Wylie and Face will be there
to go after Dick's pitches.
Two other sophomores have
pleased the coaching staff to date.
Tackle C. B. Simons spent quite
a bit of time in the S.C. hackfield
last weekend bringing down Tro
jan backs for losses. Fullback
Stan Lindskog's speed and decep
tion have helped the Indians in
several clashes so far this season.
FULLBACK veteran Face again
will lead Stanford rushing up
Norlh. Skip leads in Stanford
rushing with 299 net yards and a
5.16-yard per carry average. He
also leads in Card scoring with
22 total points scored.
Dowd and Hal Steuber have
gained pretty well for- the Cards.
Dowd with 269 net yards and
Steuber with 152 will hope to add
to their totals and help the under
dog Indians defeat Oregon.
