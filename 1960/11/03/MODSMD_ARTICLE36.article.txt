# McKeever Operation a Success
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES <UPI> — The
•ollegiate football career of Mike
McKeever, one of the University
of Southern California's twin line
Ail-American candidates, is at an
end.
The husky guard is in satis
factory condition at Cedars of
Lebanon Hospital after undergo
ing surgery last night to remove
a blood clot on his brain. But doc
tors said his college gridiron days
are over.
Along with his twin brother,
Marlin, Miko led the USC varsity
in defensive statistics for two
straight years. Mike also was All-
Pacific Coast last season and sec
ond-team All-American.
Dr. Marvin Korbin, Los Angeles
neurosurgeon, performed the op
eration, assisted by Dr. Thomas
Cline, Southern California team
physician, at Cedars of Lebanon
Hospital. Cline said the operation
was a success and the All-Ameri
can Trojan guard candidate was
in satisfactory condition.
CLINE said Mike told him he
was kicked in the head in last
week's Stanford game, and that
this probably "jarred the brain"
and aggravated damage resulting
from an old clot.
Ironically, a year ago Mike him

self was the target of bitter criti
cism on charges he deliberately
jumped Steve Bates in the Cali
fornia game.
The SC physician said Mike
definitely would not play any
more college football, but that it
was too early to tell whether he
could join twin Marlin in pursuit
of a professional career.
Mike and Marlin had planned a
double wedding Dec. 3. Cline said
it was possible McKeever would
be able to go ahead on schedule
with his wedding plans if there
are no further complications.
WILLIAM McKeever, father of
the football playing twins, said
"it is up to Mike" on whether he
will try to play football again.
The operation took one hour,
45 minutes.
Cline told reporters:
"The operation was performed
without any untoward incidents.
We accomplished what we set out

to do, which was an evacuation of
a blood clot that had formed on
his brain. It was major surgery,
but. the large majority of these
cases are successful."

Cline told reporters:
"The operation was performed
without any untoward incidents.
We accomplished what we set out

to do, which was an evacuation of
a blood clot that had formed on
his brain. It was major surgery,
but. the large majority of these
cases are successful."
LOS ANGELES <UPI> — The
•ollegiate football career of Mike
McKeever, one of the University
of Southern California's twin line
Ail-American candidates, is at an
end.
The husky guard is in satis
factory condition at Cedars of
Lebanon Hospital after undergo
ing surgery last night to remove
a blood clot on his brain. But doc
tors said his college gridiron days
are over.
Along with his twin brother,
Marlin, Miko led the USC varsity
in defensive statistics for two
straight years. Mike also was All-
Pacific Coast last season and sec
ond-team All-American.
Dr. Marvin Korbin, Los Angeles
neurosurgeon, performed the op
eration, assisted by Dr. Thomas
Cline, Southern California team
physician, at Cedars of Lebanon
Hospital. Cline said the operation
was a success and the All-Ameri
can Trojan guard candidate was
in satisfactory condition.
CLINE said Mike told him he
was kicked in the head in last
week's Stanford game, and that
this probably "jarred the brain"
and aggravated damage resulting
from an old clot.
Ironically, a year ago Mike him

self was the target of bitter criti
cism on charges he deliberately
jumped Steve Bates in the Cali
fornia game.
The SC physician said Mike
definitely would not play any
more college football, but that it
was too early to tell whether he
could join twin Marlin in pursuit
of a professional career.
Mike and Marlin had planned a
double wedding Dec. 3. Cline said
it was possible McKeever would
be able to go ahead on schedule
with his wedding plans if there
are no further complications.
WILLIAM McKeever, father of
the football playing twins, said
"it is up to Mike" on whether he
will try to play football again.
The operation took one hour,
45 minutes.
