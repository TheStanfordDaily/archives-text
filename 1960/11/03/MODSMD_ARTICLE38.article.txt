# HOW TO BE A MAN AMONG CLOTHES
## A 						Reprint From The San Francisco Examiner's Sunday PICTORIAL LIVING 
### John Taylor 
I have been much awed of recent months by a
succession of curiously circumspect Americans who
have flown into London, submitted me to a brisk
inquisition, whisked around a cross section of our men's
stores, and whizzed off home again.
Tall, short, fat and thin; each and all have been
seeking the "English Look."
I received the impression that such assistance as
I have rendered in their search for this Ifoly Gi.u'l
has been largely disappointing; but in such a hunt my
position is even more difficult than theirs.
For a foreigner, generalizations are relatively
simple. To the unindigenous, doubtless, all Englishmen,
like all Chinese, look identical. They all have cavalry
men's moustaches and buck teeth (all Englishmen,
that is. Few Chinese have cavalrymen's moustaches)
and lean, spare bony frames. They wear bowler hats
and hard collars, and carry brief cases and umbrellas.
To the Englishman, who regards his compatriots
with an esoteric eve, the picture is not so clear. Minor
differences, glossed over by the foreigner observer,
produce major impact in familiar surroundings. Tf you
want to find the English Look I'm not at all sure that
the Englishman isn't the last man you ought to ask.
But the problem is apparently an urgent one.
Next year, 1 am informed from several sources, the
basis of U. S. male fashion is to be the English Look
■—hence the desperate research.
The odd point about all. this is not that we are
surprised to find ourselves filling the glass of Ameri
can fashion, but that Americans are at last acknowl
edging the fact. The three most recent silhouettes to
outline American masculine stvling have all originated
on this side of the Atlantic. But only in the next one
arc we getting any credit.
Go back to the Drape Shape and let's start there:
As a positive and generalized force in masculine
fashion on both sides of the Atlantic, the Drape Shape
lived as an influence from about 1939 to about 1949.
During those vears Hollywood adopted and adapted
it as a ready ally in their practice of making everything
and every one larger than life. Drape's suggestion was
of excessive muscularity, and via the cinema screen
it became a phallic symbol as surely as the ti<rht sweat
ers that paralleled it on the other side of the fashion
fence.
Like all fashions, it exaggerated itself to death.
Hollywood btoadencd the shoulders and increased the
drape to the point where the wide screen just bad to
come. Only when it had thus made its mark on pro
duction techniques did Drape collapse at the ends and
droop with its own absurdity. Complete reaction set
in with the coming of the Tvv League.
Meanwhile, however, the ludicrous e\a<nicrations
had been flung in the world's face via the cinema
seats to the point where Drape had become known as
"American Drape." And Drape's initiator lived just
long enough to see his brain child outgrow its
strength. He died soon after the end of the \\ ar.
The man who actually 'invented Drape was an
English tailor by the name of Scholte, one-time tailor
to the then Prince of Wales who is now Duke of
Windsor. He was also tailor to the officers of the
brigade of Guards, and he had noticed that when they
belted their loose overcoats tightly at the waistline,
folds of cloth appeared in front of the armhole and
gave an impression of a deeper chest.
He incorporated these rolls of superfluous cloth,
in modified form, into the shape of his jacket — and
that's how Drape was born. As far as I am in pos
session of the facts, no Hollywood film company ever
appended his name to their list of credits.
Drape had died the good death in England some
years before it finally vanished from the screen, and
shoulders built the broad way had been replaced by
the Edwardian Look. This consisted, generally speak
ing, of quiet, dark clothes in blue or charcoal flannel;
plain white or plain pastel shirts; fancy or contrasting
waistcoats; knitted silk tics; narrow shouldered long

jackets with narrow lapels and back vents; slim
trousers.
I don't know about you — but this sounds pretty
much like the Ivy League to me.
And don't beat me with Brooks Brothers. Cer
tainly they had been making their style for years —•
but no definitive swing away from Drape came in
I . S. fashions until after Savile Row had introduced
Ldwardians.
Over here, the Edwardiar. Look died a similar
death to the Drape Shape in Anerica. It ended in a
kind of Zoot Suit which became the badge of delin
quency and sent soberer citizens hurrying to their
tailors for modification. In America the Ivv League
suffered an even worse fate, ending up as the brand
image of Madison Avenue.
So a replacement had to be found; and Savile
Row brought out the Daddy Long Legs.
Ihe Daddv Long Legs revolutionized men's
clothes bv switching the phvsical spotlight away from
the shoulder line down to the trousers. And the male
leg became as spotlit in the 50's as the female leg had
in the 20's. Trousers became so narrow as to show
the shape of the calf. Turn-ups were dispensed with
as an aid to the illusion of longer limbs and the
jacket was shortened for exactly the same reason.
Details and accessories were affected. Lapels had
to be shortened. Shoulders came into a basic natural
ness to balance up the depth of the jacket, and
beneath their slender trouser leg, shoes had to be
slendered down to conform.
Without the sociological urgings of the delin
quents to hurry them into a swift change, the L T . S.
was meantime wearing out its Ivy League clothes and
America was beaten to the punch in stealing the new
English fashions by the Italians.
A race of relatively short men, the Italians were
nuick to see the sartorial advantages in London's Daddy
Loii" Legs Look. Tts great advantage was that it made
small men look inches taller and Italy was on to it
quicker than you can say stiletto.
I heir hot Latin blood exaggerated London con
servatisms as they went along. Our short jackets now
terminated at the bin line in Italy: our rounded fronts
were slashed away like kilt jackets: and our slender
shoes were sharpened to a point where you had to
amputate a couple of toes to yet your foot in. Again
the London Look had grown to a great big ugly child.
I his time. America got it second hand. A sudden
international interest in the Italian peninsula, sparked
off largely by the sudden success of their film actresses,
focused American eyes on what has now come to be
called the Continental Look. It would be a truism,
though a nauseating one to acknowledge, for any
Savile Row tailor to look at an Italian silhouette now
adavs and murmur: "You may be ugly: but you're
mine.''
Meanwhile the idea of 1961's American citizens
pushing hard to look like a bunch of Limeys is highly
delightful. If the moustaches and the buck teeth play
an important part in the brand image, then the carnival
novelty trade is going to do as well out of it as the
garment business. If the t T . S. manufacturers can
honestly produce an overall lionest-to-goodness block
pattern out of a nation that is fat, thin, short, tall,
dark, fair, hirsute, bald, derbied. bareheaded, hard and
soft collared, tailored, jersied, booted, spurred, froc'
coated and dungarced—wake me when it'< ready.
If it helps at all, I can only submit that the
newly returning fashion influence in Loudon, aftei
nearly 20 years in the wilderness, is the double breasted
coat, and your publicists should have something there
Can't we celebrate the opening of the new season with
a modern Paul Revere, spurring the bloodied flank
of his horse through the winking windowed villages
kicking up the cobbles and crying into the night•
" The Doublebreastedcoats are coming!" a string of
warning beacons flaring out behind him all the way ('•
Saks, Fifth Avenue.
