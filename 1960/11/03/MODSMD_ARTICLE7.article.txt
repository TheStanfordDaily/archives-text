### 
WAYNESVILLE. N.C. (UPI)-
A Republican Congressional can
didate said tonight that Demo
cratic Presidential Candidate John
F. Kennedy got his idea for a
"Peace Corps" from a book dis
tributed to Congressmen in 1952.
YY e a I th y shoe manufacturer
Heinz Roliman, a former Demo
crat, said he proposed the crea
tion of a "Peace Corps" in his
book, "World Construction."
KENNEDY proposed in a
speech at San Diego, Calif., today
that an army of talented young
volunteers "from every race and
walk of life" be created to serve
in underdeveloped countries for
three years as an alternative to
military service under the draft.
Roliman, in a telegram to Ken
nedy, said he was "greatly flat
tered" that the senator proposed
the peace army "as based on my
200-page book," copies of which
were distributed to "every mem
ber of congress" in 1952.
"I WISH, however, since this
is a copyrighted book that at least
you would see fit to give me
credit for the idea you have now
adopted as one of the necessities
to help the underdeveloped coun
tries to help themselves without
know-how and experience, with
out American taxpayers having
to spend billions of dollars."
Roliman, a native of Germany,
is seeking to unseat Hep, Roy A.
Taylor, D N.C.
