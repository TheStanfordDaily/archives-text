# Kennedy for Peace Corps In Underdeveloped Countries
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) Sen. John F. Kennedy last night
proposed creation of a "Peace Corps" of talented young men to
serve in underdeveloped countries for three years as an "alternative"
to entering military service under the draft.
The Democratic presidential nominee offered his plan as he wound

up his last campaign visit to Cal
ifornia with a speech at San Fran
cisco's Cow Palace.
He charged thai the United
States under the Republicans had
been "ill-staffed and ill-repre
i sented in the struggle for peace"
!in the fields of disarmament,
i planning diplomatic and foreign
j service and technical aid to under-
I developed nations.
KENNEDY said the "Peace
| Corps" would be made up of vol
unteers—and could include tal
-1 ented young women as well as
I men "from every race and walk
j of life."
"I am convinced that our young
j men and women, dedicated to
| freedom, are fully capable of over
j coming the efforts of Mr. Khru
i shchev's missionaries who are
I dedicated to undermining that
i freedom," Kennedy said in his
prepared speech.
KENNEDY'S final late after
noon rally was in West Oakland
' where he told an excited, heavily
| Negro audience that Nixon and
! the Republican Party had done
I nothing on civil rights legislation
I during the years when they con
| trolled both Houses of Congress
i and that the Democrats want "op
| port unities for all—fairness for
j all."
EARLIER, the senator renewed
: his attacks on Vice President
Richard M. Nixon in speeches at
Los Angeles and San Diego. He
landed at the U.S. Naval Air Sta
tion, Moffett Field, South of San
Francisco, at 3:30 p.m.
During a brief stop at San Jose
before motoring to San Francisco
Kennedy encountered one of the
most enthusiastic crowds ever to
greet him in a smaller city. Sup
porters swarmed over the motor
cade, climbed to tops of cars, and
almost prevented the senator
from reaching the platform from
which he spoke.
He was cheered as he reiterated
his recent theme that President
Eisenhower "is not running" but
that the Republican candidate is
Nixon.
"We're going to tell the truth,"
; he said. "I don't care what Mr.
I Nixon says."

KENNEDY'S final late after
noon rally was in West Oakland
' where he told an excited, heavily
| Negro audience that Nixon and
! the Republican Party had done
I nothing on civil rights legislation
I during the years when they con

i and that the Democrats want "op

j all."
EARLIER, the senator renewed
: his attacks on Vice President
Richard M. Nixon in speeches at
Los Angeles and San Diego. He
landed at the U.S. Naval Air Sta
tion, Moffett Field, South of San
Francisco, at 3:30 p.m.
During a brief stop at San Jose
before motoring to San Francisco
Kennedy encountered one of the
most enthusiastic crowds ever to
greet him in a smaller city. Sup
porters swarmed over the motor
cade, climbed to tops of cars, and
almost prevented the senator
from reaching the platform from
which he spoke.
He was cheered as he reiterated
his recent theme that President
Eisenhower "is not running" but
that the Republican candidate is
Nixon.
"We're going to tell the truth,"
; he said. "I don't care what Mr.
I Nixon says."
SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) Sen. John F. Kennedy last night
proposed creation of a "Peace Corps" of talented young men to
serve in underdeveloped countries for three years as an "alternative"
to entering military service under the draft.
The Democratic presidential nominee offered his plan as he wound

up his last campaign visit to Cal
ifornia with a speech at San Fran
cisco's Cow Palace.
He charged thai the United
States under the Republicans had
been "ill-staffed and ill-repre
i sented in the struggle for peace"
!in the fields of disarmament,
i planning diplomatic and foreign
j service and technical aid to under-
I developed nations.
KENNEDY said the "Peace
| Corps" would be made up of vol
unteers—and could include tal
-1 ented young women as well as
I men "from every race and walk
j of life."
"I am convinced that our young
j men and women, dedicated to
| freedom, are fully capable of over
j coming the efforts of Mr. Khru
i shchev's missionaries who are
I dedicated to undermining that
i freedom," Kennedy said in his
prepared speech.
