QUESTION: Just hmv good are ilie STANFORD CREW* CUT KINGS?
ANSWER: Plenty good, ami here's all the written proof you'll ever want.
In August 1955 Charlie and Mike left Stanford lo start our own off-campus barber shops at
49'>, California Avenue, South Palo Alto. We knew that to get the Stanford men oil the campus
to come to see lis we really had to go and go we did. We staged one of the biggest advertising
campaigns in barber history. We spent thousands in all kinds of advertising ol which some of
you oliltimers still remember.
We also knew that our work had to be the finest and the best, to get them back again! Our
barbers had to be the best. We had to pay over the union scale. Stanford men zre went over
board for you. Whenever we hired a barber that was not sure of his work, 1 personally directed
his work and showed him the way to become one of the STANFORD CREW CU I KINCS.
With Stanford's support we grew from two chairs to seven chairs in seven months and to ten
and eleven barbers within a year later. A feat as yet unparalleled in barber history.
Our business was so good, our work so fine that local barbers would drive by to look in and
gape at what they thought was the monster of California Avenue.
In August 1956 I was approached by the Union Secretary and asked if I would (for the good
of the barber profession) demonstrate (at a mass meeting) to the local barbers my skills and
methods on how I do the "Stanford Crew Cut." I did this. I gave a local barber a Stanford Crew
Cut at the Union Hall in front of a large group of Local Barbers.
Believe me Stanford men, this was not easy to do. Barbers are very independent and proud
of their work. Yet I was so sure of my Stanford C irew Cuts that 1 took the challenge and gave the
perfect crew cut in front of them all. This was my greatest moment. From that day on the local
barbers had great respect lor the mighty STANIORI) CREW CI I KINC.S.
Now Stanford men this great experience has been passed on to our men. Yes. ihey are top
men; and the best barbers in this business. If you're going to pay S2.no for a haircut, GET
THE BEST!!

QUESTION: Just hmv good are ilie STANFORD CREW* CUT KINGS?
ANSWER: Plenty good, ami here's all the written proof you'll ever want.
In August 1955 Charlie and Mike left Stanford lo start our own off-campus barber shops at
49'>, California Avenue, South Palo Alto. We knew that to get the Stanford men oil the campus
to come to see lis we really had to go and go we did. We staged one of the biggest advertising
campaigns in barber history. We spent thousands in all kinds of advertising ol which some of
you oliltimers still remember.
We also knew that our work had to be the finest and the best, to get them back again! Our
barbers had to be the best. We had to pay over the union scale. Stanford men zre went over
board for you. Whenever we hired a barber that was not sure of his work, 1 personally directed
his work and showed him the way to become one of the STANFORD CREW CU I KINCS.
With Stanford's support we grew from two chairs to seven chairs in seven months and to ten
and eleven barbers within a year later. A feat as yet unparalleled in barber history.
Our business was so good, our work so fine that local barbers would drive by to look in and
gape at what they thought was the monster of California Avenue.
In August 1956 I was approached by the Union Secretary and asked if I would (for the good
of the barber profession) demonstrate (at a mass meeting) to the local barbers my skills and
methods on how I do the "Stanford Crew Cut." I did this. I gave a local barber a Stanford Crew
Cut at the Union Hall in front of a large group of Local Barbers.
Believe me Stanford men, this was not easy to do. Barbers are very independent and proud
of their work. Yet I was so sure of my Stanford C irew Cuts that 1 took the challenge and gave the
perfect crew cut in front of them all. This was my greatest moment. From that day on the local
barbers had great respect lor the mighty STANIORI) CREW CI I KINC.S.
Now Stanford men this great experience has been passed on to our men. Yes. ihey are top
men; and the best barbers in this business. If you're going to pay S2.no for a haircut, GET
THE BEST!!
It's easy to get to the Off Campus Barber Shops.
