# Laddish, Kramer Win in Primary; Candidates Elected to Five Posts
## 
### 
Paced by head yell leader candidates Tim Laddish
and Hans "Bunny" Kramer, 18 candidates won tlveir
way into next week's final elections following a count
last night which showed an unusually heavy 79 per
cent turnout of freshman voters in the primary balloting.
Because of a mixup in vote counting, a recount will
be taken this morning of the votes cast for the two
Wilbur L.ASSU representatives.
Five candidates were elected yesterday and will not
face runoffs, scheduled for next Wednesday and Thurs
day. They are Francesca Gardner and Gretchen Wiech
man, elected to Women's Council; Roger Crist, elected
to Men's Council; and Douglas K. Carriger and J. Ward
Mac Donald, elected LASSU representatives from the
Graduate School of Humanities and Sciences and Grad
uate School of Mineral Sciences.
TOTAL YOTLS CAST in the two-day primary num
bered 2.651 according to Elections Commission Chair
man Elna Rodenhouse. This is a 30 per cent turnout,
slightly below average for campus elections.

Of 1,478 freshmen, 983 voted, a much higher per
centage than normal.
Graduate voting this election was heavier than
usual, but was still a minute percentage of the eligible
voters.
Just 69 grad students voted for their engineering
representative, and only 77 turned out to cast ballots in
the race for graduate re}* to LASSU from Humanities
and Sciences and Mineral Sciences schools.
The Wilbur recount was made necessary when the
top vote-getter, Dean B. Hill, polled 206 votes in the
first count, and 193 votes in a second tabulation. The sec
ond count also came up with 52 votes short in the total
ballots cast for the Wilbur spots than the first count.
Legslature thus decided in its meeting last night to
approve all results except the Wilbur count, and called
for a recount this morning to determine who officially is
in the runoff for the frosh positions.
