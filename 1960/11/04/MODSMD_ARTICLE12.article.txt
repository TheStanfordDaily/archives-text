## The 						'Superpatriots' 
### 
The superpatriots are at it
again.
American Legion posts in Ohio
and Wisconsin this week pro
tested talks scheduled to be given
to educational groups by Dr.
Linus Pauling and columnist Max
Lerner. and succeeded in getting
Pauling's talk cancelled.
Whether Lerner's address will
como off tonight as scheduled re
mains to be seen as no decision
had been made by yesterday
afternoon.
It all started Sunday when, ac
cording to a United Press Inter
national report, "The Third Dis
trict . . . Legion conference" in
Verona, Wis., "asked that . . .
Lerner be barred from addressing
an educational convention because
of what it termed Lerner's affilia
tions with Communist front or
ganizations."
Lerner, a syndicated New York
Post columnist and professor at
Brandeis University, was sched
uled to talk to the closing session
of the Wisconsin Education Asso
ciation's annual convention in
Milwaukee today.
The Legion objected to Lerner
as a speaker "on account of af
filiation with and activity in nu
merous Communist fronts . .
The other incident happened
Tuesday when the chairman of
Ohio's Hamilton County Legion
Americanism committee pro
tested Pauling's scheduled address
to the southwestern division of
the Ohio Science Education Asso
ciation, a group of high school
science teachers.
The Legion man and a spokes
man for the local Veterans of
Foreign Wars chapter went to
the local superintendent of
schools with "Pauling's record."
The decision to cancel the talk
was made by the section chair
man of flie science association.
He said the cancellation was made
because Pauling had a heavy
speaking schedule, as good an ex
cuse as any.
Now we don't question the

Legion's right to protest anything
it desires. What bothers us is its
power, exercised so often and so
successfully, to unjustly perse
cute those whom it considers risks
to the country.
Paulina's problem is that he is
an outspoken opponent of resum
ing nuclear tests. lie has defied a
Senate subcommittee which un
successfully tried to get him to
reveal the names of those who
helped him gather signatures for
anti-testing petitions which were
submitted to the United Nations.
This makes him taboo in the
Legion's eyes, just as Lerner is
castigated because he was a mem
ber of some radical groups in the
30's.
We feel that just because a man
says something the Legion dis
likes or joins a group unaccept
able to the Legion, that he still
has a light to be heard. The Le
gion has no business questioning
the right of a man to speak be
cause of ideas he holds. It would
seem to us that totally free dis
cussion of ANY idea by ANYONE
would be the best way of keeping
a country free, and its people
thinking.
It is unfortunate, however, that
most public officials will back
down in the face of opposition by
the Legion, the I)AR or other
similar groups.
For the Legion is just as dan
gerous to this country as any
other enemy when it tries to tell
citizens to whom they should
not listen, for, as Lerner pointed
out. telling teachers to whom they
could not listen could be followed
by telling them to whom they
had to listen.
Hopefully, the Legion will
someday realize that its members
did not fight in World War II
just so one side of a story could
be presented to the American
people, but -so that a person could
feel free to say what he believes
and not have to worry about
groups such as the Legion trying
to squelch him.
