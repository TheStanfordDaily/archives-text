Kditor, the Daily:
It seems to me in this election
campaign the importance of the
vice presidential candidates has
been minimized, for more than
ever before the vice president
holds a position of greater power
and influence in the government.
Whether you agree with me on
this point or not, however, you
cannot deny that the choice of
a vice presidential candidate is
at least indicative of the party.
The Democrats' choice of Lyn
don PÂ». Johnson is a poor choice
indeed, for he is running for the
Senate on a Texas Democratic
ticket at the same time as he is
running for vice president on
Kennedy's liberal platform. Far
from conciliating the South, John
son on the same ticket as Ken
nedy directly contradicts the best
interests of Texas, a Southern
state, which he claims he will be
the best man to represent in the
Senate.
If this is true, as a senator from
Texas he would have to agree
with Nixon on such a question as
the oil depletion allowance. In
deed, Time magazine predicts
Texas, a Democratic state, to vote
Republican in the next election, a
fact which does not speak well
for either Johnson or the Demo
cratic Party. The "Great Compro
miser" as he is "fondly" termed in
Texas seems more two-faced than
anything else!
