## Presidential Comments 
### 
The African Desk of the lIR has
initiated a plan for the exchange
of students between Africa and
Stanford. A group that began
with a handful of students has
grown into a dynamic, forceful
voice of Ihe student body.
The African Desk needs and
deserves support. Many of Ihe
faculty and administration are
receptive to this student exchange
plan; BUT it will be the students
at large who determine whether
this "Operation Africa" will he
just another "good idea" or a real
asset and opportunity for Stan
ford.
As an officer of Ihe Associated
Students, 1 know that these
things don't just happen. But I
also know that IF the students
desire this and other improve
ments in the University it is their
job to voice their opinions and
to work to turn their "pipe
dreams" into reality.
The African I>csk program lias
a place for all interested students.
The Desk is divided into three
major areas. The Home Kducation
Division handles public speeches
and informal talks hy Africans
and visiting African experts.
They also make arrangements
for lunch and dinner discussions
in living groups that are inter
ested. Home Education arranges
trips and contacts for African
students to aid their practical
knowledge of American life, both
in business and the community.
The Exchange Program utilizes
persons interested in the prob
lems of financing the exchange,
selection of the Stanford scholars,

. and preparation of a program
that will help the American stu
dents to take advantage of what
i his particular African University
j has to offer.
"The Bridge," published hy the
I lIR, will he printing a newsletter
explaining the practical progress
toward realization of the Stan
ford-African project.
Discussion groups are now
heing set up. These operations
will afford comprehensive under
standing of what is going on in
the new nations of Africa! Living
groups planning to form such dis
cussion groups should contact the
African Desk at the lilt building.
Applications for the student ex
change may he picked up in the

The African Desk of the lIR has
initiated a plan for the exchange
of students between Africa and
Stanford. A group that began
with a handful of students has
grown into a dynamic, forceful
voice of Ihe student body.
The African Desk needs and
deserves support. Many of Ihe
faculty and administration are
receptive to this student exchange
plan; BUT it will be the students
at large who determine whether
this "Operation Africa" will he
just another "good idea" or a real
asset and opportunity for Stan
ford.
As an officer of Ihe Associated
Students, 1 know that these
things don't just happen. But I
also know that IF the students
desire this and other improve
ments in the University it is their
job to voice their opinions and
to work to turn their "pipe
dreams" into reality.
The African I>csk program lias
a place for all interested students.
The Desk is divided into three
major areas. The Home Kducation
Division handles public speeches
and informal talks hy Africans
and visiting African experts.
They also make arrangements
for lunch and dinner discussions
in living groups that are inter
ested. Home Education arranges
trips and contacts for African
students to aid their practical
knowledge of American life, both
in business and the community.
The Exchange Program utilizes
persons interested in the prob
lems of financing the exchange,
selection of the Stanford scholars,

. and preparation of a program
that will help the American stu
dents to take advantage of what
i his particular African University
j has to offer.
