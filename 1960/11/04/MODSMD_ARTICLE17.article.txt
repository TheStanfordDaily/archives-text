The campaign has now reached
the point where there is no longer
time to raise new issues and make
new arguments. Indeed, at this
late moment any new issue, any
new argument, any new move
made by either side must be
looked upon with great skepti
cism and the utmost suspicion.
For, as Mr. Charles P. Taft, the
Chairman of the Fair Campaign
Practices Committee, has just
said, last minute charges, and we
may add last minute stunts, are
made "with the cynical knowledge
that the facts probably won't
catch up with them until after
the votes are counted." Were the
charges or the stunts put for
ward honestly, they would have
been put forward long since, while
there was still time to investigate
and to debate them.
In the field of our foreign re
lations the two candidates have
made quite clear what is the dif
ference between them. It is not, as
is occasionally said, that they
have differing purposes and ob
jectives about Russia, China, Eu
rope, Latin America, or Africa.
Both men recognize the same na
tional commitments and the same
national interests. There is no is
sue between them in the sense
that Mr. Nixon wants to go in one
direction and Mr. Kennedy in the
opposite direction.
The real difference, then, is
not about ends and aims. It is
about ways and means. It is about
how to meet our commitments,
to protect our interests, and to
promote our purposes. In the

terms of the campaign speeches,
Mr. Nixon is relying on his per
sonal "experience" and that of
Mr. Lodge. Mr. Kennedy is calling
for a national revival. Mr. Nixon's
view is that the great contest of
the cold war is a kind of personal
duel between the president and
our adversaries abroad. Mr. Ken
nedy's view is that the contest is
one of national power in all its
forms, military, economic, scien
tific, and cultural, and that pres
tige, about which so much is said,
is the by-product of national
power.
It has been said that the hard
doctrine which Kennedy preaches
downgrades America. Quite the
contrary. The preachers of the
hard doctrine, which calls for ef
fort and sacrifice, have usually
been, like Winston Churchill in
the days of Stanley Baldwin, the
greatest patriots and the truest
servants of the people.
Those who arouse the people
from torpor and complacency,
who shock the people with the
bitter truth, are the ones who l»e
-lieve in their people, who believe
in them enough to summon them
to greatness. The Churchills, who
cry out when the people are lazy,
selfish, and sluggish with private
indulgence, do not downgrade the
nation. They force it to look at its
best possibilities, and in doing
that they revivify, they rejuve
nate, they renew the spirit of the
people, and invest them with the
pride that goes with the full exer
cise of human power.

that Mr. Nixon wants to go in one
direction and Mr. Kennedy in the
opposite direction.
The real difference, then, is
not about ends and aims. It is
about ways and means. It is about
how to meet our commitments,
to protect our interests, and to
promote our purposes. In the

terms of the campaign speeches,
Mr. Nixon is relying on his per
sonal "experience" and that of
Mr. Lodge. Mr. Kennedy is calling
for a national revival. Mr. Nixon's
view is that the great contest of
the cold war is a kind of personal
duel between the president and
our adversaries abroad. Mr. Ken
nedy's view is that the contest is
one of national power in all its
forms, military, economic, scien
tific, and cultural, and that pres
tige, about which so much is said,
is the by-product of national
power.
It has been said that the hard
doctrine which Kennedy preaches
downgrades America. Quite the
contrary. The preachers of the
hard doctrine, which calls for ef
fort and sacrifice, have usually
been, like Winston Churchill in
the days of Stanley Baldwin, the
greatest patriots and the truest
servants of the people.
Those who arouse the people
from torpor and complacency,
who shock the people with the
bitter truth, are the ones who l»e
-lieve in their people, who believe
in them enough to summon them
to greatness. The Churchills, who
cry out when the people are lazy,
selfish, and sluggish with private
indulgence, do not downgrade the
nation. They force it to look at its
best possibilities, and in doing
that they revivify, they rejuve
nate, they renew the spirit of the
people, and invest them with the
pride that goes with the full exer
cise of human power.

The campaign has now reached
the point where there is no longer
time to raise new issues and make
new arguments. Indeed, at this
late moment any new issue, any
new argument, any new move
made by either side must be
looked upon with great skepti
cism and the utmost suspicion.
For, as Mr. Charles P. Taft, the
Chairman of the Fair Campaign
Practices Committee, has just
said, last minute charges, and we
may add last minute stunts, are
made "with the cynical knowledge
that the facts probably won't
catch up with them until after
the votes are counted." Were the
charges or the stunts put for
ward honestly, they would have
been put forward long since, while
there was still time to investigate
and to debate them.
In the field of our foreign re
lations the two candidates have
made quite clear what is the dif
ference between them. It is not, as
is occasionally said, that they
have differing purposes and ob
jectives about Russia, China, Eu
rope, Latin America, or Africa.
Both men recognize the same na
tional commitments and the same
national interests. There is no is
sue between them in the sense
that Mr. Nixon wants to go in one
direction and Mr. Kennedy in the
opposite direction.
